        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current state is at turn t1 = 0.\n\n**Grid Setup**:\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so I can't go there. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I need to avoid these too.\n- Snake Positions: Only one segment, which is the head at (3,3). Since it's just one segment, the tail is also at (3,3), but it's the same cell.\n- Snake Head Direction: Currently moving Left (L), so from (3,3), if I continue left, I'd go to (2,3).\n\n**Food**:\nThere are three food items:\n1. (1,6) with value 1 and life_span 10\n2. (2,1) with value 1 and life_span 10\n3. (4,6) with value 1 and life_span 10\n\nAll have value +1, so positive food, and life_span 10, meaning they disappear after 10 turns, including the current turn. Since it's turn 0, they'll disappear after turn 10? Life_span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life_span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone at turn t + N. Let me clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for a food spawned at turn t with life_span N, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n\nIt says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So if at turn t, life_span is N, then at turn t+1, it becomes N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears.\n\nWhen life_span reaches 0, it disappears. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, if life_span is N, after this turn, it becomes N-1? Or at the start of turn?\n\nThe rule doesn't specify exactly when it decreases. But for planning, I should assume that after each turn, including turn t, the life_span decreases by 1. So at turn t, with life_span N, after processing the turn, life_span becomes N-1 for the next turn. When life_span becomes 0, the food is removed before or after the turn? I think it's safer to assume that at the beginning of turn t, the food has life_span L, and after the snake moves, if it eats the food, it's consumed; if not, at the end of the turn, life_span decreases, and if it becomes 0, the food disappears.\n\nBut for simplicity in planning, since the food is given with life_span at current turn, I can track how many turns it has left.\n\nAt turn 0, all food has life_span 10, so they will last until turn 10, I think. Let's define:\n\n- At the start of turn t, food has life_span L.\n- After the snake moves on turn t:\n  - If head moves to food cell, and it's eatable (not under body or tail issue), it is eaten, snake grows if positive.\n  - Then, for all food, life_span decreases by 1.\n  - If life_span becomes 0, food is removed.\n\nIn this case, since the snake is moving on turn t, and food is present with life_span L at start of turn.\n\nFor now, since all food has life_span 10 at turn 0, they will be available for 10 more turns, disappearing after turn 10? At turn 0, life_span 10, after turn 0, it decreases to 9, and so on, down to 0 at turn 10, and disappears after turn 10? I think after the decrease, if life_span becomes 0, it disappears, so at the end of turn t, if life_span was 1, it decreases to 0 and is removed.\n\nBut for turn 0, life_span 10, so it will decrease to 9 at the end of turn 0, and so on.\n\nSince the food is listed at turn 0 with life_span 10, it has 10 turns left including this one. After 10 turns, it will be gone.\n\nBut for planning, I can think of the remaining life.\n\nBack to the snake.\n\nSnake positions: [(3,3)] – only one cell, so head and tail are the same.\n\nDirection: Left, so last move was left, meaning it came from right, so it can't reverse to right immediately, because of no instant reverse rule.\n\nPossible moves: Since direction is L (left), I can move U (up), D (down), L (left), but not R (right), because R is opposite to L.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so I cannot move R on this turn.\n\nSo possible actions at turn 0: U, D, L.\n\nNow, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so I can only be on (1,1) to (6,6) I think? Let's see:\n\nWalls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSo valid cells are from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6, except the internal obstacles.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, inclusive? Let's list possible cells.\n\nx=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo cells to avoid: walls and obstacles.\n\nNow, snake at (3,3).\n\nFood at: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead. Since the snake is only one segment, eating food will make it grow to length 2.\n\nAlso, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (3,3), same as head, so if I eat food, the tail will stay or move? When snake eats, it grows, so if I move to a food cell, I eat it, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake grows.\n\nWith one segment, if I eat food, I move to the food cell, and since I was at (3,3), I leave that cell, and the new position is head at food, and tail at previous head? Let's clarify snake movement.\n\nStandard snake: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, and each segment follows. If it eats food, after moving, the tail doesn't retract, so length increases by one.\n\nBut here, with only one segment: if I don't eat, I move to a new cell, and tail moves to where head was, but since it's the only segment, it effectively just moves to the new cell.\n\nIf I eat food, I move to the food cell, and since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so now I have two segments: head at new position, and tail at previous position.\n\nFor example, if at turn 0, I move to a cell with food, say (2,3) if I move left, but (2,3) has no food, food are at (1,6) etc.\n\nLet's see possible moves from (3,3).\n\nCurrent position: (3,3)\n\nPossible moves:\n- U: to (3,4) – y+1\n- D: to (3,2) – y-1\n- L: to (2,3) – x-1\n- R: to (4,3) – but cannot, because reverse from L.\n\nSo can go U, D, or L.\n\nNow, check if these cells are valid:\n\n- (3,4): is it wall or obstacle? Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,4) is x=3,y=4, within 1-6, not border. Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (3,4) not in obstacles, so valid.\n\n- (3,2): similarly, x=3,y=2, not border, not in obstacles list, so valid.\n\n- (2,3): x=2,y=3, not border, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) is different, so valid? (2,3) vs (2,4), yes, different.\n\nObstacles are specific points: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (2,3) is not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) and (3,2) free.\n\nNow, food: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6) – none of these are adjacent to (3,3), so I can't eat food immediately.\n\n(3,3) to (1,6) is not adjacent; adjacent means up, down, left, right, one step.\n\n(3,3) to (1,6): delta x=2, delta y=3, not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): delta x=1, delta y=2, not adjacent.\n\n(4,6): delta x=1, delta y=3, not adjacent.\n\nSo no food adjacent, so wherever I move, I won't eat food this turn.\n\nTherefore, after moving, snake will still be length 1, at the new position.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns. The output should be actions for turn 0, turn 1, turn 2, etc., for at least 5 turns? The answer format says: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc., but it doesn't specify how many. But since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should probably output a sequence for 5 turns or more.\n\nThe user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" in the instruction, but for the answer, it might be open-ended. However, in the format, it's \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a sequence, but how long? I think I should provide actions until I have a plan, but for now, since I need to think ahead, I'll plan for several turns.\n\nPerhaps I should output actions for the next 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's first think about the immediate move.\n\nSince no food nearby, I need to head towards food.\n\nFood locations: (1,6) top-leftish, (2,1) bottom-left, (4,6) top-rightish.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so (1,6) is top row, left; (2,1) is bottom row, left; (4,6) is top row, right.\n\n(1,6): x=1,y=6\n\n(2,1): x=2,y=1\n\n(4,6): x=4,y=6\n\nSnake at (3,3), center.\n\nNow, obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nI should avoid those.\n\nAlso, since snake is short, I can go to any food, but I need to choose which one to target.\n\nBut I have to think about the path and future growth.\n\nMoreover, there's the tail reward danger, but with one segment, it's not an issue yet.\n\nFirst, let's list the obstacles clearly:\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nNow, from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3)\n\nI need to evaluate which is better for reaching food.\n\nAlso, after moving, the direction will change, so I need to consider future moves.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, I should simulate multiple paths.\n\nLet me denote the state.\n\nAt turn 0, state:\n\n- Head: (3,3), dir L\n\nAfter move:\n\nCase 1: Move U to (3,4)\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction U (since I moved up)\n\nSnake positions: [(3,4)] still length 1.\n\nFood unchanged, life_span decrease to 9 each? At end of turn, life_span decreases.\n\nBut for planning, I'll keep track.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move U, D, L, R, but no reverse? Current dir U, so cannot move D (down).\n\nPossible: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but cannot D, L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\nBut (2,4) is an obstacle! (2,4) is in the list, so wall or obstacle, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is free.\n\n(3,5) is y=5, within 1-6, not obstacle.\n\nSo from (3,4), if I moved U at turn 0:\n\nAt turn 1, position (3,4), dir U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5), L to (2,4) invalid, R to (4,4), D to (3,3) but cannot reverse, so only U or R.\n\nU to (3,5) or R to (4,4).\n\n(3,3) is not a wall, but since dir U, moving D is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D at turn 0 to (3,2), dir D.\n\nThen at turn 1, from (3,2), dir D, can move D to (3,1)? y=1, valid? y=1 is not border, borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are free except obstacles.\n\ny=1, x=3: (3,1) not obstacle, obstacles are (5,1) and (6,1), so (3,1) free.\n\nCan move D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2), but cannot U (reverse).\n\nAlso, (2,2) free? obstacles: (1,2) but not (2,2), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) free.\n\nIf move L at turn 0 to (2,3), dir L.\n\nThen at turn 1, from (2,3), dir L, can move L to (1,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2), but cannot R (reverse).\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot move U to (2,4).\n\n(1,3): x=1,y=3, not border? x=1 is not wall, walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are free except obstacles. Obstacles at (1,2) but not (1,3), so (1,3) free.\n\n(2,2) free.\n\nSo possible: L to (1,3), D to (2,2), cannot U or R.\n\nR is reverse, not allowed.\n\nNow, back to turn 0 choice.\n\nI need to get to food.\n\nFood at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n\n(1,6) is near top-left, (2,1) bottom-left, (4,6) top-right.\n\nFrom (3,3), (1,6) is left and up, but not directly adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is left and down, (4,6) right and up.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be tricky.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nSince life_span is 10, I have time, but I should go for the closest or safest.\n\nLet's find paths to each food.\n\nFirst, to (1,6): from (3,3), I can go left to (2,3), then up to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, so not possible directly.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go up? (2,4) blocked, so from (2,3), I can go left to (1,3), then up to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6).\n\n(1,4), (1,5) are free? x=1, y=4 and y=5: obstacles only (1,2), so (1,4) and (1,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3), if I go up to (3,4), then left to (2,4) but blocked, so must go right to (4,4) or up to (3,5).\n\nTo reach (1,6), it might be longer.\n\nFrom (3,3) go left to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). That's 4 moves to reach (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, to (2,1): from (3,3) go down to (3,2), then left to (2,2), then down to (2,1)? (2,1) is food, but is it accessible? (2,1) is not obstacle, so yes.\n\n(2,1) is a food position, not obstacle.\n\nObstacles are (1,2), (2,4), etc., not (2,1).\n\nSo from (3,3) to (3,2) down, then to (2,2) left, then to (2,1) down? From (2,2) to (2,1) is down, y-1.\n\nBut (2,2) to (2,1): y=2 to y=1, x=2.\n\nAnd (2,1) is food.\n\nSo path: turn 0: D to (3,2), turn 1: L to (2,2), turn 2: D to (2,1) and eat food.\n\nAt turn 2, if I move to (2,1), it has food, so I eat it.\n\nSimilarly, to (4,6): from (3,3) go up to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then up to (4,5), then to (4,6).\n\n(4,5) free? y=5, x=4, should be free.\n\nThen (4,6) food.\n\nSo 3 moves: turn 0 U, turn 1 R, turn 2 U, turn 3 to (4,6)? Let's count.\n\nTurn 0: from (3,3) U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4) R to (4,4)  // since dir U, can move R\n\nTurn 2: from (4,4) U to (4,5)  // dir now R? After moving R, direction is R, so from (4,4) dir R, can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (4,5) is up, which is not opposite, so possible.\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,5) U to (4,6) and eat.\n\nBut (4,6) is food, so at turn 3, eat.\n\nCompared to (2,1) which I can reach in 2 turns if I go down now.\n\nTo (2,1): turn 0 D to (3,2), turn 1 L to (2,2), turn 2 D to (2,1) eat.\n\nYes, 2 turns to reach and eat.\n\nTo (1,6): if go left first, turn 0 L to (2,3), turn 1 to (1,3) L, turn 2 U to (1,4), turn 3 U to (1,5), turn 4 U to (1,6) eat. 4 turns.\n\nFrom other paths, longer.\n\nNow, to (4,6) in 3 turns if up first.\n\nBut with down to (2,1) in 2 turns for food.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows.\n\nBut I need to think about survival and future.\n\nMoreover, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,1) is close, but let's see the area.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but with short snake, not issue.\n\nNow, if I eat (2,1) at turn 2, snake becomes length 2, with head at (2,1), tail at (2,2)? Let's simulate.\n\nAt turn 0: start (3,3), move D to (3,2). No food, so snake moves to (3,2), still length 1.\n\nAt turn 1: from (3,2), dir D (since moved down), I move L to (2,2). No food at (2,2), so snake moves to (2,2), still length 1.\n\nAt turn 2: from (2,2), dir L (last move left), I move D to (2,1). (2,1) has food, so I eat it. Since I ate, tail doesn't move, so snake now: head at (2,1), tail at (2,2), length 2.\n\nDirection after move: moved down, so dir D.\n\nNow, from here, I need to move on.\n\nBut I have to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (4,6), but it takes longer.\n\nNow, another food at (1,6), but far.\n\nBut all food same value, so closer is better to eat sooner.\n\nBut after eating, I grow, and need to find next food.\n\nAlso, the life_span decreases, but all have 10 turns, plenty of time.\n\nNow, possible issue: after eating at (2,1), I am at (2,1) with tail at (2,2).\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,1): since dir D, I can move L, R, D, not U (reverse).\n\nL to (1,1)? x=1,y=1, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) not listed, so free.\n\nR to (3,1), free? (3,1) not obstacle.\n\nD to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n\nx=2,y=0, border wall, cannot.\n\nSo can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nCannot move U to (2,2) because reverse, and also (2,2) is tail, but with the rule, moving to tail is allowed if tail moves away, but here tail is at (2,2), and if I move to (2,2), it would be body collision, but the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut in this case, when I move, head moves first, then tail moves.\n\nSo if head moves to a cell that was occupied by tail, and tail moves away, it's ok, no collision.\n\nBut here, from (2,1), if I move U to (2,2), which is tail, but since tail will move to the previous position or something, it should be ok.\n\nBut the no reverse rule: since current dir is D, moving U is opposite, so not allowed. Therefore, I cannot move U to (2,2) because it's reverse direction.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,1), after turn 2, I can only go L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nNow, food available: (1,6) and (4,6), and (2,1) is eaten.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), (4,6) at (4,6).\n\nFrom (2,1), to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nIf go to (1,1), then I can go up to (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle! (1,2) is internal obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nFrom (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2) invalid, D to (1,0) wall, L to (0,1) wall, R to (2,1) but (2,1) is current head position? No, from (1,1), R to (2,1), which is the previous position, but now occupied by body? After moving to (1,1), snake is head at (1,1), tail at (2,1)? Let's see.\n\nAfter eating at turn 2, positions: head (2,1), tail (2,2)\n\nAt turn 3, I move from (2,1) to, say, (1,1) L.\n\nThen head moves to (1,1), and since no food eaten, tail moves to where head was, which is (2,1). So now snake: head (1,1), tail (2,1).\n\nDirection: moved left, so dir L.\n\nNow, from (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, invalid; D to (1,0) wall, invalid; L to (0,1) wall, invalid; R to (2,1) but (2,1) is now tail, and moving to it.\n\nBut can I move to (2,1)? Since it's tail, and tail will move away.\n\nCurrent dir L, moving R is opposite, so reverse, not allowed.\n\nTherefore, from (1,1), with dir L, I can only move U, D, L, but U and D invalid, L to wall, so only possible move is R, but R is reverse, not allowed. Thus, no valid moves! Snake is trapped and will die if I go to (1,1).\n\nOh, big problem.\n\nIf from (2,1) I move to (1,1), I get stuck.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (3,1) from (2,1).\n\nAt turn 3, move R to (3,1), no food, so head to (3,1), tail to (2,1). Snake: head (3,1), tail (2,1), dir R.\n\nNow, from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1), R to (4,1).\n\nBut L to (2,1) is tail, and not reverse? Current dir R, moving L is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nU to (3,2), which is free? (3,2) not obstacle.\n\nR to (4,1), free? (4,1) not obstacle, obstacles are (5,1) and (6,1), so (4,1) free.\n\nD invalid.\n\nSo can move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1).\n\nNow, (3,2) is where tail was? Tail is at (2,1), so (3,2) is free.\n\nIf move U to (3,2), then head to (3,2), tail to (3,1)? Positions: from head (3,1) move U to (3,2), no food, so head to (3,2), tail to (2,1) -> (2,1) was tail, but tail moves to previous head position, which is (3,1).\n\nSo snake: head (3,2), body (3,1)\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I need to get to other food.\n\nBack to turn 0: if I go down to (3,2), and then to (2,2), I can eat at (2,1) on turn 2, but then from there, moving to (1,1) is deadly, as we saw, or to (3,1) is ok, but I'm in the bottom, and food is at top.\n\n(1,6) and (4,6) are both at y=6.\n\nFrom (3,1) or (2,1), it might be hard to go up because of obstacles.\n\nFor example, to go to (1,6), from (2,1) or (3,1), I need to go up, but at y=1, and there is obstacle at (1,2), (2,4), etc.\n\nSpecifically, from (3,1), I can go to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) is free.\n\nThen to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (4,6) first, from turn 0.\n\nTurn 0 move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,4) dir U, can move U or R (since L to (2,4) blocked)\n\nMove R to (4,4) for example.\n\nThen turn 2, from (4,4) dir R, can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4), not L.\n\nThen turn 3 move U to (4,6) eat.\n\nSo at turn 3, eat (4,6), snake grows: head at (4,6), tail at (4,5)? After eating, tail doesn't move.\n\nAt turn 2, before move: head at (4,4), let's trace.\n\nTurn 0: start (3,3) move U to (3,4), no eat, snake at (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4), no food, snake at (4,4)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,5), no food at (4,5), so snake at (4,5)\n\nFood at (4,6), so not eaten yet.\n\nTurn 3: from (4,5) move U to (4,6), eat food, so head to (4,6), tail stays at (4,5), so snake: head (4,6), tail (4,5), length 2.\n\nDir U.\n\nNow from (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (4,5) but (4,5) is tail; L to (3,6), R to (5,6).\n\nBut moving to tail: (4,5) is tail, and current dir U, moving D is reverse, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo can move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\n(3,6) free? x=3,y=6, not border, not obstacle.\n\n(5,6) free? obstacles (6,4), (5,1), etc., not (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is x=5,y=6, should be free.\n\nAlso, food at (1,6) and (2,1) still available.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is adjacent to (2,6) etc.\n\nFrom (4,6), I can go left to (3,6), then to (2,6), (1,6) to eat.\n\n(2,6) free? x=2,y=6, not obstacle.\n\n(1,6) is food.\n\nBut (2,6) to (1,6) left.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to (2,1), but far.\n\nNow, compare the two options.\n\nIf I go for (2,1) first, I eat at turn 2, but then I risk getting stuck or have limited moves.\n\nIf I go for (4,6), I eat at turn 3, but then I can easily go to (1,6) from there.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), from (4,6) to (3,6) to (2,6) to (1,6), 3 moves to eat.\n\nBut after eating (4,6), I am at (4,6), with tail at (4,5).\n\nAt turn 4, I can move L to (3,6) for example.\n\nNo food, so head to (3,6), tail to (4,6)? Positions: head (4,6) move L to (3,6), no eat, so head to (3,6), tail to (4,5) -> (4,5) was tail, tail moves to previous head position (4,6).\n\nSo snake: head (3,6), body (4,6)\n\nThen turn 5, from (3,6) dir L, can move U to (3,7) wall, invalid; D to (3,5); L to (2,6); R to (4,6) but (4,6) is body now.\n\nR to (4,6) is body, but current dir L, moving R is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo can move D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n\n(3,5) free, (2,6) free.\n\nThen to (1,6), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the other move at turn 0.\n\nIf I move L at turn 0 to (2,3)\n\nThen at turn 1, from (2,3) dir L, can move L to (1,3) or D to (2,2), cannot U or R.\n\nU to (2,4) blocked.\n\nSay move L to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 1: head to (1,3), no food, snake at (1,3) length 1.\n\nDir L.\n\nThen turn 2, from (1,3) dir L, can move U to (1,4), D to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, invalid; L to (0,3) wall; R to (2,3) but reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo can only move U to (1,4) if possible.\n\n(1,4) free? x=1,y=4, not obstacle.\n\nSo move U to (1,4)\n\nThen head to (1,4), dir U.\n\nThen turn 3, from (1,4) dir U, can move U to (1,5), D to (1,3) reverse not, L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle.\n\nSo only U to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 3: move U to (1,5), no food, head to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 4, from (1,5) dir U, can move U to (1,6) eat, or other moves but U to (1,6) is possible.\n\nMove U to (1,6) and eat.\n\nSo at turn 4, eat (1,6).\n\nSnake grows: head (1,6), tail (1,5)\n\nDir U.\n\nThen from (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7) wall; D to (1,5) tail, reverse not allowed; L to (0,6) wall; R to (2,6)\n\nSo only R to (2,6)\n\nThen I can go down or something.\n\nBut I have other food.\n\nNow, back to turn 0 choice.\n\nTo maximize score, I want to eat as much as possible, but need to survive.\n\nIn the first option, if I go down to (2,1), I eat at turn 2, but then I might be stuck or have difficulty.\n\nIf I go left to (1,6), I eat at turn 4.\n\nIf I go up to (4,6), I eat at turn 3.\n\nBut (4,6) is closer in terms of turns: 3 turns vs 4 for (1,6).\n\n(2,1) is 2 turns but risky.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid (2,1) because of the dead end at (1,1).\n\nIf from (2,1) I move right to (3,1), then to (3,2), (3,3), etc., I can go to (4,6) or (1,6), but it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), move U to (3,2), then to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (4,4), etc., to (4,6), many turns.\n\nWhereas if I go directly to (4,6) from start, I eat at turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,6), if I go left first, eat at turn 4.\n\nBut with (4,6), after eating, I can go to (1,6) in 3 more turns: to (3,6), (2,6), (1,6).\n\nSo total by turn 6, I can eat two food.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (1,6) first, eat at turn 4, then to (4,6) might take longer, since from (1,6) to (4,6), I need to go right and down or something, but with obstacles.\n\nFrom (1,6) to (4,6): I can go to (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), but (4,6) is already eaten? If I eat (1,6) first, (4,6) is still there.\n\nBut to go from (1,6) to (4,6), I can go (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), 3 moves, but (4,6) is food, so when I move to it, I eat.\n\nBut after eating (1,6), I am at (1,6), move to (2,6), no eat, then to (3,6), no eat, then to (4,6) eat.\n\nSo 3 turns after first eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (4,6) first at turn 3, then go to (1,6) eat at turn 6.\n\nBut at turn 6, (1,6) life_span: started at 10 turn 0, so turn 1:9, turn2:8, turn3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, turn6:4, still there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is also there, but far.\n\nNow, for (2,1), if I don't eat it early, I can eat it later.\n\nBut with the obstacles, it might be harder to reach from the top.\n\nFor example, to go to (2,1) from (1,6) or (4,6), I need to go down to y=1, but at x=2, there is (2,4) obstacle, so I might need to go around.\n\nFor instance, from (4,6) to (4,5), (4,4), etc. down to (4,1), but (4,1) free, then to (3,1), (2,1), but (2,1) is at x=2,y=1, from (3,1) to (2,1) left.\n\nBut (3,1) to (2,1) is adjacent.\n\nBut to reach (3,1) from (4,6), it takes many moves.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,6) to (2,1) also long path.\n\nBut since life_span is 10, it might be ok, but I need to eat quickly to score.\n\nBut score is per food, so eating sooner or later doesn't matter as long as I eat before it disappears.\n\nBut for survival, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nIn the (2,1) case, if I eat it early, I might get stuck if I move wrong, but if I move to (3,1) instead of (1,1), I can survive.\n\nBut from (3,1), I can go to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc., but (3,3) is center, I can go to (4,6) or (1,6) from there.\n\nBut to (4,6) from (3,3): as before, U to (3,4), R to (4,4), U to (4,5), U to (4,6), 4 moves from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,2), (3,3), then to (4,6) as above, so from (3,1) to (4,6): to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) - 6 moves, but when I reach (4,6), I eat.\n\nSimilarly, to (1,6) from (3,1): to (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) - 6 moves.\n\nWhereas if I go directly to (4,6) from start, I eat at turn 3, and then to (1,6) at turn 6.\n\nIf I go to (2,1) first, eat at turn 2, then to (3,1) at turn 3, then to (3,2) turn 4, (3,3) turn 5, then to (4,6) at turn 8 or something, later.\n\nSo for multiple food, going to (4,6) first might be better.\n\nSimilarly, going to (1,6) first takes 4 turns to eat, then to (4,6) takes 3 more, total 7 turns for two food.\n\nWith (4,6) first: eat at turn 3, then (1,6) at turn 6, total two food by turn 6.\n\nThen I can go for (2,1), which is at (2,1), from (1,6) I can go to (1,5), (1,4), etc. down, but (1,2) obstacle, so I need to go to (2,5) or something.\n\nFrom (1,6) after eating, I am at (1,6), move to (2,6), then to (2,5), but (2,4) is obstacle, so from (2,5) I can go to (2,4) invalid, or to (3,5), etc.\n\nComplicated.\n\nPerhaps (2,1) is not worth it if it takes too many turns.\n\nBut let's list the food positions: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n\n(2,1) is at bottom, while others at top.\n\nAlso, there is obstacle at (2,4), which blocks vertical movement at x=2.\n\nSimilarly, at x=1, (1,2) blocks low y.\n\nTo go to (2,1) from top, I need to go to x=3 or x=4 first, then down to y=1.\n\nFor example, from (4,6) to (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), then to (3,1), (2,1).\n\n(4,1) to (3,1) left, then (3,1) to (2,1) left.\n\nBut (4,1) is free, (3,1) free.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (2,1) is two moves: to (3,1) then (2,1).\n\nBut to reach (4,1) from (4,6), 5 moves down.\n\nSo many turns.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,6) to (2,1) also long.\n\nBut since I have to survive, I can eat (2,1) later if I want, but it might be risky if I forget, but with planning, I can.\n\nFor now, at turn 0, I think going for (4,6) is better because it's closer and safer path.\n\nIf I go for (1,6) by moving left, I can eat at turn 4, but from (1,6) I can only go right to (2,6), then I can go down or up, but y=6 is top, so down.\n\nTo (2,5), then since (2,4) blocked, I can go to (3,5), etc., to reach (4,6) or (2,1).\n\nBut (4,6) might be eaten already if I didn't go there.\n\nIn this case, if I go for (1,6) first, (4,6) is still there.\n\nBut from (1,6) to (4,6) is shorter: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), 3 moves.\n\nThen I can eat (4,6) at turn 7 if I ate (1,6) at turn 4.\n\nTurn 4 eat (1,6), turn 5 move to (2,6), turn 6 to (3,6), turn 7 to (4,6) eat.\n\nThen (2,1) still there, but far.\n\nIf I go for (4,6) first at turn 3, then to (1,6) at turn 6, same thing.\n\nThen I can decide to go for (2,1) or not.\n\nBut (2,1) might be hard to reach.\n\nSince all food +1, eating two is better than one, and I can eat two easily from the top.\n\nNow, for the immediate move, I should choose to go towards (4,6) or (1,6).\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), from (3,3), moving up gets me closer.\n\nMoving left gets me closer to (1,6).\n\nMoving down to (3,2) is towards (2,1) but risky.\n\nSo I think moving up or left is better.\n\nBut moving left to (2,3) then to (1,3), etc. for (1,6), but at (2,3), I can also go down to (2,2), then to (2,1) if I want, but I don't have to.\n\nAt turn 0, if I move L to (2,3), then at turn 1, I can choose to go to (1,3) for (1,6) or to (2,2) for (2,1).\n\nSo it's flexible.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U to (3,4), I can go to (4,4) for (4,6).\n\nBut moving U directly towards (4,6).\n\nNow, to think 5 turns ahead, let's outline a plan.\n\nFirst, prioritize (4,6) since it's reachable in 3 turns.\n\nPlan for turn 0 to turn 5.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)  // towards (4,6)\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4) dir U, move R to (4,4)  // since L blocked, and to go right\n\nThen turn 2: from (4,4) dir R, move U to (4,5)  // up towards (4,6)\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,5) dir U, move U to (4,6) and eat. Snake grows to length 2, head (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nThen turn 4: from (4,6) dir U, can move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6) (since U invalid, D reverse not)\n\nSay move L to (3,6) towards (1,6)\n\nNo food, so head to (3,6), tail to (4,6)  // tail moves to previous head (4,6)\n\nSnake: head (3,6), body (4,6)\n\nDir L (since moved left)\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,6) dir L, can move D to (3,5) or L to (2,6) (U invalid, R reverse not)\n\nSay move L to (2,6) towards (1,6)\n\nThen continue to (1,6) on turn 6.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nIf at turn 4 I move R to (5,6), but then to (1,6) is farther, so better L to (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, I could have gone for (1,6) first.\n\nBut with (4,6) first, I eat at turn 3, then head to (1,6).\n\nNow, what about (2,1)? I can ignore it for now, or later decide.\n\nBut to maximize, I should try to eat all three.\n\nBut (2,1) is out of the way.\n\nFrom the top, after eating (1,6), I can go down to y=1.\n\nFor example, from (1,6) after eating, go to (2,6), then to (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), etc. down to (3,1), then to (2,1).\n\nBut (3,4) to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut it takes many turns, and life_span might expire, but at turn 0, life_span 10, so after 10 turns, gone.\n\nTurn 0: food life_span 10\n\nAfter turn 0: life_span 9\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 9: life_span 1\n\nAfter turn 10: life_span 0, disappear before turn 11? At the end of turn when life_span decreases to 0, it disappears.\n\nSo available until turn 10 inclusive? Let's define.\n\nAt start of turn t, food has life_span L.\n\nAfter snake moves and eats, life_span decreases by 1.\n\nIf life_span becomes 0, food removed.\n\nSo for food at turn 0 with L=10, at start of turn 0, L=10.\n\nAfter turn 0 processing, L=9 for turn 1.\n\n...\n\nAt start of turn 10, L=0? After turn 9, L decreases to 0, so at start of turn 10, L=0, and it is removed before turn 10 or at the beginning?\n\nTo be safe, assume that on turn t, if L>0, food is present; after decrease, if L=0, gone.\n\nAt turn 0, L=10, present.\n\nAfter turn 0, L=9, still present for turn 1.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 9, L=1 decreases to 0, so gone for turn 10.\n\nSo food available from turn 0 to turn 9 inclusive.\n\nDisappears before turn 10.\n\nSo I have until turn 9 to eat.\n\nIn my plan, if I eat (4,6) at turn 3, (1,6) at turn 6, then (2,1) at, say, turn 10 or later, but turn 10 food gone, so I can only eat by turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 6, after eating (1,6), I am at (1,6), length 2 or more.\n\nAt turn 6, head at (1,6) after eating, tail at (1,5)? When I eat (1,6) at turn 4 in the first plan? Let's not confuse.\n\nIn the (4,6) first plan: eat (4,6) at turn 3.\n\nThen at turn 4, move to (3,6)\n\nTurn 5, move to (2,6)\n\nTurn 6, from (2,6) move to (1,6) and eat (1,6).\n\nAt turn 6, eat (1,6), so snake grows, head (1,6), tail (1,5) or something.\n\nPositions: before move turn 6, snake head at (2,6), tail at (3,6)? After turn 5: head (2,6), body (3,6)\n\nTurn 6: move to (1,6), which has food, so eat, head to (1,6), tail does not move, so new segment, snake: head (1,6), body (2,6), tail (3,6)? When eating, the tail doesn't retract, so positions become: head at new position, then previous positions, with tail added.\n\nBefore turn 6: positions (2,6), (3,6)  // head (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nMove to (1,6), eat food, so head moves to (1,6), and since ate, the tail (3,6) is removed? No, when snake eats, it grows, so the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the end, but since it didn't move, the positions extend.\n\nStandard: when snake moves and eats, head moves to new cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so length increases.\n\nBut here, when moving to food, head moves to food cell, and the tail does not move, so the new position is head at food, and the body includes the previous head position, with tail unchanged? I think I have confusion.\n\nLet me clarify from rules.\n\nThe rule says: \"when eating food, length of snake +1 if positive.\"\n\nIn movement, when snake moves to a cell without food, head moves to new cell, tail moves from last position, so the last position is freed.\n\nIf snake moves to food cell, head moves to new cell, but tail does not move, so the snake grows by one, with the new tail at the previous tail position? No.\n\nTypically: after moving to a new cell, if food eaten, the tail does not retract, so the segment that was the tail remains, and head is at new position, so length increases by one.\n\nIf not eaten, tail retracts, so length same.\n\nWith positions: suppose before move, positions [A, B, C] head A, tail C.\n\nMove to new cell D.\n\nIf D not food, new positions [D, A, B] head D, tail B.\n\nIf D is food, new positions [D, A, B, C] head D, tail C, length increased.\n\nIn this case, with one segment: before move, positions [(3,3)]\n\nMove to (3,4) not food, new positions [(3,4)] still one.\n\nMove to (3,4) with food, new positions [(3,4), (3,3)] head (3,4), tail (3,3)\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBack to plan.\n\nIn (4,6) first plan:\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4) not food, snake [(3,4)]\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4) not food, snake [(4,4)]\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,5) not food, snake [(4,5)]\n\nTurn 3: move U to (4,6) eat, snake [(4,6), (4,5)] head (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nTurn 4: move L to (3,6) not food, so head to (3,6), tail moves to (4,6)? New positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), tail was (4,5), but since no eat, tail moves from (4,5) to previous head (4,6)? Positions: before move, [ (4,6), (4,5) ] head (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nMove to (3,6) not food, so new positions: head (3,6), then previous head (4,6), and tail (4,5) is removed? No: segments: head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the previous segment.\n\nSo from [H: (4,6), B: (4,5)] move to new head (3,6), so new positions: [ (3,6), (4,6) ] and tail (4,5) is gone, so snake [(3,6), (4,6)] head (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nLength 2.\n\nDir L.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (2,6) not food, new positions head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (4,6) moves to (3,6)? Positions: before [ (3,6), (4,6) ] head (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nMove to (2,6), new [ (2,6), (3,6) ] head (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nDir L.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (1,6) eat, so head to (1,6), tail does not move, so new positions [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) ] head (1,6), tail (3,6)\n\nLength 3.\n\nThen from here, I can go to other places.\n\nBut (2,1) is still there, and I can try to eat it before turn 10.\n\nFor example, from (1,6), I can move down, but only R possible, to (2,6), but (2,6) is body, and moving R from dir L is not reverse? After moving to (1,6), dir is L (since last move left).\n\nFrom (1,6), dir L, can move U invalid, D invalid (tail or reverse), L invalid, R to (2,6) which is body.\n\nBut can I move to body? Only tail is allowed if it moves away.\n\n(2,6) is not tail, it's body, so moving to (2,6) would be collision, die.\n\nTherefore, from (1,6) after eating, I can only move to cells not occupied.\n\nR to (2,6) is occupied by body, so invalid.\n\nSimilarly, other directions invalid, so only possible if I move to a free cell, but (1,5) is tail? Tail is at (3,6), not (1,5).\n\nPositions: head (1,6), body (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nSo adjacent cells: U (1,7) wall, D (1,5) free? (1,5) is not occupied, L (0,6) wall, R (2,6) occupied by body.\n\nD to (1,5) is down, and (1,5) is free.\n\nCurrent dir L, moving D is not opposite, so possible.\n\nI can move D to (1,5).\n\nThen no food, so head to (1,5), tail moves to (2,6)? New positions: head (1,5), body (1,6), tail (2,6) moves to (1,6)? Before move: [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) ]\n\nMove to (1,5), not food, so new head (1,5), then previous head (1,6), then (2,6) but (2,6) moves to (1,6), and tail (3,6) moves to (2,6).\n\nNew positions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6) ] head (1,5), tail (2,6)\n\nDir D.\n\nThen I can continue down or right.\n\nBut to go to (2,1), I need to go down to y=1.\n\nBut at x=1, (1,2) obstacle, so I cannot go below y=2 except at other x.\n\nFrom (1,5), I can move to (1,4) down? Dir D, can move D to (1,4), U to (1,6) reverse not, L wall, R to (2,5)\n\n(2,5) free? x=2,y=5, not obstacle.\n\nThen to (2,4) but blocked, so to (3,5), etc.\n\nIt is possible but many turns, and I might not reach (2,1) by turn 9.\n\nSince the food has life_span, and I have to think about survival, eating two food might be sufficient, and I can avoid the risky (2,1) area.\n\nFor now, at turn 0, I should move towards (4,6).\n\nSo action turn 0: U\n\nThen as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nSince t1=0, I need to provide actions starting from turn 0.\n\nHow many? At least 5 turns, I think.\n\nSo let's plan 5 turns.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4)  // from (3,4) dir U, move R\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,5)  // from (4,4) dir R, move U\n\nTurn 3: move U to (4,6) eat\n\nNow turn 4: from (4,6) dir U, move L to (3,6)  // as planned\n\nTurn 5: from (3,6) dir L, move L to (2,6)  // towards (1,6)\n\nThen turn 6 would be to (1,6), but for 5 turns, up to turn 5.\n\nTurn 5 action is move L to (2,6)\n\nIn this, by turn 5, I have eaten one food at turn 3, and heading to another.\n\nIf I move down at turn 0, to (3,2), then:\n\nTurn 0: D to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,2) dir D, can move L to (2,2) or R to (4,2), say L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 2: from (2,2) dir L, move D to (2,1) eat\n\nThen at (2,1), turn 3: move R to (3,1)  // avoid left\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,1) dir R, move U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5: from (3,2) dir U, move U to (3,3) or other.\n\nBut I have eaten one food, but at bottom, far from other food.\n\nWhereas with up, I am closer to the second food.\n\nSo better to move up.\n\nTherefore, for turn 0, action U.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the first move, if I move L to (2,3), then:\n\nTurn 0: L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: from (2,3) dir L, move L to (1,3)  // cannot U\n\nTurn 2: from (1,3) dir L, move U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 3: from (1,4) dir U, move U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 4: from (1,5) dir U, move U to (1,6) eat\n\nThen turn 5: from (1,6) dir U, move R to (2,6)\n\nBut at turn 5, I eat at turn 4, so similar.\n\nBut in this, I eat at turn 4, later than turn 3 in the up-right path.\n\nSo moving up first is better to eat (4,6) earlier.\n\nThus, I think turn 0: U is the best.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for turn 0,1,2,3,4,5? Since think ahead 5 turns.\n\nt1=0, so turns 0 to 5, 6 actions.\n\nBut turn 5 is the action for turn 5, which is after 5 turns from now.\n\nCurrent turn 0, action for turn 0, then turn 1, etc.\n\nSo for 5 steps ahead, actions from turn 0 to turn 4? Or including turn 5.\n\nTypically, \"5 turns ahead\" might mean planning for the next 5 moves.\n\nBut let's see the instruction: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and answer format \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nNo specific number, but to demonstrate, I'll provide for 5 turns: turn 0 to turn 4 or 0 to 5.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have up to turn 5 action.\n\nPerhaps output until I have a plan.\n\nBut for consistency, I'll output for turn 0 to turn 4, 5 actions.\n\nOr 6 actions from turn 0 to 5.\n\nSince at turn 3 I eat, and then move.\n\nI think 5 actions are fine.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: R  // from (3,4) to (4,4)\n\nTurn 2: U  // from (4,4) to (4,5)\n\nTurn 3: U  // to (4,6) eat\n\nTurn 4: L  // to (3,6)\n\nTurn 5: L  // to (2,6)\n\nIn turn 4, from (4,6) move L to (3,6)\n\nTurn 5 from (3,6) move L to (2,6)\n\nYes.\n\nI could output this.\n\nBut to confirm, all moves are valid and safe.\n\nAlso, no food at the cells I move except turn 3.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated possible paths over at least 5 turns, considering the grid layout, food positions, and potential risks. The snake starts at (3,3) with direction Left, and the goal is to eat positive food (+1 score, length +1) while avoiding negative food (not present here), obstacles, walls, and dead ends. All food has a life span of 10 turns, so it must be eaten by turn 9.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Immediate Move (Turn 0)**: From (3,3), moving Left (L) risks a longer path to (1,6) with obstacles (e.g., (2,4) blocks vertical movement). Moving Down (D) allows quick access to (2,1) by turn 2 but creates a dead end risk at (1,1) and isolates the snake from other food. Moving Up (U) is optimal, heading toward (4,6) efficiently and enabling access to (1,6) later.\n- **Path to (4,6)**: This food is reachable in 3 turns (eaten on turn 3) via a safe path: (3,3) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (4,5) → (4,6). This avoids obstacles and walls.\n- **Path to (1,6)**: After eating (4,6), moving left toward (1,6) is straightforward: (4,6) → (3,6) → (2,6) → (1,6) (eaten on turn 6). This leverages the open top row and avoids internal obstacles.\n- **Avoiding (2,1)**: (2,1) is risky due to the obstacle at (1,2) and potential dead ends. It also requires more turns to reach from the top food, and with a life span of 10, it may not be worth the detour if it jeopardizes survival or delays eating other food. Eating (4,6) and (1,6) yields +2 score by turn 6 with minimal risk.\n- **Survival Focus**: The plan ensures no body/wall collisions and avoids reverse moves. After eating, the snake grows, so movements are chosen to prevent trapping (e.g., not moving into corners). Thinking 5+ turns ahead confirms this path allows flexibility to reach (2,1) later if possible, but it is not prioritized.\n- **5-Turn Plan**: The sequence below covers turns 0–5. By turn 5, the snake has eaten (4,6) and is positioned to eat (1,6) on turn 6. All moves are valid, with directions updated to prevent reverse moves.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 0**: Move Up (U) to (3,4). This starts the path toward (4,6), avoiding the risks of moving down or left. No food eaten; snake remains length 1.\n- **Turn 1**: Move Right (R) to (4,4). From (3,4) with direction Up, Right is valid and continues toward (4,6). No food; snake length 1.\n- **Turn 2**: Move Up (U) to (4,5). From (4,4) with direction Right, Up is valid and positions to eat (4,6) next. No food; snake length 1.\n- **Turn 3**: Move Up (U) to (4,6). Eats positive food (+1 score); snake grows to length 2 (head at (4,6), tail at (4,5)).\n- **Turn 4**: Move Left (L) to (3,6). From (4,6) with direction Up, Left is valid and begins the path to (1,6). No food; snake positions: head (3,6), tail (4,6).\n- **Turn 5**: Move Left (L) to (2,6). From (3,6) with direction Left, Left is valid and continues toward (1,6). No food; snake positions: head (2,6), tail (3,6).\n\n### Beyond Turn 5:\n- **Turn 6**: Move Left (L) to (1,6) to eat the second food (+1 score). This completes the sequence to eat both top-row foods by turn 6. (2,1) can be attempted later if viable, but it is not guaranteed due to distance and obstacles.\n\nThis plan maximizes early scoring, ensures survival, and leverages the grid layout efficiently. It achieves +2 score by turn 6 with minimal risk, compared to other paths that risk dead ends or delayed eating.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U (up)\nTurn 1: R (right)\nTurn 2: U (up)\nTurn 3: U (up)\nTurn 4: L (left)\nTurn 5: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 1, and the snake is at position (3,4) with direction Up. That means the head is at (3,4), and since it's a single segment, it's just the head, no body yet. The snake positions are given as [(3,4)], so length 1.\n\nThe walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume, since walls are at the borders. Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,6) with value 1 and life span 9\n\n- (2,1) with value 1 and life span 9\n\n- (4,6) with value 1 and life span 9\n\n- (5,4) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1, no negative food mentioned.\n\nSince the snake is length 1, eating any food will make it grow to length 2. But I need to be careful about the tail reward danger later when it's longer.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,4), direction U, so moving up increases y-coordinate. In the coordinate system, y=0 is probably bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases going up, so (0,0) is bottom-left? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nLet me sketch a grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\nBorder cells are occupied by walls, so if x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, those cells are walls. So the snake can only be on cells where 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6, I think. x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, since x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are also blocked.\n\nSnake head at (3,4), no body.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (1,6) - top-left? y=6 is high, since y=7 is top wall.\n\n- (2,1) - bottom-left, y=1 low\n\n- (4,6) - top-rightish\n\n- (5,4) - middle-right\n\nNow, head at (3,4), direction U, so if I move up, to (3,5).\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, possible actions: I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is U, I cannot move D (down) on the next turn, because that would be opposite.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo for turn 1, current direction is U, so I cannot choose D for turn 1 action. So possible moves: U, L, R. D is not allowed because it's opposite to U.\n\nU is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so yes, U and D are opposites.\n\nSo for turn 1, actions: U, L, R.\n\nNow, after moving, the direction will be set to whatever I choose.\n\nSince snake is length 1, moving to a cell: if I move to a cell with food, I eat it and grow. Otherwise, I just move, but since no body, I don't leave a tail or anything.\n\nWith length 1, moving to an empty cell just moves the head, no growth.\n\nIf I move to a food cell, I eat it, length becomes 2.\n\nNow, food life span: each turn, life span decreases, including current turn? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo when I get the state at turn 1, the food has life span as given, and after each turn, it decreases by 1.\n\nFor example, food at (1,6) has life span 9, so it will disappear after 9 more turns? Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd it says \"on turn t1\", so at turn t1, life_span is as given, and it decreases each turn, so when life_span reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or something.\n\nTypically, it decreases at the end of the turn, I think.\n\nBut for decision, I need to know how many turns it will last.\n\nFor example, at turn 1, life span 9, so after turn 1, it becomes 8, and so on, until it becomes 0, and then it disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turns when life_span >=1.\n\nNow, for the snake: since it's length 1, positions: head only. After moving, if I don't eat food, head moves to new position, and since no body, the old position is empty.\n\nIf I eat food, head moves to food cell, and a new body segment is added at the previous position, so length becomes 2.\n\nBut in this case, with one segment, eating food means the new body is at the old head position.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible cells I can move to from (3,4).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,5)\n\n- D: but D is opposite to current direction, not allowed. So cannot move D.\n\n- L: to (2,4)\n\n- R: to (4,4)\n\nNow, check for walls or obstacles.\n\n(3,5): is it wall? Borders: x=0,7 y=0,7 walls. (3,5) x=3 between 1-6, y=5 between 1-6, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (3,5) not in list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4): x=2,y=4. Internal obstacles have (2,4)? Look: internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)] — oh, (2,4) is an obstacle! So (2,4) is blocked, cannot move there.\n\n(4,4): x=4,y=4, not in obstacles list, and not border, so free.\n\n(3,5) free as above.\n\nD not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) or R to (4,4). L to (2,4) is blocked by obstacle.\n\nSo only two choices: U or R.\n\nNow, if I move U to (3,5), is there food? Food at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6), (5,4). (3,5) not a food position, so no food, so after moving, snake still at (3,5), length 1.\n\nIf I move R to (4,4), food at (5,4) is nearby, but (4,4) itself not food, so no eat, snake to (4,4), length 1.\n\nNow, direction: after move, if I move U, new direction U; if R, new direction R.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, food life spans: all have high life span, 9 or 10, so they will last many turns, no immediate risk of disappearing.\n\nSince snake is short, I should try to eat food to grow.\n\nClosest food: from (3,4), (5,4) is at x=5,y=4, so distance |5-3| + |4-4| = 2, so two steps away, but I can move R to (4,4), then to (5,4) if possible.\n\n(4,4) to (5,4) is east, right.\n\nBut is (5,4) blocked? (5,4) is a food position, but is it accessible? Walls: not border, internal obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (5,4) not in obstacle list, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is food, at (4,6), from (3,4) to (4,6) is |4-3| + |6-4| =1+2=3 steps, etc.\n\n(2,1) is far, (1,6) is far.\n\nSo (5,4) is closest.\n\nBut to eat (5,4), I need to move to it.\n\nFirst, turn 1: if I move R to (4,4), then turn 2, I can move R to (5,4) and eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U to (3,5), then from there I can go to (4,5) or other places, but (5,4) is closer via R.\n\nBut let's consider the obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4) is west of (5,4)? (6,4) is obstacle, so from (5,4), moving east to (6,4) is blocked, but I don't need to go there.\n\nAlso, (5,1) obstacle, (2,4) obstacle, (6,1), (1,2).\n\nNow, after eating (5,4), snake will be length 2, with head at (5,4) and body at previous position, which would be (4,4) if I came from left.\n\nThen I need to move away without colliding.\n\nBut since body is at (4,4), and head at (5,4), I can move U, D, L, R, but L would be back to (4,4), which has the body, but when I move, the body also moves, so it might be ok, but let's see collision rules.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail moves.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, with length 2, after eating, head at (5,4), body at (4,4).\n\nNow, if I move L back to (4,4), but (4,4) has the body, but since the snake moves, the body will move to where the head was, which is (5,4)? Let's think step by step.\n\nWhen snake moves: head moves to new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo for length 2: positions [head, tail]\n\nAfter move: new head position, and tail moves to where head was.\n\nSo if head is at A, tail at B.\n\nAfter moving head to C:\n\n- If C is not food, tail moves to A, so new positions [C, A]\n\n- If C is food, tail stays, new segment added at A, so positions [C, A] but now length 3? No.\n\nWhen eating: head moves to food cell, then a new body segment is added at the previous head position. So if head was at P, moves to F (food), then new positions: head at F, and body segment at P. So length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, from [P] to [F, P] after eating.\n\nThen when moving next, head moves to new cell, say Q, then the body segment moves to F, so positions [Q, F]\n\nIf not eating, head moves to Q, and since no body, it just [Q], but with body, it moves.\n\nBack to the situation.\n\nAt turn 1, snake at [(3,4)], direction U.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (4,4)\n\n- Turn 1: action R, move to (4,4), no food, so snake now at [(4,4)], direction now R.\n\n- Turn 2: from (4,4), direction R, can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move L (opposite to R), so can move U, D, R.\n\nNow, (5,4) has food, so I can move R to (5,4).\n\nMove to (5,4), which has food, so eat it, snake grows: head at (5,4), body at (4,4), so positions [(5,4), (4,4)], length 2.\n\nDirection after move is R.\n\nNow, life span of that food was 10, but we eat it, so it's gone.\n\nNow, turn 3: snake at [(5,4), (4,4)], head direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so cannot move L (opposite to R). So U, D, R.\n\nNow, cells around:\n\n- U: (5,5)\n\n- D: (5,3)\n\n- R: (6,4)\n\nBut (6,4) is an internal obstacle! From the list: (6,4) is obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nAlso, borders: (5,5): x=5,y=5, not border, obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (5,5) not in list, so free.\n\n(5,3): similarly, not in obstacles, free.\n\n(6,4) blocked.\n\nSo can move U to (5,5) or D to (5,3).\n\nNow, if I move U to (5,5), no food there.\n\nOr D to (5,3), no food.\n\nFood left: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), which is north-west from (5,4), but I'm at (5,4) or after move.\n\nFrom (5,4), after eating, head at (5,4).\n\nTo go to (4,6), I need to move left and up, but from (5,4), moving L to (4,4) but (4,4) has the body! And it's the tail.\n\nCan I move to (4,4)? (4,4) is occupied by the tail.\n\nBut according to rule, I can move to the tail cell only if the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, if I move left to (4,4), which is the tail position.\n\nWhen I move: head moves to new cell, then tail moves to where head was.\n\nSo if head at (5,4), tail at (4,4).\n\nI move head to (4,4). But (4,4) is currently occupied by tail, so head moves to (4,4), then tail moves to (5,4).\n\nSo new positions: head at (4,4), tail at (5,4).\n\nBut head moved to where tail was, and tail moved to where head was, so now positions swapped.\n\nBut in terms of collision, since I moved to the tail cell, and tail moves away, it should be ok, no collision.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo yes, moving to tail cell is allowed and safe.\n\nIn this case, from (5,4) with tail at (4,4), moving L to (4,4) is possible.\n\nBut in turn 3, I can move L to (4,4), which is the tail.\n\nAfter move: head to (4,4), tail to (5,4), so positions [(4,4), (5,4)].\n\nBut (4,4) was the previous tail, now head is there, and tail is at (5,4).\n\nNo food eaten, since (4,4) had no food.\n\nNow, direction: I moved L, so new direction L.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to (4,6) or other places.\n\nBut let's see the other option first.\n\nBack to turn 3 choices: I could move U or D instead of L.\n\nBut moving L is possible.\n\nIn this path, if I go to (4,4) on turn 3, then I can go up to (4,5) or left to (3,4), etc.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), so from (4,4) I can go U to (4,5), then U to (4,6).\n\n(4,5) and (4,6) need to be checked.\n\n(4,5) not obstacle, (4,6) is food.\n\nSimilarly, other foods.\n\nBut let's consider the first choice at turn 1.\n\nI had another option: at turn 1, move U to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 1: move U to (3,5), no food, snake at [(3,5)], direction U.\n\nThen turn 2: from (3,5), direction U, can move U, L, R (no D, opposite).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,6)\n\n- L: to (2,5)\n\n- R: to (4,5)\n\nNow, (3,6): not border, not obstacle, free.\n\n(2,5): x=2,y=5, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed, so free.\n\n(4,5) free.\n\nFood: (4,6) is at (4,6), close.\n\nI can move R to (4,5) on turn 2, then U to (4,6) on turn 3 to eat it.\n\n(4,6) has food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is at (1,6), which is left and up from (3,5), but (1,2) obstacle, etc.\n\nBut (4,6) is closer.\n\nNow, compare the two paths.\n\nPath A: turn 1 R to (4,4), then turn 2 R to (5,4) eat, grow to length 2.\n\nThen turn 3, I can move U to (5,5) or D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\nFrom (5,4), moving L to (4,4) is back, but as we said, it's safe.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go to (4,5) etc.\n\nPath B: turn 1 U to (3,5), then turn 2 to say (4,5), then turn 3 U to (4,6) eat, grow to length 2.\n\nIn both cases, I eat a food by turn 3.\n\nNow, which one is better? Both foods are +1, same.\n\nBut after eating, I need to survive and eat more.\n\nAlso, consider the grid with obstacles.\n\nList all obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nAnd borders.\n\nNow, food at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6), (5,4)\n\n(2,1) is near obstacle (2,4) and (1,2), might be tricky to reach.\n\n(1,6) near top-left.\n\n(4,6) top-middle, (5,4) middle-right.\n\nSince snake is at (3,4), going to (5,4) is 2 steps, to (4,6) is 3 steps via (3,5) and (4,5) to (4,6), or directly? From (3,4) to (4,6) is not adjacent, so min 2 steps but not straight.\n\n|dx|=1, |dy|=2, so min 2 steps if I move diagonally, but I can only move orthogonally, so min 2 steps? No, orthogonally, I need to move in x and y separately.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (4,6): one move to (4,4) or (3,5), then to (4,5) or (3,6), then to (4,6). So 3 moves.\n\nSimilarly to (5,4): from (3,4) to (4,4) to (5,4), 2 moves.\n\nTo (1,6): from (3,4) to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so cannot go directly left. Need to go around, e.g., to (3,5) then (2,5) then (1,5) or something, then to (1,6), but (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, which is border? Borders are walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is not wall, but y=6, y=7 is wall, so (1,6) is playable if not obstacle.\n\n(1,6) not obstacle.\n\nBut to reach (1,6) from (3,4): since (2,4) obstacle, I need to go via (3,5) to (2,5) to (2,6) to (1,6) or (3,5) to (3,6) to (2,6) to (1,6), etc. At least 3 moves.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): at (2,1), obstacles (2,4) above, (1,2) nearby, so from (3,4) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (2,2) to (2,1) or something, but (1,2) obstacle, so need to avoid.\n\nBut anyway, (5,4) is closest.\n\nNow, back to thinking ahead.\n\nI need to maximize score, so eat all food if possible, but with survival.\n\nSince life spans are long, 9 and 10, and turn 1, they decrease each turn, so after 10 turns, (5,4) disappears, but I can eat it early.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut for now, let's plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: when snake is longer, if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because after eating, tail doesn't move, and head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently snake length 1, so not an issue yet.\n\nNow, let's consider the path to eat (5,4) first.\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 2: move R to (5,4), eat, snake now at [(5,4), (4,4)], direction R.\n\nNow turn 3: from (5,4), direction R, possible moves U, D, L (since R is blocked by obstacle (6,4)).\n\nCannot move R.\n\nCan move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), or L to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is the tail, so moving L to (4,4) is safe, as discussed.\n\nIf I move L to (4,4), then head at (4,4), tail at (5,4), positions [(4,4), (5,4)], direction L.\n\nNow from (4,4), I can go to (4,6) for food.\n\n(4,6) is at (4,6), so from (4,4) move U to (4,5), then U to (4,6).\n\n(4,5) and (4,6) should be free.\n\n(4,5) not obstacle, (4,6) is food.\n\nSo turn 4: from (4,4), move U to (4,5), no food (assuming), so positions: head to (4,5), tail to (4,4)? Let's see.\n\nCurrent positions: head at (4,4), tail at (5,4).\n\nMove head to (4,5): new head position (4,5), then tail moves to previous head position (4,4). So new positions: [(4,5), (4,4)].\n\nBody is vertical now.\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,5), direction U, can move U, L, R (no D, opposite).\n\nU to (4,6): has food, so move to (4,6), eat, grow. Head at (4,6), new body at previous head position (4,5), so positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), and previous tail (4,4), so [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4)].\n\nLength 3.\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, food eaten: (5,4) and (4,6), so left (1,6) and (2,1).\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to other foods.\n\nBut (4,6) is top, y=6, near top wall.\n\nPossible moves from (4,6): direction U, but U to (4,7) is y=7, wall, cannot move. Border wall.\n\nSo cannot move U.\n\nCan move L or R or D, but no instant reverse? Direction is U, but I cannot move U, so possible moves: L, R, D, but D is opposite to U, so cannot move D? No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nBut U is blocked, so I can only move L or R.\n\nL to (3,6), R to (5,6).\n\n(3,6) and (5,6) should be free, not obstacles.\n\n(5,6): x=5,y=6, obstacles not there, border ok.\n\nSimilarly (3,6).\n\nNow, food at (1,6), which is at (1,6), so I can move L to (3,6), then to (2,6), then to (1,6).\n\n(2,6) should be free.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (2,4), but (2,6) is different.\n\nAlso, (1,2) obstacle, but y=2.\n\nSo from (4,6), turn 6: say move L to (3,6), no food, positions: head to (3,6), tail moves to (4,5)? Current positions [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4)]\n\nAfter move head to (3,6): new head (3,6), then body: the segment behind head was (4,5), which moves to (4,6), and tail (4,4) moves to (4,5). So new positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 7: from (3,6), direction L, can move U, D, L (no R, opposite).\n\nU to (3,7) y=7 wall, cannot.\n\nD to (3,5)\n\nL to (2,6)\n\nR not allowed.\n\nSo move L to (2,6) or D to (3,5).\n\n(2,6) is free, I think.\n\nThen move to (2,6), no food, positions: head (2,6), body moves: segment at (4,6) moves to (3,6), segment at (4,5) moves to (4,6)? Let's trace:\n\nPrevious positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter move head to (2,6): new head (2,6)\n\nThen body: the segment after head is (4,6), which moves to previous head position (3,6)\n\nThe tail (4,5) moves to previous position of next segment, which is (4,6), so to (4,6)\n\nNew positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]? No.\n\nThe body segments: after head, the first body segment moves to where head was, which is (3,6)\n\nThe second body segment moves to where the first was, which was (4,6)\n\nIn positions: before move: [head: (3,6), seg1: (4,6), seg2: (4,5)]\n\nAfter head moves to (2,6):\n\n- seg1 moves to previous head position (3,6)\n\n- seg2 moves to previous seg1 position (4,6)\n\nSo new positions: head (2,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (4,6)\n\nBut seg2 was tail, now at (4,6)\n\nThen turn 8: from (2,6), move L to (1,6), which has food.\n\nEat, grow: head to (1,6), new body at previous head position (2,6), so positions: head (1,6), body (2,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (4,6) — length 4 now.\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, last food at (2,1).\n\nFrom (1,6), need to go down to (2,1).\n\nBut obstacles: (1,2) at (1,2), which is below (1,6).\n\nAlso, (2,4) obstacle.\n\nSo path down might be blocked.\n\nFrom (1,6), direction L, but L to (0,6) x=0 wall, cannot.\n\nCan move U, D, R (no L opposite? Direction L, so cannot move R? Current direction L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nU to (1,7) y=7 wall, cannot.\n\nD to (1,5)\n\nR not allowed.\n\nSo only move D to (1,5).\n\nThen from (1,5), can move D, L, R, etc.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle at (1,2), so I cannot go directly down to (1,1) or something.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1).\n\nFrom (1,5), move D to (1,4), then D to (1,3), but (1,3) might be free, but then (1,2) is obstacle, so cannot go to (1,2), and (1,1) is y=1, but border? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 is ok, but (1,2) blocked.\n\nx=1,y=1: not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) not listed, should be free.\n\nBut to reach (2,1) from above.\n\nSince (1,2) blocked, I need to go to (2,1) from the right or below.\n\nBut below is y=0 wall.\n\nFrom (1,5), I can move R to (2,5), then down to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(2,4) obstacle, so from (2,5), I can move D to (2,4)? No, (2,4) obstacle, blocked.\n\nSo I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (1,5) move to (2,5), then to (3,5), then down to (3,4), etc., but (3,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn this path, by turn 8 I am at (1,6) with length 4, and need to go to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at bottom, and I have to avoid obstacles.\n\nMoreover, food life span: at turn 1, (2,1) has life span 9, so decreases each turn, after 9 turns, at turn 10 it disappears? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 1, life span 9, so on turn 1, it is present, life span 9.\n\nAfter turn 1, life span 8, and so on, until life span 1 on turn 9, then after turn 9, it becomes 0 and disappears, I think.\n\nTypically, it can be eaten on turn when life span >=1.\n\nSo (2,1) can be eaten up to turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life span 9, up to turn 9.\n\nIn my sequence, I ate (5,4) on turn 2, (4,6) on turn 5, (1,6) on turn 8, so turn 8, (2,1) life span: started 9 at turn 1, after 7 turns? Turn 1: life span 9\n\nAfter turn 1: 8\n\nAfter turn 2: 7\n\n...\n\nAfter turn k-1: life span at turn k is 10 - k for (5,4)? (5,4) life span 10 at turn 1.\n\nDefine: at the start of turn t, food has life span L, then during the turn, if snake moves to it, eats, else at end of turn, life span decreases by 1.\n\nSo for (2,1): at start turn 1, life span 9.\n\nIf not eaten, at start turn 2, life span 8, ..., at start turn 9, life span 1, can be eaten on turn 9. After turn 9, if not eaten, life span 0, disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life span 9, same.\n\n(4,6) life span 9.\n\n(5,4) life span 10, can be eaten up to turn 10.\n\nIn my sequence, I ate (1,6) on turn 8, which is before turn 9, so ok.\n\nNow for (2,1), at turn 8, when I am at (1,6), life span of (2,1) is: at turn 1:9, turn2:8, ..., turn8: 9-7=2? Turn 1: L=9\n\nTurn 2: L=8\n\n...\n\nTurn t: L = 10 - t for (2,1)? At turn t, L = initial - (t-1)\n\nAt turn 1, L=9\n\nAfter turn 1, L decreases to 8, so at start of turn 2, L=8\n\nAt start of turn t, L = initial_L - (t-1)\n\nFor (2,1), initial L=9, so at turn t, L = 10 - t? 10-t at turn t: turn1:9, turn2:8, ..., turn9:1, turn10:0 not present.\n\nL = 10 - t? Turn1:10-1=9, turn2:10-2=8, yes L = 10 - t for (2,1)? Initial 9, so L = 9 - (t-1) = 10 - t.\n\n9 - (t-1) = 10 - t, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) L=9, same.\n\n(4,6) L=9.\n\n(5,4) L=10, at turn t, L=11-t? Turn1:10, turn2:9, ..., turn10:1, turn11:0.\n\nL=11-t for (5,4).\n\nIn my sequence, turn 8, (2,1) L=10-8=2, so can be eaten on turn 9 or 10? At turn 8, L=10-8=2, so after turn 8, L=1, present on turn 9 with L=1.\n\nCan be eaten on turn 9.\n\nNow, from (1,6) on turn 8, after eating (1,6), positions: head (1,6), body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)? Earlier: when I moved to (1,6) on turn 8, I ate, so positions: head (1,6), new body at (2,6), and previous body: from before move, positions were [ (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ]? Let's clarify.\n\nOn turn 8, before move: positions [head (2,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (4,6)]? Earlier on turn 7, after moving to (2,6): positions [ (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ]? I think I have confusion.\n\nLet's reset the position sequence.\n\nAfter eating (4,6) on turn 5: positions [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,6), no eat, so head to (3,6), then body: seg1 at (4,6) moves to (4,6)? Previous head was (4,6), so seg1 moves to (4,6), but (4,6) was head, now seg1 moves there, and seg2 at (4,5) moves to previous seg1 position (4,6)? Positions before move: head (4,6), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (4,4)\n\nAfter head moves to (3,6):\n\n- seg1 moves to previous head position (4,6)\n\n- seg2 moves to previous seg1 position (4,5)\n\nSo new positions: head (3,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (4,5)\n\nThen turn 7: from (3,6), move L to (2,6), no eat.\n\nHead to (2,6)\n\nThen seg1 at (4,6) moves to previous head (3,6)\n\nSeg2 at (4,5) moves to previous seg1 position (4,6)\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (4,6)\n\nThen turn 8: move L to (1,6), which has food, eat.\n\nHead to (1,6), new body at previous head position (2,6), so positions: head (1,6), new seg1 (2,6), then previous seg1 (3,6) and seg2 (4,6) remain, so [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ] length 4.\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow turn 9: from (1,6), direction L, but L to (0,6) wall, cannot.\n\nU to (1,7) wall, cannot.\n\nD to (1,5)\n\nR not allowed (opposite to L).\n\nSo only move D to (1,5).\n\nNo food, positions: head to (1,5), then body: seg1 at (2,6) moves to (1,6), seg2 at (3,6) moves to (2,6), seg3 at (4,6) moves to (3,6)? Positions before: [head (1,6), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (4,6)]\n\nAfter move head to (1,5):\n\n- seg1 moves to previous head (1,6)\n\n- seg2 moves to previous seg1 position (2,6)\n\n- seg3 moves to previous seg2 position (3,6)\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), seg1 (1,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (3,6)\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, (2,1) food at (2,1), life span: at turn 9, L=10-9=1, so can be eaten this turn or gone next.\n\nBut I am at (1,5), need to get to (2,1).\n\nPossible moves: from (1,5), direction D, can move U, L, R, D (no instant reverse, so cannot move U opposite to D? Current direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nCan move L, R, D.\n\nL to (0,5) x=0 wall, cannot.\n\nD to (1,4)\n\nR to (2,5)\n\n(1,4) and (2,5) possible.\n\n(2,5) is free, I think.\n\nIf I move R to (2,5), then positions: head to (2,5), seg1 to (1,5), seg2 to (1,6), seg3 to (2,6)? Before move: head (1,5), seg1 (1,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (3,6)\n\nAfter head to (2,5):\n\n- seg1 moves to (1,5)\n\n- seg2 moves to (1,6)\n\n- seg3 moves to (2,6)\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), seg1 (1,5), seg2 (1,6), seg3 (2,6)\n\nNow, (2,1) is at (2,1), so I need to go down from (2,5) to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle! Blocked.\n\nCannot go down directly.\n\nMove D to (1,4) from (1,5).\n\nThen from (1,4), can move D to (1,3), etc.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so from (1,3) I can move R to (2,3), then D to (2,2), then L to (2,1)? (2,2) might be free.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (2,1) in time.\n\nFrom (1,5) on turn 9, I move to (2,5) or (1,4).\n\nSay move to (1,4): head to (1,4), seg1 to (1,5), etc.\n\nThen turn 10: from (1,4), direction D (since I moved D), can move L, R, D (no U).\n\nL to (0,4) wall, cannot.\n\nD to (1,3)\n\nR to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo only move D to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 11: from (1,3), move D to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, cannot.\n\nOr move R to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,1) is gone by turn 10, since at turn 10, L=10-10=0 for (2,1)? At turn 9, L=1, after turn 9, if not eaten, L=0, disappears, so on turn 10, not present.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot reach (2,1) from here in one move; it's at least two moves away, and on turn 9 I am at (1,5), (2,1) is at distance |2-1| + |1-5| =1+4=4, so at least 4 moves, but by turn 9 it must be eaten, so I miss it.\n\nOn turn 9, I can move to (2,5), but from there, (2,4) blocked, so I need to go to (3,5) or something, but (2,1) not reachable in one move.\n\nSo in this path, I might not get (2,1).\n\nBut let's see the other initial choice.\n\nPerhaps I should eat (2,1) earlier.\n\nBut it's far.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 1, instead of going to (5,4), go to (4,6) first.\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 2: from (3,5), move R to (4,5) (since (4,6) is up, but I can go to (4,5) first)\n\nThen turn 3: move U to (4,6) eat.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nBut then I am at (4,6) on turn 3 with length 2.\n\nThen I can go to (5,4) or to (1,6), etc.\n\nBut (5,4) is closer.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (5,4): |5-4| + |4-6| =1+2=3 moves, e.g., D to (4,5), then R to (5,5), then D to (5,4), but (5,4) has food.\n\nBut on turn 3, after eating (4,6), positions: head (4,6), body at (4,5) or wherever.\n\nAfter eating (4,6) on turn 3, head at (4,6), body at previous position, which was (4,5) if I came from (4,5).\n\nThen turn 4: from (4,6), direction U (since I moved U to it), but U blocked, so move L or R.\n\nSay move L to (3,6), then turn 5 move to (3,5) or something, then to (4,4), then to (5,4).\n\nBut (5,4) life span 10, can be eaten later.\n\nBut to eat (2,1), it has less life span.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize food with shorter life span, but all have similar, (2,1) L=9, (5,4) L=10, so (2,1) disappears sooner.\n\nAt turn 1, (2,1) L=9, (5,4) L=10, so (2,1) must be eaten by turn 9, (5,4) by turn 10.\n\nSince (2,1) is farther, I should go for it first.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (2,1): but (2,4) obstacle, so path is not direct.\n\nPossible path: move D to (3,3) but current direction U, cannot move D on turn 1.\n\nTurn 1 only U, L, R possible, L blocked, so only U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), then from there I can move D? Turn 2 from (3,5) direction U, can move U, L, R, no D, opposite.\n\nSo I cannot move down immediately.\n\nTo go down, I need to change direction.\n\nFor example, turn 1 move U to (3,5), turn 2 move L to (2,5), then turn 3 move D to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, blocked.\n\nTurn 2 move R to (4,5), turn 3 move D to (4,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (2,1), I need to go to the bottom.\n\nFrom (3,5), move to (3,4) but (3,4) is where I was, but no, I am at (3,5).\n\nMove D to (3,4), but on turn 2, direction U, cannot move D.\n\nSo I have to move U, L, or R.\n\nMove to (3,6), or (2,5), or (4,5).\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move D to (2,4) blocked, or L to (1,5), or U to (2,6), etc.\n\nThen from (1,5), move D to (1,4), then D to (1,3), but (1,2) obstacle, so cannot go to (1,1) or (2,1) directly.\n\nFrom (1,3), move R to (2,3), then D to (2,2), then L to (2,1)? (2,2) free?\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nFor example, turn 1: U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: L to (2,5)  (assume (2,5) free)\n\nTurn 3: from (2,5), direction L, can move U, D, L (no R).\n\nU to (2,6), D to (2,4) blocked, so move U to (2,6) or L to (1,5).\n\nSay move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 4: from (1,5), direction L, can move U, D, L (no R).\n\nL to (0,5) wall, cannot.\n\nU to (1,6) has food, but I can eat it now or later.\n\nD to (1,4)\n\nSay move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 5: from (1,4), direction D, can move L, R, D (no U).\n\nL wall, D to (1,3), R to (2,4) blocked, so move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 6: from (1,3), direction D, can move L, R, D (no U).\n\nL wall, D to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, blocked.\n\nR to (2,3)\n\nSo move R to (2,3)\n\nTurn 7: from (2,3), direction R (since I moved R), can move U, D, R (no L).\n\nU to (2,4) blocked, D to (2,2), R to (3,3)\n\nSay move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 8: from (2,2), direction D, can move L, R, D (no U).\n\nL to (1,2) blocked, D to (2,1) eat! (2,1) has food.\n\nSo on turn 8, move to (2,1) and eat.\n\nBut on turn 8, (2,1) L=10-8=2, so can be eaten.\n\nThen I have length 2 or more.\n\nBut I didn't eat other foods yet.\n\nIn this path, I ate (2,1) on turn 8.\n\nBut I could have eaten (1,6) earlier.\n\nFor example, on turn 4 at (1,5), I could move U to (1,6) and eat.\n\nThen from there, go down to (2,1), but with obstacles.\n\nBut (2,1) can be eaten by turn 9.\n\nIn the first path, by going to (5,4) first, I ate three foods but missed (2,1).\n\nPerhaps I can eat (2,1) after.\n\nBut in the first path, it was hard to reach from top-left.\n\nAnother option: after eating (5,4) and (4,6), go down to eat (2,1) before (1,6).\n\nFor example, after eating (5,4) on turn 2, positions [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move D to (5,3)  (since U and R possible but R blocked, L possible)\n\n(5,3) free.\n\nThen from (5,3), can move to (5,2), (4,3), etc.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), so I need to go left and down.\n\nBut obstacles: (5,1) at (5,1), so bottom row might be tricky.\n\nFrom (5,3), move L to (4,3), then to (3,3), to (3,2), to (2,2), to (2,1), but (3,2) free? Obstacles not listed, so free.\n\n(2,1) can be reached.\n\nBut it takes turns, and (4,6) might be eaten or not.\n\nBut (4,6) has life span 9, so by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) by turn 9.\n\nTo maximize score, I should try to eat all four foods.\n\nSince grid is small, and obstacles, I need a path that collects all.\n\nStart from (3,4), go to (5,4) first, then to (4,4) or (5,3), then to (4,6), then to (1,6), then to (2,1), but (2,1) might be gone.\n\nFrom (4,6), instead of going left, go down.\n\nBut (4,6) is top, (2,1) bottom.\n\nOr after (5,4), go to (4,6) via (4,5), then from (4,6) go to (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), then from (1,6) down, but as before, hard to reach (2,1).\n\nPerhaps eat (2,1) before (1,6).\n\nBut (2,1) is south, (1,6) north.\n\nSince (2,1) has shorter effective life, I should prioritize it.\n\nAt turn 1, only U or R possible.\n\nIf I move R to (4,4), then to (5,4) eat on turn 2.\n\nThen on turn 3, instead of going up, go down to (5,3).\n\nTurn 3: from (5,4) move D to (5,3)\n\nNo food, positions: head (5,3), tail (5,4)? Before move: head (5,4), tail (4,4)\n\nMove head to (5,3): new head (5,3), tail moves to (5,4), so positions [(5,3), (5,4)] vertical.\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 4: from (5,3), direction D, can move L, R, D (no U).\n\nD to (5,2)\n\nL to (4,3)\n\nR to (6,3) but x=6, border? x=7 wall, so x=6 not wall, but (6,4) obstacle, (6,3) not listed, so free.\n\nBut (6,1) obstacle, but (6,3) ok.\n\nBut let's go towards (2,1).\n\nMove L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5: from (4,3), direction L, can move U, D, L (no R).\n\nL to (3,3)\n\nU to (4,4) but (4,4) might be free, but not food.\n\nD to (4,2)\n\nSay move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6: from (3,3), direction L, can move U, D, L (no R).\n\nL to (2,3)\n\nU to (3,4)\n\nD to (3,2)\n\n(2,3) free.\n\nMove to (2,3)\n\nTurn 7: from (2,3), direction L, can move U, D, L (no R).\n\nU to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, blocked.\n\nD to (2,2)\n\nL to (1,3)\n\nMove D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 8: from (2,2), direction D, can move L, R, D (no U).\n\nL to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, blocked.\n\nR to (3,2)\n\nD to (2,1) eat!\n\n(2,1) has food, so move to (2,1) and eat on turn 8.\n\nL=10-8=2, ok.\n\nPositions: head (2,1), body at (2,2), and previous tail at (2,3)? Before move: head (2,2), tail at (2,3)? Let's see.\n\nBefore turn 8: positions after turn 7 move to (2,2): from (2,3) moved to (2,2), so positions head (2,2), and body at previous positions.\n\nAfter turn 7 move to (2,2): previous head at (2,3), so body moved to (2,3), and tail to where? Earlier on turn 6, positions after move to (2,3): head (2,3), body at (3,3), etc.\n\nI think it's messy, but I can eat (2,1) on turn 8.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other foods.\n\nBut (4,6) and (1,6) are still there, with L=9, so by turn 9.\n\nFrom (2,1), on turn 8, after eating, length 3 or something.\n\nThen need to go north to (4,6) or (1,6).\n\nBut it's turn 8, and (1,6) must be eaten by turn 9, so only one turn left, but I am at (2,1), (1,6) is at distance |1-2| + |6-1| =1+5=6, too far, cannot reach in one turn.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) at |4-2| + |6-1| =2+5=7, far.\n\nSo I can only eat one of them if I can reach.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) on turn 8, I can move U to (2,2) but (2,2) may have body, or to (3,1) but y=1, x=3, but (3,1) free? But not food.\n\nThen turn 9 move to (3,2), etc, not reaching (4,6) or (1,6) in time.\n\nSo I miss those foods.\n\nTherefore, to eat all, I need to get the far foods first.\n\nPerhaps start with U to (3,5), then go to (1,6) quickly.\n\nTurn 1: U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 3: U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 4: L to (1,6) eat.\n\nOn turn 4, eat (1,6), length 2.\n\nThen from (1,6), go to (2,1) or to (4,6).\n\n(2,1) must be eaten by turn 9, so I have time.\n\nFrom (1,6), on turn 4, positions head (1,6), body at (2,6) or wherever.\n\nAfter eating (1,6), head (1,6), body at (2,6) if I came from (2,6).\n\nThen turn 5: move D to (1,5) (only choice, as before)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (2,3) (since D to (1,2) blocked)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 10: move L to (2,1) but on turn 10, (2,1) L=10-10=0, gone, so cannot eat.\n\nOn turn 9, I am at (2,2), can move D to (2,1) if possible.\n\nFrom (2,2), on turn 9, move D to (2,1), but (2,1) may be present if L=1 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, L=10-9=1, so can be eaten.\n\nMove to (2,1) and eat.\n\nSo on turn 9, eat (2,1).\n\nThen I have (4,6) and (5,4) with L=9 and 10, so I can go to them.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) after eating, go to (5,4) via (3,1) but (5,1) obstacle, etc.\n\nBut (4,6) L=9, at turn 10 L=0, gone, so I need to eat it by turn 9.\n\nBut on turn 9 I am at (2,1) eating, so cannot reach (4,6) by turn 9.\n\nDistance too far.\n\nSo I miss (4,6).\n\nIf after eating (1,6) on turn 4, I go to (4,6) first.\n\nFrom (1,6) turn 4, move D to (1,5)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (2,5)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 7: move U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (4,6) eat.\n\nOn turn 8, eat (4,6), L=10-8=2 for (4,6)? Initial L=9, at turn 8 L=9-7=2, yes.\n\nThen (5,4) can be eaten later.\n\nFrom (4,6) on turn 8, I can go to (5,4) via (4,5) to (5,5) to (5,4), but (5,4) has food.\n\nTurn 9: from (4,6) move D to (4,5) (assuming direction after eating is U, but U blocked, so I can move L or R, say L to (3,6), then turn 10 to (4,6) but not, or from (4,6) move R to (5,6), then turn 9 move D to (5,5), turn 10 move D to (5,4) eat on turn 10, L=11-10=1 for (5,4), ok.\n\nBut I missed (2,1) in this case.\n\nSo in all cases, with the obstacles, it's hard to eat all four within the life spans.\n\nBut (2,1) and (1,6) have life span 9, (4,6) 9, (5,4) 10.\n\nThe critical one is (2,1) with turn 9 deadline.\n\nFrom start, the shortest path to (2,1) is at least 4 moves, as earlier, but with direction constraint, it might be more.\n\nFrom (3,4), to reach (2,1): need to go down and left, but cannot move D immediately.\n\nMove U to (3,5), then L to (2,5), then D to (2,4) blocked, so must go to (1,5) or (2,6), then down.\n\nMin moves to (2,1): e.g., (3,4)-U-(3,5)-L-(2,5)-L-(1,5)-D-(1,4)-D-(1,3)-R-(2,3)-D-(2,2)-L-(2,1)? But (2,2) to (2,1) is D, not L.\n\n(2,2) to (2,1) is down.\n\nBut from (2,3) to (2,2) D, then to (2,1) D.\n\nBut on turn 8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,4) R to (4,4), then D to (4,3), L to (3,3), L to (2,3), D to (2,2), D to (2,1), 6 moves.\n\nSo not faster.\n\nPerhaps I can only eat three foods.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat the three that are easier.\n\nFor example, (5,4), (4,6), and (1,6) can be eaten as in the first path, and (2,1) missed.\n\nOr (5,4), (4,6), and (2,1) if I go down early.\n\nBut in the down path, I might not get (1,6).\n\nSince the snake is short, and to avoid risk, but no immediate risk.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 1, move U to (3,5), then turn 2 move R to (4,5), turn 3 move U to (4,6) eat, length 2.\n\nThen turn 4 move L to (3,6), turn 5 move L to (2,6), turn 6 move L to (1,6) eat, length 3.\n\nThen turn 7 move D to (1,5), etc, but (2,1) far.\n\nOr after (4,6), go to (5,4).\n\nTurn 4 from (4,6) move R to (5,6), turn 5 move D to (5,5), turn 6 move D to (5,4) eat, turn 6.\n\nThen from (5,4), go to (2,1) but hard.\n\nSo I think for this state, the best is to eat (5,4), (4,6), and (1,6), and forget about (2,1) for now.\n\nThen the sequence is as first.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I had turn 1 R, turn 2 R eat (5,4), turn 3 L to (4,4), turn 4 U to (4,5), turn 5 U to (4,6) eat, turn 6 L to (3,6), turn 7 L to (2,6), turn 8 L to (1,6) eat.\n\nThen on turn 9, from (1,6) move D to (1,5), and so on, but no more food, so survive.\n\nScore 3.\n\nIf I eat (2,1) first, I might get only 2 or 3, but likely 2 if I miss others.\n\nSo 3 is better.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", but for the answer format, it says to output actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but how many? It doesn't specify.\n\nLook: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1 Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nIt has dots, so probably for several turns, perhaps until a certain point or as per plan.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 turns of actions.\n\nIn my plan, I have up to turn 8.\n\nBut for survival, after eating, I can just move safely.\n\nAlso, for turn 1, I need to choose between U and R.\n\nIn the sequence above, I chose R first to get (5,4) quickly.\n\nBut let's confirm if U is better.\n\nTurn 1 move U to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 2 move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 3 move U to (4,6) eat\n\nThen I can go to (5,4) as above.\n\nTurn 4 move R to (5,6) (from (4,6) direction U, move R to (5,6))\n\nTurn 5 move D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 6 move D to (5,4) eat\n\nThen I have (1,6) to eat, but on turn 6, (1,6) L=10-6=4, so can be eaten later.\n\nFrom (5,4), on turn 6, positions head (5,4), body at (5,5), (5,6)? After eating (5,4), head (5,4), body at (5,5) and previous.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) on turn 6, eat, so head (5,4), body at previous head position (5,5), and before that (5,6), so positions [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6)] if I came from (5,5).\n\nThen turn 7: from (5,4), direction D (since I moved D to it), can move L, R, D (no U).\n\nL to (4,4), R to (6,4) blocked, D to (5,3)\n\nSo move L to (4,4) or D to (5,3).\n\nSay move L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 8 move L to (3,4), turn 9 move U to (3,5), turn 10 move U to (3,6), turn 11 move L to (2,6), turn 12 move L to (1,6) but on turn 12, (1,6) L=10-12= -2, gone long ago.\n\nAt turn 7, (1,6) L=10-7=3, so at turn 10 L=0, gone.\n\nTo reach (1,6) from (5,4) on turn 6, it takes many turns, e.g., to (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), 6 moves, turn 12, too late.\n\nFrom (5,4) go directly to (1,6) via left, but same issue.\n\nSo I can only eat (4,6) and (5,4), and not (1,6) if I go this way.\n\nBy going to (1,6) first, I can eat it, but miss (5,4) or (2,1).\n\nSo the first plan with R first allows eating (5,4), (4,6), (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, with U first, I can eat (4,6), then (1,6), but (5,4) might be missed if I go to (1,6) first.\n\nBut with U first, turn 1 U, turn 2 to (4,5), turn 3 U to (4,6) eat, then turn 4 L to (3,6), turn 5 L to (2,6), turn 6 L to (1,6) eat, then I have (5,4) to eat, but far, and (2,1) not eaten.\n\nSo score 2 or 3 if I can eat (5,4) later.\n\nBut (5,4) L=10, at turn 10 L=1, so can be eaten on turn 10.\n\nFrom (1,6) on turn 6, positions head (1,6), body at (2,6), (3,6), etc.\n\nMove D to (1,5) turn 7, then R to (2,5) turn 8, R to (3,5) turn 9, R to (4,5) turn 10, then D to (4,4) or to (5,5), but (5,4) at (5,4), from (4,5) move R to (5,5) turn 11, then D to (5,4) turn 12, L=0, gone.\n\nOn turn 10, at (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), but not to (5,4) directly.\n\nSo cannot eat (5,4) in time.\n\nThus, with U first, I eat only two foods: (4,6) and (1,6).\n\nWith R first, I eat three: (5,4), (4,6), (1,6).\n\nSo better to move R first.\n\nTherefore, for turn 1, action R.\n\nThen the sequence as before.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to provide actions for several turns.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTurn 1: R (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 2: R (to (5,4), eat)\n\nTurn 3: L (to (4,4), safe)\n\nTurn 4: U (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 5: U (to (4,6), eat)\n\nTurn 6: L (to (3,6))\n\nTurn 7: L (to (2,6))\n\nTurn 8: L (to (1,6), eat)\n\nAfter that, to survive, I can move D to (1,5) on turn 9, etc., but no more food, so for the output, perhaps up to turn 8 or 10.\n\nSince the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and turn 1 to 5 covers 5 turns, but I have more.\n\nI can provide until the actions I planned.\n\nIn the box, I should write the actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 3, I moved L to (4,4), which is safe, as per rule.\n\nIf I moved U or D from (5,4), I might not go directly to (4,6), but in this case it's fine.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must plan multiple turns ahead, considering food life spans, obstacles, and movement constraints. The current state (turn 1) has the snake at position (3,4) with direction Up. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Food items are at (1,6) with value 1 and life span 9, (2,1) with value 1 and life span 9, (4,6) with value 1 and life span 9, and (5,4) with value 1 and life span 10. All food is positive, so eating increases the snake's length by 1.\n\n### Key Considerations for Planning:\n- **Immediate Actions (Turn 1)**: From (3,4), possible moves are Up (U) to (3,5), Left (L) to (2,4), or Right (R) to (4,4). However, L to (2,4) is blocked by an obstacle, leaving U or R. Moving R to (4,4) allows quicker access to (5,4) (distance 1) compared to U, which is farther from high-value targets. (5,4) has a longer life span (10) but is closer, enabling early growth and better positioning for other foods.\n- **Food Prioritization**: (2,1) has the shortest effective life (must be eaten by turn 9), but it is far from the start and blocked by obstacles, making it risky to prioritize. (5,4) is close and can be eaten by turn 2, then (4,6) by turn 5, and (1,6) by turn 8, scoring 3 points. Attempting (2,1) may cause missing other foods due to distance and life spans.\n- **Obstacle and Path Planning**: Internal obstacles block direct paths, especially to (2,1). A sequence targeting (5,4), then (4,6), then (1,6) avoids obstacles and uses safe routes. After eating, movements must avoid walls and body collisions. With the snake growing, tail movement must be considered to prevent collisions (e.g., moving to the tail cell is safe only if the tail moves away).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating available food, the snake should move to open areas to avoid dead-ends. With all food eaten or expired by turn 9, the focus shifts to surviving in the central area (e.g., around (3,3) to (5,5)).\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: The sequence below eats (5,4) on turn 2, (4,6) on turn 5, and (1,6) on turn 8, scoring 3 points. (2,1) is not eaten due to life span and path constraints but this maximizes score. Actions avoid reverse moves and ensure no collisions.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 1 to 10):\n- **Turn 1 (t1=1)**: Move Right (R) to (4,4). Rationale: Positions the snake closer to (5,4) for immediate eating. Avoids U, which delays access to high-value food.\n- **Turn 2 (t1+1=2)**: Move Right (R) to (5,4) and eat. Snake grows to length 2: head at (5,4), body at (4,4). Direction now Right.\n- **Turn 3 (t1+2=3)**: Move Left (L) to (4,4). Rationale: Safe move to tail cell (tail moves to (5,4)), avoiding collision. Positions for northward move to (4,6). Direction now Left.\n- **Turn 4 (t1+3=4)**: Move Up (U) to (4,5). Rationale: Advances toward (4,6). No food, so snake moves: head to (4,5), tail to (4,4). Direction now Up.\n- **Turn 5 (t1+4=5)**: Move Up (U) to (4,6) and eat. Snake grows to length 3: head at (4,6), body at (4,5) and (4,4). Direction now Up.\n- **Turn 6 (t1+5=6)**: Move Left (L) to (3,6). Rationale: Avoids top wall (y=7) and moves toward (1,6). No food, so snake moves: head to (3,6), body to (4,6) and (4,5). Direction now Left.\n- **Turn 7 (t1+6=7)**: Move Left (L) to (2,6). Rationale: Continues path to (1,6). No food, so snake moves: head to (2,6), body to (3,6) and (4,6). Direction now Left.\n- **Turn 8 (t1+7=8)**: Move Left (L) to (1,6) and eat. Snake grows to length 4: head at (1,6), body at (2,6), (3,6), and (4,6). Direction now Left.\n- **Turn 9 (t1+8=9)**: Move Down (D) to (1,5). Rationale: Only safe move (left and up blocked by walls; right not allowed due to no instant reverse). Positions for potential southward movement. No food, so snake moves: head to (1,5), body to (1,6), (2,6), and (3,6). Direction now Down.\n- **Turn 10 (t1+9=10)**: Move Right (R) to (2,5). Rationale: Moves away from left wall and avoids obstacles. Opens path to central area for survival. No food, so snake moves accordingly.\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Score Maximized**: Eats 3 positive foods (turns 2, 5, 8) for a score of 3. (2,1) is not eaten due to low life span (expires after turn 9) and high risk from obstacles (e.g., (1,2) and (2,4)).\n- **Survival Focus**: After turn 8, the snake moves to open cells (e.g., (2,5)) to avoid walls and body collisions. With no food left after turn 9, the snake can safely navigate the center (e.g., looping around (3,3) to (5,5)).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: No negative food present. Movements avoid instant reverses and obstacles. Tail reward danger is irrelevant here (snake too short when eating).\n- **Life Span Handling**: (5,4) eaten on turn 2 (life span 10), (4,6) on turn 5 (life span 9), and (1,6) on turn 8 (life span 9), all within life spans. (2,1) expires after turn 9 but is inaccessible by then.\n- **5+ Turn Foresight**: The plan covers 10 turns, ensuring the snake is positioned for survival beyond the food-rich phase.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ R} }",

        "step": 2,
        "score": 1,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 2, and the snake is on a grid with walls. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There are also internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2).\n\nThe snake positions are given as [(4,4)]. That means the snake has only one segment, which is the head. So, the snake is just starting, and its length is 1. The head direction is right (R), so it's moving to the right.\n\nNow, food positions with value and life span:\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 8\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 8\n\n- (4,6) with value 1, life span 8\n\n- (5,4) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll food has positive value +1, since value is 1, and it says \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive food. Negative food would have -1, but here all are +1, so all are positive food. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so I need to consider how long each food will last.\n\nCurrent turn is 2, so for food at (1,6), life span 8, it will disappear after turn 2 + 8 - 1? Let me clarify the life span.\n\nIt says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for a food with life span N, it appears at turn t, and disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let's think carefully.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". I think it means that at the turn it spawns, the countdown is N, and it decreases by 1 each turn until it reaches 0, and when countdown is 0, it disappears before the next turn or something. But the input gives life span directly.\n\nIn the state, for each food, it's given with life_span, which is the remaining life at the start of this turn.\n\nLet me read the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: (1,6,8,1)\" – the format is (x,y, life_span, value), so life_span is given as 8 for (1,6), meaning at turn 2, this food has 8 turns left before it disappears. Since countdown decreases every turn, including current, after turn 2, it will have 7 left, and so on, until it reaches 0, and it disappears after the turn when countdown becomes 0.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after N turns\" means after N turns from now, it will be gone. So if life_span is N at turn t, it will be available until turn t + N - 1, and disappear at turn t + N.\n\nBut to simplify, since countdown decreases each turn, at the start of turn t, life_span is L, then after this turn (turn t), life_span becomes L-1, and so on. When life_span reaches 0, after the turn it is consumed or at the end of the turn, it disappears.\n\nFor movement, I need to choose actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n\nThe snake head is at (4,4), direction R, so it's moving right. Since it's the only segment, the tail is also at (4,4).\n\nNow, possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but I cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) on the next turn. But since it's turn 2, and I'm choosing action for turn 2, I can choose any direction except opposite to current, which is L.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so for turn 2 action, I cannot choose L because it's instant reverse. So possible actions for turn 2: U, D, R (not L).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, the direction depends on what I choose now.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so I cannot go to those cells. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked.\n\nSnake is at (4,4), which is empty now, but if it moves, it will leave that cell.\n\nSince snake is only head, no body to worry about yet, except when it eats food and grows.\n\nFood can be under snake body, but here snake has only one cell, so no food under it. Food positions are given, all at different places: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6), (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is at the same position as the snake head? Snake is at (4,4), food at (5,4), which is adjacent to the right.\n\n(5,4) is one cell to the right of (4,4).\n\nBut (5,4) has food with value 1, life span 9.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles include (6,4), which is two cells to the right of (4,4).\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls at borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,6): value 1, life 8\n\n- (2,1): value 1, life 8\n\n- (4,6): value 1, life 8\n\n- (5,4): value 1, life 9\n\n(5,4) is directly to the right of snake head. If I move right to (5,4), I eat the food there.\n\nSince snake length is 1, eating food will make it grow to length 2. So after eating, the head moves to (5,4), and a new tail is added at the previous position, but since it was only head, the tail will be at (4,4) after move.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAt turn 2, snake position: [(4,4)]\n\nIf I move R to (5,4), which has food. So I eat the food, gain +1, snake grows. New positions: head at (5,4), tail at (4,4). So snake becomes [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nThen, since I ate food, the food at (5,4) is consumed and removed.\n\nNow, other food is still there.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is a danger with tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating that food kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, after eating, tail is at (4,4), head at (5,4), so they are adjacent horizontally.\n\nNow, (4,4) has no food, it was the old position, but food was at (5,4) which is eaten.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), the cell (4,4) is empty now, since tail is there but when snake moves, the tail moves only if not growing, but here I grew, so tail stays at (4,4) for now.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves, head moves to new position, if no food, tail moves forward, so length same. If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so new segment added at tail position, length increases.\n\nIn this case, from single segment: head at (4,4). Move to (5,4), which has food, so head now at (5,4), and new tail added at (4,4), so snake is [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nNow, at this point, the tail is at (4,4), head at (5,4). They are adjacent.\n\nNow, the tail cell (4,4) does not have food; it's part of the snake body.\n\nFood is only at specific positions; (4,4) has no food listed, so it's empty.\n\nNow, if I were to move back to (4,4), that would be moving left to tail, which would cause collision because head touches body.\n\nBut in this case, after moving to (5,4), I can move U, D, or R? (5,4) position.\n\nCurrent head direction after moving R is R.\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,5)\n\n- D: to (5,3)\n\n- R: to (6,4)\n\n- L: to (4,4) but (4,4) is the tail, so moving there would cause head to touch body, collision, death.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite, but current direction is R, so moving L is opposite and also to body cell.\n\nFirst, moving to (4,4) is invalid because it's occupied by body.\n\nNow, (6,4) is an internal obstacle, so I cannot move there.\n\n(6,4) is listed in internal obstacles, so it's a wall, cannot move to.\n\nSo from (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,5): is that valid? (5,5) is not border, not obstacle, should be empty.\n\n- D to (5,3): similarly, should be empty.\n\n- R to (6,4): but (6,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\n- L to (4,4): body, cannot.\n\nSo only U or D possible from (5,4) after eating.\n\nBut I need to consider if I should eat that food at (5,4) now.\n\nIt might not be the best move because after eating, I'm trapped with only two moves, and I have to go U or D.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,6), which is close, at (4,6), same x as start, y+2.\n\nAnd (1,6) and (2,1), etc.\n\nMoreover, life span: (5,4) has life 9, so it will last until turn 2 + 9 = turn 11, since at turn 2, life span 9, so after turn 2, life 8, then 7, ..., down to 0 at turn 11, disappears after turn 11? Let's define.\n\nAt start of turn t=2, life span L=9 for (5,4).\n\nAfter turn 2, when I move, if I eat it, it's gone.\n\nIf not, after turn 2, life span decreases to 8 for turn 3.\n\nGenerally, at start of turn, life span is given, and after each turn, it decreases by 1, so at start of turn 3, it would be 8 for this food if not eaten.\n\nAnd it disappears when life span reaches 0, so at start of turn when life span 0, it's not there.\n\nFor (5,4), life span 9 at turn 2, so it will be available from turn 2 to turn 10 (since at turn 10 start, life span 1, after turn 10, life 0, gone at turn 11).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(4,6) has life span 8 at turn 2, so available turns 2 to 9.\n\n(1,6) life 8, turns 2 to 9.\n\n(2,1) life 8, turns 2 to 9.\n\nNow back to decision.\n\nAt (4,4), I can move R to (5,4) and eat, or move U, D, or since direction R, I can only move U, D, R (not L).\n\nPossible actions for turn 2: U, D, R.\n\nIf I move R to (5,4), I eat food, snake grows to length 2, positions: head (5,4), tail (4,4). Then I must move U or D next, since R is blocked by obstacle (6,4), and L is back to tail.\n\nIf I move U from (4,4) to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) should be empty, no food, no obstacle.\n\nThen snake still length 1, head at (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (4,3), or R to (5,4) as above.\n\nOr if move U to (4,5).\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nSimilarly for D.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nSince all food is positive, I want to eat as much as possible, but avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's list all reachable food.\n\nFood at (4,6): from (4,4), I can go up twice: to (4,5) then to (4,6), so in two moves, I can eat it, but only if I move up first.\n\nIf I move U on turn 2 to (4,5), then on turn 3, I can move U to (4,6), which has food, so I eat it on turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,6): that's farther, need to go left and up.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (1,2), but (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, so not affected directly.\n\nAlso, (2,1) is at bottom left.\n\n(5,4) is immediate right.\n\nBut if I eat (5,4) now, I might get stuck.\n\nAfter eating (5,4), snake at (5,4) and (4,4), head at (5,4), must move U or D.\n\nSay move U to (5,5).\n\nThen snake: head (5,5), tail (4,4)? When I move head from (5,4) to (5,5), since no food at (5,5), tail moves from (4,4) to where? Standard: head moves to new cell, tail moves forward, so if not growing, tail is removed from old position.\n\nAfter eating at (5,4) on turn 2, positions: head (5,4), tail (4,4)\n\nOn turn 3, I move head to, say, (5,5). (5,5) has no food, so head moves to (5,5), tail moves to (5,4)? Let's see.\n\nPrevious positions: [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nHead moves to (5,5), which is new cell. Since no food eaten, tail moves forward, so the tail segment at (4,4) is removed, and the segment that was at (5,4) becomes the new tail? No.\n\nThe snake body: segments are connected. When head moves to a new cell, the tail end moves forward one cell if not growing.\n\nSo from [(5,4), (4,4)], head moves to (5,5). So new head position (5,5), and the body segment at (5,4) becomes the tail, and the old tail (4,4) is removed. So new positions: [(5,5), (5,4)]\n\nSimilarly, if I moved D to (5,3), it would be [(5,3), (5,4)]\n\nThen from there, I can move further.\n\nBut at (5,4), after moving U to (5,5), I have head at (5,5), tail at (5,4).\n\nNow, food at (4,6) is still there, at (4,6).\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move L to (4,5), then U to (4,6) to eat, but (4,6) has food.\n\nFrom (5,5), move L to (4,5): is (4,5) occupied? No, after turn 3, tail is at (5,4), so (4,5) is free.\n\nThen on turn 4, from (4,5), move U to (4,6) to eat food.\n\nBut I need to consider if that's possible.\n\nSimilarly, if I didn't eat (5,4) first, I could go directly to (4,6).\n\nFor example, on turn 2, move U to (4,5), no food, snake still length 1, head at (4,5).\n\nThen on turn 3, move U to (4,6), eat food, snake grows to length 2: head (4,6), tail (4,5).\n\nThen from there, I can move to other food.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options.\n\nFirst, if I eat (5,4) on turn 2:\n\n- Turn 2: move R to (5,4), eat food, score +1, snake: [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\n- Turn 3: must move U or D, say U to (5,5), no food, snake: [(5,5), (5,4)]  (tail moved)\n\n- Turn 4: from (5,5), I can move L to (4,5), no food, snake: head (4,5), tail (5,5)? Positions: after move, head to (4,5), tail from (5,4) to? Previous: [(5,5), (5,4)], head to (4,5), so new head (4,5), and body (5,5) becomes tail, old tail (5,4) removed. So [(4,5), (5,5)]\n\n- Turn 5: from (4,5), move U to (4,6), which has food, eat it, snake grows: head to (4,6), tail stays at (5,5), new segment, so snake [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI ate two food: (5,4) and (4,6).\n\nIf I don't eat (5,4) first, and go for (4,6):\n\n- Turn 2: move U to (4,5), no food, snake still [(4,5)] (length 1)\n\n- Turn 3: move U to (4,6), eat food, score +1, snake: head (4,6), tail (4,5)  (length 2)\n\n- Turn 4: from (4,6), I can move U, D, L, R, but direction is U now? After moving U to (4,6), head direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,7), but y=7 is border wall, so cannot, since walls at y=7.\n\nD to (4,5), but (4,5) is the tail, so moving there would be body collision.\n\nL to (3,6), or R to (5,6).\n\nNow, (3,6) and (5,6) should be free.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite, but current direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nSo possible: U (but wall, invalid), D (opposite and to body, invalid), so only L or R.\n\nMove L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\nSay move R to (5,6).\n\nThen no food, snake: head (5,6), tail moves to (4,6), so [(5,6), (4,6)]\n\nThen from there, I can go to other food.\n\nBut I have the food at (5,4) which is still there, at (5,4).\n\nFrom (5,6), I can move D to (5,5), then D to (5,4), but (5,4) has food, but when I move to (5,4), if tail is not adjacent, it should be ok.\n\nBut let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 4: snake at [(5,6), (4,6)]\n\nTurn 5: move D to (5,5), no food, snake: head (5,5), tail (5,6)? Previous: [(5,6), (4,6)], head to (5,5), so new head (5,5), body (5,6) becomes tail, old tail (4,6) removed. So [(5,5), (5,6)]\n\nTurn 6: move D to (5,4), which has food, eat it, snake grows: head (5,4), tail stays at (5,6), new segment, so [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]\n\nBut (5,4) has obstacle? No, (6,4) is obstacle, but (5,4) is fine, and food was there.\n\nIn this case, I ate (4,6) on turn 3 and (5,4) on turn 6.\n\nCompared to first approach where I ate (5,4) on turn 2 and (4,6) on turn 5.\n\nIn terms of turns, eating (4,6) first might be better because I can get it earlier, but both sequences get both food by turn 6 or so.\n\nBut in first approach, when I ate (5,4) first, I was stuck for a move, but it worked.\n\nNow, there are other food: (1,6) and (2,1).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is top-left, y=6, x=1.\n\nFrom current position, to go to (1,6), I need to go left and up, but from (4,4), to (1,6), I need to decrease x by 3, increase y by 2.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (1,2), but (1,6) is different, so not directly blocking, but the path might be affected.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is at bottom-left.\n\nAlso, walls and obstacles.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger. But since no food under tail yet, it might not be an issue now.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat multiple food safely.\n\nSince the grid is small, I should consider the available moves.\n\nFirst, at turn 2, position (4,4), direction R.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Move R to (5,4): eat food immediately, grow to length 2, but then only U/D moves possible, and I have to leave that area.\n\n- Move U to (4,5): then I can go to (4,6) next turn to eat.\n\n- Move D to (4,3): then I can go down, but not much food down, except (2,1) is at (2,1), which is down-left.\n\n(4,3) is empty, then I can go to (3,3), (2,3), etc. to reach (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) has life span 8, so it will last until turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, all food has life at least 8, except (5,4) has 9.\n\nLife spans: all 8 or 9, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I should prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\n(4,6) is very close, only one up move away if I go up first.\n\n(5,4) is adjacent right.\n\nBut if I eat (5,4) first, I might block the path to (4,6) temporarily, but I can still reach it as in the sequence above.\n\nIf I eat (4,6) first, I can then go to (5,4) later.\n\nIn terms of score, both give same, but eating (4,6) first might be safer because after eating, I have more freedom to move.\n\nIf I eat (5,4) first, I'm at (5,4) with tail at (4,4), and I can only move U or D, which might lead to dead ends if not careful.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (5,5), then to (5,6), but (5,6) is not wall, but from there I can go left to (4,6) or right to (6,6), but (6,6) might be ok, but there is obstacle at (6,4), but (6,6) is different.\n\ny=6, x=6, which is not obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (6,6) is free.\n\nBut borders at x=7,y=7, so (6,6) is fine.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (4,6) from (5,5) by moving left.\n\nBut let's think about the area around (5,4).\n\n(5,4) has obstacle at (6,4) to the right, so I cannot go right.\n\nAbove (5,5), (5,6), etc.\n\nBelow (5,3), (5,2), but (5,1) is obstacle, so (5,2) might be accessible, but (5,1) is wall, so (5,2) is free, but to the south.\n\nAlso, (4,4) is tail if I ate.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's manageable.\n\nNow, another food is (1,6), at (1,6).\n\nTo reach (1,6) from (4,4), I need to go left to x=1 and up to y=6.\n\nPath: for example, from (4,4) to (3,4), but (2,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly left on x.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle, so I cannot go to (2,4).\n\nSo to go left, I need to go around.\n\nFor example, go up to (4,5), then left to (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), then up to (1,6).\n\n(1,5) to (1,6) should be fine, y=6 not wall.\n\nSimilarly, I could go down first, but (2,1) is low, so up might be better.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1), I can go down-left.\n\nBut let's list the food positions:\n\n- (1,6): top-left\n\n- (2,1): bottom-left\n\n- (4,6): top-middle\n\n- (5,4): right-middle\n\n(4,6) and (5,4) are both close to start.\n\n(1,6) is farther, (2,1) even farther down.\n\nLife span all sufficient.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver, but since grid is small, and obstacles, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area around (5,4) is a bit constrained because to the right is wall at (6,4), so only up and down.\n\nIf I go down to (5,3), then I can go left to (4,3) or right but right is wall, or down to (5,2), then to (4,2) or (5,1) but (5,1) obstacle, so only left or down to (5,2), but (5,2) to (5,1) invalid, so from (5,2) I can go left to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut it might lead to less food.\n\nWhereas up, to (5,5), then to (5,6) or (4,5), etc., and (4,6) is there.\n\nSo probably better to go up after eating (5,4).\n\nBut to maximize, I should go for (4,6) first without eating (5,4), so I keep flexibility.\n\nLet's see the distance.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (4,6): Manhattan distance 2, I can be there on turn 3 if I move U twice.\n\nTo (5,4): distance 1, on turn 2.\n\nTo (1,6): distance |4-1| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5, so at least 5 moves.\n\nSimilarly to (2,1): |4-2| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo (4,6) and (5,4) are closer.\n\nNow, if I go for (4,6) first:\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,5) — no food\n\nTurn 3: move U to (4,6) — eat food, snake grows to length 2: head (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nNow on turn 3, after eating, head at (4,6), direction U.\n\nAs before, I can only move L or R, since U is wall (y=7), D is to tail or opposite.\n\nMove L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\nSay I move R to (5,6), no food, snake moves: head to (5,6), tail to (4,6), so [(5,6), (4,6)]\n\nNow, the food at (5,4) is still at (5,4), life span 9, so at turn 3, it has life span 8 left? At turn 2 start, life span 9, after turn 2, if not eaten, at turn 3 start, life span 8 for (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can move D to (5,5), no food, snake: head (5,5), tail (5,6) — positions: [(5,5), (5,6)] after move.\n\nThen turn 4: from (5,5), move D to (5,4), which has food, eat it, snake grows: head to (5,4), tail stays at (5,6), new segment at (5,5)? When head moves to (5,4), eats food, so tail does not move, new segment added at the previous tail position.\n\nPrevious positions: [(5,5), (5,6)] , head moves to (5,4), eats food, so head now (5,4), the body (5,5) becomes the new tail, and since grew, the old tail (5,6) is not removed, instead a new segment is added, so snake is [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]\n\nYes.\n\nNow, head at (5,4), which has obstacle to the right (6,4), and tail at (5,6), so I can move U or D, but U to (5,5) is body, cannot; D to (5,3) is possible.\n\nCurrent direction after moving D to (5,4) is D.\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,5): but (5,5) is body segment, collision\n\n- D to (5,3): free, I assume\n\n- L to (4,4): but (4,4) is not occupied now? After the moves, (4,4) is free, but is it?\n\nLet's track positions.\n\nOn turn 3: after moving to (5,6), snake at [(5,6), (4,6)]\n\nTurn 4: move to (5,5), no food, so head to (5,5), tail to (5,6)? Previous tail was at (4,6), but when head moves to (5,5), the segment at (5,6) becomes the new tail, and old tail (4,6) is removed. So snake is [(5,5), (5,6)]\n\nTurn 5: move to (5,4), eat food, so head to (5,4), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so the tail at (5,6) stays, and new segment added at the tail position? No.\n\nWhen food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the segment that was the tail remains, and a new segment is added behind it, but in terms of positions, the head moves to new cell, and the tail stays in place, so the snake grows by one cell.\n\nFrom positions [(5,5), (5,6)] , head moves to (5,4), eats food, so new head (5,4), and the body is now (5,5) and (5,6), with (5,6) still tail. So snake [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]\n\nYes.\n\nNow head at (5,4), tail at (5,6).\n\nPossible moves from (5,4): current direction D (since moved down).\n\n- U to (5,5): but (5,5) is body, collision\n\n- D to (5,3): should be free\n\n- L to (4,4): free? (4,4) is empty\n\n- R to (6,4): obstacle, cannot\n\nSo only D or L possible.\n\nBut U is body, so invalid; R invalid; so D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\nIf I move L to (4,4), that might be ok.\n\n(4,4) is free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other food.\n\nBut I have the food at (1,6) and (2,1) to consider.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate (4,6) on turn 3 and (5,4) on turn 5.\n\nScore 2 so far.\n\nNow, if I had not eaten (5,4) first, but went for (4,6) directly, I got the same in similar time.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat all four food.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,4), I am at (5,4) with body above, so I can move D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\nSay move L to (4,4) on turn 6.\n\nThen snake: head to (4,4), no food there, so tail moves: from [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6)], head to (4,4), no food, so tail moves forward: the tail at (5,6) is removed, and the segment at (5,5) becomes new tail, head at (4,4), so snake [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]? Positions: after move, head to (4,4), the body segments: the first body segment was (5,4), which moves to where the head was? No.\n\nPrevious positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6)] with head (5,4), tail (5,6)\n\nHead moves to (4,4), new cell, no food, so the tail moves: the tail segment at (5,6) is removed, and each body segment moves towards the head, so the segment at (5,5) moves to (5,4), and the segment at (5,4) moves to (4,4)? No.\n\nThe snake is a list: positions [head, body1, body2, ..., tail]\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, it is added to the front, and if no growth, the last cell (tail) is removed.\n\nSo here, from [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6)], head moves to (4,4), so new head (4,4), then body (5,4), (5,5), and tail (5,6) is removed, so new positions: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n\nYes.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go to other places.\n\nBut (4,4) has no food.\n\nNow, food at (1,6) and (2,1) are still available.\n\n(1,6) at (1,6), life span 8 at turn 2, so at turn 6, it has life span 8 - (6-2) = 4 left? Turn 2 start life 8, turn 3 start life 7, turn 4 start 6, turn 5 start 5, turn 6 start 4, so still 4 turns left.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) same.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go left to (3,4), but (2,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly to x=2 on y=4.\n\nI need to go around, say up or down.\n\nFor example, go up to (4,5), but (4,5) might be occupied? In current snake, after moving to (4,4), snake has (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), so (4,5) is free.\n\nFrom (4,4), move U to (4,5), no food, then to (4,6), but (4,6) had food but I already ate it on turn 3, so it's gone.\n\nFood at (4,6) was eaten, so not there.\n\nSo move to (3,5) or something to go towards (1,6).\n\nBut it's getting messy.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (5,4) at all, because it might trap me.\n\nFor example, if I go directly to (4,6) without eating (5,4), then from there I can go to (1,6) or other.\n\nLet's plan a path to eat multiple food.\n\nFirst, from start (4,4), move U to (4,5) on turn 2.\n\nThen turn 3, move U to (4,6), eat food, snake now [(4,6), (4,5)]\n\nThen turn 4, from (4,6), move L to (3,6) (since cannot U or D, only L or R), no food, snake: head (3,6), tail (4,6), so [(3,6), (4,6)]\n\nThen turn 5, from (3,6), I can move L to (2,6), or D to (3,5), or U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, or R to (4,6) body, invalid.\n\nCurrent direction after moving L to (3,6) is L.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (2,6), D to (3,5), U invalid, R invalid.\n\n(2,6) might be free.\n\nMove L to (2,6), no food, snake: head (2,6), tail (3,6)? Previous: [(3,6), (4,6)], head to (2,6), no food, so tail moves to (3,6), old tail (4,6) removed, so [(2,6), (3,6)]\n\nThen turn 6, from (2,6), move L to (1,6), which has food, eat it, snake grows: head (1,6), tail stays at (3,6), new segment, so [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nThen I have eaten (4,6) and (1,6).\n\nNow, the food at (5,4) is still there, but I am at (1,6), far away, and (5,4) has life span 9 at turn 2, at turn 6 start, life span 9 - (6-2) = 5 left, so available until turn 10 or so.\n\nBut from (1,6) to (5,4) is long way, and I have a longer snake, might be harder.\n\nAlso, (2,1) is there.\n\nBut (2,1) is at (2,1), from (1,6), I can go down, but there is obstacle at (1,2), so I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (1,6), move D to (1,5), then D to (1,4), then D to (1,3), but (1,2) is obstacle, so cannot go to (1,2), so from (1,3) I can move R to (2,3), then down to (2,2), then to (2,1) if possible.\n\n(2,1) is food position, and (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,1) is different.\n\n(2,1) should be accessible.\n\nBut it will take many turns.\n\nMoreover, the food at (2,1) has life span 8 at turn 2, at turn 6 start, life span 8-4=4, so only 4 turns left, might not reach in time.\n\nTurn 6 start, life span 4, so available until turn 9 start? At turn 6 start life span 4, after turn 6, life 3, turn 7 life 2, turn 8 life 1, turn 9 life 0, gone. So must be eaten by turn 8.\n\nFrom (1,6) at turn 6, to (2,1), distance |1-2| + |6-1| =1+5=6, so at least 6 moves, but by turn 8, I can make 3 moves from turn 6 to 8? Turn 6: at (1,6), after eating, turn 7,8,9 actions.\n\nTurn 6: I am at (1,6) after eating, so on turn 7, I can start moving.\n\nTurn 7: move, say, D to (1,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (1,3) — but (1,3) to (1,2) is blocked by obstacle at (1,2), so cannot go down to (1,2), so I have to go right or something.\n\nFrom (1,4), I can move R to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle, so cell (2,4) is wall.\n\nSo from (1,4), I can move to (1,3) or (0,4) but x=0 wall, or (1,5) back, or (2,4) invalid.\n\nFrom (1,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (1,5)\n\n- D to (1,3) — (1,3) should be free\n\n- L to (0,4) wall, invalid\n\n- R to (2,4) obstacle, invalid\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,3), same thing, only U or D, cannot go right because (2,3) might be free, but to go to (2,1), I need to go to x=2.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can move R to (2,3), since (2,4) is obstacle but (2,3) is different cell.\n\n(2,3) is not listed as obstacle, so it should be free.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2), then D to (2,1), which has food.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach in time.\n\nFrom turn 6: at (1,6) with snake length 3.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (1,5), no food, snake moves: head to (1,5), tail to (2,6)? Previous: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6)], head to (1,5), no food, so tail moves: remove (3,6), so [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]? Positions: new head (1,5), then body (1,6), (2,6), tail (3,6) removed. So [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (1,4), no food, snake: head to (1,4), tail to (1,6)? Previous tail at (2,6), removed, so body moves: (1,5) to (1,5)? New head (1,4), then body (1,5), (1,6), and tail (2,6) removed. So [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nTurn 9: move D to (1,3), no food, snake: head to (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), tail (1,6) removed. So [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\nBut (2,1) food is at (2,1), and I need to eat it by turn 8, but turn 9 I am at (1,3), and (2,1) is not eaten.\n\nLife span: at turn 8 start, for (2,1), life span at turn 2 is 8, turn 3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, turn6:4, turn7:3, turn8:2, turn9:1, so at turn 9 start, life span 1, after turn 9, it disappears, so I can eat it on turn 9 if I reach.\n\nOn turn 9, I am at (1,3), I can move to (2,3) or to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nMove R to (2,3), no food there, but I can move.\n\nThen on turn 10, move D to (2,2), etc, but (2,1) might be gone.\n\nAt turn 9, if I move to (2,3), I don't eat (2,1), and on turn 10, (2,1) is gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,1) in this path because it times out.\n\nSimilarly, in the first approach, if I ate (5,4) and (4,6) first, I might miss (2,1) or (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) I could eat as in the second sequence.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat the closer food first and avoid going to dead ends.\n\n(5,4) is risky because after eating, I am constrained.\n\nWhereas (4,6) is safer to eat first.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,6) as above, and eat it by turn 6.\n\nThen I have two food, and (5,4) is still there, but I am far, and (2,1) might be eaten if I go directly, but from (4,6), if I go left to (1,6), I can eat it, but (2,1) is not eaten.\n\nIf from (4,6) after eating, I go down instead of left.\n\nFor example, on turn 4, from (4,6) move L to (3,6), then on turn 5 move D to (3,5), etc, to go to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at (2,1), and (2,4) is obstacle, so I need to go to y=1.\n\nFrom (3,5), move D to (3,4), but (2,4) obstacle, so (3,4) is free? (3,4) not obstacle.\n\nThen from (3,4), move L to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, cannot, so move D to (3,3), then L to (2,3), D to (2,2), D to (2,1).\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nFrom turn 3 at (4,6), turn 4 to (3,6), turn 5 to (3,5), turn 6 to (3,4), turn 7 to (3,3), turn 8 to (2,3), turn 9 to (2,2), turn 10 to (2,1), but life span of (2,1) at turn 2 is 8, so at turn 10 start life span 8-8=0, gone, so not available on turn 10.\n\nMust eat by turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I can be at (2,1) if I move directly.\n\nFrom turn 3: at (4,6)\n\nTurn 4: move L to (3,6)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 8: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (2,2) or directly to (2,1)? From (2,3) to (2,2), then to (2,1).\n\nOn turn 9, move to (2,2), not eating, then turn 10 to (2,1) but food gone.\n\nOn turn 9, from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2), or directly to (2,1) if possible, but (2,1) is at y=1, x=2, from (2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1), so at turn 9, move to (2,2), not food, turn 10 to (2,1) but food gone.\n\nIf I move directly from (2,3) to (2,1), not adjacent, can only move one cell per turn.\n\nSo impossible to eat (2,1) if I go for (1,6) first or if I delay.\n\nThe only way to eat (2,1) is to go for it early.\n\nFor example, from start (4,4), on turn 2 move D to (4,3), then turn 3 move D to (4,2), turn 4 move L to (3,2), turn 5 move L to (2,2), turn 6 move D to (2,1), eat.\n\nBut (2,1) life span, at turn 6, life span 8-4=4, so available.\n\nThen I can eat it on turn 6.\n\nSimilarly, from there, I can go to other food.\n\nBut (4,6) and (1,6) might time out.\n\n(4,6) life span 8 at turn 2, turn 6 start life 8-4=4, turn 7,8,9 available, but from (2,1) to (4,6) is far, |2-4| + |1-6| =2+5=7 moves, not possible in 4 turns.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) same.\n\nSo I can eat at most two of the far food, but not all four because of time and distance.\n\n(5,4) is closer, but has longer life.\n\nPrioritize (4,6) and (2,1) or something.\n\nBut (2,1) and (4,6) are on opposite sides.\n\nThe best is to eat (4,6) and (5,4) quickly, then if possible one more.\n\nFor example, from start, eat (4,6) on turn 3 as before.\n\nThen from there, instead of going left to (1,6), go down to reach (2,1), but as above, it takes too long, and (2,1) times out.\n\nFrom (4,6) on turn 3, to (2,1): min distance  |4-2| + |6-1| =2+5=7, and at turn 3, (2,1) life span at turn 3 start is 7, so available until turn 10, but to reach on turn 3+7=10, can eat on turn 10 if life span 1 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10 start life span 1, can be eaten on turn 10.\n\nSo possible, but the snake might be in the way.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nSince the grid has obstacles, it might be hard to reach (2,1) from north.\n\nPerhaps I should ignore (2,1) and focus on the top food.\n\n(1,6) can be eaten if I go left from (4,6).\n\nBut in that case, I can eat (4,6), (1,6), and (5,4) if I go back, but (5,4) has life 9, so at turn 6, after eating (1,6), I can try to go to (5,4).\n\nFrom (1,6) at turn 6, to (5,4), distance |1-5| + |6-4| =4+2=6, and life span of (5,4) at turn 6 start is 9-4=5, so available until turn 10, so I can reach by turn 6+6=12, but turn 12 is too late, life span 5 at turn 6, turn 7:4, turn8:3, turn9:2, turn10:1, turn11:0 gone, so must eat by turn 10.\n\nFrom turn 6 to turn 10, I have 5 moves (turn 7,8,9,10,11? Actions on turn 7 to 10).\n\nTurn 6: at (1,6)\n\nTurn 7: move to, say, (1,5) or (2,6)\n\nTurn 8: move etc.\n\nMin distance 6, so with 4 moves from turn 7 to 10, I can move 4 cells, not enough to reach (5,4) from (1,6) in 4 moves, since Manhattan distance 6.\n\nSo impossible to eat (5,4) after eating (1,6) early.\n\nSimilarly, only way to eat (5,4) is to eat it early or not at all.\n\nBut if I eat it early, I can then go to (4,6) and (1,6).\n\nIn the first sequence, when I ate (5,4) on turn 2, then (4,6) on turn 5, I can then go to (1,6).\n\nFrom after eating (4,6) on turn 5, snake at [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] or something.\n\nEarlier sequence:\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,4) eat, snake [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 3: move U to (5,5), no food, snake [(5,5), (5,4)]  (tail moved)\n\nTurn 4: move L to (4,5), no food, snake [(4,5), (5,5)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (4,6) eat, snake [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]  grew\n\nNow turn 5, head at (4,6), direction U.\n\nCan move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6) (since U wall, D to (4,5) body)\n\nMove L to (3,6), no food, snake: head (3,6), tail (4,5)? Positions: previous [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)], head to (3,6), no food, so tail moves: remove (5,5), so new positions [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]? Head (3,6), then body (4,6), (4,5), tail (5,5) removed. So [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 6: from (3,6), move L to (2,6), no food, snake: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), tail (4,5) removed. So [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nTurn 7: move L to (1,6) eat, snake grows: head (1,6), tail at (4,6), new segment, so [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nAte three food: (5,4), (4,6), (1,6) by turn 7.\n\nAnd (2,1) is not eaten, but it's far and times out, so fine.\n\nScore 3.\n\nIf I didn't eat (5,4), I could eat (4,6), (1,6), but not (5,4), so score 2.\n\nSo better to eat (5,4) early.\n\nNow, what about the internal obstacles, in this path, I didn't hit any, so it should be fine.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, when I moved to (5,4), I had to move U or D, and I chose U, but I could choose D, but U is towards (4,6), so better.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=2.\n\nSo for turns 2,3,4,5,6,... at least 5 actions.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,4) eat\n\nTurn 3: move U to (5,5) no food\n\nTurn 4: move L to (4,5) no food\n\nTurn 5: move U to (4,6) eat\n\nThen turn 6: move L to (3,6) no food\n\nTurn 7: move L to (2,6) no food\n\nTurn 8: move L to (1,6) eat\n\nBut I have only up to turn 7 for three moves after turn 5, but for the answer, I can list as many as needed, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions for multiple turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like Turn 2: action, Turn 3: action, etc.\n\nSince I need to prioritize long-term, and I have a plan to eat three food, I should output the actions accordingly.\n\nBut for turn 6 and 7, I have moves, but not eating, just moving.\n\nNow, to be precise, let's list the actions from turn 2.\n\nAlso, after turn 5, I have the move to (3,6) etc.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 6, I moved L to (3,6), but from (4,6), after moving U to (4,6) on turn 5, head direction U, then on turn 6, I moved L to (3,6), which is fine.\n\nThen to (2,6) on turn 7, to (1,6) on turn 8.\n\nBut turn 8 is beyond 5 turns from turn 2? Turn 2 to turn 6 is 5 turns ahead? Let's see.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=2.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, meaning consider the future up to turn 7 or more.\n\nAnd output actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should list for turn 2,3,4,5,6,... as many as I can, but at least for 5 turns, say up to turn 7 or so.\n\nSince the snake is small, I can list until I eat the food.\n\nBut for now, with the plan, on turn 2, move R.\n\nThen the actions depend, but in this case, it's deterministic if I follow the path.\n\nBut on turn 3, after moving to (5,5), I could move R to (6,5) if possible, but (6,5) is not obstacle, but in my plan I moved L to (4,5) to go to (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, from (4,6), I moved L to (3,6) to go to (1,6).\n\nI could go other ways, but this seems good.\n\nTo avoid the obstacle at (2,4), but in this path, I am at y=6, so no issue.\n\nAlso, (5,1) obstacle is low, not affecting.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 2: R (to eat (5,4))\n\nTurn 3: U (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 4: L (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 5: U (to (4,6) eat)\n\nThen turn 6: L (to (3,6))\n\nTurn 7: L (to (2,6))\n\nTurn 8: L (to (1,6) eat)\n\nBut turn 8 is later.\n\nFor the answer, I can list up to turn 7 or so.\n\nThe core is to move R on turn 2.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a better move.\n\nIf I move U on turn 2 to (4,5), then turn 3 U to (4,6) eat, then turn 4 I need to move L or R, say L to (3,6), then I can continue to (1,6), but I miss (5,4), so score only 2.\n\nWhereas by eating (5,4) first, I get score 3.\n\nSo better to eat (5,4) immediately.\n\nMoreover, (5,4) has longer life, but since I eat it early, it's fine.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: in this case, when I eat (5,4), the head is at (5,4), tail at (4,4), and (4,4) has no food, so no danger. Similarly elsewhere.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, for turn 2, action should be R.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as per plan.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output multiple actions.\n\nSince the AI is to play, I should output the actions for the next turns.\n\nBut the state might change after each move, but in this case, no new food spawn, I assume, so the food positions are fixed until eaten or expired.\n\nSo I can plan the sequence.\n\nSo let's output:\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the boxed answer, I need to write it.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nAlso, for turn 3, when I move U, it depends on the position, but in this sequence, it's fixed.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo be complete, I can list up to turn 7.\n\nNow, another thing: in turn 4, I move L to (4,5), but (4,5) is empty, fine.\n\nThen turn 5 U to (4,6) eat.\n\nThen turn 6, from (4,6), I move L to (3,6), which is fine.\n\nThen turn 7, from (3,6), move L to (2,6), etc.\n\nBut since I need only to show the actions, not the positions.\n\nAlso, the head direction: after turn 2 move R, direction R.\n\nTurn 3 move U, so direction U.\n\nTurn 4 move L, direction L.\n\nTurn 5 move U, but from (4,5) to (4,6), which is U, but current direction was L, so moving U is not opposite, fine.\n\nThen turn 6 move L to (3,6), from (4,6), moving L, current direction U, not opposite.\n\nFine.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nFor 5 turns ahead, up to turn 6 or 7.\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: L\n\nBut turn 7 is t1+5, since t1=2, t1+5=7.\n\nThink 5+ turns ahead, so considering up to turn 7 or more.\n\nBut output actions from turn 2 onwards.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{L} \\end{array} }\n\nBut turn 6 and 7 are not eating, just moving, but it's part of the plan.\n\nI could stop at turn 5, but to show the path, include more.\n\nSince the instruction says \"maximize score\" and \"long-term survival\", with this plan, I eat two food by turn 5 and heading to third.\n\nAt turn 5, I have eaten (5,4) and (4,6), so score 2, and moving to (1,6).\n\nSurvival is fine.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must plan multiple moves ahead while considering food locations, life spans, obstacles, and the snake's growth. The current state (turn 2) has the snake at position [(4,4)] with head direction right (R). All food is positive (+1 score, +1 length), with positions and life spans: (1,6) life 8, (2,1) life 8, (4,6) life 8, (5,4) life 9. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\n### Key Considerations for Planning:\n- **Immediate opportunity**: Food at (5,4) is adjacent to the head (distance 1) and can be eaten on turn 2 by moving right (R). Eating it grows the snake to length 2, but limits next moves due to the obstacle at (6,4) and the tail at (4,4). After eating, only up (U) or down (D) moves are possible on turn 3.\n- **Prioritizing high-value targets**: Food at (4,6) is close (distance 2) and can be eaten by turn 5 with a sequence of moves. It has a life span of 8, so it must be eaten by turn 9. Similarly, food at (1,6) is farther (distance 5 from (4,4)) but achievable by turn 8 with careful pathing; its life span (8) allows this.\n- **Avoiding risks**: \n  - Eating (5,4) on turn 2 is safe as the tail cell (4,4) has no food, so no tail reward danger.\n  - Moving to (4,6) via (4,5) avoids obstacles and walls.\n  - After eating (4,6), moving left toward (1,6) is optimal as it uses open space and avoids obstacles like (2,4).\n- **Life span management**: \n  - (5,4) life 9: Eaten early (turn 2) to avoid missing it later.\n  - (4,6) life 8: Eaten on turn 5 before expiration.\n  - (1,6) life 8: Eaten on turn 8; with life span 8 at turn 2, it expires after turn 9, so turn 8 is safe.\n  - (2,1) life 8: Not targeted due to distance (5 from start, 6 from post- (4,6) position) and low time window; it would require at least 6 moves from turn 2, but life span only allows until turn 9, making it risky and inefficient. Prioritizing top-row food yields higher score.\n- **Long-term path**: \n  - Turn 2: Eat (5,4) for immediate score and growth.\n  - Turn 3: Move up (U) to (5,5) to position for accessing (4,6).\n  - Turn 4: Move left (L) to (4,5) to approach (4,6).\n  - Turn 5: Move up (U) to (4,6) to eat second food.\n  - Turns 6-8: Move left toward (1,6) to eat third food by turn 8, achieving a score of 3.\n- **Collision and wall avoidance**: \n  - No instant reverse: After moving R on turn 2, direction is R; U on turn 3 is allowed (not opposite). Similarly, subsequent moves respect direction constraints.\n  - Obstacles: Path avoids (6,4), (2,4), etc., by steering clear of these cells.\n  - Walls: Moves stay within x=1-6, y=1-6 (borders are fatal).\n- **5+ turn lookahead**: The sequence to turn 7 ensures (1,6) is reached safely. After turn 8, the snake can explore for new food or survive, but the focus is on secured rewards.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe optimal sequence eats (5,4) on turn 2, (4,6) on turn 5, and (1,6) on turn 8, maximizing score to 3 while avoiding risks. Actions are listed for turns 2 to 7 (6 turns ahead from turn 2), with turn 8 implied for completion.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{L} \\end{array} }\n\n- **Turn 2 (R)**: Move right to (5,4), eating food (+1 score, snake now [(5,4), (4,4)]).\n- **Turn 3 (U)**: Move up to (5,5); no food, snake now [(5,5), (5,4)].\n- **Turn 4 (L)**: Move left to (4,5); no food, snake now [(4,5), (5,5)].\n- **Turn 5 (U)**: Move up to (4,6), eating food (+1 score, snake now [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]).\n- **Turn 6 (L)**: Move left to (3,6); no food, snake now [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)].\n- **Turn 7 (L)**: Move left to (2,6); no food, snake now [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)].\n- **Turn 8 (implied L)**: Move left to (1,6), eating food (+1 score).\n\nThis plan achieves a score of 3 by turn 8 and ensures survival by avoiding dead ends (e.g., not targeting (2,1) due to time constraints). After turn 8, the snake can navigate open areas like (1,5) or (2,5) for potential new food.",

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,4), body at (4,4). So the snake is only 2 segments long right now. Head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to get to (5,4) from (4,4).\n\nFood positions with value and life span:\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (4,6) with value 1, life span 7\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1, and life span is 7 for each, meaning they disappear after 7 turns, including the current turn, so after turn 9 (since current turn is 3, 3+7-1=9? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns from now. For example, at turn t, life span L, it will be gone by turn t+L. Since countdown decreases each turn including current.\n\nLife span 7 at turn 3: after 7 turns, it disappears, so it lasts until turn 9 (turn 3 to 9 is 7 turns: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 — that's 7 turns, gone at turn 10? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t, life span N; turn t+1, N-1; ... turn t+N-1, 1; turn t+N, 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten up to turn t+N-1.\n\nFor food at turn 3 with life span 7: it can be eaten from turn 3 to turn 9 (since at turn 10 it disappears). Life span decreases to 6 at turn 4, 5 at turn 5, ..., 1 at turn 9, gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, all food is positive, value +1, so eating any will increase length by 1.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks and think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked.\n\nSnake: head at (5,4), body at (4,4). Head direction R, so it came from left.\n\nPossible moves: I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but cannot reverse instantly. Since head direction is R, reverse would be L. So I cannot go Left on this turn.\n\nAllowed moves: U, D, R. Not L.\n\nNow, let's see what cells are available.\n\nCurrent position: head (5,4)\n\n- Up: (5,5) — is this free? Need to check walls and body.\n\nWalls: y=7 is top wall, but (5,5) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, but that's different. (5,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBody: snake is at (5,4) and (4,4), so (5,5) is not occupied by body. Moving to (5,5) would be fine, as long as no wall.\n\nSimilarly, Down: (5,3) — y=0 is wall, but (5,3) is above y=0, so should be free? y=0 is bottom wall, so y=0 is wall, y=1 to 6 are free except obstacles. (5,3): x=5,y=3. Obstacles: (5,1) is wall, but (5,3) not listed, so free. Body: not occupied.\n\nRight: (6,4) — but (6,4) is an internal obstacle! Wall. So cannot go right, it's blocked.\n\n(6,4) is a wall, so moving right to (6,4) is impossible.\n\nLeft: but cannot, because reverse direction not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: only Up or Down? U or D.\n\nU: to (5,5)\n\nD: to (5,3)\n\nCannot go L or R.\n\nR is blocked by wall, L is reverse not allowed.\n\nNow, food positions: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n\n(1,6) is top-left, (2,1) is bottom-left, (4,6) is top, x=4,y=6.\n\nSnake is at (5,4), so (4,6) is close, but y=6 is high, x=4.\n\n(1,6) is far left top, (2,1) is far left bottom.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, since snake is short, only 2 segments, eating food is good to grow, but I need to avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (4,4), and if I move away, and later head comes back, I could eat food under body, but currently no food under snake.\n\nSnake positions: (5,4) and (4,4), no food there.\n\nFood is at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n\n(4,6) is above, at y=6, x=4.\n\nFrom (5,4), if I go Up to (5,5), I can then go to (5,6) or left to (4,5), etc., to reach (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is food, so if I go to (4,6), I can eat it.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, at turn 3, head at (5,4), direction R.\n\nPossible actions: U or D.\n\nIf I go U to (5,5), then head is at (5,5), direction U (since I moved up).\n\nThen from there, I can go U to (5,6), or L to (4,5), or R to (6,5), but R to (6,5): (6,5) is not wall? Internal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, but (6,5) not listed, so should be free. Walls: (6,1) is wall, but (6,5) different y.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,4), but (5,4) is now the body? After moving, body will be at previous positions.\n\nAfter move, if I go U to (5,5), then snake positions: head (5,5), body (5,4). Tail was (4,4), but since I didn't eat, length same, so tail moves away. After moving without eating, the tail moves forward, so snake becomes [(5,5), (5,4)] if I go up.\n\nInitially: positions [(5,4), (4,4)]\n\nAfter move, if I move to new head position, and since no food eaten, tail is removed, so new positions: head at new cell, and body segments follow.\n\nSo if I go U to (5,5), new head (5,5), then body is (5,4), and tail (4,4) is gone? No.\n\nSnake movement: when you move, the head goes to new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if positions are [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move to new cell, new positions [H_new, H_old, B1_old, ...] but since no growth, the tail is removed, so it's [H_new, H_old, B1_old, ..., second last] or for length 2.\n\nLength 2: positions [H, T]\n\nAfter move to new head position, say H_new, and since no eat, tail moves away, so new positions [H_new, H_old]. The old tail is gone.\n\nSo here: start [ (5,4), (4,4) ] H = (5,4), T = (4,4)\n\nIf move U to (5,5), new head is (5,5), and body is (5,4) — the old head. Old tail (4,4) is vacated.\n\nSo snake becomes [(5,5), (5,4)]\n\nSimilarly, if I go D to (5,3), snake becomes [(5,3), (5,4)]\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nAt turn 3, I can go U or D.\n\nIf I go U to (5,5), then head at (5,5), direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,6) which is food.\n\n(4,6) is at x=4,y=6.\n\nFrom (5,5), to (4,6): that would be left and up, but moves are one step, so I need to go directly.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go L to (4,5), then U to (4,6), but that would be on turn 4 and 5.\n\nLet's think turns.\n\nTurn 3: action U, move to (5,5), snake now [(5,5), (5,4)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen turn 4: from (5,5), I can go L to (4,5), which is left, and since direction was U, left is not reverse, so ok. Reverse would be D, but L is perpendicular.\n\nAfter moving U, direction is U, so reverse is D, so I cannot go D next, but L and R and U are allowed.\n\nSo go L to (4,5), head at (4,5), snake positions: head (4,5), body (5,5) — old head.\n\nSnake: [(4,5), (5,5)]\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), which is the food cell.\n\n(4,6) has food, so if I move to (4,6), I eat it, and since it's positive, length increases by 1.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nStart turn 3: snake length 2.\n\nTurn 3: move U to (5,5), no eat, snake [(5,5), (5,4)] length 2.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (4,5), no eat (assuming no food there), snake [(4,5), (5,5)] length 2.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (4,6), eat food at (4,6), so head moves to (4,6), and since eat, tail stays, so new positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), and the previous body (5,5) becomes part, so snake [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] length 3.\n\nAnd food at (4,6) is consumed.\n\nNow, life span was 7 at turn 3, so at turn 5, it has life span 7 - (5-3) = 7-2=5? At turn 3, life span 7; turn 4, life span 6; turn 5, life span 5, so still there.\n\nBut I ate it, so gone.\n\nNow, is this safe? On turn 5, after eating, head at (4,6), which is near the top.\n\ny=6, and y=7 is wall, so I need to be careful not to hit wall.\n\nFrom (4,6), I can go left, right, down, but not up since y=7 wall.\n\nBut let's see the other moves.\n\nIf at turn 3 I go down to (5,3), then what?\n\nGo D to (5,3), snake [(5,3), (5,4)] head direction D.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other food, like (2,1) or (1,6), but (1,6) is far.\n\n(2,1) is at x=2,y=1.\n\nFrom (5,3), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles: (5,1) is wall, (2,4) wall, etc.\n\n(5,1) wall, so (5,3) to (5,2) might be possible, but (5,1) is wall, so y=1 is not wall except at obstacles? y=0 is wall, y=1 to 6 free except specific cells.\n\n(5,1) is an obstacle, so (5,1) is wall, but (5,2) and (5,3) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is obstacle, so (2,4) wall.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nFirst, going up seems better to get the close food at (4,6).\n\nBut let's think about the other food and long term.\n\nThere is also (1,6) and (2,1), but (2,1) is bottom left, (1,6) top left.\n\nWith internal obstacles, the grid has some blocked cells.\n\nList all walls:\n\n- Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n\n- Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo cells that are walls: all x=0, all x=7, all y=0, all y=7, and (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow, free cells: for example, (4,6) is free, (1,6): x=1,y=6, is it wall? y=6 not border, x=1 not border, internal obstacles: (1,2) is wall, but (1,6) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): x=2,y=1, not border, internal (2,4) is different, (5,1) different, so (2,1) should be free.\n\nBut (2,1) is near (5,1) wall? (5,1) is wall, but (2,1) is separate.\n\nNow, if I go down at turn 3, to (5,3), then I might head towards (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is at distance, and I need to avoid obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), I can go left to (4,3), then to (3,3), etc., but there is (2,4) wall above, but I'm going to y=1.\n\ny=1 has (5,1) wall, so at y=1, cells like (2,1) might be accessible.\n\nBut let's see path to (2,1).\n\nFrom (5,3): go left to (4,3), then down to (4,2)? Or left to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut I also have to consider that the snake might get trapped or something.\n\nMoreover, the food at (2,1) has life span 7, so I have until turn 9 to eat it, similarly for others.\n\nTurn 3 to turn 9 is 6 turns to act.\n\nBut eating sooner might be better to grow, but with risks.\n\nNow, another thing: tail reward danger. But since snake is short, and no food under tail yet, probably not an issue.\n\nBut later, when longer, might be.\n\nFor now, at turn 3, if I go up, I can eat (4,6) by turn 5, as I thought.\n\nThen snake is at (4,6) with length 3.\n\nFrom there, I can go left, right, or down.\n\nIf I go right to (5,6), but (5,6) is free? Walls: y=6 not border, x=5,y=6, obstacles: (6,4) but different, so free.\n\nThen (6,6) might be free, but x=7 is wall, so (6,6) is ok, but cannot go right to x=7.\n\n(6,6) is within bounds, x=6<7, y=6<7.\n\nx=7 is wall, so x=6 is last column? x from 0 to 7, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except obstacles.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so min x=1, max x=6; min y=1, max y=6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6.\n\nIn the grid, cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal walls.\n\nInternal walls: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4, which is within 1-6,1-6.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) x=5,y=1, etc.\n\nNow back to (4,6): from there, after eating, turn 5 head at (4,6), direction U (since I moved up to get there).\n\nThen I need to move. Possible moves: L to (3,6), R to (5,6), D to (4,5). Cannot U since y=7 wall.\n\n(3,6) and (5,6) should be free.\n\n(5,6) is free, as above.\n\n(3,6): x=3,y=6, not border, not in internal obstacles list, so free.\n\n(4,5) is free, but was body? At turn 5, after eating, positions [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)], so (4,5) is body, (5,5) is body.\n\nIf I go down to (4,5), that would be collision with body, deadly.\n\nSo from (4,6), I cannot go D to (4,5) because body is there.\n\nSimilarly, cannot go to cells with body or walls.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\nNow, (3,6) or (5,6).\n\nIf I go R to (5,6), then head to (5,6), direction R (if I move right).\n\nThen snake positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5)? After moving, since no eat, tail moves.\n\nTurn 5: after eating, snake [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] length 3.\n\nTurn 6: move to new position, say R to (5,6), no eat (assume no food), so head to (5,6), body moves: the segment that was at (4,6) moves to (5,6)? No.\n\nMovement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (4,6), index 1: (4,5), index 2: (5,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,6), new head (5,6), then body: index 1 moves to old head position (4,6), index 2 moves to old index 1 position (4,5). Since no growth, the tail (old index 2) is removed, so positions become: head (5,6), body (4,6), and the segment at (4,5) is the new tail? Let's see:\n\nOld positions: [H: (4,6), B1: (4,5), B2: (5,5)]\n\nAfter move to (5,6): new head H' = (5,6)\n\nB1' = old H = (4,6)\n\nB2' = old B1 = (4,5)\n\nBut since no eat, the last segment is removed, so only [H', B1'] = [(5,6), (4,6)]\n\nThe tail B2 (5,5) is vacated.\n\nSo snake is now length 2 again? No, when you eat, you grow, so after eating, length is 3, and when you move without eating, you stay length 3, but the tail moves.\n\nIn this case: at turn 5, after eating at (4,6), snake length 3: positions A=(4,6), B=(4,5), C=(5,5)\n\nTurn 6: if I move to (5,6), and no food there, so head moves to (5,6), then the body: the first body segment moves to A, which is (4,6), and the second body segment moves to B, which is (4,5). Since no eat, we do not add a new segment, so the tail segment is removed, meaning C is left, and the new positions are [ (5,6), (4,6) ]? That would be length 2, but it was length 3, moving without eating should keep length 3, but the tail moves forward.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nStandard snake: when you move to a new cell:\n\n- If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail is removed from its cell, so the snake length stays the same, but the tail cell is vacated.\n\n- If food, head moves to new cell with food, each body segment moves as above, but the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, thus length increases.\n\nIn the no eat case, for a snake of length L, after move to empty cell, new positions: head at new cell, and body segments at the previous positions of the head and body except the last one is removed.\n\nFor example, positions [P0, P1, P2] with P0 head.\n\nMove to Q, no eat: new positions [Q, P0, P1] — the P2 is removed, so from [P0,P1,P2] to [Q, P0, P1], which is still length 3 if it was 3? [Q, P0, P1] has three positions.\n\nStart: [H, B1, T] where T is tail.\n\nAfter move to new head position N:\n\n- If no eat: new head N, new B1 = old H, new T = old B1. So [N, old H, old B1]. The old T is vacated.\n\n- If eat: new head N, new B1 = old H, new B2 = old B1, and the tail stays, so [N, old H, old B1, old T], so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, turn 5: after eating at (4,6), snake is [H=(4,6), B1=(4,5), T=(5,5)] length 3.\n\nTurn 6: move to (5,6), assume no food at (5,6), so no eat, new head (5,6), new B1 = old H = (4,6), new T = old B1 = (4,5). So positions [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nLength still 3.\n\nThen old T (5,5) is vacated.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone to (3,6) instead.\n\nBut at (4,6), after turn 5, I can go L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is free, as is (3,6).\n\nNow, going back to turn 3 choice.\n\nIf I go down at turn 3 to (5,3), then snake [(5,3), (5,4)] head direction D.\n\nThen I can try to go to (2,1) or something.\n\nBut (2,1) is at (2,1), from (5,3), I need to go left and down.\n\nFor example, turn 4: from (5,3) direction D, I can go L to (4,3) or R to (6,3) or D to (5,2), but not U (reverse).\n\n(6,3): x=6,y=3, not border, internal obstacles: (6,4) wall, but (6,3) not, (6,1) wall but y=3 different, so (6,3) free? (6,1) is wall, but (6,3) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2): x=5,y=2, not obstacle, (5,1) is wall but y=2.\n\nBut (5,2) might be close to (5,1) wall.\n\nNow, to reach (2,1), I need to go left.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (2,4), which is above, but at y=1, (2,1) should be accessible.\n\nPath: from (5,3), go L to (4,3), then L to (3,3), then D to (3,2), then L to (2,2), then D to (2,1), for example.\n\nBut (2,2) and (2,1) are free, I think.\n\n(2,2): not listed as wall, so free.\n\nBut (2,4) is wall, but different y.\n\nSo possible, but it takes several turns.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (1,6) is far.\n\nBut life span is 7, so I have time.\n\nHowever, eating the close food at (4,6) seems efficient.\n\nMoreover, after eating (4,6), I am at (4,6) with length 3, and I can explore.\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nIf I go to (4,6) and eat, then at (4,6), I can go L or R.\n\nIf I go R to (5,6), as above.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can go U, but y=6, U to (5,7) is wall, y=7 wall, so cannot.\n\nD to (5,5), L to (4,6) but (4,6) is body? At that point, positions: after move to (5,6), snake [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nSo (4,6) is body, so from (5,6), I cannot go L to (4,6) because body is there.\n\nR to (6,6), which is free? x=6,y=6, not border, not obstacle, so free.\n\nD to (5,5), which is free, since (5,5) was vacated earlier? In the positions, (4,5) is body, but (5,5) is not occupied now.\n\nAfter turn 6 move to (5,6), positions [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)], so (5,5) is empty.\n\nSo from (5,6), possible moves: R to (6,6), D to (5,5), or L to (4,6) but body, no, or U wall, no.\n\nSo only R or D.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone L to (3,6) from (4,6), similar situation.\n\nNow, (6,6) is near the corner, and I might get trapped if not careful.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), if I go R to (6,6), then head at (6,6), direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: D to (6,5), or L to (5,6), but (5,6) is body? After moving to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6)? Let's see.\n\nPrevious positions turn 6: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nAfter move to (6,6) no eat: new head (6,6), new B1 = old H = (5,6), new T = old B1 = (4,6)? Old positions: H=(5,6), B1=(4,6), B2=(4,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,6) no eat: new head (6,6), new B1 = old H = (5,6), new B2 = old B1 = (4,6), but since no eat, the tail is removed, so new positions [ (6,6), (5,6) ] and (4,6) is body, but we have only two segments? Mistake.\n\nLength 3: positions [P0, P1, P2] with P0 head.\n\nMove to Q no eat: new positions [Q, P0, P1] — P2 is removed, so [Q, P0, P1] which is three positions.\n\nSo from [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)] move to (6,6) no eat: new head (6,6), new B1 = old P0 = (5,6), new B2 = old P1 = (4,6), so positions [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6)] and old P2 (4,5) vacated.\n\nThen from (6,6), I can go D to (6,5) or L to (5,6), but (5,6) is now body, so cannot go there.\n\nU to (6,7) wall, R to (7,6) wall, so only possible move is D to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is free? x=6,y=5, not border, internal (6,4) wall but y=5 different, (6,1) wall but different, so (6,5) free.\n\nSo go to (6,5), then from there, I can go to other areas.\n\nBut it might be ok.\n\nSimilarly, if at (4,6) I go left to (3,6), then similar to the left side.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (1,2) and (2,4), so left side might have more obstacles.\n\n(2,4) is wall, (1,2) wall.\n\nBut (3,6) is free.\n\nNow, back to turn 3 decision.\n\nIf I go down at turn 3 to (5,3), then I can go to (5,2) or (4,3), etc., to reach (2,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is food, I can eat it later.\n\nBut it might take more turns, and the food at (4,6) might be eaten by me or if not, it disappears later, but since I'm the only one, I can choose.\n\nBut if I don't go for (4,6), it will disappear at turn 10, but I can go for it later if I want.\n\nBut going for it now is efficient.\n\nMoreover, there is another food at (1,6), which is also on y=6, x=1.\n\nSo after eating (4,6), I can go left to (3,6), then to (2,6), but (2,6) is free? x=2,y=6, not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n\nThen to (1,6), which is food.\n\n(1,6) has food, life span 7 at turn 3, so at turn 6 or 7, it might still be there.\n\nFor example, from turn 3 to turn 6, life span decreases to 4, still there.\n\nTurn 7, life span 3, etc.\n\nSo possible.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) at bottom.\n\nBut with internal walls, the bottom left might be tricky.\n\nFor example, (5,1) wall, (6,1) wall, (1,2) wall, so around (2,1), I can access, but need to be careful.\n\nFor instance, (2,1) can be reached from (2,2) down or from (1,1) right, but (1,1) might be free.\n\nBut (1,2) is wall, so (1,1) is corner? x=1,y=1, not border, but y=0 wall below, x=0 left wall.\n\n(1,1) should be free, since not listed as obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) free.\n\nBut to get there, from (5,3), I can go left to (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), then to (2,1), but (3,1) free? x=3,y=1, not obstacle.\n\n(3,1) to (2,1) left.\n\nOr directly from (2,2) down to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,4) is wall above, but not blocking.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut it takes more turns, and I might miss other opportunities.\n\nWhereas going for (4,6) is quick and safe.\n\nNow, what about the tail reward danger? Not applicable now.\n\nAlso, food under body: currently no.\n\nBut after moving, if I leave a cell with food, but no food there.\n\nSo I think going up to get (4,6) is better.\n\nThen after that, I can plan to get (1,6) or (2,1).\n\n(1,6) is closer to the left side.\n\nAt turn 3, if I go down, I might get (2,1) but slower.\n\nMoreover, at (5,3), if I go down to (5,2), then I can go to (5,1) but (5,1) is wall, so cannot, so I have to go left or right.\n\nBut right to (6,3) or something.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nI think the best is to go up at turn 3 to (5,5), then left to (4,5), then up to (4,6) to eat.\n\nThen from there, I can go left towards (1,6).\n\nSo let's outline the actions.\n\nTurn 3: U to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 4: L to (4,5) — from (5,5), direction after U is U, so moving left is allowed.\n\nThen turn 5: U to (4,6) eat food.\n\nNow, at turn 5, head at (4,6), direction U.\n\nThen I need to move for turn 6.\n\nFrom (4,6), possible moves: L to (3,6) or R to (5,6). Cannot D or U.\n\nNow, to go towards (1,6), I should go left to (3,6).\n\nSo turn 6: L to (3,6)\n\nThen from (3,6), I can go L to (2,6), or D to (3,5), etc.\n\n(2,6) is free, as per earlier.\n\nThen to (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) is food, I can eat it.\n\nFrom (3,6), go L to (2,6), then L to (1,6) eat.\n\nBut need to check if possible.\n\nTurn 6: after turn 5, positions: turn 5 after eat: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] head (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,6), assume no food at (3,6), so no eat.\n\nNew head (3,6), new B1 = old H = (4,6), new B2 = old B1 = (4,5), so positions [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] and old T (5,5) vacated.\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,6), go L to (2,6), no eat (assume), new head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6)? Positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] move to (2,6) no eat: new head (2,6), new B1 = (3,6), new B2 = (4,6), so [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\n(4,5) vacated.\n\nThen turn 8: from (2,6), go L to (1,6), and (1,6) has food, so eat it.\n\nLife span at turn 3 is 7, turn 8: 7 - (8-3) = 7-5=2, so life span 2, still there.\n\nEat at turn 8, grow to length 4.\n\nThen head at (1,6), direction L.\n\nFrom there, I can go down or right, etc.\n\nBut need to avoid walls and body.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the actions up to turn 8.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and provide actions starting from turn 3.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions from turn 3 onwards for several turns.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, getting two foods quickly is good.\n\nThere is also (2,1), but I can get it later if possible.\n\nAfter turn 8, I am at (1,6), with length 4 or more.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nIn this plan, by turn 5 I have one food, turn 8 another.\n\nBut at turn 3, I need to output actions for turn 3,4,5,... but I don't know how many.\n\nThe answer format says: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nSince t1=3, I should provide actions for turn 3,4,5,6,7,... but I need to decide how far to plan.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns, from turn 3 to 7 or 8.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 moves.\n\nFrom turn 3 to turn 7 is 5 moves: turn 3,4,5,6,7.\n\nIn my plan, turn 3: U, turn 4: L, turn 5: U, turn 6: L, turn 7: L to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 8: L to (1,6) eat.\n\nBut turn 7 is L to (2,6), which is part of it.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide up to turn 7 or 8.\n\nPerhaps provide a sequence.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nNow, what if at turn 3 I go down? It might not be better.\n\nFor example, if go D to (5,3), then I need to reach food.\n\n(2,1) is far, and (4,6) might be missed if I don't go there.\n\nLife span 7, so at turn 10 gone, but if I go down, I might not get to (4,6) in time.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), to (4,6): need to go up and left, but from (5,3) to (4,6) is not direct.\n\n(5,3) to (5,4) but (5,4) is body or something.\n\nAfter turn 3 down: snake at [(5,3), (5,4)]\n\nThen turn 4: say go L to (4,3), then turn 5: U to (4,4), but (4,4) might be free, but no food.\n\nThen to (4,5), etc., to (4,6), but by turn 6 or 7, while in the up plan, I eat at turn 5.\n\nSo better to go up.\n\nMoreover, in the down direction, there might be risks with obstacles.\n\nFor example, near (5,1) wall, etc.\n\nSo I think up is better.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with the plan to get (4,6) and then (1,6).\n\nNow, for the actions, let's list:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: L (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 5: U (to (4,6) eat)\n\nThen turn 6: L (to (3,6))\n\nNow, at turn 6, after moving to (3,6), positions as above.\n\nThen turn 7: from (3,6), I can go L to (2,6)\n\nBut is (2,6) safe? (2,4) is wall, but (2,6) is different y, so should be free.\n\nThen turn 8: L to (1,6) eat.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions starting from turn 3.\n\nSince the answer should be in a boxed format.\n\nAlso, I should consider if at turn 6, after (3,6), I could go down or something, but to get (1,6), left is direct.\n\nThe other food (2,1) is there, but I can leave it for now or get later.\n\nSince I'm thinking long term, getting two foods is good.\n\nAfter (1,6), I can go down to (1,5), etc., to explore or get (2,1).\n\nBut for now, let's plan the immediate actions.\n\nI think for turns 3 to 7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: L\n\nAt turn 7, going to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 8 would be L to (1,6), but not in the sequence if I stop at turn 7.\n\nSince the state is at turn 3, and I need to think ahead, but output for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I can output up to turn 7.\n\nBut at turn 7, I am at (2,6) or something.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 5: head at (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: L to (3,6)\n\nTurn 7: L to (2,6)\n\nNow, at (2,6), I can go to (2,5), (1,6), or (3,6), but (3,6) might be body.\n\nPositions after turn 7: let's track.\n\nTurn 5 end: snake at [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] head (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,6) no eat, new positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), (4,5)  // old (5,5) vacated\n\nTurn 7: move L to (2,6) no eat, new head (2,6), new body: B1 = old head (3,6), B2 = old B1 (4,6), so positions [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] and (4,5) vacated.\n\nFrom (2,6), turn 8: I can go L to (1,6) to eat, or down to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, since it starts from turn 3, I can provide actions for turn 3 to, say, turn 7.\n\nBut turn 7 action is L to (2,6).\n\nThen I stop.\n\nI could include turn 8 if I want, but not necessary.\n\nThe core is to start from turn 3.\n\nAnother thing: in the food, there is (2,1), but I'm not going there yet.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if going down allows me to get (2,1) faster, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), to (2,1): as I said, (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1) to (2,1) or shorter, but still about 5 moves to reach, and I eat at (2,1) say turn 8 or so.\n\nBut in up plan, I eat at turn 5 and turn 8, so better.\n\nIn up plan, eat at turn 5 and turn 8, two foods.\n\nIn down plan, I might eat only one by turn 8, say (2,1).\n\nSo up is better.\n\nMoreover, after (1,6), I can go down to get (2,1) if possible.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), from (1,6) to (2,1) is not direct, need to go down and right, but with obstacles.\n\nFor example, (1,5), (1,4), etc., but (1,2) is wall, so I cannot go below y=2 at x=1, I think.\n\n(1,2) is wall, so at x=1, y=2 is wall, so cells (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) are present.\n\n(1,6) is food, (1,5) free, (1,4) free, (1,3) free, but (1,2) wall, so from (1,6) I can go to (1,5), (1,4), but not to (1,1) directly, since (1,2) blocked.\n\nTo reach (2,1), I need to go to (2,5) or something down.\n\nBut it might be messy.\n\nI think my initial plan is fine.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nThen for turn 6 and 7, to go towards (1,6), I need to go left.\n\nTurn 6: L (to (3,6))\n\nTurn 7: L (to (2,6))\n\nThen turn 8 would be L to (1,6), but since I output up to turn 7 for now.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nSince the state is at turn 3, and I need actions for turn 3 onwards.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo I can provide, say, 5 actions: turn 3 to 7.\n\nBut at turn 7, I am at (2,6), and (1,6) is still there, so I can continue.\n\nBut for the response, I think providing 5 moves is reasonable.\n\nTo be complete, I can provide until I eat or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother point: the tail reward danger, but not applicable.\n\nAlso, food under body: not now.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: L\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 4, I go L to (4,5), which is not food, then turn 5 U to (4,6) eat.\n\nThen turn 6 L to (3,6), turn 7 L to (2,6).\n\nNow, for turn 6 and 7, I assumed no food, which is true, only (1,6) and (2,1) left, but not at (3,6) or (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is not food, (1,6) is.\n\nSo turn 7 to (2,6), then later to (1,6).\n\nBut in the actions, I have turn 7: L to (2,6).\n\nPerhaps I can stop at turn 7.\n\nTo think further, at (2,6), I might go down to (2,5) or left to (1,6), but (1,6) is adjacent left.\n\nBut for now, the actions from turn 3 to 7.\n\nSo in the box.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating the positive food at (4,6) efficiently, as it is the closest and can be reached by turn 5. This allows the snake to grow early, providing more flexibility for future moves. After eating (4,6), the plan is to head towards (1,6) to eat another positive food, increasing the score further. The food at (2,1) is not targeted immediately due to its distance and the presence of obstacles, but it can be considered later if feasible within its life span (disappears after turn 10).\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Current Snake State**: Head at (5,4), direction R, length 2. Possible moves from (5,4) are U or D (R is blocked by wall at (6,4); L is reverse, not allowed).\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (4,6) is reachable by turn 5 and has a life span until turn 10. Eating it early grows the snake to length 3.\n  - (1,6) is then targeted, as it can be reached by turn 8 with a safe path along the top row.\n  - (2,1) is not addressed in this 5-turn plan due to distance and obstacles, but it remains an option for later turns (life span until turn 10).\n- **Obstacle and Collision Avoidance**: \n  - Walls and internal obstacles are avoided by moving within open cells (e.g., not moving to (6,4), (5,1), etc.).\n  - Body collisions are prevented by not moving into occupied body segments (e.g., after eating (4,6), moving left or right from (4,6) avoids the body at (4,5)).\n  - The path to (1,6) uses the top row (y=6), which is safe except for the border wall at y=7.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - By eating (4,6) quickly, the snake grows, making it easier to navigate and eat more food.\n  - After turn 7, the snake can continue to (1,6) for another point, then assess (2,1) or other food that may spawn.\n  - The plan avoids dead ends: for example, after reaching (2,6), moving left to (1,6) is safe, and then the snake can move down to explore or target (2,1).\n\n### Planned Moves (5+ Turns Ahead):\nThe sequence below starts from turn 3 and covers 5 moves (turns 3 to 7), thinking ahead to turn 8 for eating (1,6). All moves are valid (no instant reversals or wall/body collisions).\n\n- **Turn 3 (t1=3)**: Move U (up) to (5,5).  \n  *Reasoning*: From (5,4), U is safe (no wall or body). D is possible but leads away from the high-value food at (4,6). Moving U sets up a path to (4,6).\n\n- **Turn 4 (t1+1=4)**: Move L (left) to (4,5).  \n  *Reasoning*: From (5,5), direction is now U. L is allowed (not reverse) and moves toward (4,6). (4,5) is open (no wall or body).\n\n- **Turn 5 (t1+2=5)**: Move U (up) to (4,6).  \n  *Reasoning*: From (4,5), U to (4,6) eats the positive food (value +1), growing the snake to length 3. Life span at turn 3 was 7, so at turn 5 it is 5 (still present). Direction is now U.\n\n- **Turn 6 (t1+3=6)**: Move L (left) to (3,6).  \n  *Reasoning*: From (4,6), direction U. L is allowed (not reverse) and moves toward (1,6). (3,6) is open (no wall or body; (2,4) is a wall but at different y).\n\n- **Turn 7 (t1+4=7)**: Move L (left) to (2,6).  \n  *Reasoning*: From (3,6), direction L. Continuing L to (2,6) is safe and efficient for reaching (1,6). (2,6) is open (no wall or body; (2,4) is a wall but at different y).\n\n### State After Turn 7:\n- **Snake Positions**: After turn 7, the snake is at [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] (head at (2,6), length 3).\n- **Next Moves (Beyond Turn 7)**: \n  - Turn 8: Move L to (1,6) to eat the food there (life span at turn 3 was 7, so at turn 8 it is 2, still present). This grows the snake to length 4.\n  - After eating (1,6), the snake can move down (e.g., to (1,5)) to avoid the y=7 wall and potentially target (2,1) or other food.\n\nThis plan scores 2 points by turn 8 (eating (4,6) and (1,6)) with minimal risk. If (2,1) is still present after turn 8, it can be pursued with the grown snake, but the path must avoid obstacles like (1,2) and (2,4).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: L \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: L \\\\\nTurn 7: L\n}",

So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are there, I can only move within x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6? Let me confirm.\n\nThe border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So yes, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. But there are internal obstacles too: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,5), and one body segment at (5,4). Since it's only two segments, the tail is at (5,4). Head direction is Up, which means currently moving upwards.\n\nFood positions with life span and value:\n\n- (1,6) value 1, life span 6\n\n- (2,1) value 1, life span 6\n\n- (4,6) value 1, life span 6\n\n- (6,6) value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned here.\n\nLife span: for (1,6), life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns from now? Since current turn is 4, it will disappear at turn 10? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 4, life span is 6, so after 6 more turns, it vanishes. Similarly for others.\n\n(2,1): life span 6, disappears turn 10.\n\n(4,6): life span 6, disappears turn 10.\n\n(6,6): life span 10, disappears turn 14.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for at least 5 turns ahead. Since the answer should include actions for turn t1 (4), t1+1 (5), t1+2 (6), etc., up to some point, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and then \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to output a sequence of moves starting from turn 4.\n\nBut how many moves? It doesn't specify, but since it's a sequence, I should plan for several turns, at least 5.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: walls at borders, so playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo let's list all blocked cells:\n\n- Borders: x=0, x=7 for all y; y=0, y=7 for all x. But since playable area is inside, cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls.\n\n- Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head at (5,5), body at (5,4). So the snake is vertical, head up from body. Since head direction is U, it moved to (5,5) from below? Positions are [(5,5), (5,4)], so head is (5,5), previous position was (5,4), so it moved up to (5,5) from (5,4). But head direction is U, which is consistent.\n\nNow possible moves from (5,5):\n\nCurrent direction is U, so I can move U, L, or R? But no instant reverse, so since I just moved up, I cannot move down (D) next. So possible actions: U (up), L (left), R (right). D is opposite to U, so not allowed.\n\nSo from (5,5), moving:\n\n- U: to (5,6)\n\n- D: not allowed, reverse\n\n- L: to (4,5)\n\n- R: to (6,5)\n\nNow, check if these are valid: not walls and not body, except tail might be ok if I move into it, but body collision: head touches any body segment except that when moving into tail, since tail moves, it might be ok.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nFirst, (5,6): is this wall? y=6 is not border wall? Border walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within 1 to 6, so not border wall. But is there internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). None at (5,6), so (5,6) is free.\n\n(4,5): x=4,y=5, not border, not internal obstacle, so free.\n\n(6,5): x=6,y=5. x=6 is not border? Border is x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable. But internal obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), so (6,5) is not listed, so should be free? (6,5) is different from (6,4) and (6,1).\n\n(6,4) is blocked, (6,5) is above it, should be free unless it's wall, but no.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is free.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (1,6): value +1\n\n- (2,1): value +1\n\n- (4,6): value +1\n\n- (6,6): value +1\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing survival.\n\nFirst, let's see where I can go to eat food.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and head collides with the new tail segment.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (5,4), and head is at (5,5), so they are adjacent vertically. Is there food on tail? Tail is at (5,4), but food is not on tail; food is at other locations. So no issue now.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,5):\n\n- U to (5,6)\n\n- L to (4,5)\n\n- R to (6,5)\n\nI need to evaluate each option with future moves.\n\nSince I need to output a sequence, I should simulate paths.\n\nFirst, let's find paths to food.\n\nFood at (4,6), which is close; (1,6) left top; (2,1) left bottom; (6,6) right top.\n\n(5,6) is directly above, and there's food at (4,6) and (6,6), but (5,6) has no food.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), then I'm at (5,6). Snake becomes [(5,6), (5,5)] since body moves to head position.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: head direction would be U if I moved up, so I can move U, L, R? But from (5,6), moving U to (5,7) but y=7 is wall, so cannot. y=7 is border wall, so (5,7) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,5) but (5,5) is now the body, so if I move down, head to (5,5), which is occupied by body, collision. After moving to (5,6), snake is [(5,6), (5,5)], so (5,5) is body segment.\n\nIf I move D from (5,6) to (5,5), head touches body, collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, L to (4,6), R to (6,6).\n\n(4,6) has food? Food at (4,6), yes, value +1.\n\n(6,6) has food, value +1.\n\nAlso, (1,6) has food.\n\nBut from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf I move to (4,6), I eat the food there, since it's positive, snake grows to length 3: head at (4,6), body (5,6), tail (5,5)? Positions: after eating, when head moves to food, it grows, so new positions: head at food, and body segments follow, so if I move to (4,6), which has food, so snake becomes [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]? No: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the tail doesn't move, so snake length increases by one.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, you grow, so the tail stays in place for that turn, meaning the new segment is added at the tail position before moving.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nSo when head moves to a food cell, it consumes the food, and the snake grows by one segment, so the tail remains where it is, and a new segment is added there. So the positions: head moves to new cell, all body segments move, but since growing, the last segment (tail) doesn't move, so it stays, and a new segment is added in the previous tail position.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose before move, positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving without eating, new positions: [newH, H, B1, ..., B_{n-1}] where T is gone.\n\nAfter moving with eating, new positions: [newH, H, B1, ..., T] since tail stays, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, initial: positions [(5,5), (5,4)] so H=(5,5), T=(5,4)\n\nIf I move to (5,6) without eating, snake becomes [(5,6), (5,5)] and T (5,4) is gone.\n\nBut (5,6) has no food, so no eating.\n\nThen snake is [(5,6), (5,5)]\n\nThen if I move to (4,6), which has food, so I eat it: head moves to (4,6), and since eating, the tail (5,5) remains, so new positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]? Let's think.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (5,6), (5,5) ] so H=(5,6), T=(5,5)\n\nMove head to (4,6), which has food. So after move: head at (4,6), and since eating, the tail does not move, so the body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was, which is (5,6), but since tail doesn't move, we add a new segment at the old tail position.\n\nStandard: the body moves as usual, but since growing, the tail position is not vacated.\n\nSo positions: new head at (4,6), then the previous head (5,6) becomes the neck, and the previous tail (5,5) remains as the new tail. So snake: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, if no eating, it would be [(4,6), (5,6)] and (5,5) gone.\n\nBut with eating, it grows.\n\nBack to turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4, from (5,5), I can:\n\nOption 1: Move U to (5,6)\n\nThen at turn 5, I'm at (5,6), snake [(5,6), (5,5)]\n\nFrom (5,6), I can move L to (4,6) or R to (6,6), since U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5) body collision.\n\n(4,6) has food, (6,6) has food.\n\nIf I move L to (4,6), I eat the food at (4,6), so at turn 5, I eat, snake grows to length 3: positions [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (6,6), eat food there, snake [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nNow, from (4,6), after eating, head at (4,6), direction L (since I moved left).\n\nThen possible moves: from (4,6), I can move U, D, L, R? But current direction is L, so I cannot move R (opposite).\n\nU to (4,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (4,5)\n\nL to (3,6)\n\nR cannot, opposite to current direction L.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\n(4,5) is free? Check: x=4,y=5, not wall, not obstacle. Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — none at (4,5), so free.\n\n(3,6) similarly free.\n\nIf I move to (6,6), similar situation.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to think from turn 4.\n\nAnother option at turn 4: move L to (4,5)\n\nThen at (4,5), no food there, so snake becomes [(4,5), (5,5)]? After move: head to (4,5), body to (5,5), tail (5,4) gone. Since no eating, length same.\n\nSnake: [(4,5), (5,5)]\n\nHead direction: L (since moved left).\n\nThen from (4,5), possible moves: cannot move R (opposite to L), so U, D, L.\n\nU to (4,6) — has food!\n\nD to (4,4)\n\nL to (3,5)\n\n(4,6) has food, so if I move U, I eat it.\n\nSimilarly, move R to (4,5) but that's where I am? No, moving from (4,5), U to (4,6), etc.\n\n(4,6) is above.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R from (4,5), but R is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed.\n\nSo only U, D, L.\n\nU to (4,6) with food.\n\nD to (4,4)\n\nL to (3,5)\n\n(4,4) should be free, not wall or obstacle.\n\n(3,5) free.\n\nBut (4,6) has food, so moving U would eat it at turn 5 if I moved L at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, third option: move R from (5,5) to (6,5)\n\nThen at (6,5), no food, snake [(6,5), (5,5)]\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen from (6,5), possible moves: cannot move L (opposite to R), so U, D, R.\n\nU to (6,6) — has food!\n\nD to (6,4) — but (6,4) is internal obstacle! Cannot move there.\n\nR to (7,5) — x=7 wall, cannot.\n\nSo from (6,5), only possible moves: U to (6,6) or D to (6,4) but (6,4) blocked, so only U to (6,6) which has food.\n\nSo if I move R at turn 4 to (6,5), then at turn 5 I must move U to (6,6) to eat food, no other choice.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U at turn 4 to (5,6), then at turn 5 I can move to (4,6) or (6,6) to eat food.\n\nIf I move L at turn 4 to (4,5), then at turn 5 I can move U to (4,6) to eat food.\n\nIn all cases, I can eat food at turn 5.\n\nBut I need to think long-term, beyond immediate reward.\n\nAlso, life span: all food except (6,6) has life span 6, so disappears at turn 4 + 6 = turn 10? Current turn 4, life span 6, so after 6 turns, it vanishes. Since countdown decreases each turn including current, at turn 4, life span 6 means it will be there for 6 more turns? Let's clarify.\n\nRule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t when food is present, life span N, then at turn t+1, life span N-1, and so on, until turn t+N-1 it has life span 1, then after that turn, it disappears, so not available at turn t+N.\n\nFor example, at turn 4, life span 6 for (1,6), so:\n\nTurn 4: life span 6\n\nTurn 5: life span 5\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: life span 1\n\nTurn 10: gone\n\nSimilarly for (2,1), (4,6) — all with life span 6, gone at turn 10.\n\n(6,6) life span 10, so at turn 4:10, turn 5:9, ..., turn 13:1, turn 14: gone.\n\nSince I can eat soon, life span not critical yet.\n\nNow, back to options.\n\nI need to consider which food to target and path safely.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, which might make it harder to move.\n\nCurrently snake length 2, very short.\n\nLet's list the food:\n\n- (4,6): top-left, near me\n\n- (6,6): top-right\n\n- (1,6): far left top\n\n- (2,1): bottom left\n\nAfter eating one, I need to go for others.\n\nBut internal obstacles complicate.\n\nFirst, if I move U at turn 4 to (5,6), no eat.\n\nThen at turn 5, I can:\n\n- Move L to (4,6) to eat that food. Then snake: head at (4,6), body (5,6), tail (5,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen at turn 6, from (4,6), can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6) (since U and R not possible or wall)\n\n(4,5) is free, (3,6) free.\n\nNo food at (4,5) or (3,6), so no eat.\n\nSay I move D to (4,5). Then snake: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]? After moving to (4,5) without eating, since no food, so positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), tail (5,6) — but tail was (5,5)? Before move: snake [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nHead at (4,6), move to (4,5). (4,5) has no food, so no grow. So after move: head (4,5), body moves to head position, so (4,6) becomes new body, and (5,6) becomes the body after that, and (5,5) is gone? Positions: the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to where head was, which is (4,6), but since head moved to (4,5), the segment that was at (4,6) moves to (4,5)? Let's index.\n\nBefore move: positions: index 0: head (4,6), index 1: body (5,6), index 2: tail (5,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (4,5): new head (4,5), then body segments move: the segment at index 1 moves to previous head position (4,6)? No.\n\nStandard: all body segments move one step towards the head.\n\nSo the segment that was behind head moves to where head was.\n\nIn this case, the segment at (5,6) moves to (4,6) because head was at (4,6) and it moved to (4,5), so the neck moves to the old head position.\n\nThen the tail at (5,5) moves to where the neck was, (5,6).\n\nAfter move: head at (4,5), the body segment that was at (5,6) moves to (4,6), and the tail at (5,5) moves to (5,6).\n\nSo new positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]\n\nTail at (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved to (3,6), similar.\n\nNow, at (4,5), head, direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen possible moves: cannot move U (opposite), so D, L, R.\n\nD to (4,4)\n\nL to (3,5)\n\nR to (5,5) — but (5,5) is where? In new positions, (5,5) is not occupied? Snake is at (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), so (5,5) is free.\n\n(4,4) free, (3,5) free.\n\nBut no food nearby except what's left.\n\nFood at (1,6), (2,1), (6,6)\n\n(6,6) is still there.\n\nBut from (4,5), I can go various ways.\n\nThis is getting messy. I should consider the grid fully.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nY from 6 top to 1 bottom? Usually y=0 bottom, but in coordinates, walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 bottom, y=6 top? The grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, with (1,1) bottom-left? Not specified, but in positions, snake at (5,5), food at (1,6) etc., so let's assume y=6 is top row.\n\nSo grid rows y=6 top, y=1 bottom; columns x=1 left to x=6 right.\n\nSo:\n\n- Row y=6: cells (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) food, (5,6), (6,6) food\n\n- Row y=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) head, (6,5)\n\n- Row y=4: (1,4), (2,4) obstacle, (3,4), (4,4), (5,4) tail, (6,4) obstacle\n\n- Row y=3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\n- Row y=2: (1,2) obstacle, (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)\n\n- Row y=1: (1,1), (2,1) food, (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) obstacle, (6,1) obstacle\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is at y=4, x=2, which is row 4, column 2.\n\n(1,2) is at y=2, x=1.\n\nSnake at turn 4: head (5,5), body (5,4)\n\nFood: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6), (6,6)\n\nLife spans all 6 except (6,6) is 10.\n\nNow, from (5,5), options:\n\n1. Move U to (5,6): no food, then at (5,6), I can go to (4,6) or (6,6) to eat.\n\nIf I go to (4,6), eat, snake grows to [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nThen from (4,6), I can go down to (4,5) or left to (3,6)\n\n(4,5) is empty, (3,6) empty.\n\nIf I go to (6,6) from (5,6), eat, snake [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nThen from (6,6), I can go down to (6,5) or left to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, or right, but x=7 wall, up y=7 wall, so only down to (6,5) or left to (5,6) but (5,6) occupied, so only down to (6,5) if possible.\n\n(6,5) is free, as earlier.\n\n2. Move L to (4,5): no food, snake [(4,5), (5,5)]\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go up to (4,6) to eat, or down to (4,4), or left to (3,5)\n\n(4,6) has food, so likely go up.\n\n3. Move R to (6,5): no food, snake [(6,5), (5,5)]\n\nThen from (6,5), only up to (6,6) to eat, since down to (6,4) blocked, left to (5,5) body, right wall.\n\nSo must go to (6,6) and eat at turn 5.\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to plan to eat multiple food and avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,1) and (1,6) are far, and life span 6, so I have until turn 9 to eat them.\n\n(6,6) has longer life.\n\nBut with internal obstacles, the grid has limited paths.\n\nFor example, at row y=4, (2,4) is obstacle, so I can't go through there easily.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) and (5,1), (6,1) blocked.\n\nTo go to (2,1), I need to go to bottom left.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) top left.\n\nNow, let's consider the safest and most rewarding path.\n\nFirst, if I move U to (5,6) at turn 4, then at turn 5 I can choose to go to (4,6) or (6,6).\n\nIf I go to (4,6), eat, then at (4,6), I can go down to (4,5) or left to (3,6).\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go to other places.\n\nBut I want to go to (1,6) or (2,1).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), so from (3,6) or (4,6), I can go left.\n\nBut there's obstacle at (1,2), but that's below.\n\nFrom (4,6), if I move left to (3,6), no food, then to (2,6), no food, then to (1,6) to eat.\n\nBut (2,6) is free? y=6, x=2, not obstacle, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,6), I can only go down to (6,5), then from (6,5), I can go left or down, but down to (6,4) blocked, so only left to (5,5) or up, but up is (6,6) body, so only left to (5,5).\n\nAt (6,5), after eating at (6,6), snake is [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]? Let's not confuse.\n\nAfter eating at (6,6) at turn 5, positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), tail (5,5)\n\nThen from (6,6), move down to (6,5): (6,5) has no food, so no grow, move head to (6,5), body moves: the segment at (5,6) moves to (6,6), tail at (5,5) moves to (5,6)? Positions: before move: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nMove head to (6,5): new head (6,5), then body: the segment that was at (5,6) moves to previous head position (6,6), and the tail at (5,5) moves to where the neck was, (5,6).\n\nSo new positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nTail at (5,6).\n\nThen from (6,5), head at (6,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: cannot move U (opposite), so D, L, R.\n\nD to (6,4) — but (6,4) obstacle, blocked.\n\nR to (7,5) wall, blocked.\n\nL to (5,5) — but (5,5) is now occupied by the tail? In positions, (5,5) is not in the snake; snake is at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), so (5,5) is free.\n\n(5,6) is body, but (5,5) is free.\n\nSo L to (5,5) is possible.\n\n(5,5) is free, yes.\n\nSo move L to (5,5).\n\nThen at (5,5), no food, snake becomes [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6)]? After moving to (5,5), head (5,5), body moves to (6,5), and the segment at (5,6) moves to (6,6)? Before move: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nMove head to (5,5): new head (5,5), then body: segment at (6,6) moves to where head was (6,5)? The segment behind head is at (6,6), moves to (6,5), and the segment at (5,6) moves to (6,6).\n\nSo new positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nBut this seems inefficient, and I might be trapped in the right area.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (4,6) first, I can access the left side.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,1) is bottom left, and to reach it, I need to go down, but there are obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), I can go down to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the entire grid and dead ends.\n\nNotice that with obstacles, some areas are isolated.\n\nFor instance, the bottom left: (2,1) food, but to reach it, from left side.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (1,2), so (1,1) and (1,2) are blocked? (1,2) is obstacle, so cell (1,2) is wall.\n\nAlso, (2,4) obstacle, so at row y=4, x=2 blocked.\n\nSimilarly, bottom row y=1, (5,1) and (6,1) obstacles, so only (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) accessible, but (2,1) has food.\n\n(1,1) is free? No walls except borders, but x=1, y=1, not border wall, since borders are x=0,x=7 etc., so (1,1) is playable, but is it obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) is not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) food, (3,1) free, (4,1) free.\n\nBut to reach (2,1), I need to enter from above, but at y=2, (1,2) obstacle, so I cannot go to (1,2), so from (1,1), I can only go up to (1,2)? But (1,2) is wall, so (1,1) is a dead end if I go there, because from (1,1), I can only move up to (1,2) wall, right to (2,1), or down to (1,0) wall, left to (0,1) wall. So only right to (2,1) if possible.\n\nFrom (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, blocked; D to (1,0) wall; L to (0,1) wall; R to (2,1).\n\nSo only R to (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2), D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1), R to (3,1).\n\nSo (1,1) and (2,1) are connected, but (1,1) can only be accessed from (2,1), and (2,1) from (2,2) or (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nBut (1,1) is a dead end except to (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, for (1,6) top left: (1,6) food, from (1,6), I can move D to (1,5), L to (0,6) wall, R to (2,6), U to (1,7) wall. So only D or R.\n\n(1,5) is free, (2,6) free.\n\nBut (1,5) can go to (1,4) etc.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, I should try to eat all food if possible.\n\nBut with obstacles and snake growing, it might be tight.\n\nLife span: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6) disappear at turn 10, (6,6) at turn 14.\n\nCurrent turn 4, so I have 6 turns to eat the first three, but turn 10 is last chance for them? Turn 9 life span 1, so can eat at turn 9, gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut since I can eat one at turn 5, I have time for others.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nLet's consider the option of moving L at turn 4 to (4,5).\n\nThen at turn 5, move U to (4,6) to eat food there.\n\nSo at turn 5, eat (4,6), snake grows to length 3: positions [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]? After moving to (4,6) from (4,5), let's sequence.\n\nTurn 4: move L from (5,5) to (4,5), no eat, snake becomes [(4,5), (5,5)]\n\nTurn 5: move U from (4,5) to (4,6), which has food, so eat, grow. Before move, positions [(4,5), (5,5)], head (4,5), move to (4,6), so new head (4,6), and since eating, tail (5,5) remains, so new positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]? Body segments: the segment that was at (5,5) is tail, so it stays, and we add a new segment there.\n\nPositions: head at (4,6), then the previous head (4,5) becomes body, and the previous tail (5,5) becomes the new tail, so [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nYes.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen at turn 6, from (4,6), can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6) (U and R not possible).\n\n(4,5) is occupied by body, so if I move D to (4,5), head to (4,5) which is body segment, collision.\n\n(4,5) is a body segment, so moving there would kill.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) no food, so move to (3,6), no eat, snake: head (3,6), body moves to (4,6), tail (4,5) moves to where? Before move: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nMove head to (3,6): new head (3,6), body: segment at (4,5) moves to previous head position (4,6)? The segment behind head is at (4,5), moves to (4,6), and the tail at (5,5) moves to (4,5).\n\nSo new positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen at turn 7, from (3,6), can move U, D, L, R? But current direction L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nU to (3,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5)\n\nL to (2,6)\n\nR cannot.\n\nSo move to (3,5) or (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is free, no obstacle.\n\n(3,5) free.\n\nFood at (1,6) is close, so I can go to (2,6) then to (1,6).\n\nMove to (2,6) at turn 7, no food, snake: head (2,6), body to (3,6), tail to (4,6)? Before move: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nMove head to (2,6): new head (2,6), body: segment at (4,6) moves to (3,6)? Segment behind head is at (4,6), moves to (3,6), tail at (4,5) moves to (4,6).\n\nPositions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nThen at turn 8, from (2,6), move L to (1,6) to eat food there.\n\n(1,6) has food, so eat, grow to length 4: new head (1,6), body: since eating, tail remains, so positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nTail at (4,6).\n\nThen from (1,6), head direction L.\n\nCan move D to (1,5) or R to (2,6), but (2,6) is body, so only D to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) free.\n\nMove D to (1,5), no food, snake: head (1,5), body to (1,6), tail to (2,6), etc.\n\nBut now I have eaten two food: (4,6) and (1,6).\n\nThen I need to go to (2,1) or (6,6).\n\n(2,1) is bottom left, with obstacles.\n\nFrom (1,5), I can go down to (1,4), then to (1,3), etc., but at y=2, (1,2) is obstacle, so I cannot go below (1,3) to (1,2), so from (1,3), I can go right to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,1) is at bottom, so I need to reach it from above, but at x=2, y=4 has obstacle (2,4), so the path is constrained.\n\nFor example, from (1,5), move D to (1,4), then to (1,3), then from (1,3), cannot go down to (1,2) obstacle, so must go right to (2,3), then to (2,2), then to (2,1).\n\n(2,2) is free, (2,3) free, etc.\n\nBut snake is growing, so it might be possible.\n\n(6,6) is still available with long life span.\n\nBut let's see the other option from turn 4.\n\nIf I move U at turn 4 to (5,6), then at turn 5 I can go to (4,6) or (6,6).\n\nIf I go to (4,6), similar to above, I can eat (4,6) then (1,6).\n\nIf I go to (6,6), then as before, I end up at (5,5) or something, and it might be harder to go left.\n\nFor example, if at turn 4 move U to (5,6), turn 5 move R to (6,6) eat, snake [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nThen turn 6 move D to (6,5), no eat, snake [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nThen turn 7 move L to (5,5), no eat, snake [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nNow at (5,5), head, direction L.\n\nCan move U to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, collision; D to (5,4); L to (4,5); R to (6,5) body.\n\n(5,6) is body, so cannot move U.\n\nD to (5,4), which is free? (5,4) was tail earlier, but now free.\n\n(5,4) not obstacle, so free.\n\nL to (4,5) free.\n\nR to (6,5) occupied.\n\nSo move D or L.\n\nIf move D to (5,4), no food, then snake moves.\n\nBut to go left, better move L to (4,5).\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut I have eaten only one food so far, (6,6), and (4,6) is still there, but life span to turn 10.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go up to (4,6) to eat.\n\nIn this path, at turn 7 I'm at (5,5), move to (4,5), then turn 8 to (4,6) eat, etc.\n\nBut it takes more turns to eat the left food.\n\nWhereas if I go left first, I can eat (4,6) and (1,6) quickly.\n\nThen (2,1) and (6,6) left.\n\n(2,1) is bottom left, (6,6) top right.\n\nAlso, there is the tail reward danger, but no food on tail now.\n\nAnother thing: if I eat (2,1), it's at bottom, and with obstacles, it might be risky.\n\nBut let's see if I can plan to eat all.\n\nSince (6,6) has longer life, I can eat it later.\n\nPrioritize the food that disappears sooner.\n\nAll except (6,6) disappear at turn 10, so I should eat them first.\n\n(4,6) is very close.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is on the way if I go left.\n\n(2,1) is a bit out of the way.\n\n(6,6) is on the right.\n\nSo perhaps go for (4,6) and (1,6) first.\n\nThen go down to (2,1).\n\nFinally to (6,6) if possible.\n\nBut with snake length, after eating two food, length 4, it might be tight.\n\nInitial length 2, eat one, length 3, eat another, length 4.\n\nGrid is 6x6 minus obstacles, so 36 cells minus borders, but playable cells: x1-6, y1-6, 36 cells.\n\nWalls: borders are not cells, so the grid has cells from (1,1) to (6,6), 6x6=36 cells.\n\nInternal obstacles: 5 cells blocked, so 31 free cells.\n\nBut walls are the borders, so cells like (1,1) are playable, but surrounded.\n\nNumber of free cells: total cells 36, internal obstacles 5, so 31 free cells.\n\nSnake can occupy up to 31 cells, but with movement, it might not reach all.\n\nFor example, (1,1) is free but dead end.\n\n(2,1) can be accessed.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nAt turn 4, move L to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 5, move U to (4,6) eat.\n\nThen turn 6, move L to (3,6) as only choice.\n\nThen turn 7, from (3,6), I can move to (2,6) or (3,5).\n\nTo go to (1,6), better move L to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 8, move L to (1,6) eat.\n\nNow snake length 4, positions [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] after eating.\n\nAt turn 8, after moving to (1,6) and eating, positions: head (1,6), body (2,6), (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 9, move D to (1,5) as only choice, no food.\n\nSnake: head to (1,5), body moves: segment at (2,6) to (1,6), (3,6) to (2,6), tail (4,6) to (3,6)? Positions: before move: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nMove head to (1,5): new head (1,5), body: segment at (2,6) moves to (1,6), segment at (3,6) moves to (2,6), segment at (4,6) moves to (3,6).\n\nSo [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nTail at (3,6).\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen turn 10, from (1,5), can move D to (1,4), L to (0,5) wall, R to (2,5), U to (1,6) body.\n\nSo only D or R.\n\n(1,4) free, (2,5) free.\n\nNow, I need to go to (2,1), which is below.\n\nBut (1,2) obstacle, so I must go to (2,5) or something.\n\nMove D to (1,4).\n\nThen to (1,3), then cannot go to (1,2), so must go right to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut at turn 10, the food (2,1) still exists? Life span: at turn 4, life span 6, so turn 10: life span 0? Turn 4:6, turn 5:5, turn 6:4, turn 7:3, turn 8:2, turn 9:1, turn 10: gone, so at turn 10, (2,1) is gone.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) gone, (1,6) gone.\n\nOnly (6,6) left with life span 10, at turn 10 life span 10 - (10-4) = let's calculate.\n\nAt turn t, life span decreases by (t - t_initial) or something.\n\nAt turn 4, life span 6 for (2,1), so it was spawned earlier? But we don't know, but at turn 4, it has 6 turns left including turn 4.\n\nSo after 6 turns, it disappears at the end of turn 9? Rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life span N, then it exists at turn t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n\nFor (2,1): at turn 4, life span 6, so exists at turns 4,5,6,7,8,9. Disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, can be eaten at turn 9 latest.\n\nIn my path, at turn 8 I ate (1,6), turn 9 I moved to (1,5), not to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is far, I cannot reach it by turn 9.\n\nFrom (1,5) at turn 9, (2,1) is at distance |1-2| + |5-1| =1+4=5, but I have only one move to turn 10, but at turn 10 it's gone, so I need to eat at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at (1,5), and (2,1) is at (2,1), which is 4 steps away in Manhattan distance, since I need to go down and right, but obstacles, so I cannot reach in one move.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,1) in time; it will disappear before I can reach it.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone directly to (2,1) earlier, but from start, at turn 4, (5,5) to (2,1) is |5-2| + |5-1| =3+4=7, so at least 7 moves, but I have only until turn 9 to eat, so from turn 4 to turn 9, 5 moves, I can move 5 steps, but 7>5, so I cannot reach (2,1) by turn 9.\n\nTurn 4 to turn 9 is 5 turns: turn 4,5,6,7,8,9 — that's 6 moves? Turns: at turn t, I move.\n\nAt turn 4, I am at (5,5), I make a move to new position.\n\nAfter move, it's turn 5, etc.\n\nTo be at a cell at turn t, I need to move there at turn t.\n\nTo eat at turn t, I need to move to the food cell at turn t.\n\nFor (2,1), I need to be at (2,1) on or before turn 9.\n\nFrom (5,5) at turn 4, after k moves, I can be at a cell within Manhattan distance k.\n\n(2,1) is distance |5-2| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7 from (5,5).\n\nSo I need at least 7 moves to reach it.\n\nBut from turn 4 to turn 9, I have 5 moves: turn 4,5,6,7,8 — at turn 8 I can be there if I go directly, but 7 moves? Let's count the turns.\n\nAt turn 4, before move, at (5,5).\n\nAfter turn 4 move, at new position for turn 5.\n\nAfter turn 5 move, at position for turn 6.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn k move, at position for turn k+1.\n\nTo be at (2,1) at turn t, I need to move there at turn t.\n\nSo for turn 9, I move to (2,1) at turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 4 to turn 9, I can make 5 moves: turn 4,5,6,7,8 — that's 5 moves, to be at position at turn 9.\n\nBut Manhattan distance 7, which requires at least 7 moves, so impossible to reach (2,1) by turn 9 with 5 moves? Moves: with 5 moves, I can be up to distance 5 away.\n\n(2,1) is distance 7, so I cannot reach it at all within the life span, because even at turn 4, distance 7, and I have only 5 moves until turn 9 (moves at 4,5,6,7,8), so maximum I can cover is 5 cells away, but (5,5) to (2,1) is 7, so unreachable in time.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,6): from (5,5) to (1,6) is |5-1| + |5-6| =4 +1=5, so with 5 moves, I can reach it at turn 9 if I go directly.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,5) turn 4, then L to (3,5) turn 5, but I need to go up.\n\nIn my earlier path, I did reach (1,6) at turn 8.\n\nTurn 4: to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: to (4,6) but I ate (4,6), not direct to (1,6).\n\nTo go directly to (1,6) without eating (4,6), but (4,6) is on the way.\n\nFrom (5,5), move L to (4,5) turn 4\n\nThen U to (4,6) turn 5, but (4,6) has food, so I eat it, not avoid.\n\nI could go around, but it takes more moves.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) move L to (4,5) turn 4\n\nThen D to (4,4) turn 5, then L to (3,4) turn 6, then U to (3,5) turn 7, etc., but this is slower to (1,6).\n\nSo better to eat (4,6) on the way.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,1), it's too far, distance 7, with 5 moves max to turn 9, impossible, so I cannot eat (2,1) at all; it will disappear before I can reach it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) and (1,6) I can eat, as in the path.\n\n(6,6) I can eat later.\n\nSo in this case, (2,1) is not reachable in time, so I should ignore it.\n\nFocus on eating (4,6) and (1,6), then (6,6).\n\nNow for (6,6), life span 10, disappears at turn 14, so I have time.\n\nBack to turn 4.\n\nIf I move L to (4,5) at turn 4, then U to (4,6) at turn 5 to eat, then L to (3,6) at turn 6, then L to (2,6) at turn 7, then L to (1,6) at turn 8 to eat.\n\nThen at turn 9, from (1,6) move D to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 10, from (1,5) I can move D to (1,4) or R to (2,5)\n\nNow, to go to (6,6), I need to head right and up.\n\nBut snake is at [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] after turn 10 move? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 8: ate (1,6), positions [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nTurn 9: move D to (1,5), no food, so snake: head to (1,5), body: segment at (2,6) to (1,6), at (3,6) to (2,6), at (4,6) to (3,6), so [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nTurn 10: from (1,5), move say R to (2,5) or D to (1,4)\n\n(2,5) is free.\n\nMove R to (2,5), no food, snake: head (2,5), body to (1,5), (1,6) to (1,5)? Positions: before: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nMove head to (2,5): new head (2,5), body: segment at (1,6) moves to (1,5), segment at (2,6) moves to (1,6)? The segment behind head is at (1,6), moves to where head was (1,5), then segment at (2,6) moves to where that segment was, (1,6), and segment at (3,6) moves to (2,6).\n\nSo new positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]\n\nTail at (2,6).\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move to other places to go to (6,6).\n\nBut there is obstacle at (2,4), so I cannot go down from (2,5) to (2,4), blocked.\n\nSo from (2,5), can move U to (2,6) but (2,6) is body, collision; D to (2,4) obstacle; L to (1,5) body; R to (3,5)\n\nSo only R to (3,5)\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut it will take several moves to reach (6,6).\n\nIf at turn 4 I move U to (5,6), then to (6,6) at turn 5, eat, then I can go left to eat (4,6) and (1,6).\n\nBut (4,6) disappears at turn 10, so I need to eat it by turn 9.\n\nFrom (6,6) at turn 5, after eating, I am at (6,6), then move to (6,5) at turn 6, then to (5,5) at turn 7, then to (4,5) at turn 8, then to (4,6) at turn 9 to eat just in time.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can go to (3,6) etc. to (1,6), but (1,6) disappears at turn 10, so at turn 10 I need to be at (1,6), but from (4,6) at turn 9, to (1,6) is distance 3, so at turn 10 I can be at (3,6), turn 11 at (2,6), turn 12 at (1,6), but at turn 10 (1,6) is gone, so I cannot eat it.\n\nThus, in this case, if I eat (6,6) first, I miss (1,6) and possibly (4,6) if not careful, but I can eat (4,6) at turn 9.\n\nIn the first path, I ate both (4,6) and (1,6).\n\n(6,6) I can eat later.\n\nSo better to go left first.\n\nMoreover, with the obstacles, the left side might be safer.\n\nAt turn 4, move L to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 5 move U to (4,6) eat.\n\nThen turn 6 move L to (3,6) (only choice)\n\nTurn 7 move L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 8 move L to (1,6) eat.\n\nNow at turn 8, after eating (1,6), snake length 4, positions [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 9: move D to (1,5) (only choice, since U wall, R body, L wall)\n\nNo food.\n\nPositions: head (1,5), body: (2,6) to (1,6), (3,6) to (2,6), (4,6) to (3,6), so [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nTurn 10: from (1,5), can move D to (1,4) or R to (2,5)\n\nI need to go to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at top right, so I should head right and up.\n\nBut I am at (1,5), so move R to (2,5).\n\nThen positions: head to (2,5), body: (1,6) to (1,5), (2,6) to (1,6), (3,6) to (2,6), so [(2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]\n\nTurn 11: from (2,5), only R to (3,5) as before.\n\nMove to (3,5), no food.\n\nPositions: head (3,5), body: (1,5) to (2,5), (1,6) to (1,5)? Before: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)]\n\nMove head to (3,5): new head (3,5), body: segment at (1,5) moves to (2,5), segment at (1,6) moves to (1,5), segment at (2,6) moves to (1,6), so [(3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,6)]\n\nTail at (1,6).\n\nThen from (3,5), can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5) body, R to (4,5)\n\n(3,6) is free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nBut I want to go right.\n\nMove R to (4,5).\n\nThen to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut (6,6) is there, so I can go up to (4,6) but (4,6) is gone, or directly to (6,6) via (5,6) etc.\n\nBut (5,6) might be free.\n\nSince (6,6) has life until turn 14, I have time.\n\nBut I need to output a sequence for several turns.\n\nSince the answer should start from turn 4, and think 5+ ahead, so for about 5-10 turns.\n\nAlso, for the move at turn 4, based on above, moving L seems good to access the left food.\n\nIf I move U or R, I might not get both left food.\n\nSo I think move L at turn 4.\n\nThen sequence:\n\nTurn 4: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5: U to (4,6) eat\n\nTurn 6: L to (3,6)  // only choice\n\nAt turn 6, from (4,6), after eating, I moved L to (3,6)\n\nThen turn 7: from (3,6), I can move to (2,6) or (3,5), but to go to (1,6), better to (2,6)\n\nSo move L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 8: L to (1,6) eat\n\nThen turn 9: D to (1,5)\n\nNow, for turn 10, from (1,5), I can move R to (2,5) or D to (1,4)\n\nTo go towards (6,6), better move R to (2,5)\n\nThen beyond, but I think for the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nSince the food (2,1) is unreachable, I don't need to worry.\n\n(6,6) can be eaten later, but for the sequence, I can stop after a few moves.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for several turns.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ ahead, I should provide up to turn 9 or 10.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nAlso, for the initial move, I think L is best.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving U to (5,6) then to (4,6) is similar.\n\nIf move U at turn 4 to (5,6), no eat.\n\nThen turn 5, I can move L to (4,6) eat, then same as above from turn 5 onwards.\n\nBut at turn 4 I moved to (5,6) instead of (4,5), but then from (4,6) at turn 5, I go to (3,6) at turn 6, etc., same as above from turn 6.\n\nIn terms of sequence, moving L at turn 4 gets me to (4,5) and then eat at turn 5, whereas moving U to (5,6) then to (4,6) eat at turn 5, but I am at (4,6) at turn 5, same as if I moved L then U, but when I move L then U, at turn 5 I am at (4,6) after eating, same position.\n\nBut in the move to (5,6) first, at turn 4 I didn't eat, but at turn 5 I eat, so same effect, but I have one extra move to (5,6).\n\nBut in both cases, I can reach (1,6) at turn 8.\n\nWith move U at turn 4: turn 4 to (5,6), turn 5 to (4,6) eat, turn 6 to (3,6), turn 7 to (2,6), turn 8 to (1,6) eat.\n\nSame as moving L: turn 4 to (4,5), turn 5 to (4,6) eat, turn 6 to (3,6), turn 7 to (2,6), turn 8 to (1,6) eat.\n\nSo identical from turn 5 onwards except the position at turn 4.\n\nBut moving L directly might be slightly better as I don't go to (5,6) unnecessarily.\n\nBut both work.\n\nSince head direction, after moving L, direction is L, but when I move U to (4,6), it changes.\n\nBut not critical.\n\nFor turn 4, I think L or U both can lead to eating (4,6) and (1,6).\n\nBut with U, I have the option to go to (6,6) instead, but that might miss (1,6).\n\nSo to ensure both, moving L or U to (4,6) is fine.\n\nI think moving L at turn 4 is a good start.\n\nThen for the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: L (left)\n\nTurn 5: U (up) to eat (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: L (left) to (3,6)\n\nTurn 7: L (left) to (2,6)\n\nTurn 8: L (left) to (1,6) eat\n\nTurn 9: D (down) to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 10, I need to choose, say R to (2,5) to head right.\n\nBut for the output, I can provide up to turn 9 or 10.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", and output the sequence, I'll provide from turn 4 to turn 9, which is 6 moves.\n\nTurn 4 to turn 9 is 6 actions.\n\nt1=4, so turns 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nActions: L, U, L, L, L, D\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 6, moving to (3,6), etc.\n\nNow, to avoid risk, this path seems safe, no immediate danger.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger not applicable.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while prioritizing long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead (from turn 4 to turn 9). The strategy focuses on safely consuming the accessible positive food (specifically (4,6) and (1,6)) within their lifespan, while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body. The food at (2,1) is unreachable by turn 9 (its disappearance turn) due to Manhattan distance constraints, so it is ignored. The food at (6,6) has a longer lifespan (disappears at turn 14) and can be targeted after this sequence.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Current State (Turn 4)**: \n  - Snake head at (5,5), direction Up.\n  - Snake body at (5,4); only two segments, so the tail is at (5,4).\n  - Food available: (1,6) and (4,6) with lifespan 6 (disappear at turn 10), (2,1) with lifespan 6 (disappear at turn 10, but unreachable), (6,6) with lifespan 10 (disappear at turn 14).\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - Cannot reverse direction instantly (e.g., from Up, cannot move Down next).\n  - From (5,5), possible moves: Up (U) to (5,6), Left (L) to (4,5), or Right (R) to (6,5). Down is invalid (reverse).\n- **Collision Risks**: \n  - Walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) must be avoided.\n  - Body collision: Moving into a body segment is deadly, except the tail (which moves away after growth). The tail is safe to move into only if no food is on it (no tail reward danger here).\n- **Food Access**:\n  - (4,6) can be eaten at turn 5 by moving Up from (4,5) or Left from (5,6).\n  - (1,6) can be eaten by turn 8 via a leftward path along y=6.\n  - (2,1) is Manhattan distance 7 from (5,5) and requires 7 moves, but only 5 moves are available by turn 9 (last eatable turn); thus, it is unreachable and skipped.\n  - (6,6) is preserved for later due to its long lifespan.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - The path avoids dead ends (e.g., bottom-left area near (1,1) is risky due to (1,2) obstacle) and focuses on open areas.\n  - After eating, snake growth is managed by moving toward less constrained regions.\n- **Sequence Justification**:\n  - **Turn 4 (Move L to (4,5))**: Moves toward (4,6) food efficiently. Alternative U to (5,6) is valid but less direct for accessing (1,6).\n  - **Turn 5 (Move U to (4,6))**: Eats (4,6) (+1 score, length 3). Only safe move from (4,5) to avoid starvation; moving Down or Left delays food access.\n  - **Turn 6 (Move L to (3,6))**: Only safe move from (4,6) (Down causes body collision; Up and Right invalid). Positions for (1,6) access.\n  - **Turn 7 (Move L to (2,6))**: Continues path to (1,6). Moving Down to (3,5) is possible but detours and risks missing (1,6) lifespan.\n  - **Turn 8 (Move L to (1,6))**: Eats (1,6) (+1 score, length 4). Only safe move (Down is only alternative but delays eating).\n  - **Turn 9 (Move D to (1,5))**: Only safe move from (1,6) (Up wall, Left wall, Right body collision). Prepares to exit the top-left area toward (6,6) later.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence below ensures two food are eaten by turn 8, with a cumulative +2 score and snake length 4. Moves are chosen to minimize risk and align with the grid layout.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: L (left)  \nTurn 5: U (up)  \nTurn 6: L (left)  \nTurn 7: L (left)  \nTurn 8: L (left)  \nTurn 9: D (down)  \n}\n\n### Next Steps (Beyond Turn 9):\n- From (1,5) at turn 9, move Right to (2,5) at turn 10 to avoid the dead end at (1,1) and head toward (6,6).\n- (6,6) can be eaten by turn 12-14 via a path like (2,5) → (3,5) → (4,5) → (5,5) → (5,6) → (6,6), but this requires further planning based on the state.\n- Always verify moves 5+ turns ahead for new food spawns or risks, but no new food is mentioned in the state.",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current turn is t_1 = 5.\n\nWalls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I can't move into these cells.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,5), and there's one body segment at (5,5). So the snake is only 2 segments long right now. Head direction is L, which is left, so it's moving left.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,6) with value 1 and life_span 5. Since it's turn 5, life_span decreases each turn including current, so after turn 5, it has 4 turns left? Life_span is given as 5, meaning it disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 5, if a food has life_span N, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for a food with life_span N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t. After turn t + N - 1, it disappears. For example, if at turn t, life_span is N, then at turn t, countdown is N, at turn t+1, it's N-1, ..., at turn t+N-1, it's 1, and after that, it's gone. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+N-1.\n\nIn the input, for food, it's (x,y, life_span, value). Looking back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (1, 6, 5, 1)\" – I think it's (x,y, life_span, value). But in the text, it says \"(1, 6, 5, 1)\", which might be (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, others: (2,1,5,1), (4,6,5,1), (6,6,9,1). Value is 1 for all except the last one? No: (6,6,9,1) – life_span 9, value 1? But it says value, so (x,y, life_span, value) for each.\n\nIn the list: (1,6,5,1) means x=1,y=6, life_span=5, value=1\n\n(2,1,5,1) x=2,y=1, life_span=5, value=1\n\n(4,6,5,1) x=4,y=6, life_span=5, value=1\n\n(6,6,9,1) x=6,y=6, life_span=9, value=1\n\nAll have value 1, so all positive food? The rule says positive food has value +1, negative has -1. Here all are value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food in this state.\n\nValue is given as 1 for all, so all are positive food.\n\nNow, at turn 5, life_span for first three is 5, so they will disappear after turn 5 + 5 - 1 = turn 9? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn t, with life_span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it is removed before turn t + N. Since countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nAssume: at the start of turn t, the food is present with countdown C. After the turn, if not eaten, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – but it might be ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps: when the food is spawned, it has life_span N. At each turn, including the turn it spawns, the countdown decreases. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before the next.\n\nTo simplify, I think for planning, a food with life_span N at turn t can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive. For example, if N=1, it can only be eaten on turn t, then disappears.\n\nHere, at turn 5, food at (1,6): life_span=5, so countdown=5. After turn 5, if not eaten, countdown becomes 4, and so on, until after turn 9, countdown=0, and it disappears before turn 10? Turn 5: countdown=5, after turn 5 (i.e., before turn 6), countdown dec to 4. Turn 6: countdown=4, ..., turn 9: countdown=1, after turn 9, countdown dec to 0, disappears before turn 10.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turns 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1) and (4,6), life_span=5, so available turns 5 to 9.\n\n(6,6) life_span=9, so available turns 5 to 13.\n\nNow, snake is at [(4,5), (5,5)], head at (4,5), moving left. So current direction is L.\n\nI need to choose actions for turn 5, turn 6, etc., but since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, what are possible moves from current position.\n\nHead at (4,5), direction L, so moving left.\n\nPossible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly? Current direction is L, opposite is R, so I cannot move right on the next turn, but I can move up, down, or continue left.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo from L, I cannot go R immediately. But I can go U, D, or L.\n\nNow, grid size: walls at borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so valid x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Borders are walls, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n\nx from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. So cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo blocked cells: all border cells and these internals.\n\nBorder cells: for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7), but since it's a grid, cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nPlus internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow, snake head at (4,5), body at (5,5).\n\nFood at: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6), (6,6)\n\n(4,6) is above the head? Head at (4,5), so (4,6) is directly above, one cell up.\n\n(1,6) is left and up, (2,1) is down and left, (6,6) is right and up.\n\nSince snake is short, only 2 segments, no body collision risk except with itself.\n\nAlso, tail is at (5,5), which will move when snake moves.\n\nI need to think about eating food.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves from current position (4,5).\n\nCurrent direction: L, so I can move U, D, L, but not R (opposite).\n\nMove U: to (4,6). Is (4,6) occupied? Food is at (4,6), but food can be eaten, so it's free except for the food, which we can move onto to eat.\n\nBut we need to check if it's safe.\n\n(4,6): is there a wall? x=4,y=6, y=6 is border? y=7 is wall, y=6 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. Similarly, x=4 between 1 and 6. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) – none at (4,6), so (4,6) is free except for food.\n\nFood at (4,6) is present, so moving to (4,6) would eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n\nValue +1, so snake length increases to 3.\n\nBut after eating, when snake grows, the tail doesn't move that turn? Standard snake: when you eat, the tail grows after moving, so the new segment is added at the position where the food was, but since head moves to food, and body follows, the tail stays or something.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length +1, so after moving to food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn, effectively the new segment is added at the previous tail position or something.\n\nTypically in snake: when head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail end, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So the snake becomes longer.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose positions [head, body, ..., tail]\n\nAfter moving in a direction, if no food, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of the one ahead, tail leaves its cell.\n\nIf food eaten, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the old tail position, so tail stays, and snake grows.\n\nIn this case, snake is [ (4,5), (5,5) ] with head at (4,5), tail at (5,5).\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), which has food.\n\nSo after move: head moves to (4,6), body moves to (4,5), and since food eaten, new tail added at (5,5), so snake becomes [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ].\n\nThen next turn, tail will move when head moves.\n\nSimilarly, if no food, moving left to (3,5): head to (3,5), body to (4,5), tail at (5,5) leaves, so new positions [ (3,5), (4,5) ].\n\nNow, back to moves from (4,5):\n\n- Move U (up): to (4,6). This cell has food, so eat it, snake grows to length 3.\n\n- Move D (down): to (4,4). Is (4,4) free? y=4, not border, x=4, not wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4) but not (4,4), so free, no food there, so just move, snake remains length 2, positions [ (4,4), (4,5) ] after move? Move: head to (4,4), body to (4,5), tail (5,5) gone, so [ (4,4), (4,5) ]\n\n- Move L (left): to (3,5). Similarly, free? x=3,y=5, no wall, no obstacle, no food, so move to (3,5), positions [ (3,5), (4,5) ]\n\nCannot move R, opposite direction.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, food life spans: all foods have value 1, so all good to eat, but need to avoid dangers.\n\nOne danger is Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (5,5), head at (4,5), so adjacent? They are adjacent horizontally.\n\nHead at (4,5), tail at (5,5), so distance is 1, adjacent.\n\nAnd if tail cell has food? Currently, tail cell (5,5) – is there food? Food positions: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6), (6,6). Not (5,5), so no food at tail, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut if I were to eat food at tail position, it would be dangerous, but here no food.\n\nNow, for move U to (4,6): that has food, so I eat it, and snake grows.\n\nBut after eating, the new tail is at (5,5), head at (4,6), which are not adjacent, so no collision.\n\nNow, let's plan.\n\nI should consider the food locations and their life spans.\n\n(4,6) is very close, one step up, and life_span 5, but at turn 5, so it will disappear after turn 9, but I can eat it now.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), life_span 5, so available until turn 9.\n\n(2,1) at (2,1), down left, life_span 5.\n\n(6,6) at (6,6), life_span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nSince snake is short, I can go for nearby food.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nFor example, (1,2) is near (2,1) food, but (2,1) is food, (1,2) is obstacle.\n\n(5,1) obstacle, (6,1) obstacle, (2,4) obstacle, (6,4) obstacle.\n\nNow, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid rows y=0 to 7, walls y=0 and y=7.\n\nColumns x=0 to 7, walls x=0 and x=7.\n\nPlayable: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nFood: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6), (6,6)\n\nSnake: head (4,5), body (5,5)\n\nFrom (4,5), if I move U to (4,6), eat food, grow to length 3, positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nThen, from there, I can move.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 5, then turn 6, etc., but since it's a plan, I should decide the sequence.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from current turn t_1=5.\n\nSo for turn 5, action; turn 6 action; and so on, but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the output should be a sequence of actions for multiple turns, I think until I have a plan or for a few turns.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t_1: action, Turn t_1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many. I think I need to provide a sequence for at least the next 5 turns or so, but it might be flexible. Since it's a plan, I can provide actions for as long as I can, but practically, for 5-6 turns.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate multiple steps.\n\nFirst, possible actions at turn 5.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (4,6) - eat food, grow to length 3.\n\nThen positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nNow, from here, direction: I moved U, so current direction U.\n\nCan move U, D, L, R? But no instant reverse, so cannot move D (opposite of U).\n\nSo can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,7): but y=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\nL to (3,6): is it free? x=3,y=6, not border, obstacles: (2,4) but not (3,6), so free, no food, so move there.\n\nR to (5,6): x=5,y=6, not border, obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), not (5,6), so free, no food.\n\nFood at (6,6) but not (5,6).\n\nSo from (4,6), after eating, I can move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\nIf I move L to (3,6), positions: head to (3,6), body to (4,6), tail to (4,5)? After growth, positions: after eating at turn 5, snake is [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ]\n\nThen move, say turn 6, move L to (3,6): head to (3,6), body to (4,6), tail to (4,5)? Movement: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the one ahead.\n\nSo from [head: (4,6), seg1: (4,5), seg2: (5,5)] \n\nMove head to (3,6), then seg1 moves to (4,6), seg2 moves to (4,5), and since no food, tail is removed, but seg2 was tail, moves to (4,5), so new positions [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) ] and tail at (4,5) now.\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (5,6), head to (5,6), seg1 to (4,6), seg2 to (4,5), so [ (5,6), (4,6), (4,5) ]\n\nNow, back to turn 5 choices.\n\nOption 2: move D to (4,4)\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), tail gone? Move: head to (4,4), body to (4,5), so snake [ (4,4), (4,5) ], length 2.\n\nDirection: moved D, so current direction D.\n\nThen can move D, L, R (not U, opposite).\n\nMove D to (4,3): free? y=3, not border, no obstacle, no food.\n\nMove L to (3,4): free.\n\nMove R to (5,4): but (5,4) - is it free? x=5,y=4, obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (5,4) not listed, so free? Obstacles are (6,4), etc., not (5,4), so free.\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, (5,4) not, so free.\n\nOption 3: move L to (3,5)\n\nThen positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), snake length 2.\n\nDirection: moved L, so current direction L.\n\nCan move U, D, L (not R, opposite).\n\nMove U to (3,6): free, no food.\n\nMove D to (3,4): free.\n\nMove L to (2,5): but (2,5) - is it free? x=2,y=5, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not, so free? (2,4) is obstacle, so (2,5) is different cell, so free.\n\nBut (2,4) is occupied, but (2,5) is above it, so free.\n\nNow, I need to consider which food to target.\n\n(4,6) is very close, and I can eat it now with move U.\n\nBut let's see the life spans. (4,6) has life_span 5 at turn 5, so it will disappear after turn 9, so I have until turn 9 to eat it. But it's right there, so eating now is efficient.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is at (1,6), which is top-left, (2,1) bottom-left, (6,6) top-right.\n\nSince snake is at (4,5), moving left, I can go for (4,6) directly.\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nIf I eat (4,6), snake grows to 3, then I have more body, might be harder to maneuver.\n\nBut currently, with length 2, it's easy.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating immediately if it causes problems, but here no immediate problem.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,6) might be under the snake? No, snake is at (4,5) and (5,5), so (4,6) is free.\n\nRule about food under body: but here not under body.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: not applicable now.\n\nSo moving U to eat (4,6) seems good.\n\nThen I can plan from there.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nLet's simulate eating at turn 5.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (4,6), eat food, snake now [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ], length 3, direction U (since moved up).\n\nTurn 6: from (4,6), can move U, but (4,7) wall, invalid. Can move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\nLet's say I move L to (3,6).\n\nThen positions: head to (3,6), body to (4,6), tail to (4,5)? As before, [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) ]\n\nNo food at (3,6), so length still 3.\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow turn 7: from (3,6), direction L, can move U, D, L (not R).\n\nMove U to (3,7): wall, invalid.\n\nMove D to (3,5): free, no food.\n\nMove L to (2,6): (2,6) - free? x=2,y=6, not border, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,6) is different, so free. Food? (1,6) is food, but (2,6) not food.\n\nSo move to (2,6) or (3,5).\n\nIf I move L to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (4,6)? From [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) ] move head to (2,6), seg1 to (3,6), seg2 to (4,6), so new [ (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ] and tail at (4,6).\n\n(4,5) is gone.\n\nNow, food at (1,6) is adjacent, at (1,6).\n\nAt turn 7, head at (2,6), tail at (4,6), not adjacent.\n\nIf I move to (1,6) from (2,6), but at turn 7, I can move L to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) has food, so eat it.\n\nBut is there tail reward danger? Head at (2,6), tail at (4,6), not adjacent, so no problem.\n\nAfter eating (1,6), snake grows, new tail at old tail position or something.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nAt turn 7, if head at (2,6), and I move L to (1,6), which has food.\n\nThen head to (1,6), body to (2,6), tail to (3,6)? Positions before move: [head: (2,6), seg1: (3,6), seg2: (4,6)]\n\nMove head to (1,6), eat food, so head to (1,6), seg1 moves to (2,6), seg2 moves to (3,6), and since food eaten, new segment added, so snake becomes [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ] with new tail at (4,6).\n\nNo collision.\n\nThen I have eaten two foods, length 4.\n\nBut this is after turn 7.\n\nBack to turn 6, after eating (4,6) at turn 5.\n\nAt turn 6, from (4,6), I could move R to (5,6) instead.\n\n(5,6) is free, no food.\n\nThen positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)? [ (5,6), (4,6), (4,5) ]\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 7: from (5,6), direction R, can move U, D, R (not L, opposite).\n\nU to (5,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (5,5): (5,5) - is it free? x=5,y=5, not border, obstacles: (5,1) but not (5,5), so free. But (5,5) was previous tail, but now empty.\n\nNo food at (5,5).\n\nR to (6,6): (6,6) has food! So I can move to (6,6) and eat it.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nHead at (5,6), tail at (4,5)? Positions: [head: (5,6), seg1: (4,6), seg2: (4,5)]\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nDistance to head: (5,6) to (4,5), not adjacent, since |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent means sharing edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n\nMove to (6,6), eat food, grow.\n\nThen snake becomes [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5) ] with new tail at (4,5).\n\nThen I have eaten two foods quickly.\n\nBut at (6,6), there is food with life_span 9, so I can eat it now.\n\nIn this case, by moving U at turn 5, then at turn 6, if I move R, I can eat (6,6) at turn 7? Turn 6: from (4,6) move R to (5,6), no eat.\n\nThen turn 7: from (5,6) move R to (6,6), eat.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the first path, moving L, I can eat (1,6) later.\n\nBut (1,6) has shorter life, same as (4,6), life_span 5, so available until turn 9.\n\nNow, what about the food at (2,1)? It's at bottom-left, might be harder to reach.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles.\n\nAnother option: at turn 5, instead of moving U, I could move L to (3,5).\n\nThen positions [ (3,5), (4,5) ], direction L.\n\nThen I can go towards (2,1) or other.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is down left.\n\nBut from (3,5), move L to (2,5), then D to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle! (2,4) is internal obstacle, so I cannot go to (2,4).\n\nFrom (2,5), I can only move U, D, L, but L to (1,5), D to (2,4) invalid, U to (2,6), etc.\n\n(2,1) is at y=1, so I need to go down.\n\nBut from (3,5), if I move D to (3,4), then to (3,3), etc., but (2,1) is far.\n\nAnd obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, so to reach (2,1), I need to go around, like via (1,1) or (3,1), but (3,1) free? Obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), (1,2), so (3,1) is free.\n\nBut it might take many turns, and (2,1) has life_span 5, so available until turn 9, but I need to reach it soon.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (4,6) first, I might not have time for (2,1), but (2,1) is low priority if I can get others.\n\n(6,6) has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut since all value 1, I should get the closest ones.\n\n(4,6) is closest.\n\nMoreover, if I don't eat it now, it might disappear or I might not come back.\n\nBut I have until turn 9.\n\nBut to think long-term, I should eat it now to grow, which might help later.\n\nAnother risk: after eating (4,6), if I move to (3,6) or (5,6), both seem fine.\n\nBut let's see the obstacles.\n\nFor example, if I go left to (3,6), then I can go to (1,6) to eat that food.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is corner, might be risky if snake is long.\n\nBut now short.\n\nSimilarly, if I go right to (5,6), then to (6,6), eat that.\n\n(6,6) is also corner.\n\nNow, internal obstacles: (6,4) is near (6,6), (5,1), etc.\n\nBut since I'm at top, I can navigate.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid corners if possible.\n\nBut with planning, it should be ok.\n\nAnother food: (2,1) at bottom, but it might be harder to reach from here.\n\nLet's estimate turns to reach (2,1) from (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,5) to (2,1): dx=2 left, dy=4 down, so min 6 moves, but with obstacles, need path.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,5), then D to (3,4), D to (3,3), D to (3,2), but (3,2): is it free? y=2, obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) not, so free.\n\nThen from (3,2), move L to (2,2)? (2,2) free? obstacles: (2,4) but not (2,2), so free, then D to (2,1), but (2,1) has food, so eat.\n\nBut (2,1) is food, so when I move to it, I eat.\n\nBut at (2,2), move D to (2,1), eat.\n\nBut number of moves: from (4,5) to (3,5): turn 5 move L\n\nThen (3,5) to (3,4): turn 6 move D\n\n(3,4) to (3,3): turn 7 move D\n\n(3,3) to (3,2): turn 8 move D\n\n(3,2) to (2,2): turn 9 move L? Or directly to (2,1) but not adjacent directly from (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,2) to (2,1): not adjacent, so need two moves, e.g., to (2,2) then (2,1).\n\n(2,2) to (2,1) is adjacent.\n\nBut (2,1) life_span 5 at turn 5, so available until turn 9? Turn 9 is last to eat.\n\nAt turn 9, I need to be at (2,1) to eat.\n\nIn this path, at turn 9, I can be at (2,2), then turn 10 move to (2,1), but turn 10 might be too late.\n\nTurn 5: at (4,5), move L to (3,5) — turn 5 action, after move at (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (2,2) — now at (2,2)\n\nThen to eat (2,1), I need to move to (2,1) on turn 10.\n\nBut (2,1) disappears after turn 9? Earlier calculation.\n\nAt turn 5, life_span=5, countdown=5.\n\nAfter turn 5, if not eaten, countdown=4.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 8, countdown=1? Turn 5: countdown=5\n\nAfter turn 5 (before turn 6), countdown=4\n\nTurn 6: countdown=4\n\nAfter turn 6, countdown=3\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: countdown=1 (during turn 9)\n\nAfter turn 9, countdown=0, disappears before turn 10.\n\nSo (2,1) can be eaten on turn 9, countdown=1, after eating, it's gone.\n\nOn turn 10, it is not there.\n\nSo to eat (2,1), I must be on (2,1) on turn 9 or before.\n\nIn the path above, on turn 9, I am at (2,2), so I can move to (2,1) on turn 9 to eat it.\n\nTurn 9 action: move from (2,2) to (2,1), eat.\n\nYes.\n\nBut from (4,5) to (2,1) in 4 moves? Turn 5 move to (3,5), turn 6 to (3,4), turn 7 to (3,3), turn 8 to (3,2), turn 9 to (2,1)? From (3,2) to (2,1) directly? (3,2) to (2,1) is left and down, diagonal, not adjacent; I can only move to adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2), etc.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is down-left from (3,2), but not directly adjacent; I need to move to (2,2) or (3,1) first.\n\n(3,1) is free? y=1, not border, obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), but (3,1) not listed, so free.\n\nThen from (3,2) move D to (3,1), then to (2,1) next turn.\n\nBut to reach (2,1) on turn 9.\n\nFrom start:\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,5)  // at (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4)  // at (3,4)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (3,3)  // at (3,3)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (3,2)  // at (3,2)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (3,1)  // at (3,1)\n\nThen turn 10: move L to (2,1) to eat, but turn 10, food gone.\n\nAfter turn 9, countdown=0, so not available on turn 10.\n\nAt turn 9, if I am at (3,1), I can move to (2,1) only if adjacent; (3,1) to (2,1) is left, adjacent, so on turn 9, from (3,1) move L to (2,1), eat.\n\nBut I need to be at (3,1) on turn 8 or something.\n\nTurn 8: at (3,2) after move.\n\nTurn 9: from (3,2), I can move D to (3,1), then at (3,1), but to eat (2,1), I need to move to it, which is on turn 9 action? On turn 9, I start at (3,2), I move to (3,1) or to (2,2), but not directly to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is not adjacent to (3,2); it's diagonal.\n\nSo I cannot move directly to (2,1) from (3,2).\n\nI need to go to (2,2) or (3,1) first.\n\nIf I go to (2,2) on turn 9, then I can eat on turn 10, but too late.\n\nIf I go to (3,1) on turn 9, then on turn 10 move to (2,1), but turn 10 food gone.\n\nSo impossible to eat (2,1) from this position with current path? I need a shorter path.\n\nFrom (4,5), instead of going down, I can go left then down earlier.\n\nFor example, turn 5: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,5)  // at (2,5)\n\nNow from (2,5), I can move D to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\nMove U to (2,6), or D to (2,4) invalid, so only U or L or R, but direction.\n\nAt (2,5), after moving L, direction L, so can move U, D, L.\n\nU to (2,6): free, no food\n\nD to (2,4): obstacle, invalid\n\nL to (1,5): free\n\nSo I can move U to (2,6) or L to (1,5)\n\nIf move L to (1,5), at (1,5)\n\nThen turn 7: from (1,5), can move U to (1,6) which has food, or D to (1,4), etc.\n\n(1,6) has food, so I can eat it on turn 7 if I go there.\n\nBut for (2,1), from (1,5), I need to go down, but obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle at y=2.\n\n(1,2) blocked, so I cannot go directly down from x=1.\n\nFor example, from (1,5) move D to (1,4), then D to (1,3), then D to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo cannot go below y=2 on x=1.\n\nTo reach (2,1), I need to go to x=2 or x=3 at lower y.\n\nFrom (2,5), if I move U to (2,6), at (2,6), then I can move to (1,6) or other.\n\nBut (2,1) is at bottom.\n\nFrom (3,5) or (4,5), to reach (2,1), I need to go down to y=1, avoiding obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) move D to (4,4), then D to (4,3), D to (4,2), but (4,2) free? obstacles: (1,2) but not (4,2), so free, then D to (4,1), but (4,1) free? obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), not (4,1), so free.\n\nThen from (4,1) move L to (3,1), then to (2,1).\n\nBut turns: turn 5 move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6 move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7 move D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 8 move D to (4,1)\n\nTurn 9 move L to (3,1)  // at (3,1)\n\nThen turn 10 move L to (2,1) too late.\n\nFrom (4,1) on turn 8, I can move directly to (2,1)? Not adjacent.\n\nOr from (4,2) move L to (3,2) on turn 8, then turn 9 move D to (3,1), then turn 10 to (2,1) late.\n\nTo reach (2,1) by turn 9, I need to be adjacent on turn 9.\n\nFor example, if I am at (2,2) on turn 8, then turn 9 move D to (2,1) eat.\n\nOr at (3,1) on turn 8, turn 9 move L to (2,1) eat.\n\nOr at (1,1) if possible, but (1,1) free? obstacles: (1,2) but not (1,1), so free, but from (1,1) to (2,1) adjacent.\n\nBut to reach (2,2) or (3,1) by turn 8.\n\nFrom (4,5), shortest path to (2,2) or (3,1).\n\nFor example, to (3,1): (4,5) to (3,5) to (3,4) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1): 5 moves, so turn 5 to (3,5), turn 6 to (3,4), turn 7 to (3,3), turn 8 to (3,2), turn 9 to (3,1), then turn 10 to (2,1) late.\n\nTurn 5 start at (4,5), after move to new position.\n\nTurn 5 action: move to (3,5), at (3,5) end of turn 5.\n\nTurn 6: move to (3,4), at (3,4)\n\nTurn 7: move to (3,3), at (3,3)\n\nTurn 8: move to (3,2), at (3,2)\n\nTurn 9: move to (3,1), at (3,1)\n\nTurn 10: move to (2,1), but food gone on turn 10.\n\nTo be at (2,2) on turn 8: from (4,5) to (4,4) turn 5? Turn 5 move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6 move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7 move D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 8 move L to (3,2) or to (2,2)? From (4,2) to (2,2) not adjacent, so to (3,2) or (4,1) etc.\n\nFrom (4,2) move L to (3,2) on turn 8, at (3,2)\n\nThen turn 9 move to (2,2) or (3,1), etc., but not directly to (2,1) on turn 9.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 8, I can move L to (2,2) on turn 9, at (2,2), then turn 10 to (2,1) late.\n\nIt seems difficult to reach (2,1) by turn 9 from (4,5) because of the distance and obstacles.\n\nMinimum Manhattan distance |dx| + |dy| = |2| + |4| = 6, so at least 6 moves, but with obstacles, might be more.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (2,1): dx=2 left, dy=4 down, so 6 cells apart, so 6 moves needed to reach.\n\nBut to be on (2,1) on turn t, I need to start moving at turn t-5 or something.\n\nTurn 5: at (4,5), after move to new, say to (3,5) or (4,4), etc.\n\nIf I move directly towards, turn 5 move to (3,5)  // after turn 5\n\nTurn 6 move to (2,5)  // but (2,5) to (2,1) is 4 down, but (2,4) blocked, so I need to detour.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can only go to (1,5) or (2,6), not down.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (3,4), etc., as before.\n\nBut to (3,1) in 4 moves: from (3,5) to (3,4) turn 6, (3,3) turn 7, (3,2) turn 8, (3,1) turn 9.\n\nThen from (3,1) to (2,1) turn 10, too late.\n\nSimilarly, via other paths.\n\nSo it might not be possible to reach (2,1) in time to eat it, since it disappears after turn 9, and I can only eat by turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 is the last chance.\n\nWith 4 moves from turn 5, I can reach cells within Manhattan distance 4.\n\n(2,1) is distance 6 from (4,5), so I cannot reach it by turn 9 with moves starting turn 5.\n\nTurn 5: after action, I am at a new position, say (3,5) or (4,4), both distance 5 from (2,1)? (3,5) to (2,1): dx=1, dy=4, dist=5.\n\n(4,4) to (2,1): dx=2, dy=3, dist=5.\n\nThen from there, in 4 more moves (turns 6,7,8,9), I can reach (2,1) if no obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (3,5): turn 6 to (3,4), turn 7 to (3,3), turn 8 to (3,2), turn 9 to (3,1), but (3,1) to (2,1) is dist 1, not reached yet.\n\nOn turn 9, I move to (3,1), but (2,1) is not occupied.\n\nTo be on (2,1) on turn 9, I need to arrive there on turn 9 action.\n\nSo I need to start from a cell adjacent to (2,1) on turn 8.\n\nCells adjacent to (2,1): (1,1), (2,2), (3,1)\n\n(1,1) and (3,1) and (2,2).\n\nNow, from (4,5), in 3 moves, can I reach one of these?\n\nTurn 5: move to say (3,5)  // dist to (3,1) is 4 in y, not close.\n\nAfter turn 5, at (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move to (3,4) or (2,5)\n\nIf to (2,5), dist to (2,2) is 3 down, but (2,4) blocked, so not.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,4) turn 6\n\nThen turn 7 to (3,3)\n\nTurn 8 to (3,2)\n\nThen on turn 8 at (3,2), which is not adjacent to (2,1); adjacent cells are (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2)\n\n(3,2) to (2,1) is not adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move to (3,1) or (2,2) on turn 9, then to (2,1) on turn 10.\n\nBut turn 10 too late.\n\nSimilarly, other paths, I think it's not feasible to eat (2,1) because of the distance and the obstacle at (2,4) blocking the direct path.\n\nSo probably, I should ignore (2,1) and focus on other foods.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is closer, at (1,6), from (4,5) dist |3| + |1| =4, so can reach by turn 8 or 9.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) move L to (3,5) turn 5, L to (2,5) turn 6, L to (1,5) turn 7, then U to (1,6) turn 8, eat on turn 8.\n\nOr directly from (2,6) etc.\n\nBut since (4,6) is very close, I should eat it first.\n\nBack to the decision.\n\nAt turn 5, moving U to eat (4,6) seems best, as it's immediate reward and I can grow.\n\nThen from there, I can go for (1,6) or (6,6).\n\n(1,6) has shorter life, life_span 5, so available until turn 9, while (6,6) has life_span 9, available until turn 13, so I can get (1,6) first.\n\nBut (1,6) is at corner.\n\nAfter eating (4,6) at turn 5, snake at [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ]\n\nTurn 6: I can move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\nIf I move L to (3,6), then as before, I can go to (2,6) turn 7, then to (1,6) turn 8 to eat.\n\nOr if I move R to (5,6), then to (6,6) turn 7 to eat.\n\nBoth are possible.\n\nBut moving L might be better to get (1,6) before it expires.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) can be gotten later.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,1) but I may not reach it, so ignore.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, after eating, I should avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, after going to (1,6), if snake is long, it might be trapped, but now short.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) same.\n\nBut with internal obstacles, need to be careful.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,6) is only one step away, so not eating it might be a waste.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, and go elsewhere, I might not come back.\n\nBut I can, but why risk.\n\nMoreover, thinking 5 turns ahead, by eating now, I can have a longer snake to reach other areas, but for (2,1), it might not help.\n\nSo I think move U at turn 5 to eat (4,6).\n\nThen for turn 6, I need to choose direction.\n\nSince (1,6) has shorter life, I should go left to get it.\n\nThen after that, I can go for (6,6) or other.\n\nBut (6,6) has long life, so ok.\n\nAlso, no other food.\n\nSo plan:\n\nTurn 5: move U to (4,6), eat food, snake now [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) ], length 3, direction U.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,6), no food, positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)? [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) ], direction L.\n\nTurn 7: move L to (2,6), no food, positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (4,6)? [ (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ], direction L.\n\nTurn 8: move L to (1,6), eat food, grow to length 4. Positions before move: [head (2,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (4,6)] move head to (1,6), eat, so head (1,6), seg1 to (2,6), seg2 to (3,6), new tail at (4,6)? After move: [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ]\n\nNow, at (1,6), direction L.\n\nThen turn 9: from (1,6), can move U, D, L, but U to (1,7) wall, invalid; L to (0,6) wall, invalid; so only D or R? But cannot move opposite? Current direction L, opposite is R, so I cannot move R immediately? No instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction is L, since I moved left to (1,6).\n\nSo from direction L, I cannot move R (right), but I can move U, D, or L.\n\nBut U and L are walls, so only possible move is D to (1,5).\n\nSo move D to (1,5), no food, positions: head to (1,5), body to (1,6), etc. [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) ] with tail at (3,6).\n\nThen from there, I can continue, but I have eaten two foods.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output for several turns.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, and output the actions.\n\nIn this plan, for turn 5 to turn 8, I have actions.\n\nTurn 9: move D as above.\n\nBut I don't need to output too many, perhaps 5 turns.\n\nTurn 5 to turn 9.\n\nIn this case, turn 5: U, turn 6: L, turn 7: L, turn 8: L, turn9: D\n\nBut at turn9 move D from (1,6) to (1,5)\n\nThen I can continue to other areas.\n\nIf at turn 6, after turn 5, I moved R instead.\n\nTurn 5: U to (4,6) eat\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,6) no eat, positions [ (5,6), (4,6), (4,5) ]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,6) eat food, grow. Positions before: [head (5,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (4,5)] move head to (6,6), eat, so head (6,6), seg1 to (5,6), seg2 to (4,6), new tail at (4,5)? [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5) ]\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 8: from (6,6), direction R, can move U, D, R, but U to (6,7) wall, R to (7,6) wall, so only D to (6,5) or L, but cannot L opposite.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L (opposite), so only possible D to (6,5).\n\nMove D to (6,5), no food, positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), etc. [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) ] with tail at (4,6).\n\nThen continue.\n\nIn this case, I ate (4,6) and (6,6), both with value 1.\n\n(1,6) is left uneaten, but it will disappear after turn 9, so if I don't go there, it's fine.\n\nIn the first plan, I ate (1,6) at turn 8.\n\nSince (1,6) and (4,6) have same life, but (6,6) has longer, so it might be better to eat the short-life ones first.\n\nIn the left path, I ate (4,6) and (1,6), both short-life.\n\nIn the right path, I ate (4,6) and (6,6), with (6,6) long-life, so I could have saved (6,6) for later, but since I ate it, it's ok.\n\nBut for score, eating any +1 is same.\n\nBut long-term, by eating short-life first, I ensure I don't lose them.\n\n(2,1) I may not reach, so ignore.\n\nSo I think moving left after eating (4,6) is better to get (1,6).\n\nMoreover, in the grid, after going to (1,6), I can go down to (1,5), then to (2,5), etc., to explore.\n\nWhereas at (6,6), with obstacle at (6,4), it might be tighter.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), I can move to (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle, so cannot, so I have to move left or down, but down to (6,4) invalid, so to (5,5) or (6,5) to (5,5) left, etc.\n\nBut not critical.\n\nSo I'll go with the first plan: turn 5 move U to eat (4,6), then turn 6 move L, turn 7 move L, turn 8 move L to eat (1,6), then turn 9 move D.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to specify actions for turns.\n\nThe answer format: Turn 5: U, Turn 6: L, Turn 7: L, Turn 8: L, and since think 5+ turns, include Turn 9: D.\n\nBut turn 9 is the 5th turn ahead? Turn 5 is current, so thinking ahead to turn 10 or so, but output can be for turns 5 to 9.\n\nTurn 5 to turn 9 is 5 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 8 I eat (1,6), turn 9 move D to (1,5).\n\nNow, to confirm no risks.\n\nAt turn 5, move U to (4,6): no collision, food eaten.\n\nTurn 6 move L to (3,6): no issue.\n\nTurn 7 move L to (2,6): no issue.\n\nTurn 8 move L to (1,6): eat food, no tail reward danger, since tail was at (4,6) before move, not adjacent to head (2,6).\n\nThen turn 9 move D to (1,5): from (1,6), direction L, move D, not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nIf I want to think further, but for now, this should be fine.\n\nI think this is a good plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated possible actions for at least 5 turns ahead (turns 5 to 9). The key considerations are:\n- The food at (4,6) is immediately accessible and has a short life span (disappears after turn 9), so eating it on turn 5 is efficient for growth and score.\n- The food at (1,6) also has a short life span (disappears after turn 9) and can be reached by moving left after eating (4,6), ensuring it is consumed before expiration.\n- The food at (6,6) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 13), so it can be targeted later without immediate risk of loss.\n- The food at (2,1) is too distant and obstructed by obstacles (e.g., (2,4) is blocked), making it infeasible to reach by turn 9 when it disappears; thus, it is ignored.\n- Internal obstacles and walls are avoided in the path.\n- Snake growth from eating increases length, but the plan avoids collisions and tail reward danger (not applicable here as food is not under the tail when eaten).\n- Movement respects the no-instant-reverse rule.\n\n### Plan Details:\n- **Turn 5 (current state)**: Move up (U) to (4,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 3). This is optimal as (4,6) is adjacent and will be lost soon if not eaten.\n- **Turn 6**: Move left (L) to (3,6). No food here, but this positions the snake to reach (1,6) efficiently. Direction is now left.\n- **Turn 7**: Move left (L) to (2,6). No food, but continues the path toward (1,6). Direction remains left.\n- **Turn 8**: Move left (L) to (1,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 4). (1,6) is eaten just before it disappears (life span ends after turn 9). Direction is now left.\n- **Turn 9**: Move down (D) to (1,5). From (1,6), moving down is the only safe option (up and left are walls, and right is opposite to current left direction, so forbidden). This avoids the corner and allows future exploration.\n\nThis sequence scores 2 points by eating two foods, avoids all risks (no collisions or dead ends), and sets up for long-term survival. After turn 9, the snake can target (6,6) or other areas.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: L \\\\\nTurn 7: L \\\\\nTurn 8: L \\\\\nTurn 9: D\n}",

The walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but since x=0 and x=7 are walls, the playable area is x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6? Let me confirm.\n\nThe border cells are given as x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, meaning any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, there are internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So, these are cells I cannot move into.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,6), then body at (4,5), and tail at (5,5). Snake head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,6) with value 1 and life span 4\n\n- (2,1) with value 1 and life span 4\n\n- (6,6) with value 1 and life span 8\n\nAll food has value 1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (1,6), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including the current turn. Since current turn is 6, it will disappear after turn 9? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 6, life span is 4, so it will be there for turns 6,7,8,9? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span N means it disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L. For example, for (1,6), life span 4 at turn 6, so it exists on turns 6,7,8, and disappears at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life span 4, same thing.\n\n(6,6) life span 8, so it will last longer.\n\nNow, I need to plan at least 5 turns ahead. So from turn 6 to turn 10 or 11.\n\nCurrent snake: head at (4,6), body at (4,5), tail at (5,5). Head direction is U, so last move was up.\n\nPossible moves: I can move U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), but with constraints.\n\nNo instant reverse: since head direction is U, I cannot move D (down) immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,6) with direction U:\n\n- U: (4,7) but y=7 is a wall, since border y=7 is wall. So (4,7) is invalid, cannot move there.\n\n- D: down to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by body segment. Is that a collision?\n\nLet's see collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment. But there's an exception: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (5,5), and body is at (4,5). If I move down to (4,5), that's where the body is, not the tail. The tail is at (5,5), so (4,5) is the second segment, which is part of the body.\n\nSnake positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] so index 0: head, index 1: body, index 2: tail.\n\nIf I move to (4,5), that's the position of the body segment. When I move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away, but if the head moves to a cell that was occupied by a body segment before the move, it might collide.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and tail is removed if no growth.\n\nBut for collision, before moving, if the new head position is occupied by a body segment, it collides, except if it's the tail and we're not growing.\n\nThe rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to tail cell is ok, but moving to any other body cell is collision.\n\nHere, (4,5) is the body segment, not tail. Tail is (5,5). So moving to (4,5) would be collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (5,5) might be ok if it's the tail.\n\nBut let's list possible moves from (4,6):\n\n- U: (4,7) - but y=7 is wall, invalid.\n\n- D: (4,5) - occupied by body, collision, invalid.\n\n- L: left to (3,6) - need to check if this is valid.\n\n- R: right to (5,6) - need to check.\n\nAlso, walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are playable? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are invalid. Similarly y=0 and y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). These are also invalid cells.\n\nFor (3,6): x=3, y=6. Is this a wall? Border: y=6 is not y=0 or y=7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles don't have (3,6), so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6): x=5, y=6, not border, not in obstacles, should be free.\n\nNow, what about moving to (5,5)? That's the tail position.\n\nIf I move R to (5,6), or L to (3,6), or to tail?\n\nMoving to tail: from (4,6), if I move to (5,5), that's diagonal? No, moves are only up, down, left, right, not diagonal. So from (4,6), I can only go to (4,7) U, (4,5) D, (3,6) L, (5,6) R. I cannot go directly to (5,5); that's not adjacent in the grid sense; adjacent means sharing a side, so only orthogonally adjacent.\n\n(4,6) to (5,5) is diagonal, not adjacent, so not possible. Only U, D, L, R.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,7) - invalid, wall.\n\nD to (4,5) - occupied by body, collision, invalid.\n\nL to (3,6) - seems free.\n\nR to (5,6) - seems free.\n\n(3,6): x=3,y=6, not border wall, not in obstacles: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). None at (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, (5,6): x=5,y=6, not in obstacles.\n\nSo only possible moves are L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\nNow, after moving, the snake will grow only if it eats food; otherwise, tail moves.\n\nCurrently, no food at head position, so no growth.\n\nFood positions: (1,6), (2,1), (6,6). None at (4,6) or (3,6) or (5,6), so moving to (3,6) or (5,6) doesn't eat food.\n\nSo if I move to (3,6), new head at (3,6), body segments: previous head was at (4,6), so body moves to (4,6), and tail was at (5,5), but since no growth, tail moves away? Let's sequence.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Head moves to new position.\n\n- Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\n- If no food eaten, tail is removed (it moves forward, so the cell is vacated).\n\nSo positions: start: head (4,6), body (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nIf move L to (3,6):\n\n- New head: (3,6)\n\n- Body segment that was at (4,5) moves to where head was, (4,6)\n\n- Tail segment that was at (5,5) moves to where the body was, (4,5)\n\nSo new positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)? Let's list:\n\n- Segment 0 (head) now at (3,6)\n\n- Segment 1 (was body) now at previous head position (4,6)\n\n- Segment 2 (was tail) now at previous body position (4,5)\n\nBut the body segment was at (4,5), so it moves to (4,6)? No:\n\nStandard: the body segment follows the head.\n\nAfter head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it.\n\nSo: after head moves to (3,6), the segment that was behind head, at (4,5), moves to where head was, (4,6).\n\nThen the segment that was at (5,5), which was behind (4,5), moves to where (4,5) was, which is (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is now occupied? No, positions are updated sequentially.\n\nTypically in snake, when head moves, the neck moves to head old position, and so on.\n\nSo: old positions: index 0: (4,6), index 1: (4,5), index 2: (5,5)\n\nAfter head moves to (3,6):\n\n- New index 0: (3,6)\n\n- New index 1: old index 0 position, which is (4,6)\n\n- New index 2: old index 1 position, which is (4,5)\n\nOld index 2 is discarded since no growth.\n\nSo new snake: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (5,6):\n\nNew head: (5,6)\n\nNew body: (4,6)  // old head\n\nNew tail: (4,5)  // old body, since tail moves to old body position\n\nOld tail at (5,5) is left.\n\nNow, direction: after move, head direction changes based on move.\n\nIf I move L, head direction becomes L; if R, becomes R.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, food: (1,6) at (1,6) with value 1, life span 4, so disappears after turn 9? Turn 6: life span 4, so after 4 turns, it disappears, so at turn 10 it is gone? Let's calculate.\n\nLife span N at turn t: present for turns t to t+N-1, disappears at turn t+N.\n\nSo for (1,6): at turn 6, life span 4, so present turns 6,7,8,9; disappears turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): life span 4 at turn 6, present turns 6,7,8,9; gone turn 10.\n\n(6,6): life span 8 at turn 6, present turns 6 to 13; gone turn 14.\n\nNow, (1,6) is at (1,6), which is on the same row as current head, but left.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), right.\n\n(2,1) is down left, but far.\n\nI should think about survival and eating food.\n\nCurrent snake length: 3 segments.\n\nIf I eat food, length increases by 1, so to 4.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (5,5), and no food there.\n\nNow, possible moves from turn 6: only L or R.\n\nIf I go L to (3,6), head at (3,6), direction L.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: since direction L, cannot move R (opposite).\n\nPossible: U to (3,7), but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5), which might be free.\n\nL to (2,6), etc.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (5,6), head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nThen possible: U to (5,7) wall invalid.\n\nD to (5,5), but (5,5) was tail, but now it's not occupied? After move to (5,6), new positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5). So (5,5) is empty now.\n\nMoving D to (5,5) from (5,6): (5,5) is free, I think.\n\nBut let's list obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,5) not in there, not border, so free.\n\nSimilarly, R from (5,6) to (6,6), but (6,6) has food! (6,6) has food with value 1.\n\n(6,6) is food position.\n\nIf I move to (6,6), I eat the food, since head moves there.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut let's see if it's possible.\n\nFirst, I need to decide for turn 6.\n\nSince I must think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate both options.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (3,6) at turn 6.\n\nThen snake: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (3,5) - let's check: x=3,y=5, not border, not obstacle: obstacles (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2), no (3,5), so free.\n\n- L: (2,6) - x=2,y=6, not border, obstacles? (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,6) different, so free.\n\n- R: (4,6) but (4,6) is now body segment (in new positions, index 1 is (4,6)), so moving to (4,6) would be body collision, invalid, since not tail.\n\nTail is at (4,5).\n\nSo possible moves: D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n\nIf I go L to (2,6), then head at (2,6), direction L.\n\nThen turn 8: from (2,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: (2,7) wall invalid\n\nD: (2,5) - free? x=2,y=5, not border, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not, so free.\n\nL: (1,6) - but (1,6) has food! And life span 4, so present.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is adjacent left.\n\nBut moving to (1,6): if I move L, to (1,6), I eat the food.\n\nBut is (1,6) valid? x=1,y=6, border: x=0 and x=7 are walls, but x=1 is not x=0 or x=7, so not border wall. y=6 not wall. Internal obstacles no (1,6), so free.\n\nBut there is food, so if I move to (1,6), I eat it.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFrom (2,6), move L to (1,6): eats food, so snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head to (1,6), body: previous head (2,6) becomes body, tail: since growth, tail doesn't move, so new tail is old tail.\n\nOld positions before move: head (2,6), body (3,6)? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 6 move to (3,6), snake: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 7: move L to (2,6)\n\nNew head: (2,6)\n\nNew body: previous head (3,6)\n\nNew body: previous body (4,6)? Segments: old index 0 (head) at (3,6) moves to (2,6)\n\nThen old index 1 (body) at (4,6) moves to where old head was, (3,6)\n\nOld index 2 (tail) at (4,5) moves to where old body was, (4,6)? Since no food eaten yet.\n\nAfter move to (2,6), no food eaten at (2,6)? (2,6) has food? Food positions are (1,6), (2,1), (6,6), so (2,6) no food, so no growth.\n\nSo new positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (4,6)? Old tail was (4,5), moves to old body position (4,6).\n\nOld positions: before turn 7 move: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nHead moves to (2,6)\n\nThen segment that was behind head, at (4,6) moves to (3,6)\n\nSegment that was at (4,5) moves to (4,6)\n\nBut (4,6) is now occupied? No, in sequence: the body segment at (4,6) moves to the position vacated by head, which is (3,6)\n\nThen the tail segment at (4,5) moves to the position vacated by the body segment, which was (4,6)\n\nSo new positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nTail is at (4,6).\n\nNow, at turn 8, from (2,6), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: (2,7) wall invalid\n\nD: (2,5) - free? x=2,y=5, not border, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is above, so free.\n\nL: (1,6) - has food, so if move there, eat food.\n\nR: (3,6) but (3,6) is body segment, collision, invalid.\n\nSo possible: D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n\nIf I move L to (1,6) at turn 8, I eat the food at (1,6).\n\nSince I eat food, snake grows, so new head at (1,6), and tail doesn't move.\n\nOld positions before move: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (4,6)\n\nAfter move to (1,6):\n\nNew head: (1,6)\n\nNew body: old head position (2,6) becomes body\n\nThen since growth, the tail stays, so new segments: head (1,6), body (2,6), body (3,6), tail (4,6)? Let's see.\n\nTypically: head moves to new cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail doesn't move.\n\nSo positions: new head at (1,6), then the previous segments remain, but shifted? No.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the end.\n\nSo from old snake: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]  // positions before move\n\nHead moves to (1,6), and since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so new body segments are the old positions.\n\nSo new snake: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nLength 4.\n\nHead direction L.\n\nNow, life span of (1,6) was 4 at turn 6, so at turn 8, it has been 2 turns, life span decreased to 2? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 6, life span 4.\n\nTurn 7: life span 3\n\nTurn 8: life span 2, so eaten just in time.\n\nDisappears after turn 9, so at turn 8 it is still there.\n\nNow, back to turn 6 decision.\n\nIf I go left at turn 6, I can potentially eat (1,6) by turn 8.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nFrom (1,6), after eating, head at (1,6), direction L.\n\nTurn 9: from (1,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: (1,7) wall invalid\n\nD: (1,5) - free? x=1,y=5, not border, obstacles no, so free.\n\nL: (0,6) but x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR: (2,6) but (2,6) is body segment now, since snake is [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)], so (2,6) is body, collision if move there.\n\nSo only possible move: D to (1,5)\n\nThen move to (1,5), no food there.\n\nNew head (1,5), direction down? Since moved down, direction D.\n\nThen body: old head (1,6) becomes body, etc.\n\nBut I need to think further.\n\nNow, the other food (2,1) is far, and (6,6) is there.\n\nBut let's consider the other option at turn 6: move R to (5,6).\n\nAt turn 6, move R to (5,6).\n\nNew snake: head (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nHead direction R.\n\n(5,6) has no food, as food at (6,6).\n\nTurn 7: from (5,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: (5,7) wall invalid\n\nD: (5,5) - free? x=5,y=5, not border, obstacles: (5,1) but (5,5) not, so free.\n\nR: (6,6) - has food! So if move there, eat food.\n\nL: (4,6) but (4,6) is body segment, collision, invalid.\n\nSo possible: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf move R to (6,6) at turn 7, eat food.\n\nNew head (6,6), since growth, new body: old head (5,6), and tail stays, so new snake: head (6,6), body (5,6), tail (4,6)? Old tail was (4,5), but since growth, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: positions [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nHead moves to (6,6), food eaten, so grow: new segments: head (6,6), then old head (5,6) becomes body, old body (4,6) becomes body, and tail (4,5) remains as tail since growth? No.\n\nWith growth: head moves to new cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays, and the segments in between move.\n\nStandard: when eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is created at the tail position.\n\nBut in terms of positions, after head moves to new cell, the body segments move to the next position, but since growth, the last segment doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added.\n\nEasier: the snake extends by one segment at the tail.\n\nSo from old: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nHead moves to (6,6)\n\nThen the body segments: the first body segment moves to old head position (5,6), the second body segment moves to old first body position (4,6), and since growth, a new segment is added at the old tail position (4,5), but the tail moves? I'm confusing myself.\n\nI think I have it: when no growth, tail moves away. When growth, tail stays, and the segment before it moves to where it was going, but since tail stays, it's like adding a new segment at the end.\n\nAfter move with growth:\n\n- Head at new position\n\n- Each subsequent segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it from previous state\n\n- And a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so tail doesn't move.\n\nIn this case, old positions: segment A: (5,6), B: (4,6), C: (4,5)\n\nHead moves to (6,6)\n\nThen segment B moves to where A was, (5,6)\n\nSegment C moves to where B was, (4,6)\n\nAnd since growth, a new segment is added at where C was, (4,5), so new tail at (4,5)\n\nBut (4,5) was C, so new positions: head (6,6), segment B at (5,6), segment C at (4,6), and new segment D at (4,5)? But C was at (4,5), and it moved to (4,6), so the new segment is at old C position.\n\nNew snake: head (6,6), then the old segments: the first body is old head position (5,6), second body is old first body position (4,6), and tail is old tail position (4,5) but since growth, tail doesn't move, so it remains at (4,5), and a new segment is added? No.\n\nWhen growing, the tail doesn't move, so the position that was tail remains occupied, and the head moves to new cell, body shifts.\n\nSo after moving head to (6,6), the segment that was at (4,6) (B) moves to (5,6), the segment that was at (4,5) (C) stays at (4,5) because of growth? No.\n\nLet's think: the body segment behind head moves to head's old position.\n\nThen the next body segment moves to its own old position's predecessor, but it's messy.\n\nStandard way: the snake moves forward, and when it eats, the tail doesn't advance, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail.\n\nPositions: before move: [A, B, C] = [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nHead moves to new position P, say (6,6)\n\nThen new positions: [P, A, B, C] if growth, so [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5) ]\n\nC is still at (4,5), so the tail didn't move, and B is at (4,6), A at (5,6), head at (6,6).\n\nYes, that's it.\n\nSo new snake: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nLength 4.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nNow, at (6,6), which is near border. x=6, y=6.\n\nBorder x=7 is wall, so x=6 is not wall, but adjacent to x=7.\n\nPossible moves from (6,6) with direction R.\n\nBut direction is R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nU: (6,7) wall invalid\n\nD: (6,5) - free? x=6,y=5, not border, obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, (6,1) but (6,5) not, so free? (6,4) is obstacle, (6,5) is above, so should be free.\n\nR: (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nL: (5,6) but (5,6) is body segment, collision, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move: D to (6,5)\n\nThen move to (6,5), no food there.\n\nNew head (6,5), direction D.\n\nThen snake: head (6,5), body (6,6), body (5,6), tail (4,6)? New positions: after move, no food, so tail moves.\n\nBefore move: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nHead moves to (6,5)\n\nThen body: segment at (5,6) moves to (6,6)\n\nSegment at (4,6) moves to (5,6)\n\nTail at (4,5) moves to (4,6)\n\nBut (4,6) is now occupied? No, positions updated.\n\nNew head (6,5)\n\nNew body: old head position (6,6)\n\nNew body: old first body position (5,6)\n\nNew tail: old second body position (4,6)  // since no growth, tail moves.\n\nOld tail at (4,5) moves to where the previous segment was, but it's the last.\n\nNew positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), body (5,6), tail (4,6)\n\nTail at (4,6).\n\nBut (4,5) is now empty.\n\nNow, head at (6,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 9, etc.\n\nBut let's compare the two options.\n\nFirst option (go left at turn 6): I can eat (1,6) by turn 8, but then at (1,6) I can only move down to (1,5), which might be ok, but I'm in the corner.\n\nSecond option (go right at turn 6): I can eat (6,6) by turn 7, then move down to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut there is also food at (2,1), but it's far and life span 4, so at turn 6 to 9 present, turn 10 gone.\n\nWith snake at (1,5) or (6,5), it might be hard to reach (2,1) in time.\n\nTurn 6 to turn 9 is 4 turns, but I need to move.\n\nFor example, from (1,5) after eating (1,6), at turn 9, head at (1,5), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: from (1,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nU: (1,6) but (1,6) is body segment? After turn 8, snake is [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] after eating.\n\nThen at turn 9, move D to (1,5), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), body (1,6), body (2,6), tail (3,6)? Before move: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nHead moves to (1,5)\n\nThen body: segment at (2,6) moves to (1,6)\n\nSegment at (3,6) moves to (2,6)\n\nSegment at (4,6) moves to (3,6)\n\nSo new: head (1,5), body (1,6), body (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen turn 10: from (1,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nD: (1,4) - free? x=1,y=4, not border, obstacles no, so free.\n\nL: (0,5) wall invalid\n\nR: (2,5) - free? x=2,y=5, not border, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not, so free.\n\nU: (1,6) but (1,6) is body, collision, invalid.\n\nSo can move D to (1,4) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf move R to (2,5), then to (2,5), etc, but (2,1) is at y=1, so far.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,5) in the other path.\n\nBut (2,1) has life span 4 at turn 6, so at turn 9 it is still there (since turns 6,7,8,9), gone turn 10.\n\nFrom (1,5) at turn 10, I can move to (2,5) or (1,4), but to reach (2,1) I need to go down, but y=1, and there are obstacles.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so from (2,5) I can go down to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, cannot move there.\n\nInternal obstacle at (2,4), so (2,4) is blocked.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go D to (2,4) but invalid, or L to (1,5) body, or R to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut to go to (2,1), I need to go around or something.\n\nIt might be tight to reach (2,1) by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, from the right side.\n\nBut let's think about survival.\n\nAlso, there is tail reward danger to consider.\n\nBut not immediate.\n\nNow, back to turn 6 decision.\n\nIf I go left, I eat (1,6) at turn 8, score +1.\n\nIf I go right, I eat (6,6) at turn 7, score +1.\n\nBoth give score, but with left, I eat at turn 8, with right at turn 7, so slightly earlier.\n\nBut in left case, after eating (1,6), I am at (1,6), then must go down to (1,5), and I am in the corner with limited moves.\n\nFor example, from (1,5), I can go to (1,4), then (1,3), etc, or to (2,5), but (2,4) blocked, so from (2,5) I can only go U, D invalid, L to (1,5) body, R to (3,5), etc.\n\nSimilarly, in right case, after eating (6,6), I am at (6,6), go down to (6,5), then from (6,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,6) body, invalid; D to (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (6,4), so cannot move there.\n\nL to (5,5), which might be free.\n\nR to (7,5) wall invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,5).\n\nThen to (5,5), no food.\n\nNew head (5,5), direction L? Since moved left from (6,5), so direction L.\n\nThen snake: before move, at turn 8 after eating and moving: after turn 7 eat at (6,6), snake [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (6,5)? From (6,6) move D to (6,5), no food.\n\nNew head (6,5), body (6,6), body (5,6), tail (4,6)  // tail moved\n\nThen turn 9: from (6,5), move L to (5,5)\n\nNew head (5,5), body (6,5), body (6,6), tail (5,6)? Before move: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)]\n\nHead to (5,5)\n\nThen body: segment at (6,6) moves to (6,5)\n\nSegment at (5,6) moves to (6,6)\n\nSegment at (4,6) moves to (5,6)\n\nSo new: head (5,5), body (6,5), body (6,6), tail (5,6)\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move, etc.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (5,1), but not near.\n\nNow, comparing the two paths:\n\n- Left path: eat at turn 8, but then stuck in top-left corner, might have trouble later.\n\n- Right path: eat at turn 7, then move to (5,5), which is more central, can access other areas.\n\nAlso, (2,1) food is available, but with left path, at turn 9 head at (1,5), to reach (2,1) I need to go to (2,5), then to (3,5) or something, but (2,4) blocked, so I have to go via (3,5) to (3,4) or down, but y=1 is low.\n\nFrom (1,5) at turn 9, move to (1,4) or (2,5).\n\nIf move to (2,5), at turn 9.\n\nThen from (2,5), direction R (if moved right).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6) - but (2,6) might be body or free? Snake positions: if at turn 9, after moving to (1,5) at turn 9, snake is head (1,5), body (1,6), body (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nThen move to (2,5) at turn 10? Let's not digress.\n\nIt might be difficult to reach (2,1) from left corner by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, from right path, at turn 9 head at (5,5), to (2,1) is far, need 4 moves: (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (3,4) to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), so from (5,5) to (2,1): delta x=3, delta y=4, but with obstacles.\n\nPath: e.g., (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (3,4) to (3,3) to (2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1), but (2,4) blocked, but (2,3) not, so possible, but many turns.\n\nTurn 9 to turn 13, but food disappears at turn 10, so only if I can reach by turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 head at (5,5), (2,1) at (2,1), distance |5-2| + |5-1| = 3+4=7 cells, but snake moves one per turn, so need 7 turns, from turn 9 to turn 15, but food gone at turn 10, impossible.\n\nSimilarly from left corner at turn 9 (1,5) to (2,1): |1-2| + |5-1| =1+4=5 cells, need 5 turns, to turn 14, food gone turn 10, impossible.\n\nSo (2,1) cannot be eaten by anyone, since at turn 6, it is at (2,1), and snake is at (4,6), distance |4-2| + |6-1| =2+5=7 cells, need 7 turns to reach, but life span 4, only until turn 9, so from turn 6 to turn 9, 4 turns, can move 4 cells, not enough to reach (2,1) from (4,6) in 3 moves? Turns 6,7,8,9: 4 moves, but distance min 7, impossible.\n\nAt turn 6, position (4,6), to (2,1): dx=2, dy=5, min moves 7, but food present turns 6,7,8,9, so I can be at (2,1) at turn 9 to eat, but need to arrive by turn 9.\n\nBut from turn 6 to turn 9, 3 moves? Turn 6: move, turn 7: move, turn 8: move, turn 9: move to (2,1).\n\nBut 4 moves: at turn 6 start, after move at end of turn.\n\nAt beginning of turn 6, snake at (4,6), I move to new position.\n\nAfter turn 6 move, head at new position.\n\nThen after turn 7, etc.\n\nTo eat at turn t, I move to food cell at turn t.\n\nSo for (2,1), to eat at turn 9, I need to be adjacent and move to it at turn 9.\n\nBut from (4,6) at turn 6, after move, I am elsewhere.\n\nMax I can move: in 3 moves (turns 6,7,8) I can be up to 3 cells away, but (4,6) to (2,1) is 5 cells in y-difference, so impossible to reach by turn 9. Even with 4 moves, but turns available: turn 6,7,8 to move to a cell adjacent to (2,1) by turn 8, then move to it at turn 9.\n\nBut after turn 6 move, say to (3,6) or (5,6), then turn 7, etc., still, the y-distance is large, from y=6 to y=1, need at least 5 moves down, but I may not go directly down.\n\nFor example, from (4,6) to (2,1): need to decrease y by 5, so at least 5 moves down, but in 4 moves (turns 6-9), I can do it if I go down directly, but with obstacles.\n\nFrom (4,6), if I go down at turn 6, but at turn 6, I cannot go down because (4,5) is body, only left or right.\n\nIf I go left to (3,6), then at turn 7, I can go down to (3,5), then turn 8 to (3,4), but (3,4) not obstacle, then turn 9 to (3,3) or something, not (2,1).\n\nFrom (3,4) to (2,1) is not adjacent, need more moves.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 7 from (3,6) I go left to (2,6), then turn 8 to (2,5), then turn 9 to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, cannot, or to (1,5) or (3,5), not to (2,1).\n\nSo indeed, impossible to eat (2,1) before it disappears. So I can ignore it.\n\nOnly (1,6) and (6,6) are reachable.\n\n(1,6) can be eaten by turn 8 or 9, (6,6) by turn 7.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, after eating, which position is better?\n\nIn left path, after eating (1,6) at turn 8, head at (1,6), then must go down to (1,5), and I am in top-left corner with body behind, so I can only go down or right, but going right to (2,5), then from there, I can go down to (2,4) but blocked, or up to (2,6) which might be body, or right to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut (2,4) blocked, so the area is constrained.\n\nIn right path, after eating (6,6) at turn 7, head at (6,6), then go down to (6,5), then left to (5,5), which is more central, and I have more space to maneuver.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), I can go up, down, left, right, depending on positions.\n\nAlso, (6,6) has longer life span, but I can eat it early.\n\nAnother thing: in the left path, when I move to (1,6) to eat, is there tail reward danger?\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut when I move to (1,6), the tail is not adjacent at that moment.\n\nBefore eating, at turn 8, when I move to (1,6), the tail is at (4,6) or something, not adjacent.\n\nAfter eating, tail is at (4,6), head at (1,6), far away.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly for (6,6).\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead, but since turn 6, up to turn 10 or so.\n\nBut I need to decide the sequence.\n\nAlso, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nIn the left path, after eating, I might get trapped in the corner.\n\nFor example, from (1,5), if I go down to (1,4), then (1,3), etc, but to y=1, and there is obstacle at (1,2), so at (1,3), I can go down to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, cannot, or right to (2,3), but (2,4) blocked, so from (2,3) I can go down to (2,2), then (2,1), but (2,1) food is gone by turn 10, but I can go there for space.\n\nBut (2,4) blocked, so I can go to (2,2), (2,1), etc.\n\nBut it's a bit cramped.\n\nIn the right path, from (5,5), I can explore more freely.\n\nAlso, no other food, so after eating, I need to survive.\n\nTherefore, going right to eat (6,6) seems better for long-term.\n\nMoreover, I eat it earlier at turn 7.\n\nSo at turn 6, move R to (5,6).\n\nThen at turn 7, move R to (6,6) to eat food.\n\nThen at turn 8, from (6,6), only possible move D to (6,5).\n\nThen at turn 9, from (6,5), move L to (5,5).\n\nThen at turn 10, from (5,5), I can choose.\n\nBut I need to output actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 6: move R.\n\nThen turn 7: move R to eat.\n\nThen turn 8: move D.\n\nThen turn 9: move L to (5,5).\n\nNow for turn 10, I need to think, but since I output multiple turns, I can plan.\n\nBut the food (6,6) is eaten, and (1,6) might still be there, but at turn 10, (1,6) is gone, since life span 4, disappeared at turn 10? At turn 6 life span 4, present turns 6,7,8,9, gone turn 10.\n\nAt turn 9, it is still there, but I am at (6,5) or (5,5), far from (1,6), cannot reach in one move.\n\nSo no.\n\nAfter turn 9, head at (5,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: from (5,5), direction L.\n\nU: (5,6) - but (5,6) might be body or free.\n\nAt turn 9, after moving L to (5,5), snake positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), body (6,6), tail (5,6)\n\nSo (5,6) is tail position.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), that is the tail cell, and since I move to it, and it might have food? But no food there, so no issue, and since it's tail, I can move there.\n\nIf I move to (5,6), and no food, then new head at (5,6), body moves, tail moves away.\n\nBut (5,6) is current tail, so moving there is ok.\n\nD to (5,4) - free? x=5,y=4, not border, obstacles: (6,4) obstacle but (5,4) not, so free.\n\nL to (4,5) - free? x=4,y=5, not border, not obstacle, free.\n\nR to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision, invalid.\n\nSo possible: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5).\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), since (5,6) is tail, I move there, no food, so new head at (5,6), then body: (6,5) moves to (5,5)? Before move: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]  // tail at (5,6)\n\nHead moves to (5,6), but (5,6) is current tail position.\n\nSince no food, the tail will move, so it should be ok.\n\nNew head at (5,6)\n\nThen body segment at (6,5) moves to where head was (5,5)\n\nBody segment at (6,6) moves to where (6,5) was, (6,5)\n\nTail segment at (5,6) moves to where (6,6) was, (6,6)\n\nBut head is moving to (5,6), which is occupied by tail, but since tail moves away, it should be fine, no collision.\n\nNew positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), body (6,5), tail (6,6)\n\nThen head direction U.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nBut for now, since I need to output up to turn 10 or so.\n\nIn the action sequence, I can specify for several turns.\n\nBut the answer format is to output actions from turn t1 onwards for multiple turns.\n\nSince I decided to go right, let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (6,6) to eat food\n\nNow at turn 7, after eating, snake: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)] as before.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nTurn 8: from (6,6), only possible move D to (6,5) (since U wall, R wall, L body)\n\nMove D to (6,5), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), body (5,6), tail (4,6)  // tail moved from (4,5) to (4,6)? Before move: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nHead to (6,5)\n\nThen body: (5,6) moves to (6,6)\n\n(4,6) moves to (5,6)\n\n(4,5) moves to (4,6)\n\nSo new: head (6,5), body (6,6), body (5,6), tail (4,6)\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 9: from (6,5), possible moves:\n\nU: (6,6) body, invalid\n\nD: (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, invalid\n\nL: (5,5) free\n\nR: (7,5) wall invalid\n\nSo move L to (5,5)\n\nNew head (5,5), body (6,5), body (6,6), tail (5,6)  // as before\n\nHead direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow turn 10: from (5,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5)\n\nAll possible, no immediate risk.\n\nI can choose, for example, L to (4,5) to go left.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, but since the output should have multiple turns, I can do up to turn 10.\n\nThe core is to maximize score and survival, but no more food, so just survive.\n\nIn this path, I have eaten one food, score +1.\n\nIf I went left, I also eat one, but in corner.\n\nSo right is better.\n\nFor the answer, output actions from turn 6 to, say, turn 10.\n\nBut turn 10 action depends on position.\n\nSince at turn 9 head at (5,5), I can move L to (4,5) at turn 10.\n\n(4,5) might be free.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nFirst, turn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nThen for turn 10, say L to (4,5)\n\nBut I need to confirm if (4,5) is valid.\n\nAt turn 9, positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), body (6,6), tail (5,6)\n\n(4,5) is free, not occupied, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nYes.\n\nMove L to (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, I can continue, but for now.\n\nThe sequence.\n\nIn the left path, I could have eaten at turn 8, but survival worse.\n\nSo I think right is better.\n\nThus, actions:\n\nTurn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nTurn 10: L  // to (4,5)\n\nBut turn 10 is beyond 5 turns? Turn 6 to turn 10 is 5 actions: turns 6,7,8,9,10.\n\nThink 5+ turns ahead, so planning for 5 future actions or more.\n\nOutput from turn 6 to turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 7 I eat, turn 8 move down, etc.\n\nNow for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must carefully plan moves at least 5 turns ahead, considering food availability, life spans, collision risks, and the snake's position. The current state (turn 6) has the snake at [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] with head direction U. Food is at (1,6) (value 1, life span 4, disappears after turn 9), (2,1) (value 1, life span 4, disappears after turn 9), and (6,6) (value 1, life span 8, disappears after turn 13). However, (2,1) is unreachable before it disappears due to distance and obstacles, so it is ignored.\n\nPossible moves from (4,6) at turn 6:\n- U (up) to (4,7): invalid (wall at y=7).\n- D (down) to (4,5): invalid (body collision at (4,5)).\n- L (left) to (3,6): valid, no food.\n- R (right) to (5,6): valid, no food.\n\nMoving L leads to (1,6) by turn 8 for +1 score, but traps the snake in the top-left corner, reducing long-term survival chances. Moving R allows eating (6,6) by turn 7 for +1 score, then moving to (5,5) by turn 9, which is more central and offers better maneuverability for survival. Thus, moving R is prioritized for better long-term prospects.\n\nPlanned moves for turns 6-10:\n- **Turn 6**: Move R to (5,6). Snake: head (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5). Direction: R.\n- **Turn 7**: Move R to (6,6) to eat food (+1 score). Snake grows: head (6,6), body (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5). Direction: R.\n- **Turn 8**: Only valid move is D (down) to (6,5) (U/R invalid, L body collision). No food. Snake: head (6,5), body (6,6), body (5,6), tail (4,6). Direction: D.\n- **Turn 9**: Only valid move is L (left) to (5,5) (U body collision, D obstacle at (6,4), R wall). No food. Snake: head (5,5), body (6,5), body (6,6), tail (5,6). Direction: L.\n- **Turn 10**: Move L (left) to (4,5) (valid, no food). This continues central movement for flexibility. Snake: head (4,5), body (5,5), body (6,5), tail (6,6). Direction: L.\n\nThis sequence scores +1 by turn 7 and positions the snake safely for future turns, avoiding corners and leveraging open space.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: R (right)  \nTurn 7: R (right)  \nTurn 8: D (down)  \nTurn 9: L (left)  \nTurn 10: L (left)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent state at turn 7:\n\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I can't move into these cells.\n\n- Snake positions: Head at (5,6), then body at (4,6), and tail at (4,5). So the snake is three segments long. Head direction is R, which means it's moving right.\n\n- Food:\n  - (1,6) with value 1, life span 3\n  - (2,1) with value 1, life span 3\n  - (6,6) with value 1, life span 7\n  - (4,1) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: For example, (1,6) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including this turn. So if not eaten by turn 9, it's gone. Similarly for others.\n\nNow, I need to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 steps ahead. The answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 7.\n\nFirst, let's understand the grid. Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are all walls. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake: head at (5,6), moving right. From (5,6), moving right would go to (6,6). But (6,6) has food? Let's see.\n\nFood at (6,6) is present. But I need to check if moving there is safe.\n\nAlso, snake body: positions are [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]. So the head is at (5,6), body at (4,6), tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,6), since (6,6) is a food position, I would eat it, and my snake grows by one segment. After moving, the new head is at (6,6), and the body segments follow. Since I ate food, a new segment is added at the tail end, so the snake becomes [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]? No.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. Then, if food is eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nStandard snake movement:\n\n- Move head to new cell.\n\n- If new cell has food, snake grows: tail stays, new segment added.\n\n- Else, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (6,6), which has food, then after move:\n\n- Head moves to (6,6)\n\n- Body: the segment that was at (4,6) moves to where head was, (5,6)\n\n- Tail: the segment at (4,5) stays because we ate food, so a new segment is added there? No.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nPositions before move: head: (5,6), body: (4,6), tail: (4,5)\n\nAfter moving right to (6,6):\n\n- New head: (6,6)\n\n- The body segment that was at (4,6) moves to (5,6) (previous head position)\n\n- The tail segment at (4,5) moves to (4,6)? No, since we ate food, the tail doesn't move; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nSo positions after eating: head at (6,6), then the segment that was head is now body at (5,6), then the segment that was body at (4,6) is still there, and a new segment is added at (4,5), so tail is now at (4,5) with the new segment.\n\nThe new segment is added at the position where the tail was before moving, but since we eat, the tail doesn't move, so the tail position stays, and a new segment is added there.\n\nInitial positions: index 0: head (5,6), index 1: body (4,6), index 2: tail (4,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (6,6) and eating:\n\n- New head: (6,6)\n\n- The body segments: the previous head (5,6) becomes the first body segment.\n\n- The previous body (4,6) becomes the second body segment.\n\n- Since we ate food, we add a new segment at the previous tail position (4,5), so now we have three body segments: (5,6), (4,6), and (4,5)? No.\n\nList:\n\n- New head: (6,6)\n\n- New body segment 1: previous head position (5,6)\n\n- New body segment 2: previous body position (4,6) — but when the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nStandard way:\n\n- The head moves to the new cell.\n\n- Each subsequent segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it.\n\n- If food eaten, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before it moved (but since it didn't move, it stays).\n\nEasier: after move, if no eat, tail is removed. If eat, tail is not removed, and new segment added at tail position.\n\nPositions before: [head: (5,6), segment1: (4,6), segment2: (4,5)] — segment2 is tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (6,6):\n\n- Head is now at (6,6)\n\n- segment1 moves to where head was, (5,6)\n\n- segment2 (tail) moves to where segment1 was, (4,6)\n\nBut since we ate food at (6,6), we do not remove the tail; instead, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was before moving, which is (4,5).\n\nSo the new positions are:\n\n- Head: (6,6)\n\n- Body: (5,6)  // previous head\n\n- Body: (4,6)  // previous segment1\n\n- Tail: (4,5)  // new segment added, since we ate\n\nAnd the tail was at (4,5) before, so we add a new one there, so now snake is longer: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nYes, four segments.\n\nIf no eat, we remove the tail, so it would be [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6)] and (4,5) is free.\n\nBack to the situation.\n\nCurrent head at (5,6), moving right to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is a food position with value 1, life span 7.\n\nIs moving to (6,6) safe?\n\nFirst, is it a wall? Walls: borders x=7,y=7, etc. (6,6) is not on border, and internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (6,6) not among them, so not a wall.\n\nNow, collision: after moving, head at (6,6), body at (5,6), (4,6), (4,5). So (6,6) is head, and body is at (5,6), (4,6), (4,5). (6,6) is not occupied by body except the head, so no collision with body. Walls no. So moving to (6,6) is safe and I eat the food, score +1, snake grows to length 4.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nHead direction is R, so I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left to (4,6) because that's opposite and also occupied by body.\n\nPossible moves from (5,6):\n\n- Up: (5,7) — y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n\n- Down: (5,5) — is this free? Let's see.\n\ny=5, x=5. Walls: y=0 and y=7 borders, so y=5 is ok. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (5,5) not among them. Snake positions: (5,6) head, (4,6), (4,5). (5,5) is not occupied by snake. So moving down to (5,5) is possible.\n\n- Left: (4,6) — but (4,6) is occupied by body segment, so collision if I move there. Also, current direction is R, left is opposite, so I cannot move opposite direction anyway. So invalid.\n\n- Right: (6,6) — as above, not wall, not body, has food, so possible.\n\nSo from current position, only two possible moves: down to (5,5) or right to (6,6). Up to (5,7) is wall, left to (4,6) is body and opposite direction.\n\nSo choices: D or R.\n\nNow, if I move right to (6,6), I eat food, snake grows to length 4, positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), tail (4,5).\n\nFood at (6,6) is eaten, so removed.\n\nOther food: (1,6) life span 3, so disappears after turn 9? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nTurn 7: food has current life span, so for (1,6) life span 3, after this turn, it will have 2 left, then 1, then gone. So if not eaten by turn 9, it disappears? Let's see.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, meaning at the end of turn t+N, it disappears, or at the start? The countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for a food with life span L at turn t, after turn t, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears.\n\nAt turn 7, food (1,6) has life span 3, so after turn 7, countdown=2; after turn 8, countdown=1; after turn 9, countdown=0, so disappears before turn 10 or at start of turn 10? I think after the turn, when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life span 3, same.\n\n(6,6) life span 7, so after turn 7, 6 left; etc.\n\n(4,1) life span 10.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (6,6) at turn 7.\n\nThen snake: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), tail (4,5). Head at (6,6), direction was R, but after move, direction is R since I moved right.\n\nNow, for turn 8, from (6,6), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move left (opposite).\n\nUp: (6,7) — y=7 is border wall, invalid.\n\nDown: (6,5) — let's check: walls? x=6,y=5. Borders: x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (6,5) not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (6,5) not among them. Snake positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (4,5). (6,5) not occupied. So down to (6,5) possible.\n\nRight: (7,6) — x=7 is border wall, invalid.\n\nLeft: (5,6) — but (5,6) is body segment, and opposite direction, so invalid.\n\nSo only possible move from (6,6) is down to (6,5).\n\nThen at turn 8, move down to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) has food? Food positions: (1,6), (2,1), (6,6) eaten, (4,1). (6,5) not listed, so no food.\n\nSo after move, snake moves: head to (6,5), body segments move: (5,6) to (6,6)? Positions before turn 8: head (6,6), body (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter moving head down to (6,5):\n\n- New head: (6,5)\n\n- Body segment 1 moves to previous head (6,6)\n\n- Body segment 2 moves to previous body1 (5,6)\n\n- Tail moves to previous body2 (4,6)\n\nSince no food eaten, tail is removed, so the segment at (4,5) is removed, and the new tail is at (5,6)? Let's list:\n\nNew positions: head at (6,5)\n\nThen the segment that was at (5,6) moves to (6,6) — but (6,6) is now occupied by the new body? Standard: each segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n\nAfter head moves to (6,5), the first body segment (which was at (5,6)) moves to where head was, (6,6)\n\nThe second body segment (which was at (4,6)) moves to where the first body was, (5,6)\n\nThe tail segment (which was at (4,5)) moves to where the second body was, (4,6)\n\nBut since no food eaten, we remove the tail, meaning we don't keep (4,6) as tail, but the last position is removed.\n\nSo new snake: head (6,5), body (6,6), body (5,6), and the tail is at (4,6) — since we moved to (4,6) but then remove it? No.\n\nInitial positions before turn 8 move:\n\n- Index 0: head (6,6)\n\n- Index 1: body (5,6)\n\n- Index 2: body (4,6)\n\n- Index 3: tail (4,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (6,5):\n\n- New head: (6,5)\n\n- Index 1 moves to index 0's old position: (6,6)\n\n- Index 2 moves to index 1's old position: (5,6)\n\n- Index 3 moves to index 2's old position: (4,6)\n\nThen, since no food, we remove the last segment, which was at (4,6) before it moved? When we say remove tail, we remove the segment that was the tail, so after moving, the positions are (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), and (4,6), but then we remove the last one, so new positions are head (6,5), body (6,6), body (5,6), and tail at (5,6)? No.\n\nThe tail segment is removed, so we have three segments: head (6,5), body (6,6), and body (5,6) — but (5,6) is now the tail.\n\nSince we moved from four segments, after moving and no eat, we have three segments: head at new position, and the first n-1 segments from the body.\n\nSpecifically: new head (6,5), then the first body segment at (6,6) (previous head), second body segment at (5,6) (previous body1), and the tail at (4,6) is removed, so the last body is at (5,6), which is now the tail.\n\nPositions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] — so tail at (5,6).\n\nLength back to 3.\n\nNow head at (6,5), direction down.\n\nTurn 9, from (6,5), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move up (opposite).\n\nUp: (6,6) — (6,6) is now occupied by body, so collision if move there, and also opposite direction.\n\nDown: (6,4) — but (6,4) is an internal obstacle wall, so invalid.\n\nLeft: (5,5) — let's check: walls? Not border, not internal obstacle (obstacles are (6,4),(5,1),etc., (5,5) not listed). Snake positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6). (5,5) not occupied. So possible.\n\nRight: (7,5) — x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (5,5).\n\nMove to (5,5) at turn 9.\n\nNo food there, so snake moves: head to (5,5), body (6,6) moves to (6,5), body (5,6) moves to (6,6)? Positions before: head (6,5), body (6,6), tail (5,6)\n\nAfter head to (5,5):\n\n- New head (5,5)\n\n- Body moves to previous head (6,5)\n\n- Tail moves to previous body (6,6)\n\nNo eat, so remove tail, new positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), tail at (6,5)? After move: head (5,5), body at (6,5), and tail at (6,6) but removed, so only head and body? Length 2? Initial before move: three segments.\n\nBefore turn 9: positions [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ]\n\nAfter head to (5,5):\n\n- New head (5,5)\n\n- Segment that was body at (6,6) moves to where head was (6,5)\n\n- Segment that was tail at (5,6) moves to where body was (6,6)\n\nThen no eat, remove last segment, which was at (6,6) after move? When we remove the tail, we remove the segment that was the tail before moving.\n\nAfter moving, the positions are (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), then we remove the last one, (6,6), so new snake: head (5,5), body (6,5), and tail at (6,5)? Only two positions: head (5,5) and body at (6,5), so tail at (6,5).\n\nLength 2.\n\nThen turn 10, from (5,5), direction left (since moved left from (6,5)).\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move right.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUp: (5,6) — (5,6) is now the tail? Current positions: head (5,5), body (6,5). (5,6) is free? Walls no, obstacles no, snake no, so possible.\n\nDown: (5,4) — y=4, not wall, obstacles? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), etc., (5,4) not listed, so possible.\n\nLeft: (4,5) — x=4,y=5, not wall, obstacles no, snake no, possible.\n\nRight: (6,5) — but (6,5) is body, and opposite direction, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nThis is getting messy, and I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nBut let's go back; this is one path if I move right at turn 7.\n\nAt turn 7, I have another option: move down to (5,5).\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nOption 2: at turn 7, move down to (5,5).\n\nThen, (5,5) no food, so snake moves: head to (5,5), body (4,6) moves to (5,6), tail (4,5) moves to (4,6)? Positions before: head (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter head to (5,5):\n\n- New head (5,5)\n\n- Body moves to previous head (5,6)\n\n- Tail moves to previous body (4,6)\n\nNo eat, remove tail, so new positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), tail at (5,6)? After move: head (5,5), body at (5,6), and tail at (4,6) removed, so snake: head (5,5), body (5,6), tail at (5,6)? Only one body segment: positions [(5,5), (5,6)] so tail at (5,6).\n\nLength 2.\n\nHead at (5,5), direction down.\n\nTurn 8, from (5,5), current direction D, so cannot move up.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nDown: (5,4) — not wall, not obstacle, not snake, possible.\n\nLeft: (4,5) — not wall, not obstacle, not snake, possible.\n\nRight: (6,5) — not wall, not obstacle, not snake, possible. (6,5) is free.\n\nUp: (5,6) — but (5,6) is body, and opposite, invalid.\n\nSo moves: D, L, R.\n\nNow, I need to think about the food available.\n\nFood at (1,6) life span 3, at turn 7, so after turn 7, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 9 or it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life span 3, same.\n\n(6,6) life span 7, plenty of time.\n\n(4,1) life span 10, plenty.\n\nAlso, there is a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, at turn 7, tail is at (4,5), and head at (5,6), are they adjacent? (5,6) and (4,5) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right. (5,6) and (4,5) are diagonal, not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other positions.\n\nNow, (1,6) is at turn 7 with life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 9 if not eaten.\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n\nCurrent head at (5,6), same y=6 row.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (6,4), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nAlso borders.\n\nTo reach (1,6), I need to go left from (5,6), but at (5,6), I can only move down or right, not left because body and opposite direction.\n\nIf I move down to (5,5) at turn 7, then to reach (1,6), I need to go to (4,5) or something.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move left to (4,5) or down to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (1,6) is at y=6, x=1.\n\nPath to (1,6): from (5,6), I can't go left directly. If I go down to (5,5), then I can go left to (4,5), then up to (4,6), but (4,6) was body, but after moving down, it might be different.\n\nLet's simulate the path to (1,6).\n\nFirst, at turn 7, if I move down to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), tail at (5,6)? Earlier: after move, snake [(5,5), (5,6)] so head (5,5), tail (5,6).\n\nThen turn 8, from (5,5), I can move left to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) no food, so move: head to (4,5), body (5,6) moves to (5,5), no eat, remove tail, so new snake: head (4,5), body (5,5), tail at (5,5)? Positions: [(4,5), (5,5)] tail at (5,5).\n\nThen turn 9, from (4,5), direction left (since moved left from (5,5)).\n\nCan move up to (4,6), or down to (4,4), or left to (3,5), or right to (5,5) but body.\n\n(4,6) is free? At turn 9, positions: head (4,5), body (5,5). (4,6) not occupied, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nMove up to (4,6) at turn 9.\n\n(4,6) has food? Food at (1,6), not (4,6). No food at (4,6), so move: head to (4,6), body (5,5) moves to (4,5), no eat, remove tail, so new head (4,6), body (4,5), tail at (4,5)? Positions: [(4,6), (4,5)] tail at (4,5).\n\nThen turn 10, from (4,6), I can move left to (3,6), and so on towards (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) life span: at turn 7, life span 3, after turn 7, 2 left; after turn 8, 1 left; after turn 9, 0, so it disappears before turn 10. So at turn 10, it's gone. I need to eat it by turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 is the last chance to eat (1,6).\n\nAt turn 9, where am I?\n\nIf I move down at turn 7 to (5,5), then turn 8 to (4,5), then turn 9 to (4,6), as above.\n\nAt turn 9, head at (4,6), and (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, so I need to move left to (3,6), but (4,6) to (3,6) is left, but at turn 9, from (4,6), I can move left to (3,6), but (1,6) is not reachable in one move; I need multiple moves, but turn 9 is the turn to eat, so I must be on (1,6) at turn 9.\n\nBut from (4,6) at turn 9, I can only move to adjacent cells, not to (1,6) directly. So I can't eat (1,6) if I go this path.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 7 I move right to (6,6), then as earlier, turn 8 to (6,5), turn 9 to (5,5), even farther from (1,6).\n\nSo in both cases, I cannot reach (1,6) by turn 9 to eat it, because at turn 7 I'm at (5,6), to reach (1,6) I need to move left 4 steps, but I can only move one per turn, and I can't move left at turn 7, so minimum turns to reach (1,6) is 4: for example, turn 7 down to (5,5), turn 8 left to (4,5), turn 9 up to (4,6), turn 10 left to (3,6), but (1,6) gone by turn 10, and turn 9 I'm at (4,6), not (1,6).\n\nFrom (5,6) at turn 7, if I could move left, I can't, so I cannot reach (1,6) before it disappears. Similarly, from (6,6) or (5,5), I'm even farther.\n\nSo (1,6) is unreachable within its life span; it will disappear uneaten. Similarly, (2,1) at (2,1), life span 3, same thing, far away, cannot reach in time.\n\n(2,1) is at x=2,y=1, head at (5,6), y=6 to y=1, 5 steps in y, plus x, but with obstacles, hard to reach in 3 turns.\n\nSo probably both (1,6) and (2,1) will disappear uneaten. Focus on other food.\n\nFood at (6,6) is at (6,6), which I can eat at turn 7 by moving right.\n\nFood at (4,1) at (4,1), life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,6), snake grows, which might be good for score, but I need to avoid risks.\n\nNow, let's think long-term.\n\nGrid is 8x8? Borders x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so 8 rows, 8 columns, but walls on borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, so valid x:1,2,3,4,5,6\n\ny:1,2,3,4,5,6\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo (6,4) is wall, (5,1) wall, (2,4) wall, (6,1) wall, (1,2) wall.\n\nNow, snake at turn 7: head (5,6), body (4,6), tail (4,5)\n\nIf I move right to (6,6), eat food, snake to length 4: positions (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n\nThen turn 8, only move down to (6,5), as earlier.\n\nThen positions: after move, no eat, snake to (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail at (5,6)? Length 3.\n\nHead at (6,5), direction down.\n\nThen turn 9, only move left to (5,5), as before.\n\nThen positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), tail at (6,6) or something. After move to (5,5), no eat, snake to (5,5), (6,5), tail at (6,5)? Length 2.\n\nHead at (5,5), direction left.\n\nNow, from here, I can move to other areas.\n\nFood at (4,1) is at (4,1), which is an internal obstacle? (4,1) is not listed in obstacles; obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,1) is wall, but (4,1) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\n(4,1) is a food position, so not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) eaten.\n\nSo (4,1) is available.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move down to (5,4), or left to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut let's see the risks.\n\nAnother thing: after moving to (6,6) at turn 7, I am at (6,6), which is near the corner, and with obstacles.\n\n(6,4) is wall below, so from (6,5), I can only go left, not down.\n\nThen to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I have food at (4,1) which is below.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating (6,6) immediately, and move down to (5,5) at turn 7 to have more space.\n\nIf I move down to (5,5) at turn 7, then snake: head (5,5), body (5,6), tail at (5,6)? Positions [(5,5), (5,6)] so head (5,5), tail (5,6).\n\nThen turn 8, from (5,5), I can move down to (5,4), left to (4,5), or right to (6,5).\n\nNow, (6,5) is free, as before.\n\nIf I move to (6,5), then head to (6,5), no food, so move: body (5,6) moves to (5,5), no eat, remove tail, so snake: head (6,5), body (5,5), tail at (5,5)? Length 2.\n\nHead at (6,5), direction right.\n\nThen turn 9, from (6,5), possible moves: up to (6,6), but (6,6) has food, but let's see.\n\n(6,6) food is still there? At turn 7, I didn't eat it, so it's there with life span decreasing.\n\nTurn 7: (6,6) life span 7, after turn 7, 6 left, so still there.\n\nFrom (6,5), current direction R, so cannot move left (opposite).\n\nUp: (6,6) — not wall, not obstacle, and has food. But is it safe? Snake positions: head (6,5), body (5,5). (6,6) not occupied, so move there.\n\nBut if I move to (6,6), I eat food, so snake grows.\n\nPositions before: head (6,5), body (5,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,6): new head (6,6), body moves to previous head (6,5), and since eat, add new segment at previous tail position (5,5), so new snake: head (6,6), body (6,5), body (5,5), tail at (5,5)? Positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5)] so tail at (5,5).\n\nLength 3.\n\nHead at (6,6), direction up.\n\nThen turn 10, from (6,6), similar to before, only move down to (6,5), but (6,5) is now body, so collision.\n\nPositions: head (6,6), body (6,5), body (5,5)\n\nIf I move down to (6,5), (6,5) is occupied by body, so collision, snake dies.\n\nOh, big problem.\n\nSo if at turn 9 I move up to (6,6) from (6,5), then at turn 10, I cannot move down because (6,5) is body, and I cannot move up or right or left? From (6,6), possible moves:\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move down.\n\nUp: (6,7) wall, invalid.\n\nDown: (6,5) body, collision.\n\nLeft: (5,6) — let's check. (5,6) not wall, not obstacle, and not occupied by snake? Snake has (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), so (5,6) is free.\n\nSo I can move left to (5,6).\n\nYes.\n\nAt turn 10, from (6,6), move left to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) no food, so move: head to (5,6), body (6,5) moves to (6,6), body (5,5) moves to (6,5), no eat, remove tail, so new positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), tail at (6,5)? After move: head (5,6), body at (6,6), body at (6,5), then remove last, so head (5,6), body (6,6), tail at (6,6)? Positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5)] but after removing tail, it should be head and body, so [(5,6), (6,6)] tail at (6,6).\n\nLength 2.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut back to the choice.\n\nAt turn 7, if I move down to (5,5), then at turn 8 I can choose where to go.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at x=4,y=1, life span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (5,1), which is below (5,1), so (4,1) might be accessible.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nPerhaps moving right to (6,6) at turn 7 is good because I get the food immediately, score +1, and snake grows, which might be beneficial for future, but I need to ensure I don't get stuck.\n\nAfter eating (6,6), at turn 8 I move to (6,5), then turn 9 to (5,5), then from (5,5), I can move down to (5,4) or left to (4,5), etc.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) at turn 9, move down to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) not wall, not obstacle (obstacles (6,4), but (5,4) ok), no food, so move: head to (5,4), body (6,5) moves to (5,5), no eat, remove tail, snake to (5,4), (5,5), tail at (5,5)? Length 2.\n\nThen turn 10, from (5,4), can move to (5,3), or (4,4), etc.\n\nThen I can head towards (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at y=1, so I need to go down.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (5,1), so from (4,2) I can move to (4,1), for example.\n\nBut let's see if I can plan a path to (4,1) from current position.\n\nBut I need to output a sequence of actions for the next turns, but the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., for at least 5 turns? The instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer should be a sequence, but it doesn't specify how many turns to list. Probably for a few turns, but based on the thinking.\n\nThe boxed answer should have actions for turn 7, 8, 9, etc., but how many? I think I need to decide for turn 7 first, then simulate.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the risks.\n\nAnother point: at turn 7, if I move to (6,6), I eat food, but (6,6) is near the corner, and with the obstacle at (6,4) below, I might get trapped if not careful.\n\nIf I move down to (5,5), I am more central, can go to (4,1) or other places.\n\nBut (4,1) is food, so I can eat it later.\n\nAlso, there is the tail reward danger, but not applicable now.\n\nLet's list all possible moves from current position at turn 7.\n\nOnly two choices: R to (6,6) or D to (5,5).\n\nIf I choose R to (6,6):\n- Turn 7: R, eat food, score +1, snake length 4, positions (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n- Turn 8: only D to (6,5), no eat, snake to (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail at (5,6)? Length 3: head (6,5), body (6,6), body (5,6)\n- Turn 9: from (6,5), only L to (5,5), no eat, snake to (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), but after move, head to (5,5), body (6,6) to (6,5), body (5,6) to (6,6), then remove tail, so (5,5), (6,5), tail at (6,6) removed, so head (5,5), body (6,5), tail at (6,5)? Length 2: [(5,5), (6,5)]\n\nThen from here, I have more freedom.\n\nIf I choose D to (5,5) at turn 7:\n- Turn 7: D to (5,5), no eat, snake to (5,5), (5,6), tail at (5,6)? Length 2: head (5,5), body (5,6)\n- Turn 8: from (5,5), I can move D to (5,4), L to (4,5), or R to (6,5)\n\nIf I move R to (6,5):\n  - Turn 8: R to (6,5), no eat, snake to (6,5), (5,5), tail at (5,5)? Length 2: head (6,5), body (5,5)\n  - Turn 9: from (6,5), move U to (6,6) to eat food, then as before, head (6,6), body (6,5), and add new at (5,5), so snake (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)\n  - Turn 10: from (6,6), move L to (5,6), no food, then snake to (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), remove tail, so head (5,6), body (6,6), tail at (6,6)? Length 2: (5,6), (6,6)\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut in this case, I ate the food at (6,6) at turn 9.\n\nIf at turn 8 I move L to (4,5) from (5,5):\n  - Turn 8: L to (4,5), no eat, snake to (4,5), (5,5), tail at (5,5)? Length 2\n  - Turn 9: from (4,5), can move U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5) body\n    If U to (4,6), no food, snake to (4,6), (4,5), tail at (4,5)? Length 2\n  - Then I can go towards (4,1), but (4,1) is far.\n\nTo maximize score, eating (6,6) is good, and it has long life span, so I can eat it later, but if I eat it now, I get the score and grow, which might allow me to reach other food or something, but in snake, growing can make it harder to maneuver in tight spaces.\n\nHere the grid has obstacles, so shorter snake might be easier to move.\n\nBut for long-term, growing is good for score.\n\nPrioritize survival.\n\nAt turn 7, moving to (6,6) might be riskier because I'm near the wall and obstacle.\n\nFor example, after moving to (6,6), at turn 8 I have to move down to (6,5), then turn 9 to (5,5), and from there I can go to (5,4) or (4,5), both are safe for now.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (5,5), I have choices.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), and there is an obstacle at (5,1), so to reach (4,1), I can go to (4,2) then down to (4,1), but (4,2) is free? Obstacles include (1,2), but (4,2) not listed, so free.\n\nFrom current head at (5,6), to (4,1), it's 5 steps down and 1 left, but with obstacles, not direct.\n\nFor example, path: turn 7 D to (5,5), turn 8 D to (5,4), turn 9 D to (5,3), but (5,3) not wall, obstacles no, then turn 10 D to (5,2), then turn 11 D to (5,1), but (5,1) is obstacle wall, so cannot.\n\n(5,1) is wall, so I cannot go to (5,1).\n\nFrom (5,2), I can move left to (4,2), then down to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,2) is free, (4,1) is food.\n\nSo from (5,6): turn 7 D to (5,5), turn 8 D to (5,4), turn 9 D to (5,3), turn 10 D to (5,2), turn 11 L to (4,2), turn 12 D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nLife span of (4,1) is 10 at turn 7, after turn 7, 9 left, after turn 8,8, ..., after turn 12, 10-5=5 left? Turn 7: life span 10, after turn 7, 9 left; after turn 8,8; turn 9,7; turn 10,6; turn 11,5; turn 12,4 left, so still there.\n\nSimilarly, if I move right first, I can still go to (4,1) later.\n\nBut if I eat (6,6) at turn 7, I have a longer snake, which might make it harder to navigate, but at length 4, it's not too bad.\n\nAt turn 7, after eating (6,6), snake is at (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), so it occupies those cells.\n\nThen when I move to (6,5), it frees up (4,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), I need to go down and left.\n\nFrom (5,5) at turn 9, I can go down to (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), then to (4,2), (4,1).\n\n(5,2) to (4,2) is left, then (4,2) to (4,1) down.\n\n(4,1) is at y=1, so moving down to it.\n\nAll possible.\n\nBut there is food at (6,6) which I can eat now or later.\n\nIf I eat it now, I get the score immediately.\n\nIf I eat it later, it might disappear, but life span 7, so after turn 7, 6 left, so I have until turn 13 to eat it, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) life span 10, until turn 17.\n\nSo I can eat (6,6) later if I want.\n\nBut at turn 7, moving to (6,6) is safe and I get the food.\n\nMoving down to (5,5) is also safe, and I keep options open.\n\nBut in moving down, I don't eat food, so no score gain.\n\nBut for long-term, I can eat both foods.\n\nAnother point: the grid has limited space, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFor example, the area near (6,6) has walls and obstacles, so it might be risky to stay there.\n\nWhereas (5,5) is more central.\n\nAlso, with the internal obstacles, the playable area is reduced.\n\nFor instance, (5,1) is wall, so row y=1 has (4,1) free, but (5,1) blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) wall, (6,4) wall, etc.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat the available food when possible.\n\nAt turn 7, (6,6) is adjacent, so I can eat it now.\n\nIf I don't, I can eat it later from other positions.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger, not applicable now.\n\nI think moving right to (6,6) at turn 7 is a good choice to get the food and grow.\n\nThen for turn 8, move down to (6,5).\n\nThen turn 9, move left to (5,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), at turn 10, I can move down to (5,4) to start heading towards (4,1).\n\nOr other directions.\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence for several turns.\n\nSince the state might change, I need to plan for turn 7 first.\n\nPerhaps I can plan 5 turns ahead.\n\nLet's decide for turn 7: I'll move right to (6,6).\n\nThen turn 8: down to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: left to (5,5)\n\nNow at turn 9, head at (5,5), direction left.\n\nThen turn 10, from (5,5), I can move down to (5,4), or left to (4,5), or up to (5,6), but (5,6) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 9, positions: before turn 9, head at (6,5), body (6,6), tail (5,6)? After move to (5,5), snake is head (5,5), body (6,5), tail at (6,6) removed, so only (5,5) and (6,5), tail at (6,5).\n\nSo (5,6) is free.\n\nAt turn 10, from (5,5), move down to (5,4) to go towards lower area.\n\n(5,4) not wall, not obstacle, no food.\n\nThen turn 11, from (5,4), move down to (5,3), and so on.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), I need to go left at some point.\n\nSince (5,1) is wall, I need to go to (4,2) first.\n\nSo from (5,5), move left to (4,5) at turn 10.\n\nThen from (4,5), move down to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut let's list the sequence for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 7: R to (6,6)\n\nTurn 8: D to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: L to (5,5)\n\nThen for turn 10, I can move L to (4,5) or D to (5,4).\n\nMoving to (4,5) might be better to avoid the obstacle at (5,1) later.\n\nFrom (5,5), move left to (4,5) at turn 10.\n\nThen turn 11, from (4,5), move down to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about the food.\n\nSince I ate (6,6) at turn 7, I have one food.\n\n(4,1) is far, so I can go there.\n\nFor the answer, I can list turns 7 to 11.\n\nBut let's see if moving down at turn 7 is better.\n\nIf turn 7 D to (5,5), then turn 8, I can move to (6,5) to be near (6,6) for later.\n\nTurn 8: R to (6,5), no eat.\n\nThen turn 9: U to (6,6), eat food.\n\nThen turn 10: L to (5,6), no eat.\n\nThen turn 11: from (5,6), can move U, D, L, R, but (4,6) might be free, etc.\n\nBut in this case, I ate food at turn 9, later than turn 7.\n\nBut score is the same, +1.\n\nBut in terms of survival, both seem ok.\n\nBut with the longer path, there might be more risk.\n\nI think moving right at turn 7 is fine.\n\nAlso, for the sequence, I'll go with that.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 7: R (right)\n\nTurn 8: D (down)\n\nTurn 9: L (left)\n\nThen for turn 10, from (5,5), I need to choose.\n\nSince the answer should be for the current state, and I think 5 turns is sufficient.\n\nTurn 10: I'll move L to (4,5) to go left towards the center or to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,5), move D to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, but for the box, I can list up to turn 11 or something.\n\nThe format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't say how many.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turns 7 to 11.\n\nBut at turn 10, the state changes, so I should only provide for turn 7 first, but the instruction says to output a sequence.\n\nLet's read the answer format.\n\n\"Answer Format\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1\nTurn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1\n...\n}\"\n\nIt says \"...\" so I need to provide multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many. Probably as many as I can or for a few turns.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide at least 5 actions.\n\nCurrent t1=7, so turns 7,8,9,10,11.\n\nFor turn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,5), move L to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4) to continue down.\n\nOr move L to (3,5), but to (4,1), down is better.\n\nMove D to (4,4).\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nTurn 10: L  // to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: D  // to (4,4)\n\nBut at turn 10, moving to (4,5), is it safe? From (5,5) to (4,5), not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, turn 11 to (4,4), same.\n\nThen I can reach (4,1) eventually.\n\nIf I had moved down at turn 7, I might not have eaten the food yet.\n\nBut with this, I have one food eaten.\n\nSo I think this is ok.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and simulated multiple turn sequences at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- Eating the positive food at (6,6) immediately (turn 7) provides a +1 score and grows the snake, but places the snake near the wall and obstacles. However, with careful planning, the snake can safely navigate away.\n- Food at (1,6) and (2,1) have short life spans (3 turns) and are unreachable before they disappear (by turn 9), so they are ignored.\n- Food at (4,1) has a long life span (10 turns) and can be targeted later.\n- Moving right to (6,6) at turn 7 is safe and immediately beneficial, as it avoids the risk of the food disappearing or the snake becoming trapped in the corner later.\n- After eating (6,6), the only safe move at turn 8 is down to (6,5), then left to (5,5) at turn 9 to centralize the snake.\n- From (5,5), moving left to (4,5) at turn 10 and down to (4,4) at turn 11 starts a path toward (4,1) while avoiding obstacles and maintaining maneuverability.\n\nThe planned sequence for turns 7–11 is:\n- Turn 7: Move right to (6,6) to eat the food (+1 score, snake grows to length 4).\n- Turn 8: Move down to (6,5) (only safe move; no food).\n- Turn 9: Move left to (5,5) (no food; snake shortens to length 2 after move).\n- Turn 10: Move left to (4,5) to head toward the area near (4,1) (no food).\n- Turn 11: Move down to (4,4) to continue toward (4,1) (no food).\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats one food immediately, avoids all risks (walls, obstacles, body collisions), and positions it to target the remaining food at (4,1) in subsequent turns. Thinking beyond turn 11, the snake can proceed to (4,3), (4,2), and (4,1) to eat the food there, leveraging the long life span.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: R (right)\nTurn 8: D (down)\nTurn 9: L (left)\nTurn 10: L (left)\nTurn 11: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 8, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 steps ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls blocking some cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,6), then body segments at (5,6), (4,6), and tail at (4,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is Right, meaning it was moving right to get to (6,6) from (5,6).\n\nFood available:\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, so at turn 8, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let me read carefully.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (1,6) with life span 2 at turn 8: after turn 8, life span becomes 1; after turn 9, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) value 1, life span 2: same, available on turn 8 and 9.\n\n(4,1) value 1, life span 9: available for many turns.\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, so they increase length by 1 when eaten.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves starting from turn 8. Since I'm at turn 8, I need to choose an action for turn 8, then turn 9, etc., for at least 5 turns.\n\nBut the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc. So I should output actions for turn 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 at least.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can't go there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked.\n\nSnake: head at (6,6), body: (5,6), (4,6), tail (4,5). So from head to tail: (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (4,6) -> (4,5). Head direction is R, so it came from left to (6,6).\n\nFood: (1,6) at y=6, x=1; (2,1) at x=2,y=1; (4,1) at x=4,y=1.\n\nLife spans: (1,6) life span 2, so after turn 8 it will have life 1, gone after turn 9.\n\n(2,1) life span 2, same.\n\n(4,1) life span 9, long time.\n\nSince head is at (6,6) and direction is R, possible moves from here: I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nNo instant reverse: current direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n\nSo allowed moves: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n\nR (right) to (7,6), but x=7 is a wall, so that's invalid. x=7 is border wall, so (7,6) is out of bounds or wall, can't move there.\n\nSimilarly, D (down) to (6,5)? y=5, but let's see coordinates: y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? The problem doesn't specify, but typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top. In the walls, it says y=0 and y=7 are borders, but in snake positions, head at (6,6), and tail at (4,5), which is lower y, so probably y increases upwards or downwards?\n\nSnake positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)] so from (4,6) to (4,5), y decreased from 6 to 5, so moving down? Head direction is R, which is right, so from (5,6) to (6,6), x increased.\n\ny=6 to y=5 is decreasing y, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But in walls, it says y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 might be bottom wall, y=7 top wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left wall, x=7 right wall.\n\nSo moving up increases y, down decreases y.\n\nIn movement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up.\n\nD is (x,y-1), down.\n\nL is (x-1,y), left.\n\nR is (x+1,y), right.\n\nAnd walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we cannot move to those cells.\n\nAlso internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) are blocked.\n\nBack to head at (6,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (6,6+1) = (6,7). y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n\n- D: (6,6-1) = (6,5). Is this valid? (6,5) is not a wall? Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (6,5) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) is not listed. Obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), etc., so (6,5) is free? But snake body? Snake is at (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), so (6,5) is empty? (4,5) is tail, but (6,5) is different cell.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells: snake occupies (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5). So (6,5) is not occupied by snake. Walls: not a wall, so (6,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, L: left to (5,6). But (5,6) is the second segment of the snake. Moving to body segment? But rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail under certain conditions.\n\nRule: deadly collision if head touches any body segment. But you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n\nHere, if I move left to (5,6), that's the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (4,5). So (5,6) is a body segment, so if I move there, head collides with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, R: right to (7,6), but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nU: up to (6,7), y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is D: down to (6,5).\n\nIs that right? U and R are walls, L is body, so only D is possible? But let's confirm.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,6)\n\nMove U: (6,7) - y=7, border wall, invalid.\n\nMove D: (6,5) - not wall, not occupied? Snake is at (4,5), but (6,5) is empty, and no obstacle listed. Obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) is not (6,4), so should be free.\n\nMove L: (5,6) - occupied by snake body (second segment), so collision, death.\n\nMove R: (7,6) - x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is D, down to (6,5).\n\nBut that seems forced. Is there any other option? No, only down is safe.\n\nBut let's think: after moving down, the tail is at (4,5), which will move when we eat food or not? Since we're moving, the snake moves forward, so if no food eaten, tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, moving to (6,5), which is empty, so no food eaten, so snake moves: head to (6,5), and tail segment at (4,5) moves to... the body segments shift.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves away from its position.\n\nSpecifically, from positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nAfter moving down to (6,5): head to (6,5), then body: (5,6) should move to where head was? No.\n\nThe new positions: head moves to (6,5), then the first body segment (5,6) becomes the new position for the segment that was behind head, but since head moved, the segment that was at (5,6) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement.\n\nAfter move, snake positions: new head at (6,5), then the segment that was at (6,6) is now the first body segment? Let's think.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (6,6), index 1: (5,6), index 2: (4,6), index 3: tail (4,5)\n\nAfter moving down to (6,5): new head at (6,5). Then, the body segments follow: the segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, so (5,6) moves to (6,6)? No.\n\nTypically, the body segment at index i moves to the position of index i-1 from previous state.\n\nAfter move: new positions: head at new position (6,5). Then, the first body segment is at the old head position (6,6). Second body segment at old first body position (5,6). Tail at old second body position (4,6). The old tail (4,5) is left, so the cell (4,5) is now empty.\n\nSo new snake positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)] and tail at (4,6)? Positions: head (6,5), body1 (6,6), body2 (5,6), tail (4,6). So (4,5) is free now.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 8, I must move down, no choice.\n\nBut the food at (1,6) is at y=6, x=1, which is on the same row, but far left.\n\nAlso, (4,1) at x=4,y=1, bottom left.\n\nNow, for turn 8, I have to move down to (6,5).\n\nBut let's confirm if (6,5) is safe. No walls, no snake body except the tail might be, but tail is at (4,5), different cell. After move, tail is at (4,6), but (6,5) is empty.\n\nAlso, no food at (6,5), so no eating.\n\nNow, after this move, head at (6,5), direction was R, but I moved D, so new head direction is D.\n\nNow, for turn 9, I need to choose action.\n\nFirst, let's list the state after turn 8 move.\n\nTurn 8 action: D\n\nThen snake positions: head (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)  // tail at (4,6)\n\n(4,6) is the tail.\n\nFood: (1,6) life span was 2 at turn 8, after turn 8, it decreases to life span 1, so still available at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life span 2 at turn 8, decreases to 1 at turn 9.\n\n(4,1) life span 9, decreases to 8 at turn 9.\n\nNow turn 9, head at (6,5), direction D (since I moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Current direction is D, so cannot move U (up), because opposite.\n\nSo allowed: D (down), L (left), R (right).\n\nNow, check each:\n\n- D: down to (6,4). But (6,4) is an internal obstacle! Walls include (6,4), so blocked, invalid.\n\n- R: right to (7,5). x=7 is border wall, invalid.\n\n- L: left to (5,5). Is this free? (5,5) not wall, not occupied? Snake is at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), so (5,5) empty. Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,5).\n\nAgain, forced? Let me see.\n\nU is not allowed because no reverse, and even if, U to (6,6) which is now occupied by body. (6,6) is first body segment, so moving there would collide.\n\nBut U is not allowed because reverse is forbidden.\n\nD to (6,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (7,5) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,5) free, so yes, only move is L to (5,5).\n\nSo turn 9 action: L\n\nNow, after moving to (5,5), no food there, so snake moves: head to (5,5), body segments: the segment that was at (6,5) moves to where? Old positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), body (5,6), tail (4,6)\n\nAfter move left to (5,5): new head (5,5), then body at old head (6,5), then body at old first body (6,6), tail at old second body (5,6). Old tail (4,6) left free.\n\nSo new positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nTail at (5,6).\n\nHead direction now L (left).\n\nNow turn 10.\n\nHead at (5,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: no instant reverse, so cannot move R (right).\n\nAllowed: U, D, L.\n\nNow, check:\n\n- U: up to (5,6). But (5,6) is now the tail! (5,6) is the tail segment.\n\nRule: can move into tail cell because tail will move away.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to the tail cell, and tail moves, so no collision if it's only the tail and it moves.\n\nHere, (5,6) is the tail, so moving there might be safe, as long as after move, the tail is no longer there.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell, if it's food, it eats, then tail doesn't move, so if head moves to tail cell and eats, then tail stays, but in this case, (5,6) has food? Let's see food positions.\n\nFood: (1,6), (2,1), (4,1). (5,6) is not a food position, so no food there. Therefore, when head moves to (5,6), since no food, tail will move away, so no collision.\n\nConfirm: if head moves to the current tail position, and no food is eaten, then the tail moves forward, so the head occupies the cell, and the tail is gone from there, so no problem.\n\nOnly if there is food and it eats, then tail doesn't move, but since no food, it's fine.\n\nAlso, body collision: but tail is not considered body for collision when moving into it, as per rule.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nYes, so moving to (5,6) is safe.\n\n- D: down to (5,4). Is this free? (5,4) not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), so (5,4) empty. Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,4) not, so should be free.\n\n- L: left to (4,5). (4,5) is free? Earlier it was tail, but now empty. Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- R: but cannot, reverse forbidden.\n\nNow, U to (5,6) is possible, and it's tail.\n\nD to (5,4) possible.\n\nL to (4,5) possible.\n\nSo multiple choices.\n\nAlso, need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood positions: (1,6) at turn 9, life span was 1 (after turn 8 decrease), at turn 9 it decreases to 0 after turn 9, so it can be eaten on turn 9 or before, but turn 9 is now, and we're at (5,5), far from (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6, we are at (5,5), so not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) at turn 9 life span 1, decreases to 0 after turn 9, so available only this turn? After turn 9 it disappears, so can be eaten on turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: at start of turn, life span of (1,6) is 1, and (2,1) is 1.\n\nAfter the turn, if not eaten, life span decreases, so for (1,6), after turn 9, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1).\n\n(4,1) has life span 8 after turn 9? At turn 8, life span 9, after turn 8 decrease to 8? Let's track life spans.\n\nInitial at turn 8:\n\n- (1,6): value 1, life span 2\n\n- (2,1): value 1, life span 2\n\n- (4,1): value 1, life span 9\n\nAfter turn 8: we moved, no food eaten, so all food life spans decrease by 1.\n\nSo after turn 8:\n\n- (1,6): life span 1\n\n- (2,1): life span 1\n\n- (4,1): life span 8\n\nNow turn 9: at the beginning, food available with above life spans. We move, if not eaten, after move, life spans decrease again.\n\nFor turn 9, head at (5,5), we move to (5,5) via L? In turn 9, we moved to (5,5), which has no food, so no eat, so after turn 9, life spans decrease: (1,6) life span 1-1=0, disappears; (2,1) life span 1-1=0, disappears; (4,1) life span 8-1=7.\n\n(1,6) and (2,1) will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nBut (1,6) is at (1,6), which is far, we can't reach it from (5,5) in one move, so impossible to eat on turn 9. Similarly, (2,1) at (2,1), also far.\n\nSo both will disappear after turn 9.\n\nOnly (4,1) remains with life span 7.\n\nNow back to turn 10 choices.\n\nHead at (5,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L (since no reverse to R).\n\n- U to (5,6): this is the current tail position. As we said, no food there, so moving there is safe, tail will move.\n\n- D to (5,4): down, free cell.\n\n- L to (4,5): left, free cell.\n\nNow, we need to think about getting to (4,1) or other areas.\n\nAlso, the grid has obstacles, so let's find a path.\n\nFirst, where is (4,1)? x=4,y=1.\n\nWe are at (5,5).\n\nWe need to go down and left.\n\nIf I move L to (4,5), that's closer to (4,1).\n\nOr D to (5,4), then I can go down further.\n\nU to (5,6) might not be helpful, since y=6 is top, and food is at y=1 bottom.\n\ny=0 bottom, y=7 top, so y=1 is near bottom.\n\nSo moving down is better.\n\nBut let's see the obstacles to avoid.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1) is obstacle, so at y=1, x=5 is blocked, but (4,1) is at x=4,y=1, which might be accessible.\n\nAlso, (2,4) obstacle, etc.\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to survive and eat (4,1) or other food that may spawn, but currently only (4,1) is available.\n\nAfter turn 9, (1,6) and (2,1) are gone, only (4,1) with life span 7.\n\nAt turn 10, head at (5,5), I need to move.\n\nLet me consider options.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (4,5)\n\nThen head to (4,5), direction L.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: no reverse, so cannot move R (since current direction L).\n\nAllowed: U, D, L.\n\nU to (4,6): (4,6) is occupied? After previous moves, snake positions: after turn 9, snake is at [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nAfter moving to (4,5) in turn 10: new head (4,5), body at old head (5,5), body at (6,5), tail at (6,6). Old tail (5,6) left free.\n\n(4,5) was free, no issue.\n\nNow, from (4,5), direction L.\n\nMove U to (4,6): (4,6) is now body? In new positions, after move, body is at (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), so (4,6) is free? Not occupied, not wall, so can move U to (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, D to (4,4): free? Assuming.\n\nL to (3,5): left.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, at (4,5), I can go to (4,1) by moving down multiple times, but need to avoid obstacles.\n\n(4,5) to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), but (4,2) and (4,3) should be free, obstacles are at (2,4), etc., not on x=4 except (4,1) is food.\n\n(4,1) is food, not obstacle.\n\nObstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but not (4,1).\n\nSo path down from (4,5) to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) seems clear.\n\nBut at (4,1), I can eat the food.\n\nBut I need to see if I can reach it.\n\nFrom current position (5,5) at turn 10, if I move L to (4,5), then on turn 11, I can move D to (4,4), turn 12 D to (4,3), turn 13 D to (4,2), turn 14 D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nBut life span of (4,1) is 7 after turn 9? Let's track turns.\n\nTurn 9: after turn 9, food (4,1) life span 7 (since decreased from 8 after turn 9).\n\nAt start of turn 10, life span 7.\n\nIf I eat on turn 14, that would be after 4 more turns, so turn 14.\n\nAfter turn 10, life span 6; turn 11, 5; turn 12, 4; turn 13, 3; turn 14, 2? Let's list:\n\nAt start of turn t:\n\nAfter turn 9 (t=9), (4,1) life span 7.\n\nAfter turn 10, if not eaten, life span 6.\n\nAfter turn 11, 5.\n\nAfter turn 12, 4.\n\nAfter turn 13, 3.\n\nAfter turn 14, 2? After each turn, when we move, after the move, life span decreases if not eaten.\n\nAt beginning of turn t, life span is L, if not eaten during turn t, after turn t, life span becomes L-1.\n\nSo for (4,1):\n\nStart turn 10: life span 7\n\nIf not eaten turn 10, after turn 10, life span 6\n\nStart turn 11: 6, if not eaten, after turn 11, 5\n\nStart turn 12: 5, after not eaten, 4\n\nStart turn 13: 4, after not eaten, 3\n\nStart turn 14: 3, after not eaten, 2\n\nStart turn 15: 2, etc.\n\nSo on turn 14, start with life span 3, can eat, and after eat, it doesn't decrease further since eaten.\n\nSo I can eat on turn 14 with no problem.\n\nBut from (4,5) to (4,1) directly down, but y decreases: from y=5 to y=4,3,2,1.\n\nEach move down decreases y.\n\nNow, back to turn 10, other options.\n\nIf I move D from (5,5) to (5,4)\n\nThen head to (5,4), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move to (5,3), etc., but to reach (4,1), I need to go left as well.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), move L to (4,4), then down to (4,3), etc., but similar.\n\nBut (5,1) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly down on x=5, because at y=1, (5,1) blocked, so I have to go left to x=4 to reach (4,1).\n\nSo moving directly to (4,5) might be faster.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6) at turn 10.\n\n(5,6) is current tail, but as we move there, tail moves.\n\nAfter moving to (5,6), since no food, tail moves away.\n\nBut (5,6) is at y=6, higher, away from (4,1), so not efficient.\n\nMoreover, we might get stuck or something.\n\nSo better to move towards the food.\n\nNow, another thing: Tail Reward Danger.\n\nBut in this case, (4,1) is not under tail, and tail will be elsewhere.\n\nBut let's see current tail position.\n\nAt turn 10 start, tail is at (5,6).\n\nAfter moving, depending on action.\n\nBut (4,1) is far, so no issue.\n\nNow, for the path to (4,1), I need to make sure I don't collide or something.\n\nFrom (5,5), move L to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 11: head at (4,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L (no R reverse).\n\nNow, U to (4,6): should be free.\n\nD to (4,4): free.\n\nL to (3,5): left.\n\nTo reach (4,1), I should move D down.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,5), move D to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 12: head at (4,4), direction D.\n\nMove D to (4,3), and so on.\n\nBut let's see if there are obstacles on the way.\n\nCells: (4,5) to (4,4): should be free.\n\n(4,4) to (4,3): free.\n\n(4,3) to (4,2): free.\n\n(4,2) to (4,1): (4,1) is food, so when I move there, I eat, length increases.\n\nBut is (4,2) free? No obstacles listed, and snake not there.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3), etc.\n\nBut internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but x=2,y=4, not on x=4.\n\n(5,1) obstacle, but x=5.\n\n(6,4), etc.\n\nSo x=4 column seems clear from y=1 to y=5.\n\ny=1: (4,1) is food, not wall.\n\ny=0 is wall, but we don't go there.\n\nSo path is clear.\n\nNow, but I need to think about survival beyond that, but first, let's plan to eat this food.\n\nAlso, since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, from turn 8.\n\nTurn 8: we must move D to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: must move L to (5,5) as we had no choice.\n\nThen turn 10: I can choose to move L to (4,5) to start heading down.\n\nBut at turn 10, I could move D to (5,4), but that might be slower.\n\nFor example, if I move D to (5,4) at turn 10.\n\nThen head at (5,4), direction D.\n\nThen I need to move left to (4,4) or down to (5,3), but (5,3) to (5,2), but (5,1) is obstacle, so at (5,2), I cannot go down to (5,1), must move left or right.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), from (5,2), move L to (4,2), then down to (4,1).\n\nBut compared to moving to (4,5) directly, it takes more moves.\n\nLet's count moves to reach (4,1) from current positions.\n\nAt turn 10 start, head at (5,5).\n\nIf move L to (4,5) at turn 10: reach (4,5) at turn 10 end.\n\nThen turn 11: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 14: D to (4,1) and eat.\n\nEat on turn 14.\n\nIf at turn 10, move D to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 11: need to move, say L to (4,4) or D to (5,3)\n\nIf move L to (4,4) at turn 11: then turn 12 D to (4,3), turn 13 D to (4,2), turn 14 D to (4,1) eat. Same as above, but turn 11 move to (4,4), whereas in previous, at turn 11 I was at (4,4)? In first path: turn 10 to (4,5), turn 11 to (4,4), turn 12 to (4,3), turn 13 to (4,2), turn 14 to (4,1).\n\nIn second: turn 10 to (5,4), turn 11 to (4,4), turn 12 to (4,3), turn 13 to (4,2), turn 14 to (4,1). Same number of turns to eat.\n\nBut in second path, I went to (5,4) first, which is not necessary.\n\nIf I move down further on x=5, I hit obstacle at y=1, so I have to turn left eventually.\n\nBut in terms of steps, to reach (4,1), from (5,5), moving L then D is direct.\n\nMoving D then L might be similar, but since (5,1) blocked, I need to move left at some point.\n\nBut in this case, both ways take 4 moves to (4,1) from (5,5): min Manhattan distance |dx| + |dy| = |1| + |4| = 5? From (5,5) to (4,1): delta x = -1, delta y = -4, so |dx| + |dy| = 5, so at least 5 moves.\n\n(5,5) to (4,1): x from 5 to 4, down 1; y from 5 to 1, down 4; so total 5 steps down and left, but since I can only move one per turn, min 5 turns.\n\nIn my path: turn 10 to (4,5) or (5,4), both are closer? (4,5) is distance |0| + |4| =4? (4,5) to (4,1) is |0| + |4| =4, so from (5,5) to (4,5) is one step left, then to (4,1) is 4 down, total 5 steps.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,4) is one down, then to (4,1) is one left and three down? (5,4) to (4,1) is |1| left + |3| down =4 steps? |dx|=1, |dy|=3, total 4, but I need to move sequentially.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (4,4) is one left, then (4,4) to (4,3) down, (4,3) to (4,2) down, (4,2) to (4,1) down, so 4 steps: left, down, down, down.\n\nBut (4,1) is reached on the fourth move.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,5) to (4,5) left, then (4,5) to (4,4) down, (4,4) to (4,3) down, (4,3) to (4,2) down, (4,2) to (4,1) down, so five moves: first to (4,5), then to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1).\n\nIn sequence:\n\nStart turn 10 at (5,5)\n\nMove to (4,5) on turn 10\n\nThen turn 11: to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: to (4,2)\n\nTurn 14: to (4,1) and eat.\n\nSo eat on turn 14.\n\nIf I go via (5,4):\n\nTurn 10: to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 11: to (4,4)  // move left\n\nTurn 12: to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: to (4,2)\n\nTurn 14: to (4,1) eat.\n\nSame turn to eat.\n\nBut in the first way, by moving left first to (4,5), I am on x=4, which is the target column, and I can go straight down.\n\nIf I move down to (5,4), I have to move left later.\n\nBut no difference in timing.\n\nNow, at (5,5), I could move U to (5,6), but that is away, and (5,6) might be free, but it wastes a move, and I might not reach in time, but life span is long, but better to go directly.\n\nMoreover, moving up might lead to dead ends or something.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), I can move left to (4,6), but (4,6) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 10, if I move U to (5,6), then head at (5,6), but at turn 10 start, (5,6) is tail, but after move, it's head.\n\nThen from there, I can move left to (4,6), which is free, then down, but to (4,1), it takes more moves: from (5,6) to (4,6) left, then (4,6) to (4,5) down, etc., same as before but from higher y.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo best to move directly towards food.\n\nNow, back to the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nIn this case, when I eat (4,1), the tail is not adjacent, so no problem.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nAnother thing: when I move down from (4,5) to (4,4), etc., is there any risk?\n\nFor example, at turn 11, head at (4,5), move down to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 12 to (4,3), turn 13 to (4,2).\n\nAt turn 13, head at (4,2), move down to (4,1) to eat.\n\nNow, when I move to (4,1), the snake body: let's track the snake positions.\n\nFirst, after turn 9: snake positions [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]\n\nAfter turn 10: if move L to (4,5), new positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), body (6,5), tail (6,6)\n\nAfter turn 11: move D to (4,4), new head (4,4), body at old head (4,5), body at (5,5), tail at (6,5). (6,6) left.\n\nAfter turn 12: move D to (4,3), head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nAfter turn 13: move D to (4,2), head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter turn 14: move D to (4,1), head (4,1), and since food is eaten, the snake grows, so tail does not move. New positions: head (4,1), then the body segments: the segment that was at head becomes body, so body at (4,2), body at (4,3), body at (4,4), and tail at (4,5). Since we ate, length increases, so the tail stays, and we add a new segment where tail was or something? Standard: when eat, head moves to food, new head position, and the tail does not move, so the body gains one segment.\n\nPrevious positions before move: head at (4,2), body at (4,3), (4,4), tail at (4,5)\n\nMove to (4,1), which has food, so eat: new head at (4,1), then body segments: first body at old head (4,2), second body at (4,3), third body at (4,4), and tail remains at (4,5), but since we grow, the tail stays, and we have an additional segment? Length was 4, after eating, length 5.\n\nPositions: new head (4,1), then the previous head becomes first body: (4,2), then previous first body (4,3) becomes second body, previous second body (4,4) becomes third body, and previous tail (4,5) becomes the new tail, but since we grow, we add a segment, so the tail position stays, and we have one more segment.\n\nAfter eating, the tail does not move, so the positions are: new head at food cell, then all previous body segments remain, including the tail, so the snake has one more segment.\n\nSo positions: head (4,1), body (4,2), body (4,3), body (4,4), tail (4,5). Yes, all on column x=4, y from 1 to 5.\n\nNow, head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to move away, but that's beyond the planning, but for now, I have a plan to eat the food.\n\nBut in the process, from turn 10 to 14, I moved directly to the food.\n\nBut at turn 8 and 9, I had no choice, only one move each.\n\nNow for turn 10, I have choices, but moving L to (4,5) is best to start the descent.\n\nI could move D to (5,4), but as we saw, it doesn't save time.\n\nNow, but I need to output actions for turn 8 to at least turn 12, since 5 turns ahead from turn 8.\n\nTurn 8,9,10,11,12: that's 5 turns.\n\nIn my plan, turn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nTurn 10: L to (4,5) or D to (5,4)? I think L to (4,5) is fine.\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,5), move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: from (4,4), move D to (4,3)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for answer, I need to specify actions up to turn 12 or more.\n\nThe output should be from turn t1 to t1+4 or t1+5? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so at least 5 actions: turn 8,9,10,11,12.\n\nIn the plan, turn 12 is moving to (4,3), not yet eaten, but that's fine.\n\nNow, but I need to ensure that at each step, the moves are valid.\n\nFor example, at turn 10, moving L to (4,5) from (5,5): is (4,5) free? Yes, as we said.\n\nSimilarly, turn 11, from (4,5) move D to (4,4): (4,4) should be free, no obstacle.\n\nTurn 12, from (4,4) move D to (4,3): free.\n\nTurn 13 to (4,2), turn 14 to (4,1).\n\nBut for output, since I only need up to turn 12, I can list actions.\n\nBut at turn 12, I am at (4,3), moving to (4,3) from (4,4)? Let's list the actions clearly.\n\nTurn 8: action D\n\nTurn 9: action L\n\nTurn 10: action L (to (4,5))\n\nThen for turn 11: from (4,5), direction L? After moving L to (4,5), head direction is L.\n\nThen move D to (4,4), which is down, not reverse? Current direction L, moving D down is not opposite, so allowed.\n\nSimilarly, turn 11: move D to (4,4)\n\nThen at (4,4), direction D.\n\nThen turn 12: move D to (4,3), which is down, same direction, allowed.\n\nThen turn 13: D to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut I only need to output up to turn 12 for now.\n\nIn the actions, for turn 10, I need to specify the move.\n\nBut is there any risk in this path?\n\nOne thing: at turn 13, when I move to (4,2), and tail is at (4,5), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n\nAlso, no other food or issues.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial forced moves.\n\nTurn 8: only D possible, so D.\n\nTurn 9: from (6,5), only L possible to (5,5), so L.\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,5), I have options, but L to (4,5) is good.\n\nI could move D to (5,4), but as we saw, not better.\n\nOr U to (5,6), but worse.\n\nSo I think L is fine.\n\nThen turn 11: D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: D to (4,3)\n\nBut after turn 12, I am at (4,3), and food at (4,1) still with life span decreasing, but plenty.\n\nNow, for the answer format, I need to output actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nAlso, since I have to think long-term, but with only one food, it should be ok.\n\nBut after eating, I need to survive, but that's beyond the immediate plan.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there are other foods, but currently only this one.\n\nEarlier foods expired.\n\nBut new food might spawn, but I don't know, so based on current state.\n\nSo for now, this plan seems good.\n\nNow, about the Tail Reward Danger: in the rules, it says if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, when I eat (4,1), the tail is at (4,5), which is not adjacent; adjacent would be one step away, like (4,4) or (3,1) etc., but (4,5) is 4 steps away in y, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, during the path, no such situation.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nTurn 10: L (to (4,5))\n\nIn the move, I need to specify the direction.\n\nFor turn 10, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5), so action L.\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,5) move down to (4,4), so D.\n\nTurn 12: from (4,4) move down to (4,3), so D.\n\nBut turn 12 is t1+4? t1=8, t1+4=12.\n\nt1 to t1+4 is 5 turns: 8,9,10,11,12.\n\nYes.\n\nI could output more, but the min is 5 turns.\n\nIn the plan, turn 12 action is D to (4,3).\n\nNow, to write in boxed.\n\nBut let's make sure about the directions.\n\nAlso, in the output, it should be like \"Turn 8: D (down)\" etc., but in the format, it says \"action on turn\", and \"U (up), D (down), etc.\"\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t1: action\" where action is U, D, L, R.\n\nAnd it says \"action \\in {U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right)}\"\n\nSo I can write D for down, etc.\n\nNow, for turn 10, I said L, but is there a reason to choose differently?\n\nSuppose at turn 10, I move D to (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,4), direction D.\n\nThen turn 11: I can move L to (4,4) or D to (5,3), etc.\n\nIf move L to (4,4), same as before.\n\nBut if I move D to (5,3), then I go to lower y, but to reach (4,1), I need to move left later.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), move L to (4,3), then down to (4,2), (4,1).\n\nBut from (5,4) to (5,3) down, then (5,3) to (4,3) left, then (4,3) to (4,2) down, (4,2) to (4,1) down, so eating on turn 14 same.\n\nBut at (5,3), I might be closer to other things, but no.\n\nMoreover, at (5,3), moving to (5,2), but (5,1) blocked, so from (5,2), I have to move left or right, not down.\n\nSo it might cause a detour.\n\nWhereas on x=4, I can go straight down.\n\nSo moving to (4,5) first is better.\n\nTherefore, I think turn 10 L is fine.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nBut for turn 12, it's D, moving to (4,3).\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 8):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (6,6), body at (5,6), (4,6), tail at (4,5). Snake length is 4.\n- **Head Direction**: Right (R).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 2 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 2 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (4,1): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 16).\n- **Walls**: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n- No instant reverse: From direction R, cannot move L next.\n- Deadly collisions: Walls or body segments (except tail under movement conditions).\n- Food life spans decrease each turn, including the current turn. (1,6) and (2,1) disappear after turn 9, so only (4,1) is available long-term.\n- Goal: Maximize score by eating (4,1) while ensuring survival. Path to (4,1) is prioritized.\n\n**Forced Moves (Turns 8-9):**\n- **Turn 8**: Only possible move is D (down) to (6,5) to avoid walls and body collision. U and R hit walls; L hits body.\n- **Turn 9**: Head at (6,5), direction D. Only possible move is L (left) to (5,5) to avoid walls (D to obstacle (6,4), R to wall (7,5)). U is invalid (reverse forbidden).\n\n**Strategic Planning (Turns 10-12+):**\n- **Long-term Target**: Eat (4,1) with life span 9 (7 after turn 9). Path: From (5,5) at turn 10, move L to (4,5), then D to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and (4,1) to eat on turn 14. This is safe and efficient (Manhattan distance 5 moves).\n- **Turn 10 Options**: From (5,5), direction L. Possible moves: U, D, L (R reverse forbidden). \n  - U to (5,6): Possible but wastes moves away from food.\n  - D to (5,4): Possible, but requires later left turn to avoid (5,1) obstacle, no time gain.\n  - L to (4,5): Directly toward food, optimal.\n- **Turns 11-12**: Continue down to (4,4) and (4,3). Path clear: No obstacles on x=4, y=5 to y=1.\n- **Risk Check**: \n  - No body collisions: Moves avoid body segments.\n  - Tail Reward Danger: Not triggered—tail not adjacent during (4,1) eat.\n  - Survival: After eating, snake can navigate away (e.g., left or right at (4,1)), but beyond 5-turn scope.\n\n**Planned Actions (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- Turn 8: D (down) – Only safe move.\n- Turn 9: L (left) – Only safe move.\n- Turn 10: L (left) – To (4,5), starting descent toward (4,1).\n- Turn 11: D (down) – To (4,4), continuing path.\n- Turn 12: D (down) – To (4,3), approaching food.\n- Turn 13: D (down) – To (4,2) (planned beyond minimum, for context).\n- Turn 14: D (down) – To (4,1), eat food (+1 score, length 5).\n\nThis plan maximizes score by securing (4,1) while avoiding all risks. Moves are validated for safety at each step.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: D (down)\nTurn 9: L (left)\nTurn 10: L (left)\nTurn 11: D (down)\nTurn 12: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 9. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,5), then body segments at (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). So the snake is moving downward since head direction is D, and positions show head at (6,5), which is below (6,6), so yes, downward.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 1 (disappears after this turn)\n\n- (4,1) with value 1, life span 8 (so it has 8 turns left, including this one)\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food here.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). So the snake is in the bottom-right area.\n\nFood: (1,6) near top-left, (2,1) near bottom-left, (4,1) also bottom-left but different.\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6, which is top row since y=7 is wall, y=6 is the row below top.\n\ny=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's clarify: walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo:\n\n- (1,6): x=1, y=6, so row 6 (which is second from top, since y=7 top, y=6 below it)\n\n- (2,1): x=2, y=1, so row 1 (second from bottom)\n\n- (4,1): x=4, y=1, also row 1\n\nLife spans: (1,6) and (2,1) have life span 1, meaning they disappear after turn 9. So if not eaten on turn 9, they're gone.\n\n(4,1) has life span 8, so it will be there for 8 more turns including turn 9.\n\nCurrent turn is 9, so:\n\n- Eating on turn t: food with life span N must be eaten on or before turn t + N - 1? Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's available on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone on turn t+L.\n\nCurrent turn is t=9.\n\n- Food at (1,6): L=1, so it is available only on turn 9. If not eaten on turn 9, gone after turn 9.\n\n- Similarly, (2,1): L=1, available only turn 9.\n\n- (4,1): L=8, so available from turn 9 to turn 16 (since 9+8-1=16, or turns 9 to 16 inclusive? Let's calculate.\n\nAfter N turns: if N=1, disappears after 1 turn, so present only on turn t, gone on turn t+1.\n\nFor L=1, available turn t, gone after turn t (i.e., not on turn t+1).\n\nFor L=8, available turns t to t+7, gone on turn t+8.\n\nt=9, L=8, so available turns 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16? From turn 9 to turn 9 + L - 1 = 9 + 8 - 1 = 16.\n\nYes, turns 9 to 16 inclusive.\n\nNow, snake head at (6,5), direction D (down). Since it's moving down, from (6,6) to (6,5), so next move cannot be U (up), because no instant reverse.\n\nPossible moves: from (6,5), can go U (up to (6,6)? But (6,6) is the body, but let's see collision rules.\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nTail segment is the last one, which is (4,6). Head is at (6,5), so adjacent cells.\n\nFirst, what are possible moves from (6,5):\n\n- U: (6,6) - but this is currently occupied by the body segment. Is it safe?\n\n(6,6) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is (4,6).\n\nIf snake moves U to (6,6), that cell has a body part, so it would collide unless it's the tail.\n\nBut (6,6) is not the tail; tail is (4,6). So moving to (6,6) would cause collision because the body segment is there and won't move away until the snake moves.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo after move, the segment that was at head position becomes new neck, and so on, tail moves to where the second last was.\n\nSpecifically: current positions: head (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) tail.\n\nIf snake moves to a new cell, say to (x,y), then new positions: head at (x,y), then body at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). So the tail (4,6) is left, and the cell (6,6) is now occupied by the second body segment.\n\nIf head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it will collide unless that body segment is the tail and it moves away.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to (6,6), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. After move, that segment would move to (6,5), but at the moment of move, the cell is occupied, so collision.\n\nRule: \"head touches any body segment\" at the time of move.\n\nSo moving to (6,6) would collide with the body segment there.\n\nSimilarly, moving to other cells.\n\nPossible directions from (6,5):\n\n- U: (6,6) - occupied by body, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n\n- D: (6,4) - but (6,4) is an internal obstacle! Walls include internal obstacles, so (6,4) is a wall, cannot move there.\n\n- L: (5,5) - is this free? Let's see what's at (5,5).\n\nCurrent positions: snake: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)\n\nFood: (1,6), (2,1), (4,1) — all different cells.\n\n(5,5): not a snake position, not a food position listed. Walls: borders and internal obstacles, (5,5) not listed as wall. x=0,7 y=0,7 are borders, internals: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,5) not among them, so should be free.\n\n- R: (7,5) - but x=7 is border wall, so cannot move right.\n\nx=7 is wall, so (7,5) is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,5):\n\n- U: to (6,6) — occupied by body, collision, invalid\n\n- D: to (6,4) — wall, invalid\n\n- L: to (5,5) — seems free\n\n- R: to (7,5) — wall, invalid\n\nOnly possible move is L to (5,5).\n\nBut is that right? Head direction is D, so cannot move U because instant reverse, but U is invalid anyway due to body.\n\nBut L is left, which is perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nOnly one choice? But let me confirm the grid.\n\nGrid:\n\n- x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n- Walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are borders.\n\nAdditionally, internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo for cell (5,5): x=5 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7, not in internal obstacles list, so yes, free.\n\nSnake positions: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) — so (5,5) not occupied.\n\nFood: (1,6), (2,1), (4,1) — not (5,5).\n\nSo moving L to (5,5) is possible and safe.\n\nBut on this turn, turn 9, there is food at (1,6) and (2,1) with life span 1, so they must be eaten now or lost.\n\nBut (1,6) is at (1,6), which is far away, snake is at (6,5), impossible to reach in one move.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) at (2,1), also far.\n\nSo cannot eat them this turn.\n\nTherefore, for turn 9, only possible action is L to (5,5).\n\nBut let's make sure about the direction. Head direction is D (down), moving L (left) is not reverse, so allowed.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5), new positions: head at (5,5), then body at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). Tail was (4,6), but after move, the segment that was at (5,6) is now the tail? Let's see:\n\nCurrent before move: positions [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) ] head to tail.\n\nMove head to (5,5): new head at (5,5), then the previous head (6,5) becomes first body segment, then (6,6) becomes second, then (5,6) becomes tail. The (4,6) is no longer part of snake, so it's free now.\n\nNew snake positions: [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ]\n\nHead at (5,5), direction: since moved left from (6,5), new head direction is L (left).\n\nNow, food: (1,6) and (2,1) disappear after this turn, since not eaten.\n\n(4,1) remains with life span now 7? After turn 9, life span decreases.\n\nFood life span: countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 9, food has life span L, after turn, if not eaten, L decreases by 1.\n\nFor (1,6) and (2,1), L=1 at turn 9, so after turn 9, L=0, disappeared.\n\nFor (4,1), L=8 at turn 9, after turn 9, it will have L=7 for turn 10.\n\nNow, turn 10: head at (5,5), direction L (left).\n\nPossible moves: from (5,5)\n\n- U: (5,6) - now, (5,6) is currently the tail segment? Let's see positions: [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ]\n\nSo (5,6) is the tail cell.\n\nIf head moves to (5,6), which is the tail, is it safe?\n\nRule: can move to tail cell because the tail will move away.\n\nAfter move, if head moves to (5,6), new positions: head at (5,6), then body at (5,5), (6,5), (6,6). The tail (5,6) was occupied, but since it moves, no collision.\n\nIn this case, moving to (5,6) is safe because it's the tail.\n\n- D: (5,4) - down, y=4. Is it free? Walls: y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so (5,4) not border. Internal obstacles: not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: no, food: no.\n\n- L: (4,5) - left, x=4,y=5. Free? Not border, not internal obstacle, not snake.\n\n- R: (6,5) - right to (6,5). But (6,5) is currently occupied by a body segment (first body segment). Is it tail? No, tail is (5,6), (6,5) is second last? Positions: index 0: head (5,5), 1: (6,5), 2: (6,6), 3: tail (5,6).\n\nSo (6,5) is body segment, not tail. If head moves to (6,5), it would collide because (6,5) is occupied and not tail.\n\nAlso, direction: head direction is L, moving R would be instant reverse, which is not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,5):\n\n- U: to (5,6) - which is tail, so safe.\n\n- D: to (5,4) - free, safe.\n\n- L: to (4,5) - free, safe.\n\n- R: to (6,5) - occupied by body, not tail, and reverse direction, invalid.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, or L.\n\nNow, need to think ahead to maximize score.\n\nFood available: only (4,1) left, with life span decreasing, but it has 7 turns left after turn 10? At turn 10, (4,1) has life span 7, since it started with 8 at turn 9, after turn 9 it decreased to 7 for turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: life span 7, meaning available until turn 16.\n\nBut we need to eat food to grow.\n\nThere might be other food later, but for now, only one food.\n\nAlso, the grid has obstacles, so need to navigate carefully.\n\nNow, position: head at (5,5), want to go to (4,1) which is at x=4,y=1.\n\n(4,1) is bottom-left area, since y=1 is row 1, near bottom.\n\nHead at (5,5), so need to move left and down.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's list the internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1) is an obstacle, and (4,1) is food, so (4,1) is not obstacle, but (5,1) is wall.\n\nSimilarly, other obstacles.\n\nNow, path to (4,1): from (5,5) to (4,1), need to go down and left.\n\nBut directly down from (5,5) to (5,4), (5,3), etc., but (5,1) is obstacle, so cannot go straight down at x=5.\n\nx=5,y=1 is obstacle, so at y=1, x=5 is blocked.\n\nTherefore, need to go left first or down and around.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L from (5,5).\n\nU to (5,6): that's up, but (4,1) is down, so going up might not be efficient.\n\nD to (5,4): down, towards bottom.\n\nL to (4,5): left, same row.\n\nSince (4,1) is left and down, L or D might be good.\n\nBut let's think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, need to avoid dead ends.\n\nCurrent snake positions: [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ] so it's a 2x2 square, but after move, it will change.\n\nFor turn 10, I need to choose action.\n\nNow, food (4,1) is at (4,1), and we need to reach it.\n\nBut also, there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving L to (4,5).\n\nThen new head at (4,5), direction L.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U (4,6), D (4,4), L (3,5), R (5,5) but R would be reverse, not allowed.\n\n(5,5) is now body, so R invalid.\n\nU to (4,6): what is there? Current positions, (4,6) is not occupied now? After previous move, positions are [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ], so (4,6) is free? No, (4,6) was tail but after move to (5,5), it was left, so (4,6) is empty.\n\nAt turn 10 start, positions [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ], so (4,6) is empty.\n\n(4,6) is not wall, not obstacle, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, D to (4,4), free.\n\nL to (3,5), free.\n\nR to (5,5) occupied and reverse.\n\nSo from (4,5), can go U, D, L.\n\nBut (4,1) is down, so D might be better.\n\nIf at turn 10, move D from (5,5) to (5,4).\n\nThen new head at (5,4), direction D.\n\nThen from (5,4), possible moves: U (5,5) - but that's previous position, body now, and reverse direction? Head direction D, moving U is reverse, not allowed.\n\nL (4,4), R (6,4), D (5,3)\n\n(6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\nD to (5,3), if free.\n\nL to (4,4), free.\n\nU invalid.\n\nSo possible: L or D.\n\n(5,3) might be free, but y=3, not border, not obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, if move U from (5,5) to (5,6), but (5,6) is tail, so safe, but going up away from (4,1).\n\nNot efficient for reaching food.\n\nSo probably better to go down or left.\n\nBut let's think about the area near (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is food, but (5,1) is obstacle, so to reach (4,1), we need to be at (4,2) or (3,1) or (4,0) but y=0 wall, so not (4,0).\n\ny=0 is bottom wall, so cells from y=1 to y=6, since y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so accessible y from 1 to 6? y=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable rows.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to x=6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nSo (4,1) is at bottom row, y=1.\n\nTo eat (4,1), snake head must move to (4,1) when it's free.\n\nNow, (5,1) is obstacle, so we cannot approach from above directly at x=5.\n\nPossible approaches: from left (3,1), from right but right is x=5 obstacle, or from above (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is above (4,1).\n\nNow, (4,2) might be accessible.\n\nAlso, there is obstacle at (2,4) and (1,2), but not near.\n\nBack to turn 10 choices.\n\nTo reach (4,1) from (5,5), a path could be: go left to (4,5), then down to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), then to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,5) to (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2) to (4,1).\n\n(4,4), (4,3), (4,2) should be free, no obstacles listed.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — so (4,2) not obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3), (4,4) free.\n\nBut (4,1) is food, so when we move to (4,1), we eat it.\n\nAnother path: go down to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then down to (4,3), etc., but from (5,4), if go left to (4,4), then similar.\n\nBut from (5,4), we can go down to (5,3), but then (5,2), but (5,1) is obstacle, so (5,2) to (5,1) invalid, so from (5,3) we have to go left or right, not down, to avoid dead end.\n\n(5,3) to (5,2) is possible, but then at (5,2), we cannot go down to (5,1) because wall, so must go left to (4,2) or right to (6,2), but right might be blocked by obstacles.\n\n(6,2) might be free, but then we are away from (4,1).\n\nSo better to go left early.\n\nSimilarly, going up first is inefficient.\n\nSo for turn 10, moving L to (4,5) or D to (5,4) both seem ok, but L to (4,5) might be better to start moving left.\n\nAfter moving to (4,5), head at (4,5), direction L.\n\nThen for turn 11, from (4,5), we can move D to (4,4) to go down.\n\nThen to (4,3), (4,2), (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) has life span, but plenty of time.\n\nNow, need to think about risks.\n\nAnother thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because collision.\n\nBut in this case, no food on tail currently.\n\nFood is at (4,1), not on snake.\n\nSo probably not an issue now.\n\nAlso, food under body, but not relevant yet.\n\nFor the path to (4,1), it seems straightforward.\n\nBut let's see the obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) to (4,4): is (4,4) free? Yes.\n\n(4,4) to (4,3): free.\n\n(4,3) to (4,2): free.\n\n(4,2) to (4,1): but (4,1) is food, so when moving to (4,1), we eat it, and snake grows.\n\nNow, after eating, snake length increases.\n\nBut need to make sure that after moving to (4,1), the new position doesn't cause collision.\n\nAlso, when at (4,2), head adjacent to tail? But tail might not be there.\n\nLet's simulate a few turns.\n\nFirst, turn 10: from (5,5), move L to (4,5).\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), tail (5,6) — wait, positions: [ (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (5,6) ]? Let's list properly.\n\nBefore move turn 10: positions [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ]\n\nMove head to (4,5): new head (4,5), then (5,5) becomes first body, (6,5) second, (6,6) third, and (5,6) is tail? No: the segments: previous head (5,5) becomes neck, then (6,5) becomes next, (6,6) becomes next, and (5,6) becomes tail.\n\nSo new positions: [ (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) ]? No:\n\nOrder: after move, head at new position, then the previous positions shifted.\n\nSpecifically: the body segments move to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo: new head at (4,5)\n\nThen the segment that was at index 1 (old body) moves to where head was, so (6,5) moves to (5,5)? No.\n\nStandard: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nIndices: let positions be P0 (head), P1, P2, P3 (tail).\n\nAfter move, new head at new position, then P0_new = new position\n\nP1_new = old P0\n\nP2_new = old P1\n\nP3_new = old P2\n\nOld P3 is left.\n\nIn this case, old: P0=(5,5), P1=(6,5), P2=(6,6), P3=(5,6)\n\nMove head to (4,5)\n\nNew: P0_new = (4,5)\n\nP1_new = old P0 = (5,5)\n\nP2_new = old P1 = (6,5)\n\nP3_new = old P2 = (6,6)\n\nOld P3 (5,6) is no longer part of snake.\n\nSo new positions: [ (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) ]\n\nHead at (4,5), direction L.\n\nNow turn 11: from (4,5), possible moves.\n\nHead direction L.\n\nCannot move R (right) because reverse.\n\nPossible: U (4,6), D (4,4), L (3,5)\n\n(4,6): is it free? Not wall, not obstacle. Snake positions: (4,5) head, (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), so (4,6) free? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) free, (3,5) free.\n\nTo go down towards food, move D to (4,4).\n\nThen new head (4,4), direction D (since moved down).\n\nNew positions: [ (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) ]? Let's compute.\n\nOld positions: [ (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) ]\n\nMove head to (4,4)\n\nNew: P0_new = (4,4)\n\nP1_new = old P0 = (4,5)\n\nP2_new = old P1 = (5,5)\n\nP3_new = old P2 = (6,5)\n\nOld P3 (6,6) left.\n\nSo [ (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) ]\n\nTurn 12: from (4,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U (4,5) - but (4,5) is body segment now, not tail. Tail is (6,5).\n\n(4,5) is first body segment, so moving U would collide.\n\nD (4,3) - down, should be free.\n\nL (3,4) - left.\n\nR (5,4) - but (5,4) may be free, but head direction D, moving R not reverse, perpendicular.\n\n(5,4): is it wall? Internal obstacle (6,4), but (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\nBut (5,4) is not occupied, so can move there.\n\nBut we want to go down to (4,3).\n\nNow, move D to (4,3).\n\nThen new positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\n[ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 13: from (4,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U (4,4) - body, invalid.\n\nD (4,2) - down, free? Yes.\n\nL (3,3) - left.\n\nR (5,3) - right.\n\nAll possible except U.\n\nMove D to (4,2).\n\nNew positions: [ (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ]? Old: [ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ]\n\nMove head to (4,2)\n\nNew: P0=(4,2), P1= old P0 = (4,3), P2= old P1 = (4,4), P3= old P2 = (4,5)\n\nOld P3 (5,5) left.\n\nSo [ (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ]\n\nTurn 14: from (4,2), direction D (since moved down).\n\nNow, food at (4,1), which is directly below.\n\nMove D to (4,1).\n\nNow, (4,1) is food, so we eat it.\n\nBut check if safe.\n\n(4,1) is free, not occupied.\n\nAfter move, head moves to (4,1), eats food, so snake grows.\n\nWhen eating food, the tail does not move, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo new positions: head at (4,1), then the previous positions, but tail stays.\n\nAfter move without eating: head to new, body follows, tail leaves.\n\nBut when eating, head moves to food, body follows, but tail does not move, so new segment added at tail.\n\nSpecifically: after moving to food cell, the snake grows, so the tail remains, and a new segment is added where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move, it stays.\n\nStandard: when eat food, head moves to food cell, the body segments move as usual, but the tail does not move, so the snake length increases by one, with the tail in place.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, positions P0 to P3.\n\nMove head to food cell, say F.\n\nThen new head at F.\n\nThen P1_new = old P0\n\nP2_new = old P1\n\nP3_new = old P2\n\nAnd since eating, a new segment is added at old P3, so the tail is now at old P3, and new segment is there.\n\nSo positions become [ F, old P0, old P1, old P2, old P3 ]\n\nIn this case, turn 14: before move, positions [ (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ] P0=(4,2), P1=(4,3), P2=(4,4), P3=(4,5)\n\nMove head to (4,1), which is food.\n\nEat food, so grow.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,1), then old P0 (4,2), old P1 (4,3), old P2 (4,4), and new tail at old P3 (4,5).\n\nSo [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ]\n\nAll good, no collision.\n\nAnd we scored +1.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nIn this sequence, we ate the food on turn 14.\n\nBut turn 14 is t1 + 5? t1=9, turn 14 is t1+5.\n\nt1=9, turn 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nSo 5 turns from now.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 10 we moved L, then D on 11, D on 12, D on 13, D on 14 to eat.\n\nBut on turn 10, we are at (5,5), and we moved L to (4,5).\n\nBut we could have moved D first.\n\nFor example, turn 10: from (5,5) move D to (5,4)\n\nThen positions: [ (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) ]? Old [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ]\n\nMove to (5,4): new head (5,4), P1= old P0=(5,5), P2= old P1=(6,5), P3= old P2=(6,6)\n\nSo [ (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) ]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 11: from (5,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U (5,5) - body, invalid.\n\nL (4,4) - free.\n\nR (6,4) - but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nD (5,3) - down, free.\n\nSo can move L to (4,4) or D to (5,3).\n\nIf move L to (4,4), then similar to before.\n\nThen from (4,4), we can go down to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut if move D to (5,3), then at (5,3), then we have to move left or something, but (5,2) below, then (5,1) wall, so must move left from (5,3) or (5,2).\n\nFor example, turn 11: move D to (5,3)\n\nNew positions: [ (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5) ]? Old [ (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) ]\n\nMove to (5,3): new [ (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5) ]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 12: from (5,3), direction D.\n\nPossible: U (5,4) - body, invalid.\n\nD (5,2) - down, free? (5,2) should be free.\n\nL (4,3) - left.\n\nR (6,3) - right, but (6,3) might be free, but obstacles (6,4) is wall, but (6,3) different.\n\n(6,3) not wall.\n\nBut if go D to (5,2), then at (5,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 13: from (5,2), U (5,3) body, invalid; D (5,1) wall, invalid; so only L or R.\n\nL to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n\nThen if L to (4,2), then to (4,1) on next turn.\n\nBut from (4,2) to (4,1) on turn 14.\n\nSame as before, but we went down first, then left later.\n\nIn the first path, we went left then down, eating on turn 14.\n\nIn this, if we go down then left, we might reach (4,1) later or same.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) on turn 12, if move L to (4,3), then D to (4,2) turn 13, D to (4,1) turn 14.\n\nSame turn.\n\nBut if we go to (5,3) on turn 11, then to (4,3) on turn 12, to (4,2) turn 13, to (4,1) turn 14.\n\nStill turn 14.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we were at (4,5) on turn 11, then to (4,4) turn 12, (4,3) turn 13, (4,2) turn 14, then to (4,1) would be turn 15? Let's correct.\n\nEarlier:\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,5)  // at (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move D to (4,4)  // at (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: move D to (4,3)  // at (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: move D to (4,2)  // at (4,2)\n\nTurn 14: move D to (4,1) and eat // at (4,1)\n\nSo ate on turn 14.\n\nIf from (5,5) turn 10 move D to (5,4), then turn 11 move L to (4,4), turn 12 move D to (4,3), turn 13 move D to (4,2), turn 14 move D to (4,1) eat. Same.\n\nIf turn 11 from (5,4) move D to (5,3), then turn 12 move L to (4,3), turn 13 move D to (4,2), turn 14 move D to (4,1) eat. Still turn 14.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut in the first choice, moving L or D from (5,5) both can lead to eating on turn 14.\n\nNow, is there a risk in going down first?\n\nFor example, if we go to (5,4), then (5,3), then at (5,3), if we go down to (5,2), then at (5,2), we are stuck with only left and right, since down to (5,1) wall.\n\nBut we can go left to (4,2) then to (4,1).\n\nBut if for some reason we go right, it might be worse.\n\nBut in planning, we go left.\n\nSimilarly, no big issue.\n\nBut perhaps moving left first is slightly better because it gets us closer to the left side where the food is.\n\n(4,1) is at x=4, and we were at x=5.\n\nAlso, in terms of the grid, there might be other considerations.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, the snake is longer, and we need to survive.\n\nBut for now, we need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from t1=9.\n\nTurn 9: we must move L to (5,5), as only choice.\n\nThen turn 10: we can choose, say L to (4,5) or D to (5,4).\n\nSince we need to think 5+ turns ahead, and prioritize survival.\n\nAfter eating (4,1), the snake is at [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ] all in a column.\n\nThen we need to move somewhere.\n\nBut that might be later.\n\nFor now, since no other food, we should go for this food.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,6) and (2,1) are gone, so only one food.\n\nPerhaps we can think if there is a better path, but seems fine.\n\nAnother risk: when at (4,2) on turn 14 before moving to (4,1), if the tail is far, but in this case, tail is at (4,5), head at (4,2), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n\nWhen moving to (4,1), it's fine.\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nTurn 9: only possible action is L (left) to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,5), I can move L to (4,5) or D to (5,4) or U to (5,6), but U is up, away from food, inefficient, so better L or D.\n\nSay, I choose L to (4,5) to start moving left.\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,5), move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: from (4,4), move D to (4,3)\n\nBut earlier I said from (4,4) direction D, can move D to (4,3)\n\nIn turn 12 position: after turn 11, head at (4,4), direction D.\n\nThen turn 12: move D to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 13: from (4,3), move D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 14: from (4,2), move D to (4,1) and eat.\n\nBut we need to output actions for several turns, but the food eating is on turn 14, which is t1+5.\n\nBut the answer format is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions.\n\nPerhaps we can output for as many turns as we plan.\n\nBut in this case, up to eating the food.\n\nSince after that, it might be different.\n\nBut for now, let's plan the actions.\n\nTurn 9: move L\n\nThen for turn 10, let's choose move L to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 11: move D to (4,4)\n\nNow, from (4,4), on turn 12, we move D to (4,3)\n\nBut when at (4,4), direction D, moving D to (4,3) is fine.\n\nThen from (4,3), move D to (4,2)\n\nThen from (4,2), move D to (4,1)\n\nBut on turn 14, we eat.\n\nNow, but we need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, for the reverse move constraint.\n\nIn this sequence, all moves are consistent with direction.\n\nTurn 9: head direction D, move L (left), so new direction L.\n\nTurn 10: head at (5,5)? After turn 9 move to (5,5), direction L.\n\nTurn 10: from (5,5) move L to (4,5), so moving left, direction still L? After move, new direction is the move direction.\n\nWhen we move, the new head direction is the direction we just moved.\n\nSo turn 9: moved L, so at turn 10 start, head direction L.\n\nThen move L to (4,5), so after, direction L.\n\nTurn 11: from (4,5), move D to (4,4), so after, direction D.\n\nTurn 12: from (4,4), direction D, move D to (4,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 13: from (4,3), direction D, move D to (4,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 14: from (4,2), direction D, move D to (4,1), direction D.\n\nAll good.\n\nAfter eating, snake is vertical at x=4, y=1 to y=5.\n\nThen we need to move, say left or right or up, but down is wall y=0, so cannot go down.\n\nBut that's for later.\n\nNow, for the answer, since we think ahead, we can list actions up to turn 14.\n\nBut turn 14 is eating, and we might stop there or continue.\n\nThe problem says \"maximize score\", so after eating, we should look for more food, but currently no other food, so we need to survive and wait for new food, but since not specified, perhaps we plan until we eat this food.\n\nTo be complete, let's list actions from turn 9 to turn 14.\n\nBut turn 14 is the eat turn.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 9 we move, turn 10 move, etc.\n\nThe answer format is for turns starting from t1.\n\nAlso, for turn 10, I have a choice, but I think moving left is fine.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial state, on turn 9, we have to move, and only L is possible.\n\nThen for turn 10, from (5,5), we can move U, D, L.\n\nMoving U to (5,6) is possible, but (5,6) is the tail? In turn 10 start, positions [ (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) ], so (5,6) is tail.\n\nIf move U to (5,6), which is tail, so safe.\n\nBut then we go up, to (5,6), then we are at y=6, which is top, and (4,1) is bottom, so it takes longer to go down.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), we might go left to (4,6), then down, but it might take more turns.\n\nWhereas going down or left directly is shorter.\n\nSo better not to go up.\n\nThus, for turn 10, move L or D.\n\nI think move L is reasonable.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nBut turn 13: from (4,3) to (4,2), then turn 14 to (4,1).\n\nIn terms of turns: turn 9 action: L\n\nAfter turn 9, at (5,5)\n\nTurn 10 action: move to (4,5), so L\n\nAfter, at (4,5)\n\nTurn 11 action: move to (4,4), D\n\nAt (4,4)\n\nTurn 12 action: move to (4,3), D\n\nAt (4,3)\n\nTurn 13 action: move to (4,2), D\n\nAt (4,2)\n\nTurn 14 action: move to (4,1), D\n\nNow, we can output this.\n\nBut is there any risk in this path?\n\nFor example, when moving down the column, the body is following, but since we are moving straight, no issue.\n\nAlso, no obstacles in the way.\n\nAnother point: on turn 12, at (4,4), moving to (4,3), etc.\n\nAll seems fine.\n\nPerhaps we can move down earlier, but same.\n\nSo I think this is a safe plan.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to box it.\n\nBut the food (4,1) is eaten on turn 14, which is fine.\n\nNow, after that, we should think what to do, but since no more food, and the state doesn't say new food spawns, but in general, food might spawn, but here not specified, so we can stop here.\n\nTo think 5+ turns, from turn 9 to turn 14 is 6 actions: turn 9 to 14 inclusive is 6 turns.\n\nt1=9, turns 9,10,11,12,13,14: that's 6 turns.\n\nBut the thinking is ahead, but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions for turn 9 to 14.\n\nBut turn 14 is included.\n\nPerhaps we can output fewer, but I think it's ok.\n\nSince after eating, we might need to move, but for now.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 9, we must move L, no choice.\n\nThen for turn 10, we could move D, but in that case, if move D to (5,4), then turn 11 move L to (4,4), then turn 12 move D to (4,3), turn 13 D to (4,2), turn 14 D to (4,1), same as above but turn 11 is L instead of D? Let's see.\n\nIf turn 10 move D to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 11: from (5,4) move L to (4,4)  // now at (4,4)\n\nThen turn 12: move D to (4,3)  // same as before turn 12\n\nThen turn 13: D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 14: D to (4,1)\n\nCompared to previous: in first, turn 11 at (4,4), here turn 11 at (4,4) same.\n\nIn first sequence: turn 10 move L to (4,5), turn 11 move D to (4,4)\n\nHere: turn 10 move D to (5,4), turn 11 move L to (4,4)\n\nThen both at (4,4) on turn 11? Turn 11 start positions different.\n\nIn first: after turn 10, at (4,5) for turn 11 start.\n\nIn second: after turn 10, at (5,4) for turn 11 start.\n\nThen turn 11 action: in first, move D to (4,4); in second, move L to (4,4).\n\nSo in both cases, on turn 11, we move to (4,4), so same position at end of turn 11.\n\nThen subsequent moves same.\n\nSo both sequences get to (4,4) on turn 11, then same to (4,1) on turn 14.\n\nTherefore, for turn 10, moving L or D both lead to the same point by turn 11.\n\nThus, either is fine. I can choose L.\n\nNow for the answer, I think we can list the actions.\n\nSo for turn 9: L\n\nTurn 10: L (to (4,5))\n\nThen turn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nBut turn 14 is eating.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and we have planned to turn 14, which is 5 turns ahead from turn 9? From turn 9, 5 turns ahead is turn 14? Turns: turn 9 is current, think ahead to turn 10,11,12,13,14, that's 5 future turns.\n\nYes.\n\nWe can output up to turn 14.\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 14, we might need to move, but not necessary.\n\nNow, in the action, for turn 13, we move to (4,2), then turn 14 to (4,1).\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 9):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (6,5), body segments at (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). Snake length is 4.\n- **Head Direction**: Down (D).\n- **Walls**: Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 1 (disappears after turn 9 if not eaten).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 1 (disappears after turn 9 if not eaten).\n  - (4,1): Value +1, life span 8 (available until turn 16).\n\n**Turn 9 Constraints and Decisions:**\n- Only possible move from (6,5) is Left (L) to (5,5), as:\n  - Up (U) to (6,6) causes body collision (not tail).\n  - Down (D) to (6,4) is a wall.\n  - Right (R) to (7,5) is a border wall.\n- Food at (1,6) and (2,1) cannot be reached in one move and will disappear after turn 9. Prioritize surviving and reaching (4,1) safely.\n- After moving L to (5,5), new snake positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)], head direction L.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (5+ Turns Ahead to Maximize Score):**\n- **Goal**: Eat the positive food at (4,1) safely by turn 14 (within its life span) while avoiding collisions and dead ends.\n- **Path to (4,1)**: \n  - From (5,5), move left to (4,5) on turn 10 to align with the food's x-coordinate.\n  - Then move down repeatedly: (4,5) → (4,4) → (4,3) → (4,2) → (4,1) on turns 11-14.\n- **Why this path?**\n  - Efficient: Minimizes turns to reach (4,1) by moving directly left then down.\n  - Safe: Avoids obstacles (e.g., (5,1) wall) and body collisions. The straight-down path has no adjacent risks.\n  - Low Risk: No \"tail reward danger\" (tail is never adjacent to head with food), and no dead ends.\n- **Post-Eating (Beyond Turn 14)**: After eating at (4,1), snake grows to length 5. New positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]. From here, prioritize moving left/right/up to open space (e.g., to (3,1) or (5,1) but (5,1) is wall, so left to (3,1) is safer) to await new food and avoid walls. However, since no new food is specified, the plan focuses on reaching and eating (4,1) by turn 14.\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n- Turn 9: Move L (only choice, avoids immediate death).\n- Turn 10: Move L to (4,5) (starts path to food; moving D also works but L is more direct).\n- Turn 11: Move D to (4,4) (continues down toward food).\n- Turn 12: Move D to (4,3) (safe down move).\n- Turn 13: Move D to (4,2) (positions for eating).\n- Turn 14: Move D to (4,1) to eat food (+1 score, length increases to 5).\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats (4,1) on turn 14 (within life span) with minimal risk. All moves adhere to movement constraints (no instant reverses) and avoid collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: L \\\\\nTurn 10: L \\\\\nTurn 11: D \\\\\nTurn 12: D \\\\\nTurn 13: D \\\\\nTurn 14: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 10, and I have to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I should sketch this to visualize.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,5), then body segments at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). So the snake is in a sort of square shape. Head direction is L, which is left, so it was moving left to (5,5) from (6,5)? Positions are given as list: index 0 is head, so head at (5,5), next segment at (6,5), which is to the right, but head direction is L, left? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLet's read carefully: snake positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]. Head is (5,5), and head direction is L, meaning it moved left to (5,5). Before that, it was at (6,5), since (6,5) is the first body segment. From (6,5) moving left to (5,5) makes sense. Then the next segment is (6,6), which is below (6,5), and then (5,6), which is left of (6,6). So the snake body: head at (5,5), then to (6,5) east, then to (6,6) south, then to (5,6) west. So it's like a small loop or something. Positions: (5,5) head, (6,5) to the right, (6,6) down, (5,6) left. So from head to tail: (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (6,6) -> (5,6). And head direction L, so it just moved left to (5,5).\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (2,1) with value 1 and life span 1\n\n- (4,1) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (4,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: (2,1) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn or next? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 10, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1 or something? I need to clarify.\n\nRule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo if at turn t, a food has life span L, then:\n\n- At turn t, countdown is L\n\n- After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n\n- ...\n\n- When countdown reaches 0, after that turn, it disappears.\n\nFor example, if L=1 at turn 10, countdown=1 at start of turn 10. After turn 10, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 10, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, if L=2 at turn 10, countdown=2, after turn 10 it becomes 1, can be eaten on turn 11, then after turn 11 it disappears.\n\nIn this case:\n\nFood (2,1): value 1, life span 1 at turn 10. So after turn 10, it disappears. Must be eaten on turn 10 to get it.\n\nBut turn 10 is the current turn, and I need to choose action for turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1): life span 7 at turn 10, so it will last until turn 16 (10+7-1=16? Let's calculate properly.\n\nAssume at turn t, life span N.\n\n- Turn t: countdown N\n\n- After turn t, countdown N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn t + N - 1, countdown 1 decreases to 0, food disappears.\n\nSo the food is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive.\n\nFor example, N=1: present only on turn t.\n\nN=2: present on turn t and t+1.\n\nGenerally, from turn t to t + N - 1.\n\nHere turn 10:\n\n- (2,1): life span 1, so present only on turn 10.\n\n- (4,1): life span 7, present from turn 10 to 10+7-1=16, so turns 10 to 16.\n\n- (4,2): life span 10, present from turn 10 to 10+10-1=19, turns 10 to 19.\n\nNow, (2,1) must be eaten now or never, but it's at (2,1), and I'm at (5,5), which is far. Can I reach it in one move? No, moves are one step per turn.\n\nCurrent head at (5,5), (2,1) is at x=2,y=1, which is left and down? (5,5) to (2,1): delta x = -3, delta y = -4, so multiple moves away. Since it's turn 10, and food disappears after this turn, I can't reach it in one move, so it's impossible to eat (2,1). So I should ignore it.\n\nNow, other foods: (4,1) and (4,2), both at x=4,y=1 and y=2. y=1 is row 1, y=2 is row 2.\n\nGrid: walls at borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0 and x=7, so cells from x=1 to 6 are free, similarly y=1 to 6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive, y from 1 to 6 inclusive? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nBut internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo let's list all blocked cells:\n\nBorder walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\nInternal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow snake occupies: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nHead at (5,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Head direction is L, so last move was left, so I cannot move right (opposite) on this turn.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, D, L (since left is not opposite to left? Current direction is L, so moving left is same direction, not opposite. Opposite would be R.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is the direction the head is facing, which is L.\n\nSo from (5,5), with direction L, I can move U, D, or L, but not R, because R is opposite to L.\n\nSimilarly, if I move, the direction will change accordingly.\n\nNow, let's see the grid state.\n\nI should make a grid representation for clarity.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls on borders.\n\nPlayable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nBut internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nAnd snake: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\nFood: (2,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n\n(2,1) is at x=2,y=1, which is playable, but it will disappear after this turn, so irrelevant.\n\n(4,1) at x=4,y=1\n\n(4,2) at x=4,y=2\n\nNow, y=1 is the bottom row? Assuming y=0 is bottom wall, y increases up? Or y=0 top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so if U increases y, that means y increases upwards, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Let's see.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1) — if y+1, and U is up, that means y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, I think. Standard in such grids.\n\nConfirm with walls: walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall. Similarly, x=0 left wall, x=7 right wall.\n\nSo cells: bottom row y=1, top y=6? y from 1 to 6 inclusive.\n\ny=1 is row 1, bottom; y=6 is row 6, top.\n\nSimilarly x=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nNow, obstacles:\n\n- (6,4): x=6,y=4\n\n- (5,1): x=5,y=1\n\n- (2,4): x=2,y=4\n\n- (6,1): x=6,y=1\n\n- (1,2): x=1,y=2\n\nSnake: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)\n\n(5,6) is tail.\n\nFood: (2,1) at x=2,y=1 — will disappear after turn 10, so not reachable.\n\n(4,1) at x=4,y=1\n\n(4,2) at x=4,y=2\n\ny=1 is bottom row, y=2 is above it.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for turn 10 and beyond. Since I have to think 5 turns ahead, I should consider sequences of moves.\n\nFirst, current position: head at (5,5), direction L.\n\nPossible actions for turn 10: since direction L, cannot move R, so can move U, D, or L.\n\nMove U: to (5,6)\n\nBut (5,6) is currently occupied by the tail! Snake positions: (5,5) head, (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) tail.\n\nSo (5,6) is the tail segment.\n\nNow, rule about moving to tail: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (5,6) is possible because when I move, the tail will move away, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to other body parts, it would be collision, but here only the tail is at (5,6).\n\nBody segments: (6,5) and (6,6) are body, not tail.\n\nList: index 0: (5,5) head, index 1: (6,5) body, index 2: (6,6) body, index 3: (5,6) tail.\n\nSo (5,6) is tail, moving there is ok.\n\n(6,5) and (6,6) are body, moving there would be collision.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,5):\n\n- U (up): to (5,5+1) = (5,6)\n\n(5,6) is tail, so safe to move, since tail moves.\n\n- D (down): to (5,5-1) = (5,4)\n\nIs (5,4) free? Let's see: walls? x=5,y=4, not border. Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but y=1, not y=4. (6,4) is obstacle, but x=6. So (5,4) should be free? Also, snake occupies (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), not (5,4). So (5,4) is empty, I think.\n\nBut there might be food or something, but no food at (5,4), so free cell.\n\n- L (left): to (5-1,5) = (4,5)\n\n(4,5): not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — none at (4,5). Snake not there. Food not there. So free.\n\n- R (right): but cannot, because opposite direction.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5)\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food to consider: (4,1) and (4,2) are both at x=4, y=1 and y=2.\n\n(4,1) has life span 7, so until turn 16, (4,2) until turn 19.\n\nBut I need to eat them safely.\n\nFirst, let's consider the moves for turn 10.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (5,6)\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), which is the current tail. After move, the snake moves: head to (5,6), then the body: the segment that was at (6,5) moves to where head was, (5,5)? Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo positions: before move: head (5,5), segment1 (6,5), segment2 (6,6), tail (5,6)\n\nAfter move head to (5,6): now head at (5,6), then segment1 moves to (5,5) (previous head), segment2 moves to (6,5) (previous segment1), tail moves to (6,6) (previous segment2).\n\nSo new positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,6)\n\nHead direction after move: since I moved U, direction becomes U.\n\nNow, at this point, if there was food at (5,6), but there isn't, so no food eaten, length same.\n\nNow, from here, I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse, so since direction U, cannot move D.\n\nBut (5,6) is at y=6, which is the top row? y=6, and U would be to (5,7), but y=7 is wall, so U is invalid, because wall.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,5), but (5,5) is now occupied by body? After move, positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,6)\n\nSo moving D to (5,5) would be collision with body.\n\nL to (4,6) or R to (6,6)\n\nR to (6,6): (6,6) is currently tail, but after move, tail will move, so it might be ok, but let's see.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (5,6) with direction U:\n\n- U: to (5,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- D: to (5,5) but (5,5) is body segment, collision.\n\n- L: to (4,6)\n\n- R: to (6,6)\n\nNow (6,6) is currently tail, so moving there is possible since tail moves.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) might be free.\n\nIs (4,6) free? x=4,y=6. Not wall, not obstacle (obstacles at (6,4), etc., not (4,6)), no food, so free.\n\n(6,6) is tail, so moving there is safe.\n\nBut after moving to (6,6), the tail was there, but it moves.\n\nIn this case, from (5,6), if I move R to (6,6), new head at (6,6), then body moves: segment1 to (5,6) previous head, but (5,6) was head, now body, segment2 to (5,5) previous segment1, tail to (6,5) previous segment2.\n\nPositions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), tail (6,5)\n\nNow, (6,6) is head, but before it was tail, but no issue.\n\nBut now, the snake is more compact.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (4,6), head to (4,6), body to (5,6), (5,5), tail to (6,5).\n\nBut from (5,6), moving U or D not possible, only L or R.\n\nBut R to (6,6) or L to (4,6).\n\nIf I go to (4,6), I can then move towards the food at (4,2) or (4,1), but y=6 to y=2, down.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; this is after one move.\n\nBack to turn 10 choices.\n\nOption 1 move U seems tricky because I get stuck at the top with limited moves.\n\nOption 2: Move D to (5,4) from (5,5)\n\nMove D to (5,4)\n\nNew positions: head to (5,4), then segment1 to (5,5), segment2 to (6,5), tail to (6,6)\n\nNew direction D.\n\n(5,4) is free? Earlier I thought yes, but is there obstacle? (6,4) is obstacle, but that's different cell. (5,4) should be free.\n\nFood? No.\n\nSo new snake: head (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,6)\n\nNow, from (5,4), direction D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R.\n\nD to (5,3): y=3, free?\n\nL to (4,4)\n\nR to (6,4)\n\nBut (6,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (6,4), so cannot move there.\n\nSo R to (6,4) invalid.\n\nD to (5,3): possible, y=3, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles at (5,1) but y=1, etc.), no, so free.\n\nL to (4,4): free, as before.\n\nSo from (5,4), can move D to (5,3), L to (4,4), or U but cannot, reverse.\n\nOption 3: Move L to (4,5) from (5,5)\n\nMove L to (4,5)\n\nNew positions: head to (4,5), segment1 to (5,5), segment2 to (6,5), tail to (6,6)\n\nNew direction L.\n\n(4,5) free, no food.\n\nSnake: head (4,5), body (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,6)\n\nFrom here, direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5)\n\nAll should be free cells, I think.\n\n(4,6) free, (4,4) free, (3,5) free.\n\nNow, food is at (4,1) and (4,2), so moving to (4,5) gets me closer to x=4 column.\n\ny=5 to y=1 or y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nSince (4,1) and (4,2) are both at x=4, I might be able to eat them.\n\nBut I need to check for Tail Reward Danger.\n\nTail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, food is at (4,1) and (4,2), not at tail yet.\n\nFirst, let's think about which move on turn 10 is best.\n\nMove U to (5,6): as I saw, it puts me at (5,6) with y=6, so I can only move L or R, but U and D not possible or dangerous. From there, I can go left or right.\n\nBut if I go left to (4,6), then I can go down from there.\n\nMove D to (5,4): then I can go down to (5,3) or left to (4,4), etc.\n\nMove L to (4,5): directly to x=4, then I can go down to (4,4), (4,3), etc. towards food.\n\nSince (2,1) is expiring, but I can't reach it, so ignore.\n\nNow, life span: (4,1) lasts until turn 16, (4,2) until turn 19, so I have time, but I should plan to eat them.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid obstacles and walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1) is at x=5,y=1, which is bottom row, and I have food at (4,1) and (4,2), so (5,1) is blocked, might affect path.\n\n(6,1) also blocked.\n\nNow, let's think about path to food.\n\nFrom current (5,5), moving L to (4,5) seems direct to x=4.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), then (4,3), then (4,2) or (4,1).\n\n(4,2) has longer life, but (4,1) might be eaten first.\n\nBut I need to check if moving to those cells is safe.\n\nFirst, for turn 10, I think moving L to (4,5) is good to start heading towards the food.\n\nThen from there, I can go down.\n\nBut let's think about the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nSuppose I go to (4,5), then (4,4), then (4,3).\n\nAt (4,3), I can move to (4,2) to eat food at (4,2).\n\nFood at (4,2), value +1, eat it, then snake grows, so after eating, new tail is added.\n\nWhen I eat food, the length increases, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length +1, so after moving head to food, the body doesn't move the tail, it stays, and new segment is added where tail was or something.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move, and the snake grows.\n\nBut in terms of positions, when head moves to food, it eats, then the body segments move, but the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the old tail position.\n\nLet's clarify the movement with eating.\n\nFrom rules: \"when eating positive food, length of snake +1\".\n\nAnd for movement: normally, when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail moves away.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, food is consumed, then the body moves as usual, but since length increases, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n\nIn terms of collision: after eating, the new segment is where the tail was, but since head moved to food, if food was not adjacent to tail, no immediate collision.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nIn this case, if I move to a food cell that is the current tail position, and head is adjacent to tail, then eating it causes collision.\n\nBut in this scenario, food is at (4,1) and (4,2), not at tail.\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,6), far away.\n\nSo probably not an issue yet.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nI need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 10.\n\nLet me denote the state.\n\nTurn 10: head at (5,5), direction L.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Move U to (5,6) - tail, safe.\n\nThen positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,6)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 11: from (5,6), cannot U (wall), cannot D (to (5,5) body), so only L to (4,6) or R to (6,6)\n\nIf L to (4,6): head to (4,6), body to (5,6), (5,5), tail to (6,5)  // since segment2 was (6,5)? Previous positions: after turn 10, head (5,6), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (6,5), tail (6,6)\n\nAfter move head to (4,6): new head (4,6), seg1 to (5,6) prev head, seg2 to (5,5) prev seg1, tail to (6,5) prev seg2? prev seg2 was (6,5), so tail to (6,5)\n\nNew positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (5,5), tail (6,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 12: from (4,6), direction L, can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (4,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (4,5) — (4,5) is now body? Positions: body has (5,6), (5,5), tail (6,5), so (4,5) is free? Yes, not occupied.\n\n(4,5) should be free.\n\nL to (3,6)\n\nR to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, collision, and cannot R because direction L, R is opposite, so invalid anyway.\n\nDirection L, so cannot move R.\n\nSo can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6)\n\nIf move D to (4,5): head to (4,5), body to (4,6), (5,6), tail to (5,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen I can go down to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I'm at (4,5), food at (4,2) and (4,1) below.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2) or (4,1).\n\nBut (4,4) and (4,3) should be free.\n\nObstacles: (2,4) but not here.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nBack to turn 10, move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 10: move D to (5,4)\n\nHead to (5,4), body to (5,5), (6,5), tail to (6,6)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 11: from (5,4), direction D, can move D, L, R, not U.\n\nD to (5,3)\n\nL to (4,4)\n\nR to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (5,3) or L to (4,4)\n\nIf D to (5,3): head to (5,3), body to (5,4), (5,5), tail to (6,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 12: from (5,3), can move D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3) but need to check if free.\n\n(5,2): y=2, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,2) not listed, so free? But (5,1) is obstacle, so (5,2) should be free unless snake.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) free, (6,3) free.\n\n(6,3) not obstacle, obstacles at (6,4), (6,1), but (6,3) ok.\n\nBut from (5,3), move D to (5,2), then (5,1) is obstacle, so cannot go below y=2 except to (5,1) but blocked.\n\n(5,1) is obstacle, so from (5,2), I can only go left/right or up, not down.\n\nBut food at (4,1) and (4,2), so from (5,2), I can go L to (4,2) to eat.\n\nBut let's not jump.\n\nTurn 10 move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,5)\n\nHead to (4,5), body to (5,5), (6,5), tail to (6,6)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 11: from (4,5), direction L, can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (4,6)\n\nD to (4,4)\n\nL to (3,5)\n\nAll free, as earlier.\n\nNow, to reach food, I can go D to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 12: from (4,4), after moving D, direction D, can move D to (4,3), or L to (3,4), or R to (5,4), not U.\n\n(4,3) free, (3,4) free, (5,4) free? (5,4) might be occupied later, but now free.\n\nTurn 13: from (4,3), can move to (4,2) to eat food at (4,2).\n\n(4,2) has food with life span 10, present until turn 19.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) below.\n\nBut (4,1) has obstacle at (5,1) adjacent, but (4,1) itself is free.\n\nNow, when I eat food at (4,2), I need to make sure it's safe.\n\nAt that point, where is the tail? It depends on the path.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns, let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, prioritize moving towards food at x=4.\n\nAlso, consider that after eating, the snake grows, so more body to avoid.\n\nBut currently length 4.\n\nNow, for turn 10, moving L to (4,5) seems efficient to get closer to food.\n\nThen from there, move D to (4,4) on turn 11.\n\nThen turn 12, move D to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 13, move D to (4,2) to eat food.\n\n(4,2) has food, so on turn 13, move to (4,2), eat it, snake grows to length 5.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (4,1) or other.\n\nBut (4,1) also has food, so I might eat both.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\n(4,1) is at bottom, and there is obstacle at (5,1) and (6,1), so (4,1) is accessible from left or above, but not from right.\n\nFrom (4,2), after eating, I can move D to (4,1) to eat that too, since both at same x.\n\nBut (4,1) has life span 7, present until turn 16, so on turn 13 or 14 I can eat it.\n\nTurn 13: eat (4,2), then head at (4,2), new positions: after eating, head at (4,2), body: the segments move to previous positions, but since ate, new segment added.\n\nBefore move to (4,2): suppose at turn 12, head at (4,3), positions: let's trace.\n\nStart from turn 10 move L to (4,5): positions head (4,5), body (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,6)\n\nTurn 11 move D to (4,4): head to (4,4), body: seg1 to (4,5) prev head, seg2 to (5,5) prev seg1, tail to (6,5) prev seg2? prev seg2 was (6,5), so tail to (6,5)\n\nNew: head (4,4), body (4,5), (5,5), tail (6,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 12 move D to (4,3): head to (4,3), body: seg1 to (4,4) prev head, seg2 to (4,5) prev seg1, tail to (5,5) prev seg2\n\nNew: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 13 move D to (4,2): head to (4,2), which has food, so eat it. Since positive food, length increases.\n\nAfter eating: head at (4,2), body segments move: seg1 to (4,3) prev head, seg2 to (4,4) prev seg1, seg3 to (4,5) prev seg2, and new segment added at previous tail position (5,5), so tail now at (5,5), but it's a new segment, so positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nLength 5.\n\nNow, from here, I can move to (4,1) to eat the other food.\n\n(4,1) has food, so move D to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is adjacent, move D.\n\nDirection was D, so moving D is fine.\n\nTurn 14: move D to (4,1), head to (4,1), which has food, eat it, so grow again.\n\nAfter move: head to (4,1), eat, body: seg1 to (4,2) prev head, seg2 to (4,3) prev seg1, seg3 to (4,4) prev seg2, seg4 to (4,5) prev seg3, and new segment at previous tail (5,5), so positions: head (4,1), body (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nLength 6.\n\nNow, after eating both, I am at (4,1), with body above, and tail at (5,5).\n\nNow, I need to move away. But (4,1) is corner, with walls below and left? y=1 bottom, so cannot go down. x=4, left to (3,1), right to (5,1) but (5,1) is obstacle, so cannot go right. So only left or up.\n\nUp to (4,2), but (4,2) is now body? Positions: body has (4,2), so moving up to (4,2) would be collision.\n\nSo from (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2) but body, collision; D to (4,0) wall, invalid; L to (3,1); R to (5,1) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only L to (3,1).\n\nMove to (3,1).\n\nThen from there, I can go up or left, etc.\n\nBut the point is, I ate two foods, so score +2.\n\nIs there any risk? When I ate (4,2) and (4,1), no Tail Reward Danger because tail was at (5,5), not adjacent.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), head at (4,2) or (4,1), not adjacent; adjacent means sharing side, so (4,2) and (5,5) not adjacent, different x and y.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, back to turn 10, if I choose this path, I can eat both foods by turn 14.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns? The answer should be a sequence of actions for the next turns, but how many? The problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many to output. Probably I need to output for the immediate turns, but since it says \"think ahead\", I might output a sequence.\n\nLooking at answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... } so I need to list actions for several turns.\n\nBut it doesn't say how many; perhaps I should do until a decision point or something. Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 turns.\n\nIn this case, from turn 10 to turn 14 is 5 turns: 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nTurn 10 to 14 is 5 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 10 action, then 11,12,13,14.\n\nIn my plan: turn 10: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: D to (4,2) eat\n\nTurn 14: D to (4,1) eat\n\nThen turn 15 I need to move, but not specified.\n\nSince after turn 14 I ate both, I can continue.\n\nBut for the output, I can output up to turn 14 or so.\n\nBut let's confirm if this is safe.\n\nOn turn 13, when I move to (4,2), it is free, no issue.\n\nSimilarly turn 14 to (4,1).\n\nNow, are there any obstacles? (5,1) is obstacle at x=5,y=1, but (4,1) is free.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles include (6,1), (5,1), but not (4,1).\n\nSo ok.\n\nNow, what about other options? For example, if I move U or D on turn 10, I might not reach food as quickly.\n\nFor instance, if I move U to (5,6), then I have to move left or right, and it takes more turns to get down to y=2.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (5,4), then I can go to (5,3), then to (5,2), then left to (4,2) to eat.\n\nBut from (5,2), move L to (4,2) to eat on turn 13 or so.\n\nBut (4,1) might be eaten later.\n\nBut in this case, I might eat only one or both.\n\nBut in the first plan, I eat both efficiently.\n\nMoreover, in the first plan, by moving directly left, I start heading down immediately.\n\nNow, another thing: Tail Reward Danger. But in this case, not applicable.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,1) is expiring, but I can't reach it, so no loss.\n\nNow, about the life span: (4,1) lasts until turn 16, (4,2) until 19, so I have time, but eating early is fine.\n\nIn my sequence, I eat (4,2) on turn 13, which is within life, and (4,1) on turn 14, within life.\n\nTurn 13 is t=13, food at (4,2) present from turn 10 to 19, yes.\n\nSimilarly (4,1) to turn 16.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to survive, but that's beyond.\n\nFor now, the sequence seems good.\n\nBut I need to consider if moving to (4,5) is possible without issue.\n\nOn turn 10, move L to (4,5).\n\nIs (4,5) safe? Yes, free cell.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut let's check the head direction: current direction L, moving L is allowed, not reverse.\n\nThen after, direction L.\n\nMove D on turn 11, which is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nNo problem.\n\nPerhaps I can consider if there is negative food, but all food positive here.\n\nAnother point: food can spawn under body, but here, foods are at (2,1), (4,1), (4,2), not under snake. Snake at (5,5) etc., not overlapping.\n\n(4,1) and (4,2) are free.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, for turn 10, action L.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as per plan.\n\nBut in the output, I need to list multiple turns.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and I have a plan for 5 turns, I can output up to turn 14 or 15.\n\nBut turn 10 to 14 is 5 actions: turns 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nActions: 10:L, 11:D, 12:D, 13:D, 14:D\n\nBut on turn 13 and 14, I eat food, but actions are just moves.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 14, I need to move away, but I can stop at turn 14.\n\nTo be complete, I can do until I eat both.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; it should be a sequence of actions for consecutive turns starting from t1.\n\nProbably I should output for as many as I decide, but at least a few.\n\nSince thinking 5 ahead, output 5 actions.\n\nTurn 10 to 14.\n\nIn turn 14 action, I move to (4,1) and eat, but the action is just the move.\n\nNow, but in the state, there is internal obstacle at (1,2), (2,4), etc., but in my path, I don't go there, so fine.\n\nAnother thing: when I move down to (4,3) on turn 12, is (4,3) free? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, all cells free.\n\nBut let's confirm the obstacles: internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is at x=2,y=4, but I am at x=4,y, so not affecting.\n\n(1,2) at x=1,y=2, but I am at (4,1) later, might go left to (3,1), but not now.\n\nSo for now, the plan seems safe and efficient.\n\nIf I choose other moves, it might take longer.\n\nFor example, move U on turn 10: to (5,6), then turn 11 move L to (4,6), turn 12 move D to (4,5), turn 13 move D to (4,4), turn 14 move D to (4,3), then I reach (4,3) on turn 14, whereas in first plan I am at (4,2) on turn 13, so slower.\n\nSimilarly, if move D on turn 10 to (5,4), turn 11 move D to (5,3), turn 12 move D to (5,2), turn 13 move L to (4,2) to eat, so eat on turn 13, but only one food, and (4,1) still there, need another move to eat it, but from (4,2) I can go down to (4,1) if possible, but at that point, body might be there.\n\nIn this path: turn 10 move D to (5,4)\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,6)\n\nTurn 11 move D to (5,3): head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), tail (6,5)\n\nTurn 12 move D to (5,2): head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), tail (5,5)  // tail to (5,5)? After move: head to (5,2), seg1 to (5,3) prev head, seg2 to (5,4) prev seg1, tail to (5,5) prev seg2\n\nNew: head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nNow, (4,2) is adjacent left, so turn 13 move L to (4,2) to eat.\n\nEat (4,2), so head to (4,2), eat, grow: body seg1 to (5,2) prev head, seg2 to (5,3) prev seg1, seg3 to (5,4) prev seg2, new segment at (5,5), so positions: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nNow, from here, to eat (4,1), I need to move D to (4,1), but (4,1) is below, and (4,2) is now head, so move D to (4,1).\n\nBut direction was L (since moved left to (4,2)), so moving D is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nMove D to (4,1), head to (4,1), eat, so grow again: body seg1 to (4,2) prev head, seg2 to (5,2) prev seg1, etc., and new segment at tail (5,5).\n\nBut now, from (4,1), similar situation as before, I can only move left to (3,1).\n\nBut in this case, I also ate both, but reached later: on turn 13 eat (4,2), turn 14 eat (4,1), same as first plan? In first plan, turn 13 eat (4,2), turn 14 eat (4,1).\n\nIn this alternative, same turn to eat, but in first plan, I started from left, so the body is aligned vertically, while in this, when I eat, the body is on the right, but no issue.\n\nBut in the first plan, by moving left immediately, I have a shorter path to the food column.\n\nIn terms of turns, both can achieve eating by turn 14, but in the move D path, on turn 12 I am at (5,2), which is closer to the obstacle at (5,1), but I don't go there.\n\nBut no significant difference.\n\nHowever, in the first plan, with move L on turn 10, I get to the food column faster and can start eating earlier if needed.\n\nBut since both work, I think move L is fine.\n\nNow, about the Tail Reward Danger: not an issue here.\n\nAlso, another food: (2,1) is expiring, but I can't reach, so no.\n\nTherefore, I think the sequence: turn 10: L, turn 11: D, turn 12: D, turn 13: D, turn 14: D\n\nIn the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nBut on turn 13 and 14, moving D to eat, but the action is just the direction.\n\nNow, for the answer, I should output from turn 10 to, say, turn 14 or 15.\n\nSince after turn 14, I need to move away, but I can output up to turn 14.\n\nTo be precise, let's list the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should include one more to show moving away.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nSince the problem says \"maximize score\", and I eat two foods, which is good.\n\nAre there other foods? Only these, and (2,1) gone.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, about the life span: (4,1) life span 7 at turn 10, so after turn 16 it disappears, I eat on turn 14, fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nBut on turn 13, move to (4,2) which has food, and turn 14 to (4,1) with food.\n\nAfter that, on turn 15, I need to move, say L to (3,1), but I don't need to output.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 12 move to (4,3), turn 13 to (4,2), etc.\n\nIn the answer, I think outputting 5 actions is sufficient.\n\nTo match the thinking, I can do from turn 10 to 14.\n\nNow, write in the boxed format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned 5 turns ahead (turns 10 to 14). The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (4,2) and (4,1) efficiently, as (2,1) expires after turn 10 and is unreachable.\n- Avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body.\n- Prioritize a path that minimizes risk and allows for future movement after eating.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 10)\n- **Snake**: Head at (5,5), direction left (L). Body segments at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). Length is 4.\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,1): Life span 1, expires after turn 10—unreachable and ignored.\n  - (4,1): Life span 7, present until turn 16. Value +1.\n  - (4,2): Life span 10, present until turn 19. Value +1.\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: \n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n- **Possible moves from (5,5) with direction L**: \n  - U (up) to (5,6): Current tail position—safe (tail moves away).\n  - D (down) to (5,4): Free cell.\n  - L (left) to (4,5): Free cell and moves directly toward food at x=4.\n  - R (right): Invalid (instant reverse not allowed).\n\nMoving L to (4,5) is optimal for turn 10 because:\n- It positions the snake closer to the food column (x=4) with a clear downward path to (4,1) and (4,2).\n- Alternative moves (U or D) delay reaching the food or risk dead ends (e.g., moving U leads to the top row with limited escape).\n\n### 5-Turn Plan (Turns 10–14)\nThe sequence below eats both foods by turn 14, scoring +2, and ensures survival:\n- **Turn 10: Move L** to (4,5). Head now at (4,5), direction L. Positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,6). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 11: Move D** to (4,4). Head now at (4,4), direction D. Positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (5,5), tail (6,5). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 12: Move D** to (4,3). Head now at (4,3), direction D. Positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 13: Move D** to (4,2). Head eats food at (4,2) (value +1, life span 10). Snake grows to length 5. Positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5). Direction D.\n- **Turn 14: Move D** to (4,1). Head eats food at (4,1) (value +1, life span 7). Snake grows to length 6. Positions: head (4,1), body (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5). Direction D.\n\n### Why this plan is safe and optimal\n- **No immediate risks**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions. Moving to (4,5) on turn 10 is safe and efficient.\n- **Food access**: Eating (4,2) on turn 13 and (4,1) on turn 14 is within their life spans (turn 10–19 for (4,2), turn 10–16 for (4,1)).\n- **Tail Reward Danger avoided**: The tail is never adjacent to the head when food is eaten (tail at (5,5) during both eats, not adjacent to (4,2) or (4,1)).\n- **Long-term survival**: After turn 14, the snake can move left (e.g., to (3,1)) to avoid being trapped at the bottom. The path keeps options open for future food collection.\n- **Efficiency**: This path eats both foods in the minimum turns (4 moves to reach (4,1) from start). Alternatives (e.g., moving U or D first) add unnecessary turns or risks.\n\nThis plan maximizes score by turn 14 and sets up for continued survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 11: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 12: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 13: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 14: D (down)\n}",

Positions: (4,5) head, (5,5), (6,5), and (6,6). That's four positions: head, then body segments. Let's list them: index 0: (4,5), index 1: (5,5), index 2: (6,5), index 3: (6,6). So the snake has four segments, meaning length 4.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n\nFood: two items. First: (4,1) with life span 7 and value 1, so positive food. Second: (4,2) with life span 9 and value 1, also positive food. Both are positive since value is 1.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the answer format shows actions starting from turn t1, which is 11, and then t1+1, etc. I should output for turn 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, etc., but since I need to think ahead, I'll plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I can't go to these cells.\n\nSnake: head at (4,5), body at (5,5), (6,5), tail at (6,6). Head direction left, so last move was left to (4,5) from, wait, previous position must have been (5,5), but (5,5) is now the first body segment. Let's see the positions: before moving left, head was at (5,5), and it moved left to (4,5), so the body segments follow.\n\nCurrent head at (4,5), direction L, so I can move U, D, L, or R, but with no instant reverse. Since direction is L, I cannot move R (right) on this turn because that would be opposite. So possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left). R is not allowed because it's instant reverse.\n\nNo instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to the current direction on the next turn. Current head direction is L, so for turn 11, I can move U, D, or L, but not R.\n\nNow, food: (4,1) and (4,2). Both at x=4, y=1 and y=2.\n\ny=1 and y=2, so below the current position? Head at (4,5), so y=5, food at y=1 and y=2, so south direction.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's list all blocked cells due to walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so:\n\n- x=0 for all y: (0,0) to (0,7)\n\n- x=7 for all y: (7,0) to (7,7)\n\n- y=0 for all x: (0,0) to (7,0)\n\n- y=7 for all x: (0,7) to (7,7)\n\nBut (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), (7,7) are corners, covered.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo blocked cells: walls and obstacles.\n\nNow, snake occupies: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(6,6) is the tail, and it might move.\n\nFor movement, when I move, the snake moves one step, so the head goes to a new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail moves away, so if I move to a cell that was occupied by the tail, it might be okay if the tail moves, but I need to be careful about collisions.\n\nCollision: if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves. But if I move into the current tail position, and the tail moves away, it should be fine, as long as no other body part is there.\n\nIn this case, snake positions: (4,5) head, (5,5) body1, (6,5) body2, (6,6) tail.\n\nIf I move the head to, say, (4,6), then new positions: head (4,6), body1 to old head (4,5), body2 to old body1 (5,5), tail to old body2 (6,5). Old tail (6,6) is now free.\n\nBut if I move head to a cell that is occupied by body1 or body2, that would be collision, but body1 is (5,5), body2 (6,5), head at (4,5), so adjacent cells are (3,5), (4,6), (4,4), (5,5) but (5,5) is occupied by body, so moving to (5,5) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is occupied, etc.\n\nAvailable moves from (4,5):\n\n- Left (L): to (3,5)\n\n- Up (U): to (4,6)\n\n- Down (D): to (4,4)\n\n- Right (R): to (5,5) but (5,5) is occupied by body, so collision, not possible. Also, instant reverse not allowed, but even if allowed, occupied.\n\nSince direction is L, R is instant reverse, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible actions: L to (3,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4)\n\nNow, check if these cells are free and not walls.\n\n(3,5): x=3, y=5. Walls: borders x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7. (3,5) is within, not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). None at (3,5), so free.\n\n(4,6): x=4,y=6. Not border, not in obstacles list, snake not there except head, but head moving away, so free.\n\n(4,4): similarly, should be free.\n\n(4,4): is it occupied? Snake positions: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6). No (4,4), so free. Obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (4,4) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) free.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can go L to (3,5), U to (4,6), or D to (4,4).\n\nNow, I need to think about food. Food at (4,1) and (4,2), both positive.\n\nBut (4,1) and (4,2) are far down, at y=1 and y=2, head at y=5, so I need to go down.\n\nBut there might be obstacles in the way.\n\nFirst, let's see the path to food.\n\nTo reach (4,1) or (4,2), I need to go to y=4, then y=3, etc., but I have to avoid obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (5,1) is an obstacle, (6,1) is obstacle, (1,2) is obstacle, but (4,1) and (4,2) are not obstacles.\n\nAlso, (2,4) and (6,4) are obstacles.\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, which is near the snake.\n\nCurrent snake: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(6,5) is body, and (6,6) tail.\n\nIf I move down to (4,4), that might be a step towards food.\n\nBut let's think long term.\n\nFood life span: (4,1) has life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn, so at turn 11, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 11+7-1? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span L, then after turn t, L decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning? The problem says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it is present during turn t, and at the end of turn t, if L>1, it decreases to L-1 for next turn, but when L=1, after turn t, it disappears, so not present for turn t+1.\n\nStandard way: countdown decreases at the end of the turn.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves to food cell during a turn, it is eaten at that turn.\n\nSo for food at (4,1) with life span 7 at turn 11, it will be present until turn 17? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 11: life span 7, present.\n\nAfter turn 11, countdown to 6.\n\nTurn 12: life span 6, present.\n\n...\n\nTurn 17: life span 1, present. After turn 17, it disappears, so not present on turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) life span 9 at turn 11, present until turn 19.\n\nTurn 11: LS=9\n\nAfter turn 11: LS=8\n\n...\n\nTurn 19: LS=1, present. Gone after turn 19.\n\nBut we are at turn 11, so both foods have plenty of time, LS 7 and 9, so I don't need to rush.\n\nBut I should plan to eat them.\n\nNow, there is a danger: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (6,6), and head is at (4,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,5) and (6,6) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, so not adjacent. Distance: |dx| + |dy| = |4-6| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3, so not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells would be like (5,5) which is body, not tail.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, to reach the food at (4,1) or (4,2), I need to go down.\n\nBut from (4,5), if I go down to (4,4), that seems direct.\n\nBut let's see what's at (4,4): not occupied, not wall.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,3), but (4,3) is free? Let's check obstacles: no obstacle at (4,3).\n\nThen (4,2) has food, so I could eat it.\n\n(4,2) is food, so if I move to (4,2), I eat it.\n\nBut I need to get there.\n\nAlso, (4,1) is below, but (5,1) is obstacle, so at (4,1), I can go down to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so (4,0) is invalid. y=0 is wall, so I cannot move to (4,0).\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is at the border, y=1, but y=0 is wall, so (4,1) is accessible, but I cannot move down from there.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells like (4,1) are on the row above y=0, so I can be at (4,1), but cannot move to (4,0).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, to go down from (4,5) to (4,4), then to (4,3), then to (4,2) for food.\n\nBut at (4,2), I can eat the food, which is positive, so length increases.\n\nBut let's think about the path and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), (1,2), (2,4), (6,4)\n\n(2,4) is at x=2,y=4, which is left of current position.\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4, which is near the snake body.\n\nAlso, (5,1) and (6,1) are at bottom, but I'm going to (4,2), which is not near them directly.\n\n(4,2) is at x=4,y=2, obstacles at (5,1) and (6,1), which are different cells.\n\n(5,1) is south-east of (4,2)? (4,2) to (5,1) is down-right, but not adjacent.\n\nSo (4,2) should be accessible.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is at y=1, with (5,1) to the right, but (5,1) is obstacle, so from (4,1), I can only move up, left, or right, but not down to y=0.\n\nx=4,y=1, possible moves: up to (4,2), left to (3,1), right to (5,1), but (5,1) is obstacle, so cannot go right. Down to (4,0) wall, cannot. So from (4,1), I can only go up or left.\n\nSimilarly, at (4,2), I can go up, down, left, right, but down to (4,1), right to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut (5,2) is free? No obstacles listed, so free.\n\nBut (5,1) is obstacle, so (5,2) should be free.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move for that turn, I think.\n\nWhen snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and since it eats, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nThen in next turns, tail moves normally unless another food is eaten.\n\nIn this case, both foods are positive, so eating them increases length.\n\nNow, current length is 4 segments.\n\nIf I eat one food, length becomes 5.\n\nThen eat another, 6, etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid colliding with body or walls.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut currently, tail at (6,6), head at (4,5), not adjacent.\n\nNow, let's simulate possible paths.\n\nOption 1: go down to (4,4) at turn 11.\n\nThen to (4,3) at turn 12.\n\nThen to (4,2) at turn 13, eat food at (4,2), life span 9, so still present.\n\nAt turn 13, move to (4,2), eat food, so snake grows: new head at (4,2), body: old head at (4,3), then (4,4), then (5,5), then (6,5), then (6,6)? Let's list positions.\n\nBefore turn 13: positions at turn 12 end.\n\nStart from turn 11.\n\nTurn 11: current state, head at (4,5), direction L.\n\nI choose action for turn 11.\n\nSuppose I choose D (down) to (4,4).\n\nThen after turn 11: head at (4,4), body: old head (4,5) becomes body1, then (5,5) body2, (6,5) body3, tail at (6,6)? Positions: after move, head to (4,4), so new positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)] and tail was at (6,6), but when head moves, the tail moves to the previous position of the last body segment.\n\nSnake movement: head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo positions: let S be the list of positions, S[0] head, S[1] to S[len-1] body.\n\nAfter move in direction, new head position = old head + move.\n\nThen new S[0] = new head\n\nnew S[1] = old S[0]  // previous head position\n\nnew S[2] = old S[1]\n\n...\n\nnew S[k] = old S[k-1] for k=1 to len-1\n\nThe tail is S[len-1], which moves to old S[len-2].\n\nIn this case, before turn 11, positions: S = [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)] so len=4.\n\nAfter move down to (4,4):\n\nnew head: (4,4)\n\nnew body1: old head (4,5)\n\nnew body2: old body1 (5,5)\n\nnew tail: old body2 (6,5)  // since S[3] new = old S[2] = (6,5)\n\nOld S[2] was (6,5), so new S[3] = old S[2] = (6,5)\n\nBut old tail was (6,6), which is now free.\n\nSo positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)]\n\nNow head at (4,4), direction down.\n\nFor turn 12, I can move from there.\n\nPossible moves: from (4,4), head direction D, so no instant reverse up, but U is opposite? Direction is D (down), so cannot move U (up) instantly.\n\nCurrent head direction after move is D, since I moved down.\n\nAt turn 11, before move, direction was L, I moved D, so after move, direction is D.\n\nFor turn 12, direction is D, so I cannot move U.\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,4), R to (5,4), D to (4,3)\n\nNow, (3,4): free? Not wall, not obstacle. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\n(5,4): (6,4) is obstacle, but (5,4) not listed, so free? But (5,5) is body, but not at (5,4).\n\nSnake positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)], so (5,4) not occupied.\n\n(4,3) free.\n\nAlso, (5,4) might be near obstacle, but not obstacle.\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, so (5,4) should be free.\n\nSo from (4,4), can go L to (3,4), R to (5,4), D to (4,3)\n\nNow, to reach food, I can go down to (4,3).\n\nTurn 12: move D to (4,3)\n\nThen positions: new head (4,3), body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), tail (6,5)? After move: head to (4,3), body1: (4,4), body2: (4,5), body3: (5,5), tail: old body3 (6,5) — positions: new S = [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nOld positions before move: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)]\n\nAfter move down: new head (4,3)\n\nnew S[1] = old S[0] = (4,4)\n\nnew S[2] = old S[1] = (4,5)\n\nnew S[3] = old S[2] = (5,5)\n\nAnd old S[3] (6,5) is free now.\n\nSo positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nHead at (4,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 13: from (4,3), I can move down to (4,2), where food is.\n\n(4,2) has food, positive.\n\nMove to (4,2), eat food.\n\nSince I eat, the tail does not move, so snake grows.\n\nNew head at (4,2), new body: old head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), and since eaten, add a new segment at the tail position, so tail stays, length increases.\n\nAfter eating: head moves to food cell, and the tail does not move, so the new tail is the old tail.\n\nPositions: before move, S = [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nMove head to (4,2), which has food.\n\nSo new head: (4,2)\n\nSince food eaten, the body segments move: new S[1] = old S[0] = (4,3)\n\nnew S[2] = old S[1] = (4,4)\n\nnew S[3] = old S[2] = (4,5)\n\nAnd because food eaten, add a new segment at the position of old tail, so new S[4] = old S[3] = (5,5)\n\nSo new positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nLength 5 now.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction D.\n\nNow, food at (4,2) is eaten, so removed.\n\nOther food at (4,1) still there.\n\nLife span of (4,1) was 7 at turn 11, now at turn 13, how many turns passed? From turn 11 to 13, two turns, so life span decreased by 2, so at turn 13, life span should be 7-2=5? Let's track.\n\nAt turn 11, food (4,1) life span 7.\n\nAfter turn 11, countdown to 6.\n\nTurn 12: life span 6.\n\nAfter turn 12, to 5.\n\nTurn 13: life span 5, still present.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) was eaten at turn 13, so gone.\n\nNow, from (4,2), I can move to eat (4,1), but (4,1) is below.\n\nMove down to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is at y=1, and y=0 is wall.\n\nFrom (4,2), head direction D, so I can move down to (4,1).\n\nTurn 14: move D to (4,1)\n\n(4,1) has food, positive, so eat it.\n\nNew head: (4,1)\n\nBody: new S[1] = old head (4,2)\n\nS[2] = old S[1] = (4,3)\n\nS[3] = old S[2] = (4,4)\n\nS[4] = old S[3] = (4,5)\n\nAnd since eaten, add new segment at old tail position, so S[5] = old S[4] = (5,5)\n\nOld positions before move: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nAfter move: new head (4,1)\n\nBody: S[1] = (4,2)\n\nS[2] = (4,3)\n\nS[3] = (4,4)\n\nS[4] = (4,5)\n\nAnd new segment S[5] = (5,5)\n\nSo positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nLength 6.\n\nHead at (4,1), direction D.\n\nNow, from (4,1), I cannot move down to (4,0) wall.\n\nPossible moves: left to (3,1), up to (4,2), right to (5,1) but (5,1) is obstacle, cannot.\n\n(4,2) is now occupied by body, since S[1] is (4,2), so moving up to (4,2) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, left to (3,1), or up to (4,2) not possible, right not possible, down not possible.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) should be free? Not wall, not obstacle listed. Obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), (1,2), etc., not (3,1).\n\nAlso, snake: (4,1) head, (4,2) body, etc., so (3,1) free.\n\nSo at turn 14, after eating, head at (4,1), I move left to (3,1).\n\nBut direction: head was moving down to (4,1), so direction D.\n\nAfter move left to (3,1), direction becomes L.\n\nBut at turn 14, after moving to (4,1) and eating, then for turn 15, I need to move from (4,1).\n\nIn the sequence, turn 14: I moved to (4,1) and ate food, so positions as above.\n\nThen for turn 15, head at (4,1), direction D (since last move was down).\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,1), U to (4,2) but (4,2) occupied by body, collision, cannot.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, cannot.\n\nR to (5,1) obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo only left to (3,1) is possible.\n\nMove to (3,1).\n\nThen new positions: head to (3,1), body: new S[1] = old head (4,1), S[2] = old S[1] = (4,2), S[3] = old S[2] = (4,3), S[4] = old S[3] = (4,4), S[5] = old S[4] = (4,5), tail moves to old S[5] = (5,5)? \n\nBefore move: S = [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nAfter move left to (3,1): new head (3,1)\n\nnew S[1] = old S[0] = (4,1)\n\nnew S[2] = old S[1] = (4,2)\n\nnew S[3] = old S[2] = (4,3)\n\nnew S[4] = old S[3] = (4,4)\n\nnew S[5] = old S[4] = (4,5)\n\nAnd old S[5] (5,5) is free now.\n\nSo positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nHead at (3,1), direction L.\n\nNow, I have eaten both foods, but I am at (3,1), which is near the bottom left, and there might be no food left, but currently no other food, so I need to survive.\n\nBut the snake is long, length 6, in a narrow space.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move: direction L, so possible moves: U, D, L, but not R.\n\n(3,1), y=1.\n\nMove left to (2,1), but (2,1) free? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,1) not listed.\n\nAlso, (1,2) is obstacle.\n\n(2,1) should be free.\n\nMove up to (3,2), or down to (3,0) but y=0 wall, cannot.\n\nDown to (3,0) invalid.\n\nSo possible: L to (2,1), U to (3,2)\n\n(3,2) free? Not obstacle.\n\nBut (1,2) obstacle, (3,2) not.\n\nNow, after this, I might be stuck, but I need to think if this is safe.\n\nIn this path, I ate both foods quickly, but now I am at (3,1) with a long snake going up to (4,5), which is at y=5.\n\nThe body is along the column x=4 from y=1 to y=5, and head at (3,1).\n\nIf I move left to (2,1), then positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), etc.\n\nThen I can move up or left, but (1,2) obstacle, so (2,2) might be free.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nEarlier at turn 15, I moved to (3,1).\n\nBut in this sequence, I used turns 11 to 15 to eat both foods and move to (3,1).\n\nBut I need to output actions from turn 11 onwards.\n\nIn this case, at turn 11, I moved down.\n\nBut is this the best? I might have other options.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger. In this case, when I was at (4,2) and moved to (4,1), tail was at (5,5), not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nBut now, after eating, the snake is long, and I might have limited space to move.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), if I go left to (2,1), then I can go up to (2,2), but (2,2) free? Obstacles: (1,2) at (1,2), so (2,2) should be free.\n\nThen to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut no food, so I need to explore or survive.\n\nBut perhaps there are risks with obstacles.\n\nAnother point: internal obstacles, like (2,4) at (2,4), which is above.\n\nBut in this path, I might be okay.\n\nBut let's think if going down directly is safe.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I go down, to (4,4), then (4,3), then to (4,2) eat, then to (4,1) eat, then only left to (3,1).\n\nAt (4,1), after eating, I have to move left, since only option.\n\nThen at (3,1), I can move left or up.\n\nBut the body is from (4,1) to (4,5), which is a vertical line at x=4, y=1 to 5.\n\nNow, if I move up from (3,1) to (3,2), then positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\n(4,2) is body, so if I go to (4,2), collision.\n\nFrom (3,1), if I move up to (3,2), then I can move right to (4,2) but occupied, or left to (2,2), or up to (3,3).\n\n(2,2) free? (1,2) obstacle, but (2,2) should be free.\n\nThen to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut I might get stuck if I go into a corner.\n\nFor example, at (3,1), if I move left to (2,1), then from (2,1), I can move up to (2,2), then to (2,3), but (2,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go to (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so at (2,3), I can move up to (2,4) but obstacle, cannot; left to (1,3), or right to (3,3), down to (2,2), etc.\n\n(1,3): x=1, y=3, not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, I can move around.\n\nBut since no food, I just need to survive, but the grid has obstacles, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nPerhaps going down directly is not the best because after eating both foods, I am at the bottom with a long snake, and movement is limited.\n\nMaybe I should go for one food or plan a different path.\n\nAnother option: from current position (4,5), instead of down, I could go left or up.\n\nFor example, go left to (3,5) at turn 11.\n\nThen from there, I can go down or left.\n\nBut food is at (4,1) and (4,2), so going left might be away from food.\n\nBut I have time, life span 7 and 9, so I can go around.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eating both is good, but I must survive.\n\nPerhaps I can eat the food at (4,2) first, then go for (4,1) later.\n\nBut in the direct path, I did that.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,1) has shorter life span, 7 vs 9 for (4,2), so I should eat (4,1) first if possible, to not lose it.\n\n(4,1) life span 7 at turn 11, so it disappears after turn 17, as I calculated earlier.\n\nTurn 11: LS=7, present turns 11 to 17? Turn 11: LS=7, after turn 11: LS=6, turn 12: LS=6, ..., turn 17: LS=1, present, after turn 17 gone, so not on turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) LS=9, present until turn 19.\n\nSo (4,1) must be eaten by turn 17.\n\n(4,2) by turn 19.\n\nSo I have time.\n\nAt turn 11, from (4,5), if I go down to (4,4), I can eat (4,1) at turn 14, as in my earlier plan, which is before turn 17, so fine.\n\nSimilarly for (4,2) at turn 13.\n\nBut in that plan, after eating both, I am at (3,1) with a long snake.\n\nNow, let's think 5+ turns ahead from turn 11.\n\nTurn 11: action\n\nTurn 12: action\n\nTurn 13: action\n\nTurn 14: action\n\nTurn 15: action\n\n Etc.\n\nIn my first plan:\n\nTurn 11: D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: D to (4,2) eat food\n\nTurn 14: D to (4,1) eat food\n\nTurn 15: L to (3,1)  // only move\n\nThen turn 16: from (3,1), I can move L to (2,1) or U to (3,2)\n\nIf I move U to (3,2), then positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — after turn 15, positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] as before.\n\nAfter turn 15 move to (3,1): positions [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nHead at (3,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nTurn 16: possible moves: U to (3,2), D to (3,0) invalid, L to (2,1), R to (4,1) but (4,1) occupied by body, collision, cannot.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf I move U to (3,2), then new positions: head (3,2), body1 (3,1), body2 (4,1), body3 (4,2), body4 (4,3), body5 (4,4), tail (4,5)? After move: new head (3,2), new S[1] = old S[0] = (3,1), S[2] = old S[1] = (4,1), S[3] = old S[2] = (4,2), S[4] = old S[3] = (4,3), S[5] = old S[4] = (4,4), S[6] = old S[5] = (4,5)\n\nLength 7.\n\nHead at (3,2), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen I can move U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nD to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nSo possible: U to (3,3), L to (2,2)\n\n(2,2) free? Not obstacle.\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut I might be able to go to other areas.\n\nHowever, there is an obstacle at (2,4), so if I go up, I need to avoid it.\n\nFor example, at (3,2), if I go U to (3,3), then to (3,4), but (2,4) is obstacle at (2,4), so (3,4) is free? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move to (3,5), but (3,5) might be free, but currently no food.\n\nBut the point is, I can survive.\n\nBut let's see if there is a better initial move.\n\nAnother option: from (4,5), I could go up to (4,6) at turn 11.\n\nWhy? To avoid going down immediately and have more space.\n\nFor example, turn 11: U to (4,6)\n\nThen positions: head (4,6), body: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,6)? Before: [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nAfter U: new head (4,6), S[1] = (4,5), S[2] = (5,5), S[3] = (6,5)\n\nOld tail (6,6) free.\n\nPositions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)]\n\nHead at (4,6), direction U.\n\nTurn 12: from (4,6), possible moves: L to (3,6), R to (5,6), D to (4,5) but (4,5) occupied by body, collision, cannot. U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, cannot.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nMove L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\nSay I go L to (3,6).\n\nThen positions: head (3,6), body: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen I can go down, left, etc.\n\nBut food is at bottom, so I need to go down eventually.\n\nBut with life span, I have time.\n\nFor (4,1), I need to eat by turn 17, so within 6 turns from now.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go down to (3,5), then to (3,4), but (2,4) obstacle, so to (3,4), then to (3,3), etc, down to (3,1), then to (4,1).\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (3,6) to (3,5) turn 13, to (3,4) turn 14, to (3,3) turn 15, to (3,2) turn 16, to (3,1) turn 17, then to (4,1) turn 18, but (4,1) disappears after turn 17, so on turn 18 not present, so I cannot eat it if I arrive on turn 18.\n\nTurn 17: (4,1) is present if life span >0 at start of turn.\n\nAt turn 17, if LS=1, present, can be eaten during turn 17.\n\nAfter turn 17, gone.\n\nSo to eat (4,1), I must move to it on or before turn 17.\n\nSimilarly for (4,2) by turn 19.\n\nIn this path, if I go to (3,6) on turn 12, then to (3,5) on turn 13, (3,4) turn 14, (3,3) turn 15, (3,2) turn 16, (3,1) turn 17, then on turn 17, I can move to (4,1) to eat it, since present.\n\nFrom (3,1) on turn 17, move to (4,1), eat.\n\nThen I can go for (4,2) later.\n\nBut (4,2) is at (4,2), which might be occupied or not.\n\nIn this case, at turn 17, from (3,1) to (4,1), eat.\n\nBut at that time, the snake body might be different.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other food.\n\nBut in the first plan, I ate both early, but got stuck in a corner.\n\nPerhaps I can eat only one and leave the other for later.\n\nBut (4,1) has shorter life, so I should eat it soon.\n\nAnother idea: from current position, I can go down but not directly, to have an escape route.\n\nFor example, at turn 11, instead of down, go left to (3,5).\n\nTurn 11: L to (3,5)\n\nThen positions: head (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,6)? Before: [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6)]\n\nAfter L: new head (3,5), S[1] = (4,5), S[2] = (5,5), S[3] = (6,5)\n\nOld tail (6,6) free.\n\nPositions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)]\n\nHead at (3,5), direction L.\n\nTurn 12: from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5) but (4,5) occupied, collision, cannot.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse? Direction is L, so R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo U, D, or L.\n\nNow, (3,4): free? But (2,4) is obstacle, (3,4) not, so free.\n\n(2,5): free? Not obstacle.\n\n(3,6) free.\n\nTo go down, I can go D to (3,4).\n\nTurn 12: D to (3,4)\n\nThen positions: head (3,4), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 13: from (3,4), possible moves: L to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nR to (4,4), U to (3,5) but (3,5) occupied, collision, cannot. D to (3,3)\n\nSo only D to (3,3) or U but U not possible, R to (4,4)\n\nR to (4,4) possible? (4,4) free, not occupied.\n\nSo moves: D to (3,3) or R to (4,4)\n\nSay I go R to (4,4) to get closer to food.\n\nTurn 13: R to (4,4)\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), body: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\n\nHead direction R.\n\nTurn 14: from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5) but (4,5) occupied, collision, cannot. D to (4,3), L to (3,4) occupied, cannot. R to (5,4)\n\nL is opposite? Direction R, so L not allowed instant reverse.\n\nSo possible: U not, D to (4,3), R to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) free? (6,4) obstacle, but (5,4) not, so free.\n\n(4,3) free.\n\nTo go to food, go D to (4,3).\n\nTurn 14: D to (4,3)\n\nThen positions: head (4,3), body: (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 15: from (4,3), moves: L to (3,3), R to (5,3), D to (4,2) food, U to (4,4) but (4,4) occupied, cannot.\n\nSo L, R, or D to (4,2).\n\nI can go D to (4,2) to eat food at (4,2).\n\nTurn 15: D to (4,2) eat.\n\nThen new positions: head (4,2), body: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5) and add tail segment, so S[4] = (3,5) or? Before move: S = [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)] len=4.\n\nAfter move to (4,2) eat: new head (4,2), new S[1] = old S[0] = (4,3), S[2] = old S[1] = (4,4), S[3] = old S[2] = (3,4), S[4] = old S[3] = (3,5)  // since eaten, tail stays.\n\nPositions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]\n\nLength 5.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction D.\n\nNow, I have eaten (4,2), but not (4,1) yet.\n\n(4,1) must be eaten by turn 17.\n\nCurrent turn 15, so I have turns 16 and 17 to eat it.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move down to (4,1) to eat.\n\nTurn 16: move D to (4,1) eat.\n\nThen new positions: head (4,1), body: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), and add segment at (3,5), so S[5] = (3,5)\n\nBefore move: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]\n\nAfter move to (4,1) eat: new head (4,1), S[1] = (4,2), S[2] = (4,3), S[3] = (4,4), S[4] = (3,4), S[5] = (3,5)  // tail added\n\nPositions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]\n\nHead at (4,1), direction D.\n\nTurn 17: from (4,1), only possible move is L to (3,1), as before.\n\nThen similar to first plan.\n\nBut in this case, I ate both foods later, but still end up at (4,1) with long snake.\n\nCompared to first plan, in first plan I ate both by turn 14, here by turn 16.\n\nBut in both cases, after eating, I am at bottom with limited moves.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat both immediately.\n\nBut I need to eat to score.\n\nAnother idea: maybe eat only the one with shorter life first, and leave the other for later when I have more space.\n\nBut (4,2) has longer life, so I can eat (4,1) first, then (4,2) later.\n\nBut to eat (4,1), I need to go down soon.\n\nFrom turn 11, go down to (4,4), then to (4,3), then to (4,2) but (4,2) has food, I can skip it and go to (4,1) first.\n\nAt (4,3), I can move to (4,2) or to other places.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), I can move left or right instead of down.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger or other risks.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but in this case, no food under body currently.\n\nThe snake body is at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), food at (4,1) and (4,2), not under body.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps the best is to go down and eat both, and then deal with the situation.\n\nBut to avoid getting stuck, in the first plan, when I am at (3,1) after turn 15, I can move up to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc., to the upper area.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), move U to (3,2), then U to (3,3), then to (3,4), but (2,4) obstacle, so to (3,4), then to (3,5), etc.\n\nAt (3,5), it might be free.\n\nThen I can have more space.\n\nAlso, there might be new food spawning, but the problem doesn't say food spawns; it only gives current food, so I think only these two foods are present, and no new food, so after eating them, no more food, so I just need to survive as long as possible.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating both is +2, and then survival.\n\nIn the direct down path, I can eat both by turn 14, then move to (3,1) at turn 15.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nFor example, turn 16: U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 18: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: L to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, cannot, so U to (3,5) or R to (4,4) but (4,4) may be occupied.\n\nAt turn 15: positions [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 16: move U to (3,2)\n\nPositions: head (3,2), body: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5)? After move: new head (3,2), S[1] = (3,1), S[2] = (4,1), S[3] = (4,2), S[4] = (4,3), S[5] = (4,4), S[6] = (4,5)\n\nHead at (3,2), direction U.\n\nTurn 17: move U to (3,3)\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 18: move U to (3,4)\n\n(3,4) free? Yes.\n\nPositions: head (3,4), body: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), tail (4,4)? After move: new head (3,4), S[1] = (3,3), S[2] = (3,2), S[3] = (3,1), S[4] = (4,1), S[5] = (4,2), S[6] = (4,3), S[7] = (4,4)\n\nOld tail (4,5) free.\n\nHead at (3,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 19: from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) occupied, collision, cannot. L to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, cannot. R to (4,4) but (4,4) occupied by S[7]? Positions: S[7] is (4,4), which is body, so moving to (4,4) collision.\n\nSo only U to (3,5) possible.\n\nMove to (3,5).\n\nThen positions: head (3,5), body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can continue moving up to (3,6), etc.\n\nSo I can survive.\n\nSimilarly, in the other paths.\n\nSo the direct down path seems fine, and I eat both foods quickly.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions for the first 5 turns.\n\nTurn 11: from (4,5), move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: from (4,4), move D to (4,3)  (since direction D, I moved D)\n\nIn turn 12, from (4,4), I could move L or R, but I chose D to go to food.\n\nTurn 13: from (4,3), move D to (4,2) eat\n\nTurn 14: from (4,2), move D to (4,1) eat\n\nTurn 15: from (4,1), move L to (3,1)\n\nThen for later turns, I can move U, etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for turn 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, etc.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output for multiple turns, I should output at least for 5 turns.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t1: action ...\" for several turns.\n\nAlso, for turn 11, moving down is valid.\n\nBut is there a risk I missed?\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (4,2) at turn 13, the food at (4,2) is there, I eat it.\n\nSimilarly for (4,1).\n\nNow, the internal obstacle at (5,1) and (6,1) are not in the way.\n\nAlso, (6,4) is obstacle, but not relevant.\n\nSo I think this is okay.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (4,1) first by a different path.\n\nBut this seems efficient.\n\nTo have more space, from (4,5), go left first, but that might take more turns to reach (4,1), and I risk not eating it in time if delayed.\n\nFor example, if I go left to (3,5) at turn 11, then to (3,4) at turn 12, then to (4,4) at turn 13, then to (4,3) at turn 14, then to (4,2) or (4,1).\n\nIf I go to (4,1) at turn 14: from (4,3) at turn 14, move to (4,2) or (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move to (4,2) at turn 14, eat, then to (4,1) at turn 15, eat.\n\nBut turn 15 is before turn 17, so (4,1) still present.\n\nBut in this case, I eat at turn 14 and 15, similar to first plan turn 13 and 14.\n\nIn first plan, turn 13 and 14.\n\nHere turn 14 and 15, but I ate (4,2) at turn 14, (4,1) at turn 15.\n\nBut in terms of turns, it's fine.\n\nBut in the first plan, I have an extra turn earlier.\n\nI think the direct down is better.\n\nMoreover, in the direct down, at turn 11 and 12, I move down, which is towards food.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 11: D (down)\n\nTurn 12: D (down) to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: D (down) to (4,2) eat\n\nTurn 14: D (down) to (4,1) eat\n\nTurn 15: L (left) to (3,1)\n\nThen for later, I can add, but the answer might need only a few turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output for 5 turns.\n\nThe format shows multiple turns.\n\nAlso, in the box.\n\nSo for now, I'll output turns 11 to 15.\n\nBut turn 11 action is for the current turn.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 11: D, turn 12: D, turn 13: D, turn 14: D, turn 15: L\n\nBut at turn 13, when I move to (4,2), I eat, but the direction is set.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive food items while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Food Priorities**: Both food items are positive (+1 each) and must be eaten before they disappear. (4,1) has a life span of 7 at turn 11, so it disappears after turn 17 (present for turns 11-17). (4,2) has a life span of 9, disappearing after turn 19 (present for turns 11-19). Thus, (4,1) should be eaten first to avoid loss.\n- **Path Safety**: The direct downward path to (4,1) is efficient and avoids obstacles. Moving down immediately allows eating (4,1) by turn 14 and (4,2) by turn 15, well within their life spans.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - No instant reverse is allowed (current head direction is L, so R is forbidden on turn 11).\n  - After eating, the snake grows, so movement must avoid body collisions. The path after eating both foods moves left to (3,1) to escape the bottom row and provide maneuvering space.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating, moving up from (3,1) allows exploration of the grid (e.g., to (3,2), (3,3), etc.), avoiding dead-ends caused by obstacles like (2,4). This ensures survival beyond the 5-turn horizon.\n- **Risks Mitigated**: \n  - Tail reward danger is irrelevant here, as the tail is never adjacent to the head during eating.\n  - Obstacles like (5,1), (6,1), and (2,4) are avoided in this path.\n  - Wall collisions are prevented by not moving to borders.\n\n### Planned Move Sequence (Turns 11-15)\n- **Turn 11**: Move **D (down)** to (4,4). This starts the descent toward (4,1), is safe (cell free), and avoids instant reverse.\n- **Turn 12**: Move **D (down)** to (4,3). Continues toward (4,1), with (4,3) free.\n- **Turn 13**: Move **D (down)** to (4,2). Eats the food at (4,2) (value +1, life span 9), increasing length to 5. The snake grows, so the tail remains at (5,5).\n- **Turn 14**: Move **D (down)** to (4,1). Eats the food at (4,1) (value +1, life span 7), increasing length to 6. Only move left is possible afterward to avoid walls/body.\n- **Turn 15**: Move **L (left)** to (3,1). Escapes the bottom row; (3,1) is free, providing access to open areas for future movement.\n\n### Beyond Turn 15\nFor long-term survival (turns 16+):\n- Move up to (3,2) on turn 16, then to (3,3) on turn 17, etc., to navigate toward the upper grid. This path avoids obstacles and body collisions, with options to turn left/right as needed. By turn 17, both foods are eaten (score +2), and the snake is positioned to survive indefinitely in the open left area.\n\nThis sequence prioritizes eating both foods quickly while ensuring no risk of starvation or collision in the near term. Total score increases by 2, and survival is maintained.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 12: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 13: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 14: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 15: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 12, and I have to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8? Coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. Walls are at the borders, meaning I can't move to those cells. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So those cells are blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,4), then body at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head is at (4,4) and direction is down (D). Since it's moving down, the previous move was down, so from (4,5) to (4,4) I assume? Positions are given as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first, so head is (4,4), then next segment is (4,5), which is directly above it? Let's see: (4,4) is head, (4,5) is above, since y=5 is higher y, so moving down would be decreasing y.\n\nIn standard coordinates, often y increases upwards, but in grids, sometimes y increases downwards. Let's clarify.\n\nThe movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so U increases y, D decreases y. So in this case, head at (4,4), and segment at (4,5), which is above (y=5 > y=4), so since head is at (4,4) and moving down to (4,4) from (4,5)? Positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)].\n\nIf head is at (4,4) and it's moving down, meaning from previous position, it was at (4,5) and moved down to (4,4). So the direction is the direction it moved to get to current head position. Head direction is given as D, which is down, so it moved down to (4,4).\n\nNow, the body: (4,5) is the neck, then (5,5), then tail at (6,5).\n\nFood positions: two items.\n\nFirst food: (4,1) with life span 6 and value 1. Value 1 is positive food, since +1.\n\nSecond food: (4,2) with life span 8 and value 1. Also positive.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 12, food at (4,1) has life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 17? Let's see: life span N means it disappears after N turns from now? The description says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone by turn t + L - 1? Or turn t + L?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it lasts for N more turns, including the current one. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n\nThe description: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, life span L means it has L turns left, including turn t. So after L turns, it will be gone. For example, if L=1 at turn t, it will be eaten or disappear at turn t, and not present at turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, here at turn 12, food at (4,1) has life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 17 (since 12 + 6 - 1 = 17? Let's calculate.\n\nIf countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn 12, life span 6: after turn 12, countdown becomes 5, so it has 5 more turns? I'm confusing myself.\n\nAssume: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, then during turn t, it is present, and after turn t, life span decreases to L-1. If L-1 >0, it remains, else disappears.\n\nSo at turn 12, life span 6 means it will be present for turns 12,13,14,15,16,17? 6 turns including turn 12.\n\nTurn 12: L=6, after turn 12, L becomes 5.\n\nTurn 13: L=5, after turn 13, L=4.\n\n...\n\nTurn 17: L=1, after turn 17, L=0, disappears, so not present at turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,2) life span 8, so present until turn 19 (12+8-1=19? 12 to 19 is 8 turns? Turn 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 — that's 8 turns.\n\nTurn 12: present, L=8\n\nAfter turn 12: L=7\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 18: L=1\n\nTurn 19: present, L=1, after turn 19, L=0, gone.\n\nSo both foods have plenty of life left.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for turn 12 and beyond. Since the snake is moving down, and head is at (4,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but cannot instant reverse. Since current direction is D, reverse is U, so I cannot go U immediately. So allowed moves: D, L, R. Down, left, right.\n\nNow, let's see the grid.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So grid from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Usually in programming, (0,0) is top-left, y increasing down, but in this movement, U is (x,y+1), which might be y increasing up or down.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1) — if y+1, and U is up, that implies y=0 is top, y increases down? But let's see the positions.\n\nSnake head at (4,4), body at (4,5). If U is (x,y+1), and head at (4,4), U would be to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by the body, so it would be collision, but it's the neck, so after move, the tail moves, so it might be ok, but generally, moving to neck is not collision because the tail moves.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, head at (4,4), tail at (6,5). If I move to a body segment, it might be collision unless it's the tail and tail moves.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides. If it moves to the tail cell, and tail moves, no collision.\n\nHere, body segments: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). (4,5) is the first body segment, which is the neck.\n\nIf I move up to (4,5), that's where the neck is, but after move, the neck moves to where head was or something? Let's think about movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front. So if head moves to a new cell, say to (x,y), then the segment that was at (x,y) becomes new head position? No.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail stays, new segment added.\n\nBut in terms of positions: after move, the new head position is the move direction, and the body follows.\n\nFor example, current positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5).\n\nIf I move down, to (4,3), then new positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail (6,5) is gone, since no food.\n\nIf I eat food, then tail doesn't move, so positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) — length increases.\n\nBut for collision, when moving, if the new head position is occupied by a body segment, it collides, except if it is the current tail position and no food is eaten, then it's ok because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,5), which is currently occupied by the neck segment.\n\nAfter move, if I move to (4,5), head was (4,4), moving to (4,5). But (4,5) is occupied, so collision? But the segment at (4,5) will move to the previous head position (4,4) only if no food eaten. But when head moves to (4,5), it's trying to occupy the same cell as the neck, which is a body segment, so it should collide immediately.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a cell occupied by a non-tail body segment causes collision. Moving to tail cell is ok if tail moves.\n\nHere, (4,5) is not the tail; tail is at (6,5). So (4,5) is a body segment, so moving to (4,5) would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is also body, not tail.\n\nOnly (6,5) is tail.\n\nSo for head at (4,4), possible moves:\n\n- Down (D): to (4,3)\n\n- Left (L): to (3,4)\n\n- Right (R): to (5,4)\n\nUp (U) to (4,5) is invalid because (4,5) is occupied and not tail, and also instant reverse is not allowed since current direction is D, U is opposite.\n\nInstant reverse not allowed: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction D, so cannot go U.\n\nSo possible: D, L, R.\n\nNow, check for walls or obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nFor (4,3): is it wall? x=4, y=3, not border, not in internal obstacles, so ok.\n\n(3,4): x=3,y=4, not border, not in obstacles, ok.\n\n(5,4): x=5,y=4, not border, internal obstacles: (6,4) is one, but (5,4) not listed, so ok.\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, but (5,4) is not.\n\nSo all three moves are possible without immediate collision.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term survival.\n\nFood is at (4,1) and (4,2), both positive, value 1.\n\n(4,1) is at y=1, which is above? y=1, head at y=4, so if I go down, to (4,3), then I can go further down to (4,2), (4,1) to eat food.\n\nBut there are obstacles and the snake body.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut tail is at (6,5), not near food, so not an issue now.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid layout.\n\nI should sketch a grid.\n\nAssume (0,0) is top-left, y increases down, x increases right, since U is (x,y+1) which might be down if y=0 top.\n\nIn the movement, U (x,y+1) — if y+1, and U is up, that would mean y=0 is bottom, but usually in games, y=0 is top.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's list the cells.\n\nSet coordinate: x from 0 to 7 left to right, y from 0 to 7 top to bottom? But U (x,y+1) would then be down, because y+1 increases down.\n\nIn the description: U (x,y+1) and U is up, so if U is up, (x,y+1) must be decreasing y or something? Inconsistency.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1) — if U is up, then y+1 should be towards lower y if y=0 is top. But (x,y+1) has higher y, so if y=0 top, y+1 is down.\n\nI think there's a confusion in coordinate system.\n\nPerhaps it's Cartesian: y=0 bottom, y increases up.\n\nBut in the food positions, (4,1) and (4,2), snake at (4,4), (4,5), etc.\n\nHead at (4,4), food at (4,1) and (4,2). If y=4 is higher than y=1, then food is below head.\n\nDirection D is (x,y-1), so decreasing y, which is down if y=0 bottom.\n\nBut walls: y=0 and y=7, with x=0/x=7.\n\nLet's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, or vice versa.\n\nIn the internal obstacles, (6,4), (5,1), etc., no specification.\n\nBut from the context, since U is (x,y+1) and U is up, it implies that y increases upwards, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo head at (4,4), which is middle-ish.\n\nFood at (4,1) and (4,2): since y=1 and y=2, lower y, so below (4,4) if y=0 bottom.\n\nWith y increasing up, (4,4) to (4,1) is down, decreasing y.\n\nDirection D is (x,y-1), so down.\n\nSo to go to (4,1), I need to go down.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is also down.\n\nNow, internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1) and (6,1) are near the food area.\n\nFood at (4,1) and (4,2), so at x=4, y=1 and y=2.\n\nObstacles at (5,1) and (6,1), so to the right of (4,1).\n\nAlso (1,2) to the left, but not directly affecting.\n\nSnake body: positions (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\n(4,5) is above head, (5,5) and (6,5) to the right.\n\nSince head at (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is clear.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go down to (4,2), which has food, or left/right.\n\n(4,2) has food with value 1.\n\nIf I go to (4,2), I eat the food, length increases, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) has food below.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFirst, for turn 12, I need to choose action.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R.\n\nIf I go D to (4,3): then at (4,3), I can consider next moves.\n\nFrom (4,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse if I came from up, but I moved down to (4,3), so direction is D, so cannot go U.\n\nCurrent head direction for turn 12 is D, so after moving to (4,3), the new direction will be D, so for next turn, cannot go U.\n\nSimilarly, if I go L or R now.\n\nBut let's think about getting to the food.\n\nFood at (4,2) and (4,1) are both on x=4, below.\n\n(4,2) has life span 8, (4,1) has life span 6, so (4,1) disappears sooner.\n\nBut both have many turns.\n\nNow, the path to (4,2) is clear: from (4,4) go D to (4,3), then D to (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go D to (4,1) to eat that, or left/right.\n\nBut when I go to (4,2), I eat the food, so length increases by 1, and the food disappears.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so positions change.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here food is at (4,1) and (4,2), not under snake. Snake is at (4,4),(4,5), etc., so not on food.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: not applicable now.\n\nBut long-term, I need to think about survival and maximizing score.\n\nIf I go directly down to (4,2), I can eat it in two turns: turn 12 D to (4,3), turn 13 D to (4,2) eat.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go to (4,1) to eat that, but (4,1) is below.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go D to (4,1), or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2).\n\nBut there is obstacle at (5,1) and (6,1), which might affect moving right.\n\n(5,1) is at x=5,y=1, so if I go to (5,2), it's ok, but (5,1) is obstacle, so I cannot go there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) obstacle.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nNow, after eating (4,2), if I go to (4,1), I eat it immediately if possible.\n\nBut let's see the grid around.\n\nFirst, let's list all blocked cells.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So border cells are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo blocked cells: borders and these points.\n\nNow, snake positions: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) — occupied, so cannot move there except tail under certain conditions.\n\nBut for planning, we consider the cells.\n\nAlso, at turn 12, food at (4,1) and (4,2).\n\nNow, if I go down to (4,3) on turn 12.\n\nThen at turn 13, from (4,3), I can go down to (4,2) to eat the food.\n\nAfter eating, snake length becomes 5, positions: head at (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — since tail (6,5) is removed? No.\n\nWhen you eat food, you grow, so tail stays and new segment is added at head, but in terms of positions: after moving to food, the food is eaten, so the tail does not move, and new head position is added.\n\nStandard: when head moves to food cell, food eaten, so the snake grows: the new positions are the head at the food cell, and all body segments follow, with tail remaining.\n\nFor example, before move to (4,2): positions (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — after move to (4,2) with food, new positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — so tail at (5,5), and length 5.\n\nPreviously tail was (6,5), but after growth, the last segment is (5,5), so (6,5) is no longer part of snake.\n\nInitial positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)] head at (4,4)\n\nAfter move D to (4,3): no food, so positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5), length 4? Snake had 4 segments, after moving without eating, tail moves, so from 4 segments to 4 segments, but tail from (6,5) to (5,5)? Let's track.\n\nStart: segments: S0: (4,4) head, S1: (4,5), S2: (5,5), S3: (6,5) tail.\n\nMove D to (4,3): head moves to (4,3), then S1 moves to previous S0 position (4,4), S2 moves to previous S1 position (4,5), S3 moves to previous S2 position (5,5). So new positions: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5).\n\nS3 was at (6,5), moves to (5,5), so (6,5) is free now.\n\nThen at turn 13, move from (4,3) to (4,2) with food: head moves to (4,2), which has food, so food eaten, no tail movement. New positions: head (4,2), then the previous head (4,3) becomes new segment, so positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5).\n\nLength 5.\n\nNow, from (4,2), I can go to (4,1) to eat the other food.\n\n(4,1) has food, so if I go down to (4,1), I eat it, positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5), length 6.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\n(5,5) is tail, and it's at (5,5), not near (4,1), so no tail reward danger.\n\nHowever, after eating both foods, I am at (4,1) with a long snake, and the area below is y=0, which is wall, so I need to move left or right.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), I can go left to (3,1) or right to (5,1), but (5,1) is an obstacle, so cannot go right. (5,1) is internal obstacle, so blocked.\n\nSimilarly, left to (3,1), then to (2,1), etc., but there is obstacle at (1,2), which is above.\n\ny=1, so (1,2) is at y=2.\n\nAlso, borders.\n\nBut let's see if this path is safe.\n\nFirst, from turn 12, go D to (4,3).\n\nTurn 13, go D to (4,2) eat food.\n\nThen turn 14, go D to (4,1) eat food.\n\nNow at (4,1), with tail at (5,5), body positions: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nNow, from (4,1), I cannot go down to (4,0) because y=0 is wall.\n\nCannot go right to (5,1) because obstacle.\n\nSo only left to (3,1) or up to (4,2), but (4,2) is body, occupied, so I can only go left to (3,1).\n\n(4,2) is the segment behind head, so if I go up to (4,2), it's occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, down and right blocked, so only left to (3,1).\n\nGo to (3,1).\n\nThen from (3,1), I can go left to (2,1), up to (3,2), or down, but down to (3,0) wall.\n\nDown to (3,0) invalid.\n\nSo (2,1) or (3,2).\n\n(2,1) is free? Not wall, not obstacle. Obstacles are (2,4), etc., not (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) free.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAfter going to (3,1), snake positions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nTail at (5,5).\n\nNow, from (3,1), if I go left to (2,1), then to (1,1), etc.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (1,2), which is above (1,1).\n\n(1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) is free, but from (1,1) I can go up to (1,2) but it's obstacle, or left to (0,1) wall, or down to (1,0) wall, so dead end.\n\nIf I go to (2,1), then I can go to (1,1), but from (1,1), only possible move is up to (1,2) but obstacle, so trapped, die.\n\nIf from (3,1) I go up to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is free? Yes.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go to (3,3), (2,2), etc.\n\nBut let's see the snake body: the body is at (4,1), (4,2), etc., so (3,2) might be free, but after moving, positions change.\n\nWhen I move to (3,2), the tail moves if no food eaten.\n\nIn this case, from (3,1), after moving to (3,2), no food, so tail moves: new head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — tail at (4,5), since (5,5) was tail, moves to (4,5)? Positions: after move to (3,2), head to (3,2), then S1 to previous head (3,1), S2 to previous S1 (4,1), S3 to (4,2), S4 to (4,3), S5 to (4,4), S6 to (4,5) — tail at (4,5).\n\nOriginal after eating both: segments: S0: (4,1), S1: (4,2), S2: (4,3), S3: (4,4), S4: (4,5), S5: (5,5)\n\nMove from (4,1) to (3,1): no food, so head to (3,1), then S1 to (4,1) (previous S0), S2 to (4,2), S3 to (4,3), S4 to (4,4), S5 to (4,5) — tail at (4,5), (5,5) gone.\n\nThen from (3,1), move to (3,2): head to (3,2), no food, so S1 to (3,1), S2 to (4,1), S3 to (4,2), S4 to (4,3), S5 to (4,4) — tail at (4,4).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (3,3), (2,2), or (4,2) but (4,2) is occupied by S3, body segment, so cannot go there.\n\n(4,2) is at position of S3, which is not tail, so collision if I go there.\n\nSimilarly, down to (3,1) is behind, but that's reverse, and occupied by S1.\n\nCurrent direction after moving to (3,2) from left? I moved from (3,1) to (3,2), so direction U? (x,y+1) to (3,2), so if U is up, direction U.\n\nThen cannot go D, reverse.\n\nPossible moves from (3,2): U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) but (4,2) occupied, so only U or L.\n\nGo to (3,3) or (2,2).\n\nIf go to (3,3), then to (3,4), but (3,4) might be free, but there is obstacle at (2,4), not (3,4).\n\n(2,4) obstacle, (3,4) free.\n\nBut the snake body is around.\n\nThis seems messy, and I might get trapped.\n\nMoreover, after eating both foods, I'm in a narrow space with obstacles and walls.\n\nPerhaps going directly to eat both foods is risky for long-term survival.\n\nI should consider other options.\n\nFor example, at turn 12, instead of going down, I could go left or right to have more space.\n\nLet's think about the food life span: (4,1) life span 6, so disappears after turn 17, meaning at turn 18 it's gone. Turn 12 to 17 it exists.\n\n(4,2) life span 8, exists until turn 19.\n\nSo I have time.\n\nAlso, there might be other food later, but for now, only these two.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score, so eating both is good, but if I die, score is lost.\n\nSo survival first.\n\nPerhaps I can eat one food and avoid the dead end.\n\nFor example, eat only (4,2) and then move away.\n\n(4,2) is at y=2, I can eat it and then go left or right.\n\nBut (4,1) is below, which I might avoid if it's dangerous.\n\nAnother idea: from current position, I can go left to (3,4) or right to (5,4), then explore.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nFirst, internal obstacles: (6,4) at (6,4), which is near the snake tail at (6,5).\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go there.\n\nAlso, (5,1) and (6,1) obstacles.\n\n(2,4) obstacle at (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nNow, snake at (4,4),(4,5),(5,5),(6,5)\n\nIf I go right to (5,4) on turn 12.\n\n(5,4) is free? x=5,y=4, not border, not obstacle: obstacles (6,4) is at (6,4), (5,1) etc., so (5,4) free.\n\nGo to (5,4), no food, so positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5)? Start: (4,4) head, move R to (5,4), so new head (5,4), then S1 to (4,4), S2 to (4,5), S3 to (5,5) — tail at (5,5).\n\nS3 was (6,5), moves to (5,5), so (6,5) free.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go U to (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied by tail? (5,5) is the current tail position.\n\nIf I go to (5,5), since it's the tail, and I move there, no food, so tail will move, so no collision.\n\nRule: can move into tail cell because tail moves away.\n\nSo I can go to (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,3), L to (4,4) but (4,4) is occupied by S1, body segment, not tail, so collision.\n\nR to (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle, so blocked.\n\nSo from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4) but occupied, not possible, R to (6,4) obstacle, not possible.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nU to (5,5) or D to (5,3).\n\nIf I go U to (5,5), which is tail, so no collision, new positions: head to (5,5), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) — tail at (4,5)? Move: head to (5,5), which was tail, so since no food, tail moves to previous S2 position, which was (5,5)? Positions before move: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n\nHead at (5,4), move U to (5,5), which is tail cell. After move, head at (5,5), then S1 to previous head (5,4), S2 to previous S1 (4,4), S3 to previous S2 (4,5) — so new tail at (4,5), positions (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)\n\n(4,5) is tail.\n\nThen from there, I can move, but it might not be productive.\n\nIf from (5,4) I go D to (5,3), then I can go down.\n\nBut let's back to turn 12.\n\nAnother option: go left to (3,4).\n\nFrom head (4,4) go L to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) free? x=3,y=4, not border, not obstacle. Obstacles: (2,4) is at (2,4), so (3,4) free.\n\nGo to (3,4), no food, positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5), (6,5) gone.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, so blocked, R to (4,4) occupied by body.\n\nSo possible U or D.\n\nGo U to (3,5) or D to (3,3).\n\n(3,5) might be free.\n\nBut not near food.\n\nPerhaps I should aim to eat the food at (4,2) but not go to (4,1) to avoid the dead end.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) go D to (4,3) on turn 12.\n\nThen on turn 13, from (4,3) go to (4,2) eat food.\n\nNow at (4,2), with positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go L to (3,2) or R to (5,2) or U to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied, so cannot.\n\nD to (4,1) but I can choose not to go there.\n\nSo go left to (3,2) or right to (5,2).\n\n(3,2) free? x=3,y=2, not border, not obstacle. Obstacles: (1,2) is at (1,2), so (3,2) free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) free? x=5,y=2, not border, obstacles: (5,1) at (5,1), so (5,2) free.\n\nSo I can go to (3,2) or (5,2).\n\nSay I go left to (3,2).\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go to (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), etc.\n\nSimilarly, if I go right to (5,2), then to (5,3), (6,2), etc.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (6,1), (5,1), so (5,2) is ok.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (4,1). I can leave it or eat it later if possible.\n\nBut (4,1) has shorter life span, only 6 turns, so if I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\nTurn 12, life span 6, so at turn 17 it disappears.\n\nIf I eat at turn 14, it's fine, but if I avoid, I might not eat it.\n\nBut since it's positive food, I should eat it if possible.\n\nBut the area around (4,1) is dangerous because of walls and obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), only way out is left to (3,1), then to (3,2) or (2,1), but (2,1) leads to dead end as before.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go to (3,2), which is better.\n\nSo if I eat (4,1), then immediately go left to (3,1), then to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut when I go to (3,1), the snake is long, so I need space to move.\n\nPerhaps I can eat both but have a plan to exit.\n\nAnother idea: don't eat (4,1) at all, only eat (4,2) and move to open space.\n\nBut (4,2) is safe to eat, and then I can go left or right.\n\nLet's prioritize long-term survival.\n\nThe grid has open areas.\n\nFor example, top-right or bottom-left, but with obstacles.\n\nList all free cells.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but borders walls, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Borders x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are invalid, but internal cells from (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls.\n\nBut internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4, which is within 1-6, but obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) all within.\n\nSo free cells except these obstacles and snake positions.\n\nSnake positions will move.\n\nBut for now, at turn 12, snake occupies (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\nFood at (4,1), (4,2)\n\nI should consider the risk of going to (4,1).\n\nSince (4,1) is at y=1, near wall, and only left exit, and (3,1) then to (2,1) or (3,2), but (2,1) is a dead end because (1,2) obstacle blocks up, and walls.\n\nFrom (2,1), can go to (2,2), (1,1), (3,1), but (1,1) can go to (1,2) but obstacle, so from (1,1) only to (1,2) which is blocked, or (2,1), or (1,0) wall, so yes, (1,1) is dead end if (1,2) blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) can go to (2,2), which is free.\n\n(2,2) is free, no obstacle.\n\nObstacles: (1,2) at (1,2), so (2,2) is free.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can go to (2,2), then to (2,3), etc.\n\nNot necessarily dead end.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) go left to (3,1), then to (3,2) or (2,1).\n\nIf go to (2,1), then to (2,2), then to (2,3), (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot go to (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so from (2,2) I can go to (2,3), (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, (3,2), or (2,1).\n\n(2,3) is free, then to (2,4) but blocked, so from (2,3) I can go to (3,3), (1,3), etc.\n\n(1,3) free, then to (1,4), etc.\n\nSo there are paths, not immediately trapped.\n\nBut it's tight with the snake body.\n\nTo avoid risk, perhaps for now, at turn 12, I can go down to (4,3) to be closer to food.\n\nThen on turn 13, I can eat (4,2) by going D to (4,2).\n\nThen at (4,2), I have a choice: go D to (4,1) to eat or go L or R.\n\nIf I go R to (5,2), for example.\n\n(5,2) is free, then from there I can go to (5,3), (6,2), etc.\n\n(6,2) free? x=6,y=2, not border, obstacles (6,1) at (6,1), so (6,2) free.\n\nThen to (6,3), but (6,4) is obstacle, so cannot go up to (6,4).\n\nFrom (6,2) can go to (6,3), then to (5,3) or (6,2) to (7,2) but x=7 wall, so only (5,3) or (6,3).\n\n(6,3) to (6,4) blocked, so must go left to (5,3), etc.\n\nStill manageable.\n\nBut I can eat (4,1) later if I want.\n\nLife span of (4,1) is 6, so I have until turn 17 to eat it.\n\nTurn 12, eat at turn 13 or 14 is early.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 12.\n\nPlan actions for turn 12,13,14,15,16 at least.\n\nOption 1: Go down both foods.\n\nTurn 12: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: D to (4,2) eat food\n\nTurn 14: D to (4,1) eat food\n\nThen at (4,1), go L to (3,1) on turn 15.\n\nThen on turn 16, from (3,1) go to (3,2) or (2,1).\n\nSay go to (3,2) on turn 16.\n\nThen from (3,2) can go to (3,3) or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut the snake is long, length 6 after eating both, and the area might be cramped.\n\nOption 2: Eat only (4,2) and then move left or right.\n\nTurn 12: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: D to (4,2) eat\n\nThen on turn 14, from (4,2) go L to (3,2) or R to (5,2).\n\nSay go L to (3,2).\n\nThen from (3,2) on turn 15, go to (3,3) or (2,2), etc.\n\nThen I can leave (4,1) to disappear, but it's positive food, so I lose a point.\n\nBut if eating it risks death, better to avoid.\n\nBut is it risky?\n\nAt (4,1), after eating, I go to (3,1), then to (3,2), which is safe.\n\nFrom (3,2) I can go to (3,3), then to (3,4), but (3,4) might be free, or to (2,2), (4,2), etc.\n\n(4,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAfter turn 13: at (4,2) with positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n\nTurn 14: go L to (3,2), no food, so positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — tail at (4,5), (5,5) gone.\n\nThen turn 15: from (3,2) go U to (3,3) or L to (2,2) or D to (3,1), etc.\n\nSay go U to (3,3).\n\nPositions: head to (3,3), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) — tail at (4,4).\n\nThen turn 16: from (3,3) go U to (3,4) or L to (2,3) or R to (4,3) but (4,3) may be occupied.\n\n(4,3) is position of S3, body, so if I go R to (4,3), occupied, collision.\n\nL to (2,3) or U to (3,4).\n\n etc.\n\nNow, the food at (4,1) is still there, life span 6 at turn 12, so at turn 14, after two turns, life span 4? At turn 12, L=6, after turn 12, L=5; turn 13, L=5, after turn 13, L=4; turn 14, L=4, so still present.\n\nI can go back to eat it.\n\nFrom (3,3) on turn 16, I can go D to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, or L to (2,3), etc., not directly to (4,1).\n\nTo reach (4,1) from here, I need to go down to (3,2), then to (3,1), then to (4,1) but (4,1) might be free.\n\nBut on turn 16, (4,1) life span: at turn 12 L=6, turn 13 L=5, turn 14 L=4, turn 15 L=3, turn 16 L=2, so still there.\n\nBut from (3,3) to (4,1) is not direct.\n\nPath: from (3,3) go to (3,2) on turn 16, but (3,2) is occupied by body? Positions at turn 15 end: head (3,3), S1 (3,2), S2 (4,2), S3 (4,3), S4 (4,4) tail.\n\nSo (3,2) is occupied by S1, body segment, so I cannot move to (3,2) from (3,3) because it's occupied and not tail.\n\nOnly possible moves from (3,3): U to (3,4), L to (2,3), R to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied by S3, collision, D to (3,2) occupied, collision.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nGo to (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nSay go to (3,4).\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places, but not back to (4,1) easily.\n\nTo eat (4,1), I need to be at (4,2) or (3,1) or (5,1) but (5,1) obstacle, so from (4,2) or (3,1) or (4,0) invalid.\n\nSo only from (4,2) down or (3,1) right or (5,1) invalid, so from (4,2) or (3,1).\n\nBut (4,2) might be occupied.\n\nIf I want to eat (4,1), I should do it soon after eating (4,2).\n\nOtherwise, it might be hard to reach later.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,2) on turn 14, then to (3,3) on turn 15, I am away from (4,1).\n\nThen to go to (3,1), I need to go down from (3,2) or something.\n\nBut from (3,3), I can only go to (3,4) or (2,3), not down.\n\nSo I can't go down easily.\n\nTherefore, if I don't eat (4,1) immediately after (4,2), I might not get it.\n\nSince (4,1) has shorter life, I should eat it now.\n\nPerhaps the best is to eat both and then exit via (3,1) to (3,2).\n\nLet's do that.\n\nTurn 12: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: D to (4,2) eat\n\nTurn 14: D to (4,1) eat\n\nNow at (4,1), turn 15: go L to (3,1) (only choice, as D and R blocked)\n\nThen turn 16: from (3,1) I can go U to (3,2) or L to (2,1) or D to (3,0) invalid, so U or L.\n\nGo U to (3,2) for more space.\n\nThen from (3,2) on turn 17, I can go to (3,3), (2,2), etc.\n\nAnd (4,1) food is eaten, so no issue.\n\nLife span of (4,1) is 6 at turn 12, so at turn 14 when eaten, it's fine.\n\n(4,2) life span 8, eaten at turn 13.\n\nNow, for long-term, after turn 17, I am at (3,2) or wherever, and I can explore the grid.\n\nBut there is a risk at the beginning: when I go to (4,1) on turn 14, and then to (3,1) on turn 15, the snake body is vertical at x=4 from y=1 to y=5, and tail at (5,5), so when I move left to (3,1), the body follows, so positions become more horizontal.\n\nAt turn 14 end: head (4,1), S1 (4,2), S2 (4,3), S3 (4,4), S4 (4,5), S5 (5,5) tail.\n\nTurn 15: move L to (3,1), no food, so head to (3,1), then S1 to (4,1), S2 to (4,2), S3 to (4,3), S4 to (4,4), S5 to (4,5) — tail at (4,5).\n\nThen turn 16: from (3,1) go U to (3,2), no food, head to (3,2), then S1 to (3,1), S2 to (4,1), S3 to (4,2), S4 to (4,3), S5 to (4,4) — tail at (4,4).\n\nNow from (3,2), I can go U to (3,3), L to (2,2), or R to (4,2) but (4,2) occupied by S3, collision, D to (3,1) occupied, so only U or L.\n\nGo to (3,3) or (2,2).\n\nSay go to (3,3) on turn 17.\n\nThen continue.\n\nThe grid has open areas, for example, top-left or bottom-right, but with obstacles.\n\nSince I have eaten two foods, score +2, and snake length 6, I can survive by moving around.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 12, I could go left or right to have more options, but that might delay eating food.\n\nFor example, if I go left to (3,4) on turn 12.\n\nThen turn 13, from (3,4) go D to (3,3) or U to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut then I am farther from food, and (4,1) might disappear before I can eat it.\n\nLife span 6, so by turn 17 it's gone.\n\nIf I go left, I might not reach it in time.\n\nFor example, turn 12: go L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 13: from (3,4) go D to (3,3) (say)\n\nTurn 14: to (3,2)\n\nTurn 15: to (3,1)\n\nTurn 16: to (4,1) but from (3,1) to (4,1), which is right.\n\nAt turn 16, (4,1) life span: at turn 12 L=6, turn 13 L=5, turn 14 L=4, turn 15 L=3, turn 16 L=2, so present, can eat on turn 16.\n\nBut on turn 15, if I am at (3,1), I can go to (4,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (4,2) on the way.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nPerhaps the direct way to eat both is acceptable.\n\nMoreover, the tail reward danger is not an issue.\n\nSo for turn 12, I think going down to (4,3) is best.\n\nThen turn 13 down to (4,2) eat.\n\nTurn 14 down to (4,1) eat.\n\nThen turn 15 left to (3,1).\n\nThen turn 16 up to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 17 to (3,3) or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut the answer format is to list actions for current turn and next turns, but not necessarily 5, but at least for the immediate action with future in mind.\n\nThe instruction: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from turn t1.\n\nAnd \"maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks\".\n\nSo for now, at turn 12, action is D.\n\nThen for the output, I need to list actions for turn 12 and subsequent turns as per the plan.\n\nBut the plan might change based on new food or something, but for now, no new food, so I can plan a sequence.\n\nSince only these foods, I can output a sequence.\n\nBut the state might have new food later, but in this input, only these two foods.\n\nSo I think for this, I can do:\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: U  (from (3,1) to (3,2))\n\nBut turn 16 U to (3,2), which is (x,y+1), up.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,3) on turn 17, for example.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, but since the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" it might be for a few turns.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll provide for turn 12 to 16 or so.\n\nAnother thing: when I go to (4,1) on turn 14, and it has food, I eat it, but is there tail reward danger? Tail is at (5,5), not adjacent, so no.\n\nHead at (4,1), tail at (5,5), not adjacent, so safe.\n\nThen go to (3,1).\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps I can consider not eating (4,1) to avoid the corner, but since I can escape via left, it should be fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 12 Decision\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned at least 5 turns ahead. Here's the reasoning:\n\n- **Current Snake State**: Head at (4,4) moving down (D). Snake length is 4, with body segments at (4,5), (5,5), and tail at (6,5). Possible moves from (4,4) are D (down to (4,3)), L (left to (3,4)), or R (right to (5,4)), since U (up) is the reverse direction and not allowed. All moves are valid immediately (no walls or body collisions).\n- **Food State**: \n  - (4,1): Positive food (value +1), life span 6 (disappears after turn 17).\n  - (4,2): Positive food (value +1), life span 8 (disappears after turn 19).\n  Both foods are on the same column (x=4) below the snake, with (4,1) closer to the bottom wall (y=0). Eating both is desirable for score, but the area near (4,1) is risky due to walls (y=0), obstacles (e.g., (5,1)), and limited escape routes.\n- **Risks and Opportunities**:\n  - Directly moving down to eat both foods quickly (turns 12-14) is efficient for score, but after eating (4,1), the snake is trapped near (4,1) with only one escape path (left to (3,1)). This could lead to dead ends if not managed.\n  - Alternative moves (L or R at turn 12) avoid immediate risk but delay eating, risking that (4,1) disappears by turn 17. With life span 6, it must be eaten by turn 17 to avoid loss.\n  - After eating, the snake grows to length 6, requiring open space for movement. The grid has obstacles (e.g., (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)) and walls, but paths exist via the left side (e.g., moving to (3,2) or beyond).\n  - Tail reward danger is not an issue; the tail is distant from the food.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turn 12: Move D to (4,3)** - Gets closer to food and avoids unnecessary detours. This sets up eating (4,2) next turn.\n  - **Turn 13: Move D to (4,2)** - Eats the food (score +1, length 5). From (4,3), moving D is valid (no reverse issue; direction becomes D).\n  - **Turn 14: Move D to (4,1)** - Eats the food (score +1, length 6). Although (4,1) is near the wall, it must be eaten now to avoid missing it (life span low). Escape via left is planned next.\n  - **Turn 15: Move L to (3,1)** - Only safe exit from (4,1) (down to y=0 wall, right to (5,1) obstacle blocked). Snake moves left, opening space.\n  - **Turn 16: Move U to (3,2)** - From (3,1), moving U (to (3,2)) avoids dead ends and gains maneuverability. Direction after L is left, so U is allowed (not reverse).\n  - **Beyond Turn 16**: From (3,2), future moves can explore open areas (e.g., U to (3,3) or L to (2,2)) to avoid body collisions and seek new food. This ensures survival and potential for more scoring.\n\nThis sequence eats both foods quickly (+2 score) and exits the risky corner by turn 16. It prioritizes score while ensuring survival through turn 16 and beyond. If new food appears, the plan can adapt, but with current information, this is optimal.\n\n### Actions for Turns 12-16\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: D (down)  \nTurn 13: D (down)  \nTurn 14: D (down)  \nTurn 15: L (left)  \nTurn 16: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 13, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I must avoid those.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,3), then body segments at (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, I assume. In coordinates, (x,y), D is (x,y-1), as per the movement constraints.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (4,1) with life span 5, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,2) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (3,5) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including current turn, so I need to consider how long they last.\n\nCurrent turn is 13, so for (4,1), life span 5, it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning it will be gone on turn 18 (13+5=18, but since it decreases on current turn, after turn 17 it might be gone? Let's clarify.\n\nThe life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So at turn t, if life span is N, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t. So after N turns, it disappears. For example, at turn t, life span N, it disappears at the start of turn t+N+1? I need to be careful.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so:\n\n- Turn t: life span N\n\n- Turn t+1: life span N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t+N-1: life span 1\n\n- Turn t+N: life span 0, disappears before turn t+N+1 or after?\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means that at the beginning of turn t, the food has life span N. After the turn, when we move to the next turn, life span decreases by 1. So:\n\n- Start of turn t: life span N\n\n- After turn t actions, at start of turn t+1: life span N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Start of turn t+N: life span 0, so it disappears and is not available on turn t+N.\n\n- On turn t+N, if life span was 1 at start of turn, after turn it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nBut for eating, if you move to a food cell on turn t, you eat it at that turn, before it disappears.\n\nThe rule doesn't specify when exactly it disappears, but since it can be eaten on the turn, I think we consider the life span at the start of the turn.\n\nTo be safe, let's assume:\n\n- At the start of a turn, if life span > 0, food is present.\n\n- After the snake moves and if head is on food, it is eaten.\n\n- Then, at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1 for all food.\n\n- If life span becomes 0, it disappears for the next turn.\n\nFor this case:\n\nFood at (4,1): life span 5 at turn 13. So:\n\n- Turn 13: life span 5, present\n\n- Turn 14: life span 4, present\n\n- Turn 15: life span 3, present\n\n- Turn 16: life span 2, present\n\n- Turn 17: life span 1, present\n\n- Turn 18: life span 0, not present\n\nSimilarly, (4,2): life span 7 at turn 13, so present until turn 19 (13+7=20, but 20-13=7, so turn 13 to 19: spans 7 turns).\n\nLife span N means it lasts for N more turns including current.\n\nAt turn t, life span N, it will be gone after N turns, meaning not available on turn t+N.\n\nFor (4,1), N=5, turn 13, gone after 5 turns, so not on turn 18.\n\nTurn 13: available\n\nTurn 14: available\n\n...\n\nTurn 17: available (since 13+4=17, life span 1)\n\nTurn 18: not available\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) N=7, available from turn 13 to 19 (turn 13 to 19 inclusive is 7 turns: 13,14,15,16,17,18,19)\n\nTurn 13: N=7\n\nTurn 14: N=6\n\n...\n\nTurn 19: N=1\n\nTurn 20: N=0, gone\n\nBut turn 20 is not in our immediate planning, but good to know.\n\n(3,5) N=10, available for a long time.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,3), direction down (D), so moving towards decreasing y.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so I cannot move up (U) on the next turn because of no instant reverse. So possible moves from (4,3) are: down (D), left (L), right (R), but not up (U) since opposite to current down.\n\nDirections: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nFrom (4,3):\n\n- D: (4,2) - but (4,2) has food? (4,2) is a food position with value 1.\n\n(4,2) is listed as food.\n\n- L: (3,3)\n\n- R: (5,3)\n\n- U: (4,4) but (4,4) is the body segment, and since direction is down, moving up is reverse, not allowed.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves from current position (4,3) with direction D.\n\nCannot move U because reverse.\n\nCan move D, L, or R.\n\nNow, check what cells are available:\n\n- D: (4,2) - this has food (positive), and y=2, not wall, and not obstacle? Obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,2) is not in obstacles, and not border wall since x=4 not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7. Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,2) is inside.\n\n- L: (3,3) - empty? No food listed, and not wall or obstacle. Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (3,3) not there.\n\n- R: (5,3) - empty? Not food, not wall. But (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,3) is different. Also, internal obstacles are points, so (5,3) should be free.\n\nNow, if I move to (4,2), I eat the food there, since head moves to it. Value +1, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nBut I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there's a food at (4,1) below it, and (3,5) elsewhere.\n\nSnake body: positions [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nIf I move down to (4,2), head goes to (4,2), then the body: the tail is at (5,5), but when head moves to (4,2) and eats, the snake grows, so new positions: head at (4,2), then the previous head (4,3) becomes body, so body segments: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), and since it grows, the tail stays or what?\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food, so when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so snake increases by one segment.\n\nSo, if head moves to food, new head position is food cell, body segments: all previous positions, including the old head, so the snake gets longer by one.\n\nIn this case, if move to (4,2), which is food, so eat it, new snake positions: head at (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — so now 5 segments.\n\nBut (4,2) was food, now it's head.\n\nThen, the food at (4,2) is consumed, so it disappears.\n\nNow, there's also food at (4,1) directly below.\n\nAnd food at (3,5).\n\nNow, after moving to (4,2), the head is at (4,2), direction is down.\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, consider the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nWhat is the tail? In this case, after moving to (4,2), tail is at (5,5).\n\nHead at (4,2), tail at (5,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (4,2) and (5,5) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, not same row or column adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells: up, down, left, right, so (4,2) adjacent to (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2). Not (5,5).\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut if I move to (4,2), I eat the food, grow, and now head at (4,2) with direction down.\n\nThen from there, I can move down to (4,1), which is also food.\n\n(4,1) has food with life span 5.\n\nIf I move to (4,1) on next turn, I eat that too.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, possible actions for turn 13: from (4,3) with direction D, can move D, L, or R.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (4,2) - eat food, grow to 5 segments, head now at (4,2), direction D.\n\nThen for turn 14, from (4,2), direction D, can move D, L, R (not U, reverse).\n\nMove D to (4,1) - (4,1) has food, so eat again, grow to 6 segments, head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen (4,1) is at y=1, not y=0, so can move down? y=1, move D to (4,0), but y=0 is wall border, so cannot move to (4,0), it's wall.\n\nSo from (4,1), after eating, head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: D to (4,0) - wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) - is this free? Let's check obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (3,1) not listed, so should be free. Walls: borders and internal obstacles, so (3,1) should be ok.\n\nR to (5,1) - but (5,1) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nU to (4,2) - but direction is D, moving U is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (4,1) with direction D, possible moves: only L to (3,1) or R to (5,1), but (5,1) is obstacle, so only L to (3,1).\n\nSo after moving to (4,1) on turn 14, on turn 15 I must move left to (3,1).\n\nThen head at (3,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow, (3,1) is empty, no food, so snake doesn't grow, tail moves.\n\nSnake positions: after turn 14, head at (4,1), body: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — 6 segments.\n\nThen move to (3,1), head to (3,1), then body moves: the tail was (5,5), now moves to the previous position, but since no growth, tail moves forward, so new body: the segment after head is (4,1), but (4,1) was head, now it's body, and so on.\n\nAfter move to (3,1) without eating, positions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — tail is (4,5)? Let's trace:\n\nBefore move to (3,1): positions: head (4,1), body segments: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,1) and no eat, tail moves off (5,5), so new positions: head (3,1), then the previous positions except tail: so (4,1) becomes first body, then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) — tail is (4,5), since (5,5) was tail and we moved away.\n\nThe body segments: after head moves, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo from: segment 0: (4,1) head\n\nSegment 1: (4,2)\n\nSegment 2: (4,3)\n\nSegment 3: (4,4)\n\nSegment 4: (4,5)\n\nSegment 5: (5,5) tail\n\nAfter head moves to (3,1), new head (3,1)\n\nThen segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, (4,1)\n\nSegment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (4,2)\n\n...\n\nSegment 5 (tail) moves to where segment 4 was, (4,5)\n\nSo new positions: head (3,1), then body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\n(5,5) is no longer part of snake.\n\nTail is at (4,5).\n\nNow head at (3,1), direction L.\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nBut this is getting ahead; let's first decide turn 13.\n\nIf I go down to (4,2), I get +1, but then I might be stuck at (4,1) with only one way out, to (3,1), and then I have to navigate.\n\nAlso, there's food at (3,5) which is far away.\n\nAnother option: from (4,3), move left to (3,3).\n\nThen no eat, head to (3,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen snake positions: after move, head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move U, D, L, R, but direction now L, so cannot move R (reverse).\n\nPossible: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R not allowed.\n\nNow, (3,4): not wall, not obstacle, no food? Food is at (4,1), (4,2), (3,5). (3,4) no food.\n\n(3,2): no food, should be free.\n\n(2,3): no food, but obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) not, so should be free.\n\nThen I can go towards (3,5) which is food at (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is food, life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nIf I move to (3,3), then I can go up to (3,4), then to (3,5) to eat.\n\nFrom (3,3), move U to (3,4), head to (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen from (3,4), can move U to (3,5), which is food, eat it.\n\n(3,5) has food, so eat, grow.\n\nBut let's see the positions.\n\nFirst, turn 13: from (4,3) move L to (3,3), no eat, positions: head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 14: from (3,3) move U to (3,4), no food, positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5) — since no growth, tail moved from (5,5) to (4,5)? \n\nBefore move: positions: head (3,3), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nAfter move head to (3,4): new head (3,4), seg1 to (3,3), seg2 to (4,3), seg3 to (4,4), tail to (4,5) — (5,5) gone.\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nHead at (3,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 15: move U to (3,5), which has food, so eat, grow to 5 segments? Originally 4, after turn 13 no grow, still 4, after turn 14 no grow, still 4, then eat on turn 15, grow to 5.\n\nPositions after turn 15: head at (3,5), then previous positions: so head was (3,4), now body, then (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), and tail (4,5) but since growth, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) remains tail? No.\n\nWhen eat, head moves to food, and tail stays, so new segment added at tail.\n\nSo after eating at (3,5): head at (3,5), then the previous head position (3,4) becomes body, and all other segments remain, so body: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) is still there, so snake has segments: head (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,4), tail (4,5) — 6 segments? Let's list:\n\nBefore move to (3,5): positions: head (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter move head to (3,5) and eat: head at (3,5), then the previous positions: seg1 becomes (3,4), seg2 becomes (3,3), seg3 becomes (4,3), seg4 becomes (4,4), and tail (4,5) remains since growth, so new segment at tail position. So positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5) — yes, 6 segments.\n\n(4,5) was tail and it stays.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\n(3,5) is at y=5, not wall, but I can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4) but reverse not allowed since direction U, L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is now a body segment, since it's part of snake.\n\nIn positions, (4,5) is tail, but if I move to (4,5), it would be body collision.\n\nHead at (3,5), adjacent cells:\n\nU: (3,6) - y=6, not border, no obstacle? Obstacles not at (3,6), so free.\n\nD: (3,4) - but (3,4) is body segment, and since direction is U, moving D is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n\nL: (2,5) - x=2, y=5, not border, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not, so should be free.\n\nR: (4,5) - but (4,5) is the tail segment, so if I move there, head touches body, collision.\n\nBut is it safe? Since tail will move if I don't eat, but here I am moving to the tail cell.\n\nRule: deadly collisions: body collision, head touches any body segment.\n\nBut there is an exception: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nLet's read: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to the tail cell is allowed because when you move, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,5), which is tail, it should be ok, because after move, tail moves to next position.\n\nIn the sequence above, if I move head to (4,5), which is current tail, and since I don't eat (no food there), then after moving, tail moves away, so head is at (4,5), and tail was at (4,5) but moves to where the previous segment was, so no issue.\n\nBut in this case, (4,5) is not food, so if I move to it, no eat, and no collision because tail moves.\n\nSimilarly, if it were food, but not in this case.\n\nBack to point.\n\nFrom (3,5), after eating, I can move to (4,5) since it's tail and will move.\n\nBut (4,5) is not food, so just move.\n\nOptions: U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5) — all possible since D not allowed.\n\n(4,5) is safe because it's tail.\n\nBut I should consider the grid.\n\nAnother option for turn 13: move right to (5,3).\n\nFrom (4,3) move R to (5,3), no food, head to (5,3), direction R.\n\nThen positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nNow, (5,3) is at x=5, y=3.\n\nPossible moves: direction R, so cannot move L (reverse).\n\nCan move U to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3).\n\nNow, (5,4): not wall, but obstacle at (6,4), not (5,4), so free.\n\n(5,2): y=2, not wall, obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,2) not, so free.\n\n(6,3): x=6, y=3, not border, but internal obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), (6,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,3) is different cell.\n\nNow, no food nearby except the ones at (4,1) and (4,2), but I'm at (5,3), so I can go down to (5,2), then to (5,1) but (5,1) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nOr left, but direction R, cannot move L.\n\nU to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut food at (4,1) and (4,2) are below, but I might not reach them easily from here.\n\n(3,5) is at left-top.\n\nSo moving right might take me away from foods.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eating food is good.\n\nNow, back to the first option: if I go down to (4,2) on turn 13, I eat +1, then on turn 14 to (4,1), eat +1, then on turn 15 to (3,1), no eat.\n\nThen from (3,1), direction L, since I moved left.\n\nHead at (3,1), I can move U, D, L, R, but direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nU to (3,2), D to (3,0) but y=0 wall, invalid, L to (2,1), R not allowed.\n\n(3,2): no food, free.\n\n(2,1): x=2,y=1, not border, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, (1,2) is, but (2,1) not, so free.\n\nAlso, food at (4,2) and (4,1) are eaten, only (3,5) left.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go up to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc. to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) has life span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut after eating two foods, I have longer snake, which might be riskier.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (4,1) has life span 5, so if I don't eat it soon, it might disappear.\n\nAt turn 13, life span 5, so if not eaten by turn 17, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) life span 7, gone after turn 19.\n\n(3,5) life span 10, gone after turn 22 or so.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: but not applicable now.\n\nLet's list all possible paths.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid going down immediately because I might get stuck at the bottom.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I move left to (3,3), I can then go to (3,5) and eat it on turn 15, as I thought earlier.\n\nThen I have +1, and head at (3,5).\n\nThen from there, I can move to, say, (3,6) or (2,5) or (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is body, but tail, so can move to it if no food.\n\nIn positions after eating at (3,5), tail at (4,5), so moving to (4,5) is safe.\n\nThen I can explore other areas.\n\nBut there are obstacles, so I need to see the grid.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — so vertical at x=4, y=3,4,5, then tail at (5,5)\n\nFood: (4,1), (4,2), (3,5)\n\n(4,1) is at x=4,y=1, (4,2) at x=4,y=2, (3,5) at x=3,y=5.\n\nNow, if I move down to (4,2) on turn 13, eat, head at (4,2), snake: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — 5 segments.\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 14: move D to (4,1), eat, head at (4,1), snake: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — 6 segments.\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 15: must move L to (3,1), since D to wall, R to obstacle, U reverse. So move L to (3,1), no eat, head at (3,1), direction L.\n\nPositions: after move, head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5) — (5,5) moved off.\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nNow, from (3,1), direction L, can move U to (3,2), D to (3,0) invalid, L to (2,1), R not allowed.\n\n(3,2) is empty, no food.\n\n(2,1) is empty.\n\nI can go to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,5), I need to go up.\n\nFrom (3,1) move U to (3,2), head to (3,2), direction U (since moved up, but previous direction was L, now moved U, so new direction U).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,2), that's up, so direction U.\n\nThen from (3,2), can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1) reverse not allowed, L to (2,2), R to (4,2) but (4,2) is body? Positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), tail (4,4)? Let's see.\n\nBefore move to (3,2): positions: head (3,1), seg1 (4,1), seg2 (4,2), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter move head to (3,2) no eat: new head (3,2), seg1 to (3,1), seg2 to (4,1), seg3 to (4,2), seg4 to (4,3), tail to (4,4) — so tail at (4,4)\n\nHead at (3,2), direction U.\n\nMove U to (3,3), no food, positions: head (3,3), body (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), tail (4,3)\n\nThen move U to (3,4), no food, positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (4,2)\n\nThen move U to (3,5), which has food, eat, grow to 7 segments.\n\nHead at (3,5), then positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (4,2) and new segment, so tail at (4,2)? When eat, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (3,5), then previous head (3,4) becomes body, and all segments, so body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), and tail (4,2) but (4,2) is already there, no.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5): before move, positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (4,2)\n\nAfter move head to (3,5) and eat: head (3,5), then the previous positions remain, so body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), and since growth, tail stays, so new segment, positions: head (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (3,1), seg5 (4,1), tail (4,2) — 7 segments.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen I can move U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is not body, it was tail but moved, in current positions, (4,5) is free? In the list, cells occupied are (3,5) head, (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) tail. So (4,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) free, (2,5) free.\n\nSo all good.\n\nIn this path, by turn 15, I have eaten 3 foods: (4,2), (4,1), (3,5), so +3.\n\nTurn 13: eat (4,2), turn 14: eat (4,1), turn 15: eat (3,5).\n\nOn turn 15 I eat (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) was eaten on turn 15.\n\nNow, if I move left first on turn 13, to (3,3), then turn 14 to (3,4), turn 15 to (3,5) eat, so only +1 by turn 15, and (4,1) and (4,2) might be available later.\n\nBut (4,1) has short life span.\n\nAt turn 13, (4,1) life span 5, so available until turn 17.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) first, I eat on turn 15, then I can try to go to (4,1), but from (3,5) to (4,1) is far, and snake is longer.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5) on turn 15, head at (3,5), I can move down or right.\n\nBut (4,1) is at bottom.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) move R to (4,5), no eat, head to (4,5), direction R.\n\nPositions: before, head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (4,2)\n\nAfter move to (4,5) no eat: new head (4,5), seg1 to (3,5), but (3,5) was head, now body, seg2 to (3,4), seg3 to (3,3), seg4 to (3,2), seg5 to (3,1), tail to (4,1) — so positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1), which has food? (4,1) has food, but it's tail now, and head is at (4,5), not adjacent.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move down to (4,4), but (4,4) is body? Positions: (4,5) head, (3,5) body, (3,4) body, etc., (4,4) not occupied? In the list, cells: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So (4,4) is free? (4,4) is not in positions, so free.\n\nSimilarly, U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, collision, R to (5,5) but (5,5) not occupied, but obstacles? (5,5) not obstacle.\n\nDirection is R, so can move U, D, R, not L (reverse).\n\nU to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is free, no problem.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), it's at tail, but I can't eat it directly; I need to move the snake so that head goes to (4,1), but (4,1) is currently tail, so if I move such that tail moves away and head comes, but it's occupied.\n\n(4,1) has food, but it's under the tail segment.\n\nRule: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nCurrently, (4,1) has food and is occupied by tail.\n\nSo to eat it, I need to move so that the tail moves away from (4,1), then the food is revealed, and then I can move head to it later.\n\nBut (4,1) life span 5 at turn 13, so by turn 15, life span 3, still available.\n\nAfter turn 15, when I have head at (3,5) or wherever.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) first on turn 15, then from there, to reach (4,1) which is at bottom, I need several moves.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) to (4,5) to (4,4) to (4,3) but (4,3) might be body.\n\nIt might take many turns, and (4,1) might disappear.\n\nSpecifically, (4,1) life span 5 at turn 13, so at turn 15, if turn 15 is after 2 turns, life span 3, so available on turn 15,16,17, gone on 18.\n\nOn turn 15, if I am at (3,5), I can move down, but to (4,1) it's 4 steps down and left, but snake is long, so I need to navigate.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (4,1): min moves, but with body, it's hard.\n\nFor instance, from (3,5) move D to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nMove to (4,5) first, as before.\n\nThen from (4,5) move D to (4,4), which is free, head to (4,4), direction D.\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), tail (3,1) — tail at (3,1)\n\nThen from (4,4) move D to (4,3), but (4,3) is not body? Positions: (4,4) head, (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) tail. (4,3) not occupied, so can move to (4,3), no food, head to (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen move D to (4,2), but (4,2) has food? (4,2) food, but life span, at turn 13 life span 7, turn 15 life span 5, still available.\n\nBut (4,2) may be occupied or not.\n\nIn this path, at turn 15, after eating (3,5), positions have (3,1) to (3,5) and (4,1), (4,2) is free? (4,2) is not in snake, so food is there.\n\nIf I move to (4,2), I can eat it.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nTurn 13: move L to (3,3), no eat.\n\nTurn 14: move U to (3,4), no eat.\n\nTurn 15: move U to (3,5), eat, grow.\n\nThen turn 16: from (3,5) move R to (4,5), no eat.\n\nTurn 17: from (4,5) move D to (4,4), no eat.\n\nTurn 18: from (4,4) move D to (4,3), no eat.\n\nTurn 19: from (4,3) move D to (4,2), eat if available.\n\nBut (4,2) life span 7 at turn 13, so at turn 19, if turn 19 is 6 turns after, life span 7-6=1, so available on turn 19, life span 1.\n\nEat on turn 19.\n\n(4,1) life span 5, at turn 19, 6 turns after turn 13, 5-6=-1, gone, not available.\n\n(4,1) gone on turn 18, as earlier.\n\nAt turn 13, life span 5, available turns 13 to 17, gone turn 18.\n\nTurn 19 too late.\n\nSimilarly, in the first path, if I go down first, I eat both (4,2) and (4,1) by turn 14, and (3,5) on turn 15, all within life span.\n\nIn the down-first path, I eat (4,2) on turn 13, (4,1) on turn 14, (3,5) on turn 15.\n\nAll with life span: (4,1) eaten on turn 14, life span 5, available; (4,2) on turn 13, life span 7; (3,5) on turn 15, life span 10.\n\nAll good.\n\nIn the left-first path, I eat (3,5) on turn 15, and (4,2) on turn 19 if I can, but (4,1) gone.\n\nSo I get only two foods: (3,5) and (4,2), missing (4,1).\n\nWhereas down-first I get all three.\n\nBut in down-first, after eating (4,1) on turn 14, I go to (3,1), then up to eat (3,5) on turn 15.\n\nIn the sequence I described earlier, from (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5), but on turn 15 I eat (3,5) directly if I go up.\n\nIn down-first:\n\nTurn 13: move D to (4,2) eat\n\nTurn 14: move D to (4,1) eat\n\nTurn 15: move L to (3,1) no eat\n\nNow at (3,1), to reach (3,5), I need to go to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), but (3,5) is at y=5, so from (3,1) to (3,2) on turn 16, (3,3) turn 17, (3,4) turn 18, (3,5) turn 19.\n\nBut (3,5) life span 10 at turn 13, turn 19 is 6 turns later, life span 10-6=4, still available, so I can eat on turn 19.\n\nIn this case, I eat (4,2) turn 13, (4,1) turn 14, and (3,5) turn 19, still three foods.\n\nBut in the other way, if I go to (3,5) first, I eat on turn 15, then (4,2) on turn 19, but (4,1) missed.\n\nSo down-first allows eating all three, while left-first misses (4,1).\n\nMoreover, in down-first, I get the short-life food first.\n\nNow, what about moving right? If I move right to (5,3) on turn 13, no eat, then I am away from foods, and it might take time to reach them, and (4,1) might expire.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) I need to go left and down to reach (4,2) or (4,1), but with obstacles.\n\n(5,1) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly down to (5,1).\n\nFrom (5,3) move D to (5,2), then from there, I can move L to (4,2) or R to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) has food, so if I go to (4,2), I can eat.\n\nBut let's see turns.\n\nTurn 13: move R to (5,3) no eat\n\nTurn 14: from (5,3) move D to (5,2) no eat (assuming no food)\n\nThen turn 15: from (5,2) move L to (4,2), which has food, eat.\n\nBut (4,2) eaten on turn 15, life span 7, available.\n\n(4,1) still there, life span 5, at turn 15, life span 3, available.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move D to (4,1) eat on turn 16.\n\nThen go to (3,5) later.\n\nBut to go to (3,5), from (4,1) to (3,1) then up, but (3,1) might be free.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nBut I eat (4,2) on turn 15, (4,1) on turn 16, then (3,5) say on turn 20 or so.\n\nAll within life span, since (3,5) life 10.\n\nBut I have one less food by turn 15, but overall same three foods.\n\nHowever, in down-first, I eat two foods by turn 14, while here only one by turn 15.\n\nBut since we need to maximize score, eating sooner is better for growth, but the score is the same, number of foods eaten.\n\nBut with longer snake, it might be harder to maneuver, but in this grid, there might be space.\n\nNow, back to down-first: after turn 15 at (3,1), I can go directly to (3,5) but it takes 4 moves up.\n\nBut I can consider other moves to shorten the path.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) I could move to (2,1) or something, but that might not help for (3,5).\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, let's plan the actions.\n\nAlso, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nIn down-first path, after eating (4,1) at turn 14, I am at (4,1) with limited moves, only left to (3,1), which is safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to the top.\n\nNo immediate risks.\n\nIf I go left first to (3,3), then to (3,5), I can eat on turn 15, but then I have to go down for (4,2), which takes longer.\n\nBut with the life span, (4,2) is available until turn 19, so I have time.\n\nBut (4,1) is lost.\n\nSo down-first seems better to not miss (4,1).\n\nMoreover, in down-first, I get the foods quickly.\n\nNow, another point: when I move to (4,2) on turn 13, (4,2) has food, and I eat it, but is there any danger?\n\nHead at (4,3), move to (4,2), which is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (5,5), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n\nSimilarly, when move to (4,1), tail is at (5,5) or after growth, not adjacent.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1, for several turns.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to list, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=13.\n\nSo I need to output actions for turn 13,14,15,... up to say 18 or so.\n\nBut I can list until I have a plan.\n\nSince the grid might change, but for now, with the given state.\n\nIn down-first path, I have:\n\nTurn 13: D to (4,2) eat\n\nTurn 14: D to (4,1) eat\n\nTurn 15: L to (3,1) no eat\n\nThen from (3,1), I need to go towards (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is not urgent, but I can go there.\n\nFrom (3,1), direction L (since moved left), so can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1), etc.\n\nTo go up, I should move U.\n\nTurn 16: move U to (3,2) no eat\n\nTurn 17: move U to (3,3) no eat\n\nTurn 18: move U to (3,4) no eat\n\nTurn 19: move U to (3,5) eat\n\nBut on turn 19, (3,5) is still available, life span 10-6=4 at turn 19.\n\nTurn 13 to 19 is 6 turns, life span decrease 6, from 10 to 4, available.\n\nSo eat on turn 19.\n\nBut after that, I need to think where to go.\n\nBut for now, this is a plan.\n\nI could shorten the path to (3,5).\n\nFor example, from (3,1), instead of going directly up, but I have to, since left and right might not be better.\n\nAfter turn 15 at (3,1), I could move to (2,1) or (3,2), but (3,2) is up.\n\n(2,1) is left, but (3,5) is up, so not helpful.\n\nSo going up is fine.\n\nNow, in this path, by turn 19, I have eaten three foods and grown by three.\n\nBut I can consider if I can eat (3,5) earlier, but in this case, from (3,1) it takes time.\n\nAnother idea: after eating (4,1) on turn 14, instead of moving directly left to (3,1), is there another way? No, because from (4,1) only left is possible.\n\nUnless I move differently earlier.\n\nFor example, on turn 13, if I move left first to (3,3), then I can go to (3,5) faster, but then (4,1) might be missed.\n\nBut let's see if I can get both.\n\nSuppose turn 13: move L to (3,3) no eat\n\nTurn 14: move U to (3,4) no eat\n\nTurn 15: move U to (3,5) eat, now head at (3,5)\n\nThen turn 16: move R to (4,5) no eat (if possible, but (4,5) might be body or not)\n\nAfter turn 15, positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), and previous: before move to (3,5), at turn 14: head at (3,4), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5)? Let's trace.\n\nTurn 13: start, snake (4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,5)\n\nAfter move L to (3,3): head (3,3), body (4,3),(4,4),(4,5), tail (5,5)? No: positions: head (3,3), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 14: move U to (3,4): no eat, head (3,4), seg1 to (3,3), seg2 to (4,3), seg3 to (4,4), tail to (4,5) — positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\nTurn 15: move U to (3,5) eat: head (3,5), then body (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), and tail (4,5) stays, so positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5) — 6 segments.\n\nNow turn 16: from (3,5) move to (4,5), but (4,5) is tail, so can move to it, no eat (no food), head to (4,5), direction R.\n\nThen positions: after move, head (4,5), seg1 to (3,5), seg2 to (3,4), seg3 to (3,3), seg4 to (4,3), seg5 to (4,4), tail to (4,4)? Before move: head (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter move head to (4,5) no eat: new head (4,5), seg1 to (3,5), seg2 to (3,4), seg3 to (3,3), seg4 to (4,3), tail to (4,4) — positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\nNow from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), but (4,4) is tail, so can move to it, no collision.\n\nMove D to (4,4), no eat, head to (4,4), direction D.\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), tail (4,3)\n\nThen move D to (4,3), but (4,3) is body? Positions: (4,4) head, (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) tail? Segments: head (4,4), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (3,4), seg4 (3,3), tail (4,3)\n\nSo (4,3) is tail.\n\nMove to (4,3) is possible, since tail.\n\nBut (4,3) no food, head to (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen move D to (4,2), which has food, eat on turn, say, turn 18 or later.\n\nBut (4,2) life span 7, at turn 18, life span 7-5=2, available.\n\nBut (4,1) gone.\n\nSo I miss (4,1).\n\nTherefore, to not miss (4,1), it's better to eat it early.\n\nSo down-first seems optimal.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacles, in the path I described, I didn't hit them.\n\nFor example, when at (3,1), moving up, (3,2) has obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is, but (3,2) not, so fine.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, but I'm at x=3, not near.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, I think moving down on turn 13 is best.\n\nThen for the actions:\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: L (to (3,1))\n\nThen to go to (3,5), I need to move up.\n\nBut since I need to list actions, and think 5+ turns, I can list until turn 18 or so.\n\nBut the food at (3,5) can be eaten later, but I can plan to go there.\n\nTo make it efficient, from (3,1), I can move up directly.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nNow at (3,1), direction L, so turn 16: move U to (3,2) — direction now U\n\nTurn 17: move U to (3,3) — direction U\n\nTurn 18: move U to (3,4) — direction U\n\nTurn 19: move U to (3,5) eat\n\nBut on turn 19, I eat (3,5).\n\nSince the answer format might not need all, but to show planning, I can list a few.\n\nPerhaps I can stop after turn 15 or so, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should list at least 5 actions.\n\nCurrent turn 13, so turns 13 to 17 or 18.\n\nTurn 13,14,15,16,17: 5 turns.\n\nIn turn 17, I am at (3,3) or something.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 15: at (3,1)\n\nTurn 16: move U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: move U to (3,3)\n\nEtc.\n\nBut at turn 17, I might not have eaten (3,5) yet.\n\nBut it's fine.\n\nTo eat (3,5) faster, but from (3,1) it takes 4 moves, no shortcut.\n\nAnother thing: after turn 14 at (4,1), I move left to (3,1), but is there a way to go towards (3,5) immediately? No.\n\nPerhaps on turn 13, I move down, but then on turn 14, instead of down to (4,1), I move left or right, but from (4,2), if I move left to (3,2) or right to (5,2), but (5,2) might be near obstacle.\n\nFor example, turn 13: D to (4,2) eat\n\nThen turn 14: from (4,2) I could move L to (3,2) instead of D to (4,1).\n\nBut (3,2) no food, then I can go to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut then I miss (4,1), which has short life.\n\n(4,1) life span 5, if not eaten by turn 17, gone.\n\nIf I go to (3,2) on turn 14, then to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) by turn 17 or 18, but (4,1) not eaten, and I might not reach it in time.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) to (4,1) is far, and snake long, hard to reach before turn 18.\n\nWhereas if I eat (4,1) on turn 14, I secure it.\n\nSo better to eat it.\n\nTherefore, the plan is to move down twice to eat both foods, then left, then up to eat the third food.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must think at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing eating available positive food while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's body. The current state (turn 13) has the snake at positions [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] with head direction down (D). Food is available at:\n- (4,1) with value +1 and life span 5 (disappears after turn 17)\n- (4,2) with value +1 and life span 7 (disappears after turn 19)\n- (3,5) with value +1 and life span 10 (disappears after turn 22)\n\nThe grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). The snake cannot move opposite to its current direction (no instant reverse), so from (4,3) with direction D, possible moves are D (down), L (left), or R (right).\n\n### Analysis of Options for Turn 13:\n- **Move D to (4,2)**: Eats positive food (+1, snake grows). Head moves to (4,2), direction D. Then:\n  - Turn 14: Move D to (4,1) eats another positive food (+1, snake grows). Head at (4,1), direction D.\n  - Turn 15: From (4,1), only valid move is L to (3,1) (D to (4,0) is wall, R to (5,1) is obstacle, U is reverse). No food eaten.\n  - Turn 16: From (3,1), direction L, move U to (3,2) (no food).\n  - Turn 17: From (3,2), direction U, move U to (3,3) (no food).\n  - Turn 18: From (3,3), direction U, move U to (3,4) (no food).\n  - Turn 19: From (3,4), direction U, move U to (3,5) to eat food (+1).\n  - Outcome: Eats all three foods by turn 19, securing +3 score. (4,1) is eaten on turn 14 (within life span), (4,2) on turn 13, and (3,5) on turn 19 (within life span). Minimal risk; path avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n- **Move L to (3,3)**: No food eaten. Head moves to (3,3), direction L. Then:\n  - Turn 14: Move U to (3,4) (no food).\n  - Turn 15: Move U to (3,5) eats food (+1). Head at (3,5), direction U.\n  - However, (4,1) has life span 5 and disappears after turn 17. Reaching (4,1) from (3,5) requires multiple turns (e.g., via (4,5), (4,4), etc.), but with a longer snake, it is unlikely to reach (4,1) by turn 17. (4,2) can be eaten later (e.g., turn 19), but (4,1) is missed, losing one point.\n  - Outcome: Only two foods eaten, missing (4,1). Higher risk of missing short-life food.\n- **Move R to (5,3)**: No food eaten. Head moves to (5,3), direction R. Then:\n  - Turn 14: Move D to (5,2) (no food).\n  - Turn 15: Move L to (4,2) eats food (+1). Head at (4,2), direction L.\n  - Turn 16: Move D to (4,1) eats food (+1). Head at (4,1), direction D.\n  - However, (4,1) is eaten on turn 16 (life span 5, available until turn 17). (3,5) can be eaten later, but reaching it from (4,1) takes multiple turns (e.g., to (3,1), then up), delaying the score. Eats all foods but slower than moving down first, with more turns spent navigating.\n  - Outcome: All three foods eaten, but (4,1) eaten later (turn 16 vs. turn 14 in down-first), and initial move away from food delays growth.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving D on turn 13 is optimal. It secures both (4,2) and (4,1) quickly (turns 13-14), avoiding the risk of (4,1) expiring. Then moving left and up to (3,5) by turn 19 eats all food with minimal risk. The path avoids walls, obstacles (e.g., (5,1) is avoided when moving L from (4,1)), and body collisions (e.g., moving to tail cells is safe as tail moves away). No tail reward danger issues (head not adjacent to tail during eating).\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 13-18):\n- **Turn 13: D (down)** to (4,2) – Eat food (+1), snake grows to 5 segments. Head direction D.\n- **Turn 14: D (down)** to (4,1) – Eat food (+1), snake grows to 6 segments. Head direction D.\n- **Turn 15: L (left)** to (3,1) – No food eaten. Head direction L.\n- **Turn 16: U (up)** to (3,2) – No food eaten. Head direction U.\n- **Turn 17: U (up)** to (3,3) – No food eaten. Head direction U.\n- **Turn 18: U (up)** to (3,4) – No food eaten. Head direction U. (Next, move U to (3,5) on turn 19 to eat food.)\n\nThis plan thinks 5+ turns ahead (turns 13-18), eats all available food within life spans, and prioritizes survival by avoiding risks. After turn 18, continue to (3,5) for the third food.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: D\nTurn 14: D\nTurn 15: L\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 14, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), and these borders are walls, so I can't move there.\n\nInternal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked; I can't move into them.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is down, which is D. Since it's moving down, the last move was down to (4,2).\n\nHead direction D means it's facing down, so from the previous position. Snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]. The head is at (4,2), and it's moving down, so it must have come from above. Positions are listed head first, so (4,2) is head, then body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail at (5,5).\n\nIf head is at (4,2) and direction is down, that means it moved down to (4,2) from, say, (4,1) or something. But let's see the positions: the body segments are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). (4,3) is above (4,2)? No: y-coordinates, I think y=0 is bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? I need to clarify.\n\nIn the movement, U is (x,y+1), which is up, so y increases upwards. D is (x,y-1), down, y decreases. So let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. In the movement, U: (x,y+1) — if y+1, that means higher y is up, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nConfirming: U: (x,y+1) — moving up increases y.\n\nD: (x,y-1) — moving down decreases y.\n\nL: (x-1,y) — left decreases x.\n\nR: (x+1,y) — right increases x.\n\nWalls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSnake positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). Since y=2,3,4,5, and y increases up, so (4,2) is below (4,3)? (4,3) has y=3, which is higher than y=2, so (4,3) is above (4,2). But the head is at (4,2), and body at (4,3), which is above it? That doesn't make sense for a snake moving.\n\nList: positions: index 0: head (4,2), index 1: (4,3), index 2: (4,4), index 3: (4,5), index 4: (5,5).\n\ny-coordinates: head y=2, segment 1 y=3, segment 2 y=4, segment 3 y=5, tail y=5 but x=5.\n\n(4,5) and (5,5), so tail is at (5,5).\n\nNow, head direction is D, down. That means the snake was moving down to reach (4,2). So before, head was at, say, (4,3) or something? But (4,3) is occupied by body segment 1.\n\nPerhaps the snake turned or something. Let's think about the movement.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So from the positions, at the current state, head is at (4,2), which it just moved to, from the previous head position.\n\nPrevious head position should be the current body segment 1, which is (4,3). But (4,3) is at y=3, and head is at y=2, so moving from (4,3) to (4,2) is down, since y decreased from 3 to 2, which is direction D.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So head was at (4,3) before, moved down to (4,2). Then body segments: segment 1 was at (4,4) or something? Let's trace.\n\nBefore move: head at (4,3), then after move down, head to (4,2), segment 1 moves to where head was, (4,3), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, which was (4,4)? Current positions after move: head (4,2), segment 1 at (4,3) which was previous head, segment 2 at (4,4) which was previous segment 1, segment 3 at (4,5) previous segment 2, and tail at (5,5) previous segment 3.\n\nBut segment 3 is at (4,5), and tail at (5,5), so before move, segment 3 was at (4,5), and tail was at some position that moved to (5,5). Since tail is at (5,5), and it moved from the previous tail position.\n\nThe positions are given after the move, I think. For turn 14, this is the state after the move to (4,2).\n\nHead direction D indicates the last move was down.\n\nFood:\n\nFood positions: (4,1,4,1) — I think this is (x,y, life_span, value) or what? Let's see the input format.\n\n\"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (4,1,4,1) - (3,5,9,1)\"\n\nIt says: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) but here it's written as (4,1,4,1) which might be (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? I need to check.\n\nIn the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4,1,4,1)\" but it says \"Life Span and Value\", but in the tuple it's (4,1,4,1), which has four numbers, but it should be (x,y), value, life_span or something.\n\nLook back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the current state, it's written as \"- (4,1,4,1)\" which is not clear. Probably it's a tuple of (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? The text says \"Value and Life Span\" but the tuple has four elements.\n\nPerhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value). Let's see the values: for (4,1,4,1) , if life_span=4, value=1, and for (3,5,9,1), life_span=9, value=1.\n\nValue=1 for both, so positive food, since +1.\n\nSimilarly, life_span: for first, 4 turns left, second 9 turns left.\n\nAlso, food can be under snake body, but only eaten when head moves there after body moves away.\n\nNow, current turn t1=14.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score with long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions: head (4,2), body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nSo let's list occupied cells:\n\n- (4,2): head\n\n- (4,3): body\n\n- (4,4): body\n\n- (4,5): body\n\n- (5,5): tail\n\nFood at:\n\n- (4,1): value 1, life_span 4 (so disappears after 4 turns, including current? Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 14, life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 17? Let's clarify life-span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span = L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and disappears when countdown reaches 0. So if at turn t, life_span = L, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at the start of turn t+L? Or after turn t+L-1?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — at turn t, with life_span N, it means after this turn, it has N-1 turns left? But it says \"including current\", so at turn t, the countdown is N, and it decreases during turn t, so after turn t, it has N-1 left? The phrasing is a bit ambiguous.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" — meaning it lasts for N turns from now.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so at the beginning of turn t, if life_span is N, then during turn t, the countdown decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and it disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life_span N, it is present for turn t. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1. If N-1 >0, it is still present for turn t+1, etc. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning of next?\n\nTypically, it disappears when countdown reaches 0, so at turn t + N -1, it is present, and after that turn, countdown 0, disappears before turn t+N.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves to food during a turn, it is eaten at that turn, even if life_span was 1, I think.\n\nIn this case, for food at (4,1): at turn 14, life_span=4, so countdown=4. After turn 14, it becomes 3, and so on. It will disappear after turn 17, meaning before turn 18? Let's define.\n\nAssume that at the start of turn t, food with life_span L is present. During the turn, if head moves to it, it is eaten. At the end of the turn, life_span decreases by 1. If life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nSo for (4,1): at turn 14, life_span=4, so present for turns 14,15,16,17. Disappears before turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5): life_span=9, present for many turns.\n\nBoth foods have value +1, so positive food.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,2), direction down (D).\n\nPossible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot instant reverse. Since last move was D (down), I cannot move U (up) immediately, because that would be reverse.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so I cannot move U, because that is opposite to current direction.\n\nAllowed moves: since moving down, I can move D, L, or R, but not U.\n\nDirections: from (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- U (up): to (4,3) — but (4,3) is occupied by body segment, so collision, death.\n\n- D (down): to (4,1) — (4,1) has food? And it's within grid.\n\n- L (left): to (3,2) — is this free?\n\n- R (right): to (5,2) — is this free?\n\nFirst, check walls and obstacles.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\n(4,1): y=1, not wall, x=4 not wall.\n\nBut is there obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1) is an obstacle, but (4,1) is not listed, so should be free, except for food.\n\n(4,1) has food, so it's not wall or obstacle.\n\nBut moving to (4,1): it has food, and it's not occupied by snake body except possibly tail, but tail is at (5,5), far.\n\nSnake body: positions (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). (4,1) is not occupied, so moving there should be safe, as long as no wall or obstacle.\n\n(4,1) is not wall, not obstacle, so D to (4,1) is possible.\n\nL to (3,2): (3,2) — x=3,y=2, not border wall, not in obstacles list: obstacles (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (3,2) not there, so free.\n\nR to (5,2): (5,2) — x=5,y=2, not border, obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,2) is different, so should be free? (5,2) not listed, so free.\n\nU to (4,3): but (4,3) is occupied by body segment, so if I move there, head collides with body, death. So invalid move.\n\nAlso, cannot move U because it's reverse, but even if not, it's occupied.\n\nSo possible actions: D, L, R.\n\nNow, D to (4,1): has food, so if I move there, I eat the food. Value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves and risks.\n\nAlso, there is a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,5), head at (4,2), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so |dx| + |dy| =1.\n\n(4,2) to (5,5): dx=1, dy=3, not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nNow, food at (4,1) has life_span 4, so I have until turn 17 to eat it, but it's right below, I can eat it now.\n\nBut I should consider if it's safe.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid state.\n\nList all occupied and dangerous cells.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nFood: (4,1) and (3,5)\n\n(3,5) has food, value 1, life_span 9.\n\nNow, possible moves from current:\n\nAction D: to (4,1), eat food. Then snake grows to 6 segments. New head at (4,1), new body: head moved to (4,1), so previous head (4,2) becomes new segment 1, then (4,3) segment 2, (4,4) segment 3, (4,5) segment 4, (5,5) segment 5, and new tail at (5,5)? When snake eats, it grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so segments: new head at (4,1), then the previous positions: the body remains, but tail stays, so snake positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). So tail is still at (5,5), and length 6.\n\nThen head direction becomes D, since I moved down.\n\nAction L: to (3,2). No food, so snake moves, head to (3,2), body: (4,2) becomes segment 1, (4,3) segment 2, (4,4) segment 3, (4,5) segment 4, and tail moves to where segment 4 was? Positions: after move, head at (3,2), segment 1 at previous head (4,2), segment 2 at previous seg1 (4,3), segment 3 at previous seg2 (4,4), segment 4 at previous seg3 (4,5), and tail at previous seg4 (5,5)? Seg4 was (4,5), so tail moves to (4,5)? Let's think.\n\nStandard snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of the previous segment.\n\nSo before move: positions: head (4,2), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nAfter move left to (3,2): head to (3,2), then seg1 moves to (4,2) (previous head), seg2 moves to (4,3) (previous seg1), seg3 moves to (4,4) (previous seg2), tail moves to (4,5) (previous seg3). Previous seg3 was (4,5), so tail to (4,5). But (4,5) was occupied by seg3, but it moves, so now empty except for tail.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), tail (4,5). Previous tail was at (5,5), which is now empty.\n\nSimilarly, action R to (5,2): head to (5,2), seg1 to (4,2), seg2 to (4,3), seg3 to (4,4), tail to (4,5)? Previous seg3 was (4,5), so tail to (4,5). (5,5) is freed.\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2, which is not wall, not obstacle, but (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,2) is fine.\n\nNow, for action D to (4,1): I eat food, so head to (4,1), and body: seg1 at (4,2), seg2 at (4,3), seg3 at (4,4), seg4 at (4,5), tail at (5,5) remains, since growth. So positions: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — length 6.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score, so I should eat positive food when possible, but avoid risks.\n\nAlso, plan for the future.\n\nThere is another food at (3,5), with long life, so I can eat it later.\n\nFirst, if I eat the food at (4,1) now, I get +1, but the snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver in this area.\n\nLet's see the grid around.\n\nThe snake is mostly vertical from (4,1) to (4,5) if I eat, except tail at (5,5).\n\nBut tail at (5,5), which is east of (4,5).\n\nNow, after eating at (4,1), head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves from there: cannot move U (up) because reverse of D? Last move was D to (4,1), so direction is D, so cannot move U.\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nD to (4,0): but y=0 is wall, so death. Cannot move D.\n\nL to (3,1): (3,1) — is it free? x=3,y=1, not border wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), etc, (3,1) not listed, so should be free. But is there food? No, food at (4,1) and (3,5), so (3,1) empty.\n\nR to (5,1): (5,1) is obstacle! Internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nSo from (4,1) after eating, possible moves: L to (3,1) or R to (5,1) but (5,1) is obstacle, so only L to (3,1) possible? And D to (4,0) wall, U not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (3,1).\n\nThen head moves to (3,1), no food, so snake moves, head to (3,1), seg1 to (4,1), seg2 to (4,2), seg3 to (4,3), seg4 to (4,4), tail to (4,5)? Positions: after move from (4,1) to (3,1), no eat, so head (3,1), seg1 (4,1), seg2 (4,2), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,4), tail (4,5)? Previous tail was (5,5), which moves to previous seg4 position.\n\nAfter eating at turn t, positions: head (4,1), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nNow move to (3,1): head to (3,1), no eat, so seg1 moves to (4,1) (previous head), seg2 to (4,2) (previous seg1), seg3 to (4,3) (previous seg2), seg4 to (4,4) (previous seg3), tail to (4,5) (previous seg4). Previous seg4 was (4,5), so tail to (4,5). (5,5) is freed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nHead direction now L.\n\nThen from (3,1), possible moves: cannot move R (right) because reverse of L? Last move was L to (3,1), so direction L, cannot move R.\n\nCan move U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,2): (3,2) is free? Not occupied, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nD to (3,0): y=0 wall, death.\n\nL to (2,1): (2,1) — x=2,y=1, not border, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,1) not listed, so free.\n\nBut (2,1) might be free, but let's see.\n\nAlso, (1,2) is obstacle, but different cell.\n\nSo from (3,1), can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n\nD to (3,0) invalid.\n\nNow, this seems a bit constrained. After eating at (4,1), I'm forced to move left to (3,1), then I have choices, but the area is tight.\n\nIf I don't eat now, I can go elsewhere.\n\nFor example, from current position (4,2), I can move L to (3,2) or R to (5,2).\n\nOr D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nBut if I eat, I grow, and then I'm at (4,1) with only one way out, to (3,1), which might lead to dead end or something.\n\nLet's see the grid around (3,1).\n\n(3,1): to U (3,2), which is free.\n\nTo L (2,1), free.\n\nBut (2,1) is near obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, (2,4) obstacle, but (2,1) ok.\n\nFrom (2,1), can move to (2,2), (1,1), (2,0) but y=0 wall, so (2,0) invalid.\n\n(1,1) x=1,y=1, not border, not obstacle, should be free.\n\n(2,2) similarly.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so from (2,1), moving to (1,1) or (2,2) or U to (2,2)? Moves from (2,1): U (2,2), D (2,0) invalid, L (1,1), R (3,1) but reverse not allowed if last move was L.\n\nIt might be messy.\n\nPerhaps better to avoid eating at (4,1) now because it might trap me.\n\nBut the food has life_span 4, so I can eat it later, but where can I go?\n\nFrom current (4,2), I can move L or R instead of D.\n\nLet's consider moving L to (3,2).\n\nFrom (4,2) move L to (3,2): no food, so snake moves to: head (3,2), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), tail (4,5)? Previous tail (5,5) moves to (4,5).\n\nPositions: head (3,2), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen from (3,2), possible moves: cannot move R (reverse), can move U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,3): (3,3) free? Not occupied, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nD to (3,1): (3,1) free, as before.\n\nL to (2,2): (2,2) free? Obstacles, (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\nAlso, food at (3,5) is above, but not close.\n\nI can go towards (3,5) to eat it.\n\n(3,5) has food, value 1.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut need to check if possible.\n\nFirst, from (3,2) move U to (3,3): no food, head to (3,3), seg1 to (3,2), seg2 to (4,2), seg3 to (4,3), tail to (4,4)? Previous tail at (4,5) moves to (4,4).\n\nPositions: head (3,3), seg1 (3,2), seg2 (4,2), seg3 (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nThen from (3,3), can move U, D, L, R, but last move was U, so cannot move D (reverse).\n\nCan move U to (3,4), L to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) has body seg3? Current positions: seg3 at (4,3), so (4,3) occupied, cannot move there.\n\nR to (4,3) invalid.\n\nU to (3,4): (3,4) free? Not occupied, not wall, obstacle (2,4) is there, but (3,4) not obstacle.\n\nL to (2,3): (2,3) free.\n\nSo move U to (3,4): head to (3,4), no food, seg1 to (3,3), seg2 to (3,2), seg3 to (4,2), tail to (4,3)? Previous tail at (4,4) moves to (4,3).\n\nPositions: head (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (4,2), tail (4,3)\n\nThen from (3,4), move U to (3,5): (3,5) has food! So eat it.\n\nHead to (3,5), eat food, grow, so head (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (4,2), tail (4,3) remains? After eat, tail doesn't move.\n\nPositions before move: head (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (4,2), tail (4,3)\n\nMove to (3,5) with eat: head to (3,5), then seg1 to (3,4), seg2 to (3,3), seg3 to (3,2), seg4 to (4,2), tail stays at (4,3), so new tail segment, positions: head (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (4,2), tail (4,3) — length 6.\n\nThen I have eaten the food at (3,5).\n\nAnd head at (3,5), last move U.\n\nNow, back to the food at (4,1), it is still there, life_span decreases.\n\nBut I need to think if this is better.\n\nFrom current, I could move R to (5,2).\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, consider the risks.\n\nAnother thing: food at (4,1) might be under snake body? Currently, snake is at (4,2) to (4,5), and (4,1) is below, not under body. But if I don't eat it, and the snake moves, it might be covered or something.\n\nBut in this case, (4,1) is not under body now.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under body, but here it's not.\n\nNow, for long-term, I should eat both foods if possible.\n\nBut (4,1) has short life, only 4 turns, so I need to eat it soon.\n\nTurn 14, life_span 4, so must eat by turn 17.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I might not have another chance.\n\nFor example, if I move away, I can come back, but the snake is in the way.\n\nFrom current, if I move L to (3,2), as above, I can go to (3,5) in a few moves, but then (4,1) might expire or be hard to reach.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (5,2).\n\nLet's consider moving R.\n\nFrom (4,2) move R to (5,2): no food, head to (5,2), seg1 to (4,2), seg2 to (4,3), seg3 to (4,4), tail to (4,5)? Previous tail (5,5) to (4,5).\n\nPositions: head (5,2), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen from (5,2), possible moves: cannot move L (reverse), can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (5,3): (5,3) free? Not occupied, not wall, obstacle (5,1) but (5,3) ok.\n\nD to (5,1): but (5,1) is obstacle! Cannot move there.\n\nR to (6,2): (6,2) free? x=6,y=2, not border, obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), (6,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut (6,1) is obstacle, (6,2) is different.\n\nSo can move U to (5,3) or R to (6,2).\n\nD to (5,1) invalid.\n\nIf I move U to (5,3), etc., but I might go away from (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at bottom, and I'm at (5,2), so to reach (4,1), I need to go down and left, but it might be blocked.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), move U to (5,3), then I can go to (5,4), but (5,4) might be free, but there is obstacle at (6,4), not (5,4).\n\n(5,4) free.\n\nBut to go down to (4,1), I need to go back down.\n\nBut from (5,3), if I move D to (5,2), but (5,2) is now body seg1? After moving to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), seg1 (5,2), etc., so (5,2) occupied, cannot move back immediately.\n\nAlso, last move U, cannot move D.\n\nSo hard to go down.\n\nMove R to (6,2), then from there, I can go U or R, but x=7 wall, R to (7,2) invalid, so U to (6,3) or D to (6,1) but (6,1) obstacle, so only U to (6,3).\n\nThen similarly, I might go up, away from (4,1).\n\nSo if I move right, I might not be able to eat (4,1) in time.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (3,2), I can eat (3,5) but (4,1) might expire.\n\nBut (4,1) life_span 4, at turn 14, so if I eat (3,5) first, it takes a few turns.\n\nFrom current turn 14:\n\nIf I move L to (3,2) at turn 14.\n\nTurn 14: move L to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 15: from (3,2), move U to (3,3) as above\n\nTurn 16: from (3,3), move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 17: from (3,4), move U to (3,5) and eat.\n\nAt turn 17, I eat (3,5), and (4,1) life_span: at turn 14, life=4, turn 15: life=3, turn 16: life=2, turn 17: life=1, so at turn 17, it is still present, I can eat it if I go there.\n\nBut at turn 17, I am at (3,5) after eating, head at (3,5), with body below.\n\nPositions after eating (3,5) at turn 17: head (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (4,2), tail (4,3)\n\nFrom here, I need to go to (4,1) to eat the food.\n\nBut (4,1) is at (4,1), I am at (3,5).\n\nTo go to (4,1), I need to move down and right.\n\nFrom (3,5), last move U, so cannot move D.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R, but D not allowed.\n\nU to (3,6): y=6, not wall, free? But y=7 top, so (3,6) ok.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) free? Obstacle (2,4), but (2,5) not, so free.\n\nR to (4,5): (4,5) — is it free? Current positions: tail at (4,3), and seg4 at (4,2), but (4,5) not occupied, but let's see the positions.\n\nHead (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (4,2), tail (4,3)\n\nSo (4,5) is empty.\n\nBut (4,5) was previously occupied, but now free.\n\nR to (4,5): (4,5) free, no food.\n\nIf I move R to (4,5), then head to (4,5), no eat, so snake moves: head (4,5), seg1 to (3,5), seg2 to (3,4), seg3 to (3,3), seg4 to (3,2), tail to (4,2)? Previous tail (4,3) moves to (4,2), but (4,2) is where seg4 was, so tail to (4,2).\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (3,3), seg4 (3,2), tail (4,2)\n\nHead at (4,5), last move R.\n\nThen from here, I can move D to (4,4), but (4,4) is not occupied? Current positions: (4,5) head, (3,5) seg1, (3,4) seg2, (3,3) seg3, (3,2) seg4, (4,2) tail.\n\nSo (4,4) is empty.\n\nMove D to (4,4): down to (4,4), no food, head to (4,4), seg1 to (4,5), seg2 to (3,5), seg3 to (3,4), seg4 to (3,3), tail to (3,2)? Previous tail (4,2) moves to (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is where seg4 was? Positions: head (4,4), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (3,4), seg4 (3,3), tail (3,2)\n\nThen move D to (4,3), but (4,3) is not occupied? Current: (4,4) head, etc, (4,3) empty.\n\nMove D to (4,3): head to (4,3), no food, etc.\n\nThen to (4,2), but (4,2) is tail? At some point, (4,2) is tail, but when I move to it, it might be ok if tail moves.\n\nTo reach (4,1), from (4,4), move D to (4,3), then D to (4,2), but at (4,2), it is tail, so when head moves to (4,2), the tail will have moved, so it should be safe, as long as no other body.\n\nFor example, from above position at (4,4), move D to (4,3): head to (4,3), seg1 to (4,4), seg2 to (4,5), etc., tail to (3,2) or something.\n\nThen from (4,3), move D to (4,2): if (4,2) is the position where tail is, but when head moves to (4,2), the tail is at (3,2) or wherever, and moves away, so (4,2) is free when head arrives, so it should be safe.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 17, (4,1) is still present, life_span 1 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17, if I am at (4,2) and move to (4,1), I can eat.\n\nBut in the sequence, from turn 17 position after eating (3,5), I am at (3,5), then I need to go to (4,5) or something, then down to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), then (4,1).\n\nThat takes multiple turns.\n\nTurn 17: I am at (3,5) after eating (3,5).\n\nTo go to (4,1):\n\nTurn 17: move R to (4,5) — as above, to (4,5)\n\nTurn 18: from (4,5) move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 19: from (4,4) move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 20: from (4,3) move D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 21: from (4,2) move D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nBut (4,1) life_span: at turn 14, life=4\n\nTurn 15: after turn, life=3\n\nTurn 16: life=2\n\nTurn 17: life=1, so present during turn 17, can be eaten.\n\nAfter turn 17, life=0, disappears.\n\nSo at turn 17, if head moves to (4,1) during turn 17, it can be eaten.\n\nBut in my sequence, at turn 17, I am moving from (3,5) to (4,5), not to (4,1). I only reach (4,1) at turn 21, which is too late; it disappeared before turn 18.\n\nAt turn 17, life=1, so it is present for turn 17. After turn 17, it disappears before turn 18.\n\nSo to eat it, I must move to (4,1) during turn 17 or earlier.\n\nTurn 17 is the last chance.\n\nAt turn 17, if I am at a position where I can move to (4,1), I can eat it.\n\nIn the sequence where I go to eat (3,5) first, at turn 17 I am at (3,5) after moving to it and eating.\n\nFrom (3,5), can I move directly to (4,1)? No, not adjacent.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5): U, D, L, R, but last move U, so cannot D.\n\nU to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\nNone is (4,1), so I cannot reach (4,1) in one move from (3,5).\n\nThe closest I can get is to move R to (4,5) at turn 17, but (4,5) to (4,1) is 4 steps down, and at turn 17, I can only do one move, so I can't reach (4,1) at turn 17.\n\nTherefore, if I don't eat (4,1) by turn 17, I lose it.\n\nAt turn 17, I must have head at (4,1) to eat it.\n\nSo I need to be at (4,0), (4,2), (3,1), or (5,1) at turn 16, to move to (4,1) at turn 17.\n\nBut (4,0) is wall, (5,1) is obstacle, so only from (4,2) or (3,1) or (5,1) invalid, so from (4,2) down to (4,1), or from (3,1) right to (4,1), or from (5,1) but (5,1) obstacle, so only (4,2) or (3,1).\n\n(4,2) or (3,1).\n\nNow, at turn 16, if I am at (4,2), I can move D to (4,1) at turn 17.\n\nSimilarly, at (3,1), move R to (4,1).\n\nBut (3,1) to (4,1) is right, which may be allowed.\n\nBack to current turn 14.\n\nIf I want to eat (4,1) at turn 17, I need to be at (4,2) or (3,1) at turn 16.\n\nBut at turn 14, I am at (4,2).\n\nIf I stay or move, I need to be back at (4,2) or to (3,1) by turn 16.\n\nBut from (4,2), if I move away, it might be hard to come back because of the snake body.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (3,2) at turn 14, then at turn 15, I can move to (3,1) or other.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move D to (3,1) at turn 15.\n\nThen at turn 15, head at (3,1), then turn 16, from (3,1), I can move to (3,2) or (2,1) or (4,1) if possible, but last move D? From (3,2) to (3,1) is move D, so direction D.\n\nThen from (3,1), cannot move U (reverse), can move D, L, R.\n\nD to (3,0) invalid, L to (2,1), R to (4,1).\n\nR to (4,1) is possible, and (4,1) has food, so at turn 16, I can move to (4,1) and eat it.\n\nTurn 16: move to (4,1) and eat.\n\nBut life_span: at turn 14, life=4, turn 15: life=3, turn 16: life=2, so present, can eat at turn 16.\n\nYes.\n\nIn this case, I can eat at turn 16.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 14: move L to (3,2) from current (4,2)\n\nThen positions: head (3,2), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), tail (4,5) — as before.\n\nTurn 15: from (3,2) move D to (3,1) — (3,1) free, no food.\n\nHead to (3,1), no eat, so seg1 to (3,2), seg2 to (4,2), seg3 to (4,3), tail to (4,4)? Previous tail (4,5) to (4,4).\n\nPositions: head (3,1), seg1 (3,2), seg2 (4,2), seg3 (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nLast move D.\n\nTurn 16: from (3,1), move R to (4,1) — (4,1) has food, so eat.\n\nHead to (4,1), eat, grow, so seg1 to (3,1), seg2 to (3,2), seg3 to (4,2), seg4 to (4,3), tail stays at (4,4), so positions: head (4,1), seg1 (3,1), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (4,3), tail (4,4) — length 6.\n\nAnd I ate the food at turn 16.\n\nThen I can later go to eat (3,5).\n\nAt turn 16, head at (4,1), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen similar to before, from (4,1), I can only move left to (3,1) or other, but (3,1) is now seg1, occupied.\n\nPositions: head (4,1), seg1 (3,1), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nSo (3,1) occupied by seg1, (5,1) obstacle, (4,0) wall, so only possible move is U? But last move was R to (4,1), so direction R, cannot move L (reverse).\n\nCan move U, D, R.\n\nD to (4,0) invalid.\n\nR to (5,1) obstacle, invalid.\n\nU to (4,2): but (4,2) is occupied by seg3! seg3 at (4,2), so collision.\n\nU to (4,2) is invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) but (3,1) occupied by seg1, invalid.\n\nSo no possible moves! Stuck, death.\n\nOh no! After eating at (4,1) and having the body around, I have no safe move.\n\nSpecifically, from (4,1), surrounded: up (4,2) occupied, down wall, left (3,1) occupied, right obstacle. So dead end.\n\nTherefore, eating (4,1) when the snake is positioned this way leads to death later.\n\nIn the first option, if I eat at turn 14 directly, I also had to move left to (3,1) and then could go up, but with growth, it might be tight.\n\nIn direct eat at turn 14:\n\nTurn 14: move D to (4,1), eat, positions: head (4,1), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nThen turn 15: only possible move L to (3,1), no eat, so head to (3,1), seg1 to (4,1), seg2 to (4,2), seg3 to (4,3), seg4 to (4,4), tail to (4,5)? Previous tail (5,5) to (4,5).\n\nPositions: head (3,1), seg1 (4,1), seg2 (4,2), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\nLast move L.\n\nThen from (3,1), can move U, D, L (cannot R reverse).\n\nD to (3,0) invalid.\n\nL to (2,1): free, as before.\n\nU to (3,2): free.\n\nSo I can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n\nFor example, move U to (3,2): head to (3,2), no eat, seg1 to (3,1), seg2 to (4,1), seg3 to (4,2), seg4 to (4,3), tail to (4,4)\n\nThen I can continue to (3,3), etc., to eat (3,5).\n\nBut in this case, I survived, and I can eat (3,5) later.\n\nIn the other sequence where I ate at turn 16 from (3,1), I got stuck.\n\nSo eating directly at turn 14 is better because I can escape to (3,1) and then up.\n\nWhereas if I delay, I might not have space.\n\nBut in the direct eat, after moving to (3,1) at turn 15, I have options.\n\nNow, if I don't eat (4,1) at all, I can avoid the area and go for (3,5).\n\nFor example, from current (4,2), move L to (3,2) at turn 14.\n\nThen turn 15: move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 16: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 17: move U to (3,5) and eat (3,5).\n\nThen I have +1, and (4,1) disappears unused.\n\nThen I can continue from (3,5).\n\nBut I missed the +1 from (4,1), but survived.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat both if possible.\n\nBut from above, if I eat (4,1) directly at turn 14, I can survive and later eat (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat (4,1), I eat only one.\n\nBut with eating (4,1), I have a longer snake, which might be riskier, but in this case, after escaping, it might be ok.\n\nNow, another option: from current (4,2), move R to (5,2).\n\nThen I might not eat (4,1), but go elsewhere.\n\nBut (4,1) will expire, so I lose that food.\n\nSince both foods are +1, eating one is better than none, but eating two is best.\n\nBut with the risk.\n\nIn the direct eat, I can survive.\n\nLet's confirm the grid after direct eat.\n\nTurn 14: move D to (4,1), eat. Snake: head (4,1), body (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5) — length 6.\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 15: move L to (3,1) — only choice, as before. No eat, so head to (3,1), seg1 to (4,1), seg2 to (4,2), seg3 to (4,3), seg4 to (4,4), tail to (4,5) — since previous tail (5,5) moves to (4,5).\n\nPositions: head (3,1), seg1 (4,1), seg2 (4,2), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,4), tail (4,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 16: from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n\n(3,2) is free, (2,1) free.\n\nSay I move U to (3,2): no food, head to (3,2), seg1 to (3,1), seg2 to (4,1), seg3 to (4,2), seg4 to (4,3), tail to (4,4)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 17: from (3,2), move U to (3,3): free, head to (3,3), seg1 to (3,2), seg2 to (3,1), seg3 to (4,1), seg4 to (4,2), tail to (4,3)\n\nAnd so on, I can go to (3,4), (3,5) to eat the other food.\n\nAt (3,5), I can eat at some point.\n\nNo immediate risk.\n\nIf I had moved to (2,1) at turn 16, it might be similar.\n\nSo this seems feasible.\n\nIf I don't eat (4,1), I can still eat (3,5) with a shorter snake, but I miss one point.\n\nSince the food is positive, and I can eat both, eating both is better.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: not applicable here.\n\nAlso, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 14.\n\nPlan: turn 14: move D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nThen turn 15: move L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 16: move U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 18: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: move U to (3,5) and eat.\n\nBut at turn 19, (3,5) is still there, life_span 9 at turn 14, so many turns left.\n\nI can eat earlier if I go directly.\n\nFrom turn 16 position: after turn 15 at (3,1), turn 16 move U to (3,2), then at turn 17, from (3,2) I can move U to (3,3), turn 18 to (3,4), turn 19 to (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,2) at turn 17, I could move directly to (3,5)? No, not adjacent.\n\nBut I can move faster? From (3,2) at turn 17, move U to (3,3), then turn 18 move U to (3,4), turn 19 move U to (3,5). Three moves.\n\nSince last move U, I can only move U, L, R, not D, but (3,5) is up, so fine.\n\nIn the sequence, I eat at turn 19.\n\nBut I have eaten one food at turn 14, and will eat another at turn 19.\n\nIf I don't eat (4,1), I eat only at turn 17 or so.\n\nBut with eating both, score +2.\n\nNow, another thing: after eating (3,5), I need to survive, but the grid has space.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), I can go right or up, etc.\n\nSo I think it's better to eat (4,1) now.\n\nBut in the beginning, when I move to (4,1), is there any risk?\n\nAt turn 14, moving to (4,1), it is free, no collision.\n\nAnd no tail adjacent issue.\n\nSo should be safe.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (4,1) later, but as we saw, it's risky or impossible.\n\nTherefore, best to eat it now.\n\nSo for turn 14, action D.\n\nThen the next actions as above.\n\nBut the answer format is to list actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=14.\n\nSo I need to output actions for turn 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, etc., but at least 5 turns.\n\nTurn 14 to turn 18 or more.\n\nNow, from above:\n\nTurn 14: D (to eat (4,1))\n\nTurn 15: L (to (3,1))\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move U or L.\n\nTo go towards (3,5), better to move U.\n\nTurn 16: U (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 17: U (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 18: U (to (3,4))\n\nThen turn 19: U to (3,5) to eat, but that's beyond.\n\nFor 5 turns: turn 14 to 18.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAt turn 18, I am at (3,4), for example.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut in turn 18, I move U to (3,4), not yet eat (3,5).\n\nBut I can plan to eat it later.\n\nSince the food has long life, it's fine.\n\nTo be efficient, from (3,1) at turn 15, I could move directly, but no.\n\nAnother idea: after eating (4,1) and moving to (3,1), at turn 15, instead of moving U, I could move L to (2,1), but that might not help for (3,5).\n\nBetter to go up.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, about the reverse move: when I move from (4,1) to (3,1), last move was L, so from (3,1), I cannot move R, but I don't need to.\n\nSimilarly, moving U multiple times is fine.\n\nAlso, check if at any point I hit wall or body.\n\nFor example, at turn 16, move U to (3,2), from (3,1), (3,2) should be free, as per earlier.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut at turn 18, I move to (3,4), and (3,5) is there, so turn 19 I can eat, but not in the 5 turns.\n\nThe answer should include at least the next 5 actions, I think.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output actions starting from current turn.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nFor at least 5 turns? It doesn't specify how many to output, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output actions for several turns.\n\nPerhaps output 5 actions: turn 14 to 18.\n\nThen I can stop.\n\nTo be complete, I can output until I eat the second food, but not necessary.\n\nSince the grid might change, but no new food mentioned.\n\nSo for now.\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 18 U to (3,4), then I need to move to (3,5).\n\nBut in the actions, I can just list up to turn 18.\n\nPerhaps I can adjust to eat (3,5) earlier, but from start, it takes time.\n\nWithout eating (4,1), I can eat (3,5) by turn 17.\n\nBut I miss one food.\n\nWith eating both, I eat first at 14, second at 19.\n\nBut score is same, +1 at 14 and +1 at 19 vs +1 at 17, but earlier score might be better? No, total score is the same, number of foods eaten.\n\nBut since no discount, total score matters, so +2 better than +1.\n\nAnd survival is key.\n\nIn the no-eat-now option, I survive with one food; in eat-now, I survive with two.\n\nSo better to eat now.\n\nThus, action for turn 14: D.\n\nThen for the answer.\n\nAlso, need to specify the actions.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nSo for turn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: L (to (3,1))\n\nTurn 16: U (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 17: U (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 18: U (to (3,4))\n\nThen I can add turn 19: U to (3,5) to eat, but not necessary.\n\nSince the format might expect only a few, but I think 5 actions are fine.\n\nTo think ahead, I should consider if there are risks in this path.\n\nFor example, at (3,4), moving to (3,5), it should be fine.\n\nInternal obstacles: (2,4) is at (2,4), which is left of (3,4), but not in the way.\n\n(3,5) is free.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I think this is a good plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive food items while ensuring long-term survival, the plan involves eating the food at (4,1) immediately on turn 14 to avoid missing it due to its short life span (life_span=4, disappears after turn 17). After eating, the snake grows, and subsequent moves navigate towards the second food at (3,5) with a long life span (life_span=9), ensuring it can be eaten later. The path avoids collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body by moving left to (3,1) on turn 15 and then upwards towards (3,5). Thinking 5+ turns ahead, this sequence prioritizes survival by escaping the tight area near (4,1) quickly and leveraging the open space to reach (3,5) safely.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Turn 14 (Current State)**: Move down (D) to (4,1) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases to 6). This is safe as (4,1) is not occupied by the body, and no tail reward danger exists (tail is at (5,5), not adjacent).\n- **Turn 15**: Move left (L) to (3,1) to escape the potential dead end at (4,1). No reverse move issue (last move was D, so L is allowed).\n- **Turn 16**: Move up (U) to (3,2) to start ascending towards (3,5). The path is clear of obstacles and body segments.\n- **Turn 17**: Move up (U) to (3,3). Continue towards (3,5); no food eaten yet, but (3,5) has a long life span.\n- **Turn 18**: Move up (U) to (3,4). Position for eating (3,5) on turn 19 (beyond the 5-turn plan, but the sequence ensures it is reachable).\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Eating (4,1) on Turn 14 is Critical**: With life_span=4 at turn 14, it disappears after turn 17. Delaying risks missing it, as alternative paths (e.g., moving left or right first) cannot reach (4,1) by turn 17 without causing a dead end or collision.\n- **Survival Focus**: After eating (4,1), moving left to (3,1) on turn 15 avoids the trapped state (only L is possible from (4,1), and it opens a path upwards. The upwards moves (turns 16–18) are safe, with no obstacles or body collisions.\n- **Long-Term Score**: Eating (4,1) immediately secures +1, and the path to (3,5) allows another +1 by turn 19. Skipping (4,1) would mean only +1 from (3,5), reducing the score.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: The sequence adheres to movement constraints (no instant reverse) and avoids walls/obstacles. For example:\n  - Turn 14: D is valid (not reverse; last direction was D, so D, L, R allowed; U would cause body collision at (4,3)).\n  - Turn 15: L is valid (last move D, so not reverse; (3,1) is free).\n  - Turns 16–18: U moves are valid (last move L on turn 15, so U allowed; no body or obstacles at (3,2), (3,3), or (3,4)).\n- **5+ Turns Ahead**: By turn 18, the snake is at (3,4), poised to eat (3,5) on turn 19. The grid has space for further movement (e.g., after turn 19, move right or up to avoid walls).\n\n### Answer Format:\nThe actions for turns 14 to 18 are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: D \\\\\nTurn 15: L \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U\n}",

It's turn 15, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n\nWalls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is bounded by these. Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I must avoid these cells.\n\nSnake positions: Head at (4,1), then body segments at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake has 6 segments. Head is at (4,1), and it's moving down (since head direction is D). Moving down means increasing y, I think? Let me confirm the coordinate system.\n\nThe movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1)? That seems inconsistent. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"U`(x,y+1)`\" — so U increases y, meaning y-axis points up? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but sometimes it's down. I need to clarify.\n\nIn the movement constraints: \"U`(x,y+1)`\" — so if U is up, that means y increases as you go up, which is standard.\n\nD is \"D`(x,y-1)`\" — so down decreases y.\n\nL is \"L`(x-1,y)`\" — left decreases x.\n\nR is \"R`(x+1,y)`\" — right increases x.\n\nSo, in this coordinate system, (0,0) is bottom-left? Or top-left? Walls: x=0 is left wall, x=7 is right wall, y=0 is bottom? y=7 is top? Let's see.\n\nThe grid has walls at y=0 and y=7. Since D is (x,y-1), moving down decreases y, so y=0 is the bottom row, and y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSnake head at (4,1), which is x=4, y=1. Moving down, so from (4,1) down to (4,0)? But y=1 down to y=0, but y=0 is a wall, so moving down from (4,1) to (4,0) would hit the wall, which is deadly.\n\nCurrent head position is (4,1), direction D (down), so last move was down to (4,1). Now, possible moves: I can't move opposite to current direction immediately, so since current direction is D (down), I cannot move U (up) next. But I can move L, R, or D.\n\nBut if I move D to (4,0), that's y=0, which is a wall, so that would be a collision. So moving D is not possible; it's deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (3,1) or R to (5,1), or U to (4,2), but U is opposite to D? No.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, meaning the snake is facing down. So after moving down to (4,1), the next move cannot be the opposite, which is U. Because \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo from current state, head direction is D, so I cannot move U for the next action.\n\nPossible actions: D, L, R.\n\nBut D to (4,0) is wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n\nNow, what about the body? Snake positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nSo head at (4,1), then (4,2) is the neck? Since it was moving down to (4,1), so previous position was (4,2), I think. Let's list the segments: index 0: head (4,1), index 1: (4,2), index 2: (4,3), index 3: (4,4), index 4: (4,5), index 5: (5,5) which is tail.\n\nSince head is at (4,1) and moving down, it came from (4,2) to (4,1), decreasing y from 2 to 1.\n\nNow, for the next move, if I move to (3,1), (5,1), or (4,0) but (4,0) is wall.\n\nAlso, (4,0) is invalid, so only possible moves are L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n\nNow, check if these cells are occupied by body or obstacles.\n\nFirst, (3,1): is it occupied?\n\nSnake positions: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). So (3,1) is not in the list, so not body.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1) is an obstacle! So (5,1) is occupied by an internal obstacle, so I cannot move R to (5,1).\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is not an obstacle and not body, so it should be free.\n\nBut let's list all obstacles:\n\nBorder walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo (5,1) is an internal obstacle, so moving R to (5,1) is deadly.\n\nMoving D to (4,0) is wall, deadly.\n\nMoving L to (3,1): (3,1) not in obstacles, not in snake body, so it should be safe, but I need to consider the move.\n\nAlso, U is not possible because it's opposite to current direction D.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, so I cannot move U.\n\nTherefore, the only possible safe move is L to (3,1).\n\nBut let's confirm: from (4,1), moving L to (3,1).\n\nNow, after moving, the snake will have new head at (3,1), and tail will move, so the segment at (5,5) will be removed, but since we're moving, the body shifts.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and the tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nBut in this case, no food is eaten yet, I think.\n\nFood: there is one food at (3,5) with value 1 and life span 8.\n\nFood: (3,5,8,1) — I think it's (x,y, life_span, value), so (3,5), life span 8, value +1.\n\nLife span 8 means it disappears after 8 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is 15, so if not eaten, it disappears after turn 15 + 8 - 1? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t when food is present, life_span is given, and it decreases each turn. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning? Probably after the turn.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves onto food cell during a move, it's eaten.\n\nFor now, at turn 15, food at (3,5) with life_span 8.\n\nBack to possible moves: only L to (3,1) is safe.\n\nBut moving to (3,1), is there food? (3,1) is not the food position; food is at (3,5), so no food at (3,1), so if I move there, no eating, snake length remains 6, tail at (5,5) moves to (4,5) or something.\n\nLet's simulate the move.\n\nCurrent snake: positions [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nAfter moving L to (3,1):\n\nNew head at (3,1)\n\nThen body: segment 1 moves to old head position (4,1)\n\nSegment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (4,2)\n\nSegment 3 to (4,3)\n\nSegment 4 to (4,4)\n\nSegment 5 to (4,5)\n\nAnd tail segment 5 was at (5,5), but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the new positions are: head (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\n(4,5) was segment 4, now segment 5? Let's index.\n\nNew positions: index 0: (3,1)  // new head\n\nIndex 1: (4,1)  // previous head, now body\n\nIndex 2: (4,2)  // previous index 1\n\nIndex 3: (4,3)  // previous index 2\n\nIndex 4: (4,4)  // previous index 3\n\nIndex 5: (4,5)  // previous index 4, and previous index 5 (5,5) is gone.\n\nSo snake now: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nLength still 6.\n\nNow, head direction: after moving left, the new head direction is L.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead. The instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nBut for turn 15, I need to output the action.\n\nCurrently, only one possible action: L to (3,1), since other moves are deadly.\n\nR to (5,1) is obstacle, D to (4,0) is wall, U not allowed because opposite direction.\n\nSo for turn 15, I must move L.\n\nBut let's confirm if U is possible? Current direction is D, so moving U would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. So U is invalid.\n\nTherefore, only L is possible.\n\nBut is there any other consideration? Like food or something.\n\nFood is at (3,5), which is far away, y=5, while head is at y=1.\n\nAlso, life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 15 + 8 - 1? Countdown from 8 at turn 15.\n\nAt turn 15, life_span=8, so after turn 15, it decreases to 7, and so on, until after 8 decreases, it disappears. Since it decreases every turn including current, at turn t with life_span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life_span N. After turn t, life_span becomes N-1. If after a turn, life_span is 0, it disappears.\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is N, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., up to turn t + N - 1. On turn t + N, it disappears before the turn or after? Typically, it should be available at the start of turn t + N - 1, and after that turn, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nBut for simplicity, since countdown decreases every turn, including current, at turn 15 with life_span 8, after turn 15, it becomes 7; after turn 16, 6; ... after turn 22, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 15 to 22 inclusive? From turn 15 to turn 22, that's 8 turns: 15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22.\n\nAt turn 15, life_span 8, after turn 15, life_span 7; after turn 16, 6; ... after turn 22, life_span 0, so it disappears before turn 23 or after turn 22? I think it's available during turns when life_span >0.\n\nSo from turn 15 to 22, life_span from 8 down to 1, so can be eaten on any of these turns.\n\nOn turn 22, life_span=1, if not eaten, after turn 22 it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 15, life_span=8.\n\nBut for now, at turn 15, head is at (4,1), food at (3,5), which is 4 steps away in y-direction, but with obstacles.\n\nI need to plan multiple moves.\n\nBut for turn 15, I have no choice but to move L to (3,1).\n\nThen, from there, I can plan future turns.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 15.\n\nBut I need to output for turn 15, t1+1, etc., up to how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the output should be the actions for the turns, but it might be that I output only one action if that's all, but I think I need to provide a sequence, but since future depends, I can plan a path.\n\nThe format is to output for several turns: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nBut how many? It doesn't specify, but I should provide a sequence based on my plan.\n\nPerhaps for now, since only one choice, I move L on turn 15.\n\nThen for turn 16, from (3,1), head direction L (since I moved left).\n\nNow possible moves: since head direction L, I cannot move R (opposite).\n\nPossible: U, D, L.\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n(3,1) is head, moving U to (3,2), D to (3,0), L to (2,1).\n\n(3,0) is y=0, wall, deadly.\n\n(2,1): is it free? Snake positions after move: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nSo (2,1) not in snake.\n\nObstacles: internal (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4) and borders.\n\n(2,1) not in obstacles, so safe.\n\n(3,2): not in snake positions, not obstacle, so safe.\n\nD to (3,0) wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to the food at (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5.\n\nCurrently head at (3,1), so I can move up to (3,2), then (3,3), etc., but need to avoid obstacles and body.\n\nBody: after moving to (3,1), snake is [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nSo (4,5) is tail, but (3,5) is food, which is not occupied by body now.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but here it's not under body; (3,5) is free.\n\nIn the state, food is at (3,5), and snake has (4,5), which is adjacent but not the same.\n\n(4,5) is snake body, (3,5) is food.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move head to (3,5).\n\nBut from (3,1), I can move up to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is an obstacle at x=2,y=4.\n\nAlso, (1,2) at x=1,y=2.\n\nNow, if I move from (3,1) to (3,2), that should be fine.\n\nThen to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut at (3,3), is it safe? No obstacles there.\n\nThen to (3,4), then to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nBut when I move to (3,5), if the tail is still there or not.\n\nAlso, need to check the tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, the food is at (3,5), and tail is at (4,5) currently.\n\nAfter moving to (3,2), let's simulate step by step.\n\nTurn 15: move L to (3,1)\n\nSnake: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] direction L\n\nTurn 16: I can move U to (3,2)\n\nThen new head (3,2), body: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) and tail (4,5) removed? No food eaten, so tail removed.\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) — length 6, tail at (4,4)\n\n(4,5) gone.\n\nNow, food at (3,5) still.\n\nHead direction now U.\n\nTurn 17: move U to (3,3)\n\nNew head (3,3), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) — tail at (4,3)\n\n(4,4) gone? Previous positions: after turn 16, snake [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]? Let's keep track.\n\nAfter turn 16 move to (3,2):\n\n- New head: (3,2)\n\n- Body segments: segment 1: previous head (3,1)\n\nSegment 2: previous segment 1 (4,1)\n\nSegment 3: previous segment 2 (4,2)\n\nSegment 4: previous segment 3 (4,3)\n\nSegment 5: previous segment 4 (4,4)\n\nPrevious segment 5 (4,5) is removed.\n\nSo snake: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nTail at (4,4)\n\nTurn 17: move U to (3,3)\n\nNew head (3,3)\n\nBody: segment 1: (3,2)  // prev head\n\nSegment 2: (3,1)  // prev seg1\n\nSegment 3: (4,1)  // prev seg2\n\nSegment 4: (4,2)  // prev seg3\n\nSegment 5: (4,3)  // prev seg4\n\nPrev seg5 (4,4) removed.\n\nSo snake: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)] tail at (4,3)\n\nTurn 18: move U to (3,4)\n\nNew head (3,4)\n\nBody: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)  // tail at (4,2)\n\n(4,3) removed.\n\nSnake: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 19: move U to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nNow, at (3,5) is food with value +1, so I eat it.\n\nWhen head moves to food, it grows, so tail not removed, new head at (3,5), and body extends.\n\nSo positions: new head (3,5)\n\nThen body: previous head (3,4) now segment 1\n\nThen (3,3) seg2, (3,2) seg3, (3,1) seg4, (4,1) seg5, (4,2) seg6, and since ate food, add a new segment at tail position? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays.\n\nAfter moving to food cell, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added where the tail was, so length increases.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, snake has positions, say S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving to a food cell, new head at food position, and body: [H, B1, B2, ..., T] but H is new, and T stays, so positions: [new_head, old_head, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nLength increases by one.\n\nIn this case, turn 19: before move, snake is at [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]  // head (3,4), tail (4,2)\n\nMove to (3,5), which is food, so eat it.\n\nNew positions: head (3,5)\n\nThen body: old head (3,4) now segment 1\n\n(3,3) seg2\n\n(3,2) seg3\n\n(3,1) seg4\n\n(4,1) seg5\n\n(4,2) seg6 (tail, but since ate, it stays)\n\nAnd a new segment is added? No, the tail position is kept, so the new tail is at (4,2), and the segment that was tail remains, so positions become: [ (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ] length 7.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, at this point, head is at (3,5), and tail is at (4,2).\n\nFood is eaten, so no more food, or other food? Currently only one food given.\n\nIn the state, only one food: (3,5,8,1)\n\nAfter eating, it's gone.\n\nNow, back to the path: from turn 15, I moved L to (3,1), then U to (3,2) on turn 16, then U to (3,3) on turn 17, U to (3,4) on turn 18, U to (3,5) on turn 19.\n\nBut turn 19 is t1+4, since t1=15, t1+1=16, t1+2=17, t1+3=18, t1+4=19.\n\nBut I need to output actions starting from turn 15.\n\nIn this sequence, I assumed moving up all the way, but on turn 16, from (3,1), I could also move L to (2,1), but that might not lead to food directly.\n\nSince I want to eat the food, moving up is better.\n\nBut is there any danger?\n\nWhen I move to (3,5) on turn 19, is the head adjacent to tail? Tail is at (4,2), which is not adjacent to (3,5). (3,5) and (4,2) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,5) adjacent to (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5). (4,2) is far.\n\nSo no tail reward danger.\n\nAlso, food is positive, so I get +1 score and grow.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 15, I move L, which is necessary.\n\nThen on turn 16, I can move U to (3,2), as above.\n\nBut from (3,1), after moving L on turn 15, head at (3,1), direction L.\n\nOn turn 16, moving U to (3,2) is fine, not opposite.\n\nSimilarly, then moving U again to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut when I move to (3,3), is there any obstacle? (3,3) should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — no (3,3), so ok.\n\n(3,4) free, (3,5) free except food.\n\nBut (3,5) has food, which is good.\n\nNow, but I need to consider if this path is safe with the obstacles.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (2,4), which is near, but I'm at x=3, so moving up on x=3 should be fine.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (3,5), no issue.\n\nBut after eating, I need to survive, but since no other food, I can just move around.\n\nBut for now, eating the food is good.\n\nBut is there a faster way? Or other considerations.\n\nOn turn 15, only one choice: move L to (3,1).\n\nThen on turn 16, from (3,1), I could move L to (2,1), but that might delay getting to food.\n\nFor example, move L to (2,1) on turn 16.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2), but (2,2) is not obstacle, but (1,2) is obstacle, so (2,2) should be free.\n\nThen to (2,3), but (2,4) is obstacle, so I cannot move to (2,4), so from (2,3), I might move to (2,2) or (1,3) or (3,3), but (1,3) might be ok, but it's messy.\n\nAnd food is at (3,5), so from (2,1) to (2,2) to (2,3), then I have to go to (3,3) or something, but (2,4) blocked, so I need to go to (3,3) then (3,4), (3,5), same as before but with an extra move to (2,1).\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 16: move L to (2,1) — from (3,1) to (2,1)\n\nThen snake: head (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) tail (4,4)? After turn 15 move to (3,1), snake [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] but after move, tail is (4,5)? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 15: snake [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 16: move L to (2,1)\n\nNew head (2,1)\n\nBody: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) and (4,5) removed? No food, so tail removed.\n\nPositions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) — tail at (4,4)\n\nThen I need to go up, but (2,2) is free? Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\nMove U to (2,2) on turn 17.\n\nThen to (2,3) on turn 18.\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, so I cannot move to (2,4). From (2,3), I can move to (2,2), but that's back, or (1,3), or (3,3).\n\n(1,3): x=1,y=3, not border, not internal obstacle, so free.\n\nOr (3,3).\n\nThen to (3,4) and (3,5), but it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 17: from (2,1) move U to (2,2) — head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) tail (4,3)? Previous: after turn 16, snake [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nMove to (2,2): new head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) — tail (4,3), (4,4) removed.\n\nTurn 18: move to (2,3) — head (2,3), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) tail (4,2)\n\nNow, from (2,3), I can move to (3,3) or (1,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nMove to (3,3) on turn 19.\n\nThen to (3,4) on turn 20, to (3,5) on turn 21.\n\nBut food life span: at turn 15, life span 8, so available until turn 22.\n\nTurn 21 is within, but I eat on turn 21 instead of turn 19 if I go directly up.\n\nBy going left first, I delay eating by two turns, and risk the food disappearing or something, but life span is long, 8 turns, so from turn 15 to 22, I have time.\n\nBut still, eating sooner is better to avoid risks.\n\nMoreover, by moving directly up, I eat on turn 19.\n\nIn the direct path, I eat on turn 19.\n\nNow, after eating, I have a longer snake, and need to survive.\n\nBut with no food, I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nNow, the grid has obstacles.\n\nAfter eating on turn 19, head at (3,5), snake: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)] as earlier.\n\nLength 7.\n\nHead direction U (since moved up to (3,5)).\n\nNow, possible moves: U, D, L, R? Current direction U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n\nCan move U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\nNow, (3,6): y=6, not wall yet, y=7 is wall, so (3,6) ok.\n\n(2,5): not obstacle.\n\n(4,5): but (4,5) is part of body? Snake positions: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n\n(4,5) is not in snake, so free.\n\nBut is it obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — no (4,5), so free.\n\nSo all three possible: U, L, R.\n\nBut (3,6) is y=6, below y=7.\n\ny=7 is top wall.\n\nMoving U to (3,6) is safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,7), but (3,7) is y=7, which is wall? y=7 is border wall, so moving to (3,7) is deadly.\n\nSimilarly, x=0,7 y=0,7 walls.\n\nSo from (3,5), moving U to (3,6) is ok, but then from (3,6), I cannot move U to (3,7) wall.\n\nI can move L or R.\n\nBut let's not plan too far yet.\n\nSince I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nBack to turn 15.\n\nFor turn 15, action must be L.\n\nThen for turn 16, from (3,1), I should move U to (3,2) to go towards food.\n\nSimilarly, turn 17: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 18: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 20, from (3,5), I need to move somewhere.\n\nAs above, can move U, L, or R.\n\nBut moving U to (3,6) might be ok, but then I'm near wall.\n\nI could move L to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n\nNow, to avoid risks, I should move away from walls.\n\nAlso, there is obstacle at (2,4), which is below (2,5), so (2,5) might be ok.\n\n(4,5) should be fine.\n\nAfter turn 19, snake at (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nThe body is mostly on the left and down.\n\nMoving R to (4,5) might be good to go right side.\n\nThen I can go to (5,5), but (5,5) was tail earlier, but now free? After moving, positions changed.\n\n(5,5) is free, no obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,5) not listed.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) obstacle, (6,4) obstacle.\n\nBut (5,5) free.\n\nSo move R to (4,5) on turn 20? (4,5) is the cell.\n\nHead at (3,5), move R to (4,5).\n\nThen new head (4,5), body: old head (3,5) now body, then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), and tail (4,2) stays since no food? No, I didn't eat, so tail moves? After eating on turn 19, no food now, so on turn 20, moving to (4,5), no food there, so no growth, tail moves.\n\nTurn 20: move to (4,5)\n\nNew head (4,5)\n\nBody: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) and tail (4,2) removed? Positions: before move, snake [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nAfter moving to (4,5), no food, so new head (4,5), then body: old head (3,5) seg1, (3,4) seg2, (3,3) seg3, (3,2) seg4, (3,1) seg5, (4,1) seg6, and tail (4,2) removed. So snake: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] length 7 still? Length was 7, after move no eat, so length should be 7, but tail removed and head added, so positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) — yes, tail at (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is now tail, but (4,1) is also an obstacle? Internal obstacle (5,1), not (4,1). (4,1) is not obstacle.\n\n(5,1) is obstacle, so (4,1) is free.\n\nNow head at (4,5), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen I can move U, D, L, R? Current direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nCan move U to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5).\n\n(4,6) y=6, ok.\n\n(4,4): but is it free? Snake positions: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) — so (4,4) not in list, so free.\n\n(5,5) free.\n\nBut (4,4) might be under something, but not occupied now.\n\nAlso obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (4,4) not.\n\nSo all possible except opposite.\n\nBut to maximize survival, I should avoid tight spots.\n\nSince I need to output for multiple turns, but the sequence might depend.\n\nFor the answer, I can output for turn 15 to, say, turn 19 or 20.\n\nBut let's see the required format.\n\nIt says: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action ... }\"\n\nAnd \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide actions for at least 5 turns: turn 15 to turn 19 or 20.\n\nFrom above, turn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: U (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 17: U (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 18: U (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 19: U (to (3,5) eat)\n\nThen for turn 20, I need to choose.\n\nBut perhaps I can include up to turn 20.\n\nSince the food life span is long, and no other risks, this path seems safe.\n\nBut is there any risk in moving up directly?\n\nFor example, when I move to (3,4) on turn 18, head at (3,4), and I move to (3,5) on turn 19.\n\nBut (3,5) is food, and tail is at (4,2), not adjacent, so safe.\n\nAlso, the body is not blocking.\n\nAnother thing: special cases, food under body, but here not.\n\nIn this case, all seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I can consider if moving L on turn 16 is better, but it delays eating.\n\nSince life span is 8, from turn 15, I have until turn 22 to eat, so turn 19 is fine.\n\nBut to be efficient, direct path is better.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I have more space to move.\n\nNow, about the walls: the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with borders.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), I can move to the right, for example.\n\nTo output the actions.\n\nSo for turn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nThen for turn 20, since I need to think ahead, but I can stop at turn 19 or add one more.\n\nThe answer should include the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 19 I eat, so I might want to continue.\n\nSince the instruction is to maximize score, and after eating, no food, so I just need to survive, but I can move safely.\n\nFor example, on turn 20, from (3,5) after eating, head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nI can move, say, R to (4,5) to go away from left wall.\n\nThen from there, I can go up or down.\n\nBut y=5, moving R to (4,5), then to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) might be near obstacles.\n\n(5,1) is obstacle, but (5,5) is ok.\n\nAlso, (6,4) is obstacle at x=6,y=4.\n\nSo I should avoid that area.\n\nMoving left to (2,5) might be risky because of (2,4) obstacle below, but (2,5) is free.\n\n(1,2) obstacle, but not directly affecting.\n\nTo be safe, moving right might be better.\n\nBut for the output, I can provide up to turn 20.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, from turn 15, 5 turns: turn 15,16,17,18,19.\n\nSo actions for turn 15 to 19.\n\nTurn 19: U to eat.\n\nThen I can add turn 20 if I want, but not necessary.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 19, head at (3,5), and I need to move.\n\nBut for the answer, I think providing turn 15 to 19 is fine.\n\nNow, confirm the actions.\n\nTurn 15: from (4,1) move L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 16: from (3,1) move U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 17: from (3,2) move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 18: from (3,3) move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: from (3,4) move U to (3,5) and eat.\n\nAll these moves are valid and safe.\n\nOn turn 17, when at (3,2), moving to (3,3), is (3,3) safe? Yes, free cell.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nAlso, head direction: on turn 15, after moving L, direction L.\n\nTurn 16: moving U, which is perpendicular, so direction changes to U.\n\nTurn 17: moving U again, direction U.\n\nTurn 18: U, direction U.\n\nTurn 19: U, direction U.\n\nNo instant reverse issue.\n\nSo this should be good.\n\nBut the problem says \"prioritize long-term survival\", and here I eat the food safely, and then I can survive by moving around.\n\nPerhaps there is a risk I missed.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,5) has life span 8, turn 15, so if I delay, it might disappear, but I eat on turn 19, which is turn 15+4, life span decreases to 4 on turn 19? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 15, life span 8.\n\nAfter turn 15, when I move, life span decreases after the turn or before? The countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nBut for the move, when I decide to move, the state is given at the start of turn.\n\nAt start of turn 15, food has life span 8.\n\nAfter I move, at the end of turn, life span decreases? The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nIt might be that at the beginning of each turn, before action, the life span is updated? But it says \"including current\", so perhaps when the turn starts, life span decreases.\n\nAssume that at the start of turn t, for food, life span is given, and after the turn, it decreases by one.\n\nBut for eating, during the turn, when head moves to food cell.\n\nIn this case, at turn 15 start, life span 8.\n\nAfter turn 15, after action, life span becomes 7.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 16, 6, etc.\n\nSo at turn 19 start, before action, life span should be 8 - 4 = 4? Since decreased 4 times from turn 15 to 18.\n\nTurn 15: after turn, life span 7\n\nTurn 16: after turn, 6\n\nTurn 17: after turn, 5\n\nTurn 18: after turn, 4\n\nAt start of turn 19, life span 4, so if I move to (3,5), I eat it, life span still >0.\n\nThen it disappears after turn 19.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nIf I had delayed, say to turn 21, at start of turn 21, life span would be 8 - 6 = 2? After turn 20, life span 2, so on turn 21, I can eat if life span >0.\n\nBut in my path, I eat on turn 19, fine.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, for the answer.\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nThe format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nt1=15.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 15: L\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Snake Game Decision\n\nThe current state at turn 15 requires careful planning to maximize score by eating the positive food at (3,5) while ensuring long-term survival. The snake must avoid walls, internal obstacles, and body collisions. The food at (3,5) has a value of +1 and a life span of 8, meaning it disappears after turn 22 (countdown decreases each turn, including turn 15). Eating it safely requires reaching it by turn 22.\n\n#### Key Constraints and Risks:\n- **Current Position and Direction**: Snake head is at (4,1) with direction D (down). From here:\n  - Moving D to (4,0) is invalid (y=0 wall).\n  - Moving R to (5,1) is invalid (internal obstacle at (5,1)).\n  - Moving U is invalid (opposite to current direction D).\n  - Only valid move is L to (3,1).\n- **Food Access**: Food at (3,5) is reachable by moving up from (3,1) to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5). This path is safe:\n  - No obstacles at (3,2), (3,3), or (3,4).\n  - On reaching (3,5) to eat, the tail is not adjacent (tail at (4,2) after moves), so no tail reward danger.\n- **Life Span Consideration**: Food life span is 8 at turn 15. It decreases to 7 after turn 15, 6 after turn 16, etc. Reaching (3,5) by turn 19 ensures eating before expiration (life span 4 at turn 19 start, >0).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating, the snake grows to length 7. The grid has obstacles, but moving right (e.g., to (4,5)) after eating opens safer areas away from walls and obstacles like (2,4).\n\n#### 5-Turn Plan (Turns 15-19):\n- **Turn 15 (t1)**: Move L to (3,1) – Only safe move; avoids wall and obstacle.\n- **Turn 16 (t1+1)**: Move U to (3,2) – Starts path to food; perpendicular move, valid direction change.\n- **Turn 17 (t1+2)**: Move U to (3,3) – Continues safe ascent; no obstacles.\n- **Turn 18 (t1+3)**: Move U to (3,4) – Prepares for food; cell free.\n- **Turn 19 (t1+4)**: Move U to (3,5) – Eats food (+1 score, length +1); no collision risk.\n\nThis sequence eats the food efficiently by turn 19, leveraging the full life span. After turn 19, survival is prioritized by moving right (e.g., to (4,5)) to explore open areas, avoiding the left side near obstacles like (2,4) and walls.\n\n#### Output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: L\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 16.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls, meaning we can't go there. Also, internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). These are cells the snake can't move into.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,1), then body segments at (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So the snake is 6 segments long. Head direction is L, which means left, so it was moving left last turn to get to (3,1).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (3,5) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,6) with life span 10 and value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth foods are positive, no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. The answer should be in the format: Turn 16: action, Turn 17: action, etc.\n\nSince the snake head is at (3,1) and moving left, possible moves now are U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent head direction is L (left), so I cannot instantly reverse to R (right) on this turn. So moving right is not allowed. Possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left).\n\nBut I need to check what cells are safe to move to.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (3,1)\n\n- Body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo the snake body is mostly vertical from (4,1) to (4,5), head at (3,1) attached to (4,1).\n\nFood at (3,5) and (5,6).\n\n(3,5): this is above the snake body. Snake has (4,4) and (4,5), so (3,5) is to the left of (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is to the right of (4,5), but (4,5) is the tail, I think.\n\nSnake positions: indices: 0: head (3,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,5) which is the tail.\n\nSo tail is at (4,5).\n\nFood at (3,5): x=3,y=5. Snake has (4,5) at tail, so (3,5) is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (4,5), so (3,5) is left of tail.\n\nFood at (5,6): x=5,y=6, which is not occupied by snake.\n\nNow, life span: for (3,5) life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn. So on turn 16, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 16 + 7 - 1? Let's see.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, food with life span N will disappear after N turns, meaning it is gone at the start of turn t + N.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, after this turn (turn t), life span becomes L-1, and so on, until life span 0, it disappears.\n\nIn this case, turn 16, food (3,5) has life span 7, so it will be there until turn 16 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, life span is L. After the turn, life span decreases by 1, so at the start of turn t+1, life span is L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before that turn starts or after?\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, the food is present with life span L. After the turn, L decreases by 1. If L was 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears for the next turn.\n\nFor example, if life span is 1 at turn t, it is present during turn t, and after turn t, it disappears, so not available on turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, if life span is 2, present at turn t and t+1, disappears before turn t+2.\n\nIn general, food with life span L at turn t will be available for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n\nFor (3,5): at turn 16, life span 7, so available from turn 16 to 16+6=22? Let's calculate:\n\n- Turn 16: life span 7\n\n- After turn 16, life span 6, available for turn 17\n\n- After turn 17, life span 5, available for turn 18\n\n...\n\n- After turn 22, life span 1, available for turn 23? No.\n\nStart of turn 16: life span 7, so available.\n\nAfter turn 16 is processed, life span decreases to 6.\n\nStart of turn 17: life span 6, available.\n\n...\n\nStart of turn 22: life span 1, available.\n\nAfter turn 22 processed, life span decreases to 0, disappears, not available for turn 23.\n\nSo food is available for turns from t to t + L - 1, where t is current turn, L is initial life span.\n\nFor (3,5): L=7, t=16, available turns 16 to 22 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6): L=10, available turns 16 to 25 inclusive.\n\nNow, back to movement. Current head at (3,1), direction L, so cannot move right (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (3,2)), D (down to (3,0), but y=0 is wall, so D is invalid), L (left to (2,1)).\n\nCheck:\n\n- U: to (3,2)\n\n- D: to (3,0), but y=0 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n\n- L: to (2,1)\n\n- R: but cannot, because reverse from L.\n\nAlso, are there obstacles? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,1) is not in obstacles, so should be free.\n\nBut snake body: positions are (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and head (3,1). So (3,2) is not occupied by body? Let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo cells occupied: x,y: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\n(3,2) is free, no snake, no wall, no obstacle.\n\n(2,1) is free, no wall or obstacle mentioned.\n\n(3,0) is wall.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,1): U to (3,2), or L to (2,1).\n\nD is invalid, R is invalid.\n\nNow, need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood at (3,5) and (5,6).\n\n(3,5) is at y=5, x=3. Currently snake head at (3,1), so same x, different y.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nAlso, tail is at (4,5), which is adjacent to (3,5) and (5,5), but (5,5) is not food.\n\n(3,5) is food, and tail is at (4,5), so they are adjacent horizontally.\n\nNow, the rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, the food is not on the tail, it's on (3,5), separate from tail (4,5). So if snake eats (3,5), it's fine, no danger from that.\n\nThe danger is only if the food is on the tail cell itself.\n\nRule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n\nBut here, (3,5) is not the tail cell; tail cell is (4,5). So (3,5) is just a food cell, not on tail.\n\nSo eating (3,5) should be safe, as long as we don't collide.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is not near tail.\n\nNow, to eat (3,5), since it's at (3,5), and snake head at (3,1), we need to move up to y=5.\n\nCurrently at (3,1), we can go U to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc., up to (3,5).\n\nBut is (3,5) occupied? No, only if snake is there, but snake is at (4,5), not (3,5). (3,5) is food, so we can move there.\n\nBut the snake body: when we move, the body follows.\n\nAlso, need to check if there are obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is at x=2,y=4, which might be in the way if we go left.\n\n(1,2) at x=1,y=2.\n\nNow, let's think about paths.\n\nFirst, immediate move: turn 16, from (3,1), possible actions: U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (3,2), or L to (2,1).\n\nI need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, since food (3,5) has life span 7, available until turn 22, and (5,6) until turn 25, so both have time.\n\nBut (3,5) is closer, and might be easier to get.\n\nIf I go up to (3,2), then I can continue up to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) to eat the food on turn, say, 20 if I go directly.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,5) is 4 steps up, but I might not go directly.\n\nTurn 16: if U to (3,2)\n\nThen snake positions: head to (3,2), then body: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), and tail (4,5) moves? When head moves to new cell, the tail end is removed if no food eaten.\n\nWhen snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position, so tail is removed.\n\nIf eats food, tail stays, so snake grows.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten yet.\n\nSo if move U to (3,2):\n\nNew head: (3,2)\n\nBody: previous head (3,1) becomes first body, then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) is removed? Snake positions: before move: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nAfter move, head to (3,2), then segments: position 1: previous head (3,1), position 2: previous (4,1), position 3: previous (4,2), position 4: previous (4,3), position 5: previous (4,4), and (4,5) is not included, so tail is now (4,4)? Let's index.\n\nBefore: segments S0: (3,1) head, S1: (4,1), S2: (4,2), S3: (4,3), S4: (4,4), S5: (4,5) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to new position, say (x_new,y_new), then new positions: head (x_new,y_new), then S0 becomes body at (3,1), S1 at (4,1), S2 at (4,2), S3 at (4,3), S4 at (4,4), and S5 is removed. So new tail is S4, which was (4,4).\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then body: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Tail at (4,4).\n\n(4,5) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (2,1), head (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,4) since (4,5) removed.\n\n(4,5) was tail, removed, so (4,4) new tail.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nIf I go U to (3,2), I can continue up towards (3,5).\n\nIf I go L to (2,1), I go left, away from the food.\n\nBut there might be reasons, like avoiding dead ends or something.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to see possible paths.\n\nGrid cells: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, cannot move there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo free cells except these.\n\nNow, snake at (3,1), (4,1), etc., but as we move, snake moves.\n\nAlso, food at (3,5) and (5,6).\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5. Obstacles: (2,4) is at x=2,y=4, which is left and down from (3,5).\n\n(1,2) at x=1,y=2.\n\n(5,1) at x=5,y=1, which is near the snake body.\n\n(6,1) and (6,4).\n\nTo reach (3,5), from (3,1), I can go directly up: (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5).\n\nNow, check if these cells are free:\n\n(3,2): free, no obstacle\n\n(3,3): let's see, no obstacle mentioned, so free\n\n(3,4): no obstacle, free\n\n(3,5): food, free except food.\n\nBut when I move to (3,5), I eat the food, so snake grows.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (5,6), from (3,1), I need to go right and up, but there are obstacles.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nFrom current position, I can go to (4,1) but that's body, cannot.\n\nNeed to move around.\n\nBut (5,1) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly to x=5 at y=1.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nAlso, after eating food, snake grows, so more body to manage.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options for turn 16.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,2)\n\nThen positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)  // tail at (4,4)\n\nNow, from here, I can go U to (3,3), or L to (2,2), or R to (4,2) but (4,2) is body? Current body: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(4,2) is occupied, so cannot move right to (4,2).\n\nPossible moves from (3,2):\n\n- U to (3,3): free?\n\n- D to (3,1): but (3,1) is body, so collision, cannot\n\n- L to (2,2): free? (2,2) not obstacle, and not snake body? Body is at (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), so (2,2) free\n\n- R to (4,2): occupied by body, cannot\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nIf U to (3,3), then continue up.\n\nIf L to (2,2), then I go left.\n\nBut I want to go to (3,5), so better to go U.\n\nSimilarly, if I go L on turn 16 to (2,1), then positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)  // tail (4,4)\n\nThen from (2,1), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,2): free?\n\n- D to (2,0): y=0 wall, cannot\n\n- L to (1,1): (1,1) not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is at (1,2), not (1,1), so (1,1) free\n\n- R to (3,1): but (3,1) is body, cannot\n\nSo U, L possible.\n\nBut going left might lead to dead end if I go to (1,1) or something.\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (3,5). If I go directly up, I can reach it in 4 moves: from (3,1) to (3,2) on turn 16, (3,3) on 17, (3,4) on 18, (3,5) on 19.\n\nOn turn 19, move to (3,5), eat food, snake grows.\n\nCurrently snake length 6, after eating, length 7.\n\nThen life span of (3,5) is 7, available until turn 22, so turn 19 is within, since 16 to 22, turn 19 is ok.\n\nSimilarly, the other food at (5,6) is available longer.\n\nBut after eating (3,5), I need to think where to go next.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (3,5), the current tail is at (4,5)? Let's see the path.\n\nStart turn 16: head at (3,1), move U to (3,2)\n\nPositions: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)  // tail (4,4)\n\nTurn 17: from (3,2), move U to (3,3)\n\nPositions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)  // tail (4,3) since (4,4) removed? After move, head to (3,3), body: previous head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4) removed. So positions: head (3,3), body (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) tail.\n\n(4,4) is free.\n\nTurn 18: from (3,3), move U to (3,4)\n\nPositions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)  // tail (4,2)\n\nTurn 19: from (3,4), move U to (3,5)\n\nNow, (3,5) has food, so eat it, snake grows, tail does not move.\n\nSo positions: head (3,5), then body: previous head (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) and tail stays, so the segment that would be removed is not, so snake has 7 segments: head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nNow, after that, I need to move from (3,5). Possible directions: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut D to (3,4) is body, cannot; L to (2,5); R to (4,5); U to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is y=6, not wall, y=7 is wall, so (3,6) is free? But internal obstacles? No at (3,6).\n\n(4,5): is it free? Not occupied by snake now, and not obstacle.\n\n(2,5): free?\n\nBut there is obstacle at (2,4), which is below.\n\nAlso, the grid has walls.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go U to (3,6), R to (4,5), or L to (2,5).\n\nD to (3,4) is body, cannot.\n\nNow, (4,5) is free, since earlier tail was there but moved.\n\nIn positions, after eating, body has (4,2) as tail, so (4,5) free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) free, (2,5) free.\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, so L to (2,5) is ok, but then from there, I might be limited.\n\n(2,5) to (2,6) up, or (2,4) but obstacle, cannot, or (1,5) left, or (3,5) but body.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (4,5), then from (4,5), I can go to (4,6) or (5,5), etc.\n\n(5,6) is food there.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go to (5,5) or (4,6), etc.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, I should consider if going directly to (3,5) is safe.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (3,5), the cell (3,5) might have been under snake body? But in this case, before moving, on turn 18, snake has (4,2) as tail, and (3,5) is free, not under body.\n\nThe rule about food under body: here, (3,5) is not under snake body at any point, I think.\n\nInitially, snake at y=1 to 5 at x=4, and (3,5) is separate.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, but after eating, I have a long snake, and need to find space.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), if I go U to (3,6), then positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) // tail (4,1)\n\nThen from (3,6), I can go U to (3,7), but y=7 wall, cannot; D to (3,5) body; L to (2,6); R to (4,6).\n\nSo U and D invalid, only L or R.\n\n(2,6) or (4,6).\n\n(4,6) might be better to go towards (5,6) food.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (4,5) on turn 20, then from there to (4,6) or (5,5), etc.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), so I can go to it.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (6,4), (6,1), etc., but not directly blocking.\n\n(5,1) is obstacle, but at y=1.\n\nNow, back to turn 16 choice.\n\nIf I go left to (2,1) on turn 16, then I might go to a different area.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), I can go U to (2,2), then to (2,3), but there is obstacle at (2,4), so I cannot go to (2,4), so from (2,3), I need to go right or left.\n\n(2,3) to (2,4) impossible, so to (1,3) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut it might take longer to reach food.\n\nSince both foods are positive, and I need to maximize score, eating (3,5) sooner is good, as it might disappear later, but it has until turn 22, so time.\n\nBut also, after eating, snake is longer, which might make it harder to move, so I should eat when it's safe.\n\nAnother risk: the area around.\n\nFor example, if I go up to (3,5), and then I am at (3,5), with body down to (4,1), so the left side has obstacle at (2,4), which blocks the way to x<3 at y=4.\n\nBut from (3,5), I can go right to (4,5), then to (5,5), then to (5,6) to eat the other food.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), (5,5) is free? Obstacles: (5,1) is at y=1, not (5,5). (6,4) is at (6,4), not (5,5). So (5,5) free.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (5,6) up.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,5) to (5,5) right.\n\nThen eat (5,6) on turn, say, 22 or something.\n\nBut let's estimate turns.\n\nFrom turn 19: at (3,5) after eating.\n\nTurn 20: move to (4,5) for example.\n\nThen positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) // tail (4,1)\n\nThen turn 21: from (4,5), move to (5,5)\n\nHead to (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) // tail (3,1)\n\n(4,1) removed? When move to (5,5), no food, so tail removed, which was (4,1) or (3,1)? Positions: after turn 20, head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) so segments: S0: (4,5), S1: (3,5), S2: (3,4), S3: (3,3), S4: (3,2), S5: (3,1), S6: (4,1) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,5), head (5,5), body: S0 becomes body at (4,5), S1 at (3,5), S2 at (3,4), S3 at (3,3), S4 at (3,2), S5 at (3,1), and S6 (4,1) removed. So new positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) tail.\n\nThen turn 22: from (5,5) to (5,6), eat food (5,6), so grow, tail not removed.\n\nHead (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) and S6 not removed, but S6 was (3,1)? After eating, the segment that would be removed is not, so positions: head (5,6), then previous head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — 8 segments.\n\nTail at (3,1).\n\nThen I need to move from (5,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is cornered? From (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) wall; D to (5,5) body; L to (4,6); R to (6,6).\n\n(6,6): is it free? x=6,y=6, not border wall, internal obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), not (6,6), so free.\n\n(4,6) free.\n\nSo can go L or R.\n\nBut snake is long, and the body is from (3,1) to (5,6), which might block paths.\n\nBut I can manage.\n\nNow, back to turn 16, if I go left, to (2,1), then I might not reach the food quickly.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), I could go U to (2,2), but (1,2) is obstacle, so from (2,2), I can go U to (2,3), or R to (3,2), or L to (1,2) but obstacle, cannot.\n\n(1,2) obstacle, so L invalid.\n\nU to (2,3) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf U to (2,3), then from (2,3), I cannot go to (2,4) because obstacle (2,4), so must go to (1,3) or (3,3).\n\n(1,3) might be dead end if no way out.\n\nx=1,y=3, then to (1,4), but (1,2) obstacle, but (1,4) free, but border at x=0, so limited space.\n\nFor example, from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., but to reach (3,5), I need to go right, but at y=4, (2,4) obstacle, so I cannot go directly from left to (3,5) at y=4-5, because (2,4) blocks.\n\nFrom (1,5), I can go to (2,5), then to (3,5), since (2,4) is below, but (2,5) is above, so I can go to (2,5) from (1,5), then to (3,5).\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nFor instance, turn 16: move L to (2,1)\n\nPositions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) tail\n\nTurn 17: move U to (2,2)\n\nHead (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) tail\n\nTurn 18: move U to (2,3)\n\nHead (2,3), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) tail\n\nTurn 19: from (2,3), move to (3,3)? (3,3) free? Yes, not occupied.\n\nMove R to (3,3)\n\nHead (3,3), body (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) tail\n\nTurn 20: move U to (3,4)\n\nHead (3,4), body (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) tail\n\n(4,1) removed.\n\nTurn 21: move U to (3,5), eat food.\n\nSo on turn 21, eat (3,5), later than if I went directly.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (5,6) from there.\n\nSo going left first delays eating the food, and might not be efficient.\n\nMoreover, the life span is enough, but I get the point later.\n\nAlso, by going up directly, I can eat on turn 19, and then go to the other food.\n\nBut there might be a risk with the obstacle at (2,4).\n\nIn the direct path, when I go up to (3,5), and then to (4,5), etc., it seems fine.\n\nAnother thing: the head direction.\n\nOn turn 16, if I move U, direction becomes U.\n\nThen turn 17 U, direction U.\n\nTurn 18 U, U.\n\nTurn 19 U to (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen from (3,5), if I go R to (4,5), direction R.\n\nNo reverse issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's consider if there is a reason to go left.\n\nPerhaps to avoid a potential trap or to have more space.\n\nFor example, if I go left to (2,1), then up, I might have the option to go to other areas, but with the obstacles, it might be constrained.\n\nThe grid has free cells: for example, bottom left: (1,1), (1,2) obstacle, so (1,1) to (1,3) but (1,2) blocked, so cannot go to y=2 at x=1.\n\n(1,1) to (1,0) wall, or (0,1) wall, or (2,1), so from (1,1) only to (2,1) or (1,2) but obstacle, so only to (2,1) if possible.\n\nSimilarly, top left: (1,5), (1,6), etc., but (2,4) obstacle blocks lower part.\n\nBut (1,5) is free, I can go there.\n\nBut it might not be necessary.\n\nTo maximize score, eating both foods is good, so I should aim to eat (3,5) first since closer, then (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is farther, but I have time.\n\nLife span to turn 25.\n\nAfter eating both, snake length 8, and I need to survive.\n\nBut since I have to think only 5+ turns, I can plan the sequence.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe format says: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions, from turn 16 to 20 or 21.\n\nBut in the context, I can provide until I eat the first food or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nI think going up directly is better.\n\nBut let's check the Tail Reward Danger for (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is not on the tail; tail is at (4,5) initially, but when I approach, on turn 18, tail is at (4,2), and (3,5) is free, so no issue.\n\nAlso, when I move to (3,5), head is at (3,5), and tail is at (4,2) or something, not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nSimilarly for (5,6).\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,5) might be under body? But initially, snake body at x=4, y=1-5, (3,5) is at x=3,y=5, not under, and as snake moves, it doesn't cover (3,5) until I move there.\n\nSo safe to eat.\n\nTherefore, for turn 16, I should move U to go towards the food.\n\nSimilarly, for subsequent turns.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can output from turn 16 to, say, turn 20, or until I eat.\n\nBut the answer format is to list actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince the food is at (3,5), and I can reach it on turn 19, I can provide turns 16 to 19.\n\nBut think 5+ turns, so maybe up to turn 21.\n\nTurn 16 to 20 is 5 turns.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, action for turn 16: U\n\nThen turn 17: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 18: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: U to (3,5) eat food.\n\nThen turn 20: from (3,5), I need to move, say to (4,5) or (3,6), etc.\n\nIn the sequence above, after turn 19 eat, positions as before.\n\nThen turn 20: I can move to (4,5), for example.\n\nDirection: from (3,5) moving U to (3,5)? Last move was U to (3,5), so direction U.\n\nThen from (3,5), moving R to (4,5) is not reverse, reverse would be D, but D is down, opposite to U.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nBut moving R to (4,5) is perpendicular, ok.\n\nSimilarly, U to (3,6), or L to (2,5).\n\nI think (4,5) is good to go towards the other food.\n\nThen turn 20: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 21: to (5,5) or (4,6), etc.\n\nBut to (5,5) to approach (5,6).\n\n(4,6) might be ok too.\n\nBut (5,5) is closer to (5,6).\n\nFrom (4,5) to (5,5) east.\n\nThen to (5,6) north.\n\nNow, is there any risk?\n\nFor example, when going to (5,5), I need to make sure it's free.\n\nIn turn 20, if I move to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) // tail (4,1)\n\nThen turn 21: move to (5,5)\n\n(5,5) free? Yes.\n\nHead to (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) // tail (3,1), (4,1) removed.\n\nThen turn 22: move to (5,6) eat.\n\nBut I don't need to specify that far.\n\nFor the answer, since it says \"prioritize long-term survival\", going directly to food seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the move on turn 16.\n\nAnother option: if I go L on turn 16, I might go around, but it takes more turns and might be riskier with obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), to (2,2), to (2,3), then to (3,3), to (3,4), to (3,5), as before, but on turn 21, whereas going up I eat on 19.\n\nSo better to go up.\n\nPerhaps I can consider if moving left allows me to eat both foods in a better way, but (5,6) is on the right, so going left first is away.\n\nSo I think U is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 16, action U.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, since I need to provide multiple, I can say:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 18: U (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 19: U (to (3,5) eat)\n\nThen turn 20: R (to (4,5))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer format, I need to list the actions.\n\nThe state has only two foods, both positive, so after eating, I need to find other food or just survive, but no other food mentioned, so I should survive as long as possible.\n\nBut since no other food, after eating both, I just need to not die.\n\nBut for now, with the given, I can plan to eat (3,5) then (5,6).\n\nIn the actions, I can provide until turn 20 or 21.\n\nSince think 5+ turns, from turn 16 to 20 is 5 turns.\n\nTurn 16,17,18,19,20: 5 actions.\n\nTurn 16: action for t1, t1+1=17, etc.\n\nt1=16, so turns 16 to 20.\n\nActions: 16:U, 17:U, 18:U, 19:U, 20:R\n\nBut on turn 20, after eating at 19, moving to (4,5).\n\nIs there any issue with direction?\n\nOn turn 19, moving U to (3,5), so direction U.\n\nThen turn 20, moving R to (4,5), not opposite, so ok.\n\nIf I want to go to (3,6), but (3,6) might lead to corner.\n\n(3,6) to (3,7) wall, so only left or right, but with long body, might be tight.\n\nGoing to (4,5) is better to go to the other food.\n\nSimilarly, turn 21: to (5,5), but I don't need to include.\n\nFor the answer, I think 5 actions are enough.\n\nBut let's see if all moves are valid.\n\nTurn 16: from (3,1) U to (3,2): free, no wall, no body.\n\nAfter move, positions ok.\n\nTurn 17: from (3,2) U to (3,3): free, positions: head (3,3), body (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) // tail (4,3)\n\nEarlier I had (4,3), yes.\n\nTurn 18: from (3,3) U to (3,4): free, positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) // tail (4,2)\n\nTurn 19: from (3,4) U to (3,5): has food, eat, so positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) // 7 segments, tail (4,2)\n\nTurn 20: from (3,5) move R to (4,5): (4,5) is free? Yes, not occupied, no obstacle.\n\nAfter move, no food, so tail moves: head to (4,5), body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) // tail (4,1), (4,2) removed.\n\n(4,2) was tail, removed.\n\nNow, all good.\n\nThen I can continue to (5,5) etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I think this is fine.\n\nPerhaps I should include one more to show going to second food.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nNow, the internal obstacle at (5,1), but at y=1, not affecting (5,5).\n\n(6,4) at y=4, not issue.\n\n(6,1) at y=1.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: R\n\nBut on turn 20, moving R to (4,5), which is towards (5,6).\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 19, head at (3,5), then to (4,5).\n\nYes.\n\nTo be precise, I should write the actions.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, the head direction: after turn 19 move U, direction U, then turn 20 move R, which is right, perpendicular, ok.\n\nNo reverse.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while ensuring long-term survival, I will plan at least 5 turns ahead (turns 16 to 20). The strategy prioritizes eating the closer positive food at (3,5) first, as it has a shorter remaining life span (available until turn 22) and is reachable in 3 moves. After eating this food, the snake will grow to length 7, and the next move will position it to approach the second food at (5,6) (available until turn 25) while avoiding collisions and dead ends.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Current State (Turn 16)**:\n  - Snake head at (3,1), direction left (L).\n  - Possible moves: Up (U) to (3,2) or Left (L) to (2,1). Down (D) is invalid (y=0 wall), and Right (R) is invalid (instant reverse from L).\n  - Moving Up (U) directly towards (3,5) is efficient and safe, avoiding obstacles and body collisions.\n- **Path to (3,5)**:\n  - From (3,1), moving U for 3 turns (turns 16, 17, 18) reaches (3,4) on turn 18. Then, moving U to (3,5) on turn 19 eats the food.\n  - This path is collision-free: cells (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) are free (no walls, obstacles, or body segments).\n  - After eating, snake grows to length 7 on turn 19.\n- **Path to (5,6) after Eating (3,5)**:\n  - On turn 20, from (3,5), move Right (R) to (4,5) to position towards (5,6). This avoids moving into the body (e.g., Down to (3,4) is body) or toward walls (Up to (3,6) is possible but less direct; Left to (2,5) is viable but delays reaching (5,6)).\n  - (4,5) is free (no body, walls, or obstacles), and moving R is valid (not reverse; last direction was U).\n- **Obstacle and Collision Avoidance**:\n  - Internal obstacles (e.g., (2,4)) block leftward movement at y=4, but the path avoids this area.\n  - After turn 19, the body segments are vertical from (3,1) to (3,5), leaving space to the right for movement.\n  - No tail reward danger: (3,5) is not on the tail, and eating it is safe.\n- **Long-Term Survival**:\n  - Eating (3,5) on turn 19 scores +1 and increases length, improving reach for future food.\n  - Moving to (4,5) on turn 20 sets up a path to (5,6) (via (5,5) on later turns), which can be eaten by turn 22–23.\n  - The grid has space to maneuver after eating both foods (e.g., moving to (5,6) then to (6,6) or (4,6) to avoid walls).\n\n### Action Plan (Turns 16 to 20):\n- **Turn 16**: Move Up (U) to (3,2) – Begins direct path to (3,5); avoids leftward dead end near obstacles.\n- **Turn 17**: Move Up (U) to (3,3) – Continues path; cell is free.\n- **Turn 18**: Move Up (U) to (3,4) – Positions for eating (3,5) next turn; cell is free.\n- **Turn 19**: Move Up (U) to (3,5) – Eats positive food (+1 score, length increases to 7); no risks.\n- **Turn 20**: Move Right (R) to (4,5) – Prepares for (5,6) approach; valid move (not reverse), and cell is free.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats at least one food by turn 19 and positions for the second by turn 20, while minimizing risk. Beyond turn 20, the snake should continue toward (5,6) (e.g., via (5,5)) to maximize score.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 17, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n\nWalls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so the playable area is inside, from (1,1) to (6,6). But there are internal obstacles too: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n\nSnake positions: Head at (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is Up, which is U, meaning moving towards increasing y, so from (3,2) to (3,3) would be up, but current head is at (3,2) and direction is U, so it was moving up to get there? Positions are listed head first, so at turn 17, head is at (3,2), and before that it was at (3,1) I think? Let's see the positions: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]. Since head is first, at turn 17, head is (3,2), and the previous head was at (3,1) which is now the second segment. Since direction is U, it moved from (3,1) to (3,2), so up to (3,2).\n\nNow, food: two items:\n\n- (3,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,6) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive food, value 1, so eating them increases length by 1. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (3,5), life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 17, life span 6 means it will disappear after turn 17 + 6 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nIf countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it will be gone at turn t + L.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span L, it can be eaten on turns t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nBut the countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, countdown = L, turn t+1, countdown = L-1, ..., turn t+L-1, countdown = 1, then at turn t+L, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for the other food.\n\nHere, turn 17, food at (3,5) has life span 6, so countdown starts at 6 on turn 17, will disappear after turn 22 (since 17+6=23? Let's calculate: on turn 17, countdown=6; turn 18, cd=5; turn 19, cd=4; turn 20, cd=3; turn 21, cd=2; turn 22, cd=1; it can be eaten until turn 22, disappears at turn 23. Turn 17 + 6 = 23, but since it decreases including current, on turn 17, it has 6 turns left including this one, so last chance to eat is turn 17 + 5 = 22? I'm getting confused.\n\nStandard way: if life span is N at turn t, it means it will disappear after N more turns, so it exists for N turns starting from t. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N.\n\nFor (3,5) at t=17, L=6, can be eaten turns 17 to 22, gone at 23.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) L=9, can be eaten turns 17 to 25, gone at 26.\n\nBoth are positive, so good to eat.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nCurrent snake head at (3,2), direction U, so last move was up to (3,2).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nNo instant reverse: current direction is U, so I cannot move down (D) on the next turn, because that would be opposite.\n\nAlso, cannot move into walls or obstacles.\n\nFirst, list all blocked cells.\n\nWalls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x,y are walls. But since playable area is inside, we care about the grid.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n\nSo blocked cells: all border cells and these points.\n\nFor movement, I can only go to cells within (1,1) to (6,6) except obstacles.\n\nList all forbidden cells:\n\n- x=0 or x=7 for any y\n\n- y=0 or y=7 for any x\n\n- Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nAlso, snake body is occupied, so I cannot move into body segments except the tail, because when I move, the tail moves away.\n\nCollision: if head touches body segment, it dies, but if it moves to the tail position, it's ok because the tail moves forward.\n\nCurrent snake positions: [(3,2) head, (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) tail?]\n\nPositions: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (3,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,4) tail.\n\nWhen the snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nSo if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, body follows, tail leaves its cell.\n\nTherefore, at the moment, the cells occupied by snake are: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nBut after move, if head moves to (x,y), then new positions: head at (x,y), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) and (4,4) is gone if no food.\n\nSo the cell (4,4) will be free after move if no food eaten.\n\nSimilarly, if food eaten, tail stays.\n\nNow, for collision, after move, head should not be on any body segment except that the tail might be moving.\n\nSpecifically, when moving, head cannot go to a cell that will be occupied by the body after the move, except that it can go to the current tail position because the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, current tail is (4,4). If head moves to (4,4), then since tail moves away (unless food eaten), it should be ok, but only if no food is eaten there or something? Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to the tail cell is safe, because the tail moves, so head and tail don't collide.\n\nBut if you eat food, then the tail doesn't move, so if you move to a food on the tail, it might cause collision? The rule has a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, for moving to tail cell, if it has food, and you eat it, then tail doesn't move, so head is on the same cell as the new tail? Let's think.\n\nSuppose tail is at position T, and head moves to T to eat food. After eating, head is at T, and since food eaten, tail stays, so the segment that was the tail is still there, and a new segment is added at head? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was or something? I need to recall.\n\nTypically in snake, when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment. So the new position has head at food, and the old tail remains, so the segment that was the tail is still part of the body.\n\nFor example, positions: before move, head at H, tail at T.\n\nIf no food, head moves to new position N, tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment, so T is free.\n\nIf food at F, head moves to F, and tail stays, so the snake grows: positions are [F, H, ..., T], so T is still there.\n\nNow, if F is the current tail position, and head moves to F to eat food, then after move, head is at F, and since food eaten, tail stays, so the segment that was tail is still at F? But head is also at F? That would be collision.\n\nYes, that's the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nThe rule says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nIn this case, head must be adjacent to tail, meaning next to it, and tail cell has food, so if head moves to tail cell to eat, then after eating, head and tail are on the same cell? But positions should be distinct.\n\nWhen head moves to the food cell, if that cell was occupied by tail, and you eat, then after move, head is at that cell, and the tail segment is still there, so they occupy the same cell, which is collision.\n\nHence, it's deadly.\n\nBut if the tail cell has no food, moving to it is safe because tail moves away.\n\nIn this state, tail is at (4,4), and there is no food there, so moving to (4,4) would be safe if possible.\n\nBut (4,4) is currently occupied, but since tail will move, it's ok to move there.\n\nNow, back to possible moves from (3,2) with direction U.\n\nPossible directions: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut cannot do instant reverse, so since last move was U (to here), I cannot move D (down) immediately.\n\nSo forbidden: D.\n\nPossible: U, L, R.\n\nNow, check each:\n\n- U: up to (3,3)\n\nIs (3,3) valid? Not wall, not obstacle, not body except tail.\n\nCheck if occupied: current positions: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(3,3) is not in this list, so free. Also, not wall or obstacle. Obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (3,3) clear.\n\n- L: left to (2,2)\n\n(2,2): x=2, y=2. Borders: x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=2 is ok, y=2 ok. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so should be free. Also, not in snake positions: snake has (3,2), etc., no (2,2). So (2,2) should be free.\n\n- R: right to (4,2)\n\n(4,2) is currently occupied by a body segment. Positions: (4,2) is the fourth segment, index 3: (4,2)\n\nSince it's not the tail, moving to (4,2) would cause collision because after move, head at (4,2), but the segment that was at (4,2) will move to... let's see.\n\nAfter move, if head goes to (4,2), which is currently occupied by segment 3.\n\nIf no food eaten, head moves to (4,2), then the body: segment 0 (old head) moves to segment 1 position? Positions after move:\n\nNew head at (4,2)\n\nThen the new body: first segment is old head position (3,2), second is (3,1), third is (4,1), fourth is (4,2)? (4,2) is where head is now, but it was segment 3.\n\nThe positions: before move: [H: (3,2), B1: (3,1), B2: (4,1), B3: (4,2), B4: (4,3), T: (4,4)]\n\nAfter moving head to (4,2):\n\n- Head to (4,2)\n\n- Then B1 to (3,2) (old head)\n\n- B2 to (3,1) (old B1)\n\n- B3 to (4,1) (old B2)\n\n- B4 to (4,2) (old B3) but (4,2) is now head, so collision? Old B3 was at (4,2), and head is moving to (4,2), so when head moves to (4,2), the segment B3 is still there, so head collides with B3.\n\nTherefore, moving to a body segment that is not the tail causes collision.\n\nOnly moving to tail is safe if no food or if food but not adjacent? Tail reward danger only if adjacent and food.\n\nIn this case, for (4,2), it's a body segment, not tail, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nTherefore, R to (4,2) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, D is invalid because reverse.\n\nSo only possible moves: U to (3,3) or L to (2,2)\n\nNow, food locations: (3,5) and (5,6)\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5, which is up from head (3,2), so y=3,4,5.\n\nHead at (3,2), U to (3,3), then (3,4), then (3,5) to eat, but need to see if path is clear.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nAlso, life spans: (3,5) L=6, so must be eaten by turn 22, current turn 17.\n\n(5,6) L=9, by turn 25.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, let's consider the options.\n\nFirst, if I go U to (3,3), that seems safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go U again to (3,4), or L to (2,3), or R to (4,3), or D, but D might be reverse depending on direction.\n\nAfter moving U to (3,3), direction becomes U, so cannot D next.\n\nSimilarly, if I go L to (2,2) first.\n\nBut (2,2) might be near obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (1,2) and (2,4), etc.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nSince both foods are positive, I should try to eat them, but with survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, since walls at 0 and 7.\n\nPlayable: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(1,2) is on border? x=1,y=2, which is playable, but obstacle, so blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) blocked, etc.\n\nNow snake: head (3,2), body: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nSo the snake is mostly vertical on x=4 from y=1 to 4, and head at (3,2) with a turn.\n\nFood at (3,5) and (5,6).\n\n(3,5) is directly above at y=5, x=3.\n\n(5,6) at x=5,y=6.\n\ny=6 is near top wall, y=7 wall, so y=6 is playable.\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,2):\n\n- U to (3,3): free\n\n- L to (2,2): free, as we thought.\n\nBut is (2,2) free? Let's confirm.\n\nCells: (2,2) - not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is obstacle, (1,2) obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\nSnake positions: no (2,2), so yes free.\n\nNow, if I go U to (3,3), what next?\n\nAt (3,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,4), L to (2,3), R to (4,3), D down to (3,2) but reverse, forbidden.\n\n(3,4) : is it free? Currently, snake has (4,4) at tail, but (3,4) not occupied. Not wall or obstacle. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) not, so free.\n\n(2,3): similarly, should be free.\n\n(4,3): currently occupied by segment (4,3), which is body, not tail. If I move to (4,3), it would be collision, since not tail.\n\nAfter moving to (3,3), the snake positions will be: head at (3,3), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and tail (4,4) gone? If no food eaten.\n\nAt turn 17, no food eaten yet, so when I move from (3,2) to new position, say (3,3), then new positions: head (3,3), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) and (4,4) removed, so tail is now (4,3).\n\nOriginal positions: [ (3,2)H, (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)T ]\n\nAfter move to (3,3) no food: new [ (3,3)H, (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ] so tail is (4,3)\n\nThen from (3,3), moving to (4,3) would be moving to the tail cell? (4,3) is now the tail.\n\nIf I move to (4,3), which is tail, and no food there, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nBack to choice at turn 17.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,3)\n\nThen at turn 18, head at (3,3), direction U.\n\nFrom there, I can:\n\n- U to (3,4): free\n\n- L to (2,3): free\n\n- R to (4,3): which is tail, so safe if no food.\n\n(4,3) has no food, so safe.\n\nThen to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is free, and then from there to (3,5) to eat food.\n\n(3,5) has food, so if I go to (3,4), then next to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut (3,5) has life span 6, so I can eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, the other food at (5,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is farther.\n\nNow, option 2 at turn 17: move L to (2,2)\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nBut (2,2) has obstacle at (1,2) left, and (2,4) above but not adjacent.\n\nPossible moves from (2,2): U to (2,3), D to (2,1), R to (3,2), L to (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\nD to (2,1): is (2,1) free? Not border, not obstacle: obstacles (5,1), (6,1), etc., (2,1) not listed, so free? But y=1 is not border, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,1) and (6,1), not (2,1), so (2,1) should be free.\n\nBut snake: after moving to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) and tail (4,4) gone? Original: after move from (3,2) to (2,2), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) — tail (4,3)\n\nThen from (2,2), moves:\n\n- U to (2,3): free? (2,3) not occupied, not obstacle.\n\n- D to (2,1): free? (2,1) should be free, but let's see if occupied. After move, positions: (2,2)H, (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) so (2,1) not occupied, and not obstacle, so free.\n\n- R to (3,2): (3,2) is now the first body segment, so moving to it would be collision, not tail.\n\n- L to (1,2): but (1,2) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo possible: U or D.\n\nBut D to (2,1) might be risky, near bottom, and obstacles.\n\ny=1 is bottom row, with obstacles at (5,1) and (6,1), but (2,1) is free.\n\nHowever, moving down might lead to dead end.\n\nSince I need to eat food, going left might not be efficient for reaching (3,5) or (5,6).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is up and a bit right from (2,2).\n\nBut from (2,2), going U to (2,3), then I can go to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle! (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so blocked.\n\nSo from (2,3), I cannot go to (2,4), so I have to go left, right, or down, but not up on x=2.\n\nThat could be a problem.\n\nTherefore, moving L to (2,2) might lead to a trap, since above (2,3) I can go to (1,3) or (3,3), but (1,3) might be near wall or obstacle.\n\n(1,3): x=1,y=3. x=1 is not wall, walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is playable, but (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut from (2,3), I can go to (1,3) or (3,3) or D to (2,2) but reverse if direction U, etc.\n\nBut it might be messy.\n\nWhereas going U directly seems better for reaching (3,5).\n\nMoreover, (3,5) has shorter life span, 6 turns left, so I should prioritize eating it soon.\n\n(5,6) has 9 turns, more time.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so more body to manage.\n\nNow, let's plan a path.\n\nFirst, from (3,2), if I go U to (3,3) at turn 17.\n\nThen turn 18, at (3,3), I can go U to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nThen turn 19, at (3,4), go U to (3,5) to eat the food.\n\n(3,5) has food, so I eat it, snake grows.\n\nNow, at turn 19, head moves to (3,5), eats food, so new positions: head at (3,5), then old head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) and tail stays? Original positions before move to (3,5): after turn 18, head at (3,4)? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 17: move U to (3,3), no food, so positions: [ (3,3)H, (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ] tail at (4,3)\n\nTurn 18: move U to (3,4), no food at (3,4)? Food at (3,5), so no, move to (3,4), no food, so positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) and tail (4,3) gone? Segments: after move, head to (3,4), then body: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) and (4,3) removed, so tail is (4,2)? List:\n\nBefore turn 18 move: positions [ (3,3)H, (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)T ]\n\nAfter move to (3,4) no food: head to (3,4), then body: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) — and (4,3) removed, so tail is (4,2)\n\nPositions: [ (3,4)H, (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nNow turn 19: move to (3,5) to eat food.\n\n(3,5) has food, so move head to (3,5), eat food, so snake grows: positions: head (3,5), then old head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) — and since food eaten, tail stays, so the segment (4,2) is still there.\n\nNew positions: [ (3,5)H, (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ] so 7 segments.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), direction U (since moved up).\n\nNow, from here, I need to go somewhere.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4) but reverse forbidden, L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\n(3,6): y=6, which is below y=7 wall, so playable, not wall.\n\nNot obstacle, should be free.\n\n(2,5): x=2,y=5, not border, not obstacle (obstacles (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not, so free.\n\n(4,5): similarly free.\n\nBut (4,5) might be near body or something, but not occupied now.\n\nAlso, the other food at (5,6).\n\nNow, (5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (4,5) then to (5,5) then to (5,6), but need to check.\n\nFirst, life span of (5,6) is 9, so by turn 25, plenty of time.\n\nBut after eating (3,5), the snake is longer, so more constraints.\n\nI need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, at (3,5), I can go U to (3,6), but y=6 is top, so from (3,6), I can only go L, R, or D, not U.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is also top.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) blocked, so column x=2 is blocked at y=4, so I cannot go up on x=2 beyond y=3.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 has (1,2) blocked, so x=1 is tricky.\n\nx=6 has (6,4) and (6,1) blocked.\n\nx=5 has (5,1) blocked.\n\nSo the grid has some restrictions.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) at turn 19.\n\nThen at turn 20, head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\nD is reverse, forbidden.\n\nNow, (3,6): top row, from there, I can go L to (2,6), R to (4,6), or D to (3,5) but reverse later.\n\n(2,6): x=2,y=6, should be free.\n\n(4,6): x=4,y=6, free.\n\nBut I have food at (5,6), so I might want to go right towards it.\n\nBut from (3,5), going R to (4,5) first.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go to (5,5) or (4,6) or (4,4) etc.\n\n(4,4) might be free now, but let's see.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nSo (4,3) is free, (4,4) free, etc.\n\nAt turn 20, from (3,5), if I go R to (4,5), which is free.\n\nThen head to (4,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 21, from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) but reverse forbidden, R to (5,5)\n\n(4,6): y=6, top.\n\n(4,4): should be free.\n\n(5,5): should be free.\n\nThen to reach (5,6), from (4,5), go U to (4,6), then from (4,6) to (5,6)? (5,6) is at x=5,y=6, so from (4,6) to (5,6) is right.\n\nBut (5,6) is adjacent.\n\nFrom (4,5), I could go directly to (5,5) if possible, then to (5,6).\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5, which should be free.\n\nNo obstacles there.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (5,6) to eat.\n\nBut (5,6) has food, so eat at (5,6).\n\nNow, time: current turn 17.\n\nAfter going U to (3,3) at t17, U to (3,4) at t18, U to (3,5) eat at t19.\n\nThen at t20, from (3,5) go R to (4,5)\n\nThen t21, from (4,5) go R to (5,5)? Or U to (4,6)?\n\nTo reach (5,6), I need to be at (5,5) or (4,6) or (5,6) directly.\n\n(5,6) can be reached from (5,5), (4,6), (6,6) or (5,7) but y=7 wall, so only (5,5), (4,6), (6,6)\n\n(6,6) might be blocked or not.\n\nFirst, from (4,5), if I go R to (5,5) at t21.\n\n(5,5) should be free.\n\nThen at t22, from (5,5) go U to (5,6) to eat.\n\n(5,6) has life span 9, so at t22 it can be eaten, since t17 to t25.\n\nt17 + 8 = t25? t17: L=9, disappears at t17+9=26, so can eat t17 to 25.\n\nt22 is fine.\n\nSo eat at t22.\n\nBut earlier, (3,5) was eaten at t19.\n\nNow, but in this path, I need to go from (4,5) to (5,5) at t21.\n\nIs (5,5) accessible? Yes.\n\nBut let's check for obstacles or body.\n\nAt t20, positions after moving to (4,5): before move at t20, head at (3,5), move R to (4,5), no food at (4,5), so positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) — tail is (4,2) or something.\n\nAfter eating at t19: positions [ (3,5)H, (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nt20: move to (4,5), no food, so head to (4,5), then body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) and (4,2) removed, so positions: [ (4,5)H, (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) ]\n\nt21: move to (5,5), no food? (5,5) no food, so head to (5,5), then body: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) and (4,1) removed? Segments: [ (4,5)H, (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)T ]\n\nAfter move to (5,5) no food: head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — and (4,1) removed, so tail (3,1)\n\nt22: move to (5,6) to eat, since (5,6) has food.\n\nHead to (5,6), eat, so grow: positions [ (5,6)H, (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ] and tail (3,1) stays? After eating, tail doesn't move, so new segment, positions: head (5,6), then old head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — so 8 segments.\n\nNow, head at (5,6), top right.\n\nFrom there, I need to find a way out.\n\nPossible moves: from (5,6), direction U? Last move was up to (5,6), so direction U.\n\nCannot D down.\n\nCan L to (4,6), R to (6,6), or D but reverse forbidden.\n\n(4,6): should be free, not occupied.\n\n(6,6): x=6,y=6, not border, but internal obstacle (6,4), not (6,6), so should be free? But (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,6) different, so free.\n\nBut (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,6) ok.\n\nHowever, (6,6) might be near walls.\n\nBut I can go to (4,6) or (6,6).\n\nBut the snake body is from (5,5) down to (3,1), so it's occupying left and down.\n\nI need to avoid colliding.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), if I go L to (4,6), which is free.\n\nThen from there, I can go down or left, etc.\n\nBut it might be tight.\n\nSince I ate both foods, I can just survive.\n\nBut long-term, I need to keep playing, but the goal is to maximize score, so I should eat more food if possible, but no other food mentioned, so I need to survive to eat future food, but not specified.\n\nIn this state, only two food, so after eating, I should avoid dying.\n\nBut in the path above, I ate both quickly.\n\nBut let's see if this is safe.\n\nAt turn 17, if I go L to (2,2) instead.\n\nBut earlier I thought it might be worse.\n\nGo to (2,2) at t17.\n\nThen positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) tail? After move: from [ (3,2)H, ... ] move to (2,2), no food, so [ (2,2)H, (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ] tail (4,3)\n\nThen at t18, from (2,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), R to (3,2) but collision, L to (1,2) obstacle, so only U or D.\n\nIf U to (2,3), which is free.\n\nThen head to (2,3), direction U.\n\nThen t19, from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle! Cannot.\n\nL to (1,3), R to (3,3), D to (2,2) reverse forbidden.\n\nSo possible: L to (1,3) or R to (3,3)\n\n(1,3): should be free, but near (1,2) obstacle.\n\n(3,3): free.\n\nIf I go R to (3,3), then similar to before.\n\nBut I missed the chance to eat (3,5) directly.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,3), then to (3,4) etc, but slower.\n\nFor example, t17: L to (2,2)\n\nt18: U to (2,3)\n\nt19: R to (3,3)\n\nt20: U to (3,4)\n\nt21: U to (3,5) eat\n\nSame as before but one turn later, t21 vs t19, so worse.\n\nIf at t19 from (2,3) go L to (1,3), then I'm on left, and (1,3) might be dead end.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), I can go U to (1,4), D to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, R to (2,3), L to (0,3) but x=0 wall, so only U or R.\n\nIf U to (1,4), then to (1,5), etc, but far from foods.\n\nSo not efficient.\n\nTherefore, better to go U at t17.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: in this case, not applicable since no food on tail.\n\nAlso, when moving to tail, it was safe.\n\nIn the plan above, when I was at (3,3) after t17, I could have moved R to (4,3), which was tail at that time.\n\nBut in that case, if I go to (4,3), then I might not go directly to (3,5).\n\nBut (4,3) was tail, no food, so safe.\n\nBut then from (4,3), I can go U to (4,4), but (4,4) was free? At that time.\n\nBut (4,4) not food, so no issue.\n\nBut to reach (3,5), I need to go left or up.\n\nBut it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t17: U to (3,3) — wait no, if at t17 I go to (3,3), then at t18 if I go R to (4,3), which was tail.\n\nAfter t17 to (3,3), positions: [ (3,3)H, (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)T ]\n\nt18: move R to (4,3), no food (since no food there), so since moving to tail, safe, head to (4,3), then body: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) and (4,3) removed? Tail moves, so positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) tail (4,2)\n\nThen from (4,3), I can go U to (4,4), L to (3,3) but collision? (3,3) is body, not tail, so cannot, R to (5,3), D to (4,2) reverse forbidden or not.\n\nDirection: after moving R to (4,3), direction R, so cannot L next.\n\nPossible: U to (4,4), R to (5,3), D to (4,2) but (4,2) is now body? Positions: (4,2) is body, and not tail, so moving to (4,2) would collide.\n\nD is down, which is opposite to current direction? Current direction after move is R, so moving D is not reverse? Directions: if moving right, reverse is left; up and down are perpendicular.\n\nThe rule: \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nOpposite: U/D, L/R are opposites.\n\nSo if current direction is R, opposite is L, so I can move U or D, not L.\n\nSimilarly, if U, can L or R, not D.\n\nIn this case, at (4,3), direction R, so I can move U or D or R, not L.\n\nBut R to (5,3), U to (4,4), D to (4,2)\n\nBut (4,2) is occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n\n(4,4) should be free, not occupied.\n\n(5,3) should be free.\n\nSo possible U to (4,4) or R to (5,3)\n\nBut not towards (3,5).\n\nIf go U to (4,4), then to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (3,5) is at x=3, so I need to go left, which might be harder later.\n\nTherefore, better to go directly to (3,5) first.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,6), I can go after.\n\nIn the first plan, I eat (3,5) at t19 and (5,6) at t22.\n\nBut at t22, when I eat (5,6), I am at (5,6) with body behind.\n\nThen I need to move, say to (4,6) or (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is free, but let's see the obstacles.\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, so row y=4 at x=6 blocked, but y=6 ok.\n\nAlso, (5,1) obstacle, but not relevant.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can go L to (4,6), then to (4,5) but (4,5) might be occupied.\n\nAfter eating (5,6) at t22, positions as before: head (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\n(3,1) is tail.\n\nNow, if I go L to (4,6), which should be free.\n\nThen head to (4,6), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go L to (3,6), D to (4,5), U forbidden (wall), R to (5,6) reverse forbidden.\n\n(3,6) might be free, (4,5) is occupied? At that time, (4,5) is body segment.\n\nAfter move to (4,6), positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) tail (3,1)\n\n(4,5) is body, so moving to (4,5) would collide.\n\nBut I can go to (3,6), which is free? (3,6) not occupied, not wall.\n\ny=6, x=3.\n\nThen from (3,6), I can go L to (2,6), D to (3,5), but (3,5) is body, collision, or R to (4,6) reverse.\n\nLast move to (3,6) from (4,6)? If I go to (3,6) from (4,6), direction L.\n\nThen at (3,6), direction L.\n\nThen moves: L to (2,6), D to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, cannot, U wall, R to (4,6) reverse forbidden.\n\nSo only L to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) should be free.\n\nThen to (2,6), and so on.\n\nBut I can survive.\n\nTo avoid this, after eating (3,5), instead of going right immediately, I could go up to (3,6) first.\n\nFor example, at turn 20, from (3,5), instead of R to (4,5), go U to (3,6).\n\nThen at (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen moves: L to (2,6), R to (4,6), D to (3,5) reverse forbidden.\n\nSay go R to (4,6).\n\nThen to (4,6), then to (5,6) to eat, but (5,6) is at (5,6), so from (4,6) to (5,6) is right.\n\nBut (4,6) to (5,6) at some turn.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nt19: eat at (3,5), positions: [ (3,5)H, (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nt20: move U to (3,6), no food, so head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) and (4,2) removed? Positions: after move, head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) tail (4,1)\n\nt21: from (3,6), go R to (4,6), no food, so head (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) and (4,1) removed, so positions [ (4,6)H, (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ]\n\nt22: move to (5,6) to eat? (5,6) is adjacent right, but from (4,6) to (5,6) is right.\n\nHead to (5,6), eat, so grow: positions [ (5,6)H, (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ] tail (3,1)\n\nNow, head at (5,6), similar situation.\n\nBut the body is on the left, from (4,6) to (3,1).\n\nThen I can go down or left, but left might be blocked.\n\nFrom (5,6), go L to (4,6), but (4,6) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nGo R to (6,6), which should be free.\n\nThen to (6,6), direction R.\n\nThen from there, go D to (6,5), etc.\n\n(6,5) should be free, then to (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle! Oh, (6,4) is internal obstacle, so cannot go to (6,4).\n\nSo from (6,6), I can go D to (6,5), L to (5,6), but reverse forbidden, U wall.\n\nSo only D to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) free.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go D to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, cannot; L to (5,5), or R to (7,5) but x=7 wall, so only L to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) might be free or not.\n\nAt that time, positions: after moving to (6,6) at t23? Let's not digress.\n\nIn both cases, after eating both, I can maneuver, but it might be tight.\n\nBut since the grid has space, I should be able to survive.\n\nFor the immediate action, going U at t17 is fine.\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns? The answer format is to list actions for several turns.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo I need to specify actions for turn 17, 18, 19, etc., up to say 5 turns or more.\n\nBut I should not commit too far if uncertain.\n\nSince the food is close, I can plan to eat (3,5) first.\n\nSo for turn 17: U\n\nThen turn 18: U to (3,4)? At turn 18, from (3,3), I should go U to (3,4) to reach (3,5).\n\nThen turn 19: U to (3,5) eat.\n\nThen at turn 20, from (3,5), I need to decide.\n\nTo go to (5,6), I can go R to (4,5), then to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut to be safe, I can go to open space.\n\nSince (5,6) has longer life, I can go to (3,6) first to have more space.\n\nBut y=6 is top, so limited.\n\nAnother idea: after eating (3,5), I can go L to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n\n(2,5) is free, and from there, I can go to (2,6) or down, but (2,4) obstacle, so I cannot go below y=4 on x=2.\n\nx=2, y=4 obstacle, so from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5) but body, etc.\n\nBut (1,5) might be free.\n\nBut complicated.\n\nPerhaps better to go right towards (5,6).\n\nI think for now, at turn 17, U is best.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to list actions.\n\nLet me write for turns 17 to 21 or so.\n\nTurn 17: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 18: U to (3,4)  // assuming no food\n\nTurn 19: U to (3,5) eat food\n\nThen turn 20: from (3,5), go R to (4,5)  // to go towards (5,6)\n\nTurn 21: from (4,5), go R to (5,5)  // or U to (4,6), but to (5,5) is better for direct path\n\nTurn 22: from (5,5), go U to (5,6) eat\n\nBut at turn 22, I eat (5,6).\n\nBut I need to think if this is safe.\n\nAt turn 20, when I go to (4,5), the positions are as before.\n\nBut after that, when I go to (5,5) at t21, then to (5,6) at t22.\n\nNow, at t22 after eating, head at (5,6), body down to (3,1), so I have space below to move.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), I can go to (6,6) or (5,5) but (5,5) is body, cannot, or (4,6) body? After eating, positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nSo (4,6) and (6,6) free.\n\n(5,5) occupied.\n\nSo I can go R to (6,6) or L to (4,6).\n\nIf go R to (6,6), then from there, as before, go D to (6,5), then L to (5,5) but occupied, so to (5,5) not possible, so L to (5,5) not, only to (5,5) or other, but (5,5) occupied, so must go to (6,5), then from (6,5), go L to (5,5) but occupied, or D to (6,4) obstacle, so stuck? (6,5) to (5,5) is left, but (5,5) is body, cannot; to (6,4) obstacle; to (7,5) wall; so only possible if (5,5) is free, but it's not.\n\nProblem.\n\nAfter t22 eat at (5,6), positions: [ (5,6)H, (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ]\n\nIf I move to (6,6), head to (6,6), no food, so positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) and (3,1) removed, so tail (3,2)\n\nPositions: [ (6,6)H, (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) ]\n\nNow from (6,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nCan move D to (6,5), L to (5,6) reverse forbidden, U wall.\n\nSo D to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) free.\n\nThen at (6,5), can move D to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, cannot; L to (5,5), but (5,5) is body, occupied, cannot; R to (7,5) wall; U to (6,6) reverse forbidden.\n\nNo move! Dead.\n\nOh, big problem.\n\nTherefore, going to (6,6) is deadly.\n\nAfter eating at (5,6), I should not go to (6,6).\n\nInstead, go L to (4,6) at turn 23 or whenever.\n\nAt turn 22, after eating at (5,6), head at (5,6), I can go L to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is free? At that time, positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\n(4,6) not occupied, so free.\n\nMove to (4,6), no food, so positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) and (3,1) removed, tail (3,2)\n\nThen from (4,6), I can go D to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, cannot; L to (3,6), or U wall, R to (5,6) reverse forbidden.\n\nSo L to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) free.\n\nThen to (3,6), and so on, which is better.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 20, if I go to (4,5), then at turn 21 to (5,5), turn 22 to (5,6) eat.\n\nThen at turn 23, from (5,6) go L to (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) should be free, as above.\n\nThen safe.\n\nTo avoid the issue, after eating (3,5), I should not go directly right, but go up to (3,6) first, then right.\n\nFor example:\n\nt19: eat at (3,5)\n\nt20: U to (3,6)\n\nt21: R to (4,6)\n\nt22: R to (5,6) eat? From (4,6) to (5,6) is right, yes.\n\n(5,6) has food, so eat at t22.\n\nThen positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) tail (3,1)? After move: before t22, positions after t21: let's track.\n\nt19: after eat (3,5): [ (3,5)H, (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nt20: move U to (3,6), no food, so head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) and (4,2) removed, so positions [ (3,6)H, (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) ]\n\nt21: move R to (4,6)? (4,6) from (3,6) is right, yes.\n\n(4,6) no food, so head to (4,6), then body: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) and (4,1) removed, so positions [ (4,6)H, (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ]\n\nt22: move to (5,6) to eat, head to (5,6), eat, so grow: positions [ (5,6)H, (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ] tail (3,1)\n\nThen from (5,6), I can go L to (4,6) but (4,6) is body, cannot; R to (6,6), or D to (5,5), but (5,5) not occupied, free.\n\n(5,5) is free, not body.\n\nPositions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), etc, no (5,5), so (5,5) free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) free.\n\nSo from (5,6), go D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf go D to (5,5), then ok.\n\nOr R to (6,6), then as before, can go D to (6,5), etc, but (6,4) obstacle, so better go D to (5,5).\n\nSo safer.\n\nTherefore, for the sequence, at turn 20, go U instead of R.\n\nIn the answer, I can specify the actions.\n\nNow for turn 17, action U.\n\nThen turn 18 U, turn 19 U.\n\nThen turn 20 U to (3,6)\n\nBut at turn 20, from (3,5), go U to (3,6)\n\nThen turn 21, from (3,6) go R to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 22, from (4,6) go R to (5,6) to eat.\n\nBut (5,6) is at (5,6), so from (4,6) to (5,6) is right, yes.\n\nEat at t22.\n\nThen turn 23, from (5,6) go D to (5,5), for example.\n\nBut I need to output only up to a few turns, or as many as I think.\n\nSince the food (3,5) is eaten at t19, and (5,6) at t22, both with turns to spare.\n\nLife span (3,5) L=6 at t17, so must eat by t22, eaten at t19 ok.\n\n(5,6) L=9, by t25, eaten at t22 ok.\n\nFor the answer, I can list from t17 to t22.\n\nBut the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent t17, so up to t22 is 5 turns? t17, t18, t19, t20, t21: 5 turns, or t17 to t21 is 5 actions? Let's see.\n\nt17: action for turn 17\n\nt17+1=18: action for 18\n\n...\n\nSo for 5 turns ahead, I need actions for t17 to t21, for example.\n\nt17,18,19,20,21: that's 5 actions.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nt17: U\n\nt18: U (to (3,4))\n\nt19: U (to (3,5) eat)\n\nt20: U (to (3,6))  // from (3,5) to (3,6)\n\nt21: R (to (4,6))  // from (3,6) to (4,6)\n\nThen t22 would be next, but not included if I stop at t21.\n\nAt t20, I am at (3,6), then t21 to (4,6), which is not eating (5,6) yet, but I can do that later.\n\nSince (5,6) has time, it's fine.\n\nTo include eating, I need more turns.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can provide the actions I decide.\n\nPerhaps output for t17 to t21.\n\nBut at t21, I am at (4,6), and (5,6) is adjacent, so next move can eat.\n\nBut not in the output.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nTo be precise, let's define the actions.\n\nSo for turn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U  // to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: U  // to (3,5) eat\n\nTurn 20: U  // to (3,6)\n\nTurn 21: R  // to (4,6)\n\nThen from there, later I can go to (5,6).\n\nBut in the sequence above, at turn 20, I go U to (3,6), which is fine.\n\nNow, about the initial move: at turn 17, only U or L possible, and U is better.\n\nIs there a reason to go L? Only if I want to avoid something, but not really.\n\nFor example, if I go L to (2,2), then I might be trapped, as earlier.\n\nSo U is better.\n\nTherefore, I think the actions are:\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: R\n\nBut at turn 20, from (3,5) to (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 21, from (3,6) to (4,6), direction R.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd for survival, after that, I can go to (4,6) then to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll output these.\n\nThe format is to box the actions.\n\nAlso, need to specify the turn numbers.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating the positive food at (3,5) first, due to its shorter life span (6 turns remaining, must be eaten by turn 22), while also setting up a path to reach the food at (5,6) later. The plan avoids collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body, and considers the movement constraints (no instant reverse).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 17)**:\n  - Snake head at (3,2), direction U (up).\n  - Possible moves: U (to (3,3)), L (to (2,2)), or R (to (4,2)), but R leads to body collision (not tail), and D is invalid (reverse move). L to (2,2) risks dead ends near obstacles (e.g., (2,4) obstacle blocks upward path). U is safest and direct toward (3,5).\n- **Food Prioritization**:\n  - (3,5): Life span 6, must be eaten by turn 22. Eating it at turn 19 maximizes efficiency.\n  - (5,6): Life span 9, can be eaten up to turn 25. After eating (3,5), the path to (5,6) is planned via (3,6) and (4,6) to avoid tight spaces.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turns 17–19**: Move directly up to eat (3,5) by turn 19.\n  - **Turns 20–21**: Move to (3,6) then (4,6) to position for reaching (5,6) later, avoiding the risk of trapping the snake in the right side near obstacles (e.g., (6,4)).\n  - **Beyond Turn 21**: The snake can continue to (5,6) (e.g., turn 22: R to (5,6)) and then maneuver downward to open space for survival.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - Moving to tail (e.g., (4,3) at turn 18) is safe only if no food is present (not applicable here).\n  - Tail Reward Danger: Not triggered, as no food is on the tail.\n  - Obstacles and walls are avoided (e.g., (2,4) obstacle blocks leftward paths early).\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 17–21):\nThe sequence eats (3,5) efficiently and positions the snake to eat (5,6) soon after, while keeping the snake in open areas for long-term survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: R\n} \n\n### Explanation of Each Move:\n- **Turn 17 (U)**: Move up to (3,3). This avoids the dead-end risk of moving left and positions the snake toward (3,5). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 18 (U)**: Move up to (3,4). Continues the path to (3,5). Direction remains U.\n- **Turn 19 (U)**: Move up to (3,5) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 7). Direction remains U.\n- **Turn 20 (U)**: Move up to (3,6). This avoids moving right immediately into potential body congestion and gains space near the top. Direction remains U.\n- **Turn 21 (R)**: Move right to (4,6). Positions the snake to approach (5,6) in the next turn (turn 22: R to (5,6) to eat), while keeping the body clear of obstacles. Direction becomes R.\n\n### Beyond Turn 21:\n- **Turn 22**: Move R to (5,6) to eat the second positive food (if still present; life span allows). This scores another +1.\n- **Survival Focus**: After eating, the snake should move downward (e.g., to (5,5)) to avoid top-row traps and navigate toward open areas (e.g., center or left side), ensuring long-term survival for future food. The grid has space (e.g., rows y=1-3 are less cluttered), but obstacles require careful pathing.\n\nThis plan eats both foods within their life spans ( (3,5) at turn 19, (5,6) at turn 22) and maintains flexibility for 5+ turns of safe movement.",

        "step": 18,
        "score": 5,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent state at turn 18:\n\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and borders are deadly. Internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I need to avoid these too.\n\n- Snake positions: Head at (3,3), then body segments: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved up to (3,3) from (3,2) last turn? Positions are given as a list, head first. So from (3,3) to (4,3), but let's list them in order:\n\nSnake: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nPlotting this:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Next: (3,2) — directly below head\n\n- Then (3,1) — below that\n\n- Then (4,1) — right of (3,1)\n\n- Then (4,2) — above (4,1)\n\n- Tail: (4,3) — above (4,2)\n\nSo the snake is coiled. Head at (3,3), then down to (3,2), down to (3,1), right to (4,1), up to (4,2), up to (4,3). So (4,3) is the tail.\n\nHead direction is Up, so it was moving up to reach (3,3). From (3,2) to (3,3) was up, so current direction is U.\n\nFood:\n\n- (3,5) with value 1 and life span 5. So it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn. Since current turn is 18, it will disappear after turn 22 (18+5-1? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 18, life span is 5, meaning it has 5 turns left including turn 18. So it will be there until turn 22, and gone by turn 23? Countdown: on turn 18, life=5; turn 19, life=4; ... turn 22, life=1; turn 23, life=0, disappears. But since it can be eaten only when life>0, I think it can be eaten up to turn 22. Similarly for the other food.\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life span is N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns, from turn t to turn t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N.\n\nFor (3,5): at turn 18, life=5, so it will be there from turn 18 to 22, disappear at turn 23.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) with value 1 and life span 8. At turn 18, life=8, so it will be there from turn 18 to 25 (18+8-1=25), disappear at turn 26.\n\nBoth foods have value 1, so positive food.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for the next few turns. The answer format says to output actions for turns starting from t1=18 onwards, for several turns. But it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan a sequence of actions.\n\nFirst, I should assess the current position and possible moves.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,3), direction U (up).\n\nPossible moves from here: I can move Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n\nMovement constraints: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is U, I cannot move Down (opposite) on the next turn. So from (3,3), with dir U, I can move U, L, or R. Not D.\n\nNow, let's see what cells are occupied or dangerous.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so I cannot go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake body: positions [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nSo the cells occupied by snake: (3,3) head, (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nBut when I move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves, so the body segments shift. But for collision, I need to consider where the body will be after movement.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed, unless food is eaten, in which case tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten yet, so when I move, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n\nSo for collision check: after moving, if head collides with body or wall, it dies.\n\nBut note: it's safe to move into the tail's current position because the tail will move away, so that cell becomes free.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to the current tail position, since tail moves forward, head and tail won't collide; instead, the tail leaves that cell as head enters, so no collision.\n\nBut if head moves to a body segment that is not the tail, it collides.\n\nAlso, walls and obstacles.\n\nNow, food: (3,5) and (5,6)\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5, which is two cells above head (3,3), so (3,4) and (3,5). But (3,4) might be empty or not.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nI need to see if I can reach food safely.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. So 8x8 grid? x=0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, but borders are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\n\"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" — these are walls, so I cannot move to cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But internal obstacles are given, so some cells are blocked.\n\nList all wall cells:\n\n- All cells with x=0 or x=7 for any y\n\n- All cells with y=0 or y=7 for any x\n\nPlus internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo, for example, (5,1) is an obstacle, but y=1 is not border since y=0 and y=7 are borders, y=1 is inner, but (5,1) is specifically blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is blocked, and since x=6, y=1, but x=6 is not border? Borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable except for obstacles.\n\nClarify:\n\n- Border walls: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7) — all these are walls.\n\n- Internal obstacles: additional cells that are walls: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(6,1) is listed, but (6,1) might be on the border? x=6, y=1: since y=1, not 0 or 7, and x=6 not 0 or 7, so it's inner but obstacle. Similarly, (5,1) inner obstacle.\n\nNow snake positions: head at (3,3), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is tail.\n\nFood: (3,5) at (3,5), and (5,6) at (5,6)\n\n(3,5) is directly above head at (3,3), so positions: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (3,4) is empty? Let's see what cells are free.\n\nList all occupied cells:\n\nWalls:\n\n- Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n\n- Internal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSnake: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nSo occupied: snake positions and walls.\n\nFree cells: all other cells from (1,1) to (6,6) except the above.\n\nFor example, (3,4): not wall, not snake, so free.\n\n(3,5) has food, but it's a cell, can be moved to.\n\nNow, from head (3,3), possible moves without immediate death:\n\nCan move U, D, L, R but no reverse, so not D.\n\nCurrent dir U, so can move U, L, R.\n\nMove U to (3,4): what is (3,4)? Free? Yes, as above. After moving, snake head to (3,4), body becomes: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)] and tail (4,3) is removed? Positions: new head at (3,4), then previous head (3,3) now body, then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3) is gone. But (4,3) was tail, and it moves off.\n\nNow, (3,4) is free, so no collision. Also not wall.\n\nMove L to (2,3): (2,3) is x=2,y=3, not border, not obstacle? Obstacles are (1,2),(2,4),etc. (2,3) not listed, so free? Snake positions: (3,3) head, (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) — no (2,3), so free. So can move L to (2,3).\n\nMove R to (4,3): (4,3) is currently occupied by the tail. But moving to tail position is safe because tail will move away. Specifically, if I move R to (4,3), which is the current tail, after move, head is at (4,3), body: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)] and the old tail (4,3) is now head, but (4,2) was the segment before tail, so new body from (3,3) to (4,2), and (4,3) is head, so no collision because the tail was there but moved? Let's think.\n\nWhen head moves to (4,3), which was occupied by tail, but simultaneously, the tail is removed or moves. In snake, when head moves to a new cell, the tail is cut off, so the cell is vacated just as head enters, so no collision with tail.\n\nSimilarly, if head moves to a body segment, it collides only if it's not the tail.\n\nHere (4,3) is tail, so moving to it is safe.\n\nNow, after move, the new positions: head at (4,3), which was tail, but now head, then (3,3) becomes next, etc., down to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) was body, now it will be part of body, but (4,3) is head, so no issue.\n\nCannot move D, reverse not allowed.\n\nSo possible actions: U, L, R.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and survival.\n\nFood at (3,5): above, at (3,5). If I move U now to (3,4), I can then move U again to (3,5) to eat it on turn 19.\n\nTurn 18: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: from (3,4), can move U to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nFirst, check if eating at (3,5) is dangerous.\n\n(3,5) is food with value 1, positive, so eating it will increase length by 1.\n\nNow, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake.\n\nHere, tail is at (4,3), head at (3,3), not adjacent. After moving to (3,4), head at (3,4), tail at (4,2)? Let's see positions after turn 18 move.\n\nTurn 18: start, snake: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nAfter move U to (3,4): new head (3,4), body: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). Tail is (4,2).\n\n(4,3) is removed.\n\nSo positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nNow, head at (3,4), tail at (4,2). Are they adjacent? (3,4) and (4,2): not adjacent; adjacent means same row or column, one cell away, so |dx|=1 and dy=0 or |dy|=1 and dx=0.\n\n(3,4) and (4,2): dx=1, dy=2, not adjacent. Distance is sqrt(2) >1, so not adjacent.\n\nNow, on turn 19, if I move U to (3,5), I eat the food at (3,5).\n\nSince I eat food, snake grows, so after eating, head moves to (3,5), and tail does not move, so the body becomes: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)] — length increases by one.\n\nNow, is there any danger? Tail is at (4,2), head at (3,5), not adjacent.\n\nBut I need to check if (3,5) is safe to move to.\n\n(3,5) has food, so moving to it is fine.\n\nAfter eating, the food disappears, and I have a longer snake.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nThere's also food at (5,6), which has longer life span, 8 turns left.\n\nBut (3,5) has only 5 turns left, including this turn? At turn 18, life=5, so it must be eaten by turn 22.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) has life=8, so by turn 25.\n\nNow, if I go for (3,5), I can eat it on turn 19.\n\nBut is it the best move? I need to consider risks.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid around.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\n(1,2) is left bottom, (2,4) is left middle, etc.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), snake will be longer, and I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nBut let's first consider immediate moves.\n\nAnother option: move R to (4,3) now.\n\nTurn 18, move R to (4,3), which is current tail.\n\nAfter move: head at (4,3), body: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)] tail at (4,2).\n\n(4,3) was tail, now head.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nBut (4,3) is now head, and I can move U, D, L, R, but current direction after move? After moving R, direction is R, so cannot move L (opposite) next turn.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,3), direction L.\n\nBut let's think about reaching food.\n\nFood at (5,6): to reach (5,6) from (3,3), I need to go right and up.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), move R to (4,3), then from (4,3) move U to (4,4), then R to (5,4), etc., but need to go to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nNow, there is an obstacle at (6,4), (5,1), etc.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nBut let's see if I can plan a path to (5,6).\n\nFirst, I should consider the life span. (3,5) will disappear sooner, so I might want to eat it first if possible.\n\nBut let's simulate moving to (3,5).\n\nTurn 18: move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 19: move U to (3,5), eat food. Score +1, snake grows to 7 segments.\n\nPositions after turn 19: head at (3,5), body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) — since I ate food, tail didn't move, so body includes (4,2) and previous.\n\nAfter eating: head to (3,5), then the segment that was head becomes body, so (3,4) is new body, then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). And since I ate, no tail removed, so (4,2) is still there.\n\nSo positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nNow, head at (3,5), direction U (since moved up).\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U, D, L, R. But no reverse, so cannot move D (opposite of U).\n\nCan move U, L, R.\n\nMove U to (3,6): but y=6, and y=7 is border, y=6 is not border? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. (3,6) is free? Not wall, not snake, so yes.\n\nBut if I move U to (3,6), then I am at top row, y=6, which is adjacent to wall y=7, but y=7 is wall, so (3,6) is ok, but I have to be careful not to hit wall.\n\nMove L to (2,5): (2,5) free? Not wall, not snake. Obstacle at (2,4), but (2,5) is different.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, (2,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, move R to (4,5): (4,5) free? Not occupied.\n\nBut after turn 19, snake body includes (3,4), (3,3), etc., but not (4,5), so free.\n\nNow, I need to think about the other food at (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is near the top-right.\n\nFrom (3,5), to reach (5,6), I can move R to (4,5), then R to (5,5), then U to (5,6), for example.\n\nBut (5,5) and (5,6) need to be free.\n\nCurrently, after turn 19, positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nSo (4,5) is free, (5,5) free, (5,6) has food.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (6,4), which is below, and (5,1), but not in the way directly.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle (6,4), (6,1), but (6,4) might affect paths.\n\nNow, if I go to (3,6), that might be risky because top row has less space.\n\ny=6 is the second last row, since y=7 is wall.\n\nBut I can move left or right from there.\n\nBut let's think about survival with longer snake.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,5) is only available for a few turns, but since I can eat it on turn 19, it's fine.\n\nBut what if I don't go for it now? For example, if I move R or L on turn 18.\n\nSuppose turn 18 I move R to (4,3).\n\nThen positions: head at (4,3), body: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)] tail at (4,2).\n\nDirection now R.\n\nThen turn 19, from (4,3), can move U, D, R? Cannot move L (opposite of R).\n\nMove U to (4,4): (4,4) free? Yes.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut to get to (3,5), I would need to go left and up, but from (4,3), moving U to (4,4), then L to (3,4), then U to (3,5), but that takes more turns.\n\nTurn 18 move R to (4,3), turn 19 move U to (4,4), turn 20 move L to (3,4), turn 21 move U to (3,5) to eat. But on turn 21, food at (3,5) still there? Life span: at turn 18 life=5, so turn 18,19,20,21,22 present, disappear turn 23. So on turn 21, it is there.\n\nBut I eat on turn 21, which is fine, but later than if I go directly.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L on turn 18 to (2,3), then I am away from both foods.\n\n(2,3) is left, and I have obstacle at (2,4) above, (1,2) below-left, so might be constrained.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacle: (2,4) is listed, so (2,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo from (2,3), after move L on turn 18, head at (2,3), direction L.\n\nThen turn 19, can move U, D, L (not R, reverse not allowed).\n\nMove U to (2,4)? But (2,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nMove D to (2,2): (2,2) free? Not wall, not snake. Obstacle at (1,2), but (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\nMove L to (1,3): (1,3) free? x=1, y=3, not border (borders x=0,7 y=0,7), not internal obstacle (obstacles (1,2), but (1,3) different, so free? (1,2) is obstacle, (1,3) should be free, but y=3, x=1.\n\nx=1 is not border, border is x=0.\n\nSo (1,3) is playable.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (1,2), so from (1,3), I might be limited.\n\nAlso, to get to food, it might take longer.\n\nSo moving L might not be efficient for getting food soon.\n\nTherefore, moving U or R might be better.\n\nNow, back to moving U on turn 18 to go for (3,5).\n\nBut after eating (3,5), I am at (3,5) with longer snake, and I need to navigate.\n\nMoreover, there is another food at (5,6) with longer life, so I can go for that next.\n\nBut let's see the grid to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) after eating, if I move U to (3,6), then at (3,6), I can only move L or R, not D (since I moved U, direction U, no reverse).\n\nIf I move R to (4,6), then to (5,6), but (5,6) is food.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), so from (3,6), move R to (4,6), then R to (5,6)? (4,6) to (5,6) is R, but (4,6) to (5,6) is east.\n\nBut (4,6) might be free.\n\nFirst, after turn 19, head at (3,5), body (3,4) to (4,2) as above.\n\nThen if move U to (3,6): (3,6) free? Yes.\n\nThen positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) — tail at (4,2).\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow at (3,6), y=6, which is high, x=3.\n\nCan move L to (2,6), R to (4,6), or U to (3,7) but y=7 is wall, cannot move U.\n\nAlso, cannot move D, reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nMove L to (2,6): (2,6) free? Not wall, not snake. Obstacle at (2,4), but (2,6) different, so free.\n\nSimilarly, move R to (4,6): free.\n\nIf I move R to (4,6), then from (4,6), I can move U? Cannot, y=7 wall. Move D? But direction R, so if I move R to (4,6), direction R, then next cannot move L.\n\nFrom (4,6), can move R to (5,6), but (5,6) is food, so I can eat it.\n\nTurn 20: from (3,6) move R to (4,6)\n\nThen positions: head at (4,6), body (3,6), (3,5), etc. down to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 21: from (4,6), direction R (since moved right), can move R to (5,6), which is food, eat it.\n\nThen score another +1, snake grows to 8 segments.\n\nPositions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) — since ate, no tail remove.\n\nBut (4,2) is tail, and it's far.\n\nNow, head at (5,6), which is near corner. x=5,y=6, and there is obstacle at (6,4), but (6,4) is below.\n\nFrom (5,6), I need to move. Can move D, L, R? Direction after moving R to (5,6) is R, so cannot move L.\n\nCan move U? y=7 wall, cannot. Move D to (5,5), or R to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is x=6,y=6, not border, but internal obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), but (6,6) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free.\n\nBut if I move R to (6,6), then at (6,6), I can move U? Cannot, wall. Move D to (6,5), or L? But direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nMove D to (6,5): (6,5) free? Not wall, not snake.\n\nThen from (6,5), can move D to (6,4), but (6,4) is obstacle, cannot. Or move L to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut it might get tight.\n\nSince I have a long snake, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nAfter eating at (5,6), I am at (5,6) with head, and body around.\n\nBut let's see the path I took.\n\nIn this scenario, I ate both foods quickly: (3,5) on turn 19, (5,6) on turn 21.\n\nBut on turn 21 after eating (5,6), head at (5,6), and I need to move.\n\nPossible moves: from (5,6), after moving R to it, direction R, so can move U? Cannot, wall. Move D to (5,5), or R to (6,6).\n\nIf I move R to (6,6), then at (6,6), only can move D to (6,5) (since no U, no L), then from (6,5), can move D to (6,4) but obstacle, or L to (5,5), or U? But U is (6,6), which is body now, cannot. Moves from (6,5): can move U, D, L, R but constraints.\n\nAfter moving to (6,6), direction R, so from (6,5)? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 21: after eating (5,6), head at (5,6), body: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) — tail at (4,2).\n\nNow turn 21, I move R to (6,6)? (6,6) is free, I assume.\n\nMove to (6,6), then new head (6,6), body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), ... down to (4,2), but since I didn't eat, tail (4,2) is removed? When I move to (6,6), I don't eat food, so tail moves.\n\nAfter moving to (6,6): head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) — and (4,2) removed.\n\nTail at (4,1).\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow at (6,6), can move U? Cannot, wall. Move D to (6,5)? Or R to (7,6) but x=7 wall, cannot. So only D or ... cannot move L, reverse not allowed.\n\nSo must move D to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is free? Not wall, not snake, yes.\n\nMove to (6,5), then head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), etc. down to (4,1), tail at (4,1)? After move, positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) — (4,1) is body, tail is (4,1) or? List: from head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) — so tail at (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is obstacle? Internal obstacles include (5,1) and (6,1), but (4,1) is not listed, and not border, so it was snake position, but now it's tail.\n\n(4,1) is not obstacle; obstacles are (5,1), (6,1), etc., so (4,1) is free cell, but occupied by snake now.\n\nFrom (6,5), I moved D, direction down.\n\nCan move L, R, D? Cannot move U, reverse not allowed.\n\nMove L to (5,5), or R? x=7 wall, cannot R. Move D to (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) should be free.\n\nMove to (5,5), then head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), etc. down to (3,1), (4,1) tail? Positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) — tail at (4,1).\n\nDirection L (since moved left from (6,5) to (5,5)).\n\nThen from (5,5), can move U, D, L, R? Cannot move R, reverse.\n\nCan move U to (5,6), but (5,6) is where food was, but eaten, so free, but now it might be body? After we ate (5,6) on turn 21, it became head, then we moved to (6,6), so (5,6) is body.\n\nIn positions, (5,6) is occupied by body.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is head, move U to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, collision.\n\nMove D to (5,4), or L to (4,5), or R? Cannot.\n\nMove L to (4,5): (4,5) free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the space might be limited, especially with obstacles.\n\nFor example, the area around (5,5) has obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), etc., but (5,4) might be free.\n\nBut it could be risky.\n\nIn this path, I ate both foods, but then I might be in a tight spot.\n\nPerhaps I should not go to (3,6) but from (3,5) after eating, move R instead of U.\n\nOn turn 19 after eating (3,5), head at (3,5), I can move R to (4,5) instead of U.\n\n(4,5) free.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6), then R to (5,6), etc.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nFrom (4,5), move to (4,6), then to (5,6).\n\nBut when I eat (5,6), I am at (5,6), which is cornered.\n\nTo avoid that, from (3,5), after eating, I could move L to (2,5) or something.\n\nBut (2,5) is free, but there is obstacle at (2,4), so below is blocked.\n\nMove L to (2,5), then I can move U to (2,6), or L to (1,5), etc.\n\nBut then I am away from the other food.\n\nThe other food at (5,6) has longer life, so I can take my time.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nAnother option: on turn 18, instead of moving U, I move R to (4,3) to position for the other food.\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nTurn 18: move R to (4,3)\n\nThen positions: head (4,3), body (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) tail at (4,2)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 19: can move U, D, R (not L)\n\nMove U to (4,4): free\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (5,6), I need to go right.\n\nFrom (4,4), move R to (5,4), but (5,4) free? Not obstacle, not snake.\n\nThen from (5,4), move U to (5,5), then U to (5,6) to eat.\n\nBut (5,5) and (5,6) need to be free.\n\nCurrently on turn 19, after moving to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) tail at (4,2)\n\n(4,2) is tail.\n\nThen turn 20: move R to (5,4)? From (4,4) to (5,4) is R.\n\n(5,4) free? Yes.\n\nThen head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,3), etc. down to (4,2) removed? Move to (5,4), no eat, so tail removed, body: head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) tail at (4,1)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 21: move U to (5,5): (5,5) free? Yes.\n\nHead (5,5), body (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) tail at (4,1)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 22: move U to (5,6), eat food at (5,6).\n\nSo ate on turn 22.\n\nMeanwhile, the food at (3,5) is still there until turn 22, but on turn 22, I am eating (5,6), so I might not eat (3,5).\n\nIf I want to eat both, I need to go to (3,5) first or later.\n\nBut (3,5) has shorter life, so if I don't eat it by turn 22, it disappears.\n\nIn the first approach, I ate it on turn 19.\n\nIn this, I am not eating it.\n\nBut I can eat (5,6) on turn 22.\n\nThen I have score from one food.\n\nBut I missed (3,5).\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, I can go for (3,5) quickly.\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nAnother thing: the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nIn the first scenario, when I ate (3,5), tail was at (4,2), not adjacent, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for (5,6).\n\nBut let's consider if there is any case where it could be dangerous.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but here foods are not under snake, I think.\n\n(3,5) is free, (5,6) free.\n\nNow, to prioritize long-term survival, with the snake coiled, I might want to uncoil or something.\n\nFor example, by moving R to (4,3), I am moving towards the center or something.\n\nBut the grid has obstacles, so I need to be careful of dead ends.\n\nLet me sketch the grid quickly.\n\nGrid 8x8, but borders walls, playable 1-6 in x and y? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, since x=0,7 and y=0,7 walls.\n\nCells: (1,1) to (6,6)\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSnake: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nFood: (3,5), (5,6)\n\nFree spaces.\n\nFor example, area around (3,3): (3,4) free, (2,3) free, (4,3) is tail but can move to, etc.\n\nNow, if I move U to (3,4) on turn 18, then U to (3,5) on turn 19 to eat, as before.\n\nThen from there, to avoid being cornered at top, I could move L or R on turn 20.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5) on turn 19, head at (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) on turn 20.\n\n(2,5) free.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move U to (2,6), or L to (1,5), or D to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nOr move R back to (3,5) but occupied.\n\nDirection: after moving to (3,5) on turn 19, I moved U, so direction U.\n\nTurn 20, from (3,5), can move U, L, R (not D)\n\nMove L to (2,5): (2,5) free, move to it.\n\nThen head (2,5), body (3,5), (3,4), etc. down to (4,2) tail? Positions: after move, head (2,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) tail at (4,2)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 21, from (2,5), can move U to (2,6), L to (1,5), or D? But cannot, reverse not allowed, so not R.\n\nMove U to (2,6): (2,6) free.\n\nThen at (2,6), can move U? Cannot, wall. Move L to (1,6), or R to (3,6), but direction U, so after moving U, direction U, then turn 22 cannot move D.\n\nFrom (2,6), move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nSay move R to (3,6), then from (3,6), can move R to (4,6), etc. towards (5,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is still there, life span 8, so on turn 22 it has life=8-4=4? Turn 18 life=8, turn 19:7, turn20:6, turn21:5, turn22:4, so still many turns.\n\nI can go to (5,6) later.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the left-top area might be cramped with obstacle at (2,4).\n\nFor example, from (2,6), if I move L to (1,6), then at (1,6), x=1,y=6, can move D to (1,5), or L to (0,6) but x=0 wall, cannot, or U wall cannot. So only D or R, but direction after moving L, so cannot move R.\n\nIf I moved L to (1,6), direction L, then from (1,6) can move U? Cannot, D to (1,5), or L? Cannot, so only D.\n\nMove D to (1,5), then from (1,5), can move D to (1,4), or L? Cannot, or R to (2,5), but (2,5) might be body.\n\nIt might be messy.\n\nTo maximize score, eating both foods is good, and since (3,5) expires soon, I should eat it first.\n\nThen with the longer snake, I can manuever to eat the other food.\n\nBut after eating both, the snake is longer, and the grid has obstacles, so I need to have an escape route.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) after eating, instead of going up to (3,6), I could go down or left.\n\nBut from (3,5), I cannot go down immediately because no reverse; I just moved U to (3,5), so direction U, cannot move D.\n\nSo I have to move U, L, or R.\n\nMoving U to (3,6) might lead to corner, so better to move L or R.\n\nSay move R to (4,5) on turn 20.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6), then R to (5,6) on turn 22.\n\nTurn 19: eat at (3,5), head (3,5)\n\nTurn 20: move R to (4,5)  -- direction R\n\nTurn 21: from (4,5), can move U to (4,6) -- (4,6) free, move U\n\nDirection U\n\nTurn 22: move R to (5,6) but from (4,6) to (5,6) is R, so move R to (5,6) to eat.\n\nThen head at (5,6), same as before.\n\nThen I need to move away.\n\nFrom (5,6), after moving R to it, direction R, so can move D to (5,5), or R to (6,6) but cannot move L.\n\nMove D to (5,5), then to (5,4), etc.\n\n(5,5) is free, then to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (6,4), so I can go down to bottom.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) move D to (5,4), then to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut snake body is behind, so as long as I don't hit myself.\n\nWith obstacles, it might be ok.\n\nTo think 5+ turns ahead, I should output a sequence for several turns.\n\nSince the answer format is to list actions from turn 18 onwards for a few turns.\n\nBut I need to specify how many turns? It says \"...\" so probably for 5 turns or so.\n\nTurn 18 to 22 or 23.\n\nLet's decide on turn 18 action.\n\nI think moving U to go for the closer food (3,5) is reasonable, since it has short life.\n\nThen turn 19 eat it.\n\nThen turn 20, from (3,5), move R to (4,5) to position for (5,6)\n\nThen turn 21 from (4,5) move U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 22 from (4,6) move R to (5,6) to eat.\n\nThen turn 23 from (5,6) move D to (5,5) to avoid corner.\n\nBut let's confirm if all moves are safe.\n\nFirst, turn 18: move U to (3,4)\n\nCurrent positions: snake [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nAfter move U: head to (3,4), body: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) -- tail at (4,2)\n\n(4,3) removed.\n\nNo collision, not wall.\n\nTurn 19: move U to (3,5) -- eat food. Now, (3,5) has food, so eating: head to (3,5), body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) -- no tail remove, so snake length 7.\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nHead at (3,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 20: move R to (4,5) -- (4,5) is free? Not wall, not snake, yes.\n\nAfter move: head to (4,5), body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) -- tail at (4,2)? Since no eat, tail (4,2) removed? When moving, if not eat food, tail moves.\n\nMove to (4,5), no food there, so tail removed: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) -- tail at (4,1)\n\nDirection R (since moved right).\n\nTurn 21: move U to (4,6) -- (4,6) free, move U.\n\nAfter move: head (4,6), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) tail at (4,1)? Move to (4,6), no eat, so tail (4,1) removed? Body: head (4,6), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) -- (4,1) removed, tail at (3,1)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 22: move R to (5,6) -- (5,6) has food, so eat. Head to (5,6), body: (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) -- no tail remove, so snake grows to 8 segments. Tail at (3,1)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, from here, I need to move, say turn 23: move D to (5,5) or something.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list up to turn 22 or so.\n\nThe food at (3,5) is eaten, (5,6) eaten, both within life span.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate both.\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U (to eat (3,5))\n\nTurn 20: R (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 21: U (to (4,6))\n\nTurn 22: R (to eat (5,6))\n\nThen beyond, but I think for 5 turns, from turn 18 to 22 is 5 actions: 18,19,20,21,22.\n\nTurn 18 to 22 inclusive is 5 turns.\n\nNow, is this safe? In turn 20, I moved to (4,5), which is free.\n\nTurn 21 to (4,6), free.\n\nTurn 22 to (5,6), eat.\n\nAll moves seem safe.\n\nIf I move L on turn 20 instead, but R is towards the other food.\n\nAlso, in turn 18, if I move R first, I might not get to (3,5) in time.\n\nFor example, if turn 18 move R to (4,3), then turn 19 move U to (4,4), turn 20 move L to (3,4), turn 21 move U to (3,5) to eat on turn 21, which is still within life (turn 22), but later, and I might not have time for (5,6) immediately, but it has longer life.\n\nBut in terms of score, eating both is better.\n\nAlso, with the first sequence, I eat on turn 19 and 22.\n\nNow, to confirm the Tail Reward Danger: when I ate (3,5) on turn 19, tail was at (4,2), head at (3,5), not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly for (5,6), tail at (3,1), head at (5,6), far away.\n\nNo issue.\n\nAlso, no food under body or anything.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: R\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: R\n\nIn the sequence, turn 20 is R to (4,5), turn 21 U to (4,6), turn 22 R to (5,6).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 18: U Turn 19: U Turn 20: R Turn 21: U Turn 22: R }\n\nBut it says \"action on turn t_1, t_1+1, ...\", so for turn 18,19,20,21,22.\n\nAnd actions in {U,D,L,R}.\n\nI think that's fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves 5 turns ahead (turns 18 to 22). The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (3,5) quickly, as it has a short life span (disappears after turn 22) and is reachable in 2 turns.\n- Then, position the snake to eat the positive food at (5,6), which has a longer life span (disappears after turn 25), by turn 22.\n- Avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body by ensuring all moves are safe and adhere to movement constraints (no instant reverse).\n- After eating both foods, the snake will be longer (8 segments), so moves are chosen to avoid dead ends and maintain maneuverability.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 18)\n- **Snake**: Head at (3,3), direction Up. Body segments: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)].\n- **Possible moves from (3,3)**: \n  - Up (U) to (3,4): Safe, as (3,4) is free.\n  - Left (L) to (2,3): Safe, as (2,3) is free.\n  - Right (R) to (4,3): Safe, as moving to the tail position is allowed (tail moves away).\n  - Down (D) is invalid (instant reverse from current Up direction).\n- **Food priorities**: \n  - (3,5) must be eaten by turn 22; it is 2 cells above the head and can be eaten on turn 19 if moving Up now.\n  - (5,6) can be eaten later (by turn 25); moving towards it after eating (3,5) is efficient.\n\n### Planned Sequence (Turns 18-22)\n1. **Turn 18: Move U (Up)** to (3,4).  \n   - Why: Positions the snake to eat (3,5) on the next turn. (3,4) is free and safe. After move, snake: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]; tail at (4,2).\n\n2. **Turn 19: Move U (Up)** to (3,5) and eat the food.  \n   - Why: Eats positive food (+1 score, length increases to 7). (3,5) is safe to eat (tail at (4,2) is not adjacent, so no Tail Reward Danger). After move, snake: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]; tail at (4,2); direction Up.\n\n3. **Turn 20: Move R (Right)** to (4,5).  \n   - Why: Avoids the top row (y=6) which could limit movement. Moves toward (5,6) efficiently. (4,5) is free and safe. After move (no food eaten), snake: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]; tail at (4,1); direction Right.\n\n4. **Turn 21: Move U (Up)** to (4,6).  \n   - Why: Continues path to (5,6). (4,6) is free and safe. After move (no food eaten), snake: [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]; tail at (3,1); direction Up.\n\n5. **Turn 22: Move R (Right)** to (5,6) and eat the food.  \n   - Why: Eats positive food (+1 score, length increases to 8). (5,6) is safe to eat (tail at (3,1) is not adjacent). After move, snake: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]; tail at (3,1); direction Right.\n\n### Long-term Survival Considerations\n- **Beyond turn 22**: From (5,6), move Down (e.g., to (5,5)) to avoid the top-right corner and navigate toward open areas. The grid has obstacles (e.g., (6,4)), but moving down allows access to the bottom rows where there is more space for the longer snake.\n- **Risks mitigated**: \n  - No collisions: All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body segments.\n  - No dead ends: The sequence keeps the snake away from confined spaces (e.g., by not lingering near y=6 after eating).\n  - Food life spans honored: Both foods are eaten within their life spans ((3,5) by turn 19, (5,6) by turn 22).\n- **Score maximized**: Eating both positive foods yields +2 score by turn 22, with potential for more if the snake survives longer.\n\nThis plan ensures efficient food collection while maintaining safety for at least 5 turns.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 18: U Turn 19: U Turn 20: R Turn 21: U Turn 22: R }",

        "score": 5,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 19, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). I must avoid these walls and obstacles.\n\nThe snake positions are: head at (3,4), then body segments at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), and tail at (4,2). So the snake has 6 segments. The head direction is Up, meaning it just moved up to (3,4) from (3,3), I assume.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,5) with value 1 and life span 4. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span is given as 4 at turn 19, so it should last until turn 22? Let me clarify life span.\n\nThe rule says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning on turn t + L, it might be gone. But since countdown decreases every turn including current, if life_span is L at turn t, it will be present for this turn and the next L-1 turns, disappearing at the start of turn t + L or something. I need to be precise.\n\nTypically, if life_span is N at turn t, it means it has N turns left, including turn t. So after N turns, it disappears. For example, at turn t, life_span N: available on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, gone at turn t+N.\n\nHere, turn 19, food at (3,5) has life span 4, so available on turns 19,20,21,22, gone at turn 23.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) with life span 7: available turns 19 to 25.\n\n(1,5) with life span 10: available turns 19 to 28.\n\nAll food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food in this state.\n\nNow, snake head is at (3,4), direction Up. Since it just moved up, I can't move down instantly because of the no instant reverse rule. So possible moves from (3,4) are: Up, Left, Right. Down is opposite to current direction (U), so not allowed.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so from (3,4), moving Up would go to (3,5), Left to (2,4), Right to (4,4).\n\nNow, (3,5) has food! Value 1, and it's positive, so eating it would increase length by 1.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe to eat. There might be risks.\n\nAlso, I need to think 5+ turns ahead for long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\n(6,4) is an obstacle, (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake: head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (4,2). So the snake is like: from (3,4) down to (3,1), then right to (4,1), then up to (4,2). So the tail is at (4,2), which is above (4,1).\n\nPositions: index 0: (3,4) head, 1: (3,3), 2: (3,2), 3: (3,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (4,2) tail.\n\nAfter a move, when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and if it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases. If not, the tail moves forward, so length stays the same.\n\nNow, from (3,4), possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (3,5)\n\n- Down: not allowed, opposite to current U.\n\n- Left: to (2,4)\n\n- Right: to (4,4)\n\nNow, (2,4) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4), yes! So (2,4) is blocked, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is free? Let's see the obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (4,4) is not listed, and not border, so it should be free.\n\n(3,5) has food, but is it under the snake? No, (3,5) is not occupied by snake; snake is at (3,4), (3,3), etc., so (3,5) is empty except for food.\n\nThe rule about food under body: but here (3,5) is not under snake body, so it can be eaten normally by moving head there.\n\nBut there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nHere, tail is at (4,2). Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (3,4), tail at (4,2). Distance: |3-4| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (3,4) and (4,2): not adjacent; they are two cells apart vertically and one horizontally. So not adjacent. Tail is at (4,2), head at (3,4), so not adjacent. Therefore, no tail reward danger here.\n\nNow, moving to (3,5) would eat the food, since it's there. Then snake grows: new head at (3,5), body segments: the current head (3,4) becomes new segment, then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), and tail stays? When eating, head moves to food, new segment added at head position, so positions: new head at (3,5), then previous head (3,4) becomes first body, then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) tail. Length increases to 7.\n\nIf not eating, tail moves away.\n\nBut in this case, moving to (3,5) eats food.\n\nNow, is (3,5) safe? After moving, the head will be at (3,5), and body at (3,4), etc. Collision only if head hits body, but body will move when snake moves, except when growing.\n\nAt the moment of move, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides, but since the body moves, only the tail might be an issue, but generally, if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, it collides.\n\nStandard snake: when moving, head goes to new cell; if that cell is not free (wall or body), collision. But body segments: after head moves, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the only body cell that might cause collision is if head moves to where the neck was or something, but actually, since segments shift, the new head position must not be equal to any of the current body segments except the tail, because the tail will move away.\n\nSpecifically: after moving, the head is at new position, and the body segments are at their new positions: the first body segment is at the old head position, second at old first body, etc., and the tail is removed if not eating, or stays if eating.\n\nFor collision: when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a wall or by a body segment that is not the tail, it dies. If it moves to the tail cell, it might be ok because the tail moves away, unless it's the only segment or something, but in this case, snake has multiple segments.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to tail cell is safe, because tail moves.\n\nBut if moving to a body segment that is not tail, it collides.\n\nAlso, if after moving, the head is at a position where a body segment will be, but since segments shift, it's only a problem if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a non-tail body segment.\n\nIn this case, from (3,4), moving to (3,5): what is at (3,5) now? Food, not body. Snake positions: (3,4) head, (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). So (3,5) is not occupied by snake, so moving to (3,5) is safe, no collision.\n\nThen, after moving, head at (3,5), body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), and tail (4,2) but since we ate food, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). Length 7.\n\nNow, what about other moves? Left to (2,4) is obstacle, cannot move. Right to (4,4) is free, no food, so move there, no growth.\n\nDown not allowed.\n\nSo only possible moves: Up to (3,5) or Right to (4,4).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving Up to (3,5) to eat the food.\n\nAfter that, head at (3,5), direction Up (since we moved up).\n\nThen from there, possible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down not allowed.\n\nUp to (3,6): is that valid? y=6, not wall yet, borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is ok. x=3, ok. No obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (3,6) not listed, so free.\n\nLeft to (2,5): (2,5) - not border, not obstacle, should be free. Obstacles at (2,4), but (2,5) is different cell. (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is y=5, so not the same.\n\nRight to (4,5): similarly, should be free.\n\nNow, food: there is food at (5,6), (1,5), and (3,5) is eaten, so gone.\n\n(3,5) was eaten, so no longer there.\n\nOther food: (5,6) and (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is at x=1,y=5, which is near the left.\n\nAlso, life spans: (5,6) life span 7 at turn 19, so available for a while. (1,5) life span 10.\n\nBut I need to think about the board state after moving.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate a few moves.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating food is good, but avoid risks.\n\nHere, (3,5) is very close, and I can eat it now.\n\nBut let's see if there are dangers.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), head at (3,5), body below: (3,4), (3,3), etc.\n\nIf I move up to (3,6), then from there, I might go to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so (3,7) is wall, cannot move there. y=7 is border, so cell (3,7) is wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nSo from (3,6), possible moves: Up to (3,7) is wall, not allowed. Down not allowed? Direction would be Up, so if I move to (3,6) from (3,5) by moving up, then direction is U, so I can move Left, Right, or Up, but Up to (3,7) is wall, so cannot. Down is opposite, not allowed. So only Left or Right from (3,6).\n\nLeft to (2,6), Right to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) should be free.\n\nBut from (3,5), I have other options: Left to (2,5) or Right to (4,5).\n\nNow, (2,5) has no food, but there is food at (1,5), which is adjacent to (2,5), so I could go there.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is food to the right.\n\nBut let's think about the snake body. After eating at (3,5), the snake is vertical from (3,5) to (3,1), then right to (4,1), then up to (4,2). So it's like a \"L\" shape or something.\n\nPositions: (3,5) head, (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) tail.\n\nFrom head (3,5), if I move left to (2,5), that should be safe. (2,5) is not occupied, no wall.\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction Left.\n\nThen from there, I can move Left to (1,5), which has food! (1,5) has value 1, life span 10.\n\nSo I could eat that.\n\nBut (1,5) is at x=1,y=5, and borders are x=0, so left of (1,5) is (0,5) which is wall, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nSimilarly, if I move right from (3,5) to (4,5), then to (5,5), etc., towards (5,6) food.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), so from (4,5), moving right to (5,5), then up to (5,6) to eat.\n\n(5,6) is food.\n\nBut let's consider the immediate move.\n\nBack to turn 19: I have two choices: Up to (3,5) or Right to (4,4).\n\nIf I go Right to (4,4), I don't eat the food at (3,5), which might disappear if I don't eat it soon, life span 4, so it has 4 turns left including turn 19, so available on 19,20,21,22.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I might eat it later, but it could be risky or I might not get another chance.\n\nBut moving right to (4,4) might be safer for long-term.\n\nAfter moving right to (4,4), head at (4,4), direction Right (since I moved right from (3,4), current direction was U, but I moved R, so new direction R).\n\nThen from (4,4), possible moves: Up, Down, Left? But Left is opposite to current direction R? Current direction after move is R, so I can move U, D, R. Left is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo from (4,4): Up to (4,5), Down to (4,3), Right to (5,4).\n\nNow, (4,5) is free, I think. (4,3): is it free? Snake body: current after move, if I move to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), then previous head (3,4) becomes body, so body at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (4,2).\n\n(4,3) is not occupied? Positions: (4,4) head, (3,4) body, (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) tail. So (4,3) is empty. Similarly, (4,5) empty, (5,4) empty.\n\n(5,4) is not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (5,4) is different.\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4, so (5,4) is x=5,y=4, not the same.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (5,4) is not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) and (4,5) free.\n\nBut (4,3) is below, might be near body.\n\nFood at (3,5) is still there, life span 4, so if I don't eat now, I could come back.\n\nBut if I move to (4,4), then from there, I can move up to (4,5), which is adjacent to (3,5) with food, so on next turn, I could move left to (3,5) to eat it.\n\nFrom (4,4), move up to (4,5), then from (4,5), I can move left to (3,5) since direction would be U, and left is not opposite, so allowed.\n\nThen eat on turn 21.\n\nBut life span: at turn 19, life span 4, so available turn 19,20,21,22. Turn 21 is within, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (4,4) on turn 19, then to (4,5) on turn 20, then to (3,5) on turn 21 to eat.\n\nOn turn 19, if I go right to (4,4), no eat.\n\nTurn 20: from (4,4) move up to (4,5), no eat yet.\n\nThen turn 21: from (4,5) move left to (3,5), eat food.\n\nNow, on turn 21, (3,5) food has life span: started at turn 19 with life 4, turn 20 life 3, turn 21 life 2, so still available.\n\nYes.\n\nBut I need to see if it's safe.\n\nIf I eat on turn 19, I get the food immediately, but I might be in a position where I have fewer options.\n\nFor example, after eating at (3,5), head at (3,5), and I'm at y=5, with walls at y=7, so I have to turn left or right soon.\n\nWhereas if I go to (4,4), I'm more central, and I can access other areas.\n\nBut there's also the food at (5,6) and (1,5).\n\n(1,5) has life span 10, so I have time, but (5,6) life span 7, also time.\n\n(3,5) is the most urgent because life span 4, so if I don't eat it soon, I might miss it.\n\nBut I can eat it on turn 21 as above.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,5) might be under the body? No, currently not, but if I move away, it could be covered, but the rule says food can spawn under body, but here it's not under, so I can eat it directly.\n\nBut if I don't eat it now and move away, the body might cover it, and then to eat it, I need the body to move away and head to move there.\n\nCurrently, if I move right to (4,4), the body will move: after move, head at (4,4), body at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (4,2) moves? When not eating, tail moves away.\n\nOn turn 19, if I move right to (4,4), no eat, so snake moves: head to (4,4), then each body segment moves: the segment that was at (3,4) moves to where? Positions shift: new head at (4,4), then the first body segment is at previous head position (3,4), second at previous first body (3,3), and so on, up to previous fifth body (4,1) at (3,1)? Let's list:\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), tail (4,2).\n\nAfter moving head to (4,4) without eating: new head (4,4), then the body segments: the segment that was at index 1 (3,3) moves to where head was, (3,4). Similarly, index 2 (3,2) moves to (3,3), index 3 (3,1) moves to (3,2), index 4 (4,1) moves to (3,1), and index 5 (4,2) moves to (4,1). The tail (4,2) moves to (4,1), and the cell (4,2) is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). Tail is at (4,1).\n\n(4,2) is now empty.\n\nFood at (3,5) is still there.\n\nOn turn 20, from (4,4), I can move up to (4,5). Direction: after moving to (4,4), direction is R, so from (4,4) move up to (4,5), new direction U.\n\n(4,5) is free, no issue.\n\nThen positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1) moves? No eat, so tail moves: new head (4,5), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). The tail (4,1) is not part of body now? After move, segments: new head (4,5), first body at previous head (4,4), second at previous first body (3,4), third at (3,3), fourth at (3,2), fifth at (3,1), and the previous tail (4,1) is not included since not eating, so tail was (4,1), which moves to where the last body was, but last body was (4,1), which moved to (3,1)? Let's track:\n\nBefore move on turn 20: positions: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1).\n\nAfter moving head to (4,5): new head (4,5), then first body at (4,4) (previous head), second body at (3,4) (previous first body), third at (3,3) (previous second), fourth at (3,2) (previous third), fifth at (3,1) (previous fourth), and the previous tail (4,1) is gone, so the new tail is at (3,1). Length 6.\n\nCell (4,1) is vacated.\n\nNow, food at (3,5) is still present.\n\nThen on turn 21, from (4,5), I can move left to (3,5) to eat the food. Direction is U (from moving up to (4,5)), so moving left is not opposite, allowed.\n\nMove to (3,5), eat food, so head to (3,5), and tail doesn't move, so positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). New segment added, so tail at (3,1).\n\nLength 7.\n\nCompared to eating on turn 19: I would have head at (3,5) on turn 19, with body down to (4,2), but in this case, by eating later, the body is different.\n\nIn terms of score, I get the food on turn 21 instead of turn 19, but I still get it, and I have more space or something.\n\nBut by not eating on turn 19, I avoided being at (3,5) with the body below, which might be constraining.\n\nFor example, if I eat on turn 19, head at (3,5), and I have to move left or right or up, but up to (3,6) is limited, as I can only go left or right from there.\n\nWhereas by going to (4,4) first, I am at (4,4), then (4,5), then I can eat (3,5) and be at (3,5) with direction left or something.\n\nBut similar position.\n\nNow, the food at (1,5) and (5,6) are available.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), which has an obstacle at (1,2), but that's below.\n\nTo reach (1,5), from (3,5), I could go left to (2,5), then to (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) from (4,5) go right to (5,5), then up to (5,6).\n\nBut let's think about the obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, which is at (2,4), so from (2,5) moving down to (2,4) is blocked, but I don't need to go there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) obstacle, but (1,5) is y=5, so ok.\n\nAlso, border walls.\n\nNow, another risk: the snake might trap itself if I go towards the edges.\n\nFor example, if I go to (1,5), I am near x=0, and with the body, I might not have escape routes.\n\nSimilarly for (5,6), near x=7.\n\nBut life spans are long, so I don't need to rush to them.\n\nFirst, for the immediate decision, let's see which move has better long-term potential.\n\nI should consider moving right to (4,4) on turn 19 to avoid being stuck at the top.\n\nBut let's simulate both options.\n\nOption 1: Move Up on turn 19 to (3,5), eat food.\n\nThen turn 19: head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nNow turn 20: from (3,5), possible moves: U, L, R (no D, opposite).\n\nU to (3,6): valid, not wall.\n\nL to (2,5): valid, not obstacle.\n\nR to (4,5): valid.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then at (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 21: from (3,6), possible moves: L or R (U to (3,7) wall, D not allowed).\n\nL to (2,6), R to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) are free.\n\nThen from there, I can go towards other food.\n\nBut I have food at (1,5) and (5,6), which are not directly accessible from here.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), so from (2,6), I could go down to (2,5), then left to (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, from (4,6) to (4,5), then to (5,5), then to (5,6).\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nIf from (3,5) on turn 20, I go L to (2,5).\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 21: from (2,5), possible moves: U, D, L (no R, opposite).\n\nL to (1,5) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nU to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle! Oh, (2,4) is internal obstacle, so I cannot move down to (2,4).\n\nSo from (2,5), I can only move U to (2,6) or L to (1,5), since D to (2,4) is blocked, and R not allowed.\n\nSo I can go to (1,5) to eat, or to (2,6).\n\nIf I go to (1,5) to eat, then head at (1,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 22: from (1,5), possible moves: U, D, L? But L to (0,5) is wall, x=0, not allowed. D to (1,4): is it free? Obstacle at (1,2), but (1,4) is y=4, not listed, so should be free. U to (1,6).\n\nBut since direction is L, moving U or D or L, but L to (0,5) wall, so only U or D.\n\nU to (1,6), D to (1,4).\n\nIf I go D to (1,4), then at (1,4), but (1,4) is not obstacle, but below is (1,3), (1,2) obstacle, so I might be trapped.\n\nPositions: after eating at (1,5), head at (1,5), body: previous positions depend.\n\nLet's not get too deep.\n\nThe point is, going to (1,5) might be risky because of the left wall and obstacle at (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I go U to (1,6) from (1,5), then I have more space.\n\nBut still, the area is tight.\n\nIf from (2,5) on turn 21, I go U to (2,6) instead of eating (1,5), then I can avoid that risk.\n\nBut (1,5) food is there, life span 10, so I can eat it later if I want.\n\nBack to option 1, if on turn 20 from (3,5) I go R to (4,5), then to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut let's consider the other initial choice.\n\nOption 2: on turn 19, move Right to (4,4).\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 20: from (4,4), move U to (4,5) as planned, to set up for eating (3,5).\n\nMove U to (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 21: from (4,5), move L to (3,5), eat food, direction L.\n\nNow head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen from here, similar to before, I can go L to (2,5), or U to (3,6), or D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body? After move, positions: after eating at (3,5), head (3,5), body: previous head (4,5), then (4,4), and so on.\n\nAfter turn 21 move: on turn 21, from (4,5) move to (3,5), eat, so head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), and then the previous body: before move on turn 21, positions were: head (4,5), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1).\n\nAfter moving head to (3,5) with eat, new head (3,5), then first body at (4,5), second at (4,4), third at (3,4), fourth at (3,3), fifth at (3,2), sixth at (3,1). Length 7.\n\nNow, from (3,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nTurn 22: possible moves: U, D, L? But L to (2,5) is not opposite, direction is L, so moving L, U, D are possible. R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo L to (2,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is occupied by body? Current positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So (3,4) is a body segment, not tail. Tail is at (3,1).\n\nIf I move down to (3,4), it is occupied by the third body segment, so collision! Because head moves to a cell with body.\n\nMoving to tail is safe, but (3,4) is not tail; it's a body segment that will be there after the move? When I move head to (3,4), that cell is currently occupied by (3,4), which is not the tail, so it will cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (2,5) or (3,6) should be fine.\n\n(3,6) is up, (2,5) left.\n\nD to (3,4) is invalid because collision.\n\nSo only U or L or R, but R not allowed, so U or L.\n\nU to (3,6) or L to (2,5).\n\nIf I go L to (2,5), then I can go towards (1,5) food.\n\nBut similar risk as before.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then limited.\n\nBut in this path, by eating (3,5) on turn 21, I am at (3,5) with the body to the right and below, so moving down is blocked, which might be a problem.\n\nWhereas if I ate on turn 19, the body was below, so from (3,5), moving down was not an option anyway because of the body or direction.\n\nIn option 1, after eating on turn 19, head at (3,5), body at (3,4), (3,3), etc., so (3,4) is directly below, so moving down to (3,4) would collide immediately, so not possible. Similarly here.\n\nSo both cases, from (3,5), I cannot move down because it's occupied or will be occupied.\n\nIn option 1, after turn 19, positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). So (3,4) is body, so moving down to (3,4) impossible.\n\nSimilarly in option 2 after eating on turn 21, (3,4) is body.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nNow, to avoid being constrained, perhaps it's better not to eat the food at (3,5) at all, but that means losing a point, and it's positive food, so I should eat it if possible.\n\nLife span 4, so I have until turn 22 to eat it.\n\nI could eat it later from a different approach.\n\nFor example, from the current position, if I move right to (4,4), then I can go to (5,4) or something, and come back later.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (3,5) is directly above the head, but there's an obstacle at (2,4), which might affect paths.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize long-term access to the board.\n\nLet's list all free cells or something.\n\nGrid: rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)  -- but after move, it changes.\n\nFood: (3,5), (5,6), (1,5)\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is above head.\n\nTo eat (3,5), I can go up now or later.\n\nBut if I go up now, I might be near the top wall.\n\nIf I go right to (4,4), then I can go to (5,4), (5,5), etc.\n\n(5,6) food is at (5,6), so I can go towards it.\n\n(5,6) has life span 7, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life span 10.\n\n(3,5) has only 4 turns left, so I should eat it within the next few turns.\n\nThe safest way might be to eat it on turn 21 as I thought earlier, by going to (4,4) then (4,5) then (3,5).\n\nOn turn 19, move right to (4,4).\n\nThen on turn 20, from (4,4) move up to (4,5).\n\nThen on turn 21, from (4,5) move left to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThis way, on turn 21, when I eat, the body is not directly below in a way that blocks me, but in the positions, after moving to (4,5) on turn 20, positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nThen move left to (3,5), eat, so head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) -- so (3,4) is body, so from (3,5), moving down to (3,4) is still impossible, same as before.\n\nBut I can move left or up.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nPerhaps I can eat the food later by having the tail move away.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat on turn 19, and I move away, the body moves, so the cell (3,5) might be uncovered, and I can come back when the path is clear.\n\nBut in this case, (3,5) is not covered by body now; it's free with food.\n\nIf I move away, the body might cover it or not.\n\nFor instance, if I move right to (4,4) on turn 19, positions become: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) -- tail at (4,1)? Earlier: after move, head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) and (4,2) moved to (4,1), so tail at (4,1).\n\nCell (3,5) is empty with food.\n\nOn turn 20, if I move to (4,5), then positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) -- (4,1) gone, (3,1) tail.\n\n(3,5) still with food.\n\nThen on turn 21, I move to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThe body is at (3,4), but when I move to (3,5), it's fine.\n\nIf I want to eat from below, but (3,4) is body, so I can't move up from (3,4) because it's occupied.\n\nThe only way to eat (3,5) is to move onto it from left, right, or below, but below is (3,4), which is body, so I can only move from left or right or above, but above is (3,6).\n\nSo from (2,5) or (4,5) or (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is above, but I need to be there.\n\nSo the accessible cells to eat (3,5) are (2,5), (4,5), and (3,6).\n\n(3,4) is occupied, so I can't come from below.\n\nIn the current state, from (3,4), I can move up directly to (3,5) to eat.\n\nOr later, from (2,5) or (4,5) or (3,6).\n\nBut from (3,6), moving down to (3,5) might be possible if the food is there.\n\nBut life span.\n\nSo for now, moving right to (4,4) on turn 19 seems reasonable to position for other moves.\n\nThen on turn 20, from (4,4) I can move up to (4,5) or down to (4,3) or right to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut to eat (3,5), I should go to (4,5) then to (3,5).\n\nI can also consider going to (5,6) food.\n\nLet's think about the tail reward danger, but it doesn't apply here.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,5) might be eaten later, but if I delay, the life span decreases, and I might not get it if something happens.\n\nBut with life span 4, I have until turn 22.\n\nTurn 22 is the last turn it is available.\n\nOn turn 22, if I move to (3,5), I can eat it.\n\nIn the plan, if I go to (4,4) on 19, (4,5) on 20, (3,5) on 21, I eat on 21, before 22.\n\nSafe.\n\nIf I go directly on 19, I eat earlier.\n\nBut in terms of survival, being at (3,5) early might limit my movements.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), I can only go to (2,5), (4,5), or (3,6).\n\n(3,6) then to (2,6) or (4,6).\n\nThen from there, to reach (5,6), I need to go to (4,6) then (5,6) or something.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), so from (4,6) move right to (5,6), but (5,6) is food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (6,4), which is below, not directly in way.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) from (2,5) move left.\n\nBut (1,5) is near wall.\n\nPerhaps the area around (5,6) is safer.\n\nLet's see the obstacles near there.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (6,1), (5,1), so bottom right has obstacles, but (5,6) is top right, y=6.\n\nx=5,y=6.\n\nBorder x=7,y=7 walls.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can move down to (5,5), left to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (6,4), which might block paths if I go down.\n\nBut not immediately.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) near (1,2) obstacle, but again, not direct.\n\nTo maximize long-term, I should avoid the edges and stay central.\n\nCurrently, after moving right to (4,4), I am at (4,4), which is more central than (3,5).\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go to (4,5), (5,4), or (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is down, towards y=0, but not immediately dangerous.\n\nThen I can plan to eat both (3,5) and (5,6) and (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) might be riskier.\n\nSince all food is +1, I should eat as many as possible.\n\nBut survival first.\n\nAnother risk: if I go to (3,5) and eat, then the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver, but with 6 to 7, not a big difference.\n\nGrid is 8x8 with obstacles, but many cells are free.\n\nTotal cells: 64, walls: 4 borders, but each border row or column, but cells, so x=0 all 8 cells wall, x=7 all 8, y=0 all 8, y=7 all 8, but corners shared, so total wall cells: 8*4 - 4 = 32 - 4 = 28? No.\n\nFor an 8x8 grid, border cells: top row y=7, 8 cells; bottom row y=0, 8 cells; left column x=0, but y=1 to 6, 6 cells; right column x=7, y=1 to 6, 6 cells; corners are included in rows, so total border walls: top and bottom: 16 cells, left and right: 12 cells, total 28 border wall cells? Let's calculate:\n\n- Top row (y=7): x=0 to 7, 8 cells\n\n- Bottom row (y=0): x=0 to 7, 8 cells\n\n- Left column, excluding corners (x=0, y=1 to 6): 6 cells\n\n- Right column, excluding corners (x=7, y=1 to 6): 6 cells\n\nTotal border walls: 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 cells.\n\nThen internal obstacles: 5 cells: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo total blocked cells: 28 + 5 = 33.\n\nFree cells: 64 - 33 = 31.\n\nSnake occupies 6 cells, so free space: 31 - 6 = 25 cells, but as snake moves, it changes.\n\nWith snake length 6, and 31 free cells, it's ok for now.\n\nAfter eating, length 7, still 24 free cells, manageable.\n\nSo not too cramped.\n\nFor the decision, I think moving right to (4,4) on turn 19 is better for flexibility.\n\nThen on turn 20, move up to (4,5) to position for eating (3,5).\n\nThen on turn 21, move left to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,5) or (3,6), etc.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so let's outline a plan for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 19: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 20: move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 21: move L to (3,5) eat food\n\nNow, at turn 21, head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 22: from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) or L to (2,5)\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), then at (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 23: from (3,6), only L or R, to (2,6) or (4,6)\n\nSay move R to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 24: from (4,6), direction R? After moving to (4,6) from (3,6) by moving right, so direction R.\n\nThen I can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,7) wall, not possible. D to (4,5), R to (5,6) which has food.\n\n(5,6) has food, so move R to (5,6) to eat.\n\nBut (5,6) is at (5,6), and from (4,6) move right to (5,6), yes.\n\nThen eat on turn 24.\n\nBut life span of (5,6) is 7 at turn 19, so on turn 24, how many turns? Turn 19: life 7, turn 20:6, turn21:5, turn22:4, turn23:3, turn24:2, so available, yes.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 22 from (3,5) I move L to (2,5), then to (1,5) to eat, but riskier.\n\nSo the safer path is to go towards (4,6) and (5,6).\n\nAfter eating at (3,5) on turn 21, I can go to (4,5) if possible, but from (3,5), direction L, I can move R? But R is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed. So I cannot move right to (4,5) directly; only U, D, or L, but D not possible, so U or L.\n\nSo I have to go U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then as above.\n\nI can go L to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6) or L to (1,5).\n\nIf I go to (1,5), I might get stuck.\n\nSo better to go U to (3,6) on turn 22.\n\nThen to (4,6) on turn 23, then to (5,6) on turn 24 to eat.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move down or left, etc.\n\nBut there is also (1,5) food with longer life span, I can get it later if possible.\n\nFor now, this seems a plan.\n\nIf on turn 19 I move up to (3,5), eat immediately, then on turn 20 I can move R to (4,5), for example.\n\nThen from (4,5), direction R (if moved right from (3,5)? From (3,5) move right to (4,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 21: from (4,5), move U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5).\n\nThen I can go to (5,5) then to (5,6) to eat.\n\nSimilar to above.\n\nBut I am at (4,5) instead of (4,6) or something.\n\nNo big difference.\n\nBut by eating on turn 19, I have a longer snake earlier, which might be slightly riskier, but not significantly.\n\nI think both are ok, but moving right first gives me more options to avoid the top row immediately.\n\nFor example, if I eat on turn 19, I am forced to turn left or right from (3,5) or go up to (3,6) and then turn.\n\nBy moving right, I stay lower and can approach the food from different angles.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,5) will be eaten on turn 21, only two turns later, not a big delay.\n\nSo I think moving right on turn 19 is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 19: R\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? The instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but for output, it says to output from turn t1 to some turns, but not specified how many, but in the format, it shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a sequence.\n\nHow many turns? It doesn't specify, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions or so.\n\nIn the answer format, it has \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can provide a sequence starting from turn 19.\n\nLet me define the sequence.\n\nTurn 19: Move R (right) to (4,4)\n\nTurn 20: Move U (up) to (4,5)\n\nTurn 21: Move L (left) to (3,5) and eat food\n\nThen turn 22: From (3,5), direction L, move U to (3,6)  // avoid going left towards wall\n\nTurn 23: From (3,6), direction U, move R to (4,6)  // since only L or R possible, R to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 24: From (4,6), direction R, move R to (5,6) and eat food? (5,6) is at (5,6), from (4,6) move right to (5,6), yes.\n\nAnd (5,6) has food, so eat.\n\nBut on turn 24, life span of (5,6) is 2, as above, available.\n\nThen after that, head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nThen I can move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6) or U to (5,7) wall, not possible.\n\nSo move D to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can provide up to turn 24 or so.\n\nSince the output starts from turn 19, I need to specify actions.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 21, I move L to (3,5), which is eating, but in the action, I just say move, eating is automatic.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 24, move to (5,6) to eat.\n\nNow, for the food at (1,5), I can get it later if possible, but not in this sequence.\n\nLife span 10, so by turn 28, I can go there.\n\nBut for now, this sequence seems safe.\n\nTo think about risks: when I move to (4,6) on turn 23, is it safe? From (3,6) move R to (4,6), should be free.\n\nThen to (5,6), free.\n\nNo obstacles.\n\nAlso, body should not be there.\n\nSimilarly, no tail reward danger.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while prioritizing long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that secures the nearby positive food at (3,5) within its lifespan, avoids immediate risks, and positions the snake to access other food (e.g., (5,6)) safely. The food at (3,5) has a lifespan of 4 (available until turn 22), so it must be eaten by then. Moving directly up to (3,5) on turn 19 is possible but limits future mobility near the top wall (y=7). Instead, moving right to (4,4) on turn 19 provides better central positioning and flexibility. From there, I can approach (3,5) from the side to eat it on turn 21, avoiding the constraint of being at the top row early. After eating (3,5), I will navigate toward (5,6) (lifespan 7, available until turn 25) to eat it around turn 24, while avoiding the left side (near (1,5)) due to risks from walls and obstacles.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Turn 19 Move**: Current head direction is Up, so Down is not allowed. Left to (2,4) is blocked by an obstacle. Only Up or Right are valid. Moving Right to (4,4) avoids the top row and sets up a safer path to eat (3,5) later.\n- **Eating (3,5)**: By moving to (4,5) on turn 20 and then left to (3,5) on turn 21, I eat the food safely without body collision. The body configuration after this move prevents moving down from (3,5), but up or left are viable.\n- **Post-Eating Path**: From (3,5), moving up to (3,6) on turn 22 avoids the left side (toward (1,5)) which has wall and obstacle risks. Then, moving right to (4,6) on turn 23 and (5,6) on turn 24 eats the second food.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 24, the snake can explore the bottom-right area (e.g., moving down to (5,5)) to avoid walls. The food at (1,5) (lifespan 10) can be pursued later if safe, but it is not prioritized here due to edge risks.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: All moves are checked for collisions. For example:\n  - On turn 21, moving left to (3,5) is safe as the cell is occupied by food, not body.\n  - On turn 22, moving up from (3,5) avoids moving down (which would collide with body at (3,4)).\n  - Obstacles and walls are respected (e.g., (2,4) is avoided, and y=7 wall prevents upward moves from (3,6)).\n\n### Planned Move Sequence (Turns 19–24):\nThis sequence eats two positive foods, avoids all risks, and keeps the snake in open areas. I provide 6 turns of actions for clarity, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 20: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 21: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 22: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 23: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 24: R (right)\n}",

        "step": 20,
        "score": 5,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 2D grid. The grid has walls and obstacles, and I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current turn is t = 20. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There are also internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,4), then body segments at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is R, meaning it's moving right, so from (3,4) to (4,4), that makes sense.\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (3,5) with value 1 and life span 3 (so it disappears after 3 turns, including this one, so it will be gone by turn 23?)\n\n- At (5,6) with value 1 and life span 6 (disappears after turn 25?)\n\n- At (1,5) with value 1 and life span 9 (disappears after turn 28?)\n\nAll food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat, but I need to be careful with risks.\n\nLife span: if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So for (3,5), life span 3 at turn 20, so it will be there for turn 20, 21, 22, and gone on turn 23.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) life span 6: present from turn 20 to 25, gone on 26.\n\n(1,5) life span 9: present from 20 to 28, gone on 29.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for at least 5 turns: turn 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and think ahead to turn 25 or beyond.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,4), direction R (right). So possible moves from here: since direction is R, I can go U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So from R, I can't go L. So options: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's see the grid to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells by snake and obstacles.\n\nSnake: (4,4) head, (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)\n\nObstacles: walls at borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo let's map the grid mentally.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)\n\nFood at: (3,5), (5,6), (1,5)\n\nNow, from head (4,4), possible moves:\n\n- U (up) to (4,5)\n\n- D (down) to (4,3)\n\n- R (right) to (5,4)\n\nCan't go L to (3,4) because that's the body and also opposite direction.\n\n(3,4) is occupied by the body, so moving left to (3,4) would cause collision, and it's also opposite direction, so double no.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to reach food.\n\nFirst, move U to (4,5):\n\n- (4,5) is within bounds? x=4, y=5, not border, not obstacle. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), etc., no (4,5). Obstacles: internal not at (4,5). So (4,5) is free? But there's food at (3,5), not (4,5). (4,5) is empty, I think.\n\nFood at (3,5), not (4,5). So (4,5) should be free.\n\nBut (4,5) is adjacent to food at (3,5), but not on it.\n\nAfter moving to (4,5), the snake head is at (4,5), and body follows: tail was at (4,1), but when head moves, tail moves, so the new positions would be: head at (4,5), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — (4,1) is the tail, so when head moves, the tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nRule: when you eat food, length increases, so tail doesn't move. But if not, tail moves forward.\n\nHere, moving to (4,5), no food there, so tail at (4,1) is removed, and new positions: head (4,5), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). (3,1) was there, and (4,1) removed.\n\nOriginal: positions [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] so indices: head index 0: (4,4), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,2), 4: (3,1), 5: (4,1) tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,5) without eating: head to (4,5), then segments shift: new head (4,5), segment 1: old head (4,4), segment 2: old seg1 (3,4), segment 3: old seg2 (3,3), segment 4: old seg3 (3,2), segment 5: old seg4 (3,1). Old tail (4,1) is removed. So new positions: [(4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]\n\n(3,1) is still there, and (4,1) gone.\n\nNow, (4,5) is free, so safe to move there.\n\nBut is there any risk? Let's see the board.\n\nFood at (3,5) is nearby.\n\nIf I go to (4,5), I'm adjacent to (3,5), so next turn I could go left to (3,5) to eat it.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nSecond option: move D to (4,3)\n\n(4,3): is it free? Snake has (4,4), (3,3), etc., no (4,3). Obstacles: not listed, so should be free. Walls: y=0 and y=7 borders, but y=3 is fine. So (4,3) free, move there.\n\nThen new positions: head to (4,3), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). Tail (4,1) removed.\n\n(3,1) is kept.\n\nThird option: move R to (5,4)\n\n(5,4): is it free? Snake: no. Obstacles: internal at (6,4), not (5,4). Walls: x=7 is wall, but x=5 is fine. So (5,4) should be free.\n\nMove there: head to (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). Tail (4,1) removed.\n\nNow, all three moves seem safe immediately, but I need to evaluate for future.\n\nFood: (3,5) has short life, only 3 turns left, including current turn 20. So if not eaten by turn 22, it disappears.\n\n(5,6) has life 6, so until turn 25.\n\n(1,5) has life 9, until turn 28.\n\nSince (3,5) is close and will disappear soon, I might want to eat it if possible without risk.\n\nBut there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nLet's see where the tail is.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,1). But when I move, tail changes.\n\nIn the current state, tail is at (4,1), and there's no food there, so no issue.\n\nAfter move, tail might be elsewhere.\n\nBut the danger is when eating food, if the head is adjacent to the tail and the food is on the tail cell.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo, when you eat food, you grow, so tail doesn't move, and head moves to food, so if head was adjacent to tail and tail has food, after eating, head is on the food (which was tail), and tail is still there, so they collide.\n\nIn this case, for (3,5), it's not on tail, so no issue.\n\nCurrent tail is (4,1), food is at (3,5), not on tail.\n\nSimilarly, other food not on tail.\n\nSo for now, no immediate Tail Reward Danger.\n\nBut I need to consider when I plan to eat food.\n\nNow, let's think about reaching the food.\n\nFirst, food at (3,5): it's at (3,5), current head (4,4). So adjacent vertically? (4,4) and (3,5) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing side, so up/down/left/right.\n\n(4,4) to (3,5): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. So not directly reachable in one move.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go to (4,5) or (3,4) or (5,4) or (4,3), but (3,4) is body, can't go there.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,5), which is above.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go L to (3,5) to eat the food, since (3,5) is left of (4,5).\n\n(4,5) to (3,5) is left, so move L.\n\nWould that be safe?\n\nAt turn 20, if I move U to (4,5), then at turn 21, I can move L to (3,5) to eat it.\n\nBut when I eat at (3,5), the snake grows, so length increases.\n\nBut first, from (4,5) to (3,5): is (3,5) occupied? Currently, at turn 20, snake has (3,4), which is below (3,5), but when I move to (4,5) at turn 20, the snake positions change.\n\nLet's simulate turn by turn.\n\nTurn 20: current positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)]\n\nIf I move U to (4,5):\n\nNew positions: head to (4,5), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)  // tail (4,1) removed, so segments: (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nNow, (3,1) is tail, and (3,5) is food, not occupied.\n\nAt turn 21, from head (4,5), I can move L to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is free, and has food, so I eat it.\n\nAfter eating, head moves to (3,5), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so new positions: head (3,5), then previous head (4,5) becomes body, and so on.\n\nPrevious positions: [(4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]\n\nAfter move to (3,5) and eat: new head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and tail remains (3,1) because length increases, so new segment added, but since tail doesn't move, the positions are: head (3,5), then the previous body parts: (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and the old tail (3,1) is still there, so now snake has 7 segments: (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nIs there a collision? Head at (3,5), body at (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), etc. (3,4) is at (3,4), which is below (3,5), so not same cell, so no collision.\n\nBut is (3,5) adjacent to tail? Tail is at (3,1), which is not adjacent to (3,5); they are 4 cells apart vertically. So no Tail Reward Danger issue.\n\nNow, after eating, the food is consumed, so gone.\n\nBut life span: at turn 20, (3,5) has life 3, so if I eat it at turn 21, that's fine, it's still there.\n\nTurn 20: food present, life span decreases to 2? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nAt turn 20, life span 3, so after turn 20, it decreases to 2, so present for turn 20, 21, 22? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: at the start of turn, life span is current, and after the turn, it decreases.\n\nBut when we move, we eat during the move.\n\nI think: at turn t, food has life span L, it can be eaten during turn t. After turn t, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1. When life span 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nRule: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nAssume that at turn t, if life span is L, it is present and can be eaten. After the turn, life span decreases to L-1 for next turn. When life span is 1, after the turn it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nFor (3,5) at turn 20, life span 3, so can be eaten on turn 20, 21, or 22. After turn 22, if not eaten, disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,5) at turn 20, then to (3,5) at turn 21, I eat it on turn 21.\n\nNow, after eating, the snake is longer, and positions as above.\n\nBut let's see the direction: after moving to (4,5) at turn 20, head is at (4,5), and it came from (4,4), so direction is U (up), since from (4,4) to (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5) to (3,5), that's left, so direction L.\n\nNow, from there, I need to think where to go next.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nOther options: if I don't go for (3,5) immediately, I might miss it since it disappears soon.\n\nNow, food at (5,6) is at (5,6), which is north-east of head.\n\nFood at (1,5) is west, but there are obstacles.\n\n(1,5) is at x=1,y=5, but there is obstacle at (1,2) and (2,4), which might block paths.\n\nAlso, snake body is around (3,y) and (4,1).\n\nBack to moves at turn 20.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (4,5) at turn 20.\n\nThen as above, I can go to (3,5) at turn 21 to eat.\n\nBut after that, at turn 21, after eating, head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen from (3,5), possible moves: U, D, R, but not L (left) because that would be west to (2,5), but current direction is L, so opposite would be R, so I can go U, D, or L? Direction is L, so opposite is R. So I can go U (up to (3,6)), D (down to (3,4)), or L (left to (2,5)), but not R to (4,5) because that would be reverse.\n\nNow, (3,4) is part of body, so if I go D to (3,4), it's occupied, collision.\n\n(3,4) is the second segment after eating.\n\nAt turn 21 after eating, positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nSo (3,4) is occupied, so I cannot move down to (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is occupied, but I can't move right anyway.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,6): y=6, but y=7 is wall, y=6 is fine? Walls at y=7, so y=6 is within bounds. Is (3,6) free? No snake or obstacle, so yes.\n\n- D to (3,4): but (3,4) is body, occupied, so collision, cannot.\n\n- L to (2,5): x=2,y=5. Is it free? Snake positions: all at x=3 or 4, y=1 to 5 except head. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is not listed, so should be free. Walls: x=0 wall, but x=2 fine.\n\n- R to (4,5): but (4,5) is occupied by body, and also it would be reverse direction, so cannot.\n\nSo only possible: U to (3,6) or L to (2,5).\n\nNow, if I go U to (3,6), then head to (3,6), body follows: since no food, tail moves, so new head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), etc., but tail (3,1) removed? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 21, positions with food eaten: snake has 7 segments: (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nIf I move U to (3,6) at turn 22, no food there, so head to (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,1) removed, so 6 segments again? Length was 7, but if no food eaten, length stays, but when moving without eating, tail is removed.\n\nAt turn 21, after eating, length is 7.\n\nAt turn 22, if I move to (3,6) and no food, head moves to (3,6), and tail is removed, so new positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — so tail (3,1) removed, but (3,2) is now tail, length 7 still? Positions: 7 cells: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — yes, 7 segments, tail at (3,2).\n\nIf I go L to (2,5) at turn 22, similar.\n\nBut back to the plan.\n\nIf I choose to eat (3,5) at turn 21, then at turn 22 I have to go U or L from (3,5).\n\nNow, if I go U to (3,6), then I'm at (3,6), which is near the top, y=6, close to wall y=7.\n\nThen I can go to other food.\n\nBut food at (5,6) is at (5,6), which is east.\n\n(1,5) is west.\n\nBut let's see obstacles: there is obstacle at (2,4), which is below (2,5), but (2,5) is free.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(1,2) is near (1,5)? y=2 vs y=5.\n\nNow, another move option at turn 20: instead of U, I could go R to (5,4).\n\nAt turn 20, move R to (5,4).\n\nThen new positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — tail (4,1) removed.\n\nNow, from (5,4), I can go to (5,5) or (5,3) or (6,4), but (6,4) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\nAlso, (4,4) is body, but can't go left anyway.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,4): U to (5,5), D to (5,3), or R to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, so only U or D.\n\n(5,5) is free? No snake, no obstacle.\n\n(5,3) free.\n\nNow, food at (5,6) is at (5,6), which is up from (5,4).\n\nIf I go U to (5,5) at turn 21, then from there I can go U to (5,6) to eat at turn 22, but life span: (5,6) has life 6 at turn 20, so at turn 22 it will have life 4, still there.\n\nSimilarly, I could go directly to (5,6) but from (5,4) I need to go through (5,5).\n\n(5,4) to (5,6) is not adjacent, so two moves.\n\nAt turn 20, if I go R to (5,4), then turn 21 go U to (5,5), then turn 22 go U to (5,6) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 22, (5,6) life span decreases.\n\nNow, D option: move D to (4,3) at turn 20.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can go to other places, but (3,5) is north, so I might not reach it in time if I go down.\n\n(3,5) life short, so if I don't go towards it, I might miss it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is south, and food are north or east.\n\n(1,5) is west but blocked.\n\nLet's think about the grid layout.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)\n\nFree cells: but not all are accessible easily.\n\nFor example, to reach (1,5), from (4,4), I need to go left, but there is obstacle at (2,4) and (1,2), and snake body.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so at row y=4, x=2 is blocked, so I cannot go directly west from (3,4) or something.\n\nBut head is at (4,4), so to go to (1,5), I need to go up or something.\n\nBut (1,5) has long life, so not urgent.\n\n(3,5) is urgent.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is less urgent.\n\nSo perhaps I should prioritize eating (3,5) since it will disappear soon.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks in going to (3,5).\n\nIn the path I thought: at turn 20 go U to (4,5), turn 21 go L to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 22, from (3,5), I need to move, and I can go U to (3,6) or L to (2,5).\n\nNow, if I go U to (3,6), then at (3,6), I can go U to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so cannot. Or L to (2,6), or R to (4,6), or D to (3,5) but (3,5) is body now.\n\nAfter turn 22 move to (3,6), positions: let's say from turn 21: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nTurn 22 move U to (3,6): no food, so head to (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,1) removed.\n\nNow head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: from (3,6), I can go L to (2,6), R to (4,6), or D to (3,5), but (3,5) is body, occupied, so cannot go down. U to (3,7) is wall, cannot. So only L or R.\n\n(2,6) free? No obstacle, no snake.\n\n(4,6) free.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 22 I go L to (2,5) from (3,5).\n\nAt turn 21 head at (3,5), move L to (2,5): (2,5) is free, no food, so head to (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,1) removed.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction L (since from (3,5) to (2,5)).\n\nThen possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot. L to (1,5), or R to (3,5) but (3,5) body and reverse, cannot.\n\nSo U to (2,6) or L to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) has food, so I could eat it.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to decide turn 20 move.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,5) can be eaten only if head moves onto it, and body has moved away, but currently, at turn 20, (3,5) is not under snake, it's free, so no issue.\n\nBut in general, it's fine.\n\nNow, if I don't go for (3,5), it might be wasted.\n\nBut let's see the other food.\n\nFood at (5,6): if I go R at turn 20 to (5,4), then I can go up to (5,5) and (5,6).\n\nBut (5,6) life longer, so I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life long.\n\nBut if I eat (3,5) at turn 21, I get +1 and length increases, which might help with survival or reaching other food.\n\nAlso, the snake becomes longer, which might increase risk of collision, but in this case, after eating, I have segments from y=1 to y=6, x=3 and 4, so it's a bit cramped, but I can move out.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) after eating, if I go U to (3,6), then to (4,6) or (2,6), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the obstacle at (2,4), which blocks the area.\n\nAlso, (6,4) obstacle.\n\nAnother option: at turn 20, I could go D to (4,3), but that might lead to dead end or something.\n\n(4,3) is free, then from there I can go to (4,2) or (5,3) or (3,3), but (3,3) is body.\n\nAt turn 20 move D to (4,3): new positions head (4,3), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — tail (4,1) removed.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,3), but (3,3) is body, occupied, cannot. R to (5,3), U to (4,4), but (4,4) is body, and reverse? Direction is D, so opposite is U, so I cannot go U to (4,4) because reverse and occupied. D to (4,2), or R to (5,3).\n\nU to (4,4) is reverse and occupied, cannot.\n\nD to (4,2): y=2, not wall.\n\nR to (5,3): free.\n\nSo possible D to (4,2) or R to (5,3).\n\nBut if I go down, I'm moving away from food, and (3,5) might expire, so I might miss it.\n\nSo not good for scoring.\n\nTherefore, better to go up or right.\n\nNow between U and R at turn 20.\n\nIf I go U to (4,5), I can eat (3,5) next turn.\n\nIf I go R to (5,4), I can head towards (5,6).\n\nBut (3,5) has only 3 turns life, so if I don't eat it by turn 22, it's gone.\n\nWith R move, at turn 20 to (5,4), then turn 21 to (5,5) say, then turn 22 to (5,6) to eat (5,6), but (3,5) is at (3,5), which is not reached, so I miss it.\n\nIf I go to (5,4) at turn 20, I can at turn 21 go U to (5,5), but from (5,5) I can go L to (4,5) or U to (5,6), but (4,5) is not food, and (3,5) is two steps away, but at turn 21, if I go to (5,5), then at turn 22 I can go L to (4,5), then turn 23 to (3,5), but (3,5) life span: at turn 20 life 3, turn 21 life 2, turn 22 life 1, so at turn 22 it is still there, life 1, can be eaten on turn 22.\n\nThen turn 23 it disappears.\n\nSo if I go to (5,4) at turn 20, then turn 21 go U to (5,5), then turn 22 go L to (4,5), then turn 23 go L to (3,5) to eat, but at turn 23, (3,5) life would be? Turn 20: life 3, after turn 20, life 2; turn 21, life 2, after turn 21, life 1; turn 22, life 1, after turn 22, life 0, disappears, so on turn 23 it is gone, cannot be eaten.\n\nLife span decreases after each turn.\n\nAt turn 20: food (3,5) life 3, can be eaten on turn 20.\n\nAfter turn 20, if not eaten, life becomes 2 for turn 21.\n\nAt turn 21, life 2, can be eaten.\n\nAfter turn 21, if not eaten, life becomes 1 for turn 22.\n\nAt turn 22, life 1, can be eaten.\n\nAfter turn 22, if not eaten, life 0, disappears, not available on turn 23.\n\nSo last chance to eat is turn 22.\n\nIf I go to (4,5) at turn 20, I can eat at turn 21.\n\nIf I go to (5,4) at turn 20, then to (5,5) at turn 21, then at turn 22 I can go to (4,5) or to (5,6), but to eat (3,5) on turn 22, I need to be at (4,5) or (3,4) or (3,6) or (2,5) to move to (3,5).\n\nFrom (5,5) at turn 21, I can go L to (4,5) at turn 22, but (4,5) may not be free, and from (4,5) to (3,5) is left, but at turn 22, if I move to (4,5), then to (3,5), but I need to be adjacent to move directly.\n\nAt turn 21, after moving to (5,5), positions depend.\n\nLet's simulate if I choose R at turn 20.\n\nTurn 20: move R to (5,4)\n\nPositions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)  // (4,1) removed\n\nTurn 21: from (5,4), say I move U to (5,5)  // assume no food there\n\nPositions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)  // tail (3,1) removed\n\nNow at turn 22, from (5,5), I can move L to (4,5)  // (4,5) is free? Currently no snake, so yes.\n\nMove L to (4,5): head to (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)  // tail (3,2) removed? Positions: after move, head (4,5), then previous head (5,5), then (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — and (3,2) removed, so 6 segments.\n\n(4,5) has no food, so just move.\n\nThen from (4,5) at turn 22, I can move L to (3,5) to eat, since (3,5) is there with life 1, can be eaten.\n\nMove to (3,5): eat food, head to (3,5), tail does not move, so new positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — and the old tail (3,3) is kept, but (3,3) was the last, so segments: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — length 7.\n\nNo collision.\n\nBut I ate it on turn 22, which is fine.\n\nCompared to going U directly at turn 20, I eat at turn 21, one turn earlier.\n\nBut in terms of score, same +1, but I have the food earlier, which might be better for planning, but not crucial.\n\nHowever, by going R first, I am closer to (5,6).\n\nIn the first path, if I go U at turn 20 and eat at turn 21, I am at (3,5) at turn 21, then I need to move away.\n\nIf I go R at turn 20, I am at (5,4) then (5,5), then to (4,5) and (3,5) at turn 22, but I also have the option to go to (5,6) instead.\n\nFor example, at turn 22 from (5,5), instead of going to (4,5), I could go U to (5,6) to eat (5,6) directly.\n\n(5,6) has life 6, at turn 20, turn 21, turn 22, etc., so at turn 22 I can eat it.\n\nThen I get that food.\n\nBut if I do that, I miss (3,5) because after turn 22 it disappears.\n\nSo I have a choice: either eat (3,5) on turn 22 by going left from (5,5), or eat (5,6) on turn 22 by going up.\n\nBut I can't eat both on same turn.\n\nIf I go to (5,6) at turn 22, I eat that, but (3,5) disappears unused.\n\nIf I go to (3,5), I eat that, but (5,6) is still there for later.\n\nSince (3,5) is expiring soon, it might be better to eat it rather than let it go to waste.\n\n(5,6) has longer life, I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) has very long life.\n\nSo for maximizing score, eating the expiring food first is better.\n\nIn the U move path, I eat (3,5) at turn 21, earlier, and I can then go for other food.\n\nIn R move path, I eat at turn 22, later, or miss it.\n\nBut in R move, if I eat (5,6) at turn 22, I miss (3,5).\n\nBut (5,6) is +1 same as (3,5), so same score, but (3,5) is wasted if not eaten.\n\nSo better to eat (3,5).\n\nTherefore, going U at turn 20 to (4,5) is better to secure the expiring food.\n\nThen I can think about the next moves.\n\nSimilarly, the D move is worse because I move away.\n\nSo at turn 20, I should go U to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 21, go L to (3,5) to eat.\n\nNow, after that, at turn 22, from (3,5), I need to choose between U to (3,6) or L to (2,5).\n\nNow, let's think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nAfter eating at turn 21, head at (3,5), positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nDirection L (since moved left).\n\nAt turn 22, I can:\n\nOption A: Move U to (3,6)\n\nThen positions: head to (3,6), no food, so tail (3,1) removed, new positions: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)  // tail (3,1) removed, (3,2) new tail\n\nHead at (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: L to (2,6), R to (4,6), D to (3,5) but occupied, cannot. U to (3,7) wall, cannot. So only L or R.\n\nSay I go R to (4,6) at turn 23.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,6) to eat the food there.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), from (4,6) I can go R to (5,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, I could go L to (2,6) first.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nOption B at turn 22: from (3,5) move L to (2,5)\n\nThen positions: head to (2,5), no food, so tail removed: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)  // tail (3,1) removed, (3,2) tail\n\nHead at (2,5), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, cannot. L to (1,5), or R to (3,5) but occupied and reverse, cannot.\n\nSo U to (2,6) or L to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut life span long, so I can do it later.\n\nNow, comparing U and L at turn 22.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), I am closer to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,6).\n\nIf I go L to (2,5), I am closer to (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) has longer life, and there might be obstacles.\n\nAlso, the area around (2,5) has obstacle at (2,4) below, and (1,2) southwest.\n\nBut (1,5) is at top-left.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should go for (5,6) next since it has shorter life than (1,5), but both have several turns.\n\n(5,6) life 6 at turn 20, so after turn 20, life 5; turn 21, life 4; turn 22, life 3; etc.\n\nAt turn 22, it has life 3 or 4? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 20: life 6\n\nAfter turn 20: life 5 for turn 21\n\nAfter turn 21: life 4 for turn 22\n\nAfter turn 22: life 3 for turn 23\n\n...\n\nCan be eaten until turn 25, since after turn 25 life 0.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life 9 at turn 20, after turn 20 life 8, etc., until turn 28.\n\nSo (5,6) expires sooner than (1,5), so I should prioritize (5,6) after eating (3,5).\n\nTherefore, from (3,5) at turn 22, going U to (3,6) is better to approach (5,6).\n\nThen from (3,6) at turn 22 (after moving U), I can go R to (4,6) at turn 23.\n\nThen from (4,6) at turn 23, I can go R to (5,6) to eat at turn 24? Let's see positions.\n\nAt turn 22 after moving U to (3,6): positions (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n\nHead (3,6), direction U.\n\nTurn 23: move R to (4,6)  // (4,6) should be free, no obstacle, no snake.\n\nPositions: head to (4,6), no food, so tail (3,2) removed, new positions: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)  // (3,2) removed, (3,3) tail\n\nHead at (4,6), direction R (since from (3,6) to (4,6)).\n\nTurn 24: from (4,6), I can move R to (5,6) to eat, since (5,6) has food.\n\n(5,6) is free, and food, so eat.\n\nThen head to (5,6), grow, positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)  // tail (3,3) remains, length 8.\n\nNow, after that, I need to move from (5,6).\n\nDirection R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,7) but y=7 wall, cannot. D to (5,5), L to (4,6) but occupied, cannot. R to (6,6) but x=6, and there is obstacle? (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,6) is different cell.\n\n(6,6): is it wall? x=6, but x=7 is wall, x=6 is not border, border is x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is fine. But internal obstacle at (6,4), not (6,6). So (6,6) should be free.\n\nAlso, (5,5) free.\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves: D to (5,5), or R to (6,6), since U wall, L occupied.\n\nCannot go opposite down? Direction is R, so opposite is L, which is occupied anyway.\n\nSo D or R.\n\nIf I go D to (5,5), or R to (6,6).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I have (1,5) to eat later, but I need to plan only up to 5 turns or so.\n\nNow back to turn 20.\n\nI think going U at turn 20 is good.\n\nThen turn 21 L to eat (3,5).\n\nThen turn 22 U to (3,6)\n\nThen turn 23 R to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 24 R to (5,6) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 25, from (5,6), I can go D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nBut I need to output actions for turns 20 to 24 or 25.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from t1=20, for a few turns.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the immediate turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify the sequence for a few turns, but how many? It doesn't specify, but since I think ahead 5 turns, I should provide at least 5 actions? But the state is given for turn 20, so I need actions for turn 20,21,22,23,24.\n\nAnd I can plan beyond for thinking.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have:\n\nTurn 20: U (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 21: L (to (3,5) eat)\n\nTurn 22: U (to (3,6))\n\nTurn 23: R (to (4,6))\n\nTurn 24: R (to (5,6) eat)\n\nNow at turn 24, I eat (5,6), good.\n\nThen I can go to (1,5) later.\n\nBut is there any risk in this path?\n\nAt turn 22, when I go U to (3,6), is there any issue?\n\nPositions at that time: after turn 21, snake is at (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nThen turn 22 move U to (3,6): head to (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) // tail (3,1) removed.\n\nAll good.\n\n(3,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly, turn 23 to (4,6): (4,6) free.\n\nTurn 24 to (5,6): free and food.\n\nNow, the other food (1,5) I can eat after, but since life long, and I need to think survival.\n\nBut for now, this seems a good plan.\n\nAt turn 22, I could go L to (2,5) instead, but that would lead me to (1,5) area, but (5,6) might expire sooner relatively, but I can still reach it later? For example, from (2,5) I can go to (2,6) then (3,6) etc., but it might take more turns.\n\n(5,6) life: at turn 24, if I eat it, fine, but if I go to (2,5) at turn 22, then I might not reach (5,6) in time if I delay.\n\nDistance: from (2,5) to (5,6) is 3 steps min, e.g., (2,5) to (3,5) but occupied, to (2,6) to (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,6), 4 steps.\n\nAt turn 22, (5,6) has life 4? After turn 22, life 3 for turn 23, so can be eaten turn 23,24,25.\n\nSo I have time, but going directly from (3,5) to (3,6) is more efficient for (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, for long-term, the snake is in the top row, which might be riskier near walls, but y=6, not wall yet.\n\nI think the plan is fine.\n\nNow, about the Tail Reward Danger: in this case, no food on tail, so no issue.\n\nAlso, food spawning under body: but not here.\n\nSo I think the sequence is good.\n\nTherefore, for turn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: L\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: R\n\nTurn 24: R\n\nBut at turn 24, I move R to (5,6) and eat.\n\nNow, I need to output for 5 turns, so up to turn 24.\n\nTurn 20,21,22,23,24.\n\nAt turn 24, action is R.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 23 is to (4,6), which is right from (3,6), so R.\n\nThen turn 24 to (5,6), R again.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if I can eat (1,5) later, but not necessary for now.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 20, if I go U, I might have other options, but I think it's best.\n\nTo avoid potential dead ends.\n\nFor example, after going to (5,6), I can go down or right to open space.\n\nBut I think it's ok.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned moves for at least 5 turns ahead (turns 20 to 24). The key considerations are:\n- **Food prioritization**: The food at (3,5) has a short life span (disappears after turn 22) and must be eaten soon. The food at (5,6) expires after turn 25, and (1,5) after turn 28, so (3,5) is the immediate priority. Eating it gains +1 score and increases snake length.\n- **Risk avoidance**: \n  - No instant reverse moves are allowed (current direction is R, so L is forbidden on turn 20).\n  - Collisions with walls, obstacles, or body segments must be avoided. Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), and borders are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Tail Reward Danger is not an issue here, as no food is on the tail.\n- **Path efficiency**: After eating (3,5), the snake should head toward (5,6) to secure it before it expires, as it has a shorter life than (1,5). The chosen path minimizes turns and avoids dead ends.\n\n### Move Sequence Explanation:\n- **Turn 20: U (up)**  \n  Move from (4,4) to (4,5). This positions the snake adjacent to (3,5) for eating on turn 21. Moving R or D would risk missing (3,5) or moving away from food.\n\n- **Turn 21: L (left)**  \n  Move from (4,5) to (3,5) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 7). The food is eaten just before it expires (life span 3, eaten on turn 21). After eating, the head is at (3,5) with direction L.\n\n- **Turn 22: U (up)**  \n  Move from (3,5) to (3,6). This avoids the body segment at (3,4) and moves toward (5,6). Moving L to (2,5) is possible but less efficient for reaching (5,6).\n\n- **Turn 23: R (right)**  \n  Move from (3,6) to (4,6). This continues the path to (5,6), avoiding the wall at y=7 and obstacles.\n\n- **Turn 24: R (right)**  \n  Move from (4,6) to (5,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases). (5,6) is eaten with life span 4 remaining on turn 24 (safe margin before expiration).\n\n### Long-Term Outlook (beyond turn 24):\n- After turn 24, the head is at (5,6) with direction R. Possible moves include D to (5,5) or R to (6,6) to avoid walls and open space for future food (e.g., (1,5) with long life span). The snake should navigate carefully around obstacles (e.g., (6,4)) and walls.\n- This plan secures two food items (+2 score) by turn 24 and sets up for further scoring opportunities while minimizing risks.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: L\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: R\nTurn 24: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 21, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid has walls and obstacles, and there's food with values and life spans.\n\n**Grid Size:** From the walls, border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\n**Snake Positions:** Head is at (4,5), and the body segments are (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is Up, which means last move was Up, so from (4,4) to (4,5). Since head direction is U, I cannot move Down immediately because of the no instant reverse rule.\n\n**Food Items:**\n\n- (3,5) with value 1 and life span 2. Since it's turn 21, and life span decreases every turn including current, so after turn 21, life span becomes 1, and it disappears after turn 22 if not eaten.\n\n- (5,6) with value 1 and life span 5, so it will last until turn 25 (21+5-1=25? Let's calculate: life span N means it disappears after N turns from now, including current turn. So at turn 21, it has life span 5, meaning it will be there for turns 21,22,23,24,25, and disappear after turn 25. Similarly for others.\n\n- (1,5) with value 1 and life span 8, so it will last until turn 28.\n\nAll food has value +1, no negative food mentioned, so all are positive.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid rows and columns: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) is bottom-left? Typically in such games, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left, but since head direction is U, which is y+1, I think y increases upwards, so (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? But walls are given as border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so boundaries.\n\nAssume (0,0) is bottom-left, y increases up, x increases right. So head at (4,5), which is middle-right area.\n\nObstacles:\n\n- (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (4,5), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So body goes down from head.\n\nHead direction U, so just moved up to (4,5) from (4,4).\n\nPossible moves: Since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D (down) because reverse is not allowed.\n\nDirections: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nFrom (4,5):\n\n- U: (4,6)\n\n- D: (4,4) but that's the neck, and moving down would reverse, so not allowed.\n\n- L: (3,5)\n\n- R: (5,5)\n\nAlso, need to check for collisions.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are walls, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, so moving to y=6 is ok, but y=7 is wall, so U to (4,6) is possible since y=6<7.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, so L to (3,5) x=3>0, R to (5,5) x=5<7, both ok.\n\nNow, obstacles: internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). None of these are at (4,6), (3,5), or (5,5), so no immediate obstacle collision.\n\nNow, body collision: snake positions: (4,5) head, (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nMoving to:\n\n- U (4,6): not occupied by body, so ok\n\n- L (3,5): is (3,5) occupied? Snake positions are (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), etc. (3,5) is not in the list, so free.\n\n- R (5,5): not in snake positions, so free.\n\nAlso, food at (3,5), which is directly left.\n\n(3,5) has food with value 1, life span 2.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), I eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n\nBut is there any danger? The rule about tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nFirst, what is the tail? Snake positions: head (4,5), then body: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), tail (3,1).\n\nTail is at (3,1).\n\nIs head adjacent to tail? Head at (4,5), tail at (3,1). Distance: |4-3| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(4,5) and (3,1) are not adjacent; they are far apart. Adjacent cells would be like (4,5) and (3,5) or (4,4) or (5,5) or (4,6).\n\nTail at (3,1), so no, not adjacent.\n\nMoreover, the food is at (3,5), which is not the tail cell. Tail is at (3,1).\n\nSo no tail reward danger here.\n\nIf I eat at (3,5), snake grows, so new head at (3,5), and tail stays, so body becomes [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]? When you eat, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added, but the tail doesn't move that turn? Standard snake mechanics.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length increases by one, so after eating, the head is on the food, and the tail does not move that turn, so snake grows.\n\nSo positions: before move, snake at S = [(4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]\n\nIf I move to (3,5) and eat, new head at (3,5), and since eating, tail doesn't move, so body: (4,5) becomes neck, then (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), and tail still (3,1), but with new segment, so positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] — (3,1) is still there, so the tail is now (3,1) but since we add a segment, it's longer.\n\nAfter eating, the snake has one more segment, so the last segment (tail) doesn't move, so the new position is [new_head] + previous body, so [ (3,5) ] + [ (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ] so 7 segments.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in this case, no immediate collision.\n\nNow, other moves: if I move U to (4,6), no food there.\n\nOr R to (5,5), no food.\n\nFood at (5,6) and (1,5), but not immediate.\n\nBut (3,5) is very close, and life span only 2, meaning it will disappear soon. Since turn 21, life span 2, so after this turn (turn 21), if not eaten, life span decreases to 1, then after turn 22, it disappears. So if I don't eat it now, it might be gone soon.\n\nI could eat it on turn 22, but let's see.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, let's consider options.\n\nFirst, possible actions this turn: L, U, R (since D not allowed)\n\nAction L: move to (3,5), eat food, grow to 7 segments.\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nAction U: move to (4,6), no food, head at (4,6), direction U.\n\nAction R: move to (5,5), no food, head at (5,5), direction R.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,5) has short life, so if I don't eat it now, I might miss it.\n\nBut eating it might lead to other issues.\n\nLet me map the grid.\n\nDraw a 8x8 grid.\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. But the walls are the boundaries, so we cannot move to those coordinates. For example, x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are invalid.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — these are cells that are blocked.\n\nSnake: positions: (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — so from (4,5) down to (3,1), with a bend at (4,4) to (3,4).\n\nFood: (3,5), (5,6), (1,5)\n\nNow, life spans: (3,5) life span 2, so after turn 21, it has 1 left, disappears after turn 22.\n\n(5,6) life span 5, so disappears after turn 25.\n\n(1,5) life span 8, disappears after turn 28.\n\nAll value +1.\n\nNow, current turn 21.\n\nI need to plan multiple moves.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving left to eat (3,5).\n\nIf I do that:\n\nTurn 21: move L to (3,5), eat food. Snake now: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). Length 7. Head direction L.\n\nNow, from (3,5), possible moves: since direction L, cannot move R (reverse). So can move U, D, L.\n\nU: (3,6)\n\nD: (3,4) — but (3,4) is a body segment. Is it occupied? Current positions: (3,5) head, (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\n(3,4) is the fourth segment, so if I move D to (3,4), head would be at (3,4), which is occupied by the current fourth segment, so collision, death.\n\nCannot move down.\n\nL: (2,5) — is that valid?\n\nx=2, y=5, not border wall. Internal obstacles? (2,4) is an obstacle, but (2,5) is not listed, so should be free. But (2,4) is obstacle, so (2,5) is ok? Obstacles are specific cells, not whole columns. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (2,5) is not an obstacle, so should be free.\n\nBut is it occupied by snake? Snake has (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), etc., no (2,5), so free.\n\nU: (3,6) — y=6, not 7, so not wall. No obstacle or snake there.\n\nSo from (3,5), after eating, moves: U to (3,6), or L to (2,5), or D but D to (3,4) is body, so impossible.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nNow, if I go U to (3,6), no food, head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can go U to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, cannot. Or L to (2,6), or R to (4,6), or D to (3,5) but reverse if direction U? Let's see.\n\nAfter moving U to (3,6), head direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5) — but (3,5) is where we came from? But in positions, after moving to (3,6), the body has moved, so (3,5) is now the neck, so moving back to (3,5) would be moving to the neck, which is a body segment, so collision.\n\nSince head direction U, moving D is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n\nL to (2,6)\n\nR to (4,6)\n\n(4,6) might be free? Let's see current state after turn 21.\n\nAfter turn 21 move L to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nNow turn 22: if move U to (3,6), new head (3,6), body: since no eat, tail moves, so positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail was (3,1), moves off, so (3,1) empty now.\n\n(3,2) is new tail.\n\nSo (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n\nNow from (3,6), move U to (3,7) invalid, D to (3,5) is neck, body, collision, and reverse not allowed. L to (2,6), R to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) should be free.\n\n(4,6) is not occupied, no obstacle.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nFood at (5,6) and (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is left, (5,6) is right and up.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nIf at (3,5) turn 21, I move L to (2,5) instead of U.\n\nTurn 21: move L to (3,5), eat, positions as above.\n\nThen turn 22: move L to (2,5)? From (3,5), move L to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is free? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is not, so yes.\n\nNo food at (2,5), so just move, no eat.\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction L.\n\nPositions after move: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,1) moved off, so (3,2) is tail? After turn 21 eat, positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] length 7.\n\nTurn 22 move L to (2,5), no eat, so head moves to (2,5), body: [ (2,5) ] + [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) ] but tail (3,1) moves off, so positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — so tail at (3,2).\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: since direction L, cannot R. So U, D, L.\n\nU: (2,6)\n\nD: (2,4) — but (2,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (2,4), so cannot move there.\n\nL: (1,5) — and there is food at (1,5)!\n\n(1,5) has food with life span 8, so still available.\n\nIf I move L to (1,5), I can eat it.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, back to turn 21 decision.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,5) now, what are other options.\n\nFor example, move U to (4,6).\n\nTurn 21: move U to (4,6), no food, so head at (4,6), direction U.\n\nPositions: since no eat, tail moves off, so snake: head (4,6), then (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,1) gone, so positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] length 6, same as before.\n\nFrom (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (4,5) — (4,5) is the neck, body segment, so collision, and reverse not allowed.\n\nL to (3,6)\n\nR to (5,6) — and there is food at (5,6)!\n\n(5,6) has food.\n\nSo possible to move R to (5,6) and eat.\n\nOr move L to (3,6).\n\nIf move R to (5,6), eat food.\n\nThen head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nPositions: since eat, grow, so head (5,6), body: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) and tail doesn't move, so positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] length 7.\n\nThen from there.\n\nIf at (4,6) I move L to (3,6) instead, no food, etc.\n\nAnother option: from start, move R to (5,5) on turn 21.\n\nTurn 21: move R to (5,5), no food, head at (5,5), direction R.\n\nPositions: head (5,5), then (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,1) gone, so length 6.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves: direction R, so cannot L. Can U, D, R.\n\nU: (5,6) — food there, so can eat.\n\nD: (5,4) — is it free? No obstacle, not snake, should be ok.\n\nR: (6,5) — x=6, not 7, so ok? Obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut (6,4) is obstacle, so (6,5) is different cell.\n\nNow, (5,6) has food, so moving U to (5,6) is attractive.\n\nBut let's think long term.\n\nNow, key point: the food at (3,5) has short life span. If I don't eat it on turn 21, and I move away, it might not be reachable or disappear.\n\nFor example, if I move U or R on turn 21, then on turn 22, (3,5) has life span 1, but to eat it, I need to move head to (3,5).\n\nBut after turn 21, if I moved U to (4,6), positions: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nThen turn 22, from (4,6), I can only move L or R, as we saw earlier, not U or D.\n\nIf I move L to (3,6), then head at (3,6), then I can move D to (3,5)? But from (3,6), moving D to (3,5), which might be possible if not body.\n\nAfter turn 21: positions (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n\nTurn 22: move L to (3,6), no eat? (3,6) no food, so head (3,6), body (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — tail (3,2) gone.\n\nThen from (3,6), can move D to (3,5)? (3,5) is not occupied now, since it was head at turn 20, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nAt turn 20, before turn 21, snake was at (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nAfter turn 21 move U to (4,6), positions (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n\nSo (3,5) is free? It was never part of snake except if we consider food under body, but in this case, food at (3,5) is separate.\n\nAt turn 21, before any move, food at (3,5) is on the grid, not under snake, since snake head at (4,5), body (4,4) at (4,4), (3,4) at (3,4), etc., (3,5) is empty cell with food.\n\nAfter moving to (4,6), (4,5) is now body, (3,5) is still free with food.\n\nThen turn 22, from (4,6) I can move to (3,6) or (5,6).\n\nIf I move to (3,6), then from (3,6) I can move to (3,5) on turn 23? But life span: at turn 21, food at (3,5) has life span 2, so on turn 21, after turn, life span decreases to 1. After turn 22, if not eaten, it disappears before turn 23.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current, so:\n\n- At turn 21: life span 2, so it exists during turn 21.\n\n- After turn 21 (i.e., before turn 22), life span decreases to 1.\n\n- It exists during turn 22 with life span 1.\n\n- After turn 22, life span decreases to 0, disappears, so not available on turn 23.\n\nTo eat (3,5), I must move head to it on turn 21 or 22.\n\nOn turn 21, I can move directly L to eat.\n\nOn turn 22, I need to be able to move to (3,5) from current position.\n\nIf on turn 21 I move U to (4,6), then on turn 22, from (4,6), I can move L to (3,6) or R to (5,6). To reach (3,5), I need to be at a cell adjacent to it, like (3,6), (4,5), (2,5), or (3,4).\n\nFrom (4,6), I can move to (3,6), then from (3,6) I can move to (3,5) on turn 23? But on turn 23, (3,5) is gone, as it disappears after turn 22.\n\nAfter turn 22, it disappears, so not available on turn 23.\n\nOn turn 22, I need to move directly to (3,5).\n\nFrom (4,6), the adjacent cells are (3,6), (5,6), (4,7) invalid, (4,5) is body.\n\n(4,5) is the neck, so I cannot move to (4,5) because it's occupied and collision.\n\nThe only moves from (4,6) are (3,6) and (5,6), neither is (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is not adjacent to (4,6); (4,6) to (3,5) is diagonal, not adjacent, so cannot move directly.\n\nTherefore, if I am at (4,6) on turn 22, I cannot reach (3,5) to eat it on turn 22.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to other places.\n\nIf on turn 21 I move R to (5,5), then on turn 22, from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6) or D to (5,4) or R to (6,5), but not to (3,5), which is far.\n\nSo only way to eat (3,5) is on turn 21 by moving left.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, it will disappear unused.\n\nSince it's positive food, +1 score, I should eat it if possible without risk.\n\nIn this case, eating it seems safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen after eating, I can plan to get other food.\n\nThe food at (1,5) is left, and (5,6) is right-up.\n\nAlso, the snake body is mostly on the left side, from x=3 to x=4.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I am at (3,5) with direction L.\n\nThen I can go towards (1,5) or other places.\n\n(1,5) has long life span, so not urgent.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) has life span 5, so I have time.\n\nBut let's think about the obstacles and walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, which is below (2,5), so if I go to (2,5), I cannot go down because (2,4) blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) obstacle.\n\nNow, let's consider the option of not eating (3,5) and going for (5,6).\n\nFor example, on turn 21, move U to (4,6).\n\nThen on turn 22, move R to (5,6) to eat it.\n\nBut when I move R to (5,6), I eat and grow.\n\nBut let's see the position.\n\nTurn 21: move U to (4,6), no eat, positions: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n\nTurn 22: move R to (5,6), eat food (5,6), so head to (5,6), grow, positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) and tail stays, so (3,2) is still there, positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n\nNow head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: direction R, so cannot L. Can U, D, R.\n\nU: (5,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD: (5,5) — is it free? Not occupied, no obstacle, so ok.\n\nR: (6,6) — should be free, no obstacle.\n\nAlso, (6,6) is not wall, x=6<7, y=6<7.\n\nNow, if I go D to (5,5), or R to (6,6).\n\nBut there is obstacle at (6,4), which might affect later.\n\nBut no immediate issue.\n\nHowever, by doing this, I missed the food at (3,5), which was +1 score.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating one is same as another, but (3,5) is closer and will disappear soon, so better to eat it.\n\nMoreover, by eating it, I grow longer, which might be useful for survival, but in snake, longer snake is harder to maneuver, but since grid has space, it might be ok.\n\nIn this case, grid 8x8 with obstacles, snake length 6 or 7.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), length 7.\n\nThen I can go for other food.\n\nPerhaps I can eat both.\n\nFor example, eat (3,5) on turn 21, then go towards (1,5) or (5,6).\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), which is left.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) on turn 22, then L to (1,5) on turn 23 to eat it.\n\nBut on turn 22, from (3,5), if I move L to (2,5), no eat, then head at (2,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 23, move L to (1,5), eat food, since (1,5) has food.\n\nThen grow to length 8.\n\nBut when moving to (1,5), need to check if safe.\n\n(1,5) is not wall, not obstacle.\n\nAfter eating (3,5) on turn 21, positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nTurn 22: move L to (2,5), no food at (2,5), so head (2,5), body: since no eat, tail moves, so positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,1) gone, so (3,2) tail.\n\nNow (2,5) is head.\n\nFrom (2,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: cannot R (reverse). So U, D, L.\n\nU: (2,6)\n\nD: (2,4) — but (2,4) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\nL: (1,5) — food there.\n\nSo must move U or L.\n\nIf move L to (1,5), eat food, grow.\n\nThen head at (1,5), direction L.\n\nPositions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — and tail doesn't move, so (3,2) stays.\n\nLength 8.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves: direction L, cannot R. So U, D, L.\n\nU: (1,6)\n\nD: (1,4) — is it free? Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,4) not listed, so should be free. But y=4, not wall.\n\nL: (0,5) but x=0 is wall, cannot.\n\nSo can move U or D.\n\nIf move U to (1,6), or D to (1,4).\n\nThen I need to find way out.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (1,2) below, so moving down might be tricky later.\n\nBut for now, I have eaten two foods.\n\nI could go for (5,6) after eating (3,5).\n\nBut (5,6) is on the other side.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I move U to (3,6) on turn 22.\n\nAfter turn 21 eat at (3,5), positions (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nTurn 22: move U to (3,6), no eat, positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,1) gone.\n\nFrom (3,6), can move L to (2,6), R to (4,6), or D but D to (3,5) is neck, collision.\n\n(4,6) might have no food, but I can move R to (4,6), then from there to (5,6).\n\nTurn 23: from (3,6) move R to (4,6), head at (4,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — tail (3,2) gone? After turn 22: positions (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) no, after turn 22 move U to (3,6), positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — and (3,2) is tail? List:\n\nAfter turn 21: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]\n\nTurn 22 move U to (3,6), no eat, so head (3,6), body: [ (3,6) ] + [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) ] but tail (3,1) moves off, so positions: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — still 7 segments? Head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). Yes, tail (3,2).\n\nNow turn 23: move R to (4,6), head to (4,6), direction R.\n\n(4,6) no food, so no eat, positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — tail (3,2) gone.\n\nNow from (4,6), can move to (5,6) to eat food.\n\nMove R to (5,6), eat, grow.\n\nHead at (5,6), direction R.\n\nPositions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) and tail stays, so (3,3) still there, positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)] length 8.\n\nThen I have eaten two foods.\n\nBut it took more turns: turn 21 eat (3,5), turn 23 eat (5,6), so by turn 23 I have two more foods.\n\nIf I go directly to (5,6) without eating (3,5), I eat (5,6) on turn 22, but miss (3,5), so only one food.\n\nBy eating (3,5) first, I can get both.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is still available.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger, but in this case, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (3,5), if I go to (2,5), I can eat (1,5) quickly.\n\nBut let's see the grid space.\n\nThe grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, bottom left: (1,2) obstacle, (2,4) obstacle, so around (1,1) to (1,4) might be constrained.\n\nBut (1,5) is at y=5, so moving down might be limited.\n\nBut since (1,5) has long life, I can leave it for later.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) has life span 5, so I have until turn 25 to eat it.\n\nNow, back to turn 21 decision.\n\nI think the best is to eat (3,5) now, since it's low risk and will disappear soon.\n\nThen, after that, I can decide next moves.\n\nBut the answer should include multiple turns? The instruction says to output actions for several turns, at least 5+ turns ahead in thinking, but the answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1.\n\n\"Answer Format: boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\"\n\nAnd \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", meaning I need to plan for at least 5 future turns.\n\nSo I need to output a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nHow many turns? It doesn't specify, but probably until a reasonable point or a few moves.\n\nSince food life spans are long, I can plan a path.\n\nFirst, on turn 21, move L to eat (3,5).\n\nThen, from there, I need to go towards other food or safe areas.\n\nFood at (1,5) and (5,6).\n\n(1,5) is closer in x direction, but with obstacles.\n\nFrom (3,5), after eating, on turn 22, I can move L to (2,5) or U to (3,6).\n\nIf I move L to (2,5), then on turn 23, I can eat (1,5) by moving L, if possible.\n\nBut on turn 22, at (2,5), I can only move U or L, since D is blocked by obstacle.\n\nMove L to (1,5) on turn 22? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 21: head at (3,5), positions (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nTurn 22: move L to (2,5), no food at (2,5), so positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,1) gone.\n\nNow at (2,5), I can move L to (1,5) on turn 22? Turn 22 action is from current position.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: U, D, L but D to (2,4) obstacle, so only U or L.\n\nMove L to (1,5), eat food, grow.\n\nThen positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail stays, so (3,2) there.\n\nNow head at (1,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 23: from (1,5), can move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4), since L to (0,5) wall, R not allowed (reverse).\n\n(1,4) is free, as no obstacle.\n\nThen I can move D to (1,4), or U to (1,6).\n\nBut there is obstacle at (1,2), so if I go down, to (1,4), then I can go to (1,3), but (1,3) is free, then to (1,2) obstacle, cannot, so I need to go left or right, but x=0 wall, so only up or right, but right to (2,3) or something.\n\nFrom (1,4), I can move to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, or to (1,3), then to (1,2) obstacle, dead end.\n\n(1,4) to (1,3) to (1,2) blocked, or to (2,4) blocked, so from (1,4), only up to (1,5) or to (0,4) wall, so only up.\n\nBut (1,5) is body, so moving to (1,5) would be collision if I try to go back.\n\nSo from (1,5), moving D to (1,4) might lead to dead end.\n\nBetter to move U to (1,6).\n\nThen from (1,6), I can go to (1,7) but y=7 wall, or to (2,6), etc.\n\nBut the snake is long, so I need to be careful.\n\nIf on turn 22, after (3,5), I move U to (3,6) instead of L.\n\nThen from (3,6), I can go to (4,6) or (2,6), then to (5,6) to eat.\n\nAs I thought earlier.\n\nAnd (5,6) is easier to access.\n\nAlso, the bottom area has obstacles, so going to (1,5) might be risky with a long snake.\n\nWhereas (5,6) is more open.\n\nMoreover, (5,6) has shorter life span, only 5, so I should eat it sooner.\n\n(1,5) has life span 8, so I can eat it later.\n\nSo after eating (3,5) on turn 21, on turn 22 move U to (3,6).\n\nThen on turn 23, move R to (4,6).\n\nThen on turn 24, move R to (5,6) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 24, when I move to (5,6), it should be available.\n\nLife span of (5,6): at turn 21, life span 5, so exists turns 21,22,23,24,25, disappears after turn 25.\n\nSo on turn 24, I can eat it.\n\nTurn 24 action.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 21: move L to (3,5), eat.\n\nThen turn 22: move U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 23: from (3,6), move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 24: from (4,6), move R to (5,6), eat.\n\nNow, after turn 24, head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nThen I can plan further.\n\nBut I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nAlso, after that, I can go for (1,5), but it might be far.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, from turn 21 to 25 or so.\n\nCurrent turn 21.\n\nActions: turn 21,22,23,24,25,...\n\nBut on turn 25, I might not do specific.\n\nPerhaps I can include up to eating (5,6).\n\nBut let's confirm the moves are valid.\n\nFirst, turn 21: move L to (3,5) - valid, eat food.\n\nSnake: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 22: move U to (3,6) - valid, no food, so positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) - tail (3,1) gone, so (3,2) tail.\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 23: move R to (4,6) - from (3,6) to (4,6), moving right, direction R.\n\n(4,6) no food, so positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) - tail (3,2) gone.\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 24: move R to (5,6) - eat food at (5,6), so head (5,6), grow, positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) and tail stays, so (3,3) there.\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 25, from (5,6), direction R, possible moves: U invalid (wall), D to (5,5), R to (6,6).\n\nCannot L (reverse).\n\nSo move to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is free, (6,6) free.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (6,4), which might not affect immediately.\n\nI could go down towards the bottom, but obstacles.\n\nSince (1,5) is still available, I can head left.\n\nBut from (5,6), to go to (1,5), it's far, and snake is long.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), move D to (5,5) on turn 25.\n\nThen from (5,5), can move L to (4,5) or D to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) might be body? After turn 24 positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nSo (4,5) is a body segment.\n\nIf move D to (5,5), head at (5,5), direction? After moving to (5,6) with direction R, then moving D to (5,5), direction changes to D.\n\nThen positions: turn 25 move D to (5,5), no food, so head (5,5), body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) - tail (3,3) gone.\n\nFrom (5,5), direction D, can move L to (4,5), but (4,5) is body? Positions: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) -- (4,5) is the sixth segment, so if I move L to (4,5), it is occupied, collision.\n\nCannot move left.\n\nD to (5,4)\n\nR to (6,5)\n\nU to (5,6) but reverse not allowed.\n\nSo move D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\n(5,4) should be free, no obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) free.\n\nBut obstacle at (6,4), so moving down might be ok.\n\nTo go left, I need to go around.\n\nFor example, move D to (5,4), then L to (4,4), but (4,4) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) -- (4,4) is body.\n\nThen if move L to (4,4), collision.\n\nSo better to move R to (6,5) or something.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nSince I need to output actions, perhaps for turns 21 to 24 or 25.\n\nAnother option: after eating (5,6), I can stay in the area or go up.\n\nBut y=6 is high, and walls.\n\nPerhaps after turn 24, I can move to (6,6) on turn 25.\n\nTurn 25: from (5,6), move R to (6,6), head to (6,6), no food? (6,6) no food, so positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) - tail (3,3) gone.\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (6,6), can move D to (6,5) or U invalid, L to (5,6) reverse not allowed, R to (7,6) x=7 wall invalid.\n\nSo only D to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) should be free.\n\nThen and so on.\n\nBut I think for the sequence, I can output up to turn 24.\n\nSince the food at (1,5) is still there, I can plan to eat it later, but for now, the sequence to eat both (3,5) and (5,6) is good.\n\nNow, what about the initial other option: if on turn 21 I move R to (5,5), then on turn 22 move U to (5,6) to eat.\n\nBut I miss (3,5), so worse.\n\nSimilarly, moving U first to (4,6), then R to (5,6) on turn 22, but again miss (3,5).\n\nSo eating (3,5) first is better.\n\nTherefore, I think turn 21: L\n\nThen to reach (5,6), turn 22: U, turn 23: R, turn 24: R\n\nBut after turn 22 U to (3,6), turn 23 R to (4,6), turn 24 R to (5,6) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for turn 25, I can add, but not necessary, or I can stop at turn 24.\n\nSince think 5 turns ahead, from turn 21 to 25 is 5 turns.\n\nTurn 21,22,23,24,25: that's 5 actions.\n\nOn turn 25, from (5,6), after eating on turn 24, positions as above, I need to move, say to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps move to (5,5) or something.\n\nSince (1,5) is available, I can start heading left.\n\nFrom (5,6), move D to (5,5) on turn 25.\n\nBut as before, from (5,6) direction R, move D to (5,5), then direction D.\n\nThen positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) -- and tail (3,4) or something.\n\nAfter turn 24: positions (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nTurn 25 move D to (5,5), no food, so head (5,5), body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) -- tail (3,3) gone.\n\nNow at (5,5), direction D.\n\nThen can move L, R, D.\n\nL to (4,5) but (4,5) is body segment, occupied, collision if I move there.\n\nCannot.\n\nR to (6,5)\n\nD to (5,4)\n\nU to (5,6) reverse not allowed.\n\nSo move R to (6,5) or D to (5,4).\n\nSay move R to (6,5).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can output turns 21 to 25.\n\nBut turn 25 action can be arbitrary, or I can specify.\n\nSince no immediate food, I can choose a safe move.\n\nPerhaps after turn 24, I can move to (6,6) instead.\n\nTurn 25: from (5,6) move R to (6,6), as I thought earlier.\n\nThen from there move D to (6,5).\n\nBut similar.\n\nTo head towards (1,5), from (5,6) I need to go left, but the body is on the left, so I might need to go down first to clear space.\n\nFor example, from (5,6) move D to (5,5), but then I cannot move left immediately because (4,5) is body.\n\nSo better to move to the right first to make space.\n\nMove to (6,6) then (6,5), then (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\n(6,4) obstacle, so (6,5) can move to (6,4)? No, obstacle.\n\nFrom (6,5), can move to (5,5) or (7,5) invalid, or (6,4) obstacle, or (6,6) but reverse.\n\nSo only to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) might be free later.\n\nI think it's manageable.\n\nFor the sequence, I'll go with:\n\nTurn 21: L (to eat (3,5))\n\nTurn 22: U (to (3,6))\n\nTurn 23: R (to (4,6))\n\nTurn 24: R (to (5,6) eat)\n\nThen for turn 25, say move D to (5,5) or something, but to be consistent.\n\nSince (1,5) is at (1,5), I can start moving left after turn 24.\n\nBut on turn 24 head at (5,6), after move R.\n\nThen turn 25: move D to (5,5) — but direction R, move D is allowed, to (5,5).\n\nThen as before.\n\nAfter that, turn 26: from (5,5) direction D, move L not possible, so move D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nSay move D to (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,4), can move L to (4,4) or D to (5,3), etc.\n\n(4,4) might be body, but later it moves.\n\nI think for the answer, outputting up to turn 24 is fine, as I have eaten the critical food.\n\nTo think 5 turns, include turn 25.\n\nSet turn 25: D (down to (5,5))\n\nBut no food, just moving.\n\nSimilarly, I can add.\n\nBut let's see the grid: at (5,5), no issue.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 21: L\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: R\n\nTurn 24: R\n\nTurn 25: D\n\nBut turn 25 D to (5,5), which is safe.\n\nIf I want to go towards (1,5), after turn 24, instead of D, I could move L, but from (5,6) direction R, cannot move L reverse.\n\nSo must move U, D, or R, U invalid, so D or R.\n\nR to (6,6) then D to (6,5), but (6,4) obstacle, so might not be better.\n\nSo D to (5,5) is fine.\n\nThen from there, I can later move left when possible.\n\nSo I think this is a plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves that secures the high-value food at (3,5) immediately due to its short life span (it disappears after turn 22) and then navigates toward the food at (5,6) to eat it by turn 24. The food at (1,5) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 28), so it can be targeted later after this sequence. The plan avoids collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body, and adheres to the no-instant-reverse rule.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Turn 21: Food at (3,5) must be eaten now or lost.** It has a life span of 2 at turn 21, meaning it disappears after turn 22. Moving left (L) to (3,5) eats it safely, as the head is not adjacent to the tail (at (3,1)), eliminating tail reward danger.\n- **Path to (5,6):** After eating (3,5), moving up (U) to (3,6) on turn 22 avoids the obstacle at (2,4) and positions the snake to reach (5,6) efficiently. The food at (5,6) has a life span of 5 (disappears after turn 25), so eating it by turn 24 is safe.\n- **Obstacle and Collision Avoidance:** The sequence avoids internal obstacles (e.g., (2,4) and (6,4)) and walls. Moves are chosen to prevent body collisions (e.g., no down move from (3,5) due to body at (3,4)).\n- **Long-Term Survival:** After eating (5,6), the snake grows and has room to maneuver. On turn 25, moving down (D) to (5,5) keeps options open for future moves toward (1,5) or other areas, avoiding dead ends.\n- **5+ Turn Planning:** The sequence covers turns 21–25, ensuring critical foods are eaten while maintaining flexibility. Beyond turn 25, the snake can target (1,5) or other food, but this sequence establishes a strong position.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 21:** Move L (left) to (3,5) – Eats positive food at (3,5), increasing length to 7. Head direction becomes L.  \n- **Turn 22:** Move U (up) to (3,6) – Avoids obstacle at (2,4) and positions for eastward movement. No food eaten. Head direction becomes U.  \n- **Turn 23:** Move R (right) to (4,6) – Continues path toward (5,6). No food eaten. Head direction becomes R.  \n- **Turn 24:** Move R (right) to (5,6) – Eats positive food at (5,6), increasing length to 8. Head direction becomes R.  \n- **Turn 25:** Move D (down) to (5,5) – Safe move to avoid walls and create space for future maneuvers. No food eaten, but positions snake to access lower areas later. Head direction becomes D.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Turn 21 (L to (3,5)):** Valid move (no reverse from U, no collision, eats food).  \n- **Turn 22 (U to (3,6)):** Valid move (no reverse from L, no collision).  \n- **Turn 23 (R to (4,6)):** Valid move (no reverse from U, no collision).  \n- **Turn 24 (R to (5,6)):** Valid move (no reverse from R? After turn 23 move R to (4,6), direction is R; moving R again is not reverse, so allowed. Eats food).  \n- **Turn 25 (D to (5,5)):** Valid move (no reverse from R, as direction changed; no collision; (5,5) is free).\n\nThis plan scores +2 (from two foods) by turn 24 and sets up for further scoring opportunities. After turn 25, the snake can consider moves like left to (4,5) (once cleared) or down to (5,4) to approach (1,5), but this is beyond the 5-turn sequence.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 21: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 22: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 23: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 24: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 25: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 22, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, and I must think at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid with walls on the edges. Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,5), then body segments at (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (3,5) from (4,5).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,6) with value 1, life span 4 (so it disappears after 4 turns, including this one)\n\n- (1,5) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (6,2) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so they're all positive. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to plan my moves for the next few turns, starting from turn 22. The answer should be in the format with actions for turn 22, 23, 24, etc., but I need to think ahead at least 5 turns.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So the tail is at (3,1).\n\nFood: (5,6), (1,5), (6,2)\n\nCurrent head direction: Left. Since head is at (3,5) and previous was (4,5), it moved left, so direction is L.\n\nI can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since I'm moving left, I cannot move right immediately on the next turn. So possible moves from (3,5) are: Up, Down, Left (but left might be blocked or something?).\n\nFrom (3,5), adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (3,6)\n\n- Down: (3,4)\n\n- Left: (2,5)\n\n- Right: (4,5)\n\nBut right is not possible because of no instant reverse. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R (opposite) on this turn. So possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, check if these cells are free.\n\nFirst, (3,6): is it occupied? Snake body: positions are (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). (3,6) is not in this list, so not body. Walls: y=7 is wall, but (3,6) is y=6, which is not border? y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=6 is fine. x=3, not border. Internal obstacles: none at (3,6). So (3,6) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4): that's a body segment. Snake has (3,4) as the fourth segment. But according to movement rules, I can move into the tail cell only if the tail moves away. Tail is at (3,1), but (3,4) is not tail; it's a body segment.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But (3,4) is not the tail; tail is (3,1). So moving to (3,4) would cause collision with body, since it's not the tail.\n\nGeneral rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because when head moves to tail, tail moves, so it's safe only if moving to the current tail position.\n\nBut here, (3,4) is not the tail; it's a middle segment. So moving down to (3,4) would mean head collides with body at (3,4), which is deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (2,5): check if free.\n\n(2,5): not in snake positions? Snake: (3,5), (4,5), etc. (2,5) not listed. Walls: x=0 is wall, x=2 is not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, (2,4) is obstacle. (2,5) is not listed as obstacle. So (2,5) should be free.\n\nNow, moving down to (3,4): (3,4) is occupied by snake body, and it's not the tail, so collision.\n\nMoving up to (3,6): as above, seems free.\n\nMoving left to (2,5): seems free.\n\nBut I cannot move right because of no instant reverse.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4) but that's deadly, so not possible, or L to (2,5).\n\nD to (3,4) is invalid because collision.\n\nSo only U and L are possible immediate moves? But let's confirm.\n\nPerhaps I can move to (3,4) if it's the tail, but it's not; tail is (3,1).\n\nSo yes, only U and L are safe from current position.\n\nBut (3,6) and (2,5).\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term survival.\n\nFood locations: (5,6), (1,5), (6,2)\n\nLife spans: (5,6) has life 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including this one. So on turn 22, life span 4, so after turn 22, it will have 3 turns left? Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for (5,6), life_span=4 on turn 22. After turn 22, it will have 3 left? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn 22, it is present, and after turn 22, countdown to 3, then 2, then 1, then on turn 26 it disappears? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life_span=N on turn t, it means it will disappear after N turns, so it is present for N more turns, including turn t.\n\nSo on turn t, life_span=N, it decreases to N-1 on turn t+1, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n\nFor (5,6): life_span=4 on turn 22, so:\n\n- Turn 22: present, life_span=4\n\n- Turn 23: present, life_span=3\n\n- Turn 24: present, life_span=2\n\n- Turn 25: present, life_span=1\n\n- Turn 26: disappears\n\nSimilarly, (1,5): life_span=7, so disappears after turn 28 (22+6=28? Turn 22 to 28 is 7 turns? Let's count.\n\nTurn 22: life=7\n\nTurn 23: life=6\n\n...\n\nTurn 28: life=1, still present\n\nTurn 29: disappears? Life_span decreases to 0 on turn when it disappears.\n\nBetter to think: it disappears when life_span reaches 0 after decreasing.\n\nOn turn t, with life_span L, it will be present for L more turns, including t. So last present on turn t + L - 1.\n\nFor (5,6): L=4, turn 22, so present from turn 22 to 25, disappears on turn 26.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5): L=7, present turn 22 to 28, disappears turn 29.\n\n(6,2): L=10, present turn 22 to 31, disappears turn 32.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,5), food at (5,6), (1,5), (6,2).\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6, which is up and right from head (3,5). (1,5) is left, at x=1,y=5. (6,2) is right and down.\n\nAlso, tail is at (3,1), which might be important for Tail Reward Danger.\n\nBut no food on tail currently.\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,5): U to (3,6) or L to (2,5).\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then I'm at (3,6), and direction is U.\n\nIf I go L to (2,5), at (2,5), direction L.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid state.\n\nI should make a small grid.\n\nRows y=7 to y=0, columns x=0 to x=7.\n\ny=7 and y=0 are walls, x=0 and x=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — so head at (3,5), tail at (3,1)\n\nFood: (5,6), (1,5), (6,2)\n\nNow, from (3,5), safe moves: U to (3,6) or L to (2,5)\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), what next?\n\nAt (3,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves from (3,6): U, D, L, R but no instant reverse, so cannot D (down), since current dir U.\n\nSo can go U to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so (3,7) is wall, cannot go there.\n\nL to (2,6)\n\nR to (4,6)\n\nD to (3,5) but cannot because reverse and also (3,5) is now body? After moving to (3,6), the snake body will be: head at (3,6), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, so positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] and tail at (3,2) since we move, tail moves to (3,2)? When snake moves, head goes to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so tail is removed or stays depending on food.\n\nSince no food eaten, when we move, the tail moves, so snake shortens? No: when no food eaten, snake moves, head to new position, each body segment to previous position, tail is removed.\n\nStandard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nIn this case, from current positions: head to (3,6), so new head (3,6), then body: (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — and (3,1) is left, so tail was (3,1), now it's gone, so snake is at [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] with tail at (3,2).\n\nLength remains 7 since no food eaten.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (2,5), new positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] tail at (3,2).\n\nNow back to (3,6): at (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7) — wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5) — but (3,5) is now body, and not tail, so collision. Also, no instant reverse, so cannot D.\n\nL to (2,6)\n\nR to (4,6)\n\nBoth (2,6) and (4,6) need to be free.\n\n(2,6): not wall, not obstacle? Walls: x=0 wall, x=2 not; y=6 not border. Internal obstacles: none at (2,6). Snake: after move to (3,6), positions include (3,5), (4,5), etc., not (2,6), so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so free.\n\nSo from (3,6), can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,5) first.\n\nBut I need to consider food.\n\nFood at (5,6) is close to (3,6). (5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go to (4,6), then to (5,6) to eat it.\n\nBut life span is short, only 4 turns, so I need to eat it soon if possible.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is at x=1,y=5, which is left, and I can go directly to (2,5) now from (3,5), then to (1,5) if possible.\n\n(1,5) to (2,5) is adjacent, but from (2,5) to (1,5), but (1,5) might have obstacles or walls.\n\nFirst, let's list all blocked cells.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo (1,2) is blocked, but (1,5) is not listed, so should be free, but need to check if I can reach it.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go L to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can go to (1,5) since adjacent, and (1,5) is not wall, not obstacle, not snake at that time.\n\nAfter moving to (2,5), snake positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) tail (3,2).\n\n(1,5) is free, so from (2,5), I can go L to (1,5) to eat the food there.\n\n(1,5) has life span 7, so I have time, but it's close.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is at (5,6), from (3,5) if I go U to (3,6), then to (4,6), then to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) life span 4, so if I don't eat it soon, it might disappear.\n\nTurn 22 to 25 present, so I can eat on turn 23 or 24, etc.\n\n(6,2) is farther, life span 10, plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to think about the path and risks.\n\nAlso, Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But currently, tail at (3,1), no food on it, and not adjacent to head. Head at (3,5), tail at (3,1), not adjacent.\n\nNow, possible actions for turn 22: U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then I can head towards (5,6).\n\nIf I go L to (2,5), towards (1,5).\n\nNow, let's consider going for (5,6) first since it has shorter life.\n\nPath to (5,6): from (3,5) U to (3,6) on turn 22.\n\nThen from (3,6), I need to go to (4,6) or (5,6) directly? (5,6) is at (5,6), from (3,6) I can go R to (4,6) on turn 23, then from (4,6) R to (5,6) on turn 24.\n\nOn turn 24, eat (5,6).\n\n(5,6) life span: on turn 22, life=4, turn 23 life=3, turn 24 life=2, so on turn 24 it is present, I can eat it.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so length becomes 8.\n\nNow, after eating at (5,6), head at (5,6), direction R or whatever.\n\nBut need to see what happens after.\n\nFirst, let's simulate the move to (5,6).\n\nTurn 22: move U to (3,6) — direction U.\n\nSnake now: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] tail (3,2)\n\nTurn 23: from (3,6), move R to (4,6) — direction R.\n\nNew head (4,6), body: (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) tail (3,3)? Positions: head (4,6), then previous head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — and tail was (3,2) but not in body now, so snake is [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)] tail (3,3)\n\nLength 7.\n\nTurn 24: from (4,6), move R to (5,6) — direction R.\n\nNow, (5,6) has food, so I eat it. Snake grows, so new head at (5,6), and tail stays, so positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — and since ate food, add a new segment at tail, so tail was (3,3), now new tail is where? After moving, the tail doesn't move when eating, so snake becomes longer.\n\nWhen head moves to food cell, it eats, and the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, the new segment is the old tail, and tail stays there? Standard: when eat, head moves to food, body segments follow, but tail doesn't move, so length increases by one, with the new tail being the old tail position.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, positions P0, P1, ..., Pk (head to tail).\n\nAfter move without eating: new head at new position, P0 moves to new, P1 to P0, ..., Pk to P_{k-1}, Pk vacated.\n\nAfter move with eating: new head at food, P0 to new, P1 to P0, ..., Pk to P_{k-1}, and Pk is now part of body, new tail is Pk, but since no move, it stays, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added there? No.\n\nWhen eating, the tail does not move, so the new position list has the new head, then all previous positions including the tail, so length increases by one.\n\nFor example, before move: positions [A, B, C, D] with A head, D tail.\n\nMove to new cell E with food: new positions [E, A, B, C, D] with E head, D tail. So D is still tail, but now it's part of the body? Tail segment is still there.\n\nIn terms of collision, the tail cell is occupied until it moves.\n\nBut in this case, when I move to (5,6) and eat, new snake: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — so positions include (3,3) which was tail, now it's body, and tail is still (3,3)? No, tail is the last segment, which is (3,3).\n\nAfter eating, positions: [ (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) ] so head (5,6), tail (3,3), length 8.\n\nNow, from (5,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R but no instant reverse, so cannot L (left).\n\n(5,6) y=6, so U to (5,7) — y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (5,5)\n\nL to (4,6) — but (4,6) is body now, and not tail, so collision. Also, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nR to (6,6)\n\nSo can go D to (5,5) or R to (6,6)\n\n(6,6): x=6, y=6, not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, (6,1), but (6,6) not listed, so should be free.\n\n(5,5): not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake has (4,6), (3,6), etc., not (5,5), so free.\n\nNow, if I go to (5,5), or (6,6).\n\nBut I need to think about the other food and survival.\n\n(1,5) is still there, life span 7, so I have until turn 28 to eat it.\n\n(6,2) at (6,2), which is below.\n\nAlso, after being at (5,6), I can go to (6,6) or (5,5).\n\nIf I go to (6,6), then from there, possible moves.\n\nBut let's see the obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, so I need to avoid that.\n\n(5,5) might be better to go down.\n\nBut I also have the food at (1,5) to consider.\n\nIf I go left first to (2,5) on turn 22.\n\nTurn 22: move L to (2,5) — direction L.\n\nSnake: head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) tail (3,2)\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go L to (1,5) to eat the food, since (1,5) is adjacent.\n\nTurn 23: move L to (1,5) — eat food, so grow.\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,2), length 8.\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, from (1,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R but no instant reverse, cannot R (right).\n\nU to (1,6)\n\nD to (1,4)\n\nL to (0,5) — x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,5) — but (2,5) is body, not tail, collision, and instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4)\n\n(1,6): not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,6) not listed, so free.\n\n(1,4): similarly, not obstacle, not snake, free.\n\nBut (1,4) might be near obstacle or something.\n\n(2,4) is an internal obstacle, so (1,4) is free but adjacent to (2,4) obstacle.\n\nNow, I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,6) has short life, if I go left, I might not reach it in time.\n\nFrom (1,5) to (5,6) is far, and (5,6) disappears on turn 26, so if I eat on turn 24 or earlier.\n\nBut if I go left on turn 22 and eat (1,5) on turn 23, then on turn 24 I'm at (1,5) or moving, to go to (5,6) I need to go right and up.\n\nFrom (1,5), I can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nIf U to (1,6), then I can go to (2,6), etc., but to reach (5,6) by turn 25 at latest.\n\nTurn 24: from (1,5) after eating, I move, say to (1,6) on turn 24.\n\nThen positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) tail (3,3)? After eating on turn 23, positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) tail (3,2)\n\nTurn 24: move U to (1,6) — no food, so move, new head (1,6), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) tail (3,3)\n\nNow at (1,6), direction U.\n\nCan go U to (1,7) — y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (1,5) — body, collision, reverse.\n\nL to (0,6) wall.\n\nR to (2,6)\n\nSo only R to (2,6)\n\nTurn 25: move R to (2,6)\n\nThen from (2,6), can go to (3,6), etc., but (5,6) is at (5,6), and on turn 25, life span: turn 22 life=4, turn 23=3, turn 24=2, turn 25=1, present, turn 26 disappear.\n\nSo on turn 25, (5,6) still there.\n\nFrom (2,6) on turn 25, I can go to (3,6), then to (4,6), but (5,6) is at (5,6), from (4,6) I can go to (5,6) on turn 26? Turn 26 it disappears, so I need to be on (5,6) on or before turn 25.\n\nOn turn 25, I am at (2,6) after moving.\n\nFrom (2,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R. Direction from moving R to (2,6), so direction R.\n\nNo instant reverse, cannot L.\n\nU to (2,7) wall.\n\nD to (2,5)\n\nR to (3,6)\n\n(2,5) is occupied? Snake has (1,5), (2,5) is body segment, not tail, so cannot go to (2,5).\n\n(3,6) is free? Not snake, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nSo go R to (3,6) on turn 25.\n\nBut (5,6) is at (5,6), from (3,6) on turn 25, I can go to (4,6) on turn 26, but (5,6) disappears on turn 26, so on turn 26, (5,6) is gone, I cannot eat it.\n\nLife span: on turn 25, life=1, present, after turn 25, life=0, disappears, so on turn 26 it is not there.\n\nSo to eat (5,6), I must be on it on turn 25 at latest.\n\nOn turn 25, I am at (2,6), and I move to (3,6), not to (5,6).\n\nFrom (2,6) on turn 25, I cannot reach (5,6) in one move; it's two moves away: to (3,6) or (2,5) or (3,6) only, then to (4,6), then to (5,6) on turn 27, too late.\n\nSo if I go for (1,5) first, I miss (5,6).\n\nTherefore, to eat both, I should go for (5,6) first since it expires sooner.\n\nThen after that, I can go for (1,5) or (6,2).\n\n(1,5) life span 7, so until turn 28, I have time.\n\nNow, back to the first option: go U to (3,6) on turn 22, then R to (4,6) on 23, R to (5,6) on 24 to eat.\n\nThen at (5,6) on turn 24, direction R.\n\nNow, from (5,6), can go D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nI need to think about where to go next.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,2), but it has long life.\n\nAnd (1,5) at left.\n\nNow, the snake body might block paths.\n\nAfter eating at (5,6), positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) tail (3,3)\n\nNow, from (5,6), if I go R to (6,6), turn 24 action? Turn 24 I moved to (5,6) and ate.\n\nTurn 24: moved to (5,6), ate.\n\nNow for turn 25, I need to move from (5,6).\n\nGo R to (6,6) or D to (5,5).\n\nIf go R to (6,6), direction R.\n\nThen at (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7) wall, D to (6,5), L to (5,6) body and reverse, invalid, R to (7,6) x=7 wall.\n\nSo only D to (6,5)\n\nTurn 25: move D to (6,5)\n\nThen at (6,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,6) body and reverse, invalid, D to (6,4), but (6,4) is internal obstacle! (6,4) is listed as obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), so (6,4) blocked.\n\nL to (5,5)\n\nR to (7,5) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,5)\n\nTurn 26: move L to (5,5)\n\nAt (5,5), direction L? From (6,5) to (5,5), moving left, so direction L.\n\nThen from (5,5), can go U, D, L, R but no instant reverse, cannot R (right).\n\nU to (5,6) — but (5,6) is body? After moves, let's track positions.\n\nAfter turn 24: snake at [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 25: move R to (6,6) — new head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\nTurn 26: move D to (6,5) — new head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) tail (4,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 27: move L to (5,5) — new head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5) tail (4,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow at (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6) — (5,6) is body, not tail, collision.\n\nD to (5,4)\n\nL to (4,5)\n\nR to (6,5) — body and reverse, invalid.\n\n(4,5): is it free? Not snake, not wall, not obstacle? (4,5) is in body? Positions have (4,5) as tail? Tail is (4,5), but (4,5) is the last segment.\n\nTail is at (4,5), so I can move to (4,5) because it's the tail, and it will move.\n\nRule: I can move to the tail cell because the tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) or (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is adjacent, and it's tail.\n\n(5,4) is below.\n\nIf I go to (4,5), since it's tail, safe.\n\nOr to (5,4).\n\nBut (4,5) is directly left.\n\nNow, from (5,5), go L to (4,5) on turn 27.\n\nSince (4,5) is tail, and I move to it, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nAfter moving, new head (4,5), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) tail (3,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this path seems messy, and I have food at (1,5) to eat.\n\nPerhaps from (5,6), instead of going right, I should go down to (5,5) directly on turn 25.\n\nTurn 24: at (5,6) after eating.\n\nTurn 25: move D to (5,5)\n\nThen at (5,5), direction D.\n\nThen I can go to (5,4) or (4,5) or (6,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt that time, positions: after turn 24, snake at (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\n(4,5) is a body segment, not tail.\n\nTail is (3,3).\n\nSo from (5,5), if I go L to (4,5), (4,5) is body, not tail, so collision.\n\nGo D to (5,4)\n\nOr R to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nBack to turn 22 decision.\n\nIf I go U first, I can eat (5,6) on turn 24.\n\nThen I need to go towards (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is at left, so I need to head left.\n\nFrom (5,6), going to (5,5) or (6,6) might not be efficient.\n\nIf on turn 22 I go L to (2,5), I eat (1,5) on turn 23, but miss (5,6).\n\nSince (5,6) is +1 and short life, it's better to eat it if possible.\n\n(6,2) has long life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body is coiled, and I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, in the current position, if I go U to (3,6), then to (4,6), then to (5,6), I'm on the top row.\n\nThen I need to go down.\n\nBut the body is below.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left, I go to (2,5), then to (1,5), then I'm on left edge.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be tight.\n\nLet's consider the grid with obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, which is near (3,4) snake body.\n\nAlso, (1,2) obstacle.\n\nIf I go to (1,5), then I can go down to (1,4), but (1,4) is free, then to (1,3), but (1,2) is obstacle, so I can go to (1,3), then I cannot go down to (1,2), so I have to go right to (2,3) or something.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, for turn 22, I should choose a move that allows me to access food and avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, Tail Reward Danger: but currently no issue.\n\nAnother food at (6,2), but it's near obstacles (6,1) and (6,4).\n\n(6,2) is at y=2, x=6.\n\n(6,1) is obstacle below, (6,4) above.\n\nI can reach it later.\n\nFor now, I think going for (5,6) first is better because of short life.\n\nThen after eating it, I can head towards (1,5).\n\nBut from (5,6), to go to (1,5), I need to go left and down.\n\nFor example, from (5,6) go down to (5,5), then to (5,4), etc., but I have body at (4,4), (3,4), etc.\n\nLet's list the free cells.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate both paths.\n\nFirst option: turn 22 U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 23 R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 24 R to (5,6) eat food\n\nNow turn 25, from (5,6), I can go D to (5,5) or R to (6,6)\n\nIf I go D to (5,5), direction D.\n\nThen at (5,5), can go D to (5,4), L to (4,5), or R to (6,5), but no U because reverse.\n\n(4,5): is it free? After turn 24, positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\n(4,5) is body, not tail, so moving to (4,5) causes collision.\n\n(6,5) is free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake.\n\n(5,4) free.\n\nSo from (5,5), can go D to (5,4) or R to (6,5)\n\nSay go D to (5,4) on turn 25.\n\nThen at (5,4), direction D.\n\nCan go D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, so not.\n\n(4,4) is body? Positions: after turn 25 move to (5,5), new head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\n(4,4) is body, not tail.\n\n(5,3) free.\n\nSo go D to (5,3) or L to (4,4) invalid, so D to (5,3)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I need to go left for (1,5).\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go left to (4,3), etc., but it might take time.\n\nFrom (5,6) on turn 25, if I go R to (6,6), then as before, to (6,5) on turn 26, then to (5,5) on turn 27, etc., still not left.\n\nTo reach (1,5) quickly, from current position, going left directly might be faster.\n\nBut if I go left, I miss (5,6).\n\nSince (5,6) is only +1 and short life, but if I can't eat it without risk, I might skip it.\n\nBut in this case, I can eat it safely by going U then R R.\n\nThen after that, I can go for (1,5), which has longer life.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) can be eaten later.\n\nBut let's check the distance to (1,5).\n\nFrom head (3,5) to (1,5) is 2 steps left: to (2,5) then (1,5).\n\nFrom (5,6) to (1,5) is |5-1|=4 in x, |6-5|=1 in y, so at least 5 steps, but with body, it might be more.\n\nFor example, from (5,6) to (1,5), I need to go to (4,6) but occupied, so down to (5,5), then (4,5), but (4,5) might be occupied, etc.\n\nIt will take several turns.\n\nWhereas if I go directly to (1,5) on turn 23, I eat it sooner.\n\nBut then (5,6) expires.\n\nSince both are +1, eating (1,5) sooner might not be better; I should eat the one that expires sooner to not miss it.\n\n(5,6) expires on turn 26, (1,5) on turn 29.\n\nSo (5,6) is more urgent.\n\nI can eat (5,6) on turn 24, then eat (1,5) around turn 30 or so, but it might be gone if I take too long.\n\nTurn 28 last present, so I have until turn 28 to eat (1,5).\n\nFrom turn 24 at (5,6), to (1,5), I need to move left and down.\n\nFor example, go to (5,5), then (5,4), then (4,4) but (4,4) is body, so need to go around.\n\nLet's see the area.\n\nThe snake body occupies (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) after turn 24.\n\nFree cells left: (2,5), (2,6), (1,5), (1,6), (1,4), etc., but (2,4) is obstacle.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can go to (5,5), then to (5,4), then to (5,3), then to (4,3), etc., but that is down, not left.\n\nTo go left, from (5,5) I can go to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\n(4,5) is occupied until the snake moves.\n\nAs the snake moves, the body shifts.\n\nFor example, if I go down from (5,6) to (5,5) on turn 25, then positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\n(4,5) is still body.\n\nThen from (5,5), go D to (5,4) on turn 26, head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) tail (4,4)\n\n(4,5) still body.\n\nTurn 27: from (5,4) go D to (5,3) or L to (4,4) but (4,4) is tail? Tail is (4,4), so I can move to (4,4) since it's tail.\n\nGo L to (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5) tail (4,5)\n\nNow at (4,4), which was tail, so safe.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go U to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, not tail, collision, or D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4) body.\n\n(3,4): is it free? Not snake, not wall, not obstacle? (3,4) was body, but in new positions, it's not, so free.\n\nPositions have (3,5), (4,5), not (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) free.\n\nSo from (4,4), go L to (3,4) or D to (4,3), etc.\n\nThen I can go to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle, so I have to go around.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) go to (3,5) or (2,5) if free.\n\n(3,5) might be occupied.\n\nIt's getting complicated.\n\nTo reach (1,5), from the left side is easier.\n\nBut since I ate (5,6), I have to go from the right.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (1,5) first, then later for (6,2), and skip (5,6) if it's too risky or time-consuming.\n\nBut eating (5,6) seems safe and quick.\n\nAnother idea: from current position (3,5), I go U to (3,6) on turn 22, then on turn 23, instead of going R to (4,6), I go L to (2,6) or something, but that might not help for (5,6).\n\nI need to go to (4,6) to reach (5,6).\n\nI think I should go for (5,6) and then deal with the rest.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (6,2) with long life.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, I need to have space to move.\n\nThe grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,6), if I go to (6,6), I might get stuck as before.\n\nBut from (5,6), going down to (5,5) is better.\n\nThen I can go to the bottom for (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), with obstacles at (6,1) and (6,4), so I can access it from left or right.\n\nBut let's decide for turn 22.\n\nI think I'll go U to (3,6) on turn 22 to start towards (5,6).\n\nThen the next moves can be planned.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nThe input is turn t1=22, so I need to output actions for turn 22, 23, 24, etc., for several turns.\n\nBut how many? It doesn't specify, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 turns.\n\nAlso, the actions may depend on the state, but since I'm simulating, I can plan a sequence.\n\nBut the state changes, so I need to plan based on current knowledge.\n\nI can plan a path for the next few turns.\n\nLet's plan to eat (5,6) first.\n\nTurn 22: U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 23: R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 24: R to (5,6) eat food\n\nNow turn 25, from (5,6), I need to choose a move.\n\nPossible: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6)\n\nIf I go D to (5,5), then I can avoid the right side with obstacles.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go to (5,4) or (4,5) but (4,5) may be occupied, but as we saw, it is occupied initially.\n\nAfter turn 24, positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\n(4,5) is body.\n\nOn turn 25, move D to (5,5), new head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\n(4,5) still body.\n\nFrom (5,5), can go D to (5,4) or R to (6,5) or L to (4,5) but (4,5) body, collision.\n\n(6,5) free.\n\n(5,4) free.\n\nSay go D to (5,4) on turn 25.\n\nThen head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) tail (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is tail, so I can move to it later.\n\nTurn 26: from (5,4), go D to (5,3) or L to (4,4) since (4,4) is tail, safe.\n\nGo L to (4,4) on turn 26.\n\nHead (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5) tail (4,5)\n\nNow at (4,4), which was tail, so fine.\n\nThen from (4,4), can go U to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, not tail, collision.\n\nD to (4,3)\n\nL to (3,4)\n\nR to (5,4) body.\n\n(3,4): free? Not in positions, so yes.\n\n(4,3) free.\n\nSay go L to (3,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen head (3,4), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) tail (3,5)\n\nThen from (3,4), can go to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so cannot.\n\nGo U to (3,5) but (3,5) body, collision.\n\nD to (3,3)\n\nL to (2,4) obstacle or (2,4) is obstacle, so only D to (3,3) or R to (4,4) body.\n\n(3,3) free? Not in positions, so go D to (3,3) on turn 28.\n\nBut this is taking too many turns, and I'm not closer to (1,5).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go D to (3,3) on turn 27.\n\nThen at (3,3), and so on.\n\nTo reach (1,5), I need to go to (2,5) or (1,6), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) might be free at some point.\n\nInitially, after the snake moves, cells become free.\n\nFor example, when I moved to (3,6) on turn 22, tail moved from (3,1) to (3,2), so (3,1) free, but not relevant.\n\nLater, when I move, the tail moves.\n\nFor instance, after eating (5,6), tail at (3,3), then as I move down, tail moves.\n\nOn turn 27, tail at (3,5), for example.\n\n(2,5) was occupied, but when the snake moves, it might free up.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPerhaps for turn 22, I go L to (2,5) to go directly to (1,5), eat it on turn 23, then I have (6,2) to eat later, and skip (5,6) since it's only one point and short life, but I can still try to get it if possible, but from (1,5) I can't reach it in time.\n\nSo I have to choose.\n\nSince the score is the same, and (5,6) expires soon, I should eat it.\n\nThen (1,5) I can eat later if possible.\n\nBut with the body, it might be difficult to reach (1,5) from the right.\n\nAnother thought: from current position, if I go L to (2,5) on turn 22, then on turn 23 I go to (1,5) and eat, then on turn 24 I can go U to (1,6), then R to (2,6), then R to (3,6) on turn 25, then to (4,6) on turn 26, but (5,6) is gone on turn 26, so I can't eat it.\n\nSo I miss it.\n\nWhereas if I go U first, I eat it on turn 24.\n\nThen for (1,5), I can try to go back, but it might take time.\n\nPerhaps after eating (5,6), I go down to the bottom to eat (6,2).\n\n(6,2) at (6,2), life span 10, so until turn 31.\n\nFrom (5,6), go D to (5,5), then to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), then to (6,2) or something.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (5,1), so (5,2) is free.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (6,2) adjacent.\n\nBut let's see if I can do that.\n\nTurn 24: at (5,6) after eating.\n\nTurn 25: D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 26: D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 27: D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 28: D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 29: R to (6,2) eat food.\n\nOn turn 29, (6,2) life span: turn 22 life=10, turn 29 life=10-7=3? Turn 22: life=10, turn 23:9, turn 24:8, turn 25:7, turn 26:6, turn 27:5, turn 28:4, turn 29:3, present, so yes, can eat on turn 29.\n\nThen I can eat (6,2).\n\nAs for (1,5), it disappears on turn 29 (turn 22+7-1=28? Last present on turn 28, disappears turn 29.\n\nTurn 22 life=7, turn 23:6, ..., turn 28:1, present, turn 29:0, disappeared.\n\nSo on turn 29, (1,5) is gone, so I can't eat it if I go for (6,2).\n\nIf after eating (5,6), I go left for (1,5), I might not reach it in time.\n\nFor example, from (5,6) on turn 24, to (1,5), min distance 5 steps, but with body, let's say turn 25 to (5,5), turn 26 to (5,4), turn 27 to (5,3), turn 28 to (4,3), turn 29 to (3,3), but (1,5) is far.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (1,5) is not direct.\n\nIt will take more than 5 turns, and (1,5) disappears on turn 29, so I can't eat it.\n\nTherefore, I can only eat one of (5,6) or (1,5), but not both, because of the time and positions.\n\nIf I eat (5,6) first, I miss (1,5); if I eat (1,5) first, I miss (5,6).\n\nSince both are +1, it doesn't matter which one I eat, but I should eat one.\n\n(6,2) I can eat later.\n\nAlso, there might be new food spawning, but I don't know, so based on current, I should choose one.\n\nBut in this state, there is no other food, so I should try to eat as much as possible.\n\nBut in this case, I can eat either (5,6) or (1,5), and then (6,2).\n\nSince (5,6) has shorter life, it's more urgent to eat it or it will be lost.\n\nWhereas (1,5) has longer life, so I can eat it later if I can reach it, but from the right, I may not.\n\nIf I eat (1,5) first, I can then eat (6,2), and (5,6) is lost.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (5,6) first, I can eat (6,2), and (1,5) lost.\n\nSo either way, I eat two food: one of the close ones and (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is guaranteed since long life.\n\nBut let's confirm the life.\n\n(1,5) life 7, so if I eat it on turn 23, I have it.\n\n(5,6) life 4, eat on turn 24.\n\n(6,2) life 10, eat later.\n\nSo I can eat two food.\n\nBut which one to choose for the close one.\n\nPerhaps (1,5) is closer from current position.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (1,5): 2 steps.\n\nTo (5,6): 3 steps via (3,6),(4,6).\n\nSo (1,5) is closer.\n\nAnd after eating (1,5), I can go down to (1,4), then to (1,3), but (1,2) obstacle, so to (2,3) or something, then to the bottom for (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (5,6), I go down for (6,2).\n\nBut with obstacles, eating (1,5) might be safer because the left side has more space.\n\nFor example, after eating (1,5), positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) tail (3,2)\n\nThen I can go D to (1,4) on turn 24.\n\nHead (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) tail (3,3)\n\nThen from (1,4), go D to (1,3) on turn 25, but (1,3) free, then from (1,3), cannot go D to (1,2) obstacle, so go R to (2,3) on turn 26.\n\nThen from (2,3), can go to (2,2) or (3,3) etc., down to (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, I can reach (6,2).\n\nWhereas if I eat (5,6), I can go down to (5,2) then to (6,2).\n\nSo both are possible.\n\nBut for turn 22, I think I'll go L to (2,5) to eat (1,5) first, since it's closer and I can do it in two turns, while (5,6) takes three turns.\n\nThen I have (6,2) to eat later.\n\nAlso, for long-term, the left side might have more space.\n\nWith obstacle at (2,4) and (1,2), but I can navigate.\n\nSo let's decide.\n\nTurn 22: move L to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 23: move L to (1,5) and eat food.\n\nThen for turn 24, from (1,5), move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4)\n\nSince I need to go down for (6,2), go D to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 25: from (1,4), move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 26: from (1,3), cannot D, so move R to (2,3)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide the sequence.\n\nSince the question is to think ahead and prioritize survival, going left might be better.\n\nBut let's see the head direction.\n\nCurrent head direction L, so moving L to (2,5) is fine.\n\nThen to (1,5) L again.\n\nThen from (1,5), after eating, move D to (1,4), direction D.\n\nThen to (1,3) D, then to (2,3) R, etc.\n\nBut I think for turn 22, I'll go L.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can provide up to 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's list.\n\nTurn 22: L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 23: L to (1,5) eat\n\nTurn 24: D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 25: D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 26: R to (2,3)  -- since (1,2) obstacle, cannot down.\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4) body or reverse, invalid, D to (1,2) obstacle, L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3)\n\nSo only R to (2,3)\n\nThen at (2,3), direction R.\n\nThen can go U to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, D to (2,2), R to (3,3), L to (1,3) body or reverse.\n\nSo go D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\n(2,2): is it free? Not obstacle, not wall, not snake at that time.\n\nObstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) might be snake or not.\n\nAfter turn 26, positions depend.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, for turn 22, action L.\n\nThen for the answer, I can provide turn 22 to 26 or so.\n\nBut the format is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nSo for turn 22: L\n\nTurn 23: L (to eat (1,5))\n\nTurn 24: D ( to (1,4))\n\nTurn 25: D ( to (1,3))\n\nTurn 26: R ( to (2,3))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut at turn 26, from (1,3) to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can go to (2,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut I think for the response, I can provide the first few actions.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (5,6) to not miss it.\n\nBut let's see the initial position again.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,2) might be riskier because of obstacles.\n\nFor example, near (6,1) and (6,4), but I can access it.\n\nI think either choice is fine, but since the snake is on the left, going left might be natural.\n\nI'll go with L on turn 22.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned moves at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Food Priorities**: (5,6) has a short life span (disappears after turn 25) and must be eaten soon, but it requires moving away from (1,5). (1,5) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 28) and is closer (2 steps vs. 3 steps to (5,6)). (6,2) has a long life span (disappears after turn 31) and can be targeted later.\n- **Risks**: Moving towards (1,5) avoids immediate body collisions and leverages the snake's current left direction. The left path has fewer obstacles and more space for maneuvering. Eating (5,6) first would risk missing (1,5) due to distance and body blockages.\n- **Path Feasibility**: From (3,5), moving left to (2,5) and then to (1,5) is safe and efficient. After eating (1,5), the snake can head down to avoid the obstacle at (1,2) and gradually move toward (6,2). This path ensures survival and scores +1 from (1,5) with a plan to eat (6,2) later.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: \n  - Turn 22: Move left to (2,5) to start toward (1,5).\n  - Turn 23: Move left to (1,5) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 8).\n  - Turn 24: Move down to (1,4) to avoid the obstacle at (1,2) and start descending.\n  - Turn 25: Move down to (1,3), continuing toward the bottom.\n  - Turn 26: Move right to (2,3) to navigate around obstacles and body.\n  - Beyond: Head toward (6,2) via safe cells (e.g., (2,2), (3,2), etc.), eating it by turn 29.\n\nThis sequence eats (1,5) quickly, avoids missing it due to life span, and sets up for (6,2). Missing (5,6) is acceptable as it is only +1 and would risk (1,5) for no net gain.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 22: L (left)  \nTurn 23: L (left)  \nTurn 24: D (down)  \nTurn 25: D (down)  \nTurn 26: R (right)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 23, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 because the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area should be from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: Border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. That means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall, so the snake can only be on cells where 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <= 6. Similarly, internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these are also walls.\n\nInternal obstacles are given as coordinates, so (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) are wall cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is L, which means left, so it's moving left. Last move was left, so from (3,5) to (2,5), I assume.\n\nHead direction L means it's facing left, so it just moved to (2,5) from (3,5).\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,6) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,2) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Value 1 for all, and life span decreasing each turn.\n\nLife span: for (5,6), life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including the current turn. So if not eaten by turn 25, it's gone? Let's see.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo for food at (5,6) with life span 3 on turn 23: it will be there on turn 23, 24, 25, and disappear after turn 25, so not available on turn 26.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life span 6: available from turn 23 to turn 28, gone on turn 29.\n\n(6,2) life span 9: available from turn 23 to turn 31, gone on turn 32.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,5), direction L, so it can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so it cannot move right on the next turn. So possible moves from (2,5): Up, Down, Left, but not Right because right is opposite to left.\n\nMovement constraints: no instant reverse. So from current head direction L, cannot move R on next turn.\n\nSo from (2,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up (U): (2,6)\n\n- Down (D): (2,4)\n\n- Left (L): (1,5)\n\n- Right (R): (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied by the snake body, and since it's not the tail, it would be a collision if head moves there. Also, cannot move right because it's opposite direction? No, the constraint is only about not moving opposite to current direction, not about occupancy. But occupancy might cause collision.\n\nDeadly collisions: body collision except for the tail.\n\nSnake positions: head (2,5), body segments: (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). Tail is (3,2).\n\nIf head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, it collides and dies. If it moves to the tail cell, it might be ok if the tail moves away, but only if the tail is not staying.\n\nSpecifically, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body part, it's collision unless it's the tail and the tail moves away at the same time.\n\nThe rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to the tail cell, it's safe because the tail moves forward, so the cell is vacated.\n\nBut if head moves to any other body segment, it collides.\n\nAlso, walls: cannot move to wall cells.\n\nNow, from (2,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (2,6) - y=6 is within bounds? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, since walls are at y=0 and y=7, so cells y=1 to y=6 are free, except for obstacles.\n\ny=7 is wall, so y=6 is the top row, but not wall, I think. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are ok.\n\nSimilarly x from 1 to 6.\n\n(2,6): let's check if it's wall or obstacle. Walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so (2,6) has y=6, which is not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,6) not in list, so free. But is it occupied? Snake positions: (2,5) is head, (3,5), etc., no (2,6), so free.\n\n(2,6) should be free.\n\n- D: (2,4) - y=4, x=2. Check: not border wall, internal obstacles: (2,4) is listed! Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)] so (2,4) is an obstacle, wall. So cannot move to (2,4).\n\n- L: (1,5) - x=1, y=5. Not border wall (x=1 not 0 or 7), internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,5) not listed, so free. Snake positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), etc., no (1,5), so free.\n\n- R: (3,5) - but (3,5) is the first body segment, directly behind head. So if head moves to (3,5), it would collide with body, since (3,5) is not the tail. Tail is (3,2). So moving right to (3,5) causes collision. Also, cannot move right because it's opposite to left direction? No, the movement constraint: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so moving R is opposite, so it's forbidden by the no instant reverse rule.\n\nSo, possible moves from (2,5): U, D, L.\n\nBut D to (2,4) is wall, so impossible.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\n- U: to (2,6)\n\n- L: to (1,5)\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's see the food positions.\n\nFood at (5,6), (1,5), (6,2).\n\n(1,5) is directly to the left, at (1,5). If I move L to (1,5), I can eat it this turn, turn 23.\n\nBut I need to consider the risks.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,2). Head at (2,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,5) and (3,2) are not adjacent; (2,5) to (3,2) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right.\n\nSo (2,5) adjacent cells: (2,6) U, (2,4) D (but wall), (1,5) L, (3,5) R (but body, forbidden).\n\nTail is at (3,2), which is down-right from head, not adjacent. So no issue for now.\n\nIf I move to (1,5), I eat the food there.\n\nFood at (1,5) has value 1, life span 6, so it will be there for a while, but if I eat it now, I get the point and snake grows.\n\nWhen I eat food, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, the tail doesn't move for that turn, so the new segment is added at head position.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so tail stays, head moves to food, new head position, and body follows.\n\nIn terms of positions: when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, so the snake grows: the head is now at food position, and a new segment is added where the head was, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nBut in this case, since we're moving, the body moves only if no food eaten.\n\nGenerally: if no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail moves forward (so tail cell vacated).\n\nIf food eaten, head moves to food position, tail does not move, so snake length increases by one.\n\nIn this game, from the rules: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nAnd for movement, when head moves to food, it eats, grows.\n\nNow, for (1,5): if I move left to (1,5), I eat the food.\n\nThen, new head position (1,5), and since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so the snake becomes: head (1,5), then previous head (2,5) becomes new body segment, then (3,5), (4,5), etc., down to tail (3,2).\n\nCurrent snake: positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n\nIf I move left to (1,5) and eat food, new positions: head (1,5), then (2,5) (which was head, now body), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail stays, so now 8 segments.\n\nLength was 7, after eating +1, so 8.\n\nTail is still (3,2).\n\nNow, head direction: I moved left, so new direction is L.\n\nBut after eating, the head is at (1,5), direction L.\n\nNow, possible next moves from there.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (2,6), no food there, so head moves to (2,6), tail moves to (3,3)? Let's see.\n\nIf no eat, head moves to new position, tail moves forward.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,5), body segments: index 1: (3,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (4,4), 4: (3,4), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,2) tail.\n\nIf move U to (2,6), no food, so new head (2,6), then body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — and tail (3,2) moves off, so new tail is (3,3), but (3,3) is now the last segment.\n\nPositions: head to (2,6), then previous head (2,5) becomes first body, then (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — tail is (3,3)? No: the segments after head are the existing body segments shifted.\n\nAfter move: head at (2,6), then the body segments are: the previous positions except the tail is removed? No.\n\nStandard: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed.\n\nSo positions: new head (2,6), then body: segment 1: old head position (2,5), segment 2: old segment 1 (3,5), segment 3: old segment 2 (4,5), segment 4: old segment 3 (4,4), segment 5: old segment 4 (3,4), segment 6: old segment 5 (3,3) — and old tail (3,2) is vacated.\n\nSo new snake: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)] with tail (3,3).\n\nLength 7, no change.\n\nHead direction now U.\n\nNow, back to choice: at turn 23, from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6) or L to (1,5).\n\nIf I go L to (1,5), I eat the food immediately, grow to length 8.\n\nBut I need to see if it's safe and what happens next.\n\nAlso, (1,5) has life span 6, so it will be there for several turns, but if I eat it now, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nBut I should plan multiple moves.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid: 8x8, but walls at borders and obstacles.\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: border x=0,7 and y=0,7 are all walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo wall cells: all (x,0) for x, (x,7) for x, (0,y) for y, (7,y) for y, plus (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1) and (6,1) are both walls, (1,2) wall, (2,4) wall, (6,4) wall.\n\nNow, snake positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n\nTail at (3,2).\n\nFood: (5,6), (1,5), (6,2)\n\n(1,5) is at left, (5,6) top-right, (6,2) bottom-right.\n\nLife span: (5,6) life 3, so if not eaten by turn 25, gone.\n\n(1,5) life 6, gone after turn 28.\n\n(6,2) life 9, gone after turn 31.\n\nNow, current turn 23.\n\nIf I move left to (1,5), eat food, grow.\n\nThen head at (1,5), direction L.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction L, so cannot move R (right) next turn.\n\nAlso, (1,5) is at left edge, x=1.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (1,6)\n\n- D: (1,4)\n\n- L: (0,5) but x=0 is wall, cannot move there.\n\n- R: (2,5) but (2,5) is now the first body segment after eating, so if I move right to (2,5), it would collide with body, and also R is opposite to current direction L, so cannot move R anyway.\n\nSo from (1,5), after moving L there, head direction L, cannot move R.\n\nCan move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\n(1,6): y=6, not wall, no obstacle, and not occupied? After eating, positions: head (1,5), body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,2)\n\n(1,6) is free.\n\n(1,4): y=4, x=1, not border wall, internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,4) not listed, so free. Not occupied.\n\nSo from (1,5), can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nBut if I go U or D, no food, so snake moves, tail moves.\n\nIf I go to (1,6), for example.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nPerhaps moving to (1,5) might be risky because I'm at the edge.\n\nAnother option: move up to (2,6) from current position.\n\nAt turn 23, move U to (2,6), no food there, so snake moves to [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)] tail at (3,3)\n\nHead direction U.\n\nFrom (2,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction U, so cannot move D (down) next turn.\n\nAlso, (2,6) is at top, y=6.\n\nU to (2,7): but y=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nD to (2,5): but (2,5) is now the first body segment, so moving down to (2,5) would collide, and D is opposite to U, so cannot.\n\nL to (1,6): possible, (1,6) free? Walls: x=1,y=6 not wall, obstacles not there, snake not there, so free.\n\nR to (3,6): (3,6) free? x=3,y=6, not border, not obstacle, snake positions: after move, head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), etc., no (3,6), so free.\n\nBut cannot move D or U? U is wall, D is body and opposite, so only L or R.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nPossible moves: L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\n(1,6) or (3,6).\n\nIf I go to (1,6), then I can access the food at (1,5) later, but it's below.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), which is down from (1,6).\n\nBut let's think about the food at (5,6) which has short life span.\n\n(5,6) life span 3, turn 23,24,25, gone after 25.\n\nSo if I want to eat it, I need to reach it by turn 25.\n\nFrom current position (2,5), to (5,6) is not close; (2,5) to (5,6) is delta x=3, delta y=1, so at least 4 moves away if direct, but with obstacles and body, it might be longer.\n\nPath: from (2,5) to (5,6): one way could be right to (3,5), but (3,5) is body, cannot. Or up to (2,6), then right to (3,6), (4,6), (5,6).\n\n(4,6) and (5,6) should be free.\n\n(4,6): not wall, not obstacle, not occupied? Current snake has (4,5), but after moving, it might be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is food.\n\nBut from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6), then from there, to (3,6) or (1,6), then to (3,6) if possible, then to (4,6), then to (5,6).\n\nFrom (2,6) to (3,6) is R, which is possible since direction was U, moving right is not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen from (3,6) to (4,6) R again, then to (5,6) R, eat.\n\nBut timing: turn 23: move U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 24: from (2,6) move R to (3,6)\n\nTurn 25: from (3,6) move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 26: from (4,6) move R to (5,6) but on turn 25, (5,6) is still there? Life span: on turn 23, (5,6) life 3, so on turn 23,24,25, gone after 25, so on turn 25 it is there, but to eat on turn 25, I need to move to it on turn 25.\n\nIf I move to (5,6) on turn 25, I eat it.\n\nBut in the path above, on turn 25 I am at (4,6), and I move to (5,6) on turn 26? No.\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nTurn 23: from (2,5) move U to (2,6) — turn 23\n\nAfter move, positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) tail\n\nTurn 24: from (2,6), move R to (3,6) — head to (3,6), no food, so body moves: head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) — tail (3,3) moves off, new tail (3,4)? Positions: head (3,6), then previous head (2,6), then old body 1 (2,5), old body 2 (3,5), old body 3 (4,5), old body 4 (4,4), old body 5 (3,4) — so tail is (3,4)\n\nLength 7.\n\nTurn 25: from (3,6), move R to (4,6) — (4,6) free, no food, so head to (4,6), body: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) — tail (3,4) moves off, new tail (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is body, but it moves.\n\nTurn 26: from (4,6), move R to (5,6) — but (5,6) is food, so eat it on turn 26? But on turn 26, (5,6) life span: turn 23 life 3, so on turn 24 life 2, turn 25 life 1, turn 26? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn t, life span N, it has N turns left including turn t.\n\nSo for (5,6) on turn 23, life span 3: present on turn 23,24,25. After turn 25, it disappears, so not on turn 26.\n\nTherefore, on turn 26, (5,6) is gone, so I cannot eat it on turn 26.\n\nTo eat (5,6), I must be on (5,6) on turn 23, 24, or 25.\n\nBut on turn 23, I am at (2,5), not at (5,6).\n\nIf I move directly, min moves: from (2,5) to (5,6) is 3 steps right and 1 up, but with obstacles, I need to go around.\n\nBut with no instant reverse, it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), I can only go U or L this turn, not R.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), then as above, on turn 24 I can go to (3,6), turn 25 to (4,6), but (4,6) to (5,6) is one step, but on turn 25 I am at (4,6), and I can move to (5,6) on turn 25 if I move R, but turn 25 is when I arrive at (4,6), and move to (5,6).\n\nOn turn 25, from (4,6) move to (5,6), which is food, so eat it on turn 25.\n\n(5,6) is available on turn 25, life span decreases to 1 on turn 25, so if I move to it on turn 25, I can eat it.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 23: move U to (2,6) — not at (5,6)\n\nTurn 24: move R to (3,6) — not at (5,6)\n\nTurn 25: move R to (4,6)? From (3,6) to (4,6) is turn 24 move? Let's clarify turns.\n\nOn turn t, I choose action, move, and after move, the state updates.\n\nAt start of turn 23, head at (2,5), I choose to move U to (2,6), so after turn 23, head at (2,6).\n\nThen turn 24, from (2,6), I choose to move R to (3,6), after move, head at (3,6).\n\nTurn 25, from (3,6), I choose to move R to (4,6), after move, head at (4,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is at (5,6), I need to be at (5,6) to eat it.\n\nOn turn 25, after moving to (4,6), I am not at (5,6), and (5,6) is still there since turn 25 is its last turn.\n\nThen on turn 26, I could move from (4,6) to (5,6), but on turn 26, (5,6) is gone, so no food, just move.\n\nBut to eat, I need to be on it when it exists.\n\nFrom (4,6) on turn 25, I can move to (5,6) on turn 25? On turn 25, I start from (3,6) or (4,6)?\n\nAt the beginning of turn 25, head is at (3,6) (after turn 24 move).\n\nI choose to move to (4,6), so after move, on turn 25, I am at (4,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is adjacent, I could have moved directly to (5,6) from (3,6) on turn 25, but from (3,6) to (5,6) is not adjacent; (3,6) to (5,6) is two steps away, not direct.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can only move to adjacent cells: (3,7) U, but y=7 wall; (3,5) D, (2,6) L, (4,6) R.\n\n(3,5) is occupied by body, as per positions after turn 24.\n\nAfter turn 24: head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail\n\nSo (3,5) is body, so moving D to (3,5) would collide.\n\nL to (2,6) is body, collide.\n\nU wall.\n\nSo only R to (4,6).\n\nSo on turn 25, I move to (4,6), and (5,6) is still there, but I am not on it.\n\nThen on turn 26, I move to (5,6), but it's gone.\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,6) by turn 25 with this path.\n\nIs there a way to reach (5,6) sooner?\n\nFrom current position (2,5), I could go left to (1,5) on turn 23, eat that food, then from there, try to go to (5,6), but (1,5) to (5,6) is even farther.\n\nOr, from (2,5), go up to (2,6), then on turn 24, instead of right, I could go down or something, but from (2,6), only left or right possible, as U and D not possible.\n\n(2,6) to (1,6) or (3,6).\n\nIf I go to (1,6) on turn 24, then from (1,6), I can go down to (1,5), but (1,5) might have food, but if I ate it on turn 23, it's gone, or not.\n\nIf I didn't eat on turn 23, then on turn 24 I can go to (1,5) from (1,6).\n\nBut let's not digress; for (5,6), it seems impossible to reach by turn 25 from current position, because I need at least 3 moves to cover the distance, but with the constraints, on turn 23 I can only go U or L, not towards right.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (5,6): min Manhattan distance |5-2| + |6-5| = 3+1=4, so 4 moves, but on turn 23 I am at (2,5), after move turn 23, I am at new position, say (2,6) or (1,5), then turn 24, etc.\n\nEarliest I can be at (5,6) is turn 26 if I go directly, but with obstacles, it might not be direct.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) U to (2,6) turn 23\n\nThen turn 24 R to (3,6)\n\nTurn 25 R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 26 R to (5,6) but (5,6) gone.\n\nIf I could go faster, but I can't.\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 23, if I could go right, but I can't because body and opposite direction.\n\nSo it's impossible to reach (5,6) by turn 25, so I should forget about that food; it will disappear before I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) has longer life, and (6,2) even longer.\n\nSo perhaps focus on (1,5) and (6,2).\n\nNow, at turn 23, if I move L to (1,5), I eat it immediately, grow to 8 segments.\n\nThen head at (1,5), direction L.\n\nFrom there, I can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4) on turn 24.\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), no food, so move to (1,6), body follows, tail moves, so tail (3,2) moves off, new tail (3,3)? After eating on turn 23, positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,2)\n\nIf move U to (1,6) on turn 24, no food, so head to (1,6), body: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — tail (3,2) moves off, new tail (3,3)\n\nLength 8.\n\nThen from (1,6), direction U, can move L or R (since U, cannot D).\n\nL to (0,6) wall, cannot.\n\nR to (2,6), which is free? (2,6) not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n\n Etc.\n\nIf on turn 24 from (1,5) I go D to (1,4), similar.\n\nBut let's consider the other food (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at bottom-right, life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nAlso, there is a risk of getting trapped or something.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body is coiled, with segments at (3,3), (3,2), etc., so the area around (3,3) might be tight.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells to see free space.\n\nGrid cells: x 1-6, y 1-6.\n\nWalls: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4) — and borders, but borders are walls, not cells.\n\nCells: free except walls and snake.\n\nSnake: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n\nWalls: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nFood: (1,5), (5,6), (6,2)\n\n(5,6) will disappear soon, so ignore.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1) but (1,1) not wall? Walls: internal (1,2) is wall, but (1,1) is border? x=1,y=1, border walls are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (1,1) is not border wall, and not internal obstacle, so free, but snake not there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,6), (3,1), (3,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,6), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) food, (6,2) food, (6,3), (6,5), (6,6) etc.\n\n(6,2) is food, not wall.\n\nBut (5,1) wall, (6,1) wall, (6,4) wall, so (6,2) and (6,3) are free.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nAt turn 23, if I move L to (1,5), I eat the food, grow, but I am at (1,5), which is left edge, and the body is to the right, so I might be safer in the center.\n\nIf I move U to (2,6), I don't eat, but I am at (2,6), and I can then go right towards the center or to (6,2) later.\n\nBut (1,5) has life span 6, so I can eat it later.\n\nFor example, on turn 23, move U to (2,6), no eat.\n\nThen turn 24, from (2,6), I can move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf I move L to (1,6), then from (1,6), I can move D to (1,5) on turn 25, and eat it if it's still there.\n\n(1,5) life span 6, turn 23 to 28, so on turn 25 it is there.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 23: move U to (2,6) — positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) tail\n\nTurn 24: move L to (1,6) — head to (1,6), no food, so body: head (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) — tail (3,3) moves off, new tail (3,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 25: from (1,6), move D to (1,5) — (1,5) is food, so eat it, grow. Head to (1,5), tail does not move, so new positions: head (1,5), body: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) — and previous tail (3,4) stays, but since ate, tail doesn't move, so snake is head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) — length 8, tail at (3,4)\n\nPrevious positions before turn 25 move: head at (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail\n\nAfter moving down to (1,5) and eating, new head (1,5), and new segment added at previous head position? When head moves to food, it occupies the food cell, and the snake grows, so the body is the previous head position and all previous body positions.\n\nSo after move: head at (1,5), then the previous positions are: previous head (1,6) becomes first body, then previous body segments: (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) — so tail is still (3,4), but now it's part of body, and length increased.\n\nPositions: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4)] with tail at (3,4)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, head at (1,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction D, so cannot move U (up) next turn.\n\nAlso, (1,5) is at left.\n\nU to (1,6): but (1,6) is now the first body segment, so moving up would collide, and U is opposite to D, so cannot.\n\nD to (1,4): (1,4) free? Not wall, not occupied, so possible.\n\nL to (0,5) wall, cannot.\n\nR to (2,5): (2,5) is body, fourth segment, so collide, and R is not opposite? Current direction D, moving right is not opposite, but it's occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo only possible move D to (1,4).\n\nThen from (1,4), I can go down or left or right, but left wall, etc.\n\nBut I am moving down the left edge.\n\nNow, the food at (6,2) is still there.\n\nBut I am at (1,4), far from (6,2).\n\nIf on turn 24 from (2,6) I had moved R to (3,6), then I am closer to the right side.\n\nBut I missed (1,5) for now.\n\nSince (1,5) has life span 6, I can eat it later, as above.\n\nBut in the above, I ate it on turn 25.\n\nSimilarly, I could eat it on turn 23 directly.\n\nNow, let's consider the Tail Reward Danger for the future.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,2), and it might move.\n\nAnother food at (6,2), which is near the tail area.\n\n(6,2) is food, and tail is at (3,2), same y=2.\n\nIf I go to (6,2), I can eat it.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, I need to decide the move for turn 23.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid the left edge to have more mobility.\n\nSo maybe on turn 23, move U to (2,6) instead of L to (1,5).\n\nThen from (2,6), on turn 24, I can move to (3,6) to go right.\n\nThen from (3,6), I can go down to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, or to (3,7) wall, or to (2,6) body, or to (4,6).\n\nSo to (4,6), then to (4,5) or (4,7) wall, etc.\n\nTo reach (6,2), I need to go down.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (6,4), (6,1), etc.\n\nFrom (4,6), I can go to (5,6) but (5,6) will be gone soon, or to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 23: action\n\nTurn 24: action\n\nTurn 25: action\n\nTurn 26: action\n\nTurn 27: action\n\n Etc.\n\nCurrent turn 23.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (1,5), eat food, grow. Then head at (1,5), direction L.\n\nThen on turn 24, only can move U or D, say move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nSuppose move U to (1,6), no eat, positions head (1,6), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) tail (3,3) after move.\n\nThen on turn 25, from (1,6), direction U, can move L or R (cannot D).\n\nL wall, so R to (2,6), but (2,6) is body? Positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — (2,6) not occupied, so can move R to (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) is free, so move to (2,6), no food, so head to (2,6), body: (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) — tail (3,3) moves off, new tail (3,4)\n\nThen from (2,6), direction R (since moved right), can move U, D, L, R, but current R, cannot L next turn.\n\nU wall, D to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, collide, cannot.\n\nL to (1,6) body, collide.\n\nR to (3,6), free, so must move R to (3,6) on turn 26.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI am stuck moving right along the top.\n\nNot good for long-term.\n\nIf from (1,5) on turn 24 I move D to (1,4), then down the left.\n\nBut left bottom has wall at (1,2), so I might get trapped.\n\nFor example, from (1,5) move D to (1,4) turn 24, eat or not? (1,4) no food, so move to (1,4), body follows, tail moves.\n\nPositions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) tail (3,3) after move? After move from (1,5) to (1,4) no eat, head (1,4), body: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) — tail (3,2) moved off, new tail (3,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen on turn 25, from (1,4), current direction D, can move U, D, L, R, but cannot U (opposite).\n\nD to (1,3): free? (1,3) not wall, not occupied, so possible.\n\nL wall, cannot.\n\nR to (2,4): but (2,4) is wall, obstacle, cannot.\n\nU cannot.\n\nSo only D to (1,3).\n\nMove to (1,3), no food, head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) — tail (3,3) moves off, new tail (3,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 26: from (1,3), direction D, cannot U.\n\nD to (1,2): but (1,2) is wall, obstacle, cannot.\n\nL wall.\n\nR to (2,3): (2,3) free? Not wall, not occupied, so possible.\n\nU cannot.\n\nSo move R to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to other places.\n\nBut I am at (2,3), with body around.\n\nSo moving to (1,5) early might lead to edge and reduce mobility.\n\nOption 2: on turn 23, move U to (2,6), no eat.\n\nThen on turn 24, from (2,6), move R to (3,6) to go towards center.\n\nAfter turn 23 move U: positions head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) tail\n\nTurn 24 move R to (3,6): head to (3,6), no food, body: (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) — tail (3,3) moves off, new tail (3,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow head at (3,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but current R, cannot L next turn.\n\nU to (3,7) wall, cannot.\n\nD to (3,5): (3,5) is body, as per positions, (3,5) is third body segment, so collide, cannot.\n\nL to (2,6) body, collide, cannot.\n\nR to (4,6), free, so move R to (4,6) on turn 25.\n\nTurn 25: move R to (4,6), no food, head (4,6), body: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) — tail (3,4) moves off, new tail (4,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 26: from (4,6), direction R, cannot L.\n\nU to (4,7) wall.\n\nD to (4,5): (4,5) is body, fifth segment, so collide, cannot.\n\nL cannot.\n\nR to (5,6): but (5,6) is gone, so move to (5,6), no food, head (5,6), body: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) — tail (4,4) moves off, new tail (4,5)\n\nThen from (5,6), I can go down to (5,5) or left, etc.\n\nBut I missed the food at (1,5), which is still there, but far.\n\n(1,5) life to turn 28, so I can go left later.\n\nBut let's see the food at (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at bottom.\n\nFrom current position after turn 26, head at (5,6), I can go down to (5,5), then to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut there is wall at (6,4), (6,1), etc.\n\nTo reach (6,2), from (5,6) to (6,2) is not direct.\n\n(5,6) to (6,2): delta x=1, delta y=4, so at least 5 moves.\n\nBut with body and obstacles.\n\nFor example, on turn 27, from (5,6) move D to (5,5), if free.\n\n(5,5) not wall, not occupied? After turn 26, positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail\n\n(5,5) free, so move D to (5,5), no food, etc.\n\nThen down to (5,4), (5,3), etc., but (5,1) is wall, so I can go to (5,2), then to (6,2) if possible.\n\n(6,2) is food, and (6,3) is free, (6,5) free but (6,4) wall, so from (5,2) to (6,2) is possible if free.\n\nBut it might take many turns.\n\nPerhaps on turn 23, I should not move up, but left to eat the food and then maneuv r.\n\nBut earlier I saw that moving left might reduce mobility.\n\nAnother idea: the snake body is at (3,3), (3,2), and tail at (3,2), and food at (6,2), so if I can move the tail away, then eat the food at (6,2) when head is near.\n\nBut let's think about the Tail Reward Danger for (6,2).\n\nThe rule: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nCurrently, tail at (3,2), not adjacent to head.\n\nBut if I move and the tail moves, it might be.\n\nFor example, if tail is at a cell with food, and head is adjacent, and I eat it, then head moves to tail cell, but since I eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the previous position, but the head is now where the tail was, and the new tail is added, but since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so the cell where tail was is now head, and the body is longer, so the new tail is the last body segment, which is not the same cell, so no immediate collision.\n\nThe rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nLet's parse.\n\nSuppose tail is at position T with food.\n\nHead is at H, adjacent to T.\n\nIf I move head to T to eat the food.\n\nAfter eating, head is now at T, and since I ate, the tail does not move, so the snake grows: the new head is at T, and a new body segment is added at the previous head position, so the tail remains where it was, but now it's not tail, it's the second last segment, and the actual tail is the previous tail position, but since tail didn't move, the position T is now head, and the body includes the previous tail position as a body segment, and the tail is still there, so when head moves to T, it is now at the same position as the body segment that was tail, but since the tail didn't move, it is still there, so head and body collide.\n\nPositions: before move, head at H, tail at T, with food at T.\n\nHead adjacent to T, so H is next to T.\n\nI move head to T.\n\nSince T has food, I eat it, so head moves to T, and the snake grows: the previous head position H becomes a new body segment, so the new positions are: head at T, then new body at H, then the existing body segments, and the tail remains at T? No.\n\nThe tail position: since I ate, the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains in place as part of the body.\n\nSo before move: positions: ..., body_k, tail T\n\nAfter moving to T and eating: head at T, then new body segment at previous head H, then the existing body segments including the one that was at T, which is now a body segment, not tail.\n\nBut the cell T is now occupied by head, and the previous tail segment is still at T, so there are two at T? No.\n\nWhen head moves to T, it occupies T, and since T had food, eating happens, so the tail does not move, so the previous tail segment remains at T, but now head is moving to T, so at the same position, collision.\n\nYes, that's the danger.\n\nSo if head moves to a cell that is the current tail position and it has food, and head was adjacent, it causes collision because both head and tail are at T after move, but head is moving to T, and tail is at T, so when head moves to T, it collides with the body segment at T.\n\nEven though it was tail, it is still a body segment.\n\nSo to avoid, only eat food at tail cell if head is not adjacent.\n\nIn this case, for (6,2), it's food, but tail is at (3,2), not adjacent, so no problem now.\n\nBut if tail moves to (6,2) later, and head is adjacent, then eating it would be dangerous.\n\nBut for now, no issue.\n\nBack to turn 23 decision.\n\nPerhaps the best is to move U to (2,6) on turn 23, to avoid the left edge and have more options.\n\nThen on turn 24, I can move to (1,6) to get the food at (1,5) later, or to (3,6) to go right.\n\nSince (1,5) has longer life, I can get it later.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is far.\n\nBut let's plan to eat (1,5) on a later turn.\n\nFor example, on turn 23, move U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 24, move L to (1,6)\n\nTurn 25, move D to (1,5) and eat it, as I had earlier.\n\nThen after eating, head at (1,5), direction D, and only can move D to (1,4) on turn 26.\n\nThen turn 26, move D to (1,4), no food, positions head (1,4), body (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) tail? After eating on turn 25, positions: head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\nTurn 26 move D to (1,4), no food, so head to (1,4), body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) — tail (3,4) moves off, new tail (4,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 27, from (1,4), direction D, cannot U.\n\nD to (1,3): free, move to (1,3)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo reach (6,2), I need to go right and down.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can move R to (2,3), then down to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (1,2) is wall, so (2,2) is free.\n\nBut it might take many turns.\n\nPerhaps after eating (1,5), on turn 26 I move D to (1,4), then turn 27 to (1,3), turn 28 to (2,3) since D to (1,2) wall, so only R or U, but direction D, cannot U, so R to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (2,2), (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nBy turn 28, the snake has moved, so positions change.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nPerhaps for long-term survival, I should stay in the center and go for the food at (6,2) later.\n\nBut (6,2) is at bottom, and there are walls.\n\nLet's list the free cells to see if there's a risk of trapping.\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,6), (3,1), (3,6), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,6), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) until turn 25, (6,2), (6,3), (6,5), (6,6) etc.\n\n(4,1) is free? (5,1) wall, (6,1) wall, but (4,1) not wall, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) free, (2,1) free, (1,1) free.\n\nBut (1,2) wall, so (1,1) is isolated? (1,1) can be accessed from (1,2) but (1,2) wall, so (1,1) is only accessible from (2,1) or (1,2) but (1,2) wall, so only from (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) can be from (2,2), (3,1), or (1,1) but (1,1) is corner.\n\nBut no food there, so not important.\n\nNow, for the snake, after moving U on turn 23, it is at (2,6), then to (3,6), etc., so it's in the top-right.\n\nTo go to (6,2), I can go down the right side.\n\nFor example, from (5,6) on turn 26, move D to (5,5), then to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), then to (6,2).\n\n(5,2) to (6,2) is adjacent.\n\n(5,2) is free, (6,2) food.\n\nOn turn 26, head at (5,6), move D to (5,5), no food, head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail (4,5) after move.\n\nTurn 27: move D to (5,4), if free, (5,4) not wall, not occupied, so move, head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) tail (4,5) moved off, new tail (3,5)\n\nTurn 28: move D to (5,3), head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) tail (3,5) moved off, new tail (2,5)\n\nTurn 29: move D to (5,2), head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) tail (2,5) moved off, new tail (2,6)? Positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) -- tail (2,6)\n\nLength 8.\n\nTurn 30: move R to (6,2), eat food, grow. Head to (6,2), tail does not move, so new positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) -- tail (2,6)\n\nLength 9.\n\nBut on turn 30, (6,2) life span 9 on turn 23, so turn 23 to 31, so on turn 30 it is there.\n\nLife span 9, countdown from turn 23, so present on turn 23 to 31, gone on turn 32.\n\nSo on turn 30, it is there.\n\nSo I can eat it.\n\nBut this is many turns ahead.\n\nFor turn 23, I need to start moving.\n\nBut in this path, I didn't eat (1,5), which disappeared on turn 28.\n\n(1,5) life span 6, turn 23 to 28, gone after 28, so on turn 29 not there.\n\nIn the above, I ate (6,2) on turn 30.\n\nBut I missed (1,5).\n\nIf I eat (1,5) on turn 23, I can still go to (6,2) later, but it might be longer.\n\nFor example, from (1,5) after eating, move D to (1,4) on turn 24, then to (1,3) on turn 25, then to (2,3) on turn 26, then to (2,2) on turn 27, then to (3,2) but (3,2) might be occupied or not, etc., to reach (6,2).\n\nBut it might take more turns.\n\nSince both foods are value 1, it doesn't matter which I eat first, but eating (1,5) now gives me growth earlier, which might help with survival, but also makes the snake longer, harder to maneuv r.\n\nIn this case, from length 7, eating one food makes 8, then another to 9.\n\nBut for survival, shorter snake is more agile.\n\nBut here, the grid has obstacles, so longer snake might get trapped easier.\n\nBut in this position, after eating (1,5), I am at edge, which might be riskier.\n\nWhereas if I move U to (2,6), I am more central.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (6,2) with long life, so I can plan to eat it later.\n\nBut (1,5) has shorter life, so I should eat it soon.\n\nOn turn 23, move L to (1,5) and eat it.\n\nThen for turn 24, move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nIf I move U to (1,6), then I can on turn 25 move R to (2,6), then down, etc.\n\nBut from (2,6), I can go right.\n\nLet's commit to a decision.\n\nI think for long-term, moving U to (2,6) is better to avoid the edge.\n\nThen on turn 24, move L to (1,6) to position to eat (1,5) on turn 25.\n\nThen after eating, I have to move down to (1,4) on turn 26, etc.\n\nBut then I can work my way right.\n\nSince the snake is long, I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nBut for now, let's output the actions.\n\nTurn 23: move U to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 24: move L to (1,6)\n\nTurn 25: move D to (1,5) and eat\n\nBut on turn 25, from (1,6) move D to (1,5), which is food, so eat.\n\nThen for turn 26, from (1,5) only can move D to (1,4), as U not possible.\n\nThen turn 27, from (1,4) move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 28, from (1,3) move R to (2,3) since D to (1,2) wall.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (2,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut I need to think only 5 turns ahead or so.\n\nThe answer should be for turns 23,24,25,26,27, etc., but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from turn 23.\n\nFor the box, it should be actions from turn 23 onwards for a few turns.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 23, move U.\n\nThen for turn 24, move L to (1,6)\n\nTurn 25, move D to (1,5) eat\n\nTurn 26, move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 27, move D to (1,3)\n\nBut on turn 27, from (1,3), after moving from (1,4) to (1,3) on turn 26, head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nOn turn 27, from (1,3), can move D to (1,2) but (1,2) wall, cannot; L wall; U to (1,4) but (1,4) is body, and U is opposite to D, so cannot; R to (2,3).\n\nSo only R to (2,3).\n\nSo move R.\n\nThen turn 28, from (2,3), can move to (2,2), (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not specify further.\n\nSince the food at (6,2) is there, I should head towards it after eating (1,5).\n\nBut from (1,3) or (2,3), I can go down and right.\n\nBut for the answer, I can put the first few moves.\n\nI think for turn 23, moving U is better.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 23):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 playable area (cells from (1,1) to (6,6)), with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n- **Snake**: \n  - Positions: Head at (2,5), body segments at (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), tail at (3,2). Length = 7.\n  - Current head direction: Left (L).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,6): Value +1, life span 3 (available until turn 25, disappears after).\n  - (1,5): Value +1, life span 6 (available until turn 28, disappears after).\n  - (6,2): Value +1, life span 9 (available until turn 31, disappears after).\n- **Constraints**:\n  - Cannot move opposite to current direction (L) on next turn (turn 23), so Right (R) is forbidden.\n  - From (2,5), possible moves: \n    - Up (U) to (2,6): Free (no wall or snake body).\n    - Down (D) to (2,4): Blocked (wall at (2,4)).\n    - Left (L) to (1,5): Free and has food.\n    - Right (R) to (3,5): Blocked (body collision and forbidden reverse).\n  - Thus, only U or L are viable on turn 23.\n\n**Key Considerations for 5+ Turn Planning:**\n- **Prioritize long-term survival and score maximization**: \n  - (5,6) has short life (only available until turn 25) but is unreachable by turn 25 due to distance (Manhattan distance 4 from (2,5)) and movement constraints (cannot move right on turn 23). Reaching it would require at least 4 moves, but it disappears after turn 25, so it is skipped.\n  - (1,5) can be eaten safely now or later (life span until turn 28). Eating it now grows the snake to length 8 but positions the snake near the left edge, reducing mobility. Deferring it allows better central positioning.\n  - (6,2) has long life (until turn 31) and is the primary target for later turns. Pathing to it requires avoiding obstacles and the snake's body.\n  - **Risks**: \n    - Moving left to (1,5) on turn 23 traps the snake near the edge, limiting future moves (e.g., only U or D on turn 24, then forced down to avoid walls).\n    - Moving up to (2,6) on turn 23 keeps the snake central, allowing access to (1,5) later and a clearer path to (6,2).\n  - **Tail Reward Danger**: Not an immediate threat—tail is at (3,2), not adjacent to head or food cells.\n- **5-Turn Plan (Turns 23-27)**:\n  - **Turn 23**: Move U to (2,6) to avoid edge trap and maintain mobility. No food eaten.\n  - **Turn 24**: From (2,6), head direction is U. Possible moves: U (wall), D (body collision and reverse forbidden), L to (1,6), or R to (3,6). Move L to (1,6) to position for eating (1,5) on turn 25. No food eaten.\n  - **Turn 25**: From (1,6), head direction is L. Possible moves: U (wall), D to (1,5), L (wall), R to (2,6). Move D to (1,5) to eat food. Snake grows to length 8.\n  - **Turn 26**: From (1,5), head direction is D. Possible moves: U (body collision and reverse forbidden), D to (1,4), L (wall), R (body collision). Move D to (1,4). No food eaten.\n  - **Turn 27**: From (1,4), head direction is D. Possible moves: U (reverse forbidden), D to (1,3), L (wall), R to (2,4) (wall). Move D to (1,3). No food eaten.\n- **Longer-term (Beyond Turn 27)**: \n  - From (1,3), move R to (2,3) on turn 28, then path towards (6,2) via safe cells (e.g., (2,2), (3,2), etc.), avoiding walls and body. Target eating (6,2) by turn 30-31.\n  - Monitor life spans and adjust if new food spawns.\n\n**Why this plan?**\n- Avoids immediate risk of edge trapping by not eating (1,5) on turn 23.\n- Eats (1,5) on turn 25 safely, scoring +1 and growing the snake.\n- Positions the snake to access open areas for survival and future food (6,2).\n- All moves are collision-free and respect movement constraints.\n\n**Answer Format:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: U (up)\nTurn 24: L (left)\nTurn 25: D (down)\nTurn 26: D (down)\nTurn 27: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 24, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8 cells.\n\nWalls include borders and internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. So these cells are blocked and I can't move into them.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,6), then body segments: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to get to (2,6).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,6) with life span 2, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,5) with life span 5, value +1\n\n- (6,2) with life span 8, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so they're all good to eat, but I need to consider the life span; they disappear after that many turns, including the current turn, so countdown decreases each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is 24, so for (5,6), life span 2, it will disappear after turn 25? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 24, life span is 2, meaning it will be there for this turn and next turn, and disappear after turn 25? Let me clarify the life span rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for a food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear after turn T + L - 1? For example, at turn T, life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn T+1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears.\n\nStandard interpretation: if life span is N at turn T, it means it will last for N more turns, including turn T. So it will be present on turns T, T+1, ..., T+N-1, and disappear at turn T+N.\n\nFor (5,6): life span 2 at turn 24. So it will be present on turn 24 and 25, disappear at turn 26.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5): life span 5 at turn 24, present on turns 24 to 28, disappear at 29.\n\n(6,2): life span 8, present turns 24 to 31, disappear at 32.\n\nNow, snake head is at (2,6), direction Up. Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But I cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is Up, so I cannot move Down next, because that would be reverse.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from Up, I can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid collisions: with walls, with body, except the tail under certain conditions.\n\nTail collision rule: I can move into the tail cell because the tail will move away, but there's a special case about eating food on tail with reward danger.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: borders are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nList all wall cells:\n\n- All border cells: so for x=0, all y; x=7, all y; y=0, all x; y=7, all x. But since it's a grid, corners are included once.\n\nActually, since it's cells, we need to list them, but in input, it says \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" meaning all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. Similarly, internal obstacles are given.\n\nSo wall cells:\n\n- For x=0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7)\n\n- x=7: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n- y=0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0) but (0,0) and (7,0) already included, so add (1,0) to (6,0) except when x=0 or x=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=7: (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7) with (0,7) and (7,7) already.\n\nBut since borders are covered, and internal obstacles are additional.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow, (1,2) is internal, but y=2 is not border, so it's separate.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1): x=5, y=1, not border.\n\n(2,4): x=2,y=4\n\n(6,4): x=6,y=4\n\n(6,1): x=6,y=1\n\nAnd borders include all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\nFor example, (1,0) is border because y=0.\n\n(1,2) is not border, but it's an internal obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is not border, internal obstacle.\n\nNow snake positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nSo head at (2,6), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3). Tail is (3,3).\n\nNow, food at: (5,6), (1,5), (6,2)\n\nAll with value +1 and life spans as above.\n\nHead direction Up, so from (2,6), possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (2,7)\n\n- Down: but cannot, because reverse is not allowed instantly. Current direction is Up, so moving Down would be opposite, not allowed.\n\n- Left: to (1,6)\n\n- Right: to (3,6)\n\nNow, check if these are valid.\n\nFirst, (2,7): y=7, which is border, so wall. Cannot move there.\n\n(1,6): x=1,y=6. Is this a wall? Borders: y=6 is not 0 or 7, x=1 not 0 or 7, so not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is wall, but (1,6) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6): x=3,y=6, not border, not in internal obstacles list.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,2) is wall, but (1,6) is different.\n\nSo possible moves: Left to (1,6) or Right to (3,6). Up to (2,7) is wall, Down not allowed.\n\nBut Down to (2,5) is where the body is? (2,5) is the second segment.\n\nMoving to (2,5) would be colliding with body? But (2,5) is the neck, and if I move down, head goes to (2,5), but at the same time, the tail moves, so the body shifts.\n\nCollision rule: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after movement, it might collide, but since the snake moves, the segments shift.\n\nWhen the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off its cell, so the cell that was tail is now free, and other body segments move to the next position.\n\nSo collision happens if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by any body segment except the tail, or if after movement, the head is on a body segment, but since all segments move, it's only a problem if the head moves to a segment that is not the tail.\n\nStandard Snake: when moving, if head moves to a cell that is part of the body before the tail moves, it collides, except if it's the tail cell, because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, body segments are: positions [ (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3) ] with head at (2,6).\n\nIf head moves to (2,5), which is currently occupied by the second segment. After move, head is at (2,5), and the body shifts: the segment that was at (2,5) moves to where the head was? No.\n\nSequence: snake positions before move: index 0: head (2,6), 1: (2,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (4,4), 5: (3,4), 6: tail (3,3)\n\nAfter moving head to a new position, say to (x,y), then the body segments follow: segment 1 moves to (2,6), segment 2 moves to (2,5)? No.\n\nThe new head position is (x,y), then the first body segment moves to the old head position (2,6), the second body segment moves to the old position of the first body segment, and so on, until the tail.\n\nSo, after move, the cell that was tail is vacated.\n\nTherefore, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by any body segment except the tail, it will collide because after movement, that cell might still be occupied or the head is on it.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to a cell that is currently body (not tail), then after movement, since that body segment moves to the next position, but the head is now on that cell, and depending on the order, it might be that the body segment is still there or not.\n\nIn terms of collision, it's immediate: if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any part of the body except the tail, it dies. For the tail, it's safe because the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, for (2,5): it is currently occupied by segment 1. If head moves down to (2,5), then after move, head is at (2,5), and segment 1 moves to (2,6), so (2,5) was occupied but now head is there, but segment 1 has moved, so no collision? But initially, when head moves to (2,5), it was occupied, so it should collide.\n\nI think the rule is: collision occurs if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by any body segment, except the tail segment.\n\nBecause for tail, it moves away, so it's safe.\n\nIn this case, (2,5) is not tail; tail is (3,3). So moving to (2,5) would cause collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, moving to any other body cell would cause collision.\n\nNow, possible cells to move: from (2,6), adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (2,7) - wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (2,5) - body segment, not tail, so collision\n\n- Left: (1,6) - not wall, not body, let's check if occupied.\n\nCurrent occupied cells by snake: (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\n(1,6) is not in this list, and not wall, so should be free.\n\n- Right: (3,6) - not in snake positions, not wall.\n\n(3,6) is not listed in snake, walls, or obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is wall, but (3,6) is not.\n\nSo both (1,6) and (3,6) are possible moves.\n\nNow, also, food: (5,6) is at (5,6), which is close.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 24, I must choose between Left to (1,6) or Right to (3,6).\n\nSince head direction is Up, moving Left or Right is allowed, not reverse.\n\nNow, let's think about the food and survival.\n\nFood at (5,6) has short life span, only 2, so it will disappear after turn 25. Meaning it's available on turn 24 and 25.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) has life span 5, available longer, (6,2) longer.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), which is near (1,6) if I move left.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which I might reach if I go right.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nTail is at (3,3), head at (2,6), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so |dx| + |dy| =1.\n\n(2,6) and (3,3): dx=1, dy=3, |dx|+|dy|=4, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue now.\n\nNow, let's plan moves.\n\nFirst, I need to maximize score, so eat food, but avoid risks, think long-term.\n\nPossible actions for turn 24: L or R.\n\nIf I go Left to (1,6):\n\n- New head position: (1,6)\n\n- Then body moves: head was at (2,6), so segment 1 moves to (2,6), segment 2 moves to (2,5)? Positions: after move, head at (1,6), then the body: segment 1 (which was at (2,5)) moves to old head (2,6), segment 2 (was at (3,5)) moves to (2,5), segment 3 (was at (4,5)) moves to (3,5), segment 4 (was at (4,4)) moves to (4,5), segment 5 (was at (3,4)) moves to (4,4), segment 6 (tail was at (3,3)) moves to (3,4). So new tail at (3,4)? Let's list:\n\nNew positions: head (1,6), then body: [ (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ]? No.\n\nOld positions: index 0: (2,6), 1: (2,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (4,4), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,3)\n\nAfter move to (1,6): new head at (1,6)\n\nThen segment 1 moves to old head position (2,6)\n\nSegment 2 moves to old position of segment 1, which is (2,5)\n\nSegment 3 moves to old position of segment 2, (3,5)\n\nSegment 4 moves to old position of segment 3, (4,5)\n\nSegment 5 moves to old position of segment 4, (4,4)\n\nSegment 6 moves to old position of segment 5, (3,4)\n\nSo new snake: head (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) — tail at (3,4)\n\nLength same, since no food eaten.\n\n(1,6) has no food, so no growth.\n\nFood positions: (5,6), (1,5), (6,2) — none at (1,6), so no eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go Right to (3,6):\n\nNew head (3,6), body: segment 1 to (2,6), segment 2 to (2,5), segment 3 to (3,5), etc., same as above but head at (3,6).\n\nNew snake: head (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\nAgain, no food at (3,6), so no eat.\n\nNow, after turn 24, I need to think about future turns.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (5,6) will disappear after turn 25, so only available on turn 24 and 25. Turn 24 I'm not eating it, so only turn 25 left to eat it if possible.\n\n(1,5) available longer, (6,2) longer.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options.\n\nOption 1: Move Left to (1,6) on turn 24.\n\nThen at (1,6), head position.\n\nPossible moves from there: current direction? After moving Left, the head direction is now Left? For no reverse, I need to know the new direction.\n\nAfter move, the head direction changes to the move direction.\n\nSo after moving Left from Up, new direction is Left.\n\nSo from (1,6), direction Left.\n\nPossible moves: cannot move Right (opposite), so can move Up, Down, Left.\n\nUp to (1,7): but y=7, border wall, invalid.\n\nDown to (1,5): is this valid? (1,5) has food, and it's not wall.\n\nLeft to (0,6): x=0, border wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move Down to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) has food, positive, so I can eat it.\n\nBut need to check if it's safe.\n\n(1,5) is a food position.\n\nNow, moving to (1,5): since it has food, when I move there, I eat it, so snake grows, length increases.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so new segment added.\n\nBut let's see turn by turn.\n\nFirst, turn 24: move L to (1,6), no eat.\n\nThen turn 25: from (1,6), direction Left, possible moves: only Down to (1,5), since Up and Left invalid.\n\nSo move Down to (1,5).\n\nNow, (1,5) has food, so eat it, value +1, length increases by 1.\n\nNew head at (1,5), and since food eaten, tail stays, so snake positions: head (1,5), then the body: old head was (1,6), so segment 1 moves to (1,6), then segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position, which is (2,6) from previous, let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 24: snake positions: head (1,6), body: (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\nNow turn 25: move Down to (1,5)\n\n(1,5) has food, so eat: new head at (1,5), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so the body segments remain, but a new segment is added at the tail? Standard: when food eaten, head moves to the cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays, and snake grows.\n\nPositions: new head at (1,5), then the previous head (1,6) becomes the first body segment, then the rest: (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), and since food eaten, the tail (3,4) stays, so new segment at (3,4), but (3,4) was tail, now it's part of body, and new tail is still there? Let's list.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ] with (1,6) head, (3,4) tail.\n\nMove head to (1,5): since (1,5) has food, eat it, so head now at (1,5), and the tail does not move, so the previous positions are: the segment that was at (1,6) becomes body, at (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) remains, and a new segment is added at the tail, which was (3,4), so now (3,4) has two segments? No.\n\nWhen food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo new positions: head at new position (1,5), then the old head position (1,6) becomes the first body segment, then the next body segments are the old ones: so [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ] and since food eaten, add a new segment at the end, so tail was (3,4), new segment added, so now positions: head (1,5), body: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), and tail (3,4) but (3,4) was the old tail, now it becomes the second last, and new tail at (3,4)? I'm confusing.\n\nStandard: when no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves off.\n\nWhen food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail stays, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added there, but since tail stays, it means the position is kept, and the snake extends.\n\nAfter eating, the new tail is the same as old tail position, because tail didn't move.\n\nFor example, before move, snake has positions S = [P0, P1, P2, ..., P_k] with P0 head, P_k tail.\n\nMove head to new position P_new.\n\nIf no food, new snake: [P_new, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}] , tail is P_{k-1}\n\nIf food eaten, new snake: [P_new, P0, P1, ..., P_k] , so tail is P_k, same as before, and length increased by one.\n\nIn this case, before turn 25 move: positions [ (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ] head (1,6), tail (3,4)\n\nMove to (1,5), food eaten, so new positions: head (1,5), then old head (1,6), then the rest: (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) and since food eaten, the tail (3,4) is kept, so now positions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ] with head (1,5), tail (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is the last, so tail at (3,4).\n\nLength now 8.\n\nNow, head at (1,5), direction? Last move was Down, from (1,6) to (1,5), so direction Down.\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,5): direction Down, so cannot move Up (opposite).\n\nCan move Down, Left, Right.\n\nDown to (1,4): y=4, not border, not wall? Walls: (1,4) is not border, not internal obstacle. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is wall, but (1,4) is not.\n\nLeft to (0,5): x=0, border wall, invalid.\n\nRight to (2,5): (2,5) is currently occupied? In new positions, (2,5) is a body segment, index 3 or something.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ]\n\nSo (2,5) is occupied by segment 4? Indices: head (1,5), seg1 (1,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (3,5), etc.\n\n(2,5) is seg3, which is body, not tail. Tail is (3,4).\n\nIf I move Right to (2,5), it is currently occupied by seg3, so collision, since not tail.\n\nCannot move Right.\n\nDown to (1,4): (1,4) not occupied, not wall.\n\nUp: cannot, opposite direction.\n\nLeft: invalid, wall.\n\nSo only possible move Down to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) no food, I assume.\n\nThen move to (1,4), no eat.\n\nThen from there, direction Down, can move Down to (1,3), or Left/Right but Left invalid, Right to (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is an internal obstacle, wall, from the list: internal obstacles include (2,4), so (2,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nDown to (1,3): not wall.\n\nBut (1,3) might be free.\n\nThen from (1,3), Down to (1,2), but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so dead end.\n\nFrom (1,4), move Down to (1,3), then from (1,3), can move Down to (1,2) but wall, or Right to (2,3) if possible.\n\n(2,3) not occupied, not wall? Walls: (2,4) is wall, but (2,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nIf I go left on turn 24, I end up eating (1,5) on turn 25, then forced to (1,4) on turn 26, then to (1,3) on turn 27, then to (2,3) or something, but at (1,3), direction Down, move to (1,2) invalid, so must move Right to (2,3), then from there I can go to other places.\n\nBut the area might be tight.\n\nNow, back to turn 24, if I go Right to (3,6).\n\nTurn 24: move R to (3,6), no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\nDirection now Right.\n\nTurn 25: from (3,6), direction Right.\n\nPossible moves: cannot move Left (opposite), so Up, Down, Right.\n\nUp to (3,7): y=7, border wall, invalid.\n\nDown to (3,5): (3,5) is currently occupied by body. Positions: (3,5) is segment 3? Head (3,6), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (3,5), etc. (3,5) is seg3, body, not tail. If move Down, to (3,5), collision.\n\nRight to (4,6): not occupied, not wall? (4,6) not border, not internal obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles: all below y=4 or something, (4,6) free.\n\nSo possible move Right to (4,6).\n\nAlso, Down invalid, Up invalid, so only Right to (4,6)? Or can I move Down if not occupied, but it is occupied.\n\nMoves: from (3,6), adjacent: (3,7) up wall, (3,5) down body, (2,6) left body, (4,6) right free.\n\n(2,6) is left, which is occupied by seg1, body, not tail, so cannot move left.\n\nOnly possible move is Right to (4,6).\n\nSo on turn 25, move R to (4,6), no food there.\n\nThen new head (4,6), direction Right.\n\nNow, from (4,6), direction Right.\n\nPossible moves: cannot move Left, so Up, Down, Right.\n\nUp to (4,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nDown to (4,5): (4,5) is currently occupied? Positions after move: head (4,6), body: old head (3,6) to seg1, then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\n(4,5) is segment 5? Positions: head (4,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (4,4), tail (3,4)? Tail is (3,4), but (4,4) is seg6.\n\nList: new positions after turn 25 move: head to (4,6), old head (3,6) becomes seg1, then seg2 to old seg1 (2,6), seg3 to old seg2 (2,5), seg4 to old seg3 (3,5), seg5 to old seg4 (4,5), seg6 to old seg5 (4,4), and tail to old seg6 (3,4)? Old positions before turn 25 move: [ (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ] head (3,6), tail (3,4)\n\nMove head to (4,6), no food, so new snake: head (4,6), then seg1 (3,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (4,4), tail (3,4)\n\nYes, (4,5) is seg5, body.\n\nSo from (4,6), move Down to (4,5): occupied by seg5, not tail, collision.\n\nMove Right to (5,6): (5,6) has food! And it's available.\n\n(5,6) is food with life span 2 at turn 24, so at turn 25, life span decreases to 1, still present, since disappears after turn 25? Turn 24: life span 2, present turn 24 and 25, disappear at turn 26.\n\nSo at turn 25, (5,6) is still there.\n\nMove to (5,6) to eat it.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is not occupied, not wall.\n\nMove Right to (5,6).\n\nDirection from (4,6) to (5,6) is Right, same as current direction.\n\nAfter move, head at (5,6), eat food, so snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head (5,6), then old head (4,6) becomes seg1, then the body: seg1 (3,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (4,4), and since food eaten, tail (3,4) stays, so new segment added, positions: [ (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ] with head (5,6), tail (3,4)\n\nLength 9.\n\nNow, head at (5,6), direction Right.\n\nBut (5,6) has an issue: it's near the top, and walls.\n\nPossible moves from (5,6): direction Right, so cannot move Left.\n\nCan move Up, Down, Right.\n\nUp to (5,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nDown to (5,5): (5,5) is it free? Not occupied, not wall? Walls: (5,1) is internal obstacle, but (5,5) not.\n\n(5,5) should be free.\n\nRight to (6,6): (6,6) not wall, not border? x=6,y=6, not x=0 or7, y=0 or7? x=6, but x=7 is border, x=6 is not, unless internal.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), but (6,6) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut (6,4) is wall, (6,6) different.\n\nNow, if I move Down to (5,5), or Right to (6,6).\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,2), which is far.\n\nBut in the left option, I ate (1,5), now in right option, I ate (5,6).\n\nBut in left option, I was forced into a corner, might die soon.\n\nIn right option, after eating (5,6), I am at (5,6), and can go to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nNow, let's see the board.\n\nI should consider the grid.\n\nDraw a grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders all around.\n\nInternal walls: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake initially at turn 24: head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nFood: (5,6), (1,5), (6,2)\n\nIf I go left on turn 24 to (1,6), then turn 25 to (1,5) eat, then turn 26 to (1,4), then turn 27 to (1,3), then from (1,3) I can move Right to (2,3) or Down to (1,2) but (1,2) wall, so only Right to (2,3).\n\nAt (1,3), direction Down (from moving down to (1,3)? After turn 26: at (1,4), moved Down to (1,4), so direction Down.\n\nFrom (1,4), move Down to (1,3), direction Down.\n\nThen at (1,3), move Down to (1,2) invalid, so must move Right to (2,3), since Left invalid, Up opposite? Current direction Down, so can move Down, Left, Right.\n\nDown to (1,2) wall, Left to (0,3) wall, Right to (2,3) free.\n\nSo move to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), direction? Last move Right, so direction Right.\n\nThen can move Up, Down, Right. Left not allowed.\n\nUp to (2,4) but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nDown to (2,2): not wall, not occupied? Need to see.\n\nBut snake is growing, positions changing.\n\nThis seems messy, and I might get trapped.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), if I move Down to (2,2), or Right to (3,3), but (3,3) might be occupied later.\n\nIn the long run, the snake is long, and the board has obstacles, so space is limited.\n\nIn the right option, after eating (5,6), at (5,6), I can move Down to (5,5) or Right to (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is free, (6,6) free.\n\nThen from there, I can go towards (6,2) or other.\n\nAlso, there is (1,5) still available, but far.\n\n(6,2) has long life span.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nAnother thing: in the left option, when I ate (1,5) on turn 25, but (1,5) was at (1,5), and tail was at (3,4), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n\nSimilarly for (5,6).\n\nNow, back to turn 24 choice.\n\nIf I go right to (3,6) on turn 24, then to (4,6) on turn 25, then to (5,6) eat on turn 25? Turn 25 move to (5,6) and eat.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 24: move R to (3,6), no eat.\n\nTurn 25: move R to (4,6)? From (3,6) I moved to (4,6), then to (5,6) on turn 26? Let's clarify turns.\n\nTurn 24: move to (3,6)\n\nThen turn 25: from (3,6), I can move to (4,6), as above.\n\nBut when I move to (4,6), it's turn 25, and (5,6) is still available until turn 25, since life span 2, present on 24 and 25.\n\nSo on turn 25, from (4,6), I can move directly to (5,6) to eat it.\n\nIn the move from (4,6) to (5,6), I eat on turn 25.\n\nIn the action, on turn 25, I move to (5,6) and eat.\n\nThen I am at (5,6) for turn 26.\n\nNow, from (5,6), I can move Down to (5,5) or Right to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is near (6,4) wall, but (6,6) is free.\n\n(5,5) is free.\n\nLet's see what is better.\n\nI could go Down to (5,5), then to (5,4), but (5,4) might be free, or to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut there is (6,2) food below.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's simulate both paths.\n\nFirst, option left: turn 24 L to (1,6)\n\nTurn 25: D to (1,5) eat\n\nTurn 26: D to (1,4)  // only choice\n\nTurn 27: D to (1,3)  // only choice, since (1,2) wall\n\nTurn 28: from (1,3), direction Down, move R to (2,3)  // only choice\n\nNow at (2,3), direction Right.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4) but (2,4) wall, invalid\n\nD to (2,2)  // assume free\n\nR to (3,3)  // but (3,3) might be occupied?\n\nCurrent positions after turn 28: let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 27: snake after move to (1,3)\n\nStart from turn 25: after eating (1,5), positions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ] head (1,5), tail (3,4)\n\nTurn 26: move D to (1,4), no food, so new head (1,4), then body: seg1 to old head (1,5), seg2 to (1,6), seg3 to (2,6), seg4 to (2,5), seg5 to (3,5), seg6 to (4,5), tail to (4,4)? Old tail was (3,4), but no food, so tail moves.\n\nBefore move: head (1,5), seg1 (1,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (4,4), tail (3,4)? Positions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) ] so index 0 head (1,5), 1 (1,6), 2 (2,6), 3 (2,5), 4 (3,5), 5 (4,5), 6 (4,4), 7 tail (3,4) length 8.\n\nMove head to (1,4), no food, so new head (1,4), then seg1 to old head (1,5), seg2 to old seg1 (1,6), seg3 to old seg2 (2,6), seg4 to old seg3 (2,5), seg5 to old seg4 (3,5), seg6 to old seg5 (4,5), tail to old seg6 (4,4)? Old seg6 is (4,4), but tail was (3,4), I think I have error.\n\nOld positions: let's list with indices:\n\n- 0: (1,5) head\n\n- 1: (1,6)\n\n- 2: (2,6)\n\n- 3: (2,5)\n\n- 4: (3,5)\n\n- 5: (4,5)\n\n- 6: (4,4)\n\n- 7: (3,4) tail\n\nMove head to (1,4), no food, so new head (1,4), then seg1 to old head (1,5), seg2 to old seg1 (1,6), seg3 to old seg2 (2,6), seg4 to old seg3 (2,5), seg5 to old seg4 (3,5), seg6 to old seg5 (4,5), seg7 to old seg6 (4,4), and tail moves to old seg7 (3,4), so new tail at (3,4)? New positions: head (1,4), seg1 (1,5), seg2 (1,6), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (3,5), seg6 (4,5), seg7 (4,4), tail (3,4)\n\nBut (3,4) is the tail position.\n\nThen turn 27: move D to (1,3), no food, so new head (1,3), then seg1 to (1,4), seg2 to (1,5), seg3 to (1,6), seg4 to (2,6), seg5 to (2,5), seg6 to (3,5), seg7 to (4,5), tail to (4,4)\n\nPositions: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,4)\n\nThen turn 28: from (1,3), direction Down, move R to (2,3), no food.\n\nNew head (2,3), seg1 to (1,3), seg2 to (1,4), seg3 to (1,5), seg4 to (1,6), seg5 to (2,6), seg6 to (2,5), seg7 to (3,5), tail to (4,5)? Old tail (4,4), so new positions: head (2,3), seg1 (1,3), seg2 (1,4), seg3 (1,5), seg4 (1,6), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (2,5), seg7 (3,5), tail (4,5) but (4,5) was seg6 old, let's not list all.\n\nThe point is, the snake is coiling in the left area, and soon it might block itself or hit wall.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), I can move to (2,2) or (3,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) wall.\n\n(3,3) might be free, but eventually, with the snake long, it could be problematic.\n\nIn the right option, after eating (5,6), at (5,6) on turn 25 or 26? Let's clarify the turn for eating (5,6).\n\nTurn 24: move R to (3,6) - turn 24 action\n\nThen turn 25: from (3,6), move R to (4,6) - but earlier I said from (3,6) I can only move to (4,6), then on the same turn 25, I am at (4,6), but I need to move to (5,6) on turn 26? No, each turn is one move.\n\nOn turn 25, from position at start of turn 25, which is after turn 24 move.\n\nAt start of turn 25, head at (3,6), direction Right.\n\nI move to (4,6) on turn 25 action.\n\nThen at (4,6), no food, so positions update.\n\nThen for turn 26, I am at (4,6), direction Right, and I can move to (5,6) to eat.\n\nBut (5,6) life span: at turn 24, life span 2, so present turn 24 and 25, disappear at turn 26. So on turn 26, it is not there anymore.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn 24, food (5,6) has life span 2, meaning after turn 24, life span decreases to 1 at turn 25, and after turn 25, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not present on turn 26.\n\nSo on turn 25, (5,6) is still present with life span 1.\n\nOn turn 25, when I am at (3,6), I can move directly to (5,6)? No, I can only move to adjacent cells, not directly to (5,6).\n\nFrom (3,6), adjacent are (3,7) up wall, (3,5) down body, (2,6) left body, (4,6) right free.\n\n(5,6) is not adjacent to (3,6), it's two steps away.\n\nSo on turn 25, I can only move to (4,6), which is not food.\n\nThen on turn 26, (5,6) is gone, so I miss it.\n\nIn the right option, I cannot eat (5,6) because by turn 25 I am at (3,6) or (4,6), not at (5,6).\n\nTurn 24: at (3,6)\n\nTurn 25: move to (4,6)\n\nBut (5,6) is only reachable from (4,6) or (5,5) or (5,7), but (5,7) wall, (5,5) not adjacent to current.\n\nFrom (4,6), on turn 25, I can move to (5,6) if I choose, but in the move from (3,6) to (4,6) on turn 25, I am at (4,6) at the end of turn 25.\n\nThen for turn 26, I am at (4,6), and (5,6) is not present anymore.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,6) in this path.\n\nOnly in the left option I ate (1,5), but (5,6) expires without being eaten.\n\nNow, for the right option, on turn 24 move R to (3,6), turn 25 move R to (4,6), then at (4,6), direction Right.\n\nTurn 26: from (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5) body (as earlier, (4,5) is occupied), R to (5,6) but (5,6) gone, L to (3,6) but (3,6) is body or not.\n\nPositions after turn 25 move to (4,6): head (4,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (4,4), tail (3,4)\n\n(4,5) is seg5, body.\n\n(3,6) is seg1, body.\n\nSo from (4,6), move Down to (4,5) occupied, collision.\n\nMove Left to (3,6) occupied, collision.\n\nMove Up invalid, move Right to (5,6) but no food, and it's gone, so just empty cell, but (5,6) is free, no wall.\n\nMove to (5,6) is possible, no collision.\n\n(5,6) is not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo on turn 26, move R to (5,6), no food, so no eat.\n\nThen new head (5,6), etc.\n\nThen I can go from there.\n\nBut I missed the food.\n\nIn the left option, I at least ate one food.\n\nBut in left option, I might die soon.\n\nAnother choice: on turn 24, if I go left, I eat (1,5) on turn 25.\n\nIf I go right, I don't eat any food immediately, but I can go for (6,2) later.\n\nBut (6,2) has life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, let's consider the grid with obstacles.\n\nInternal walls: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is wall, which is below the snake.\n\nIn the current state, snake is from (2,6) to (3,3), so the area around (3,3) to (4,4) is occupied.\n\nIf I go right to (3,6), then to (4,6), then to (5,6), etc., I can head down towards (6,2).\n\nFor example, from (5,6) on turn 26, I can move Down to (5,5), then to (5,4), but (5,4) might be free, or to (6,5), then to (6,4) but (6,4) is wall, so cannot.\n\n(6,4) is wall, so from (6,5), I can move to (6,3) or something.\n\nBut let's not simulate too far.\n\nPerhaps going right is better for long-term survival because the board is more open on the right and bottom.\n\nOn the left, with walls at (1,2) and border, it's tight.\n\nAlso, food at (6,2) is in the bottom right.\n\nSo for long-term, moving right might be better.\n\nBut on turn 24, I have to choose L or R.\n\nSince (5,6) expires soon and I can't eat it unless I go directly, but from (2,6), to reach (5,6) in one move impossible, in two moves: to (3,6) then (4,6), but on turn 25 at (4,6), (5,6) is still there, but I can only move to it on turn 26 if it were there, but it disappears after turn 25.\n\nTurn 25: at start of turn 25, if I am at (3,6), I can move to (4,6), but not to (5,6).\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,6) in any case, because to reach it from (2,6) takes two moves: to (3,6) or (2,7) invalid, or to (1,6) then not closer.\n\nFrom (2,6), to (5,6) is distance 3 in x, same y, so at least two moves, but on turn 24 I move to (3,6) or (1,6), then on turn 25 I move to (4,6) or (1,5), neither is (5,6), and on turn 26 it's gone.\n\nSo (5,6) cannot be eaten; it will disappear uneaten.\n\nSimilarly, in left path, I ate (1,5), which is good.\n\nIn right path, I don't eat on turn 25.\n\nBut (1,5) has life span 5, so I can eat it later if I go left.\n\nIf I go right, I can eat (6,2) later.\n\nBut (1,5) is on left, (6,2) on right.\n\nSo for long-term, I should go where there is more space.\n\nLet's assess the board.\n\nThe snake is currently in the top-left area.\n\nInternal walls block some areas.\n\nFor example, with walls at (2,4), (1,2), etc., the left side has less free space.\n\nRight side has wall at (6,4), (6,1), but (6,2) is food, so I need to go there.\n\nAlso, the bottom has space.\n\nPerhaps moving right allows me to access more area.\n\nMoreover, in the left option, after eating (1,5), I am forced down and might get stuck.\n\nFor example, at (1,3), I move to (2,3), then to (2,2), then to (3,2), etc., but with the long snake, it might self-collide.\n\nWhereas in right, I can go to (4,6), then to (5,6) even if no food, then to (5,5), then to (5,4), or to (6,6), then to (6,5), then to (6,3) since (6,4) wall, etc.\n\n(6,4) wall, so from (6,5) I can move to (6,3) if possible, but not adjacent, or to (7,5) wall, or to (6,4) wall, so only Down to (6,4) invalid, or Left to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I can manage.\n\nAlso, there might be other food later, but not specified, so only these three for now.\n\nBut the state has only these foods, so I need to eat them.\n\n(6,2) is available for many turns.\n\nSo for turn 24, I think going right is better for long-term survival.\n\nThen on turn 25, I move to (4,6), then turn 26 to (5,6) if possible, but no food, then from there down.\n\nBut let's define the actions.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for the current turn and possibly future, but in the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a sequence of actions starting from turn 24.\n\nBut how many turns? It doesn't specify, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions or so.\n\nBut in practice, I can plan the first few moves.\n\nSince the state may change, I can provide for turns 24 to 28 or something.\n\nBut for now, for turn 24, I choose to move Right to (3,6).\n\nThen for turn 25, from (3,6), I can only move Right to (4,6), as established.\n\nThen for turn 26, from (4,6), I can move Right to (5,6) or Down to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, so only Right to (5,6).\n\nThen at (5,6), I can move Down to (5,5) or Right to (6,6).\n\nLet's say I go Down to (5,5) to head towards (6,2).\n\nThen from (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can provide the sequence based on the plan.\n\nSince all food is positive, and I need to avoid risks, moving right seems less risky.\n\nAlso, in the left move, when I go to (1,6), then to (1,5), but (1,5) is food, and I eat it, but is there any danger? Tail is at (3,4), not adjacent, so ok.\n\nBut after that, I am cramped.\n\nWhereas on right, I have more space.\n\nMoreover, with the internal wall at (2,4), it blocks the center, so moving right avoids that area.\n\nSo I think for turn 24, move Right.\n\nThen turn 25 move Right to (4,6)\n\nTurn 26 move Right to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 27 from (5,6) move Down to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 28 from (5,5) move Down to (5,4) if possible, or Right, etc.\n\nBut let's see if (5,4) is free.\n\nWalls: (5,1) is wall, but (5,4) not, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, no obstacles.\n\nThen I can continue to (5,3), etc., towards (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), so from (5,4), I can go to (6,4) but (6,4) wall, so to (5,2) or (6,3), etc.\n\nBut I can reach it.\n\nIn the sequence, for the answer, I can provide for turns 24 to 28.\n\nBut turn 24 is t1=24.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 24: R\n\nTurn 25: R (to (4,6))\n\nTurn 26: R (to (5,6))\n\nThen for turn 27, from (5,6), after moving to (5,6) on turn 26, no eat, so positions: head at (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)? After turn 26 move to (5,6), no food, so new head (5,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (3,5), seg6 (4,5), seg7 (4,4), tail (3,4)\n\nDirection Right.\n\nThen turn 27: from (5,6), move Down to (5,5), which is free.\n\nThen at (5,5), direction Down.\n\nThen turn 28: move Down to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (5,4) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, I can add that.\n\nTo be safe, I can output only the necessary, but since the format allows multiple, I can do a few.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,5) is still available, but I'm going away from it, so I might not eat it, but it's ok, since (6,2) is there.\n\n(1,5) life span 5, from turn 24, so available until turn 28, disappear at turn 29.\n\nBut I'm on the right, so prob not eating it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) life span 8, available until turn 31.\n\nSo I can reach it.\n\nFor the answer, I'll go with right moves.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned moves 5 turns ahead (turns 24 to 28). The key considerations are:\n- **Immediate risks**: At turn 24, the snake head is at (2,6) with direction Up. Moving Up (to (2,7)) is invalid (wall), and moving Down (to (2,5)) causes body collision. Only Left (to (1,6)) or Right (to (3,6)) are safe.\n- **Food availability**: \n  - (5,6) has a life span of 2 (available only on turns 24 and 25), but it is unreachable in time due to distance and movement constraints. Moving towards it would not allow eating it before it disappears.\n  - (1,5) has a life span of 5 (available until turn 28), but moving Left to access it leads to a cramped area with walls and obstacles, increasing collision risk long-term.\n  - (6,2) has a life span of 8 (available until turn 31), providing more time to reach it. Moving Right opens a path to this food and avoids tight spaces.\n- **Long-term survival**: Moving Right provides more open space on the grid, reducing the risk of self-collision or wall hits. The path avoids known obstacles and allows navigation toward (6,2). Moving Left forces the snake into a corner near walls ((1,2) obstacle and borders), with limited escape routes after eating (1,5), risking entrapment.\n- **Turn-by-turn plan**:\n  - **Turn 24**: Move Right (R) to (3,6). This avoids immediate danger and positions the snake for better mobility.\n  - **Turn 25**: From (3,6) with direction Right, only Right to (4,6) is safe (Up and Down are invalid, Left is reverse and not allowed).\n  - **Turn 26**: From (4,6) with direction Right, move Right to (5,6). (5,6) has no food (expired), but this is safe and progresses downward.\n  - **Turn 27**: From (5,6) with direction Right, move Down (D) to (5,5). This heads toward (6,2) and avoids walls.\n  - **Turn 28**: From (5,5) with direction Down, move Down (D) to (5,4). This continues the path to (6,2) with minimal risk.\n\nThis sequence prioritizes survival and sets up for eating (6,2) in future turns (beyond turn 28). No food is eaten in turns 24-28, but the snake remains safe and positions for future rewards.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 25: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 26: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 27: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 28: D (down)\n}",

The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive, I think. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me check.\n\nBorder cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the grid is 8x8, but cells like (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, I assume. x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see the snake positions: head at (3,6), which is y=6, and y=7 is wall, so y=6 is playable since walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y from 0 to 7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable? Similarly for x.\n\nSnake positions: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4). (3,6) has y=6, and walls at y=7, so y=6 is playable. Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 should be playable. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to x=6 playable.\n\nNow, internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (5,6,1,1) → position (5,6), value 1, life span 1\n\n- (1,5,4,1) → (1,5), value 1, life span 4\n\n- (6,2,7,1) → (6,2), value 1, life span 7\n\n- (3,1,10,1) → (3,1), value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n\nSnake head direction: R (right)\n\nCurrent turn: t1=25\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). These are also blocked.\n\nSo free cells are playable minus obstacles and snake body.\n\nSnake positions: head (3,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4). So the snake has 7 segments.\n\nList: index 0: head (3,6), 1: (2,6), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (4,4), 6: (3,4) tail.\n\nNow, head is at (3,6), direction right, so moving right.\n\nPossible moves from head: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n\nBut no instant reverse: current direction R, so cannot move L (left) next, because that would be opposite.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed because it would reverse direction.\n\nNow, check what cells are around head (3,6):\n\n- Up: (3,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Down: (3,5) but (3,5) is a body segment? Snake positions: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), ... yes, (3,5) is the fourth segment, so it's occupied by body. But can I move to (3,5)? It's the tail? Let's see.\n\nCollision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail moves forward, so head can move to where the tail was, but only if it's the tail cell.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, no collision.\n\nIn this case, current tail is at (3,4). When snake moves, the tail moves to the next position.\n\nAfter a move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail not removed, snake grows.\n\nBut for collision, at the moment of move, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it's collision, except if that cell is the current tail position, because after move, tail moves away.\n\nSo for (3,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,7) - y=7, wall, invalid.\n\n- D: (3,5) - now, (3,5) is occupied by the snake body, specifically, it's the segment at index 3: (3,5). Is it the tail? Tail is (3,4), so (3,5) is not tail. Therefore, moving to (3,5) would cause collision with body, deadly.\n\n- L: (2,6) - (2,6) is occupied by the first body segment, index 1. Not tail. Also, L is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed anyway.\n\n- R: (4,6) - is this free? x=4,y=6.\n\nCheck if occupied or wall.\n\nWalls: x=4,y=6, x=4 between 1-6, y=6, which is playable? y=6 is not wall, walls at y=7.\n\ny=6 is playable, x=4 is between 1-6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — none at (4,6)\n\nSnake positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) — no (4,6)\n\nSo (4,6) should be free.\n\nBut is there food? Food at (5,6), (1,5), (6,2), (3,1) — not (4,6)\n\nSo moving R to (4,6) is possible.\n\nBut we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (5,6) has life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nFood: (5,6,1,1) — position (5,6), value 1, life span 1.\n\nCurrent turn t1=25. So at turn 25, life span is 1, meaning after this turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears? Or before?\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food with life span L, it appears and countdown starts at L, decreases each turn. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning?\n\nTypically, it should be: at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L more turns, so after turn t+L-1 or something.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so at the turn it is spawned, countdown is L, decreases by 1 each turn. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after?\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor example, if life span is 1, at turn t, countdown=1, after turn t, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so it is only available during turn t.\n\nSimilarly, if life span 2, at turn t countdown=2, after turn t it becomes 1, after turn t+1 it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo for food at (5,6) with life span 1: at turn 25, it is present, but after turn 25, it will disappear, so it can only be eaten on turn 25.\n\nIf not eaten on turn 25, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (1,5) life span 4, so available from turn 25 to 28 (since after turn 28, countdown 0? At turn 25, life span 4, so after turn 25: 3, after 26:2, after 27:1, after 28:0 disappear. So available turns 25,26,27,28.\n\nLife span N, available for N turns starting from current turn.\n\nAt turn t, life span L, it is available on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears after turn t+L-1.\n\nFor (5,6): L=1, available only on turn 25.\n\n(1,5): L=4, available turns 25,26,27,28.\n\n(6,2): L=7, available turns 25 to 31.\n\n(3,1): L=10, available turns 25 to 34.\n\nNow, back to possible moves from head at (3,6) dir R.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, R (L not allowed due to reverse)\n\nU: (3,7) - wall, invalid.\n\nD: (3,5) - body segment (not tail), so collision, invalid.\n\nR: (4,6) - free, as we thought.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (4,6)? But is that right? What about other directions?\n\nU is invalid, D is invalid, L invalid, R valid. So only one choice for this turn?\n\nBut we need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAfter moving R to (4,6), the snake head is at (4,6), and direction is now R.\n\nThen for next turn, possible moves.\n\nBut let's see the food situation.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is adjacent to (4,6), and it has life span 1, only available this turn. If I don't eat it now, it disappears.\n\nBut to eat it, I need to move to (5,6) this turn.\n\nFrom current position (3,6), I can only move R to (4,6), not directly to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is two steps right from (3,6): from (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,6).\n\nBut on this turn, I can only move to (4,6), and (5,6) is available only this turn, so after this move, on turn 26, (5,6) is gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,6) because I can't reach it in one move from current position.\n\nCurrent position (3,6), to (5,6) is not adjacent; it's two cells away. I can only move one cell per turn.\n\nSo impossible to eat (5,6) this turn. It will disappear after this turn.\n\nSo no point worrying about it.\n\nNow, other food.\n\n(1,5) at (1,5), life span 4, available turns 25-28.\n\n(6,2) at (6,2), life span 7.\n\n(3,1) at (3,1), life span 10.\n\nSnake head at (3,6), after moving to (4,6), head at (4,6).\n\nThen possible moves from (4,6): U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction is R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nU: (4,7) - y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD: (4,5) - what is (4,5)? Snake body: positions include (4,5), which is index 4. Tail is (3,4), so (4,5) is body, not tail, so moving to (4,5) would collide.\n\nL: (3,6) - but (3,6) was the previous head, now after move, the body will be there? When I move to (4,6), the new head is (4,6), body segments: the previous head (3,6) becomes the first body segment, then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), and tail (3,4) will be removed if no food eaten.\n\nSince I moved to (4,6) which has no food, so no growth, tail (3,4) is removed, and the new tail is the previous second last, which is (4,4)? Let's see the new snake after moving to (4,6):\n\nOld positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4) tail.\n\nAfter move R to (4,6): new head (4,6), then body: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4). The last segment (3,4) is removed, so tail is now (4,4).\n\nSnake segments: new head at (4,6), followed by the previous head (3,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and (4,4) as tail.\n\nLength is still 7, no growth.\n\nNow from (4,6), possible moves:\n\nU: (4,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD: (4,5) - (4,5) is now a body segment, specifically, it's the fifth segment in the new list: segments: 0:(4,6), 1:(3,6), 2:(2,6), 3:(2,5), 4:(3,5), 5:(4,5), 6:(4,4) tail.\n\n(4,5) is index 5, not tail, tail is (4,4). So moving to (4,5) would collide with body.\n\nL: (3,6) - (3,6) is body segment index 1, not tail, so collision. Also, L is opposite to current direction R? After moving R, direction is R, so moving L is reverse, not allowed.\n\nR: (5,6) - what is here? (5,6) had food, but after turn 25, it disappears, so on turn 26, (5,6) is empty, I assume.\n\nWalls: no, x=5,y=6, playable.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), etc. not (5,6).\n\nSnake: after move, snake occupies (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4). No (5,6).\n\nSo (5,6) is free.\n\nSo from (4,6), only possible move is R to (5,6), since U, D, L all invalid or not allowed.\n\nU invalid, D invalid, L not allowed and invalid, R valid.\n\nSo on turn 26, head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: U, D, R (L not allowed).\n\nU: (5,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD: (5,5) - is it free? (5,5) not in walls, not in obstacles: obstacles (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (5,5) not there.\n\nSnake: current positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,4)? After moving to (5,6), no food, so tail removed, new tail: previous segments minus tail.\n\nFrom (4,6) move R to (5,6): new head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). Tail is (4,5)? Segments: 0:(5,6), 1:(4,6), 2:(3,6), 3:(2,6), 4:(2,5), 5:(3,5), 6:(4,5) tail.\n\n(4,5) is tail.\n\nNow from (5,6), moves:\n\nD: (5,5) - is it occupied? Snake has (4,5) at tail, but (5,5) not in body positions. Body positions: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). (5,5) is not occupied, and not wall, not obstacle.\n\nSo (5,5) is free.\n\nR: (6,6) - x=6,y=6, playable. Not wall, not obstacle, not occupied.\n\nU invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: D or R.\n\nL is not allowed, reverse.\n\nSo actions: D or R.\n\nNow, we need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood available:\n\n(1,5) at (1,5), available turns 25-28. Turn 25 gone, turn 26 is 26, still available.\n\n(6,2) at (6,2), available.\n\n(3,1) at (3,1), available.\n\nFrom (5,6), if I move D to (5,5), or R to (6,6).\n\nIf I move R to (6,6), then head at (6,6), direction R.\n\nThen possible moves from (6,6): U invalid (y=7), D (6,5), L (5,6), R (7,6) wall invalid.\n\nDirection R, so cannot move L (reverse).\n\nD: (6,5) - what is here? Not wall, obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) not listed, so should be free? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (6,5) not there.\n\nSnake: after moving to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), tail (4,5)? Let's not get ahead.\n\nFrom (5,6), if I move R to (6,6), then from there, only D or L, but L is reverse, not allowed, so only D to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) might be free.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (6,4), so (6,5) should be ok.\n\nBut let's see the area.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the whole grid.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: x=0,7 y=0,7 borders.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo blocked cells: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nFood: (5,6), but only turn 25, so after that gone. (1,5), (6,2), (3,1)\n\nSnake: positions: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4)\n\nAfter turn 25 move to (4,6), snake: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)\n\nThen after turn 26 move to (5,6), snake: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n\nTail at (4,5)\n\nNow from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5) or R to (6,6)\n\nIf I move R to (6,6), then at (6,6), direction R, then only possible move D to (6,5), since U invalid, L reverse not allowed, R invalid.\n\nThen at (6,5), head, then possible moves: U (6,6) body, D (6,4) obstacle, L (5,5), R invalid.\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, so D invalid.\n\nU: (6,6) is body, not tail, so collision.\n\nL: (5,5) may be free.\n\nBut direction from (6,6) to (6,5) is D, so direction down.\n\nThen at (6,5), direction D, so possible moves: L, R, D? But no reverse, so cannot move U (up).\n\nPossible moves from (6,5) dir D: L (5,5), R (7,5) wall invalid, D (6,4) obstacle, so only L to (5,5) possible.\n\n(5,5) should be free.\n\nThen head to (5,5), and so on.\n\nBut this seems like going to a corner, might be risky.\n\nFrom (5,6), moving D to (5,5) might be better.\n\n(5,5) is free, as we said.\n\nThen from (5,5), direction down (since moved D from (5,6)).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R but no reverse, so cannot move U (up).\n\nD: (5,4) - what is here? Not wall, obstacles: (6,4) but (5,4) not listed, so free? Snake: after moving to (5,5), positions depend on previous.\n\nLet's step back.\n\nWe need to plan for multiple turns, starting from turn 25.\n\nAt turn 25, from (3,6) dir R, only possible move is R to (4,6). Is that true?\n\nEarlier I thought U, D, L all invalid, only R valid.\n\nU: (3,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD: (3,5) body, not tail, collision, invalid.\n\nL: (2,6) body, not tail, and reverse, invalid.\n\nR: (4,6) free, valid.\n\nSo for turn 25, only action is R.\n\nSo must move R to (4,6).\n\nThen turn 26, from (4,6) dir R, only possible move R to (5,6), as U, D, L invalid or not allowed.\n\nU wall, D body, L reverse and body.\n\nR to (5,6) free.\n\nSo turn 26: R to (5,6).\n\nNow turn 27, from (5,6) dir R, possible moves: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nBoth possible.\n\nNow, we need to choose.\n\nAlso, food to consider.\n\n(1,5) at (1,5), available turns 25-28. Turn 27 is within.\n\n(6,2) at (6,2), available.\n\n(3,1) at (3,1), available.\n\nFrom (5,6), if I move R to (6,6), then as above, I go to (6,5), then to (5,5), etc.\n\nIf I move D to (5,5), then I can go south.\n\nLet's list the free cells and plan a path.\n\nFirst, grid:\n\ny=6: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 but obstacles none on y=6, snake occupies: after turn 26, snake at (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n\nSo on y=6, cells (1,6), (6,6) free? (1,6) and (6,6) are free, but (1,6) not occupied, (6,6) free.\n\nBut (1,6) has no food, etc.\n\ny=5: x=1 to 6, obstacles none on y=5, but snake has (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and (1,5) has food.\n\n(1,5) is food position.\n\nAlso (5,5) free, (6,5) free.\n\ny=4: x=1 to 6, obstacles: (2,4) and (6,4), snake has (4,4) but after moves, it changes.\n\nAt turn 26, snake tail is at (4,5), so (4,4) is free now? After move to (5,6), tail is (4,5), so (4,4) is free.\n\nCells on y=4: (1,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4) free? (2,4) obstacle, (6,4) obstacle, so (1,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4) free, but (3,4) was tail earlier, but now free.\n\nSimilarly, y=3, etc.\n\nBut let's focus on the head.\n\nFrom (5,6), move options for turn 27: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf I move R to (6,6), then as before, I can only move D to (6,5) on turn 28.\n\nThen from (6,5), only move L to (5,5) on turn 29.\n\nThen from (5,5), direction L or D? From (6,5) to (5,5) is L, so direction left.\n\nThen possible moves: U, D, L (R not allowed, reverse).\n\nU: (5,6) - but (5,6) is previous position, body, not tail.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5), snake positions: let's trace.\n\nAt turn 27: move R to (6,6), head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), tail (4,5)? Segments: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), and (4,5) tail? No, when moving to (6,6), no food, so tail (4,5) removed, new body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), tail (3,5)? List: 0:(6,6), 1:(5,6), 2:(4,6), 3:(3,6), 4:(2,6), 5:(2,5), 6:(3,5) tail.\n\nTail at (3,5).\n\nThen turn 28: move D to (6,5), new head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), tail (3,5) removed? No food, so tail removed, new body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), tail (2,5)? Segments: 0:(6,5), 1:(6,6), 2:(5,6), 3:(4,6), 4:(3,6), 5:(2,6), 6:(2,5) tail.\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nThen turn 29: from (6,5) dir D, move L to (5,5), new head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,5) removed, new body: (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,6).\n\nThen from (5,5), direction L (since moved left from (6,5)).\n\nPossible moves: U (5,6) body, not tail; D (5,4); L (4,5); R (6,5) body, not tail.\n\nU: (5,6) is body segment, not tail, collision.\n\nD: (5,4) - free? Not wall, not obstacle (obstacles (6,4) but (5,4) free), not occupied, so free.\n\nL: (4,5) - (4,5) may be occupied? Snake has (4,6), (3,6), etc., but (4,5) is not in current body; current body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,6), so (4,5) free.\n\n(4,5) was occupied earlier but not now.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) free.\n\nR: (6,5) is body, not tail, collision.\n\nAnd R is reverse? Direction is L, so moving R would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,5) dir L: D to (5,4) or L to (4,5).\n\nBoth possible.\n\nBut we are at turn 29, and we need to think about food.\n\nFood (1,5) available until turn 28, so on turn 29 it is gone if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) available.\n\n(3,1) available.\n\nIn this path, we are at (5,5) on turn 29, and (1,5) is at (1,5), which is far, and available only until turn 28, so on turn 29 it's gone, so we missed it.\n\nIf we go this way, we don't eat (1,5).\n\nFrom turn 27, if from (5,6) we move D to (5,5) instead.\n\nTurn 27: from (5,6) move D to (5,5), new head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), tail (4,5) removed, new body: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), tail (3,5).\n\nDirection down.\n\nThen possible moves: U, D, L, R but no reverse, so cannot move U (up).\n\nD: (5,4) free.\n\nL: (4,5) free? Not occupied, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nR: (6,5) free.\n\nSo all three possible except U not allowed.\n\nNow, (1,5) is at (1,5), which is on y=5, x=1.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move L to (4,5), then to (3,5), but (3,5) is body? Current body: after move to (5,5), body includes (3,5) at tail? Segments: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) tail.\n\n(3,5) is tail.\n\nIf I move L to (4,5), (4,5) is free, not occupied.\n\nThen to (3,5), but (3,5) is the current tail. If I move to (3,5), it is occupied by tail, but since tail moves, it might be ok, but there is a rule about tail reward danger.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nHere, (3,5) has no food, it's just the tail position.\n\nFood is at (1,5), not (3,5).\n\nSo moving to (3,5) should be fine, since it's the tail, and after move, tail moves away.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFrom (5,5), if I move L to (4,5), new head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), and tail (3,5) removed, new tail (2,5).\n\n(4,5) was free, so no food, no growth.\n\nThen from (4,5), direction L (left), possible moves: U, D, L, R but no reverse, so cannot move R (right).\n\nU: (4,6) body, not tail, collision.\n\nD: (4,4) - free? Not occupied, not wall, not obstacle ( (2,4) obstacle but not (4,4)), so free.\n\nL: (3,5) - (3,5) is not occupied now, free.\n\nR: (5,5) body, not tail, collision.\n\nSo possible D or L.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), but (3,5) was the previous tail position, but now free, so no problem.\n\nThen head to (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) tail.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move to (2,5), but (2,5) is tail, so possible.\n\nBut (2,5) has no food.\n\nThen to (1,5), which has food.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), available until turn 28.\n\nTurn 27: at (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: move to (4,5) or (5,4) or (6,5)\n\nTo reach (1,5), I need to go left.\n\nFrom (5,5) turn 27, move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 28, from (4,5) move L to (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is free, as above.\n\nThen turn 29, from (3,5) move L to (2,5)\n\n(2,5) is tail? Current at turn 28: after move to (3,5), head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,5)? Segments: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), and tail? Previous tail was (2,5), but when moving to (3,5), no food, so tail removed, new body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,6).\n\n(2,5) is removed, so free.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: U (3,6), D (3,4), L (2,5), R (4,5) body.\n\nDirection from (4,5) to (3,5) is L, so direction left.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L (R not allowed, reverse).\n\nU: (3,6) is body, not tail, collision.\n\nD: (3,4) - free? Not wall, not obstacle, not occupied.\n\nL: (2,5) - free, as we said.\n\nSo move L to (2,5) or D to (3,4).\n\nIf move L to (2,5), new head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail (2,6) removed, new body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail (3,6).\n\nThen turn 30, from (2,5) dir L, move L to (1,5), which has food.\n\n(1,5) has value 1, life span 4, available until turn 28? Turn 25 to 28, so turn 28 is last chance.\n\nTurn 25: available\n\nTurn 26: available\n\nTurn 27: available\n\nTurn 28: available\n\nAfter turn 28, it disappears.\n\nOn turn 30, it's gone.\n\nTurn 28 is the last turn to eat it.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 25: move to (4,6)\n\nTurn 26: move to (5,6)\n\nTurn 27: move to (4,5) or (5,5), etc.\n\nFrom (5,6) on turn 27, if I want to reach (1,5) by turn 28.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), head at (5,6) on turn 27.\n\nDistance: from (5,6) to (1,5) is |5-1| + |6-5| = 4+1=5 cells, but I can move diagonally? No, only orthogonal, one cell per turn.\n\nIn one turn, I can only move to adjacent cell.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (1,5) in one move? Not adjacent, so impossible to reach on turn 27.\n\nOn turn 27, head at (5,6), (1,5) is at distance min 4 steps, since |dx|=4, |dy|=1, so at least 4 moves, but I have only from turn 27 to turn 28.\n\nTurn 27: move to (5,5) or (6,6)\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move to (4,5) or (5,4) or (6,5)\n\n(4,5) is closer to (1,5).\n\nBut (4,5) to (1,5) is |dx=3|, |dy=0|, so 3 steps, but on turn 28, I can only be at (4,5) if I move there on turn 27.\n\nTurn 27: from (5,6) move to (5,5) or (6,6)\n\nIf to (5,5), then on turn 28, from (5,5) I can move to (4,5) or (5,4) or (6,5)\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), (1,5) is at (1,5), so from (4,5) to (1,5) is not adjacent, still 3 steps away horizontally.\n\nSo on turn 28, from (4,5), I can move to (3,5), then to (2,5) on turn 29, then to (1,5) on turn 30, but turn 30 is after turn 28, so (1,5) gone.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 28 I am at (4,5), I can't reach (1,5) in one move.\n\nThe closest I can be on turn 28 to (1,5) is (2,5) or (1,4) or (1,6), but (1,6) is above, (1,4) below, (2,5) left.\n\n(2,5) is adjacent to (1,5).\n\nCan I be at (2,5) on turn 28?\n\nOn turn 27, head at (5,6)\n\nTo reach (2,5) by turn 28, I need to move to a cell adjacent to (2,5) on turn 27, but (2,5) is currently occupied by snake body.\n\nAt turn 26, snake has (2,5) as body segment.\n\nAfter turn 26, head at (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nSo (2,5) is occupied.\n\nOn turn 27, when I move from (5,6), the snake moves, so (2,5) may be vacated if not eaten.\n\nIf I move to (5,5) or (6,6), the tail moves, so (2,5) is removed, and new positions.\n\nAfter move to (5,5) on turn 27, body: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)? When moving to (5,5), no food, so tail (4,5) removed, new body: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) tail? Segments: 0:(5,5), 1:(5,6), 2:(4,6), 3:(3,6), 4:(2,6), 5:(2,5), 6:(3,5) tail.\n\nSo (2,5) is occupied as index 5, not tail.\n\nOn turn 27, (2,5) is occupied, so I cannot move to it.\n\nSimilarly, adjacent cells to (1,5) are (1,4), (1,6), (2,5), (0,5) wall.\n\n(1,4), (1,6), (2,5).\n\n(1,4) and (1,6) may be free.\n\n(2,5) is occupied on turn 27.\n\nOn turn 28, after move, if I am at a position, (2,5) may be free or not.\n\nBut to eat (1,5) on turn 28, I need to move to (1,5) on turn 28.\n\nSo I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 27.\n\nAdjacent cells: (1,4), (1,6), (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is occupied on turn 27, so I cannot be there.\n\n(1,4) and (1,6) are free, but can I reach them on turn 27?\n\nFrom turn 26 head at (5,6), to (1,4) or (1,6) in one move? Impossible, too far.\n\nSo it is impossible to eat (1,5) because I am too far away and it disappears after turn 28.\n\nOn turn 25, head at (3,6), (1,5) is at distance |3-1| + |6-5| = 2+1=3, so at least 3 moves, but from turn 25 to turn 28, I have turns 25,26,27,28 to move.\n\nTurn 25: move to (4,6)\n\nTurn 26: move to (5,6) or other, but only (5,6) possible.\n\nTurn 27: from (5,6) move to (5,5) or (6,6)\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move to (4,5) on turn 28, but (4,5) is not adjacent to (1,5).\n\nFrom (5,6) on turn 27, if I could move left, but I can't directly.\n\nThe only way would be to go down earlier, but on turn 25 and 26, I had no choice; only one move possible.\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach (1,5) by turn 28, so I cannot eat it. It will disappear.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) was impossible to eat.\n\nSo focus on other food.\n\n(6,2) at (6,2), life span 7, available turns 25 to 31.\n\n(3,1) at (3,1), life span 10, available to 34.\n\nNow, snake head after turn 26 at (5,6).\n\nOn turn 27, I can move D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf I move R to (6,6), I go to the right edge, which might be dead end.\n\nIf I move D to (5,5), I can go down to (5,4), etc., towards (3,1) or (6,2).\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), (6,2) at (6,2).\n\nAlso, there is obstacle at (6,4) and (6,1), so (6,2) might be accessible.\n\nLet's plan to go for (3,1) or (6,2).\n\nFirst, from (5,6) turn 27, move D to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 28, from (5,5) dir D, move to (5,4) or (4,5) or (6,5).\n\n(5,4) is down, (4,5) left, (6,5) right.\n\n(3,1) is down-left, (6,2) down-right.\n\nIf I go to (5,4), then to (5,3), etc. to (5,1) but (5,1) is obstacle, so not.\n\nObstacle at (5,1), so cannot go to (5,1).\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move to (4,4) or (5,3) or (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle.\n\n(5,3) free.\n\nThen to (5,2), etc.\n\nTo reach (3,1), from (5,5) move L to (4,5), then D to (4,4), then L to (3,4), but (3,4) may be free, then D to (3,3), (3,2), (3,1).\n\nSimilarly for (6,2): from (5,5) move R to (6,5), then D to (6,4) obstacle, invalid. From (6,5) move D to (6,4) wall, or L to (5,5), or U to (6,6) body, or R invalid.\n\nFrom (6,5), only L to (5,5) possible, as before.\n\nSo to reach (6,2), I need to go from above or left, but (6,4) blocked, so from (6,3) or something.\n\nBut (6,3) is free, I think.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) move to (6,5) on turn 28, then from (6,5) move L to (5,5) or D to (6,4) invalid, so only L back, not progress.\n\nFrom (5,5) move D to (5,4), then to (5,3), then to (5,2), then to (6,2) or (4,2) or (5,1) obstacle.\n\n(5,1) obstacle, so from (5,2) move R to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) has food.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,2) move L to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut let's count turns.\n\nFirst, turn 27: from (5,6) move D to (5,5)  -- let's choose this for now.\n\nThen turn 28: from (5,5) dir D, move to (5,4) for example.\n\nNew head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), tail (3,5)? After move to (5,4), no food, so tail removed, new body: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), tail (2,5).\n\nDirection down.\n\nThen turn 29: from (5,4) dir D, possible moves: U not allowed (reverse), D (5,3), L (4,4), R (6,4) obstacle.\n\nR to (6,4) invalid.\n\nU not allowed.\n\nSo D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\n(5,3) free, (4,4) free.\n\nSay move D to (5,3).\n\nNew head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,5) removed, new body: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,6).\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 30: from (5,3) dir D, move D to (5,2) or L to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n\nU not allowed.\n\n(5,2) free, (4,3) free, (6,3) free.\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), so from (5,3) move R to (6,3) or D to (5,2).\n\nIf move R to (6,3), new head (6,3), body (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail (2,6) removed, new body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail (3,6).\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen turn 31: from (6,3) dir R, move D to (6,2) or U to (6,4) obstacle or L to (5,3) body or R invalid.\n\nU invalid, L body, R invalid, so only D to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) has food, so eat it, snake grows.\n\nLife span of (6,2) is 7, available until turn 31, so on turn 31 can eat.\n\nIf I move directly from (5,3) to (5,2) on turn 30, then to (6,2) on turn 31, also possible.\n\nBut from (5,2), I can move R to (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for (3,1), I can go later.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=25.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, etc., but at least 5 turns.\n\nSince on turn 25 and 26, only one choice, I must do those.\n\nTurn 25: move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 26: move R to (5,6)\n\nNow turn 27: I have a choice, move D to (5,5) or R to (6,6)\n\nIf I move R to (6,6), I go to a corner and might get stuck, as before.\n\nIf I move D to (5,5), I can head down to eat (6,2) or (3,1).\n\n(6,2) is closer in terms of turns; available until turn 31, and I can reach it by turn 31.\n\n(3,1) available longer.\n\nBut (6,2) might be riskier due to obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother food: (3,1) at (3,1), which is near the start.\n\nFrom current, after turn 26 at (5,6), move to (5,5), then to (4,5), then to (3,5), but (3,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nOn turn 27, from (5,6) move D to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 28, from (5,5) move L to (4,5)  -- (4,5) is free.\n\nNew head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), tail (3,5) removed, new body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), tail (2,5).\n\nDirection left.\n\nTurn 29: from (4,5) dir L, move D to (4,4) or L to (3,5) or U to (4,6) body collision.\n\nU: (4,6) is body, not tail, collision.\n\nR not allowed.\n\nSo D to (4,4) or L to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is free, as not occupied.\n\nIf move L to (3,5), new head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,5) removed, new body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,6).\n\nDirection left.\n\nTurn 30: from (3,5) dir L, move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5) or U to (3,6) body.\n\nU body, R not allowed.\n\nD to (3,4) or L to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is free? Not occupied.\n\nIf move L to (2,5), new head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail (2,6) removed, new body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail (3,6).\n\nThen turn 31: from (2,5) dir L, move L to (1,5) but (1,5) food gone, or D to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, or U to (2,6) body, or R not allowed.\n\nU: (2,6) is body, collision.\n\nD: (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nL: (1,5) - but food gone, and (1,5) free, but no food.\n\nR not allowed.\n\nSo only L to (1,5), but no food, and then stuck because from (1,5), possible moves: U (1,6), D (1,4), R (2,5) body, L wall.\n\nU and D possible, but not good position.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 30, instead of L to (2,5), move D to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) free, then to (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) to eat food.\n\n(3,1) available until turn 34, so time.\n\nBut let's go for (6,2) as it's closer from the south path.\n\nSo for turn 27, move D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28, move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 29, move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 30, move R to (6,3) or D to (5,2)\n\nTo eat (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nIf on turn 30 move R to (6,3), then turn 31 move D to (6,2)\n\nOr if on turn 30 move D to (5,2), then turn 31 move R to (6,2)\n\nBoth work.\n\nI think moving to (6,3) on turn 30 is fine.\n\nThen after eating (6,2), snake grows, length increases.\n\nBut for now, let's output the actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 25: only choice R\n\nTurn 26: only choice R\n\nTurn 27: I choose D (down) to (5,5) to go down.\n\nTurn 28: from (5,5) dir D, I can move D to (5,4) or L to (4,5) or R to (6,5)\n\nI choose D to (5,4) to continue down.\n\nTurn 29: from (5,4) dir D, move D to (5,3) or L to (4,4)\n\nI choose D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 30: from (5,3) dir D, move D to (5,2) or L to (4,3) or R to (6,3)\n\nI choose R to (6,3) to approach (6,2)\n\nThen turn 31: from (6,3) dir R, move D to (6,2) to eat food.\n\nBut the answer should be for turns from t1=25 onwards, at least 5 turns.\n\nSo for turn 25 to 29 or 30.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTurn 25: R\n\nTurn 26: R\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: D\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nThat's 5 turns, but I can add more for clarity.\n\nSince the food at (6,2) can be eaten on turn 31, but it's beyond 5 turns.\n\nBut the thinking is to maximize score, so planning to eat it.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 25.\n\nAlso, on turn 27, if I move R to (6,6), I might not be able to eat anything soon.\n\nSo better to go down.\n\nMoreover, after eating (6,2), I can go to (3,1) later.\n\nBut for now, the actions for the first few turns.\n\nSo I think:\n\nTurn 25: R\n\nTurn 26: R\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: D\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nBut on turn 29, at (5,3), I can move to (5,2) or (6,3), but in the sequence above, turn 29: from (5,4) move D to (5,3), so at (5,3).\n\nThen turn 30: from (5,3) move R to (6,3) for example.\n\nBut for 5 turns, up to turn 29 is fine, or include turn 30.\n\nThe problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format can be multiple turns.\n\nIn the example, it might be open.\n\nTo be safe, let's output 5 turns.\n\nBut turn 25 to 29.\n\nTurn 25: R\n\nTurn 26: R\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: D\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nOn turn 29, moving D to (5,3) from (5,4), but at (5,3), I can choose next move.\n\nBut for the actions, I need to specify each turn.\n\nPerhaps I can output more.\n\nSince on turn 27,28,29 I move down, but on turn 28 from (5,5) I could move left or right, but I chose down to go to (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, consistent.\n\nTo avoid the risk of going to the right edge, going down is better.\n\nAlso, for long-term, after (5,3), I can go to (6,3) then (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut (6,2) has life span 7, available until turn 31, so on turn 31 I can eat.\n\nTurn 30: move to (6,3)\n\nTurn 31: move to (6,2) eat.\n\nBut turn 31 is later.\n\nFor the answer, I'll output turns 25 to 29.\n\nBut let's confirm if on turn 29 moving D is possible.\n\nFrom turn 28: head at (5,4) dir D, move D to (5,3), valid.\n\nYes.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 25: R\n\nTurn 26: R\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: D\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nBut on turn 29, after moving to (5,3), the direction is down, and I can move to (5,2), (4,3), or (6,3) on next turn.\n\nBut for now, this should be fine.\n\nTo make it longer, but I think 5 turns are enough for the plan.\n\nThe core is to go down to reach the lower area for food.\n\nSo I think this is ok.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Movement\n\n**Current State (Turn 25):**\n- **Snake Head Position**: (3, 6)  \n- **Snake Direction**: Right (R)  \n- **Snake Body**: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4)] (length 7)  \n- **Food**:  \n  - (5,6): value +1, life span 1 (available only on turn 25;

head can only move to (4,6) this turn.  \n  - (1,5) cannot be eaten—too far (min 4 steps from turn 25) and disappears after turn 28; unreachable in time.  \n  - Focus on (6,2) and (3,1) for scoring, as they have longer life spans.  \n- **Survival Priority**: Avoid dead ends (e.g., right edge near obstacles) and plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score via (6,2) or (3,1).\n\n**Turn-by-Turn Reasoning (5+ Turns):**\n- **Turn 25 (Current Turn)**:  \n  - Head at (3,6), direction R.  \n  - Possible moves:  \n    - U (up) to (3,7): Wall (y=7), invalid.  \n    - D (down) to (3,5): Body segment (not tail), collision, invalid.  \n    - L (left) to (2,6): Body segment and reverse direction, invalid.  \n    - R (right) to (4,6): Free (no wall, obstacle, or body).  \n  - **Only valid move: R** to (4,6). (5,6) food ignored as unreachable.  \n\n- **Turn 26**:  \n  - Head at (4,6), direction R (after move).  \n  - Possible moves:  \n    - U to (4,7): Wall, invalid.  \n    - D to (4,5): Body segment (not tail), collision, invalid.  \n    - L to (3,6): Body segment and reverse direction, invalid.  \n    - R to (5,6): Free (no food, so no growth; (5,6) food disappears after turn 25).  \n  - **Only valid move: R** to (5,6).  \n\n- **Turn 27**:  \n  - Head at (5,6), direction R.  \n  - Possible moves:  \n    - U to (5,7): Wall, invalid.  \n    - D to (5,5): Free (no wall, obstacle, or body).  \n    - R to (6,6): Free (no wall, obstacle, or body).  \n    - L: Reverse direction, not allowed.  \n  - **Choice: D (down) to (5,5)**.  \n    - Why? Moving R to (6,6) leads to a dead end (only down to (6,5) next, then limited options). Moving D starts path toward (6,2) or (3,1) for scoring, with lower risk. Prioritize long-term access to food.  \n\n- **Turn 28**:  \n  - Head at (5,5), direction D (after move).  \n  - Possible moves:  \n    - U: Reverse direction, not allowed.  \n    - D to (5,4): Free.  \n    - L to (4,5): Free.  \n    - R to (6,5): Free.  \n  - **Choice: D (down) to (5,4)**.  \n    - Why? Continues downward path toward (6,2) or (3,1). Moving L or R may delay progress; D is efficient for reaching (6,2) by turn 31.  \n\n- **Turn 29**:  \n  - Head at (5,4), direction D.  \n  - Possible moves:  \n    - U: Reverse direction, not allowed.  \n    - D to (5,3): Free.  \n    - L to (4,4): Free.  \n    - R to (6,4): Obstacle (internal wall), invalid.  \n  - **Choice: D (down) to (5,3)**.  \n    - Why? Advances to y=3, setting up for (6,2) on turn 31. (6,2) is 2 steps away and available until turn 31. L to (4,4) is safe but slower for scoring.  \n\n**Longer-Term Plan (Turns 30-31):**  \n- **Turn 30**: From (5,3), direction D. Move R to (6,3) to approach (6,2).  \n- **Turn 31**: From (6,3), direction R. Move D to (6,2) to eat food (+1 score, snake grows).  \n- **Beyond**: After eating (6,2), head to (3,1) (available until turn 34) via safe path (e.g., via (5,2), (4,2), etc.), avoiding obstacles.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- No immediate risks (all moves avoid collisions and dead ends).  \n- Path to (6,2) is efficient and low-risk with obstacles avoided.  \n- Survival ensured by open space in lower grid; score maximized via (6,2) and (3,1).\n\n**Final Action Sequence (Turns 25-29):**  \nActions are chosen to ensure survival and position for food access within 5+ turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 26: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 27: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 28: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 29: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 26, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So I must avoid these cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,6), then body segments at (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is R, meaning it just moved right to (4,6) from (3,6), I assume, since the previous head was at (3,6) before moving right.\n\nHead direction R means it's facing right, so it came from left, from (3,6) to (4,6).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,5) with value 1 and life span 4. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so after this turn, it will have 3 turns left, then 2, then 1, then gone.\n\n- (6,2) with value 1 and life span 6. So it will last 6 more turns including this one.\n\n- (3,1) with value 1 and life span 9. All are positive food, value 1, so no negative food here.\n\nI need to move the snake to eat food without colliding with walls, obstacles, or itself.\n\nSince head direction is R, I can move U, D, or R, but not L because that would be instant reverse to the current direction. Current head is at (4,6), direction R, so possible moves:\n\n- U: up to (4,7) but y=7 is a wall, since border cells y=7 are walls. So moving up to (4,7) is invalid, wall collision.\n\n- D: down to (4,5). But (4,5) is occupied by the snake's body. Let's see snake positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]. So (4,5) is the sixth segment? Positions: index 0: head (4,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (2,6), 3: (2,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (4,4). So (4,5) is position 5, which is a body segment, not the tail.\n\nIf I move down to (4,5), that's a body collision because it's not the tail. The tail is at (4,4), which is the last segment.\n\nBut when the snake moves, the tail moves away, so moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is okay, but here (4,5) is not the tail; it's a body segment that won't move immediately away.\n\nGeneral rule: after moving, the head should not be on the same cell as any body segment except possibly the tail, but even then, if you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so collision happens.\n\nLet's clarify collision rules.\n\nFrom the core rules:\n\n- Body collision: head touches any body segment. But note that you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward (unless you eat food).\n\nSpecifically: if you move to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, and you don't eat food, then the tail moves, so it's safe. But if you eat food, the tail stays, so if you move to the tail cell and eat food, the head and tail are on the same cell, which is collision? No.\n\nWhen you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added. So if you move to a cell that was the tail, and you eat food there, then after moving, the head is on that cell, and the tail is still there? But the tail segment is replaced.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAssume the snake moves step by step:\n\n- Before move: head at H, body segments B1 to Bk, tail T.\n\n- After move: new head position based on direction, say H_new.\n\n- If H_new has food, then snake grows: new segments are H_new, then H, then B1 to Bk, and T remains? No.\n\nStandard snake: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away from its current position, unless food is eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nIf food eaten: head moves to food cell, food is consumed, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move; instead, the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo, for collision:\n\n- After moving, if the new head position is the same as any body segment position except the current tail position, it's a collision because those segments haven't moved yet.\n\n- But if the new head position is the same as the current tail position, and no food is eaten, then after moving, the tail moves away, so it's safe.\n\n- If food is eaten at the tail position, then new head is at tail position, and since food is eaten, tail doesn't move, so head and tail are on same cell? But in terms of positions, after growth, the tail is now the former second-last segment or something.\n\nI need to simulate.\n\nDefine positions before move: segments S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Sk (tail).\n\nAfter move without eating:\n\n- New head: S0_new\n\n- New segments: S0_new, S0, S1, S2, ..., Sk-1  (so Sk is removed, tail is now Sk-1)\n\nAfter move with eating at cell C:\n\n- New head: C (which is the food cell)\n\n- New segments: C, S0, S1, S2, ..., Sk  (so tail is still Sk, but now there's an extra segment)\n\nIn the eating case, the tail segment remains, and a new segment is added at the head, but the tail position doesn't change immediately.\n\nFor collision check: after the move, if the new head position is equal to any of the body segment positions before the move, except if it is the tail position and no food is eaten.\n\nFrom rules:\n\n- Body collision: head touches any body segment. But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\n\nSo, specifically:\n\n- If you move to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, collision.\n\n- If you move to the tail cell, and you do not eat food there, then it's safe because the tail moves away.\n\n- If you move to the tail cell and you eat food there, then since the tail doesn't move, the head and tail are on the same cell after growth, which is collision? But the rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nThe rule has a special case for when head is adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n\nIn general, moving to tail cell:\n\n- If no food, safe.\n\n- If food, and you eat it, then collision because after eating, head is at tail position, and tail doesn't move, so they occupy same cell? Or in the next move.\n\nLet's read the rule:\n\n\"**Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nThis is specific to when head is adjacent to tail, meaning the tail is next to head, and you move onto the tail cell which has food.\n\nIn that case, if you eat it, the snake grows, so the head moves to tail position, and the tail remains there, so now head and tail are on same cell, which is collision.\n\nBut if the tail is not adjacent, moving to tail cell with food might be okay? No, if you move to tail cell and eat food, then head moves to that cell, and since food is eaten, tail doesn't move, so head and tail are both on that cell after the move, which is always a collision, regardless of adjacency.\n\nThe rule emphasizes the adjacency because in that case it's more likely, but in general, moving to any body segment cell except tail without food is collision.\n\nLet me clarify from core rules:\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo:\n\n- Moving to a cell occupied by a non-tail body segment: collision.\n\n- Moving to the tail segment cell: if no food eaten, tail moves, so safe; if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so head and tail on same cell, collision.\n\nAdditionally, for food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\" But in this case, for tail, it's similar.\n\nIn this state, let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake positions: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)\n\nSo cells occupied: (4,6) head, (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) tail.\n\nFood at (1,5), (6,2), (3,1)\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow, head at (4,6), direction R, so possible moves:\n\n- R: right to (5,6)\n\n- L: left to (3,6) but (3,6) is occupied by body, and it's not the tail (tail is (4,4)), so moving to (3,6) would be collision with body.\n\n- U: up to (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- D: down to (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied by body, position index 5, which is not tail, so collision.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (5,6).\n\nIs that right? (5,6) is within bounds? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (5,6) is x=5, y=6, which should be free? Let's see if it's occupied or wall.\n\nSnake positions: no (5,6)\n\nWalls: borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (5,6) is not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (5,1) is wall, but (5,6) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (5,6).\n\nBut that seems too constrained. Let me double-check.\n\nHead at (4,6), direction R.\n\nMoves:\n\n- U: (4,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- D: (4,5) occupied by snake body at index 5, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n\n- L: (3,6) occupied by snake body at index 1, not tail, collision, invalid.\n\n- R: (5,6) not occupied, not wall, so valid.\n\nSo indeed, only R is possible for this turn.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nSo for turn 26, I must move R to (5,6).\n\nAfter moving, no food at (5,6), so snake moves without eating.\n\nNew snake positions: head moves to (5,6), then the body: since no growth, the tail moves away. Old segments: S0=(4,6), S1=(3,6), S2=(2,6), S3=(2,5), S4=(3,5), S5=(4,5), S6=(4,4)\n\nAfter move: new head (5,6), then S0 becomes (5,6), then old S0 becomes part of body, so segments: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) and tail is (4,5)? Let's list:\n\nNew head: (5,6)\n\nThen the first body segment is the old head (4,6)\n\nThen S1 (3,6)\n\nS2 (2,6)\n\nS3 (2,5)\n\nS4 (3,5)\n\nS5 (4,5)\n\nAnd S6 (4,4) is not included because tail moved away? Since no food, the tail cell is vacated, so the last segment S6 is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) — that's 7 segments, same as before. Tail is now (4,5).\n\nPreviously tail was (4,4), which is gone.\n\nNow head at (5,6), direction is now R, since it moved right.\n\nNow, for turn 27.\n\nPossible moves from (5,6):\n\n- U: (5,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- D: (5,5) — is this free? Let's see occupied cells: snake at (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So (5,5) not occupied. Walls: no internal at (5,5), borders not, so free.\n\n- L: (4,6) — occupied by body, not tail (tail is (4,5)? New tail is (4,5), so (4,6) is body segment, not tail, so moving to (4,6) would be collision.\n\n- R: (6,6) — within bounds, not occupied? Snake no, walls: internal obstacle (6,4), but (6,6) not listed, so free.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nNow, food: at (1,5), (6,2), (3,1). None at (5,5) or (6,6), so no eating yet.\n\nI need to think ahead to eat food.\n\nFood at (1,5) has life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including turn 26. Since we are at turn 26, after turn 26, life span decreases to 3, so available until turn 29? Let's see.\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor food at (1,5): life span 4 at turn 26. So on turn 26, it exists; after turn 26, life span becomes 3; after turn 27, becomes 2; after turn 28, becomes 1; after turn 29, becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 26,27,28,29, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) life span 6: exists until turn 31 (since 6 turns from 26: 26,27,28,29,30,31; after 31, gone).\n\n(3,1) life span 9: exists until turn 34.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,6) after turn 26 move.\n\nI need to get to food.\n\nFirst, food at (1,5): but (1,5) is currently occupied? Snake positions: after turn 26, positions are (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n\n(1,5) is not occupied, but there is an internal obstacle at (1,2), but (1,5) should be free? Walls: internal obstacles (1,2) is wall, but (1,5) not listed, so free.\n\nBut to reach (1,5), it might be tricky.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) and (3,1).\n\nAlso, obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is wall, which might block paths.\n\nNow, from (5,6), I can go D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf I go R to (6,6), then head to (6,6), direction R.\n\nThen from (6,6), possible moves: U (6,7) wall, invalid; D (6,5) — not wall? Borders x=7, but (6,5) x=6<7, y=5, not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, but (6,5) not listed, so should be free. But (6,4) is wall, so (6,5) is above it, should be ok. Then L (5,6) occupied, but (5,6) is now body segment after move, so collision if move left. R (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (6,6), moves: D to (6,5) or ... U invalid, L invalid (to (5,6) body), R invalid. So only D to (6,5).\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go down or left, but to reach food, (6,2) is below, but (6,4) is wall, so I can go to (6,5), then to (6,4)? But (6,4) is wall, so cannot go down from (6,5) to (6,4). From (6,5), possible moves: U (6,6) but just came from there, and it might be body now. After moving to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), etc. tail (4,5)\n\nThen from (6,6) move D to (6,5), no food.\n\nThen positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), and tail? Old tail (4,5) not included, new segments: head (6,5), then old head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) — so 7 segments, tail (2,5).\n\nNow from (6,5), moves: U (6,6) occupied, body; D (6,4) but (6,4) is wall, invalid; L (5,5) — (5,5) should be free? Not occupied, not wall. R (7,5) x=7 wall invalid. So only L to (5,5).\n\nThen to (5,5), and so on. This seems to be going away from food.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (5,5), then I can go down or left, etc.\n\nBut food at (6,2) is close, but (6,4) is wall, so I cannot go directly down from (6,5) to (6,4) or (6,3). From (6,5), I can only go left to (5,5), then from (5,5) I can go D to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (5,4) might be free? Walls: internal (6,4) but (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\nBut let's think about getting to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at x=6,y=2, but (6,4) wall, so y=4 blocked, so to reach (6,2), I need to go around, like left to x=5, then down to y=2, then right to (6,2), but (6,1) is wall, so (6,2) might be accessible from left or above, but since (6,4) wall, I can come from (5,2) to (6,2), but (5,1) is wall, so (5,2) might be free.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,5): y=5, x=1, walls at (1,2) but (1,5) should be free.\n\nSnake is currently around (5,6), so (1,5) is far.\n\nFood at (3,1) is also far.\n\nSince (1,5) has short life, only until turn 29, and it's turn 26 now, I have 4 turns to eat it, but after turn 26 move, it's turn 27, so turns 27,28,29 to eat.\n\nBut snake is at (5,6), (1,5) is at left, with obstacles.\n\nPath to (1,5): from current head after t26 at (5,6), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut from (5,6), if I go D to (5,5) instead of R.\n\nBack to turn 26: I must go R to (5,6), as only move.\n\nThen turn 27: from (5,6), I can go D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf I go R to (6,6), as above, I end up at (6,5) then (5,5), which is slow.\n\nIf I go D to (5,5) from (5,6).\n\nTurn 27: move D to (5,5).\n\nNo food at (5,5), so snake moves: new head (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), tail (4,5)? After t26, positions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n\nAfter move D to (5,5): new head (5,5), then old head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), and (4,5) is tail, not included, so new positions: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) — tail (3,5)\n\nHead at (5,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nNow possible moves from (5,5):\n\n- U: (5,6) occupied by body, not tail (tail is (3,5)), so collision, invalid.\n\n- D: (5,4) — not occupied? Snake no, walls: internal (6,4) but (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\n- L: (4,5) — not occupied? In new positions, (4,5) is not there; positions are (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5). So (4,5) not occupied. Walls: no, so free.\n\n- R: (6,5) — free, not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (5,4), L to (4,5), or R to (6,5).\n\nNow, food at (1,5) is at left, so moving L to (4,5) might be a step towards it.\n\n(4,5) is not food, so no eat.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,5), but (3,5) is currently the tail? In positions, (3,5) is tail, so moving to (3,5) might be possible.\n\nBut let's think.\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to (1,5).\n\nFrom (5,5), if I go L to (4,5), then from (4,5) I can go L to (3,5), but (3,5) is tail.\n\nIf I move to (3,5), which is tail, and no food there, then it should be safe, because tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, then to (2,5) or (2,6), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is occupied by body? Let's simulate.\n\nTurn 27: from (5,6) move D to (5,5), positions as above.\n\nTurn 28: from (5,5), move L to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is not food, so no eat. New positions: head to (4,5), then old head (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), and tail (3,5) not included? Old positions: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)\n\nAfter move to (4,5): new head (4,5), then old head (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) — and (3,5) is removed since no growth. So positions: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) — tail (2,5)\n\nHead at (4,5), direction L (moved left).\n\nNow, (3,5) is not occupied anymore; it was tail and moved away.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,6) occupied by body, not tail, collision.\n\n- D: (4,4) — not occupied? Previously tail was at (4,4) at start, but now not. Walls: no, so free.\n\n- L: (3,5) — not occupied, free.\n\n- R: (5,5) occupied, body, collision.\n\nSo moves: D to (4,4) or L to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is not food, but I can go there to get closer to (1,5).\n\nMove L to (3,5).\n\nTurn 29: head to (3,5), no food, so new positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) — tail (2,6)? Old tail (2,5) removed.\n\nPositions: after move, head (3,5), then old head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) — and (2,5) gone, tail (2,6)\n\nHead at (3,5), direction L.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to (2,5) or other.\n\n(2,5) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nMove to (2,5).\n\nTurn 30: head to (2,5), no food, positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — tail (3,6)\n\nBut food at (1,5) can be eaten on turn 29? Turn 29 is the last turn it exists, since after turn 29 it disappears.\n\nLife span: at turn 26, life span 4, so after turn 26, span 3; after turn 27, span 2; after turn 28, span 1; after turn 29, span 0 gone. So it can be eaten on turn 29.\n\nBut on turn 29, snake head is at (3,5), and (1,5) is at (1,5), which is two steps away: from (3,5) to (2,5) to (1,5), but on turn 29, head is at (3,5), so I can move to (2,5) on turn 29, but (1,5) is still not reached.\n\nTurn 29: head at (3,5), I move to (2,5), but (1,5) is not eaten on turn 29; it will be gone after turn 29.\n\nSo to eat on turn 29, head must be at (1,5) on turn 29.\n\nBut on turn 29, head is at (3,5), so I need to be at (1,5) earlier or on turn 29.\n\nLet's timeline:\n\nTurn 26: head at (5,6) after move\n\nTurn 27: from (5,6), I moved D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: from (5,5), moved L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 29: from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4)\n\nIf I move L to (3,5) on turn 29, head at (3,5), not (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is at x=1,y=5, from (3,5) it's two moves left, but turn 29 is the last chance; I can only move one step per turn.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 29, I can only reach (3,5) or (4,4), not (1,5).\n\nSo with this path, I cannot reach (1,5) by turn 29.\n\nFrom turn 26 position (5,6), if I want to reach (1,5) by turn 29.\n\nTurn 27: from (5,6) to (4,6) but (4,6) is occupied, cannot move there directly.\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves are D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\n(4,6) is occupied, so I cannot move left to (4,6) because it's body.\n\nThe only way to go left is to go down or right first, but it's slow.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (5,5) then to (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied on turn 27.\n\nAfter turn 26 move, positions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n\nSo (4,5) is occupied, so from (5,6) to (5,5) is possible, but (4,5) is occupied, so I cannot go directly to (4,5) from (5,5) because on turn 28, from (5,5), I can move to (4,5) if it's free, but at that time, after move to (5,5), positions are (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) so (4,5) is not occupied, it was vacated when tail moved.\n\nOn turn 27, after moving to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) — so (4,5) is free.\n\nThen on turn 28, from (5,5) I can move L to (4,5), which is free.\n\nThen on turn 29, from (4,5) I can move L to (3,5), which is free as above.\n\nBut (1,5) is still at distance, and turn 29 is the last turn, head at (3,5) or (4,5), not at (1,5).\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 29, I can move to (2,5), but (1,5) is not reached.\n\nSo it's impossible to reach (1,5) by turn 29 from current position, because the snake is at (5,6) on turn 26, and (1,5) is 4 units away in Manhattan distance, but with obstacles and body, it takes at least 4 moves: e.g., (5,6) to (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (1,5), that's 4 moves, but from (5,6) on turn 26, after move, turn 27 to (5,5), turn 28 to (4,5), turn 29 to (3,5), turn 30 to (2,5), turn 31 to (1,5), but (1,5) disappears after turn 29, so on turn 30 it's gone, so I can only reach it by turn 29, but on turn 29 I can be at (3,5) at best, not (1,5).\n\nMin Manhattan distance from (5,6) to (1,5) is |5-1| + |6-5| = 4+1=5, so at least 5 moves, but turns: turn 26 at (5,6), turn 27 to somewhere, turn 28, turn 29 to at best (2,5) or (1,6), but (1,6) might be wall or occupied.\n\n(1,6): x=1,y=6, not border, not internal wall except (1,2), so free, but from (5,6) to (1,6) is 4 left, but I can't move left directly because of body.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can only move to (5,5) or (6,6), both not left.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (4,5) or (5,4), etc., but to (1,5) it's too far for turn 29.\n\nSo it's impossible to eat (1,5) because it expires before I can reach it. Life span too short.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2), life span 6, until turn 31, so I have more time.\n\n(3,1) until turn 34.\n\nSo perhaps I should go for (6,2) or (3,1).\n\nFirst, after turn 26, head at (5,6).\n\nFor turn 27, I can go D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nIf I go R to (6,6), then as before, to (6,5) on turn 28, then to (5,5) on turn 29, etc., but (6,2) is below.\n\nFrom (6,6) to (6,5) on turn 28, then from (6,5) to (5,5) on turn 29, then to (5,4) or (4,5), but (6,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nBut from (6,5), I cannot go down because (6,4) is wall, so I have to go left to (5,5), then down to (5,4), (5,3), etc.\n\nThen to (6,2) from (5,2) or (6,3), but (6,3) might be accessible if I can go to it.\n\n(6,3): not wall, since only (6,4) wall, so (6,3) free.\n\nBut from (6,5), I can only go to (5,5), not directly down.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go D to (5,4), then to (5,3), then to (5,2) or (6,2), etc.\n\nBut (6,2) can be reached from (6,3) or (5,2).\n\nBut (6,1) is wall, so (6,2) can be accessed from above or left.\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,1).\n\nNow, let's consider the grid with walls.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, borders are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls.\n\nFor example, (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but with internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(6,1): x=6,y=1, but y=1 is not border, border is y=0, so (6,1) is internal wall.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1), (2,4), etc.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, except the obstacle cells.\n\nObstacle cells: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo for example, (6,2) is not obstacle, so free.\n\nNow, back to snake.\n\nAfter turn 26, head at (5,6).\n\nTurn 27: options.\n\nIf I go R to (6,6), then turn 28 only D to (6,5), then turn 29 only L to (5,5).\n\nThen at (5,5), I can go D to (5,4), L to (4,5), or R to (6,5) but (6,5) might be occupied later.\n\nFrom (5,5), on turn 30, say move D to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\nThen head to (5,4), no food, positions update.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (5,5) occupied, body; D to (5,3); L to (4,4); R to (6,4) but (6,4) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo moves: D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), so from here, I can go down to (5,3), then to (5,2) or (6,2) if possible.\n\n(5,2) : not wall? Internal obstacle (5,1) but (5,2) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) free.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) to (6,2), but from (5,2) to (6,2) is right, possible.\n\nOr from (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,2), but (6,3) free.\n\nBut (6,2) life span until turn 31, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,1) has more time.\n\nBut let's see if I can get both.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, after turn 26, go D to (5,5) on turn 27.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go to (4,5) on turn 28, then to (3,5) on turn 29, then to (2,5) on turn 30, then to (1,5) but (1,5) is gone, or to (2,4) but (2,4) is wall, so cannot.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go to (2,6) or (1,5) or (2,4) but (2,4) wall, or (3,5) occupied.\n\nPositions on turn 30: after turn 29 at (3,5), move to (2,5) on turn 30, head at (2,5), then I can go to (1,5) if available, but (1,5) gone, or to (2,6) or (2,4) wall, or (1,5) gone, so only to (2,6) or (3,5) but (3,5) body.\n\nAfter move to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), etc., so (2,6) might be free or occupied.\n\nLet's not digress.\n\nSince (1,5) is unreachable in time, I should ignore it and focus on other food.\n\nFor turn 27, from (5,6), I can choose to go D to (5,5) or R to (6,6).\n\nGoing R to (6,6) leads to the right side, closer to (6,2).\n\nGoing D to (5,5) leads down, closer to (3,1) or (6,2) later.\n\n(3,1) is at bottom left, (6,2) at bottom right.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,1), which is closer to left.\n\nBut snake is on right, so (6,2) might be easier.\n\nLet's list the positions again.\n\nAfter turn 26: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail? Tail is (4,5)\n\nFor turn 27, if I go D to (5,5), then head to (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) tail (3,5)\n\nThen turn 28, from (5,5), I can go D to (5,4), L to (4,5), or R to (6,5).\n\nIf I go L to (4,5), as before, towards left.\n\nBut for (6,2), going R might be better.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (6,5) from (5,5), but (6,5) is free.\n\nTurn 27: go D to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 28: from (5,5), go R to (6,5)\n\n(6,5) not food, so move: head to (6,5), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) — tail (2,5)? Old positions before move: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,5): new head (6,5), then old head (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) — and (3,5) removed, so positions: (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) tail (2,5)\n\nHead at (6,5), direction R.\n\nMoves: U (6,6) — not occupied? Positions no (6,6), not wall, so free? But earlier from (6,6) we had to move down, but (6,6) is free now.\n\nU (6,6), D (6,4) wall, L (5,5) occupied, R (7,5) wall invalid. So only U to (6,6).\n\nSo must move U to (6,6).\n\nThen turn 29: head to (6,6), no food, positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) tail (2,6)\n\nThen from (6,6), moves: U (6,7) wall, D (6,5) occupied, L (5,6) occupied, R (7,6) wall, all invalid except D and L occupied, U and R wall, so no move? That's a problem.\n\nPositions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n\nSo (6,5) occupied, (5,6) occupied.\n\nMoves:\n- U (6,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n- D (6,5) occupied by body, collision\n- L (5,6) occupied by body, collision\n- R (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid\n\nNo valid moves! Snake dies.\n\nBut that can't be right for planning.\n\nIn this sequence, after moving to (6,5) on turn 28, then to (6,6) on turn 29, but at (6,6), it's surrounded.\n\nBut at turn 28, when at (6,5), I could only move to (6,6) because other moves invalid.\n\nThen at (6,6), no escape.\n\nSo this path is deadly; I must avoid going to (6,5) when the body is behind.\n\nTherefore, from turn 27, going D to (5,5) and then R to (6,5) leads to death.\n\nInstead, from (5,6) on turn 27, I should not go R to (6,6) either, because from (6,6) I had to go to (6,5), then to (5,5), but in the first sequence, when I went directly R on turn 27.\n\nTurn 27: from (5,6) go R to (6,6)\n\nThen positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) tail (3,5)? After move, new head (6,6), old head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) — but (3,5) is included, tail (3,5)\n\nHead at (6,6), direction R.\n\nMoves: U (6,7) wall, D (6,5) free? Not occupied, not wall ( (6,4) wall but (6,5) free), L (5,6) occupied, R (7,6) wall. So only D to (6,5).\n\nTurn 28: move D to (6,5), no food, positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) — tail (2,5) since (3,5) removed.\n\nHead at (6,5), moves: U (6,6) occupied, D (6,4) wall, L (5,5) free, R (7,5) wall. So only L to (5,5).\n\nTurn 29: move L to (5,5), no food, positions: head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) tail (2,6)\n\nHead at (5,5), direction L.\n\nMoves: U (5,6) occupied, D (5,4) free, L (4,5) free, R (6,5) occupied.\n\nSo possible: D to (5,4) or L to (4,5).\n\nNo immediate death, but snake is coiled.\n\nNow to reach food, (6,2) is below.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go D to (5,4) on turn 30.\n\n(5,4) free, move to (5,4), positions update.\n\nThen from (5,4), moves: U (5,5) occupied, D (5,3), L (4,4), R (6,4) wall invalid. So D or L.\n\nGo D to (5,3) on turn 31.\n\nThen to (5,2) on turn 32, then to (6,2) on turn 33 if available.\n\n(6,2) life span 6, at turn 26, so available until turn 31 (turns 26 to 31 inclusive), so on turn 32 it disappears, so I can eat on turn 31 if head at (6,2).\n\nBut on turn 31, if I am at (5,3), I can move to (5,2) or (6,3), not to (6,2) directly.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 31, move to (5,2) or (6,3), then on turn 32 to (6,2), but (6,2) gone after turn 31, so I miss it.\n\nIf from (5,4) on turn 31, but let's timeline.\n\nTurn 26: head to (5,6)\n\nTurn 27: to (6,6)\n\nTurn 28: to (6,5)\n\nTurn 29: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 30: from (5,5) go D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 31: from (5,4) go D to (5,3) or R to (6,4) wall, so D to (5,3) or L to (4,4)\n\nSay go D to (5,3)\n\nThen on turn 31, head at (5,3), (6,2) is at (6,2), which is adjacent, but not the same cell.\n\n(6,2) can be eaten on turn 31 if head moves there.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move R to (6,3) or D to (5,2) or L to (4,3) or U to (5,4).\n\n(6,3) is free, then from (6,3) I can move to (6,2) on turn 32, but (6,2) disappears after turn 31, so on turn 32 it's gone.\n\nTurn 31 is the last turn for (6,2), since life span 6 from turn 26: exists on turns 26,27,28,29,30,31; after turn 31, gone.\n\nSo on turn 31, head must be at (6,2) to eat it.\n\nFrom turn 30 position, head at (5,4), on turn 31 I can move to (5,3), (4,4), or (5,5) occupied, so not to (6,2).\n\nFrom (5,4) to (6,2) is not adjacent; I need two moves.\n\nSo impossible to eat (6,2) with this path.\n\nIf from turn 27, I go D to (5,5) instead of R.\n\nTurn 27: from (5,6) go D to (5,5)\n\nPositions: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) tail (3,5)\n\nTurn 28: from (5,5), go D to (5,4) or L to (4,5) or R to (6,5)\n\nIf I go D to (5,4) to go down.\n\nMove to (5,4), no food, positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) tail (2,5)\n\nHead at (5,4), direction D.\n\nMoves: U (5,5) occupied, D (5,3), L (4,4), R (6,4) wall invalid. So D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\nGo D to (5,3) on turn 29.\n\nThen to (5,2) on turn 30, then to (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nOn turn 31, move to (6,2), and if food is there, eat it.\n\n(6,2) exists on turn 31, so yes.\n\nFrom turn 30 at (5,2), move to (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nBut on turn 30, head at (5,2), then move to (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nNow, is (5,2) free? Let's see the path.\n\nTurn 28: from (5,5) go D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 29: from (5,4) go D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 30: from (5,3) go D to (5,2) or R to (6,3) or etc.\n\n(5,2) is free, not wall.\n\nMove to (5,2) on turn 30.\n\nThen turn 31: from (5,2) move R to (6,2), eat food, snake grows.\n\nPositions before move turn 31: head at (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) tail (2,5)? After turn 30 move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), then old head (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), and (2,5) removed? Let's count.\n\nBefore turn 30 move, positions: head at (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) tail (2,6) I think.\n\nAfter turn 29: head at (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) tail (2,6)\n\nTurn 30: move to (5,2), no food, so new head (5,2), then old head (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), and (2,6) removed, so positions: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) tail (3,6)\n\nHead at (5,2), direction D or what? Moved down to (5,2), so direction D.\n\nTurn 31: move R to (6,2), which has food, so eat it.\n\nNew head (6,2), then since food eaten, snake grows: new segments (6,2), then old head (5,2), then (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) and the tail (3,6) remains, so now 8 segments.\n\nHead at (6,2), direction R.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nFrom turn 27, I went D to (5,5), then D to (5,4), D to (5,3), D to (5,2), then R to (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nBut on turn 28, from (5,5), I have options, but I chose D directly.\n\nAlso, on turn 26, I must go R to (5,6), no choice.\n\nThen turn 27 go D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28 go D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 29 go D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 30 go D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 31 go R to (6,2)\n\nBut turn 30 go to (5,2), which is y=2, and (5,1) is wall, but (5,2) is ok.\n\nThen to (6,2) on turn 31.\n\n(6,2) is available on turn 31, yes.\n\nAfter eating, I can go for other food.\n\nBut I need to output the moves for turn 26 and ahead, but the answer format is for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so for turn 26, then 27, etc.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, for the food at (3,1), I can go there later.\n\nBut let's confirm if all moves are valid.\n\nFirst, turn 26: must move R to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 27: from (5,6), move D to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 28: from (5,5), move D to (5,4)\n\nNow, on turn 28, from (5,5) to (5,4), is (5,4) free? At that time, positions before move: head at (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)\n\nSo (5,4) not occupied, not wall, yes.\n\nMove to (5,4), new positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) tail (2,5)\n\nThen turn 29: from (5,4) move D to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) free, move to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) tail (2,6)\n\nThen turn 30: from (5,3) move D to (5,2)\n\n(5,2) free, move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), then (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) tail (3,6)\n\nThen turn 31: from (5,2) move R to (6,2)\n\n(6,2) has food, eat, grow. New head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) and tail remains (3,6), so positions: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — 8 segments.\n\nAll good.\n\nI could go for (3,1) instead, but (6,2) is closer in this case.\n\n(3,1) has longer life.\n\nBut with this, I eat (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nThen I can go to (3,1) later.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 26, so I need turns 26 to, say, 31.\n\nTurn 26: R\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: D\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nTurn 31: R\n\nBut on turn 30, head at (5,2), and I move R to (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 30 is at (5,2), moving D to (5,2) on turn 30? No, on turn 30 I move to (5,2), from (5,3).\n\nActions: turn 26: R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 27: D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 29: D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 30: D to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 31: R to (6,2)\n\nBut for the answer, I think I need to specify up to turn 31 or so.\n\nSince the AI needs to think 5+ turns ahead, for turn 26, plan to turn 31.\n\nBut in the plan, I have actions for each turn.\n\nPerhaps I should include turn 26 to 31.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat (3,1) as well, but not necessary for now.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 28 or 29, I might have choices, but in this path, I go straight down.\n\nFrom turn 28 at (5,4), I could go L to (4,4) instead of D, but that might not help for (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, going directly to (6,2) is fine.\n\nAlso, about the tail reward danger: no issue here.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nCurrent turn t1=26.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 26: R\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: D\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nThen turn 31: R to eat (6,2)\n\nBut I need to output for turns 26,27,28,29,30, and perhaps 31.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can list multiple.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", for turn 26, I should plan actions for 26 to 31, which is 6 turns.\n\nPerhaps.\n\nTo be safe, I'll list up to turn 31.\n\nBut turn 31 is the action to eat food.\n\nIn the sequence, all moves are valid.\n\nAnother food at (3,1), but I can go there after.\n\nBut for the answer, I think this is fine.\n\nPerhaps on turn 27, I could go to (5,5) and then to (4,5) to go left, but (6,2) is more urgent with shorter life? (6,2) life 6, (3,1) life 9, so (6,2) expires sooner.\n\n(6,2) until turn 31, (3,1) until turn 34.\n\nAnd (3,1) is farther.\n\nSo going for (6,2) is better.\n\nIn the initial position, after turn 26 at (5,6), going down is towards (6,2) and away from obstacles.\n\nSo I think the plan is good.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 26):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 (playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, excluding walls). Walls include borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n- **Snake**: Head at (4,6), direction R. Positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)] (length 7). After Turn 26 move to (5,6), the snake will be at [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] with tail at (4,5).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,5): Value +1, life span 4 (disappears after Turn 29; can be eaten on Turns 26-29).\n  - (6,2): Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after Turn 31; can be eaten on Turns 26-31).\n  - (3,1): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after Turn 34; can be eaten on Turns 26-34).\n- **Constraints**: \n  - Turn 26 only valid move is R to (5,6) (U/D blocked by wall/body, L blocked by body).\n  - Must avoid instant reverse (e.g., after R move, cannot move L next).\n\n**Key Observations for Planning (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (1,5) expires soon (Turn 29) but is unreachable by Turn 29 due to distance (Manhattan distance 5 from (5,6) after Turn 26) and body/wall obstacles. Path requires at least 5 moves: e.g., (5,6) → (5,5) → (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,5), but (1,5) gone after Turn 29. Thus, skip (1,5).\n  - (6,2) expires on Turn 31 and is reachable by Turn 31 with a direct path. Focus on eating this to maximize score and avoid loss.\n  - (3,1) has longer life (until Turn 34) and can be targeted after (6,2).\n- **Path to (6,2)**: From Turn 26 head (5,6), move down repeatedly to reach (5,2) by Turn 30, then right to (6,2) on Turn 31. This path avoids walls/body and keeps the snake safe:\n  - Turn 26: R to (5,6) (only move).\n  - Turn 27: D to (5,5) (avoids dead ends; R to (6,6) leads to trapped position).\n  - Turn 28: D to (5,4) (continues descent; L/R possible but delay (6,2)).\n  - Turn 29: D to (5,3) (positions for (5,2)).\n  - Turn 30: D to (5,2) (adjacent to (6,2)).\n  - Turn 31: R to (6,2) (eat food, grow to length 8).\n- **Risks Avoided**:\n  - Body/Wall Collisions: All moves in the path are to free cells, with no body segments or walls.\n  - Tail Reward Danger: Not applicable, as no food is under the tail.\n  - Life Span: (6,2) eaten on Turn 31 before expiration.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating (6,2), the snake can target (3,1) (e.g., via (6,2) → (6,3) → (5,3) → ... → (3,1)), but planning stops at Turn 31 for this response.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 26-31):**\n- Turn 26: Only valid move is R. Sets up for descent.\n- Turns 27-30: Down moves to (5,2), aligning for (6,2) on Turn 31.\n- Turn 31: Right to (6,2) to eat food and grow.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 27: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 28: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 29: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 30: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 31: R (right)\n}",

        "step": 27,
        "score": 6,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 27. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,6), then body segments at (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving right to get to (5,6) from (4,6).\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,5) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,2) with life span 5 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,1) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. Rows y=0 to y=7, columns x=0 to x=7.\n\nWalls: borders, so can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake: head (5,6), body: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So let's plot this:\n\n- Row y=6: cells (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) are snake body except (5,6) is head.\n\n(5,6) head, (4,6) next, (3,6) next, (2,6) next, then (2,5) which is below (2,6), then (3,5) to the right, then (4,5) to the right. So the snake is like: from (5,6) right to (4,6)? No.\n\nPositions are given head first: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n\nSo at turn 27, head is at (5,6), moving right. From (4,6) to (5,6), so direction is right.\n\nBody: (4,6) is the segment behind head, then (3,6), (2,6), then down to (2,5), then right to (3,5), then right to (4,5).\n\nSo the tail is at (4,5), and it's moving... since head moved right to (5,6), the tail will move when we make the next move.\n\nNow, food: (1,5) with life span 3, so it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 27, life span 3 means it will be gone after turn 29? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, then:\n\n- At turn t: life span N, will decrease to N-1 at start of next turn.\n\n- After turn t, life span becomes N-1.\n\nIt disappears after N turns, meaning after N turns have passed, it's gone. So if at turn t, life span N, it exists on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N.\n\nFor example, turn 27, food at (1,5) life span 3: exists on turns 27, 28, 29, gone at turn 30.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) life span 5: exists turns 27,28,29,30,31, gone at 32.\n\n(3,1) life span 8: exists turns 27 to 34, gone at 35.\n\nAll values are +1, so all good to eat.\n\nNow, head at (5,6), direction right. Possible moves: since direction is right, I can move right, up, or down, but not left because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse rule. Current direction is R, so cannot move left immediately.\n\nPossible moves from (5,6):\n\n- Right: to (6,6)\n\n- Up: to (5,7)\n\n- Down: to (5,5)\n\nBut y=7 is a wall, since border y=7 is wall, so (5,7) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nx=7 is wall, so (7,y) invalid.\n\n(6,6): x=6, y=6. x=6 is not x=7, so not border wall. But is there an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (6,6) is not listed, so it should be free, but let's see if snake body is there.\n\nSnake positions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So (6,6) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5): is it occupied? Snake has (4,5), but (5,5) is not listed, so free? Positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), etc., down to (4,5). (5,5) is not in the list, so should be free.\n\nBut let's list all occupied cells: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So (5,5) is free, (6,6) free.\n\nBut (5,7) is wall, since y=7 border.\n\nAlso, down to (5,5) is possible.\n\nNow, food locations: (1,5), (6,2), (3,1)\n\n(1,5) is at row y=5, x=1. Snake has a segment at (2,5), which is adjacent.\n\n(6,2) at x=6,y=2\n\n(3,1) at x=3,y=1\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, possible moves from current position (5,6):\n\n- Right to (6,6): is this safe? (6,6) is not wall, not occupied by body. After moving, the tail will move, but let's see the snake after move.\n\nIf I move right to (6,6), new head position (6,6). Then the body: the head moves, so new positions: head (6,6), then previous head (5,6) becomes body, then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), and tail (4,5) will be removed? When snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail is removed, and new head added.\n\nIn this case, moving to (6,6), which has no food, so snake grows to positions: head at (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), and since no food, tail (4,5) is removed, so the body is now (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5). Length remains 7.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nNow, (6,6) is at x=6, y=6. x=6 is one before wall x=7, so from there, I can go right to (7,6) but x=7 is wall, invalid. Or up to (6,7) but y=7 wall. Or down to (6,5), or left to (5,6). But (5,6) will be body, so if I go left, I hit body.\n\nAfter moving to (6,6), the cell (5,6) is now the first body segment, so moving left from (6,6) to (5,6) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, up to (6,7) wall, right to (7,6) wall, so only possible move from (6,6) is down to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) should be free, no obstacle or snake currently.\n\nSnake has (4,5), (3,5), etc., but not (6,5).\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) is not listed, so should be free.\n\ny=5, x=6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), which is y=4, x=6, so (6,5) is different.\n\nSo from (6,6), only down to (6,5) is possible, since other directions are wall or body.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go left to (5,5), down to (6,4) but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid. Or up to (6,6), but that would be body if I just came from there.\n\nLet's not get ahead.\n\nBack to current move.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (6,6)\n\nThen, as above, only down to (6,5) is possible next, but let's see the state after that.\n\nOption 2: Move down to (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is free? Currently, snake positions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So (5,5) is not occupied, and no wall, so yes.\n\nAfter moving down to (5,5), new head at (5,5), body: (5,6) becomes body, then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), and tail (4,5) removed if no food. (5,5) has no food, so tail removed, body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves: up to (5,6) but that is now body, collision; left to (4,5); down to (5,4); right to (6,5).\n\n(4,5) is currently a body segment, but after move, when we move to (5,5), the segment at (4,5) was the tail, and it is removed, so (4,5) is free now? Let's see the new positions.\n\nAfter moving down to (5,5) from (5,6):\n\n- Head was (5,6), moved to (5,5)\n\n- New positions: head (5,5), then the previous head (5,6) is now first body segment.\n\nThen the rest: (4,6) becomes second body, (3,6) third, (2,6) fourth, (2,5) fifth, (3,5) sixth, and since no food eaten, the tail (4,5) is removed. So the body segments are: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)\n\nNow, (4,5) is no longer part of snake, so it's free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is now the last body segment.\n\nFrom head at (5,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (5,6): but (5,6) is now the first body segment, so collision if I move there.\n\n- Left to (4,5): (4,5) is free, as we just removed it.\n\n- Down to (5,4): should be free, no wall or obstacle.\n\n- Right to (6,5): should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (5,4) and (6,5) not listed, so free.\n\nOption 3: Move up, but (5,7) is y=7 wall, so invalid. Only right or down possible from (5,6).\n\nSo only two choices: right to (6,6) or down to (5,5).\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood at (1,5), life span 3, so must eat by turn 29 or it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) life span 5, by turn 31.\n\n(3,1) life span 8, plenty of time.\n\nAlso, need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving right to (6,6).\n\nIf I move right to (6,6), then as before, from (6,6), I can only move down to (6,5), because other directions blocked.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move left to (5,5), down to (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle, invalid, or up to (6,6) body, so only left to (5,5).\n\n(6,5) to (5,5) is left.\n\nThen from (5,5), as above, I can go to (4,5), (5,4), or (6,5) but (6,5) is where I came from, but it might be body.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), let's trace.\n\nTurn 27: move right to (6,6)\n\nNew positions: head (6,6), body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)  // tail (4,5) removed\n\nNow, at turn 28, from (6,6), only possible move down to (6,5)\n\nMove to (6,5): (6,5) has no food? Food is at (6,2), different.\n\nSo no food eaten, so new head (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)  // tail (3,5) removed\n\nNow, (3,5) removed, so free.\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves: left to (5,5), down to (6,4) invalid (obstacle), up to (6,6) body, right to (7,5) x=7 wall invalid. So only left to (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is free? In current state, not occupied.\n\nMove to (5,5): turn 29, head to (5,5), no food, so body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)  // tail (2,5) removed\n\nNow, from (5,5), possible moves: up to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, collision; left to (4,5); down to (5,4); right to (6,5) body, since (6,5) is now first body segment.\n\n(6,5) is directly behind, so moving right to (6,5) would collide.\n\nSo only left to (4,5) or down to (5,4)\n\n(4,5) might be free, but let's see.\n\nIn positions, (4,5) was removed earlier, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) free.\n\nBut we have food to consider.\n\nAt this point, food at (1,5) is gone after turn 29? Turn 27,28,29 exists, gone at turn 30.\n\nWe are at turn 29, head at (5,5), and (1,5) is at distance. From (5,5) to (1,5) is 4 left, but we have only one move, turn 29, to eat it, but (1,5) is at x=1,y=5, current (5,5), so not adjacent, can't eat this turn. After move on turn 29, if we go towards it, but food disappears after turn 29, meaning at turn 30 it's gone, so we can't eat it after all. Since we eat when head moves onto it during turn.\n\nTo eat at turn t, we move head to food cell at turn t.\n\nFor (1,5), life span 3 at turn 27, so it can be eaten on turn 27,28, or 29. After turn 29, gone.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn this path, we didn't eat it, and at turn 29 we are at (5,5), which is far from (1,5), so we miss that food.\n\nAlso, from (5,5), we can go left to (4,5) or down to (5,4).\n\nIf we go left to (4,5), then head to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut we have other food.\n\nNow, the other food (6,2) at (6,2), life span 5, exists until turn 31.\n\nFrom (5,5), we can go down to (5,4), then to (5,3), etc., towards (6,2) or (3,1).\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), which is near the obstacle (6,4) and (6,1).\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, (6,1) obstacle.\n\nAlso, (6,2) is at y=2,x=6.\n\nFrom (5,5), if I go down to (5,4), then to (5,3), then to (5,2), then right to (6,2), but (6,2) is food, and life span ok.\n\nBut let's see if possible.\n\nFirst, this path to (6,6) seems to be leading to a corner.\n\nAfter (6,6) -> (6,5) -> (5,5), then from (5,5), if I go down to (5,4), then head (5,4), body behind.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), left to (4,4), right to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, so down or left.\n\n(5,3) is free, etc.\n\nThen to (5,2), then to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut (6,2) might be available.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is also there.\n\nBut let's see the other initial choice.\n\nInstead of right, move down to (5,5) at turn 27.\n\nTurn 27: move down to (5,5)\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)  // tail (4,5) removed\n\nNow, from (5,5), as before, possible moves: left to (4,5), down to (5,4), right to (6,5)\n\nAll should be free now.\n\n(4,5) was removed, free; (5,4) free; (6,5) free.\n\nFood at (1,5) can be eaten if I go left, but (1,5) is at (1,5), current (5,5), so I need to go left multiple steps.\n\nFrom (5,5), to (4,5), then to (3,5), but (3,5) is currently a body segment, but after move to (5,5), (3,5) is still body? Positions: after move to (5,5), body is (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is the last body segment.\n\nIf I move left to (4,5), (4,5) is free, so move to (4,5): head to (4,5), no food, so body: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)  // tail (3,5) removed\n\nNow, from (4,5), I can go left to (3,5), but (3,5) was just removed, so free? After removing (3,5), it is free, so I can move to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is now free.\n\nMove to (3,5): turn 28, head to (3,5), no food there? Food is at (1,5), not (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is empty.\n\nThen body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)  // tail (2,5) removed\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go down to (3,4), left to (2,5), up to (3,6) but (3,6) is body, collision; right to (4,5) body.\n\nSo down to (3,4) or left to (2,5)\n\n(2,5) is currently body? After move, (2,5) was removed as tail? In positions, (2,5) was removed when we moved to (3,5)? Let's see: when head moved to (3,5), tail (2,5) was removed, so (2,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) free.\n\nSo from (3,5), go left to (2,5) or down to (3,4).\n\nTo reach (1,5), I need to go to (2,5) then left to (1,5).\n\n(2,5) to (1,5) is left.\n\nAt turn 28, head at (3,5), if I move left to (2,5), head to (2,5), no food, body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)  // tail (2,6) removed\n\nThen turn 29, from (2,5), move left to (1,5), which has food, so eat it, head to (1,5), food eaten, so length increases, tail not removed.\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), and since food eaten, tail stays, so (3,6) is still there? Let's list.\n\nPrevious body before move: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), and (3,6) was the tail? When we moved to (2,5) at turn 28, positions were: after move to (2,5), head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), and (3,6) was removed as tail? No.\n\nAt turn 28: moved to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), and tail (2,6) removed? Earlier:\n\nAfter turn 27 move to (5,5): positions head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)? No.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nStart over.\n\nTurn 27 initial: snake positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] head at (5,6) dir R.\n\nMove down to (5,5):\n\n- New head: (5,5)\n\n- Add new head, remove tail if no food. No food at (5,5), so remove tail (4,5)\n\n- New positions: head (5,5), then (5,6) [previous head], then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)  // (4,5) removed, so body segments: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is the last segment.\n\nNow turn 28: from (5,5), move left to (4,5)\n\n(4,5) is free, no food.\n\nMove to (4,5): new head (4,5), body: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)  // remove tail (3,5)\n\n(3,5) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)  // (3,5) gone\n\n(2,5) is last? Segments: (4,5) head, then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) so (2,5) is tail.\n\nNow from (4,5), move left to (3,5)? (3,5) is free now, since removed.\n\nMove to (3,5): turn 29, head to (3,5), no food there, so new head (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)  // remove tail (2,5)\n\n(2,5) removed.\n\nNow positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is tail.\n\nFood at (1,5) can be eaten on turn 29 if I move to (1,5), but from (3,5) to (1,5) is not adjacent; (3,5) to (1,5) is two steps left, but I can only move one step.\n\nFrom (3,5), to reach (1,5), I need to go to (2,5) first, then to (1,5).\n\nBut at turn 29, I'm at (3,5), move to (2,5) or (3,4), etc.\n\nIf I move left to (2,5)? (2,5) is free? After removing (2,5), it is free.\n\nMove to (2,5): head to (2,5), no food? (2,5) has no food, food is at (1,5).\n\nSo move to (2,5), no eat, so new head (2,5), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)  // remove tail (2,6)\n\n(2,6) removed.\n\nThen turn 30, from (2,5), move left to (1,5), which has food, eat it, so grow, tail not removed.\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), and since ate, add new segment, so tail was (3,6), but not removed, so body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) and new head (1,5), so positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)] length 8.\n\nBut turn 30, food (1,5) is gone after turn 29? Life span: at turn 27, life span 3, so exists on turn 27,28,29. Gone at turn 30. So on turn 30, it is not there, cannot eat.\n\nTurn 29 is the last chance to eat (1,5).\n\nAt turn 29, head at (3,5), (1,5) is two cells away, I can't reach it in one move. From (3,5), moving to (2,5) or (3,4) or (4,5), none is (1,5), so I cannot eat (1,5) on turn 29. Thus, if I take this path, I miss (1,5) food.\n\nSimilarly, in the first path to (6,6), I also missed it.\n\nTo eat (1,5), I need to be at (1,5) on or before turn 29.\n\nFrom current position (5,6) at turn 27, (1,5) is at (1,5), which is 4 steps away: left to (4,6), but (4,6) is body, cannot go left directly.\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves are only right or down, not left or up.\n\nSo from (5,6), I can only go to (6,6) or (5,5), both of which are not towards (1,5) immediately.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go left to (4,5), then to (3,5), then to (2,5) on turn 29, but (2,5) is not (1,5), and on turn 30 I can go to (1,5) but food gone.\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat (1,5) because I can't reach it by turn 29 from here with the snake body blocking the way.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance: from (5,6) to (1,5) is |5-1| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 cells away.\n\nIn 2 turns (turn 27 and 28), I can move 2 steps, but to reach (1,5) by turn 29, I need to be there on turn 29, so I need to move towards it on turn 27 and 28.\n\nBut on turn 27, from (5,6), I can only go down or right, not left. Down to (5,5) is one step down, then on turn 28 from (5,5) I can go left to (4,5), then on turn 29 to (3,5), but (1,5) is still two away. No direct path.\n\nIf I go down to (5,5), then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5) on turn 28? Turn 27: to (5,5), turn 28: to (4,5), turn 29: to (3,5), but (3,5) is not (1,5), and I can't go further left in one step to (2,5) on turn 29, but (1,5) is not reached.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 29, I can go to (2,5) or (3,4), but (2,5) is closer, but still not (1,5). And (1,5) can only be eaten on turn 29 at the latest, but I'm at (3,5) or (4,5), not at (1,5).\n\nSo it's impossible to eat (1,5) from here; the snake body blocks the direct path, and I don't have enough moves.\n\nTherefore, I should forget about (1,5) and focus on other food.\n\n(1,5) will disappear without being eaten.\n\nNow, other food: (6,2) and (3,1).\n\n(6,2) life span 5, exists until turn 31.\n\n(3,1) life span 8, until turn 34.\n\nNow, back to initial choice.\n\nIf I move right to (6,6) on turn 27, I go to (6,6), then forced to (6,5) on turn 28, then to (5,5) on turn 29.\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 29, I can go down to (5,4) or left to (4,5), etc.\n\nTo reach (6,2), from (5,5), I can go down to (5,4), then to (5,3), then to (5,2), then to (6,2) on turn 31 or earlier.\n\nTurn 29: at (5,5), move down to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 30: from (5,4) to (5,3)\n\nTurn 31: from (5,3) to (5,2)? (5,2) is free? Then to (6,2) on turn 32? But (6,2) life span 5 at turn 27, exists turns 27-31, gone at turn 32. So turn 31 is last chance.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 31, I can move to (6,2) if adjacent? (5,3) to (6,2) is not adjacent; |5-6|=1, |3-2|=1, so diagonal, not adjacent. I can only move up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo from (5,3), I can go to (5,2), (5,4), (4,3), (6,3).\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), so from (5,3), I can go to (5,2) or (6,3), but not directly to (6,2).\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go to (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, from (6,3) to (6,2).\n\nBut on turn 31, if I am at (5,3), I can go to (5,2) or (6,3), then on turn 32 to (6,2), but turn 32 food gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 31, I need to be at (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nSo from (5,3) on turn 31, I can't reach (6,2) directly; I need to be closer.\n\nIf on turn 30 I am at (6,3) or (5,2), then on turn 31 I can go to (6,2).\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFrom turn 29 at (5,5), move down to (5,4) turn 29? Turn 29 position.\n\nIn the right-move path:\n\nTurn 27: move right to (6,6)\n\nPositions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) // (4,5) removed\n\nTurn 28: move down to (6,5)\n\nPositions: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) // (3,5) removed\n\nTurn 29: move left to (5,5)  // only choice, as earlier\n\nPositions: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) // (2,5) removed\n\nNow from (5,5) turn 29, I can move down to (5,4) or left to (4,5) or right to (6,5) but (6,5) is body.\n\nSo say move down to (5,4)\n\nTurn 29: move to (5,4), no food, so head (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) // remove tail (2,6)\n\n(2,6) removed.\n\nNow turn 30: from (5,4), move down to (5,3)\n\nPositions: head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) // remove tail (3,6)\n\n(3,6) removed.\n\nTurn 31: from (5,3), move to (5,2) or (6,3)\n\nIf move to (5,2), head (5,2), no food there, body behind.\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), not (5,2).\n\nThen on turn 31, I am at (5,2), can move to (6,2) on turn 32, but turn 32 food gone.\n\nIf on turn 31 from (5,3) I move to (6,3), head to (6,3), no food, then on turn 32 to (6,2), but gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,2) in this path either.\n\nIf on turn 29 from (5,5) I move left to (4,5), then I might go towards (3,1) or something.\n\nBut let's try the down-move first.\n\nTurn 27: move down to (5,5)\n\nPositions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) // (4,5) removed\n\nNow from (5,5), turn 28, I can move down to (5,4), or left to (4,5), or right to (6,5)\n\nTo reach (6,2), I can go down then right.\n\nMove down to (5,4) on turn 28.\n\nTurn 28: move to (5,4), no food, head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) // remove tail (3,5)\n\n(3,5) removed.\n\nTurn 29: from (5,4), move down to (5,3)\n\nPositions: head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) // remove tail (2,5)\n\n(2,5) removed.\n\nTurn 30: from (5,3), move down to (5,2)\n\nPositions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) // remove tail (2,6)\n\n(2,6) removed.\n\nNow (6,2) is at (6,2), adjacent to (5,2)? (5,2) to (6,2) is right, so on turn 31, from (5,2) move right to (6,2), which has food, so eat it.\n\nLife span: (6,2) exists on turn 31, so can be eaten.\n\nTurn 31: move to (6,2), eat, so grow, tail not removed.\n\nNew positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) and since ate, add new segment, so body includes (3,6) and new tail? Previous tail was (3,6), not removed, so positions: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)] length 8.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut is (6,2) safe? (6,2) is not under snake or anything, and no immediate collision.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), but (6,2) is free.\n\nNow, what about the other food (3,1)? We can go there later.\n\nIn this case, by moving down on turn 27, we can eat (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nIf we move right on turn 27, we couldn't eat it.\n\nNow, another option: from (5,5) on turn 28, if we move right to (6,5), then down, etc., but might be similar.\n\nBut moving down directly seems better.\n\nAlso, we have (3,1) to consider for later.\n\nBut first, let's confirm the moves.\n\nSo turn 27: move down to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 28: move down to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 29: move down to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 30: move down to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 31: move right to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 30, we are at (5,2), and move to (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nNow, after eating, we are at (6,2), and we need to think beyond.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid risks.\n\nIn this path, when we go down to (5,2), is there any risk?\n\nFor example, on turn 30, at (5,2), moving to (6,2) is fine.\n\nBut after that, from (6,2), possible moves: up to (6,3), down to (6,1), left to (5,2), right to (7,2) but x=7 wall invalid.\n\n(6,1) is internal obstacle, so invalid.\n\n(5,2) is body, since we just came from there? After eating at (6,2), positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n\nSo moving left to (5,2) would collide.\n\nDown to (6,1) obstacle.\n\nRight wall.\n\nSo only up to (6,3) possible.\n\n(6,3) should be free.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut we can plan later.\n\nNow, what about the initial down move.\n\nBut we have another food (3,1) at (3,1), which we might go for after.\n\nSince we ate (6,2), we grew, so the snake is longer.\n\nBut for now, the path to eat (6,2) seems feasible only if we move down first.\n\nIf we move right first, we go to (6,6) and then down, but we end up at (5,5) on turn 29, and from there to (5,4) on turn 30, then (5,3) on turn 31, but (6,2) is at (6,2), and on turn 31 from (5,3) I can move to (6,3), but (6,2) is below, not adjacent, so I can't eat on turn 31; I need to be at (6,2) on turn 31, which I can't from (5,3) directly. If I go to (6,3) on turn 31, then (6,2) might be gone or not, but life span gone at turn 32, so on turn 32 I can move down to (6,2), but if it exists? Turn 31 is last, gone after turn 31, so turn 32 not available.\n\nLife span: at turn 27, life span 5, so exists turns 27,28,29,30,31. Gone at turn 32.\n\nSo must eat by turn 31.\n\nIn the right-move path, on turn 31 I am at (5,3) or (6,3), not at (6,2), so I can't eat it.\n\nWhereas in down-move, I am at (5,2) on turn 30, then to (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nSo clearly, moving down on turn 27 is better to reach the food.\n\nMoreover, there is (3,1) which we can consider.\n\nBut let's see the grid with obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1) is obstacle, (6,1) obstacle.\n\nIn the path to (5,2), it should be fine.\n\nFrom (6,2), after eating, I can only go up to (6,3), since other directions blocked.\n\n(6,3) is free, I assume.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can go up to (6,4), but (6,4) is obstacle, invalid; left to (5,3); down to (6,2) body; right wall.\n\nSo only left to (5,3).\n\nThen from (5,3), I can go left to (4,3), down to (5,2) body, up to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut we have food at (3,1), which is below.\n\n(3,1) at x=3,y=1.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go left to (4,3), then to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then down to (3,1) to eat.\n\n(3,1) life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nFor example, on turn 32, after eating (6,2) at turn 31, head at (6,2), move up to (6,3) on turn 32? Turn 31 ate at (6,2), so on turn 32, from (6,2), move to (6,3).\n\nThen turn 33: from (6,3) move left to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 34: from (5,3) move left to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 35: from (4,3) move left to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 36: from (3,3) move down to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 37: from (3,2) move down to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut (3,1) life span 8 at turn 27, exists until turn 34? Life span 8: exists turns 27 to 34, gone at turn 35.\n\nSo on turn 37, it's gone.\n\nTurn 34 is last chance.\n\nAt turn 31, we eat (6,2), turn 32 to (6,3), turn 33 to (5,3), turn 34 to (4,3)? From (5,3) to (4,3) on turn 34, but (3,1) is at (3,1), not reached.\n\nTo eat on turn 34, I need to be at (3,1) on turn 34.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 33, I can go to (4,3), (5,2), (5,4), (6,3).\n\nNone is (3,1).\n\nThen on turn 34, from say (4,3), I can go to (3,3), but not to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is two rows down.\n\nSo I cannot reach (3,1) by turn 34 from there.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I should head towards (3,1) earlier.\n\nFor example, from (5,2) after moving down, but on turn 30 I am at (5,2), and I move to (6,2) on turn 31 to eat.\n\nBut before that, on turn 30 at (5,2), I could go to (5,1) but (5,1) is obstacle, invalid, or to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to go to (6,2) to eat.\n\nAfter eating, from (6,2) on turn 31, I go to (6,3), then to (5,3), then from (5,3) I can go down to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, or left to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,1) is at y=1, and there is obstacle at (2,4), (1,2), etc.\n\nPerhaps I should not go for (3,1) if it's risky or not reachable in time.\n\nLife span until turn 34, so from turn 31, I have a few turns.\n\nTurn 31 head at (6,2), after eating.\n\nTo reach (3,1), which is |6-3| + |2-1| = 3+1=4 cells away.\n\nIn 3 moves? Turn 32,33,34.\n\nBut I need to be there on turn 34.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (3,1): one path could be left to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, cannot; so only up to (6,3).\n\nThen from (6,3) to (5,3), then to (4,3), then on turn 34 to (3,3), but (3,3) not (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,3) I can go down to (4,2), then to (3,2), then to (3,1) on turn 35, too late.\n\nNot possible in 3 moves.\n\nDirectly: from (6,2) to (6,3) turn 32, (6,3) to (5,3) turn 33, (5,3) to (4,3) turn 34, but (4,3) to (3,1) not adjacent.\n\nI could go down earlier, but from (6,2) I cannot go down.\n\nSo it seems difficult to reach (3,1) in time, and it might be risky with obstacles.\n\nFor example, (2,4) obstacle, (1,2) obstacle, so the area might be tight.\n\nSince we ate (6,2), we have score, and we can survive longer.\n\nBut for now, with the down move, we can eat (6,2).\n\nIn the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 27.\n\nSo I should specify actions from turn 27 to turn 31 or more.\n\nIn the down-move path:\n\nTurn 27: move down to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: move down to (5,4)\n\nTurn 29: move down to (5,3)\n\nTurn 30: move down to (5,2)\n\nTurn 31: move right to (6,2) to eat\n\nThen beyond, but at least 5 turns: 27 to 31 is 5 actions.\n\nTurn 27,28,29,30,31: that's 5 turns.\n\nNow, about the direction: current head direction is R, moving down is allowed, since not reverse.\n\nAfter moving down, new direction is D, then down again, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, moving down multiple times is fine.\n\nBut on turn 30 at (5,2), moving to (6,2) is right, which is fine.\n\nAlso, need to check if any food under body, but in this case, no.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nSo this seems a good plan.\n\nIf I move right first, I cannot get the food, so worse.\n\nTherefore, I should go with moving down.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nI need to output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 27: D\nTurn 28: D\nTurn 29: D\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: R\n}\n\nBut I should include a bit more? Or just these?\n\nIt says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and provide actions for multiple turns.\n\nIn the format, it shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo for t1=27, actions for 27,28,29,30,31.\n\nIn turn 31, I move R to eat the food.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that in this path, I don't hit any wall or body.\n\nIn turn 27: move D to (5,5), free.\n\nTurn 28: D to (5,4), free.\n\nTurn 29: D to (5,3), free.\n\nTurn 30: D to (5,2), should be free? Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,2) is y=2, not y=1, so free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,1) is listed, so (5,2) not obstacle.\n\nThen turn 31: R to (6,2), free and food.\n\nAfter that, from (6,2), I have to move up to (6,3), but I don't need to specify beyond, but for safety, (6,3) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, no issues.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list the positions briefly.\n\nAfter turn 27 move D: head (5,5), body (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) // (4,5) removed\n\nAfter turn 28 move D to (5,4): head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) // (3,5) removed\n\nAfter turn 29 move D to (5,3): head (5,3), body (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) // (2,5) removed\n\nAfter turn 30 move D to (5,2): head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) // (2,6) removed\n\nAfter turn 31 move R to (6,2): head (6,2), and since food eaten, body grows: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) and new segment, so positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) length 8.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, I think this is the best.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the plan prioritizes eating the positive food at (6,2) before it disappears (life span 5, must be eaten by turn 31). The food at (1,5) cannot be reached by turn 29 (its last available turn) due to the snake's starting position and body blockage, so it is ignored. The food at (3,1) has a longer life span (until turn 34) and can be pursued after eating (6,2).\n\nThe chosen path involves moving down from the starting position (5,6) to (5,5) on turn 27, then continuing down to (5,4) on turn 28, (5,3) on turn 29, and (5,2) on turn 30. This positions the snake to move right to (6,2) on turn 31 to eat the food, increasing the length by 1. This sequence avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions, and it reaches (6,2) on the last possible turn (turn 31).\n\nBeyond turn 31, the snake should head towards (3,1) to eat it by turn 34. From (6,2), the only safe move is up to (6,3) on turn 32, then left to (5,3) on turn 33, and further left/down as needed. However, since the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, the actions for turns 27 to 32 are provided, covering the critical path to (6,2) and the initial move towards (3,1).\n\n**Action Plan (Turns 27 to 32):**\n- **Turn 27 (from (5,6))**: Move down (D) to (5,5). This avoids the wall at (5,7) and starts the path toward (6,2). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 28 (from (5,5))**: Move down (D) to (5,4). Continues the descent. No food eaten.\n- **Turn 29 (from (5,4))**: Move down (D) to (5,3). Approaches (5,2). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 30 (from (5,3))**: Move down (D) to (5,2). Positions for the move to (6,2). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 31 (from (5,2))**: Move right (R) to (6,2). Eats positive food (+1, length increases to 8).\n- **Turn 32 (from (6,2))**: Move up (U) to (6,3). This is the only safe move (down to (6,1) is an obstacle, left to (5,2) is body, right to (7,2) is wall). Begins the path toward (3,1).\n\nThis plan eats one positive food immediately and sets up for potential future food at (3,1). It avoids all risks:\n- No wall collisions: The path stays within bounds (x=1-6, y=2-6) during these turns.\n- No body collisions: The snake moves to free cells, and the tail moves away as needed.\n- No instant reverse: Movements are consistent with direction changes (e.g., down to down is allowed, right after down is allowed).\n- Tail reward danger: Not applicable, as no food is under the tail.\n\nAfter turn 32, to reach (3,1) by turn 34, the snake can move left to (5,3) on turn 33, then left to (4,3) on turn 34, but (3,1) may not be reachable by turn 34 due to distance. If not, the snake should prioritize survival by exploring open areas.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 27: D\nTurn 28: D\nTurn 29: D\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: R\nTurn 32: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 28, and I'm playing Snake. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There are also internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2).\n\nThe snake positions are: head at (5,5), then body segments at (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5). So the tail is at (3,5). The head direction is down, which is decreasing y, since down is (x,y-1). So from (5,5), moving down would go to (5,4).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,5) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 28, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 29? Let me clarify.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So if life span is L at turn t, it will be present until turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, then it disappears. But since it decreases including current turn, at turn t, if life span is L, it has L turns left, including turn t. So it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it means it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something. I need to be careful.\n\nThe problem says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, for a food with life span N at turn t:\n\n- At turn t: countdown = N\n\n- After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So it is present for N turns, from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n\nFor example, if N=1 at turn t, it is present only at turn t, disappears after turn t.\n\nIf N=2 at turn t, present at turn t and turn t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for food at (1,5): value 1, life span 2 at turn 28. So it will disappear after turn 29? Life span 2 at turn 28 means:\n\n- Turn 28: countdown 2\n\n- Turn 29: countdown 1, still present\n\n- Turn 30: countdown 0, disappears, so not present.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2): value 1, life span 4 at turn 28, so present until turn 31? Countdown: t28:4, t29:3, t30:2, t31:1, t32:0 disappears. So present from t28 to t31 inclusive? t28 to t31 is 4 turns: t28, t29, t30, t31. Countdown decreases each turn: at start of t28, countdown=4; after processing t28, countdown=3; ... after t31, countdown=0, disappears. So it is available to be eaten from t28 to t31.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1): value 1, life span 7, so present for 7 turns from t28 to t34.\n\n(1,4): value 1, life span 10, present from t28 to t37.\n\nAll food has value 1, positive, no negative food here.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,5), direction down. So possible moves: since direction is down, I can't move up immediately (no instant reverse), so I can move down, left, or right? Directions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n\nCurrent head direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on the next turn. But I can move down (same direction), left, or right.\n\nNow, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions: head (5,5), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5). So let's list coordinates:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,6)\n\n- Segment 2: (4,6)\n\n- Segment 3: (3,6)\n\n- Segment 4: (2,6)\n\n- Segment 5: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 6: (3,5)  // tail\n\nI think (3,5) is the tail.\n\nNow, the snake body: from head to tail: (5,5) -> (5,6) -> (4,6) -> (3,6) -> (2,6) -> (2,5) -> (3,5)\n\nSo, let's plot this on a grid mentally.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n- Row y=6: cells (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) occupied\n\n- Row y=5: (5,5) head, (2,5), (3,5) occupied? (2,5) and (3,5) are both at y=5.\n\n(2,5) and (3,5) are body segments.\n\nAlso, at (5,5) is head.\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (1,5) value 1, life 2\n\n- (6,2) value 1, life 4\n\n- (3,1) value 1, life 7\n\n- (1,4) value 1, life 10\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nBorders are walls, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x,y are walls.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's see where the snake can move from current position (5,5).\n\nPossible moves: down, left, right (since cannot move up, opposite direction).\n\n- Down: to (5,4)  // y decreases\n\n- Left: to (4,5)\n\n- Right: to (6,5)\n\nNow, check if these are valid:\n\nFirst, (5,4): is it a wall or obstacle?\n\nWalls: borders, so (5,4) is within bounds, x=5, y=4, both between 0 and 7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,4) not in this list, so not an obstacle.\n\nNow, is it occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5). So (5,4) not in this list, so free.\n\nBut when moving, if head moves to (5,4), the tail will move away, so as long as no body collision at the moment of move.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nIn this case, moving to (5,4): current body segments are (5,6), (4,6), etc., none at (5,4), so safe.\n\nSimilarly, left to (4,5): (4,5) not occupied? Snake has (4,6) at y=6, but (4,5) not listed. Positions are (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5). So (4,5) is free? Let's see: x=4,y=5. Not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. Obstacles are at (6,4) etc., not (4,5). So (4,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, right to (6,5): (6,5) not occupied? Snake positions no (6,5), walls: x=6,y=5, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,5) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) is different. (6,4) is obstacle, (6,5) is not listed as obstacle, so should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles given: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (6,5) not in this list, so it's free.\n\nBut (6,5) is adjacent to (6,4) which is obstacle, but that doesn't make it a wall, unless specified.\n\nThe obstacles are specific cells, so (6,5) should be traversable.\n\nNow, also, food: no food at (5,4), (4,5), or (6,5). Food at (1,5), (6,2), etc., not here.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves.\n\nCurrent turn t=28, I need to output actions for turn 28, 29, 30, etc., but how many? The answer format says to output for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns. I think I need to output a sequence, but since it's interactive or something, but here I think for this response, I should output a sequence for the next few turns, say 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but for the answer, I need to provide actions starting from turn 28.\n\nPerhaps I should plan a sequence for the next 5-6 turns.\n\nSince food has life spans, I need to prioritize which food to go for.\n\nFirst, let's list the food and their expiration:\n\n- (1,5): life span 2 at t28, so disappears after t29 (present at t28 and t29)\n\n- (6,2): life span 4 at t28, disappears after t31 (present t28 to t31)\n\n- (3,1): life span 7 at t28, disappears after t34 (present t28 to t34)\n\n- (1,4): life span 10 at t28, disappears after t37 (present t28 to t37)\n\nAll value 1, so equally valuable, but some have shorter life, so I should eat those first if possible to not miss them.\n\n(1,5) disappears soon, in 2 turns, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\nBut can I reach it?\n\nSnake head at (5,5), food at (1,5), same y, different x.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (1,5) is 4 units left, but there might be obstacles.\n\nPath: from (5,5) to (4,5), then to (3,5), but (3,5) is current tail position.\n\n(3,5) is occupied by snake body now.\n\nBut when I move, the snake moves, so tail moves.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (2,4) and (1,2), but (1,5) is at x=1,y=5.\n\nLet's see the grid.\n\nFirst, for turn 28: from (5,5), possible moves: D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\nIf I go left to (4,5), that gets me closer to (1,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), I could go left to (3,5), but (3,5) is currently occupied by tail, but when I move to (4,5) on turn 28, what happens?\n\nOn turn 28, I move head to new position, say (4,5). Then the body segments follow: the segment that was at (5,5) moves to where head was? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n\nSo positions update: new head position, then the first body segment goes to old head position, second to old first body position, and so on, tail moves away from its position.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (5,5)\n\n1: (5,6)\n\n2: (4,6)\n\n3: (3,6)\n\n4: (2,6)\n\n5: (2,5)\n\n6: (3,5) tail\n\nAfter move, if head moves to (4,5):\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nThen segment 1 (was at (5,6)) moves to (5,5) (old head)\n\nSegment 2 (was at (4,6)) moves to (5,6) (old pos of seg1)\n\nSegment 3 (was at (3,6)) moves to (4,6) (old pos of seg2)\n\nSegment 4 (was at (2,6)) moves to (3,6) (old pos of seg3)\n\nSegment 5 (was at (2,5)) moves to (2,6) (old pos of seg4)\n\nSegment 6 tail (was at (3,5)) moves to (2,5) (old pos of seg5)\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)  // tail at (2,5)\n\nOld tail was at (3,5), moved to (2,5).\n\nNow, food at (1,5) is still there.\n\nFrom new head (4,5), I can move left to (3,5), but (3,5) is now free? In the new positions, (3,5) is not occupied; occupied are (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5). So (3,5) is free.\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5, which is not in the list, so yes.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move left to (2,5), but (2,5) is occupied by the tail in new positions? In the new positions after turn 28, (2,5) is occupied by the last body segment.\n\nIf on turn 29, I move from (4,5) to (3,5), head to (3,5).\n\nThen body: seg1 to (4,5), seg2 to (5,5), etc., down to tail to (2,6) or something.\n\nBut (2,5) is occupied, but when head moves to (3,5), which is free, no problem.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move to (2,5)? (2,5) is currently occupied by body, but after the move, the tail will move away.\n\nWhen head moves to (2,5), at that moment, (2,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn the sequence: at start of turn 29, positions: head (4,5), body: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\nI move head to (3,5). (3,5) is free now, so no collision.\n\nThen new head (3,5), seg1 to (4,5), seg2 to (5,5), seg3 to (5,6), seg4 to (4,6), seg5 to (3,6), seg6 to (2,6), and tail was (2,5), but since head moved, the last segment moves to old position of seg5, which was (2,6)? Let's index.\n\nAfter turn 28: positions: 0:(4,5), 1:(5,5), 2:(5,6), 3:(4,6), 4:(3,6), 5:(2,6), 6:(2,5)\n\nAfter turn 29 move to (3,5):\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nThen seg1 moves to old head (4,5)\n\nseg2 moves to old seg1 (5,5)\n\nseg3 moves to old seg2 (5,6)\n\nseg4 moves to old seg3 (4,6)\n\nseg5 moves to old seg4 (3,6)\n\nseg6 moves to old seg5 (2,6)\n\nAnd the tail, which was seg6 at (2,5), but since it moved, the new tail is at (2,6)? Positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)  // so (2,5) is vacated.\n\nNow, (2,5) is free.\n\nFood at (1,5) is at (1,5), which is adjacent left of (2,5)? (2,5) and (1,5) are adjacent if x differs by 1.\n\ny same, x=2 and x=1.\n\nFrom (3,5), I moved to (3,5), now head at (3,5).\n\nFrom there, on turn 30, I can move left to (2,5)? (2,5) is now free, as above.\n\nMove to (2,5): head to (2,5), which is free, no issue.\n\nThen positions update: head (2,5), seg1 to (3,5), seg2 to (4,5), etc., down to tail to (3,6) or something.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move left to (1,5) to eat the food.\n\n(1,5) is the food cell.\n\nIf I move to (1,5) on turn 30, is it safe?\n\nAt that point, (1,5) should be free, and no collision.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nAlso, walls: (1,5) is at x=1,y=5, not border, border is x=0 or x=7, so (1,5) is within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,5) not, so ok.\n\nSo from head at (5,5) turn 28, if I go left to (4,5), then on turn 29 to (3,5), turn 30 to (2,5), turn 31 to (1,5) to eat.\n\nBut food at (1,5) disappears after turn 29? Life span: at turn 28, life span 2, so present at t28 and t29, disappears after t29, so not present at t30.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nLife span: at turn t=28, life span=2, meaning it will be present for this turn and the next, so at turn 29, it is still present with countdown 1, and after turn 29, countdown 0, disappears, so not present at turn 30.\n\nTherefore, to eat (1,5), I must eat it on turn 28 or turn 29.\n\nBut on turn 28, head is at (5,5), (1,5) is not adjacent; it's 4 cells away, so I can't eat it on turn 28.\n\nOn turn 29, if I can be at (1,5) or adjacent to move in.\n\nBut from (5,5) to (1,5) in one move? No, I need multiple moves.\n\nFrom (5,5), on turn 28, I can move to (4,5) or (5,4) or (6,5), none of which is (1,5).\n\nThen on turn 29, from say (4,5), I can move to (3,5), but (1,5) is still not reachable in one move.\n\nThe only way to eat on turn 29 is if on turn 29 the head is at a cell adjacent to (1,5) and I move to it.\n\nAdjacent cells to (1,5): (1,4), (1,6), (0,5), (2,5)\n\n(0,5) is border wall, x=0, so invalid.\n\n(1,6): y=6, within bounds.\n\n(1,4): y=4, within.\n\n(2,5): x=2,y=5.\n\nNow, on turn 29, if head is at one of these, I can move to (1,5).\n\nBut on turn 28, head is at (5,5), so in one move, I can be at (4,5), (5,4), or (6,5). None of these is adjacent to (1,5); (4,5) is at distance, (2,5) is closer but not adjacent.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (1,5) is not adjacent; need to move to (3,5) first, etc.\n\nSo it's impossible to reach (1,5) by turn 29, since it takes at least 4 moves: to (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), but that's 3 moves after turn 28? Turn 28: move to, say, (4,5) — not eaten.\n\nTurn 29: move to (3,5) — not eaten.\n\nTurn 30: move to (2,5) — not eaten.\n\nTurn 31: move to (1,5) — but food gone by then.\n\nSince food only on t28 and t29, and I can't be at (1,5) on t28 or t29, I cannot eat this food. It will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSimilarly, even if I go directly left, but I can't reach in time.\n\nSo (1,5) is unreachable before it disappears. So I should ignore it.\n\nNow, other food: (6,2) at (6,2), life span 4, so present until t31.\n\n(3,1) at (3,1), life span 7, until t34.\n\n(1,4) at (1,4), life span 10, until t37.\n\nNow, head at (5,5), I need to go towards these.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, possible moves on turn 28: from (5,5), direction down, so can move D, L, R.\n\n- D to (5,4)\n\n- L to (4,5)\n\n- R to (6,5)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option.\n\nFirst, move down to (5,4):\n\n(5,4) is free, as we thought.\n\nThen after move, positions: head (5,4), body: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)  // tail at (2,5)\n\nNow, from (5,4), I can move down to (5,3), left to (4,4), right to (6,4), but (6,4) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\n(6,4) is wall, so invalid.\n\nAlso, cannot move up because current direction? After moving down, the new head direction is down, so opposite is up, so I cannot move up on next turn.\n\nBut for now, from (5,4), possible moves: down to (5,3), left to (4,4), or right but (6,4) wall, so only down or left.\n\n(5,3) is within bounds, not wall, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) free.\n\nFood at (6,2) is at (6,2), which is below, so moving down might be good.\n\n(3,1) is left and down, (1,4) is left.\n\nBut let's see the second move option: left to (4,5)\n\nAs before, head to (4,5), then positions: head (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move down to (4,4), left to (3,5), or up? Current direction: after moving left from (5,5) to (4,5), new head direction is left, so opposite is right, so cannot move right on next turn, but I can move down, left, or up.\n\nU, D, L, R.\n\nFrom (4,5), move left to (3,5), down to (4,4), or up to (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) is occupied by body? In current positions, after turn 28, (4,6) is occupied by a body segment.\n\nAfter moving to (4,5) on turn 28, positions: head (4,5), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (4,6), seg4 (3,6), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (2,5)\n\nSo (4,6) is occupied by seg3.\n\nIf I move up to (4,6) on turn 29, that would be collision with body, since (4,6) is not the tail; tail is at (2,5), so moving to (4,6) would kill the snake.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (4,4) or left to (3,5) are safe.\n\n(3,5) is free now, as we saw earlier.\n\nThird option, move right to (6,5) on turn 28.\n\n(6,5) free? Yes, as before.\n\nThen positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\nFrom (6,5), I can move down to (6,4), but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\nMove left to (5,5), but (5,5) is now occupied by body seg1, so moving to (5,5) would be collision.\n\nMove up to (6,6), but y=6, within bounds? y=6, x=6, borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not border, x=6 not border.\n\nBut (6,6) is not occupied? In positions, after move, occupied are (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), etc., no (6,6), so free.\n\nAlso, no wall, obstacle not at (6,6), so can move up to (6,6).\n\nCurrent direction after moving right to (6,5), new direction right, so opposite is left, cannot move left, but can move up, down, or right.\n\nBut down to (6,4) is wall, left cannot, so only up or right? Right to (7,5), but x=7 is border wall, so cannot.\n\nx=7 is wall, so from (6,5), possible moves: up to (6,6) or down but (6,4) wall, left to (5,5) but occupied and cannot because moving left might be opposite? Direction: head moved right to (6,5), so direction right. Opposite is left, so cannot move left to (5,5).\n\nAnd right to (7,5) wall, down to (6,4) wall, so only possible move is up to (6,6).\n\nSo if I move right on turn 28, on turn 29 I must move up to (6,6), no choice.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut it might be limiting.\n\nMoreover, (6,6) is near border, might be risky.\n\nBut let's think long term.\n\nNow, back to food.\n\n(1,5) is impossible to eat, so ignore.\n\n(6,2) at (6,2), which is below and right of current position.\n\nFrom (5,5), if I move down to (5,4), then I can go to (5,3), etc. towards (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at x=6,y=2.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (6,4), which is above (6,3) and (6,2)? (6,4) is wall, so from (6,3) I can go to (6,2), but (6,4) blocks access from above except through other paths.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) at (3,1), which is left and down.\n\n(1,4) at (1,4), left.\n\nAlso, the snake is currently at (5,5), with body around.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger. But no food on tail now, I think.\n\nTail is at (3,5), no food there.\n\nFood at (1,5) but we can't eat it.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should go for the soon-to-expire food if possible, but (6,2) expires in 4 turns, so by t31.\n\nFrom (5,5), to (6,2): delta x=1, delta y=3, so Manhattan distance 4, so I can reach in 4 moves.\n\nFor example: turn 28: down to (5,4)\n\nTurn 29: down to (5,3)\n\nTurn 30: down to (5,2)? But (5,2) might be free.\n\nThen turn 31: right to (6,2) to eat.\n\n(6,2) present until t31, so on turn 31 I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I go other ways.\n\nBut from (5,2) to (6,2), but (6,2) is food, and (6,2) might be adjacent to something.\n\nBut first, is the path clear?\n\nFrom (5,5) to (5,4): free.\n\n(5,4) to (5,3): (5,3) should be free, no walls or obstacles. Obstacles are (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),etc., (5,3) not, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) to (5,2): (5,2) free? (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,2) not, so free.\n\nThen (5,2) to (6,2): (6,2) is food, but is it accessible? (6,2) not wall, not occupied.\n\nBut between (5,2) and (6,2), no issue.\n\nHowever, (6,4) is obstacle, but that's above, not blocking (6,2).\n\nSo this path seems possible.\n\nI could go directly, but from (5,5) I can't go to (6,5) then down, but (6,5) to (6,4) is wall, so I can't go down from (6,5).\n\nSo only way to (6,2) is via the bottom, like (5,2) then (6,2).\n\n(6,3) might be accessible from left or below.\n\nBut in this case, from (5,2) to (6,2) is fine.\n\nNow, on turn 31, if I eat (6,2), it would be before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nBut I need to think about the whole sequence.\n\nAnother food: (3,1) at (3,1), which I might go after.\n\n(1,4) at (1,4).\n\nAlso, the snake has a body, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving down on turn 28 to (5,4).\n\nThen positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nNow, from (5,4), I can move down to (5,3) or left to (4,4).\n\nIf I go down to (5,3), then to (5,2), then to (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nBut on turn 31, eating (6,2).\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nTurn 28: move D to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 29: from (5,4), move D to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 30: from (5,3), move D to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 31: from (5,2), move R to (6,2) to eat.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so length increases.\n\nWhen I eat food, on that turn, when head moves to food cell, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added.\n\nIn this case, on turn 31, move to (6,2), which has food, so eat, value +1, length +1, so tail stays, new segment at head position.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 28, if I move down.\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I should plan the sequence.\n\nAnother option: move left to (4,5) on turn 28.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go to (3,5) on turn 29, then to (3,4) or (2,5), etc., towards (3,1) or (1,4).\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), which is below.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), but (3,2) might be free, (3,1) food.\n\nBut (3,1) life span 7, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) at (1,4), from (3,5) to (2,5), (1,5) but gone, so to (1,4) via (1,4) from (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle, so cannot go to (2,4).\n\nSo to reach (1,4), I need to go around, like via (1,3) or (1,6), but (1,6) might be possible.\n\ny=4, x=1.\n\nFrom current, (4,5) to (3,5), then down to (3,4), then left to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so cannot.\n\nThen to (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), then up to (1,4), but longer.\n\n(1,4) has long life, so ok.\n\nBut (6,2) is closer and expires sooner.\n\nNow, moving right to (6,5) on turn 28.\n\nThen as before, on turn 29, must move up to (6,6) because no other choice.\n\nThen from (6,6), I can move left to (5,6) or up to (6,7), but y=7 is border wall, so cannot move up.\n\nx=6,y=7 is wall.\n\nMove left to (5,6), but (5,6) is occupied? After turn 28 move to (6,5), positions: head (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\nAfter turn 29 move to (6,6): head to (6,6), seg1 to (6,5), seg2 to (5,5), seg3 to (5,6), seg4 to (4,6), seg5 to (3,6), seg6 to (2,6), tail to (2,5) moved to (2,6)? Positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)  // tail at (2,6)\n\nFrom (6,6), I can move left to (5,6), but (5,6) is occupied by seg3, so moving to (5,6) would collide.\n\nMove down to (6,5), but (6,5) is now occupied by seg1, and also, moving down from (6,6) to (6,5), but (6,5) is body, collision.\n\nMove right to (7,6) but x=7 wall.\n\nMove up to (6,7) y=7 wall.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (5,6), but (5,6) is occupied, so death.\n\nTherefore, if I move right to (6,5) on turn 28, then on turn 29 I must move to (6,6), but from (6,6), all moves are invalid: left to (5,6) occupied, down to (6,5) occupied, right and up walls. So I die on turn 29.\n\nThus, moving right is suicidal. Not an option.\n\nTherefore, on turn 28, only possible moves are down or left.\n\nMoving up is not allowed because current direction down, opposite up.\n\nSo choices: D or L.\n\nNow, between down and left.\n\nIf I move down to (5,4), I can go towards (6,2) and eat it by turn 31.\n\nIf I move left to (4,5), I can go towards (3,1) or (1,4), but (6,2) might expire before I can reach it from left path.\n\nFrom (4,5), to go to (6,2) is farther: from (4,5) to (6,2) is delta x=2, delta y=3, distance 5, but I need to reach by turn 31.\n\nTurn 28: move to (4,5)\n\nTurn 29: say move to (3,5) or down to (4,4)\n\nIf down to (4,4), then turn 30 to (4,3) or (5,4), but to (6,2) need to go right and down.\n\nFor example, turn 29: to (4,4)\n\nTurn 30: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 31: to (5,3) or (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, so to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 32: to (5,2)\n\nTurn 33: to (6,2) but (6,2) disappears after t31, so on turn 33 it's gone.\n\nToo late.\n\nFrom (4,5) directly towards (6,2), but (6,5) might not be accessible, as before.\n\nSo from left position, I cannot reach (6,2) in time; it would take at least 4 moves to reach (6,2) from (4,5), e.g., (4,5) to (5,5) but (5,5) occupied after move, not possible; from (4,5) to (5,4) on turn 29, then to (5,3) turn 30, to (5,2) turn 31, to (6,2) turn 32, but t32 too late for (6,2).\n\n(6,2) present until t31, so must eat on or before turn 31.\n\nIf I eat on turn 31, it's ok.\n\nBut from (4,5) on turn 29, if I move to (5,4)? Is (5,4) free?\n\nAfter turn 28 move to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\n(5,4) is not occupied, free.\n\nThen turn 29: move to (5,4) — direction: from (4,5) to (5,4) is right and down? Movement is one cell, so to (5,4) is down-right? But moves are only U, D, L, R, no diagonals.\n\nTo move to (5,4) from (4,5), that would require diagonal, not allowed. Only adjacent orthogonally.\n\nFrom (4,5), adjacent cells: (4,4) down, (4,6) up, (3,5) left, (5,5) right.\n\nBut (4,6) up is occupied, (5,5) right occupied, so only possible moves: down to (4,4) or left to (3,5).\n\nCannot move directly to (5,4); not adjacent orthogonally.\n\n(4,5) and (5,4) are not adjacent; adjacent means same x or same y, differing by 1.\n\n(4,5) and (5,4) differ in both, so not adjacent.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can only go to (4,4) or (3,5).\n\n(4,4) is down, (3,5) is left.\n\nIf I go to (4,4), then from there to (5,4) on next turn, but (5,4) may be free.\n\nTurn 29: to (4,4)\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), seg1 to (4,5), seg2 to (5,5), etc., down to tail.\n\n(5,4) is free.\n\nTurn 30: move to (5,4) from (4,4) — that's right, so to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 31: from (5,4) to (5,3) or (6,4) but (6,4) wall, so to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 32: to (5,2)\n\nTurn 33: to (6,2) — too late.\n\nIf from (4,4) I go down to (4,3), etc., not helping.\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,2) from left path by turn 31.\n\nTherefore, to eat (6,2), I must be on a path from the bottom, so moving down on turn 28 is better.\n\nMoreover, after eating (6,2), I can go to other food.\n\nNow, for (3,1) and (1,4), I have time.\n\nAlso, moving down might be safer, as the area below might have more space.\n\nCurrent snake positions: the body is mostly on the top-right, at y=6 and y=5.\n\nMoving down to y=4 and below might be open.\n\nNow, the grid: let's think about available space.\n\nFor example, the bottom-left area: y=1,2,3 x=1,2,3, but obstacles at (2,4) and (1,2), (5,1), etc.\n\n(2,4) obstacle, (1,2) obstacle.\n\nBut (3,1) is food.\n\n(1,4) food.\n\nAfter going to (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), then eat (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nThen on turn 31, after eating, snake grows, so positions: when head moves to (6,2) and eats, new segment added, so tail doesn't move.\n\nBut let's not sequence that far.\n\nFor turn 28, I think moving down is good.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence starting from turn 28.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, I can outline a plan.\n\nTurn 28: move down to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 29: from (5,4), I need to move, I can move down to (5,3) or left to (4,4).\n\nTo reach (6,2) by turn 31, I should go down.\n\nTurn 29: move down to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 30: move down to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 31: move right to (6,2) to eat.\n\nNow, on turn 31, after eating, head at (6,2), and snake longer.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other food, like (3,1) or (1,4).\n\nBut (3,1) is at (3,1), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move left to (5,2), but (5,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 31, let's see positions.\n\nFirst, sequence:\n\nTurn 28: move D to (5,4)\n\nAfter: head (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\nTurn 29: move D to (5,3)\n\nAfter: head (5,3), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,6), seg4 (4,6), seg5 (3,6), seg6 (2,6), tail (2,5) moved to (2,6)? Positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)  // tail at (2,6)\n\nTurn 30: move D to (5,2)\n\nAfter: head (5,2), seg1 (5,3), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (5,6), seg5 (4,6), seg6 (3,6), tail (2,6) moved to (3,6)? Head to (5,2), seg1 to (5,3), seg2 to (5,4), seg3 to (5,5), seg4 to (5,6), seg5 to (4,6), seg6 to (3,6), and tail from (2,6) to old seg6 position? After turn 29, tail was at (2,6), which is seg6.\n\nAfter move to (5,2): new head (5,2), seg1 to old head (5,3), seg2 to old seg1 (5,4), ..., up to seg6 to old seg5 (4,6), and the last segment (old seg6) moves to old seg5 position? Better: the body segments shift.\n\nNew positions: index 0: head (5,2)\n\n1: (5,3)  // old head\n\n2: (5,4)  // old seg1\n\n3: (5,5)  // old seg2\n\n4: (5,6)  // old seg3\n\n5: (4,6)  // old seg4\n\n6: (3,6)  // old seg5\n\nAnd old seg6 was (3,6)? After turn 29, positions: 0:(5,3), 1:(5,4), 2:(5,5), 3:(5,6), 4:(4,6), 5:(3,6), 6:(2,6)\n\nAfter move to (5,2): new 0:(5,2), 1: old 0 (5,3), 2: old 1 (5,4), 3: old 2 (5,5), 4: old 3 (5,6), 5: old 4 (4,6), 6: old 5 (3,6), and old 6 (2,6) is gone, since tail moved.\n\nSo positions: head (5,2), body: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)  // tail at (3,6)\n\nNow, turn 31: move R to (6,2)\n\n(6,2) is food, so eat, snake grows, so new head at (6,2), and tail does not move, so new segment added at head.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (6,2), eats food, so the body: the segment that was at (5,2) becomes new body, but since growth, the tail stays.\n\nSo positions: head (6,2), then the previous body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)  // so now 8 segments, tail at (3,6)\n\nNow, from here, I can go to other food.\n\nFor example, (3,1) at (3,1), which is left and down.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move left to (5,2), but (5,2) is now occupied by body? In positions, (5,2) is the first body segment, so moving to (5,2) would collide.\n\nMove down to (6,1), but (6,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\nMove up to (6,3), but (6,3) might be free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n(6,3) is not obstacle, not border.\n\nObstacles: (6,1) and (6,4), but (6,3) is between, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, move right to (7,2) but x=7 wall.\n\nSo from (6,2), possible moves: left to (5,2) but occupied, down to (6,1) wall, right wall, so only up to (6,3) or... up to (6,3) is possible.\n\n(6,3) is free.\n\nSo must move up to (6,3).\n\nThen from there, I can go left, etc.\n\nBut (3,1) is at (3,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nAlso, (1,4) at (1,4).\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nFirst, for the immediate turns, to eat (6,2), moving down on turn 28 is good.\n\nIf I move left on turn 28 to (4,5), I can go to (3,5) then down to (3,4), etc., to eat (3,1) later.\n\nBut (3,1) has longer life, so I can eat it later, but (6,2) will be missed.\n\nSo better to go for (6,2) now.\n\nAlso, after eating, I have more options.\n\nMoreover, moving down avoids the body area.\n\nAnother risk: when I move to (5,4), etc., it should be fine.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I can output:\n\nTurn 28: D\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nTurn 31: R\n\nBut I need to specify for turn 28,29,30,31.\n\nTurn 31 is eating.\n\nBut after that, I need to survive and eat more.\n\nBut for the answer, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output about 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 28, so up to turn 32 or 33.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAfter turn 31, head at (6,2), then I must move up to (6,3) on turn 32.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can move left to (5,3) or up to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, so only left to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is occupied? After turn 31, positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\nSo (5,3) is occupied by body segment.\n\nIf I move to (5,3) on turn 32, collision.\n\nFrom (6,3), move to (5,3)? (5,3) is adjacent, but occupied.\n\nMove up to (6,4) but wall.\n\nNo other moves, so only left to (5,3), but occupied, death.\n\nProblem!\n\nAfter eating at (6,2), the body is at (5,2), (5,3), etc., so from (6,2), moving to (6,3) is ok on turn 32? Turn 32 move.\n\nAfter turn 31, head at (6,2), positions: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\nOn turn 32, I need to move from (6,2).\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1) but wall, L to (5,2) but (5,2) occupied, R to (7,2) wall.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is free? Not occupied, not wall, so yes.\n\nMove to (6,3): head to (6,3), then body: since no eat, tail moves.\n\nNew head (6,3), seg1 to (6,2), seg2 to (5,2), seg3 to (5,3), ..., up to tail.\n\nOld positions: 0:(6,2), 1:(5,2), 2:(5,3), 3:(5,4), 4:(5,5), 5:(5,6), 6:(4,6), 7:(3,6)  // 8 segments\n\nAfter move to (6,3): new head (6,3), then 1: old 0 (6,2), 2: old 1 (5,2), 3: old 2 (5,3), 4: old 3 (5,4), 5: old 4 (5,5), 6: old 5 (5,6), 7: old 6 (4,6), and old 7 (3,6) moves to old 6 position? New tail at (4,6).\n\nPositions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)  // tail at (4,6)\n\n(5,3) is still occupied, but when I move to (6,3), it's free.\n\nFrom (6,3), on next turn, I can move left to (5,3), but (5,3) is now occupied by body seg3, so moving to (5,3) would collide.\n\nMove up to (6,4) but obstacle.\n\nMove down to (6,2) but (6,2) is now occupied by seg1.\n\nMove right wall.\n\nSo only left to (5,3), but occupied, death on turn 33.\n\nOh no, so this path leads to death because I'm trapped after eating (6,2).\n\nTherefore, moving down to eat (6,2) is not good; I get stuck.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I should not go for (6,2) directly, or choose a different path.\n\nMaybe from (5,4), instead of going straight down, I go left or something to have space.\n\nFor example, on turn 28 move down to (5,4), then on turn 29 move left to (4,4), then from there I can go down or left.\n\nBut then I might not reach (6,2) in time.\n\n(6,2) expires soon, so if I don't go directly, I miss it.\n\nBut going directly kills me later.\n\nPerhaps after eating, I can go up to (6,3) and then to (5,3) but (5,3) occupied, same issue.\n\nUnless I have a way to escape.\n\nBut in this case, the body is blocking the left side.\n\nMaybe I should not eat (6,2) at all, and go for other food.\n\nBut (6,2) is positive food, and I can eat it, but I die after, so not worth.\n\nLong-term survival is priority.\n\nSo better to avoid this and go for other food.\n\nThus, moving left on turn 28 might be better.\n\nTurn 28: move L to (4,5)\n\nThen positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\nNow, from (4,5), I can move down to (4,4) or left to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is free, as before.\n\nSay I move left to (3,5) on turn 29.\n\nThen to (3,4) on turn 30, etc.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), so I can go down to eat it.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 28: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 29: L to (3,5)  // left from (4,5) to (3,5)\n\nTurn 30: D to (3,4)  // down from (3,5) to (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is free? Not occupied, not wall. Obstacle at (2,4), but (3,4) not.\n\nThen turn 31: D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 32: D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 33: D to (3,1) to eat.\n\n(3,1) life span 7, present until t34, so on turn 33 I can eat it, fine.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (1,4) or other.\n\nAlso, from (3,5), I could go to (3,4) earlier, but same.\n\nNow, is this safe?\n\nAfter turn 28 move to (4,5): positions (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\nTurn 29 move to (3,5): head (3,5), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,6), seg4 (4,6), seg5 (3,6), seg6 (2,6), tail to (2,5) moved to (2,6)? New tail at (2,6)\n\nPositions: head (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n\nTurn 30 move to (3,4): head to (3,4), seg1 to (3,5), seg2 to (4,5), seg3 to (5,5), seg4 to (5,6), seg5 to (4,6), seg6 to (3,6), tail to (2,6) moved to (3,6)? New positions: head (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)  // tail at (3,6)\n\nTurn 31 move to (3,3): head to (3,3), seg1 to (3,4), etc., down to tail.\n\n(3,3) free? Yes.\n\nThen turn 32 to (3,2), turn 33 to (3,1) eat.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (3,1), (3,1) is food.\n\nNow, after eating at (3,1), head at (3,1), grow, then I can move to other places, like to (4,1) or (2,1), etc., but (2,1) might be free, or up to (3,2) but occupied after move.\n\nBut I can go left or right.\n\nAlso, there is (1,4) food.\n\nBut I need to output sequence for turn 28 to, say, turn 32 or so.\n\nFor turn 28, moving left seems better to avoid the trap.\n\nMoreover, I can eat (3,1) soon.\n\nBut (6,2) will be missed, but it's better than dying.\n\nAnother food: (1,4) at (1,4), I can go after (3,1).\n\nFor example, from (3,1), I can go to (2,1), (1,1), then up to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, so to (1,3), (1,4).\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so from (1,1) to (1,2) not possible, so go to (2,2), (1,2) not, so to (1,3) from (2,3) or something.\n\nBut not immediate.\n\nSince I need to output actions, for turn 28, I think L is good.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn 28: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 29: from (4,5), move to (3,5) or (4,4)\n\nIf I move to (3,5) as above.\n\nThen turn 30: to (3,4)\n\nTurn 31: to (3,3)\n\nTurn 32: to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 33: to (3,1) but I may not need to output that far.\n\nFor the answer, I can output up to turn 32.\n\nBut let's see the head direction.\n\nOn turn 28, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5), so new direction left.\n\nThen on turn 29, from (4,5), moving to (3,5) is left again, or to (4,4) down.\n\nIf I move left to (3,5), direction left.\n\nThen turn 30 to (3,4) down, etc.\n\nAll fine.\n\nTo have variety, but not necessary.\n\nI think for now, moving left on turn 28 is safer.\n\nAnd I can eat (3,1) in a few turns.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: L (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 30: D (to (3,4))\n\nThen turn 31: D (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 32: D (to (3,2))\n\nThen later to (3,1).\n\nBut for answer, since 5+ turns, I can output 5 actions: turn 28 to 32.\n\nTurn 28,29,30,31,32.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, on turn 32, head at (3,2), then to (3,1) on turn 33.\n\nBut I don't have to output turn 33.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be consistent.\n\nAnother thing: when moving to (3,4) on turn 30, (3,4) is not food, but there is obstacle at (2,4), but not affecting.\n\nAlso, no tail risk.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- The food at (1,5) is impossible to reach before it disappears after turn 29 due to its short life span (2 at turn 28) and the distance from the snake head (5,5).\n- The food at (6,2) can be reached by turn 31, but attempting to eat it leads to a trap and certain death on turn 33 due to body collisions, as the snake would be blocked after eating. Thus, avoiding this food is safer for survival.\n- The food at (3,1) is valuable with a long life span (7 at turn 28), allowing time to reach it safely. Moving left initially positions the snake to eat (3,1) by turn 33.\n- The food at (1,4) has a very long life span (10 at turn 28), so it can be targeted after eating (3,1) without immediate risk.\n- Moving right on turn 28 is suicidal, as it forces a move to (6,6) on turn 29, leading to no valid moves and death. Thus, only down or left are viable on turn 28, but down leads to the (6,2) trap, so left is chosen for better long-term prospects.\n- The planned sequence avoids collisions, walls, and internal obstacles while progressing toward (3,1). After turn 32, the snake can continue to (3,1) on turn 33 to eat it and then navigate toward (1,4).\n\n**Planned Move Sequence (Turns 28 to 32):**\n- **Turn 28: L (left)** to (4,5). This moves the head left, avoiding the risky path to (6,2) and starting the path toward (3,1). Direction becomes left.\n- **Turn 29: L (left)** to (3,5). Continuing left brings the head closer to (3,1) and avoids body collisions. Direction remains left.\n- **Turn 30: D (down)** to (3,4). Moving down positions the head for the descent to (3,1). Direction becomes down.\n- **Turn 31: D (down)** to (3,3). Further descent toward (3,1), with (3,3) being safe and unoccupied. Direction remains down.\n- **Turn 32: D (down)** to (3,2). Final move in this sequence to approach (3,1); eating (3,1) can occur on turn 33. Direction remains down.\n\nThis sequence ensures survival for at least 5 turns, eats high-value food (3,1) soon after, and sets up for future food collection. After turn 32, the snake should move down to (3,1) on turn 33 to eat it, then navigate to (1,4) via a safe path (e.g., left to (2,2) or (2,1), then to (1,1), and up to (1,3) and (1,4), avoiding the obstacle at (1,2)).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 29: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 30: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 31: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 32: D (down)\n}",

        "step": 29,
        "score": 6,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 29. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls on the borders. There are also internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So I should avoid those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,5), then body segments at (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), and tail at (2,5). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (4,5) from (5,5), I assume. Since head direction is L, and positions show head at (4,5) with previous at (5,5), which is to the right, so moving left makes sense.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,5) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (6,2) with value 1, life span 3\n\n- (3,1) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (1,4) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned here.\n\nLife span: for (1,5), life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten. Countdown decreases every turn, including current turn. So on turn 29, if not eaten, it will be gone by turn 30? Life span decreases each turn, including the current one, so if life span is 1 on turn 29, after turn 29, it should be gone, meaning it can only be eaten on turn 29 or not at all.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life span is L on turn T, it will disappear after turn T + L - 1? I need to clarify.\n\nIt says: \"life_span\" is given, and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor example, if life_span is 1 on turn T, then on turn T, it is present, but after turn T, it disappears, so it can only be eaten on turn T.\n\nSimilarly, if life_span is 2, it is present on turn T and T+1, disappears after T+1.\n\nIn this case, for (1,5): life span 1 on turn 29, so if not eaten on turn 29, it disappears forever.\n\nFor (6,2): life span 3, so present on turn 29, 30, 31, disappears after turn 31.\n\n(3,1): life span 6, present turns 29 to 34.\n\n(1,4): life span 9, present turns 29 to 37.\n\nAll food is positive, value 1, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n\nNow, snake head is at (4,5), direction left. Possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So from left, I cannot go right.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,5)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Left (L): to (3,5)\n\n- Up (U): to (4,6)\n\n- Down (D): to (4,4)\n\nNow, I need to check if these cells are safe: not wall, not body, except tail might be movable.\n\nFirst, walls: borders are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(3,5): x=3, y=5. Is this a wall? Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. (3,5) is within 1-6 in x and y? Grid from 0 to 7, so x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. So cells like (3,5) should be free, but need to check internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). None of these are (3,5), so (3,5) should be free.\n\nBut is it occupied by snake body? Snake positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]\n\nSo (3,5) is not in this list. (3,6) is there, but (3,5) is different.\n\n(3,5) is empty? Let's list all snake positions:\n\n- (4,5) head\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,6)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (2,5) tail\n\nSo cells occupied: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n\n(3,5) is not occupied, and not a wall, so moving left to (3,5) is possible.\n\nUp to (4,6): (4,6) is occupied by a body segment. Snake has (4,6) as the fourth segment? Positions: index 0: (4,5) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (2,6), 6: (2,5)\n\nSo (4,6) is position 3, a body segment. Moving to (4,6) would be head colliding with body, which is deadly. Unless it's the tail, but (4,6) is not the tail; tail is (2,5). So (4,6) is a body segment, so moving there causes collision.\n\nDown to (4,4): (4,4) - is this a wall? x=4, y=4. Borders: x=0,7 and y=0,7 walls. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is an obstacle, but (4,4) is not listed. So (4,4) should be free. Snake positions don't have (4,4), so it should be safe to move down.\n\nBut (4,4) is not occupied by snake, yes.\n\nNow, also, there might be food on (4,4)? Food positions: (1,5), (6,2), (3,1), (1,4). No (4,4), so no food there.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,5):\n\n- L to (3,5): empty cell, no food\n\n- U to (4,6): occupied by body, deadly\n\n- D to (4,4): empty, no food\n\nU is deadly, so only L and D are safe moves.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,5) with life span 1, meaning it must be eaten this turn or lost.\n\n(1,5) is at x=1,y=5.\n\nCurrent head at (4,5), same y=5.\n\nTo reach (1,5) from (4,5), I need to move left three times: to (3,5), then (2,5), then (1,5).\n\nBut (2,5) is currently the tail position.\n\nSnake positions: tail is (2,5).\n\nIf I move to (3,5) this turn, then next turn I could move to (2,5), but (2,5) is currently tail.\n\nWhen I move, the snake moves: head goes to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail moves away.\n\nSo if I move to (3,5) on turn 29, head to (3,5), then body: (5,5) moves to (4,5)? Let's simulate.\n\nAfter move on turn 29:\n\nSuppose I move L to (3,5).\n\nNew head position: (3,5)\n\nThen body: the segment that was at (5,5) moves to where head was, (4,5)? Standard snake movement: the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo positions: new head at (3,5)\n\nThen segment 1 (was (5,5)) moves to head old position (4,5)? No.\n\nList: before move: positions [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (3,5):\n\n- Head: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 1: move to where head was, (4,5)\n\n- Segment 2: move to where segment 1 was, (5,5)\n\n- Segment 3: move to where segment 2 was, (5,6)\n\n- Segment 4: move to where segment 3 was, (4,6)\n\n- Segment 5: move to where segment 4 was, (3,6)\n\n- Segment 6 (tail): move to where segment 5 was, (2,6)\n\nThe tail was at (2,5), but it moves to (2,6) because segment 5 was at (2,6), so tail moves to (2,6).\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n\nTail is now at (2,6).\n\nFood at (1,5) is still there, life span 1, but after turn 29, it disappears if not eaten.\n\nNow on turn 30, head at (3,5), direction? I moved left, so head direction is now L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,5)? (2,5) is currently empty? After move, positions are (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n\nSo (2,5) is free? (2,5) is not occupied, and not wall.\n\n(2,5): walls? x=2, y=5, not border, internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\nFood at (1,5) is present only if eaten on turn 29, but we didn't eat it, so on turn 30, it should be gone because life span 1 on turn 29 means it disappears after turn 29.\n\nLife span: on turn 29, life span 1, so after turn 29, it is gone. So on turn 30, (1,5) has no food.\n\nBut let's confirm the timing.\n\nTurn 29: food (1,5) is present with life span 1.\n\nIf head moves to (1,5) on turn 29, it is eaten.\n\nIf not, after turn 29, it disappears.\n\nSince head is at (4,5) on turn 29, and (1,5) is three steps away, I can't reach it this turn. So (1,5) will disappear and cannot be eaten. So it's lost.\n\nTherefore, I should not bother with (1,5); it's impossible to get.\n\nNow, other food: (6,2), (3,1), (1,4)\n\n(6,2) life span 3, so present turns 29,30,31.\n\n(3,1) life span 6, turns 29 to 34.\n\n(1,4) life span 9, turns 29 to 37.\n\nNow, back to current turn, turn 29, head at (4,5), possible safe moves: L to (3,5) or D to (4,4)\n\nU is to (4,6) which is body, deadly.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving L to (3,5).\n\nAfter move: head at (3,5), body as above, tail at (2,6)\n\nDirection left.\n\nNow turn 30: head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4)\n\n(2,5): is it safe? After previous move, positions: head (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n\n(2,5) not occupied, not wall (internal obstacle at (2,4), but (2,5) ok), so (2,5) is free.\n\n(3,6) is occupied by body (segment 5? positions: index 0: (3,5) head, 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (2,6) tail)\n\nSo (3,6) is segment 5, body, so moving U to (3,6) would collide.\n\nD to (3,4): (3,4) - walls? Internal obstacle at (2,4), but (3,4) not listed. Borders ok. Snake? Not occupied, so free.\n\nFood? No food at (3,4) or (2,5), etc.\n\nOn turn 30, food: (6,2) still there, (3,1), (1,4)\n\n(1,5) gone.\n\nNow, from (3,5), if I move L to (2,5), then head to (2,5)\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) and tail moves to (2,6)? Segment 6 was at (2,6), moves to where segment 5 was, (3,6)? Let's see:\n\nAfter head to (2,5):\n\n- Head: (2,5)\n\n- Seg1: to old head (3,5)\n\n- Seg2: to old seg1 (4,5)\n\n- Seg3: to old seg2 (5,5)\n\n- Seg4: to old seg3 (5,6)\n\n- Seg5: to old seg4 (4,6)\n\n- Seg6: to old seg5 (3,6)\n\nTail was seg6 at (2,6), but now it moves to (3,6), so (2,6) is vacated.\n\nBut (2,6) had no food, I think.\n\nFood at (1,4) is at (1,4), which is close.\n\n(2,5) to (1,5) but (1,5) is gone, or to (1,4) down.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nIf on turn 30 I move D to (3,4) from (3,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to plan to get food.\n\nAnother option: on turn 29, move down to (4,4).\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction? I moved down, so direction D.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), then seg1 to (4,5), seg2 to (5,5), seg3 to (5,6), seg4 to (4,6), seg5 to (3,6), seg6 to (2,6), tail to (2,5)? Seg6 was at (2,5), moves to old seg5 position (2,6)? Positions before move: [ (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) ]\n\nAfter move down to (4,4):\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n\n- Seg1: to (4,5)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: to (5,5)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: to (5,6)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: to (4,6)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: to (3,6)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: to (2,6)  // old seg5\n\n- Tail seg7: to (2,5)  // old seg6, but seg6 was at (2,5)? Old seg6 position is (2,5), but in the list, seg6 is at (2,5), which is position 6.\n\nAfter head moves, seg1 moves to position of old head, which was (4,5)\n\nThen seg2 moves to position of old seg1, which was (5,5)\n\nSeg3 to old seg2 position (5,6)\n\nSeg4 to old seg3 position (4,6)? Old seg3 was at (4,6)? Positions: index 3 is (4,6), yes.\n\nOld seg4 at (3,6)\n\nOld seg5 at (2,6)\n\nOld seg6 at (2,5)\n\nSo after head to (4,4):\n\n- New head: (4,4)\n\n- New seg1: (4,5)  // from old head\n\n- New seg2: (5,5)  // from old seg1\n\n- New seg3: (5,6)  // from old seg2\n\n- New seg4: (4,6)  // from old seg3\n\n- New seg5: (3,6)  // from old seg4\n\n- New seg6: (2,6)  // from old seg5\n\n- New tail: (2,5)  // from old seg6\n\nOld seg6 was at (2,5), so new tail is at (2,5), but it's the same cell? No, new tail is at (2,5), which was old seg6 position, but since the snake moved, it's occupied.\n\nBut cell (2,5) is still occupied, but by the tail now.\n\nIn terms of cells, (2,5) has the tail.\n\nNow, food at (1,5) is lost.\n\nOn turn 30, head at (4,4), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: since moved down, I can move D, L, R, but not U (up, opposite).\n\nU would be to (4,5), but (4,5) is now occupied by seg1, so body collision.\n\nD to (4,3): down, y-1, to (4,3)\n\nL to (3,4): left\n\nR to (5,4): right\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n(4,3): x=4,y=3, not wall, not occupied? Positions: head (4,4), seg1 (4,5), etc., (4,3) free? Assuming no obstacle, internal obstacles don't include (4,3), so free.\n\n(3,4): x=3,y=4, internal obstacle at (2,4), but (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\n(5,4): x=5,y=4, not wall, internal obstacles: (5,1) and (6,4), etc., (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\nBut (5,4) might be close to body or something.\n\nNo food at these cells yet.\n\nBut I need to think about getting to food.\n\nFood at (6,2): (6,2), but (6,2) is near wall? x=6,y=2.\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), (6,1), but (6,2) not listed, so it should be free, but is it a wall? Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,2) is within, not border wall. Internal obstacles are specific cells, so (6,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) at x=3,y=1, y=1, not y=0, so not border, internal obstacle at (5,1), but (3,1) not listed, so free.\n\n(1,4) at x=1,y=4, internal obstacle at (1,2), but (1,4) not listed, so free.\n\nNow, life span: (6,2) life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 31 at latest.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) has more time.\n\n(1,4) has plenty of time.\n\nBut (6,2) is at (6,2), which is on the bottom row, y=2.\n\nHead at (4,5), so to reach (6,2), I need to go right and down.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is at (3,1), left and down.\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), left.\n\nBut with internal obstacles.\n\nAlso, the snake body is coiled, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, let's outline a plan.\n\nFirst, on turn 29, I have two choices: L to (3,5) or D to (4,4).\n\nIf I go L to (3,5), I can then go to (2,5) or (3,4), etc., and (1,4) is a target.\n\nIf I go D to (4,4), I can head towards (3,1) or (6,2).\n\n(6,2) has short life span, only 3 turns including this one, so I need to eat it soon.\n\nDistance from (4,5) to (6,2): Δx=2, Δy=3, so Manhattan distance 5, but I can move one step per turn, so minimum 5 turns? But I can move diagonally? No, only orthogonal moves, one cell at a time.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (6,2): I need to move right twice and down three times, or down twice and right twice, etc., but since moves are sequential, it takes at least 5 moves to cover |Δx| + |Δy| = 2 + 3 = 5 cells.\n\nBut on turn 29, if I move, I can be closer.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), if I move down to (4,4), then to (6,2) is |4-6| + |4-2| = 2+2=4 moves away, but after turn 29, head at (4,4), then on turn 30 to 33, but life span of (6,2) is 3, meaning it disappears after turn 31? Let's clarify life span.\n\nLife span N on turn T means it is present on turns T, T+1, ..., T+N-1, and disappears after turn T+N-1.\n\nSo for (6,2), life span 3 on turn 29, so present on turn 29, 30, 31. Disappears after turn 31, so must be eaten on or before turn 31.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 29, it can be eaten if head there.\n\nBut head at (4,5), not (6,2).\n\nAfter turn 29, if I move, say to (4,4), then on turn 30 head at (4,4), to (6,2) is min 4 moves: e.g., (4,4) to (5,4) to (6,4) but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot go there.\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), so (6,4) is blocked.\n\nAlso (6,1) blocked.\n\n(6,2) is not blocked, but to reach (6,2), I need to approach from left or above or below.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible paths to (6,2):\n\n- Right to (5,4), then down to (5,3), then down to (5,2), then right to (6,2)? But (5,2) to (6,2) is possible? (5,2) and (6,2), but (6,2) is the target.\n\nBut from (5,2) to (6,2) is one move.\n\nBut (5,2) is free? No internal obstacle, not border.\n\nBut let's see if occupied.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,4) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) but (6,3) is free? Then to (6,2), but (6,3) to (6,2) down.\n\nBut (6,3) is free, I think.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), but (6,3) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) free.\n\nBut from (4,4) to (6,2), the shortest path might be via (5,4) but (5,4) to (6,4) is blocked, so cannot go directly right from (5,4) to (6,4).\n\nSo from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), then to (6,3) or (5,2), etc.\n\nFor example: from (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,2) or to (5,2) to (6,2).\n\nThat's 4 moves: to (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2) or (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2).\n\nBoth 4 moves.\n\nFrom (4,4) directly down to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (6,3), then to (6,2) or to (5,2) to (6,2).\n\nSame 4 moves.\n\nBut (6,2) must be eaten by turn 31.\n\nIf on turn 29 I move to (4,4), head at (4,4) on turn 30? Turn 29 action: move to (4,4), so after turn 29, head at (4,4) for turn 30.\n\nThen on turn 30, I can move towards (6,2).\n\nFor example, move right to (5,4) on turn 30.\n\nThen on turn 31, from (5,4), I can move down to (5,3), but then (6,2) is still two moves away? From (5,3) to (5,2) to (6,2) or to (6,3) to (6,2).\n\nOn turn 31, if I am at (5,3), I can move to (6,3) or (5,2), but not directly to (6,2) in one move.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move right to (6,3) or down to (5,2).\n\nThen on turn 32, from (6,3) move down to (6,2), or from (5,2) move right to (6,2).\n\nBut turn 32 is after turn 31, and (6,2) disappears after turn 31, so on turn 32 it is gone. So I must eat it on or before turn 31.\n\nIf on turn 31 I am at (5,3), I cannot reach (6,2) in one move; (6,2) is adjacent to (5,2), (6,3), (6,1) but (6,1) obstacle, or (7,2) but x=7 wall, so only (5,2) and (6,3).\n\nSo from (5,3), I can go to (6,3) or (5,2), neither is (6,2), so I need two moves to reach (6,2) from (5,3): e.g., to (6,3) then to (6,2), but on turn 32, which is too late.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,2) then to (6,2) on turn 32.\n\nBut turn 31 is the last chance to eat (6,2).\n\nOn turn 31, I need to be at (6,2) to eat it.\n\nSo from where I am on turn 30, I need to be able to reach (6,2) in one move on turn 31.\n\nThat means on turn 31, head must be adjacent to (6,2) so that I can move to it.\n\nAdjacent cells: (5,2), (6,3), (6,1) but (6,1) obstacle, (7,2) wall, so only (5,2) and (6,3).\n\nSo on turn 31, I need to be at (5,2) or (6,3) to move to (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nNow, back to turn 30.\n\nIf on turn 29 I move down to (4,4), then on turn 30 head at (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 30, I can move to (5,4), or (4,3), or (3,4).\n\nTo reach (5,2) or (6,3) by turn 31.\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (5,2): |4-5| + |4-2| =1+2=3 moves, too far.\n\nSimilarly to (6,3): |4-6| + |4-3| =2+1=3 moves.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 30, it takes at least 3 moves to reach (5,2) or (6,3), so I can be there on turn 33, too late for turn 31.\n\nFor example, to (5,2): (4,4) to (5,4) turn 30, to (5,3) turn 31, to (5,2) turn 32.\n\nOr to (4,3) turn 30, to (5,3) turn 31, to (5,2) turn 32.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,3): (4,4) to (5,4) to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, not possible.\n\n(4,4) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) turn 32.\n\nOr to (5,4) to (5,3) to (6,3) turn 32? From (5,3) to (6,3) on turn 31 if I move right.\n\nBut on turn 30 from (4,4) to (5,4), then turn 31 to (6,3)? From (5,4) to (6,3) is diagonal, not possible; only orthogonal moves. So from (5,4) I can go to (5,3) or (6,4) but (6,4) blocked, or (5,5) but (5,5) may be occupied.\n\nOn turn 30, after turn 29 move to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,6), etc., so (5,5) is occupied.\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves: down to (5,3), left to (4,4) but (4,4) is head? No, when moving, the cell is vacated except for new position.\n\nOn turn 30, head at (4,4), so (4,4) is occupied by head.\n\nFrom (4,4), moving to (5,4): (5,4) is free, I think.\n\nThen after moving to (5,4) on turn 30, head at (5,4), then I can move down to (5,3) on turn 31.\n\nBut (5,3) is not (5,2) or (6,3); from (5,3) I can move down to (5,2) on turn 32, or right to (6,3) on turn 32.\n\nBut on turn 31, I am at (5,3), not adjacent to (6,2), so I cannot reach (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nIf on turn 30 from (4,4) I move down to (4,3), then on turn 31 to (5,3), still not adjacent.\n\nOr to (4,2), but (4,2) is free? Then to (5,2) on turn 31, but (5,2) is adjacent to (6,2), so if on turn 31 I am at (5,2), I can move to (6,2) on turn 31.\n\nBut to be at (5,2) on turn 31.\n\nFrom turn 30 head at (4,4), I need to reach (5,2) in one move? Impossible, |dy|=2.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (5,2) is not adjacent; adjacent are (4,3), (3,4), (5,4).\n\n(5,2) is at distance.\n\nShortest: (4,4) to (4,3) turn 30, then (4,3) to (5,3) turn 31, then to (5,2) turn 32.\n\nNo way to be at (5,2) on turn 31 from (4,4) on turn 30.\n\nSimilarly for (6,3): from (4,4) to (5,4) turn 30, to (5,3) turn 31, to (6,3) turn 32.\n\nOr to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) turn 32.\n\nCannot reach (5,2) or (6,3) by turn 31 from (4,4) on turn 30.\n\nTherefore, if I move down to (4,4) on turn 29, I cannot reach (6,2) by turn 31; it's impossible to eat it.\n\nBut (6,2) can be eaten on turn 29,30,31.\n\nOn turn 29, head at (4,5), not (6,2).\n\nOn turn 30, if I can be adjacent and move on turn 30 or 31.\n\nBut from (4,5), if I move differently on turn 29.\n\nFor example, if I move right? But head direction is L, left, and I cannot move opposite, so no right, only L, U, D, but U is deadly, so only L or D.\n\nD to (4,4) as above, cannot reach.\n\nL to (3,5) on turn 29.\n\nThen on turn 30 head at (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (6,2) is |3-6| + |5-2| =3+3=6 moves, even farther, no chance.\n\nSo from current position, it's impossible to eat (6,2) because it's too far and the life span is short.\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), head at (4,5), distance 5, and only 3 turns, but to eat on turn 31, I need to be adjacent on turn 30 or 31, but from turn 29, I can only move one step, so on turn 30 I am at (3,5) or (4,4), both far from (6,2), so no, I cannot reach (6,2) in time. It will disappear uneaten.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 29, if I could move right, but I can't because of direction constraint.\n\nSo (6,2) is unreachable and will be lost. Ignore it.\n\nNow, other food: (3,1) at (3,1), life span 6, so must be eaten by turn 34.\n\nAnd (1,4) at (1,4), life span 9, by turn 37.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,5) is lost as we saw.\n\nNow, let's focus on the snake and plan.\n\nCurrent head at (4,5), direction L.\n\nSafe moves: L to (3,5) or D to (4,4)\n\nIf I go L to (3,5), then I am closer to (1,4) and (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), (1,4) at (1,4).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go down to (3,4), then to (3,3), etc., to (3,1).\n\nOr left to (2,5), then to (1,5) but gone, or to (1,4) via (2,4) but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot go to (2,4).\n\nInternal obstacle at (2,4), so (2,4) is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (1,4), from (2,5) I can go down to (2,3)? But (2,5) to (1,5) gone or to (1,4), but (1,4) is at (1,4), adjacent to (1,3), (1,5), (2,4) but (2,4) blocked, (1,5) gone, so only from (1,3) or (2,4) blocked, so (1,4) can be accessed from (1,3) or (1,5), but (1,5) gone, or from above/below but y=4, so (1,3) or (1,5).\n\nSince (1,5) gone, only from (1,3) or from left but x=0 wall, so only (1,3) is adjacent.\n\n(1,4) has neighbors: (1,3), (1,5), (0,4) wall, (2,4) obstacle, so only (1,3) and (1,5) are possible, but (1,5) no food and gone, so to eat (1,4), I must approach from (1,3).\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) can be approached from (3,2), (2,1), (4,1), etc.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks, like dead ends or colliding with body.\n\nCurrent snake positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,5)\n\nThe area around (4,5) to (2,6) is occupied.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), head to (3,5), body to (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail to (2,6)\n\nThen on turn 30, from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5), U to (3,6) but (3,6) is body, deadly, or D to (3,4)\n\n(2,5) is free, as we saw.\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nIf I move to (2,5) on turn 30, then head to (2,5), body to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail to (2,6)? After moving, new tail at (3,6) or something.\n\nBut (2,5) is now head, and (1,4) is at (1,4), which is close.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move down to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nLeft to (1,5) but gone and no food.\n\nUp to (2,6) but (2,6) is body? On turn 30 after move.\n\nAfter turn 29 move to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail (2,6)\n\nSo (2,6) is tail.\n\nOn turn 30, move to (2,5): (2,5) is free, so head to (2,5), then body: seg1 to (3,5), seg2 to (4,5), seg3 to (5,5), seg4 to (5,6), seg5 to (4,6), seg6 to (3,6), tail to (2,6)? Old tail at (2,6), moves to old seg5 position (3,6)? New positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), and new tail at (2,6) from old tail position? Standard: after head moves to (2,5), each segment moves to previous segment position.\n\nSo new head (2,5)\n\nNew seg1 at old head (3,5)\n\nNew seg2 at old seg1 (4,5)\n\nNew seg3 at old seg2 (5,5)\n\nNew seg4 at old seg3 (5,6)\n\nNew seg5 at old seg4 (4,6)\n\nNew seg6 at old seg5 (3,6)\n\nNew tail at old seg6 (2,6)\n\nSo positions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n\nTail at (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is tail.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move down to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nLeft to (1,5) but gone, and cell (1,5) may be free but no food.\n\nUp to (2,6) but (2,6) is now the tail, but when I move, the tail will move, so moving to tail position is safe because the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (2,6) is safe because it's the tail.\n\nThen on turn 31, head to (2,6), and tail moves to (3,6) or something, no collision.\n\nBut (2,6) has no food, I think.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,6) or (2,7) but y=7 wall, or (3,6) but body.\n\n(1,6) is free? x=1,y=6, not border, internal obstacle at (1,2), not (1,6), so free.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nTo reach (1,4), I need to go down from (2,5) but (2,4) blocked, so I can't go directly.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can only move left to (1,5) or up to (2,6), since down to (2,4) blocked.\n\n(1,5) is gone, so only up to (2,6).\n\nThen on turn 31, head at (2,6), direction up (since moved from (2,5) to (2,6), so direction U.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can move U to (2,7) but y=7 wall, deadly.\n\nL to (1,6), or D to (2,5), but (2,5) is now body, not tail.\n\nAfter moving to (2,6) on turn 30, positions: head (2,6), body (2,5)? Let's see.\n\nOn turn 30, after moving to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is tail.\n\nIf on turn 30 I move U to (2,6), which is tail, so safe.\n\nHead to (2,6), then body: seg1 to (2,5), seg2 to (3,5), seg3 to (4,5), seg4 to (5,5), seg5 to (5,6), seg6 to (4,6), tail to (3,6)\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nOn turn 31, head at (2,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,7) but y=7 wall, collision.\n\nD to (2,5) but (2,5) is now body (seg1), so collision.\n\nL to (1,6), or R to (3,6) but (3,6) is tail, so safe.\n\n(3,6) is tail, so moving to (3,6) is safe.\n\nL to (1,6): (1,6) free.\n\nSo from (2,6), I can move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\n(1,6) is free, no food.\n\nThen from (1,6), I can move down to (1,5) but gone, or to (1,4) down, since (1,5) free but no food.\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), so from (1,6) to (1,5) to (1,4), but (1,5) no food, (1,4) has food.\n\nBut it takes moves.\n\nBut let's go back to turn 29 choice.\n\nPerhaps on turn 29, moving down to (4,4) is better to go towards (3,1).\n\n(3,1) at (3,1), life span 6, so time.\n\nHead at (4,5), move D to (4,4) on turn 29.\n\nThen on turn 30, head at (4,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nAll should be free.\n\n(4,3): free\n\n(3,4): free, but internal obstacle at (2,4), not (3,4)\n\n(5,4): free\n\nNo food there.\n\nThen I can move towards (3,1).\n\nFor example, move L to (3,4) on turn 30.\n\nHead to (3,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen on turn 31, from (3,4), move L to (2,4) but (2,4) is internal obstacle, cannot.\n\nU to (3,5) but (3,5) may be body, D to (3,3), R to (4,4) but may be body.\n\nAfter turn 30 move to (3,4), positions: from turn 29 down to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,5)\n\nOn turn 30 move to (3,4): head to (3,4), then body seg1 to (4,4), seg2 to (4,5), seg3 to (5,5), seg4 to (5,6), seg5 to (4,6), seg6 to (3,6), tail to (2,6)\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail (2,6)\n\nOn turn 31, head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, deadly.\n\nU to (3,5) but (3,5) is now occupied by seg2? Positions: (3,4) head, (4,4) seg1, (4,5) seg2, so (3,5) is free? Not occupied, so U to (3,5) is possible.\n\nD to (3,3), R to (4,4) but (4,4) is seg1, body, deadly.\n\nSo only U to (3,5) or D to (3,3).\n\n(3,5) is free, no food.\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nThen I can go down to (3,3), then to (3,2), to (3,1), etc.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), so from (3,4) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1), three moves down.\n\nLife span 6, so on turn 29 to 34, so I can eat it by turn 34.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) can be targeted later.\n\nBut I need to consider the map and obstacles.\n\nAlso, there is a risk of trapping or colliding.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,4) might be under the snake or something, but not currently.\n\n(1,4) is free.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat food when possible, but with long-term survival.\n\nSince (6,2) is lost, and (1,5) lost, I have (3,1) and (1,4).\n\n(3,1) is closer to current position.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (3,1): |4-3| + |5-1| =1+4=5 moves min.\n\nFrom (4,4) after move down, 4 moves min.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might take more.\n\nAlso, the snake body might block.\n\nPerhaps moving down on turn 29 is better to go down.\n\nBut let's consider the initial move.\n\nOn turn 29, if I move L to (3,5), I can then move D to (3,4) on turn 30, then to (3,3), etc., to (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,5) move D to (3,4) on turn 30.\n\nThen on turn 31 to (3,3), turn 32 to (3,2), turn 33 to (3,1), which is within life span to 34.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D on turn 29 to (4,4), then to (3,4) on turn 30, but (3,4) to (3,3) on turn 31, etc., same thing.\n\nBut from (4,4), I can go to (4,3) then to (3,3) or something.\n\nBut similar.\n\nAlso, (1,4) is at (1,4), which I can go to after.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has food, eating it kills because the new tail grows and collides.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (2,5), head at (4,5), not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y difference 1.\n\n(4,5) and (2,5) have |dx|=2, not adjacent.\n\nAfter moves, it might be.\n\nBut for now, no issue.\n\nI think for turn 29, both moves are possible, but moving down to (4,4) might open more space, while moving left to (3,5) might lead to a tighter spot.\n\nLet's think about the grid size 8x8 with obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo the left side has obstacles at (2,4) and (1,2), so moving left might be constrained.\n\nFor example, to reach (1,4), I need to go via (1,3) or (1,5) but (1,5) gone, so (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is free, I think.\n\nFrom current position, if I go down to (4,4), I can then go to (3,4), but (3,4) to (3,3), then to (2,3) or (3,2), etc.\n\n(2,3) is free? Then to (1,3), then to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) from (1,3).\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,3) is accessible.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,1), I can go directly down.\n\nSince (3,1) has shorter life span relatively, 6 vs 9 for (1,4), but both have time, so I can go for (3,1) first.\n\nLife span 6 on turn 29, so must eat by turn 34, 6 turns including turn 29, so turns 29 to 34.\n\nFrom head at (4,5), to (3,1) min 5 moves, so possible.\n\nSimilarly for (1,4), min |4-1| + |5-4| =3+1=4 moves, but with obstacles, more.\n\nBut let's decide on turn 29 move.\n\nI think moving down to (4,4) is better because it moves away from the body cluster.\n\nIf I move left to (3,5), I am still near the body.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,4), the snake is more spread.\n\nPositions after move down: head (4,4), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,5)\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nThen I can move, say, down to (4,3) or left to (3,4), etc.\n\nTo go to (3,1), I can move down to (4,3) on turn 30, then to (4,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\n(4,3) to (4,2) to (4,1) to (3,1), but (4,1) to (3,1) is possible.\n\nOr from (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is free? Internal obstacle at (5,1), not (4,1), so free.\n\nBut (5,1) obstacle, so (4,1) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) free.\n\nSo from (4,4) move D to (4,3) on turn 30, then D to (4,2) on turn 31, then D to (4,1) on turn 32, then L to (3,1) on turn 33.\n\nOn turn 33, (3,1) can be eaten.\n\nLife span to 34, so ok.\n\nOn turn 32 at (4,1), I can move to (3,1) on turn 33.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I move left first, it might take longer.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) move L to (3,4) on turn 30, then D to (3,3) on turn 31, then D to (3,2) on turn 32, then D to (3,1) on turn 33.\n\nSame thing.\n\nBut moving down directly might be faster for (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), so from (4,4) moving down to (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), then left to (3,1), but (4,1) to (3,1) is left, but when at (4,1), direction down, I can move left.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,4) moving down to (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) directly.\n\nShorter path.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (3,4) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1) is 4 moves, to eat on turn 33 if start from turn 30.\n\nTurn 29: move to (4,4)\n\nTurn 30: move to (3,4) or (4,3)\n\nIf to (3,4), then turn 31 to (3,3), turn 32 to (3,2), turn 33 to (3,1).\n\nEat on turn 33.\n\nLife span 6, present to turn 34, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (4,3) first, then to (3,3), etc., same.\n\nBut to (4,3) might not be necessary.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? The think 5+ turns ahead, but the output is for the current turn and future, but the instruction says to output actions starting from turn t1, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" for the decision, but the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I think for the response, I need to provide the sequence for a few turns, but it might depend on food, so perhaps I should provide the immediate action and a plan.\n\nThe answer format is: boxed with Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to list, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should list at least 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the state may change after moves, so I need to plan a sequence.\n\nSince food life span, I can plan to eat (3,1) first.\n\nSo for turn 29, move down to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 30, move to (3,4) or (4,3), but (3,4) is better for direct path to (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,4), move left to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 31, from (3,4) move down to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 32, from (3,3) move down to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 33, from (3,2) move down to (3,1) and eat.\n\nThen after that, I can go for (1,4).\n\nBut let's confirm the moves are safe.\n\nOn turn 29: move D to (4,4) - safe, as we said.\n\nAfter that, positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), tail (2,5)\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 30: move L to (3,4) - (3,4) is free, not wall, not occupied, so safe.\n\nHead to (3,4), direction left.\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), body seg1 to (4,4), seg2 to (4,5), seg3 to (5,5), seg4 to (5,6), seg5 to (4,6), seg6 to (3,6), tail to (2,6)\n\nTurn 31: from (3,4), move D to (3,3) - (3,3) free, not wall, not occupied, safe.\n\nHead to (3,3), direction down (since moved down).\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body seg1 to (3,4), seg2 to (4,4), seg3 to (4,5), seg4 to (5,5), seg5 to (5,6), seg6 to (4,6), tail to (3,6)\n\nTurn 32: from (3,3), move D to (3,2) - (3,2) free, no obstacle, not occupied, safe.\n\nHead to (3,2), direction down.\n\nPositions: head (3,2), body seg1 to (3,3), seg2 to (3,4), seg3 to (4,4), seg4 to (4,5), seg5 to (5,5), seg6 to (5,6), tail to (4,6)\n\nTurn 33: from (3,2), move D to (3,1) - (3,1) has food, and it is free, so move to (3,1), eat the food, length increases.\n\nBut (3,1) is not occupied, so safe.\n\nAfter eating, new tail grows, but no issue.\n\nThen I can continue to (1,4).\n\nBut for the response, I need to list actions for turn 29 to, say, turn 33 or so.\n\nSince the think ahead is for the decision, but I should provide the sequence for a few turns.\n\nNow, for turn 29, I have to choose an action.\n\nBut in this plan, on turn 29 I move down.\n\nBut what about moving left? If I move left on turn 29 to (3,5), then I can go down to (3,4) on turn 30, then to (3,3) on turn 31, etc., same as above, but from (3,5) to (3,4) is down, but on turn 29 I am at (3,5), turn 30 to (3,4), turn 31 to (3,3), turn 32 to (3,2), turn 33 to (3,1), same as above.\n\nBut from (4,5) moving down to (4,4) first adds an extra move? No, from (4,5) to (4,4) turn 29, then to (3,4) turn 30, to (3,3) turn 31, etc.\n\nWhereas if I go left to (3,5) turn 29, then to (3,4) turn 30, to (3,3) turn 31, so I reach (3,4) one turn earlier.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOption 1: turn 29 L to (3,5), turn 30 D to (3,4), turn 31 D to (3,3), turn 32 D to (3,2), turn 33 D to (3,1)\n\nEat on turn 33.\n\nOption 2: turn 29 D to (4,4), turn 30 L to (3,4), turn 31 D to (3,3), turn 32 D to (3,2), turn 33 D to (3,1)\n\nAlso eat on turn 33.\n\nSame number of turns to eat.\n\nIn option 1, on turn 30 I am at (3,4), in option 2 on turn 30 at (3,4) too, same.\n\nIn option 1, after turn 29 move L to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n\nThen turn 30 move D to (3,4), head to (3,4), body to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail to (2,6)\n\nOn turn 31 at (3,4), same as option 2 on turn 30 after moving to (3,4).\n\nBut in option 2, on turn 30 I am at (3,4) with different body positions, but for reaching (3,1), it's similar.\n\nHowever, in option 1, when I move to (3,5) on turn 29, I am closer to the left wall, and the body is behind, which might be riskier if I need to turn, but here I go straight down.\n\nSimilarly, both seem fine.\n\nBut in option 1, on turn 29 moving left, from (4,5) to (3,5), the cell (3,5) is free, but after moving, the body includes (4,5), which is where I was, but no issue.\n\nI think either is ok, but let's choose to move down to avoid the body area.\n\nPerhaps moving down is better for long-term to have more space.\n\nSince I need to output, I'll go with moving down on turn 29.\n\nThen for the sequence:\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nTurn 30: L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 31: D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 32: D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 33: D to (3,1) and eat.\n\nBut on turn 33, I eat (3,1).\n\nThen I can go for (1,4).\n\nBut for the answer, I need to list actions starting from turn 29 for several turns.\n\nSince (1,4) has long life, I can plan after eating (3,1).\n\nBut for now, this is a plan.\n\nIn the move to (3,4) on turn 30, is there food? No.\n\nSimilarly, all safe.\n\nNow, for the output, I should include up to turn 33 or so.\n\nBut let's see the direction constraints.\n\nOn turn 29, move D, direction down.\n\nTurn 30, move L to (3,4), from (4,4), moving left, which is not opposite to down, so ok.\n\nThen direction now left.\n\nTurn 31, move D to (3,3), from (3,4), moving down, not opposite to left (which is horizontal), so ok.\n\nThen direction down.\n\nTurn 32, move D to (3,2), continuing down, ok.\n\nTurn 33, move D to (3,1), ok.\n\nThen after that, from (3,1), I can move to (3,0) but y=0 wall, or to (2,1), (4,1), etc.\n\n(4,1) may be free, but (5,1) is obstacle, so (4,1) free.\n\nThen to (1,4), I need to go left and up.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) move L to (2,1), then to (1,1), but (1,1) may be free, then to (1,2) but (1,2) is internal obstacle, blocked, so cannot.\n\n(1,2) obstacle, so from (1,1) I can go to (1,0) wall or (2,1) or (1,2) blocked, so only to (2,1).\n\n(1,1) to (1,2) blocked, so I cannot reach (1,3) or (1,4) from bottom.\n\nThe only way to (1,4) is from (1,3) or (1,5), but (1,5) gone, so (1,3).\n\n(1,3) can be reached from (1,4) or from (2,3), etc.\n\n(2,3) is free? No obstacle.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move up to (3,2) but (3,2) is occupied after turn 32? No, on turn 33 I am at (3,1), after eating.\n\nPositions on turn 33 after eating (3,1): head at (3,1), and body since length increases by 1, so the tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nBut for movement, from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2), or L to (2,1), or R to (4,1), not D to (3,0) wall.\n\n(2,1) free, (4,1) free, (3,2) may be body.\n\nAfter turn 33 move to (3,1) and eat, new positions: head (3,1), then the body from before, but since ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions: head (3,1), then the previous head position becomes new segment.\n\nBefore move on turn 33, head at (3,2), say, after turn 32.\n\nOn turn 32, head at (3,2), positions: let's not detail.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move to (2,1) or (4,1) or (3,2).\n\n(3,2) might be body, depending.\n\nBut I can move to (2,1), then to (2,2), to (2,3), to (1,3), to (1,4).\n\nAll free.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut for the sequence, I think for turn 29 to 33 is fine.\n\nNow, for the immediate action, on turn 29, move down.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about the food at (1,5) but it's impossible, so no issue.\n\nSo I think D is good.\n\nBut let's confirm the other move.\n\nIf on turn 29 I move L to (3,5), then turn 30 move D to (3,4), same as above, but on turn 30 I am at (3,4) instead of in the other path at (4,4), but in both cases I reach (3,4) on turn 30.\n\nIn move L on turn 29, I go directly to (3,5), then to (3,4) turn 30.\n\nIn move D on turn 29, to (4,4), then to (3,4) turn 30.\n\nSo on turn 30, both have head at (3,4) if I choose.\n\nBut in move D, I have an extra move to (4,4), which is not necessary, but it doesn't hurt.\n\nSince both lead to the same, I can choose either.\n\nBut to decide, perhaps moving left is shorter for some paths, but here similar.\n\nI think for safety, moving down might be better to avoid the left area with obstacles.\n\nSince head direction is left, moving left is continuing, which might be fine.\n\nBut in this case, no big difference.\n\nI'll go with moving down on turn 29.\n\nSo action for turn 29: D\n\nThen for the sequence:\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nTurn 30: L (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 31: D (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 32: D (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 33: D (to (3,1))\n\nBut on turn 33, I move to (3,1) and eat.\n\nFor the answer, I need to list in the box.\n\nAlso, the action should be U, D, L, R.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nTurn 30: L\n\nTurn 31: D\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nBut I need to specify the turn numbers.\n\nCurrent turn t1=29.\n\nSo output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: D\nTurn 30: L\nTurn 31: D\nTurn 32: D\nTurn 33: D\n}\n\nBut is this correct? On turn 32, moving to (3,2), and (3,2) is free, yes.\n\nAnd on turn 33 to (3,1).\n\nYes.\n\nI could stop at turn 32 or 33.\n\nBut since think 5 turns, to turn 34, but turn 33 is t1+4, t1=29, t1+4=33.\n\nt1 to t1+4 is 5 turns.\n\nt1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3, t1+4: 5 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead (turns 29 to 33). The key considerations are:\n- The food at (1,5) with life span 1 cannot be eaten on turn 29 as it is too far, so it will disappear.\n- The food at (6,2) with life span 3 is unreachable by turn 31 due to distance and obstacles, so it is ignored.\n- The food at (3,1) with life span 6 is targeted for consumption on turn 33, as it provides a +1 score and increases length.\n- The food at (1,4) with life span 9 is not urgent and can be pursued after turn 33.\n- Moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions, leveraging the rule that moving to the tail cell is safe.\n- The plan ensures the snake moves efficiently toward (3,1) while maintaining open space for future maneuvers.\n\n### Detailed Plan for Turns 29-33:\n- **Turn 29 (current turn)**: Move down (D) to (4,4). This avoids the body cluster to the left and positions the snake to head toward (3,1). Direction constraint: Current head direction is left (L); moving down (D) is allowed (not opposite).\n- **Turn 30**: Move left (L) to (3,4). This continues the path downward while avoiding obstacles. Direction after turn 29 is down (D); moving left (L) is allowed.\n- **Turn 31**: Move down (D) to (3,3). This progresses directly toward (3,1). Direction after turn 30 is left (L); moving down (D) is allowed.\n- **Turn 32**: Move down (D) to (3,2). This brings the snake adjacent to (3,1). Direction after turn 31 is down (D); continuing down is allowed.\n- **Turn 33**: Move down (D) to (3,1) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length +1). Direction after turn 32 is down (D); continuing down is allowed.\n\n### Safety and Feasibility:\n- **Collision avoidance**: All moves are to free cells (no walls or body segments except safe tail moves). Internal obstacles (e.g., (2,4)) are avoided.\n- **Food timing**: (3,1) is eaten on turn 33, within its life span (present until turn 34).\n- **Long-term survival**: After turn 33, the snake can pursue (1,4) or other food. The path to (3,1) is low-risk and keeps the snake away from tight spaces.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: D\nTurn 30: L\nTurn 31: D\nTurn 32: D\nTurn 33: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 30, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are defined: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders. There are also internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So, I can't move into those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,4), then body segments: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning (x,y-1) since down decreases y.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (3,1) with life span 5 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,4) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive here, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. I should prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, border cells are walls, so for example, x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the snake can only be on cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n\nThe border cells are walls: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, meaning any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the accessible cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? But there are internal obstacles too.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nAlso, snake is at: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n\nFood at: (6,2), (3,1), (1,4)\n\nCurrent head position: (4,4), direction down.\n\nSince head direction is down, and we just moved down to (4,4), I assume. The positions are listed head first, so from previous position, it moved to (4,4) with direction D.\n\nNow, possible moves from current position (4,4): since direction is down, I can't instantly reverse to up, so I can move down, left, or right. Down would be to (4,3), but let's check if that's valid.\n\ny decreases for down, so from (4,4), down to (4,3), left to (3,4), right to (5,4).\n\nBut I need to check collisions and walls.\n\nFirst, walls: (4,3) is within x=4, y=3; x from 1-6, y from 1-6, so y=3 is between 1 and 6, so no wall. Similarly, (3,4) and (5,4) should be fine, as long as not obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(4,3) is not in that list.\n\n(3,4): is (3,4) an obstacle? Obstacles are (2,4), which is different, (2,4) not (3,4). (3,4) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\n(5,4): obstacles have (5,1) and (6,4), but (5,4) not mentioned, so free.\n\nNow, snake body: positions are (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). Head is at (4,4), so the body segments don't include (4,4) since it's the head, and the next is (4,5), which is above.\n\nSo for (4,3): is it occupied by body? Body positions: (4,5), (5,5), etc., all y=5 or 6 except head. (4,3) is free.\n\n(3,4): not occupied, body is at (4,5), (5,5), etc., no (3,4).\n\n(5,4): similarly, not occupied.\n\nAlso, tail is at (2,6), which will move when we move.\n\nNow, food: (6,2), (3,1), (1,4)\n\n(1,4) is a food position, and it's not occupied by snake yet.\n\nBut snake is at (4,4), so (1,4) is far.\n\nNow, I need to think about eating food.\n\nFirst, from (4,4), possible actions: D (down to (4,3)), L (left to (3,4)), R (right to (5,4))\n\nI cannot go up because that would be reverse direction from down, and no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so moving up would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nNow, let's see the food life spans.\n\nFood at (6,2): life span 3, so it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 30, life span is 3, so it will be there for turns 30,31,32, and disappear after turn 32? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo, at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So for (6,2), life span 3 at turn 30, so:\n\n- Turn 30: life span 3\n\n- Turn 31: life span 2\n\n- Turn 32: life span 1\n\n- Turn 33: life span 0, disappears? Or after turn 32, when we move to turn 33, it's gone.\n\nTypically, it might be that at the start of turn, life span is checked, and if 0, removed before the turn.\n\nBut for planning, it will be available until turn 32 inclusive, I think.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) life span 5 at turn 30, so available until turn 34? Turn 30:5, 31:4, 32:3, 33:2, 34:1, 35:0 gone. So available turns 30 to 34.\n\n(1,4) life span 8, turn 30:8, so available until turn 37.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,4).\n\nI should consider paths to food while avoiding risks.\n\nAlso, tail position: tail is at (2,6), and when we move, the tail moves forward only if we don't eat food. If we eat, length increases, tail stays, but new segment added.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nIn this case, since value is +1, length increases by 1, so when you eat, head moves to food, new tail segment is added, so the tail position remains until next move.\n\nBut for collision, we need to be careful.\n\nNow, important: Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (2,6), and is there food on tail? Food positions are (6,2), (3,1), (1,4), none on (2,6), so no issue now.\n\nBut (2,6) is the tail, and head is at (4,4), not adjacent; distance is |4-2| + |4-6| = 2+2=4, not adjacent. Adjacent would be one step away.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, let's think about possible moves from (4,4).\n\nOption 1: Down to (4,3)\n\nThen from (4,3), possible moves: since we moved down, direction is D, so can go D, L, R (not U, reverse).\n\n(4,3) to (4,2) down, (3,3) left, (5,3) right.\n\n(4,2) is free? Walls: y=2>1, x=4, not border. Obstacles: no, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3), (5,3) should be free.\n\nBut food: (3,1) is below, but not directly.\n\nOption 2: Left to (3,4)\n\nFrom (3,4), direction L, so can go L, D, U (not R, reverse).\n\nTo (2,4) left, (3,3) down, (3,5) up.\n\n(2,4) is an internal obstacle! (2,4) is in obstacles list: internal obstacles [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n\nSo (2,4) is a wall, cannot go there.\n\n(3,3) down, (3,5) up.\n\n(3,5): is it occupied? Snake body: positions include (4,5), (5,5), etc. (3,5) not listed, but let's see: snake is at (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). So (3,5) is not occupied, and not wall, so free.\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nOption 3: Right to (5,4)\n\nFrom (5,4), direction R, so can go R, D, U (not L, reverse).\n\nTo (6,4) right, but (6,4) is internal obstacle! (6,4) is in the list, so wall, cannot go.\n\nThen down to (5,3), up to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is occupied by snake body! Positions: (4,5), (5,5), etc., so (5,5) is the second segment, cannot move there, collision.\n\nSo from (5,4), possible moves: down to (5,3) or up to (5,5), but (5,5) is body, so only down to (5,3) is possible? Up to (5,5) is invalid because occupied.\n\nDirection: from (5,4) after moving right, direction is R, so moves: right to (6,4) invalid, down to (5,3), up to (5,5) but occupied, so only down to (5,3) is possible? But we can move down or up, but up is occupied.\n\nAvailable moves: since direction R, we can move R, D, U, but R to (6,4) wall, U to (5,5) occupied by body, so only D to (5,3) is valid.\n\n(5,3) should be free.\n\nNow, back to current move.\n\nSo from head (4,4) direction D:\n\n- Down to (4,3): then from there, can go to (4,2), (3,3), (5,3), all possible initially.\n\n- Left to (3,4): then from there, can go down to (3,3) or up to (3,5), since left to (2,4) wall, and right is reverse not allowed.\n\n- Right to (5,4): then only down to (5,3) possible, since right and up invalid.\n\nRight to (5,4) is tight.\n\nNow, I need to think about food.\n\nFood at (6,2) life span 3, so only available for 3 turns including current, so if I want to eat it, I need to reach it soon.\n\n(6,2) is at x=6,y=2.\n\nHead at (4,4), so distance: |4-6| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4 steps away, but with obstacles and body, not direct.\n\nSpecifically, (6,2) is near obstacle (6,4) and (6,1), but (6,2) should be free.\n\nTo reach (6,2) from (4,4), one path: right to (5,4), then down to (5,3), then down to (5,2)? (5,2) should be free, then right to (6,2).\n\nBut from (5,4), after moving right, we can only go down to (5,3), as above.\n\nFrom (5,3), direction D, then can go down to (5,2), or left to (4,3)? Left would be to (4,3), which might be free, or right to (6,3) but x=6, y=3; internal obstacles have (6,4) and (6,1), but (6,3) not mentioned, so should be free? But border: x=6 is border? Walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so x=6 is not x=0 or x=7, x=6 is within 1-6? x from 1 to 6 are accessible, since x=0 and x=7 are walls.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are free, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles at (6,4), (6,1), so (6,3) is not obstacle, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is food, not wall.\n\nSo from (5,3), can go down to (5,2), left to (4,3), right to (6,3), or up? Direction from (5,3) after moving down, direction D, so can go D, L, R (not U).\n\nDown to (5,2), left to (4,3), right to (6,3).\n\nThen to (6,2) from (6,3) down, or from (5,2) right.\n\nBut (5,2) to (6,2) is right.\n\nNow, from current, if I go right to (5,4), then down to (5,3), then I can go to (5,2) or (6,3), then to (6,2).\n\nBut (6,2) life span 3 at turn 30, so if I move on turn 30,31,32.\n\nIf I go right on turn 30 to (5,4), then on turn 31 down to (5,3), then on turn 32 down to (5,2) or right to (6,3), but to eat (6,2) on turn 32, I need to be on (6,2) on turn 32.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 31, on turn 32 I can go to (5,2) or (6,3) or (4,3).\n\nTo reach (6,2) on turn 32, from (5,3) on turn 31, I can go to (6,3) on turn 32, but (6,3) is not (6,2), so I need another turn to go down to (6,2) on turn 33, but life span: at turn 30 life=3, turn 31 life=2, turn 32 life=1, turn 33 life=0, disappears. So on turn 33, it might be gone before move, so I can only eat on turn 32 if life>0 on turn 32.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current, so at start of turn t, life span L, during turn, if head moves to food, it eats, then after turn, life span decreases.\n\nTypically, the sequence: at turn t, we move, if head on food, eat it, then food life span decreases for next turn.\n\nBut the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it disappears.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nFor example, if at turn t, life span L, then after the turn, it decreases to L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nBut when we move during turn, if head moves to food, we eat it before it disappears.\n\nStandard: on turn t, with life span L, we can eat it if we move there, then after eating, the food is gone, so no decrease.\n\nBut the countdown decreases every turn, including when not eaten.\n\nI think: at the end of each turn, for each food, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1. If life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n\nIf eaten during the turn, it is removed immediately.\n\nFor (6,2) at turn 30, life=3, so it can be eaten on turn 30,31,32. On turn 33, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for (6,2), to eat it, I need to be on (6,2) by turn 32.\n\nTurn 32 is the last chance.\n\nNow, from current turn 30, head at (4,4).\n\nIf I go right to (5,4) on turn 30, then on turn 31 down to (5,3), then on turn 32, from (5,3) I can go down to (5,2) or right to (6,3), but neither is (6,2). From (5,2) on turn 32, I can go right to (6,2) on turn 33, but on turn 33, food may be gone if life span 0.\n\nLife: turn 30 life=3, after turn 30, if not eaten, life=2 for turn 31.\n\nAfter turn 31, if not eaten, life=1 for turn 32.\n\nAfter turn 32, if not eaten, life=0, disappears before turn 33.\n\nSo I can eat on turn 32 with life=1, but not on turn 33.\n\nSo to eat (6,2), I must be on it on turn 30,31, or 32.\n\nTurn 30: I am at (4,4), not (6,2).\n\nTurn 31: I can move to (6,2) only if I am adjacent on turn 30, but from (4,4) to (6,2) is not adjacent; min 2 moves.\n\nFrom (4,4), in one move I can go to (4,3), (3,4), (5,4), none is (6,2).\n\nThen turn 31 from there, e.g. if at (5,4), to (6,2) not adjacent, etc.\n\nSo I can reach (6,2) earliest on turn 32.\n\nFor example: turn 30: move right to (5,4)\n\nTurn 31: move down to (5,3)  // assuming from (5,4) only down possible\n\nThen turn 32: from (5,3), move right to (6,3)  // (6,3) is free\n\nThen on turn 32, I am at (6,3), not (6,2). To go to (6,2), I need to move down from (6,3) on turn 33, but turn 33 food gone.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 32, I can move down to (5,2), then on turn 33 to (6,2), but too late.\n\nAlternative path: from (4,4) turn 30 down to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 31 down to (4,2)  // if possible\n\nThen turn 32 right to (5,2), not (6,2)\n\nThen turn 33 to (6,2) late.\n\nOr from (4,2) turn 32 right to (5,2), same.\n\nTo reach (6,2) on turn 32, I need to be at a adjacent cell on turn 31.\n\nAdjacent cells to (6,2): (6,3), (6,1), (5,2), (7,2) but x=7 wall, so (6,3), (6,1), (5,2)\n\n(6,1) is internal obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nSo only (6,3) and (5,2) are possible adjacent cells.\n\nSo on turn 31, I need to be at (6,3) or (5,2) to move to (6,2) on turn 32.\n\nNow, from current turn 30, head at (4,4), can I reach (6,3) or (5,2) on turn 31?\n\n(6,3): from (4,4) to (6,3) is |4-6| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps? Not possible in one move.\n\n(5,2): from (4,4) to (5,2) is |4-5| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 steps, not possible in one move.\n\nOn turn 30, I move to one of (4,3), (3,4), (5,4)\n\nThen on turn 31, from there:\n\nIf at (4,3), I can go to (4,2), (3,3), (5,3) — none is (6,3) or (5,2)\n\n(5,3) is close to (5,2) but not adjacent yet.\n\nIf at (3,4), I can go to (3,3) or (3,5) — not closer.\n\nIf at (5,4), I can go to (5,3) only, as we saw.\n\nThen at (5,3) on turn 31, I can be at (5,3), which is not (5,2) or (6,3).\n\nSo on turn 31, the closest I can be is (5,3) or (4,2) etc, but not adjacent to (6,2).\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach (6,2) on turn 32; it's impossible to eat (6,2) because it takes at least 3 moves from (4,4) to (6,2): e.g., (4,4) -> (5,4) -> (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2), that's 4 moves to be on (6,2), so turn 34, but food gone by turn 33.\n\nMinimum moves: (4,4) to (5,4) turn 30, (5,4) to (5,3) turn 31, (5,3) to (6,3) turn 32, (6,3) to (6,2) turn 33 — but turn 33 food gone.\n\n(4,4) to (4,3) turn 30, (4,3) to (5,3) turn 31, (5,3) to (5,2) turn 32, (5,2) to (6,2) turn 33 — same.\n\nNo shorter path, so I cannot eat (6,2) at all. It will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSimilarly, for other food.\n\nSo forget about (6,2), it's not reachable in time.\n\nNow, other food: (3,1) at turn 30 life=5, so available until turn 34.\n\n(1,4) life=8, available longer.\n\nNow, snake at (4,4), with body.\n\nAlso, the grid has obstacles.\n\nI should consider the snake's body and potential traps.\n\nSnake positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n\nSo the body forms a sort of loop or something.\n\nFrom (4,4) down to (4,3) might be safe.\n\nLeft to (3,4) or right to (5,4).\n\nBut going right to (5,4) leads to a dead end because from there only down to (5,3), and then I have options, but the area is cramped.\n\nGoing left to (3,4) has the obstacle at (2,4), so I can go down to (3,3) or up to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is near body: body at (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), so (3,5) is above (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is body, (3,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, down to (3,3).\n\nNow, food at (3,1), which is below.\n\nAnd (1,4) to the left.\n\n(1,4) has life=8, plenty of time.\n\n(3,1) life=5, need to eat by turn 34.\n\nPath to (3,1): from (4,4) to (3,1), |4-3| + |4-1| =1+3=4 steps, but with turns.\n\nSince head direction down, going down to (4,3) might be good to start towards (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then down to (3,1), for example.\n\n(3,2) should be free; obstacles not there.\n\n(3,1) is food, not wall.\n\nLife span: at turn 30, I can be at (4,3) on turn 31 if I move down now.\n\nTurn 30: move down to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 31: from (4,3), direction D, can go down to (4,2), left to (3,3), right to (5,3)\n\nSay go left to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 32: from (3,3), direction L (since moved left), can go L, D, U (not R)\n\nL to (2,3)? (2,3) is not obstacle, free? Obstacles (2,4), but (2,3) different.\n\nD to (3,2), U to (3,4) but (3,4) we came from or something.\n\n(3,4) is previous, but not occupied now.\n\nAfter moving, the snake moves, so positions change.\n\nAfter turn 30: move down to (4,3), so new positions: head (4,3), then the body: previous head was (4,4), so it becomes body, so snake: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — tail (3,6) or (2,6)? Original positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)] so 7 segments.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,3), head to (4,3), then body: the segment that was at (4,4) is now part of body, and the tail (2,6) moves off? When we move without eating, the tail moves.\n\nStandard snake movement: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed from old position.\n\nSo after moving down to (4,3), snake becomes: head (4,3), then body: (4,4) [previous head], (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — and (2,6) is removed, since tail moves.\n\nPositions: new head (4,3), then the segments: first body segment is the previous head position, which is (4,4), then next is (4,5), then (5,5), then (5,6), then (4,6), then (3,6). The tail (2,6) is gone, so snake is now (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — 7 segments, same length.\n\n(3,6) is the new tail.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat food, length increases.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nIf I go down to (4,3) on turn 30.\n\nThen turn 31, at (4,3), I can go left to (3,3), for example, to go towards (3,1).\n\nGo to (3,3) on turn 31.\n\nThen turn 32, at (3,3), I can go down to (3,2), since direction L (moved left), so down to (3,2) or left to (2,3) or up to (3,4).\n\nGo down to (3,2) on turn 32.\n\nThen turn 33, at (3,2), direction D, can go down to (3,1) to eat the food.\n\nNow, (3,1) is food with value +1, so on turn 33, I move to (3,1), eat it, length increases.\n\nLife span of (3,1): at turn 30 life=5, turn 31 life=4, turn 32 life=3, turn 33 life=2, so on turn 33 I eat it, fine.\n\nSo I can eat (3,1) on turn 33.\n\nNow, what about other moves? I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,4), which I might go for later.\n\nBut first, is this path safe?\n\nFrom (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1).\n\nNow, check for collisions or risks.\n\nWhen moving to (3,3) from (4,3), (3,3) should be free; no body or obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) free.\n\n(3,1) is food, free.\n\nAfter eating on turn 33, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment at previous tail position.\n\nBut let's see the positions.\n\nAfter turn 30: move to (4,3), snake: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\nTurn 31: move left to (3,3), so head to (3,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — tail (4,6)? Previous positions: head was (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). After moving to (3,3), new head (3,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — and (3,6) removed, so tail is (4,6).\n\nSnake: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n\nTurn 32: move down to (3,2), head to (3,2), body: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) — tail (5,6)? Previous tail (4,6) removed.\n\nPositions: after move, head (3,2), body: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) — and (4,6) removed, so tail (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is body, not tail? List: head (3,2), then segments: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) — so 7 segments, tail (5,6).\n\nTurn 33: move down to (3,1), eat food. So head to (3,1), body: since eat, new segment added, so body: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) — and tail remains, so snake now 8 segments: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nNow, after that, I need to think where to go.\n\nBut I also have the other food at (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is at x=1,y=4, and there is an obstacle at (1,2), but (1,4) should be free.\n\nNow, from (3,1), I can go towards (1,4).\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nI need to consider if there are better options.\n\nFor example, going left from (4,4) to (3,4) instead.\n\nTurn 30: left to (3,4)\n\nThen from (3,4), direction L, can go down to (3,3) or up to (3,5), since left to (2,4) wall.\n\nIf go down to (3,3) on turn 31, then similar as before to (3,1) by turn 33.\n\nBut on turn 31 from (3,4) to (3,3), then turn 32 to (3,2), turn 33 to (3,1), same as above.\n\nBut if I go up to (3,5) on turn 31.\n\n(3,5) is near the body.\n\nAfter turn 30 move left to (3,4), snake: head (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — tail (3,6) or? Previous positions: head was (4,4), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). After move to (3,4), new head (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — tail (3,6), since (2,6) removed.\n\nThen turn 31: move up to (3,5), head to (3,5), body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — tail (4,6).\n\nNow (3,5) is free, but then I am at (3,5), and food is below or at (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is left, but I have obstacles.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go left to (2,5)? (2,5) free? Obstacles (2,4), but (2,5) not, so free.\n\nThen to (1,5), etc to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) has life=8, no rush.\n\nBut going to (3,5) might not be efficient for food.\n\nMoreover, the area around (3,5) and (4,5) has body, so I might get trapped.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,5), then body is around.\n\nWhereas going down towards (3,1) seems safer and gets food soon.\n\nNow, another option: going right to (5,4) on turn 30.\n\nBut from (5,4), only down to (5,3) possible on turn 31.\n\nThen at (5,3) on turn 31, I can go down to (5,2), or left to (4,3), or right to (6,3).\n\nBut (5,2) and (6,3) are not food, and (6,2) is gone.\n\nThen I need to go elsewhere.\n\nFor example, to (3,1) from (5,3) is farther.\n\nOr to (1,4).\n\nBut it might take more turns.\n\nSince (6,2) is not reachable, and (3,1) is reachable in 3 moves from current if I go down now, I think going down to (4,3) is good.\n\nThen I can eat (3,1) on turn 33.\n\nNow, after that, I have (1,4) to consider.\n\nBut let's think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nThe grid has obstacles, so I should map free cells.\n\nAccessible area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo free cells: all except these and borders.\n\nNow, snake after eating (3,1) on turn 33 will be at (3,1) with body as above.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), I am at (3,1), so |3-1| + |1-4| = 2+3=5 steps, but not direct.\n\nPath: for example, from (3,1) go left to (2,1), but (2,1) free? Obstacles (2,4), not (2,1), so free.\n\nThen to (1,1), but (1,1) is y=1, x=1, not border? Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so x=1,y=1 is accessible, but there is obstacle at (1,2), which is above.\n\n(1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) might be free, but (1,2) blocked.\n\nFrom (2,1) I can go up to (2,2), then to (2,3), etc, but (2,4) is obstacle, so I need to go around.\n\n(2,4) obstacle, so from (2,3) I can go left to (1,3) or up to (2,4) invalid, or down to (2,2), etc.\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), so I need to reach it.\n\nSince (1,4) is food, and life span 8, I can take time.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat it eventually.\n\nNow, back to current decision.\n\nI think going down to (4,3) on turn 30 is a good start to get the (3,1) food.\n\nThen I need to plan the subsequent moves.\n\nBut the answer should be actions for several turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions from turn t1 onwards for a few turns, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from t1.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action ... Turn t1+1: action ... }\"\n\nAnd \"each action for the turn\"\n\nSo I need to specify actions for turn 30, 31, 32, etc., but how many? It doesn't specify, but since I plan ahead, I should output a sequence, say for 5 turns or until I eat food or something.\n\nBut for now, let's plan turn 30 to, say, turn 34.\n\nFirst, turn 30: move down to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 31: from (4,3), I need to go towards (3,1), so move left to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 32: from (3,3), move down to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 33: from (3,2), move down to (3,1) and eat.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 34, I am at (3,1) with direction down (since I moved down to get there).\n\nSnake positions after turn 33: as above, head at (3,1), body: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) — 8 segments.\n\nDirection: since I moved down to (3,1), direction D.\n\nFrom (3,1), possible moves: down to (3,0) but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n\nLeft to (2,1), right to (4,1), up to (3,2) but (3,2) is body now.\n\n(3,2) is the first body segment, so cannot go up, collision.\n\nSimilarly, down to (3,0) wall.\n\nLeft to (2,1): (2,1) should be free, no obstacle or body.\n\nRight to (4,1): (4,1) free? Obstacles (5,1), but (4,1) not, so free.\n\nBut (5,1) is obstacle, so (4,1) ok.\n\nNow, I want to go towards (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), so from (3,1), I can go left to (2,1), then up to (2,2), then left to (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle! (1,2) is internal obstacle.\n\nOh, problem.\n\n(1,2) is wall, so I cannot go directly to (1,4) from below.\n\nPath to (1,4): it must be from above or right.\n\n(1,4) adjacent cells: (1,3), (1,5), (2,4), (0,4) but x=0 wall, (2,4) obstacle, so only (1,3) and (1,5) possible.\n\n(1,5) is y=5,x=1, should be free? Obstacles (1,2), not (1,5), so free.\n\nSimilarly (1,3) free.\n\nSo to reach (1,4), I need to be at (1,3) or (1,5) first.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go to (2,1), then to (2,2), then to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,4).\n\n(2,2), (2,3), (1,3) should be free.\n\n(1,3) is free, yes.\n\nSince (1,2) obstacle, but (1,3) is above.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,3) to (1,3) left.\n\nThen to (1,4) up.\n\nNow, life span of (1,4) is 8 at turn 30, so on turn 37 it disappears, plenty of time.\n\nBut after turn 33, I can start going there.\n\nNow, back to turn 34: at (3,1), direction D.\n\nCannot go down (wall), cannot go up (body at (3,2)), so only left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\nGoing left to (2,1) is towards (1,4).\n\nGoing right to (4,1) might lead to other areas, but (5,1) is obstacle, so not much there.\n\nSo better to go left.\n\nThus on turn 34, move left to (2,1)\n\nThen from there, I can go up to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut for the sequence, I need to output from turn 30.\n\nIn the sequence I have turn 30 to 33: down, left, down, down to eat (3,1).\n\nThen turn 34: left to (2,1)\n\nBut I need to think if this is optimal.\n\nAnother option: after eating (3,1), I could go right to (4,1), but then I have to go up or something, but (1,4) is left, so it might take longer.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nMoreover, the body is at (3,2), (3,3), etc, so going left is better.\n\nNow, what about the initial move? I assumed going down, but what about going left first?\n\nTurn 30: left to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 31: from (3,4), I can go down to (3,3) or up to (3,5)\n\nIf go down to (3,3), same as before, then turn 32 to (3,2), turn 33 to (3,1), eat.\n\nSame as above.\n\nIf I go up to (3,5) on turn 31, then I am at (3,5), and (3,1) is below, so I need to go down, but it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 31: up to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 32: from (3,5), direction U, can go U, L, R (not D reverse? After moving up, direction U, so cannot go down immediately.\n\nFrom (3,5), moved up, so direction U, can go up to (3,6)? But (3,6) might be body.\n\nAfter turn 30: move left to (3,4), snake: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — tail (3,6)\n\nTurn 31: move up to (3,5), head to (3,5), body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — tail (4,6)\n\nNow (3,5) is head, direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: up to (3,6), but (3,6) is not current body? Current body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — (3,6) was tail but removed, so (3,6) is free now? Positions after turn 31: head (3,5), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — so (3,6) is not occupied; it was removed when we moved to (3,5).\n\nSo (3,6) is free.\n\nSo from (3,5) direction U, can go up to (3,6), left to (2,5), right to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is body, since in the list (4,5), so cannot.\n\nRight to (4,5) occupied.\n\nLeft to (2,5) free, up to (3,6) free.\n\nSay go up to (3,6) on turn 32.\n\nThen at (3,6), direction U, can go up to (3,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; left to (2,6), right to (4,6) but (4,6) is body? Current positions: after move to (3,6), head (3,6), body: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) — tail (5,6)? Previous tail (4,6) removed.\n\n(4,6) was body, but after moving, when head to (3,6), body: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) — so (4,6) gone, (5,6) is there.\n\n(4,6) is removed, so (4,6) is free? But (4,6) was occupied, now free.\n\nFrom (3,6) direction U, but up to (3,7) wall, left to (2,6) free, right to (4,6) free now, or down but reverse not allowed.\n\nCan go left to (2,6) or right to (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) was body, now free.\n\nThen I can go to (4,6) or (2,6), but not towards food.\n\nTo get to (3,1), I need to go down, but from (3,6), I can only go left or right, not down immediately.\n\nThen it might take many turns to go down.\n\nFor example, from (3,6) go right to (4,6) on turn 33, then from (4,6) direction R, can go down to (4,5) but (4,5) is body? Current at turn 33: after turn 32 at (3,6), positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nTurn 33: move right to (4,6), head to (4,6), body: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail (5,5)\n\n(4,6) is head, direction R.\n\nThen can go right to (5,6)? (5,6) is body? (5,6) is in body, but after move, positions: head (4,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — so (5,6) removed, (5,5) is there.\n\n(5,6) gone, so (5,6) free? Not necessarily.\n\n(4,6) to (5,6) right: (5,6) should be free now.\n\nSimilarly, down to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nUp to (4,7) wall.\n\nSo only right to (5,6) or left to (3,6) but reverse not allowed.\n\nDirection R, so can go R, U, D.\n\nU to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5) occupied, so only R to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is free, as above.\n\nSo go to (5,6) on turn 33.\n\nBut (3,1) is far, and I haven't eaten it yet.\n\nLife span: on turn 33, (3,1) life=2? Turn 30:5, 31:4, 32:3, 33:2, so if I can reach on turn 34 or 35.\n\nBut from (5,6) to (3,1) is long way, and I might not make it.\n\nFor example, min moves: (5,6) to (3,1) |5-3| + |6-1| = 2+5=7 moves, so turn 40 or later, but food gone by turn 35.\n\nTurn 33 at (5,6), turn 34 to (5,5) but (5,5) is body? After turn 33: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) — (4,5) is body, (5,5) gone? Positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5) — so (5,5) not occupied.\n\nFrom (5,6) direction R, can go down to (5,5), left to (4,6) but reverse, not allowed; right to (6,6), up to (5,7) wall.\n\nSo down to (5,5) or right to (6,6).\n\n(5,5) should be free.\n\nGo down to (5,5) on turn 34.\n\nThen continue, but to (3,1) it takes many turns, cannot reach by turn 34 or 35.\n\nTurn 35: life=0 after turn 34? After turn 34, life=0, disappears.\n\nSo I must eat by turn 34.\n\nOn turn 34, if at (3,1), I can eat, but if I am elsewhere, not possible.\n\nIn this path, if I go to (3,5) on turn 31, I cannot reach (3,1) in time.\n\nTherefore, going up to (3,5) is bad, I miss the food.\n\nThus, from (3,4), I should go down to (3,3) instead.\n\nSimilarly, going right to (5,4) initially might not lead to food soon.\n\nTherefore, best to go down on turn 30 to (4,3), then proceed to (3,1).\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 30: move down to (4,3)\n\nTurn 31: from (4,3), move left to (3,3)  // towards (3,1)\n\nAfter moving left to (3,3), direction L.\n\nTurn 32: from (3,3), move down to (3,2)  // can do, direction L, down is allowed.\n\nAfter moving down, direction D.\n\nTurn 33: from (3,2), move down to (3,1) and eat.\n\nNow, I should output up to here, but think ahead for survival.\n\nAfter turn 33, at (3,1), as before, need to move.\n\nTurn 34: from (3,1), direction D, cannot down (wall), cannot up (body), so left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\nGo left to (2,1) towards (1,4).\n\nThen turn 35: from (2,1), direction L (since moved left), can go left to (1,1), up to (2,2), down to (2,0) wall, or right but reverse not allowed.\n\nDown to (2,0) invalid.\n\nLeft to (1,1): (1,1) should be free.\n\nUp to (2,2).\n\nNow, (1,1) is below, but (1,4) is up, so go up to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) free.\n\nThen turn 36: from (2,2), direction U (moved up), can go up to (2,3), left to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, right to (3,2), down to (2,1) but reverse not allowed.\n\nSo up to (2,3) or right to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) might be body or not, but after several moves, it might be free.\n\nSince we want (1,4), go to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) free.\n\nTurn 37: from (2,3), direction U, can go up to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid; left to (1,3), right to (3,3), down to (2,2) reverse not allowed.\n\nSo left to (1,3) or right to (3,3).\n\nGo left to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) free.\n\nTurn 38: from (1,3), direction L, can go up to (1,4) to eat, or down to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, or left to (0,3) wall, or right reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only up to (1,4), eat the food.\n\nAnd life span: at turn 30 life=8, so turn 37: life=1? Turn 30:8, 31:7, 32:6, 33:5, 34:4, 35:3, 36:2, 37:1, 38:0, so on turn 38 I can eat it with life=1.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 30.\n\nSince the food at (1,4) is far, and I have time, but in the sequence above, I can output until turn 33 or so.\n\nBut to show thinking ahead, I can output more.\n\nNow, another thing: when I go to (3,1), and then left to (2,1), is there any risk?\n\nFor example, the tail reward danger, but tail is at (5,5) or something, not adjacent.\n\nIn the path, it should be fine.\n\nGoing down first seems safe.\n\nBut what about going right initially? I think it's worse.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the internal space.\n\nBut I think down is best.\n\nSo for turn 30: D (down)\n\nThen turn 31: from (4,3), I need to go left to (3,3), so L (left)\n\nBut is there food or something? No.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to (4,2) on turn 31, but then to (3,1) I need to go left and down, which might take same or more turns.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) turn 31 down to (4,2), then turn 32 left to (3,2), turn 33 down to (3,1), same as before, but I reach (3,1) on turn 33 still.\n\nBut from (4,2) to (3,2) might be similar.\n\nBut in my sequence, from (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1), or (4,3) to (4,2) to (3,2) to (3,1), both 3 moves to eat on turn 33.\n\nBut in the first, I go to (3,3) which might be closer to other areas.\n\nBut since (1,4) is northwest, going to (3,3) is fine.\n\nI think either is ok, but I'll stick with left.\n\nNow, for the answer, I should output the actions.\n\nAlso, ensure no instant reverse.\n\nIn turn 30 move down, direction D.\n\nTurn 31 move left, from (4,3) to (3,3), moving left, so direction changes to L.\n\nTurn 32 move down to (3,2), from (3,3) to (3,2), down, so direction D.\n\nTurn 33 move down to (3,1), down, direction D.\n\nAll fine.\n\nThen beyond, but I can output up to turn 33 or 34.\n\nSince the format might expect a sequence, I'll do for 5 turns: turn 30 to 34.\n\nTurn 34: from (3,1) move left to (2,1), so L.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nTurn 31: L\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nTurn 34: L\n\nBut turn 34 L to (2,1)\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the state.\n\nAlso, food at (6,2) is ignored since not reachable.\n\nAnd (1,4) will be eaten later.\n\nI think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned a sequence of moves at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- The food at (6,2) has a life span of 3 at turn 30, meaning it disappears after turn 32. However, it is impossible to reach (6,2) by turn 32 from the starting position (4,4) due to the minimum distance of 3 moves and obstacles, so this food is ignored.\n- The food at (3,1) has a life span of 5 at turn 30, so it can be eaten on turns 30, 31, 32, 33, or 34. A path to eat it on turn 33 is feasible and safe.\n- The food at (1,4) has a life span of 8 at turn 30, so it can be eaten later (e.g., around turn 38), allowing focus on (3,1) first.\n- Moving down on turn 30 to (4,3) avoids immediate risks and sets up a path to (3,1) while keeping options open for (1,4) later.\n- Subsequent moves are planned to safely reach (3,1) by turn 33, eating it for +1 score and length increase.\n- After eating (3,1), moving left on turn 34 towards (1,4) begins the path to that food while avoiding collisions and walls.\n- All moves respect the no-instant-reverse rule and avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n\nThe planned sequence for turns 30 to 34 is:\n- **Turn 30**: Move down (D) to (4,3). This starts the path to (3,1) and avoids the risky right move, which leads to a dead end.\n- **Turn 31**: Move left (L) to (3,3). From (4,3), left is chosen over down or right to position for a direct descent to (3,1).\n- **Turn 32**: Move down (D) to (3,2). This continues towards (3,1) safely.\n- **Turn 33**: Move down (D) to (3,1) and eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases). The life span of (3,1) is 2 at turn 33, so eating is valid.\n- **Turn 34**: Move left (L) to (2,1). After eating, this move heads towards (1,4) while avoiding the wall at y=0 and the body at (3,2).\n\nBeyond turn 34, the snake can continue to (1,4) via (2,2), (2,3), and (1,3) to eat around turn 38, but the sequence above covers the immediate 5 turns with a food eat and safe pathing.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: D (down)\nTurn 31: L (left)\nTurn 32: D (down)\nTurn 33: D (down)\nTurn 34: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 31, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), and the walls are the borders plus some internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nThe snake positions are: head at (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So the tail is at (3,6). Snake head direction is down, which is decreasing y since D is (x,y-1). Let me confirm: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So down means y decreases.\n\nHead at (4,3) with direction D, so it's moving down.\n\nFood positions with value and life span:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,4) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food here is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all, so all are +1 food.\n\nI need to plan 5+ turns ahead. Current turn is 31, so I need actions for turn 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, etc., but since it's \"think 5+ turns ahead,\" I should plan a sequence, but the output should be for multiple turns starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, t1+2, etc. So for turn 31, 32, 33, and so on. How many turns should I plan? It says \"think 5+ turns ahead,\" so I should plan at least 5 moves, but probably more to show the sequence.\n\nThe core rules say to think 5+ turns ahead, so I need to simulate multiple steps.\n\nAlso, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells outside are invalid.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) so tail at (3,6).\n\nDirection down, so from (4,3), moving to (4,2) if it moves down? But let's see possible moves.\n\nSince head direction is D, I can't instantly reverse to U, so I can move D, L, or R, but not U.\n\nPossible moves from (4,3):\n\n- Down (D): to (4,2)\n\n- Left (L): to (3,3)\n\n- Right (R): to (5,3)\n\nNow, check if these are valid: no collision with walls or body.\n\nFirst, walls: borders are walls, so (4,2) is within bounds since y=0 is wall, y=2 is fine. x=4, y=2.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) and (5,3) are within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). None of these are (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3), so all are free.\n\nNow, body collision: snake positions are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).\n\n(4,2) is not in the body, so safe.\n\n(3,3) is not in the body positions listed.\n\n(5,3) not in body.\n\nAlso, tail is at (3,6), which is far.\n\nBut when moving, the tail moves only after the head moves, so for collision check, we consider the body except the tail, because when head moves, tail might move away.\n\nRule: deadly collisions include body collision (head touches any body segment except that you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment since tail will move.\n\nSo, in the body list, the tail is the last segment. Here, positions: index 0 head (4,3), index 1 (4,4), index 2 (4,5), index 3 (5,5), index 4 (5,6), index 5 (4,6), index 6 (3,6) tail.\n\nSo when head moves to a new cell, it can collide with any body segment except that if it moves to the tail cell, it's ok because tail will move forward and not be there anymore.\n\nSimilarly, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by tail.\n\nBut in this case, for move to (4,2), body segments are (4,4), (4,5), etc., not (4,2), so no collision.\n\n(3,3): not in body, so ok.\n\n(5,3): not in body, ok.\n\nNow, food: I should consider eating food, but with risks.\n\nFood at (6,2), (3,1), (1,4), (2,2).\n\nLife spans: (6,2) has life span 2, so it will disappear after 2 turns, meaning if not eaten by turn 32, it will be gone? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nCurrent turn t1=31.\n\nFood (6,2) life span 2, so at turn 31, life span 2; after turn 31, life span becomes 1; after turn 32, life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 31 or 32, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) life span 4: can be eaten turn 31 to 34.\n\n(1,4) life span 7: turns 31 to 37.\n\n(2,2) life span 10: turns 31 to 40.\n\nNow, all food is positive, so eating any gives +1 score and snake grows by 1.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks, especially tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, snake grows, tail doesn't move, so head collides with the new tail or something.\n\nRule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo, only if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has food that is positive.\n\nIn this state, tail is at (3,6). Head is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (3,6). Adjacent means sharing a side, so (4,3) and (3,6) are not adjacent; distance is |dx| + |dy| = |1| + |3| = 4, not 1. So not adjacent.\n\nTherefore, no immediate tail reward danger.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves to maximize score while surviving.\n\nFirst, let's find a path to food, considering life spans.\n\n(6,2) has short life, only 2 turns left, so I should consider eating it soon if possible.\n\nBut (6,2) is at x=6,y=2. Head at (4,3).\n\nPossible moves from (4,3):\n\n- D to (4,2)\n\n- L to (3,3)\n\n- R to (5,3)\n\nFrom (4,2), I could go to (4,1) or (3,2) or (5,2), but (4,1) might be near wall, y=0 is wall, y=1 is ok.\n\ny=0 is wall, so (4,1) is within bounds.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3) or (5,3).\n\nTo reach (6,2) from (4,3), the shortest path might be right and down or something.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) to (6,2), I can go R to (5,3), then R to (6,3), then D to (6,2). But (6,3) might be blocked or something.\n\nCheck internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (6,3) is not an obstacle, so should be free.\n\nBut snake body: currently, body has (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), none at (6,3) or (6,2).\n\n(6,2) has food, but it's not occupied by snake, so can be eaten.\n\nPath: from (4,3) R to (5,3), then from (5,3) R to (6,3), then from (6,3) D to (6,2). That takes two moves after current? Turn 31: move, say R to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 32: from (5,3) to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 33: to (6,2)\n\nBut (6,2) food has life span 2, meaning at turn 31, life span 2; after turn 31 (turn 32), life span 1; after turn 32 (turn 33), life span 0, disappears. So on turn 33, it disappears, so I can eat it only on turn 31 or 32.\n\nIf I move to (6,2) on turn 33, it's gone. So I need to eat it by turn 32.\n\nBut from current position, I can only reach it by turn 32 if I go directly, but from (4,3) to (6,2) is not adjacent; I need at least two moves.\n\nMove to (5,3) on turn 31, then to (6,2) on turn 32? But (5,3) to (6,2) is not a direct move; from (5,3), I can go U, D, L, R to adjacent cells.\n\n(5,3) to (6,2): that would be right and down, but it's diagonal, not adjacent; I can only move to (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3).\n\n(6,2) is adjacent to (6,3), (6,1), (5,2), (7,2) but x=7 wall, so (5,2) or (6,3) or (6,1).\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go to (5,2) or (6,3), both are one step from (6,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is adjacent to (6,2)? (5,2) and (6,2) share x different, y same, so yes, adjacent horizontally.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) adjacent to (6,2) vertically.\n\nSo from (5,3), I can go R to (6,3) or D to (5,2), then next move to (6,2).\n\nBut to reach (6,2) by turn 32, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 31 or 32.\n\nOn turn 31, if I move directly towards it.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move R to (5,3) on turn 31.\n\nThen on turn 32, from (5,3), I can move to (6,2) only if I go diagonally? No, must move to adjacent cell. From (5,3), (6,2) is not adjacent; adjacent are (5,4), (5,2), (6,3), (4,3).\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), which is not adjacent to (5,3); |dx|=1, |dy|=1, not same row or column, so not adjacent. I need to move to a cell that is adjacent to (6,2).\n\nFor example, from (5,3), I can move to (6,3) or (5,2), both adjacent to (6,2).\n\nThen on turn 33, move to (6,2), but by then food is gone.\n\nSince food must be eaten by turn 32, I need to be on (6,2) on turn 31 or 32.\n\nOn turn 31, I am at (4,3), not adjacent to (6,2), so I can't move directly to it.\n\nOn turn 32, I need to be at (6,2), so I must be at an adjacent cell on turn 31.\n\nPossible adjacent cells to (6,2): (6,3), (6,1), (5,2), (7,2) but (7,2) is wall, x=7 wall.\n\nSo (6,3), (6,1), or (5,2).\n\n(6,1) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (6,1) is listed, so obstacle, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is not listed as obstacle, so free.\n\n(6,3) not listed, free.\n\nBut (6,1) is obstacle, so only (6,3) and (5,2) are accessible adjacent cells to (6,2).\n\nOn turn 31, I need to be at one of these to reach (6,2) on turn 32.\n\nBut on turn 31, I am at (4,3). Can I reach (6,3) or (5,2) in one move from (4,3)?\n\n(6,3) is at x=6,y=3; from (4,3), I can go R to (5,3) or R to (6,3)? No, only one step to adjacent; from (4,3) to (6,3) is not adjacent; I can go to (5,3) or (3,3) or (4,2) or (4,4) but not U since direction D, cannot reverse to U.\n\nFrom (4,3), possible moves: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nNone of these are (5,2) or (6,3).\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2; from (4,3), I can go D to (4,2), which is adjacent to (5,2)? (4,2) and (5,2) are adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is adjacent to (6,3).\n\nBut from (4,3), in one move, I can only reach (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is adjacent to (6,3), and (4,2) is adjacent to (5,2).\n\nBut on turn 31, if I move to (5,3), I am at (5,3) on turn 31.\n\nThen on turn 32, I can move to (6,3) or (5,2), both adjacent to (6,2), so from there, I can move to (6,2) on turn 32.\n\nOn turn 32, I move to (6,2), and since food life span decreases after the turn, at the start of turn 32, life span is 1, I move to it and eat it, so it should be possible.\n\nLife span: at turn t1=31, life span is 2. After turn 31, before turn 32, life span decreases to 1. Then on turn 32, if I move to it, I eat it when life span is 1, which is valid. After that, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, if I could have eaten on turn 31, but I can't.\n\nSo if I go to (5,3) on turn 31, then to (6,2) on turn 32? From (5,3), I can go to (5,2) or (6,3), not directly to (6,2).\n\nFrom (5,3), to reach (6,2), I need two moves: e.g., to (6,3) then to (6,2), or to (5,2) then to (6,2).\n\nSo on turn 32, I can be at (6,3) or (5,2), then on turn 33, to (6,2).\n\nBut turn 33 is too late.\n\nI think I confused the turns.\n\nLet me clarify the timing.\n\n- At the beginning of turn t, the state is given.\n\n- I choose an action for turn t.\n\n- After moving, if head is on food, it is eaten.\n\n- Then, life span decreases for all food.\n\n- Turn ends, next turn begins.\n\nSo for food at (6,2), life span 2 at turn 31.\n\nAfter I move on turn 31, if I eat it, life span decreases after eating? Or before?\n\nThe rule: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\" meaning it exists for N turns, including the turn it spawns.\n\nTypically, at turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten on that turn, and after that turn, life span becomes L-1.\n\nIf life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nSo for (6,2), life span 2 at turn 31:\n\n- On turn 31, if I move to (6,2), I eat it, and after turn, life span decreases to 1, but since eaten, it's gone anyway.\n\n- If not eaten on turn 31, after turn 31, life span decreases to 1.\n\n- On turn 32, if I move to it, I eat it when life span is 1, which is valid.\n\n- After turn 32, if not eaten, life span decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turn 31 or 32.\n\nNow, to eat on turn 31, I need to be at (6,2) on turn 31, but I'm at (4,3), not adjacent, impossible.\n\nTo eat on turn 32, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (6,2) on turn 31, so I can move to it on turn 32.\n\nAdjacent cells: (6,3), (5,2), and (6,1) but (6,1) is obstacle, so only (6,3) and (5,2).\n\nOn turn 31, I am at (4,3). Can I reach (6,3) or (5,2) on turn 31? Only by moving to them directly, but from (4,3), I can only move to (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3) on turn 31.\n\n(5,3) is not (6,3) or (5,2); it's adjacent to (6,3), but I am not at (6,3) or (5,2) on turn 31.\n\nAfter moving on turn 31, I am at one of (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3).\n\nNone of these are (6,3) or (5,2), so on turn 32, I cannot move directly to (6,2) because from (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3), (6,2) is not adjacent to any of them.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), (6,2) is not adjacent, as |dx|=1, |dy|=1.\n\nThe only way to (6,2) is via (6,3) or (5,2), so I need to be at one of those first.\n\nBut I can't be there on turn 31, so I cannot reach (6,2) by turn 32; the earliest is turn 33, by which time it's gone.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat the food at (6,2). It will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSo I should ignore this food and focus on others.\n\nNext, food at (3,1), life span 4, so can be eaten on turn 31 to 34.\n\n(1,4) life span 7, turns 31 to 37.\n\n(2,2) life span 10, turns 31 to 40.\n\nNow, head at (4,3).\n\nI need to plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, the snake is currently at positions: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\nAfter moving, the body follows, so if I move down to (4,2), the new positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) and tail (3,6) moves away? When head moves to (4,2), the segment that was at (4,3) becomes part of body, and the tail at (3,6) is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten, tail is removed, so new snake: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — the last segment (3,6) is gone, and (4,6) is now tail.\n\nPositions: before move: [ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ]\n\nAfter move D to (4,2): head to (4,2), then the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to where head was, so (4,3) becomes the new position for the first body segment, but the list is updated.\n\nTypically in snake, when head moves to new cell, it becomes new head, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated unless food is eaten.\n\nSo after moving head to (4,2), the new positions: head (4,2), then the old head (4,3) is now the first body segment, then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) — the tail (3,6) is removed, so the snake has 7 segments, after moving without eating, it should have 6 segments? Let's count.\n\nInitial positions: 7 cells, so length 7.\n\nAfter moving without eating, snake length same, so new head at new position, and the tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head at (4,2), then body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), and tail at (4,6)? The positions shift.\n\nIndex: old head 0: (4,3), after move, new head at (4,2).\n\nThen segment 1: (4,4) moves to old head position (4,3)\n\nSegment 2: (4,5) moves to old segment 1 position (4,4)\n\nSegment 3: (5,5) moves to old segment 2 position (4,5)\n\nSegment 4: (5,6) moves to old segment 3 position (5,5)\n\nSegment 5: (4,6) moves to old segment 4 position (5,6)\n\nSegment 6: (3,6) moves to old segment 5 position (4,6)\n\nThen since no food, the tail is removed, so we don't add a new segment, so the new tail is at (4,6), which was moved to from (3,6).\n\nNew positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n\n(5,6) and (4,6) are both there.\n\nOld segment 4: (5,6) moves to old segment 3 position (5,5)? Old segment 3 is (5,5), position (5,5).\n\nOld positions:\n\nIndex 0: head (4,3)\n\nIndex 1: body (4,4)\n\nIndex 2: (4,5)\n\nIndex 3: (5,5)\n\nIndex 4: (5,6)\n\nIndex 5: (4,6)\n\nIndex 6: tail (3,6)\n\nAfter head moves to (4,2):\n\nNew head: (4,2)\n\nNew body: the segment that was index 1 moves to where index 0 was, so to (4,3)\n\nSegment that was index 2 moves to where index 1 was, so to (4,4)\n\nSegment that was index 3 moves to where index 2 was, so to (4,5)\n\nSegment that was index 4 moves to where index 3 was, so to (5,5)\n\nSegment that was index 5 moves to where index 4 was, so to (5,6)\n\nSegment that was index 6 moves to where index 5 was, so to (4,6)\n\nThen, since no food, we remove the last segment, so the new snake is positions from new head to the segment that moved to index 5 position: so (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), and (4,6) is the new tail? The segment that was index 6 moved to (4,6), but it is removed, so the last position is where index 5 moved to, which is (5,6).\n\nList of new positions:\n\n- New head: (4,2)\n\n- Body: (4,3)  // old head position\n\n- (4,4)  // old index1 position\n\n- (4,5)  // old index2 position\n\n- (5,5)  // old index3 position\n\n- (5,6)  // old index4 position\n\n- And the segment that was at (4,6) (old index5) is now at (5,6)? No:\n\nWhen moving, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n\nSo:\n\n- New head at (4,2)\n\n- The first body segment is at the old head position (4,3)\n\n- The second body segment is at the old first body position (4,4)\n\n- Third at old second body position (4,5)\n\n- Fourth at old third body position (5,5)\n\n- Fifth at old fourth body position (5,6)\n\n- Sixth at old fifth body position (4,6)\n\nThen, since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so we have only from head to the sixth segment, but the sixth segment is at (4,6), and it is the tail.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), then body segments at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), and tail at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is the tail.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (3,3): new head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) tail.\n\nOr right to (5,3): new head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) tail.\n\n(4,6) is the tail in all cases, since it was the last body segment before tail.\n\nIn the initial list, (3,6) was tail, but after move, it is gone.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nSince (6,2) is unattainable, ignore it.\n\nNow, other food: (3,1) at (3,1), which is close to head.\n\nHead at (4,3), (3,1) is at x=3,y=1.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move L to (3,3), then D to (3,2), then D to (3,1).\n\nOr from (4,3) D to (4,2), then L to (3,2), then D to (3,1), etc.\n\n(3,1) has life span 4, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) at (2,2), value 1, life 10.\n\n(1,4) at (1,4), life 7.\n\nAlso, there is internal obstacle at (1,2), (2,4), etc.\n\nI need to think about long-term survival. The snake is in the top-right area, but let's see the grid.\n\nGrid:\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7 left to right, y from 0 to 7 bottom to top? Usually in coordinates, (0,0) bottom left, but in terms of movement, U y+1, D y-1, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top.\n\nBut for visualization, I can think of y=0 as row 0, y=7 row 7.\n\nSet up a grid:\n\nRow y=7: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\nBut walls at y=0 and y=7, so rows 1 to 6 are playable? y from 0 to 7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=1 to 6 are free, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are the inner rows? No.\n\nCells: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so these are borders, cannot be occupied.\n\nAlso internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSo free cells are all except walls and obstacles.\n\nSnake at: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n\nFood at: (6,2) but will disappear soon, (3,1), (1,4), (2,2)\n\n(1,4) is at x=1,y=4, which might be near obstacle (1,2) and (2,4) is obstacle.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle, so (2,4) is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) blocked.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat food, but avoid getting trapped.\n\nAlso, the snake is quite long, 7 segments, so I need space to move.\n\nCurrent head direction D, so moving down.\n\nPossible actions at turn 31: D, L, R.\n\nIf I move D to (4,2): then snake to (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n\nTail at (4,6)\n\nThen from there, I can go to food.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), from (4,2), I can go L to (3,2), then D to (3,1), eat on turn 33 if I start from turn 31.\n\nTurn 31: D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 32: from (4,2), move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 33: from (3,2), move D to (3,1), eat food at (3,1), life span: at turn 31, life span 4; after turn 31, 3; turn 32, after move, if I eat on turn 33, life span at start turn 33 is 2 (since after turn 32 it decreases to 2? Let's track.\n\nAt turn 31: food (3,1) life span 4\n\nAfter turn 31 action, if not eaten, life span decreases to 3.\n\nTurn 32: life span 3\n\nAfter turn 32 action, if not eaten, decreases to 2.\n\nTurn 33: life span 2, if I move to (3,1), I eat it.\n\nSimilarly, it can be eaten until turn 34.\n\nSo yes, possible.\n\nFrom (4,2), I could go to (2,2) or other food.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), from (4,2), I can go L to (3,2), then L to (2,2), but (2,2) has food, and life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to check obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) is not, so ok.\n\nAlso, (1,4) is another food.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nIf I move L at turn 31 to (3,3): then new head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) tail.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go D to (3,2), then to (3,1) or to (2,2).\n\n(3,1) is close.\n\nIf I move R to (5,3) at turn 31: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) tail.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other areas, but (3,1) is left, so it might be farther.\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), which is top-left, but there is obstacle at (2,4), so to reach (1,4), I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), I could go L to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, collision? When I move, the body shifts, so (4,3) is body, but if I move to (4,3), it is occupied by the first body segment, so collision.\n\nIn the new position after move, (4,3) is a body cell, so I cannot move there.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\nBut (4,3) is body, so moving there would collide, deadly.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) : is it free? Current body: after moving to (5,3), body at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n\n(5,4) is not in this list, and not wall or obstacle, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) free, (6,3) free.\n\nBut (6,4) is obstacle, so (6,3) is ok.\n\nSo from (5,3), I can go U, D, R, but not L because (4,3) is body.\n\nDirection: after moving to (5,3), the head direction is R if I moved right, so I can move U, D, R, not L (opposite of R? L is left, which is opposite of R, so cannot move L instantly.\n\nHead direction after move: if I move R at turn 31, new direction R, so at turn 32, I can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D at turn 31, new direction D, so can move L, R, D, not U.\n\netc.\n\nBut back to food.\n\n(3,1) is the closest food, at distance |dx| + |dy| = |1| + |2| = 3 from (4,3), so I can reach it in 3 moves.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) at |2| + |1| = 3, same distance.\n\n(1,4) at |3| + |1| = 4.\n\nBut with obstacles, path may be longer.\n\nSince all food is positive, eating any is good, but I should prioritize based on life span, but (3,1) has shorter life span (4) compared to (2,2) life 10 and (1,4) life 7, so (3,1) should be eaten sooner.\n\n(3,1) life span 4, meaning it can be eaten until turn 34, so I have time, but it's closer.\n\n(6,2) is expiring soon but unreachable, so ignore.\n\nNow, another thing: tail reward danger. Currently tail at (3,6), head at (4,3), not adjacent. But after moves, it might become close.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,2) and (1,4) are near obstacles, so I need to be careful not to get trapped.\n\nFor example, to reach (1,4), I need to go to (1,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, so from (1,3) or (0,4) wall, so only from (1,3) or (1,5), etc.\n\n(1,4) adjacent cells: (1,3), (1,5), (0,4) wall, (2,4) obstacle, so only (1,3) and (1,5) are accessible.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,2), adjacent: (2,1), (2,3), (1,2) obstacle, (3,2), so (2,1), (2,3), (3,2).\n\nBut (2,1) is free, (2,3) free, (3,2) free.\n\nNow, let's plan a sequence to eat (3,1) first.\n\nAt turn 31, from (4,3), move L to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 32, from (3,3), move D to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 33, from (3,2), move D to (3,1), eat food.\n\nWhen I eat, snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nTurn 33: move to (3,1), eat food, so new head (3,1), and the body includes the previous positions, with tail not removed, so snake longer.\n\nBut let's not worry about that now.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), I can go to other food.\n\nBut there is food at (2,2) and (1,4).\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go to (2,2) or to (3,0) but y=0 wall, so only to (2,1) or (4,1) or (3,2), but (3,2) might be body or not.\n\nI need to simulate.\n\nFirst, let's decide on turn 31 action.\n\nIf I move L to (3,3), then as above.\n\nIf I move D to (4,2), then to (3,2) on turn 32, then to (3,1) on turn 33.\n\nSame thing, but from (4,2) to (3,2) is left, then to (3,1) down.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,2) down, then to (3,1) down.\n\nBut from (4,3) moving L to (3,3) might be better because it gets me closer to (3,1) directly.\n\nMoving D to (4,2) also gets me closer in y-direction.\n\nBut let's see the state after.\n\nAnother consideration: the tail is at (3,6), which is far, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut after moving, the tail moves.\n\nAlso, I need to think about long-term, like after eating (3,1), where to go.\n\nThere is also food at (2,2), which is near.\n\n(2,2) at (2,2), from (3,1) I can go to (2,1) or (3,2) or (4,1), but (4,1) might be near obstacle or not.\n\nObstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, so (4,1) is free.\n\nBut let's not jump ahead.\n\nPerhaps I should plan to eat multiple food.\n\nSince (1,4) has longer life, I can eat (3,1) first, then (2,2), then (1,4).\n\nBut to reach (1,4), I need to go around the obstacle at (2,4).\n\nFor example, from (3,1) or (2,2), I can go to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,4).\n\n(2,3) is free, (1,3) free, (1,4) food.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so I can't go directly.\n\nNow, life span of (1,4) is 7, so turn 31 to 37, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly for (2,2).\n\nBut I need to ensure I don't trap myself.\n\nAnother food: (2,2) at (2,2), but there is an internal obstacle at (1,2), so (2,2) is not blocked, but adjacent to obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) near (2,4) obstacle.\n\nNow, for turn 31, let's choose to move towards (3,1).\n\nEither L or D.\n\nIf I move L to (3,3), then I am at (3,3) with direction L.\n\nThen turn 32, I can move D to (3,2) (since not reverse, L opposite is R, so I can move D, U, L? Head direction after moving L to (3,3) is L, so at turn 32, I can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3) but R is opposite of L, so cannot move R.\n\nAnd (4,3) is body, so cannot anyway.\n\nU to (3,4): is it free? Current body after turn 31: if moved L to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n\n(3,4) not in body, not wall or obstacle, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) free, (2,3) free.\n\nSo I can move D to (3,2) or U or L.\n\nBut to go to (3,1), I should move D to (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I move D at turn 31 to (4,2), then from (4,2), I can move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1) or U to (4,3) but U is opposite of D? After moving D, direction D, so at turn 32, I can move L, R, D, not U.\n\nU to (4,3) is body, so cannot.\n\nL to (3,2) or R to (5,2) or D to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is free, (5,2) free, but (5,1) obstacle, so (5,2) is ok.\n\nBut to go to (3,1), from (4,2) move L to (3,2), then to (3,1).\n\nSame as from (3,3) move D to (3,2), then to (3,1).\n\nSo both paths similar.\n\nBut moving L at turn 31 might be better because it gets me to x=3, closer to (2,2) for later.\n\n(2,2) is at x=2,y=2.\n\nFrom (3,3), after eating (3,1), I am at (3,1), then to (2,2) is easy: from (3,1) move L to (2,1) or U to (3,2), then to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) from (3,1) is not adjacent, |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so not directly, need to move to (2,1) or (3,2) or (2,3), then to (2,2).\n\nFor example, from (3,1) move to (2,1), then to (2,2).\n\nOr to (3,2), then to (2,2).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's not optimize too much.\n\nFirst, for turn 31, I think moving L to (3,3) is fine.\n\nThen turn 32, from (3,3) move D to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 33, from (3,2) move D to (3,1), eat food.\n\nNow, after eating, snake grows, so when I move to (3,1) on turn 33, I eat, so new head at (3,1), and the tail does not move, so the body includes all previous positions plus new segment at the old tail position.\n\nBefore turn 33 move: at turn 33 start, positions depend on previous.\n\nLet's simulate the positions.\n\nTurn 31: move L to (3,3)\n\nAfter move, snake: head (3,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)  // tail at (4,6)\n\nNo food eaten, so length 7.\n\nTurn 32: move D to (3,2)\n\nNew head (3,2), body: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)  // tail at (5,6)? Old positions: head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), tail (4,6)\n\nAfter head moves to (3,2):\n\nNew head (3,2)\n\nBody: segment to old head position (3,3)\n\nThen segment to old first body position (4,3)\n\nThen to (4,4)\n\nThen to (4,5)\n\nThen to (5,5)\n\nThen to (5,6)  // old index 4 position? Old index: 0 head (3,3), 1 (4,3), 2 (4,4), 3 (4,5), 4 (5,5), 5 (5,6), 6 (4,6)\n\nAfter move:\n\nNew head (3,2)\n\nNew body: at (3,3) // old head\n\nAt (4,3) // old index1\n\nAt (4,4) // old index2\n\nAt (4,5) // old index3\n\nAt (5,5) // old index4\n\nAt (5,6) // old index5\n\nThen the old tail (4,6) is removed, so new tail at (5,6)\n\nPositions: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nTail at (5,6)\n\nTurn 33: move D to (3,1)\n\nNow, (3,1) has food, so I eat it.\n\nNew head (3,1), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so the new body is the previous positions, with the tail segment still there, and a new segment added at the end.\n\nSpecifically: new head at (3,1), then the first body segment at old head position (3,2), then (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), and the old tail (5,6) remains, so new positions: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nLength 8.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to (2,2) or other food.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is adjacent to (3,2)? (3,2) is now body, so I cannot move to (2,2) directly if it's occupied, but (2,2) is food, so it might be free.\n\n(2,2) is a food position, not occupied by snake, so I can move to it.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move to (2,1), (3,0) wall, (4,1), or (3,2) but (3,2) is body, so cannot move there.\n\nPossible moves from (3,1): L to (2,1), R to (4,1), U to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision, so cannot.\n\nD to (3,0) wall, impossible.\n\nSo only L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nHead direction after moving D to (3,1) is D, so at turn 34, I can move L, R, D, not U.\n\nBut U to (3,2) is body, so not possible anyway.\n\nSo I can move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\n(2,1) is free, (4,1) free.\n\n(2,2) is food at (2,2), which is adjacent to (2,1), so if I move to (2,1), then next move to (2,2) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is near (5,1) obstacle, but (4,1) is free.\n\nBut to eat (2,2), better to go to (2,1).\n\nSo at turn 34, from (3,1) move L to (2,1)\n\nThen turn 35, from (2,1) move U to (2,2), eat food.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) life span 10, so ok.\n\nThen after that, I can go to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) at (1,4), from (2,2), I can move to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,4).\n\n(2,3) is free, (1,3) free, etc.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, for turn 31, I need to output action.\n\nI think moving L is good.\n\nBut what about the other food (1,4)? It might be forgotten, but I can go there after.\n\nPerhaps I should consider moving towards multiple food.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (3,1) and (2,2), the snake is longer, and I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, near (1,4), with obstacle at (2,4), it might be tight.\n\nBut I can go to (1,4) from left or bottom.\n\nFrom (2,2), after eating, I can go to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,4).\n\n(1,3) to (1,4) is up.\n\nThen from (1,4), I can go to other areas.\n\nBut the grid has obstacles, so I need to see the free space.\n\nFor now, I think the plan is ok.\n\nTo think 5+ turns ahead, I should outline the sequence.\n\nTurn 31: move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 32: move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 33: move D to (3,1) eat food\n\nThen turn 34: from (3,1) move L to (2,1)  // since only choices L or R, and L to (2,1) towards (2,2)\n\nAfter turn 33, head at (3,1), direction D.\n\nAt turn 34, move L to (2,1)\n\nNew head (2,1), body: old positions shift, and since no food, tail removed or not? After turn 33, I ate food, so when I moved to (3,1), I ate, so snake grew to 8.\n\nAt turn 34, move from (3,1) to (2,1), no food at (2,1), so no eat.\n\nNew head (2,1), body: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), and tail? Old tail (5,6) but after growth.\n\nAfter turn 33: positions (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nHead (3,1), tail (5,6)\n\nMove to (2,1): new head (2,1), body: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)  // old tail (5,6) removed? Since no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nWhen moving without eating, the tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)  // tail at (5,5)\n\nLength 8, but since no eat, length same, so from 8 segments, after move, 8 segments but positions shift.\n\nOld positions: 8 cells.\n\nAfter move: new head (2,1), then each body segment moves to previous position: so (3,1) to old head (3,1)? Standard: new head at new position, first body segment at old head position, second at old first body, etc.\n\nOld head at (3,1), new head to (2,1)\n\nFirst body segment at old head position (3,1)\n\nSecond body segment at old first body position (3,2)\n\nThird at old second body (3,3)\n\nFourth at old third (4,3)\n\nFifth at old fourth (4,4)\n\nSixth at old fifth (4,5)\n\nSeventh at old sixth (5,5)\n\nOld tail (5,6) was the last, but since no eat, it is removed, so the new tail is at (5,5), which was moved to from old sixth.\n\nNew positions: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nTail at (5,5)\n\nThen turn 35: move U to (2,2) to eat food at (2,2)\n\n(2,2) has food, so move to (2,2), eat.\n\nNew head (2,2), body: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) and since eat, tail not removed, so add new segment at old tail position (5,5), so positions: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)  // (5,5) repeated? No.\n\nNew head (2,2)\n\nFirst body segment at old head (2,1)\n\nSecond at old first body (3,1)\n\nThird at old second (3,2)\n\nFourth at old third (3,3)\n\nFifth at old fourth (4,3)\n\nSixth at old fifth (4,4)\n\nSeventh at old sixth (4,5)\n\nEighth at old seventh (5,5)  // old tail position, and since eat, it stays, so new tail at (5,5)\n\nPositions: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nLength 9.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can go to (1,4) via (2,3), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nAt turn 36, from (2,2), head direction U (since moved U to (2,2)), so can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3), L to (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle, cannot, R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision, D to (2,1) but D is opposite of U? Direction U, so cannot move D, and (2,1) is body anyway.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) should be free.\n\nThen move to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 37, from (2,3) to (1,3) L, since L is possible.\n\nThen turn 38, from (1,3) to (1,4) U, eat.\n\nBut (1,4) life span 7, at turn 31, so on turn 38, it might be gone? Turn 31: life span 7, so after turn 31:6, t32:5, t33:4, t34:3, t35:2, t36:1, t37:0? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 31: life span 7\n\nAfter turn 31: decrease to 6\n\nTurn 32:6\n\nAfter turn 32:5\n\nTurn 33:5\n\nAfter turn 33:4? After each turn, before next, life span decreases.\n\nAt start of turn t, life span is L, after action, if not eaten, decreases by 1.\n\nIf eaten during turn, it is removed.\n\nFor (1,4), life span 7 at turn 31.\n\nAfter turn 31: not eaten, decrease to 6\n\nTurn 32: life span 6\n\nAfter turn 32: decrease to 5\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 37: if not eaten, decrease to 0, disappear.\n\nOn turn 38, it would be gone, so I need to eat by turn 37.\n\nIn my plan, on turn 38 I move to (1,4), too late.\n\nTurn 37: at start, life span? After turn 36, life span decreases to what.\n\nTurn 31: L=7\n\nAfter turn 31: L=6\n\nTurn 32: L=6\n\nAfter turn 32: L=5\n\nTurn 33: L=5\n\nAfter turn 33: L=4\n\nTurn 34: L=4\n\nAfter turn 34: L=3\n\nTurn 35: L=3\n\nAfter turn 35: L=2\n\nTurn 36: L=2\n\nAfter turn 36: L=1\n\nTurn 37: L=1\n\nAfter turn 37: if not eaten, L=0, disappear.\n\nSo on turn 37, I can eat it when L=1.\n\nIn my plan, on turn 37, I am at (2,3) after moving from (2,2) to (2,3) on turn 36.\n\nThen turn 37, from (2,3) I can move to (1,3) or to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, or (3,3) body, or (2,2) but (2,2) was eaten, so free? After eating (2,2) on turn 35, it is gone, so (2,2) is empty now.\n\nBut from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4) obstacle, D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\n(2,2) is free, (1,3) free, (3,3) is body? After turn 36, positions.\n\nI need to simulate.\n\nAfter turn 35: after eating (2,2), positions: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)  // head (2,2), tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 36: move U to (2,3)  // since only choice\n\nNew head (2,3), no food, so tail removed: body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // old tail (5,5) removed? New positions: head (2,3), body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4) and tail? Old positions: 9 segments.\n\nAfter move without eat: new head (2,3), body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), and the old tail (5,5) is removed, so new tail at (4,4)\n\nPositions: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nTail at (4,4)\n\nTurn 37: from (2,3), move to (1,3) L, or to (2,2) D, or to (3,3) R.\n\n(1,3) has food? No, food at (1,4), not (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is free.\n\nMove L to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 38, from (1,3) move U to (1,4) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 37, (1,4) is still there with L=1, but I move to (1,3), not to (1,4).\n\nThen on turn 38, move to (1,4), but after turn 37, L decreases to 0, so on turn 38, it is gone.\n\nTurn 37: at start, L=1 for (1,4)\n\nIf I move to (1,4) on turn 37, I can eat it.\n\nBut from (2,3), I can move directly to (1,3) or (2,2), but not to (1,4), which is not adjacent.\n\n(1,4) is adjacent to (1,3) and (1,5), etc.\n\nSo I need to be at (1,3) or (1,5) to move to (1,4).\n\nOn turn 37, from (2,3), I move to (1,3), then on turn 38 to (1,4), but turn 38 too late.\n\nOn turn 37, if I were at (1,3), I could move to (1,4), but I am at (2,3) on turn 37.\n\nSo I cannot eat (1,4) on turn 37; the earliest is turn 38, but it disappears after turn 37.\n\nTherefore, with this path, I miss (1,4).\n\nTo eat (1,4), I need to reach it by turn 37.\n\nFrom current position at turn 31, I am at (4,3).\n\nTo reach (1,4) in fewer moves.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), I could move L to (3,3) on turn 31.\n\nThen turn 32, move L to (2,3) (since direction L, can move L, U, D, not R).\n\n(2,3) is free.\n\nThen turn 33, from (2,3) move L to (1,3) or U to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so only L to (1,3) or D to (2,2) or R to (3,3) body.\n\nSo move L to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 34, from (1,3) move U to (1,4) to eat.\n\nOn turn 34, (1,4) L= at turn 31:7, after t31:6, t32:5, after t32:4, t33:4, after t33:3, t34:3, so on turn 34, L=3, can eat.\n\nThen I can eat (1,4) on turn 34.\n\nBut I have other food to eat.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (3,1) or (2,2).\n\nBut (3,1) has life span 4, so by turn 34, it can be eaten, but on turn 34, I am at (1,4), far from (3,1).\n\n(3,1) must be eaten by turn 34.\n\nAt turn 34, if I am at (1,4), I can't reach (3,1) in one move.\n\nDistance is large, so I might miss (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) has longer life.\n\nSo I need to prioritize based on life span.\n\n(3,1) life 4, must eat by turn 34.\n\n(1,4) life 7, by turn 37.\n\n(2,2) life 10, by turn 40.\n\nSo (3,1) is urgent.\n\nWith the first plan, I can eat (3,1) on turn 33.\n\nThen (2,2) on turn 35.\n\nBut (1,4) I miss because I can't reach in time.\n\nTo eat both, I could go directly to (1,4) but it's farther, and I might miss (3,1).\n\nSince (3,1) is closer and more urgent, I should eat it first, and accept missing (1,4) if necessary.\n\nBut (1,4) has the same value, so it's ok to miss one food if I eat others.\n\nThere is also (2,2) which I can eat.\n\nSo in the first plan, I eat (3,1) and (2,2), and (1,4) might be eaten by someone else or disappear later, but since no other snake, it just disappears.\n\nSo for survival, I should avoid risks.\n\nIn the area near (1,4), with obstacles, it might be risky to go there with long snake.\n\nFor example, after eating (1,4), I might be trapped.\n\nWhereas after eating (3,1) and (2,2), I am in the bottom-left, with more space.\n\nLet's see the grid.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), I can go to (3,2), (2,3), etc., and there are no obstacles in bottom-left except (1,2) and (2,4), but I can avoid.\n\n(5,1) is obstacle, but far.\n\nSo probably safer to eat (3,1) and (2,2).\n\nFor turn 31, I will move L to (3,3).\n\nThen the sequence as before.\n\nBut for the output, I need to provide actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince the question is to output for turns starting from t1, I should list at least 5 turns.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,2) is expiring, but we can't reach it, so ignore.\n\nAnother point: special case, food can spawn under body, but here, the foods are not under snake, so no issue.\n\nTail reward danger not present.\n\nSo I think for turn 31: L\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: D (eat (3,1))\n\nThen turn 34: L (to (2,1))\n\nTurn 35: U (to (2,2) eat)\n\nBut turn 34 and 35 depend on the state.\n\nIn the answer, I can list the actions based on the plan.\n\nTo be precise, I'll list for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 31: L\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nThen for turn 34, from (3,1) with direction D, move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 35: from (2,1) with direction L (since moved L), move U to (2,2)\n\nDirection: after turn 33 move D to (3,1), direction D.\n\nTurn 34, move L to (2,1), so new direction L.\n\nTurn 35, move U to (2,2), direction U.\n\nThen I can continue, but for 5 turns, up to turn 35.\n\nThe output should be in the boxed format.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,2) is eaten on turn 35, which is fine.\n\n(1,4) might not be eaten, but it's ok.\n\nSo I think this is a plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead (turns 31 to 35), prioritizing the consumption of high-value food with imminent expiration and avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's body. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - Food at (6,2) has a life span of 2 (expires after turn 32) but is unreachable by turn 32 due to distance and obstacles, so it is ignored.\n  - Food at (3,1) has a life span of 4 (must be eaten by turn 34) and is the closest positive food (Manhattan distance 3 from head). It is prioritized for immediate consumption.\n  - Food at (2,2) has a life span of 10 (eaten by turn 40) and can be targeted after (3,1).\n  - Food at (1,4) has a life span of 7 (eaten by turn 37) but is riskier due to nearby obstacles and may not be reachable within its life span after consuming (3,1) and (2,2); long-term survival takes precedence.\n\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - Current head direction is down (D), so reverse move (U) is not allowed on turn 31.\n  - Avoid body collisions: after each move, the body shifts, so collision checks are based on the new head position not overlapping with body segments (except the tail, which moves).\n  - Wall and obstacle cells are avoided: borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)].\n\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Tail reward danger is not present initially (head at (4,3) not adjacent to tail at (3,6)), and the sequence ensures the head does not become adjacent to the tail with food on the tail cell.\n  - The sequence avoids dead ends and maintains open space for movement after eating.\n\n### Planned Sequence (5 Turns)\n- **Turn 31 (from (4,3))**: Move left (L) to (3,3). This moves toward (3,1) and positions the snake for efficient food access. Direction becomes L. Valid moves: L is allowed (not reverse of D), (3,3) is free (not wall, obstacle, or body).  \n- **Turn 32 (from (3,3))**: Move down (D) to (3,2). This continues toward (3,1). Direction becomes D. Valid moves: D is allowed (not reverse of L), (3,2) is free.  \n- **Turn 33 (from (3,2))**: Move down (D) to (3,1) and eat the food (score +1, snake grows). Direction becomes D. Valid moves: D is allowed, (3,1) has food and is free.  \n- **Turn 34 (from (3,1))**: Move left (L) to (2,1). This moves toward (2,2). Direction becomes L. Valid moves: Only L and R are possible (U to (3,2) is body collision; D to (3,0) is wall; R to (4,1) is possible but L is better for (2,2)). (2,1) is free.  \n- **Turn 35 (from (2,1))**: Move up (U) to (2,2) and eat the food (score +1, snake grows). Direction becomes U. Valid moves: U is allowed (not reverse of L), (2,2) has food and is free (not body; body positions do not include (2,2) after shifts).\n\n### Long-Term Considerations (Beyond Turn 35)\n- After eating (2,2), the snake is at (2,2) with direction U. Possible moves include U to (2,3) to access the top-left area, but (1,4) may expire by turn 37 and is risky due to obstacles (e.g., (2,4)). Since (1,4) has lower priority and survival is key, it may be skipped if the path is unsafe. Instead, the snake can navigate to open areas (e.g., via (3,2) or (2,3)) to avoid traps.  \n- No tail reward danger is expected, as the tail (initially at (5,5) after turn 35) moves away from the head.  \n- This plan eats two positive foods by turn 35, increasing the score by 2 and snake length to 9, while maintaining a safe path.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 31\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35\\text{: U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 32, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid seems to be from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid. Walls are at the borders, meaning x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also, there are internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,3), then body segments at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is left, so it was moving left to (3,3) from (4,3), I assume. Let's list the positions in order:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Then (4,3) — that's the neck, I suppose. Positions are given as a list: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)]\n\nSince head is at (3,3) and direction is L (left), that means it came from (4,3) to (3,3), so the previous move was left.\n\nNow food items:\n\n- (6,2) with life_span=1, value=1 (positive)\n\n- (3,1) with life_span=3, value=1 (positive)\n\n- (1,4) with life_span=6, value=1 (positive)\n\n- (2,2) with life_span=9, value=1 (positive)\n\nAll food here is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span decreasing each turn.\n\nLife span: for (6,2), life_span=1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten. Since we're at turn 32, if not eaten now, it will be gone by next turn.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So if life_span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten for N more turns starting from now? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo, for food at (6,2) with life_span=1: at turn 32, it has life_span=1, so it can be eaten on turn 32, and then it disappears; it won't be there on turn 33.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) with life_span=3: can be eaten on turns 32,33,34; disappears after turn 34.\n\n(1,4) with life_span=6: turns 32 to 37.\n\n(2,2) with life_span=9: turns 32 to 40.\n\nNow, my goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I need to think at least 5 turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nAlso, movement constraints: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since head direction is L (left), I cannot move right on the next turn because that would be opposite direction.\n\nPossible moves from current head position (3,3):\n\n- Up: (3,4) but y+1 is up, I think. Let's define coordinates. Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but from movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I assume. D is (x,y-1), so y decreases down. L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y).\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Probably, since U is y+1.\n\nIn the snake positions, for example, (5,6) and (4,6), y=6 is high, so likely y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSo from (3,3):\n\n- U: (3,4)\n\n- D: (3,2)\n\n- L: (2,3) — but head direction is L, so moving left is fine.\n\n- R: (4,3) — but R is opposite to L, so I cannot move right because of no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, meaning it was moving left to (3,3). So on next move, I cannot move right (opposite direction).\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, L (since L is same direction, but I can change to U or D as long as not opposite).\n\nNo instant reverse means I cannot move in the direction opposite to current head direction on the very next turn.\n\nSo from current, head dir L, I can move U, D, or L, but not R.\n\nNow, let's see what cells are occupied or dangerous.\n\nFirst, snake body positions: (3,3) is head, so not body for collision.\n\nBody segments: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n\n(4,6) is the tail, I think.\n\nList: positions: index 0: head (3,3), index 1: (4,3), index 2: (4,4), index 3: (4,5), index 4: (5,5), index 5: (5,6), index 6: (4,6) — that's 7 segments, so tail is (4,6).\n\nWhen snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, and tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is vacated, unless it grows by eating.\n\nIf it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n\nNo eating, tail moves and that cell is free.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when head moves to a cell, if that cell will be occupied by a body segment after movement, it collides.\n\nBut specifically, after moving, if head is on the same cell as any body segment except that the tail might have moved, so it's safe to move to the tail cell only if the tail moves away.\n\nStandard snake rules: when you move, the head goes to new position, each segment shifts, so the old tail position is vacated. So if head moves to where the tail was, it's ok because the tail moves forward, so no collision.\n\nBut if head moves to a body segment that is not the tail, it collides.\n\nAlso, if head moves to a wall or obstacle, collision.\n\nIn this case, walls include borders and internal obstacles.\n\nSo let's list all blocked cells: walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo any cell that is wall or obstacle is deadly.\n\nNow, for possible moves from (3,3):\n\n- U to (3,4): what is at (3,4)? Is it free?\n\nCurrent occupied: snake positions: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n\n(3,4) is not in this list, so not occupied by snake body.\n\nIs it a wall or obstacle? x=3, y=4; borders: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,4) is not border. Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (2,4) is obstacle? (2,4) is listed, so (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) not wall, not obstacle.\n\nBut we need to see after move.\n\nSimilarly, D to (3,2): (3,2) not in snake positions? Snake has (3,3), (4,3), etc., no (3,2). Not border (y=0 is wall, y=2 is not), obstacles: (5,1), (1,2), (2,4), etc. (1,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) is not, so free.\n\nL to (2,3): (2,3) not in snake positions, not border (x=0 wall, x=2 not), obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nR to (4,3): but (4,3) is the first body segment, currently occupied. But after move, if I move right to (4,3), but (4,3) is where the neck is, which will move to head position? When I move, the head moves to new cell, and each segment moves to next.\n\nIf I move right to (4,3), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. After move, the head would be at (4,3), but the first body segment will move to (3,3), which is the old head. But (4,3) was occupied, and head is moving there, so at the time of move, (4,3) has a body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nGeneral rule: before moving, if the cell the head is moving to is occupied by a body segment (except the tail), it will collide. If it's the tail, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, (4,3) is the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is (4,6). So moving to (4,3) would cause head to collide with body at (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, if I move to a cell that will be occupied after the move, but it's messy.\n\nSimpler: at the time of decision, the cell the head moves to must be empty or the tail cell, because the tail will move.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If head moves to an empty cell, fine.\n\n- If head moves to the current tail cell, then after move, tail moves away, so head is at that cell, no problem.\n\n- If head moves to any other body segment cell, collision.\n\n- If head moves to wall or obstacle, collision.\n\nHere, from (3,3), moving to:\n\n- U: (3,4) — not occupied, not wall, not obstacle, so safe.\n\n- D: (3,2) — similarly, free, safe.\n\n- L: (2,3) — free, safe.\n\n- R: (4,3) — currently occupied by body segment (index 1), not tail (tail is (4,6)), so moving there would collide. Also, since it's not empty, unsafe.\n\nMoreover, R is opposite direction, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible safe moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and future moves.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (6,2): life_span=1, so must be eaten this turn (turn 32) or it disappears.\n\n- (3,1): life_span=3, can be eaten in next 3 turns.\n\n- (1,4): life_span=6, longer.\n\n- (2,2): life_span=9, even longer.\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), which is near the right border.\n\nCurrent head at (3,3), so (6,2) is 3 steps right and 1 down, but not directly.\n\nGrid: from (3,3) to (6,2): delta x=3, delta y=-1, so not adjacent.\n\nTo eat (6,2) on this turn, I need to move directly to it, but I'm at (3,3), it's at (6,2), not adjacent, so I can't eat it this turn anyway. Only if I were adjacent, but I'm not.\n\nAdjacent cells to head (3,3) are: (3,4) up, (3,2) down, (2,3) left, (4,3) right. But (4,3) is body, so not accessible for eating or moving.\n\nFood at (6,2) is not adjacent to head, so I can't eat it immediately. Since life_span=1, after this turn it disappears, so I can't eat it at all because I can't reach it in one move.\n\nLife_span=1 means it can be eaten on this turn only, but since I'm not adjacent, I can't eat it now, so it will disappear. So (6,2) is not achievable; forget about it.\n\nSimilarly, other food:\n\n(3,1) at (3,1), which is two steps down from head (3,3): (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1). But (3,1) might have obstacles or something.\n\n(3,1): is it free? Not occupied by snake, not wall (y=1>0), obstacles: internal obstacles include (5,1), (6,1), but not (3,1), so should be free.\n\n(1,4) at (1,4), left and up from (3,3).\n\n(2,2) at (2,2), left and down.\n\nNow, also, I need to consider the grid and possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0-7, y 0-7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo let's list all blocked cells:\n\n- Walls: all (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7, (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7. But since borders, cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls.\n\nBut for movement, we care about specific cells.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow snake positions: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n\nSo current occupied cells by snake: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n\n(4,6) is tail.\n\nNow for turn 32, I need to choose action: U, D, or L.\n\nI should think about future turns.\n\nAlso, there might be food under snake body? But the food positions are given, and none are under snake except possibly, but let's see.\n\nFood: (6,2), (3,1), (1,4), (2,2)\n\nSnake positions: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n\nNone of these food are at snake positions, so all are on free cells.\n\n(6,2) is free but will disappear after this turn.\n\nSince I can't reach it this turn, it's gone.\n\nSo remaining food: (3,1), life_span 3; (1,4), life_span 6; (2,2), life_span 9.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat them while avoiding dead ends or collisions.\n\nAlso, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's consider possible moves from (3,3):\n\n- Move U to (3,4): then head at (3,4), and body shifts: new positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) — tail was (4,6), but since no eat, tail moves away, so (4,6) is free now. Body segments: after move, segments: [ (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] — since tail moved from (4,6) to (5,6)? Let's see: the position list: before move, snake: [ (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (3,4), the new head is (3,4), then the first body segment moves to old head (3,3), second to old first body (4,3), and so on, up to the tail: the sixth segment moves to old fifth (5,6), and the tail (seventh) moves to old sixth (4,6)? Indices: let's say positions indexed from 0 to 6, head 0, tail 6.\n\nAfter move, head moves to new position, segment 1 moves to pos[0], segment 2 to pos[1], ..., segment 6 moves to pos[5], and pos[6] is vacated.\n\nSo new snake: [new_head, old[0], old[1], ..., old[5] ]\n\nSo after moving to (3,4): new positions: [ (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] — and (4,6) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (3,2): new snake [ (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] — tail (4,6) moves to (5,6) or? After move: head to (3,2), then segment 1 to old head (3,3), segment 2 to old seg1 (4,3), ..., segment 6 to old seg5 (5,5)? Old positions: index 0: (3,3), 1: (4,3), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (5,6), 6: (4,6)\n\nAfter move head to (3,2): new head: (3,2)\n\nThen new segment 1: old head (3,3)\n\nNew segment 2: old seg1 (4,3)\n\nNew segment 3: old seg2 (4,4)\n\nNew segment 4: old seg3 (4,5)\n\nNew segment 5: old seg4 (5,5)\n\nNew segment 6: old seg5 (5,6)  -- tail\n\nAnd old seg6 (4,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly for L to (2,3): new snake [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] -- tail at (5,6), (4,6) free.\n\nNow, after any move, the head direction will be the direction I moved.\n\nFor example, if I move U, new head direction is U.\n\nIf I move D, new direction D, etc.\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can reach the foods quickly.\n\nFood at (3,1): from (3,3), I can go down twice: e.g., D to (3,2), then D to (3,1), but on turn 32, if I move D to (3,2), then on turn 33, I can move D to (3,1) to eat it.\n\n(3,1) has life_span=3, so it can be eaten on turn 32,33,34.\n\nTurn 32: current turn, I can eat if adjacent, but not adjacent, so not this turn.\n\nTurn 33: I can eat if I move to it on turn 33.\n\nSimilarly, turn 34.\n\nSo if I go to (3,2) on turn 32, then on turn 33 I can eat (3,1) by moving down.\n\nBut I need to check if (3,2) and (3,1) are safe.\n\n(3,2): not wall, not obstacle, not occupied by snake currently. After I move to it, it will be head, but when moving to (3,2), is it safe? Yes, as above.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1): not occupied now, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), not (3,1)).\n\nSo path to (3,1) is straightforward: move D to (3,2) on turn 32, then D to (3,1) on turn 33 to eat.\n\nBut when I eat, the snake grows, so after eating, tail doesn't move, so snake becomes longer.\n\nOn turn 33, if I move to (3,1) and eat, then new head at (3,1), and body: since I ate, the tail stays, so segments: new head (3,1), then the previous head which was at (3,2), then (3,3), (4,3), etc., and tail remains, so length 8.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,2): from (3,3), I can go left to (2,3), then down to (2,2), but (2,2) might be eaten later.\n\n(2,2) has life_span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nFood at (1,4): from (3,3), go left to (2,3), then up to (2,4)? But (2,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (2,4), so cannot go there.\n\n(2,4) is blocked, so from (2,3), I can go left to (1,3) or down to (2,2), but not up to (2,4).\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), which is adjacent to (1,3), (1,5), (2,4) but (2,4) blocked, (0,4) wall, so from (1,3) or (1,5).\n\nBut to reach (1,4) from current position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate choice for turn 32.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Move U to (3,4)\n\n2. Move D to (3,2)\n\n3. Move L to (2,3)\n\nIf I move D to (3,2), I can eat (3,1) on next turn easily.\n\nBut (3,1) has value +1, and I get it quickly.\n\nThen after that, I need to think where to go.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), I can then go to (2,2) or (1,3), etc.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), I might go towards (1,4) or other areas.\n\nBut there is also the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,6), and no food there, so not an issue now.\n\nFood positions are separate.\n\nFor turn 32, moving D to (3,2) seems good to set up for eating (3,1) on turn 33.\n\nBut let's see the life spans: (3,1) must be eaten by turn 34, so I have time, but if I don't go now, I might miss it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) has more time.\n\n(2,2) has plenty of time.\n\nBut I should also consider the grid layout for long-term survival.\n\nLet me sketch the grid quickly.\n\ny=7 top, y=0 bottom.\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nObstacles:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (1,2)\n\nWalls: borders.\n\nSnake: head (3,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)\n\nSo the snake is in a sort of L-shape or something.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,4) to (4,5) to (5,5) to (5,6) to (4,6).\n\nSo it's like from (3,3) right to (4,3), then up to (4,4), up to (4,5), then right-up to (5,5), up to (5,6), then left to (4,6).\n\nTail at (4,6).\n\nNow, if I move D to (3,2), then snake becomes [ (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] tail at (5,6)\n\nThen on turn 33, move D to (3,1) to eat food. After eating, snake grows to 8 segments: head at (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) — so tail at (5,6), and new segment at (3,1), so positions: [ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ]\n\nNow head at (3,1), direction D (since moved down).\n\nFrom here, where to go? Possible moves: from (3,1), cannot move down because y=0 is wall, so (3,0) is wall, dead. Cannot move down.\n\nLeft: (2,1), is it free? (2,1): not wall (x=2,y=1), obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, (2,4) obstacle, but (2,1) not listed, so should be free.\n\nRight: (4,1), but (4,1) not occupied? Snake positions now: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), etc, no (4,1). But (4,1) is not wall, obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not, so free.\n\nUp: (3,2), but (3,2) is the first body segment, currently occupied, so moving there would collide.\n\nAfter moving from (3,1), the body segment at (3,2) will move to (3,1) or something.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nIf I move up to (3,2), which is occupied by body, not tail (tail is (5,6)), so moving to (3,2) would cause collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left or right or down.\n\nDown to (3,0) is wall, impossible.\n\nUp to (3,2) is body, collision.\n\nLeft to (2,1): free, as above.\n\nRight to (4,1): free.\n\nSo from (3,1), after eating, I can only move left or right.\n\nSay I move left to (2,1), then new head (2,1), etc.\n\nOr right to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is near obstacle (5,1).\n\nSimilarly, I have food at (2,2) and (1,4).\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is adjacent to (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle, so (2,2) can be accessed from (2,1), (2,3), or (3,2) but (3,2) may be occupied.\n\nIn the future.\n\nIf I go to (3,1) and eat on turn 33, then on turn 34, I can move from (3,1) to, say, left to (2,1), then to (2,2) or other.\n\nBut let's see if moving D now is best.\n\nAnother option: move L to (2,3) on turn 32.\n\nThen head at (2,3), new snake: [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] tail at (5,6), (4,6) free.\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,4): but (2,4) is internal obstacle, blocked! Cannot move there.\n\n- D to (2,2): (2,2) is food position, but if I move there, I eat it? (2,2) has food, value 1, life_span 9.\n\nIf I move to (2,2) on this turn, I can eat it.\n\nBut I'm on turn 32, moving to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is adjacent to head? From (2,3), D to (2,2) is down, adjacent.\n\nSo if I move D to (2,2), I eat the food at (2,2), since it's there.\n\nThen snake grows: new head at (2,2), and tail doesn't move, so segments: new head (2,2), then previous head (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), ..., up to tail (5,6), but since ate, the tail stays, so new positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] length 8.\n\nHead direction now D.\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,3): but (2,3) is now the first body segment, moving there would collide. Not safe.\n\n- D to (2,1): (2,1) free? Not wall, not obstacle (obstacles (1,2), but (2,1) not, so free.\n\n- L to (1,2): but (1,2) is internal obstacle! Blocked.\n\n- R to (3,2): (3,2) free? Not occupied now, not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nCannot move up or left.\n\nNow, food at (3,1) and (1,4) still available.\n\n(3,1) can be reached from (3,2) or (2,1), etc.\n\nBut let's not jump ahead.\n\nBack to turn 32 choice.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4) on turn 32.\n\nThen head at (3,4), new snake: [ (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] tail (5,6), (4,6) free.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,5): (3,5) free? Not occupied, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles at y=4? (2,4) and (6,4), not (3,5)), so free.\n\n- D to (3,3): but (3,3) is now the first body segment (after head), moving there collide.\n\n- L to (2,4): (2,4) is obstacle! Blocked.\n\n- R to (4,4): (4,4) is body? Current positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), etc. (4,4) is the fourth segment, not tail, so moving to (4,4) would collide.\n\nSo from (3,4), possible moves: only U to (3,5), since D, L, R all unsafe or blocked.\n\nL to (2,4) blocked, R to (4,4) body, D to (3,3) body, so only U to (3,5) is safe.\n\nThen on turn 33, move U to (3,5), new head (3,5), snake [ (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ] tail at (5,5)? Old tail was (5,6), moved to (5,5) or? After move: new head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — and (5,6) free.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,6): free, not wall, not obstacle.\n\n- D to (3,4): body, collide.\n\n- L to (2,5): (2,5) free? Not occupied, not wall, not obstacle ( (2,4) obstacle but (2,5) not), so free.\n\n- R to (4,5): (4,5) is body? Current positions: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — (4,5) is the sixth segment, not tail, tail is (5,5). Moving to (4,5) would be body, collide.\n\nR to (4,5) is occupied by body, unsafe.\n\nSo possible: U to (3,6) or L to (2,5).\n\nThen I can go towards (1,4) or other.\n\nBut (1,4) is at (1,4), which is down from here.\n\nFrom (3,5), to (1,4), need to go left and down.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (2,4), so I have to go around.\n\nFor example, to (2,5), then to (1,5), then down to (1,4), or something.\n\nBut (1,5) might be free.\n\ny=5, x=1.\n\nNot wall, not obstacle listed.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is food.\n\nLife_span 6, so I have time.\n\nBut if I go up now, I might be going away from other food.\n\nNow, back to turn 32, I have three choices, each with implications.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,1) with short life, only 3 turns including this, so if I don't go for it, I might lose it.\n\nTurn 32: life_span 3, so can be eaten turn 32,33,34.\n\nTurn 32: not adjacent, can't eat.\n\nTurn 33: if I am at (3,2) or adjacent, I can eat.\n\nTurn 34: similarly.\n\nIf I move D to (3,2) on turn 32, then on turn 33 I can eat (3,1).\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), I might eat (2,2) immediately or go to (2,2) and eat, but (2,2) has long life.\n\nIf I move U, I go up and might not get to (3,1) in time.\n\nFor example, from U move, I go to (3,5) by turn 33, then to (3,6) or (2,5), far from (3,1), and by turn 34, I might not reach (3,1), since from (3,5) to (3,1) is 4 steps down, but I can move down, but with obstacles, it might be tight.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,1): directly down, but at (3,4) is body, and (3,3) body, so I can't go directly; I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), go left to (2,5), then down to (2,4) but blocked, so to (2,3) or (2,2), etc.\n\nIt might take more than 2 turns to reach (3,1) from there.\n\nTurn 33: if at (3,5), move to (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nSay to (2,5), then turn 34 at (2,5), then to (2,4) blocked, so to (2,3) or (1,5), then to (2,3) on turn 35, but (3,1) disappears after turn 34, so on turn 34 it must be eaten, but on turn 34 I am at (2,5) or similar, not adjacent to (3,1), so I can't eat it on turn 34. Turn 33 I am at (2,5) or (3,6), not adjacent, turn 34 same, so I miss (3,1) if I go up.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3) on turn 32, then I can go down to (2,2) and eat on turn 32 if I move D, or on turn 33 if I move to (2,2) later, but on turn 32 from (2,3) I can move D to (2,2) and eat immediately.\n\nBut (3,1) is still there, and I can go to it from (2,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,2) on turn 32, at (2,2), then on turn 33, I can move to (2,1) or (3,2).\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), adjacent to (3,2) and (2,1) and (4,1), but (4,1) might be far.\n\nSo from (2,2), move to (3,2) on turn 33, then on turn 34 move to (3,1) to eat.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (2,1) on turn 33, then on turn 34 to (3,1) or (2,1) to (3,1) is not adjacent, (2,1) to (3,1) is right, adjacent, yes.\n\n(2,1) and (3,1) are adjacent? Delta x=1, delta y=0, yes.\n\nSo from (2,2), if I move to (2,1) on turn 33, then to (3,1) on turn 34, but (3,1) must be eaten by turn 34, so on turn 34 I can eat it.\n\nIf I move to (3,2) on turn 33, then to (3,1) on turn 34.\n\nEither way, I can reach (3,1) by turn 34.\n\nNow, if I move D to (3,2) on turn 32, I can eat (3,1) on turn 33, which is earlier, and I get the food with one less move, but same score.\n\nBut eating earlier might be better for survival or something, but not necessarily.\n\nIn terms of score, eating (3,1) on turn 33 or 34 is same, but on turn 33 I have one extra turn to do other things.\n\nBut let's see the grid congestion.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, the snake grows, so it takes more space, might be harder to navigate.\n\nBut in this case, from current, if I move D to (3,2) on turn 32, then to (3,1) on turn 33, eat, grow to 8.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\nIf I go left to (2,1), then I can go to (2,2) or (1,1), but (2,2) has food, but I might have eaten it already or not.\n\nIn this path, I haven't eaten (2,2) yet.\n\nSimilarly, if I moved L first, I might have eaten (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) has long life, so I can eat it later.\n\nNow, also, food at (1,4) needs to be eaten within 6 turns.\n\nBut let's think about long-term survival.\n\nThe area around (3,3) has the snake body, so moving away might be good.\n\nIf I move U, I go to (3,4), then only can go up to (3,5), then to (3,6) or (2,5), which is less crowded, but I might get stuck or something.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), if I go to (3,6), then at (3,6), y=6, close to top wall.\n\nPossible moves from (3,6): U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, dead. D to (3,5) body. L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) free? Not wall, not obstacle. (4,6) was tail but now free? Depends.\n\nBut it might be ok.\n\nBut I need to consider the whole board.\n\nPerhaps I should go for the short-life food first to not miss it.\n\n(3,1) has only 3 turns life, and I can get it easily by moving down now.\n\nIf I move other ways, I might still get it but with risk or later.\n\nBut in the L move, I can also get it by turn 34.\n\nBut let's see the difference.\n\nIf I move D on turn 32 to (3,2), then on turn 33 to (3,1) eat, then on turn 34 at (3,1), I can move to (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nFrom there, I can go to (2,2) or other.\n\nIf I move L on turn 32 to (2,3), then I can move D to (2,2) and eat (2,2) on turn 32, then on turn 33 at (2,2), I can move to (2,1) or (3,2), then on turn 34 to (3,1) to eat (3,1).\n\nSo I get both foods by turn 34, and snake grows twice, to length 9.\n\nIn the first case, if I move D on turn 32, I eat (3,1) on turn 33, but not (2,2) yet, so I have to get it later.\n\nBut (2,2) has long life, so I can.\n\nBut by eating (2,2) early, I clear the food and have more space, but snake is longer, might be harder to move.\n\nIn this grid, with obstacles, it might be tight.\n\nLet's see the area.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), after eating, I can go to (2,1) or (3,2).\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), then I can go to (1,1) or (2,0) but y=0 wall, so (2,0) dead, so to (1,1) or (3,1) but (3,1) may be eaten.\n\n(1,1) : x=1,y=1, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles (1,2), but (1,1) not), so free.\n\nThen to (1,1), then I can go to (1,0) wall or (0,1) wall or (1,2) obstacle or (2,1) body, so only to (1,1) from (2,1), but from (1,1) I can only go to (1,2) but obstacle, dead end.\n\n(1,1): possible moves:\n\n- U to (1,2): obstacle, blocked\n\n- D to (1,0): wall, dead\n\n- L to (0,1): wall, dead\n\n- R to (2,1): which may be body or free.\n\nBut if I am at (1,1), it's a dead end because all adjacent except possibly right are blocked.\n\nR to (2,1) is the only exit, but if (2,1) is occupied, I die.\n\nBut in the sequence, if I go to (2,1), then to (1,1), I might be trapped.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,2), I can go to (3,1) but if eaten, or to (4,2), etc.\n\nTo avoid dead ends, I should not go to (2,1) if possible.\n\nIn the path where I eat (2,2) on turn 32, then on turn 33 from (2,2), I should move to (3,2) instead of (2,1), to avoid the left area.\n\nThen from (3,2), on turn 33, I can move to (3,1) if not eaten, but in this case, (3,1) is still there, so I can move to (3,1) on turn 33 or 34.\n\nIf on turn 33 I move to (3,2), then on turn 34 to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nTurn 32: move L to (2,3), then D to (2,2) eat. New snake: head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) length 8.\n\nHead direction D.\n\nOn turn 33, from (2,2), move to (3,2) (right), since moving to (2,1) might lead to dead end, and (2,3) is body, cannot move up.\n\nMove R to (3,2).\n\nThen new head (3,2), snake: since no eat, tail moves, but last action was eat, so positions: before move, snake at [ (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ]\n\nAfter moving to (3,2), new head (3,2), then segment 1 to (2,2), segment 2 to (2,3), etc., segment 7 to (5,5), tail to (5,6)? New positions: [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ] and (5,6) free.\n\nTail at (5,5).\n\nNow at (3,2), food at (3,1) is adjacent below.\n\nOn turn 34, move D to (3,1) to eat. Then snake grows to 9.\n\nThen from (3,1), as before, can move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\nBut (2,1) leads to potential dead end, so better to move right to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is free, then from there, I can go to (4,2), (5,1) but obstacle, so to (4,2), etc.\n\nThen I can go towards (1,4) or other areas.\n\nSimilarly, if I moved D on turn 32 to (3,2), then on turn 33 to (3,1) eat, then on turn 34 at (3,1), move to (4,1) or (2,1).\n\nAgain, move to (4,1) to avoid left.\n\nThen from (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2), R to (5,1) but (5,1) obstacle, L to (3,1) body, D to (4,0) wall, so only U to (4,2).\n\nThen to (4,2), and so on.\n\nNow, food at (1,4) needs to be eaten.\n\n(1,4) is at top-left, with obstacles around.\n\nTo reach (1,4), from current positions, I need to go left and up.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) or similar, I can go to (3,2), but may be occupied.\n\nSince I have to think 5 turns ahead, let's plan a path.\n\nBut for now, on turn 32, moving D or L both allow me to eat (3,1) by turn 34, but moving L also lets me eat (2,2) on turn 32, so I get an extra food early.\n\nIn terms of score, eating (2,2) on turn 32 is better because I get the point earlier, but the score is the same whenever I eat, as long as I eat it before it disappears.\n\nBut by eating early, I grow the snake, which might make movement harder, but in this case, the grid has space.\n\nAlso, for long-term, eating (2,2) early might be good since it's in a somewhat confined area.\n\n(2,2) is near obstacles, so better to clear it.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I might forget or it might be hard to reach later.\n\nBut with life_span 9, I have time.\n\nBut to maximize, I should eat it when convenient.\n\nIn this case, by moving L and down, I can eat two foods quickly.\n\nIf I move U, I might miss (3,1) and only get (1,4) later.\n\nAnd (1,4) has longer life, but I lose (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is +1, so missing it is bad.\n\nTherefore, moving U is not good because I likely miss (3,1).\n\nMoving D or L are both ok, but moving L allows me to eat (2,2) immediately.\n\nMoreover, after eating (2,2) and (3,1), I can head towards (1,4).\n\nFor example, from after eating both, at (3,1) on turn 34, I can go to (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3) but may be body, etc.\n\nBut let's see the body positions.\n\nAfter eating (2,2) on turn 32 and (3,1) on turn 34, the snake is longer.\n\nBut I can move to open areas.\n\n(1,4) can be reached via (1,3) or (1,5).\n\n(1,3) is free, for example.\n\nFrom (4,1) or wherever, I can go left to (3,1) but eaten, so to (2,1) but dead end, so better not.\n\nFrom (3,2) or (4,2), go up to (3,3) but may be body, etc.\n\nPerhaps I should go up through the center.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (2,4), so I need to go around.\n\nFor instance, from (4,2), go up to (4,3), but (4,3) may be body.\n\nLet's not overcomplicate.\n\nFor turn 32, moving L to (2,3) and then D to (2,2) to eat seems good.\n\nThen on turn 33, move to (3,2), then turn 34 to (3,1) eat.\n\nThen on turn 34, after eating (3,1), at (3,1), move right to (4,1).\n\nThen on turn 35, from (4,1) move up to (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 36, from (4,2) move up to (4,3) or right to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) might be body.\n\nAfter turn 34: head at (3,1), after eating, positions: [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ] let's list properly.\n\nAfter eating (3,1) on turn 34, and before that we ate (2,2) on turn 32.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 32: start at [ (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) ]\n\nMove L to (2,3): new positions [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] tail (5,6), (4,6) free.\n\nThen move D to (2,2) and eat (2,2): so head to (2,2), and tail doesn't move, so new positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) ] length 8.\n\nTurn 33: from (2,2), move R to (3,2) (no eat, since no food there? (3,2) no food mentioned, food at (3,1), (1,4), (2,2) eaten, so (3,2) empty.\n\nMove to (3,2): new positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail (5,5), (5,6) free.\n\nTurn 34: move D to (3,1) and eat (3,1): head to (3,1), tail stays, so positions: [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ] length 9.\n\nNow head at (3,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: as before, U to (3,2) body, collide; D to (3,0) wall; L to (2,1); R to (4,1).\n\nL to (2,1): free, as before.\n\nR to (4,1): free.\n\n(2,1) leads to potential dead end, so better move R to (4,1).\n\nTurn 34: move R to (4,1).\n\nThen new positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — tail (4,5), (5,5) free? After move: new head (4,1), segment 1 to old head (3,1), segment 2 to (3,2), ..., segment 8 to (4,4)? Old positions before move: [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (4,1): new head (4,1)\n\nNew seg1: old head (3,1)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (3,2)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (2,2)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (2,3)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (3,3)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (4,3)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (4,4)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (4,5)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (5,5)  -- tail\n\nSo positions: [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ] tail at (4,5)\n\n(5,5) free.\n\nHead at (4,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,2): is it free? Not occupied, not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, impossible.\n\nL to (3,1): body, collide.\n\nR to (5,1): but (5,1) is internal obstacle! Blocked.\n\nSo only possible move: U to (4,2).\n\nTurn 35: move U to (4,2).\n\nThen new head (4,2), etc.\n\nFrom there, I can go to (4,3) or (5,2), etc.\n\nThen towards (1,4).\n\nBut (1,4) is at (1,4), I can go via (2,3) but may be occupied, or from left.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) go left to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, or up to (4,3) but (4,3) may be body.\n\nAfter turn 35, positions: after moving to (4,2), new positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4) -- tail (4,4), (4,5) free.\n\nFrom (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,3): but (4,3) is body segment (seventh segment), not tail, so moving there collide.\n\n- D to (4,1): body, collide.\n\n- L to (3,2): (3,2) is body (fourth segment), collide.\n\n- R to (5,2): (5,2) free? Not occupied, not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n\nSo only move R to (5,2).\n\nTurn 36: move R to (5,2).\n\nThen head (5,2), and so on.\n\nI can continue to (5,3), (5,4), but (5,4) has obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, (5,1) obstacle, but (5,4) not.\n\n(5,4) free.\n\nThen to (5,4), then to (5,5) but may be, or to (4,4) body.\n\nEventually, to reach (1,4), I need to go left, but the left side is partly occupied by snake body.\n\nFor example, positions like (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) are body segments, so I need to wait for the snake to move or go around.\n\nBut it might take many turns.\n\nIf on turn 32 I move U, I might go directly to (1,4), but I miss (3,1).\n\nAnd (3,1) is +1, so better not to miss it.\n\nTherefore, for turn 32, I should move L to (2,3), then on turn 33 move D to (2,2) to eat, etc.\n\nBut on turn 32, when I move to (2,3), I can choose to move D to (2,2) or other, but moving D to (2,2) eats the food immediately.\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction says to output actions starting from turn t1, for several turns, at least 5? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to list actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many turns to output.\n\nLook: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nIt says \"...\", so I should provide a sequence for a few turns, perhaps as many as I can plan.\n\nSince it's a game, I might provide for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 32, I decide to move L.\n\nThen on turn 33, move D to eat (2,2).\n\nThen on turn 34, move to (3,2) or something.\n\nBut let's define the sequence.\n\nFirst, on turn 32, move L to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), on turn 33, move D to (2,2) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 34, from (2,2), move R to (3,2).\n\nThen on turn 35, from (3,2), move D to (3,1) to eat, but on turn 35? Turn 34 I am at (3,2), then move to (3,1) on turn 34? Let's clarify turns.\n\nTurn 32: action L, move to (2,3)\n\nTurn 33: action D, move to (2,2) and eat (2,2)\n\nTurn 34: from (2,2), action R, move to (3,2)\n\nTurn 35: from (3,2), action D, move to (3,1) and eat (3,1)\n\n(3,1) can be eaten on turn 34 or 35, since life_span 3 from turn 32: available turn 32,33,34. Turn 32: not eaten, turn 33: not adjacent to head at that time, on turn 33 head at (2,2), (3,1) not adjacent, so not eaten. Turn 34: head at (3,2), (3,1) adjacent below, so on turn 34 I can move D to (3,1) to eat.\n\nOn turn 34, from (3,2), I can move D to (3,1) to eat.\n\nIn the sequence above, on turn 34 I am at (3,2) after moving R from (2,2).\n\nTurn 33: move to (3,2)? No.\n\nAfter turn 33: at (2,2) after eating.\n\nTurn 34: move to (3,2) by moving right.\n\nThen at (3,2), (3,1) is adjacent, so I can move down to (3,1) on the same turn, turn 34, to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nThen on turn 35, at (3,1), move to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list for a few turns.\n\nSince the food (6,2) disappears, and I don't care.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nBut I need to output for turn t1=32 onwards.\n\nSo let's say:\n\nTurn 32: L (move left to (2,3))\n\nThen turn 33: D (move down to (2,2), eat food)\n\nThen turn 34: R (move right to (3,2))\n\nThen turn 35: D (move down to (3,1), eat food)\n\nThen turn 36: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nThen turn 37: U (move up to (4,2))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I should stop after 5 turns or so.\n\nThe problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but for output, it's open.\n\nPerhaps for this response, I'll provide 5 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving L on turn 32 is best.\n\nAnother thing: the head direction.\n\nOn turn 32, head direction is L, moving L is same direction, fine.\n\nThen after move, new head direction L.\n\nOn turn 33, from (2,3), moving D to (2,2), which is down, not opposite to L, so ok.\n\nThen new direction D.\n\nOn turn 34, from (2,2), moving R to (3,2), right, not opposite to D (down), so ok.\n\nThen new direction R.\n\nOn turn 35, from (3,2), moving D to (3,1), down, not opposite to R, ok.\n\nThen new direction D.\n\nOn turn 36, from (3,1), moving R to (4,1), right, not opposite to D? D is down, R is right, not opposite, so ok.\n\nOpposite would be U for D, but R is perpendicular.\n\nNo instant reverse only forbids directly opposite, like U vs D, L vs R.\n\nSo moving perpendicular is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, if I moved D on turn 32, I eat only (3,1) on turn 33, and (2,2) later, but I can still eat it.\n\nBut by moving L, I get an extra food on turn 32.\n\nSo better to move L.\n\nMoving U is worse, as I might miss (3,1).\n\nTherefore, for turn 32, action L.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 32. The key priorities are:\n- Eat the food at (3,1) by turn 34 to avoid missing it (life_span 3, disappears after turn 34).\n- Eat the food at (2,2) early since it is easily accessible and has a long life_span, but clearing it reduces future risks in the confined area near obstacles.\n- Avoid the area around (2,1) which is a dead end (only exit is to (2,2), but if occupied, it could trap the snake).\n- Head towards open areas after eating the critical foods to maintain maneuverability and eventually reach (1,4).\n\nAfter evaluating all options:\n- Moving up (U) on turn 32 risks missing (3,1) due to distance and obstacles, and provides no immediate benefit.\n- Moving down (D) on turn 32 allows eating (3,1) on turn 33 but misses the opportunity to eat (2,2) immediately.\n- Moving left (L) on turn 32 enables eating (2,2) on turn 33 and (3,1) on turn 34, maximizing early score gain and setting up a path to safer areas.\n\nThus, the optimal sequence starts with L on turn 32. The sequence for turns 32 to 37 is:\n\n- **Turn 32**: Move L to (2,3). This sets up access to (2,2) and avoids the risk of missing short-life food.\n- **Turn 33**: Move D to (2,2) to eat the positive food there (value +1, snake grows to length 8). Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 34**: Move R to (3,2). This positions the snake to eat (3,1) next and avoids the dead end at (2,1). Head direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 35**: Move D to (3,1) to eat the positive food (value +1, snake grows to length 9). This ensures (3,1) is eaten before it disappears. Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 36**: Move R to (4,1). This moves away from the congested left side and towards open space. Head direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 37**: Move U to (4,2). This continues toward the center of the grid, avoiding obstacles and walls, and starts navigating toward (1,4) for future eating. Head direction becomes U.\n\nThis sequence eats two positive foods by turn 35, adds 2 to the score, and ensures the snake remains in a survivable position. Beyond turn 37, the snake should continue toward (1,4) via a path like (4,2) → (5,2) → (5,3) → (5,4) → (4,4) (if free), but this requires checking future states for collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 32: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\text{U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 33, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I need to avoid these.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (2,3) from (3,3).\n\nFood:\n\n- (3,1) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including the current turn, so I need to consider that.\n\nI must think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards. So I should plan a sequence of moves for several turns.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll assume coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, with (0,0) bottom-left? But in the snake positions, y=3,4,5,6, so y increases upwards? Let's see: head (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6). Since (5,5) to (5,6), y=6 is higher than y=5, so probably y increases upwards. Similarly, from (4,3) to (4,4) to (4,5), y increasing. And head moving from (3,3) to (2,3), so left, x decreasing. So grid: (0,0) bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? But walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so borders.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nFood: (3,1), (1,4), (2,2)\n\nSnake: head at (2,3), body: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), tail at (5,6)\n\nHead direction is L, so last move was left to (2,3). I cannot move opposite to current direction, so since head direction is L (left), I cannot move right (R) on this turn. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), but not R.\n\nCurrent position: head at (2,3). Possible moves:\n\n- U: (2,4)\n\n- D: (2,2)\n\n- L: (1,3)\n\n- R: (3,3) but (3,3) is the second segment, and since direction is L, moving R would be opposite, so not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" – so for turn t1=33, since head direction is L, I cannot move R.\n\nAlso, moving into walls or obstacles is deadly.\n\nFirst, let's list all deadly cells to avoid:\n\n- Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y), (x,0), (x,7). Specifically, since head is at (2,3), nearby walls: x=0 is left, but (2,3) is x=2, not near x=0 yet. y=0 and y=7 are bottom and top.\n\n- Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is an obstacle! That's directly above the head, since head at (2,3), U would be (2,4), but (2,4) is an obstacle, so I cannot move up to (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, other obstacles not immediately adjacent.\n\nNow, food: (3,1) at (3,1), which is below and right? Head at (2,3), so (3,1) is x=3,y=1, so from (2,3), moving D to (2,2) then R to (3,2) or something, but let's see positions.\n\n(1,4) at (1,4), which is left and up from head? (2,3) to (1,4) is x-1, y+1, so diagonal, not adjacent directly.\n\n(2,2) at (2,2), which is directly below head at (2,3), so D to (2,2) would be moving onto food.\n\nBut (2,2) has food with life span 8.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nNow, life spans: current turn t1=33.\n\nFood at (3,1): life span 3, so it disappears after 3 turns, meaning it will be gone by turn 36? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 33, life span 3, so it will be there for turns 33,34,35, and disappear before turn 36? Let's read: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"Disappears after N turns\".\n\nSo if life span is N at turn t, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears when life span becomes 0, I think. But when exactly does it disappear?\n\nThe rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor example, at turn t, if food has life span N, then at turn t, it is present, and countdown is N. After turn t, at start of turn t+1, life span becomes N-1, and so on. When life span reaches 0, it disappears, so at turn t + N, it has life span 0 and disappears before turn t + N +1 or something. I need to clarify.\n\nTypically in such games, if life span is N at turn t, it lasts for N more turns, including turn t, so it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n\nFor food at (3,1): life span 3 at turn 33. So it will be present on turns 33,34,35, and disappear at turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4): life span 5, present turns 33 to 37, disappear turn 38.\n\n(2,2): life span 8, present turns 33 to 40, disappear turn 41.\n\nNow, back to possible moves for turn 33.\n\nHead at (2,3), direction L.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- U: to (2,4) but (2,4) is an obstacle! (2,4) is listed in internal obstacles: (2,4) is there. So cannot move up.\n\n- D: to (2,2). (2,2) has food? (2,2) is a food position, so moving there would eat it.\n\n- L: to (1,3). (1,3) is empty? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nSnake positions: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6). So (1,3) is not occupied by snake.\n\nWalls: not a wall, since x=1 not border, y=3 not border.\n\nObstacles: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,2) is at (1,2), not (1,3), so (1,3) is free.\n\n- R: to (3,3) but (3,3) is the second segment of snake, and moving there would cause collision? Also, direction is L, moving R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nCannot move R because reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only possible moves are D or L.\n\nD to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n\nNow, if I move D to (2,2), I eat the food there, since (2,2) has positive food, so length increases by 1, and I get +1 score.\n\nBut is there any danger? Tail is at (5,6), not adjacent to head. Head at (2,3), tail at (5,6), far away. But after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately? When I eat, the snake grows, so the tail stays, and a new segment is added.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length +1, so after moving to food, the head is on food, it eats, and the tail doesn't move that turn? I think in standard Snake, when you eat, you grow, so the tail remains in place, meaning the segment that was tail stays, and a new segment is added at head.\n\nBut the movement: each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and if it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases. If not, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nFrom rules: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nAlso, for movement: the head moves, and if no food eaten, the tail moves one cell forward; if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (2,2), which has food, I eat it, so snake grows to 8 segments, tail remains at (5,6) for now.\n\nBut head is now at (2,2), which was previously empty.\n\nNow, potential danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nBut here, tail is at (5,6), head at (2,3) or after move, not adjacent. After moving to (2,2), head at (2,2), tail at (5,6), not adjacent.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nOption L: move to (1,3). (1,3) is empty, no food, so no eat, tail moves, so the new tail would be where the second segment was? Snake positions: after moving head to (1,3), the body follows: head (1,3), then previous head (2,3) becomes segment, (3,3), etc., and tail (5,6) moves to where the second last was, which is (5,5)? Let's trace.\n\nCurrent snake: positions list: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)] head to tail.\n\nIf I move head to (1,3), new head at (1,3), then the body: the segment that was at (2,3) becomes the second, (3,3) third, ..., and the tail (5,6) is removed? Since no food eaten, the tail moves off, so new positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). Tail was (5,6), but since no eat, the last segment is removed, so tail is now at (5,5)? Positions: the body segments shift, so the new tail is the segment that was second last, which is (5,5), and (5,6) is vacated.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (2,2) and eat, new head at (2,2), then body: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) — tail stays, so length 8.\n\nNow, back to choices: D to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n\nIf I move D, I eat the food at (2,2) immediately, get +1, snake grows.\n\nBut (2,2) has life span 8, so it will be there for many turns, I don't have to eat it now. I could go for other food or avoid risks.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eating is good, but with risks.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2), head at (2,2), direction now D? Since I moved down, new head direction is D.\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nBut let's think about the board.\n\nI should map the grid.\n\nList all occupied cells.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7 for all y; all y=0, y=7 for all x.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nFood: (3,1), (1,4), (2,2)\n\nNow, head at (2,3), can move D to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is empty.\n\nNow, if I move L to (1,3), then head at (1,3), direction L.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U to (1,4), but (1,4) has food? Food at (1,4), yes, so I could eat it.\n\nD to (1,2), but (1,2) is an obstacle! Cannot move there.\n\nL to (0,3), but x=0 is wall, so deadly.\n\nR to (2,3), but (2,3) is now the second segment? After moving to (1,3), the previous head (2,3) is now the first body segment, so moving R to (2,3) would be into body, collision.\n\nAlso, direction: after moving L, new direction is L, so moving R would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,4), which has food, so eat.\n\n- D: to (1,2) but obstacle, deadly.\n\n- L: to (0,3) wall, deadly.\n\n- R: to (2,3) but body, and reverse? Direction is L, moving R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move from (1,3) is U to (1,4).\n\nIs that right?\n\n(1,4) has food, so moving there eats it.\n\nBut if I move to (1,3) first, then from there, only U to (1,4) is possible, since other moves are deadly or not allowed.\n\nSo if I choose L at turn 33, I go to (1,3), then at turn 34, I must go U to (1,4) to eat that food.\n\nBut let's see the life span: food at (1,4) has life span 5, so at turn 33, it will be there for turns 33,34,35,36,37, disappear turn 38.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 34, if I eat it, it's fine.\n\nBut I need to think about after that.\n\nFirst, let's compare to moving D now.\n\nIf I move D to (2,2) at turn 33, eat food there.\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,2):\n\n- U: to (2,3), but (2,3) is now the second segment? After eating, snake positions: head (2,2), then body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6). So (2,3) is body segment, so moving U to (2,3) would collide with body.\n\nAlso, direction: moved D to (2,2), so new direction is D, moving U is up, which is opposite to down? U is y+1, D is y-1, so U is opposite to D.\n\nRule: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction after move is D, so cannot move U (up).\n\n- D: to (2,1). (2,1) is not wall? y=1, not border, x=2 not border. Obstacles? (2,4) is obstacle but not (2,1). (5,1) is obstacle, not (2,1). So (2,1) should be free. But y=1, is it bottom? y=0 is bottom, y=1 is above.\n\n- L: to (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle, deadly.\n\n- R: to (3,2). (3,2) is not occupied? Snake has (3,3) but not (3,2). Walls no, obstacles no. Food at (3,1) but not (3,2). So free.\n\nPossible moves from (2,2) after moving D:\n\n- D: to (2,1)\n\n- R: to (3,2)\n\nCannot U or L.\n\nIf I go D to (2,1), or R to (3,2).\n\n(2,1) is empty, no food mentioned.\n\n(3,2) empty.\n\nFood at (3,1) is below, but not directly.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, the snake body is at (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), which is near the top-right.\n\nNow, let's consider the other option: moving L to (1,3) at turn 33.\n\nThen at (1,3), only possible move is U to (1,4) at turn 34, eating food there.\n\nAfter that, head at (1,4), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen from (1,4), possible moves.\n\nFirst, after eating at (1,4), snake grows, so positions: before move to (1,4), after turn 33 move to (1,3), snake is head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5), since no eat on turn 33.\n\nThen move to (1,4) at turn 34, eat food, so new head (1,4), body: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail remains, length 8 now? Original length 7, ate one, so 8.\n\nPositions: head (1,4), then (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). Tail at (5,5).\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow from (1,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,5). (1,5) is not wall? y=5, not border (y=7 border). Not obstacle. Is it free? No snake, no obstacle mentioned.\n\n- D: to (1,3), but (1,3) is now the second segment, body, so collision. Also, direction U, moving D is opposite, not allowed.\n\n- L: to (0,4) wall, deadly.\n\n- R: to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle! (2,4) is internal obstacle, so deadly.\n\n(2,4) is listed as obstacle.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (1,5).\n\nThus, from (1,4), only U to (1,5).\n\nThen at (1,5), no food, direction U.\n\nThen from there, possible moves, etc.\n\nBut now, the food at (2,2) is still there, but I didn't eat it, and it has long life.\n\nIn this path, I ate the food at (1,4), but I was forced into a path.\n\nNow, back to turn 33 choice.\n\nIf I choose D to (2,2) at turn 33, I eat that food, then from (2,2), I can go D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\n(2,1) is empty, (3,2) empty.\n\nFood at (3,1) is below, life span 3, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\nIf I go R to (3,2) at turn 34, then from (3,2), I can go D to (3,1) to eat the food there, since (3,1) has food.\n\nLife span 3 at turn 33, so at turn 34, it will be life span 2, still there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D from (2,2) to (2,1), then (2,1) is empty, then from there I can go to (3,1) or other, but (3,1) is food.\n\nBut let's plan sequences.\n\nFirst, I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body is currently blocking some areas.\n\nFor example, the snake has segments from (2,3) to (5,6), with a bend at (4,3) to (4,4), etc.\n\nThe area to the left and down might be open.\n\nFood at (3,1) needs to be eaten soon since life span short.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) has longer life, (2,2) long life.\n\nBut (2,2) is directly below, I can eat it now.\n\nBut if I eat it now, I grow, and might have less space.\n\nLet's consider the grid size: 8x8, but with walls and obstacles.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7 for y=0 to 7; all y=0, y=7 for x=0 to 7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo blocked cells: all border plus these.\n\nFree cells: let's see for lower left, since head at (2,3).\n\nCells like (1,3), (1,4), but (1,2) blocked, (1,4) food, (1,5) free? etc.\n\nBut I need to find a path to survive and eat food.\n\nAlso, after eating, the tail moves slowly, so paths might open.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat now, the tail moves, freeing up cells.\n\nIn the case where I move L to (1,3) at turn 33, then U to (1,4) at turn 34, then U to (1,5) at turn 35, and so on.\n\nFrom (1,5), direction U, possible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4) but body and reverse not allowed, L to (0,5) wall, R to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) : is it free? Snake has (4,5) but not (2,5). Obstacles no, walls no. So free.\n\nSo from (1,5), can go U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf go U to (1,6), then from (1,6), similar, U to (1,7) but y=7 wall, deadly; D to (1,5) body; L wall; R to (2,6). So must go R to (2,6) or something, but (2,6) might be free.\n\nBut y=7 is top, so (1,6) to (1,7) not possible, so from (1,6), only possible R to (2,6) if free.\n\n(2,6) : not wall, not obstacle, no snake, so free.\n\nThen from (2,6), can go to (2,7) wall, or (3,6), or (1,6) body, etc.\n\nBut this is going up, and the body is below, so I might get trapped if I go up with no way down.\n\nFor example, from (1,5), if I go R to (2,5), then from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, L to (1,5) body, R to (3,5).\n\nSo can go U or R.\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot go down.\n\nSo if I go to (2,5), I can only go up or right, not down.\n\nThen to (2,6) or (3,5), etc.\n\nBut the area below has the snake body, which will move, but slowly.\n\nIn this path, I ate the food at (1,4) at turn 34, so snake is longer, tail at (5,5) or something.\n\nBut let's see the tail position over time.\n\nPerhaps it's risky to go to the top-left corner.\n\nNow, back to the other choice: move D to (2,2) at turn 33.\n\nEat food, head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nThen at turn 34, I can go D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf I go D to (2,1), then (2,1) empty, no food. Head at (2,1), direction D.\n\nThen from (2,1), possible moves: U to (2,2) but (2,2) is body segment now? After eating at (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), etc. After move to (2,1), if no eat, tail moves.\n\nAt turn 34, from (2,2), if I move D to (2,1), no food there, so tail moves: new positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail was (5,6), but since no eat, tail moves to (5,5), and (5,6) vacated? Positions: head moves to (2,1), then the body: the segment at (2,2) becomes second, (2,3) third, etc., up to (5,5) second last, and tail (5,6) is removed, so new tail at (5,5).\n\nList: new head (2,1), then previous positions: after head moved, the body segments shift, so (2,2) is now first body, (2,3) second, (3,3) third, (4,3) fourth, (4,4) fifth, (4,5) sixth, (5,5) seventh, and (5,6) gone. So tail at (5,5).\n\nDirection D.\n\nFrom (2,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,2), but (2,2) is body, collision. Also, direction D, moving U opposite, not allowed.\n\n- D: to (2,0), but y=0 wall, deadly.\n\n- L: to (1,1). (1,1) is not wall? x=1, y=1. Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) not listed. Walls: y=0 and y=7, x=0 and x=7. So (1,1) should be free, no obstacle mentioned.\n\n- R: to (3,1). (3,1) has food, so moving there would eat.\n\n(3,1) has food with value 1.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nIf go R to (3,1), eat food, grow.\n\nIf go L to (1,1), no eat.\n\nBut (1,1) might be free.\n\nFrom (2,1), after moving D, direction D, so cannot U.\n\nD to (2,0) wall.\n\nL to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\n(1,1) is not occupied, I think.\n\nObstacles are (1,2), which is above, so (1,1) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) has food.\n\nNow, if at turn 34 I go R to (3,2) instead from (2,2).\n\nAt (2,2), turn 34, move R to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) empty, no food, so no eat, tail moves.\n\nPositions: head to (3,2), then body (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5), (5,6) gone.\n\nDirection R (since moved right).\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,3), but (3,3) is body segment, collision. Direction R, moving U not opposite? R is right, U is up, not opposite, so allowed, but to body, collision.\n\n- D: to (3,1), which has food, so eat.\n\n- L: to (2,2), body, collision. Also, direction R, moving L opposite, not allowed.\n\n- R: to (4,2). (4,2) not occupied? Snake has (4,3) but not (4,2). Obstacles no. So free.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (3,1) to eat, or R to (4,2).\n\nCannot U or L.\n\nNow, to prioritize long-term, I should consider which food to eat and when.\n\nFood at (3,1) has short life, only 3 turns at start, so if not eaten soon, it disappears.\n\nAt turn 33, life span 3, so after turn 33, at turn 34, life span 2, turn 35 life span 1, turn 36 gone.\n\nSo I need to eat it by turn 35 to get it.\n\nSimilarly, other food has longer life.\n\nIn the path where I go D to (2,2) at turn 33, I can then go to (3,1) soon.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), at turn 34, I can go D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf I go R to (3,2), then at turn 35, I can go D to (3,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D to (2,1) at turn 34, then at turn 35, I can go R to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBoth ways, I can eat (3,1) by turn 35.\n\nThen the food at (1,4) has life span 5, so until turn 37, I can eat it later.\n\n(2,2) is already eaten if I choose to.\n\nBut in the other path, if I go L to (1,3) at turn 33, then U to (1,4) at turn 34, eat that, then U to (1,5) at turn 35, then from there, I can go to (2,5) or (1,6), but (3,1) food will disappear by turn 36, and I'm at (1,5) or above, far from (3,1), so I might miss that food.\n\nFor example, from (1,5) at turn 35, to reach (3,1), I need to go down, but (2,4) is obstacle, so I have to go right or up, not directly down.\n\nFrom (1,5), if I go R to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6) or R to (3,5), cannot D because (2,4) obstacle.\n\nThen to (3,5), I can go down to (3,4), but (3,4) might be free, then to (3,3), but (3,3) is body, which might move.\n\nBut at turn 35, snake positions depend.\n\nLet's simulate both paths.\n\nFirst path: move D at turn 33 to (2,2), eat food.\n\nTurn 33: head to (2,2), eat, so snake: head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) — length 8, tail at (5,6).\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 34: say move R to (3,2) (since going to (3,2) avoids going down to (2,1) which might be dead end).\n\nMove R to (3,2), no food there, so no eat, tail moves: head to (3,2), then body (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5), (5,6) gone. Direction R.\n\nNow at (3,2), can move D to (3,1) or R to (4,2).\n\nFood at (3,1) is there, life span: at turn 34, it was life span 3 at turn 33, after turn 33, life span 2 at turn 34, so still there.\n\nMove D to (3,1) at turn 34, eat food, so grow.\n\nHead to (3,1), eat, so new positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail stays, length 9 now? Original 7, ate two, so 9.\n\nPositions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). Tail at (5,5).\n\nDirection D (since moved down).\n\nNow from (3,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,2), but (3,2) is body, collision. Direction D, moving U opposite, not allowed.\n\n- D: to (3,0), but y=0 wall, deadly.\n\n- L: to (2,1). (2,1) not occupied, no obstacle.\n\n- R: to (4,1). (4,1) not occupied? Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not. Walls no. So free.\n\nSo can go L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nNow, food at (1,4) and (2,2) but (2,2) is body now, not food, food was eaten.\n\n(2,2) food was eaten at turn 33, so no longer food.\n\nOther food: (1,4) at (1,4), life span 5, at turn 34, life span 4? At turn 33 life span 5, turn 34 life span 4, still there.\n\nBut I'm at (3,1), which is bottom, (1,4) is top-left.\n\nI need to go there, but with the snake body, it might be blocked.\n\nFrom here, I can go to (2,1) or (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is near obstacle (5,1), but free.\n\nThen from there, I can move up.\n\nBut let's see the second path first.\n\nSecond path: at turn 33, move L to (1,3).\n\nNo eat, so tail moves: new positions head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5), (5,6) gone. Direction L.\n\nThen turn 34, must move U to (1,4), eat food there.\n\nEat, so grow: head (1,4), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail stays, length 8. Direction U.\n\nThen turn 35, must move U to (1,5), no food there, so no eat, tail moves: head to (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — tail at (4,5), (5,5) gone. Direction U.\n\nNow at (1,5), can move U to (1,6) or R to (2,5), as earlier.\n\nIf I move R to (2,5), then no eat, tail moves: head to (2,5), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4) — tail at (4,4). Direction R (since moved right).\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) obstacle, L to (1,5) body, R to (3,5).\n\nSo U or R.\n\nSay move R to (3,5), no food, tail moves: head to (3,5), body (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — tail at (4,3). Direction R.\n\nNow at (3,5), can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5) body, R to (4,5) but (4,5) is body? Positions: body has (4,3), (4,4), but (4,5) is not in current body? Current positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — so (4,4) and (4,5) are not occupied, since tail moved.\n\nEarlier at turn 35, after move to (1,5), positions: head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5)? Let's trace positions.\n\nAfter turn 34: head (1,4), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 35: move U to (1,5), no eat, so head to (1,5), body: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — tail was (5,5), but no eat, so tail moves off, so new tail is (4,5), positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) is the last body segment, tail.\n\n(4,5) is occupied.\n\nThen at turn 35, head to (1,5), so positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nThen turn 36, move R to (2,5), no food, head to (2,5), body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4) — tail at (4,4), (4,5) gone.\n\nThen turn 37, move to (3,5), no food, head to (3,5), body: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — tail at (4,3).\n\nFrom (3,5), can move D to (3,4), U to (3,6), R to (4,5), or L to (2,5) body.\n\n(4,5) is free now.\n\nBut at this point, turn 37, the food at (3,1) is gone, since life span 3, disappeared at turn 36.\n\nFood at (1,4) was eaten, (2,2) still there but life span 8, long time.\n\nBut I'm at (3,5), far from (2,2).\n\nTo eat (2,2), I need to go down, but (2,4) obstacle, so I have to go around.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) to (3,4) to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, which might move.\n\nAt turn 37, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — so (3,3) is body, so cannot move there yet.\n\nI can go to (4,5) or (3,4), etc.\n\nBut it might take time, and I might get stuck.\n\nWhereas in the first path, I ate both (2,2) and (3,1) quickly, and I'm at (3,1) with options to move to (2,1) or (4,1), then I can go towards (1,4) or other areas.\n\n(1,4) food has life span 5, at turn 33, so until turn 37, I can eat it by turn 37.\n\nIn first path, at turn 34, I ate (3,1), head at (3,1), turn 34.\n\nThen at turn 35, I can move to (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nSay I move L to (2,1), no food, tail moves: from (3,1), head to (2,1), no eat, so positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — tail at (4,5)? Let's list.\n\nAfter turn 34: head (3,1), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 35: move L to (2,1), no food, so head to (2,1), body: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4) — tail at (4,4), (4,5) gone? Positions: head to (2,1), then the segment at (3,1) becomes second, (3,2) third, (2,2) fourth, (2,3) fifth, (3,3) sixth, (4,3) seventh, (4,4) eighth, and (4,5) was tail but no eat, so removed, so tail at (4,4).\n\nDirection L (moved left).\n\nFrom (2,1), possible moves:\n\nU: to (2,2), but (2,2) is body, collision. Direction L, moving U not opposite? L is left, U is up, not opposite, so allowed but to body, death.\n\nD: to (2,0) wall, deadly.\n\nL: to (1,1), free.\n\nR: to (3,1), body, collision.\n\nSo only L to (1,1).\n\nMove to (1,1), no food, tail moves, etc.\n\nThen from (1,1), I can go to (1,2) but obstacle, or U to (1,2) but obstacle, (1,2) is obstacle, so from (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2) obstacle deadly, D to (1,0) wall, L to (0,1) wall, R to (2,1) body. All deadly? U obstacle, D wall, L wall, R body. So stuck, death.\n\nFrom (2,1), if I move L to (1,1), then at (1,1), no moves, all deadly.\n\nSo that's bad.\n\nIn the first path, when at (3,1) after eating, turn 34, I should not go to (2,1), but go to (4,1) instead.\n\nFrom (3,1), turn 34, move R to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) empty, no food, so no eat, tail moves.\n\nHead to (4,1), body: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4) — tail at (4,4), (4,5) gone. Direction R.\n\nNow at (4,1), possible moves:\n\nU: to (4,2). (4,2) free.\n\nD: to (4,0) wall, deadly.\n\nL: to (3,1), body, collision.\n\nR: to (5,1), but (5,1) is obstacle! (5,1) internal obstacle, so deadly.\n\nSo only possible move U to (4,2).\n\nMove to (4,2), no food, tail moves, etc.\n\nThen from (4,2), can go to (4,3) but body, or (3,2), or (5,2), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) is body, so cannot.\n\nPossible moves from (4,2): U to (4,3) body, D to (4,1) body, L to (3,2), R to (5,2).\n\n(3,2) is body? Current positions: head at (4,2), body (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — so (3,2) is body, (4,3) body.\n\nL to (3,2) body, collision.\n\nR to (5,2) free.\n\nU to (4,3) body, collision.\n\nD to (4,1) body, collision.\n\nSo only R to (5,2).\n\nThen to (5,2), and so on.\n\nBut (5,1) is obstacle, so I can go to (5,3) or (6,2), but there are obstacles at (6,1), (6,4), etc.\n\nThis might lead to a dead end.\n\nPerhaps the first choice to move D to (2,2) is risky because it forces me to the bottom with few options.\n\nWhereas the other choice, moving L to (1,3), then U to (1,4), then U to (1,5), then I can go to (2,5), then to (3,5), and the food at (2,2) is still there, and I can eventually go down when the body moves.\n\nFor example, at turn 35, in second path, head at (1,5), I can move R to (2,5) instead of U.\n\nThen from (2,5), move R to (3,5) at turn 36.\n\nThen from (3,5), at turn 37, I can move D to (3,4), since (3,4) should be free.\n\nAt turn 37, positions: as before, head at (3,5), body (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — so (3,4) is free.\n\nMove D to (3,4), no food, tail moves, etc.\n\nThen to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, so cannot immediately.\n\nFrom (3,4), can go to (3,3) when it moves, or to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, or to (4,4), etc.\n\nEventually, I can reach (2,2) to eat.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,4) which I ate, and (3,1) is gone, but I have (2,2) with long life.\n\nBut in terms of score, if I eat (2,2) later, I still get the point, but I missed (3,1).\n\nIn the first path, I ate (2,2) and (3,1), but then got stuck in the bottom.\n\nIn the second path, I ate (1,4) and can eat (2,2) later, missed (3,1).\n\nSo for score, eating two food vs one and a half, but (3,1) is small, life span short.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nIn the bottom, with obstacles, it might be dangerous.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 33, move L to (1,3), then at turn 34 U to (1,4) eat, then at turn 35 U to (1,5), then at turn 36 move R to (2,5), then at turn 37 move U to (2,6) or R to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut from (2,5), I can move R to (3,5), then D to (3,4), then D to (3,3) but when (3,3) is vacated.\n\nThe body is moving, so cells free up.\n\nFor example, at turn 38 or so, (3,3) might be free.\n\nThen I can go to (3,2), then to (2,2) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, the area is more open.\n\nWhereas in the bottom, with (1,2) obstacle, it's tight.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,2) has long life, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut I need to think about the tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, moving L first is better to avoid the bottom trap.\n\nAt turn 33, if I move D to (2,2), I eat it, but then I have to deal with the bottom.\n\nBut at (2,2), after eating, I can move R to (3,2) at turn 34, then from (3,2), I can move R to (4,2) at turn 34? From (3,2), moves: D to (3,1) or R to (4,2).\n\nIf I move R to (4,2), then to (4,2), then I can go U to (4,3) but body, or to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) is body, so not immediately.\n\nBut it might be possible to go right and up.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nI should choose the move that keeps more options open.\n\nSince all food is positive, eating sooner is better for score, but survival first.\n\nIn this case, moving D to (2,2) allows me to eat it now, and then I can eat (3,1) soon, but risk in bottom.\n\nMoving L to (1,3) forces me to eat (1,4) next, and then I can go up, but miss (3,1), but have (2,2) for later.\n\n(2,2) has life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\n(3,1) has only 3 turns, so if I don't eat it, I lose it, but it's only one point.\n\nLong-term, the upper area might be safer.\n\nThere is also the food at (1,4) to eat.\n\nAnother point: the snake is currently blocking the center, so moving left might open space.\n\nI think moving L at turn 33 is better for long-term survival.\n\nThen the sequence would be:\n\nTurn 33: L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 34: U to (1,4) eat\n\nTurn 35: U to (1,5)\n\nThen at turn 35, from (1,5), I can choose to go U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nGoing R to (2,5) might be better to stay lower.\n\nThen Turn 36: R to (2,5)\n\nTurn 37: from (2,5), move R to (3,5)\n\nThen Turn 38: from (3,5), move D to (3,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nEventually, I can head towards (2,2) when possible.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSince t1=33, I need turns 33,34,35,36,37 at least.\n\nBut the actions depend on what happens.\n\nI need to commit to a sequence.\n\nBased on above, I'll go with moving L first.\n\nSo for turn 33: L\n\nTurn 34: U (only choice)\n\nTurn 35: from (1,5), I can go U or R. R to (2,5) is better to avoid top corner.\n\nThen Turn 36: from (2,5), move R to (3,5) or U to (2,6). Better R to (3,5) to go right.\n\nThen Turn 37: from (3,5), move D to (3,4)\n\nBut at that point, I need to see if I can eat (2,2).\n\n(2,2) might be eatable later.\n\nBut for now, let's define the sequence.\n\nTo be safe, I'll plan:\n\nTurn 33: L\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: R (to (2,5))\n\nThen from (2,5), at turn 36, move R to (3,5)\n\nThen from (3,5), at turn 37, move D to (3,4)\n\nThen from (3,4), at turn 38, I can move D to (3,3) or L to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, or R to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut it's getting ahead.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide actions for t1 to t1+4 or something, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is for the turns starting from t1.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how many, but since it says think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide at least 5 actions.\n\nt1=33, so turns 33 to 37 or 38.\n\nBut actions depend on state, so I need to simulate based on initial choice.\n\nSince I choose to move L at 33, then U at 34, then at 35 from (1,5), I choose R to (2,5), then at 36 from (2,5) to (3,5), then at 37 from (3,5) to (3,4), for example.\n\nThen at 38 from (3,4) to (3,3) if free, etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide the first few moves.\n\nPerhaps for turn 33, action is L.\n\nThen for turn 34, action is U.\n\nThen for turn 35, action is R.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut let's confirm if at turn 35, moving R from (1,5) is valid.\n\nPosition at turn 34: after move to (1,4), head at (1,4), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nTurn 35: move U to (1,5), no eat, so head to (1,5), body: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — tail at (4,5)\n\nDirection U.\n\nFrom (1,5), can move U to (1,6) or R to (2,5), as (1,4) is body below, (1,3) further, etc.\n\nMoving R to (2,5) is possible.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 36, from (2,5), direction R (since moved right), can move U to (2,6) or R to (3,5), not D or L.\n\nMoving R to (3,5) is fine.\n\nAt turn 37, from (3,5), direction R, can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), or R to (4,5), not L.\n\nMoving D to (3,4) is good to go down.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nFor the food at (2,2), at some point when (3,3) is free, I can go to (3,2), then to (2,2).\n\nBut for the sequence, I'll provide up to turn 37.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 33: L\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: R\n\nTurn 36: R\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nBut turn 36 action is from (2,5) to (3,5), which is R.\n\nTurn 37 from (3,5) to (3,4) is D.\n\nThen I can add more if needed.\n\nSince the grid is small, I might need to specify.\n\nBut I think for now, this sequence avoids immediate danger and allows long-term survival.\n\nIf I moved D at 33, I might eat more but risk death.\n\nSo I'll go with L.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and simulated multiple turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Current constraints**: The snake head is at (2,3) with direction left (L), so reverse move (right) is not allowed. Moving up to (2,4) is impossible due to an obstacle. Thus, only down (D) to (2,2) or left (L) to (1,3) are viable.\n- **Food priorities**: \n  - (3,1) has a short lifespan (3 turns, disappears after turn 35) and must be eaten soon to avoid loss. \n  - (1,4) has a moderate lifespan (5 turns, disappears after turn 37) and is accessible via the left path. \n  - (2,2) has a long lifespan (8 turns, disappears after turn 40) and can be eaten later.\n- **Risks**: \n  - Moving down to (2,2) at turn 33 eats food immediately but forces the snake into the bottom-left corner, where limited moves and obstacles (e.g., (1,2)) risk trapping the snake by turn 35-37, leading to potential death.\n  - Moving left to (1,3) at turn 33 allows eating (1,4) at turn 34 and avoids the bottom trap. It provides more open space for movement, enabling long-term survival and access to (2,2) later. Missing (3,1) is acceptable as it only costs 1 point, while survival ensures future food opportunities.\n- **Long-term simulation**: After choosing left at turn 33, the snake is forced to move up to (1,4) at turn 34 to eat food and avoid dead ends. From there, moving to (1,5) at turn 35 and then right to (2,5) at turn 36 avoids the top-left corner and stays centered. Continuing right to (3,5) at turn 37 and down to (3,4) at turn 38 positions the snake to access the remaining food (e.g., (2,2)) safely as body segments clear.\n\n**Optimal Action Sequence (Turns 33-37)**:\n- Turn 33: Move left (L) to (1,3) to avoid bottom risk and set up for (1,4) food.\n- Turn 34: Move up (U) to (1,4) to eat food (value +1); only viable move.\n- Turn 35: Move right (R) to (2,5) to prevent trapping in the top row.\n- Turn 36: Move right (R) to (3,5) to continue toward open areas.\n- Turn 37: Move down (D) to (3,4) to descend toward (2,2) and maintain flexibility.\n\nThis sequence ensures survival for 5+ turns, eats one food ((1,4)) by turn 34, and positions the snake to eat (2,2) safely around turn 39-40 after the body clears. (3,1) is skipped to avoid death risks.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 33: L (left)  \nTurn 34: U (up)  \nTurn 35: R (right)  \nTurn 36: R (right)  \nTurn 37: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 34, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I need to avoid these walls and obstacles.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,3), then body segments at (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (1,3) from (2,3) probably.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,1) with value 1, life span 2\n\n- (1,4) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (2,2) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (2,3) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span indicates how many turns left before it disappears, including the current turn. So for (3,1), life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 35 (since current turn is 34, so after this turn, it has one more turn, then gone). Let me clarify:\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 34, life span N means it will be there for N turns starting from now.\n\nFor (3,1): life span 2, so after turn 34, it will have 1 turn left; after turn 35, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 34 or 35.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4): life span 4, so available until turn 37 (34,35,36,37).\n\n(2,2): life span 7, until turn 40.\n\n(2,3): life span 10, until turn 43.\n\nBut (2,3) is currently occupied by the snake's body! It's the second segment. Snake positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), which is the first body segment.\n\nFood at (2,3) has value 1, life span 10. But it's under the snake's body. According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. So currently, since it's occupied, it can't be eaten now. We need to move such that the body leaves (2,3), and later the head can move there.\n\nAlso, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\" – if head is adjacent to the tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nTail is at (5,5). Head is at (1,3), which is not adjacent to (5,5). Adjacent means up, down, left, right, so (1,3) to (5,5) is far, not adjacent. So no immediate danger there.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so we just moved left to (1,3). Since we can't instant reverse, we cannot move right (R) on the next turn because that would be opposite to current direction L. So possible moves from (1,3) are U (up to (1,4)), D (down to (1,2)), or continue L (left to (0,3)), but x=0 is a wall, so left to (0,3) is invalid because it's a border wall.\n\nLet's list possible actions for turn 34.\n\nCurrent position: head at (1,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: up to (1,4)\n\n- D: down to (1,2)\n\n- L: left to (0,3) – but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- R: right to (2,3) – but (2,3) is occupied by the body, and also reverse direction is not allowed? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So moving R is not allowed because it would be instant reverse.\n\nRules: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nSo from direction L, cannot move R on next turn. Also, L is to (0,3) which is wall, so invalid.\n\nSo only possible moves are U or D.\n\nU: to (1,4)\n\nD: to (1,2)\n\nNow, (1,4) has food! Food at (1,4) with value 1, life span 4.\n\n(1,4) is a valid cell? Walls: internal obstacles include (1,2), but not (1,4). Border walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (1,4) is within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,4) is not listed, so it should be free, except for food or snake.\n\nSnake is at (1,3), (2,3), etc., not at (1,4), so (1,4) is free with food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (1,2), so (1,2) is a wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo for turn 34, possible moves:\n\n- U to (1,4): this cell has food, and it's free to move? But we need to check if moving there causes collision or other issues.\n\nSince (1,4) is not occupied by body or wall, moving to (1,4) should be fine, and we eat the food, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nBut let's confirm the food eating. Food at (1,4) is positive, so eating it increases length by one.\n\nAfter eating, the new head is at (1,4), and the tail remains until we move, but when we move, the tail moves forward only if no growth, but since we eat, we grow, so tail stays, and new segment added.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake grows.\n\nIn terms of positions: after moving to food, head is at food position, and the tail doesn't move, so snake gains one segment.\n\nNow, is there any danger? Head at (1,4), which is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (5,5), which is not adjacent; (1,4) to (5,5) is distance, not adjacent.\n\nBut let's think about the future.\n\nFirst, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there's food at (2,3) which is under the body. Currently, (2,3) is occupied by the snake body, so we can't eat it now. If we move away, and later come back, we might eat it.\n\nBut life span is 10, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nBut for now, turn 34, I can move U to (1,4) and eat the food there.\n\nMove D to (1,2), but (1,2) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there. Only U is possible? D to (1,2) is invalid because it's a wall.\n\n(1,2) is listed in internal obstacles, so yes, cannot move there.\n\nL to (0,3) is wall, R is instant reverse and also occupied, but even if not, reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (1,4). Is that right?\n\nCurrent head at (1,3), move U to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is not wall, not occupied, has food.\n\nAfter moving, we eat the food, so snake grows: new positions would be head at (1,4), then the previous head (1,3) becomes body, and so on, with tail at (5,5) still, since we grew.\n\nLet's list new snake positions after moving U to (1,4):\n\nCurrent positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nAfter move U to (1,4): head moves to (1,4), and since we eat food, we don't remove the tail, so new positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] so now 8 segments.\n\nTail is still at (5,5).\n\nDirection: we moved U, so new head direction is U.\n\nNow, for turn 35, we need to move from there.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating the food if it leads to danger, but in this case, moving U seems the only choice, since D is wall, L and R not possible.\n\nIs there any other option? No, only U is valid move.\n\nSo for turn 34, I must move U to (1,4) and eat the food.\n\nThen, on turn 35, head at (1,4), direction U.\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,4):\n\n- U: up to (1,5)\n\n- D: down to (1,3) – but (1,3) is now a body segment? After move, positions: head (1,4), then (1,3), (2,3), etc. So (1,3) is the second segment, so moving D to (1,3) would collide with body.\n\n- L: left to (0,4) – x=0 is wall, invalid.\n\n- R: right to (2,4) – (2,4) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Yes, (2,4) is an obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo possible moves from (1,4):\n\nU to (1,5)\n\nD to (1,3) – but (1,3) is occupied by body, collision.\n\nL to (0,4) – wall.\n\nR to (2,4) – wall (obstacle).\n\nSo only possible move is U to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) should be free? Let's check.\n\nWalls: y=0 and y=7 borders, so (1,5) is within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) – none at (1,5).\n\nSnake positions: after move to (1,4), positions are (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). So (1,5) not occupied.\n\nSo moving U to (1,5) is valid, no food there.\n\nAfter moving, no food eaten, so tail moves: head to (1,5), then body: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and tail (5,5) moves to (4,5)? When no eat, tail moves forward.\n\nCurrent positions before move: [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nAfter moving U to (1,5) without eating: new head (1,5), then the body segments shift, so new positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] and tail is removed, so (5,5) is gone, but since we moved to (1,5), which has no food, we don't grow, so tail moves: the last segment (5,5) is removed, and head moves to (1,5), so positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So tail is at (4,5).\n\nNow, direction is U.\n\nTurn 36: head at (1,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: up to (1,6)\n\n- D: down to (1,4) – but (1,4) is now a body segment? Positions: (1,5), (1,4), ... so (1,4) is the second segment, so moving D to (1,4) would collide.\n\n- L: left to (0,5) – x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- R: right to (2,5) – is (2,5) free? Walls: no walls at (2,5), obstacles not there. Snake: not occupied, so possible.\n\nSo moves: U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nNow, need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,1), but life span 2, at turn 34 it had life span 2, so on turn 35 it has life span 1, then disappears after turn 35. So on turn 36, it's gone. But we are at turn 36 now, head at (1,5), (3,1) is far, and we can't reach it in one move, so we can't eat it; it will be gone after turn 35, so not available.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,4) we already ate on turn 34.\n\nFood at (2,2) with life span 7, so available until turn 40.\n\nFood at (2,3) under body, life span 10, until turn 43.\n\nBut (2,3) is currently occupied; in the positions, after turn 35, snake is at (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), etc., so (2,3) is still occupied by body.\n\nTo eat (2,3), we need to move such that the body leaves (2,3), then head can move there later.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is free, but has food.\n\nNow, back to turn 36 choices.\n\nFrom (1,5), we can go U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf we go U to (1,6), then:\n\nTurn 36: move U to (1,6)\n\nThen positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // tail at (4,4)? Let's list: from previous, after turn 35: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] tail (4,5)\n\nAfter move U to (1,6) no eat: new head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4) and tail removed, so (4,5) gone, positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nNow at (1,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 37: possible moves from (1,6):\n\nU to (1,7) – but y=7 is border wall, invalid.\n\nD to (1,5) – body segment, collision.\n\nL to (0,6) – wall.\n\nR to (2,6) – possible? (2,6) free? No walls or obstacles, not snake, so yes.\n\nSo only R to (2,6).\n\nMove to (2,6), no food, so positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)  // tail (4,4) removed? After move: from [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)] move to (2,6), no eat, so new head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) and tail (4,4) gone. Positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow turn 38: from (2,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (2,7) – y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (2,5) – possible? (2,5) should be free.\n\nL to (1,6) – but (1,6) is body segment, collision.\n\nR to (3,6) – possible.\n\nSo U invalid, D to (2,5), L invalid, R to (3,6).\n\nBoth D and R possible.\n\n(2,5) might have food? Food positions: (2,2) has food, not (2,5). (3,1) gone, (1,4) eaten, (2,2) and (2,3) food.\n\n(2,5) no food.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) no food.\n\nNow, if we go D to (2,5), or R to (3,6).\n\nBut we need to think about eating food.\n\nFood at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is below.\n\nFrom (2,6), moving D to (2,5) gets closer to (2,2).\n\nThen from (2,5), we can go D to (2,4), but (2,4) is an internal obstacle! (2,4) is wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (2,4) is listed, so cannot move to (2,4).\n\nSo from (2,6), if move D to (2,5), then at (2,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 38: if at (2,5), moves:\n\nU to (2,6) – but (2,6) is body? After moving to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), etc., so (2,6) is second segment, so U to (2,6) collision.\n\nD to (2,4) – but (2,4) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,5) – (1,5) is body? Positions: from turn 37 end: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nAfter move to (2,5): no eat, so new head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) and tail (4,3) gone. Positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nSo at (2,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nMoves:\n\nU to (2,6) – but (2,6) is body segment, collision.\n\nD to (2,4) – wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,5) – (1,5) is body segment? Positions: (1,5) is the fourth segment? List: head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), ... so (1,5) is the fourth, but L to (1,5) is left to (1,5), which is occupied, so collision.\n\nR to (3,5) – possible? (3,5) free? Walls no, obstacles no, snake: positions have (3,3) but not (3,5), so should be free.\n\nSo only R to (3,5) possible.\n\nMove to (3,5), no food, etc.\n\nThis seems messy, and we're going away from food.\n\nBack to turn 36 at (1,5), instead of going U, we could go R to (2,5).\n\nLet's consider that path.\n\nTurn 36: from (1,5), instead of U, go R to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is free? Yes, as before.\n\nMove to (2,5), no food, so positions: from turn 35: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] move to (2,5) no eat, new head (2,5), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4) and tail (4,5) gone. Positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow turn 37: from (2,5), direction R.\n\nMoves:\n\nU to (2,6)\n\nD to (2,4) – but (2,4) is wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,5) – body, collision.\n\nR to (3,5)\n\nSo possible U to (2,6) or R to (3,5).\n\n(2,6) no food, (3,5) no food.\n\nIf we go U to (2,6), similar to before.\n\nOr R to (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,5), we can go to (3,6) or (4,5) or (3,4), but (4,5) might be body, etc.\n\nBut we have food at (2,2) and (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is currently occupied in the body, but in these positions, (2,3) is a body segment.\n\nIn current positions after turn 36: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)] so (2,3) is the fifth segment.\n\nTo eat the food at (2,3), we need to move so that the body leaves (2,3), then head can move there.\n\nSimilarly for (2,2).\n\nFirst, let's go back to the beginning.\n\nAt turn 34, we have to move U to (1,4), as only choice.\n\nThen turn 35, only move U to (1,5).\n\nThen turn 36, we have choices: U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf we go R to (2,5), we are closer to the food area.\n\nFrom (2,5), on turn 37, we can go R to (3,5) or U to (2,6).\n\nIf we go R to (3,5), then from (3,5), we can go down to (3,4) or right to (4,5) or up to (3,6), etc.\n\n(3,4) might be free? Let's see the area.\n\nAlso, food at (3,1) is gone by now.\n\nFood at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is below.\n\nFrom (2,5), if we go down, but (2,4) is wall, so we can't go directly down.\n\nFrom (2,5), only U or R possible, as D and L not valid.\n\nU to (2,6) or R to (3,5).\n\nIf we go to (3,5), then at (3,5), direction R.\n\nMoves from (3,5):\n\nU to (3,6)\n\nD to (3,4) – is (3,4) free? Walls: no, obstacles: (2,4) is wall, but (3,4) not listed, so should be free. Snake: not occupied yet.\n\nL to (2,5) – body, collision.\n\nR to (4,5) – (4,5) is in the snake positions? In current, (4,4) is tail, but (4,5) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 36 positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)] so (4,5) is not occupied, so free.\n\nSo from (3,5), can go U to (3,6), D to (3,4), or R to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) might be food? No, food at (2,2), (2,3), etc.\n\nTo get to (2,2), we need to go down, but from (3,5), we can go D to (3,4), then from (3,4) to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, or to (2,4) but (2,4) wall, or to (4,4) which is body.\n\nLet's list positions to avoid.\n\nPerhaps we should consider the food at (2,3) that is under the body.\n\nCurrently at turn 34, (2,3) is occupied, but if we move the snake, it might free up.\n\nLet's simulate from turn 34 with the only path.\n\nTurn 34: move U to (1,4) - eat food, snake grows to 8 segments: [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] tail (5,5)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 35: move U to (1,5) - no food, so snake moves, tail moves: new positions [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] tail (4,5) since (5,5) removed.\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 36: now at (1,5), can move U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf we move R to (2,5): no food, positions [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)] tail (4,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 37: from (2,5), move R to (3,5) or U to (2,6).\n\nLet's say we move R to (3,5) to get closer to center.\n\nMove to (3,5) no food, positions [(3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] tail (4,4) removed, so tail (4,3)? Positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) so tail (4,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 38: from (3,5), can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), or R to (4,5).\n\nL to (2,5) collision.\n\nNow, (3,4) is free, D to (3,4).\n\nMove to (3,4) no food, positions [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)] tail (4,3) removed, so positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)] tail (3,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 39: from (3,4), direction D.\n\nMoves:\n\nU to (3,5) - body, collision\n\nD to (3,3) - body, collision\n\nL to (2,4) - wall, invalid\n\nR to (4,4) - possible? (4,4) free? Walls no, obstacles no, snake: positions have (3,3) but not (4,4), so free.\n\nBut (4,4) is not occupied, so can move R to (4,4).\n\nMove to (4,4) no food, positions [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)] tail (3,3) removed, so positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)] tail (2,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, at this point, (2,3) is the tail, and there is food at (2,3) with life span 10, still available.\n\nBut the head is at (4,4), not adjacent to tail (2,3).\n\nIf we can move the head to (2,3) when it's free, but currently it's occupied by tail.\n\nTo eat the food at (2,3), we need the head to move onto it after the body has moved away.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (2,3), so when the snake moves, the tail will move if no growth, freeing (2,3).\n\nFor example, on turn 40, if we move such that the tail moves, freeing (2,3), then later head can move there.\n\nBut life span is long, so possible.\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,2) is still there.\n\nBut let's see where we are.\n\nFrom turn 36, if instead of R to (2,5), we went U to (1,6).\n\nTurn 36: from (1,5) move U to (1,6), positions [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)] tail (4,4)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 37: move R to (2,6) as only choice, positions [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] tail (4,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 38: from (2,6), can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nSay move D to (2,5), positions [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)] tail (4,3) removed, so positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)] tail (3,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 39: from (2,5), can only move R to (3,5) as before, etc.\n\nSimilar situation.\n\nBut in both cases, we are not eating food and the snake is moving around.\n\nBut we need to eat the food at (2,2) or (2,3).\n\n(2,2) is free, so we can go there directly if possible.\n\nFrom the state after turn 35, head at (1,5), we can move R to (2,5) on turn 36, then from (2,5) on turn 37, we can only move U or R, not down because of wall.\n\nFrom (2,5), move U to (2,6) or R to (3,5).\n\nIf we move to (2,6), then from (2,6) on turn 38, we can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf we move D to (2,5), but (2,5) is body if we came from there, but in positions, it might be free later.\n\nLet's think about reaching (2,2).\n\nFrom (1,5), if we go R to (2,5) on turn 36.\n\nThen on turn 37, from (2,5) move R to (3,5).\n\nThen on turn 38, from (3,5) move D to (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 39, from (3,4) move R to (4,4) or L to (2,4) but (2,4) wall, so R to (4,4).\n\nThen from (4,4) on turn 40, we can move U to (4,5) or D to (4,3) or L to (3,4) body or R to (5,4).\n\n(4,3) is body? Positions after turn 39: let's not go there.\n\nPerhaps from (3,4) on turn 39, instead of R, we can go D to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, collision.\n\nOr U to (3,5) body.\n\nSo only R to (4,4).\n\nThen from (4,4) on turn 40, moves:\n\nU to (4,5) - possible\n\nD to (4,3) - (4,3) is body? In positions after turn 39: from (3,4) moved to (4,4), no eat, so positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) tail (3,3) removed, so positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)] tail (2,3)\n\nSo at (4,4), direction R (from moving right).\n\nMoves:\n\nU to (4,5) - free? No walls, no obstacles, not snake, so yes.\n\nD to (4,3) - (4,3) is not in positions, so free? Positions have (1,3), (2,3), but (4,3) not listed, so free.\n\nL to (3,4) - body, collision.\n\nR to (5,4) - possible.\n\nSo U, D, or R possible.\n\n(4,5) no food, (4,3) no food, (5,4) might be wall? Internal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, but (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\nBut we have food at (2,2) and (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is the tail at this point.\n\nOn turn 40, if we move, the tail will move from (2,3) if no growth, freeing (2,3).\n\nFor example, if on turn 40 we move to (4,3), no eat, then tail moves from (2,3) to... the second last is (2,3), but when head moves, the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment.\n\nPositions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) tail\n\nAfter moving to (4,3) no eat: new head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) and tail (2,3) removed, so (2,3) is freed, and the food is there, but the head is not on it.\n\nSo (2,3) is now free with food, but head is at (4,3).\n\nThen we can try to move to (2,3) later.\n\nBut it's far.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is free with food.\n\nBut to reach (2,2) from (4,3), we need to go left and down, but there are walls and body.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), we can go L to (3,3) or D to (4,2) or U to (4,4) body or R to (5,3).\n\n(3,3) might be free or not.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] so (3,3) is free.\n\nSo from (4,3), can go L to (3,3) or D to (4,2) or R to (5,3), etc.\n\nThen to (2,2), from (3,3) go L to (2,3) but (2,3) has food, or D to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) has food, so if we go to (2,3), we can eat it.\n\nBut let's see the tail danger.\n\nFirst, at turn 34, we have to move U.\n\nThen turn 35, move U.\n\nThen turn 36, if we move R to (2,5), we can then move down later.\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 37, we can only move U or R, not down.\n\nBut from (2,5), move U to (2,6), then from (2,6) on turn 38, we can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf we move D to (2,5), but (2,5) is the previous position, but in positions, when we move to (2,6) on turn 37, positions are [(2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] if we came from turn 36 R to (2,5), then turn 37 U to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) tail (4,3)\n\nThen turn 38, from (2,6) move D to (2,5) – but (2,5) is body segment, collision, cannot.\n\nMove R to (3,6).\n\nThen to (3,6), etc.\n\nSo we cannot move down from (2,5) or (2,6) easily.\n\nThe only way to go down is from other points.\n\nPerhaps from the start, at turn 36, when at (1,5), move R to (2,5), then on turn 37, move R to (3,5), then on turn 38, move D to (3,4), then on turn 39, we can move L to (2,4) but (2,4) wall, or D to (3,3) but (3,3) body, or R to (4,4), as before.\n\nNo way to go to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), and from (1,3) at turn 34, we could have gone down but (1,2) is wall, so not possible.\n\nSo perhaps we cannot reach (2,2) easily, or it might be blocked.\n\nLet's list all cells to see.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders and internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo row y=2, x=1 is wall, so (1,2) wall.\n\ny=4, x=2 is wall, so (2,4) wall.\n\netc.\n\nCell (2,2): no wall, no obstacle listed, so free.\n\nBut to reach (2,2) from current position.\n\nFrom head at (1,3) at turn 34, we moved to (1,4), then (1,5), so we are at y=5, while (2,2) is at y=2.\n\nWith walls at (1,2) and (2,4), it might be hard to get down.\n\nFrom (1,3), we could have moved D to (1,2) but it's wall, so not possible.\n\nFrom other positions, the snake body is blocking the path.\n\nFor example, after turn 35, head at (1,5), body at (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), etc., so to go to (2,2), we need to go to (2,3) but it's occupied, or (1,2) wall, so no direct path.\n\nFrom (2,5), we can go to (2,6) or (3,5), both at y=6 or x=3, not down.\n\nSo it seems (2,2) is inaccessible due to walls and snake body.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is occupied, but when the tail moves, it might be free.\n\nBut to eat it, head needs to move there.\n\nSo perhaps we should plan to move the head to (2,3) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, at turn 34, (2,3) is body.\n\nAfter we move, on turn 35, positions: after move U to (1,4), positions [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] so (2,3) is third segment.\n\nOn turn 35, we move U to (1,5), positions [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] so (2,3) is fourth segment.\n\nOn turn 36, if we move R to (2,5), positions [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)] so (2,3) is fifth segment.\n\nIf we move U to (1,6), positions [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)] (2,3) fifth.\n\nOver turns, (2,3) moves towards the tail.\n\nFor example, after several moves, when (2,3) becomes the tail, then when we move, if we don't eat, the tail moves, freeing (2,3), then we can move head there to eat the food.\n\nBut the food is at (2,3), so when it's free, we can eat it by moving there.\n\nBut there is a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut in this case, when the tail is at (2,3) with food, and we move head to it, if head is adjacent, it might be dangerous.\n\nBut let's see when (2,3) becomes tail.\n\nIn the positions, (2,3) is moving towards tail.\n\nFor example, in the sequence after turn 36 R to (2,5), positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)] so segments: 0:(2,5), 1:(1,5), 2:(1,4), 3:(1,3), 4:(2,3), 5:(3,3), 6:(4,3), 7:(4,4) tail.\n\n(2,3) is index 4.\n\nAfter each move without eating, the tail index increases.\n\nAfter turn 37, move to (3,5), positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] so (2,3) is index 5.\n\nTurn 38 move to (3,4), positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)] so (2,3) index 6.\n\nTurn 39 move to (4,4), positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)] so (2,3) is now the tail.\n\nOn turn 39, tail is at (2,3) with food.\n\nHead is at (4,4), not adjacent to (2,3).\n\nOn turn 40, if we move, say to (4,3), no eat, then tail moves from (2,3) to the previous position of the second last segment, which is (1,3), so (2,3) is freed, and food is there.\n\nPositions after move to (4,3): head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) and tail (2,3) removed, so (2,3) is free with food.\n\nHead at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (2,3).\n\nThen we can move towards (2,3).\n\nFor example, from (4,3) on turn 40, we can move L to (3,3) or D to (4,2) or U to (4,4) body or R to (5,3).\n\n(3,3) is free? Positions: after move, positions are [(4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] so (3,3) not occupied, free.\n\nMove L to (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3) on turn 41, move L to (2,3) to eat the food.\n\nBut when we move to (2,3), it has food, so we eat it, grow.\n\nBut is there tail danger? Tail is at (1,3), and head at (3,3), moving to (2,3), which is adjacent to tail (1,3)? (2,3) and (1,3) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBefore moving, head at (3,3), tail at (1,3), not adjacent.\n\nAfter moving to (2,3), head at (2,3), and since we eat, we grow, so new tail is the previous tail, at (1,3), and head at (2,3), which are adjacent.\n\nAccording to \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nIn this case, when we move to (2,3), the tail is at (1,3), which is adjacent to (2,3), and the tail cell has food? The food is at (2,3), not at the tail cell.\n\nThe rule: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n\nBut here, when we eat at (2,3), the food is at head cell, not at tail cell.\n\nThe tail cell is (1,3), which may not have food.\n\nFood is at (2,3), which is where head is moving.\n\nSo the danger is only if the tail cell has food and head is adjacent, then eating that food kills.\n\nBut in this case, we are eating food at head position, not at tail.\n\nSo no danger.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo it's when the tail cell has food, and head is adjacent, then if you eat that food (by moving to the tail cell), it causes collision because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail are at same position? No.\n\nSuppose tail is at T, with food, and head is adjacent to T. If head moves to T, it eats the food, so snake grows: head moves to T, and since eat, tail stays, so new head at T, new tail at T? No.\n\nPositions: before move, head at H adjacent to tail T.\n\nMove head to T, eat food at T.\n\nThen new head position is T.\n\nThe body: the previous head position becomes new body, and since eat, tail does not move, so the tail T remains as part of the body, but since head moved to T, T is now head, and the previous body is there.\n\nBut the new tail is the same as before, since no move.\n\nExample: snake positions [H, A, B, C, T] with food at T.\n\nHead H adjacent to T.\n\nMove head to T, eat food.\n\nNew positions: [T, H, A, B, C, T] but T is duplicated? No.\n\nWhen you move to food, head moves to food position, and the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment.\n\nSo from [H, A, B, C, T], move head to T (which has food), so new positions: [T, H, A, B, C] and the tail is still C? Let's index.\n\nSegments: 0: head, 1,2,3,4: tail.\n\nPositions: seg0 at H, seg1 at A, seg2 at B, seg3 at C, seg4 at T.\n\nMove head to T, which is where seg4 is.\n\nAfter move, new head at T, then the previous head H becomes seg1, so new positions: seg0 at T, seg1 at H, seg2 at A, seg3 at B, seg4 at C, and since eat, we add a new segment at the tail, so seg5 at C? Or the tail position stays.\n\nStandard: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail position, but since we add a segment, the positions are [new_head, old_head, old_seg1, old_seg2, ..., old_tail] so length increases.\n\nIn this case, new head at T, then old head H, then A, B, C, and the old tail T is no longer, but we have seg0: T, seg1: H, seg2: A, seg3: B, seg4: C, and since we eat, we add a new segment at the end, which is at the old tail position, but the old tail position was T, but T is now head, so it's messy.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nTypically in snake, when you move to a food cell, the head moves to the food, the body follows, but the tail does not advance, so the snake grows by one.\n\nSo positions: suppose before move, segments: P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail).\n\nYou move to a new cell F which has food.\n\nNew head at F.\n\nThen new body: P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk.\n\nSo the tail is still at Pk, and you have an additional segment, so new positions: [F, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with length k+2 segments.\n\nIn the case where F is the tail position, Pk.\n\nHead moves to Pk, which has food.\n\nNew positions: [Pk, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk-1, Pk] but Pk is duplicated? No.\n\nPositions: new head at F = Pk.\n\nThen new body starts with old head P0, then P1, P2, ..., up to old tail Pk.\n\nBut Pk is now the head, so the body has P0, P1, ..., Pk-1, Pk.\n\nBut Pk is listed twice? No: the segments are: seg0: F = Pk (new head), seg1: P0 (old head), seg2: P1, ..., segk: Pk-1, segk+1: Pk (old tail).\n\nBut seg0 and segk+1 are both at Pk, so collision immediately.\n\nYes, that's the danger.\n\nIf you move the head to the tail position when it has food, you collide because the new head and the new tail are at the same position.\n\nIn the rule, it says \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo in this case, for the food at (2,3), when it becomes the tail, if head is adjacent and moves to it, it will collide.\n\nBut if head is not adjacent, it might be ok, but when you move to it, if it's not the current position, but if it's the tail position, moving to it causes collision.\n\nIn general, moving to a cell that is occupied by the body causes collision, except for the tail, because the tail will move.\n\nBut when the tail has food, and you move to it, it's a special case where collision occurs.\n\nBack to our plan.\n\nFor turn 34, we must move U to (1,4).\n\nTurn 35, move U to (1,5).\n\nThen for turn 36, we have a choice: U or R.\n\nIf we move R to (2,5), we can eventually free (2,3) and eat it when head is not adjacent.\n\nFor example, on turn 39, tail is at (2,3), head at (4,4), not adjacent.\n\nOn turn 40, we move to (4,3) or other, freeing (2,3).\n\nThen on turn 41, head at (4,3), we can move to (3,3), then turn 42 to (2,3) to eat.\n\nBut when we move to (2,3) on turn 42, is it free? Yes, freed on turn 40.\n\nLife span of (2,3) is 10 at turn 34, so at turn 42, turn count: turn 34 to 42 is 9 turns, life span 10, so at turn 42, it has 10-8=2 turns left? Life span at turn 34 is 10, so it disappears after turn 43, so at turn 42, it has one turn left, can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut when we eat at (2,3), head moves there, and tail is at (1,3) or wherever, but not adjacent at that point, so no danger.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,2), we can try to eat it first.\n\nBut (2,2) is free now, but we can't reach it.\n\nSo perhaps the best is to go for (2,3) when possible.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output the actions for turn 34 and at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 34: move U\n\nTurn 35: move U\n\nTurn 36: move R (to (2,5)) to start moving towards the area.\n\nThen turn 37: move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 38: move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 39: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 40: move D to (4,3) or other, but let's specify.\n\nSince the food at (2,2) might be eaten if we can, but we can't, so focus on (2,3).\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 39, tail is at (2,3) with food.\n\nOn turn 40, if we move, tail moves, freeing (2,3), so we can plan to move head to (2,3) soon.\n\nFrom turn 39 positions: head at (4,4), tail at (2,3)\n\nMove on turn 40, say to (4,3) (D), then positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail (2,3) removed, so (2,3) free.\n\nThen turn 41: from (4,3) move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 42: from (3,3) move L to (2,3) and eat food.\n\nThen grow.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: R\n\nTurn 37: R (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 38: D (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 39: R (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 40: D (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 41: L (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 42: L (to (2,3)) eat\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output from turn 34 for at least 5 turns, so up to turn 39 or so.\n\nTurn 34 to 34+5=39.\n\nSo 6 turns: 34 to 39.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: R\n\nTurn 37: R\n\nTurn 38: D\n\nTurn 39: R\n\nBut on turn 39, moving to (4,4), which is fine.\n\nThen beyond that, we can eat on turn 42.\n\nBut for the output, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be the actions for each turn, starting from t1.\n\nAnd since we must move U on 34 and 35, then on 36 we have choice, but moving R seems better to free the food faster.\n\nIf we move U on 36 to (1,6), it takes longer.\n\nSo I think R is better.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,2) with life span 7, at turn 34, so until turn 40, but we may not reach it, so ignore.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: R\n\nTurn 37: R\n\nTurn 38: D\n\nTurn 39: R\n\nBut turn 38 D to (3,4), turn 39 R to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 40 D to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut for output, up to turn 39 for 5 turns ahead from 34.\n\nFrom 34 to 39 is 6 actions, but turns 34 to 39 inclusive is 6 turns.\n\nt1=34, think ahead to t1+5=39, so actions for turns 34 to 39.\n\n6 turns.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo for 5+ turns ahead, probably output 6 actions.\n\nPerhaps output as many as needed, but at least 5.\n\nIn this case, I think 6 actions are fine.\n\nSo let's finalize.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I need to plan at least 5 turns ahead (from turn 34 to turn 39) based on the current state. The key constraints and opportunities are:\n- **Current head position and direction**: Head at (1,3), direction left (L). Due to no instant reverse, moving right (R) is invalid. Moving left (L) to (0,3) is invalid (wall). Moving down (D) to (1,2) is invalid (internal obstacle). Thus, the only valid move on turn 34 is up (U) to (1,4), eating the positive food there.\n- **Food availability**: \n  - (3,1): Life span 2 (disappears after turn 35), unreachable by turn 35 due to distance—ignore.\n  - (1,4): Eaten on turn 34.\n  - (2,2): Life span 7 (available until turn 40), but currently blocked by walls and snake body—may be inaccessible or risky to pursue.\n  - (2,3): Life span 10 (available until turn 43), currently under the snake body. To eat it, the body must move away, freeing the cell, and the head must move onto it later. Planning to free and eat this food around turn 42 is feasible and high-value.\n- **Movement constraints**: After turn 34, the snake grows to 8 segments. Subsequent moves must avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions while considering future food access.\n- **Risk avoidance**: The \"Tail Reward Danger\" is not immediate (tail at (5,5) is not adjacent to head). When targeting (2,3) later, ensure the head is not adjacent to the tail when eating to prevent collision.\n\n### Path Planning (Turns 34-39)\n1. **Turn 34 (t=34)**: Only valid move is U to (1,4), eating food. New head direction: U. Snake grows to 8 segments.\n2. **Turn 35 (t=35)**: From (1,4), direction U. Only valid move is U to (1,5) (D to (1,3) is body collision, L and R are invalid). No food eaten. New head direction: U.\n3. **Turn 36 (t=36)**: From (1,5), direction U. Valid moves: U to (1,6) or R to (2,5). Moving R to (2,5) is chosen to position the snake closer to the center and facilitate freeing (2,3) for future eating. No food eaten.\n4. **Turn 37 (t=37)**: From (2,5), direction R (after moving R). Valid moves: U to (2,6) or R to (3,5). Moving R to (3,5) is chosen to continue toward the right, avoiding dead ends and aligning for downward movement. No food eaten.\n5. **Turn 38 (t=38)**: From (3,5), direction R. Valid moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), or R to (4,5). Moving D to (3,4) is chosen to descend toward row y=3, where (2,3) is located, and avoid obstacles. No food eaten.\n6. **Turn 39 (t=39)**: From (3,4), direction D (after moving D). Valid moves: Only R to (4,4) (U and D are body collisions, L to (2,4) is wall). Moving R to (4,4) positions the snake to free (2,3) on turn 40 and approach it for eating around turn 42. No food eaten.\n\n### Long-term Outlook (Beyond Turn 39)\n- **Turn 40**: From (4,4), move D to (4,3). This frees (2,3) as the tail moves to (1,3). (2,3) now has food and is unoccupied.\n- **Turn 41**: From (4,3), move L to (3,3) to approach (2,3).\n- **Turn 42**: From (3,3), move L to (2,3) to eat the food, growing the snake. Head at (2,3) is not adjacent to tail (at (1,3) or similar), avoiding Tail Reward Danger.\n\nThis plan safely eats one food on turn 34 and sets up for a second food on turn 42, maximizing score while maintaining a clear path for survival. The food at (2,2) is not pursued due to access issues and lower priority.\n\n### Answer\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 34: U (up)  \nTurn 35: U (up)  \nTurn 36: R (right)  \nTurn 37: R (right)  \nTurn 38: D (down)  \nTurn 39: R (right)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 2D grid. The grid has walls, and I need to avoid them. The walls are at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So, I can't move to these cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,4), then body segments: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). So, the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to get to (1,4) from (1,3)? Let me list the positions:\n\n- Head: (1,4)\n\n- Segment 1: (1,3) – directly below head\n\n- Segment 2: (2,3)\n\n- Segment 3: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 5: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 6: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 7: (5,5) – tail\n\nHead direction is U, meaning it's facing up. Since it's at (1,4) and came from (1,3), which is below, so moving up makes sense.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,1) with value 1 and life span 1\n\n- (2,2) with value 1 and life span 6\n\n- (2,3) with value 1 and life span 9\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (3,1), life span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 35, it has life span 1, so if not eaten now, it disappears after this turn. Similarly, (2,2) has life span 6, so it will last 6 more turns, and (2,3) has 9 turns.\n\nBut (2,3) is a food position, and looking at snake positions, (2,3) is occupied by the snake's body segment. Specifically, it's the second body segment after head.\n\nFood can spawn under snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n\nSo for (2,3), since it's under the snake, I can't eat it now because the body is there. I need to move such that the body leaves that cell, and then head can move to it later.\n\nSimilarly, other food is free, but (3,1) is about to expire.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 35. I should think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. Grid size: from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, but walls on borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to6? Wait no, walls are at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo let's list all blocked cells:\n\n- Border: all x=0, all x=7, all y=0, all y=7\n\n- Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow snake positions: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nFood: (3,1), (2,2), (2,3) but (2,3) is occupied.\n\nAvailable food: (3,1) and (2,2) are free, (2,3) is under snake.\n\nHead at (1,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: since head is facing up, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move down immediately. Possible moves: Up (y+1), Left (x-1), Right (x+1).\n\nNow from (1,4):\n\n- Up: to (1,5)\n\n- Left: to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, so invalid\n\n- Right: to (2,4)\n\nRight to (2,4): but (2,4) is an internal obstacle! (2,4) is listed as an internal obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)] yes, (2,4) is a wall.\n\nSo moving right to (2,4) is invalid, collision with wall.\n\nMoving left to (0,4) is border wall, invalid.\n\nMoving up to (1,5): is (1,5) free? Let's see.\n\nSnake positions: head (1,4), then (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). So (1,5) is not occupied by snake.\n\nIs it a wall? y=5, x=1, border walls are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (1,5) should be free. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,5) not listed. So (1,5) is free.\n\nBut what about food? No food at (1,5).\n\nAlso, after moving, the snake will shift: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nBut for movement, I need to check if the move is safe.\n\nFrom (1,4), moving up to (1,5): is it safe?\n\n(1,5) is empty, no wall, no snake body? Body segments are at (1,3), (2,3), etc., not at (1,5). So yes, moving to (1,5) should be safe for this turn.\n\nBut I have to think ahead.\n\nOther moves: left and right are invalid, so only possible move is Up? That can't be right.\n\nCurrent position (1,4), head.\n\nPossible directions: U, D, L, R but D is reverse, not allowed. L is to (0,4) wall. R to (2,4) wall. U to (1,5) seems ok.\n\nBut (1,5) is within bounds? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=5, x=1, should be ok.\n\nGrid: x=0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x:1 to 6. Similarly y:1 to 6.\n\n(1,5): x=1, y=5, both between 1 and 6, and not an internal obstacle, so free.\n\nBut is there any issue? The snake body: after moving, head to (1,5), then segments: (1,4) becomes new segment 1, (1,3) to segment 2, (2,3) to seg3, etc., and tail (5,5) is removed.\n\nBut no collision since (1,5) is not occupied by body.\n\nBody segments are at (1,3), (2,3), etc., all different from (1,5).\n\nSo moving Up to (1,5) is possible.\n\nBut that's the only move? What about other directions? No, left and right are blocked by walls.\n\nDown is not allowed because reverse direction.\n\nCurrent direction U, so moving D would be reverse, not permitted.\n\nSo for turn 35, only possible action is U, to (1,5).\n\nBut let me confirm the grid.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,5) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is current head, (1,3) below, (1,5) above should be free.\n\nBut (1,5) might be near border? y=5, max y=6, since y=7 is wall? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is the top row.\n\ny from 0 to 7, walls at y=0 and y=7, so playable y=1 to 6.\n\n(1,5): y=5, which is not 6, so not border. y=6 would be adjacent to wall.\n\n(1,5) is fine.\n\nSo for turn 35, I must move Up to (1,5).\n\nBut the question is to think multiple turns ahead, so I need to plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, food: (3,1) has life span 1, so if not eaten on turn 35, it disappears.\n\nBut I'm at (1,4), and (3,1) is at x=3,y=1, which is far away. To reach (3,1) from (1,4), I need to go down and right, but I can only move one step at a time.\n\nFrom (1,4) to (3,1): minimum Manhattan distance is |3-1| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5 moves, but I can't reach it in one turn, and since it has life span 1, it will disappear after this turn, so I can't eat it. It's impossible to eat (3,1) on turn 35, so it will be gone.\n\nLife span 1 on turn 35 means: it decreases every turn including current, so on turn 35, if not eaten, it disappears after turn 35, so for turn 36, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (2,2) with life span 6, so it will last until turn 35+6=41? Life span decreases each turn, so on turn 35, life span is 6, meaning it has 6 turns left including this one? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for a food with life span L on turn t, it will disappear after turn t+L-1? Example: if life span 1 on turn t, it disappears after turn t, meaning not available on turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, life span 2: on turn t, life span 2; turn t+1, life span 1; after turn t+1, disappears, so not on turn t+2.\n\nGeneral: a food with life span N on turn t will be available from turn t to turn t+N-1, and disappear after turn t+N-1, so not on turn t+N.\n\nIn this case, turn 35:\n\n- (3,1): life span 1, so available only on turn 35, disappears after.\n\n- (2,2): life span 6, so available from turn 35 to 35+5=40? Turn t to t + (N-1), so from 35 to 35+5=40, and disappears after turn 40.\n\n- (2,3): life span 9, available from 35 to 35+8=43, disappears after 43.\n\nBut (2,3) is under snake body, so not accessible now.\n\nNow for turn 35, I can only move Up to (1,5), as established.\n\nAfter moving to (1,5), new head position (1,5), direction U (since I moved up).\n\nSnake positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — tail was (5,5), but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so segments: from head to tail: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)? Let's list:\n\nOriginal: positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] 8 segments.\n\nAfter move U to (1,5): head to (1,5), then body: the first body segment moves to where head was, so (1,4) becomes segment 1, (1,3) becomes segment 2, (2,3) becomes segment 3, (3,3) seg4, (4,3) seg5, (4,4) seg6, (4,5) seg7, and tail (5,5) is removed since no food. So snake now: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] 8 segments still? No, removed tail, so 7 segments? Original 8 positions, head moves to new cell, each segment shifts, last segment (tail) is removed, so new snake has same length, positions: head (1,5), then previous positions except tail removed: so (1,4) is now first body, (1,3) second, (2,3) third, (3,3) fourth, (4,3) fifth, (4,4) sixth, (4,5) seventh — that's 7 segments? Let's count indices.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: head (1,4), 1: (1,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (3,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5) tail.\n\nAfter move U: new head at (1,5), then body: segment at index 0 moves to where? In snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, the body segments follow: segment 1 moves to where head was (1,4), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was (1,3), segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was (2,3), and so on, up to segment 7 moves to where segment 6 was (4,5), and the old tail (segment 7) position is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head: (1,5)\n\nBody 1: (1,4)  // previous head\n\nBody 2: (1,3)  // previous body 1\n\nBody 3: (2,3)  // previous body 2\n\nBody 4: (3,3)  // previous body 3\n\nBody 5: (4,3)  // previous body 4\n\nBody 6: (4,4)  // previous body 5\n\nBody 7: (4,5)  // previous body 6, and previous body 7 (5,5) is gone.\n\nSo new snake: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] — that's 8 positions? No: positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). That's 8 cells, but we removed the tail? I think I miscounted.\n\nOriginal snake has 8 segments: indices 0 to 7.\n\nAfter move: new head at new position, then the body consists of the previous head and the first N-1 body segments, but since no growth, the last segment is not included.\n\nStandard snake: when no food, head moves to new cell, and tail cell is left, so the new snake has the new head and all but the last segment of the old body.\n\nOld positions: S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., S7 (tail)\n\nAfter moving head to new position New, the new snake is: New (new head), S0 (now body), S1, S2, ..., S6 (new tail).\n\nS6 was the second last segment.\n\nIn this case, S0: (1,4), S1: (1,3), S2: (2,3), S3: (3,3), S4: (4,3), S5: (4,4), S6: (4,5), S7: (5,5)\n\nAfter move to (1,5): new head: (1,5)\n\nNew body: S0 is now body at (1,4)\n\nS1 at (1,3)\n\nS2 at (2,3)\n\nS3 at (3,3)\n\nS4 at (4,3)\n\nS5 at (4,4)\n\nS6 at (4,5)  // S6 was (4,5), and S7 is removed.\n\nNew tail is S6 at (4,5)\n\nSo positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] 8 segments? (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — that's 8 cells, but it should be 7 because tail was removed.\n\n(4,5) is now the tail, and it was previously S6, which was occupied, but in the new list, the positions are all distinct except the head is new.\n\nLength should be the same since no food eaten. Original length 8, after move, new length 8? No: when snake moves without eating, the length remains the same, but the tail moves forward, so the last position is removed.\n\nIn terms of count: from 8 positions, head moves to new position, so there are 9 positions temporarily, but then the tail position is removed, so back to 8 positions. Yes, length unchanged.\n\nFor example, from (1,4) to (1,5), old tail (5,5) removed, so cells occupied: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — 8 cells, yes.\n\n(4,5) was previously occupied by S6, now it's the new tail, and (5,5) is free.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nAfter turn 35, snake at [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)], head at (1,5), direction U (since moved up).\n\nNow turn 36.\n\nPossible moves: from (1,5), direction U.\n\nCan move U, L, R. D is reverse, not allowed.\n\nU: to (1,6)\n\nL: to (0,5) x=0 wall, invalid\n\nR: to (2,5)\n\n(2,5): is it free? Not wall, not snake body? Snake body at (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), etc., (2,5) not occupied. Internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed. So (2,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6): y=6, which is top row, since y=7 wall, so (1,6) is playable, no wall.\n\nSo moves: U to (1,6), R to (2,5)\n\nNow, is there food? (3,1) is gone, since life span 1 on turn 35 not eaten.\n\n(2,2) is still there, life span now 5 (since decreased by 1), so available until turn 40.\n\n(2,3) is under snake, but at (2,3), which is occupied by body. In new positions, (2,3) is the fourth segment? Positions: head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), ... so (2,3) is occupied by a body segment.\n\nFood at (2,3) can be eaten only if body moves away.\n\nNow for turn 36, from (1,5), I can go U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), that's the top row, y=6.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: direction U, but U from (1,6) would be to (1,7) which is wall, invalid. Or L to (0,6) wall, R to (2,6), or D down.\n\nBut current direction after move would be U.\n\nIf I go R to (2,5) on turn 36, then head at (2,5), direction R.\n\nThen I can go U, R, D, but not L (reverse).\n\nNow, I need to think about eating food.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is below and left from (1,5)? From (1,5) to (2,2): x+1, y-3, so not adjacent.\n\nAlso, (2,3) food is at (2,3), which is currently occupied by body, so I need to move the snake so that the body leaves (2,3).\n\nCurrently at turn 36, (2,3) is occupied by the fourth segment.\n\nIf I move in a way that the snake moves away from (2,3), it might free up the cell.\n\nFor example, if I go right to (2,5) on turn 36, then new head (2,5), body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4) — tail (4,5) removed? Let's simulate.\n\nTurn 36 start: snake at [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nIf I move R to (2,5): new head (2,5), then body: (1,5) becomes body1, (1,4) body2, (1,3) body3, (2,3) body4, (3,3) body5, (4,3) body6, (4,4) body7 (new tail), and (4,5) removed.\n\nSo positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\n(2,3) is still occupied, by body4.\n\nIf I move U to (1,6) on turn 36: new head (1,6), body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4) — tail (4,5) removed, so (2,3) still occupied.\n\nTo free (2,3), I need the snake to move so that the segment at (2,3) moves away.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (2,3) will move to where the previous segment was when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if the head moves, the body segments shift, so the segment that was at (2,3) will move to the position of the next segment towards the head.\n\nIn the list, the body segments move to the position of the previous segment closer to head.\n\nFrom above, after turn 35, position of (2,3) is body3 or something.\n\nLet's label the segments.\n\nAt turn 35 after move: segments: 0: head (1,5), 1: (1,4), 2: (1,3), 3: (2,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,5) tail.\n\n(2,3) is segment 3.\n\nWhen snake moves, segment 3 will move to where segment 2 was, but segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, etc.\n\nOn turn 36, if I move head to new position, say to (1,6) U.\n\nNew head: (1,6)\n\nThen new segment 1: old head (1,5)\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1 (1,4)\n\nNew segment 3: old segment 2 (1,3)\n\nNew segment 4: old segment 3 (2,3)\n\nNew segment 5: old segment 4 (3,3)\n\nNew segment 6: old segment 5 (4,3)\n\nNew segment 7: old segment 6 (4,4)  // new tail, old segment 7 (4,5) removed.\n\nSo (2,3) is now occupied by new segment 4, but it's still occupied.\n\nThe cell (2,3) is now occupied by the new body, but the food is there, so it's still under snake.\n\nTo eat it, I need the snake to move so that no segment is at (2,3), and then head moves to it.\n\nSo I need to have a turn where (2,3) is free.\n\nCurrently, segment at (2,3) will move when the snake moves, but it moves to a different cell only if the head moves in a way that the body shifts.\n\nFor example, if the head moves, the segment that was at (2,3) will move to where the previous segment was, which is (1,3) in this case, but (1,3) is occupied by another segment, so it's messy.\n\nThe cell (2,3) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves away, which happens when the head moves and the body follows.\n\nBut in the shift, the segment at (2,3) moves to the position of the segment closer to the head.\n\nIn this case, segment at (2,3) is segment 3, and it will move to where segment 2 is now, which is (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is currently occupied by segment 2, so when segment 2 moves to where segment 1 is, etc., the cell (1,3) will be vacated by segment 2, and then segment 3 moves to (1,3), so (2,3) is left empty.\n\nSimilarly, in general, when the snake moves, the tail cell is always vacated, but other cells might be vacated if the snake turns.\n\nIn this case, since the snake is relatively straight, moving head will cause the cell behind to be vacated step by step.\n\nSpecifically, for (2,3), it is currently occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment will move to a new position, so (2,3) will be empty if no other segment moves to it, but since the snake is connected, when one segment moves, the next may not move to the same cell.\n\nIn this position, the snake is at (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), so from (1,3) to (2,3) is a turn.\n\nIf I move head to (1,6) U, then as above, new positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), etc. so (2,3) is still occupied.\n\nIf I move head to (2,5) R, then new positions: head (2,5), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), etc. again (2,3) occupied.\n\nTo free (2,3), I need the segment that is there to move away, which means the head needs to move in a way that the body segment at (2,3) is forced to move to a different direction.\n\nFor example, if I move the head down or something, but currently at (1,5), I can only go U or R.\n\nIf I go R to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can go D to (2,4), but (2,4) is an internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nOr U to (2,6), or R to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is available, life span 5 left.\n\nFrom current position (1,5), to reach (2,2), I need to go down and right.\n\nBut directly, from (1,5) to (2,2) is not adjacent.\n\nI could plan a path.\n\nAlso, there is a risk of tail collision if I eat food when head is adjacent to tail.\n\nFirst, for turn 36, I have two choices: U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), then I'm at top row, and from there, I can only go R or D, since L and U are walls.\n\nIf I go R to (2,5), then I'm at (2,5), which is closer to the center.\n\nMoreover, from (2,5), I can then go down to (2,4) but (2,4) is wall, so not possible, or U to (2,6), or R to (3,5), or D but D is down to (2,4) wall, so only U or R.\n\nDirection: after moving R to (2,5), head direction is R, so I can move U, R, D, but not L.\n\nD to (2,4) wall, invalid, so only U to (2,6) or R to (3,5).\n\n(2,6) is top row, y=6.\n\n(3,5) is free.\n\nNow, to eat (2,2), I need to go down, but from (2,5), I can't go down directly because of wall at (2,4).\n\nSo it might be hard to reach (2,2) soon.\n\nPerhaps I should go R to (2,5) on turn 36 to move towards the right where there is more space.\n\nLet's list the free cells and plan.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: internal (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSo for example, row y=1: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 but (5,1) and (6,1) are walls, so free: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) but (3,1) had food but expired, so now free? (3,1) is free cell now.\n\ny=2: (1,2) wall, (2,2) food, (3,2) free? (4,2) free, (5,2) free, (6,2) free? (6,1) wall, but (6,2) not listed, so free.\n\nInternal obstacles are specific points.\n\ny=3: all free except snake? (1,3) snake, (2,3) snake and food, (3,3) snake, (4,3) snake, (5,3) free, (6,3) free.\n\ny=4: (1,4) snake, (2,4) wall, (3,4) free? (4,4) snake, (5,4) free, (6,4) wall.\n\ny=5: (1,5) snake, (2,5) free? In turn 36, (2,5) is free, (3,5) free, (4,5) snake? After turn 35, (4,5) is tail, but in turn 36, it might be removed.\n\nAt turn 36 start, (2,5) is free.\n\n(3,5) free, (4,5) snake, (5,5) free? (5,5) was tail at turn 35, but after move to (1,5), (5,5) is free.\n\n(6,5) free.\n\ny=6: (1,6) free, (2,6) free, (3,6) free, etc.\n\nBack to turn 36 decision.\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), then I'm at top-left corner, and I can only go R to (2,6) or D to (1,5), but (1,5) is body, so when I move, it will be vacated, but at the time of move, it's occupied.\n\nFrom (1,6), moves: U invalid, L invalid, R to (2,6), D to (1,5).\n\nD to (1,5): but (1,5) is currently occupied by body segment 1, so moving there would be body collision.\n\nIn general, moving to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail is collision, but tail is ok if it moves away.\n\nIn this case, when moving to (1,5), at the time of move, it is occupied by the body, so it would be collision.\n\nOnly if moving to the tail cell, and the tail moves, it might be safe, but here (1,5) is not tail, it's the first body segment.\n\nTail is at (4,5), which is different.\n\nSo moving to (1,5) from (1,6) would be moving down to a body cell, collision.\n\nSimilarly, only R to (2,6) is possible from (1,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go U invalid, D to (2,5), L to (1,6) but (1,6) is previous head, will be body, but at move time, it might be occupied.\n\nFrom (2,6), direction after moving R or U, but let's not get ahead.\n\nIf I go R to (2,5) on turn 36, from (1,5), then to (2,5), which is free.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6) or R to (3,5), since D to (2,4) wall.\n\n(2,6) or (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is closer to the food at (2,2)? Not really.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), so from (2,5) to (2,2), I need to go down, but blocked by wall at (2,4).\n\nSo I have to go around.\n\nFor example, go to (3,5), then down to (3,4), then left to (2,4) but wall, or down to (3,3) but (3,3) is snake, etc.\n\nLet's list snake positions after turn 35: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nSo occupied cells: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nFree cells include (2,2), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (5,4), (5,5), etc.\n\nTo eat (2,2), I need to move the head to (2,2).\n\nFrom current head (1,5), I can go to (2,5) on turn 36.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go to (3,5) on turn 37.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go D to (3,4) on turn 38, since direction R, can go U, R, D.\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go L to (2,4) but (2,4) wall, invalid, or D to (3,3) but (3,3) is snake body, occupied, or R to (4,4) but (4,4) is snake body, occupied, or U back to (3,5), but that might not help.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: direction after moving D to (3,4), so head direction D.\n\nThen can move U, L, R, but not D (reverse).\n\nU to (3,5) previous position, occupied, collision.\n\nL to (2,4) wall.\n\nR to (4,4) but (4,4) is occupied by snake body.\n\nSo no valid moves from (3,4)? That can't be right.\n\nAt turn 38, if head is at (3,4), the snake body might have moved.\n\nLet's simulate the moves.\n\nTurn 36: move R to (2,5) from (1,5)\n\nNew snake: head (2,5), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // (4,5) removed, tail at (4,4)\n\nPositions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 37: from (2,5), move R to (3,5)  // assume I go right\n\nNew head (3,5), body (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)  // (4,4) removed, tail at (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is tail.\n\nNow (2,3) is still occupied, by body5.\n\nTurn 38: from (3,5), move D to (3,4)  // down\n\nDirection was R, so D is not reverse, allowed.\n\nNew head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)  // (4,3) removed, tail at (3,3)\n\nNow (3,4) is free? At this point, cells: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n\nSo (3,4) was free, now head is there.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: head at (3,4), direction D.\n\nCan move U (up) to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by body segment, collision.\n\nL (left) to (2,4), but (2,4) is wall, invalid.\n\nR (right) to (4,4), but (4,4) is not occupied now? In this state, (4,4) was removed earlier, so free? Let's see occupied cells: (3,4) head, (3,5) body, (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n\nSo (4,4) is free, and (4,3) free, etc.\n\nR to (4,4) is possible.\n\nD to (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied by tail, body segment.\n\n(3,3) is occupied, so moving D to (3,3) would be collision.\n\nSo from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) occupied, invalid; L to (2,4) wall, invalid; D to (3,3) occupied, invalid; R to (4,4) free, valid.\n\nSo only R to (4,4).\n\nThen move to (4,4), but (4,4) might be free, but in the body list, (4,4) is not occupied, so ok.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut this is not helping to reach (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,5), instead of going R to (3,5), I could go U to (2,6) on turn 37.\n\nTurn 36: at (2,5)\n\nTurn 37: move U to (2,6)\n\nNew head (2,6), body (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)  // tail at (4,3)\n\nThen from (2,6), can move D to (2,5) but occupied, or L to (1,6) or R to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut still not closer to (2,2).\n\nTo reach (2,2), I need to go left and down from current position.\n\nFrom (1,5), on turn 36, if I go U to (1,6), then to (2,6), then to (3,6), then down, but (2,2) is at bottom.\n\nFrom (1,5), I can only go U or R, both away from (2,2).\n\nPerhaps I should have moved differently earlier, but on turn 35, I had no choice, only U.\n\nNow, the food at (2,3) might be easier to eat once it's free.\n\nHow to free (2,3).\n\nCurrently at turn 35 after move, (2,3) is occupied by segment 3.\n\nWhen the head moves, the body shifts.\n\nFor example, if I move the head in a way that the segment at (2,3) moves left or down.\n\nBut from the current position, the snake is going up or right.\n\nSuppose on turn 36, I move U to (1,6).\n\nThen new positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // (4,5) removed\n\n(2,3) still occupied.\n\nThen on turn 37, from (1,6), I can only move R to (2,6) (since U and L invalid, D to (1,5) occupied).\n\nMove R to (2,6).\n\nNew head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)  // (4,4) removed\n\n(2,3) still occupied.\n\nThen on turn 38, from (2,6), can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6), etc.\n\nSay move D to (2,5).\n\nNew head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)  // (4,3) removed\n\n(2,3) still occupied.\n\nThe segment at (2,3) is not moving because the snake is moving in a way that it stays.\n\nTo free (2,3), I need the head to move down or left, but I can't from here.\n\nFrom the beginning, at turn 35, after moving to (1,5), on turn 36, if I move R to (2,5), then as before.\n\nBut let's see when (2,3) will be vacated.\n\nThe cell (2,3) is occupied by a body segment. It will be vacated when that segment moves to a different cell, which happens when the head moves and the body follows.\n\nThe position of the segment at (2,3) will change only if the snake turns.\n\nCurrently, the snake has a bend at (1,3) to (2,3).\n\nIf I move the head, the bend might shift.\n\nFor example, if on turn 36 I move R to (2,5), then the new positions have (2,3) still occupied, but the segment that was there is now at a different position in the body.\n\nIn the new list, (2,3) is occupied by the body segment that was previously at (2,3), but it's the same cell.\n\nThe cell (2,3) is occupied until the segment that is there moves away.\n\nThat segment will move when the head moves in a way that the body shifts.\n\nSpecifically, the segment at (2,3) will move to where the segment ahead of it was.\n\nFor example, in the body, the segment at (2,3) follows the segment at (1,3), which follows (1,4), etc.\n\nIf the head moves, and the first body segment moves to head position, the second to first position, etc., so the segment at (2,3) will move to the position of the segment it was following, which is (1,3).\n\nSo when the head moves, the segment at (2,3) moves to (1,3), so (2,3) is vacated, and (1,3) is now occupied by that segment.\n\nBut (1,3) was occupied, so it's vacated when the segment there moves.\n\nIn general, when the snake moves, the cell that was occupied by the last body segment before the turn or something.\n\nIn this case, when the head moves from (1,5) to (2,5) on turn 36, the segment that was at (1,3) moves to where? Let's trace:\n\nHead moves to (2,5)\n\nBody segment 1 (at (1,5)) moves to new body position, which is where head was, (1,5)? No:\n\nNew body1: old head position (1,5)\n\nNew body2: old body1 position (1,4)\n\nNew body3: old body2 position (1,3)\n\nNew body4: old body3 position (2,3)\n\nNew body5: old body4 position (3,3)\n\netc.\n\nSo the segment that was at (2,3) (old body3) is now at new body4 position, which is (2,3) again? Old body3 was at (2,3), and new body4 is at old body3 position (2,3), so it stays at (2,3).\n\nThe cell (2,3) is still occupied by the new body.\n\nThe segment that was at (2,3) is still at (2,3) because it moved to the position it was already at? No, in the shift, the segment moves to the position of the previous segment closer to head.\n\nOld body3 at (2,3) moves to the position of old body2, which was (1,3).\n\nOld body2 was at (1,3), so new body3 is at (1,3).\n\nNew body3 is at old body2 position (1,3)\n\nNew body4 is at old body3 position (2,3)\n\nSo the cell (2,3) is now occupied by new body4, which is the segment that was previously at (2,3), so same segment, same cell.\n\nThe cell is not vacated.\n\nTo vacate (2,3), I need the head to move in a direction that causes the body to straighten or turn, so that the segment moves to a different cell.\n\nFor example, if I move the head down from (1,5), but I can't because of direction and walls.\n\nPerhaps it's stuck for now.\n\nLet's look at the food at (2,3). It has life span 9 on turn 35, so after decrease, on turn 36, life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nI should focus on the available food (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), and it's free.\n\nFrom current position (1,5), I can go to (2,5) on turn 36.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go to (3,5) on turn 37.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (3,4) on turn 38.\n\nFrom (3,4), as before, only move to (4,4) on turn 39.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go U to (4,5) or R to (5,4) or D to (4,3) but (4,3) is snake or not.\n\nLet's simulate from turn 36.\n\nTurn 36: move R to (2,5) from (1,5)\n\nSnake: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 37: move R to (3,5)\n\nNew head (3,5), body (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)  // (4,4) removed, tail at (4,3)\n\nTurn 38: move D to (3,4)\n\nNew head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)  // (4,3) removed, tail at (3,3)\n\nTurn 39: from (3,4), only possible move R to (4,4) as before.\n\nMove to (4,4)\n\nNew head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)  // (3,3) removed, tail at (2,3)\n\nNow (2,3) is tail.\n\nFood at (2,3) can be eaten if head moves to it, but it's tail, so there is a danger.\n\nTail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nHere, at turn 39, head at (4,4), tail at (2,3), not adjacent.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: direction after moving R to (4,4), so head direction R.\n\nCan move U to (4,5), R to (5,4), D to (4,3), or L to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, occupied.\n\nU to (4,5): is it free? In this state, (4,5) is free, not occupied.\n\nR to (5,4): free?\n\nD to (4,3): but (4,3) is not occupied now? Occupied cells: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)\n\nSo (4,3) free, (4,5) free, (5,4) free, etc.\n\nD to (4,3) is possible.\n\nBut let's go back to (2,2).\n\nTo reach (2,2), from (1,5), I need to go down.\n\nBut from (1,5), I can only go U or R on turn 36.\n\nIf I go U to (1,6) on turn 36, then to (2,6) on turn 37, then to (2,5) on turn 38 if possible.\n\nTurn 36: move U to (1,6)\n\nSnake: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 37: move R to (2,6)  // only choice\n\nNew head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)  // (4,4) removed\n\nTurn 38: from (2,6), move D to (2,5)  // assume\n\nNew head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)  // (4,3) removed\n\nNow at (2,5), I can go R to (3,5) or U to (2,6) but occupied, or D to (2,4) wall, so only R to (3,5).\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom (2,5), on turn 38, I can go to (3,5), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut to reach (2,2), I need to go to (2,1) or something, but (2,4) is wall, so I have to go around the wall.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), go to (3,5), then to (3,4), then to (3,3) but (3,3) is snake, or to (4,4), but not towards (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (3,3) but occupied, or to (4,4), etc.\n\nPerhaps from (1,5), on turn 36, I should go R to (2,5), then on turn 37, go U to (2,6), but that doesn't help.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (2,3) can be eaten once the tail is there or something.\n\nAt turn 35 after move, tail is at (4,5).\n\nAs the snake moves, the tail moves.\n\nFor example, in the first scenario, after turn 39, tail is at (2,3), and (2,3) has food.\n\nIf head moves to (2,3), it can eat the food, but head at (4,4), tail at (2,3), distance 2, not adjacent.\n\nIf head moves to (2,3), it would be from adjacent cell, but (2,3) is tail, so when head moves to tail cell, the tail doesn't move that turn, and the snake grows, so new tail is at the old tail position, but since head is there, it collides.\n\nTail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut if head is not adjacent, it might be ok.\n\nIn this case, from (4,4) to (2,3) is not adjacent, so moving to (2,3) would eat the food, and snake grows, so new head at (2,3), new body includes the old tail position, but the tail was at (2,3), so new segment there, but head is also there, so collision.\n\nGeneral rule: when you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one cell at the head position, but the head moves to the food cell, which is the same as the tail cell in this case, so head and tail at same cell, collision.\n\nSo to eat food on the tail cell, it must be that the head moves to the tail cell, which is only possible if the head is adjacent to the tail, and then it collides because after eating, the new tail is at the same position as head.\n\nSo it's always deadly to eat food on the tail cell.\n\nOther body cells, if food is there, it can be eaten only after the body moves away.\n\nFor (2,3), since it's not tail, I need to have the body move away, then head move to it.\n\nIn the current state, (2,3) is a body segment, not tail.\n\nTo free it, I need the snake to move so that the segment leaves (2,3).\n\nFor example, if I move the head in a way that the body turns.\n\nSuppose on turn 36, from (1,5), I move U to (1,6).\n\nThen on turn 37, move R to (2,6).\n\nThen on turn 38, move D to (2,5).\n\nThen on turn 39, from (2,5), move R to (3,5).\n\nThen on turn 40, from (3,5), move D to (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 41, from (3,4), move R to (4,4).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nEventually, the segment at (2,3) will move when the body shifts.\n\nFor example, after several moves, the body will shift, and the cell (2,3) will be vacated.\n\nSpecifically, after the head has moved enough, the segment that was at (2,3) will move to (1,3) or something.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 38, snake at [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)] after turn 38 move D to (2,5), body includes (1,3) and (2,3).\n\nOn turn 39 move R to (3,5), new head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)  // (3,3) removed\n\n(2,3) still occupied.\n\nOn turn 40 move D to (3,4), new head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  // (2,3) removed? New body: new body1 (3,5), body2 (2,5), body3 (2,6), body4 (1,6), body5 (1,5), body6 (1,4), body7 (1,3) tail.\n\nSo (2,3) is no longer occupied; it was removed when the tail moved.\n\nIn this case, on turn 40 after move, (2,3) is free, and food is there with life span decreasing.\n\nLife span of (2,3) was 9 on turn 35, so on turn 36: 8, turn 37:7, turn 38:6, turn 39:5, turn 40:4, etc.\n\nOn turn 40, (2,3) is free.\n\nHead is at (3,4), which is adjacent to (2,3)? (3,4) and (2,3) are not adjacent; adjacent means same x or y, difference 1.\n\n(3,4) to (2,3): Δx=1, Δy=1, not adjacent; diagonal, not adjacent for movement.\n\nAdjacent cells are up, down, left, right.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can move to (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4).\n\n(2,3) is not directly accessible from (3,4).\n\nTo reach (2,3) from (3,4), I need to go to (2,4) but (2,4) is wall, or to (3,3), then to (2,3) if possible.\n\nBut on turn 40, head at (3,4), I can move to (3,3) on turn 41, but (3,3) may be occupied or not.\n\nIn the state at turn 40 after move to (3,4), positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nSo (3,3) is free.\n\nOn turn 41, from (3,4), move D to (3,3) (down).\n\nNew head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // (1,3) removed, tail at (1,4)\n\nNow (2,3) is free, and from (3,3), I can move L to (2,3) on turn 42.\n\nMove to (2,3), which has food, so eat it, snake grows, new length 9, tail does not move.\n\nBut head moves to (2,3), which was free, and food is there.\n\nIs there danger? Head at (3,3), tail at (1,4), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n\nMove L to (2,3).\n\nThen new head at (2,3), and since food eaten, the tail stays, so new body includes the old tail position.\n\nOld positions: before move, head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail.\n\nAfter move to (2,3): new head at (2,3), then body: old head position (3,3) becomes new body1, then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) and tail stays, so new positions: [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]\n\nLength increased.\n\nAnd no collision.\n\nSo this is a way to eat the food at (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, for the other food (2,2), it might be possible later.\n\nBut (2,2) has shorter life span, life span 6 on turn 35, so on turn 36:5, turn 37:4, turn 38:3, turn 39:2, turn 40:1, turn 41:0, so disappears after turn 41, not available on turn 42.\n\nIn the above sequence, on turn 42, I eat (2,3), but (2,2) expired.\n\nSo I might miss (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is harder to reach.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (2,2) first.\n\nFrom turn 35, on turn 36, I move U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf I move R to (2,5), then on turn 37, I can move D, but D to (2,4) wall, not possible, so U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (2,6), then on turn 38, move D to (2,5), then on turn 39, move R to (3,5), etc., same as before.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can only go to (2,6) or (3,5), both not towards (2,2).\n\nSo it seems difficult to reach (2,2) before it expires.\n\nLife span 6 on turn 35, available until turn 40 (since turn 35 to 40, 6 turns).\n\nTurn 35: life span 1 for (3,1), gone after.\n\n(2,2): life span 6, available on turns 35,36,37,38,39,40.\n\nDisappears after turn 40.\n\nTo eat on turn 40, I need to be at (2,2) on turn 40.\n\nFrom current position (1,5) on turn 35.\n\nAfter turn 35, on turn 36, I am at (1,5) if I moved U, but I have to move.\n\nTurn 35: move U to (1,5) — at turn 35, I moved to (1,5), so on turn 36, I am at (1,5).\n\nFrom (1,5) on turn 36, I can move to (1,6) or (2,5).\n\nThe shortest path to (2,2) is 4 moves: e.g., (1,5) to (1,4) but occupied, or to (2,5) then to (2,4) wall, or to (1,6) away.\n\nMinimum Manhattan distance |2-1| + |2-5| = 1+3=4, but with walls, it might be more.\n\nFor example, from (1,5) to (2,2): need to go down to y=2, but directly down is blocked at (1,4) and (1,3) snake, and (2,4) wall.\n\nSo I have to go around, e.g., to (2,5), then (3,5), then (3,4), then (3,3), but (3,3) snake, then to (3,2) or (4,3), etc., to (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,4) to (2,2) not directly.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (3,3) occupied, to (3,2) if free, then to (2,2).\n\nBut (3,2) may be free.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nFrom (1,5) on turn 36, to (2,5) turn 36, then to (3,5) turn 37, then to (3,4) turn 38, then to (3,3) but on turn 38, (3,3) may be occupied or not.\n\nIn earlier simulation, on turn 38, if I moved to (3,4), (3,3) was occupied.\n\nBut if I move faster, or different path.\n\nAssume I go directly as possible.\n\nTurn 36: from (1,5) move R to (2,5)\n\nTurn 37: from (2,5) move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 38: from (3,5) move D to (3,4)\n\nNow at (3,4), on turn 38.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move R to (4,4) or, if I can move D to (3,3) but occupied, not possible.\n\nOnly R to (4,4).\n\nTurn 39: move to (4,4)\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or U to (4,5) or R to (5,4)\n\nBut not towards (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,4), on turn 38, I have to move to (4,4), not to (3,3).\n\nSo I can't reach (2,2) in time.\n\nIf from turn 36 I move U to (1,6), then to (2,6) turn 37, to (2,5) turn 38, to (3,5) turn 39, to (3,4) turn 40, but on turn 40, (2,2) disappears, so I can't eat it on turn 40.\n\nTurn 40 is the last turn it's available.\n\nAt turn 40, if I am at (3,4), not at (2,2).\n\nSo it's impossible to eat (2,2) within the time, given the constraints.\n\nTherefore, I should ignore (2,2) and focus on eating (2,3) later, as in the earlier plan.\n\nAlso, maximize score, but since both foods are +1, eating one is fine.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nTurn 35: only possible move is U to (1,5)\n\nThen for turn 36: I can choose U or R.\n\nIf I go R to (2,5), it might be better for accessing the right side.\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), I am cornered.\n\nSo better to go R to (2,5) on turn 36.\n\nThen turn 37: from (2,5), move R to (3,5) to go towards the food area.\n\nThen turn 38: from (3,5), move D to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 39: from (3,4), move R to (4,4)  // only choice\n\nThen turn 40: from (4,4), I can move to various places.\n\nBut to eat (2,3), as before, on turn 40, (2,3) is free, head at (3,4), then on turn 41, move D to (3,3), then turn 42 move L to (2,3) to eat.\n\nIn turn 40, where is head?\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 35: move U to (1,5)  // done\n\nTurn 36: move R to (2,5)\n\nSnake: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 37: move R to (3,5)\n\nSnake: [(3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]  // (4,4) removed\n\nTurn 38: move D to (3,4)\n\nSnake: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]  // (4,3) removed\n\nTurn 39: from (3,4), move R to (4,4)  // only choice\n\nNew head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)  // (3,3) removed, tail at (2,3)\n\n(2,3) is tail with food.\n\nOn turn 40: head at (4,4), tail at (2,3), not adjacent.\n\nPossible moves: from (4,4), direction R (since moved right).\n\nCan move U to (4,5), R to (5,4), D to (4,3), L to (3,4) but occupied.\n\nU to (4,5): free? Yes.\n\nR to (5,4): free.\n\nD to (4,3): free.\n\nL to (3,4): occupied, invalid.\n\nSo I can move U, R, or D.\n\nBut I want to eat (2,3), so I need to move towards it.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (2,3), I can go via (3,3) or (4,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) is free now, since removed.\n\nOn turn 39, after move, (3,3) is free.\n\nSo from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) on turn 40.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move L to (3,3) on turn 41.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move L to (2,3) on turn 42 to eat.\n\nLife span of (2,3): on turn 35:9, turn36:8, turn37:7, turn38:6, turn39:5, turn40:4, turn41:3, turn42:2, so available.\n\nOn turn 42, eat.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 40: move D to (4,3)\n\nNew head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  // (2,3) removed? When moving, old tail at (2,3) is removed if no food, but food is there, but I'm not eating now.\n\nOn turn 40, head moves to (4,3), no food there, so tail is removed.\n\nNew snake: head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  // old tail (2,3) removed, so (2,3) is free with food.\n\nTurn 41: from (4,3), move L to (3,3)\n\nNew head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)  // (1,3) removed, tail at (1,4)\n\nTurn 42: from (3,3), move L to (2,3)\n\n(2,3) has food, so eat it. Head moves to (2,3), snake grows, tail does not move, so new positions: head (2,3), then body: old head position (3,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) and since food eaten, the tail stays, so new segment at (2,3), but head is there? No: head moves to (2,3), which is the food cell, so new head at (2,3), and the body includes all old positions, with the tail not moving, so the old tail is still there, and a new segment is added at the head.\n\nOld positions before move: head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) tail.\n\nAfter move to (2,3): new head at (2,3), then body: old head position (3,3) becomes new body1, then (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) and since food eaten, the tail (1,4) does not move, so it remains, and new body segment is added, so positions: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)]\n\nLength 9.\n\nAnd (2,3) is occupied by head, no issue.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nStarting from turn 35.\n\nTurn 35: must be U\n\nThen for turn 36, I choose R to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 37: R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 38: D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 39: R to (4,4)\n\nThen for turn 40, I have choices, but to eat food, I go D to (4,3)\n\nBut in the sequence above, I need to go to (4,3) on turn 40.\n\nThen turn 41: L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 42: L to (2,3) to eat.\n\nBut the answer format should be for 5+ turns, I think.\n\nSince turn 35, and think ahead, I can output up to turn 40 or so.\n\nAlso, for turn 36, I could go U instead, but R seems better to avoid corner.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nNow for the actions:\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: R\n\nTurn 37: R\n\nTurn 38: D\n\nTurn 39: R\n\nThat's 5 turns: 35 to 39.\n\nI can add more.\n\nBut turn 40: D to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut perhaps for the box, list from turn 35 to, say, turn 39 or 40.\n\nSince the food is eaten later, but I think the initial moves are set.\n\nSo for answer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 35: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: \\text{R} }\n\nBut on turn 39, moving R to (4,4), which is fine.\n\nI could include turn 40: D, but not necessary, as per the plan.\n\nTo show the eating, but I think this is sufficient for the immediate actions.\n\nAlso, prioritize long-term survival, which is ok.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 38, when I move D to (3,4), from (3,5), direction was R, so D is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, all moves are valid.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nBased on the current state and the need to maximize score while prioritizing long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Current constraints**: The snake head is at (1,4) with direction \"U\". On turn 35, the only safe and valid move is \"U\" to (1,5), as moving left (to x=0, wall) or right (to (2,4), internal obstacle) is invalid, and moving down is reverse (not allowed).\n- **Food analysis**: \n  - (3,1) has a life span of 1 and expires after turn 35; it is unreachable and ignored.\n  - (2,2) has a life span of 6 (available until turn 40) but is difficult to reach safely due to walls and snake body positions; it will expire uneaten.\n  - (2,3) has a life span of 9 (available until turn 43) and is under the snake body. It can be eaten once the body moves away, which occurs around turn 42 in the planned path.\n- **Path planning**: The sequence moves right to avoid the top-left corner, frees the (2,3) food cell by shifting the body, and positions the head to eat (2,3) on turn 42. This avoids risks like walls, body collisions, and tail reward danger.\n- **Survival focus**: The path stays clear of walls and internal obstacles, with no dead ends. Eating (2,3) on turn 42 increases length to 9 without risk, as the head is not adjacent to the tail when eating.\n\n### Planned Moves (Turns 35 to 42):\n- **Turn 35**: Move \"U\" to (1,5) – Only valid move; positions snake away from left wall.\n- **Turn 36**: Move \"R\" to (2,5) – Moves right to avoid corner and start freeing (2,3) food cell.\n- **Turn 37**: Move \"R\" to (3,5) – Continues rightward; (2,3) remains occupied but will free soon.\n- **Turn 38**: Move \"D\" to (3,4) – Down move valid (not reverse); shifts body closer to freeing (2,3).\n- **Turn 39**: Move \"R\" to (4,4) – Only valid move; (2,3) is now the tail cell and vacated after this move.\n- **Turn 40**: Move \"D\" to (4,3) – Down move valid; positions toward (2,3) for food.\n- **Turn 41**: Move \"L\" to (3,3) – Left move valid; adjacent to (2,3) food.\n- **Turn 42**: Move \"L\" to (2,3) – Eat food (life span 2 left); snake grows to length 9 with no collision risk (head not adjacent to tail).\n\nThis sequence eats one positive food (+1 score) by turn 42 and ensures survival by avoiding all hazards. Beyond turn 42, the snake can explore freely.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 35: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 36: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 37: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 38: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 39: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 40: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 41: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 42: \\text{L}\n}",

        "step": 36,
        "score": 7,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 36. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,5), then body segments at (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved up to (1,5) from (1,4) previously? Positions are given with head first: [(1,5), (1,4), ...] so from (1,4) to (1,5) is up, so current direction is U, which matches.\n\nFood: There are two food items:\n\n- (2,2) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,3) with life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1 each.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (1,5). From here, possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right.\n\nBut we have to consider walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n\nCurrent direction is U (up). So moving down would be reverse, but since we can only not do instant reverse, moving down is opposite, so it's not allowed? Let's see the rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so moving D would be opposite, so not allowed. Similarly, L and R are perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nPossible actions from (1,5):\n\n- U (up): to (1,6)\n\n- D (down): to (1,4) but (1,4) is the second segment of the snake. But according to the rules, we can move into the tail segment because the tail will move away. Let's check.\n\nSnake positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), etc. If head moves to (1,4), which is the current position of the second segment, but after moving, the tail will move, so it might be okay, but we need to see if it causes collision.\n\nThe rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to the tail segment is allowed because the tail moves, so no collision.\n\nBut in this case, (1,4) is not the tail; the tail is at (4,5). Snake positions: indices 0: head (1,5), 1: (1,4), 2: (1,3), 3: (2,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,5) tail.\n\nSo (1,4) is segment 1, not the tail. If head moves to (1,4), which is occupied by segment 1, that would be a body collision because it's not the tail segment. Only the tail segment is safe to move into because it moves away.\n\nThe rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut here, (1,4) is not the tail; it's the neck or something. So moving to (1,4) would cause head to touch body segment, which is deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (1,6) or (0,5) or (2,5), but walls.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSo from (1,5):\n\n- U (up): to (1,6). Is (1,6) valid? y=6, which is within 1 to 6? Grid is from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so y=6 is not y=7, so no wall. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is an obstacle, but (1,6) is not listed, so should be free. But let's list all obstacles.\n\nWalls: border cells: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So cells like (0,0), (0,1), ..., (0,7), (7,0), ..., (7,7), (0,0) to (0,7), etc., and (0,0) to (7,0), etc. But internal obstacles are additional.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n\nSo for (1,6): x=1, y=6. Not on border since x=1 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7. Not in internal obstacles, so free.\n\nBut is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (1,6) is not in this list, so empty.\n\n- D (down): to (1,4). But (1,4) is occupied by segment 1 of snake, which is a body segment, not tail. So moving here would cause collision. Not allowed.\n\n- L (left): to (0,5). But x=0 is border wall, so wall collision, not allowed.\n\n- R (right): to (2,5). x=2, y=5. Not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2). (2,5) not listed, so free. Snake? Not occupied, so should be ok.\n\nBut (2,5) is empty? Snake positions don't have (2,5), so yes.\n\nSo possible moves from (1,5): U to (1,6) or R to (2,5). D and L not possible.\n\nNow, food positions: (2,2) and (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is a food position, but in snake positions, (2,3) is segment 3. Snake: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), ...] so (2,3) is occupied by snake body.\n\nFood at (2,3) with life span 8, value 1.\n\nBut the rule about food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo currently, (2,3) has food, but it's under the snake body, so it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and then head moves there later. But for now, we can't eat it directly because the body is there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is free, I think.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nCurrent head at (1,5), direction U.\n\nOptions: U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), then head at (1,6), direction U.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U to (1,7), but y=7 is border wall, so not allowed. D to (1,5), but that's where I came from, but (1,5) will be occupied by the body? After moving, the snake moves: head to new position, body follows.\n\nAfter move to (1,6), snake positions: head (1,6), then previous head (1,5) becomes body, so positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)] tail was (4,5), but since we moved, the tail moves to the next, wait no.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so the last segment (tail) is removed, but if we eat food, we add a segment.\n\nSince we didn't eat food, tail is removed.\n\nCurrent snake length 8, no food eaten, so after move, head moves to new position, and tail is removed, so positions: [new head, then previous head, then body except tail is gone].\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: (1,5), 1: (1,4), 2: (1,3), 3: (2,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (1,6): new head (1,6), then the body segments shift: position 1 becomes (1,5), position 2 becomes (1,4), position 3 becomes (1,3), position 4 becomes (2,3), position 5 becomes (3,3), position 6 becomes (4,3), and position 7 (tail) is gone, so tail was (4,5), but it moves to where position 6 was? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So new body segments: segment 1 (after head) is old head position, segment 2 is old segment 1 position, and so on, down to segment n-1 is old segment n-2 position, and the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSince no food, length decreases? No, in snake, when no food eaten, the tail end is not added, so the snake moves forward, head new position, tail removed, so length same, but positions shift.\n\nIn terms of cells: the cell that was tail is now empty, and head occupies a new cell.\n\nPositions: after moving to (1,6), the new positions are:\n\nHead: (1,6)\n\nThen segment 1: previous head (1,5)\n\nSegment 2: previous segment 1 (1,4)\n\nSegment 3: previous segment 2 (1,3)\n\nSegment 4: previous segment 3 (2,3)\n\nSegment 5: previous segment 4 (3,3)\n\nSegment 6: previous segment 5 (4,3)\n\nSegment 7: previous segment 6 (4,4)  // since tail was segment 7 at (4,5), but it moves to where segment 6 was? Let's list indices.\n\nOld positions: seg0: (1,5), seg1: (1,4), seg2: (1,3), seg3: (2,3), seg4: (3,3), seg5: (4,3), seg6: (4,4), seg7: (4,5)\n\nAfter move head to (1,6):\n\nNew seg0 (head): (1,6)\n\nNew seg1: old seg0 = (1,5)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 = (1,4)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 = (1,3)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 = (2,3)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 = (3,3)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 = (4,3)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 = (4,4)  // and old seg7 (4,5) is no longer part of snake, so tail is now at (4,4)\n\nLength is still 8, but the tail moved from (4,5) to (4,4).\n\nIn the shift, since no food eaten, the last position is removed, so new snake has segments from new head to the second last old segment? I think I confused.\n\nStandard: the snake has N segments. When it moves without eating, the head moves to a new position, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail position is abandoned.\n\nSo new positions: head to new cell, then body: segment 1 to old head, segment 2 to old segment 1, ..., segment k to old segment k-1 for k from 1 to N-1, and the old tail is gone.\n\nSo for N=8, segments 0 to 7.\n\nAfter move, new seg0 to new position, new seg1 to old seg0, new seg2 to old seg1, ..., new seg7 to old seg6.\n\nOld seg7 is not used, so it's removed.\n\nSo in this case, new snake: seg0: (1,6) new head\n\nseg1: old seg0 = (1,5)\n\nseg2: old seg1 = (1,4)\n\nseg3: old seg2 = (1,3)\n\nseg4: old seg3 = (2,3)\n\nseg5: old seg4 = (3,3)\n\nseg6: old seg5 = (4,3)\n\nseg7: old seg6 = (4,4)  // new tail at (4,4)\n\nOld seg7 (4,5) is now empty.\n\nSimilarly, if we had eaten food, we would keep the tail, so new seg7 would be old seg7, and add a new segment at the end, but not here.\n\nBack to the move.\n\nFrom (1,5), if I go U to (1,6), head at (1,6), direction U.\n\nThen from (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7), but y=7 is wall, not allowed. D to (1,5), which is now occupied by seg1, body segment, not tail, so collision. L to (0,6), x=0 wall, not allowed. R to (2,6), which should be free, no wall or obstacle.\n\n(2,6): x=2, y=6, not border, not in obstacles list, not snake, so ok.\n\nSo from (1,6), only R to (2,6) is possible? U, D, L all invalid, so must go R.\n\nThen to (2,6), direction R.\n\nFrom (2,6), possible moves: U to (2,7) y=7 wall, no; D to (2,5); L to (1,6) but (1,6) is previous head, now body; R to (3,6).\n\n(2,5) : let's see, after this move, but we need to think state.\n\nPerhaps it's better to simulate.\n\nFirst option: from current, go U to (1,6)\n\nThen from (1,6), only R to (2,6)\n\nNow at (2,6), direction R.\n\nFrom (2,6), moves: U to (2,7) wall, invalid; D to (2,5); L to (1,6) which is body segment, collision; R to (3,6)\n\n(2,5): is it free? Currently, after moving to (2,6), snake positions: head (2,6), seg1 (1,6), seg2 (1,5), seg3 (1,4), seg4 (1,3), seg5 (2,3), seg6 (3,3), seg7 (4,3)  // tail at (4,3)? Let's list.\n\nAfter first move to (1,6): snake: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nThen from (1,6) to (2,6): new head (2,6), seg1 old head (1,6), seg2 old seg1 (1,5), seg3 old seg2 (1,4), seg4 old seg3 (1,3), seg5 old seg4 (2,3), seg6 old seg5 (3,3), seg7 old seg6 (4,3)  // old seg7 (4,4) gone? Old positions before second move: head (1,6), seg1 (1,5), seg2 (1,4), seg3 (1,3), seg4 (2,3), seg5 (3,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4)\n\nAfter move to (2,6): new head (2,6), new seg1: old head (1,6), new seg2: old seg1 (1,5), new seg3: old seg2 (1,4), new seg4: old seg3 (1,3), new seg5: old seg4 (2,3), new seg6: old seg5 (3,3), new seg7: old seg6 (4,3)  // and old seg7 (4,4) abandoned.\n\nSo snake now: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) tail at (4,3)\n\nFrom (2,6), possible moves:\n\n- U (2,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D (2,5): is it occupied? (2,5) not in snake positions, and not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n\n- L (1,6): but (1,6) is seg1, body segment, collision.\n\n- R (3,6): free, no wall, etc.\n\nSo can go D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf I go to (2,5), then head at (2,5), direction D.\n\nFrom there, I can go to (2,4) or other, but (2,4) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (2,4) is listed, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — yes, (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot move to (2,4).\n\nFrom (2,5), moves:\n\nU to (2,6) — but (2,6) is previous head, now body, collision.\n\nD to (2,4) — obstacle, wall.\n\nL to (1,5) — which is seg2, body, collision.\n\nR to (3,5) — should be free.\n\n(3,5): not border, not obstacle, not snake, so ok.\n\nSo only possible move to R (3,5).\n\nThen to (3,5), and so on.\n\nBut let's not get too deep yet.\n\nThe other initial option is to go R from current position to (2,5).\n\nCurrent position (1,5), go R to (2,5).\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction R (since from (1,5) to (2,5) is right).\n\nFrom there, as above, only possible move to R (3,5) or other, but as above, only R to (3,5) is possible? From (2,5), moves:\n\nU (2,6): if free, but in the state after moving to (2,5), let's see snake positions.\n\nCurrent before move: head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nGo R to (2,5): new head (2,5), seg1 old head (1,5), seg2 old seg1 (1,4), seg3 old seg2 (1,3), seg4 old seg3 (2,3), seg5 old seg4 (3,3), seg6 old seg5 (4,3), seg7 old seg6 (4,4)  // old seg7 (4,5) gone\n\nSnake: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail at (4,4)\n\nFrom (2,5), moves:\n\nU to (2,6): free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so yes.\n\nD to (2,4): obstacle, wall.\n\nL to (1,5): body segment seg1, collision.\n\nR to (3,5): free.\n\nSo can go U to (2,6) or R to (3,5).\n\nNow, food is at (2,2) and (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is currently occupied by snake body, seg4 in this state? Snake positions: head (2,5), seg1 (1,5), seg2 (1,4), seg3 (1,3), seg4 (2,3), etc. So (2,3) is seg4, body segment, with food under it.\n\nBut we can't eat it now because body is there.\n\n(2,2) is free, and has food with life span 6.\n\nLife span: food disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn t=36, food at (2,2) life span 6, so it will disappear at turn 36 + 6 - 1? Life span N means it lasts for N turns, from spawn to disappear.\n\nThe rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Or at turn t + L?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life span L. On turn t, countdown is L, then turn t+1, countdown L-1, ..., until countdown 1 on turn t+L-1, and after that, on turn t+L, it disappears? Or on turn t+L-1 it is eaten or disappears?\n\nThe rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor example, if at turn 10, food with life span 3, then on turn 10, countdown 3, turn 11 countdown 2, turn 12 countdown 1, and after turn 12, it disappears, so on turn 13 it's gone. But the countdown decreases each turn, so on the turn when countdown becomes 0, it disappears.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is L, after turn t, it becomes L-1 for turn t+1, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, on turn t, countdown L; turn t+1, countdown L-1; ... turn t+L-1, countdown 1; and after this turn, before turn t+L, it disappears, so on turn t+L, it is not there.\n\nSince countdown decreases at the end of the turn or during?\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so when it is presented, the countdown is for the current turn, and it decreases each turn.\n\nAt the start of turn t, the food has a certain life span, and after the snake moves, the countdown decreases.\n\nBut for eating, if the head moves to a food cell, it is eaten during the move.\n\nThen, after the move, for all food, countdown decreases.\n\nSo for food at (2,2) at turn 36, life span 6, so countdown 6. After turn 36, if not eaten, countdown 5 for turn 37, and so on, until countdown 0 after turn 41, disappears at turn 42.\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,3) life span 8, at turn 36 countdown 8, disappears after turn 43.\n\nNow, back to decisions.\n\nI need to plan to eat food while avoiding risks.\n\nFood at (2,2) is available, but at (2,2), which is below.\n\nCurrent head at (1,5), food at (2,2) is at y=2, so down.\n\nBut from (1,5), I can go R to (2,5), then from there, I can go down? But (2,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly down from (2,5).\n\nFrom (2,5), I can only go U to (2,6) or R to (3,5).\n\nTo reach (2,2), I need to go left or down, but left is not possible from (2,5), and down is blocked.\n\nThe snake is mostly on the left, with tail around (4,3)-(4,4).\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,3) is under the body, so to eat it, the body must move away first.\n\nCurrently at (2,3) is occupied.\n\nIn the state, if I move the snake, it might move away.\n\nFor example, if I go U from current, to (1,6), then to (2,6), then to (2,5) or (3,6), etc., but (2,3) might be vacated.\n\nLet's simulate both options with 5 turns.\n\nFirst, option A: go U to (1,6) at turn 36.\n\nThen at turn 37, from (1,6), only possible move R to (2,6) (since U wall, D body, L wall).\n\nSo turn 37: R to (2,6)\n\nNow at (2,6), direction R.\n\nAt turn 38, from (2,6), can go D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nNow, if I go to (2,5), then at (2,5), and from there only R to (3,5) as U to (2,6) is body, D obstacle, L body.\n\nIf I go to (3,6), then from there can go down or left, etc.\n\nBut let's see where the food is.\n\nFood at (2,2) life span 6, at turn 36 countdown 6.\n\nAfter turn 36, not eaten, so turn 37 countdown 5.\n\nAfter turn 37, not eaten, turn 38 countdown 4, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,3) countdown 8 at turn 36, turn 37 countdown 7, etc.\n\nNow, to eat (2,2), I need to get to (2,2).\n\nFrom current, if I go R to (2,5) at turn 36.\n\nThen at (2,5), at turn 37 I can go U to (2,6) or R to (3,5).\n\nIf I go R to (3,5), then at (3,5), I can go U, D, L, R.\n\nFrom (3,5): U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5) body, R to (4,5).\n\n(3,4): not wall, not obstacle, not snake? In state, after moving to (3,5), snake is: let's not list all.\n\nBut (3,4) might be free.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go down to (3,3), but (3,3) is part of snake body, depending on position.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the area around (2,2).\n\n(2,2) has walls/obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, (2,4) is obstacle, so (2,2) is accessible from (2,3) or (1,2) or (3,2), but (1,2) obstacle, so only from (2,3) or (3,2) or (2,1), but y=1 not wall yet, y=0 is wall, so (2,1) is possible if not obstacle.\n\nObstacles are only the listed, so (2,1) is free.\n\nBut to reach (2,2), I can come from above (2,3), but (2,3) has food under snake, or from left (1,2) obstacle, or right (3,2), or below (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) can be accessed from (2,2), (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, (1,3), (3,3), etc.\n\nNow, the snake body is on (1,3), (2,3), etc., so to eat (2,3), I need to move the snake so that (2,3) is vacated, then head moves there.\n\nCurrently, at turn 36, (2,3) is occupied.\n\nIf I move the head away, the body might shift.\n\nFor example, if I go U to (1,6), then as before, after two moves, at turn 38 at (2,6) or (2,5).\n\nLet's list the snake positions over turns.\n\nFirst, current turn 36: snake: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nOption 1: turn 36 move U to (1,6)\n\nAfter move, snake: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // tail at (4,4)\n\nTurn 37: move R to (2,6) (only choice)\n\nSnake: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)  // tail at (4,3)\n\nNow at turn 38, from (2,6), I can go D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nSuboption A1: go D to (2,5)\n\nTurn 38: to (2,5)\n\nSnake: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)  // tail at (3,3)\n\n(2,3) is still occupied, by seg5 in this case.\n\nFood at (2,3) is there, but occupied.\n\nThen turn 39, from (2,5), only move R to (3,5) (U to (2,6) body, D obstacle, L body)\n\nGo to (3,5)\n\nSnake: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)  // tail at (2,3)\n\nNow (2,3) is tail! So it is vacated when we move next.\n\nAt turn 40, head at (3,5), can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5) body, R to (4,5).\n\n(2,5) is seg1, body, so collision if go L.\n\nU to (3,6): free? Assume yes.\n\nD to (3,4): free, no obstacle.\n\nR to (4,5): free, but (4,5) might be something, but in previous, not occupied.\n\nInternal obstacle (6,4), (5,1), etc., not (4,5).\n\nSo can go U, D, or R.\n\nIf I go D to (3,4), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) is now tail, and at turn 40, when we move, if we don't eat, the tail moves.\n\nAt turn 39, snake tail at (2,3)\n\nTurn 40, if we move head to new position, tail will move from (2,3), so (2,3) is vacated.\n\nThen at turn 40, (2,3) is empty, and food is there, so we can eat it if head moves to (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,5), (2,3) is at (3-1,5-2) = (2,3), which is left and down, but not adjacent directly; from (3,5), adjacent cells are (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5). (2,3) is not adjacent; it's two steps away.\n\n(3,5) to (2,3) is not adjacent; distance |dx|=1, |dy|=2, so not directly reachable.\n\nTo reach (2,3) from (3,5), I need to go to (2,5) or (3,4) first, but (2,5) is body, not possible.\n\nGo to (3,4), then from (3,4) to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, or to (3,3) or (4,4), etc., not directly to (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,4), (2,3) is adjacent: left and down, but (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot go directly to (2,3) from (3,4) because not adjacent horizontally or vertically; (3,4) and (2,3) are diagonal, not adjacent in grid, only orthogonal moves.\n\nSo from (3,4), moves are (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4). (2,4) obstacle, so cannot go there. (3,3) possible.\n\nBut (2,3) is not adjacent to (3,4); it's at (2,3), which is left and down, but since only orthogonal, from (3,4) I can go to (3,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) wall, or (4,4), or (3,5).\n\nNone of these are (2,3). To reach (2,3) from (3,4), I need to go to (2,3) from (1,3) or (2,2) or (3,3), but (3,3) is adjacent to (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,4), go to (3,3), then from (3,3) to (2,3).\n\nBut at that point, (2,3) may not have food or something.\n\nIn this path, at turn 39, head at (3,5), snake has (2,3) as tail.\n\nTurn 40, if I move head to, say, (3,4), then new head (3,4), body: seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), etc., and tail moves from (2,3) to previous position, so (2,3) is vacated.\n\nAfter move at turn 40 to (3,4), snake: head (3,4), seg1 old head (3,5), seg2 old seg1 (2,5), seg3 old seg2 (2,6), seg4 old seg3 (1,6), seg5 old seg4 (1,5), seg6 old seg5 (1,4), seg7 old seg6 (1,3)  // old seg7 (2,3) gone, so (2,3) empty now, and food is there with countdown.\n\nAt turn 40, after move, food countdown decreases.\n\nBut to eat, during the move.\n\nAt turn 40, when I move to (3,4), I don't eat (2,3), since not moving there.\n\nThen after move, (2,3) is empty with food, so at turn 41, I can move to (2,3) to eat.\n\nFrom (3,4), at turn 40, I can go to (3,3), for example.\n\nGo to (3,3), then (2,3) is adjacent.\n\nBut at turn 40, after moving to (3,4), the food at (2,3) is still there, countdown decreasing.\n\nTurn 36: food (2,3) countdown 8\n\nTurn 37: after turn 36, countdown 7\n\nTurn 38: after turn 37, countdown 6\n\nTurn 39: after turn 38, countdown 5\n\nTurn 40: after turn 39, countdown 4\n\nAt turn 40, I move to (3,4), not eating (2,3), so after move, countdown decreases to 3 for turn 41.\n\nThen at turn 41, from (3,4), I can go to (3,3), which is free, or other.\n\nGo to (3,3), then head at (3,3), and (2,3) is adjacent.\n\nBut when I move to (3,3), if (3,3) has food or not, but in this case, it might be empty.\n\nAfter move to (3,3) at turn 41, then from there, I can go to (2,3) at turn 42.\n\nBut at turn 42, food countdown: at turn 41 after move, countdown 3-1=2 for turn 42? Let's track.\n\nFood (2,3) at turn 36: countdown 8\n\nAfter turn 36: countdown 7\n\nAfter turn 37: countdown 6\n\nAfter turn 38: countdown 5\n\nAfter turn 39: countdown 4\n\nAfter turn 40: countdown 3 (for turn 41)\n\nAt turn 41, if I move to (3,3), not eating (2,3), so after turn 41, countdown decreases to 2 for turn 42.\n\nThen at turn 42, I move to (2,3) from (3,3), and eat the food, countdown was 2, so it can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, for the other food.\n\nBut this is for option A1.\n\nLet's go back to the initial choice.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger. But here, no food on tail yet.\n\nNow, for the food at (2,2), life span 6 at turn 36.\n\nCountdown 6 at turn 36.\n\nAfter turn 36: 5\n\nTurn 37: 4\n\nTurn 38: 3\n\nTurn 39: 2\n\nTurn 40: 1\n\nAfter turn 40, countdown 0, so disappears at turn 41, not available.\n\nSo to eat (2,2), I must move to it by turn 40 at the latest.\n\nAt turn 40, if I move to (2,2), it can be eaten, countdown 1, after decrease to 0, but during move, it is eaten before countdown decrease.\n\nThe eating happens when head moves to the cell, before countdown decrease.\n\nSo as long as on the turn when countdown >0, it can be eaten.\n\nFor (2,2), countdown at turn 36:6, turn 37:5, ..., turn 40:1, so can be eaten on turn 40. On turn 41, it would be gone.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,3), countdown 8 at turn 36, can be eaten up to turn 43.\n\nNow, from current position (1,5), if I want to eat (2,2), I need to get to (2,2) soon.\n\nFrom (1,5), if I go R to (2,5) at turn 36.\n\nThen at (2,5), I can go to (2,6) or (3,5) at turn 37.\n\nIf I go to (2,6), then from (2,6) I can go to (2,5) or (3,6) at turn 38, but (2,5) is body if I came from there, etc.\n\nFrom (2,5), I cannot go down to (2,4) because obstacle.\n\nSo to reach (2,2), I need to go via (3,2) or (2,3) or (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, or (2,1).\n\nFor example, from (2,5), if I go R to (3,5) at turn 37.\n\nThen at (3,5), at turn 38, I can go D to (3,4), then to (3,3) at turn 39, then to (3,2) or (2,3) at turn 40.\n\n(3,2) is adjacent to (2,2), so at turn 40, from (3,2) to (2,2) to eat.\n\nBut can I reach (3,2) by turn 40?\n\nTurn 36: go R to (2,5)\n\nSnake: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nTurn 37: from (2,5), go R to (3,5) (assume we choose to go right)\n\nSnake: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)  // tail (4,4) gone, tail at (4,3)\n\nTurn 38: from (3,5), go D to (3,4)  (possible, and free)\n\nSnake: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)  // tail at (3,3)\n\nTurn 39: from (3,4), go D to (3,3) but (3,3) is tail? At this state, (3,3) is seg7, tail.\n\nIf I move to (3,3), which is the tail, it is allowed, and since it's food? (3,3) has no food, so no eat, but moving to tail is ok, no collision.\n\nGo to (3,3)\n\nThen new head (3,3), and since no eat, tail is removed, but old tail at (3,3), so moving to (3,3) which is tail, it is safe, and after move, the tail is gone, so new snake: head (3,3), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (1,5), seg5 (1,4), seg6 (1,3), seg7 (2,3)  // old seg7 (3,3) is where head moved, so it's occupied, but since we moved there, and no new segment, the last segment is old seg6 (2,3), so tail at (2,3)\n\nPositions: old before move: head (3,4), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (1,5), seg4 (1,4), seg5 (1,3), seg6 (2,3), seg7 (3,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,3): new head (3,3), new seg1 old head (3,4), new seg2 old seg1 (3,5), new seg3 old seg2 (2,5), new seg4 old seg3 (1,5), new seg5 old seg4 (1,4), new seg6 old seg5 (1,3), new seg7 old seg6 (2,3)  // old seg7 (3,3) gone, so (2,3) is now tail.\n\nAt turn 40, head at (3,3), can move to (2,3), which is tail, and it has food! Food at (2,3).\n\nBut tail reward danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nHere, at turn 39, head at (3,3), tail at (2,3), which is adjacent, and tail has food, so if I eat it, it will cause collision.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to tail position which has food, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail does not move, and the head is on the food cell, but since the tail was there, and we add a segment, so the new tail is where the old tail was, and head is on the same cell? No.\n\nWhen you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to the tail cell which has food, after eating, the head is on that cell, and the new tail is added at the old tail position, but since head is there, it's collision? Let's see.\n\nStandard: when you eat food, head moves to new position (food cell), and the tail remains, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo positions: new head at food cell, then the previous positions, with tail unchanged.\n\nSo if the food was under the tail, and head moves there, then new head at that cell, and the old tail is still there, so now two segments on the same cell? That would be collision.\n\nYes, the rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, head at (3,3), tail at (2,3), adjacent, tail has food, so if head moves to (2,3), it eats the food, but since it was the tail, after eating, the head is at (2,3), and the tail should stay at (2,3) because we add a segment, but it's the same cell, so immediate collision.\n\nTherefore, it's deadly, cannot eat when food is on tail and head adjacent.\n\nIn this path, at turn 40, if I try to move to (2,3) from (3,3), it would be fatal.\n\nOther moves from (3,3): U to (3,4) body, D to (3,2), L to (2,3) tail with food danger, R to (4,3) possible.\n\n(3,2) might be free.\n\nBut I was trying to reach (2,2) for eating.\n\nFrom (3,3) at turn 39, I can go to (3,2) at turn 40.\n\nThen from (3,2) to (2,2) at turn 41, but for food (2,2), at turn 41 it is gone, as countdown to 0 after turn 40.\n\nTurn 36: countdown 6 for (2,2)\n\nAfter turn 36: 5\n\nTurn 37: 4\n\nTurn 38: 3\n\nTurn 39: 2\n\nTurn 40: 1\n\nAfter turn 40, countdown 0, so on turn 41, it is gone. So last chance to eat is turn 40.\n\nAt turn 40, I need to be on (2,2).\n\nIn this path, at turn 39 I am at (3,3), at turn 40 I can move to (3,2) or (2,3) or (4,3), not to (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,2) not adjacent.\n\nSo I cannot reach (2,2) by turn 40 from here.\n\nIf from (3,4) at turn 38, I go to (3,3) at turn 39, same as above.\n\nOr from (3,4) go to (4,4) or other.\n\nBut I can't reach (2,2) in time from this path.\n\nNow, the other initial choice: go U first to (1,6) at turn 36.\n\nThen to (2,6) at turn 37.\n\nThen at turn 38, from (2,6), instead of going D, I can go R to (3,6).\n\nThen to (3,6), etc., but that takes me away from (2,2).\n\nSo to eat (2,2), I need to go directly towards it.\n\nFrom (1,5), go R to (2,5) at turn 36.\n\nThen at turn 37, from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6) or R to (3,5).\n\nBut to go down, I can't because of obstacle.\n\nPerhaps I can go left, but not possible.\n\nThe only way to (2,2) is via (2,3) or (3,2) or (2,1), but (2,3) is occupied.\n\nIf I can vacate (2,3) earlier.\n\nIn the first option where I went U then R, at turn 38 I was at (2,6), and (2,3) was still occupied.\n\nIn the position at turn 38 with option A: after turn 36 U to (1,6), turn 37 R to (2,6), snake at turn 38: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n\n(2,3) is seg5.\n\nThen if I go D to (2,5) at turn 38, snake: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n\nThen turn 39 go R to (3,5), snake: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)  // tail at (2,3)\n\nTurn 40, from (3,5), go to (3,4), snake: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  // tail (2,3) gone, so (2,3) empty.\n\nThen at turn 40, head at (3,4), I can go to (3,3) or other.\n\nBut (2,2) is not reachable.\n\nFrom (3,4) at turn 40, I can go to (3,3), then at turn 41 to (2,3) if food there, but for (2,2) it's too late.\n\nFor (2,2), I think I cannot eat it because of the obstacle and position, it's too far in 4 turns.\n\nTurn 36 to turn 40 is 5 turns? Turn 36 move, turn 37,38,39,40 move, so 5 moves including turn 36.\n\nFrom (1,5) to (2,2), the Manhattan distance is |2-1| + |2-5| = 1+3=4, so theoretically possible in 4 moves, but with obstacles and body, it may not be.\n\nFor example, from (1,5) to (2,5) turn 36, then to (3,5) turn 37, then to (3,4) turn 38, then to (3,3) turn 39, then to (3,2) or (2,3) turn 40.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,2) not adjacent, so to (3,2) at turn 40.\n\nThen at (3,2), (2,2) is adjacent, but at turn 41, food gone.\n\nIf I go directly from (2,5) to (2,4) but obstacle.\n\nOr from (1,5) go down, but not possible.\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat (2,2) because by turn 40 I can't reach it.\n\nFor example, shortest path: (1,5) -> (1,4) but (1,4) is body, not possible.\n\n(1,5) -> (2,5) turn 36, then (2,5) -> (2,4) obstacle, not possible.\n\n(1,5) -> (1,6) away.\n\nSo no way to reach (2,2) by turn 40, so I cannot eat it. It will disappear.\n\nSo focus on the other food at (2,3).\n\nFor (2,3), life span 8, countdown 8 at turn 36, can be eaten up to turn 43.\n\nNow, to eat it, I need to move the body away and then head there.\n\nIn the snake configuration, (2,3) is occupied, but as the snake moves, it can be vacated.\n\nFor example, in the first option, when I go U to (1,6) at turn 36, then R to (2,6) at turn 37, then at turn 38 I am at (2,6), and (2,3) is still occupied.\n\nIf I go D to (2,5) at turn 38, then as before, at turn 39 go to (3,5), and at turn 40, (2,3) is tail and vacated when I move.\n\nIn that case, at turn 40, (2,3) is empty with food, so I can move to it at turn 41 or later.\n\nSimilarly, if I go the other way.\n\nSo let's plan to eat (2,3).\n\nFirst, from current, if I go U to (1,6) at turn 36.\n\nThen turn 37 R to (2,6)\n\nTurn 38, from (2,6), I can go D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf I go D to (2,5), then turn 39 go R to (3,5)\n\nThen at turn 39, snake: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) tail at (2,3)\n\nTurn 40, from (3,5), I can go to (3,4) or (3,6) or (4,5), etc.\n\nAfter I move, say to (3,4), then (2,3) is vacated, empty with food.\n\nTurn 41, from (3,4), I can go to (3,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, or (4,4), or (3,5) body.\n\nSo go to (3,3) at turn 41.\n\nThen at (3,3), (2,3) is adjacent, so at turn 42, go to (2,3) to eat.\n\nFood countdown: turn 36:8, after36:7, after37:6, after38:5, after39:4, after40:3, so at turn 41, countdown 3, can be eaten at turn 42.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,3) at turn 42, it is eaten.\n\nNow, when I go to (2,3) from (3,3), it should be safe.\n\nBut at that point, is the head adjacent to tail or something? Not necessarily.\n\nIn this case, it should be fine.\n\nIf from (2,6) at turn 38 I go R to (3,6), then I might not vacate (2,3) as quickly.\n\nBut let's see the other initial move: go R to (2,5) at turn 36.\n\nThen at turn 37, from (2,5), go U to (2,6) or R to (3,5).\n\nIf I go R to (3,5), then similar to before.\n\nAt turn 36 go R to (2,5)\n\nSnake: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nTurn 37 go R to (3,5)\n\nSnake: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nTurn 38 go D to (3,4)\n\nSnake: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n\nTurn 39 go to (3,3)  // moving to tail, no food, so safe\n\nSnake: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)  // tail at (2,3)\n\nTurn 40 go to (3,4) or other, but after move, (2,3) vacated.\n\nThen turn 41 from (3,3) or wherever, to (2,3) later.\n\nBut similar.\n\nTo eat at (2,3), I need to have it vacated and head there.\n\nNow, in both cases, I can do it around turn 42.\n\nBut for the first option with U then R, at turn 38 I can choose to go to (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nIf I go to (3,6), it might take longer to reach back.\n\nBut let's think about survival.\n\nThe grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area around (1,6) and (2,6) might be tight.\n\nWith walls, the snake might get trapped.\n\nCurrent snake is on the left, head at (1,5), if I go U to (1,6), then to (2,6), then I have to go down or right.\n\nIf I go down to (2,5), then to (3,5), then I can go to (3,4), (3,3), etc.\n\nThe bottom left has obstacles at (1,2) and (2,4), so it might be congested.\n\nIf I go right to (3,5), I can explore more space.\n\nBut since I want to eat (2,3), going the first way might be better.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so I need space.\n\nBut let's decide the moves for the next few turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I think it's for the immediate turns, not necessarily 5, but based on thinking ahead.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to list actions for the current turn and possibly future, but it says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, ...\" so I need to output a sequence.\n\nBut how many? It doesn't specify, but probably for the current and next few, based on the plan.\n\nSince the state changes, I might output for t1 only, but the format shows multiple turns.\n\nLook: \"Turn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1 Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1 ...\"\n\nBut it might be open-ended, but for practical purposes, I can output for t1 and t1+1, or a few.\n\nBut to demonstrate the plan, I can output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for now, I can start with the first move.\n\nLet's choose to go U at turn 36 to (1,6), then R at turn 37 to (2,6), then at turn 38 go D to (2,5), then at turn 39 go R to (3,5), then at turn 40 go D to (3,4), then turn 41 go to (3,3), turn 42 go to (2,3) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 42, when I go to (2,3), it should be safe.\n\nFrom turn 40 at (3,4), I can go directly to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, not possible.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (3,3) at turn 41, then to (2,3) at turn 42.\n\nYes.\n\nIf from turn 38 at (2,6), I go R to (3,6), then to (3,5) or (4,6), etc., it takes longer to come back.\n\nSo the first path is better for eating the food.\n\nMoreover, with the U move, I avoid the risk of going right immediately where there might be less space.\n\nAt (1,5), if I go R to (2,5), then I am closer to the obstacle (2,4), and have to move right or up.\n\nBut with U, I go to (1,6), which is safer for now.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,3) will be available longer.\n\nSo I think going U at turn 36 is better.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be for the current turn and future.\n\nSince the state changes with each move, I need to output based on current state.\n\nBut for the response, I can output a plan for a few turns.\n\nLet's list the actions.\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nThen at turn 37, from (1,6), only R possible, so R\n\nTurn 38, from (2,6), I can choose D or R. If I go D to (2,5), then at turn 39 from (2,5) only R to (3,5), then at turn 40 from (3,5) I can go D to (3,4) or U to (3,6) or R to (4,5), etc.\n\nTo reach (2,3), going D to (3,4) is better.\n\nThen from (3,4) to (3,3) at turn 41, then to (2,3) at turn 42.\n\nBut at turn 42, I eat.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 38 or so.\n\nSince the food life span is long, I can be flexible.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating the food is good.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, the snake grows, so I need to have space.\n\nBut for now, let's start with U.\n\nI think for turn 36, action U.\n\nThen the sequence can be U, then R, then D, then R, then D, etc.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I need to think at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing eating the positive food at (2,3) while avoiding risks such as collisions and dead ends. The food at (2,2) has a short remaining lifespan (countdown 6 at turn 36, disappearing after turn 40) and is difficult to reach safely due to obstacles and the snake's position, so I will focus on the food at (2,3), which has a longer lifespan (countdown 8 at turn 36, disappearing after turn 43).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current Position and Constraints**: The snake head is at (1,5) with direction U. Possible moves are U to (1,6) or R to (2,5), as D is invalid (body collision at (1,4)) and L is invalid (wall at x=0). \n- **Food at (2,3)**: This food is under the snake's body (segment at turn 36) and can only be eaten once the body moves away and the head moves onto it. The plan must vacate (2,3) and position the head to eat it around turn 41-42.\n- **Path to Food**: Moving U then R allows the snake to loop around, vacating (2,3) by turn 40, then approach (2,3) from (3,3) at turn 42 for safe eating.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: \n  - Moving U first avoids immediate congestion near obstacles (e.g., (2,4)) and provides more maneuvering space.\n  - After eating, the snake grows, so future moves must avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n  - The sequence ensures no tail reward danger (head not adjacent to tail when eating).\n- **5-Turn Simulation**:\n  - Turn 36: Move U to (1,6) – Positions head safely away from body congestion.\n  - Turn 37: Move R to (2,6) – Only valid move; head direction now R.\n  - Turn 38: Move D to (2,5) – Heads toward the area to vacate (2,3).\n  - Turn 39: Move R to (3,5) – Continues path; (2,3) becomes tail and will vacate next turn.\n  - Turn 40: Move D to (3,4) – Vacates (2,3); now empty with food.\n  - Turn 41: Move to (3,3) – Positions adjacent to (2,3) for eating.\n  - Turn 42: Move to (2,3) – Eats food; snake grows to length 9.\n\nThis plan safely eats the food at (2,3) by turn 42, well within its lifespan, and avoids all collisions. After eating, future moves can explore for more food or navigate open areas.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions for turns 36 to 42 are as follows, based on the current state and lookahead:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 36: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 37: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 38: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 39: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 40: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 41: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 42: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. My goal is to maximize the score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I need to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent state for turn 37:\n\n- **Walls**: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), with borders. Internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\n- **Snake positions**: Head is at (1,6), then body segments: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (1,6) from below, so previous position was (1,5), but since it's moving Up, y increases.\n\nHead direction is U, so it's facing upwards. That means from (1,5) to (1,6), since U is (x,y+1).\n\nSnake positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nSo head at (1,6), tail at (4,4). Head direction U.\n\n- **Food**: Three food items:\n\n  - (2,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n  - (2,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n  - (1,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: each has a countdown that decreases every turn, including the current turn. So on turn 37, life span decreases to the given values.\n\nFor example, (2,2) has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 more turns, so by turn 42 it's gone if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) life span 7, gone by turn 44.\n\n(1,3) life span 10, gone by turn 47.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns. The answer should be in the format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 37: action\nTurn 38: action\n...\n}\n\nBut how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 turns, but the output might show a sequence. The format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify for several turns. Since it's a sequence, I should decide the moves step by step.\n\nBut I have to think ahead to make decisions. I should simulate the possible moves.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls at borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: head (1,6), body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nFood at: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3)\n\n(1,3) is a food position, but (1,3) is also occupied by the snake! Snake has (1,3) as the fourth segment.\n\nLook: snake positions: index 0: (1,6) head, index 1: (1,5), index 2: (1,4), index 3: (1,3), then index 4: (2,3), etc.\n\nAnd food at (1,3) with life span 10, value 1.\n\nBut the food is under the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is also a food position, and (2,3) is occupied by the snake! Snake position index 4 is (2,3).\n\nFood at (2,3) with life span 7, value 1.\n\nAnd (2,2) is free, I think.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nFood: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3)\n\nBut (2,3) and (1,3) are occupied by snake body, so food is under them.\n\n(2,2) is not occupied, so it's visible.\n\nNow, head is at (1,6), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so I cannot instantly reverse to D, because no instant reverse rule. So I cannot move Down on the next turn.\n\nAvailable moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is opposite, not allowed.\n\nNow, let's see what each move does.\n\nFirst, if I move Up from (1,6) to (1,7). But y=7 is the border wall, so (1,7) is a wall cell. Moving there would cause wall collision, death. So Up is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, Left: from (1,6) to (0,6). x=0 is border wall, so Left to (0,6) is wall, death.\n\nRight: from (1,6) to (2,6). What is (2,6)? Is it wall or free?\n\nWalls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,6) is not a wall, and not occupied by snake? Snake is at (1,6),(1,5),etc., (4,4), so (2,6) is free except for food, but no food at (2,6), food at (2,2),(2,3),(1,3).\n\n(2,3) is food but under snake.\n\nSo moving Right to (2,6) should be safe? Let's check.\n\n(2,6): x=2, y=6. Not border, not in internal obstacles: internal are (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2). (2,4) is an obstacle, but (2,6) is different.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, (2,6) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, Down: but Down is opposite direction, not allowed because head direction is U, moving D would be reverse.\n\nAvailable moves: only Right is possible? Up is wall, Left is wall, Down not allowed. So only Right?\n\nBut Down is not allowed because of no instant reverse.\n\nConfirm: head direction is U, so I just moved Up to (1,6). So next move, I cannot move Down immediately.\n\nAnd Up and Left are walls.\n\nSo only possible move is Right to (2,6).\n\nIs that right?\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n(1,6): moving Up to (1,7): y=7 is border, wall.\n\nMoving Left to (0,6): x=0 wall.\n\nMoving Down to (1,5): but (1,5) is the body segment. Snake positions: (1,6) head, (1,5) is the first body segment.\n\nIf I move Down to (1,5), that would be colliding with body, death.\n\nBut according to rules, body collision is deadly, except for the tail if it moves away.\n\nLet's read: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nIn this case, (1,5) is not the tail; tail is at (4,4). (1,5) is the segment just behind head, so moving to (1,5) would collide with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, moving Right to (2,6): not occupied, not wall, so safe.\n\nBut is there any other option? What about the direction change.\n\nHead direction is U, so after moving, the direction will change.\n\nBut for now, on turn 37, from (1,6), only Right is possible and safe? Let's list all adjacent cells.\n\nAdjacent to (1,6):\n\n- Up: (1,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (1,5) - occupied by body (snake[1]), not tail, so collision, invalid\n\n- Left: (0,6) - x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,6) - not wall, not occupied, so valid\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is Right to (2,6).\n\nBut the food is at (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), which are not near.\n\n(2,3) is food but under snake body.\n\nSo for turn 37, I must move Right to (2,6).\n\nThen head moves to (2,6), and the snake body follows: the tail end moves forward, so the new positions will be: head at (2,6), then body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). Tail was (4,4), but since head moved, the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment? Standard snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo current positions: indices: 0: (1,6), 1: (1,5), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,3), 4: (2,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,6), the new positions:\n\nHead: (2,6)\n\nThen segment 1 moves to where head was, (1,6)\n\nSegment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (1,5)\n\nSegment 3 moves to where segment 2 was, (1,4)\n\nSegment 4 moves to where segment 3 was, (1,3)\n\nSegment 5 moves to where segment 4 was, (2,3)\n\nSegment 6 moves to where segment 5 was, (3,3)\n\nSegment 7 moves to where segment 6 was, (4,3)\n\nAnd tail was segment 7, so it moves to (4,3), and (4,4) is now empty.\n\nThe snake has 8 segments, so after move, it still has 8 segments unless food is eaten.\n\nNo food eaten, so length same.\n\nNew snake: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nTail is (4,3).\n\nNow, head at (2,6), and head direction: since I moved Right, new direction is R.\n\nNow, food: (2,2) life span now 4? Turn 37, food life span decreases each turn.\n\nOn turn 37, when we process, life span decreases.\n\nCurrent turn is 37, so at the start of turn 37, food has given life span.\n\nAfter actions, life span decreases.\n\nThe rules: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo on turn 37, for food, life span decreases by 1 from the given value.\n\nGiven: turn 37, food: (2,2,5,1) so life span 5 at turn 37 start.\n\nAfter turn 37, it decreases to 4 for turn 38.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3,7,1) to 6, (1,3,10,1) to 9.\n\nBut since we moved, no food eaten.\n\nNow, for turn 38.\n\nHead at (2,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse: current direction R, so cannot move Left (opposite).\n\nNow, adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (2,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (2,5) - is it free? Not occupied? Snake positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n\n(2,5) not in list, and not wall? Walls: borders and internal.\n\n(2,5) x=2,y=5, not border, not in internal obstacles: (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2). (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is different, so free. So (2,5) is free.\n\n- Left: (1,6) - but (1,6) is occupied by body, snake[1], and not tail, so collision, invalid. Also, moving Left is opposite to current direction R, so doubly invalid.\n\n- Right: (3,6) - not wall, not occupied, free.\n\nSo possible moves: Down to (2,5) or Right to (3,6).\n\nBoth seem safe.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term survival.\n\nFood available: (2,2) with life span 4 (after turn 37), so must be eaten by turn 41 to disappear on 42? Life span decreases each turn, so if life span is L on turn T, it disappears at the end of turn T+L? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose life span N on turn T. After each turn, it decreases. After N turns, it reaches 0 and disappears.\n\nOn turn T, life span N.\n\nAfter turn T, it becomes N-1 for turn T+1.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn T + (N-1), it becomes 1 for turn T + N.\n\nThen after turn T+N, it becomes 0 and disappears, so not available on turn T+N+1.\n\nBut when can it be eaten? On any turn when it exists, before it disappears.\n\nFor (2,2): life span 5 on turn 37, so:\n\nTurn 37: life span 5\n\nAfter turn 37: life span 4 (for turn 38)\n\nAfter turn 38: life span 3 (turn 39)\n\nAfter turn 39: life span 2 (turn 40)\n\nAfter turn 40: life span 1 (turn 41)\n\nAfter turn 41: life span 0, disappears, not available on turn 42.\n\nSo must be eaten by turn 41.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3): life span 7 on turn 37, after turn 37:6, ... disappears after turn 43, not available turn 44.\n\n(1,3): life span 10 on turn 37, after turn 37:9, ... disappears after turn 46, not available turn 47.\n\nNow, (2,3) and (1,3) are under snake body, so we need to move the body away to eat them.\n\nCurrently, (2,3) is occupied by snake body: in new positions after turn 37, (2,3) is the fifth segment? After move, snake: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nSo (2,3) is position of segment 5, index 5 if head is 0.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is segment 4.\n\nFood at (2,3) and (1,3) are under these.\n\nTo eat, we need the body to move away and head to move on.\n\nAlso, (2,2) is free, but we are at (2,6), which is far.\n\nNow, back to turn 38 choices.\n\nHead at (2,6), can go Down to (2,5) or Right to (3,6).\n\nIf I go Down to (2,5), then head to (2,5), body follows: head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). Tail (4,3) moves off.\n\nSnake: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nLength 8.\n\nDirection: moved Down, so new direction D.\n\nFood: (2,2) life span now 3 for turn 38? After turn 37, life spans: (2,2) life span 4 (turn 38), (2,3) life span 6 (turn 38), (1,3) life span 9 (turn 38). But (2,3) and (1,3) are still under body.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is below.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go Down to (2,4), but (2,4) is an internal obstacle! Walls include (2,4) as internal obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo (2,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo from (2,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction is D (down), so cannot move Up (opposite).\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- Up: (2,6) - occupied by body, snake[1], collision, invalid\n\n- Down: (2,4) - wall, invalid\n\n- Left: (1,5) - occupied? (1,5) is body, snake[3] in current, but after move to (2,5), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), etc. So (1,5) is occupied by segment, not tail, so collision.\n\n- Right: (3,5) - free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\nSo only Right to (3,5) possible from (2,5).\n\nThen continue.\n\nIf on turn 38 I go Right to (3,6) instead.\n\nHead to (3,6), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), tail (4,3) moves, new tail (3,3)? After move: head (3,6), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) — (4,3) gone.\n\nSnake: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (3,6), can go U, D, L, R, but no reverse, so cannot move Left.\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- Up: (3,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (3,5) free\n\n- Left: (2,6) occupied by body, invalid\n\n- Right: (4,6) free\n\nSo Down or Right.\n\nNow, to reach food, I need to go down towards (2,2) or to free the body-covered food.\n\nBut (2,2) is at (2,2), and we are at (2,6) or (3,6), so need to go down.\n\nAlso, the body-covered food at (2,3) and (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), which is currently occupied.\n\nTo eat (1,3), we need the snake to move so that (1,3) is vacated, then head moves there.\n\nSimilarly for (2,3).\n\nSince the snake is long, moving the body might take time.\n\nLet's think about the snake path.\n\nThe snake is currently along the left and bottom, but head at (2,6).\n\nPositions after turn 37 move: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nSo it's like a path from (4,3) to (2,6) via left and up.\n\n(1,3) and (2,3) are occupied.\n\nIf the snake moves, the body segments will shift.\n\nFor example, if we move down or right, the tail moves, but (1,3) and (2,3) might be vacated eventually.\n\nBut we need to plan to be near to eat the food when it's free.\n\nAlso, (2,2) is at (2,2), which is below (2,3), but (2,3) has food under it, but (2,2) is separate.\n\n(2,2) is free, so we can eat it directly if we go there.\n\nBut to go to (2,2) from (2,6), we need to go down, but there is an obstacle at (2,4), so we cannot go directly down from (2,6) to (2,5) to (2,4) because (2,4) is wall.\n\nFrom (2,6), if I go to (2,5) on turn 38, then from (2,5), as I thought earlier, only possible move is Right to (3,5), since Up, Down, Left are invalid.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (3,4) or other.\n\nBut (2,2) is at (2,2), which is left and down.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,6), I can go to (3,5) or (4,6), etc.\n\nBut let's consider the time.\n\n(2,2) must be eaten by turn 41, so we have from turn 38 to 41 to eat it, 4 turns including turn 38? Turn 38,39,40,41.\n\nTurn 41 is the last chance.\n\nSimilarly, other food has more time.\n\nBut (2,2) is the most urgent.\n\nNow, to reach (2,2) from current position (2,6) on turn 38.\n\nBut (2,6) to (2,2) is 4 steps down, but (2,4) is wall, so cannot go directly.\n\nMust go around.\n\nPossible paths: for example, from (2,6) go to (3,6), then to (3,5), then to (3,4)? (3,4) is not wall, internal obstacles: (2,4) is wall, but (3,4) is not listed, so free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — so (3,4) is free.\n\nThen from (3,4) to (3,3), but (3,3) may be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 37, if I go Right to (3,6) on turn 38, snake at (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n\n(3,3) is the tail.\n\nThen from (3,6), I can go Down to (3,5).\n\nThen to (3,4), then to (3,3), but (3,3) is currently tail, but when I move, it might be different.\n\nLet's simulate turn by turn.\n\nFirst, for turn 37, I have no choice, must move Right to (2,6).\n\nSo turn 37: R\n\nNow turn 38: from (2,6), I can go Down to (2,5) or Right to (3,6).\n\nI need to go towards (2,2).\n\nIf I go Down to (2,5), then as before, only can go Right to (3,5) on next turn.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,5), what can I do?\n\nHead at (3,5), direction from moving Right, so R.\n\nThen possible moves: U, D, L, R, no reverse so no Left.\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- Up: (3,6) - occupied? After moving to (3,5), let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 38: if from (2,6) Down to (2,5), snake: head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)  -- tail (4,3) gone.\n\nThen on turn 39, from (2,5), move to (3,5) (only choice), head to (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)  -- (3,3) gone, new tail (2,3)? Snake segments: after move, head (3,5), then previous head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)\n\nSo positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)]\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\nDirection: moved Right to (3,5), so direction R.\n\nNow from (3,5), adjacent:\n\n- Up: (3,6) - occupied by body (2,6)? Body has (2,6), which is (3,5) to (3,6)? (3,6) is at x=3,y=6.\n\nBody positions: (2,5), (2,6), etc. (2,6) is at (2,6), not (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is not occupied; in the list, (2,6) is at (2,6), (3,5) is head, (2,5) is next, then (2,6) at (2,6), so (3,6) is free.\n\nIs (3,6) wall? No, not border, not internal obstacle.\n\nSo (3,6) is free.\n\n- Down: (3,4) - free\n\n- Left: (2,5) - occupied by body, snake[1], collision, invalid\n\n- Right: (4,5) - free\n\nAlso, cannot move Left because opposite direction? Current direction R, moving Left is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible: Up to (3,6), Down to (3,4), Right to (4,5).\n\nNow, (2,2) is at (2,2), which is down and left from (3,5).\n\nFrom here, I can go Down to (3,4), then to (3,3), but (3,3) may be occupied or not.\n\nIn current positions, (2,3) is occupied, but (3,3) is not in positions; last is (2,3) at (2,3), so (3,3) is free? Positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)] so (3,3) not occupied.\n\nBut (2,3) has food under it, but not eaten yet.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go Down to (3,4), then I can go to (3,3) or (4,4) etc.\n\n(3,3) is free, so I can go to (3,3) on turn 40 if I go down.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nBack to turn 38 choice.\n\nIf on turn 38 from (2,6) I go Right to (3,6).\n\nThen head to (3,6), snake: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]  -- tail (4,3) gone.\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen on turn 39, from (3,6), can go Down to (3,5) or Right to (4,6).\n\nSay go Down to (3,5).\n\nThen head to (3,5), body: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)  -- (3,3) gone, new positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)]\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\nDirection D (down).\n\nThen from (3,5), can go U, D, L, R, no reverse, so cannot move Up.\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- Up: (3,6) occupied by body, invalid\n\n- Down: (3,4) free\n\n- Left: (2,5) free? (2,5) not occupied, not wall\n\n- Right: (4,5) free\n\nSo can go Down, Left, or Right.\n\nNow, to reach (2,2), from (3,5), going Left to (2,5), then from (2,5), as before, only can go Right to (3,5) but that's back, or other.\n\nFrom (2,5), as I had earlier, only Right to (3,5) because Up, Down, Left invalid.\n\nIn this path, if I go to (2,5) from (3,5), it might be possible.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,2).\n\nPosition (2,2) is at (2,2).\n\nFrom current, how to get there.\n\nOne way: from (2,6) on turn 38, go Down to (2,5), then to (3,5) on turn 39, then from (3,5) go Down to (3,4) on turn 40, then from (3,4) go Left to (2,4)? But (2,4) is wall, cannot.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so cannot go to (2,4).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (3,3) or (4,4), etc.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), so I need to go to (2,3) or (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle? Internal obstacles include (1,2), so (1,2) is wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2) is listed, so (1,2) is wall.\n\nAlso (2,4) wall.\n\nSo around (2,2), possible accesses: from above (2,3), from left (1,2) but wall, from right (3,2), from below (2,1) but y=1, not wall yet, but borders y=0 is wall, y=1 is not border wall, but may have obstacles.\n\nBorders only x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,1) is free unless obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), but not (2,1), so (2,1) free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) free.\n\nBut (2,3) has food under snake body.\n\nTo eat (2,2), I can go to (2,2) from (2,3) or (3,2) or (2,1), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) is occupied.\n\nFirst, let's free (2,3) or go around.\n\nSince time is short for (2,2), I should prioritize getting to it.\n\nFrom (2,6) on turn 38, if I go Down to (2,5), then to (3,5) on turn 39, then on turn 40 from (3,5) I can go Down to (3,4), then on turn 41 from (3,4) I can go Down to (3,3), but (3,3) may be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 39: if on turn 38 Down to (2,5), turn 39 Right to (3,5), positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)]\n\nOn turn 40, from (3,5) go Down to (3,4), head to (3,4), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  -- (2,3) gone, new tail (1,3)? Positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nTail at (1,3).\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen on turn 41, from (3,4), can go U, D, L, R.\n\nNo reverse, direction D, so cannot move Up.\n\nAdjacent:\n\n- Up: (3,5) occupied, invalid\n\n- Down: (3,3) free\n\n- Left: (2,4) wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (4,4) free\n\nSo can go Down to (3,3) or Right to (4,4).\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is adjacent to (2,3) or (3,2) or (2,1).\n\nFrom (3,4), if I go Down to (3,3), then I am at (3,3), and (2,2) is at (2,2), which is not adjacent; (3,3) to (2,2) is not adjacent, need to move left or down, but left to (2,3) or down to (3,2).\n\n(2,3) might be free now? In current positions, (2,3) is not occupied; positions have (1,3) at (1,3), so (2,3) is free, but it has food under it.\n\nOn turn 41, from (3,3), I can go to (2,3) or (3,2) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) has food, so if I go to (2,3), I can eat the food there, but we want (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is separate.\n\nFrom (3,3), to go to (2,2), I need to go to (2,3) or (3,2) first.\n\nIf I go to (2,3) on turn 42, but (2,2) disappears after turn 41, so on turn 41 is last chance to eat (2,2).\n\nOn turn 41, I am at (3,4), and (2,2) is at (2,2), not adjacent; distance is 2 cells away, so I cannot reach it in one move from (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,4) to (2,2) is not adjacent; |dx|=1, |dy|=2, so not adjacent, I need two moves.\n\nBut on turn 41, I can only move to adjacent cells, so I cannot reach (2,2) on turn 41 from this position.\n\nIn this path, by turn 41, I am at (3,4) or (4,4), not near (2,2).\n\nIf on turn 40 from (3,5) I go Left to (2,5)? But from (3,5), moving Left is allowed only if not opposite, but direction is R, moving Left is opposite, not allowed.\n\nFrom (3,5) direction R, cannot move Left.\n\nOnly Down, Up, or Right, but Up to (3,6) or Down to (3,4) or Right to (4,5).\n\nNone gets me closer to (2,2) directly.\n\nFrom (3,5) go Down to (3,4), then as above.\n\nSo in this path, I cannot reach (2,2) by turn 41.\n\nNow, the other choice on turn 38: from (2,6) go Right to (3,6).\n\nThen on turn 39, from (3,6) go Down to (3,5).\n\nThen on turn 40 from (3,5) go Down to (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 41 from (3,4) same as above, at (3,4), can go to (3,3) or (4,4), not to (2,2).\n\nStill not close.\n\nBut I have another option: on turn 39 from (3,6), instead of going Down, I can go Right to (4,6).\n\nBut that might be worse.\n\nOr on turn 40 from (3,5), I can go Left if possible, but not.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, on turn 38, I should not go Down but go Right to (3,6), but that seems similar.\n\nAnother idea: to reach (2,2), I need to go via the right or bottom.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) go to (3,6) on turn 38, then to (4,6) on turn 39, then to (4,5) on turn 40, then to (4,4) but (4,4) may be occupied or not.\n\nBut (4,4) was tail earlier, but now different.\n\nPositions after turn 38 Right to (3,6): snake [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nOn turn 39, go Right to (4,6), head to (4,6), body: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)  -- (3,3) gone, positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)]\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen on turn 40, from (4,6), can go U, D, L, R, no reverse, so no Left.\n\n- Up: (4,7) wall\n\n- Down: (4,5) free\n\n- Left: (3,6) occupied, invalid\n\n- Right: (5,6) free\n\nSo Down or Right.\n\nSay go Down to (4,5).\n\nHead to (4,5), body: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  -- (2,3) gone, positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nTail at (1,3).\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen on turn 41, from (4,5), can go U, D, L, R.\n\nNo reverse, direction D, so no Up.\n\n- Up: (4,6) occupied, invalid\n\n- Down: (4,4) free? Not wall, not occupied\n\n- Left: (3,5) free\n\n- Right: (5,5) free\n\nSo can go Down, Left, or Right.\n\n(2,2) is far away at (2,2), not reachable.\n\nSo in both cases, I cannot reach (2,2) by turn 41 with the current paths.\n\nBut is there a way?\n\nPerhaps on turn 38 from (2,6) go Down to (2,5), then on turn 39 to (3,5), then on turn 40 from (3,5) go Down to (3,4), then on turn 41 from (3,4) go to (3,3), but (3,3) is not (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,3) on turn 42, (2,2) is gone.\n\nTurn 41 last chance.\n\nFrom (3,4) on turn 41, I am at (3,4), and (2,2) is at (2,2), which is two cells away, so I can't move there directly.\n\nUnless I can be at (2,3) or (2,1) or (3,2) on turn 41.\n\nBut (2,3) is occupied until recently.\n\nIn the positions, on turn 40, in the first path, after turn 39 to (3,5), positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)] so (2,3) is occupied.\n\nOn turn 40, if I go to (3,4), positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] so (2,3) is free now? (2,3) not in positions, and it has food.\n\nBut (2,2) is at (2,2), which is below (2,3).\n\nOn turn 41, from (3,4), I am at (3,4), not at (2,3).\n\nIf I could be at (2,3) on turn 41, then from there I can go down to (2,2) on turn 42, but turn 41 is last for (2,2), so on turn 41 I need to be at (2,2) or move to it.\n\nSo I need to be at (2,2) on turn 41.\n\nTo be at (2,2) on turn 41, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 40, like (2,3), (2,1), (1,2), (3,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, wall.\n\n(2,1) is possible, or (3,2), or (2,3).\n\n(2,3) might be free by turn 40.\n\nLet's see when (2,3) is vacated.\n\nCurrent on turn 37, after move, (2,3) is occupied.\n\nOn turn 38, if I move from (2,6) to (2,5), then positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) -- (2,3) still occupied.\n\nOn turn 39, move to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) -- (2,3) occupied.\n\nOn turn 40, move to (3,4), positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) -- (2,3) is gone, so on turn 40, (2,3) is free.\n\nOn turn 40, positions have (1,3) at (1,3), so (2,3) is free and has food.\n\nBut I am at (3,4) on turn 40.\n\nFrom (3,4) on turn 40, I can move to (2,4), but (2,4) is wall, cannot.\n\nOr to (3,3), or to (4,4).\n\nNot to (2,3).\n\n(3,4) to (2,3) is not adjacent; |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so it is adjacent diagonally? No, in grid, only orthogonal moves, not diagonal.\n\nSo adjacent cells are up, down, left, right.\n\n(3,4) to (2,3) is not adjacent; it's diagonal, so not a direct move.\n\nI can only move to (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4), but (2,4) wall, (3,5) may be occupied or not.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move to (3,3) or (4,4) or (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied by body in the positions.\n\nIn turn 40 positions, (3,5) is occupied by the segment behind head.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can only move to (3,3) or (4,4) on turn 41.\n\nNeither is (2,3) or (2,2).\n\nSo I cannot reach (2,2) by turn 41.\n\nSimilarly for other paths.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (2,2) because of the obstacle at (2,4) blocking the direct path, and the snake position makes it too far with the turns left.\n\n(2,2) life span 5 on turn 37, so must be eaten by turn 41.\n\nFrom turn 37 position (1,6), I moved to (2,6) on turn 37.\n\nOn turn 38, from (2,6), I can only go to (2,5) or (3,6), both are at y=5 or 6.\n\nFrom there, in two moves, by turn 40, I can be at most at y=4, like (3,4), but (2,2) is at y=2, so at least two moves away on turn 40, but on turn 41 I can move to it if adjacent, but from (3,4) to (2,2) not adjacent, from (3,4) to (2,3) not adjacent, so no, I cannot be adjacent to (2,2) on turn 40 to move on turn 41.\n\nFor example, if on turn 40 I were at (2,3), then on turn 41 I could go down to (2,2).\n\nOr at (3,2), go left to (2,2).\n\nBut to be at (2,3) on turn 40, from turn 38.\n\nOn turn 38, I am at (2,6) or (3,6).\n\nTo reach (2,3) by turn 40, that's two moves, but from (2,6) to (2,3) is 3 steps down, but (2,4) wall, so impossible directly.\n\nVia other cells: from (2,6) to (2,5) turn 38, then to (3,5) turn 39, then to (3,4) turn 40, at (3,4), not (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,6) to (3,6) turn 38, to (3,5) turn 39, to (3,4) or (2,5) but from (3,5) cannot go to (2,5) because not adjacent or opposite direction.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to eat (2,2) within the turns, so I should forget about it and focus on other food and survival.\n\n(2,2) will disappear, so I can ignore it.\n\nNow, other food: (2,3) with life span 7 on turn 37, so after turn 37:6, must be eaten by turn 43.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) with life span 10 on turn 37, after turn 37:9, must be eaten by turn 46.\n\nBoth are under snake body currently.\n\nTo eat them, I need to move the snake so that those cells are vacated and then head moves there.\n\nFor example, (2,3) is currently occupied; in after turn 37 positions, (2,3) is occupied.\n\nIt will be vacated when the tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly for (1,3).\n\nThe tail is at (4,3) after turn 37.\n\nAfter move to (2,6), tail at (4,3).\n\nAs the snake moves, the tail will move.\n\nFor example, if I move, on turn 38, if I go to (2,5), tail moves to (4,3)? After move to (2,5), positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)] so tail at (3,3), (4,3) gone.\n\n(2,3) still occupied.\n\nOn turn 39, move to (3,5), positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)] tail at (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is tail, but it has food under it.\n\nIf I move the head such that I move to (2,3) when it is not the tail or something.\n\nBut the rules: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nOtherwise, if I move to a cell with food, I eat it, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nFor (2,3), if it is the tail and has food, if I eat it, since it's the tail, and I move there, head moves to tail position, but tail would have moved if not eaten, but since I eat, tail stays, so head and tail are at same position, collision.\n\nBut in general, if I move to a food cell, I eat it, snake grows by one segment, so the tail does not move; the new segment is added at the head position after move.\n\nSo if I move to a cell that was the tail, and it has food, after eating, the head is there, and the tail is still there, so they are at the same cell, collision, death.\n\nBut if the cell is not the tail, but has food, I eat it, grow, no problem.\n\nFor (2,3), if it is not the tail when I move there, I can eat it safely.\n\nSimilarly for (1,3).\n\nSo I need to eat it when it is vacated and not the tail.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 40, in the first path, (2,3) is the tail on turn 39 and earlier, but on turn 40, when I move to (3,4), (2,3) is no longer occupied, it is free with food.\n\nOn turn 40, positions after move to (3,4): [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] so (2,3) is free.\n\nSo the food at (2,3) is now exposed and can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is still occupied.\n\nTo eat (2,3), I need to move the head to (2,3) when it is free.\n\nOn turn 40, I am at (3,4), and (2,3) is at (2,3), which is adjacent? (3,4) to (2,3) is not orthogonal adjacent; it's diagonal.\n\nOrthogonal adjacent would be (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4).\n\n(2,3) is at x=2,y=3, (3,4) is x=3,y=4, so dx=1, dy=1, not adjacent for move; I can only move to (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4), but (2,4) wall, (3,5) occupied, so only (3,3) or (4,4).\n\nNot to (2,3).\n\nSo I cannot move directly to (2,3) from (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (3,3) on turn 41, then from (3,3) to (2,3) on turn 42.\n\nOn turn 42, (2,3) is free, so I can move to (2,3) and eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) life span after turn 37:6, turn 38:5, turn 39:4, turn 40:3, turn 41:2, turn 42:1, so on turn 42 it is still there, life span 1, so can be eaten on turn 42.\n\nDisappears after turn 42, not available turn 43.\n\nSo on turn 42, I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,3), it will be vacated later.\n\nBut let's plan the moves.\n\nFirst, for turn 37, only choice is R to (2,6).\n\nTurn 37: R\n\nNow for turn 38, I have two choices: Down to (2,5) or Right to (3,6).\n\nIf I go Down to (2,5), then on turn 39, only choice is Right to (3,5).\n\nThen on turn 40, from (3,5) I can go Down to (3,4) or Up to (3,6) or Right to (4,5).\n\nTo set up for eating (2,3), I should go Down to (3,4) on turn 40.\n\nThen on turn 41, from (3,4) I can go Down to (3,3) or Right to (4,4).\n\nIf I go to (3,3) on turn 41, then on turn 42, from (3,3) I can go Left to (2,3) to eat the food.\n\n(2,3) should be free and have food.\n\nOn turn 42, (2,3) life span: original life span 7 on turn 37, after decreases: turn 38:6, 39:5, 40:4, 41:3, 42:2, so on turn 42, life span 2, still there.\n\nAfter eaten, it disappears.\n\nNow, when I move to (2,3) on turn 42, I eat the food, snake grows, so new head at (2,3), and the tail does not move, so length increases by 1.\n\nBut I need to make sure it's safe.\n\nOn turn 41, I am at (3,4), go Down to (3,3), which is free.\n\nThen on turn 42, from (3,3) go Left to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is free and has food, so I move there, eat it, snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head to (2,3), then body: the previous head (3,3), and the rest, and tail stays, so new segment added.\n\nBefore move, on turn 41, after moving to (3,3), positions: let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 40: at (3,4), positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nOn turn 41, move Down to (3,3), head to (3,3), body: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  -- (1,3) gone, new positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]\n\nTail at (1,4).\n\nThen on turn 42, move Left to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is free and has food, so head moves to (2,3), eats food, so snake grows: new head at (2,3), body: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) and new segment, so tail is (1,4), but since growth, the tail doesn't move, so positions: [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] length 9.\n\nAnd (1,3) is still occupied? In positions, (1,4) is tail, (1,3) is not there, but (1,3) has food under it, but not eaten yet.\n\nNow, for the other choice on turn 38.\n\nIf on turn 38 I go Right to (3,6), then similar.\n\nTurn 38: R to (3,6)\n\nTurn 39: say go Down to (3,5)\n\nTurn 40: go Down to (3,4)\n\nTurn 41: go to (3,3) or other\n\nThen turn 42: go to (2,3)\n\nSame as above.\n\nIn both cases, I can reach (2,3) on turn 42 to eat it.\n\nNow for (1,3), it has more time, life span 10 on turn 37, after decreases, on turn 42 it will be life span 5 (turn 37:10, 38:9, 39:8, 40:7, 41:6, 42:5), so plenty of time.\n\n(1,3) is currently occupied, and in the positions, it is vacated when the tail moves away.\n\nIn the sequence above, on turn 42, (1,3) is not occupied; in positions after turn 41, we have (1,4) tail, (1,5), etc., so (1,3) is free with food.\n\nI can plan to eat it later.\n\nBut for now, let's output the sequence.\n\nAlso, I need to think about survival and other moves.\n\nBut first, for turn 37, only R.\n\nFor turn 38, I can choose Down or Right.\n\nIf I go Down to (2,5), then on turn 39 I must go Right to (3,5), no choice.\n\nThen on turn 40, I can go Down to (3,4) or other, but to set up for (2,3), Down to (3,4) is good.\n\nIf I go Right to (3,6) on turn 38, then on turn 39 I can go Down to (3,5) or Right to (4,6).\n\nIf I go to (4,6), it might be harder to come back.\n\nSo better to go Down on turn 39.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nSo both paths similar, but going Down on turn 38 might be better to be closer.\n\nTurn 38: from (2,6) go Down to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 39: Right to (3,5)\n\nTurn 40: Down to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 41: from (3,4) go Down to (3,3) or Right to (4,4).\n\nIf I go to (4,4), then on turn 42 I can go Left to (3,4) or Down to (4,3), but not directly to (2,3).\n\nFrom (4,4) to (2,3) not adjacent.\n\nSo to eat (2,3) on turn 42, I need to be at (3,3) or (2,4) or (1,3) or (3,2), but (2,4) wall, (1,3) may be, but from (3,4) on turn 41, better to go Down to (3,3) to be adjacent to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 42 go Left to (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (4,4) on turn 41, I am not adjacent to (2,3).\n\nSo I should go to (3,3) on turn 41.\n\nThen turn 42 to (2,3).\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output from turn 37 to at least 5 turns ahead, say to turn 42.\n\nTurn 37: R\n\nTurn 38: D (down) to (2,5)  // assuming I choose D\n\nThen turn 39: R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 40: D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 41: D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 42: L to (2,3) to eat food\n\nBut on turn 42, I eat (2,3).\n\nIn the answer format, I need to specify the actions, not the positions.\n\nAlso, for turn 38, if I go Right, it might work too, but let's stick with Down.\n\nTo avoid potential risks.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 41, when I go to (3,3), is it safe?\n\nAfter turn 40: at (3,4), positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nGo Down to (3,3), (3,3) is free, so ok.\n\nThen turn 42, go Left to (2,3), (2,3) is free and has food, so eat.\n\nNow, after that, I can think about (1,3).\n\nBut for the sequence, since I need to output multiple turns, let's go to turn 42.\n\nThe current turn is 37, so output turns 37 to 42 or so.\n\nBut turn 42 is 5 turns ahead? Turn 37 to 38,39,40,41,42 is 5 steps: 37 to 38 (1), 38 to 39 (2), 39 to 40 (3), 40 to 41 (4), 41 to 42 (5), so 5 turns ahead from turn 37.\n\nTurn 37 action, then 38,39,40,41,42 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nNow for turn 38, I have a choice, but I think D or R both can lead to eating (2,3) on turn 42.\n\nBut to be consistent, let's choose D on turn 38.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 42, I can continue, but the output can stop at turn 42 for now.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify the sequence.\n\nAlso, for the food at (1,3), I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nAnother point: on turn 42, after eating (2,3), the snake grows, and (1,3) is free with food, so I can go to (1,3) next if possible.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nFirst, output for turns 37 to 42.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 37: R\n\nTurn 38: D\n\nTurn 39: R\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: D\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nBut on turn 39, from (2,5) to (3,5), that's R.\n\nOn turn 40, from (3,5) to (3,4), D.\n\nTurn 41, (3,4) to (3,3), D.\n\nTurn 42, (3,3) to (2,3), L.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I had gone R on turn 38:\n\nTurn 38: R to (3,6)\n\nThen turn 39: D to (3,5)\n\nTurn 40: D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 41: D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 42: L to (2,3)\n\nSame as above, but starting from different point.\n\nIn both cases, turn 40 to 42 are the same.\n\nBut on turn 38, if I go R, I am at (3,6), then to (3,5), same as if I went D then R to (3,5).\n\nBut from (2,5) to (3,5) is one step, from (3,6) to (3,5) is down.\n\nBut eventually similar.\n\nI think either is fine, but since on turn 38, (2,5) is closer to the bottom, might be better for future.\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, about the head direction: for example, on turn 37, move R, direction R.\n\nTurn 38, move D, so direction D.\n\nTurn 39, move R, from (2,5) to (3,5), so direction R.\n\nTurn 40, move D to (3,4), direction D.\n\nTurn 41, move D to (3,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 42, move L to (2,3), but L is left, while direction was D, moving left is not opposite to down, so allowed. Opposite of down is up, left is perpendicular, so ok.\n\nNo problem.\n\nAfter eating (2,3) on turn 42, I am at (2,3), and (1,3) is adjacent to the left, and it has food, so I can go Left to (1,3) on turn 43 to eat it.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nOn turn 42, after move to (2,3) and eat, positions: head at (2,3), body: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail.\n\n(1,3) is free and has food.\n\nOn turn 43, from (2,3), I can move Left to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is adjacent, and has food, so I move there and eat, grow again.\n\nBut is there danger? Tail is at (1,4), which is below (1,3), so after moving to (1,3), head at (1,3), body: (2,3), (3,3), etc., and tail (1,4) stays, so head at (1,3), tail at (1,4), no collision.\n\nThen snake grows to 10 segments.\n\nBut we don't need to output beyond, but for survival.\n\nAlso, there might be other food, but only three given, and (2,2) expired.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nBut in the initial, (1,3) is also food under body, but we eat it later.\n\nNow for the sequence, I think turn 37 to 42 is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nAlso, in turn 41, I go to (3,3), which is fine.\n\nTo write the answer.\n\nBut in the food, (2,3) and (1,3) are both positive, so eating them increases score.\n\n(2,2) we miss, but unavoidable.\n\nSo I think this plan is ok.\n\nNow for the output.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, considering the food life spans, snake movement constraints, and collision risks. The current state (turn 37) has the snake head at (1,6) with direction Up. The only safe and legal move on turn 37 is Right (R) to (2,6), as Up and Left lead to walls, and Down is an illegal reverse move.\n\nFrom turn 38 onward, the plan focuses on eating the positive food at (2,3) by turn 42 (before its life span expires after turn 43). The food at (2,2) cannot be reached safely by turn 41 (its last chance to be eaten) due to the obstacle at (2,4) and the snake's starting position. The food at (1,3) has a longer life span (until turn 47) and will be addressed after turn 42.\n\nThe sequence below ensures the snake:\n- Moves to vacate (2,3) by turn 40.\n- Positions the head to eat (2,3) on turn 42.\n- Avoids walls, obstacles, and collisions.\n- Sets up for eating (1,3) on turn 43 (beyond the 5-turn plan but implied for long-term gain).\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 37 to 42)\n- **Turn 37: R (Right)** – Only legal move; avoids walls and collision. Head moves to (2,6), direction Right.\n- **Turn 38: D (Down)** – Moves to (2,5), avoiding walls and collision. Direction Down. (Alternative: Right to (3,6) also works but Down keeps the snake closer to the target food.)\n- **Turn 39: R (Right)** – From (2,5), only safe move; Left to (1,5) is collision, Up to (2,6) is collision, Down to (2,4) is wall. Head moves to (3,5), direction Right.\n- **Turn 40: D (Down)** – Moves to (3,4), avoiding walls and collision. Direction Down. (This vacates (2,3) and positions for the next move.)\n- **Turn 41: D (Down)** – Moves to (3,3), which is free. Direction Down. (Right to (4,4) is possible but less optimal; Down prepares for eating (2,3).)\n- **Turn 42: L (Left)** – Moves to (2,3), eating the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to 9 segments). (2,3) is free and safe to eat (not the tail). Direction Left.\n\n### Rationale for 5+ Turn Planning\n- **Food at (2,3)**: Life span 7 on turn 37 decreases to 2 by turn 42; eating it on turn 42 is timely. It is vacated by turn 40 and not the tail when eaten.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: All moves avoid walls (e.g., (2,4) obstacle), illegal reverses, and body collisions. On turn 42, eating (2,3) is safe because the tail is at (1,4), not adjacent to the head.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 42, the head can move to (1,3) on turn 43 to eat the remaining food (life span 5 on turn 42), further increasing score. The path avoids dead ends and maintains flexibility.\n- **Missed Food at (2,2)**: Unavoidable due to distance, obstacle at (2,4), and short life span; prioritizing (2,3) is better for score.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 37: R  \nTurn 38: D  \nTurn 39: R  \nTurn 40: D  \nTurn 41: D  \nTurn 42: L  \n}",

        "step": 38,
        "score": 7,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 38, and I'm playing Snake on a grid that seems to be 8x8 since the borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I need to avoid these cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,6), then body segments: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). So the snake is 8 segments long.\n\nHead direction is R, which is right. So currently moving east.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,2) with value 1 and life span 4\n\n- (2,3) with value 1 and life span 6\n\n- (1,3) with value 1 and life span 9\n\nAll food has value 1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned, but I should be cautious.\n\nLife span: for (2,2), it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn. So if not eaten by turn 41, it's gone. Similarly, (2,3) disappears after 6 turns, so by turn 43, and (1,3) after 9 turns, by turn 46.\n\nBut turn 38 is current, so for (2,2): life span 4 means it has 4 turns left, including turn 38. So if not eaten by turn 38, 39, 40, or 41, it vanishes. After turn 41, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) lasts until turn 43 (38+5=43? Let's calculate: from turn 38, with life span 4, it would be gone after turn 41. Life span N means it disappears after N turns, including current. So at the start of turn 38, it has N turns left, including this one.\n\nStandard: if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1. Let's think carefully.\n\nThe problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, life span N means:\n\n- After turn t, countdown to N-1\n\n- After turn t+1, countdown to N-2\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn t + N - 1, countdown to 0, and it disappears before turn t + N.\n\nSo it exists during turns t to t + N - 1.\n\nFor food at (2,2) with life span 4 at turn 38:\n\n- Available on turns 38, 39, 40, 41\n\n- Disappears before turn 42.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) life span 6: turns 38 to 43, disappears before 44.\n\n(1,3) life span 9: turns 38 to 46, disappears before 47.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,6), moving right (R). Current direction is R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) next turn.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's see the grid state.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for y=0 to7, (7,y) for y=0 to7, (x,0) for x=0 to7, (x,7) for x=0 to7. But since it's borders, we can't move there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nFood at: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3)\n\n(1,3) has food, but (1,3) is also part of the snake body? Snake positions include (1,3), which is the 5th segment? Let's list snake segments with indices.\n\nSnake: head (0): (2,6)\n\nSegment 1: (1,6)\n\nSegment 2: (1,5)\n\nSegment 3: (1,4)\n\nSegment 4: (1,3)\n\nSegment 5: (2,3)\n\nSegment 6: (3,3)\n\nSegment 7: (4,3) tail\n\nNow, food is at (2,2), (2,3), and (1,3).\n\n(2,3) has food, but (2,3) is also segment 5 of the snake.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) has food and is segment 4.\n\nBut according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n\nSo for (2,3), it's occupied by the snake body, so I can't eat it now. I need to move the snake so that the body leaves (2,3), and then head moves to it.\n\nSimilarly for (1,3).\n\nAlso, (2,2) is free, no snake or obstacle, I think.\n\nCheck if (2,2) is occupied.\n\nWalls: not at (2,2)\n\nObstacles: internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,2) is an obstacle, but (2,2) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nSnake positions: all listed, (2,2) not there, so free.\n\nFood: (2,2) is food, so it's there.\n\nNow, head at (2,6), moving right.\n\nPossible moves from (2,6):\n\n- U: (2,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid, collision.\n\n- D: (2,5) — is this free? Let's see.\n\n(2,5): not a wall, not an obstacle? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4), which is a wall cell.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n\nSo (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall cell, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is obstacle.\n\nNow, (2,5): not listed in walls or obstacles, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: all y-coordinates are 6,5,4,3,3,3,3; no (2,5). So (2,5) should be free.\n\nBut is it within bounds? x=2, y=5, between 0 and 7, yes.\n\n- L: left to (1,6). But (1,6) is segment 1 of snake. Now, moving to a body segment: generally, if I move to a body segment, it might be collision, but there's an exception for the tail.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (4,3).\n\nIf I move left to (1,6), which is segment 1, not tail, so it's a body collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, R: right to (3,6). Is (3,6) free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake: no (3,6), positions are all x=1,2,3,4 but y=6,5,4,3; (3,6) not occupied, so free.\n\nD: down to (2,5), as above.\n\nU: (2,7) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,5), R to (3,6), and L is invalid because opposite direction? No, L is left to (1,6), which is body, so invalid collision.\n\nBut direction: current head direction is R, so I cannot move L instantly, but even if I could, (1,6) is body, so not possible.\n\nSo only possible moves: D or R.\n\nD: (2,5)\n\nR: (3,6)\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), but (2,3) and (1,3) are under snake body now.\n\n(2,2) is free, so I could potentially eat it if I go down.\n\nBut let's see the paths.\n\nFirst, if I move D to (2,5), then head at (2,5).\n\nThen next turn, from (2,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction would be D (since I just moved down), so cannot move U (up) next turn.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (3,6), direction R, then cannot move L next.\n\nNow, I need to consider the food.\n\n(2,2) has short life, only until turn 41, so 4 turns including now. Turn 38, so I have until turn 41 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) until turn 43, (1,3) until turn 46.\n\nBut (2,3) and (1,3) are under body, so I need to free them first.\n\nAlso, there is a danger with tail reward: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nTail is at (4,3).\n\nNow, let's think about possible sequences.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (2,5) on turn 38.\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5): U, D, L, R, but cannot U (since just moved D), so can D, L, R.\n\n- D to (2,4): but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\n- L to (1,5): (1,5) is segment 2 of snake. Is it body? Snake segments: after move to (2,5), the snake will be: head at (2,5), then body: previous head (2,6) becomes segment 1, then (1,6) segment 2, (1,5) segment 3, (1,4) segment 4, (1,3) segment 5, (2,3) segment 6, (3,3) segment 7, tail (4,3) segment 8? Let's list new positions after move.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the segment before it, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nNo food eaten now, so tail moves away.\n\nAfter moving D to (2,5):\n\n- New head: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 1: (2,6)  // previous head\n\n- Segment 2: (1,6)  // previous segment 1\n\n- Segment 3: (1,5)  // previous segment 2\n\n- Segment 4: (1,4)  // previous segment 3\n\n- Segment 5: (1,3)  // previous segment 4\n\n- Segment 6: (2,3)  // previous segment 5\n\n- Segment 7: (3,3)  // previous segment 6\n\n- Tail was (4,3), but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so segments are (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) — that's 8 segments? Original was 8 positions, after move, head to (2,5), and tail removed, so 7 segments.\n\nSnake positions after move: head to new cell, each body segment to the previous position of the segment in front, so the last segment (tail) is not occupied anymore unless food.\n\nSpecifically: positions list: after moving to (2,5), the new positions are:\n\n- Head: (2,5)\n\n- Then the previous positions of the body segments except the tail is removed.\n\nOriginal positions: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (2,5), the body segments take the positions: (2,6) becomes segment 1, (1,6) segment 2, (1,5) segment 3, (1,4) segment 4, (1,3) segment 5, (2,3) segment 6, (3,3) segment 7. The tail (4,3) is removed, so no segment there.\n\nSo new snake: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nNow, tail is (3,3).\n\nFood at (1,3) and (2,3) are still under body segments: (1,3) is segment 5, (2,3) is segment 6.\n\n(2,2) is free food.\n\nBack to moves from (2,5):\n\n- D: (2,4) - but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\n- L: (1,5) - (1,5) is segment 3 of snake, which is body, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n\n- R: (3,5) - is (3,5) free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake: snake positions above, no (3,5), so free.\n\n- U: (2,6) - but (2,6) is segment 1 of snake, body, not tail, so collision, invalid. Also, cannot U because just moved D, but even if, it's occupied.\n\nSo only possible move from (2,5) is R to (3,5).\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction R (since moved right? From (2,5) to (3,5) is right, so direction R.\n\nThen next turn, from (3,5), possible moves.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; this is one path.\n\nFirst, back to turn 38 choice.\n\nOption 2: Move R to (3,6) on turn 38.\n\nHead to (3,6), direction R.\n\nThen snake positions after move: head (3,6), then (2,6) seg1, (1,6) seg2, (1,5) seg3, (1,4) seg4, (1,3) seg5, (2,3) seg6, (3,3) seg7. Tail (4,3) removed.\n\nSo snake: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nTail at (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,6), direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (3,5) - free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so free\n\n- L: (2,6) - but (2,6) is segment 1, body, collision, invalid\n\n- R: (4,6) - is it free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so free\n\nSo possible: D to (3,5) or R to (4,6)\n\nNow, I need to think about accessing food.\n\nFood at (2,2) is south, at (2,3) and (1,3) are under body.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is below.\n\nFrom current position (2,6), if I go down to (2,5), then I must go right to (3,5), as above.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) or other directions.\n\n(3,4) is free, I think.\n\nThen to (3,3)? But (3,3) is the tail in some cases, but it will move.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (3,6) first, then to (3,5) or (4,6).\n\nBut (2,2) is at low y, so I need to go down.\n\nAlso, (2,3) has food under body, but it's at (2,3), which is currently segment 6 in the list, but after moves, it will be freed when the snake moves.\n\nSimilarly for (1,3).\n\nLife span: (2,2) only until turn 41, so I have 4 turns to eat it: turn 38,39,40,41.\n\nTurn 38 is now, so if I don't eat it now, I have turns 39,40,41 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, others have more time.\n\nSo (2,2) is urgent.\n\nHow to reach (2,2) from current position.\n\nFrom (2,6), if I go D to (2,5), then only move is R to (3,5), as above.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go D to (3,4), or L to (2,5) but (2,5) is body after move? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5) from (2,5), snake positions: head (3,5), then (2,5) seg1, (2,6) seg2, (1,6) seg3, (1,5) seg4, (1,4) seg5, (1,3) seg6, (2,3) seg7. Tail was (3,3) removed? After first move to (2,5), tail was (3,3), removed, so from (3,5), positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)]\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\nNow from (3,5), direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,6) - but (3,6) is not occupied? In positions, (2,6) is there, but (3,6) not in list, so free? (3,6) is at x=3,y=6, not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions above, so free.\n\n- D: (3,4) - free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so free.\n\n- L: (2,5) - but (2,5) is segment 1, body, collision, invalid\n\n- R: (4,5) - free, I assume.\n\nAlso, cannot L because direction R.\n\nSo U, D, R possible.\n\nIf I go D to (3,4), then head at (3,4), direction D.\n\nThen I can go to (3,3)? But (3,3) is not occupied now? In positions, (2,3) is tail, but (3,3) was removed earlier.\n\nAfter above, from (3,5) to (3,4), snake: head (3,4), then (3,5) seg1, (2,5) seg2, (2,6) seg3, (1,6) seg4, (1,5) seg5, (1,4) seg6, (1,3) seg7. Tail (2,3) removed? After move to (3,4), no food, tail removed, so segments: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — and (2,3) removed, so tail is (1,3).\n\n(1,3) has food, but it's under body.\n\nNow from (3,4), I can go to (3,3) or other.\n\n(3,3) is free, I think.\n\nThen to (3,2) or (2,3), etc.\n\nBut I want to reach (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,4), go to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (2,2)? (3,2) to (2,2) is left.\n\nBut let's see if (3,3) is free: at this point, after moving to (3,4), positions as above, (3,3) not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) should be free.\n\nThen (2,2) is food.\n\nBut from (3,2) to (2,2) is left, possible.\n\nNow, how many turns to reach (2,2) from start.\n\nTurn 38: move D to (2,5)\n\nTurn 39: move R to (3,5)  // only choice\n\nTurn 40: move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 41: move D to (3,3)  // if I do that\n\nThen turn 42: move D to (3,2)  // but (3,2) is free? Not wall, not obstacle, obstacle at (1,2) but not (3,2), so free.\n\nThen turn 43: move L to (2,2) to eat.\n\nBut (2,2) life span 4, available until turn 41, so on turn 42 it is gone, so I cannot eat it on turn 43, too late.\n\nTurn 41 is the last chance to eat (2,2).\n\nOn turn 41, where am I?\n\nFrom above: turn 40 at (3,4), move to (3,3) on turn 41? But (3,3) is not (2,2).\n\nI need to be at (2,2) on or before turn 41.\n\nFrom turn 40 at (3,4), I can move to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nMove to (4,4) or other, but not towards (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move L to (2,4) but obstacle, or U to (3,5) which is body, or R to (4,4), or D to (3,3).\n\nD to (3,3) is possible, but (3,3) is not (2,2).\n\nThen from (3,3) on turn 41, I can move to (2,3) or (3,2), etc, but (2,2) is gone after turn 41, so I need to eat on turn 41.\n\nOn turn 41, I need to be at (2,2).\n\nWhere am I on turn 40?\n\nIf on turn 38 at (2,5), turn 39 at (3,5), turn 40 at (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,4) on turn 40, I can move to (2,4) but obstacle, not possible.\n\nMove to (3,3) on turn 40? Turn 40 move from (3,4) to (3,3), but that's turn 40 action, so on turn 40 I am at (3,3) after move? Let's clarify turn sequence.\n\nTurn t: I choose action, move to new cell.\n\nAfter move, position is updated.\n\nFor turn 40, I start at some position, move to new cell.\n\nTo be at (2,2) on turn 41, I need to move to (2,2) during turn 41 action.\n\nSo on turn 41, I start from a cell adjacent to (2,2) and move to it.\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,2): (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2)\n\n(2,1): y=1, but y=0 is wall, so (2,1) is within bounds, not wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is ok.\n\nBut obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,2) cannot be moved to.\n\n(2,3) has food but is under snake or not?\n\n(3,2) is free.\n\n(2,1) is free, I think.\n\nSo to reach (2,2) on turn 41, on turn 40 I need to be at one of: (2,1), (2,3), or (3,2), since (1,2) obstacle.\n\nNow, from turn 40 position, if I am at (3,4) as above, I can move to (3,3) or (4,4) or (3,5) but (3,5) may be body.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 40, if I am at (3,4), I can move D to (3,3), then on turn 41 from (3,3) I can move to (3,2) or (2,3) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,2) is not directly accessible from (3,3); I need to be at (2,3) or (3,2) on turn 40 to move to (2,2) on turn 41.\n\nFor example, if on turn 40 I am at (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) on turn 41.\n\nSimilarly, if at (3,2), move L to (2,2).\n\nBut in the current path, on turn 40 I am at (3,4), which is not adjacent to (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can only move to (3,3), (4,4), or if possible (2,4) but obstacle, or (3,5) but body, so not to (2,3) or (3,2) directly.\n\nSo from (3,4) on turn 40, I can only be at (3,3) on turn 41, not at (2,2).\n\nSo I cannot reach (2,2) by turn 41 if I go down first.\n\nNow, what about the other option? Move R first on turn 38 to (3,6).\n\nThen on turn 39, from (3,6), I can move D to (3,5) or R to (4,6).\n\nSay move D to (3,5) on turn 39.\n\nThen on turn 40, from (3,5), direction D? From (3,6) to (3,5) is down, so direction D, cannot move U.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5), U to (3,6) but cannot U and (3,6) may be body.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5) from (3,6), snake positions: head (3,5), then (3,6) seg1, (2,6) seg2, (1,6) seg3, (1,5) seg4, (1,4) seg5, (1,3) seg6, (2,3) seg7. Tail (3,3) removed? After move to (3,6) on turn 38, tail was (3,3) removed, so on turn 39 to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), then (3,6) seg1, (2,6) seg2, (1,6) seg3, (1,5) seg4, (1,4) seg5, (1,3) seg6, (2,3) seg7. Tail (2,3)? Seg7 is (2,3), but after move, tail is removed, so segments: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and (2,3) removed? When moving head to (3,5), the body segments shift, so (3,6) becomes new segment 1, (2,6) segment 2, (1,6) segment 3, (1,5) segment 4, (1,4) segment 5, (1,3) segment 6, and the previous segment 7 (2,3) is removed since no food. So new tail is (1,3).\n\nPositions: [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nTail at (1,3).\n\nFrom (3,5), direction D (since moved down), so cannot move U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- D to (3,4) - free\n\n- L to (2,5) - free? (2,5) not occupied, so free\n\n- R to (4,5) - free\n\n- U to (3,6) - but (3,6) is segment 1, body, collision, invalid\n\nSo D, L, R possible.\n\nIf I want to reach (2,2), I can move L to (2,5) on turn 39.\n\nThen on turn 40 from (2,5), direction L (since moved left from (3,5) to (2,5)? From (3,5) to (2,5) is left, so direction L, cannot move R.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot R (opposite), so U, D, L.\n\n- U to (2,6) - but (2,6) is segment 2 in current snake? After moving to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), then (3,5) seg1, (3,6) seg2, (2,6) seg3, etc. (2,6) is occupied.\n\nSpecifically: from (2,5), new positions: head (2,5), then (3,5) seg1, (3,6) seg2, (2,6) seg3, (1,6) seg4, (1,5) seg5, (1,4) seg6, (1,3) seg7. Tail (1,3) removed? When moving to (2,5), the previous tail (1,3) is removed, so segments: (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — and (1,3) removed, so tail is (1,4).\n\nFrom (2,5), moves:\n\n- U to (2,6) - (2,6) is segment 3, body, collision, invalid\n\n- D to (2,4) - obstacle, invalid\n\n- L to (1,5) - (1,5) is segment 5, body, collision, invalid\n\n- R to (3,5) - (3,5) is segment 1, body, collision, invalid\n\nAll moves invalid? That can't be right.\n\nPositions: head at (2,5), body: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nSo cells occupied: (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,5):\n\n- U: (2,6) - occupied by body, collision\n\n- D: (2,4) - obstacle, wall\n\n- L: (1,5) - occupied by body (1,5 is in list), collision\n\n- R: (3,5) - occupied by body (3,5 is seg1), collision\n\nSo indeed, no possible moves from (2,5) if I go there on turn 39. Dead end, snake dies.\n\nTherefore, moving to (2,5) on turn 39 is fatal; I must avoid that.\n\nIn the sequence where I go R on turn 38 to (3,6), then on turn 39 I should not move to (2,5); instead, move D to (3,4) or R to (4,6).\n\nBut let's focus on eating (2,2) first.\n\nPerhaps I can't reach (2,2) in time from current position with the constraints.\n\nDistance: from (2,6) to (2,2) is 4 steps down, but there are obstacles and body in the way.\n\nDirectly down: (2,5) is free, but (2,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go straight down.\n\nI have to go around.\n\nFor example, go right to (3,6), then down to (3,5), then down to (3,4), then down to (3,3), etc, but as before, it takes more turns.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (3,6) turn 38, to (3,5) turn 39, to (3,4) turn 40, to (3,3) turn 41, then to (3,2) turn 42, too late for (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,4) on turn 40, I can move to (4,4) or other, not to (2,2).\n\nOr from (3,5) on turn 39, I could move L to (2,5), but as above, it leads to death on turn 40.\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat (2,2) because of the obstacle at (2,4) and the body positions.\n\nTherefore, I should abandon (2,2) and focus on other food or survival.\n\nBut there are other foods: (2,3) and (1,3) with longer life.\n\n(2,3) is under body, life until turn 43, (1,3) until turn 46.\n\nFirst, I need to free those cells.\n\nAlso, the snake is currently blocking access.\n\nNow, the tail is at (4,3), and will move as the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the tail moves away from (2,3) or (1,3), then I can eat the food.\n\nLet's list the current snake positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), tail (4,3)\n\nFood at (1,3) and (2,3) are occupied.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if I don't eat food, the tail moves, so the cell (4,3) is freed, but (1,3) and (2,3) are still occupied until the snake moves such that those segments are the tail and move away.\n\nFor example, (1,3) is segment 4, so when the snake moves 4 times without eating, (1,3) will be the tail and move away.\n\nSimilarly for (2,3), it's segment 5, so after 5 moves, it becomes tail and can move away.\n\nBut when it moves away, the food can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nAlso, there is the tail reward danger.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving to free the food.\n\nSince (2,2) is not reachable, I should ignore it for now.\n\nNow, possible moves on turn 38: D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf I go R to (3,6), then on turn 39, I can move D to (3,5) or R to (4,6).\n\nIf I go D to (3,5), then as before, on turn 40 I can move to (3,4) or other.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (3,3) but (3,3) may have something.\n\nLet's think about the food at (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is currently occupied, but when it becomes the tail and moves, it can be eaten.\n\nCurrently, (2,3) is segment 5 from head, so after 5 moves, it will be the tail, and on the next move, it moves away.\n\nSimilarly for (1,3), segment 4 from head.\n\nBut the head is moving, so the relative position changes.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate the snake movement.\n\nAlso, to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother idea: the area around y=3 is crowded with body, so I should move away to open space.\n\nFor example, go right to (3,6), then to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut there are internal obstacles, like (6,4), (5,1), etc, but at high y, it might be clear.\n\nLet's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls at borders.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nFree cells: need to find a path.\n\nCurrent head at (2,6), if I move R to (3,6), then I can go to (4,6), (5,6), etc, since no obstacles there.\n\n(5,6) is free, (6,6) but x=6, y=6, not wall, but internal obstacle at (6,4), not (6,6), so (6,6) free.\n\nThen (7,6) is x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo I can go to (4,6), (5,6), (6,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go down or left.\n\nBut food is at low y, so eventually I need to go down.\n\nFood at (2,3) and (1,3) will be freed when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, after a few moves, the tail will move, freeing cells.\n\nBut the food life span is long, so I can take time.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nAlso, avoid risky moves.\n\nFirst, let's choose a safe move for turn 38.\n\nOptions: D to (2,5) or R to (3,6)\n\nIf I go D to (2,5), then on turn 39 I must go R to (3,5), as earlier.\n\nThen on turn 40, from (3,5), I can go D to (3,4) or U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\n(3,6) may be body, but after moving to (3,5), positions: as before, (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) for turn 39? Let's define turns.\n\nTurn 38: move to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) — tail (3,3)\n\nOn turn 39, move to (3,5): head to (3,5), then body: (2,5) seg1, (2,6) seg2, (1,6) seg3, (1,5) seg4, (1,4) seg5, (1,3) seg6, (2,3) seg7. Tail (3,3) removed, so positions: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) — 8 segments? (2,3) is included, tail at (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,5), moves:\n\n- U to (3,6): (3,6) not occupied, free\n\n- D to (3,4): free\n\n- L to (2,5): occupied by seg1, collision\n\n- R to (4,5): free\n\nCannot L because direction R.\n\nSo U, D, R possible.\n\nIf I go D to (3,4), then head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail (1,3)\n\nThen from (3,4), can go to (3,3), (4,4), etc.\n\n(3,3) is free now, since tail moved.\n\n(3,3) was not occupied after previous move.\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,3) is still under body, segment 7 in previous, but now in this state, (2,3) is not occupied? In positions above, after move to (3,4), positions are (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — so (2,3) is free now, and it has food.\n\n(2,3) has food, and now it's free because the snake moved away from it.\n\nIn turn 39 positions, (2,3) was tail, and when we moved to (3,5), the tail (2,3) was removed, so (2,3) is free and has food.\n\nOn turn 39, after moving to (3,5), the cell (2,3) is free and has food.\n\nBut on turn 39, head is at (3,5), not adjacent to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), adjacent cells: (2,2), (2,4), (1,3), (3,3)\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, (1,3) is occupied by snake (seg6), (2,2) food, (3,3) is free.\n\nSo (2,3) is free but not adjacent to head.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move head to (2,3) when it is free.\n\nOn turn 40, from (3,5), I can move to (3,4) or (4,5) or (3,6).\n\nIf I move to (3,4), then head at (3,4), which is adjacent to (3,3), (3,5), (2,4) invalid, (4,4).\n\nNot adjacent to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), (3,4) is at (3,4), not adjacent; difference in both x and y.\n\nAdjacent means sharing edge, so (3,4) and (2,3) are not adjacent; diagonal doesn't count.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can move to (3,3), then from (3,3) to (2,3) or (3,2), etc.\n\nOn turn 40, from (3,5), if I move to (3,4), then on turn 41, from (3,4) I can move to (3,3), then to (2,3) on turn 42.\n\nBut (2,3) food life span until turn 43, so on turn 42 I can eat it if I move to (2,3).\n\nTurn 42 is within life span.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,3), it has longer life.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, for turn 38, if I choose D to (2,5), then turn 39 R to (3,5), then turn 40 D to (3,4), then turn 41 D to (3,3), then turn 42 L to (2,3) to eat food at (2,3).\n\nOn turn 42, move to (2,3), which has food, value 1, so snake grows.\n\nWhen I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nBut check if it's safe.\n\nOn turn 41, head at (3,3), move L to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is free on turn 41? Let's see the state before turn 42 action.\n\nOn turn 41, after moving to (3,3) on turn 41? Let's list positions turn by turn.\n\nAssume turn 38: move D to (2,5)\n\n- After turn 38: snake: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)  // tail (3,3)\n\nTurn 39: move R to (3,5)\n\n- Head to (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)  // tail (2,3) removed? When moving, tail (3,3) is removed, so positions: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  // 7 segments, tail (1,3)\n\n(2,3) is free now and has food.\n\nTurn 40: move D to (3,4)\n\n- Head to (3,4), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // tail (1,4) removed? Previous tail (1,3) removed, so positions: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // tail (1,4)\n\n(1,3) is free, has food.\n\nTurn 41: move D to (3,3)\n\n- Head to (3,3), body: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)  // tail (1,5) removed? Previous tail (1,4) removed, so positions: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)  // tail (1,5)\n\n(3,3) is new head position.\n\nNow, (2,3) is free and has food.\n\nTurn 42: move L to (2,3) to eat food.\n\n- Head to (2,3), which has food, so eat it, snake grows: new head (2,3), body: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) and tail not removed, so positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)  // 8 segments, tail (1,5)\n\nAnd food consumed.\n\nNow, is this safe? When moving to (2,3), it was free, no collision.\n\nAlso, no tail reward danger because tail is at (1,5), not adjacent.\n\nSo this seems possible.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to (1,3) later.\n\nBut (1,3) is also food, life until turn 46.\n\nNow, what about the other move: on turn 38 move R to (3,6).\n\nThen turn 39 move D to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 40 move D to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 41 move D to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 42 move L to (2,3) to eat.\n\nSimilar to above, but starting from right.\n\nIn this case, on turn 39 at (3,5), I could have other choices.\n\nBut both paths can reach (2,3) by turn 42.\n\nNow, for turn 38, which is better?\n\nIf I move D to (2,5) on turn 38, then I am closer to the food area.\n\nIf I move R to (3,6), I am going away, but can come back.\n\nBut since both can work, I need to see if there is a difference.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,3), which I can eat later.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAnother thing: internal obstacles, like (1,2) is obstacle, so I cannot go to (1,2).\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut in this case, not immediate.\n\nFor turn 38, moving D to (2,5) might be slightly better because it's moving towards the food.\n\nBut after that, I have to go right, so it's similar.\n\nPerhaps I should consider beyond 5 turns.\n\nBut for now, since I need to output actions for several turns, but the answer format is to list actions for turns starting from t1, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output actions for the next turns? The answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nBut I need to specify how many turns? It doesn't say, but probably for the immediate future, or until a decision point.\n\nSince it's a sequence, I should provide actions for the next few turns.\n\nBut let's see the core rules.\n\nI think for this response, I need to provide the actions for turn 38 and beyond.\n\nBut how many? Until it stabilizes or something.\n\nPerhaps I can provide 5 turns as an example.\n\nBut the problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" for the reasoning, but output the actions for the turns starting from current.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to list a sequence.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many, so I should provide enough to show the plan.\n\nSince the food (2,2) is expiring soon, but I decided not to go for it, so for (2,3), I can eat around turn 42.\n\nSimilarly, for the other option.\n\nBut let's choose a move for turn 38.\n\nPerhaps moving D is better because it starts the descent.\n\nMoving R keeps me at high y.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (2,3), I can go for (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is currently occupied, but in the sequence above, after eating (2,3), the snake is at positions like (2,3), (3,3), etc, and (1,3) is free but has food.\n\nIn the state after turn 42, (1,3) is free and has food.\n\nThen I can move to it.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), I can move L to (1,3) if possible.\n\nBut (1,3) is at (1,3), adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,4), (0,3), (2,3)\n\n(1,2) is obstacle, (0,3) is x=0 wall, (1,4) may be occupied, (2,3) is head.\n\nSo from (2,3), I can move directly to (1,3) if free.\n\nIn the state after eating (2,3), head at (2,3), and (1,3) should be free, as it was freed earlier.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 42 after eating (2,3), positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)  // tail (1,5)\n\n(1,3) is not occupied, so free, with food.\n\nThen on turn 43, I can move from (2,3) to (1,3) to eat it, since (1,3) is adjacent.\n\nMove L to (1,3).\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut is there tail reward danger? Tail is at (1,5), not adjacent to (1,3), so no.\n\n(1,3) and (1,5) are not adjacent; (1,4) is between, but (1,4) is occupied? In positions, (1,5) is tail, (1,4) might be segment.\n\nPositions: after moving to (1,3), head (1,3), then body: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), and tail (1,5) not removed, so segments include (1,6) and (1,5), so (1,4) is not occupied? Positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — so (1,4) is not there, free.\n\nTail at (1,5), head at (1,3), not adjacent, so safe.\n\nSo I can eat both foods.\n\nNow for turn 38, if I move D to (2,5), I can achieve this.\n\nIf I move R to (3,6), I can also reach similar state but later.\n\nFor example, turn 38 R to (3,6), turn 39 D to (3,5), turn 40 D to (3,4), turn 41 D to (3,3), turn 42 L to (2,3) to eat, same as above but one turn later in the descent.\n\nIn the first sequence with D on turn 38, I reached (3,3) on turn 41, then to (2,3) on turn 42.\n\nWith R on turn 38, I reach (3,6) turn 38, (3,5) turn 39, (3,4) turn 40, (3,3) turn 41, then (2,3) turn 42, same.\n\nBut in the first sequence, when I moved D on turn 38, on turn 39 I was at (3,5), same as moving R then D.\n\nIn both cases, by turn 39 I can be at (3,5).\n\nIf turn 38 D to (2,5), turn 39 R to (3,5)\n\nIf turn 38 R to (3,6), turn 39 D to (3,5)\n\nSo by turn 39, both paths reach (3,5), so the state is identical from there.\n\nTherefore, for turn 38, both moves lead to the same subsequent actions.\n\nBut moving D first might be better because I'm closer to the food, but in terms of position, after turn 38, if I move D, I am at (2,5), if I move R, at (3,6), but on turn 39, I am at (3,5) in both cases.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (3,5) or from (3,6) to (3,5), same cell on turn 39.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nTherefore, I can choose either for turn 38.\n\nBut moving D might be riskier if there are issues, but in this case, both seem fine.\n\nEarlier when I considered moving to (2,5) on turn 39 from another path, it was fatal, but that was different.\n\nHere, for turn 38, moving D to (2,5) is safe because on turn 39 I can move R to (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, moving R to (3,6) is safe.\n\nPerhaps I should move D to start descending.\n\nBut let's see the head direction.\n\nCurrent direction R, moving D changes to down, which might be useful for going down.\n\nMoving R keeps direction right.\n\nBut not critical.\n\nI think I can choose D for turn 38.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns.\n\nAlso, after eating the foods, I need to survive.\n\nBut for now, let's plan the next few turns to eat (2,3).\n\nSo turn 38: move D to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 39: move R to (3,5)  // only choice\n\nThen turn 40: from (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) to go towards (2,3)\n\nI could move U or R, but D is towards food.\n\nSimilarly, turn 41: move D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 42: move L to (2,3) to eat.\n\nThen turn 43: from (2,3), move L to (1,3) to eat the other food, if possible.\n\nOn turn 42 after eating (2,3), head at (2,3), positions: as before, (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) // tail (1,5)\n\n(1,3) is free and has food.\n\nAdjacent cells to head (2,3): (2,2), (2,4), (1,3), (3,3)\n\n(2,2) may have food but expired or not, life span, on turn 42, (2,2) was life span 4 from turn 38, so available until turn 41, on turn 42 gone, so no.\n\n(2,4) obstacle.\n\n(3,3) is body segment.\n\n(1,3) is free food.\n\nSo I can move directly to (1,3) on turn 43? From (2,3) to (1,3) is left.\n\nPossible.\n\nThen eat (1,3).\n\nAfter that, I have a longer snake, and need to find space.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can list up to there.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 38.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 38: D\n\nThen turn 39: R\n\nThen turn 40: D (to (3,4))\n\nThen turn 41: D (to (3,3))\n\nThen turn 42: L (to (2,3) eat)\n\nThen turn 43: L (to (1,3) eat)\n\nBut on turn 43, moving to (1,3), it should be free.\n\nIn positions, before move, head at (2,3), (1,3) adjacent and free.\n\nYes.\n\nAfter that, the snake will be longer.\n\nBut I think for the response, I can list these actions.\n\nSince the problem says \"maximize score\", and I eat two foods, that's good.\n\nIf I move R on turn 38, same actions later.\n\nBut with D first, I start descending.\n\nI think D is fine.\n\nNow, to confirm, on turn 40, from (3,5), I could move U or R, but moving D is better to go down.\n\nSimilarly, all moves seem determined.\n\nSo for turn 38, action D.\n\nThen the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 41, I move D to (3,3), which is fine.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: when I eat (2,3) on turn 42, tail is at (1,5), not adjacent, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for (1,3), tail at (1,5), but when I move to (1,3), tail is still at (1,5), not adjacent.\n\n(1,5) and (1,3) are not adjacent; (1,4) is in between.\n\nIn positions, (1,4) might be free or not, but not adjacent to head.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 38: D\n\nTurn 39: R\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: D\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: L\n\nBut I need to output in the boxed format.\n\nThe current turn is 38, so start from there.\n\nAlso, I can add more if needed, but this seems a sequence.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns, this is 6 turns ahead.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that focuses on eating the available positive food, especially considering the short life span of the food at (2,2). However, due to the obstacle at (2,4) and the snake's position, eating (2,2) before it expires (on turn 41) is impossible without risking death. Instead, I will target the food at (2,3) and (1,3), which have longer life spans (until turns 43 and 46, respectively). These foods are currently under the snake's body but can be eaten once freed.\n\nThe plan involves moving downward and right to position the snake to eat (2,3) by turn 42 and (1,3) by turn 43. This sequence avoids collisions, respects movement constraints (e.g., no instant reverse), and leverages the snake's body movement to free the food cells. After eating, the snake will be longer, so I will then focus on moving to open areas to avoid traps.\n\n### Key Steps:\n- **Turn 38 (current)**: Move down (D) to (2,5). This starts the descent toward the food area and avoids the risk of moving right into a less flexible position.\n- **Turn 39**: Move right (R) to (3,5). This is the only safe move from (2,5) and aligns with the path to (2,3).\n- **Turn 40**: Move down (D) to (3,4). This continues toward (3,3), preparing to access (2,3).\n- **Turn 41**: Move down (D) to (3,3). This positions the head adjacent to (2,3) for the next move.\n- **Turn 42**: Move left (L) to (2,3) to eat the food. At this point, (2,3) is free (the body moved away), and eating it is safe (no tail collision risk; tail is at (1,5)).\n- **Turn 43**: Move left (L) to (1,3) to eat the food. (1,3) is free and adjacent; eating it grows the snake further.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Safety**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions. The path is tested for 5+ turns, ensuring no dead ends (e.g., moving to (2,5) on turn 38 is safe because turn 39 must be R to (3,5), which is open).\n- **Food access**: (2,3) is eaten on turn 42 (within its life span ending at turn 43), and (1,3) on turn 43 (well within its life span ending at turn 46). (2,2) is skipped as unreachable safely.\n- **Score maximization**: Eating both foods yields +2 score with snake length increase. After turn 43, the snake can explore open areas (e.g., right or down from (1,3)) for more food or survival.\n- **Direction handling**: Moves respect the no-instant-reverse rule (e.g., after moving D on turn 38, U is not allowed on turn 39).\n\n### Full Action Sequence (Turns 38 to 43):\n\\boxed{\nTurn 38: D \\\\\nTurn 39: R \\\\\nTurn 40: D \\\\\nTurn 41: D \\\\\nTurn 42: L \\\\\nTurn 43: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 39, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,5), then body segments at (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, so south.\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (2,2) with value 1 and life span 3 turns (since it says life_span, and it decreases every turn including current, so after turn 39, it has 3 turns left including this one? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food at (2,2), life_span=3, meaning it will disappear after turn 39 + 3 - 1? Let's think: at turn 39, life_span is 3, so after this turn, it decreases to 2, then to 1, then to 0, and disappears after turn 42? I need to clarify.\n\nTypically, if life_span is N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t. So at turn t, life_span=N, then at turn t+1, it becomes N-1, and so on, until N=0, it disappears before turn t+1 if N=1, etc. But the countdown decreases every turn including current, so:\n\n- At the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it can be eaten during turn t.\n\n- After turn t, life_span decreases by 1.\n\n- If after decrease, life_span=0, it disappears before next turn.\n\nSo for (2,2): life_span=3 at turn 39. Can be eaten on turn 39, 40, or 41. After turn 41, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available on turn 42.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3): life_span=5, so available until turn 43? Turn 39: L=5, after turn 39: L=4, ..., after turn 43: L=0, disappear? Let's index:\n\nTurn | Life_span for (2,2) | Available?\n\n39 | 3 | Yes\n\n40 | 2 | Yes\n\n41 | 1 | Yes\n\n42 | 0 | No, disappeared\n\nFor (2,3): L=5 at turn 39\n\n39:5, 40:4, 41:3, 42:2, 43:1, 44:0 -> disappears after turn 43? After turn 43, L=0, so not available on turn 44.\n\nBut the food is given at turn 39 with life_span.\n\n(2,3) has life_span=5, so it can be eaten from turn 39 to turn 43 inclusive? Let's see the countdown decreases every turn including current, but \"including current\" might mean that during the turn, it's available, and after the turn, it decreases.\n\nI think it's safer to assume that at turn t, with life_span L, it is available for that turn, and then L decreases by 1 for the next turn.\n\nSo for (2,2): available on turns 39,40,41. Disappears before turn 42.\n\n(2,3): available on turns 39,40,41,42,43. Disappears before turn 44.\n\n(1,3): life_span=8, available until turn 46? Turn 39: L=8, available; turn 40: L=7, available; ... turn 46: L=1, available; turn 47: L=0, not available.\n\nNow, the food values: all are +1, since value=1 for all, meaning positive food.\n\n(2,2,3,1) — (x,y,life_span,value) I think, from the input: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so (2,2) with value=3? No, let's read:\n\n\"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (2, 2, 3, 1) - (2, 3, 5, 1) - (1, 3, 8, 1)\"\n\nThe format is a bit messy. It says: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) but here it's written as (2,2,3,1) which might be (x,y,life_span,value) or (x,y,value,life_span)? Let's see the description.\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 2, 3, 1) - (2, 3, 5, 1) - (1, 3, 8, 1)\"\n\nBut in the core rules, it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" and then \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but in the state, it's listed as (x,y, life_span, value) or something. Look: \"- (2, 2, 3, 1)\" and it says value and life span, so I think it's (x,y, life_span, value).\n\nFor (2,2,3,1): x=2,y=2, life_span=3, value=1\n\nSimilarly, (2,3,5,1): x=2,y=3, life_span=5, value=1\n\n(1,3,8,1): x=1,y=3, life_span=8, value=1\n\nAll values are +1, so all positive food.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,5), direction down.\n\nCurrent body positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nSo let's plot this on a grid.\n\nGrid from (0,0) to (7,7), walls at borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake:\n\nHead: (2,5)\n\nThen: (2,6) — above? y=6, since down is decreasing y, so (2,5) is at y=5, (2,6) is at y=6, which is north, but head direction is down, meaning moving south.\n\nIf head is at (2,5) and moving down (D), which is decreasing y, so next would be to (2,4) or something, but let's see the positions.\n\nPositions: index 0: (2,5) head\n\n1: (2,6) — this is (x,y), y=6 is higher, so north.\n\nIf y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top; but here walls at y=0 and y=7, so let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, since head direction down to lower y.\n\nHead at (2,5), moving down to lower y.\n\nBut position (2,6) has y=6, which is higher than 5, so north.\n\nSequence: head (2,5), then (2,6), which is directly above? (2,6) has same x, y=6 > y=5, so if y=0 is bottom, y=6 is north of y=5.\n\nThen next is (1,6), which is left and same y? x=1 < x=2, so west if x increases right.\n\nThen (1,5), same x, y=5 < y=6, so south.\n\nThen (1,4), same x, y=4 < y=5, south.\n\nThen (1,3), same x, y=3 < y=4, south.\n\nThen (2,3), x=2>1, same y, east.\n\nThen (3,3), x=3>2, same y, east.\n\nSo the snake is: head at (2,5), body goes up to (2,6), then left to (1,6), then down to (1,5), down to (1,4), down to (1,3), then right to (2,3), then right to (3,3).\n\nSo tail is at (3,3).\n\nNow head direction is down, meaning last move was down, so from where? Head is at (2,5), and previous position was (2,6)? But (2,6) is above, so if it came from (2,6) to (2,5), that is moving down, yes.\n\nBut now, at (2,5), moving down would go to (2,4), but (2,4) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4), which is a wall cell.\n\nWalls: internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (2,4) is a wall, so cannot move there.\n\nAlso, borders x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls.\n\nNow, possible moves from head (2,5):\n\nCurrent direction is down, so I can move down, but down to (2,4) is wall, so impossible.\n\nCannot move opposite to current direction instantly, but current direction is down, so opposite is up. But since I just moved down to here, I cannot move up immediately? No, the rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is the direction the head is facing, which is down, meaning last move was down.\n\nSo from (2,5), I cannot move up (opposite) immediately.\n\nPossible moves: not opposite, and not into wall or body.\n\nDirections: U, D, L, R.\n\nD: down to (2,4) — but (2,4) is wall, so invalid.\n\nU: up to (2,6) — but (2,6) is a body segment, and it's not the tail? Positions: (2,6) is the first body segment after head, so it's occupied.\n\nCan I move to a body segment? Only if it's the tail and the tail will move, but here (2,6) is not the tail; tail is at (3,3).\n\nThe rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to any body segment except the tail is fatal. Tail is at (3,3), so (2,6) is not tail, so moving to (2,6) would collide with body.\n\nSimilarly, L: left to (1,5) — (1,5) is occupied by body? Positions: (1,5) is the fourth segment, index 3: (1,5), so occupied.\n\nR: right to (3,5) — is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nSnake positions: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n\nSo (3,5) is not listed, so probably free.\n\nBut need to check walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders, so (3,5) is within 1-6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0,7 so x=1 to 6 are free, y=0,7 walls, y=1 to 6 free? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6 are free? Let's see.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x:1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly y=0 and y=7 walls, valid y:1 to 6.\n\nIn the positions, we have y=3,4,5,6, which are within 1-6? y=1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\ny=0 bottom, y=7 top, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, I think, except obstacles.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But positions have y=3,4,5,6, and (2,6) y=6 which is not wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 is the top row, but since walls are at y=0 and y=7, y=6 should be free, only y=7 is wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6 free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo (3,5): x=3, y=5, not a wall, not obstacle, and not in snake positions, so free.\n\nNow, back to moves from (2,5):\n\n- U (up) to (2,6): but (2,6) is occupied by body (index 1), not tail, so collision.\n\n- D (down) to (2,4): (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\n- L (left) to (1,5): (1,5) is occupied by body (index 3), not tail, collision.\n\n- R (right) to (3,5): free, as above.\n\nSo only possible move is R, right to (3,5).\n\nIs that right? L to (1,5) is body, U to (2,6) body, D to wall, only R free.\n\nBut current direction is down, and R is not opposite, so it's allowed.\n\nOpposite of down is up, but up is not possible anyway.\n\nSo for turn 39, I must move right to (3,5).\n\nBut I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn 39, 40, etc., up to at least 5 turns ahead? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\".\n\nAlso, food: we have food at (2,2), (2,3), (1,3)\n\n(1,3) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (1,3) is index 5, so it's part of the body.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is index 6.\n\nBut food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n\nNow, for turn 39, I must move to (3,5).\n\nAfter moving to (3,5), the snake will have new head at (3,5), and tail will move? When snake moves without eating, tail moves off.\n\nCurrently, snake positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nAfter moving right to (3,5), new head at (3,5), and the body: the segment at (2,5) becomes new neck, but since no food eaten, tail at (3,3) is removed.\n\nSnake movement: if no food, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail is removed.\n\nSo after moving to (3,5):\n\n- New head: (3,5)\n\n- Body: the previous head (2,5) becomes first body segment at (2,5)\n\nThen (2,6) moves to where? The segment that was at (2,6) moves to the position of the previous head, which is (2,5)? Let's sequence.\n\nLet S = positions list: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eating: new head at new position, then B1 to old H position, B2 to old B1 position, ..., T is removed.\n\nSo here, old positions: H=(2,5), B1=(2,6), B2=(1,6), B3=(1,5), B4=(1,4), B5=(1,3), B6=(2,3), T=(3,3)\n\nAfter moving right to (3,5):\n\n- New head: (3,5)\n\n- New B1: old H position (2,5)\n\n- New B2: old B1 position (2,6)\n\n- New B3: old B2 position (1,6)\n\n- New B4: old B3 position (1,5)\n\n- New B5: old B4 position (1,4)\n\n- New B6: old B5 position (1,3)\n\n- Tail was T, removed, so the segment at (2,3) is now the new tail? Old B6 was (2,3), which becomes new B6, but since tail is removed, the last segment is now old B5? Positions: after move, the body segments from B1 to B6, with B6 being the last before tail.\n\nOld: indices 0:H, 1:B1, 2:B2, 3:B3, 4:B4, 5:B5, 6:B6, 7:T? List has 8 positions: [ (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) ] so index 0: head, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7: tail? Typically, head and 7 body segments, but tail is the last one.\n\nAfter move, new positions: head at (3,5), then the first body segment at old head position (2,5), then next at old B1 (2,6), then old B2 (1,6), old B3 (1,5), old B4 (1,4), old B5 (1,3), and old B6 (2,3) becomes the new tail, since T was removed.\n\nOld tail was (3,3), so it is removed, and old B6 (2,3) is now the last segment, tail.\n\nSo new positions: head (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail (2,3)\n\n(2,3) is now tail.\n\nNow, head direction: since I moved right, new head direction is right.\n\nNow, for turn 40, I need to decide where to move from (3,5).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut cannot reverse, current direction right, so cannot move left (opposite).\n\nL: left to (2,5) — but (2,5) is now occupied by body, the first segment? New positions: head (3,5), B1 at (2,5), so moving to (2,5) would be collision with body, not tail.\n\n(2,5) is not tail; tail is at (2,3).\n\nU: up to (3,6) — y=6, is it valid? y=6 is within 1-6, and not wall. Is it occupied? Snake has (2,6) and (1,6), but (3,6) not listed, so free? Check obstacles: internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), no (3,6), so free.\n\nD: down to (3,4) — y=4, free? Not in snake, not obstacle. Snake has (1,4), (1,5), etc., but (3,4) not occupied. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) not, so free.\n\nR: right to (4,5) — x=4,y=5, free? Not in snake, not obstacle.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5). L to (2,5) is body, invalid.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and survival.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (2,2): value 1, life_span 3, so available turn 39,40,41\n\n- (2,3): value 1, life_span 5, available turn 39 to 43\n\n- (1,3): value 1, life_span 8, available turn 39 to 46\n\nBut (1,3) is currently occupied by snake body? In the current state, at turn 39, (1,3) is occupied by body segment, so food under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is also occupied by body.\n\nAt turn 39, positions: (1,3) and (2,3) are occupied.\n\nAfter turn 39 move, we moved to (3,5), so new positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail (2,3)\n\nSo (1,3) is still occupied, by the body segment that was B5, now it's... in new, let's index: head (3,5), then B1 (2,5), B2 (2,6), B3 (1,6), B4 (1,5), B5 (1,4), B6 (1,3), tail (2,3)? Earlier I said tail is (2,3), but (2,3) is the last position, but in the list, it's (1,3) then (2,3), so (1,3) is B6, (2,3) is tail.\n\nB6 at (1,3), tail at (2,3).\n\nFood at (1,3) is under B6, and (2,3) is under tail.\n\nFood at (1,3) and (2,3) are both under snake body.\n\nTo eat them, the body must move away, and head must move there.\n\nFor example, if later the snake moves such that (1,3) is vacated, then head can move to (1,3) to eat.\n\nSimilarly for (2,3).\n\nNow, for turn 40, from head (3,5), I can move U, D, or R.\n\nI need to think about the food at (2,2), which is available for 3 turns including turn 39, so at turn 40, it has life_span 2 (after turn 39), so available turn 40 and 41.\n\nAt turn 40, life_span for (2,2) is 2 (since decreased after turn 39).\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) life_span 4 at turn 40, etc.\n\nBut (2,2) is at (2,2), which is currently free? Snake positions: at turn 40, positions as above, (2,2) not occupied, and not wall, so it's free.\n\nSimilarly, obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) is not listed as obstacle, so free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — so (1,2) is obstacle, (2,4) obstacle, but (2,2) free.\n\nSo (2,2) is a free cell with food.\n\nI could try to eat it.\n\nFrom (3,5), to reach (2,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut from (3,5), moving left is not possible because it's reverse or occupied? Current direction right, so left is opposite, cannot move left. From (3,5), I can only move U, D, R, not L.\n\nMoving to (2,5) is body, as said.\n\nSo I cannot go directly to (2,2) from here.\n\nPerhaps I need to maneuver.\n\nAlso, there is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (2,3), with food? (2,3) has food, value 1.\n\nBut head is at (3,5), not adjacent to (2,3). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,5) to (2,3) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are same x or same y, differ by 1.\n\nSo (3,5) adjacent to: (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5)\n\n(2,3) is not adjacent; it's two steps away.\n\nNo danger now.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid for planning.\n\nFirst, for turn 39, I have no choice, must move right to (3,5).\n\nThen for turn 40, from (3,5), I can choose U, D, or R.\n\nI need to avoid dead ends and plan for food.\n\nAlso, the snake is quite long, 8 segments, so space is limited.\n\nAvailable cells: grid 6x6 = 36 cells? x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, 36 cells.\n\nSnake 8 cells, obstacles: internal 5, so occupied: snake 8 + obstacles 5 = 13, free cells: 36-13=23, but walls are not included, walls are borders, which are not playable, so playable cells are 6x6=36 minus internal obstacles 5, so 31 cells, minus snake 8, so 23 free.\n\nBut some have food.\n\nNow, food at (2,2), (2,3), (1,3) but (1,3) and (2,3) occupied, so only (2,2) is accessible if I go there.\n\n(2,2) is free and has food.\n\nTo reach (2,2) from (3,5), I need to move down and left, but I cannot move left directly.\n\nSo I need to go down or up or right first.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (3,4) at turn 40.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,2) or something.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 39: move R to (3,5)\n\nNow state for turn 40: head at (3,5), direction right.\n\nPositions: head (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail (2,3)\n\nFood: (2,2) available turn 40 and 41 (life_span 2 at turn 40 start)\n\n(2,3) available turn 40 to 43 (life_span 4)\n\n(1,3) available turn 40 to 46 (life_span 7? At turn 40, life_span for (1,3) was 8 at turn 39, after turn 39 decrease, so at turn 40 start, life_span=7 for (1,3))\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) life_span=4 at turn 40.\n\nNow, from (3,5), move D to (3,4)\n\nThen new head (3,4), body: old positions except tail removed, so new body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and tail was (2,3) removed? After move to (3,4), no food, so tail removed.\n\nOld tail (2,3) removed, new tail is old B6, which was (1,3)\n\nPositions: after move down to (3,4):\n\n- New head: (3,4)\n\n- New B1: old head (3,5)\n\n- New B2: old B1 (2,5)\n\n- New B3: old B2 (2,6)\n\n- New B4: old B3 (1,6)\n\n- New B5: old B4 (1,5)\n\n- New B6: old B5 (1,4)\n\n- Old B6 (1,3) becomes new tail? Old B6 was (1,3), but in the sequence, after new B6, the last is tail.\n\nOld positions before move: head (3,5), B1 (2,5), B2 (2,6), B3 (1,6), B4 (1,5), B5 (1,4), B6 (1,3), tail (2,3)\n\nAfter move down to (3,4) no eat:\n\n- New head: (3,4)\n\n- New B1: old head (3,5)\n\n- New B2: old B1 (2,5)\n\n- New B3: old B2 (2,6)\n\n- New B4: old B3 (1,6)\n\n- New B5: old B4 (1,5)\n\n- New B6: old B5 (1,4)\n\n- Tail removed, so new tail is old B6 (1,3)? Old B6 was (1,3), which is now the last, so positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,3)\n\n(1,3) is tail, and it has food, but food is under it, so if head moves to (1,3), it can eat when tail moves away.\n\nBut now, at turn 40, after move, positions have tail at (1,3), with food.\n\nFrom new head (3,4), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction down, so cannot move up (opposite).\n\nU: up to (3,5) — but (3,5) is now occupied by B1, body, so collision.\n\nD: down to (3,3) — (3,3) is free? Snake: tail at (1,3), (3,3) not occupied, not wall? Walls: internal obstacles, (3,3) not listed, so free.\n\nL: left to (2,4) — but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nR: right to (4,4) — free, not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (3,3) or R to (4,4).\n\nIf I go to (3,3), that is down.\n\n(3,3) is close to (2,3), which has food, and (2,2).\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to think about eating the food at (2,2) soon.\n\nIf at turn 40 from (3,5) I move down to (3,4), then at turn 41 from (3,4) I can move down to (3,3), for example.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move left to (2,3), but (2,3) has food and is currently occupied? At that point.\n\nLet's timeline.\n\nTurn 40: from (3,5) move D to (3,4)\n\nState: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,3)  // tail at (1,3)\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 41: from (3,4), move D to (3,3)\n\nThen new head (3,3), body: old head (3,4), then old B1 (3,5), old B2 (2,5), old B3 (2,6), old B4 (1,6), old B5 (1,5), old B6 (1,4), and tail old tail (1,3) removed? After move, no eat, tail removed.\n\nPositions: new head (3,3), new B1 (3,4), new B2 (3,5), new B3 (2,5), new B4 (2,6), new B5 (1,6), new B6 (1,5), new tail (1,4)  // since old B6 (1,4) becomes tail.\n\nTail at (1,4)\n\nNow, (2,3) is free? Not occupied, and food there.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move to (2,3), which has food.\n\nMove L to (2,3).\n\nBut (2,3) has food, so if I move there, I eat it, snake grows.\n\nBut check if it's possible.\n\nFrom (3,3), current direction down (since moved down to here).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot move up, opposite of down.\n\nU: up to (3,4) — occupied by B1, body, collision.\n\nD: down to (3,2) — y=2, free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nL: left to (2,3) — free, and has food.\n\nR: right to (4,3) — free.\n\nSo L to (2,3) is possible.\n\nIf I move to (2,3), I eat the food, since it's there and free.\n\nThen snake grows: head moves to (2,3), and tail does not move, so new tail is added.\n\nPositions: after eating, head at (2,3), the previous position of head becomes new body, so (3,3) becomes body, and tail stays, so snake longer by one.\n\nSpecifically: old positions before move: head (3,3), B1 (3,4), B2 (3,5), B3 (2,5), B4 (2,6), B5 (1,6), B6 (1,5), tail (1,4)\n\nAfter moving to (2,3) and eat:\n\n- New head: (2,3)\n\n- New B1: old head (3,3)\n\n- Then new B2: old B1 (3,4)\n\n- New B3: old B2 (3,5)\n\n- New B4: old B3 (2,5)\n\n- New B5: old B4 (2,6)\n\n- New B6: old B5 (1,6)\n\n- New B7: old B6 (1,5)\n\n- Tail: old tail (1,4) remains, so now 9 segments.\n\nAnd food at (2,3) eaten.\n\nNow, but (2,3) was under body earlier, but now it's free and head moves there.\n\nAlso, life_span: at turn 41, (2,3) has life_span 3? Let's keep track of time.\n\nTurn 39: food life_spans: (2,2):3, (2,3):5, (1,3):8\n\nAfter turn 39, life_spans decrease by 1.\n\nTurn 40: (2,2):2, (2,3):4, (1,3):7\n\nAfter turn 40, decrease.\n\nTurn 41: (2,2):1, (2,3):3, (1,3):6\n\nAt turn 41, (2,2) has life_span 1, so available only this turn, disappears after.\n\n(2,3) has life_span 3, available.\n\nIn the above, at turn 41, if I move to (2,3), I eat it.\n\nBut I also have (2,2) which is available only this turn.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), adjacent to (2,3).\n\nAfter eating at (2,3), head at (2,3), then I could move to (2,2) to eat that too, but (2,2) has life_span 1 at turn 41, so I need to eat it on turn 41 or it's gone.\n\nBut at turn 41, when I am at (3,3), I can choose to go to (2,2) or to (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), to go to (2,2), I need to move left and down, but moves are to adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (3,3), moving to (2,3) is left, or to (3,2) is down, or to (4,3) right, (3,4) up but invalid.\n\n(2,2) is not directly adjacent to (3,3); it's diagonal or one step away.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move to (2,3) or to (3,2), but not directly to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is adjacent to (2,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2).\n\n(1,2) is obstacle, (2,1) y=1, which is border? y=1 is valid, since y=0 wall, y=1 to 6 free.\n\nBut (2,1) is free, no obstacle.\n\nBut from (3,3), I can only reach (2,2) via (2,3) or (3,2).\n\nIf at turn 41 I move to (2,3), I eat the food there, but then I am at (2,3), and (2,2) is adjacent.\n\nThen at turn 42, I can move down to (2,2) to eat it.\n\nBut at turn 41, (2,2) has life_span 1, so it must be eaten on turn 41, or it disappears.\n\nAfter turn 41, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available on turn 42.\n\nAt turn 41 start, life_span=1, available during turn 41.\n\nIf I don't eat it on turn 41, after turn 41, it disappears.\n\nSo if at turn 41 I am at (3,3) and I move to (2,3), I eat (2,3), but (2,2) is not eaten, and since I used turn 41, (2,2) disappears.\n\nIf I move directly to (2,2) from (3,3), I can't, not adjacent.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,2) on turn 41 from (3,3); I can only eat it if I am adjacent and move there.\n\nBut at turn 41, from (3,3), the only way to reach (2,2) in one move is not possible; I need to be at (2,3) or (3,2) or (2,1) etc. but not from (3,3).\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,2) on turn 41 if I am at (3,3).\n\nTherefore, to eat (2,2), I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 40 or 41.\n\nTurn 40: at (3,5), I can move to (3,4) or other.\n\nIf at turn 40 I move to (3,4), then at turn 41 I am at (3,4) or (3,3) or (4,4), not adjacent to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) adjacent cells: (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2)\n\n(1,2) obstacle, (2,1) free, (2,3) occupied? At turn 40, after move to (3,4), positions have (1,3) as tail, (2,3) free? At turn 40 state: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,3)\n\nSo (2,3) is free, and has food.\n\n(3,2) free.\n\n(2,1) free.\n\nBut from (3,4), I am not adjacent to (2,2).\n\nThe closest I can be is at (2,3) or (3,2) or (2,1).\n\nFor example, at turn 40, from (3,5), instead of moving down, I could move right to (4,5), or up to (3,6).\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (2,2) by turn 41.\n\nTurn 39: move to (3,5) — must\n\nTurn 40: from (3,5), I can move down to (3,4), then turn 41 from (3,4) move to (2,4)? But (2,4) is wall, invalid.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move to (3,3) or (4,4), not to (2,3) directly.\n\n(2,3) is adjacent to (3,3), (2,2), (2,4), (1,3)\n\n(2,4) wall, (1,3) occupied by tail at turn 40 state.\n\nAt turn 40, (2,3) is free.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move to (3,3) or to (4,4), or to (3,5) but invalid, or to (2,4) invalid.\n\nSo I can move to (3,3) or (4,4).\n\nIf I move to (3,3), then at turn 41, I can move to (2,3) or (3,2) or (4,3).\n\n(2,3) has food, and (2,2) is adjacent, but I can only eat one per turn.\n\nAt turn 41, if I move to (2,3), I eat that food, but (2,2) disappears.\n\nIf I move to (3,2), then I am at (3,2), and (2,2) is adjacent, so I can move to (2,2) at turn 42, but (2,2) has life_span 1 at turn 41, so after turn 41 it disappears, not available on turn 42.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,2) at all if I go this path.\n\nTherefore, to eat (2,2), I must be at an adjacent cell on turn 40 or turn 41.\n\nOn turn 40, I am at (3,5), not adjacent to (2,2).\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,2) are (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2)\n\n(1,2) obstacle, so not.\n\n(2,1), (2,3), (3,2)\n\nAt turn 40, I am at (3,5), which is not one of these.\n\nOn turn 41, I will be at some cell based on turn 40 move.\n\nIf on turn 40 I move to a cell adjacent to (2,2), then on turn 41 I can move to (2,2).\n\nBut is there a move from (3,5) to a cell adjacent to (2,2) in one step? No, (3,5) to (2,1) or (2,3) or (3,2) is not adjacent; (2,3) is at distance, for example.\n\nCells adjacent to (2,2): (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)\n\nFrom (3,5), I can reach (2,3) in one move? (2,3) is at (2,3), from (3,5) to (2,3) is not adjacent; it's two steps away horizontally and vertically.\n\nNot possible in one move.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) from (3,5) is three steps down.\n\nSo I cannot be adjacent to (2,2) on turn 40 or 41 from current position.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat (2,2) because it will disappear after turn 41, and I can't reach it in time.\n\nAt turn 39, I am at (2,5), and (2,2) is at (2,2), which is three steps away: for example, down to (2,4) but wall, or left to (1,5) body, etc., I couldn't go directly.\n\nFrom (2,5), at turn 39, only possible move is right to (3,5), as we did.\n\nThen from there, I can't reach (2,2) in two moves to eat on turn 40 or 41.\n\nFor example, to reach (2,3) on turn 40: from (3,5) to (2,3) not possible directly.\n\nShortest path: from (3,5) to (2,5) but occupied, to (3,4) then to (2,4) wall, to (3,4) then to (3,3) then to (2,3) on turn 41.\n\nBut (2,2) not eaten.\n\nSo (2,2) will disappear without being eaten, since no one can reach it in time.\n\nSimilarly, only the snake can eat, but it's trapped.\n\nSo forget about (2,2), focus on other food.\n\nNow, food at (2,3) and (1,3), which have longer life.\n\n(2,3) available until turn 43, (1,3) until turn 46.\n\nAlso, after moving, the tail is at (1,3) with food, so when the tail moves away, the food is exposed.\n\nAt turn 40 state, after turn 39 move, tail at (1,3) with food.\n\nIf the snake moves, the tail will move, so (1,3) might be vacated.\n\nFor example, if at turn 40 I move from (3,5) to (4,5) right.\n\nThen new head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,3) removed? After move, no eat, tail removed, so (1,3) is vacated, and food is there, so now (1,3) has food and is free.\n\nBut head is at (4,5), not adjacent.\n\nThen later I can go to (1,3) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,3), at turn 40 state, (2,3) is free and has food.\n\nSo I should plan to eat (2,3) or (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is the tail position, so when tail moves, it might be vacated.\n\nAt turn 40, from (3,5), if I move to (3,4) down, then as before, tail at (1,3), and (1,3) has food, but not vacated yet.\n\nAfter move to (3,4), tail at (1,3), so (1,3) occupied.\n\nIf I move in a way that the tail moves away quickly.\n\nBut let's think about the grid and avoid dead ends.\n\nFirst, for turn 39, I must move R to (3,5).\n\nThen for turn 40, from (3,5), I have choices: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5)\n\nNow, let's see the area.\n\nThere is an obstacle at (2,4) and (1,2), etc.\n\nAlso, the snake body is on the left side.\n\nIf I move up to (3,6), then head at (3,6), which is top row.\n\nThen possible moves: from (3,6), direction up.\n\nCannot move down, opposite.\n\nL to (2,6) — (2,6) is occupied? At turn 40 state, if I move U to (3,6), let's see positions.\n\nTurn 40 action: move U to (3,6)\n\nThen new head (3,6), body: old head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail (2,3) removed? After move, no eat, tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), B1 (3,5), B2 (2,5), B3 (2,6), B4 (1,6), B5 (1,5), B6 (1,4), tail (1,3)  // old B6 (1,4) to B6, old tail (2,3) removed, new tail old B5 (1,4)?

At turn 40 from (3,5) I move to (4,5), then at turn 41 from (4,5) I can move to (4,4), then turn 42 to (3,4), turn 43 to (3,3), turn 44 to (2,3), but (2,3) life_span at turn 44: at turn 39 L=5, turn 40 L=4, turn 41 L=3, turn 42 L=2, turn 43 L=1, turn 44 L=0, not available. So on turn 44 it's gone, I can eat on turn 43 at (3,3) or something, but not (2,3).\n\nAt turn 43, (2,3) has life_span 1, available.\n\nIf I am at (3,3) on turn 43, I can move to (2,3) to eat.\n\nFrom above, if at turn 40 I move to (4,5), turn 41 move to (4,4), turn 42 move to (3,4), turn 43 move to (3,3), then turn 44 move to (2,3), but on turn 44, (2,3) life_span 0, not available.\n\nTurn 43: (2,3) life_span 1, available during turn 43.\n\nIf on turn 43 I am at (3,3), I can move to (2,3) on turn 43 to eat.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 40: from (3,5) move R to (4,5)  // head now (4,5)\n\nTurn 41: from (4,5) move D to (4,4)  // head (4,4), direction down\n\nTurn 42: from (4,4) move L to (3,4)  // head (3,4), direction left?

Yes.\n\nNew head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), tail (1,5)  // tail at (1,5)\n\n(1,4) vacated, food at (1,3) free.\n\nDirection left.\n\nTurn 43: from (3,4), move D to (3,3)\n\nNew head (3,3), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), tail (1,6)  // tail at (1,6)\n\n(1,5) vacated.\n\nFood at (1,3) still free.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move to (2,3) to eat the food there.\n\n(2,3) has food and is free.\n\nMove L to (2,3)\n\nThen eat, snake grows.\n\nAt turn 43, (2,3) has life_span 1, available.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to (1,3) but it's farther.\n\nSo this is possible.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, but for turn 39, I must move R.\n\nThen for turn 40, I can choose.\n\nTo maximize score, I should try to eat food when possible.\n\nAlso, avoid risks.\n\nAnother option: at turn 40, from (3,5), move D to (3,4), then turn 41 move D to (3,3), then turn 42 move L to (2,3) to eat.\n\nAt turn 42, (2,3) has life_span 2, available.\n\nTurn 39: move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 40: move D to (3,4)  // head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,3)\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 41: move D to (3,3)  // head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), tail (1,4)\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 42: move L to (2,3)  // eat, head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), tail (1,4)  // since ate, tail not removed, new segment added, so positions include old tail.\n\nAfter eating, tail remains, so new positions: head (2,3), then new body at old head (3,3), then old B1 (3,4), old B2 (3,5), old B3 (2,5), old B4 (2,6), old B5 (1,6), old B6 (1,5), and old tail (1,4) becomes body, so 9 segments.\n\nAnd food eaten.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nThis way, I eat (2,3) on turn 42.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is still there, I can eat later.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for turn 39, 40, 41, etc.\n\nSince turn 39 is fixed, move R.\n\nThen for turn 40, I can choose move D to (3,4) as above, or move R to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut in the move to (3,4), then to (3,3), then to (2,3), I eat on turn 42.\n\nWith move to (4,5), I eat later.\n\nBut both possible.\n\nBut in the first path, I am closer to the food area.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,3), which I can eat after.\n\nBut let's see the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nFor example, if tail has food and head is adjacent, and I move to tail position, I eat it but then the new tail grows and collides with head.\n\nIn this case, at turn 42, when I move to (2,3), the tail is at (1,4), not adjacent to (2,3). (1,4) to (2,3) is diagonal, not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nSimilarly, in other positions.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow for turn 39: move R\n\nThen turn 40: move D\n\nThen turn 41: move D\n\nThen turn 42: move L to eat (2,3)\n\nBut I need to output for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions.\n\nThe answer format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=39, so output Turn 39: R, Turn 40: D, Turn 41: D, Turn 42: L, and so on.\n\nBut after that, I can plan further.\n\nSince (1,3) has food, I can go to eat it.\n\nAfter eating at (2,3) on turn 42, head at (2,3), direction left (since moved left).\n\nPositions: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), tail (1,4)\n\nFood at (1,3) is free, since tail moved away.\n\n(1,3) adjacent to head? (2,3) to (1,3) is left, and (1,3) is free with food.\n\nSo at turn 43, I can move L to (1,3) to eat it.\n\nThen snake grows more.\n\nBut check if adjacent to tail: tail at (1,4), which is below (1,3), so adjacent vertically.\n\n(1,4) and (1,3) share edge, so head at (2,3), tail at (1,4), not adjacent; (2,3) and (1,4) are diagonal.\n\nAdjacent means same row or column, differ by 1.\n\n(2,3) and (1,4): different row and column, not adjacent.\n\nSo moving to (1,3) should be fine.\n\nAfter moving to (1,3), eat, then new head at (1,3), body includes (2,3), and tail at (1,4) remains, no immediate collision.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut in this case, I eat both foods quickly.\n\nFor the actions, I can output:\n\nTurn 39: R\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: D\n\nTurn 42: L (to eat (2,3))\n\nThen Turn 43: L (to (1,3) to eat)\n\nThen after that, I need to move away, but no more food, so survive.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nAfter turn 42, head at (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), tail (1,4)\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move to (1,3) left, to eat.\n\nOr to (2,2) but (2,2) is gone, or to (2,4) wall, or to (3,3) body.\n\nSo only possible to (1,3) or if I move up/down, but (2,2) gone, (2,4) wall, (3,3) body, so only (1,3) is free.\n\nSo must move L to (1,3) to eat.\n\nThen after eating, head at (1,3), body: old head (2,3) becomes body, then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), and tail (1,4) remains, so 10 segments.\n\nThen from (1,3), I can move to (1,2) but obstacle, or to (1,4) which is tail, but tail will move, so I can move to tail position.\n\n(1,4) is tail, so moving to (1,4) is allowed, since tail moves.\n\nBut (1,4) has no food, so if I move there, no eat, tail moves away.\n\nBut if I move to (1,4), it is possible.\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nBut no more food, so just survive.\n\nFor the answer, I think outputting up to turn 43 or so.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the turns starting from t1.\n\nFor turn 39: must be R\n\nThen for turn 40, I can choose, but in this plan, move D.\n\nThen 41 D, 42 L.\n\nThen 43 L to eat another.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nPerhaps start with this.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 39: R (right)\n\nTurn 40: D (down)\n\nTurn 41: D (down)\n\nTurn 42: L (left) to eat (2,3)\n\nThen Turn 43: L (left) to eat (1,3)\n\nThen for turn 44, from (1,3) after eating, head at (1,3), direction left.\n\nPositions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), tail (1,4)\n\nNow, possible moves: U to (1,4) — (1,4) is tail, so I can move there, since tail will move.\n\nD to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nL to (0,3) but x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,3) occupied by body.\n\nSo only possible move U to (1,4)\n\nThen move to tail position, no eat, so tail moves away.\n\nAfter move, head to (1,4), then body segments move, tail removed.\n\nSo new head (1,4), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), tail (1,5) etc.\n\nThen I can continue moving.\n\nBut for output, I think up to turn 43 is fine, or include turn 44.\n\nBut the answer should have actions for several turns.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating both foods is good.\n\nIn this plan, I eat (2,3) on turn 42 and (1,3) on turn 43.\n\n(1,3) was eaten on turn 43, which is fine.\n\nNow for turn 39 to 43 actions.\n\nBut turn 39: R\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: D\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: L\n\nAnd for thinking ahead, it works.\n\nIf I move differently on turn 40, but this seems efficient.\n\nTo avoid the body, but in this case, it's ok.\n\nSo I think this is a plan.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 39):**\n- **Snake Head**: (2,5), direction Down (D).\n- **Snake Body**: Positions [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)] (8 segments, tail at (3,3)).\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,2): Value +1, life span 3 (available turns 39, 40, 41).\n  - (2,3): Value +1, life span 5 (available turns 39, 40, 41, 42, 43).\n  - (1,3): Value +1, life span 8 (available turns 39 to 46).\n- **Walls/Obstacles**: Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n- **Constraints**: \n  - From head (2,5), moving Down (D) to (2,4) is invalid (wall). \n  - Moving Up (U) to (2,6) or Left (L) to (1,5) causes body collision (not tail). \n  - Only valid move at turn 39 is Right (R) to (3,5).\n\n**Key Considerations for 5+ Turns Ahead:**\n- **Food Access**:\n  - (2,2) is only available until turn 41, but it is unreachable by turn 41 due to distance and obstacles (e.g., (2,4) wall blocks direct path). Prioritize eating (2,3) and (1,3) instead.\n  - (2,3) and (1,3) are under snake body initially but can be eaten once vacated. (1,3) is the tail at turn 40, so moving the tail exposes it.\n- **Path to Food**: \n  - After moving to (3,5) at turn 39, the shortest path to (2,3) is via (3,4) and (3,3), allowing a move to (2,3) by turn 42.\n  - (1,3) is adjacent to (2,3) and can be eaten on turn 43 after (2,3) is consumed.\n- **Risks**: \n  - Avoid walls and body collisions. The area around (1,2)-(2,2)-(2,3) has obstacles, but moving to (2,3) and (1,3) is safe with proper sequencing.\n  - No tail reward danger: When moving to (2,3) or (1,3), the tail (e.g., at (1,4)) is not adjacent to the head, so eating is safe.\n- **Survival Focus**: After eating both foods, the snake grows to 10 segments. The grid has free space (23 cells initially), but future moves must avoid dead ends (e.g., the left side near (1,1)-(1,2) has obstacles). After turn 43, move up to (1,4) to open space.\n\n**Action Plan (Turns 39-43):**\n- **Turn 39 (Current)**: Move Right (R) to (3,5) – only possible move, avoids collision/wall.\n- **Turn 40**: Move Down (D) to (3,4) – positions snake for accessing (2,3), avoids immediate risks.\n- **Turn 41**: Move Down (D) to (3,3) – brings head adjacent to (2,3) with food.\n- **Turn 42**: Move Left (L) to (2,3) – eat (2,3) (life span ensures availability; snake grows to 9 segments).\n- **Turn 43**: Move Left (L) to (1,3) – eat (1,3) (vacated by tail movement; snake grows to 10 segments).\n\n**Simulated Positions (for Validation):**\n- After Turn 39 (R): Head (3,5), body [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)], tail (2,3) removed. Direction: Right.\n- After Turn 40 (D): Head (3,4), body [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)], tail (1,3). Direction: Down.\n- After Turn 41 (D): Head (3,3), body [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)], tail (1,4). Direction: Down.\n- After Turn 42 (L, eat (2,3)): Head (2,3), body [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)], tail (1,4) (snake length 9). Direction: Left.\n- After Turn 43 (L, eat (1,3)): Head (1,3), body [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)], tail (1,4) (snake length 10). Direction: Left.\n\n**Beyond Turn 43**: \n- Turn 44: From (1,3), only valid move is Up (U) to (1,4) (tail position; no collision as tail moves). This opens paths to the right/north for long-term survival.\n- Food (2,2) expires after turn 41, so no loss. No other food; focus on exploration (e.g., move towards center or open areas like (4,4)).\n\nThis plan scores +2 (eats two positive foods) by turn 43 and ensures survival by avoiding risks and maintaining maneuverability.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 39: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 40: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 41: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 42: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 43: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 40. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Snake positions: head at (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is right, meaning it's moving east.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,2) with life span 2, value +1\n\n- (2,3) with life span 4, value +1\n\n- (1,3) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (4,3) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food has value +1, so no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so I need to consider how long they last.\n\nCurrent turn is 40, so for food at (2,2): life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 41? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 40, life span is 2, meaning after this turn, it will be 1, and after turn 41, it will be 0 and disappear. Similarly, (2,3) life span 4, so disappears after turn 43, and so on.\n\nI should plan moves for at least 5 turns ahead, as per the instruction.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a mental map.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls and can't be moved to.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these are blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (3,5)\n\n- Body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells:\n\n- (3,5): head\n\n- (2,5): segment\n\n- (2,6): segment\n\n- (1,6): segment\n\n- (1,5): segment\n\n- (1,4): segment\n\n- (1,3): segment\n\n- (2,3): tail\n\nThe snake is a bit coiled up. From head (3,5) to (2,5) is left, then (2,6) is up from (2,5)? (2,5) to (2,6) is up, then (2,6) to (1,6) is left, then (1,6) to (1,5) is down, then (1,5) to (1,4) down, then (1,4) to (1,3) down, then (1,3) to (2,3) right. So the snake is like: from head right to (2,5), then up to (2,6), left to (1,6), down to (1,5), down to (1,4), down to (1,3), then right to tail (2,3). So it's a bit messy.\n\nHead direction is right, so at turn 40, it just moved to (3,5) from previous position. Since head direction is R, it was previously at (2,5)? Positions are given in order: head first, so before moving, head was at (2,5), and it moved right to (3,5), so now direction is R.\n\nNow, possible moves from current head (3,5):\n\n- Up: (3,6)\n\n- Down: (3,4)\n\n- Left: (2,5) but (2,5) is occupied by body, so cannot move left because it's a body segment except tail.\n\nBody collision: head cannot touch any body segment except that it can move to the tail cell because tail will move away.\n\nIn this case, (2,5) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (2,3). So moving left to (2,5) would collide with body, so invalid.\n\nSimilarly, right: (4,5) - is this within bounds? x=4, y=5, x from 0 to 7, y 0 to 7, so (4,5) should be free, but need to check walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: border walls, so (4,5) is not on border, x=4 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7, so no wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) - none at (4,5), so should be free.\n\nUp: (3,6) - y=6, not 7 or 0, x=3 not wall, no obstacle, so free.\n\nDown: (3,4) - similarly, should be free? y=4 not 0, x=3, no obstacle listed, obstacles are at (2,4) but (2,4) is different from (3,4). (2,4) is an obstacle, but (3,4) is not, so should be free.\n\nLeft: (2,5) - occupied by body, so invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R. Cannot L.\n\nNow, also, no instant reverse: current direction is R, so cannot move left, but left is already invalid, so U, D, R are possible.\n\nI need to think about food and survival.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (2,2): life span 2, so after turn 40, life span 1, then turn 41, life span 0, gone. So it can be eaten on turn 40 or 41.\n\n- (2,3): life span 4, so available until turn 43 (after turn 43, gone)\n\n- (1,3): life span 7, available until turn 46\n\n- (4,3): life span 10, available until turn 49\n\nBut (1,3) is currently occupied by a snake body segment. Snake positions include (1,3), which is the 7th segment? Positions: index 0: head (3,5), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,6), 3: (1,6), 4: (1,5), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,3), 7: (2,3) tail.\n\nSo (1,3) is occupied by the snake body. Food at (1,3) is under the body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) has food? Food list: (1,3) is listed with life span 7, value 1. But (1,3) is currently occupied by snake body segment 6.\n\nAlso, (2,3) is the tail, and there is food at (2,3) with life span 4? Food positions: (2,3) is listed with value 1, life span 4.\n\nBut (2,3) is the tail position.\n\nNow, for food under body: it can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nFor (1,3): it's under segment 6. If the snake moves, segment 6 will move to where segment 5 was or something, depending on movement.\n\nSimilarly for (2,3), but (2,3) is tail, so when snake moves, tail moves only if not growing.\n\nBut let's see the food values: all +1, so eating any is good, but with risks.\n\nNow, also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nTail is at (2,3). Head is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to (2,3). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,5) to (2,3): delta x=1, delta y=2, not adjacent; adjacent would be (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (4,5) — those are adjacent to head.\n\n(2,3) is not adjacent to (3,5). Distance: |3-2|=1, |5-3|=2, so not adjacent; only if |dx| + |dy| =1.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, I need to plan 5 turns ahead: turns 40,41,42,43,44.\n\nCurrent turn 40.\n\nFirst, possible actions at turn 40: U, D, R.\n\nI should evaluate each option.\n\nAlso, I need to think about accessing food and avoiding dead ends.\n\nList the free cells around head:\n\n- U: (3,6) - free\n\n- D: (3,4) - free\n\n- R: (4,5) - free\n\nNow, let's see where food is and how to get to them.\n\nFood at (2,2): needs to be eaten soon, life span short. To eat (2,2), head needs to go to (2,2).\n\nFrom current position (3,5), how to get to (2,2)? That would require moving left and down, but left is blocked now.\n\nPaths: one way is to go down to (3,4), then left to (2,4)? (2,4) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4), yes, (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so blocked.\n\nObstacles: (2,4) is listed, so (2,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is obstacle.\n\nSo from (3,5), to reach (2,2):\n\nOption: go down to (3,4), but (2,4) is obstacle, so from (3,4), cannot go left to (2,4), must go down to (3,3) or right, etc.\n\n(3,4) to (3,3) down, or (4,4) up-right? Directions: from (3,4), can go U to (3,5) but occupied, D to (3,3), L to (2,4) obstacle, R to (4,4).\n\nSo from (3,4), only U (but occupied, invalid), D to (3,3), R to (4,4).\n\nThen from (3,3), can go to (2,3) or (3,2) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) is tail now, but will move.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,3) is easier to reach.\n\nAlso, food at (2,3) is on tail position.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, at turn 40, I need to choose action.\n\nOption 1: Move Up to (3,6)\n\nThen snake moves: head to (3,6), body follows: (2,5) to where? When head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo after move U:\n\n- New head: (3,6)\n\n- Then segment 1: was at (2,5), but now moves to where head was, (3,5)? Positions: old positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) ]\n\nAfter move U to (3,6):\n\n- New head: (3,6)\n\n- Then body: segment 1 moves to old head position (3,5)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (2,5)\n\n- Segment 3 moves to old segment 2 position (2,6)\n\n- Segment 4 moves to old segment 3 position (1,6)\n\n- Segment 5 moves to old segment 4 position (1,5)\n\n- Segment 6 moves to old segment 5 position (1,4)\n\n- Segment 7 (tail) moves to old segment 6 position (1,3)\n\nOld segment 6 was (1,3), so tail moves to (1,3)\n\nBut (1,3) has food? Food at (1,3) is still there, but since snake is moving, tail moves to (1,3), so if food is there, it might be eaten or not? Food under body: when the body moves away, but in this case, segment 6 was at (1,3), and now it moves to (1,4)? Let's see.\n\nOld positions:\n\nIndex 0: (3,5) head\n\n1: (2,5)\n\n2: (2,6)\n\n3: (1,6)\n\n4: (1,5)\n\n5: (1,4)\n\n6: (1,3)\n\n7: (2,3) tail\n\nAfter move U to (3,6):\n\nNew positions:\n\nHead: (3,6)\n\nThen:\n\n- Segment 1: old position of head, which was (3,5)\n\n- Segment 2: old position of segment 1, which was (2,5)\n\n- Segment 3: old position of segment 2, which was (2,6)\n\n- Segment 4: old position of segment 3, which was (1,6)\n\n- Segment 5: old position of segment 4, which was (1,5)\n\n- Segment 6: old position of segment 5, which was (1,4)\n\n- Tail: old position of segment 6, which was (1,3)\n\nSo new tail at (1,3)\n\nFood at (1,3) is still there, but now occupied by tail. Not eaten because head didn't move there; body moved.\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,3) was at tail, but tail moved, so (2,3) is now free? Old tail was at (2,3), and it moved to (1,3), so (2,3) is empty now.\n\nBut food at (2,3) is still there with life span decreasing.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, so after turn 40, all food life span decrease by 1.\n\nBut for now, after move U, head at (3,6), which is free.\n\nNow, from (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid; D to (3,5), but (3,5) is now occupied by segment 1; L to (2,6), which is now occupied by segment 3? New positions: head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (1,6), etc.\n\nSo (2,6) is occupied by segment 3, so cannot move left to (2,6).\n\nR to (4,6): x=4,y=6, not wall, no obstacle, should be free.\n\nD to (3,5) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo from (3,6), possible moves: only R to (4,6), since U wall, L body, D body.\n\nU to (3,7) is wall, invalid; D to (3,5) occupied by seg1, invalid; L to (2,6) occupied by seg3, invalid; only R to (4,6) free.\n\nThen from (4,6), it might be limited.\n\nThis seems risky, might lead to dead end.\n\n(4,6) is free, but then from there, U to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5), which might be free or not.\n\n(4,5) was free before, but after snake move, let's see if occupied.\n\nAfter turn 40 move U, positions: head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (1,6), seg5 (1,5), seg6 (1,4), tail (1,3)\n\nSo (4,5) is free, (4,6) is free.\n\nFrom (4,6), can go R to (5,6), D to (4,5), L to (3,6) but occupied, U wall.\n\nSo D to (4,5) or R to (5,6).\n\nBut (4,5) is free, yes.\n\nThen it can go down, etc. But the area might be cramped.\n\nI need to consider other moves at turn 40.\n\nOption 2: Move Down to (3,4)\n\nFrom (3,5) down to (3,4)\n\nThen new positions:\n\nHead: (3,4)\n\nSeg1: old head (3,5)\n\nSeg2: old seg1 (2,5)\n\nSeg3: old seg2 (2,6)\n\nSeg4: old seg3 (1,6)\n\nSeg5: old seg4 (1,5)\n\nSeg6: old seg5 (1,4)\n\nTail: old seg6 (1,3)  // seg6 was (1,3), so tail to (1,3)\n\nFood at (1,3) now occupied by tail.\n\n(2,3) is free now.\n\nFrom head at (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) occupied by seg1, invalid; D to (3,3); L to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, invalid; R to (4,4)\n\nSo only D to (3,3) or R to (4,4)\n\n(3,3) and (4,4) should be free.\n\nOption 3: Move Right to (4,5)\n\nFrom (3,5) right to (4,5)\n\nNew positions:\n\nHead: (4,5)\n\nSeg1: old head (3,5)\n\nSeg2: old seg1 (2,5)\n\nSeg3: old seg2 (2,6)\n\nSeg4: old seg3 (1,6)\n\nSeg5: old seg4 (1,5)\n\nSeg6: old seg5 (1,4)\n\nTail: old seg6 (1,3)\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) occupied by seg1, invalid; R to (5,5)\n\nAll U, D, R possible? (4,6) free, (4,4) free, (5,5) free? Obstacles: (5,1) but not (5,5), so yes.\n\nNow, food at (4,3) is close, life span 10, so not urgent.\n\nFood at (2,2) is urgent, life span 2, so must be eaten in next 2 turns or lost.\n\nTo eat (2,2), from current position (3,5), it's tricky because (2,4) is obstacle, so direct path is blocked.\n\nPossible to go down to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then left to (2,3) or down to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) has food, and is currently tail, but after moves, it changes.\n\nLet's think about turn 40 and 41 to eat (2,2).\n\nAt turn 40, if I move down to (3,4), then at turn 41, from (3,4), I can move down to (3,3), then at turn 42, to (2,3) or (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,2) life span 2: at turn 40, life span 2, after turn 40, it becomes 1, so can be eaten on turn 41. If not eaten by turn 41, after turn 41 it disappears.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 40, life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 40 or 41; after turn 41, life span 0, gone.\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nSo for (2,2), must be eaten on turn 40 or 41.\n\nBut to eat on turn 40, head needs to be at (2,2) on turn 40, but from (3,5), it's not adjacent; adjacent cells are (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5) — none is (2,2), so impossible to eat on turn 40.\n\nMust eat on turn 41.\n\nSo on turn 41, head must be at (2,2).\n\nWhere is head on turn 40 after move?\n\nAfter turn 40 action, head position determines where it can be on turn 41.\n\nLet P40 be head position after turn 40 move.\n\nThen on turn 41, from P40, head can move to adjacent cell to be at (2,2).\n\nSo for head to be at (2,2) on turn 41, on turn 40, head must be at a cell adjacent to (2,2), so (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), or (3,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, internal obstacle, so invalid.\n\n(2,1): y=1, not wall, but is it free? No obstacles listed except (1,2), but (2,1) not listed, so should be free, but y=1, not border wall? Border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (2,1) is within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, (2,1) not listed, so free.\n\n(2,3): currently has food, and is tail position.\n\n(3,2): should be free.\n\nSo possible cells for P40: (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)\n\nBut P40 is after turn 40 move from current (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,5), can I reach (2,1), (2,3), or (3,2) in one move? No, P40 is the position after turn 40 move, so from (3,5), moving to U (3,6), D (3,4), R (4,5) — none of which is adjacent to (2,2).\n\n(3,4) is adjacent to (3,3) and (2,4), etc, but not to (2,2).\n\n(3,4) to (2,2) is not adjacent; |dx|=1, |dy|=2.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) to (2,2) is farther.\n\nSo from any of the possible moves at turn 40, I cannot be adjacent to (2,2) on turn 40, so I cannot reach (2,2) on turn 41.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (2,2) because it will disappear after turn 41, and I can't get there on turn 40 or 41.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\n- Turn 40: head at (3,5)\n\nAfter move, to (3,6), (3,4), or (4,5)\n\nNone of these is adjacent to (2,2).\n\nThen on turn 41, from say (3,4), I can go to (3,3), (3,5) occupied, (2,4) obstacle, (4,4), so not to (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,6), to (4,6) only, then from (4,6) to (4,5) or (4,7) wall or (5,6), not to (2,2).\n\nFrom (4,5), to (4,4), (4,6), (5,5), not to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is two moves away, and with obstacles, no direct path.\n\nFor example, to go to (2,2) from (3,5), need at least two moves, but on turn 41, from P40, I need to be at (2,2), but P40 is not adjacent, so minimum two moves to reach (2,2) from (3,5), which would be on turn 42, but by then food is gone.\n\nTurn 40 move to, say, (3,4), then turn 41 to (3,3), then turn 42 to (2,3) or (3,2) or (4,3), but (2,2) on turn 42 is too late, as it disappears after turn 41.\n\nAfter turn 41, life span 0, gone. So last chance to eat is turn 41.\n\nBut on turn 41, head cannot be at (2,2) from any P40 position.\n\nTherefore, food at (2,2) cannot be eaten; it will be lost.\n\nSo I should ignore that food and focus on others.\n\nNow, other foods: (2,3) life span 4, so available until turn 43 (after turn 43 gone)\n\n(1,3) life span 7, until turn 46\n\n(4,3) life span 10, until turn 49\n\nBut (1,3) is under body, so need to access it later.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is currently tail, but will move.\n\nNow, back to turn 40 actions.\n\nI need to think long-term survival.\n\nThe snake is in the top-left area, and there are obstacles.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail (2,3)\n\nFood: (2,2) - but will be gone soon, ignore.\n\n(2,3) - on current tail\n\n(1,3) - on current body segment 6\n\n(4,3) - free\n\nNow, to eat (2,3), it can be eaten if head moves to it when it's free.\n\nSimilarly for (1,3).\n\nAt turn 40, after move, tail moves, so (2,3) becomes free.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (3,4) at turn 40.\n\nThen new head (3,4), tail at (1,3)\n\n(2,3) is now free, with food.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move to (2,3) on turn 41? (2,3) is adjacent to (3,4)? (3,4) to (2,3) is left and down, |dx|=1, |dy|=1, not adjacent; adjacent cells share edge, so (3,4) adjacent: (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4)\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so (2,3) is not adjacent to (3,4).\n\n(2,3) is at x=2,y=3, adjacent cells: (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3)\n\n(1,3) now occupied by tail, (2,2) food, (2,4) obstacle, (3,3) free.\n\nSo from (3,4), to reach (2,3), I need to go to (3,3) first.\n\nSimilarly, if I move right to (4,5), then from (4,5), far from (2,3).\n\nOr up to (3,6), then farther.\n\nSo at turn 40, moving down to (3,4) might be good to go down towards (4,3) or to access the area.\n\n(4,3) has food with long life span.\n\nAlso, the snake body is taking space.\n\nI should consider the space available.\n\nAfter moving down to (3,4), at turn 40.\n\nThen at turn 41, from (3,4), I can move down to (3,3) or right to (4,4).\n\nIf to (3,3), then from there, I can go to (2,3) or (3,2) or (4,3).\n\n(2,3) has food, and from (3,3) to (2,3) is left, adjacent.\n\nAnd at that point, (2,3) should be free, since tail moved away.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is also accessible.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger.\n\nIf I eat (2,3), and if head is adjacent to tail, but tail is at (1,3), head at (2,3), are they adjacent? (2,3) and (1,3) are adjacent, yes.\n\nIf I move to (2,3) on turn 41, and eat the food, snake grows, so when I eat, length increases by 1, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays, and body doesn't move that turn.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nAnd \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, when I eat at (2,3), the tail is currently at (1,3), which is adjacent to (2,3).\n\nSo if I eat (2,3), head moves to (2,3), food eaten, length +1, so new segment is added, and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so tail remains at (1,3), and head is at (2,3), which are adjacent, so they collide, snake dies.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (2,3) when the tail is at (1,3) and adjacent.\n\nTo eat (2,3) safely, I need the tail not to be adjacent when I eat it.\n\nCurrently, after turn 40 move down, tail is at (1,3).\n\nIf I go to (2,3) on turn 41, head at (2,3), tail at (1,3), adjacent, so eating would kill.\n\nSo I should not do that.\n\nInstead, I can move to other places.\n\nFor example, from (3,4), go down to (3,3) on turn 41.\n\nThen at turn 41, head at (3,3), tail at (1,3) still? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 40 move down to (3,4):\n\nPositions: head (3,4), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (1,6), seg5 (1,5), seg6 (1,4), tail (1,3)\n\nAt turn 41, move down to (3,3):\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nSeg1: old head (3,4)\n\nSeg2: old seg1 (3,5)\n\nSeg3: old seg2 (2,5)\n\nSeg4: old seg3 (2,6)\n\nSeg5: old seg4 (1,6)\n\nSeg6: old seg5 (1,5)\n\nTail: old seg6 (1,4)  // since seg6 was (1,4), tail moves to (1,4)\n\nOld seg6 was (1,4), so tail moves to (1,4)\n\nThen (1,3) is now free, but it has food at (1,3), which is under where seg6 was, but now seg6 moved to (1,5)? New positions: head (3,3), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,6), seg5 (1,6), seg6 (1,5), tail (1,4)\n\nSo (1,3) is free now, and food is there.\n\nFrom head (3,3), I can move to (2,3) or (3,2) or (4,3), etc.\n\n(2,3) has food, and it's free, since tail moved away.\n\nTail is at (1,4), head at (3,3), not adjacent.\n\nIf I move to (2,3) on turn 41, from (3,3) left to (2,3), eat the food.\n\nThen head at (2,3), food eaten, length +1, so new tail segment added, but since I ate, the body doesn't move, so positions: head at (2,3), then segments: seg1 at (3,3)? After move to (2,3), new head (2,3), and since ate food, the tail doesn't move, so the body positions remain as before the move, but new segment added at the tail.\n\nBefore move at turn 41, positions: head (3,3), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,5), ..., tail (1,4)\n\nAfter moving left to (2,3) and eating:\n\nNew head: (2,3)\n\nThen body: seg1 at old head position (3,3)\n\nSeg2 at old seg1 position (3,4)\n\nSeg3 at old seg2 position (3,5)\n\nSeg4 at old seg3 position (2,5)\n\nSeg5 at old seg4 position (2,6)\n\nSeg6 at old seg5 position (1,6)\n\nAnd new segment added at old tail position (1,4), so now tail at (1,4)\n\nHead at (2,3), tail at (1,4), are they adjacent? (2,3) and (1,4), |dx|=1, |dy|=1, not adjacent; adjacent would be (1,3), (2,4), (2,2), (3,3) — not (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is diagonal, not adjacent, so no collision.\n\nThen snake is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to (4,3) later.\n\nBut at turn 40, if I move down to (3,4), then at turn 41, I can go to (3,3), then to (2,3) on turn 42 or something.\n\nFrom above, at turn 41 after moving to (3,3), I can immediately go to (2,3) to eat.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn 40, move D to (3,4)\n\nThen at turn 41, from (3,4), I move D to (3,3) — but in my earlier, I have option to move to (3,3) or (4,4)\n\nIf I move to (3,3) at turn 41, then from (3,3), I can move to (2,3) at turn 42.\n\nBut at turn 41, when I move to (3,3), the food at (2,3) is still there, life span decreasing.\n\nAfter turn 40, life span of (2,3) was 4, after turn 40, becomes 3, then after turn 41, becomes 2, etc.\n\nBut I can eat it on turn 42.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3), I can also go to (4,3) or (3,2), etc.\n\nBut let's plan the moves.\n\nFirst, for turn 40, moving down seems reasonable.\n\nIf I move right to (4,5), then I can go towards (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is at y=3, so I need to go down.\n\nFrom (4,5), move D to (4,4) or U to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) is below.\n\nMoving up to (3,6) seems bad because it leads to a corner.\n\n(3,6) then only right to (4,6), then from (4,6), down to (4,5) or right to (5,6), but (4,5) might be occupied later, but initially free.\n\nBut the area is smaller.\n\nWhereas down or right opens more space.\n\nNow, also, food at (1,3) is under body, and it was exposed when we moved, but in the down move, at turn 40, after move, (1,3) is occupied by tail, so not accessible.\n\nThen at turn 41, when we move, tail moves, (1,3) free.\n\nIn the sequence with move down at 40:\n\nTurn 40: move D to (3,4)\n\nPositions: head (3,4), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,3)\n\nFood at (1,3) under tail.\n\nTurn 41: move from (3,4) to, say, (3,3) D\n\nThen new head (3,3)\n\nSeg1 (3,4)\n\nSeg2 (3,5)\n\nSeg3 (2,5)\n\nSeg4 (2,6)\n\nSeg5 (1,6)\n\nSeg6 (1,5)\n\nTail (1,4)  // old seg6 was (1,4)? Before move, seg6 was (1,4), so tail moves to (1,4)\n\nThen (1,3) is free, food there.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move to (2,3) L, or (3,2) D, or (4,3) R.\n\n(2,3) has food, and it's free.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3) on turn 41, eat food.\n\nHead to (2,3), since ate, length +1, so body doesn't move, new tail at old tail position (1,4)\n\nPositions before move: head (3,3), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,6), seg5 (1,6), seg6 (1,5), tail (1,4)\n\nAfter move to (2,3) and eat:\n\nNew head: (2,3)\n\nSeg1: old head (3,3)\n\nSeg2: old seg1 (3,4)\n\nSeg3: old seg2 (3,5)\n\nSeg4: old seg3 (2,5)\n\nSeg5: old seg4 (2,6)\n\nSeg6: old seg5 (1,6)\n\nNew segment: at old tail (1,4), so seg7 (1,4), tail (1,4)\n\nHead at (2,3), tail at (1,4), not adjacent, safe.\n\nAnd food at (2,3) eaten.\n\nNow, food at (1,3) is still there, I can eat it later.\n\nBut at this point, on turn 41, after eating (2,3), head at (2,3), I can move to (1,3) on next turn, but (1,3) is adjacent and has food.\n\nIf I move to (1,3) on turn 42, head to (1,3), eat food.\n\nBut tail is at (1,4), which is adjacent to (1,3)? (1,3) and (1,4) are adjacent vertically.\n\nIf I eat at (1,3), head at (1,3), tail at (1,4), adjacent, so collision, danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, but here the food is at head cell when eaten, not tail cell.\n\nThe rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut when I eat at (1,3), the tail cell is (1,4), which may or may not have food.\n\nIn this case, (1,4) does not have food; food is at (1,3).\n\nSo eating at (1,3) is fine, as long as tail is not adjacent or something.\n\nWhen I move to (1,3), if tail is at (1,4), they are adjacent, but after eating, since I eat, the tail doesn't move, so head at (1,3), tail at (1,4), adjacent, so they collide, snake dies.\n\nYes, because head and tail are adjacent after move, and since tail doesn't move, collision.\n\nCollision if head touches any body segment, including tail.\n\nSo if head moves to a cell adjacent to tail, and then after eating, tail stays, head is next to tail, collision.\n\nTherefore, to eat safely, head should not be adjacent to tail when eating, so that after eating, with tail staying, no collision.\n\nIn this case, from (2,3), tail at (1,4), not adjacent, so if I eat at (2,3), no problem.\n\nThen if I want to eat at (1,3), from (2,3), move to (1,3), but (1,3) is adjacent to tail at (1,4), so if I move there, even before eating, when I move to (1,3), it might be adjacent to tail, but tail is at (1,4), which is adjacent, so moving to (1,3) would cause head to be at (1,3), tail at (1,4), adjacent, so collision immediately, without eating.\n\nBecause head touches tail segment.\n\nUnless the tail moves away, but when I move to (1,3), if tail is at (1,4), and I move left to (1,3), but (1,4) is tail, so head moving to (1,3) would be adjacent to tail at (1,4), so collision.\n\nTo avoid, I need that when I move to (1,3), tail is not at (1,4), meaning tail has moved.\n\nBut in the sequence, it might be possible with timing.\n\nFor now, at turn 40, moving down seems ok.\n\nIf I move right at turn 40 to (4,5)\n\nThen positions: head (4,5), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (1,6), seg5 (1,5), seg6 (1,4), tail (1,3)\n\nThen at turn 41, from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), or U to (4,6), R to (5,5), etc.\n\nThen I can go to (4,3) later to eat that food.\n\n(4,3) life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I have food at (2,3) and (1,3) which might be eaten sooner.\n\nLife span (2,3): after turn 40, life 3, so until turn 43.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) life 7 until turn 46.\n\nSo I can go for (2,3) first.\n\nWith move down at turn 40, I can reach (2,3) by turn 41 or 42.\n\nEarlier with move down to (3,4) at 40, then to (3,3) at 41, then to (2,3) at 42.\n\nAt turn 42, from (3,3) to (2,3), eat.\n\nAfter turn 40, (2,3) life: turn 40 life 4, after turn 40, life 3; after turn 41, life 2; after turn 42, if eaten on turn 42, life 2, then after eat, life decreases but eaten.\n\nOn turn 42, before move, life span of (2,3) is 2? Turn 40: start life 4\n\nAfter turn 40, life decreases to 3\n\nAfter turn 41, decreases to 2\n\nOn turn 42, before action, life is 2, so can be eaten on turn 42.\n\nAfter turn 42, decreases to 1, but if eaten, it's consumed.\n\nSimilarly, if not eaten, after turn 42, life 1, then after turn 43, life 0, gone.\n\nBut since eaten on turn 42, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, with the sequence: turn 40 move D to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 41 move D to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 42 move L to (2,3) and eat.\n\nSafe, as before.\n\nThen after that, head at (2,3), I can consider eating (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is adjacent to (2,3), and tail is at (1,4), not adjacent.\n\nIf I move to (1,3) on turn 43, head to (1,3), which is adjacent to tail at (1,4), so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move directly to (1,3) from (2,3); I need to go around or wait for tail to move.\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4) but obstacle, invalid; D to (2,2) but (2,2) food gone or not, but we ignored; L to (1,3) but adjacent to tail; R to (3,3) which is body.\n\nAfter eating at (2,3), positions: head (2,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (1,6), seg7 (1,4) tail? Earlier: after eat at turn 42, positions:\n\nBefore move turn 42: head at (3,3), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,6), seg5 (1,6), seg6 (1,5), tail (1,4)\n\nAfter move to (2,3) and eat:\n\nNew head: (2,3)\n\nSeg1: old head (3,3)\n\nSeg2: old seg1 (3,4)\n\nSeg3: old seg2 (3,5)\n\nSeg4: old seg3 (2,5)\n\nSeg5: old seg4 (2,6)\n\nSeg6: old seg5 (1,6)\n\nNew segment: at old tail (1,4), so seg7: (1,4)\n\nTail: (1,4)\n\nNow head at (2,3), tail at (1,4)\n\nPossible moves from (2,3): U to (2,4) obstacle, invalid; D to (2,2) - if food still, but life span, after turn 42, (2,2) gone; (2,2) life span 2, after turn 40 life 1, after turn 41 life 0, gone, so (2,2) not there.\n\nL to (1,3) - (1,3) has food, and it's free? (1,3) is not occupied now, positions: (1,3) free, food there.\n\nBut moving to (1,3): head to (1,3), which is adjacent to tail at (1,4), since same x, y-1, so adjacent, collision.\n\nR to (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied by seg1, invalid.\n\nNo other moves, so only possible is L to (1,3) but causes collision, or stay, but must move.\n\nSo stuck? Cannot move without collision.\n\nTherefore, after eating at (2,3), from (2,3), I have no safe move except to (1,3) which kills me.\n\nBut (1,3) has food, but if I eat it, I might die or not.\n\nIf I move to (1,3), head to (1,3), which is adjacent to tail at (1,4), so collision when I move there, before eating.\n\nThe moment head moves to (1,3), it touches tail at (1,4), so dies immediately.\n\nCannot even eat.\n\nTherefore, this path is bad; I should not go to (2,3) when tail is at (1,4).\n\nNeed to avoid that situation.\n\nPerhaps at turn 40, move differently.\n\nMaybe move right to (4,5) at turn 40, then go to (4,3) to eat that food.\n\n(4,3) is free, no issue.\n\nThen later go to other foods.\n\nBut (2,3) and (1,3) have shorter life, but not critical.\n\nLife span (2,3): until turn 43, (1,3) until turn 46.\n\nTurn 40, after move to (4,5), then I can go down to (4,4) at turn 41, then to (4,3) at turn 42 and eat.\n\nThen head at (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) is at (4,3), life span 10, so on turn 42, it's fine.\n\nThen after that, I can go left to (3,3), etc, to access (1,3) and (2,3).\n\nBut (2,3) might expire soon.\n\nTurn 40: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 41: move D to (4,4)  (assuming)\n\nTurn 42: move D to (4,3) and eat.\n\nThen after, head at (4,3), tail at (1,4) or where.\n\nPositions after turn 40 move R: head (4,5), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (1,6), seg5 (1,5), seg6 (1,4), tail (1,3)\n\nTurn 41 move D to (4,4): new head (4,4), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,6), seg5 (1,6), seg6 (1,5), tail (1,4)  // old seg6 (1,4), tail to (1,4)\n\nTurn 42 move D to (4,3): new head (4,3), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (1,6), tail (1,5)  // old seg6 (1,5), tail to (1,5)\n\nEat at (4,3), so new segment at old tail (1,5), so tail at (1,5)\n\nHead at (4,3), not near tail.\n\nThen from (4,3), can go L to (3,3), U to (4,4) occupied, D to (4,2), R to (5,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) might be free, then to (2,3) etc.\n\nBut (2,3) food: after turn 42, life span was 4-3=1? Turn 40 life 4, after turn 40 life 3, after turn 41 life 2, after turn 42 life 1, so on turn 43, can be eaten.\n\nIf I go to (2,3) on turn 43.\n\nFrom (4,3) at turn 42, move L to (3,3) at turn 43? Turn 43 action.\n\nTurn 42 head at (4,3), after eating.\n\nTurn 43: from (4,3), move L to (3,3)\n\nThen head to (3,3), which should be free? Positions after turn 42: head (4,3), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (1,6), seg7 (1,5) tail\n\n(3,3) is free, no problem.\n\nMove to (3,3), then on turn 44, to (2,3) or (3,2), etc.\n\nTo (2,3) on turn 44, but (2,3) life: after turn 43, life 1-1=0? Turn 42 life 1, after turn 42 decrease to 0, gone, so on turn 43, before move, life 1, can be eaten on turn 43.\n\nBut on turn 43, head is at (4,3), not at (2,3).\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 43, I can move to (3,3), but not directly to (2,3).\n\nSo on turn 43, I can be at (3,3), then on turn 44 to (2,3), but (2,3) gone after turn 43.\n\nAfter turn 43, life 0, so last eat on turn 43.\n\nBut on turn 43, from (4,3), I can only move to adjacent, not to (2,3), so cannot eat (2,3) if I go right first.\n\nTherefore, to eat (2,3), I need to be closer earlier.\n\nBack to turn 40, moving down allows me to eat (2,3) on turn 42, as I had.\n\nBut with the collision problem at (2,3) with tail at (1,4).\n\nTo avoid that, I need to ensure that when I eat at (2,3), the tail is not at (1,4) or adjacent.\n\nIn the down move sequence, when I eat at (2,3) on turn 42, tail is at (1,4), which is not adjacent to (2,3), as |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so no collision, safe.\n\nThen from (2,3), I cannot move to (1,3) because it causes collision.\n\nBut I can move other directions, but from (2,3), only possible move is L to (1,3), which is fatal, or U obstacle, D to (2,2) gone, R to (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo no safe move.\n\nTherefore, I must not eat at (2,3) when at that position.\n\nSo perhaps I should not go for (2,3) at all, or eat it later with different tail position.\n\nFor example, if I move up or right first, but then I might miss it.\n\nAt turn 40, move down to (3,4), then at turn 41, instead of down to (3,3), move right to (4,4).\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go down to (4,3) to eat that food.\n\n(4,3) life long.\n\nThen later, (2,3) might expire.\n\nBut let's accept that (2,3) cannot be eaten safely or I miss it.\n\nFood at (1,3) can be eaten later.\n\nLife span 7, so until turn 46.\n\nTurn 40, move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 41, move R to (4,4)\n\nThen positions: turn 40 move D to (3,4): head (3,4), body as before\n\nTurn 41 move R to (4,4): new head (4,4), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,6), seg5 (1,6), seg6 (1,5), tail (1,4)\n\nThen from (4,4), can move D to (4,3) or U to (4,5) or R to (5,4), etc.\n\nMove D to (4,3) on turn 42, eat food there.\n\nThen head at (4,3), etc.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen from there, I can go left to (3,3), then to (2,3) but it may be gone, or to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is available until turn 46.\n\nAfter eating at (4,3), head at (4,3), on turn 43 move L to (3,3), then turn 44 to (2,3) if food still, but (2,3) gone, or to (3,2), etc.\n\nThen to (2,3) not available, so go to (1,3) via (2,3) or other.\n\nFrom (3,3), move L to (2,3), but (2,3) no food or gone, then to (1,3) but may be adjacent to tail.\n\nBut tail is far, at (1,4) or something.\n\nLet's not worry.\n\nFor turn 40, moving down or right both seem possible, but moving up is bad.\n\nMoving down allows me to access the lower area.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,3) which is good.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating all food is good, but (2,2) lost, (2,3) might be lost or risky.\n\nAnother option: at turn 40, move down to (3,4), then turn 41 move down to (3,3), then turn 42 move R to (4,3) to eat (4,3).\n\nThen head at (4,3), and (2,3) still there with life 2 on turn 42, so on turn 43, from (4,3) to (3,3), then turn 44 to (2,3), but on turn 44, (2,3) life: after turn 42 life 2-1=1, after turn 43 life 0, gone, so on turn 44 cannot eat.\n\nTurn 43 from (4,3) to (3,3), then (2,3) is not adjacent from (3,3), so on turn 44 to (2,3), but gone.\n\nSo cannot eat (2,3) if I go for (4,3) first.\n\nTherefore, the only way to eat (2,3) is to go for it directly from the down move, but then I have the problem at (2,3) with no move.\n\nUnless after eating at (2,3), I can move, but in that position, I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (1,3) first or something.\n\nBut (1,3) is under body, hard to access.\n\nAt turn 40, after move down, (1,3) is occupied by tail.\n\nAt turn 41, after move to (3,3) or (4,4), tail moves, (1,3) free.\n\nFor example, turn 40 move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 41 move R to (4,4)\n\nThen as above, tail at (1,4), (1,3) free.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move to (4,3) or other.\n\nBut to eat (1,3), I need to go to (1,3).\n\nFrom (4,4), it's far.\n\nFrom (3,3) if I had moved there.\n\nBut at turn 41, from (3,4), if I move to (3,3), then (1,3) is free, and I can move to (2,3) or (1,3) from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), move to (1,3) not adjacent; need to go to (2,3) first or (3,2).\n\nBut (2,3) is there.\n\nIf I move to (2,3) on turn 42, eat, then have the problem.\n\nIf I move directly to (1,3) from (3,3), not possible.\n\nSo I think it's better to avoid the area and go for the safe food at (4,3).\n\nAt turn 40, move right to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then to (4,3) by turn 42.\n\nEat (4,3), then the snake is in better position to explore.\n\nThe food at (2,3) will be lost, but it's only +1, and survival is more important.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) can be eaten later if possible.\n\nLife span 7, so by turn 46, I can go there.\n\nAfter eating (4,3), head at (4,3), I can move left to (3,3), then to (2,3) but gone, or to (3,2), then to (2,2) gone, or to (1,2) obstacle, so to (2,3) not available, so go to (1,3) via (2,3) or (1,4) etc.\n\nFrom (3,3), move to (2,3) empty, then to (1,3) but if tail is not adjacent.\n\nBut tail might be far.\n\nFor example, after eating at (4,3) on turn 42, positions: head (4,3), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (1,6), tail (1,5) or something.\n\nEarlier with move right then down.\n\nTurn 40 move R to (4,5): head (4,5), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (1,6), seg5 (1,5), seg6 (1,4), tail (1,3)\n\nTurn 41 move D to (4,4): head (4,4), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,6), seg5 (1,6), seg6 (1,5), tail (1,4)\n\nTurn 42 move D to (4,3) and eat: head (4,3), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (1,6), new segment at old tail (1,4), so seg7 (1,4), tail (1,4)\n\nHead at (4,3), tail at (1,4)\n\nThen turn 43 move L to (3,3): head to (3,3), which is free? Positions: (3,3) not occupied, so new head (3,3), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (2,6), seg7 (1,6), tail (1,4)  // tail moved to old seg7 position? After move, body moves.\n\nAfter move to (3,3), new head (3,3), seg1 old head (4,3), seg2 old seg1 (4,4), seg3 old seg2 (4,5), seg4 old seg3 (3,5), seg5 old seg4 (2,5), seg6 old seg5 (2,6), seg7 old seg6 (1,6), tail old seg7 (1,4)\n\nSo tail at (1,4)\n\n(1,3) is free, food there.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move L to (2,3) or D to (3,2) or R to (4,3) occupied, U to (3,4) occupied.\n\n(2,3) is free, no food, or food gone.\n\nMove to (2,3) on turn 44: head to (2,3), which is free, no collision.\n\nThen from (2,3), can move to (1,3) on turn 45.\n\nHead to (1,3), eat food.\n\nNow, tail is at (1,4), which is adjacent to (1,3), so when I move to (1,3), head at (1,3), tail at (1,4), adjacent, collision.\n\nAgain, problem.\n\nTo avoid, I need to move the tail away first.\n\nFor example, after at (3,3), instead of going to (2,3), go down to (3,2), then left to (2,2) gone, or right, but (2,2) gone, so to (3,1) or something, but (5,1) obstacle, etc.\n\nBut not towards (1,3).\n\nPerhaps I can eat (1,3) when tail is not at (1,4).\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nFor turn 40, I think moving right is safer to eat (4,3) and avoid the risky area.\n\nOr moving down is similar.\n\nBut let's decide on turn 40 action.\n\nSince head direction is R, and I can move R to (4,5), which is free.\n\nThen I can go down to (4,4), then to (4,3).\n\nFor long-term, the grid has obstacles, so I need to find a path.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 40, move up to (3,6), but then only right to (4,6), then I can go down to (4,5), but (4,5) may be occupied, but after move, it might be free for a while.\n\nBut it's tighter space.\n\nI think down or right is better.\n\nI'll go with move right at turn 40 to (4,5), then plan subsequent moves.\n\nBut the answer needs to specify actions for turn 40 to at least turn 44, 5 turns.\n\nTurn 40,41,42,43,44.\n\nBut I can plan step by step.\n\nSince the state changes, I need to think generally.\n\nPerhaps for turn 40, move R.\n\nThen for turn 41, from (4,5), move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 42, move D to (4,3) and eat.\n\nThen turn 43, from (4,3), move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 44, from (3,3), move L to (2,3) or D to (3,2), but (2,3) food gone, so say move D to (3,2) if free.\n\nBut I need to check if safe.\n\nSince the grid is small, and for the answer, I can write the moves.\n\nBut let's do it.\n\nTurn 40: R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 41: D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 42: D to (4,3) eat food\n\nThen turn 43: L to (3,3)\n\nFrom (4,3), after move L to (3,3), as above.\n\nThen turn 44: from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4) may be occupied, in positions after turn 43, (3,4) is occupied by seg2 or something.\n\nAfter turn 43 move L to (3,3):\n\nPositions after turn 42 eat at (4,3): head (4,3), body seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (1,6), seg7 (1,4) tail\n\nTurn 43 move L to (3,3): new head (3,3), seg1 old head (4,3), seg2 old seg1 (4,4), seg3 old seg2 (4,5), seg4 old seg3 (3,5), seg5 old seg4 (2,5), seg6 old seg5 (2,6), seg7 old seg6 (1,6), tail old seg7 (1,4)\n\nSo cells: (3,3) head, (4,3) seg1, (4,4) seg2, (4,5) seg3, (3,5) seg4, (2,5) seg5, (2,6) seg6, (1,6) seg7, tail (1,4)\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4) but (3,4) is seg2? Seg2 at (4,4), (3,4) is free? (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nPositions: (3,4) not occupied, so U to (3,4) possible.\n\nD to (3,2)\n\nL to (2,3) - (2,3) free, no food\n\nR to (4,3) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo U, D, L possible.\n\nTurn 44, say move L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 45 to (1,3) if possible, but may have collision risk.\n\nBut for now, for the answer, I can specify up to turn 44.\n\nThe instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but answer format is to list actions for the turns starting from t1.\n\nFor turn 40, action R.\n\nThen for turn 41, based on state, but since state changes, I need to output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can output a sequence assuming no other changes.\n\nBut food life span decreases, so I need to consider.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll go with move down at turn 40, then to (4,4) etc.\n\nTurn 40: move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 41: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 42: move D to (4,3) and eat\n\nTurn 43: move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 44: move U to (3,4) or D to (3,2), say D to (3,2) if free.\n\nBut (3,2) should be free.\n\nThen it's safe.\n\nAnd (2,3) food lost, but survival ok.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) can be eaten later if possible.\n\nSo for turn 40, action D.\n\nThen the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm the head direction.\n\nAt turn 40, head direction is R, moving right.\n\nIf I move down, it's changing direction, but no instant reverse, but down is not reverse, so ok.\n\nReverse would be left, which is invalid.\n\nSo move down is fine.\n\nI think D is good.\n\nSo for turn 40: D\n\nThen for turn 41, from (3,4), move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 42, from (4,4), move D to (4,3) eat\n\nTurn 43, from (4,3), move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 44, from (3,3), move D to (3,2) or U to (3,4), but (3,4) might be free, but in positions, after turn 43, (3,4) may be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 42 eat at (4,3): head (4,3), body seg1 (4,4), seg2 (3,4)? Let's see positions.\n\nTurn 40 move D to (3,4): head (3,4), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (1,6), seg5 (1,5), seg6 (1,4), tail (1,3)\n\nTurn 41 move R to (4,4): new head (4,4), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (2,6), seg5 (1,6), seg6 (1,5), tail (1,4)\n\nTurn 42 move D to (4,3): new head (4,3), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (1,6), tail (1,5)  // old seg6 (1,5), tail to (1,5)\n\nEat at (4,3), so new segment at old tail (1,5), so seg7 (1,5), tail (1,5)\n\nHead at (4,3)\n\nTurn 43 move L to (3,3): new head (3,3), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (3,4), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (2,6), seg7 (1,6), tail (1,5)\n\n(3,3) head, (4,3) seg1, (4,4) seg2, (3,4) seg3, etc.\n\nFrom (3,3), turn 44 move D to (3,2): should be free, no obstacle, not border.\n\nThen ok.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: R\n\nTurn 42: D\n\nTurn 43: L\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nAnd for turn 45, can be to (3,1) or (2,2) etc, but not specified.\n\nBut for the answer, up to turn 44 is 5 turns from 40.\n\nTurn 40,41,42,43,44 is 5 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be safe, I can do this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned moves for at least 5 turns ahead (turns 40 to 44). The key considerations are:\n- Food at (2,2) cannot be eaten due to its short life span (disappears after turn 41) and inaccessible position.\n- Food at (2,3) is risky to eat because it may lead to a collision with the tail if not timed properly; it expires after turn 43 but is deprioritized for safety.\n- Food at (1,3) is under the body and can be eaten later (life span until turn 46), but accessing it safely requires careful planning to avoid tail collision.\n- Food at (4,3) is safe, has a long life span (until turn 49), and is reachable, making it the primary target for immediate scoring.\n- Moving down (D) at turn 40 avoids the cramped top-left area, opens space for movement, and positions the snake to reach (4,3) efficiently.\n- Subsequent moves are planned to eat (4,3) on turn 42 and then navigate to safer areas, avoiding obstacles and body collisions.\n\n**Planned Moves (5 turns ahead):**\n- **Turn 40: D (down)** – Move to (3,4). This avoids the risk of moving up (into a corner) or right (delaying access to (4,3)). It positions the snake to start descending toward the safer food at (4,3).\n- **Turn 41: R (right)** – Move to (4,4). From (3,4), moving right to (4,4) is safe and progresses toward (4,3). Moving down to (3,3) is possible but would delay reaching (4,3) and risk missing it if other foods are pursued.\n- **Turn 42: D (down)** – Move to (4,3) and eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases). (4,3) is now accessible, free, and has a high life span. Eating it now maximizes points without immediate risk.\n- **Turn 43: L (left)** – Move to (3,3). After eating, moving left to (3,3) avoids potential collisions and opens options for future moves. The area around (3,3) is relatively free, and this move starts navigating away from the tail and obstacles.\n- **Turn 44: D (down)** – Move to (3,2). From (3,3), moving down to (3,2) is safe (no walls or obstacles) and positions the snake for further exploration. This avoids moving left toward the risky (1,3) food or up where body segments may be.\n\n**Reasoning for Long-Term Survival:**\n- This sequence ensures the snake eats at least one positive food ((4,3)) while avoiding areas where tail collision or dead ends are likely (e.g., near (1,3) or (2,3)).\n- By turn 44, the snake is in a more open area (lower grid), with access to future food opportunities. Food at (1,3) can be targeted after turn 44 if the tail position allows safe access (e.g., by ensuring the tail is not adjacent when eating).\n- The moves prioritize grid control: moving down initially creates space, and the path avoids obstacles like (2,4) and (1,2).\n- Risks like \"tail reward danger\" are mitigated: at no point is the head forced into a position adjacent to the tail when eating food, as (4,3) was eaten safely with tail distant.\n\nThis plan scores +1 immediately and sets up for potential future points while minimizing danger over 5+ turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 40: D (down)\nTurn 41: R (right)\nTurn 42: D (down)\nTurn 43: L (left)\nTurn 44: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 2D grid. The grid has walls and internal obstacles. From the state, the border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). I need to avoid these when moving.\n\nThe snake positions are given: head at (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So the head is at (3,4) and the tail is at (1,3). The head direction is down, which is D, meaning (x,y-1). Since it's down, moving down decreases y.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so I can't move up (U) next because that would be an instant reverse. So possible moves are L, R, or D. But I need to check what's safe.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (2,2) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (2,3) with value 1, life span 3\n\n- (1,3) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (4,3) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food. Life span indicates how many turns left, including current turn, so (2,2) will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Life span decreases every turn.\n\nAlso, special case: food can be under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. For example, (1,3) has food, but (1,3) is also the tail of the snake. Snake positions include (1,3) as the last segment, so the tail is at (1,3) with food on it.\n\nBut according to the rules, if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills because the head and newly grown tail collide. So I need to be careful with that.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,4)\n\nPossible moves from here: since direction is D, I can go L, R, or D. U is reverse, not allowed.\n\n- Left (L): (x-1,y) so (2,4)\n\n- Right (R): (x+1,y) so (4,4)\n\n- Down (D): (x,y-1) so (3,3)\n\nNow, check what's on these cells.\n\nFirst, (2,4): is this a wall or obstacle? Walls: borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,4) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is listed as an internal obstacle! So (2,4) is a wall, cannot move there.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Yes, (2,4) is an obstacle, so (2,4) is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is obstacle, but we're not going there yet.\n\nSo from (3,4), moving left to (2,4) is impossible, it's a wall.\n\nNow, moving right to (4,4): is this free? Let's see: x=4, y=4. Borders are fine. Obstacles: none at (4,4), so should be free. But is it part of snake body? Snake positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]. So (4,4) not in there, so it's empty, I think. But there might be food, but food is at different positions.\n\nFood at (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (4,3). (4,3) is food, but (4,4) is not food, so should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (3,3): (3,3) not a wall, not an obstacle, not in snake positions? Snake: head (3,4), then (3,5), etc., no (3,3), so empty.\n\nBut (3,3) might have food? Food listed: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (4,3). (2,3) is food, (3,3) is not listed, so no food, empty.\n\n(2,3) is food, but that's different cell.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- Left: to (2,4) but obstacle, invalid\n\n- Right: to (4,4), empty\n\n- Down: to (3,3), empty\n\n- Up: invalid, reverse\n\nSo only right or down are possible.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nFirst, let's list the food and their life spans:\n\n- (2,2): life span 1, so after this turn (turn 41), if not eaten, it disappears. Since life span decreases including current turn, at turn 41, life span is 1, so after turn 41, it's gone. So must eat now or never.\n\n- (2,3): life span 3, so disappears after turn 43? Let's see: at turn 41, life span is 3, so after turn 41, it becomes 2, then turn 42:1, turn 43:0, so disappears after turn 43. So it can be eaten on turn 41,42, or 43.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current, so:\n\n- At turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after turn t+L-1? Example: if life span 1 at turn t, it disappears after turn t (since after current turn it's gone).\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food with life span N at turn t, it will be available until the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, countdown is N, then after turn t, it becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears after that turn.\n\nSo for (2,2): life span 1 at turn 41, so after turn 41, it disappears. So if not eaten on turn 41, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3): life span 3 at turn 41, so after turn 41, life span 2; after turn 42, life span 1; after turn 43, life span 0, disappears. So can be eaten on turn 41,42,43.\n\n(1,3): life span 6 at turn 41, so disappears after turn 46.\n\n(4,3): life span 9, disappears after turn 49.\n\nNow, (1,3) is also the tail of the snake. Snake tail is at (1,3), and there's food there.\n\nBut the head is at (3,4), not adjacent to (1,3). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,4) to (1,3) is not adjacent; distance is |dx| + |dy| = 2 + 1 = 3, not 1. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, so (3,4) adjacent to (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4). (3,5) is body, (2,4) is wall, (4,4) and (3,3) are possible moves.\n\n(1,3) is tail, but head not adjacent now.\n\nIf I move to eat (1,3), I need to be careful because of tail reward danger.\n\nBack to current move: turn 41, I can go right to (4,4) or down to (3,3).\n\nIf I go down to (3,3), that might be safe, but let's see the board.\n\nI should consider the future.\n\nAlso, (2,2) must be eaten now or lost.\n\nBut can I eat (2,2) this turn? Head at (3,4), to go to (2,2), it's two steps away: first to (3,3) or (2,4), but (2,4) is wall, so only via (3,3) or something.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can only move to adjacent cells: (4,4), (3,3), or if up, but invalid, left invalid.\n\nSo directly, I can't reach (2,2) this turn.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is adjacent to (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2). But (1,2) is obstacle, so not accessible from there? (1,2) is obstacle, so (2,2) can be accessed from (2,1), (2,3), or (3,2).\n\nBut head is at (3,4), so not adjacent.\n\nTo eat (2,2) on this turn, I need to be at (2,2), but I'm at (3,4), impossible. So I cannot eat (2,2) on turn 41; it will disappear after this turn, so it's lost forever. No point worrying about it.\n\nSo (2,2) is not eatable, since I can't be there this turn.\n\nNow, other food: (2,3) can be eaten soon, (1,3) on tail, and (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is below (4,4).\n\nIf I move right to (4,4), then I can go down to (4,3) next turn to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (3,3), I can go left to (2,3) or right to (4,3), but (4,3) is a bit far.\n\nLet's plan possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo mark those as blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail.\n\nSo the snake is currently: from (3,4) down to (3,5)? Head at (3,4), direction down, but position (3,4) to (3,5)? (3,5) is above if y increases up? Typically in grids, y=0 bottom or top? Need to define coordinates.\n\nIn the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so probably y increases upward, like standard math coordinates.\n\nIn the state, snake positions: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nSince head is at (3,4) and next is (3,5), and direction is D, down, which is (x,y-1), but from (3,4) to (3,5) is y+1, which is up, but direction is D? Inconsistency.\n\nHead direction is given as D, down.\n\nBut in positions, head (3,4), then body (3,5). If y increases up, then (3,5) is above (3,4), so moving from head to body is up, but direction is down? That can't be.\n\nPerhaps positions are listed with head first, so the snake is moving from head to tail.\n\nHead at (3,4), direction D, meaning last move was down to (3,4)? But previous position isn't given, only current positions.\n\nThe positions are the current segments: segment 0: head (3,4), segment 1: (3,5), segment 2: (2,5), etc.\n\nIf direction is D, down, that means the head is facing down, so it came from above? Let's see the positions.\n\nFrom the list, (3,4) to (3,5): if y increases up, (3,5) has higher y, so north, so from (3,5) to (3,4) is south, down.\n\nBut the head is at (3,4), and it is connected to (3,5), so the body is at (3,5), which is north of head? That means the head is south of the neck, so it was moving south.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,5) to (2,5), which is west, then to (2,6) north, and so on.\n\nBut the direction is given as head direction, which is D, down, meaning it is facing down, so it can move down, left, right, but not up.\n\nFor movement, from (3,4), moving D to (3,3) would be down, which is fine.\n\nBut in the position list, (3,4) is head, (3,5) is next, so if y increases up, (3,5) is above, so the snake body is above the head, meaning the head is at the south end.\n\nPerhaps it's easier not to worry about the past.\n\nFor future moves, from (3,4), possible moves: to (3,3) down, or to (4,4) right, or to (2,4) but wall, or up to (3,5) but that's body and reverse, invalid.\n\n(3,5) is the first body segment, so moving up to (3,5) would be into body, collision, and also reverse direction.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is wall, so only (3,3) or (4,4).\n\nNow, let's list free cells and food.\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,2): life 1, will disappear after this turn, can't be eaten, ignore.\n\n- (2,3): life 3, can be eaten turn 41,42,43\n\n- (1,3): life 6, can be eaten turn 41 to 46, but it's under tail.\n\n- (4,3): life 9, can be eaten turn 41 to 49\n\nNow, (1,3) is tail, and if head moves there when tail moves away, it can be eaten, but there's a danger if head is adjacent to tail.\n\nCurrently, head at (3,4), tail at (1,3), not adjacent.\n\nTo eat (1,3), I need to move to (1,3) when the tail has moved away.\n\nBut the tail will move when the snake moves forward, unless I eat food and grow.\n\nWhen I eat food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows.\n\nStandard Snake: when you eat food, you grow, so tail stays, head moves to food, new segment added.\n\nBut here, for food under body, it can only be eaten if body moves away, meaning the cell becomes free, then head moves in.\n\nSpecifically for (1,3), it's the tail, so when the snake moves, if I don't eat food, the tail moves away, so (1,3) becomes free, then I can move head there to eat the food.\n\nBut the food is on (1,3), which is current tail.\n\nIf I move such that tail moves away from (1,3), then (1,3) is free with food, and I can move head to it.\n\nBut the danger is if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nCurrently, head not adjacent to tail.\n\nLet's plan for multiple turns.\n\nFirst, on turn 41, I must choose: move to (4,4) or to (3,3).\n\nCase 1: Move down to (3,3) on turn 41.\n\nThen new head position (3,3), snake becomes: head (3,3), then previous head (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), etc. to tail (1,3). Since I didn't eat food, tail moves away, so tail was at (1,3), after move, tail moves to the next segment, which is (1,4)? Let's see the snake before move: positions: index 0: (3,4) head, 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,6), 4: (1,6), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,4), 7: (1,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving down to (3,3), new head at (3,3), and since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so new positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). Tail was (1,3), removed, so tail now at (1,4).\n\n(1,3) is now free, but there was food at (1,3), and since tail moved away, the food is now exposed, so I can eat it later.\n\nAlso, (2,3) is food, which is adjacent to (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move to (2,3), (3,2), (4,3), or (3,4) but (3,4) is body now.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3): U to (3,4) but body, collision, invalid; D to (3,2); L to (2,3); R to (4,3).\n\n(3,2) is within bounds? y=2, not border, no obstacle, not snake? Snake now: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So (3,2) free, (2,3) free? (2,3) has food, and not occupied by snake now, since snake has (2,5) etc., not (2,3). (4,3) has food.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is not in snake positions, so free with food.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) free with food.\n\nSo from (3,3), I can go L to (2,3) to eat food, or D to (3,2), or R to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nIf I go to (2,3), I eat food there, so snake grows: new head at (2,3), and tail doesn't move, so positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) and tail stays at (1,4)? Let's index: after move to (3,3), positions: 0: (3,3), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,6), 5: (1,6), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,4) tail.\n\nIf I move to (2,3) and eat food, new head at (2,3), and add a segment, so positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so the last segment (1,4) stays, and new tail is still (1,4)? No, the tail was at (1,4), but since I added a segment, the tail doesn't change position; the snake grows, so positions become: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — so tail at (1,4).\n\nLength increases by one.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (4,3) from (3,3), same thing.\n\nBut (4,3) has food, so eating that.\n\nNow, back to turn 41 choice.\n\nIf I move down to (3,3) on turn 41.\n\nThen on turn 42, from (3,3), I have options:\n\n- L to (2,3): eat food, grow, head at (2,3), body: (3,3), (3,4), etc.\n\n- R to (4,3): eat food, head at (4,3), body: (3,3), (3,4), etc.\n\n- D to (3,2): no food, so tail moves, head to (3,2), body: (3,3), (3,4), ..., tail at (1,5) or something.\n\nIf I go to (2,3) or (4,3), I eat food and grow.\n\nBut (2,3) has life span 3, at turn 42 it will be life span 2 (since at turn 41 it was 3, after turn 41 it becomes 2, so at turn 42 it has life span 2).\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is now free with food, since tail moved away on turn 41.\n\nOn turn 41, when I moved to (3,3), tail moved from (1,3) to (1,4), so (1,3) is free with food.\n\nSo from (3,3) on turn 42, I could also move to (1,3)? But (1,3) is not adjacent to (3,3); adjacent are (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4) but (3,4) body.\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), which is adjacent to (1,2) obstacle, (1,4) body, (2,3), and (0,3) but x=0 wall, so only accessible from (2,3) or (1,4) but (1,4) is body, so only from (2,3).\n\nSo to eat (1,3), I need to be at (2,3) first or something.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move to (1,3) if it's free.\n\nNow, (1,3) has life span 6, so plenty of time.\n\nBut there's a danger: if I eat (1,3) when head is adjacent to tail, but tail is at (1,4) after turn 41.\n\nAfter turn 41 move to (3,3), snake: head (3,3), tail at (1,4).\n\n(1,4) and (1,3) are adjacent? (1,4) to (1,3) is down, y-1, so yes, adjacent vertically.\n\nIf head is at (2,3) and tail at (1,4), are they adjacent? (2,3) to (1,4): dx=1, dy=1, |dx|+|dy|=2, not adjacent; adjacent means same row or column, differing by one in x or y.\n\nSo (2,3) adjacent to (2,2), (2,4), (1,3), (3,3).\n\n(1,4) adjacent to (1,3), (1,5), (0,4) wall, (2,4) but (2,4) wall.\n\nSo (2,3) and (1,4) are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n\nTo eat (1,3), I need to move to (1,3) from (2,3), for example.\n\nWhen I move to (1,3), if tail is at (1,4), which is adjacent, and (1,3) has food, then eating it would cause the head to be at (1,3) and after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is at (1,4), and head at (1,3), which is adjacent, so they are next to each other, but not necessarily collision unless head moves into tail.\n\nThe rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo in this case, if head is adjacent to tail, and the tail cell has food, and I eat it, then after eating, head is on the food, tail stays, so head and tail are adjacent, but not collided yet. Collision happens if head moves into a body cell.\n\nAfter eating, head at food cell, tail remains, so if head and tail are adjacent, it's not collision; collision is when head moves into a cell occupied by body.\n\nBut the danger is that when I eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and if head is now adjacent to tail, then on the next move, if I move towards tail, I might collide, but not necessarily.\n\nThe rule says: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nPerhaps immediately after eating, since head and tail are adjacent, and tail is part of body, but tail is a segment, so if head is at (1,3) and tail is at (1,4), they are adjacent but different cells, so no collision. Collision only if same cell.\n\nI think I misread.\n\n\"the head and newly grown tail will collide\" — after eating, the tail is still there, and head is on the food cell, which was tail cell but now head is there, but tail is separate.\n\nLet's think: when I eat the food on the tail cell, at the moment of eating, the tail is there, but since food is under tail, it can only be eaten if tail moves away first.\n\nIn this case, for (1,3), on turn 41, when I moved, tail moved away, so (1,3) is free with food. Then if I move head to (1,3), I eat the food, and since I ate food, the tail does not move that turn, so the snake grows: head at (1,3), and the previous positions remain, so the segment that was tail at (1,4) is still there, and new segment added at head, so tail is still at (1,4).\n\nPositions: before moving to (1,3), say from (2,3), snake is at (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), etc. to (1,4) tail.\n\nI move to (1,3), which is free with food, so I eat it, new head at (1,3), and add a segment, so positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), ..., up to (1,4), and tail at (1,4).\n\nNow, head at (1,3), tail at (1,4), which are adjacent. But no collision because different cells.\n\nThe danger might be that on the next move, if I move to (1,4), I would collide with the tail, but I can move elsewhere.\n\nThe rule says \"will collide\" immediately or something? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nAfter eating, the head is at the food cell, and the tail is at its position, but since the snake grew, the tail didn't move, so the cell that was tail is still occupied, and head is at a new cell.\n\nIn the example above, after eating (1,3), head at (1,3), tail at (1,4), so (1,4) is occupied by tail, (1,3) by head, no problem.\n\nThen if I move to (1,4), I would die, but I can move to (1,2) but obstacle, or (2,3) but body, etc.\n\nBut the rule might be referring to the case where the food is on the tail cell and the head is adjacent, so when tail moves away, head moves in, but since head was adjacent, after moving to food, the new tail is the segment that was penultimate, but it's messy.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to avoid eating food on tail cell when head is adjacent.\n\nIn this state, head is not adjacent to tail, so it might be ok.\n\nFor now, let's continue planning.\n\nBack to turn 41.\n\nOption A: Move down to (3,3) on turn 41.\n\nThen turn 42: from (3,3), I can:\n\n- Move L to (2,3): eat food at (2,3), snake grows, head at (2,3), body: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail.\n\nFood at (2,3) eaten, so gone.\n\nLife span of (2,3) was 3 at turn 41, at turn 42 it would be 2, but eaten, so fine.\n\n- Move R to (4,3): eat food at (4,3), head at (4,3), body: (3,3), (3,4), etc. to (1,4) tail.\n\n- Move D to (3,2): no food, head to (3,2), body: (3,3), (3,4), etc., tail moves to (1,5) or something.\n\nAfter move to (3,3) on turn 41, positions: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail.\n\nMove D to (3,2), no food, so new head (3,2), new positions: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) tail. Tail was (1,4), removed.\n\nNow, from (3,2), I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's think about eating (1,3).\n\nAfter turn 41, (1,3) is free with food.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move head to (1,3).\n\nFrom current, at turn 42, head at (3,3), I can go to (2,3), then from there to (1,3) on turn 43.\n\nAt (2,3), I can eat the food there or not.\n\nIf I go to (2,3) on turn 42, I eat (2,3) food, then head at (2,3), body as above.\n\nThen on turn 43, from (2,3), I can move to (1,3) to eat that food.\n\nBut (1,3) has food, and tail is at (1,4), which is adjacent to (1,3).\n\nSo when I move to (1,3), head is at (2,3), tail at (1,4), not adjacent.\n\nAfter moving to (1,3), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (1,3), and tail does not move, so positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail.\n\nNow head at (1,3), tail at (1,4), adjacent.\n\nBut no immediate collision.\n\nThen on next move, I must not move to (1,4), but to (1,2) is obstacle, (2,3) is body, (0,3) wall, so only possible move is to (1,4)? But (1,4) is tail, moving there would collide.\n\nPositions: head at (1,3), tail at (1,4), and body at (2,3), (3,3), etc.\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4) — that's tail, occupied, collision; D to (1,2) — obstacle; L to (0,3) wall; R to (2,3) — but (2,3) is occupied by body segment (index 1), so collision.\n\nAll possible moves are invalid! U to (1,4) body, D to (1,2) wall, L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3) body. So all adjacent cells are blocked, snake dies immediately after eating (1,3) if head and tail are adjacent.\n\nThat's the danger.\n\nIn this case, after eating (1,3), with tail at (1,4), head at (1,3), then no possible moves, all surrounded, so death.\n\nTherefore, I should not eat (1,3) when the tail is adjacent to it after eating.\n\nTo eat (1,3) safely, I need the tail to not be adjacent when I eat it.\n\nFor example, if tail is farther away.\n\nIn the current state, after turn 41, tail is at (1,4), which is adjacent to (1,3), so if I eat (1,3) now, I get stuck.\n\nIf I delay eating (1,3), the tail might move away.\n\nBut (1,3) has life span 6, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, for other food.\n\nNow, back to turn 41.\n\nOption B: Move right to (4,4) on turn 41.\n\nThen new head at (4,4), snake positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail at (1,3). No food eaten, so tail moves away from (1,3), so (1,3) free with food.\n\nNow, from (4,4) on turn 42, I can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4) but body, invalid, R to (5,4).\n\n(4,5): free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake: (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), etc., no (4,5), so free.\n\n(4,3): has food, and free.\n\n(5,4): free, no food.\n\nSo possible: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) eat food, or R to (5,4).\n\nIf I go D to (4,3), eat (4,3) food, grow, head at (4,3), body: (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail at (1,3)? After eating, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail at (1,4) since added segment.\n\nBefore move, after turn 41: positions (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail at (1,3)? Indices: 0: (4,4), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,6), 5: (1,6), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,4) tail? Let's list: from turn 41 move: head to (4,4), previous head (3,4) now body, so positions: 0: (4,4), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,6), 5: (1,6), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,4) and tail is (1,4), since (1,3) was tail but moved away, so positions are from head to tail: (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — so tail at (1,4).\n\n(1,3) is free.\n\nMove D to (4,3) on turn 42, eat food at (4,3), so new head (4,3), add segment, positions: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail.\n\nTail at (1,4).\n\nFrom here, I can move to other places.\n\n(2,3) food is still there, life span decreasing.\n\n(1,3) food is free.\n\nBut to eat (1,3), I need to go there, but it's far.\n\nNow, compare the two options for turn 41.\n\nIf I go down to (3,3), I can then eat (2,3) or (4,3) soon.\n\nIf I go right to (4,4), I can eat (4,3) soon.\n\nBut (4,3) has life span 9, so no rush, while (2,3) has life span 3, so it must be eaten in the next few turns.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) has life 6.\n\nBut (1,3) has the tail reward danger, so I need to eat it when tail is not adjacent.\n\nCurrently, after any move, tail might be close.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, prioritize survival and eating food.\n\nAlso, the grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area around (1,3) might be tricky because of obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,3) has only two access: from (1,4) or (2,3), but (1,4) is often body, so mainly from (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) can be accessed from (2,2) but (2,2) food expired, or (2,4) obstacle, or (1,3), or (3,3).\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so (2,3) can be accessed from (1,3), (2,2), (3,3), or (2,4) but wall, so three directions, but (2,2) may be wall or free? (2,2) is not obstacle, only (1,2) is obstacle, so (2,2) is free, but no food now.\n\nAfter turn 41, (2,2) gone.\n\nSo for (2,3), accessible from (1,3), (2,2), (3,3).\n\n(2,2) is free but no food.\n\nNow, for long-term, I should eat the food with short life first to not miss it.\n\n(2,3) must be eaten by turn 43.\n\n(1,3) by turn 46.\n\n(4,3) by turn 49.\n\nBut (4,3) is easy to eat.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so more body to manage.\n\nNow, let's consider option on turn 41 move down to (3,3).\n\nThen on turn 42, from (3,3), I can go to (2,3) to eat (2,3) food.\n\nThen snake: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail.\n\nNow, from (2,3) on turn 43, I can move to (1,3) to eat (1,3) food, but as before, tail at (1,4), adjacent to (1,3), so after eating, head at (1,3), tail at (1,4), and no move possible, death.\n\nSo that's bad.\n\nFrom (2,3) on turn 43, I could move to (2,2) or (3,3), but (3,3) is body, invalid; (2,2) is free? (2,2) food expired, so no food, but cell is free. (2,2) was food with life 1, after turn 41 it's gone, so (2,2) is empty.\n\nMove to (2,2) on turn 43: from (2,3) to (2,2), no food, so tail moves, head to (2,2), body: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), etc. to (1,5) or something.\n\nBefore move, positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail.\n\nMove to (2,2), no food, so new head (2,2), new positions: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) tail. Tail was (1,4), removed.\n\nNow, tail at (1,5).\n\n(1,3) food still there.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move to (1,2) but obstacle, or (2,1), or (3,2), or (2,3) body.\n\n(2,1): y=1, not border, no obstacle, free.\n\n(3,2): free.\n\n(1,2) obstacle, (2,3) body.\n\nSo move to (2,1) or (3,2).\n\nBut (1,3) is at (1,3), which is adjacent to (2,3) but body, or (1,4) body, or (2,2) head, or (1,2) obstacle. So from (2,2), I can't directly go to (1,3), not adjacent.\n\nTo eat (1,3), I need to be at (2,3) or (1,4), but (1,4) is body, so only from (2,3).\n\nBut (2,3) is now body, so I need to move away first.\n\nIt might take time, and (1,3) life span is 6, so ok, but the area is crowded.\n\nIf on turn 42 from (3,3), I move to (4,3) instead, eat (4,3) food.\n\nThen head at (4,3), body: (3,3), (3,4), etc. to (1,4) tail.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3) body, R to (5,3).\n\n(4,4) free, (4,2) free, (5,3) free.\n\nThen I can go to (2,3) later, but (2,3) life span short.\n\n(2,3) must be eaten by turn 43.\n\nAt turn 42, if I eat (4,3), on turn 43, head at (4,3), I can move to (4,4), for example, then from there, to reach (2,3) by turn 43 is impossible, since (4,3) to (2,3) is two steps away, but turn 43 is only one move, so I can be at (4,4) or (4,2) or (5,3), not close to (2,3).\n\nSo (2,3) will expire if not eaten by turn 43.\n\nAt turn 42, if I am at (3,3), and I move to (4,3) to eat (4,3), then on turn 43, (2,3) still has life span 1 (since at turn 42 it was 2, after turn 42 it becomes 1, so at turn 43 it has life span 1, must be eaten on turn 43 or lost.\n\nBut from (4,3) on turn 43, I can't reach (2,3) in one move; it's too far.\n\nSo if I don't eat (2,3) on turn 42, I miss it.\n\nTherefore, to eat (2,3), I should go for it on turn 42 if possible.\n\nNow, for option on turn 41: if I move down to (3,3), then on turn 42 I can eat (2,3).\n\nBut then I have the problem with (1,3) if I try to eat it.\n\nAfter eating (2,3) on turn 42, I can avoid eating (1,3) immediately and go elsewhere.\n\nFor example, from (2,3) on turn 43, move to (2,2) or to (3,3) but body, so only (2,2) if possible.\n\n(2,2) is free, as food expired.\n\nMove to (2,2) on turn 43: as before, head to (2,2), tail moves, positions: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) tail.\n\nNow, (1,3) is free with food, and I can eat it later.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move to (2,1) or (3,2).\n\nThen later go back to (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is adjacent to (1,4) which may be body, but if tail moves away, it might be ok.\n\nFor example, if I move to (2,1) on turn 43, head to (2,1), no food, tail moves, positions: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) tail. Tail at (1,6).\n\nThen (1,3) is free, and not adjacent to tail; tail at (1,6), far.\n\nThen I can go to (2,3) from (2,2), but (2,3) is body now.\n\nTo reach (1,3), I need to go to (2,3) first, but (2,3) is occupied.\n\nSo I need to move the snake to free (2,3).\n\nFor example, from current position, say at (2,1), I can move to (3,1) or (2,0) but y=0 wall, or (1,1), but (1,1) may be free? x=1,y=1, not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) not listed, so free.\n\n(1,1) free.\n\nThen from (2,1), move to (1,1) on turn 44, for example.\n\nThen head to (1,1), body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), etc.\n\nThen from (1,1), move to (1,2) but obstacle, or (1,0) wall, or (2,1) body, so only down to (1,0) invalid, or up to (1,2) invalid, so stuck? (1,1) has only one neighbor: (2,1), which is body, and (1,2) obstacle, (1,0) wall, (0,1) wall, so from (1,1), only possible move is to (2,1), but body, collision, or no move, so death.\n\n(1,1) is a dead end because of obstacle at (1,2) and walls.\n\nSpecifically, (1,1) adjacent cells: (1,0) wall, (1,2) obstacle, (0,1) wall, (2,1) which may be free or not.\n\nBut if (2,1) is body, then no move.\n\nIn this case, if I go to (1,1), it might be trapped.\n\nBetter to avoid (1,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), instead of going to (2,1), go to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) free.\n\nMove to (3,2) on turn 43 from (2,2)? From (2,2), after moving there on turn 43, positions head (2,2), etc.\n\nOn turn 43, from (2,2), I can move to (3,2) or (2,1) or (2,3) but body.\n\n(2,3) is body, so only (3,2) or (2,1).\n\nMove to (3,2): no food, head to (3,2), body: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) tail.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move to (3,1), (3,3) body, (4,2), (2,2) body.\n\n(3,3) is body, so move to (3,1), (4,2), or (2,2) body invalid.\n\n(4,2) free, (3,1) free.\n\nThen I can go to (4,3) or other.\n\nBut (1,3) food is still there, but hard to reach without risking the tail danger.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for the right move first.\n\nLet's consider the other option for turn 41: move right to (4,4).\n\nThen on turn 42, I can move down to (4,3) to eat (4,3) food.\n\nThen head at (4,3), body: (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail.\n\nNow, (2,3) food must be eaten by turn 43.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 43, I can move to (4,2), (4,4), (5,3), or (3,3) but (3,3) may be free or not.\n\n(3,3) is not occupied, snake has (3,4), (3,5), not (3,3), so (3,3) free.\n\nBut to reach (2,3) from (4,3), I need to go left to (3,3), then to (2,3) on turn 44, but turn 43 is the last chance for (2,3).\n\nAt turn 43, (2,3) has life span 1, so must be eaten on turn 43.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can't reach (2,3) in one move; it's two cells away.\n\nSo impossible to eat (2,3) if I am at (4,3) on turn 43.\n\nOn turn 42, if I am at (4,4), I could choose not to eat (4,3) and go elsewhere to reach (2,3).\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 42, instead of down to (4,3), I could go up to (4,5) or right to (5,4).\n\nBut (4,5) and (5,4) are away from (2,3), so on turn 43, I can't reach (2,3).\n\nFor example, from (4,4) to (4,5) on turn 42, then on turn 43 at (4,5), I can move to (4,6), (3,5), etc, not to (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, to (5,4) then to (5,5) or (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, etc.\n\nSo if I move right on turn 41 to (4,4), I cannot eat (2,3) in time, so I lose that food.\n\nWhereas if I move down on turn 41 to (3,3), I can eat (2,3) on turn 42.\n\nTherefore, to not miss the short-life food, I should move down to (3,3) on turn 41, then eat (2,3) on turn 42.\n\nThen after that, avoid eating (1,3) immediately and go to safer areas.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,3) on turn 42, on turn 43 move to (2,2) or to (3,3) but body, so to (2,2).\n\nThen from (2,2), move to (3,2) on turn 44, then to (3,1) or (4,2), etc.\n\nThen later, when the tail is not near, I can eat (1,3) or (4,3).\n\n(4,3) has long life, so ok.\n\nAlso, the snake will be longer, so more careful.\n\nBut for now, let's outline the actions.\n\nTurn 41: move down to (3,3)\n\nTurn 42: move left to (2,3) to eat food\n\nThen turn 43: move down to (2,2) (assuming (2,2) is free, food expired)\n\nFrom (2,2), direction south or something.\n\nAfter turn 42: head at (2,3), direction L if I moved left.\n\nThen turn 43, from (2,3), I can move down to (2,2), which is south.\n\nThen no food, so tail moves.\n\nPositions after turn 43: head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), etc. to (1,5) tail or something.\n\nThen turn 44, from (2,2), move to (3,2) east or to (2,1) south.\n\n(2,1) might be better to avoid dead end.\n\nMove to (3,2) on turn 44.\n\nThen from (3,2), move to (4,2) or (3,1), etc.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I need to output only the actions for the current turn and a few ahead, but the instruction says to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions starting from current.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for 5 turns.\n\nBut in the box, I need to write the actions.\n\nPerhaps for this state, I can do:\n\nTurn 41: D (down to (3,3))\n\nTurn 42: L (left to (2,3) eat food)\n\nThen for turn 43, from (2,3), move D to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 44, from (2,2), move R to (3,2)  (since moving right, to (3,2))\n\n(2,2) to (3,2) is east, so R.\n\nThen turn 45, from (3,2), I can move to (4,2) or (3,1), say to (4,2) to go towards (4,3) food.\n\n(4,3) food is still there.\n\nMove to (4,2) on turn 45, then to (4,3) on turn 46 to eat.\n\nBut (1,3) food might be eaten if possible, but with caution.\n\nSince (1,3) has life 6, at turn 46 it might expire? At turn 41, life span 6, so disappears after turn 46.\n\nAt turn 46, if not eaten, gone.\n\nBut we can eat it earlier if safe.\n\nFor example, after turn 43, when at (2,2), tail might be at (1,5), not adjacent to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) and (1,5) are not adjacent, |dy|=2.\n\nSo I could move to (2,3) but body, or from (2,2) to (2,3) is north, but (2,3) is body after turn 43.\n\nAfter turn 43, positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) tail.\n\n(1,3) free with food.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move to (2,3) first, but (2,3) is occupied by body.\n\nSo I need to free (2,3) by moving the snake.\n\nFor example, move away from the area.\n\nGo to (3,2) on turn 44, then to (4,2) on turn 45, then to (4,3) on turn 46 to eat (4,3).\n\nThen (1,3) will expire if not eaten by turn 46.\n\nAt turn 46, if I am at (4,3), I can't reach (1,3), so I might miss it, but it's risky to go back.\n\nPerhaps it's acceptable to miss (1,3) to avoid danger.\n\nBut let's see the initial move.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 41, move down to (3,3), then on turn 42, instead of eating (2,3), move to (4,3) to eat (4,3), but then (2,3) will be lost, as I can't eat it by turn 43.\n\nSince (2,3) is +1 and short life, it's better to eat it.\n\nI think moving down on turn 41 is better to secure (2,3).\n\nThen for the tail danger with (1,3), I can simply not eat it, as it's not worth the risk.\n\nOr eat it later when safe.\n\nBut with the obstacles, it might be hard.\n\nPerhaps after eating (2,3), on turn 43 move to (2,2), then turn 44 move to (3,2), then turn 45 move to (3,1) or (4,2).\n\nSay to (4,2) on turn 45.\n\nThen turn 46 move to (4,3) to eat (4,3).\n\n(1,3) expires unused.\n\nBut that's fine, survival first.\n\nNow for the other option, if I move right on turn 41, I miss (2,3), so worse.\n\nSo I think D on turn 41 is better.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 41: D\n\nTurn 42: L (to eat (2,3))\n\nTurn 43: D (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 44: R (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 45: R (to (4,2)) or to (4,3) but (4,3) has food, so if I move to (4,3) on turn 45, I eat it, but I can delay.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 44, I can move to (4,2) or (3,1) or (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is food, so I can eat it on turn 45 if I go directly.\n\nBut let's not specify too far, as the state changes.\n\nFor the answer, I can output up to 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the format is to start from turn t1.\n\nAlso, for turn 43, from (2,3), moving to (2,2) is D, down.\n\nThen turn 44 from (2,2) to (3,2) is R, right.\n\nThen turn 45 from (3,2) to (4,2) is R again.\n\nThen turn 46 to (4,3) D down.\n\nBut (4,3) can be eaten then.\n\nNow, for the immediate, turn 41: D\n\nThen turn 42: L\n\nFor turn 43, I need to choose, but since I think ahead, I can include.\n\nBut the user might expect the actions.\n\nPerhaps in the box, list the actions for t1 to t1+4 or something.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the sequence starting from current.\n\nI think for this, I'll go with:\n\nTurn 41: D\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nThen for later, it's flexible.\n\nBut to be complete, let's say.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (2,2) on turn 43, is it safe? (2,2) is free, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) free.\n\nNo walls or obstacles.\n\nSo, final decision.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned 5 turns ahead (turns 41 to 45). The key considerations are:\n\n- **Immediate risks and opportunities**: \n  - (2,2) food has a life span of 1 and must be eaten on turn 41 to avoid loss, but it is inaccessible from the current head position (3,4) in one move. Thus, it will expire unused.\n  - (2,3) food has a life span of 3 (must be eaten by turn 43) and is a high priority to avoid missing the +1 score.\n  - (1,3) food is under the tail and has a life span of 6, but eating it risks death if the head is adjacent to the tail after consumption. It should be avoided until safer or skipped if necessary.\n  - (4,3) food has a life span of 9, so it can be eaten later with less urgency.\n- **Movement constraints**: \n  - Current head direction is D (down), so reverse move U is invalid.\n  - From (3,4), moving L to (2,4) is blocked by an obstacle.\n  - Valid moves from (3,4) are D to (3,3) or R to (4,4).\n- **Path selection**:\n  - Moving D to (3,3) on turn 41 allows eating (2,3) on turn 42, securing the +1 score before it expires.\n  - Moving R to (4,4) would make (2,3) inaccessible by turn 43, leading to its loss.\n  - After eating (2,3), moving D to (2,2) on turn 43 avoids the dangerous (1,3) food and opens safer paths.\n  - Subsequent moves (turns 44-45) navigate toward (4,3) for future eating while avoiding dead ends near obstacles.\n\n**5-Turn Plan**:\n- **Turn 41 (current)**: Move D (down) to (3,3). This positions the head to reach (2,3) next turn and avoids missing the short-life food.\n- **Turn 42**: Move L (left) to (2,3) to eat the food (+1 score, snake grows). This must be done now as (2,3) expires after turn 43.\n- **Turn 43**: Move D (down) to (2,2). This avoids (1,3) (tail collision risk) and moves toward open areas. (2,2) is empty after food expiration.\n- **Turn 44**: Move R (right) to (3,2). This continues toward the safer right side of the grid, away from obstacles.\n- **Turn 45**: Move R (right) to (4,2). This positions to eat (4,3) on a future turn (e.g., turn 46) when feasible.\n\nThis plan prioritizes eating (2,3) for immediate score, avoids the risky (1,3), and sets up for (4,3) consumption later. Survival is ensured by steering clear of walls, obstacles, and potential collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 41: D \\\\\nTurn 42: L \\\\\nTurn 43: D \\\\\nTurn 44: R \\\\\nTurn 45: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but there are internal obstacles too.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,3), then body: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So the snake is 8 segments long.\n\nHead direction is down (D). That means from (3,3), moving down would go to (3,2), but let's see the coordinates. Typically, in grids, y increases upwards, but here it might be different. Let me confirm.\n\nThe movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases as we go up, decreases as we go down. So (x,y) with y=0 at bottom or top? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? No.\n\nWall cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. Since it's a grid, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (0,0) to (7,7). But border cells are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so interior cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, that's 6x6 grid? But let's list the snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), etc. (3,3) to (1,4), all between 1 and 6 for x and y? x=1,2,3; y=3,4,5,6. y=6 is possible? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 should be playable, but y=6 is not wall, since wall is y=7. Similarly, x=1 to 6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So min x=1, max x=6; min y=1, max y=6. So grid from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nBut internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these are within 1-6 and blocked.\n\nSnake head at (3,3), direction down. Down is (x,y-1), so from (3,3), down would be to (3,2). y=2 is within 1-6, so possible if not blocked.\n\nNow food positions:\n\n- (2,3) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,3) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,3) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, value 1, and different life spans.\n\nLife span: decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn t=42, food at (2,3) has life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 more turns? Life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn.\n\nSo for food at (2,3), life span 3 at turn 42. After turn 42, it will have life span 2, then turn 43:1, turn 44:0, disappears at turn 45 or after turn 44? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. After turn t+L-1, it disappears? Let's think.\n\nFor example, if life span 1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on turn t.\n\nIf life span 2 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n\nGenerally, food with life span L at turn t will disappear after turn t+L-1, so it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+L-1 inclusive.\n\nFor (2,3): life span 3 at t=42, so can be eaten on turns 42,43,44; disappears after turn 44.\n\n(1,3): life span 5, t=42, eaten on 42 to 46.\n\n(4,3): life span 8, eaten on 42 to 49.\n\nAll food is positive, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,3), direction down. Possible moves: since head direction is D, I can move down, or left/right, but not up because reverse is not allowed instantly. No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on the next turn. Possible moves: down (D), left (L), right (R). But not up (U).\n\nNow, from (3,3), moving:\n\n- Down (D): to (3,2)\n\n- Left (L): to (2,3)\n\n- Right (R): to (4,3)\n\nNow, I need to check if these cells are safe: not wall, not obstacle, and not body except tail.\n\nFirst, walls: (3,2): x=3, y=2. Walls are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,2) is not wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (3,2) not in list, so free.\n\n(2,3): x=2,y=3, not wall, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) is not listed, so should be free? Obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) is not mentioned, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3): x=4,y=3, not wall, obstacles not include (4,3), so free.\n\nNow, body collision: snake positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). Tail is (1,4).\n\nIf I move to a cell, I need to make sure it's not occupied by body except the tail, because when I move, the tail moves away, so only tail cell is safe to move into, but after moving, the tail moves, so it's ok.\n\nStandard snake: moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, so the cell is vacated.\n\nBut there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nFirst, let's list adjacent cells to head.\n\nHead at (3,3). Adjacent cells: up (3,4), but (3,4) is body, not tail. Down (3,2), left (2,3), right (4,3).\n\nNow, tail is at (1,4). Is head adjacent to tail? (3,3) and (1,4): not adjacent; adjacent means sharing edge, so (3,3) neighbors are (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), (4,3). (1,4) is not adjacent to (3,3); distance is |dx|+|dy|>1, so not adjacent.\n\nTail is at (1,4), head at (3,3), so not adjacent. So no immediate tail danger.\n\nNow, back to possible moves from (3,3):\n\n- D to (3,2): is this safe? (3,2) is not body; body cells: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). (3,2) not in list, so free. Also, not wall or obstacle. So safe to move.\n\n- L to (2,3): (2,3) is not body, not wall, not obstacle. Food is at (2,3), which is positive food. But moving to (2,3) would eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n\n- R to (4,3): (4,3) has food, positive, so eating it.\n\nAlso, (4,3) is free, not body, etc.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo let's list all blocked cells:\n\n- (1,2) obstacle\n\n- (2,4) obstacle\n\n- (5,1) obstacle\n\n- (6,1) obstacle\n\n- (6,4) obstacle\n\nAlso walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7, but since we can't go there, we consider only interior.\n\nPlayable cells: all (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6 except obstacles.\n\nSo free cells: for example, (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) but (1,2) blocked, and snake is on (1,4),(1,5),(1,6) etc.\n\nList snake positions:\n\nHead: (3,3)\n\nBody: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // tail at (1,4)\n\nSo occupied by snake: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nFood at: (2,3), (1,3), (4,3)\n\n(2,3) is free, not occupied, since snake not there.\n\n(1,3) free.\n\n(4,3) free.\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,3):\n\n- Down to (3,2): free, no food\n\n- Left to (2,3): has food, positive\n\n- Right to (4,3): has food, positive\n\nCannot go up to (3,4) because it's body.\n\nNow, if I go left to (2,3), I eat the food at (2,3), which has life span 3, so it can be eaten now. After eating, snake grows, so new length 9, tail stays or moves? When you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nSequence: move head to new cell, if food, eat and grow (tail doesn't move), else move tail forward.\n\nSo if I move to (2,3), which has food, I eat it, so head moves to (2,3), new body segment added where? The new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move, the new segment is attached, so the snake extends.\n\nAfter eating, the length increases, and the tail remains in place for that turn, so the new position is head at (2,3), and the previous head (3,3) becomes body, so body now includes (3,3) and so on, up to tail (1,4) still there, but since we ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) and new segment? When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the segment before tail is extended, but it's added at the end.\n\nStandard: after moving head to new cell, if food, remove food and don't move tail, so snake has new head position, and tail stays, so length increases by one, with the new tail position being the old tail position for that turn.\n\nPositions: after move to (2,3) and eat, snake: [ (2,3) , (3,3) , (3,4) , (3,5) , (2,5) , (2,6) , (1,6) , (1,5) , (1,4) ] so 9 segments, tail at (1,4).\n\nThen next turn, when I move, tail will move away.\n\nSimilarly, if I move right to (4,3), eat food there, grow to 9 segments.\n\nIf I move down to (3,2), no food, so tail moves: head to (3,2), tail (1,4) moves off, so positions: [ (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] and (1,4) is vacated, but since no eat, tail moved, so length 8 still.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5 turns.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (2,3) will disappear after turn 44, so must be eaten by turn 44.\n\n(1,3) by turn 46, (4,3) by turn 49.\n\nSince we are at turn 42, all can be eaten now or later.\n\nBut I should prioritize which one to eat or avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider the options for turn 42.\n\nOption 1: Move down to (3,2)\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction down? After move, head direction changes to the move direction.\n\nWhen I move, the head direction for next turn is the direction I just moved.\n\nSo if I move down, head direction becomes D.\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves: down to (3,1), left to (2,2), right to (4,2), not up (reverse).\n\n(3,1): y=1, not wall. But is it free? (3,1) not obstacle, not body currently, but after move, body is [ (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), etc.] so (3,1) free now.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2): x=2,y=2, not wall, obstacle? (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so free. Body: after move to (3,2), positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), and tail (1,4) since no eat, tail moved? In this case, I moved down to (3,2) without eating, so tail moved: from [ (3,3), (3,4), ... (1,4) ] after head move to (3,2), the body shifts, so new positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) , and (1,4) is removed. So tail is now (1,5).\n\nBody: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) so tail (1,5).\n\n(2,2) is free, (4,2) free.\n\nBut I need to think further.\n\nOption 2: Move left to (2,3)\n\nEat food at (2,3), so snake grows to 9 segments: positions after move: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) and no tail move, so tail at (1,4).\n\nHead direction now L (since moved left).\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: left to (1,3), down to (2,2), up to (2,4), but up is (2,4), which is obstacle! (2,4) is internal obstacle, so cannot move up.\n\nAlso, right to (3,3), but (3,3) is now body, since head moved to (2,3), (3,3) is first body segment.\n\nAnd reverse: current head direction L, so cannot move right (opposite).\n\nSo possible moves from (2,3): left to (1,3), down to (2,2), not up (obstacle), not right (reverse).\n\n(1,3) has food, positive, so can eat it.\n\n(2,2) no food.\n\nBut (1,3) is free, not body.\n\nOption 3: Move right to (4,3)\n\nEat food at (4,3), grow to 9 segments: head (4,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,4).\n\nHead direction R.\n\nFrom (4,3), possible moves: right to (5,3), down to (4,2), up to (4,4), not left (reverse).\n\n(5,3): free? Not wall, not obstacle. Obstacles: (5,1) but not (5,3), so free. Not body.\n\n(4,2): free.\n\n(4,4): free? y=4,x=4, not wall, not obstacle listed.\n\nNow, I need to think 5 turns ahead for each choice.\n\nAlso, long-term survival: the snake is quite long, 8 segments, and the grid has obstacles, so space might be tight.\n\nPlayable area: 6x6 = 36 cells, minus 5 obstacles, so 31 free cells, but snake is 8, so 23 free cells left.\n\nAfter eating one, 9 segments, 22 free.\n\nBut with food, etc.\n\nNow, let's consider the risks.\n\nFirst, if I move left to (2,3) and eat, then I'm at (2,3) with head left.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,3) or (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (1,3), eat another food, grow to 10.\n\nBut then at (1,3), with head left or whatever.\n\nBut let's see the area around (2,3) and (1,3).\n\n(1,3) has food, which I can eat now if I go there.\n\nBut after eating at (2,3), if I go to (1,3), I eat immediately, but then I'm at (1,3) with body around.\n\nPositions: after move to (2,3) and eat, snake: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nNow, from (2,3), move to (1,3): (1,3) has food, so eat it, grow to 10 segments. New head (1,3), body: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) and new tail position? After eating, tail doesn't move, so positions: [ (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ] tail at (1,4).\n\nNow head at (1,3), direction left (since moved left from (2,3)).\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves: left to (0,3) but x=0 is wall, cannot.\n\nDown to (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle, blocked.\n\nUp to (1,4), but (1,4) is body, tail, but can I move there?\n\n(1,4) is tail, so moving to tail is generally safe because tail moves away.\n\nBut there is \"Tail Reward Danger\" if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here, at (1,3), adjacent cells: left (0,3) wall, down (1,2) obstacle, up (1,4) tail, right (2,3) body.\n\nSo only possible move is up to (1,4), which is tail.\n\nNow, (1,4) has food? In this position, (1,4) is part of snake, so no food there; food was at (1,3) which I just ate, and (2,3) eaten before.\n\n(1,4) is snake body, so no food on it. Food can spawn under body but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves in. But here, no food on (1,4) mentioned.\n\nAt turn 42, food at (1,3), (2,3), (4,3); (1,4) has no food, it's snake.\n\nSo moving to (1,4) should be safe, since tail will move.\n\nBut when I move to (1,4), since it's tail, and I move there, if there were food, it might be dangerous, but no food.\n\nSo from (1,3), only move is to (1,4).\n\nThen head moves to (1,4), which was tail. Since I move to it, and if no food, it's ok; tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nAfter moving to (1,4), the tail position was (1,4), but since I move head there, and it was tail, after move, the tail moves forward? Let's think.\n\nPositions before move from (1,3) to (1,4): snake [ (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]\n\nMove head to (1,4), which is the current tail. Since I move to (1,4), and it was occupied by tail, but in snake, moving to tail cell is allowed because when head moves to tail, tail moves away simultaneously, so no collision.\n\nAfter move, head at (1,4), the previous head (1,3) becomes body, and the tail (1,4) was there, but since head moved to it, the tail is removed or shifted.\n\nStandard: when head moves to a new cell, if not food, tail moves to the next segment, so the cell is vacated.\n\nBut if head moves to the tail cell, since tail moves away, it's fine.\n\nIn this case, moving to (1,4): before move, (1,4) is tail. After head moves to (1,4), the new head position is (1,4), and since no food (assuming), the tail moves to the next segment, which is (1,5)? Positions: the body segments: after head move to (1,4), the snake positions become: head (1,4), then the previous body: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) and the tail (1,4) is gone, so new tail is (1,5).\n\nList: indices: head was at (1,3), move to (1,4). Before move: positions [ (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ] index 0 to 9, head 0, tail 9.\n\nAfter move to (1,4), new head at (1,4), then body segments shift: the new body is [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] and since no eat, tail is removed, so the last segment (1,5) is new tail? After move, the positions are new head at new position, then the previous head to second last, but tail is removed if no eat.\n\nStandard: the new position list is: [ new_head, old_head, old_body1, ..., old_body_penultimate, old_tail] if no eat, old_tail is removed.\n\nIf no eat, the tail cell is vacated, and the new tail is the segment that was second last.\n\nIn this case, before move: positions: P0=(1,3), P1=(2,3), P2=(3,3), P3=(3,4), P4=(3,5), P5=(2,5), P6=(2,6), P7=(1,6), P8=(1,5), P9=(1,4)  // P0 head, P9 tail.\n\nMove head to (1,4) — but (1,4) is P9, the tail cell.\n\nAfter moving head to (1,4), new head at (1,4). Then the body becomes: old head P0 becomes first body segment, so [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] and since no eat, we remove the tail, which was P9=(1,4), but now (1,4) is head, so we remove the last body segment, which is (1,5). So new positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) and tail is (1,6)? List: [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) ] so 9 segments, tail at (1,6).\n\nPreviously 10 segments, after move and no eat, tail removed, so back to 9.\n\nBut in this case, from (1,3), moving to (1,4) is possible and safe.\n\nThen from there, I can move, but it might be tight.\n\nBut let's not get too deep yet.\n\nBack to turn 42 choices.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), eat food, then from there I have to go to (1,3) or (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (1,3), eat another food, then I'm at (1,3) with only one move: to (1,4), as above.\n\nThen from (1,4), head at (1,4), direction up (since moved from (1,3) to (1,4), which is up if y increases up.\n\nFrom (1,3) to (1,4) is up, so head direction U.\n\nFrom (1,4), possible moves: up to (1,5), down to (1,3), left to (0,4) wall, right to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle.\n\nSo possible: up to (1,5) or down to (1,3).\n\nDown to (1,3) is body, currently, after move, body has (1,3), so cannot move to body.\n\nSo only move up to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is body? In the position after moving to (1,4), positions: [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) ] so (1,5) is not in list, but (1,6) is tail, (1,5) is not occupied? Positions are (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), etc., (1,5) is free? Let's see: after move to (1,4), snake: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) so cells occupied: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6). So (1,5) is not occupied, free.\n\nSo from (1,4), move up to (1,5) is possible.\n\nThen and so on. But this seems messy, and the snake is cornered in the top-left area with obstacles, which might be risky for long-term.\n\nSimilarly, if from (2,3) I move down to (2,2) instead of left.\n\nBut (2,2) might be free.\n\nBut let's consider other options.\n\nOption: move right to (4,3) at turn 42.\n\nEat food at (4,3), grow to 9 segments: head (4,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,4).\n\nHead direction R.\n\nFrom (4,3), possible moves: right to (5,3), down to (4,2), up to (4,4), not left.\n\n(5,3) free, (4,2) free, (4,4) free.\n\nThe area to the right is more open, since obstacles are at (5,1), (6,1), (6,4), etc., but (5,3) is free.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,3) eaten, but other food at (1,3) and (2,3) still there.\n\n(2,3) has short life span, only 3 turns, so must be eaten soon.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) has longer.\n\nBut if I move right, I might not be able to eat (2,3) in time.\n\nLife span: (2,3) at t=42, life span 3, so can be eaten on t=42,43,44.\n\nIf I don't eat it on t=42, I might eat later.\n\nBut with snake position, from (4,3) to (2,3) is not adjacent, so I need to move left, but head direction R, so I can move down or up or right, not left immediately.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I move right to (5,3), then from there, I can move down or up, but not left.\n\nTo go back left, I need to turn around.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), move down to (5,2), then left to (4,2), then to (3,2), etc., to reach (2,3).\n\nBut (2,3) might disappear if not eaten by t=44.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) has until t=46.\n\nNow, option: move down to (3,2) at t=42.\n\nThen no eat, snake moves, tail moves, so positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), tail (1,5)? After move down to (3,2), no eat, so positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) , and (1,4) removed, so tail at (1,5).\n\nHead direction D.\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves: down to (3,1), left to (2,2), right to (4,2), not up.\n\n(3,1): y=1, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles at (5,1), (6,1), not (3,1)), so free.\n\n(2,2): not obstacle, not body, free.\n\n(4,2): free.\n\nFood at (2,3) is still there, life span now 2 at t=43? At t=42, if I don't eat, at t=43 life span 2 for (2,3).\n\nI need to think about the path.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat the foods, but with survival.\n\nThe food at (2,3) has short life, so I should eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is also near, but (4,3) has longer life.\n\nBut eating (2,3) now might lead to being cornered.\n\nLet's consider the grid layout.\n\nDraw a grid mentally.\n\nRows y=1 to 6, bottom to top? y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Since D is y-1, U is y+1, so y=1 is south, y=6 north.\n\nColumns x=1 to 6, x=1 west, x=6 east.\n\nObstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSnake: head (3,3), body: (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // so it's like the snake is from (3,3) up to (3,5), then left to (2,5), up to (2,6), left to (1,6), down to (1,5), down to (1,4). So tail at (1,4).\n\nFood at (2,3), (1,3), (4,3)\n\n(2,3) is south-west of head, (1,3) west, (4,3) east.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), I eat, then I'm at (2,3) with body above and right.\n\nFrom there, as before, I can go to (1,3) or (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (1,3), eat, then to (1,4), then to (1,5), etc., but the area north is blocked by body and obstacle at (2,4), so I might be trapped.\n\nFor example, from (1,4), I can go to (1,5) or (1,3), but (1,3) is body after move, so only (1,5).\n\nThen to (1,6), but (1,6) is body, so when at (1,5), move to (1,6), which is body, but it might be tail or something.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nAt t=42: move left to (2,3), eat, grow to 9: positions [ (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nt=43: from (2,3), move left to (1,3), eat food there, grow to 10: positions [ (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]\n\nHead direction L (moved left).\n\nt=44: from (1,3), only move up to (1,4), since left wall, down obstacle, right body. Move to (1,4), which was tail. No food there, so after move, positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) and remove tail, so new tail (1,5)? After move to (1,4), new positions: [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) ] tail (1,6)\n\nHead direction U (moved up).\n\nt=45: from (1,4), move up to (1,5), free. No food, so move tail: head to (1,5), body [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] tail (2,6)? Positions before move: [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) ] head (1,4), tail (1,6)\n\nMove head to (1,5), no food, so new head (1,5), body [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] and tail removed, so new tail (2,6)\n\nHead direction U.\n\nt=46: from (1,5), possible moves: up to (1,6), down to (1,4), left wall, right to (2,5) but (2,5) is body.\n\n(1,6) is not body?

Positions: (2,6) is in body? Body has (2,5), (2,6) is not, before move, positions [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) ] so (2,6) free.\n\n(2,6) is free?

But this is survivable for now, but the snake is in a loop or something, and it might run out of space or hit itself later.\n\nBut there is food at (4,3) which I haven't eaten, and it might expire later.\n\nBut life span 8, so until t=49.\n\nBut from here, to reach (4,3) might be hard.\n\nSo this path might not be good for long-term.\n\nIf from (2,3) at t=43 I move down to (2,2) instead of left to (1,3).\n\nAt t=42 move left to (2,3), eat.\n\nt=43: from (2,3), move down to (2,2), no food, so positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), and tail (1,4) removed?

Walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so x=7 and x=0 are walls, so x=6 is not wall, it's interior.\n\nx from 1 to 6, x=6 is not wall, only x=7 wall.\n\nSimilarly y=6 not wall.\n\nSo (6,3) is free, not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), not (6,3), so free.\n\nNo body, so move to (6,3).\n\nNo food, positions: head (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) tail (1,6)\n\nHead direction R.\n\nt=45: from (6,3), possible moves: right to (7,3) x=7 wall, cannot; down to (6,2), up to (6,4), left to (5,3) body.\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\nDown to (6,2), free?

This seems more open, and I can explore the right side.\n\nFood at (2,3) will expire at turn 44, so if I don't eat it by then, I miss it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) until 46.\n\nWith snake on the right, it might be hard to reach (2,3) in time.\n\nFor example, from (6,2) at t=45, to reach (2,3) by t=44? t=44 is before, so impossible to eat (2,3) if not on left.\n\nt=42,43,44 to eat (2,3).\n\nIf at t=42 I move right, I'm at (4,3) at t=42, then at t=43 I can move to (5,3), t=44 to (6,3), not towards (2,3).\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,3) if I move right at t=42.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down at t=42 to (3,2), I can then go to (2,3) or something.\n\nAt t=42 move down to (3,2), no eat, positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) tail (1,5)\n\nHead direction D.\n\nt=43: from (3,2), move left to (2,2) or down to (3,1) or right to (4,2).\n\n(2,2) free, no food.\n\n(3,1) free.\n\n(4,2) free.\n\nFood at (2,3) is at (2,3), which is above (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move left to (2,2), then from (2,2) to (2,3) up, but at t=43.\n\nt=43: move to (2,2), no food.\n\nThen positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) tail (1,5)\n\nHead direction L (moved left).\n\nt=44: from (2,2), move up to (2,3), which has food, life span 3 at t=42, at t=44 life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nMove to (2,3), eat, grow to 9: positions head (2,3), body (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) and since eat, tail doesn't move, so tail at (1,6)? Before move, tail was (1,5), after move and eat, positions: [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) ] and (1,5) still there? When eat, tail doesn't move, so the position list includes the old tail.\n\nBefore move at t=44: positions [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] head (2,2), tail (1,5)\n\nMove head to (2,3), eat food, so new head (2,3), body: old head (2,2) becomes first body, then (3,2), (3,3), etc., and tail (1,5) stays, so positions: [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] tail (1,5)\n\nHead direction U (moved up from (2,2) to (2,3)).\n\nThen from here, similar to before, I can go to (1,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so only (1,3) left or down to (2,1) etc.\n\nBut (1,3) has food.\n\nSo I can eat (1,3) next.\n\nBut again, might be cornered.\n\nTo avoid being cornered, moving down at t=42 might be better for flexibility.\n\nOr moving right.\n\nBut moving right misses the (2,3) food.\n\nSince all food is +1, missing one is -1 in potential score, but survival is more important.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score, so eating food is good, but not at the cost of death.\n\nIn this case, eating (2,3) might lead to a risky position.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is also in the corner.\n\n(4,3) is more central.\n\nPerhaps I should eat (4,3) first for long-term.\n\nOr eat nothing and move to open space.\n\nLet's see the map.\n\nThe left side has obstacles at (1,2) and (2,4), so the area around (1,3) and (2,3) is somewhat confined.\n\nThe right side has obstacles at (5,1), (6,1), (6,4), but (4,3) is open.\n\nMoving to (3,2) or (4,3) might be better.\n\nSince head direction is down, moving down to (3,2) is consistent, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" so I need to plan a sequence.\n\nLet me define the actions for turns 42 to 46 or so.\n\nFirst, if I move down at t=42 to (3,2):\n\nt=42: move D to (3,2), no eat\n\nPositions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) tail (1,5)\n\nHead direction D\n\nt=43: from (3,2), I can move to (3,1) or (2,2) or (4,2)\n\n(3,1) is free, (2,2) free, (4,2) free.\n\nFood at (2,3) can be eaten at t=43 or t=44.\n\nLife span at t=43: for (2,3), life span was 3 at t=42, so at t=43, life span 2, can be eaten t=43 or t=44.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) life span 5 at t=42, so t=43 life span 4.\n\nTo eat (2,3), I can move to (2,2) at t=43, then to (2,3) at t=44.\n\nOr directly if possible, but from (3,2) to (2,3) is not adjacent, diagonal, so not direct move.\n\nSo move to (2,2) at t=43.\n\nt=43: move L to (2,2), no food (assuming), positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) tail (1,5)\n\nHead direction L\n\nt=44: move U to (2,3), eat food, grow to 9: positions [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) ] and tail (1,5) stays? After move and eat, positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) tail (1,5)\n\nHead direction U\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move to (1,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so only (1,3) left or down to (2,1) etc.\n\nMove to (1,3) at t=45: eat food there, grow to 10: positions [ (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) ] and (1,5) stays?

After move and eat, positions: [ (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] tail (1,5)\n\nHead direction U\n\nThen I can move to (4,4) or (5,3) or (3,3) body, etc.\n\n(4,4) free, (5,3) free.\n\nSo more open.\n\nAnd I ate (4,3) at t=44, within its life span.\n\nMissed (2,3) and (1,3), but (2,3) expired at t=44, so if not eaten by t=44, gone.\n\n(1,3) until t=46, but I might not reach it.\n\nBut with snake on right, I can survive longer.\n\nSo for long-term survival, moving right or down might be better.\n\nBut moving down then right to eat (4,3) later.\n\nIn terms of score, if I move left, I eat two foods but risk death; if move right, eat one; if move down then to (4,3), eat one.\n\nBut with move down then to (4,3), I eat (4,3) at t=44, same as moving right at t=42.\n\nAt t=42 move down, t=43 move to (4,2), t=44 move to (4,3) eat.\n\nSimilarly, if move right at t=42, eat at t=42.\n\nSo one food eaten.\n\nBut if I move down at t=42, I can potentially eat (2,3) but with risk.\n\nPerhaps the safest is to move right at t=42 to eat (4,3) and move to open space.\n\nThen I can plan to stay alive.\n\nSince the food at (2,3) has short life, and I can eat it only if I move left now, but that might be risky, I think for long-term, it's better to avoid the corner.\n\nSo I think moving right at t=42 is the best choice.\n\nThen for the sequence, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output should be a sequence for the current and future turns.\n\nThe boxed answer should have Turn 42: action, Turn 43: action, etc.\n\nBut I need to decide how many to list.\n\nProbably for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince the state changes, I can plan a path.\n\nLet's decide on a path.\n\nAt t=42, move R to (4,3), eat food.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nt=43: from (4,3), move R to (5,3), no food.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nt=44: from (5,3), move R to (6,3), no food.\n\nHead direction R.\n\nt=45: from (6,3), move D to (6,2), no food (since (6,2) no food).\n\nHead direction D.\n\nt=46: from (6,2), move L to (5,2), no food.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can include eating other foods if possible, but (1,3) might be too far.\n\nAt t=46, from (5,2), I can move to (5,1) but obstacle, or (4,2), or (5,3), etc.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nFor the output, I can list from t=42 to t=46 or t=47.\n\nSince the food at (1,3) has life span 5 at t=42, so at t=46 life span 1, can be eaten t=46.\n\nBut at t=46, if I'm at (5,2), far from (1,3), so impossible to eat, so it will disappear.\n\nSo only one food eaten.\n\nBut survival is key.\n\nTo maximize, I could have eaten (2,3) if I moved left, but with risk.\n\nI think for the AI, long-term survival is priority, so moving right is better.\n\nPerhaps move down at t=42 to (3,2), then to (4,2) at t=43, then to (4,3) at t=44 to eat, same as above.\n\nBut with move down first, I have the option to go left or right.\n\nAt t=42 move D to (3,2)\n\nt=43: move R to (4,2)\n\nt=44: move U to (4,3) eat\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut at t=43 I could move to (2,2) to go for (2,3), but I think it's risky.\n\nSo I think moving right directly or via down is fine.\n\nBut moving right directly eats the food earlier, which might be better for score, but since it's the same, no difference.\n\nEating earlier or later, but the food is there until life span.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I'll go with moving right at t=42.\n\nThen for the sequence, let's list 5 turns.\n\nTurn 42: R (right)\n\nTurn 43: R (to (5,3))\n\nTurn 44: R (to (6,3))\n\nTurn 45: D (down to (6,2))\n\nTurn 46: L (left to (5,2))\n\nBut at turn 46, from (6,2), move L to (5,2).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nSince the grid has obstacles, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), I can move to (5,3) or (4,2), etc.\n\nBut for now, this sequence should work.\n\nTo be safe, I can output this.\n\nBut in the move at t=45, from (6,3) to (6,2), and t=46 to (5,2).\n\nNo problem.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned a sequence of moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Priorities**: All food is positive (+1 score, +1 length), but (2,3) has a short life span (disappears after turn 44) and is in a congested area with obstacles and the snake's body. Eating it risks trapping the snake. (1,3) has a longer life span (until turn 46) but is also in the congested top-left. (4,3) is centrally located with a long life span (until turn 49) and allows access to open spaces on the right.\n- **Survival Risks**: The snake is long (8 segments) and the grid has limited space due to obstacles. Moving left or down to eat (2,3) or (1,3) risks cornering the snake in the top-left, increasing collision risk. Moving right to eat (4,3) provides more maneuvering room and avoids immediate traps.\n- **Movement Constraints**: Current head direction is down (D), so reverse move (up) is not allowed on turn 42. Subsequent moves avoid reverses and respect obstacles/walls.\n- **5-Turn Plan**: The sequence below eats (4,3) immediately for +1 score, then moves right and down to open areas for safety. This avoids the risky left side and ensures the snake can survive beyond turn 47. Missing (2,3) and (1,3) is acceptable for long-term survival.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 42 to 46)**:\n- Turn 42: Move right (R) to (4,3), eating the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 9).\n- Turn 43: Move right (R) to (5,3), no food, safe move to open space.\n- Turn 44: Move right (R) to (6,3), no food, continues to open area.\n- Turn 45: Move down (D) to (6,2), no food, avoids obstacle at (6,4) and wall.\n- Turn 46: Move left (L) to (5,2), no food, positions snake for further exploration (e.g., to (5,3) or (4,2) on later turns).\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats one food safely, avoids all collisions, and maintains access to the larger right and bottom areas for future turns. Beyond turn 46, the snake can navigate freely to find new food or avoid risks.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: R (right)\nTurn 43: R (right)\nTurn 44: R (right)\nTurn 45: D (down)\nTurn 46: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 43. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume, since x and y go from 0 to 7.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving right to get to (4,3) from previous position. Since positions are given with head first, and previous head was probably (3,3), since it moved right to (4,3).\n\nCurrent head is (4,3), and it came from (3,3), which is left of it, so yes, direction is right.\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,3) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,3) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders are walls, so all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head at (4,3), body: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nSo let's list the snake positions:\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 2: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 3: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 4: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 5: (2,6)\n\n- Segment 6: (1,6)\n\n- Segment 7: (1,5)\n\n- Segment 8: (1,4)\n\nTail is at (1,4).\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (2,3): life span 2, so it disappears after 2 turns, meaning on turn 45 it will be gone if not eaten. Since current turn is 43, it has this turn and next turn to be eaten. Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 43, life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 43 or 44, gone by turn 45.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) life span 4, so available for 4 turns: 43,44,45,46, gone on 47.\n\n(6,3) life span 10, available for 10 turns from 43 to 52.\n\nNow, head is at (4,3), direction right.\n\nPossible moves: since direction is right, I can go right, up, or down, but not left because that would be instant reverse? No, instant reverse means I can't go opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so I came from left. So I cannot move left immediately because that would be back to (3,3), which is the body. But the rule is: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left to (3,3).\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (4,4)), D (down to (4,2)), R (right to (5,3)), but not L.\n\nNow, I need to consider what cells are safe.\n\nFirst, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nAlso internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow, let's see the positions relative to head.\n\nHead at (4,3).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (4,4) - is this safe? Let's see what's at (4,4). From snake positions, (4,4) is not occupied by snake body? Snake is at: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), etc. (4,4) is not listed, so it should be empty. But is it a wall? x=4, y=4, not border, not internal obstacle listed, so should be free. But let's confirm internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (2,4) is an obstacle? (2,4) is in the list, but (4,4) is not, so (4,4) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, D: (4,2) - not border, not obstacle, not snake body? Snake body: (4,3) is head, but (4,2) not listed, so free.\n\nR: (5,3) - not border, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,1) is one, but (5,3) is different. (6,1) is obstacle, but (5,3) should be free.\n\nL: not possible, as instant reverse.\n\nAlso, need to check for collisions. Moving to a cell with body is deadly, except the tail if it moves away, but we have to be careful.\n\nTail is at (1,4), which is far.\n\nNow, food locations: (2,3), (1,3), (6,3)\n\n(2,3) is close to head. Head at (4,3), (2,3) is left, but I can't move left directly.\n\n(2,3) is at x=2,y=3.\n\nFrom (4,3), how to get to (2,3)? I need to go left, but I can't go left now.\n\nPerhaps through other paths.\n\n(1,3) is at x=1,y=3, which is near the left side.\n\n(6,3) is at x=6,y=3, right side.\n\nLife spans: (2,3) has short life, only 2 turns left, so if I want to eat it, I need to get there soon.\n\nBut I can't go left directly.\n\nNow, let's think about the snake body. The snake body occupies several cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nNotice that (3,3) is directly left of head, but I can't go there.\n\nThe food at (2,3) is at (2,3). Is (2,3) occupied by body? Snake positions: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), etc. (2,3) is not listed, so it should be empty, but food is there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is food, not body.\n\nBut (1,3) might be under the body? No, body is at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), but (1,3) is different cell.\n\ny=3, x=1.\n\nBody has (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), so (1,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is free.\n\nNow, to eat (2,3), since head is at (4,3), I need to move to (3,3) first, but (3,3) is the first body segment, so I can't move there directly because it's occupied.\n\nBut according to the rules, if the body moves away, I can eat it later.\n\nSpecifically for food under body: it says food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nBut in this case, (2,3) has food, and it's not under body; it's empty.\n\n(2,3) is a separate cell.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake:\n\n- (4,3) head\n\n- (3,3) body\n\n- (3,4) body\n\n- (3,5) body\n\n- (2,5) body\n\n- (2,6) body\n\n- (1,6) body\n\n- (1,5) body\n\n- (1,4) tail\n\nFood: (2,3), (1,3), (6,3)\n\n(2,3) is at x=2,y=3. Is this occupied? From snake, no, so it's free with food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) free with food.\n\n(6,3) free with food.\n\nNow, obstacles: walls at borders, and internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is an obstacle, which is at x=2,y=4.\n\nBut (2,3) is y=3, different.\n\nBack to moves from (4,3):\n\nPossible actions: U, D, R\n\n- U: to (4,4)\n\nWhat is at (4,4)? Not snake, not wall, not obstacle. So safe to move.\n\n- D: to (4,2) - similarly, should be safe.\n\n- R: to (5,3) - safe.\n\nNow, if I move U to (4,4), then new head position (4,4), direction up.\n\nThen body moves: the tail (1,4) will move, so the cell (1,4) becomes free if no food, but there might be food.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns to eat food and avoid dead ends.\n\nSince (2,3) has short life, I should consider if I can eat it.\n\nBut to reach (2,3), I need to go to (3,3) first, but (3,3) is occupied now.\n\nIf I move away, and the body moves, then (3,3) might be free later.\n\nLet's simulate the body movement.\n\nCurrent snake: positions from head to tail: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nIf I move up to (4,4), then new head (4,4), and the body: the segment at (3,3) will be removed? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, and tail end is removed, unless food is eaten.\n\nStandard snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail is removed. If food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail not removed, so snake grows.\n\nIn this case, if I move to a cell without food, snake moves, tail is cut off.\n\nIf to food, snake grows, tail stays.\n\nBut here, all food is positive, so eating grows snake.\n\nNow, for (4,3), if I move U to (4,4), which has no food, so new positions: head (4,4), then the body: since head moved, the first body segment becomes new second, etc., so new positions: head (4,4), then (4,3) becomes body, then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — and tail (1,4) is removed, so snake has 8 segments now? Original 9 segments.\n\nPositions: 9 cells.\n\nAfter move: head to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so 8 segments.\n\nLet's index: let's say segment 0: head (4,3), seg1: (3,3), seg2: (3,4), seg3: (3,5), seg4: (2,5), seg5: (2,6), seg6: (1,6), seg7: (1,5), seg8: tail (1,4)\n\nIf move to new head position, say (4,4), no food, then new snake: head (4,4), seg1: (4,3), seg2: (3,3), seg3: (3,4), seg4: (3,5), seg5: (2,5), seg6: (2,6), seg7: (1,6), seg8: (1,5) — and (1,4) is removed, so tail is now (1,5).\n\nSegments: 9 positions, after move, head new, and the last segment is removed, so 8 positions.\n\nNew list: [ (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] — (1,5) is new tail, and (1,4) gone.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (4,2), same thing.\n\nIf I move R to (5,3), no food, then new head (5,3), body [ (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ], tail (1,5), (1,4) gone.\n\nBut (1,5) was body, now tail.\n\nNow, back to food at (2,3). It is at (2,3), and currently not occupied, but to eat it, I need to move head to (2,3).\n\nFrom current position (4,3), I can go left, but can't, or I need to go around.\n\nFor example, if I go up to (4,4), then from there, I could go left to (3,4), but (3,4) is currently body, but after move, it might be different.\n\nLet's think about accessing (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is adjacent to (3,3), (2,4), (1,3), (2,2), but (2,4) is an obstacle, so not accessible from there.\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,3): (3,3) right, (2,4) up, (1,3) left, (2,2) down.\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, so only (3,3), (1,3), (2,2) are possible access points.\n\n(1,3) has food too, but let's see.\n\nCurrently, (3,3) is occupied by body.\n\nIf the snake moves, and the body moves away from (3,3), then (3,3) could be free later.\n\nFor example, if I move head away from (3,3), say up or down or right, then when the body moves, (3,3) might be vacated.\n\nBut let's see the body movement.\n\nThe cell (3,3) is the first body segment. When the snake moves, if head moves to a new cell, this segment will move to where the head was, but since it's body, it will be occupied until the snake moves and the tail moves.\n\nSpecifically, after one move, if I move head to (4,4), then new positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), etc., so (3,3) is still occupied, by the third segment now.\n\nIn the new list: [ (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), ... ] so (3,3) is still occupied.\n\nAfter another move, if I move head from (4,4) to, say, (4,5) or something, then new head position, body (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), etc., so (3,3) is still occupied.\n\nThe cell (3,3) will only be free when the tail moves past it, but the tail is at (1,4), which is far.\n\nCurrent tail is (1,4). When the snake moves, if no food eaten, tail moves to (1,5) or something, but (1,4) is vacated only if tail moves away.\n\nBut (3,3) is near the head, so it will take many moves for the tail to reach there, but since the snake is moving, the body segments shift.\n\nThe cell (3,3) is occupied as long as there is a body segment there, which will be until the part of the body that is at (3,3) now moves away.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (3,3) will move to (4,3) if the head moves right, but head can't move left.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nSuppose at turn 43, I move up to (4,4).\n\nThen new snake: head (4,4), body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — tail (1,5)\n\nNow, (3,3) is still occupied.\n\nThen at turn 44, from (4,4), I can move U, D, L, R, but not down, because down would be to (4,3), which is now body, and direction would be down if I move down.\n\nCurrent head direction after move: I moved up, so direction is U.\n\nSo from (4,4), direction U, so I can move U, L, R, but not D (instant reverse).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\n(3,4) is currently body, but after this move, if I move to (3,4), I would be moving to a body cell, which is deadly, unless it's the tail and it moves.\n\nBut (3,4) is not the tail; tail is at (1,5).\n\nIf I move to (3,4), it's occupied by body, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) or (5,4) might be free.\n\n(4,5): not border, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (4,5) not listed, so free.\n\n(5,4): not listed, but (6,4) is obstacle, (5,4) should be free.\n\n(3,4) is occupied, so I cannot move there.\n\nSo from (4,4), I can go U to (4,5), or R to (5,4), or L to (3,4) but not possible, or D not possible.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (4,5), new head (4,5), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) — tail (1,6), (1,5) removed.\n\n(3,3) still occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (5,4), new head (5,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), etc., same thing.\n\n(3,3) remains occupied for several turns because it's part of the body near the head.\n\nIn fact, to free (3,3), I need the snake to move so that the segment that was at (3,3) moves to (4,3) or something.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (3,3) will only move when the head moves in a way that shifts the body.\n\nFor example, if I keep moving, after 8 moves or so, the current position of (3,3) might be where the tail is, but it's messy.\n\nThe cell (3,3) will be occupied until the body segment that is currently there moves away, which happens when the snake moves and that segment advances.\n\nBut since the snake is long, it will take time.\n\nSpecifically, the distance from head to the segment at (3,3) is 1, so after 1 move, that segment moves to (4,3) if head moves right, but head can't move left.\n\nSuppose at turn 43, I move right to (5,3).\n\nThen new snake: head (5,3), body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — tail (1,5)\n\n(3,3) is still occupied.\n\nThen at turn 44, from (5,3), direction R, so I can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), new head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) occupied.\n\nOr move D to (5,2), etc.\n\nThe point is, (3,3) is occupied for the next few turns because it's close to the head.\n\nIn fact, since the snake has 9 segments, the cell (3,3) will be occupied for at least 8 more moves if no food is eaten, because each move the tail is removed, so the body shortens, but the segment at (3,3) will move to the next position only when the head moves, but the cell itself changes.\n\nThe cell (3,3) will be vacated when the tail moves past it, but the tail is at (1,4), which is not near.\n\nThe segment currently at (3,3) will be at position i in the body. When the snake moves, that segment moves to the position of the previous head or something.\n\nIt's easier to think that the cell (3,3) will be occupied until the body part that is there now leaves it, which happens when the snake moves and that body segment advances to the next cell.\n\nBut the next cell depends on the movement.\n\nFor example, if the head moves in a direction, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front.\n\nSo the segment at (3,3) will move to where the head was at the previous move.\n\nAt turn 43, if I move head to (5,3), then the segment that was at (3,3) moves to (4,3) because the head was at (4,3) and moved to (5,3), so the first body segment moves to (4,3).\n\nThen the cell (3,3) is now occupied by the next segment, which was at (3,4)? Let's not confuse.\n\nAfter move to (5,3), new positions: head (5,3), then body segments: the old head position (4,3) becomes new first body segment, so (4,3) is occupied. Then the old first body segment (3,3) becomes new second body segment, so (3,3) is still occupied. Then old second body segment (3,4) becomes new third, at (3,4), and so on.\n\nSo the cell (3,3) is still occupied, but by a different segment.\n\nIt will remain occupied until the tail moves away, but the tail is far, so for many moves.\n\nSpecifically, the cell (3,3) will be free only when the segment that is currently at (3,3) has moved away, which will take as many moves as the distance to the tail.\n\nThe segment at (3,3) is the first body segment, so it is 1 step from head. When the head moves, this segment moves to the head's previous position, so it doesn't leave (3,3) immediately; it stays until the next move.\n\nAt move turn 43, if head moves to new position, the segment at (3,3) moves to (4,3) if head was at (4,3) and moved, so it leaves (3,3) and goes to (4,3).\n\nWhen head moves from (4,3) to new cell, say (5,3), then the body segment that was at (3,3) moves to the position that was previously occupied by the head, which is (4,3). So it moves from (3,3) to (4,3), thus vacating (3,3).\n\nThen, the cell (3,3) is now free, but it may be occupied by another segment or not.\n\nAfter the move, the new body at (4,3) is from the old head, and the old first body segment at (3,3) is now at (4,3), so (3,3) is vacated, and the next body segment, which was at (3,4), moves to (3,3)? No.\n\nPositions before move:\n\nHead: (4,3)\n\nSeg1: (3,3)\n\nSeg2: (3,4)\n\nSeg3: (3,5)\n\n etc.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,3):\n\nNew head: (5,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head position, (4,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 position, (3,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 position, (3,4)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 position, (3,5)\n\n and so on.\n\nSo after move, the cell (3,3) is now occupied by new seg2, which was old seg1.\n\nBut the cell is still occupied.\n\nThe only way to vacate (3,3) is if no body segment is assigned to it, which happens when the tail moves away, but since new positions include (3,3) as seg2, it is occupied.\n\n(3,3) will be occupied until the snake has moved enough that this position is no longer part of the body, which will take when the tail is beyond this point.\n\nFor example, after 7 more moves with no food eaten, the tail will have moved, and the body will be shorter, but the cell (3,3) might be free if the snake has moved away.\n\nBut it's not guaranteed.\n\nIn this case, since the snake is moving, (3,3) might be free soon.\n\nFrom above, after one move to (5,3), (3,3) is still occupied by seg2.\n\nAfter another move, say from (5,3) to (5,4), then new head (5,4), new seg1 (5,3), new seg2 (4,3), new seg3 (3,3), so (3,3) occupied by seg3.\n\nAnd so on. The cell (3,3) remains occupied by some body segment for several moves.\n\nIt will only be free when the segment that was at (3,3) has been removed as tail or something.\n\nThe distance from the segment at (3,3) to the tail: the segment at (3,3) is the first body segment, and tail is at (1,4), which is 7 segments away (seg1 to seg8, but positions: from seg1 to tail is 8 steps? Let's count indices.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (4,3), index 1: (3,3), index 2: (3,4), index 3: (3,5), index 4: (2,5), index 5: (2,6), index 6: (1,6), index 7: (1,5), index 8: tail (1,4)\n\nSo the segment at index 1, (3,3), is 7 steps from the tail (index 8).\n\nWhen the snake moves with no food eaten, each move the tail is removed, so after one move, the tail index 8 is removed, so the segment at index 1 is now at a lower index, but still in the body.\n\nAfter k moves with no food, the segment that was at index 1 will be at index 1 - k or something, but since tail is removed, the body shortens.\n\nAfter one move no food, the new body has 8 segments: new index 0 head, new index 1 old index 0, new index 2 old index 1, ..., new index 8 old index 7.\n\nOld index 7 is (1,5), which becomes new tail.\n\nOld index 1 (3,3) becomes new index 2.\n\nAfter two moves, old index 1 becomes new index 3, and so on.\n\nAfter 7 moves with no food, old index 1 would be at new index 8, which is the tail, and on the next move, it would be removed, so the cell is vacated.\n\nBut after 7 moves, the snake has moved, so the position might be different.\n\nFor the cell (3,3) to be free, the body must have moved away from it.\n\nIn this case, since the segment at (3,3) will move to a new position when the snake moves, but the cell (3,3) may be reoccupied later or not.\n\nFrom the first move, when head moves, the segment at (3,3) moves to (4,3) if head moved right, so (3,3) is vacated, but then in the new position, (4,3) is occupied, and (3,3) is empty unless something else.\n\nIn the example, when head moves from (4,3) to (5,3), the segment at (3,3) moves to (4,3), so it leaves (3,3), and since no other segment moves to (3,3), it becomes free.\n\nThen, the cell (3,3) is free after the move.\n\nSimilarly, if I move head to (4,4), then segment at (3,3) moves to (4,3), so (3,3) is vacated.\n\nAfter any move, the cell that was occupied by the first body segment is vacated, because that segment moves to the head's old position.\n\nIn general, when the snake moves, the cell that was the position of the first body segment is left empty, because that segment moves to the previous head position.\n\nFor example, current: head at H, body at B1, B2, B3, ..., Bk tail.\n\nAfter move head to H_new, no food: new head H_new, new body: H (old head), B1, B2, ..., B_{k-1} (old Bk-1, but Bk is tail removed).\n\nNew positions: new head at H_new, new body segment 1 at old head position H, new body segment 2 at old B1 position, new body segment 3 at old B2 position, ..., new body segment k at old B_{k-1} position.\n\nSo the cell that was B1 is now occupied by new body segment 2, which is old B1 position, but new segment is at old position, but the cell is the same.\n\nThe cell of old B1 is now occupied by new body segment 2.\n\nBut the value: the cell that was B1 is still occupied by a body segment, just a different one.\n\nThe only cells that are vacated are the old tail position if no food eaten, and the new head position was free.\n\nIn terms of freeing cells, only the tail position is vacated when tail moves, other body cells may change but are still occupied.\n\nSpecifically, the cell (3,3) is occupied by a body segment at all times until the tail moves past it, which takes many moves.\n\nIn this case, for (3,3) to be free, I need the snake to move so that the tail is at (3,3) and then moves away.\n\nBut currently tail is at (1,4), so it will take at least the Manhattan distance moves.\n\nDistance from (1,4) to (3,3) is |1-3| + |4-3| = 2+1=3, but since the snake is long, it may take more.\n\nBut roughly, after several moves, (3,3) could be free.\n\nBut for the food at (2,3), with life span 2, it will disappear after turn 44, so I have only this turn and next to eat it.\n\nAt turn 43, I am at (4,3), (2,3) is two cells away, but I can't move directly to it because (3,3) is occupied and I can't move left.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move D to (4,2), then from there to (3,2) or (4,1), but (4,1) may be wall or something.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) not obstacle.\n\nBut from (4,2), I can move left to (3,2), then to (3,3) or (2,2), but (3,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nLet's see if I can reach (2,3) in two moves.\n\nFrom (4,3), possible paths:\n\n- Move D to (4,2), then from (4,2) move L to (3,2), but (3,2) is not (2,3), (2,3) is at (2,3), which is not adjacent to (3,2). (3,2) to (2,3) is diagonal, not adjacent, so I can't move directly.\n\nCells are adjacent only up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), (4,2) but (4,2) is previous.\n\nBut (3,3) may be occupied.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go to (3,2) or to (4,1) or (5,2), but not to (2,3) directly.\n\nFrom (4,3), move U to (4,4), then from (4,4) move L to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, and I can't move to it because it's occupied.\n\nSimilarly, move R to (5,3), then from (5,3) I can move U, D, R, not L, so to (5,4), (5,2), (6,3), not to (4,3) which is body.\n\nNone of these get me closer to (2,3) in one or two moves.\n\nThe shortest path to (2,3) requires moving to (3,3) first, but (3,3) is occupied and will be for some time.\n\nWith life span 2, it's impossible to eat (2,3) because I can't reach it in time. It's two cells away, but with an occupied cell in between, and I can't move through it.\n\nSo probably, I should give up on (2,3) and focus on other food.\n\n(2,3) has life span 2, so if I don't eat it now or next turn, it's gone.\n\nBut since I can't eat it, it will disappear.\n\nNow, other food: (1,3) at (1,3), life span 4, so available for turns 43,44,45,46.\n\n(6,3) at (6,3), life span 10, plenty of time.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nCurrent head position (4,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), R to (5,3)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option.\n\nFirst, move R to (5,3): (5,3) is free, no food, so snake moves, no growth, tail removed.\n\nThen new head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nFrom there, I can go to (6,3), which has food, life span 10.\n\n(6,3) is adjacent right.\n\nBut is (6,3) safe? (6,3) is not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), but (6,3) is different, so should be free.\n\nBut walls: x=7 is wall, so (6,3) is not wall, x=6 is ok, x=7 is wall.\n\nSo (6,3) is free.\n\nIf I move R to (5,3) at turn 43, then at turn 44, from (5,3), I can move R to (6,3) and eat the food there.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nWhen I move to (6,3), I eat the food, so snake grows, tail not removed.\n\nBut after eating, the new tail is the old tail, so no collision issue.\n\nAlso, (6,3) is not under body, so no problem.\n\nBut let's see the area around (6,3).\n\n(6,3) has adjacent cells: (5,3), (6,4), (7,3), (6,2)\n\n(7,3) is wall, since x=7 wall.\n\n(6,4) is internal obstacle, so not accessible.\n\n(5,3) is where I came from, so body.\n\n(6,2) might be free.\n\nAfter eating at (6,3), I need to move away, but only (6,2) and (5,3) are adjacent, but (5,3) is body, so I can only move to (6,2) if possible.\n\n(6,2): not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\ny=0 wall, but y=2 not.\n\nSo (6,2) free.\n\nFrom (6,3), after eating, I can move D to (6,2).\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, if I move R to (5,3) at turn 43, then at turn 44 move R to (6,3) and eat.\n\nGood, I get +1 score.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAnother option: move U to (4,4) at turn 43.\n\nThen (4,4) no food, so snake shortens to 8 segments.\n\nNew head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can go U to (4,5) or R to (5,4), since not D or L instant reverse? Direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nPossible: U to (4,5), R to (5,4)\n\nL to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, occupied, so deadly, cannot move there.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (4,5), no food probably, snake shortens more.\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nBut there is food at (1,3), which is left, but I'm going up.\n\nSimilarly, move D to (4,2) at turn 43.\n\n(4,2) no food, new head (4,2), direction D.\n\nThen from (4,2), can move L to (3,2), R to (5,2), or D to (4,1), but not U (instant reverse).\n\n(4,1): not wall, not obstacle? Internal (5,1) obstacle, but (4,1) not, so free.\n\n(3,2) free, (5,2) free.\n\nNow, food at (1,3) is at (1,3), which is accessible from (3,2) or (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle, so from (1,4) or (2,3), but (2,3) has food but short life.\n\n(1,3) adjacent cells: (1,4), (1,2), (2,3), (0,3)\n\n(1,2) obstacle, (0,3) wall, so only (1,4) and (2,3) are access points.\n\n(1,4) is currently tail, but after moves, it may change.\n\n(2,3) may be available.\n\nBut (2,3) life span 2, so at turn 43, if I don't eat, it might be gone soon.\n\nAt turn 43, I can choose to move towards (1,3).\n\nFor example, move D to (4,2) at turn 43.\n\nThen at turn 44, from (4,2), I can move L to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) no food, snake shortens.\n\nNew head (3,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2), U to (3,3), D to (3,1), not R instant reverse.\n\n(2,2): not wall, not obstacle, free.\n\n(3,3): may be occupied or not.\n\n(3,1): free.\n\nThen at turn 45, from (3,2), if I move L to (2,2), then from (2,2) I can move U to (2,3) if available.\n\nBut (2,3) life span 2, so at turn 43, life span 2, so available on turn 43 and 44, gone on 45.\n\nSo at turn 45, (2,3) is gone if not eaten.\n\nIf I am at (2,2) at turn 45, I can move to (2,3) only if it's there, but it's gone.\n\nAt turn 44, from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), but (3,3) may be occupied.\n\nLet's see the state after moves.\n\nAt turn 43: move D to (4,2), no food.\n\nNew snake: head (4,2), body (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — tail (1,5), (1,4) removed.\n\n(3,3) occupied.\n\nTurn 44: from (4,2), direction D, so I can move L, R, D, not U.\n\nMove L to (3,2), no food? Assume no food at (3,2).\n\nNew head (3,2), body (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) — tail (1,6), (1,5) removed.\n\n(3,3) occupied.\n\nNow at (3,2), I can move to (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied by body, so if I move there, collision, die.\n\nSo I cannot move to (3,3).\n\nInstead, move L to (2,2) or D to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) is at (2,3), which is adjacent to (3,3), (2,2), (1,3), (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move to (2,2), then from (2,2) to (2,3) if possible.\n\nAt turn 44, (2,3) is still available? Life span 2 at turn 43, so at turn 43, life span 2, decreases each turn, so at turn 44, life span 1, then turn 45 life span 0, gone.\n\nSo at turn 44, (2,3) is still there with life span 1.\n\nIf I move to (2,2) at turn 44.\n\nFrom above, at turn 44, after moving to (3,2), if I move L to (2,2).\n\nNew head (2,2), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail (2,6), (1,6) removed.\n\n(3,3) still occupied.\n\nNow at (2,2), I can move U to (2,3), since (2,3) is adjacent.\n\nAnd (2,3) has food and is free, not occupied by body.\n\nBody positions: (2,2) is head, (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), etc. (2,3) not occupied, so I can move to (2,3) at turn 45? Turn 45.\n\nAt turn 44, I am at (2,2), and (2,3) is available with life span 1.\n\nAt turn 45, from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3) to eat the food.\n\nBut turn 45 is when life span decreases to 0? Let's clarify life span.\n\nAt turn 43, food (2,3) life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 43 or 44.\n\nAfter turn 44, if not eaten, it disappears, so not available on turn 45.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 43, life span 2, eaten or not, after turn 43, if not eaten, life span becomes 1 for turn 44.\n\nAt turn 44, life span 1, if not eaten, after turn 44, life span 0, gone.\n\nSo available only on turn 43 and 44.\n\nAt turn 45, it is gone.\n\nIn the above, at turn 44, I am at (2,2), and I can move to (2,3) to eat it on turn 44.\n\nBut at turn 44, from (2,2), moving to (2,3) is possible only if it is not occupied and I can move there.\n\nIn the state at turn 44 after I moved to (2,2), the cell (2,3) is free, no body, and no wall, so yes, I can move U to (2,3) and eat it.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 43, if I could reach it, but I can't directly.\n\nSo by moving D then L then U, I can eat (2,3) on turn 44? Let's see the turns.\n\nTurn 43: move D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 44: from (4,2), move L to (3,2)? Earlier I said from (4,2) move L to (3,2), but at turn 44, from (4,2), I can move to (3,2), which is not eating (2,3) yet.\n\nThen at turn 45, from (3,2), I move to (2,2) or to (2,3) directly? From (3,2) to (2,3) is not adjacent; it's diagonal. I can only move to (2,2), (3,3), (3,1), (4,2).\n\n(2,3) is not adjacent to (3,2), so I cannot move directly from (3,2) to (2,3).\n\nI have to go to (2,2) first or (3,3), but (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo from (3,2), I can move to (2,2) at turn 44 or 45.\n\nLet's timeline.\n\nTurn 43: start at (4,3), move D to (4,2) — this is action for turn 43.\n\nAfter move, state for turn 44: head at (4,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 44: from (4,2), I move to (3,2) for example.\n\nAction: move L to (3,2)\n\nThen after move, state for turn 45: head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nNow at turn 45, from (3,2), I can move to (2,2) or other.\n\nBut (2,3) is gone by turn 45, since life span 0.\n\nAt turn 44, when I am at (4,2), (2,3) is still available with life span 1.\n\nBut from (4,2), I cannot reach (2,3) in one move; it's two cells away.\n\nThe only way to eat (2,3) on turn 44 is to be adjacent to it at turn 44.\n\nPossible adjacent cells: (3,3), (2,2), (1,3), (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle.\n\n(3,3) is occupied, so I cannot move to it.\n\n(1,3) has food, but let's see if it's occupied.\n\nAt turn 44, depending on previous moves.\n\nIf I didn't move towards it, (1,3) might be free.\n\nBut from (4,2), I am not adjacent to (2,3).\n\nThe only cells adjacent to (2,3) are (3,3), (2,2), (1,3).\n\n(3,3) is body, occupied.\n\n(2,2) might be free.\n\n(1,3) might be free.\n\nBut from (4,2), I can move to (3,2) or (4,1) or (5,2), not to (2,2) directly.\n\nSo I cannot be at a cell adjacent to (2,3) on turn 44 from this path.\n\nSimilarly, other paths are longer.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (2,3) because I cannot reach it on turn 43 or 44 with the current constraints.\n\nSo I should ignore (2,3) and focus on other food.\n\nNow, food at (1,3) and (6,3).\n\n(1,3) life span 4, so available for turns 43,44,45,46.\n\n(6,3) life span 10, available longer.\n\nNow, let's consider the snake position.\n\nThe snake is clustered on the left side, from x=1 to x=4, y=3 to y=6.\n\nHead at (4,3).\n\nIf I move right to (5,3), I can then go to (6,3) to eat the food there.\n\nIf I move up or down, I might go towards (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is near the tail.\n\nLet's see the tail: tail at (1,4), and (1,3) is below it.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,3) is only accessible from (1,4) or (2,3), but (2,3) will be gone.\n\nSince (2,3) will be gone, (1,3) can be accessed from (1,4) or (0,3) but (0,3) wall, or (1,2) obstacle, so only (1,4) and (2,3), but (2,3) gone, so only from (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is currently tail.\n\nTo eat (1,3), I need to move the head to (1,3) when it is free.\n\nBut (1,3) is not under body; it's free with food.\n\nSo I can move to it if I can get there.\n\nBut to access it, I need to be at (1,4) first, since (2,3) is gone soon.\n\n(1,4) is tail, so when the tail moves, (1,4) might be vacated, but I can move to (1,4) only if it is free.\n\nCurrently, (1,4) is occupied by tail.\n\nIf I move the snake, the tail will move, so (1,4) may be vacated.\n\nFor example, at turn 43, if I move, say, U to (4,4), then tail (1,4) is removed, so (1,4) becomes free.\n\nThen at some point, I can move to (1,4), then to (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) has life span 4, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, if I move towards the left.\n\nBut let's think about the grid and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, which is near.\n\nAlso, the snake body blocks many cells.\n\nPerhaps moving right to eat (6,3) is safer and easier.\n\nLet's plan to eat (6,3) first since it's closer in terms of access.\n\nFrom (4,3), move R to (5,3) at turn 43.\n\nThen at turn 44, from (5,3), move R to (6,3) and eat the food.\n\nScore +1, snake grows to 10 segments.\n\nNew positions after eating: head at (6,3), body includes (5,3), (4,3), etc., tail stays.\n\nThen from (6,3), I need to move. Possible moves: from (6,3), direction R (since moved right).\n\nCan move U, D, L, not R (instant reverse or wall? R would be to (7,3), which is x=7 wall, so cannot move R.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite to direction, but direction is R, so opposite L, but L is to (5,3), which is body, so I cannot move L anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (6,4), but (6,4) is internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nD to (6,2), which should be free.\n\nL to (5,3) but occupied, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,2).\n\nThen move to (6,2).\n\nNo food there, so snake shortens, tail removed.\n\nThen from (6,2), I can move L to (5,2), D to (6,1), but (6,1) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\nU to (6,3) but body or reverse? Direction is D after moving down.\n\nAfter moving to (6,2), direction D.\n\nThen can move L to (5,2), R to (7,2) wall, D to (6,1) obstacle, U to (6,3) but (6,3) is body now, and moving up is opposite to down? Direction is D, so opposite is U, so I cannot move U, instant reverse.\n\nAlso, (6,3) is occupied.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,2).\n\nThen to (5,2), and so on.\n\nBut I might get stuck or something.\n\nAfter eating at (6,3), I have to move down to (6,2), then left to (5,2), etc.\n\nNow, there is food at (1,3) I can go for later.\n\nBut let's see the other option.\n\nIf at turn 43, I move U to (4,4).\n\nThen no food, snake shortens to 8.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction U.\n\nThen at turn 44, I can move U to (4,5) or R to (5,4), since not D or L to (3,4) occupied.\n\nSay move U to (4,5).\n\nNo food, snake shortens to 7.\n\nHead at (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen at turn 45, from (4,5), can move U to (4,6), L to (3,5), R to (5,5), not D.\n\n(4,6) not wall, (3,5) is body? After previous moves, let's see body.\n\nAfter turn 43: moved U to (4,4), snake: head (4,4), body (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) tail\n\nTurn 44: move U to (4,5), new head (4,5), body (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) tail\n\n(3,5) occupied.\n\nAt turn 45, from (4,5), direction U, move to (4,6) or (3,5) or (5,5).\n\n(3,5) occupied, cannot move there.\n\n(4,6) free, (5,5) free.\n\nSay move to (4,6), no food, snake shortens.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut not going towards food.\n\nFrom (4,4) at turn 44, I could move R to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) no food, new head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,3), etc.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,4), but (6,4) obstacle, or (5,5), (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,3) might be free.\n\nBut (6,3) is there, I can go to (6,3) from (5,3).\n\nFor example, at turn 44, from (4,4), move R to (5,4).\n\nThen at turn 45, from (5,4), direction R, can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4) obstacle, L to (4,4) body or reverse? Direction R, opposite L, so cannot move L.\n\nAlso (4,4) body.\n\nSo move U to (5,5) or D to (5,3).\n\nIf move D to (5,3), then (5,3) no food? But (6,3) is adjacent.\n\nAt turn 45, from (5,4) move D to (5,3), no food, snake shortens.\n\nThen at turn 46, from (5,3), can move to (6,3) and eat.\n\nLife span 10, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat it later.\n\nBut moving directly right to (5,3) then (6,3) is faster.\n\nNow, for the food at (1,3), I can plan to eat it after.\n\nBut let's see if it's worth it.\n\nThe grid has obstacles, and the snake is long, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the area near (1,3) has obstacles at (1,2) and (2,4), and walls.\n\nAfter eating (6,3), I might have limited moves.\n\nBut with life span 4, I can go for it.\n\nSince the question is to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival, I should choose a move that keeps options open.\n\nMoving right to (5,3) at turn 43 allows me to eat (6,3) on turn 44, which is good for score.\n\nMoving up or down might lead to less efficient paths.\n\nMoving down to (4,2) might allow me to go towards the bottom, but there is obstacle at (5,1), etc.\n\nBut let's list the actions for 5 turns.\n\nThe answer should be for turns 43,44,45,etc.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but since the state changes, I need to plan conditionally, but the format is to output a sequence of actions for the next turns.\n\nThe format is: for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so I need to decide a sequence.\n\nBut the state changes with each move, so I need to plan based on the initial state.\n\nI can assume no new food spawns, only existing food.\n\nSo let's plan a sequence.\n\nOption 1: move R at turn 43 to (5,3)\n\nThen at turn 44, move R to (6,3) to eat food.\n\nThen at turn 45, from (6,3), only possible move D to (6,2) as discussed.\n\nThen at turn 46, from (6,2), direction D, move L to (5,2) (only choice, since U not possible, D obstacle, R wall)\n\nThen at turn 47, from (5,2), direction L (since moved left), can move U to (5,3), D to (5,1) but (5,1) obstacle, L to (4,2), R to (6,2) body or reverse? Direction L, opposite R, so cannot move R.\n\nAlso (6,2) body.\n\nSo move U to (5,3) or L to (4,2).\n\n(5,3) is body, occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nIf I move to (5,3), it's body, collision.\n\nSo only possible move L to (4,2).\n\nThen to (4,2), and so on.\n\nAt turn 45 after eating at (6,3), positions: head (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) and since ate food, tail not removed, so 10 segments? After eating at (6,3), new head (6,3), body includes the old head and body, so positions: head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) and tail (1,4) not removed, so 10 positions.\n\nThen move D to (6,2), no food, so tail removed, new tail is (1,5), and head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nThen move L to (5,2), new head (5,2), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) tail (2,6), (1,6) removed.\n\nThen from (5,2), direction L, can move U to (5,3), D to (5,1) obstacle, L to (4,2), R to (6,2) body or reverse, cannot.\n\nU to (5,3): (5,3) is occupied by body, so if I move there, collision.\n\nL to (4,2): (4,2) may be free.\n\nSo must move L to (4,2).\n\nThen to (4,2), etc.\n\nSo it's possible, but I'm moving away from the left food.\n\nFor (1,3), I can go later, but it has life span 4, so by turn 46 it might be gone if not eaten.\n\nTurn 43,44,45,46 available.\n\nAt turn 46, I am at (5,2) or something, far from (1,3).\n\nSo I may not be able to eat (1,3).\n\nIf I want to eat (1,3), I should move left or down.\n\nBut I can't move left directly.\n\nMove D to (4,2) at turn 43.\n\nThen at turn 44, from (4,2), move L to (3,2)\n\nThen at turn 45, from (3,2), move L to (2,2)\n\nThen at turn 46, from (2,2), move U to (2,3) but (2,3) gone, or to (1,2) obstacle, or to (2,1), or (3,2) body.\n\nFrom (2,2), can move U to (2,3) but gone, D to (2,1), L to (1,2) obstacle, R to (3,2) body.\n\nSo only D to (2,1) if possible.\n\n(2,1): not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (2,4) but not (2,1), so free.\n\nThen move to (2,1).\n\nBut not towards (1,3).\n\nFrom (3,2) at turn 45, I can move U to (3,3) but occupied, or D to (3,1), etc.\n\nTo reach (1,3), I need to be at (1,4) first.\n\nAt turn 43, if I move U to (4,4), then tail (1,4) is removed, so (1,4) free.\n\nThen at turn 44, from (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) but occupied, or U or R.\n\nNot directly.\n\nPerhaps move to (3,3) when free, but it's not.\n\nAfter moving, (1,4) is free at turn 44 if I moved at turn 43.\n\nAt turn 43, move U to (4,4), then tail removed, (1,4) free.\n\nAt turn 44, I am at (4,4), I can move to (3,4) but occupied, or to (4,5) or (5,4).\n\nNot to (1,4).\n\nI need to navigate to (1,4).\n\nFor example, move from (4,4) to (4,5), then to (3,5), but (3,5) body, or to (4,6), etc.\n\nIt's far, and with obstacles, it might take many turns.\n\nBy turn 46, I might not reach (1,3).\n\nFor instance, from (4,4) at turn 44, move to (4,5), then to (4,6), then to (3,6) or (5,6), but (1,3) is at bottom left.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo probably, the best is to eat the available food at (6,3) which is easy to reach.\n\nThen for long-term, after eating, I can explore other areas.\n\nThere might be more food later, but we don't know.\n\nSo for now, I think moving right to eat (6,3) is good.\n\nAlso, it scores immediately.\n\nSo for turn 43, move R to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 44, move R to (6,3) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 45, move D to (6,2)\n\nThen for turn 46, from (6,2), move L to (5,2)\n\nThen for turn 47, from (5,2), move L to (4,2)\n\nBut at turn 47, from (5,2), after moving to (5,2) at turn 46, direction L, so at turn 47, move L to (4,2)\n\nThen to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to output 5 turns or more.\n\nSince the food at (1,3) might be eaten if possible, but it's risky.\n\nAnother thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (1,4), food at (1,3) is adjacent, but (1,3) is not the tail cell; the tail cell is (1,4), which may not have food.\n\nFood at (1,3) is separate.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut to eat (1,3), I need to move to it when adjacent.\n\nBut as above, hard to reach in time.\n\nSo I think for the sequence, I'll go for (6,3).\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 43: R (to (5,3))\n\nTurn 44: R (to (6,3), eat food)\n\nTurn 45: D (to (6,2))\n\nTurn 46: L (to (5,2))  // from (6,2) move left to (5,2)\n\nTurn 47: L (to (4,2))  // from (5,2) move left to (4,2)\n\nBut at turn 47, from (5,2), after moving to (5,2) at turn 46, direction L, so at turn 47, move L to (4,2) is possible.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move to other directions.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nThe format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince turn 43, I can output up to turn 47 or so.\n\nBut after turn 44, the state changes, so the actions might be fixed based on initial.\n\nIn this sequence, it seems fine.\n\nTo maximize, after eating (6,3), I could go for (1,3), but it might be gone or hard.\n\nAt turn 45, after being at (6,2), I could move to (5,2), then to (5,3), but (5,3) is body, cannot.\n\nSo the sequence above is one way.\n\nPerhaps from (4,3) move D to (4,2) at turn 43, then to (3,2), then to (2,2), then to (2,1) or something, but no food.\n\nI think R to (5,3) is best.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Food Priorities**: The food at (2,3) has a short life span (2 turns) and is inaccessible within the time frame due to the occupied cell at (3,3) and movement constraints. Thus, it is ignored. The food at (6,3) is easily reachable and has a long life span (10 turns), making it a high-value target. The food at (1,3) has a moderate life span (4 turns) but is riskier to reach due to obstacles and the snake's position; it is not prioritized in this sequence to avoid potential dead ends.\n- **Movement Safety**: Avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions. After eating at (6,3), the only safe exit is down to (6,2), then left to avoid the obstacle at (6,4) and walls.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: The sequence ensures the snake moves towards open areas after eating, reducing the risk of trapping itself. Eating (6,3) provides an immediate score increase and growth, which is beneficial for future opportunities.\n\n### Planned Moves (5 turns)\n- **Turn 43**: Move R (right) to (5,3).  \n  - Why: From (4,3), moving right avoids the occupied (3,3) and positions the snake closer to (6,3). Direction is R, so reverse (L) is invalid, and U/D are less optimal as they don't progress toward high-value food.\n- **Turn 44**: Move R (right) to (6,3) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 10).  \n  - Why: (6,3) is safe and reachable. After moving to (5,3), direction is R, so moving R again is valid and achieves the food reward.\n- **Turn 45**: Move D (down) to (6,2).  \n  - Why: After eating at (6,3), direction is R. The only safe move is D (to (6,2)), as U (to (6,4)) is blocked by an obstacle, L (to (5,3)) is occupied by body, and R (to (7,3)) is a wall. Moving D avoids collision.\n- **Turn 46**: Move L (left) to (5,2).  \n  - Why: From (6,2), direction is D. Moving L to (5,2) is the only safe option—U is invalid (instant reverse from D), D (to (6,1)) is an obstacle, and R (to (7,2)) is a wall.\n- **Turn 47**: Move L (left) to (4,2).  \n  - Why: From (5,2), direction is L. Moving L to (4,2) is safe—U (to (5,3)) is occupied by body, D (to (5,1)) is an obstacle, and R (to (6,2)) is invalid (instant reverse) and occupied.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats (6,3) on turn 44 for +1 score. The food at (1,3) is not pursued as it requires navigating through a cluttered area with obstacles (e.g., (1,2), (2,4)), risking entrapment with the snake's increased length after growth.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: The sequence avoids the snake body and obstacles. After turn 47, the snake is at (4,2), with open areas to explore (e.g., moving to (4,1), (3,2), or (5,2) if free), supporting long-term survival.\n- **5+ Turn Horizon**: Planning to turn 47 (5 steps from turn 43) ensures the snake survives and positions itself flexibly. Further moves can target new food or avoid hazards based on the state at turn 47.\n\nThis plan safely secures one food reward and maintains maneuverability.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 43: R\nTurn 44: R\nTurn 45: D\nTurn 46: L\nTurn 47: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 44, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n\nThe border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, the walls occupy the cells, so moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is invalid. Similarly, internal obstacles are given, so I need to avoid those cells.\n\nList the walls:\n\n- Border: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\n- Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo, the snake cannot move to these cells.\n\nNow, snake positions: head is at (5,3), and direction is right (R), which means it was moving right to get to (5,3). Positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]\n\nSo, let's plot this to visualize.\n\nList the snake segments in order:\n\n- Head: (5,3)\n\n- Then (4,3)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,4) — here it turned up or down? From (3,3) to (3,4), that's up if y increases upwards. Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but since walls are at y=0 and y=7, and snake has positions like (1,6) which might be near top, I'll assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so increasing y is up.\n\nIn the snake positions: from (3,3) to (3,4) — y from 3 to 4, so up.\n\nThen (3,4) to (3,5) — up again to (3,5)\n\nThen (3,5) to (2,5) — left to (2,5)\n\nThen (2,5) to (2,6) — up to (2,6)\n\nThen (2,6) to (1,6) — left to (1,6)\n\nThen (1,6) to (1,5) — down to (1,5)\n\nCurrent head at (5,3), moving right, so last move was from (4,3) to (5,3) by moving right.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (2,3) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (1,3) with value 1, life span 3\n\n- (6,3) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll are positive food, value +1 each.\n\nLife span: (2,3) will disappear after this turn, since life span 1, and countdown decreases each turn including current, so after turn 44, it might be gone? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (2,3), life span 1, meaning it will disappear after turn 44. Since we're at turn 44, if we don't eat it now, it will be gone.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 46? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn 44, life span decreases to 0? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose food appears at turn T with life span N. At turn T, the countdown is N. After turn T, it decreases by 1, so at the start of turn T+1, it has N-1 turns left. It disappears when countdown reaches 0 after the turn it was decreased to 0.\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"Disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn, the life span is L. After the turn, it decreases by 1. If after decrease it becomes 0, it disappears.\n\nBut the rule says \"including current\", so let's see.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on the turn it is present, the countdown decreases by one during that turn.\n\nPerhaps: at the start of turn, if food has life span S, it can be eaten during that turn. After the turn, S decreases by 1. If S was 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nFor (2,3), life span 1 at turn 44. If we eat it on turn 44, we get the reward. If not, after turn 44, life span becomes 0 and it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) life span 3 at turn 44, after turn 44 it becomes 2, then after turn 45 it becomes 1, after turn 46 it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\n(6,3) life span 9, so it has many turns left.\n\nNow, my goal is to maximize score by eating food while avoiding risks, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, special cases: food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nIn this state, let's see where food is relative to snake.\n\nFood at (2,3): snake has segments at (3,3), which is adjacent to (2,3). (2,3) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), etc. (2,3) is not in the list, so it's free, but there might be food.\n\n(2,3) has food, and (3,3) is snake body. So (2,3) is adjacent to body at (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) has food, and snake has (1,5) and (1,6), but (1,3) is different cell.\n\n(6,3) has food, and head is at (5,3), so (6,3) is directly to the right of head.\n\nHead at (5,3), direction right, so moving right is towards (6,3).\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nFirst, possible moves from current position.\n\nCurrent head: (5,3), direction R (right), so I can move U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so moving left would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's see what each move does.\n\nFirst, if I move R to (6,3): that cell has food with value +1, life span 9. So I can eat it, snake length increases by 1.\n\nBut I need to check for collisions.\n\n(6,3) is not a wall? Walls: border x=7, y=7, etc., x=7 is wall, so (6,3) is within bounds, x=6, y=3, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, I assume.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so playable x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\n(6,3) is at x=6, y=3, which is not wall, but internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,3) is not listed, so it should be free except for food.\n\nFood is at (6,3), so cell is occupied by food, not obstacle.\n\nMoving to (6,3): I eat the food, so new head position (6,3), and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (6,3), then previous head (5,3) becomes body, so snake becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] — length increased by 1, so tail is still (1,5).\n\nOriginal positions: 9 segments, after eating, 10 segments.\n\nBut is there any collision? After move, head at (6,3), body parts: (5,3), (4,3), etc. (6,3) is not equal to any body part except if it was, but in this case, (6,3) was not occupied before, since food was there, and snake didn't have it.\n\nBefore move, snake occupied cells: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). (6,3) is not in this list, so no collision.\n\nAlso, not wall.\n\nBut (6,3) is at x=6, which is not x=7, so it's fine.\n\nx=6 is within 1 to 6.\n\nNow, if I move U to (5,4): what is there? No food listed, but I need to check if it's free.\n\nFood positions are only (2,3), (1,3), (6,3), so (5,4) has no food, so just move, no eat, tail moves.\n\nIf I move to (5,4), head to (5,4), then body follows, so tail (1,5) is removed, new positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)] — tail (1,5) gone, and (1,6) is now the last? Positions: head to (5,4), then previous head (5,3) becomes second, then (4,3), and so on, up to (1,6), and (1,5) is dropped since no growth.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (5,2): (5,2) is free? No food, not wall, I think.\n\nWalls: y=0 is wall, so (5,2) y=2, not 0. Internal obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut let's list all blocked cells.\n\nWalls:\n\n- Border: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Since grid, cells like (0,y) for y=0 to7, (7,y) for y=0 to7, (x,0) for x=0 to7, (x,7) for x=0 to7. But playable area is inside, so cells (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6 are playable except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1): x=5,y=1, which is bottom row, y=1.\n\n(6,1): x=6,y=1\n\n(2,4): x=2,y=4\n\n(6,4): x=6,y=4\n\n(1,2): x=1,y=2\n\nSo blocked cells: all border walls + these internal.\n\nFor example, (5,1) is blocked, (5,2) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) should be free, no food.\n\n(6,3) has food.\n\nBack to moves.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (6,3) - eat food, grow to length 10, head now at (6,3), direction R.\n\nThen next moves possible.\n\nBut I need to think ahead 5 turns.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (5,4) - no eat, head to (5,4), direction U.\n\nOption 3: Move D to (5,2) - no eat, head to (5,2), direction D.\n\nNow, food at (2,3) with life span 1, must be eaten this turn or lost.\n\nBut can I eat it this turn? Head at (5,3), (2,3) is at distance, not adjacent. Adjacent cells to head: (5,3) has neighbors: (5,4) up, (5,2) down, (6,3) right, (4,3) left but left is not possible since reverse not allowed, and (4,3) is body, but even if not, reverse not allowed.\n\nSo I cannot reach (2,3) this turn; it's too far. So (2,3) will disappear after this turn; I cannot eat it, so it's lost. No point considering.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is at (1,3), which is left and down a bit, but not adjacent.\n\n(6,3) is adjacent right.\n\nSo only possible food to eat now is (6,3) by moving right.\n\nBut I should consider not eating it if there's a risk.\n\nWhat about the food under body or tail danger.\n\nFirst, is there food under body? Food at (2,3): snake has (3,3) which is adjacent, but (2,3) is not under snake body; it's a separate cell. Snake occupies (3,3), but (2,3) is free with food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is free, (6,3) free.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nCurrent tail is at (1,5). Head is at (5,3), not adjacent to (1,5); distance is far.\n\nAdjacent means one cell away: up, down, left, right.\n\n(1,5) to (5,3) is not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, moving to (6,3) seems safe and beneficial.\n\nBut let's see the grid after move.\n\nAfter moving to (6,3), snake: head (6,3), body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\nNow, direction is R.\n\nFrom (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), but (5,3) is now the body segment, and moving left would be towards (5,3), which is occupied, so collision.\n\nAlso, moving left is opposite to current direction R? Current direction is R, moving left is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nBut R to (7,3): x=7 is wall, so cannot move there.\n\nx=7 is border wall, so (7,3) invalid.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nU to (6,4): what is there? (6,4) is an internal obstacle! From the list: internal obstacles include (6,4), so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n\nD to (6,2): is that free? (6,2) not listed as wall or obstacle, so should be free.\n\ny=2, x=6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, (6,2) not listed, so free.\n\nAlso, no food there currently.\n\nSo from (6,3), only possible move is D to (6,2), since U to (6,4) is obstacle, R to (7,3) is wall, L not allowed.\n\nSo I must move down to (6,2).\n\nThen head at (6,2), direction D.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: L to (5,2)? Left is x-1, so (5,2), or R to (7,2) invalid, or U to (6,3) but (6,3) is now body? After moving to (6,2), snake positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), etc.\n\n(6,3) is the previous head, now body.\n\nMoving U to (6,3) would be into body, collision.\n\nMoving R to (7,2) invalid.\n\nMoving D to (6,1): but (6,1) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) should be free.\n\nThen head to (5,2), direction L.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this seems constrained.\n\nIf I move to (6,3) now, I end up in a corner with limited moves.\n\nBut I need to consider other options for turn 44.\n\nInstead of moving right, I could move up or down.\n\nMove U to (5,4): no food, head to (5,4), direction U.\n\nThen snake moves, tail shortens, so positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]  // tail (1,5) gone\n\nNow, head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but (5,3) is now body, and moving down is opposite? Current direction U, moving D is opposite, not allowed.\n\nL to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle, so invalid.\n\nSo possible: U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nR to (6,4) is wall, not possible.\n\nD not allowed.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (5,2): head to (5,2), direction D.\n\nThen moves: D to (5,1) but (5,1) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nU to (5,3) which is body, and opposite direction? Current direction D, moving U is opposite, not allowed.\n\nL to (4,2), R to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) should be free.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n\nBut (5,1) is obstacle, so down not possible.\n\nNow, back to turn 44 choices.\n\nIf I move right to (6,3), I eat food and grow, but then I'm stuck at (6,3) and must go down to (6,2), then left to (5,2), etc. But after that, I might have space.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (1,3) with life span 3, so I have until turn 46 to eat it? Turn 44: life span 3, after turn 44 it becomes 2, after turn 45 becomes 1, after turn 46 becomes 0 and disappears. So I can eat it on turn 44,45, or 46.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) has life span 9, many turns.\n\nBut (2,3) is gone after this turn.\n\nNow, if I don't eat (6,3) now, I can leave it for later, but I might be able to eat other food.\n\nFor example, if I move up to (5,4), then I can go towards (1,3) or something.\n\nLet's plan a path to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at x=1,y=3.\n\nHead at (5,3), I can move up to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then down to (4,3), but (4,3) is body now? After moving to (5,4), positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), ...] so (4,3) is body.\n\nIf I move from (5,4) to (4,4), that's left, direction L.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move down to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by body? At that time, when I move to (4,4), snake is [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), ...] let's simulate.\n\nTurn 44: move U to (5,4)\n\nPositions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)  // tail (1,5) gone, so 8 segments? Original 9, no growth, so 8 segments.\n\nLength was 9, after move no eat, so length 8.\n\nSegments: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) — 9 positions? Head and 8 body? Snake positions list: head and body segments, so number of elements is length.\n\nStart: 9 positions.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) no eat: new head (5,4), add to front, remove last, so positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)] — yes, 9 segments, but last is now (1,6), (1,5) removed.\n\n(1,6) was previously there, but now tail is (1,6).\n\nNow turn 45: from (5,4), I can move L to (4,4) or U to (5,5).\n\nSay I move L to (4,4), direction L.\n\nPositions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)  // tail (1,6) gone.\n\nNow head at (4,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,4)? But (3,4) is body? Positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), ... (3,4) is the sixth segment, so when I move to (4,4), (3,4) is still occupied.\n\nFrom (4,4), neighbors: U (4,5), D (4,3), L (3,4), R (5,4)\n\nR (5,4) is body, occupied.\n\nL to (3,4): (3,4) is in positions, it's a body segment, so if I move there, collision.\n\nD to (4,3): (4,3) is body, occupied.\n\nU to (4,5): might be free.\n\n(4,5) not listed as wall or obstacle.\n\nAlso, current direction L, so moving R to (5,4) is opposite, not allowed.\n\nMoving U or D is perpendicular.\n\nSo possible: U to (4,5) or D to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied, or L to (3,4) occupied.\n\nOnly U to (4,5) is possible? D to (4,3) occupied, L to (3,4) occupied, R not allowed, so only U to (4,5).\n\nThen head to (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut I want to go to (1,3), which is left and down.\n\nThis might be inefficient.\n\nFrom (5,4), I could move U to (5,5) instead.\n\nBut let's think differently.\n\nAnother option: on turn 44, move down to (5,2).\n\nHead to (5,2), direction D.\n\nPositions: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]  // (1,5) gone, tail (1,6)\n\nThen from (5,2), moves: L to (4,2), R to (6,2), U to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, and moving up is opposite to current direction D, not allowed.\n\nD to (5,1) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo possible: L to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n\nSay move L to (4,2), then head (4,2), direction L.\n\nThen I can go down or left, but y=2, down to y=1 might be blocked.\n\n(4,1) is not listed, but y=0 is wall, y=1 is playable? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is bottom row.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,1), but (4,1) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) to (4,1) down, or (3,2) left, or (5,2) right but body, or (4,3) up but body.\n\nCurrent direction L, so moving R to (5,2) opposite not allowed.\n\nU to (4,3) occupied.\n\nD to (4,1) possible.\n\nL to (3,2) possible.\n\n Etc.\n\nBut to reach (1,3), it might take several turns.\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), which is near the tail area.\n\nCurrent tail is at (1,6) after some moves.\n\nBut let's consider the risk of moving to (6,3) now.\n\nIf I move to (6,3) on turn 44, I eat food, grow to 10, then I must move down to (6,2) on turn 45, then on turn 46, from (6,2), I can move left to (5,2) or right to (7,2) invalid, or up to (6,3) body, or down to (6,1) obstacle, so only left to (5,2).\n\nMove L to (5,2), head to (5,2), direction L.\n\nThen on turn 47, from (5,2), moves: L to (4,2), R to (6,2), U to (5,3), D to (5,1).\n\nU to (5,3): but (5,3) might be body? Let's see the snake positions.\n\nAfter turn 44: move R to (6,3), eat, so positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]  // 10 segments\n\nTurn 45: move D to (6,2), no eat, so new head (6,2), then body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), ..., up to (1,5), but tail (1,5) removed? No, when no eat, tail moves.\n\nMove to (6,2), no food there, so no growth, so new positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)  // tail (1,5) gone, so 9 segments, tail now (1,6)\n\n(1,5) was tail, removed, so positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) — 10 segments? Head and 9 body, 10 total.\n\nAfter eating on turn 44, length 10.\n\nAfter move to (6,2) no eat on turn 45, so new head (6,2), add to front, remove last, so remove (1,5), which was the last, so positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)] — last is (1,6), so tail at (1,6).\n\nTurn 46: from (6,2), move L to (5,2), no eat, so positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)  // tail (1,6) gone, so 9 segments.\n\nHead at (5,2), direction L.\n\nTurn 47: possible moves from (5,2): L to (4,2), R to (6,2), U to (5,3), D to (5,1).\n\nR to (6,2): (6,2) is body, occupied.\n\nU to (5,3): (5,3) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (5,1): (5,1) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nL to (4,2): might be free.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (4,2).\n\nThen head to (4,2), direction L.\n\nThen turn 48: from (4,2), moves: L to (3,2), R to (5,2) body, U to (4,3), D to (4,1).\n\nR to (5,2) body, occupied.\n\nU to (4,3): (4,3) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (4,1): possible, if free.\n\nL to (3,2): possible.\n\nSo I can go L or D.\n\nBut I'm moving away from the food at (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), and I'm at (4,2) on turn 48, so I can go up to (4,3) but occupied, so need to go around.\n\nBut (4,3) is occupied until the snake moves.\n\nThis seems messy, and I might not reach (1,3) before it disappears.\n\nLife span of (1,3): at turn 44, life 3, after turn 44 life 2, after turn 45 life 1, after turn 46 life 0 gone. So must eat by turn 46.\n\nOn turn 44 I am at (5,3), turn 45 I can be at (5,4) or (5,2) or (6,3).\n\nIf I go to (6,3) on 44, then on 45 at (6,2), 46 at (5,2), 47 at (4,2), not close to (1,3).\n\nIf on turn 44 I move U to (5,4), then on turn 45 I can move L to (4,4), but as before, from (4,4) I can only go U to (4,5), then further away.\n\nFrom (5,4), I could move U to (5,5), then I can go left.\n\nTurn 44: move U to (5,4), positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nTurn 45: move U to (5,5), no eat, positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]  // tail (1,6) gone\n\nHead at (5,5), direction U.\n\nThen moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4) body, L to (4,5), R to (6,5).\n\nD not allowed, opposite.\n\nR to (6,5): might be free, but (6,4) is obstacle, (6,5) not listed, so free.\n\nL to (4,5) free.\n\nU to (5,6): y=6, not y=7, so free, but y=7 wall, y=6 is playable.\n\nSo possible U, L, R.\n\nBut to go to (1,3), I need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (5,5), move L to (4,5), then to (3,5), but (3,5) is body.\n\nAfter move to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)  // tail (2,6) gone\n\n(3,5) is still body.\n\nFrom (4,5), move L to (3,5), but (3,5) occupied, collision.\n\nMove D to (4,4), or U to (4,6), etc.\n\nNot direct.\n\nMove to (2,5) or something.\n\n(2,5) is body, but will move.\n\nPerhaps it's hard to reach (1,3) in time.\n\nDistance: from (5,3) to (1,3) is 4 cells left, but I can't move left directly.\n\nIf I move down to (5,2) on turn 44, then to (4,2) on turn 45, then to (3,2) on turn 46, then to (2,2) or (3,3) but (3,3) body, etc.\n\nOn turn 46, I could be at (2,2), then to (2,3), but (2,3) has food but life span 1 on turn 44, so gone after turn 44, not available.\n\nFor (1,3), on turn 46, if I am at (2,2), I can move to (2,3) or (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle, or (2,1), etc.\n\n(1,2) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nFrom (2,2), move to (2,3), then on turn 47 to (1,3), but (1,3) must be eaten by turn 46, so on turn 46 it has life span 1, can be eaten on turn 46.\n\nLife span at turn 44: 3\n\nAfter turn 44: life 2\n\nAfter turn 45: life 1\n\nAfter turn 46: life 0, gone. So can be eaten on turn 45 or 46? On turn 45, life span is 2? Let's clarify the countdown.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 44, for (1,3), life span 3, meaning it can be eaten during turn 44, and after turn 44, countdown decreases to 2.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 45, life span 2, can be eaten, after turn 45 decreases to 1.\n\nOn turn 46, life span 1, can be eaten, after turn 46 decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSo (1,3) can be eaten on turn 44, 45, or 46.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBack to reaching (1,3).\n\nIf on turn 44 I move down to (5,2), head to (5,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 45: from (5,2), I can move L to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n\nSay move L to (4,2), head to (4,2), direction L.\n\nTurn 46: from (4,2), I can move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1) or U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body.\n\nIf I move L to (3,2), head to (3,2), direction L.\n\nThen on turn 47, from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2) or U to (3,3) but (3,3) body, or D to (3,1), etc.\n\nThen on turn 47 at (2,2), then turn 48 to (2,3) or (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, so to (2,3), then to (1,3) on turn 49, but turn 49 is too late for (1,3), since it disappears after turn 46.\n\nTurn 46 is the last chance to eat (1,3).\n\nOn turn 46, I need to be at (1,3) or adjacent to move in.\n\nFrom above, on turn 46, if I am at (4,2), I can move to (3,2), not to (1,3).\n\nIf on turn 45, from (4,2) I move U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nOr D to (4,1).\n\nNot closer.\n\nFrom turn 44 at (5,2), on turn 45 move R to (6,2), then on turn 46 move L to (5,2) but (5,2) body, or from (6,2) to (5,2) is left, but (5,2) is body at that time.\n\nPositions: turn 44 move D to (5,2), positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nTurn 45 move R to (6,2), no eat, positions: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]  // tail (1,6) gone\n\nHead at (6,2), direction R? Move from (5,2) to (6,2) is right, so direction R.\n\nThen turn 46: from (6,2), possible moves: L to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, occupied, and moving left is opposite to current direction R? Current direction R, moving left opposite, not allowed.\n\nU to (6,3) body, occupied.\n\nD to (6,1) obstacle.\n\nOnly possible move is L to (5,2) but occupied or not allowed, contradiction.\n\nFrom (6,2), after turn 45, positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n\nNeighbors: (6,3) up: occupied by body? (6,3) is not in the list; positions are (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), ... so (6,3) is not occupied, but is it free?\n\n(6,3) had food, but we didn't eat it, so after we moved away, it might still be there or not, but in this scenario, we didn't go to (6,3), so (6,3) has food with life span decreasing.\n\nBut the cell (6,3) is not occupied by snake, so it's free.\n\nFrom (6,2), moving U to (6,3) is possible, if no collision.\n\n(6,3) is not in the snake positions above, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is body, occupied.\n\n(6,1) obstacle.\n\n(7,2) wall.\n\nSo from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3), or L to (5,2) but (5,2) occupied, or D to (6,1) invalid.\n\nAlso, current direction R, so moving L to (5,2) is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n\nMoving U to (6,3) is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nSo I can move U to (6,3) on turn 46, eating the food there if I want.\n\nBut for (1,3), I can't reach it.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up on turn 44, I can't reach (1,3) by turn 46.\n\nThe shortest path to (1,3) from (5,3) is 4 moves: for example, left to (4,3) but not allowed, or down to (5,2), left to (4,2), left to (3,2), left to (2,2), then to (2,3) or (1,3) but not directly.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (1,3) is not adjacent; (2,2) to (1,2) is left but (1,2) obstacle, to (1,3) is up-left, not adjacent, only up, down, left, right.\n\nSo from (2,2), I can go to (2,3) or (1,2) invalid or (2,1) or (3,2).\n\nThen from (2,3) to (1,3) left.\n\nBut to reach (1,3) from (5,3):\n\nOne path: down to (5,2), left to (4,2), left to (3,2), left to (2,2), up to (2,3), left to (1,3). That's 6 moves, so on turn 44 at (5,3), turn 45 at (5,2), turn 46 at (4,2), turn 47 at (3,2), turn 48 at (2,2), turn 49 at (2,3), turn 50 at (1,3) — but (1,3) disappears after turn 46, so too late.\n\nAnother path: up to (5,4), left to (4,4), down to (4,3) but occupied, or to (4,3) later.\n\nNot faster.\n\nSo it's impossible to reach (1,3) before it disappears, since minimum 4 moves but with obstacles and body, it takes more, and by turn 46 it's gone.\n\nTherefore, I should not worry about (1,3); it will be lost.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is gone after this turn.\n\nSo the only food I can eat is (6,3), and it has life span 9, so I can eat it now or later.\n\nBut if I eat it now, I grow, but then I'm in a tight spot.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I can move away, and eat it later when I have more space.\n\nFor example, on turn 44, move up to (5,4), then I can explore other areas, and come back for (6,3) later.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAlso, I need to think about survival.\n\nCurrent snake positions: head at (5,3), body at (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\nThe area around (1,5) and (1,6) is the tail, and there is food at (1,3), but we can't reach it.\n\nInternal obstacles at (1,2), (2,4), etc.\n\nThe grid has limited space.\n\nIf I move to (6,3) now, I eat and grow, but then I must go down to (6,2), then left to (5,2), then I can go down to (5,1) but obstacle, or left to (4,2), etc.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can go to (4,2), then to (3,2), etc., and the snake body will move, so space opens up.\n\nFor example, after a few turns, the tail moves away from the top-left corner.\n\nSo it might be ok.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,5), head at (5,3), not adjacent.\n\nAfter moves, if I go to (6,3), then (6,2), then (5,2), at (5,2), tail might be at (1,6) or something, not adjacent.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nPerhaps eating (6,3) now is fine, and I can survive.\n\nBut let's consider not eating it now.\n\nTurn 44, move U to (5,4).\n\nThen positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nFood at (6,3) still there with life span 8 after this turn.\n\nOn turn 45, from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nIf I move L to (4,4), then as before, I can only move U to (4,5) because other directions blocked.\n\nThen to (4,5), etc.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5) from (5,4).\n\nHead to (5,5), direction U.\n\nThen on turn 46, from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5).\n\nAll possible.\n\nThen I can go to (6,5), then down to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, or to (6,3) down.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (6,4) invalid, so to (6,3) directly? (6,5) to (6,4) not possible, so move down to (6,4) invalid, so only to (5,5) not, or to (7,5) invalid, so only U, L, R from (5,5), but U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5).\n\nFrom (5,5), move R to (6,5), head to (6,5), direction R.\n\nThen from (6,5), moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4) obstacle, L to (5,5) body, R to (7,5) invalid.\n\nSo only U to (6,6) or D not possible, L not allowed or occupied.\n\nMoving D to (6,4) invalid.\n\nL to (5,5) occupied and opposite? Current direction R, moving L opposite not allowed.\n\nSo only U to (6,6).\n\nThen to (6,6), which is top-right corner.\n\nThen from (6,6), only down to (6,5) body or left to (5,6), etc., but limited space.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left from (5,5), to (4,5), then to (3,5), but (3,5) body, etc.\n\nSo it might lead to dead ends.\n\nWhereas if I eat (6,3) now, I grow, and then I go down to (6,2), left to (5,2), then to (4,2), etc., and the bottom-left area has more space.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), I can go to (4,2), then to (3,2), then to (2,2), then to (2,3) if free, etc.\n\n(2,3) had food but it's gone.\n\nAlso, there might be new food spawning later, but the problem doesn't say; I think food is given, and no new food mentioned, so only these three, but (2,3) and (1,3) will be gone, only (6,3) remains for a while.\n\nBut life span 9, so it will be there.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat it eventually.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating one is good.\n\nBut I need to survive long-term.\n\nPerhaps the safest is to eat (6,3) now, then navigate out of the corner.\n\nLet's see the map.\n\nGrid: 6x6 playable, from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nWalls at borders and internal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\n(6,1) and (5,1) at bottom, (1,2) left, (2,4) middle, (6,4) right.\n\nSnake head at (5,3), body to (1,5) and (1,6).\n\nIf I move right to (6,3), eat, then down to (6,2), then left to (5,2), then from (5,2) I can move left to (4,2) or down to (5,1) invalid, or up to (5,3) body, or right to (6,2) body.\n\nOn turn 47 at (5,2), I can move left to (4,2).\n\nThen to (4,2), then I can move down to (4,1) or left to (3,2) or up to (4,3) but (4,3) may be body.\n\nAfter a few moves, the body moves.\n\nFor example, after turn 47 at (4,2), positions depend on previous.\n\nBut let's assume I go left.\n\nThen to (3,2), then to (2,2), then to (2,3), then to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle, so from (2,3), I can move to (1,3) but (1,3) may have food but gone, or to (3,3) or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,4) blocked, so from (2,3), I can go to (1,3) if free, but (1,3) food gone, or to (3,3) which may be free later.\n\nAs snake moves, cells are freed.\n\nFor example, initially (3,3) is body, but after moves, it may not be.\n\nIn the long run, I can survive.\n\nBut to think 5 turns ahead, for turn 44, I should choose a move.\n\nPerhaps moving right to eat the food is the best, since it's available and I can grow.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I might not get another chance soon, but it has long life.\n\nBut there is a risk that if I leave it, I might be forced away and not come back.\n\nBut with life span 9, I have time.\n\nHowever, in this position, moving up or down might lead to more open space.\n\nLet's see the current direction.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,3) is under the body? No, (2,3) is not occupied by snake; it's a separate cell with food.\n\nBut it's adjacent to body at (3,3).\n\nBut since I can't eat it this turn, it's irrelevant.\n\nI think for turn 44, moving right to (6,3) to eat the food is a good choice, as it increases score and length, which might be useful for survival.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can navigate.\n\nSo for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn 44, 45, 46, etc., but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the output should include actions for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many.\n\nLook: \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 turns.\n\nAlso, for the decision, I need to choose the first action.\n\nBut the output should show the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I need to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 44.\n\nBut since the state changes, I can only plan based on current state.\n\nI can simulate the next few turns.\n\nLet's decide to move right on turn 44.\n\nThen for turn 45, as we saw, from (6,3) only down to (6,2).\n\nThen turn 46 from (6,2) only left to (5,2).\n\nThen turn 47 from (5,2) only left to (4,2)? From (5,2), after moving left from (6,2) to (5,2), head at (5,2), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves: L to (4,2), R to (6,2) body or not allowed, U to (5,3) body, D to (5,1) obstacle.\n\nSo only L to (4,2).\n\nThen turn 48 from (4,2): moves L to (3,2), R to (5,2) body, U to (4,3), D to (4,1).\n\nR to (5,2) body, occupied.\n\nU to (4,3): (4,3) may be body or not.\n\nAt this point, let's list positions.\n\nTurn 44: move R to (6,3), eat food, positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]  // length 10\n\nTurn 45: move D to (6,2), no eat, positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]  // tail (1,5) gone, tail now (1,6)\n\nTurn 46: move L to (5,2), no eat, positions: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]  // tail (1,6) gone, tail (2,6)\n\nHead at (5,2), direction L.\n\nTurn 47: move L to (4,2), no eat, positions: [(4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]  // tail (2,6) gone, tail (2,5)\n\nHead at (4,2), direction L.\n\nTurn 48: from (4,2), possible moves:\n\nL to (3,2)\n\nR to (5,2) - occupied by body\n\nU to (4,3) - (4,3) is in positions, it's body, occupied\n\nD to (4,1) - if free\n\n(4,1) not wall or obstacle, so free.\n\nAlso, current direction L, so moving R to (5,2) opposite not allowed.\n\nU to (4,3) occupied.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (3,2) or D to (4,1)\n\nBoth possible.\n\nI can choose, say, L to (3,2) to go left.\n\nThen turn 49 to (2,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) is body, so to (3,2) then (2,2), etc.\n\nNow, the food at (6,3) is still there with life span decreasing, but I can go back later if possible.\n\nSince I ate it on turn 44, it's gone.\n\nOnly one food left was (6,3), which I ate.\n\n(1,3) and (2,3) are gone.\n\nSo no more food, but new food might spawn? The problem doesn't specify food spawning; only the given food is listed, so after they disappear, no food, but I need to survive as long as possible, but the score is from eating food.\n\nWith no food, I can just move around to survive, but score doesn't increase.\n\nBut in this case, I ate one food.\n\nIf I don't eat now, I might not eat any.\n\nFor example, if I move up on turn 44, to (5,4), then I might not reach any food.\n\n(6,3) is there, I can go to it later.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), move R to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nMove U to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then down to (6,4) invalid, so to (6,5) then to (6,6), then stuck.\n\nFrom (5,5), move L to (4,5), then down to (4,4), but (4,4) may be free.\n\nBut not towards (6,3).\n\nTo reach (6,3) from (5,4): directly right to (6,4) invalid, or down to (5,3) but body and opposite.\n\nNot possible immediately.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can only go left or up, not right or down.\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,3) directly from there.\n\nLater, if I go down to lower rows, I might approach from below.\n\nFor example, from (5,4) move L to (4,4), then U to (4,5), etc., but not efficient.\n\nEventually, I might reach (6,3) but it takes time, and I might risk collision.\n\nWhereas if I eat it now, I have the score.\n\nAlso, growing longer might make it harder to maneuver, but in this case, from 9 to 10, not big difference.\n\nI think eating now is better.\n\nSo for turn 44, move R to (6,3).\n\nThen turn 45, move D to (6,2).\n\nTurn 46, move L to (5,2).\n\nThen for turn 47, from (5,2) move L to (4,2).\n\nThen turn 48, from (4,2) I can move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nLet's say move L to (3,2) to avoid the bottom row where there are obstacles.\n\nThen turn 49 from (3,2) move L to (2,2) or U to (3,3) or D to (3,1).\n\n(3,3) may be body or not.\n\nAt turn 48, positions after move to (3,2): let's not simulate too far.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output a sequence.\n\nSince the state changes, I can output the actions for the next few turns based on the plan.\n\nBut for the box, I need to write the actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 44, action R.\n\nThen for turn 45, D, etc.\n\nBut I think for the response, I should provide the sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the output should be the actions.\n\nLet's see the format.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1+1: action on turn t1+1 ... }\"\n\nSo I need to provide a sequence of actions starting from t1.\n\nHow many? It doesn't specify, but since I need to think ahead, perhaps 5 actions.\n\nI can provide as many as I can plan.\n\nBut let's do for 5 turns: turn 44 to 48.\n\nFor turn 44: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 45: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 46: move L to (5,2)\n\nTurn 47: move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 48: from (4,2), I can move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1). I think L to (3,2) is better to stay away from walls.\n\nBut (4,1) is free, so both ok, but let's say L to (3,2).\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 44: R\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: L\n\nTurn 47: L\n\nTurn 48: L\n\nBut on turn 48, moving to (3,2), etc.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, and no other food, eating the one food is fine.\n\nIf I don't eat now, I might eat later, but with risk.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nPerhaps there is a better move.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 44, move down to (5,2).\n\nThen head to (5,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 45, move L to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n\nSay move L to (4,2).\n\nThen from (4,2), move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1) or U to (4,3) but body.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nThen I can go to (3,2), etc., and (6,3) is still there, so on turn 46 or later, I can go to (6,3) from below.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) move to (5,2) not, or to (4,3) not free.\n\nFrom (3,2) move to (3,3) if free later, but not directly.\n\nTo reach (6,3), from current, if I am at (4,2) on turn 45, then to (5,2) on turn 46, then to (6,2) on turn 47, then to (6,3) on turn 48.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (6,3) up.\n\nAnd (6,3) has food, life span after turn 44: 9-1=8? Turn 44: life 9, after turn 44 decreases to 8, so on turn 48, life span 5, still there.\n\nSo I can eat on turn 48.\n\nBut in the first scenario, I ate on turn 44, so I have the score earlier, and same growth.\n\nBut in this case, I eat later, but I might have more options.\n\nBut with the same score.\n\nHowever, in the first case, after eating on turn 44, I moved to (6,2), (5,2), etc., so I was in the bottom-right, while in this case, if I go to (5,2) first, I am in bottom-left or center.\n\nBut I think it's similar.\n\nBut to be safe, eating now might be better to avoid the risk of not reaching it later.\n\nSince the grid has obstacles, it might be harder later.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), to (6,2), then to (6,3), I can eat.\n\nBut if I move down on turn 44, to (5,2), then turn 45 to (6,2), then turn 46 to (6,3), eat.\n\nShorter path to the food.\n\nTurn 44 move D to (5,2), no eat.\n\nPositions: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nTurn 45 move R to (6,2), no eat, positions: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] // tail (1,6) gone\n\nHead at (6,2), direction R.\n\nTurn 46 move U to (6,3), eat food, positions: [(6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] // growth, tail (2,6) still, but length 10 now.\n\nThen I have eaten on turn 46, same as before but later.\n\nAnd I am at (6,3) with the same situation as if I ate on turn 44, but now I have to move from there.\n\nIn this case, I ate later, so I have the same score, but I used two moves to get there without growing.\n\nIn the first way, I grew immediately.\n\nSo better to eat early.\n\nTherefore, for turn 44, moving right to eat is better.\n\nSo I think R is the best action.\n\nThen for the sequence, I'll provide:\n\nTurn 44: R\n\nTurn 45: D (since from (6,3) only D possible)\n\nTurn 46: L (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 47: L (to (4,2))\n\nTurn 48: L (to (3,2))\n\nBut on turn 48, from (4,2), I could go D to (4,1), but L to (3,2) is fine.\n\nI think it's ok.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (6,3) on turn 44, as it provides an immediate reward (+1 score, +1 length) and has a long life span (9 turns). However, moving to (6,3) now requires careful planning for subsequent turns to avoid dead ends and collisions. After eating, the snake will be constrained in the bottom-right corner, so the path must navigate towards more open areas while considering the grid's obstacles and the snake's body positions.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Turn 44 Action**: Moving right (R) to (6,3) eats the food, increasing length to 10. This is optimal as (2,3) cannot be reached this turn and disappears after turn 44, while (1,3) is unreachable by turn 46 (its disappearance turn) and is ignored.\n- **Turn 45 Action**: From (6,3), only moving down (D) to (6,2) is possible, as up to (6,4) is an obstacle, right to (7,3) is a wall, and left is opposite to the current direction (not allowed).\n- **Turn 46 Action**: From (6,2), only moving left (L) to (5,2) is possible, as up to (6,3) is now body, down to (6,1) is an obstacle, and right is invalid.\n- **Turn 47 Action**: From (5,2), only moving left (L) to (4,2) is possible, as right to (6,2) is body/opposite, up to (5,3) is body, and down to (5,1) is an obstacle.\n- **Turn 48 Action**: From (4,2), moving left (L) to (3,2) is chosen to avoid the bottom row (which has obstacles like (5,1)) and head towards open space. Moving down to (4,1) is possible but riskier due to proximity to walls.\n- **5+ Turns Ahead**: After turn 48, the snake can continue left/down to explore the bottom-left area, where the tail has moved away, freeing space. The food at (6,3) is already eaten, and no other food remains, so the focus is on survival. Future actions (beyond turn 48) can include moving to (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), etc., as cells become free.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 44 to 48):\n- **Turn 44**: Move right (R) to eat food at (6,3), increasing score and length.\n- **Turn 45**: Move down (D) to (6,2) to avoid obstacles and walls.\n- **Turn 46**: Move left (L) to (5,2) to continue towards open space.\n- **Turn 47**: Move left (L) to (4,2) to avoid the bottom-right corner.\n- **Turn 48**: Move left (L) to (3,2) to progress to safer areas with more maneuverability.\n\nThis sequence ensures the food is eaten immediately, avoids all collisions and dead ends for the next 5 turns, and positions the snake for long-term survival by moving away from constrained areas.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 44: R (right)\nTurn 45: D (down)\nTurn 46: L (left)\nTurn 47: L (left)\nTurn 48: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 45, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls and obstacles, and there's food with values and life spans.\n\n**Grid Setup:**\n- Walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think? Let me confirm.\n\nBorder cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those are walls. Also, there are internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSo the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls. Additionally, specific cells are obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nPlayable cells are where the snake can be, so from (1,1) to (6,6), except for the obstacle cells.\n\n**Snake Positions:**\n- Head: (6,3)\n- Body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n- Tail: (1,5)\n\nThe snake has 10 segments. Positions are given in order: head first, then body, then tail.\n\n**Snake Head Direction:** Currently moving Right (R). Since it's at (6,3) and came from (5,3), which is left, but direction is given as R, meaning it's moving right to (6,3) from (5,3)? Let's see the positions:\n\n- Previous head was (5,3), now head is (6,3), so from (5,3) to (6,3) is moving right. So current direction is R.\n\n**Food:**\n- Only one food item: (1,3) with value 1 and life span 3. But in the input, it says \"(1, 3, 3, 1)\" which I think is (x,y, life_span, value), so (1,3) with life span 3, value +1 (since positive food).\n\nValue is 1, so positive food.\n\nLife span 3 means it disappears after 3 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 45, life span is 3; turn 46, it becomes 2; turn 47, it becomes 1; and on turn 48, it disappears or before? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 45, life_span=3; after turn 45, it decreases to 2; after turn 46, to 1; after turn 47, it disappears, so it's available until turn 47 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for a food with life_span N at turn t, it will disappear after t + N - 1 turns? Example:\n\n- At turn t, life_span N: it can be eaten on turn t, t+1, ..., up to turn t + N - 1? Since countdown decreases each turn including current.\n\nIf at turn 45, life_span=3, then:\n\n- Turn 45: life_span=3 (can be eaten)\n\n- After turn 45, countdown decreases to 2\n\n- Turn 46: life_span=2 (can be eaten)\n\n- After turn 46, decreases to 1\n\n- Turn 47: life_span=1 (can be eaten)\n\n- After turn 47, decreases to 0, and it disappears, so not available on turn 48.\n\nSo food at (1,3) is available on turns 45, 46, 47.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,3)\n\nPossible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n\nBut cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. So I cannot move left immediately.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, walls at borders: so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n\nList all wall cells:\n\n- Border walls: all (0,y) for y=0 to 7, all (7,y) for y=0 to 7, all (x,0) for x=0 to 7, all (x,7) for x=0 to 7. But since playable is inside, for movement, we care about cells we can move to.\n\nCells snake can be in: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo forbidden cells: all border walls + internal obstacles.\n\nBut for movement, when we move, we check if the target cell is wall or obstacle or body.\n\nBody positions: current snake occupies: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\nNow, for movement from head (6,3):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (6,4) but (6,4) is an internal obstacle? (6,4) is listed as an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\n- D: (6,2) – is this a valid cell? x=6, y=2, y=2 is between 1 and 6, x=6 is border? x=6 is not wall, walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6,y=2 should be playable unless obstacle.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) – (6,2) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\n(6,1) is obstacle, but (6,2) is not listed, so ok.\n\n- L: (5,3) – but (5,3) is currently occupied by the body. But we can move to the tail cell because the tail will move, but need to be careful.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to the tail is ok, as long as after moving, the head doesn't collide with the new position.\n\nBut (5,3) is not the tail; tail is (1,5). (5,3) is the second segment.\n\nLet's list snake positions:\n\nIndex 0: head (6,3)\n\nIndex 1: (5,3)\n\nIndex 2: (4,3)\n\nIndex 3: (3,3)\n\nIndex 4: (3,4)\n\nIndex 5: (3,5)\n\nIndex 6: (2,5)\n\nIndex 7: (2,6)\n\nIndex 8: (1,6)\n\nIndex 9: tail (1,5)\n\nSo (5,3) is the first body segment after head, not tail.\n\nIf I move left to (5,3), that is currently occupied, so it would be a body collision, because it's not the tail.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo only the tail cell is safe to move into, not other body segments.\n\n(5,3) is index 1, not tail, so moving to (5,3) would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, R: (7,3) – but x=7 is wall, so cannot move there.\n\nx=7 is border wall.\n\nD: (6,2) – as I thought, should be free.\n\nU: (6,4) – but (6,4) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,3): only D (down to (6,2)) or L (left to (5,3)) but L to (5,3) is body collision, so not possible.\n\nL is to (5,3), which is occupied, and not tail, so invalid.\n\nR is to (7,3), wall, invalid.\n\nU is to (6,4), obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,2).\n\nIs that right? Let me confirm.\n\nCurrent position (6,3)\n\n- Up: (6,4) – obstacle, invalid\n\n- Down: (6,2) – not wall, not obstacle, and currently empty? We need to check if it's occupied.\n\nCurrent snake positions: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\n(6,2) is not in this list, so empty. And not wall or obstacle, so should be valid.\n\nLeft: (5,3) – occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n\nRight: (7,3) – wall, invalid.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is down to (6,2).\n\nBut the snake has to move, so I must go down.\n\nBut let's think about the food. Food is at (1,3) with value +1.\n\nBut I'm at (6,3), food at (1,3), so far away.\n\nLife span 3, available turns 45,46,47.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, I have to move down to (6,2) on turn 45.\n\nThen on turn 46, head is at (6,2), direction was down, so current direction D.\n\nThen possible moves from (6,2):\n\n- U: (6,3) – but (6,3) is currently the body, but after moving to (6,2), the snake will have moved.\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nAfter turn 45 move: head moves to (6,2), tail moves? When snake moves, head goes to new position, and tail is removed only if no food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten at (6,2), I assume, as no food there, so after move, the tail segment is removed, and new head at (6,2), body segments shift.\n\nCurrent snake: positions list: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]\n\nAfter moving down to (6,2):\n\n- New head: (6,2)\n\n- Body: the previous head becomes part of body, so (6,3) is now first body segment, then (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) – and tail was (1,5), which is removed since no food eaten.\n\nSo new snake positions: head (6,2), then body (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) – tail is (1,6) now? Positions: index 0: (6,2), index 1: (6,3), index 2: (5,3), ..., up to index 9: (1,6), but the list should have same length since no growth.\n\nOriginal 10 segments, after move, tail removed, so 9 segments? No.\n\nSnake movement: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, and tail cell is vacated. So the snake length remains the same.\n\nPositions: the new positions are [new_head, old_head, old_body1, old_body2, ..., old_body8] since old tail is removed.\n\nLet's index:\n\nBefore move: positions [P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9] where P0=head, P9=tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell N:\n\n- New head: N\n\n- New body: P0, P1, P2, ..., P8\n\nSo new positions: [N, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8]\n\nP8 was the second last, P9 tail removed.\n\nIn this case, P0=(6,3), P1=(5,3), ..., P8=(1,6), P9=(1,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,2):\n\nNew head: (6,2)\n\nNew body: P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8 → (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nSo new tail is (1,6)\n\nAnd P9=(1,5) is removed, free cell.\n\nNow, on turn 46, head at (6,2), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (6,3) – but (6,3) is now the first body segment, occupied. Not tail, so collision if move there.\n\n- D: (6,1) – but (6,1) is an internal obstacle, so invalid.\n\n- L: (5,2) – what is this cell? x=5,y=2, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) – (5,2) not listed, so free. And not occupied? Current positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), etc. (5,2) is not in list, so empty.\n\n- R: (7,2) – wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (6,3) but occupied, not tail; D to (6,1) obstacle; L to (5,2) free; R wall.\n\nOnly possible is L to (5,2).\n\nU to (6,3) is occupied by body, and it's not the tail (tail is (1,6)), so collision, invalid.\n\nD obstacle, R wall, so only L to (5,2) is valid.\n\nSo on turn 46, must move left to (5,2).\n\nThen after that, head at (5,2), direction L.\n\nNow, turn 47.\n\nHead at (5,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (5,3) – but (5,3) is body? Current positions after turn 46 move.\n\nAfter turn 46: moved to (5,2), new head (5,2)\n\nPrevious head was (6,2), so new body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), tail (1,6)? Let's list:\n\nAfter turn 45: positions [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) ]\n\nAfter turn 46 move to (5,2): new head (5,2), new body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail is (2,6)? Positions: [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] and (1,6) removed? Original after turn 45: 10 positions.\n\nAfter move, new head (5,2), then the first 9 of previous: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — so 10 positions, tail is (2,6).\n\n(1,6) was tail and removed.\n\nNow on turn 47, head at (5,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (5,3) – (5,3) is in positions, it's the fourth segment? Positions: index 0: head (5,2), index 1: (6,2), index 2: (6,3), index 3: (5,3), ... so (5,3) is occupied, not tail.\n\n- D: (5,1) – but (5,1) is internal obstacle, invalid.\n\n- L: (4,2) – x=4,y=2, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles don't include (4,2), so free. Not occupied? Positions have (4,3), but (4,2) not listed, so empty.\n\n- R: (6,2) – but (6,2) is the first body segment, index 1, not tail. So occupied, collision.\n\nAlso, current direction L, so opposite is R, cannot move right immediately? Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R, so cannot move right to (6,2).\n\nBut even if I could, it's occupied.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,3) occupied, invalid; D obstacle; L to (4,2) free; R invalid due to reverse and occupied.\n\nSo only L to (4,2) is valid.\n\nMust move left to (4,2) on turn 47.\n\nNow, the food is at (1,3) with life span, available until turn 47.\n\nTurn 45: life_span=3, eaten or not.\n\nTurn 46: life_span=2 if not eaten on 45.\n\nTurn 47: life_span=1, available.\n\nAfter turn 47, if not eaten, disappears.\n\nBut currently on turn 45, I'm at (6,3), moving to (6,2), nowhere near (1,3).\n\nBy turn 47, I'm at (4,2) or something, still far from (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at x=1,y=3.\n\nAfter turn 47: head at (4,2) if I move as above.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go to (1,3)? But it's turn 47, last chance to eat that food.\n\nBut (4,2) to (1,3) is not adjacent; I need multiple moves.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), to (4,3) or (3,2) or (4,1) or (5,2), but (5,2) might be occupied.\n\nFirst, after turn 47 move to (4,2):\n\nPrevious positions after turn 46: [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ]\n\nAfter move to (4,2): new head (4,2), new body: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) — tail is (2,5)\n\nNow, on turn 47, if I could go to (1,3), but it's not adjacent.\n\nPossible moves from (4,2):\n\n- U: (4,3) – (4,3) is in body, position index 5? New positions: head (4,2), body: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), ... so (4,3) is index 5, occupied, not tail.\n\n- D: (4,1) – y=1, not wall? y=1 is between 1 and 6, x=4 not obstacle, free? Obstacles: (5,1) but not (4,1), so free.\n\n- L: (3,2) – x=3,y=2, free? Not occupied, not obstacle.\n\n- R: (5,2) – (5,2) is the first body segment, index 1, not tail, so occupied.\n\nAlso, current direction after move: I moved left to (4,2), so direction L.\n\nOpposite is R, cannot move right.\n\nSo possible: U to (4,3) occupied, invalid; D to (4,1) free; L to (3,2) free; R invalid.\n\nSo I can move down or left.\n\nBut to reach (1,3) on turn 47, I need to be adjacent on turn 47.\n\nBut on turn 47, I'm at (4,2), and (1,3) is at distance, not adjacent. |4-1|=3, |2-3|=1, so Manhattan distance 4, not reachable in one move.\n\nSo impossible to eat food at (1,3) on turn 47, since I'm at (4,2) or elsewhere, not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 46, I was at (5,2), not adjacent to (1,3).\n\nOn turn 45, at (6,3), not adjacent.\n\nSo the food at (1,3) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after turn 47 uneaten.\n\nNo food to eat for now.\n\nBut I need to think long-term. There might be more food later, but in the state, only one food is given, and no other food mentioned. So probably, for now, only this food, but it's impossible to get, so I should focus on survival and positioning for future food.\n\nThe state only shows current food; new food may spawn later, but I don't know when or where. So I have to assume that food might appear, and I need to stay alive and explore or something.\n\nBut the game might have food spawning, but it's not specified in the rules. The rules don't say how food spawns, only the mechanics.\n\nIn the state, only this food is given, so perhaps no other food for now.\n\nBut to maximize score, I need to eat positive food, but if no food, I just survive.\n\nIn this case, with the moves I have, I'm forced into a path.\n\nFrom above, on turn 45, only move is D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 46, only move L to (5,2)\n\nTurn 47, only move L to (4,2) or D to (4,1), but earlier I said L to (4,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nOn turn 47, from (5,2) direction L, I can move to (4,2) or to (5,1) but (5,1) obstacle, or U to (5,3) occupied, or R invalid.\n\nSo only L to (4,2) or D to (4,1)? From (5,2), moving down is (5,1), which is obstacle, invalid. Moving down from (5,2) is (5,1), y-1.\n\n(5,2) down to (5,1), which is obstacle, so invalid.\n\nLeft to (4,2) is valid.\n\nUp to (5,3) occupied, invalid.\n\nRight invalid.\n\nSo only left to (4,2).\n\nNo choice.\n\nThen on turn 48, head at (4,2), direction L.\n\nPositions: after turn 47 move: head (4,2), body (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) tail (2,5)\n\n(2,5) is tail.\n\nNow possible moves from (4,2):\n\n- U: (4,3) – (4,3) is in body, index 5, occupied, not tail.\n\n- D: (4,1) – free, as before.\n\n- L: (3,2) – free, not occupied.\n\n- R: (5,2) – (5,2) is index 1, first body segment, occupied, not tail.\n\nCurrent direction L, opposite R, cannot move right anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (3,2) or D to (4,1)\n\nNow, I have a choice.\n\nSimilarly, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid with obstacles.\n\nPlayable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nForbidden cells:\n\n- Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n\n- Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nAlso, snake occupies certain cells, but they move.\n\nTo avoid dead ends, I should go where there is space.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), if I move left to (3,2), or down to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is y=1, which is bottom row, but not wall, and not obstacle except (5,1) and (6,1), but (4,1) is free.\n\nBut y=1 is adjacent to wall y=0, but can move.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is free.\n\nNow, let's think about the tail and possible paths.\n\nThe tail is at (2,5), which will move when the snake moves.\n\nAlso, there is a food at (1,3), but it will disappear after turn 47, so on turn 48, it's gone.\n\nSo no food to worry about.\n\nI need to survive and be ready for new food.\n\nBut since no new food mentioned, I just keep moving.\n\nBut I should plan a path that avoids trapping myself.\n\nFor example, the snake body is mostly on the top and left, from (3,3) to (1,5), etc.\n\nLet's plot the positions:\n\nHead now at (4,2)\n\nBody: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo occupied: (4,2) head, (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6) but (1,6) was earlier, etc.\n\nList all free cells in 1-6 x 1-6 except obstacles and snake.\n\nObstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSnake occupies: (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (6,3)\n\n(4,2) to (6,3) etc.\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)? (1,5) was tail earlier but removed, so free now.\n\nAfter turn 47, positions include (2,5), so (1,5) is free? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 47: snake at (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo cells occupied: (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nFree cells: all other in 1-6 x 1-6 except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nAlso, (1,1) free, (1,3) free (food but gone soon), (1,4) free, (1,5) free? (1,5) not occupied, not obstacle, so free.\n\n(1,6) free? Not occupied, not obstacle.\n\n(2,1) free, (2,2) free, (2,3) free, (2,6) free? (2,6) was occupied earlier but removed.\n\n(3,1) free, (3,2) free? (3,2) not occupied, not obstacle.\n\n(3,6) free.\n\n(4,1) free, (4,4) free, (4,5) free, (4,6) free.\n\n(5,4) free, (5,5) free, (5,6) free.\n\n(6,5) free, (6,6) free.\n\nBut (6,4) obstacle, (6,1) obstacle.\n\nSo from (4,2), I can move to (4,1) or (3,2).\n\nIf I move down to (4,1), then head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: from (4,1)\n\n- U: (4,2) – which is the first body segment after move, occupied.\n\n- D: (4,0) – but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- L: (3,1) – free\n\n- R: (5,1) – obstacle, invalid.\n\nCurrent direction D, opposite U, cannot move up anyway.\n\nSo only possible move L to (3,1).\n\nThen to (3,1), and so on.\n\nBut (3,1) is bottom left, might be dead end.\n\nIf from (4,2) I move left to (3,2), then head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nThen from (3,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,3) – occupied, body segment\n\n- D: (3,1) – free\n\n- L: (2,2) – free? Not occupied, not obstacle\n\n- R: (4,2) – occupied, body\n\nCurrent direction L, opposite R, cannot move right.\n\nSo can move down to (3,1) or left to (2,2).\n\nNow, (2,2) is near the left side.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (2,4), etc.\n\nTo avoid trapping, moving to (3,2) might be better, as it has more options.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go to (2,2) or (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is corner, only can go to (3,2) or (2,1) or (4,1), but (4,1) might be occupied later.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's simulate both paths.\n\nFirst, suppose on turn 48, from (4,2) I move down to (4,1).\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 48: move D to (4,1)\n\nNew head (4,1), new body: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), tail (2,5)? Positions: after move, new head (4,1), new body: previous head and body except tail removed.\n\nPrevious: head (4,2), body (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (4,1): new head (4,1), new body: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) — tail (3,5)\n\n(2,5) removed.\n\nNow direction D.\n\nTurn 49: from (4,1), only move L to (3,1) as above.\n\nMove to (3,1): new head (3,1), new body: (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) — tail (3,4)\n\nDirection L (since moved left from (4,1) to (3,1)? From (4,1) to (3,1) is left, so direction L.\n\nTurn 50: from (3,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,2) – (3,2) is now body? Positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) so (3,2) not occupied, free.\n\n- D: (3,0) wall, invalid\n\n- L: (2,1) – free\n\n- R: (4,1) – occupied, body segment\n\nCurrent direction L, opposite R, cannot move right.\n\nSo can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n\nIf move U to (3,2), then ok.\n\nIf move L to (2,1), then head at (2,1), etc.\n\nBut (2,1) is corner.\n\nNow, alternative: on turn 48, from (4,2) move left to (3,2).\n\nTurn 48: move L to (3,2)\n\nNew head (3,2), new body: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), tail (2,5)? Previous tail (2,5) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), body (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) — tail (3,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 49: from (3,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,3) – occupied, body segment\n\n- D: (3,1) – free\n\n- L: (2,2) – free\n\n- R: (4,2) – occupied, body\n\nCannot move right or up effectively.\n\nSo can move down to (3,1) or left to (2,2).\n\nIf move to (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction L.\n\nThen from (2,2), can move to (2,3), (1,2), but (1,2) obstacle, or (2,1), or (3,2) occupied.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nPossible moves from (2,2):\n\n- U: (2,3) – free? Not occupied, not obstacle\n\n- D: (2,1) – free\n\n- L: (1,2) – obstacle, invalid\n\n- R: (3,2) – occupied, body\n\nCurrent direction L, opposite R, cannot move right.\n\nSo can move U to (2,3) or D to (2,1).\n\nNow, (2,3) is near the body, but free.\n\nAlso, there is obstacle at (2,4), so (2,3) to (2,4) is blocked.\n\nBut can go to (1,3) or something.\n\nBut food at (1,3) is gone by turn 48.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the state is at turn 45, and I need to output for turn 45, 46, etc., but I don't know how many turns to output.\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many. Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nAlso, for the immediate move, on turn 45, I must go down to (6,2), as no choice.\n\nThen turn 46, to (5,2)\n\nTurn 47, to (4,2)\n\nThen on turn 48, I have a choice: to (4,1) or to (3,2)\n\nI think moving to (3,2) is better because it has more space.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (2,2) or (3,1), then to (2,3) or (2,1), etc.\n\nWhereas from (4,1), I go to (3,1), which is more constrained.\n\nSo for long-term survival, I should choose the path with more freedom.\n\nAlso, the tail is moving, so some cells will free up.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (2,5), and when snake moves, tail moves, so (2,5) will be free after some moves.\n\nIn the current path, after turn 47, tail is at (2,5), but on turn 48, if I move from (4,2) to (3,2), new tail is (3,4), so (2,5) freed.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\nBut to be safe, I should avoid going into corners.\n\nSo for turn 48, from (4,2), move left to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 49, from (3,2), I can move to (2,2) or to (3,1).\n\n(2,2) might be better, as it's closer to center or has options.\n\n(2,2) can go to (2,3) or (2,1) or (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, so to (2,3) or (2,1).\n\n(2,3) is free, and from there to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so cannot, to (1,3) or (3,3) but (3,3) might be occupied.\n\nLet's plan the moves.\n\nSince on turn 45,46,47 I have no choice, only one move each.\n\nTurn 45: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 46: move L to (5,2)\n\nTurn 47: move L to (4,2)\n\nNow turn 48: I can move to (3,2) or (4,1)\n\nI choose (3,2) for better options.\n\nSo move L to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 49: from (3,2), direction L, can move to (2,2) or (3,1)\n\nI choose to move to (2,2) to go left.\n\nMove L to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 50: from (2,2), direction L, can move to (2,3) or (2,1)\n\nSay move U to (2,3) to go up.\n\nThen from (2,3), can go to (2,4) but obstacle, or (1,3) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) might be body.\n\nI need to simulate the positions.\n\nFirst, after turn 47: positions at start of turn 48: head (4,2), body (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nTurn 48: move L to (3,2) — new head (3,2), new body: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) — tail (3,5)  (since (2,5) removed)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 49: move L to (2,2) — new head (2,2), new body: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) — tail (3,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 50: from (2,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (2,3): free, not occupied\n\nD to (2,1): free\n\nL to (1,2): obstacle, invalid\n\nR to (3,2): occupied, body, and cannot due to reverse.\n\nSo can move U or D.\n\nSay I move U to (2,3)\n\nNew head (2,3), new body: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) — tail (3,3)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 51: from (2,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (2,4): but (2,4) is obstacle, invalid\n\nD to (2,2): occupied, body\n\nL to (1,3): free? Not occupied, not obstacle\n\nR to (3,3): occupied, body\n\nCurrent direction U, opposite D, cannot move down.\n\nSo only possible move L to (1,3)\n\nMove to (1,3)\n\nThen head at (1,3), and so on.\n\nBut (1,3) is left top, might be ok.\n\nIf on turn 50 I moved down to (2,1), then to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut I think it's survivable.\n\nFor the output, I need to specify actions for turn 45 to, say, turn 50 or so.\n\nSince the food is gone, and no immediate danger, I can output the forced moves and then choices.\n\nBut for turn 48, I have a choice, but I think moving to (3,2) is fine.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to box the actions.\n\nFirst, turn 45: must move D\n\nTurn 46: must move L\n\nTurn 47: must move L\n\nTurn 48: I choose to move L to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 49: from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2) or D to (3,1)\n\nI choose L to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 50: from (2,2), move U to (2,3)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut to be precise, let's list the actions.\n\nSince the state is at turn 45, and I need to output for turn 45, 46, 47, etc.\n\nBut how many? I think at least 5 turns: 45 to 50.\n\nSo for turn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: L\n\nTurn 47: L\n\nTurn 48: L (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 49: L (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 50: U (to (2,3))\n\nOn turn 49, from (3,2) to (2,2) is left, so L.\n\nOn turn 50, from (2,2) to (2,3) is up, so U.\n\nI think that's reasonable.\n\nBut is there a risk? For example, when I move to (2,3), then to (1,3), which is safe.\n\nAlso, tail is moving, so space opens up.\n\nBut I need to consider if there is food under body or something, but no food mentioned except (1,3) which is gone.\n\nThe rule about food under body: but no such food here.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but not applicable.\n\nSo for now, survival is key.\n\nPerhaps I should output the actions.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 45 Decision\n\n**Current State Overview:**\n- **Grid Size and Walls**: The grid is 8x8 (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7)). Border walls exist at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Playable area is cells (x,y) with x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6, excluding obstacles.\n- **Snake Position and Direction**: \n  - Head at (6,3), moving right (R).\n  - Body segments: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] (10 segments total).\n- **Food**: Only one food at (1,3) with value +1 and life span 3. It is available on turns 45, 46, and 47 (disappears after turn 47).\n- **Constraints**: \n  - Cannot move opposite to current direction (L is opposite of R, so L is invalid).\n  - Must avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions (except the tail cell after it moves).\n\n**Immediate Move (Turn 45):**\n- Possible moves from head (6,3):\n  - U (up) to (6,4): Blocked by internal obstacle (6,4).\n  - D (down) to (6,2): Valid (empty, not wall/obstacle).\n  - L (left) to (5,3): Invalid (occupied by body segment, not tail).\n  - R (right) to (7,3): Invalid (wall at x=7).\n- **Only valid move is D (down) to (6,2)**.\n- After moving, no food is eaten (cell empty), so snake length remains 10. New head position: (6,2), direction D.\n\n**Turn 46:**\n- Head at (6,2), direction D.\n- Possible moves:\n  - U to (6,3): Invalid (occupied by new first body segment after move).\n  - D to (6,1): Invalid (internal obstacle).\n  - L to (5,2): Valid (empty, not wall/obstacle).\n  - R to (7,2): Invalid (wall).\n- **Only valid move is L (left) to (5,2)**.\n- No food eaten. New head: (5,2), direction L.\n\n**Turn 47:**\n- Head at (5,2), direction L.\n- Possible moves:\n  - U to (5,3): Invalid (occupied by body).\n  - D to (5,1): Invalid (internal obstacle).\n  - L to (4,2): Valid (empty, not wall/obstacle).\n  - R to (6,2): Invalid (occupied by body and reverse move disallowed).\n- **Only valid move is L (left) to (4,2)**.\n- Food at (1,3) is still available (life span 1 on turn 47), but (4,2) is not adjacent to (1,3). Eating is impossible this turn. New head: (4,2), direction L.\n\n**Turn 48 and Beyond (Planning 5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Turn 48 Start**: Head at (4,2), direction L. Food at (1,3) has disappeared (life span ended).\n- Available moves:\n  - U to (4,3): Invalid (occupied by body segment).\n  - D to (4,1): Valid (empty, not wall/obstacle).\n  - L to (3,2): Valid (empty, not wall/obstacle).\n  - R to (5,2): Invalid (occupied by body and reverse move disallowed).\n- **Choice**: Both L and D are valid, but long-term survival is prioritized:\n  - Move D to (4,1): Leads to bottom area with fewer options (e.g., only left to (3,1) next), increasing risk of dead ends.\n  - Move L to (3,2): Opens more paths (e.g., can later move left, up, or down) and avoids tight spaces. **L is chosen for better maneuverability**.\n- After move: New head (3,2), direction L.\n\n- **Turn 49**: Head at (3,2), direction L.\n  - Moves:\n    - U to (3,3): Invalid (occupied).\n    - D to (3,1): Valid.\n    - L to (2,2): Valid.\n    - R to (4,2): Invalid (occupied and reverse disallowed).\n  - **L to (2,2) is chosen** to continue toward open areas (left side has fewer body segments). New head: (2,2), direction L.\n\n- **Turn 50**: Head at (2,2), direction L.\n  - Moves:\n    - U to (2,3): Valid (empty).\n    - D to (2,1): Valid (empty).\n    - L to (1,2): Invalid (obstacle).\n    - R to (3,2): Invalid (occupied and reverse disallowed).\n  - **U to (2,3) is chosen** to avoid bottom corner and access upper rows. New head: (2,3), direction U.\n\n**Why This Path?**\n- **Survival Focus**: The chosen path avoids known risks (obstacles, body collisions) and steers toward areas with more free cells (e.g., left side near (1,3)-(1,6) has space as body moves).\n- **Food Consideration**: The food at (1,3) was unreachable by turn 47 due to distance, so it was ignored. New food may spawn, and the snake is positioned to explore safely.\n- **5+ Turn Outlook**: By turn 50, the snake is at (2,3) with options to move to (1,3) (if food respawns), (2,4) (obstacle blocked, so avoid), (3,3) (may be free later), or (1,3). Tail movement frees cells like (3,5), allowing loops if needed.\n\n**Final Action Sequence (Turns 45-50):**\n- Turn 45: D (forced move, only safe option).\n- Turn 46: L (forced move).\n- Turn 47: L (forced move).\n- Turn 48: L (chosen for long-term pathing).\n- Turn 49: L (continues safe leftward exploration).\n- Turn 50: U (avoids dead end and accesses open space).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: D \\\\\nTurn 46: L \\\\\nTurn 47: L \\\\\nTurn 48: L \\\\\nTurn 49: L \\\\\nTurn 50: U\n}",

        "score": 9,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 46, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and all border cells are walls. Also, internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked and I can't move into them.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (6,2), then body segments: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6). So the snake has 10 segments. Head is at (6,2), and the direction is down, which is D. Since direction is D, moving down decreases y, so from (6,2) moving down would go to (6,1), but (6,1) is an obstacle, so I can't move down directly. I need to check possible moves.\n\nHead direction is D, so current direction is down. But moving down to (6,1) is blocked by an obstacle. Also, I can't move opposite to current direction instantly. Since direction is D, opposite is U (up). So I can't move up on this turn because that would be instant reverse.\n\nThe rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" But this is the current turn, turn 46, and I'm deciding the action for turn 46. The head direction is given as D, meaning it was moving down to reach (6,2) on turn 46. So for turn 46, I need to choose a new direction, but I can't choose the opposite of D, which is U.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, so for the next move, I can't move U because that would be opposite to current direction.\n\nPossible moves from (6,2):\n\n- U: up to (6,3)\n\n- D: down to (6,1) — but (6,1) is an obstacle, so invalid\n\n- L: left to (5,2)\n\n- R: right to (7,2) — but x=7 is border wall, so (7,2) is wall, invalid\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So (7,2) has x=7, so wall, can't move there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) has y=1, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not wall, but (6,1) is specifically an internal obstacle, so blocked.\n\nNow, moving up to (6,3): (6,3) is a body segment. Is that a collision?\n\nThe snake positions are: head (6,2), then (6,3) is the next segment, which is the body. If I move up to (6,3), that's directly into the body. But according to the rules, body collision is deadly unless it's the tail and I'm moving into it when the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving into a body segment is generally deadly, except if it's the tail segment and the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, (6,3) is not the tail; it's the second segment. Tail is at (1,6). So (6,3) is part of the body, so moving to (6,3) would cause collision and death.\n\nTherefore, moving U to (6,3) is invalid because it's occupied by body.\n\nSimilarly, moving D to (6,1) is blocked by obstacle.\n\nMoving R to (7,2) is wall.\n\nSo the only possible move is L to (5,2)? (5,2) is not listed in snake positions or obstacles? Snake positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc. (5,2) is not in the list. Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,2) is not an obstacle. Walls are only borders, so (5,2) should be free.\n\nx=5, y=2: borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (5,2) is within bounds, no wall, not obstacle, not occupied by snake body except head, but head is moving away.\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,2), if I move to (5,2), that should be fine, as long as (5,2) is empty.\n\nCurrent snake positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)] so (5,2) is not occupied, and not obstacle, so it should be free.\n\nBut I need to check if moving there causes issues.\n\nAlso, I have to consider the direction for no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, so I cannot move U (opposite).\n\nMoving L to (5,2) is left, which is not opposite to down, so should be ok.\n\nMoving R is invalid, D invalid, U invalid and also opposite? U is opposite to D, but U is also occupied.\n\nU is invalid because occupied and opposite, but since occupied, it's doubly invalid.\n\nBut L seems possible.\n\nIs there another option? What about down? Down is blocked. Right blocked. Up blocked and opposite. Only left is free.\n\nBut let me confirm the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. All borders walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,2) is x=5,y=2, not in obstacles, not border, not snake, so free.\n\nSnake body: positions listed, (5,2) not there.\n\nSo yes, only possible move from (6,2) is L to (5,2).\n\nBut head direction is D, and moving L is perpendicular, not opposite, so ok.\n\nNow, for turn 46, I must move to (5,2), no choice.\n\nBut I need to think about food and future moves.\n\nFirst, list the food:\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,3) with life_span 2, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,5) with life_span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1.\n\nLife_span: for (1,3) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current? Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (1,3) with life_span 2 on turn 46: on turn 46, life_span 2; after turn 46, it becomes 1; after turn 47, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 46 or 47, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) life_span 10, so it lasts until turn 46+10-1=55? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn t: life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning on turn t + L, it's gone.\n\nRule: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, life_span = L, then after turn t (i.e., after current turn), it decreases to L-1 for next turn.\n\nSo if not eaten, on turn t+1, life_span is L-1, and so on, until life_span=0, it disappears.\n\nFor (1,3): life_span=2 on turn 46. So:\n\n- On turn 46: available, life_span=2\n\n- On turn 47: if not eaten, life_span=1, still available\n\n- On turn 48: life_span=0, disappears, not available\n\nSimilarly, (5,5): life_span=10 on turn 46, so available until turn 46+9=55? On turn 46, L=10; turn 47, L=9; ... turn 55, L=1; turn 56, L=0, disappears. So available from turn 46 to 55 inclusive.\n\nTurn t with L: it can be eaten on any turn from t to t+L-1, since on turn t+L, it disappears before eating.\n\nFor example, turn t, L=2: can be eaten on turn t or t+1.\n\nOn turn t+2, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nNow, back to the move.\n\nFor turn 46, I must move L to (5,2), since it's the only possible move.\n\nThen, snake will move: head to (5,2), and tail will move away from (1,6), so the body shifts.\n\nAfter moving to (5,2), the new snake positions: head (5,2), then the previous head (6,2) becomes body, so body: (5,2) head, then (6,2), then (6,3), but (6,3) was the second segment, now it's third, and so on, up to tail (1,6).\n\nOriginal positions: indices: 0: (6,2) head, 1: (6,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,6), 9: (1,6) tail.\n\nAfter move L to (5,2): new head at (5,2). Then the body segments: the tail (1,6) is removed, and the head moves, so the new body is from the previous positions except the tail is cut off? No.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, the tail moves away, so the last segment is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head at new position (5,2), then the previous head (6,2) becomes segment 1, then (6,3) becomes segment 2, (5,3) segment 3, (4,3) segment 4, (3,3) segment 5, (3,4) segment 6, (3,5) segment 7, (2,5) segment 8, (2,6) segment 9. The tail was (1,6), which is removed, so now the snake has 9 segments? Original 10 segments, move without eating, length same, so after move, 10 segments? Let's see.\n\nStandard snake: when you move to a new cell without food, the head moves to the new cell, and the tail end is removed. So the new snake has the same number of segments, but shifted.\n\nPositions: new head at (5,2), then the first body segment is the old head (6,2), then old segment 1 (6,3), then old segment 2 (5,3), then old segment 3 (4,3), then old segment 4 (3,3), then old segment 5 (3,4), then old segment 6 (3,5), then old segment 7 (2,5), then old segment 8 (2,6), and the old tail (1,6) is removed. But old segment 8 is (2,6), and tail was (1,6), so after move, the last segment is (2,6), which was previously segment 8, now it becomes the tail.\n\nLet's list indices clearly.\n\nOld snake: position index from head to tail: 0: (6,2), 1: (6,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,6), 9: (1,6)\n\nAfter moving to (5,2) without eating (since no food there), new head at (5,2). Then the body: the segment that was at index 0 becomes the new segment 1, so new position 1: old (6,2), new position 2: old (6,3), new position 3: old (5,3), new position 4: old (4,3), new position 5: old (3,3), new position 6: old (3,4), new position 7: old (3,5), new position 8: old (2,5), new position 9: old (2,6). The old tail (1,6) is removed, so no new position for it. Thus, new snake has segments: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). So 10 segments? Positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) tail.\n\n(2,6) is now tail, and (1,6) is gone.\n\nLength is still 10 since no food eaten.\n\nNow, head at (5,2), and direction: since I moved left, new head direction is L.\n\nNow, for turn 47, I need to choose next move.\n\nFirst, what are possible moves from (5,2)?\n\nCurrent head position (5,2), direction L.\n\nCannot move opposite, which is R (right).\n\nNow, adjacent cells:\n\n- U: up to (5,3)\n\n- D: down to (5,1)\n\n- L: left to (4,2)\n\n- R: right to (6,2) — but (6,2) is now a body segment (second segment), so moving there would collide.\n\n(6,2) is occupied by the body, so invalid.\n\nD: down to (5,1) — (5,1) is an internal obstacle, so invalid.\n\nU: up to (5,3) — (5,3) is a body segment? New positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), ... so (5,3) is the fourth segment? Positions: index 0: (5,2) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), so (5,3) is segment 3, body, so moving to (5,3) would collide.\n\nL: left to (4,2) — (4,2) is not occupied, not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,2) not in list. Not border. Not in snake positions: snake has (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), etc., (4,2) not there. So (4,2) should be free.\n\nBut let's list all occupied cells after move.\n\nNew snake: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nSo occupied: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nSo from (5,2):\n\n- U: (5,3) — occupied by snake body, invalid\n\n- D: (5,1) — obstacle, invalid\n\n- L: (4,2) — free? Not in occupied, not obstacle, not wall. x=4,y=2, within bounds.\n\n- R: (6,2) — occupied by snake body, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is L to (4,2).\n\nAgain, only one choice.\n\nMove L to (4,2).\n\nThen new head at (4,2), direction L.\n\nNow, for turn 48.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction L.\n\nCannot move R (opposite).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (4,3) — (4,3) is in snake positions? After previous move, let's update snake.\n\nAfter turn 47: moved to (4,2), without eating.\n\nNew positions: head (4,2), then old head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), and tail (2,6) removed? Old tail was (2,6), removed.\n\nOld positions after turn 46: head (5,2), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nAfter move to (4,2) without eating: new head (4,2), then body: old head (5,2), old segment 1 (6,2), old segment 2 (6,3), old segment 3 (5,3), old segment 4 (4,3), old segment 5 (3,3), old segment 6 (3,4), old segment 7 (3,5), old segment 8 (2,5). Old segment 9 (2,6) removed. So new snake: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) tail. 10 segments.\n\nNow from (4,2):\n\n- U: (4,3) — (4,3) is body segment? Positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), so (4,3) is segment 5, body, so occupied, invalid.\n\n- D: (4,1) — not occupied, not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,1) not in list. Not border, y=1>0. So free.\n\n- L: (3,2) — not occupied, not obstacle. Free.\n\n- R: (5,2) — occupied by snake body (second segment), invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nNow I have a choice.\n\nAlso, need to consider food.\n\nFood at (1,3) with life_span 2 on turn 46, so on turn 48, what is its status?\n\nTurn 46: L=2\n\nTurn 47: if not eaten, L=1\n\nTurn 48: L=0, disappears, not available.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) L=10, available until turn 55.\n\nOn turn 48, food (1,3) is gone.\n\nOnly food is (5,5).\n\nNow, snake head at (4,2).\n\nPossible moves: D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nIf I move D to (4,1): (4,1) is free? Yes, as above.\n\nThen head to (4,1), direction down.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: from (4,1), direction D.\n\nCannot move U (opposite).\n\nAdjacent: U to (4,2) — but (4,2) was previous head, now body, occupied.\n\nD to (4,0) — y=0, border wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) — free? Not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nR to (5,1) — (5,1) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only L to (3,1) possible? Let's see.\n\nIf head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nMoves:\n\n- U: opposite and occupied, invalid\n\n- D: (4,0) wall, invalid\n\n- L: (3,1) free\n\n- R: (5,1) obstacle, invalid\n\nSo only L to (3,1).\n\nThen from (3,1), etc., but I need to think about getting to food.\n\nFood at (5,5) is available.\n\nIf I move L from (4,2) to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is free, move there, direction L.\n\nThen from (3,2), possible moves.\n\nHead at (3,2), direction L.\n\nCannot move R (opposite).\n\nMoves:\n\n- U: (3,3) — (3,3) is body segment? After moving to (3,2), snake positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and (2,5) removed? Let's not get ahead; for turn 48 choice.\n\nFirst, back to turn 48 at (4,2).\n\nIf I move to (3,2), then positions: head (3,2), body (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), tail (2,5)? Old tail was (2,5), but after move, new tail is old segment 8 or something.\n\nAfter move to (3,2) without eating: new head (3,2), body: old head (4,2), old segment 1 (5,2), old segment 2 (6,2), old segment 3 (6,3), old segment 4 (5,3), old segment 5 (4,3), old segment 6 (3,3), old segment 7 (3,4), old segment 8 (3,5). Old segment 9 (2,5) removed. So snake: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) tail.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n\n- U: (3,3) — (3,3) is body segment (eighth segment), occupied, invalid\n\n- D: (3,1) — free, not occupied, not obstacle\n\n- L: (2,2) — not occupied, not obstacle? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, (1,2) is obstacle, (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\n- R: (4,2) — occupied by body, invalid\n\nSo possible moves: D to (3,1) or L to (2,2).\n\nNow, (2,2) is close to (1,2) obstacle, but (2,2) itself free.\n\nI need to get to (5,5) for food.\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5.\n\nCurrent head at (4,2), y=2, so need to go up.\n\nIf I go down to (4,1), I get stuck, as only move left to (3,1), then from (3,1) I can go left or down, but down to (3,0) wall, left to (2,1) or something, but it might be dead end.\n\nLet's think about the area.\n\nGrid with obstacles:\n\nI should sketch a grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all borders.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions after turn 46 move to (5,2), but for simplicity, at turn 48, head at (4,2).\n\nBut let's list free cells or something.\n\nSince I need to go to (5,5), from (4,2), moving up is blocked because (4,3) is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,2), (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo I need to find a path to go up.\n\nCurrently, the snake body is blocking the upper rows.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), I can only go down or left.\n\nIf I go down to (4,1), then only left to (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go up to (3,2) but that might be occupied later, or left to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut (5,1) is obstacle, so from (4,1), only left to (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), moves:\n\n- U to (3,2) — if I came from (4,1), direction L or D? Let's see directions.\n\nAt (4,1), after moving D from (4,2), direction D.\n\nFrom (4,1), move L to (3,1), so direction L.\n\nThen at (3,1), direction L.\n\nCannot move R.\n\nMoves:\n\n- U: (3,2) — may be free or not, depending on time\n\n- D: (3,0) wall, invalid\n\n- L: (2,1) — free? Not occupied, not obstacle. (2,1) not obstacle, obstacles are (2,4), etc.\n\n- R: (4,1) occupied or not? After moving, it might be body.\n\nBut at the time of decision, when at (3,1), the cell (3,2) could be free if not occupied.\n\nBut in this path, it's messy.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I move left to (3,2).\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move down to (3,1) or left to (2,2).\n\nIf I move left to (2,2), then from (2,2), I can move up, down, left, but (2,3) might be free.\n\n(2,3) is not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nThen to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle, so I can't go to (2,4).\n\nFrom (2,2), moves:\n\n- U: (2,3) — free\n\n- D: (2,1) — free\n\n- L: (1,2) — (1,2) is obstacle, invalid\n\n- R: (3,2) occupied, invalid\n\nSo from (2,2), can go U to (2,3) or D to (2,1).\n\n(2,3) is at y=3, and food was at (1,3), but it's gone by turn 48.\n\nTo reach (5,5), I need to go to higher y.\n\nCurrently, the row y=3 is partially occupied by snake.\n\nFor example, at y=3, cells: (6,3) snake, (5,3) snake, (4,3) snake, (3,3) snake, (2,3) free, (1,3) was food but gone.\n\n(2,3) is free.\n\nThen (2,4) is obstacle, so from (2,3), I can go up to (2,4) but obstacle, or down to (2,2), or left to (1,3) but (1,3) is not occupied but it's x=1, not border, but no obstacle there now, food gone, so free, or right to (3,3) occupied.\n\n(1,3) is free since food gone and no obstacle.\n\nObstacles are (1,2), not (1,3).\n\n(1,2) is obstacle, (1,3) is free.\n\nBut x=1 is not border wall, only if y=0 or 7, but y=3 not.\n\nSo (1,3) free.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (1,3) or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to go to (5,5).\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (2,4), so I can't go up from (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, at (3,3) occupied, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to lower y and then right or something.\n\nBut (5,5) is at y=5, so I need to go up eventually.\n\nThe snake body is in the way.\n\nAnother idea: when the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells become free.\n\nFor example, currently, after turn 48, if I move to (3,2), the tail is at (3,5), so as the snake moves, the tail moves, freeing up cells.\n\nSpecifically, the tail is at (2,5) after turn 46, but after turn 47, tail at (2,5)? Let's track the tail.\n\nAfter turn 46: head (5,2), tail (2,6) but (2,6) removed, new tail (2,5)\n\nAfter turn 47: moved to (4,2), tail was (2,5), removed, new tail (3,5)? After turn 47 move, positions: head (4,2), body up to (3,5), tail (3,5)? Earlier: after turn 47, snake: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) was removed? In turn 47 move, from (5,2) to (4,2), without eating, so tail (2,5) removed, new tail is the previous segment 8, which was (3,5).\n\nIn the list: old positions before move: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (4,2): new head (4,2), body: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and (2,5) removed. So tail is (3,5).\n\nAt turn 48, if I move from (4,2) to (3,2), then new head (3,2), body: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and tail (3,5) removed? No, when moving to (3,2), the old tail (3,5) is removed, new tail is old segment 8, which was (3,4).\n\nOld positions before turn 48 move: head (4,2), body (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nAfter move to (3,2) without eating: new head (3,2), body: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5) removed. So new tail is (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, the cell (3,5) is now free.\n\nBut for moving, at turn 48, from (4,2), I can choose to go to (3,2) or (4,1).\n\nIf I go to (3,2), then from there, I can go to (2,2) or (3,1).\n\nIf I go to (2,2), then to (2,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,5), I need to go to x=5,y=5.\n\nFrom current (4,2), y=2, so need to increase y.\n\nBut directly up is blocked.\n\nSo I can go left or down to go around.\n\nBut down might lead to dead end.\n\nLet's consider the food at (5,5).\n\nIt has long life, so I can take time.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nAnother thing: there is a potential danger with the tail.\n\nAlso, the rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (3,5), and food at (5,5), not on tail.\n\nSo not immediate issue.\n\nFor turn 48, I have to choose between D and L from (4,2).\n\nI think going down to (4,1) is risky because it might trap me.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), I can only go left to (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go left to (2,1) or up to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nIf I go to (3,2) on turn 48, then (3,2) is head, so (3,2) occupied.\n\nThen from (3,1), up to (3,2) is occupied, so only left to (2,1) or down to (3,0) wall, so only left.\n\nThen to (2,1), then from (2,1), can go up to (2,2), down to (2,0) wall, left to (1,1), or right to (3,1) occupied.\n\n(1,1) is not obstacle, not border, so free.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) is free.\n\nThen to (1,1), then from there, only up to (1,2) but obstacle, or down to (1,0) wall, or right to (2,1) occupied, so stuck, death.\n\nFrom (2,1), if I go up to (2,2), then from (2,2) I can go to (2,3) or (2,1), etc.\n\nBut it's messy, and I might not be able to reach the food.\n\nWhereas if I go left to (3,2) on turn 48, then from (3,2) I can go to (2,2) or (3,1).\n\nIf I go to (2,2), then to (2,3), then to (1,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so to (1,3).\n\nThen from (1,3), I can go up to (1,4), down to (1,2) obstacle, left to (0,3) wall, right to (2,3).\n\nSo to (1,4), then (1,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) is far, and the snake body is in the way.\n\nSince the tail is moving, cells are freeing up.\n\nFor example, on turn 48, if I move to (3,2), tail was at (3,5), removed, so (3,5) free.\n\nThen on turn 49, from (3,2), I can move to (2,2) or (3,1).\n\nSay I move to (2,2).\n\nThen positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (4,2), etc., tail at (3,4) or something.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move to (2,3) or (2,1).\n\nMove to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), move to (1,3) or (2,4) obstacle, or (3,3) occupied, so to (1,3).\n\nThen from (1,3), move to (1,4) or (1,2) obstacle, so to (1,4).\n\nThen to (1,5), (1,6), but (1,6) was tail earlier, but now free.\n\nBut (1,6) is at corner.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can go to (1,6), then from (1,6), can go down to (1,7) but y=7 wall, or right to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) might be free.\n\nBut I need to go to (5,5).\n\nThis seems inefficient.\n\nFrom the beginning, at turn 46, I had to move to (5,2).\n\nThen turn 47 to (4,2).\n\nThen at turn 48, from (4,2), instead of moving down or left, I have no other choice, only D or L.\n\nBut L to (3,2) is better because it keeps me at y=2, while D to (4,1) lowers y, making it harder to go up.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move down to (3,1) or left to (2,2).\n\nIf I move down to (3,1), then I might get stuck as before.\n\nBut if I move left to (2,2), then to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,4), etc.\n\nBut from (2,3), I can go to (1,3) or, if available, but (3,3) is occupied.\n\nLater, when the snake moves, cells like (3,3) might become free.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (3,4) or something.\n\nLet's think about freeing the body.\n\nThe body is currently blocking the left and center.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards the right where there is space.\n\nAfter turn 47, head at (4,2), body to the right: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), etc.\n\n(6,2) is body, (6,3) body, but (6,4) is obstacle, so above is blocked.\n\nBelow, (5,1) obstacle, so only left and down, but down leads to trap.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 48, from (4,2), move down to (4,1), then to (3,1), then to (2,1), then to (1,1), but stuck.\n\nNot good.\n\nMove to (3,2), then from (3,2), move down to (3,1), then to (2,1), same thing.\n\nOr from (3,2), move left to (2,2), then to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,4), then to (1,5), then to (1,6).\n\nFrom (1,6), I can move down to (1,7) wall, or right to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is free now, since tail moved.\n\nOn turn 48, after moving to (3,2), tail is at (3,4), so (2,6) is free.\n\nFrom (1,6), move to (2,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), I can move up to (2,5) or right to (3,6), etc.\n\n(2,5) is occupied? After move to (2,6), let's see positions.\n\nBut this is taking time, and I'm far from (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5, I'm at x=1,y=6 or something.\n\nFrom (2,6), move to (2,5) but (2,5) may be occupied or not.\n\nIt's complicated.\n\nPerhaps I can go up from (2,3) if possible, but (2,4) obstacle, so no.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (5,5) has life span 10, so I have time, but I need to survive and find a path.\n\nBut the snake is long, 10 segments, and the grid has obstacles, so space is limited.\n\nLet's list all free cells to see possible paths.\n\nGrid cells:\n\nRows y=0 to 7, but y=0 and y=7 walls, so not accessible.\n\ny=1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to 6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nSo playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo free cells: all except these obstacles and snake positions.\n\nBut snake positions change.\n\nAt turn 46, after move to (5,2), snake positions: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nWalls: borders.\n\nSo free cells: for example, (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) is snake? (1,6) is tail, but after move, it's removed, so free.\n\nAt turn 46 after move, (1,6) is removed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) obstacle, (2,5) snake, (2,6) snake, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a path to (5,5).\n\nFrom head at (5,2), I need to go to (5,5), but (5,3) is snake, (5,4) is free? (5,4) not obstacle, not snake, so free.\n\nBut to reach (5,4), I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), but at turn 46, head at (5,2), but for turn 47, I moved to (4,2), but I had to.\n\nAt turn 46, I moved to (5,2), then turn 47 to (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go to (4,1) or (3,2).\n\nIf I go to (4,1), then to (3,1), then I can go to (3,2) or (2,1), but (3,2) might be free later.\n\nBut let's assume I go to (3,2) on turn 48.\n\nThen head at (3,2).\n\nThen I can go to (2,2) or (3,1).\n\nIf I go to (2,2), then to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,4), then to (1,5), then to (1,6), then to (2,6).\n\nFrom (2,6), I can go to (2,5) or (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is snake, so not free, but when I move, it might be free.\n\nOn turn 48, after moving to (3,2), tail is at (3,4), so (2,5) is free? After move, the old (2,5) was removed, so (2,5) free.\n\nPositions after turn 48 move to (3,2): head (3,2), body (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) tail.\n\nSo occupied: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nFree: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) obstacle, (2,5), (2,6), (1,1), (1,2) obstacle, (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) obstacle, (6,1) obstacle, (6,4) obstacle, etc.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move to (2,2) on turn 49.\n\nThen head (2,2), direction L (since moved left from (3,2)).\n\nThen move to (2,3) on turn 50.\n\nHead (2,3), direction U (up from (2,2)).\n\nThen move to (1,3) on turn 51.\n\nHead (1,3), direction L (left from (2,3)).\n\nThen move to (1,4) on turn 52.\n\nHead (1,4), direction U (up from (1,3)? From (1,3) to (1,4), so up, y+1.\n\nThen move to (1,5) on turn 53.\n\nHead (1,5), direction U.\n\nThen move to (1,6) on turn 54.\n\nHead (1,6), direction U.\n\nThen from (1,6), can move to (2,6) on turn 55.\n\nHead (2,6), direction R (right from (1,6)).\n\nThen from (2,6), can move to (2,5) or (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is free now, since tail moved.\n\nOn turn 55, snake positions depend on previous moves.\n\nBut roughly, I can go to (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nBut (5,5) is still there, life span until turn 55.\n\nOn turn 55, it can be eaten, life_span=10 from turn 46, so on turn 55, L=1, available.\n\nOn turn 56, L=0, gone.\n\nSo on turn 55, it is available.\n\nBut I'm at (2,6) on turn 55 if I follow this path.\n\nFrom (2,6), to reach (5,5), I need to go right and down or something.\n\nBut there are obstacles and snake body.\n\nFor example, from (2,6), move to (3,6), then to (4,6), then to (5,6), then down to (5,5).\n\n(5,6) is free? Not obstacle, not necessarily occupied.\n\nBut let's see if this path is possible.\n\nFirst, on turn 55, head at (2,6), move to (3,6).\n\nThen turn 56, to (4,6).\n\nTurn 57, to (5,6).\n\nTurn 58, to (5,5), but on turn 58, food may be gone if life span ends.\n\nFood at (5,5), on turn 46 L=10, so on turn 55 L=1, turn 56 L=0, gone. So on turn 58, it's gone, too late.\n\nOn turn 55, from (2,6), I can move directly to (3,6), but (3,6) is not (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at y=5, x=5.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can move to (2,5), then to (3,5), but (3,5) may be occupied.\n\nOn turn 55, depending on snake position.\n\nThis is too vague.\n\nPerhaps a shorter path.\n\nFrom the start, at turn 46, head at (6,2), move to (5,2).\n\nTurn 47, to (4,2).\n\nTurn 48, from (4,2), instead of going left, I go down to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 49, from (4,1) to (3,1) (only choice).\n\nThen turn 50, from (3,1) to (2,1).\n\nThen turn 51, from (2,1) to (1,1).\n\nThen stuck, because from (1,1), can only go to (1,2) but obstacle, or (2,1) occupied, or (1,0) wall. Death on turn 52.\n\nSo this path is deadly, must avoid.\n\nTherefore, from (4,2) on turn 48, I must move left to (3,2) to avoid death.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move to (2,2) or (3,1).\n\nIf I move to (3,1), then to (2,1), then to (1,1), stuck as above.\n\nSo I must move to (2,2) from (3,2).\n\nThen from (2,2), to (2,3), then to (1,3), etc., as before.\n\nBut to reach (5,5) faster, from (2,3), instead of going to (1,3), can I go to (3,3)?

Let's not.\n\nI think I'm stuck in a loop.\n\nPerhaps the only way is to go towards the food directly when possible.\n\nBut from the current position, it's not possible in few moves.\n\nAnother thought: the head is at (6,2) at turn 46, direction D, but I moved to (5,2), then to (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,2), if I could go up, but can't.\n\nUnless on a later turn.\n\nFor example, after turn 48, if I move to (3,2), then on turn 49, from (3,2), I can move to (3,1) or (2,2).\n\nIf I move to (3,1), then on turn 50, from (3,1), move to (3,2) but occupied, or to (2,1).\n\nMove to (2,1).\n\nThen on turn 51, from (2,1), move to (2,2) or (1,1).\n\nMove to (2,2).\n\nThen on turn 52, from (2,2), move to (2,3).\n\nThen on turn 53, from (2,3), move to (1,3) or (2,4) obstacle, so to (1,3).\n\nThen on turn 54, from (1,3), move to (1,4).\n\nThen on turn 55, from (1,4), move to (1,5).\n\nThen on turn 56, from (1,5), move to (1,6).\n\nThen on turn 57, from (1,6), move to (2,6).\n\nThen on turn 58, from (2,6), move to (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nMove to (3,6).\n\nTurn 59 to (4,6).\n\nTurn 60 to (5,6).\n\nTurn 61 to (5,5), but food gone long ago.\n\nSo I miss the food.\n\nTherefore, I need to abandon the food or find a better path.\n\nPerhaps there is a path through the bottom.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), move to (4,1) on turn 48, then to (3,1) on turn 49, then to (3,0) wall, invalid, so to (2,1) on turn 50, then to (2,2) on turn 51, same as above.\n\nNo.\n\nI think it's not possible to reach (5,5) within the life span with the current snake position and obstacles.\n\nLife span is 10 turns, from turn 46 to 55.\n\nFrom turn 46 head at (6,2), to (5,5), Manhattan distance |6-5| + |2-5| =1+3=4, but with obstacles and body, it takes more turns.\n\nMinimum turns to reach: for example, (6,2) to (6,3) but occupied, to (5,3) occupied, so must go around, at least 5-6 turns, but with the body, it might be more.\n\nBut in practice, with the path I have, it takes more than 10 turns to reach.\n\nFor example, from (6,2) to (5,2) turn 46, (4,2) turn 47, (3,2) turn 48, (2,2) turn 49, (2,3) turn 50, (2,4) obstacle, so (1,3) turn 51, then to (1,4) etc, not direct.\n\nDirectly, from (6,2), if I could go to (6,1) but obstacle, or (5,2), then to (5,1) obstacle, so no.\n\nFrom (5,2), to (5,3) occupied, so must go to (4,2), then to (4,3) occupied, so stuck.\n\nSo indeed, no direct path, and the detour takes many turns.\n\nTherefore, I might not be able to eat the food at (5,5), so I should focus on survival and avoid risks.\n\nFor turn 46, I have to move L to (5,2).\n\nFor turn 47, move L to (4,2).\n\nFor turn 48, move L to (3,2) to avoid the death trap of going down.\n\nThen for turn 49, from (3,2), move to (2,2) to continue left.\n\nTurn 50, to (2,3).\n\nTurn 51, to (1,3).\n\nTurn 52, to (1,4).\n\nAnd so on, as before.\n\nBut since I can't eat the food, I just keep moving safely.\n\nThe food at (5,5) will disappear on turn 56, but I can't reach it, so ignore.\n\nSo for the answer, I need to output the actions for turn 46 and a few ahead.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide actions for 5 turns or so.\n\nCurrent turn t1=46.\n\nSo for turn 46: action\n\nTurn 47: action\n\netc.\n\nFrom above, for turn 46: only possible move is L, so L.\n\nTurn 47: from (5,2), only possible move is L to (4,2), so L.\n\nTurn 48: from (4,2), possible moves D or L, but D leads to death, so I choose L to (3,2).\n\nTurn 49: from (3,2), possible moves D to (3,1) or L to (2,2). Both seem safe for now, but L to (2,2) is better to avoid the bottom area.\n\nTurn 50: from (2,2), move to (2,3) U.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide the actions.\n\nSince the food at (1,3) has short life, but on turn 46 and 47, I can't reach it, and on turn 48 it's gone, so not relevant.\n\nSo I'll go with the safe path.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 46: L (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 47: L ( to (4,2))\n\nTurn 48: L ( to (3,2))\n\nFor turn 49, from (3,2), I can move to (2,2) or (3,1).\n\nI think (2,2) is better.\n\nThen turn 50: from (2,2), move to (2,3) U.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nSince the head direction changes, I need to consider no instant reverse.\n\nFor turn 49, at (3,2), direction is L (since moved left from (4,2)).\n\nFrom (3,2), cannot move R.\n\nMoves: D to (3,1) or L to (2,2).\n\nI choose L to (2,2).\n\nSo action L.\n\nTurn 50: at (2,2), direction L (from (3,2) to (2,2), so left).\n\nFrom (2,2), cannot move R.\n\nMoves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nI choose U to (2,3) to go up.\n\nAction U.\n\nThen turn 51: at (2,3), direction U.\n\nCannot move D.\n\nMoves: U to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid; D to (2,2) occupied; L to (1,3); R to (3,3) may be occupied.\n\nAt that time, (3,3) might be free, but in the sequence, it could be occupied.\n\nBut I can move to (1,3).\n\nAction L.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I think providing up to turn 50 or 51 is sufficient.\n\nSince the question is to think ahead, but output the actions for the current turns.\n\nSo for the boxed answer, I'll put the actions for turn 46 to 50 or so.\n\nLet's write:\n\nTurn 46: L\n\nTurn 47: L\n\nTurn 48: L\n\nTurn 49: L ( to (2,2))\n\nTurn 50: U ( to (2,3))\n\nThat should be enough.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 46\\), the snake must prioritize survival and long-term score maximization by avoiding immediate risks and planning at least 5 turns ahead. After evaluating all possible moves, considering the grid constraints, obstacles, snake body positions, and food availability, the optimal actions are determined as follows:\n\n- **Turn 46**: The snake head is at (6,2) with direction D (down). Possible moves are:\n  - U (up) to (6,3): Occupied by the snake body (segment at (6,3)), leading to collision. Invalid.\n  - D (down) to (6,1): Blocked by an internal obstacle at (6,1). Invalid.\n  - L (left) to (5,2): Free (not occupied, not a wall, not an obstacle). Valid.\n  - R (right) to (7,2): Border wall (x=7). Invalid.\n  - Additionally, instant reverse from D is U, which is invalid due to collision, but U is already invalid. Only L is possible. **Action: L (left)**.\n\n- **Turn 47**: After moving L, the snake head is at (5,2) with direction L (left). Possible moves are:\n  - U (up) to (5,3): Occupied by the snake body (segment at (5,3)). Invalid.\n  - D (down) to (5,1): Blocked by an internal obstacle at (5,1). Invalid.\n  - L (left) to (4,2): Free (not occupied, not a wall, not an obstacle). Valid.\n  - R (right) to (6,2): Occupied by the snake body (segment at (6,2)). Invalid and instant reverse from L is R, which is invalid. Only L is possible. **Action: L (left)**.\n\n- **Turn 48**: After moving L, the snake head is at (4,2) with direction L (left). Possible moves are:\n  - U (up) to (4,3): Occupied by the snake body (segment at (4,3)). Invalid.\n  - D (down) to (4,1): Free (not occupied, not a wall, not an obstacle). Valid but risky—leads to a dead end (e.g., eventual collision at (1,1) by turn 51).\n  - L (left) to (3,2): Free (not occupied, not a wall, not an obstacle). Valid and safer for long-term survival.\n  - R (right) to (5,2): Occupied by the snake body (segment at (5,2)). Invalid and instant reverse from L is R, which is invalid.\n  - Moving D to (4,1) leads to inevitable death (as it forces a path to (1,1) with no escape), so L is chosen for survival. **Action: L (left)**.\n\n- **Turn 49**: After moving L, the snake head is at (3,2) with direction L (left). Possible moves are:\n  - U (up) to (3,3): Occupied by the snake body (segment at (3,3)). Invalid.\n  - D (down) to (3,1): Free (not occupied, not a wall, not an obstacle). Valid but less desirable—leads to a slower path and potential delays in reaching open areas.\n  - L (left) to (2,2): Free (not occupied, not a wall, not an obstacle). Valid and preferred to avoid the bottom row and maintain flexibility.\n  - R (right) to (4,2): Occupied by the snake body (segment at (4,2)). Invalid and instant reverse from L is R, which is invalid.\n  - L is chosen to continue toward open space and avoid the riskier bottom area. **Action: L (left)**.\n\n- **Turn 50**: After moving L, the snake head is at (2,2) with direction L (left). Possible moves are:\n  - U (up) to (2,3): Free (not occupied, not a wall, not an obstacle). Valid and preferred to gain vertical mobility.\n  - D (down) to (2,1): Free (not occupied, not a wall, not an obstacle). Valid but less optimal—stays in a confined area.\n  - L (left) to (1,2): Blocked by an internal obstacle at (1,2). Invalid.\n  - R (right) to (3,2): Occupied by the snake body (segment at (3,2)). Invalid and instant reverse from L is R, which is invalid.\n  - U is chosen to start moving upward, opening paths for future turns. **Action: U (up)**.\n\n### Reasoning for 5+ Turns Ahead:\n- **Food Considerations**: \n  - Food at (1,3) has a life span of 2 (available on turns 46 and 47 only), but it is unreachable safely within those turns due to the snake's position and body blocks. It disappears by turn 48.\n  - Food at (5,5) has a life span of 10 (available from turns 46 to 55), but reaching it requires at least 8-10 turns from turn 46 (e.g., via a path like (6,2) → (5,2) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (1,4) → ...). However, this path is too slow, and the food would disappear by turn 56. Attempting to reach it risks collisions or dead ends, so it is not prioritized.\n- **Survival Priority**: The chosen path (moving left and then up) avoids immediate dangers (e.g., the bottom row dead end) and leverages the tail movement to free space. By turn 50, the snake is at (2,3), with open areas to the left and up (e.g., (1,3), (1,4), (2,4) is blocked but alternatives exist). This allows for continued safe movement beyond 5 turns.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: No negative food is present, and the \"tail reward danger\" rule does not apply (food at (5,5) is not near the tail). Collisions are avoided by not moving into body segments or walls.\n\nThe actions for turns 46-50 ensure survival and set up for potential food access in later turns if new food spawns. Beyond turn 50, the snake can continue moving safely (e.g., to (1,3) or (2,4) if possible, but (2,4) is an obstacle).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 46\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50\\text{: U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 47, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those borders.\n\nInternal obstacles are at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked and can't be moved into.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,2), then body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (5,2) from previous position.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,3) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 47, if not eaten, it's gone.\n\n- (5,5) with value 1 and life span 9. So it has 9 turns left including this one.\n\nBoth foods are positive, value 1 each.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid: 8x8, walls at borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No:\n\n- x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are playable? Similarly y=1 to 6?\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7 for all y, and y=0, y=7 for all x. So cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for y=0 to 7 are walls, and (x,0), (x,7) for x=0 to 7. But x=0,y=0 etc. are corners, but all are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except for obstacles.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so min x is 1, max x is 6. Similarly min y=1, max y=6.\n\nBut obstacles are within, so cells to avoid.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\n- Walls: all (0,y) for y=0 to 7, (7,y) for y=0 to 7, (x,0) for x=0 to 7, (x,7) for x=0 to 7. But since playable area is interior, we care about (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, except obstacles.\n\nFor movement, we can't go to walls, so for positions, we only consider cells inside.\n\nSnake positions: all are within 1 to 6 in x and y? Let's check:\n\nHead (5,2): x=5,y=2, both between 1 and 6.\n\n(6,2): x=6,y=2\n\n(6,3): x=6,y=3\n\n(5,3): x=5,y=3\n\n(4,3): x=4,y=3\n\n(3,3): x=3,y=3\n\n(3,4): x=3,y=4\n\n(3,5): x=3,y=5\n\n(2,5): x=2,y=5\n\n(2,6): x=2,y=6? y=6 is wall? y=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall. y from 0 to 7, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 are playable. y=6 is playable.\n\n(2,6): x=2,y=6, which is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7.\n\nSimilarly, x=6 is playable? x=7 is wall, so x=6 is playable.\n\nBut internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(6,1): x=6,y=1\n\n(5,1): x=5,y=1\n\n(1,2): x=1,y=2\n\n(2,4): x=2,y=4\n\n(6,4): x=6,y=4\n\nNow snake body: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nHead: (5,2)\n\nBody: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nTail is (2,6)\n\nFood: (1,3) and (5,5)\n\n(1,3): x=1,y=3\n\n(5,5): x=5,y=5\n\nHead direction is L, so it came from right, moving left to (5,2). Since it was moving left, it cannot instantly reverse to right on the next move. So from (5,2), possible moves: up (U), down (D), left (L), but not right (R) because that would be reverse. Current direction is L, so cannot go R.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, L. R is not allowed.\n\nNow, I need to choose where to move on turn 47.\n\nFirst, consider immediate options.\n\nFrom (5,2), neighbors:\n\n- Up: (5,3) - but that's occupied by snake body? (5,3) is part of snake, let's see positions.\n\nSnake: (5,2) head, then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc. (5,3) is the fourth segment? List in order:\n\nPositions: index 0: head (5,2)\n\n1: (6,2)\n\n2: (6,3)\n\n3: (5,3)\n\n4: (4,3)\n\n5: (3,3)\n\n6: (3,4)\n\n7: (3,5)\n\n8: (2,5)\n\n9: (2,6) tail\n\nSo (5,3) is occupied by the body segment at index 3. If I move up to (5,3), that would be a collision because (5,3) is a body part and not the tail? But when the snake moves, the tail moves, so moving into the tail cell is allowed if the tail moves away.\n\nGeneral rule: moving into a cell that is currently occupied by the snake is only safe if it's the tail, and the tail will move, so it becomes free.\n\nBut in this case, if I move to (5,3), which is currently occupied, but it's not the tail; it's an inner body segment. So moving there would cause collision, as head touches body.\n\nThe tail is (2,6), which is not near.\n\nSo moving to (5,3) is not possible; it's occupied.\n\nSimilarly, left: (4,2) - is that free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nOccupied by snake: all positions: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nSo (4,2) is not in the list, so it might be free.\n\n(4,2): x=4,y=2\n\nDown: (5,1) - but (5,1) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,1) is listed, so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n\nRight: (6,2) - but (6,2) is occupied by snake body, index 1, not tail, so collision. Also, cannot reverse direction.\n\nBut right is not allowed anyway because of no instant reverse.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,2):\n\n- Up: (5,3) - occupied by body (segment at (5,3)), so collision, not possible.\n\n- Down: (5,1) - obstacle, wall, not possible.\n\n- Left: (4,2) - let's check if free.\n\n(4,2) is not in snake positions, not a wall? Walls: borders are walls, but (4,2) is within 1-6,1-6. Internal obstacles: (5,1), (1,2), (2,4), (6,1), (6,4). (4,2) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\n- Right: (6,2) - occupied by body, and also reverse not allowed, so not possible.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (4,2). Is that right?\n\nBut let's confirm: current direction is L, moving left to (4,2) is continuing left, which is fine.\n\nAre there other options? Up and down are blocked, right not allowed.\n\nBut (5,3) is occupied, but is it the tail? No, tail is (2,6), far away.\n\nUnless... no, (5,3) is not tail.\n\nPerhaps I can move to a cell that will be free, but when I move, the body moves with me.\n\nOn this turn, from (5,2), I choose a direction, move the head to new cell, then body follows.\n\nIf new head position is occupied by body except tail, it dies.\n\nHere, (4,2) seems free.\n\nBut let's list all possible cells around (5,2):\n\n- North: (5,3) - occupied by snake (index 3)\n\n- South: (5,1) - obstacle\n\n- West: (4,2) - not occupied, not obstacle\n\n- East: (6,2) - occupied by snake (index 1)\n\nSo only west (left) is possible. So I must move left to (4,2) on turn 47.\n\nBut is that the only choice? Seems so, based on the board.\n\nBut I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, food: (1,3) has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears.\n\n(1,3) is at x=1,y=3.\n\nBut I'm at (5,2), moving to (4,2), so I'm not eating it this turn.\n\nAfter moving to (4,2), the food (1,3) will disappear since life span 1, and turn 47 is current, so after this turn, it's gone.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current, so at the start of turn 47, life span is 1, if not eaten during turn 47, after turn 47, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) has life span 9.\n\nNow, after moving to (4,2), what is the new state?\n\nTurn 48: head at (4,2), and snake body: since head moved to (4,2), the body follows: new head is (4,2), then the previous head (5,2) becomes neck, but the body moves: the segment that was at (6,2) moves to (5,2), (6,3) moves to (6,2)? Let's think.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo new positions: head to new cell, then body segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on, tail moves to where the second last was.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAfter moving head to (4,2):\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 1: moves to previous head position (5,2)\n\n- Segment 2: moves to previous segment 1 position (6,2)\n\n- Segment 3: moves to previous segment 2 position (6,3)\n\n- Segment 4: moves to previous segment 3 position (5,3)\n\n- Segment 5: moves to previous segment 4 position (4,3)\n\n- Segment 6: moves to previous segment 5 position (3,3)\n\n- Segment 7: moves to previous segment 6 position (3,4)\n\n- Segment 8: moves to previous segment 7 position (3,5)\n\n- Segment 9: moves to previous segment 8 position (2,5)\n\n- And tail: the last segment was (2,6), which moves to where segment 8 was, but segment 8 was (2,5), so tail moves to (2,5)? Let's index properly.\n\nSnake positions before move: [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] with (5,2) head, (2,6) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (4,2):\n\n- New head: (4,2)\n\n- Then, the first body segment (previously at (6,2)) moves to (5,2)\n\n- Second body segment (previously at (6,3)) moves to (6,2)\n\n- Third body segment (previously at (5,3)) moves to (6,3)\n\n- Fourth body segment (previously at (4,3)) moves to (5,3)\n\n- Fifth body segment (previously at (3,3)) moves to (4,3)\n\n- Sixth body segment (previously at (3,4)) moves to (3,3)\n\n- Seventh body segment (previously at (3,5)) moves to (3,4)\n\n- Eighth body segment (previously at (2,5)) moves to (3,5)\n\n- Ninth body segment (previously at (2,6)) moves to (2,5)  -- since it was the tail, but now it moves to where the eighth was, (2,5)\n\nThe tail segment was at (2,6), and it moves to the position that was previously occupied by the segment before it, which is (2,5).\n\nSo new positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nList: after move:\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Body: (5,2)  // previous head\n\n- (6,2)  // previous segment 1\n\n- (6,3)  // previous segment 2\n\n- (5,3)  // previous segment 3\n\n- (4,3)  // previous segment 4\n\n- (3,3)  // previous segment 5\n\n- (3,4)  // previous segment 6\n\n- (3,5)  // previous segment 7\n\n- (2,5)  // previous segment 8 and tail? Positions: the body segments are: index 1: (5,2), index 2: (6,2), index 3: (6,3), index 4: (5,3), index 5: (4,3), index 6: (3,3), index 7: (3,4), index 8: (3,5), index 9: (2,5)\n\nAnd the tail is at (2,5), since it moved from (2,6) to (2,5).\n\nBefore: segments 0:head,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9:tail\n\nAfter: head to new, then seg1 to old head, seg2 to old seg1, ..., seg9 to old seg8.\n\nOld seg8 was (2,5), so new tail at (2,5).\n\nOld positions: seg8 was (2,5), seg9 tail at (2,6)\n\nAfter move: new head (4,2)\n\nNew seg1: old head (5,2)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (6,2)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (6,3)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (5,3)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (4,3)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (3,3)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (3,4)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (3,5)\n\nNew seg9 (tail): old seg8 (2,5)\n\nSo new snake: [(4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTail at (2,5)\n\nFood: (1,3) is gone, since not eaten on turn 47.\n\nOnly food left is (5,5) with life span 9, but after turn 47, life span decreases to 8 for turn 48.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, so at start of turn 48, (5,5) has life span 8.\n\nNow, head at (4,2), and head direction: since I moved left to (4,2), new direction is L.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U, D, L, but not R (reverse).\n\nNeighbors of (4,2):\n\n- North: (4,3) - occupied? New snake positions: (4,3) is part of body, it's new seg5? Positions: (4,2) head, (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), etc. So (4,3) is occupied by segment 5 (index 5, but in list index 5 is (4,3)? Let's see order: head (4,2), seg1 (5,2), seg2 (6,2), seg3 (6,3), seg4 (5,3), seg5 (4,3), so (4,3) is seg5, not tail. So moving to (4,3) would collide.\n\n- South: (4,1) - is this within bounds? y=1, x=4. y=1 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7. Internal obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not listed, so should be free? Check obstacles: internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (4,1) not listed, not wall, so free.\n\n- West: (3,2) - not occupied, not obstacle? (3,2) not in snake, not wall. Snake has (3,3), (3,4), etc., but (3,2) free? Check: snake positions: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) — no (3,2), so free. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,2) not listed, so free.\n\n- East: (5,2) - occupied by snake seg1, so collision, and also not allowed to reverse? Current direction is L, east would be right, which is opposite to left, so reverse not allowed. So cannot go east.\n\nSo possible moves: south to (4,1) or west to (3,2).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead to get to the food at (5,5).\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, I should avoid trapping myself.\n\nSince I must move on turn 47 to (4,2), I should plan from there.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 47.\n\nOn turn 47, I have no choice but to move left to (4,2).\n\nSo action for turn 47: L\n\nThen for turn 48, I have choices: S (down to (4,1)) or W (left to (3,2)).\n\nNow, let's consider the grid and food.\n\nFood at (5,5), which is above.\n\nAlso, the snake body is around (3,3) to (3,5) and (2,5), etc.\n\nI should aim to go towards (5,5), but need a path.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I go south to (4,1), that might be cornering myself.\n\n(4,1) is at bottom, y=1.\n\nThen from there, I can go west or east or north, but north would be back to (4,2), which is now body.\n\nSimilarly, if I go west to (3,2), I can then go north or south or west.\n\n(3,2) is at x=3,y=2.\n\nThen to (5,5), I need to go up and right.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nList all blocked cells for reference.\n\nPlayable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: borders, but since we can't go there, we consider cells.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo blocked cells: (5,1), (6,1), (1,2), (2,4), (6,4)\n\nAnd snake occupies various cells, but they move.\n\nFor pathing, we need to avoid current snake positions except tail.\n\nBut since snake moves, it's dynamic.\n\nFor turn 48, from (4,2), options:\n\nOption A: move down to (4,1)\n\nThen head at (4,1), new direction down.\n\nThen neighbors: (4,1) is at y=1, so south would be (4,0), which is wall, not possible.\n\nNorth: (4,2) - but after move, (4,2) is occupied by body? After moving head to (4,1), new snake positions:\n\nHead: (4,1)\n\nSeg1: old head (4,2)\n\nSeg2: old seg1 (5,2)\n\nSeg3: old seg2 (6,2)\n\nSeg4: old seg3 (6,3)\n\nSeg5: old seg4 (5,3)\n\nSeg6: old seg5 (4,3)\n\nSeg7: old seg6 (3,3)\n\nSeg8: old seg7 (3,4)\n\nSeg9: old seg8 (3,5)  // tail at (3,5)? Old positions: before turn 48 move, snake at [(4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nAfter moving head to (4,1):\n\n- Head: (4,1)\n\n- Seg1: (4,2)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (5,2)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (6,2)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (6,3)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: (5,3)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: (4,3)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: (3,3)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: (3,4)  // old seg7\n\n- Seg9: (3,5)  // old seg8\n\n- Tail: old seg9 (2,5) is not moved to? New tail: since old seg9 was (2,5), it moves to old seg8 position? Seg8 was (3,5)? Positions: old seg8 is (3,5), old seg9 is (2,5)\n\nAfter move, new seg1 to old head, new seg2 to old seg1, ..., new seg9 to old seg8.\n\nOld seg8 is (3,5), so new seg9 at (3,5)\n\nThe tail is new seg9, at (3,5)\n\nAnd old seg9 at (2,5) is gone, so (2,5) is now free.\n\nNew snake: head (4,1), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (5,2), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (3,3), seg8 (3,4), seg9 (3,5) tail.\n\nAt (4,1), neighbors:\n\n- North: (4,2) - occupied by seg1, not tail, collision.\n\n- South: (4,0) - wall, not possible.\n\n- West: (3,1) - not occupied? (3,1) not in snake, not obstacle. Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (3,1) not listed. Internal obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), etc., not (3,1), so free.\n\n- East: (5,1) - but (5,1) is internal obstacle, wall, not possible.\n\nSo from (4,1), can only move west to (3,1).\n\nThen from there, it might be limited.\n\nIf I go to (3,1), then I can go north or west, but not east back.\n\nBut y=1, so south not possible.\n\nThis seems like a dead end area.\n\nNow, the other option from (4,2) on turn 48: move west to (3,2)\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction west.\n\nNew snake positions after move to (3,2):\n\nHead: (3,2)\n\nSeg1: old head (4,2)\n\nSeg2: old seg1 (5,2)\n\nSeg3: old seg2 (6,2)\n\nSeg4: old seg3 (6,3)\n\nSeg5: old seg4 (5,3)\n\nSeg6: old seg5 (4,3)\n\nSeg7: old seg6 (3,3)\n\nSeg8: old seg7 (3,4)\n\nSeg9: old seg8 (3,5)  // tail at (3,5)? Old seg8 was (3,5)? Before move: positions [(4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nAfter head to (3,2):\n\n- Head: (3,2)\n\n- Seg1: (4,2)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (5,2)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (6,2)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (6,3)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: (5,3)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: (4,3)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: (3,3)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: (3,4)  // old seg7\n\n- Seg9: (3,5)  // old seg8\n\n- Tail: old seg9 (2,5) is moved to old seg8 position? New seg9 at old seg8 (3,5), so tail at (3,5)\n\n(2,5) is free now.\n\nAt (3,2), neighbors:\n\n- North: (3,3) - occupied by seg7, body, collision\n\n- South: (3,1) - free, as before\n\n- West: (2,2) - not occupied? (2,2) not in snake, not obstacle. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\n- East: (4,2) - occupied by seg1, not tail, collision, and reverse not allowed since direction west, east is reverse.\n\nSo possible moves: south to (3,1) or west to (2,2).\n\n(3,1) is at bottom, similar to before.\n\n(2,2) is near obstacles.\n\nBut let's see how to reach (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5.\n\nFrom current, I need to go up and right.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,5), I need to eat it within 8 turns.\n\nBut first, on turn 47, I must move L to (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 48, I should choose a move that allows me to navigate towards (5,5).\n\nIf I go down to (4,1), I get stuck and must go to (3,1), then from (3,1), I can go north to (3,2) or west to (2,1), but (2,1) might be free? y=1, x=2.\n\n(2,1) not obstacle, not wall.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can go north to (2,2) or east to (3,1) but that's back, or west to (1,1), but (1,1) might be free, but there is obstacle at (1,2), so (1,1) should be free.\n\nBut this is going left and down, away from (5,5).\n\nIf from (4,2) I go west to (3,2) on turn 48, then I can go south to (3,1) or west to (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), I can go north to (2,3) or south to (2,1) or west to (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle, so not possible.\n\n(2,3) might be free.\n\nThen to (5,5), I need to go through (3,3) or something, but (3,3) is occupied now.\n\nBut snake moves, so after a few moves, cells free up.\n\nLet's think several turns ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 47: only choice is L to (4,2).\n\nAction turn 47: L\n\nThen for turn 48, from (4,2), I can go S or W.\n\nGo to (4,1) or (3,2).\n\nIf I go S to (4,1), then as above, I must go W to (3,1) on next turn.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can go N to (3,2) or W to (2,1).\n\nIf I go N to (3,2), then from (3,2), I can go W to (2,2) or S to (3,1) but S is back, or other directions.\n\nFrom (3,2), as above, can go S or W.\n\nBut let's assume I go to (4,1) on turn 48.\n\nTurn 48: move S to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 49: from (4,1), only choice W to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 50: from (3,1), can go N to (3,2) or W to (2,1)\n\nSay I go N to (3,2) to go up.\n\nThen turn 51: from (3,2), can go W to (2,2) or S to (3,1), but S is back, or N to (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied? At that point, snake positions have changed.\n\nThis is messy; I need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nPerhaps I should go to (3,2) on turn 48 instead.\n\nFrom (4,2) on turn 48, move W to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 49: from (3,2), can go S to (3,1) or W to (2,2)\n\nIf I go W to (2,2), then I can continue.\n\nBut let's see the food at (5,5).\n\nAnother thing: the tail is moving, so cells are freeing up.\n\nFor example, after turn 47, tail was at (2,5), then after turn 48, depending on move.\n\nBut in both cases, the tail is moving left or down.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (2,4), which might block paths.\n\nTo reach (5,5) from (3,2) or (4,1), I need to go up to y=5.\n\nBut between, there are snake body parts.\n\nFor instance, the area around (3,3) to (3,5) is occupied.\n\nAfter several moves, those will clear as the snake moves.\n\nLet's estimate the path to (5,5).\n\nFrom current position after turn 47: (4,2)\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), so delta x=1, delta y=3, so I need at least 4 moves to reach, but with obstacles and body, it might take more.\n\nDirect path: from (4,2) to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied now, and will be for a while.\n\n(4,3) is body, and as snake moves, it will move down or left.\n\nIf I move down to (4,1), I'm going away.\n\nIf I move west to (3,2), I can then go north later.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (3,3) when it's free, but (3,3) is currently occupied, and when I move, it might free up.\n\nLet's fast forward a few turns.\n\nSuppose on turn 48, from (4,2) I move W to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 48: head to (3,2), snake as above.\n\nThen on turn 49, from (3,2), I can move W to (2,2) or S to (3,1)\n\nIf I move W to (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction W.\n\nThen neighbors: (2,2) at x=2,y=2\n\nNorth: (2,3) - free? Not occupied, not obstacle. Obstacle at (2,4), but (2,3) free.\n\nSouth: (2,1) - free\n\nEast: (3,2) - occupied, and reverse not allowed.\n\nWest: (1,2) - but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, not possible.\n\nSo from (2,2), can go N to (2,3) or S to (2,1)\n\nIf I go N to (2,3), then to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot go to (2,4).\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go north to (2,4) not possible, east to (3,3), or west to (1,3) but (1,3) is not obstacle? (1,3) is within bounds, x=1,y=3, not wall, and no internal obstacle listed, so free? Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, south to (2,2) but back.\n\nSo from (2,3), can go N not possible, E to (3,3), W to (1,3), S to (2,2)\n\nBut at that time, (3,3) may be free or not.\n\nSimilarly, if I go S to (2,1) from (2,2), then to bottom.\n\nBut let's aim for (5,5).\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 49, instead of west, I can go south to (3,1)\n\nThen from (3,1), can go W to (2,1) or N to (3,2) back, or E to (4,1) which may be occupied.\n\nBut not productive.\n\nSo better to go west from (3,2) to (2,2) on turn 49.\n\nThen from (2,2) on turn 50, go north to (2,3)\n\nThen from (2,3) on turn 51, I can go east to (3,3) or west to (1,3)\n\n(3,3) is currently occupied, but by turn 51, it might be free.\n\nLet's see the snake movement over turns.\n\nStart from after turn 47: snake at [(4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)] tail at (2,5)\n\nAfter turn 48: I move to (3,2), so head to (3,2), then snake: head (3,2), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (5,2), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (3,3), seg8 (3,4), seg9 (3,5) tail at (3,5)\n\n(2,5) is free now.\n\nOn turn 49, from (3,2), move W to (2,2)\n\nThen head to (2,2), snake: head (2,2), seg1 (3,2), seg2 (4,2), seg3 (5,2), seg4 (6,2), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (5,3), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (3,3), seg9 (3,4) tail at (3,4)\n\n(3,5) is free.\n\nOn turn 50, from (2,2), move N to (2,3)\n\nHead to (2,3), snake: head (2,3), seg1 (2,2), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (5,2), seg5 (6,2), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (5,3), seg8 (4,3), seg9 (3,3) tail at (3,3)\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nOn turn 51, from (2,3), I can move E to (3,3) or W to (1,3) or N to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, not possible.\n\nSo options E or W.\n\n(3,3) is currently tail position, but on turn 51, when I move, (3,3) is occupied by tail, but if I move to (3,3), it might be safe if the tail moves.\n\nAt the time of move, on turn 51, head at (2,3), and (3,3) is occupied by tail? In the positions above, before move, tail is at (3,3), so if I move east to (3,3), that is the current tail position, so it should be safe because the tail will move away.\n\nSimilarly, moving west to (1,3) is free.\n\nBut to go towards (5,5), I should move east to (3,3).\n\nThen after eating, but no food there, just moving.\n\nMove to (3,3), which is current tail, so no collision.\n\nThen new head at (3,3), and so on.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can then go north to (3,4) or east to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) might be free or not.\n\nLet's continue.\n\nOn turn 51: move E to (3,3)\n\nThen head at (3,3), snake: head (3,3), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (2,2), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (4,2), seg5 (5,2), seg6 (6,2), seg7 (6,3), seg8 (5,3), seg9 (4,3) tail at (4,3)\n\n(3,4) free? Old seg9 was (3,3)? Before move: positions [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)] tail at (3,3)\n\nAfter move head to (3,3): but (3,3) is the current tail, so moving there is safe, and the tail moves.\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nSeg1: old head (2,3)\n\nSeg2: old seg1 (2,2)\n\nSeg3: old seg2 (3,2)\n\nSeg4: old seg3 (4,2)\n\nSeg5: old seg4 (5,2)\n\nSeg6: old seg5 (6,2)\n\nSeg7: old seg6 (6,3)\n\nSeg8: old seg7 (5,3)\n\nSeg9: old seg8 (4,3)  // tail at (4,3)\n\nOld tail (3,3) is gone, so (3,3) is new head position.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move to available cells.\n\nNeighbors: (3,3) at x=3,y=3\n\nNorth: (3,4) - free, as above\n\nSouth: (3,2) - occupied by seg3, body, collision\n\nEast: (4,3) - occupied by seg9, which is tail? seg9 is at (4,3), which is tail, so moving to (4,3) might be safe if tail moves.\n\nBut (4,3) is current tail position.\n\nWest: (2,3) - occupied by seg1, not tail, collision\n\nNorth: (3,4) free\n\nSo can go north to (3,4) or east to (4,3) if tail allows.\n\nSince (4,3) is tail, moving there should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is free.\n\nTo go to (5,5), I should go east or north.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), so from (3,3), go east to (4,3) but (4,3) is tail, so move to (4,3).\n\nThen from there to (5,3) or (4,4), etc.\n\nBut let's see the food at (5,5).\n\nI'm digressing.\n\nBack to turn 48 decision.\n\nOn turn 48, if I go south to (4,1), it leads to bottom and I might get stuck.\n\nIf I go west to (3,2), I can then go to (2,2), (2,3), then to (3,3), etc., which is better for reaching (5,5).\n\nMoreover, from (3,3), I can go north to (3,4), then (3,5), but (3,5) might be free later.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go east to (4,5), then to (5,5).\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (6,4), which might affect.\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, so from (5,5), moving east to (6,5) might be possible, but (6,5) not obstacle.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 48, moving west to (3,2) seems better for long-term access.\n\nAlso, for the food at (5,5), with life span 8 after turn 48, I have time.\n\nBut I need to output actions for turn 47 and beyond.\n\nTurn 47: must move L to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 48: I choose to move W to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 49: from (3,2), move W to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 50: from (2,2), move N to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 51: from (2,3), move E to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 52: from (3,3), I can move N to (3,4) or E to (4,3)\n\n(3,4) is free, (4,3) is tail, so both possible.\n\nBut to reach (5,5), from (3,3), moving east to (4,3) then to (5,3) might be better.\n\n(5,3) is currently occupied, but will be free.\n\nAfter turn 51, when head at (3,3), snake positions as above: head (3,3), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (2,2), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (4,2), seg5 (5,2), seg6 (6,2), seg7 (6,3), seg8 (5,3), seg9 (4,3) tail\n\n(5,3) is seg8, not free.\n\nIf I move east to (4,3) on turn 52, which is current tail, so safe.\n\nHead to (4,3), then new snake: head (4,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (2,2), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (5,2), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (5,3) tail at (5,3)\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move north to (4,4) or east to (5,3) which is tail, or south to (4,2) but occupied, or west to (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo can go N to (4,4) or E to (5,3)\n\nIf go E to (5,3), to tail, safe.\n\nThen to (5,3), then from there to (5,4) or (6,3), etc.\n\n(5,5) is above.\n\nSo from (5,3), move north to (5,4), then to (5,5).\n\n(5,4) might be free.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3) go north to (4,4), then east to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut let's see the number of turns.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,5) has life span, after turn 48, 8 left, turn 49:7, turn 50:6, turn 51:5, turn 52:4, etc.\n\nBy turn 52, I can be at (4,3) or (3,4), then to (5,5) in a few moves.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) on turn 52, move E to (5,3) on turn 53, then on turn 54 move N to (5,4), turn 55 to (5,5), so by turn 55.\n\nLife span at turn 52 is 4, so after turn 52, 3 left? Let's calculate life span.\n\nAt turn 47, food at (5,5) has life span 9, meaning it will disappear after 9 turns if not eaten.\n\nAfter turn 47, if not eaten, life span decreases to 8 at start of turn 48.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 48, 7, and so on.\n\nIt disappears after N turns, so at turn 47, life span 9, it can be eaten on turn 47,48,..., up to turn 55? Since it disappears after turn 55 if not eaten by then.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn t, if life span N, it can be eaten on turn t to t+N-1, and disappears after turn t+N-1.\n\nStandard: if life span N at turn t, it exists from turn t to turn t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n\nHere, at turn 47, life span 9, so food exists on turns 47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54, and disappears after turn 54? Let's think.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\"\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 47, countdown 9, after turn 47, if not eaten, countdown 8 at turn 48, ..., after turn 55, if not eaten, countdown 0, disappears? After turn t, countdown decreases.\n\nExample: if life span 1 at turn t, it disappears after turn t, meaning on turn t it can be eaten, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, life span 9 at turn 47: on turn 47, countdown 9, can be eaten; after turn 47, countdown 8 for turn 48; ... after turn 55, countdown 0, so on turn 56 it is gone, but last chance to eat is turn 55 when countdown 1.\n\nTurn 47: countdown 9\n\nTurn 48: countdown 8\n\n...\n\nTurn 55: countdown 1\n\nTurn 56: countdown 0, disappears, so cannot be eaten on turn 56.\n\nSo must be eaten by turn 55.\n\nIn my plan, if I eat on turn 55, it's ok.\n\nNow, in the path, from turn 47 to 55, I can reach.\n\nIn the west path, by turn 55 I can be at (5,5).\n\nIf I go south on turn 48, it might take longer.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) turn 48 S to (4,1), then turn 49 W to (3,1), then turn 50 N to (3,2), then turn 51 W to (2,2), turn 52 N to (2,3), turn 53 E to (3,3), etc., which is slower, turn 53 at (3,3), then to (5,5) might take 3 more turns, to turn 56, but food gone, so I miss it.\n\nTurn 53 at (3,3), turn 54 to (4,3), turn 55 to (5,3), turn 56 to (5,4), but turn 56 food gone, and I eat on turn 56 or later, too late.\n\nWhereas in west path, turn 51 at (3,3), turn 52 to (4,3), turn 53 to (5,3), turn 54 to (5,4), turn 55 to (5,5), eat on turn 55, just in time.\n\nIn the first path: turn 50 at (2,3), turn 51 to (3,3), turn 52 to (4,3), turn 53 to (5,3), turn 54 to (5,4), turn 55 to (5,5), yes.\n\nIf from (4,3) on turn 52, I go directly north if possible, but to (4,4), then (4,5), then (5,5), but (4,4) might be free.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (4,3) to (5,3) is better.\n\nAnyway, I can reach by turn 55.\n\nNow, back to turn 47 and 48.\n\nOn turn 47, action L.\n\nOn turn 48, action W to (3,2).\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output from turn t1, t1+1, etc., for at least 5 turns or so.\n\nTurn t1=47.\n\nAlso, for turn 48, I decided W.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nMoreover, I should consider if there are risks.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger.\n\nBut here no food near tail, so ok.\n\nAlso, in the path, when I go to (3,3) on turn 51, it was tail, but I move there when it is tail, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, later.\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nTurn 47: L (only choice)\n\nTurn 48: W (to (3,2))\n\nThen turn 49: from (3,2), I can go W to (2,2) or S to (3,1), but I choose W to (2,2) for the path.\n\nTurn 50: from (2,2), go N to (2,3)\n\nTurn 51: from (2,3), go E to (3,3)\n\nTurn 52: from (3,3), go E to (4,3)  // since (4,3) is tail\n\nThen beyond, but I think 5 turns ahead from turn 47: turns 47,48,49,50,51.\n\nBut for turn 52, I can include if needed.\n\nSince the food is critical, I should plan to eat it.\n\nBut in the output, I need to specify actions for several turns.\n\nAlso, after eating, I need to survive.\n\nBut first, let's output.\n\nIn turn 48, if I go S, it might be safer or something, but I risk not reaching the food.\n\nWith life span, I have to go west.\n\nMoreover, the internal obstacles: (6,4) is near (5,5), but I can avoid.\n\n(6,4) obstacle, so from (5,5), I cannot go to (6,4), but can go to (6,5) or (5,6), etc.\n\nBut not immediate issue.\n\nSo I think moving west on turn 48 is better.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 47: L\n\nTurn 48: W (left, but in direction, W is left, same as L? In the action, it's U/D/L/R, so L for left.\n\nIn the state, head direction is given as L, meaning left.\n\nIn answer, actions are U, D, L, R.\n\nSo for turn 48, from (4,2) to (3,2), that is west, so L (since x decreases).\n\nIn grid, x horizontal, y vertical, I assume.\n\nSo moving to (3,2) is left, so action L.\n\nSimilarly, to (4,1) is down, action D.\n\nBut I choose L for turn 48.\n\nThen turn 49: from (3,2) to (2,2), west, action L.\n\nTurn 50: from (2,2) to (2,3), north, action U.\n\nTurn 51: from (2,3) to (3,3), east, action R.\n\nThen for turn 52: from (3,3) to (4,3), east, action R.\n\nBut turn 52 is beyond, but I can include.\n\nSince the question says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format is to list actions starting from t1.\n\nIn answer, I should list for the current and next few turns.\n\nPerhaps 5 actions: turns 47 to 51.\n\nTurn 47: L\n\nTurn 48: L (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 49: L (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 50: U (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 51: R (to (3,3))\n\nThat should be fine.\n\nFor turn 52, it would be R to (4,3), but not necessary to output.\n\nIn the plan, I need to ensure no dead ends.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5).\n\n(5,4) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is food.\n\nAfter eating, length increases, but I need to avoid collisions.\n\nBut for now, this seems a path to the food.\n\nIf on turn 48 I go down, I might not reach in time.\n\nSo I think this is better.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 47\\), the snake must move left (L) to (4,2) on turn 47, as this is the only safe move due to constraints (no reverse to right, up and down blocked by body/obstacle). For subsequent turns, the plan prioritizes reaching the positive food at (5,5) by turn 55 (within its remaining life span of 9 turns starting from turn 47) while avoiding risks and ensuring long-term survival. The chosen path moves the snake westward initially to avoid the bottom-left dead end and navigates around obstacles and body segments to approach (5,5) efficiently. Actions are planned for turns 47 to 51, with the sequence ensuring the snake can reach (5,5) by turn 55.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Turn 47 (Current Turn)**: Only possible move is left (L) to (4,2) to avoid collision and obstacles.\n- **Food at (1,3)**: Life span 1 means it disappears after turn 47; not reachable this turn, so ignored.\n- **Food at (5,5)**: Life span 9 at turn 47, so must be eaten by turn 55. The planned path reaches it by turn 55.\n- **Movement Constraints**: No instant reverse is respected (e.g., after moving left, right is not allowed next). Collision risks (body, walls, obstacles) are avoided in all moves.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: The path avoids dead ends (e.g., moving south on turn 48 would trap the snake near y=1) and positions the snake to access open areas after eating the food.\n- **Path to (5,5)**: \n  - Turn 47: Move to (4,2).\n  - Turn 48: Move west to (3,2) to start navigating toward (5,5) and avoid the bottom row.\n  - Turn 49: Move west to (2,2) to continue path and free up space.\n  - Turn 50: Move north to (2,3) to approach the central area.\n  - Turn 51: Move east to (3,3) (safe, as it is the tail cell at that time).\n  - Beyond: From (3,3), the snake can move to (4,3) on turn 52 (tail cell), then to (5,3) on turn 53, (5,4) on turn 54, and (5,5) on turn 55 to eat the food.\n- **Risks Avoided**: The path does not move into obstacles (e.g., (2,4) is avoided) or body segments. Tail movements are handled safely (e.g., moving to tail cells only when tail will move away).\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 47 to 51):\n- Turn 47: Move left (L) to (4,2) – only safe option.\n- Turn 48: Move left (L) to (3,2) – avoids dead end and starts path to food.\n- Turn 49: Move left (L) to (2,2) – continues westward path; (3,2) becomes body, freeing space.\n- Turn 50: Move up (U) to (2,3) – moves north to access row y=3 for eastward movement.\n- Turn 51: Move right (R) to (3,3) – safe move to tail cell; positions for direct approach to (5,5).\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake survives and reaches (5,5) by turn 55. After turn 51, continue moving east then north to eat the food and maximize score.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 47: L \\\\\nTurn 48: L \\\\\nTurn 49: L \\\\\nTurn 50: U \\\\\nTurn 51: R\n}",

        "step": 48,
        "score": 9,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 48. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,2), then (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to (4,2) from (5,2)? Positions are listed head first, so from (4,2) to (5,2) etc. Since head is at (4,2) and direction is L, that means it moved left to (4,2), so previous head was at (5,2) I think. But for movement, I need to know where it can go next.\n\nCurrent head is at (4,2), direction is L, so it came from the right, meaning it can't move right instantly because of no reverse rule. Possible moves: since direction is L, it can go L (left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be reverse.\n\nNow, food: only one food item at (5,5) with value 1 and life span 9. Value is +1, so positive food.\n\nLife span 9 means it disappears after 9 turns, including this turn, so it will be there for 9 more turns starting from now? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 48, life span is 9, so it will be gone after turn 56? Let's calculate: at turn t, life_span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it's there for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone at t+N. So for turn 48, life_span 9, it will be present until turn 56, and gone at turn 57? Turn t: countdown N, so after this turn, countdown becomes N-1, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So at turn 48, countdown=9, so after turn 48, countdown=8; ... after turn 56, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 57. So it can be eaten from turn 48 to turn 56 inclusive? Let's clarify:\n\n- At the start of turn t, food with life_span N has N turns left, including turn t.\n\n- After the snake moves on turn t, if it eats, food is consumed; if not, life_span decreases by 1.\n\n- When life_span reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n\nSo for food at (5,5) on turn 48 with life_span 9: after turn 48 action, if not eaten, life_span becomes 8, and so on. It can be eaten as long as life_span > 0 before the move. After move, if not eaten, life_span decreases.\n\nBut for planning, it will be available until turn 48 + 8 = 56? Turn 48: before move, life_span=9, can be eaten; after move, if not eaten, life_span=8.\n\nTurn 49: before move, life_span=8, can be eaten; after move, if not eaten, life_span=7.\n\n...\n\nTurn 56: before move, life_span=1, can be eaten; after move, if eaten, gone; if not eaten, life_span=0 and disappears.\n\nSo last chance to eat is turn 56, when life_span is 1 before move.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score with survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. Size 8x8, walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions: list them to see where body is.\n\nHead: (4,2)\n\nBody: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nTail: (2,5)\n\nNow, food at (5,5)\n\nCurrent head position: (4,2)\n\nPossible moves from (4,2):\n\n- U: up to (4,3)\n\n- D: down to (4,1)\n\n- L: left to (3,2)\n\n- R: right to (5,2)\n\nBut R is reverse? Current head direction is L, so moving right would be opposite, not allowed. So only U, D, L possible.\n\nNow, check if these cells are safe.\n\nFirst, U: to (4,3)\n\nWhat is at (4,3)? From snake positions, (4,3) is the 6th segment? Positions: index 0: head (4,2), 1: (5,2), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (4,3), so (4,3) is a body segment. Moving to (4,3) would be collision with body, since it's not the tail. Tail is at (2,5), so (4,3) is part of body, not tail. So moving there would kill the snake.\n\nTherefore, U is not safe.\n\nD: down to (4,1)\n\nIs (4,1) occupied? Snake positions don't have (4,1), walls? x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, borders are walls, but (4,1) is not border, since y=1, x=4, y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall unless internal obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1) is an obstacle, but (4,1) is not listed, so should be free? But is it within bounds? x=4, y=1, y=0 is wall, so y=1 is row 1, not wall. But (4,1) is not in obstacles, so should be empty.\n\nBut let's confirm walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles are given separately.\n\nSo (4,1): x=4 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, and not in internal obstacles list: (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) is different cell. So (4,1) should be free.\n\nSnake body: positions are (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). No (4,1), so empty.\n\nSo D to (4,1) might be possible, but I need to consider if it's safe and for future moves.\n\nL: left to (3,2)\n\n(3,2): is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,3) is there, but (3,2) not listed. Walls: not border, internal obstacles have (1,2) but not (3,2). So (3,2) should be free.\n\nR: not possible, reverse.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (4,1) or L to (3,2)\n\nNow, food is at (5,5), which is far from (4,2). I need to plan how to get there safely.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 10 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head at (4,2), body: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo let's plot this:\n\nRow y=5: cells: x=2: snake tail (2,5), x=3: (3,5), x=4: ?, x=5: ?, x=6: ?, etc.\n\nBetter to list by rows.\n\ny=5: (2,5) snake, (3,5) snake, and food at (5,5), but (5,5) is food, not snake yet. Snake has (2,5) and (3,5), so (4,5) free? (5,5) food.\n\ny=4: (3,4) snake, and obstacle at (2,4) and (6,4)? Internal obstacles: (2,4) and (6,4), so (2,4) wall, (6,4) wall. Snake (3,4), so (4,4) free? (5,4) free? etc.\n\ny=3: snake positions: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) and (6,2) but (6,2) is y=2? Let's list all.\n\nSnake segments:\n\n- (4,2) head\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5) tail\n\nAlso, obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow, food at (5,5)\n\nI need to get to (5,5) to eat the food.\n\nCurrent head at (4,2). Distance to (5,5): Δx=1, Δy=3, so Manhattan distance 4.\n\nBut with obstacles and body, I need a path.\n\nPossible moves now: from (4,2), can go D to (4,1) or L to (3,2)\n\nIf I go L to (3,2), then head at (3,2)\n\nThen from there, possible moves: since moved left, direction L, so can go L, U, D.\n\n(3,2) to where? U to (3,3), but (3,3) is body segment, so collision.\n\nD to (3,1), which might be free? (3,1): not border, not in obstacles (obstacles have (5,1), (6,1), (1,2), not (3,1)), so free.\n\nL to (2,2), but (2,2): internal obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2) is wall, (2,2) not listed, so should be free? But (1,2) is obstacle, (2,2) is adjacent.\n\n(2,2) not in obstacles, not border, so free.\n\nBut (2,2) is not occupied by snake? Snake has (2,5), (3,5), etc., no (2,2).\n\nSo from (3,2), possible: D to (3,1) or L to (2,2), since U to (3,3) is body.\n\nR to (4,2) but that's where body is now, but after move, when head moves to (3,2), the body will shift, so (4,2) will be free? Let's think about movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail is removed.\n\nSo after moving from (4,2) to (3,2), the new positions: head (3,2), then (4,2) becomes body? No: the segments: old head was (4,2), moves to (3,2), so new head (3,2). Then the first body segment (5,2) moves to (4,2), second body (6,2) moves to (5,2), third body (6,3) moves to (6,2)? Let's list the new positions after moving head to (3,2).\n\nCurrent positions before move: [ (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (3,2): head is now at (3,2), then the body segments shift: the segment that was at (4,2) is now occupied by the next segment, but the list: the first body segment (5,2) moves to where head was, (4,2)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo:\n\n- New head: (3,2)\n\n- Then the segment that was at index 1 (5,2) moves to where head was, (4,2)\n\n- Segment that was at index 2 (6,2) moves to where index 1 was, (5,2)\n\n- Segment that was at index 3 (6,3) moves to where index 2 was, (6,2)\n\n- Segment that was at index 4 (5,3) moves to where index 3 was, (6,3)\n\n- Segment that was at index 5 (4,3) moves to where index 4 was, (5,3)\n\n- Segment that was at index 6 (3,3) moves to where index 5 was, (4,3)\n\n- Segment that was at index 7 (3,4) moves to where index 6 was, (3,3)\n\n- Segment that was at index 8 (3,5) moves to where index 7 was, (3,4)\n\n- Segment that was at index 9 (2,5) moves to where index 8 was, (3,5)\n\n- And the tail, (2,5) is left, so it disappears, and the new tail is at (3,5)? After move, positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nOld index 9 (2,5) moved to (3,5), so new positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n\nTail is at (3,5)\n\n(2,5) is no longer occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (4,1), let's see.\n\nBut back to planning.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I go L to (3,2), then as above, head at (3,2), and body as above.\n\nThen from (3,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Direction: since I moved left to (3,2), head direction is L, so cannot move R (right) instantly.\n\nPossible: U to (3,3), but (3,3) is now a body segment in new positions? New positions have (3,3) as the 8th segment? List: indices 0: (3,2) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (5,2), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (3,4), 9: (3,5) tail.\n\nSo (3,3) is at index 7, body segment.\n\nIf I move U to (3,3), it's occupied, collision.\n\nD to (3,1): not occupied, not wall, should be free.\n\nL to (2,2): not occupied, not wall. (2,2) is free.\n\nR to (4,2): but (4,2) is body segment, index 1, occupied, so collision, and also reverse not allowed since direction L, R is opposite.\n\nSo from (3,2), can go D to (3,1) or L to (2,2).\n\nNow, if I go D to (3,1), that might be risky because of obstacles or dead ends.\n\n(3,1): y=1, x=3. Obstacles: (5,1) and (6,1) are walls, but (3,1) not obstacle. Borders y=0 wall, but y=1 ok.\n\nBut from there, I might get stuck.\n\nSimilarly, if I go L to (2,2), then head at (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is free, but there is obstacle at (2,4) and (1,2), so (1,2) is wall, (2,4) wall.\n\nBut (2,2) should be ok.\n\nThen from there, I can move, but it might not lead to food directly.\n\nNow, the other option from start: move D to (4,1) from (4,2).\n\nThen new positions: head to (4,1), then body: segment 1 (5,2) to (4,2), segment 2 (6,2) to (5,2), segment 3 (6,3) to (6,2), segment 4 (5,3) to (6,3), segment 5 (4,3) to (5,3), segment 6 (3,3) to (4,3), segment 7 (3,4) to (3,3), segment 8 (3,5) to (3,4), segment 9 (2,5) to (3,5), so new positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n\nTail at (3,5).\n\nNow from (4,1), head direction: since I moved down, direction D, so cannot move U instantly.\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,1), R to (5,1), D to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so D not possible.\n\nU to (4,2), but (4,2) is body segment, index 1, occupied, collision.\n\nL to (3,1): not occupied, should be free.\n\nR to (5,1): but (5,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\nSo only possible move from (4,1) is L to (3,1).\n\nThen head at (3,1), and so on.\n\nBut this seems like it might lead to a dead end, with obstacles around.\n\nSpecifically, from (4,1), only can go to (3,1), then from (3,1), direction L, so can go L, U, D.\n\n(3,1) to U (3,2): but (3,2) may be free or not, depending on previous moves, but in this case, if I came from (4,1), to (3,1), then U to (3,2), which might be free.\n\nD to (3,0) y=0 wall, not possible.\n\nL to (2,1): (2,1) not obstacle, not border, free.\n\nBut (2,1) has obstacle at (1,2) and (2,4), but (2,1) should be ok.\n\nHowever, this area has obstacles, and the snake is long, so moving down might trap me.\n\nMoreover, food is at (5,5), which is top-right relative to current position.\n\nSo moving down or left might take me away from food.\n\nBut I need to get to (5,5) safely.\n\nPerhaps I should not go down or left immediately.\n\nBut from (4,2), only D or L are possible, since U is body, R is reverse not allowed.\n\nL to (3,2) might be better.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go L to (2,2) or D to (3,1).\n\n(2,2) is closer to the left side, but food is at (5,5), so better to go up or right, but right is not directly possible.\n\nFrom (3,2), if I go L to (2,2), then head at (2,2).\n\nThen from (2,2), direction L, so can go L, U, D.\n\nL to (1,2): but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\nU to (2,3): (2,3) not occupied? Let's see current state after moving to (2,2).\n\nFirst, from (3,2), move L to (2,2).\n\nNew positions: head to (2,2), then body: old index 1 (4,2) to (3,2), index 2 (5,2) to (4,2), index 3 (6,2) to (5,2), index 4 (6,3) to (6,2), index 5 (5,3) to (6,3), index 6 (4,3) to (5,3), index 7 (3,3) to (4,3), index 8 (3,4) to (3,3), index 9 (3,5) to (3,4), so new positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n\nTail at (3,4).\n\nFrom (2,2), direction L (since moved left), so cannot move R (right) instantly.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2) but (1,2) wall, not possible.\n\nD to (2,1): not occupied, not wall.\n\nU to (2,3): not occupied? (2,3) not in snake positions, not wall.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (2,4), but (2,3) is different.\n\nSo can go U or D.\n\nU to (2,3) or D to (2,1).\n\nThen I can continue, but it's getting messy.\n\nI need to think about reaching the food.\n\nFood at (5,5), head at (4,2). I need to go up and right.\n\nBut from (4,2), I can't go up or right directly.\n\nSo I need to find a path.\n\nFirst, let's list free cells or possible paths.\n\nGrid:\n\nLet me sketch a mental map.\n\nRows y=0 to 7, cols x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)  so these are walls.\n\nSnake occupies: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nFood at (5,5)\n\nFree cells: for example, (4,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5) food, (6,5), (7,5) but x=7 wall, so (6,5) free? (6,4) obstacle, so (6,5) might be free.\n\nLet's list all free cells or areas.\n\nPerhaps I can go from (4,2) to (3,2), then to (3,1) or (2,2), but that's down or left.\n\nFrom (3,2), I could go U but not possible because (3,3) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (3,2), the cell (3,3) is body, but as the snake moves, cells become free.\n\nFor example, if I move to (3,2), then from there, if I go D to (3,1), then later I can come back.\n\nBut I need to go to (5,5).\n\nAnother idea: the food at (5,5) is near the tail or something.\n\nTail is at (2,5), food at (5,5), so different.\n\n(3,5) is body, (3,4) body, etc.\n\nTo reach (5,5), I can go via (4,3) or (5,4) etc., but (4,3) is currently body, but it will move.\n\nLet's think about the path over time.\n\nSince the food has life span 9, I have until turn 56 to eat it, so I have time to maneeuver.\n\nBut I need to survive and find a safe path.\n\nAlso, there is a risk of Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (2,5), food at (5,5), not adjacent, so no issue now.\n\nBut when I approach, I need to be careful.\n\nFirst, let's find a sequence to reach (5,5).\n\nFrom current position (4,2), move L to (3,2) -- that seems better than D to (4,1) which might trap me.\n\nSo let's choose L to (3,2) for turn 48.\n\nThen turn 48: move L to (3,2)\n\nAfter move, positions as above: head (3,2), body (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) tail.\n\nDirection is L.\n\nNow turn 49: from (3,2), can go D to (3,1) or L to (2,2) or U but U to (3,3) is body, not possible.\n\nR to (4,2) is body and reverse, not possible.\n\nSo D or L.\n\nIf I go L to (2,2), then as before, head to (2,2), body shifts, new positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) tail.\n\nThen from (2,2), direction L, so can go U to (2,3) or D to (2,1), not L to (1,2) wall, not R reverse.\n\nU to (2,3): free? (2,3) not occupied, not wall.\n\nD to (2,1): free.\n\nIf I go U to (2,3), then head at (2,3), body shifts.\n\nBut (2,3) is below (2,4) which is obstacle, so (2,4) wall, so I can't go up from there directly.\n\n(2,3) to U (2,4) is wall, not possible.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go R to (3,3) or L to (1,3) or D to (2,2) but (2,2) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), then (2,2)? Let's not go this way; it seems inefficient.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 49, better to go D to (3,1).\n\nThen head to (3,1), body shifts: new positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) tail.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 50: from (3,1), direction D, so can go D, L, R.\n\nD to (3,0) y=0 wall, not possible.\n\nL to (2,1): free, not occupied.\n\nR to (4,1): free? (4,1) not occupied, not wall.\n\nU to (3,2) but (3,2) is body segment, occupied, and also reverse not allowed since direction D, U is opposite.\n\nSo can go L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nSay I go R to (4,1), then head at (4,1), body shifts: new positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail.\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (4,1), turn 51: direction R, so can go R, U, D.\n\nR to (5,1): but (5,1) obstacle, wall, not possible.\n\nU to (4,2): but (4,2) is body segment, occupied.\n\nD to (4,0) y=0 wall, not possible.\n\nL to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), positions have (3,1) as body, so U to (4,2) is body, L to (3,1) is body, R to (5,1) wall, D wall.\n\nNo possible moves! Dead end.\n\nIf from (3,1) I go L to (2,1) instead.\n\nTurn 50: from (3,1) go L to (2,1)\n\nHead to (2,1), body shifts: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 51: from (2,1), direction L, so can go L, U, D.\n\nL to (1,1): (1,1) not wall? x=1, y=1, not border, internal obstacles have (1,2) but not (1,1), so free.\n\nU to (2,2): free.\n\nD to (2,0) wall, not possible.\n\nR to (3,1) but (3,1) body, occupied, and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo can go L to (1,1) or U to (2,2).\n\nIf U to (2,2), then head at (2,2), etc., but still away from food.\n\nIf L to (1,1), then head at (1,1), body shifts, but (1,1) is cornered with obstacles, might trap.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo moving down or left initially seems bad.\n\nBack to turn 48, from (4,2), instead of L, I have to go D to (4,1), but we saw that leads to dead end quickly.\n\nFrom (4,1), after move, only can go L to (3,1), then from (3,1), can go L to (2,1) or R to (4,1) but (4,1) is not body yet? After moving to (3,1), positions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) tail.\n\nFrom (3,1), direction L (since moved left from (4,1)? From (4,1) to (3,1) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen can go L to (2,1), U to (3,2), D to (3,0) not possible.\n\nU to (3,2): (3,2) is body segment, occupied.\n\nL to (2,1): free.\n\nR to (4,1): but (4,1) is body, occupied.\n\nSo only L to (2,1), then same as before.\n\nSo both choices from (4,2) seem to lead to potential traps or dead ends.\n\nBut there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (3,2) and then instead of D or L, but from (3,2) only D or L possible.\n\nUnless after moving, the body moves and some cells become free.\n\nFor example, after moving to (3,2) on turn 48, at turn 49, from (3,2), if I go nowhere, but I have to move.\n\nAnother idea: the cell (4,3) was body, but after moving to (3,2), the new positions have (4,3) at index 6, but when I move, it shifts.\n\nBut (4,3) is still occupied.\n\nPerhaps later, when the tail moves, cells free up.\n\nBut I need to reach (5,5).\n\nLet's list the area around (5,5).\n\n(5,5) food.\n\nNearby cells: (4,5), (6,5), (5,4), (5,6) but y=6, y=7 wall, so (5,6) not possible, y=5 is max? y=0 to 7, y=7 wall, so y=6 is free but border not wall, y=7 wall.\n\ny=6 is not wall, but cells.\n\n(5,4): is it free? Currently, snake has (5,3) at some point, but (5,4) not occupied, not wall. Obstacles: (6,4) wall, but (5,4) free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) free, (4,5) free, (6,5) free, (5,5) food.\n\n(3,5) is snake body, (3,4) snake, (3,3) snake.\n\nTo reach (5,5), I can come from (5,4), (4,5), or (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is near (6,4) obstacle, so might be tight.\n\nBut (6,5) is free.\n\nNow, from current position, how to get there.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a way that the snake coils or something to free space.\n\nSince the head is at (4,2), and the body is to the right and up, I need to go around.\n\nAnother thought: the cell (3,2) is free, so move L to (3,2) on turn 48.\n\nThen on turn 49, from (3,2), I go D to (3,1) to avoid the left side for now.\n\nThen from (3,1), on turn 50, I can go R to (4,1) but we saw that leads to dead end.\n\nFrom (3,1), go L to (2,1), then U to (2,2), etc., but slow.\n\nPerhaps from (4,2), I can only choose L or D, and L to (3,2) is better because it allows me to go up later.\n\nAfter moving to (3,2), the body shifts, and on turn 49, if I go D to (3,1), then at turn 50, from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, not free.\n\nLet's simulate the body movement.\n\nTurn 48: move L to (3,2)\n\nPositions: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n\nTail at (3,5).\n\nTurn 49: from (3,2), move D to (3,1)\n\nNew head (3,1), then body: (3,2) moves to where head was? New positions: head (3,1), then the segment that was at (4,2) moves to (3,2), that was index 1 (4,2) to (3,2)? Let's list:\n\nOld positions: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (5,2), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (3,4), 9: (3,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,1):\n\n- New head: (3,1)\n\n- Then index 1 (4,2) moves to old head position (3,2)\n\n- Index 2 (5,2) moves to old index 1 position (4,2)\n\n- Index 3 (6,2) moves to old index 2 position (5,2)\n\n- Index 4 (6,3) moves to old index 3 position (6,2)\n\n- Index 5 (5,3) moves to old index 4 position (6,3)\n\n- Index 6 (4,3) moves to old index 5 position (5,3)\n\n- Index 7 (3,3) moves to old index 6 position (4,3)\n\n- Index 8 (3,4) moves to old index 7 position (3,3)\n\n- Index 9 (3,5) moves to old index 8 position (3,4)\n\nSo new positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n\nTail at (3,4).\n\nNow from (3,1), turn 50: direction D (since moved down), so can go D, L, R.\n\nD to (3,0) wall, not possible.\n\nL to (2,1): free.\n\nR to (4,1): free.\n\nU to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, occupied, and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo L or R.\n\nSay I go R to (4,1) to move towards the center.\n\nHead to (4,1), body shifts: new head (4,1), then index 1 (3,2) moves to (3,1), index 2 (4,2) moves to (3,2), index 3 (5,2) moves to (4,2), index 4 (6,2) moves to (5,2), index 5 (6,3) moves to (6,2), index 6 (5,3) moves to (6,3), index 7 (4,3) moves to (5,3), index 8 (3,3) moves to (4,3), index 9 (3,4) moves to (3,3), so new positions: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nTail at (3,3).\n\nNow from (4,1), turn 51: direction R (since moved right from (3,1) to (4,1)? From (3,1) to (4,1) is right, so direction R.\n\nCan go R, U, D.\n\nR to (5,1): but (5,1) obstacle, wall, not possible.\n\nU to (4,2): (4,2) is body segment, occupied.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, not possible.\n\nL to (3,1): (3,1) is body, occupied.\n\nNo moves! Dead end.\n\nIf on turn 50 from (3,1) I go L to (2,1) instead.\n\nTurn 50: move L to (2,1)\n\nHead to (2,1), body shifts: new positions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail.\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 51: from (2,1), direction L, can go L, U, D.\n\nD to (2,0) wall, not possible.\n\nL to (1,1): free.\n\nU to (2,2): free.\n\nR to (3,1) body, not possible.\n\nSo go U to (2,2) for example.\n\nHead to (2,2), body shifts: new positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\nDirection U (since moved up).\n\nThen turn 52: from (2,2), direction U, can go U, L, R.\n\nU to (2,3): free.\n\nL to (1,2): but (1,2) obstacle, wall, not possible.\n\nR to (3,2): (3,2) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (2,1) body, not possible.\n\nSo only U to (2,3).\n\nHead to (2,3), body shifts: new positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail.\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 53: from (2,3), direction U, can go U, L, R.\n\nU to (2,4): but (2,4) obstacle, wall, not possible.\n\nL to (1,3): free? (1,3) not wall.\n\nR to (3,3): (3,3) not occupied? In positions, (3,3) is not there, but earlier it was tail, but after shifts, (3,3) is free now? Current positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) so (3,3) not occupied.\n\nAnd not wall, so free.\n\nD to (2,2) body, not possible.\n\nSo can go L to (1,3) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf go R to (3,3), then head at (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) is closer to food area.\n\nFood at (5,5), so from (3,3), I can go to (4,3) or (3,4) etc.\n\nBut this is taking many turns, and I'm at turn 53, food life span until turn 56, so I have time, but let's see if I can reach faster.\n\nBut from the beginning, there might be a better way.\n\nNotice that the snake body is blocking the way up from (4,2).\n\nBut after I move, the body will move, freeing cells.\n\nFor example, if on turn 48 I move L to (3,2), then on turn 49, instead of D, I have to choose L or D, but U is not possible.\n\nUnless I wait, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can go to (4,1) but we saw it's bad.\n\nOr, the only way is to go left or down, but then loop around.\n\nBut with obstacles, it's hard.\n\nLet's list all cells to see free paths.\n\nGrid cells:\n\nRow y=0: all wall\n\ny=1: x=0 wall, x=1 free? x=2 free, x=3 free, x=4 free, x=5 obstacle, x=6 obstacle, x=7 wall\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,1) and (6,1), so for y=1, x=5 and x=6 are walls.\n\nx=1 to 4 free, but (1,2) is obstacle for y=2.\n\ny=1: x=0 wall, x=1 free, x=2 free, x=3 free, x=4 free, x=5 wall (obstacle), x=6 wall (obstacle), x=7 wall.\n\ny=2: x=0 wall, x=1: obstacle (1,2), so wall, x=2 free, x=3 free, x=4 snake head, x=5 snake, x=6 snake, x=7 wall\n\nSnake at (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), so occupied.\n\nAlso (1,2) obstacle.\n\ny=3: x=0 wall, x=1 free, x=2 free, x=3 snake (3,3), x=4 snake (4,3), x=5 snake (5,3), x=6 snake (6,3), x=7 wall\n\n(6,3) snake, and (3,3) snake.\n\ny=4: x=0 wall, x=1 free, x=2 obstacle (2,4), so wall, x=3 snake (3,4), x=4 free?

In positions, no (2,5), not wall.\n\nR to (4,5): free.\n\nD to (3,4) body, not possible.\n\nSo can go U to (3,6), L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n\nFood at (5,5), so R to (4,5) or directly.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (4,5) is right, then from (4,5) to (5,5).\n\nMove R to (4,5) on turn 55.\n\nTurn 54 we moved U to (3,5), so turn 55 move R to (4,5).\n\nHead to (4,5), body shifts: new head (4,5), then (3,5) to (3,5)? Old index 1 (3,4) moves to (3,5), so (3,5), index 2 (3,3) moves to (3,4), so (3,4), index 3 (2,3) moves to (3,3), so (3,3), index 4 (2,2) moves to (2,3), so (2,3), index 5 (2,1) moves to (2,2), so (2,2), index 6 (3,1) moves to (2,1), so (2,1), index 7 (3,2) moves to (3,1), so (3,1), index 8 (4,2) moves to (3,2), so (3,2), index 9 (5,2) moves to (4,2), so (4,2), tail at (4,2).\n\nNew positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,5), direction R (since moved right), so can go R, U, D.\n\nR to (5,5): food! Can eat it.\n\nU to (4,6): free.\n\nD to (4,4): free.\n\nL to (3,5) body, not possible.\n\nSo on turn 56, move R to (5,5) to eat the food.\n\nThen snake grows, so new tail added.\n\nBut check for Tail Reward Danger: head at (4,5) adjacent to (5,5)? No, (4,5) to (5,5) is adjacent, but when I move to (5,5), the food is there, but the tail is at (4,2), not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nEating food: value +1, length increases.\n\nLife span of food is 9 at turn 48, so on turn 48, before move, life_span=9.\n\nAfter turn 48 move, not eaten, life_span=8.\n\n...\n\nOn turn 56, before move, life_span should be 1? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 48: life_span=9 before move; after move, if not eaten, life_span=8.\n\nTurn 49: before move, life_span=8; after move, not eaten, life_span=7.\n\n...\n\nTurn 56: before move, life_span = 9 - (56-48) = 9-8=1? Turns: from 48 to 56 is 8 turns later.\n\nAt start of turn 48, life_span=9.\n\nAfter turn 48 action, if not eaten, life_span=8.\n\nStart of turn 49, life_span=8.\n\nAfter turn 49, not eaten, life_span=7.\n\n...\n\nStart of turn 56, life_span=9 - (56-48) = 9-8=1.\n\nAfter move on turn 56, if eaten, food consumed; if not, life_span=0 and disappears.\n\nSo on turn 56, I can eat it.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 56, move to (5,5) to eat.\n\nIn the plan, turn 55: head at (4,5), move R to (5,5) on turn 56.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I started from turn 48 to turn 56, but I need to output actions from turn 48 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nTurn 48: move L\n\nTurn 49: move D\n\nTurn 50: move L\n\nTurn 51: move U\n\nTurn 52: move U\n\nTurn 53: move R\n\nTurn 54: move U\n\nTurn 55: move R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 56: move R to (5,5)\n\nBut turn 55 move R to (4,5)? From (3,5) to (4,5) is right, yes.\n\nIn turn 55, I moved to (4,5), then turn 56 to (5,5).\n\nBut in the answer, I need to list actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nSince food is eaten on turn 56, I can stop there or plan beyond.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turns starting from t1=48.\n\nSo for turn 48 to, say, turn 53 or so.\n\nBut I have a plan to eat the food.\n\nTo maximize score, I eat one food, but there might be more later, but here only one food given.\n\nThe state has only one food listed.\n\nSo with this, I can eat it safely.\n\nBut is this the shortest path? Probably not, but it works and avoids dead ends.\n\nFrom turn 48, other choices might be faster.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), if I move D to (4,1), but we saw it leads to dead end, so not possible.\n\nSo L to (3,2) is the only viable start.\n\nThen on turn 49, I moved D to (3,1), but I could move L to (2,2) directly.\n\nTurn 49 from (3,2): move L to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 50 from (2,2) move U to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 51 from (2,3) move R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 52 from (3,3) move R to (4,3) or U to (3,4)\n\nIf move R to (4,3)\n\nHead to (4,3), body shifts.\n\nThen from (4,3) can go to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) might be occupied earlier, but in the sequence, it could be free.\n\nBut let's not complicate; the first sequence works.\n\nSo for answer, I can output the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 54 I moved U to (3,5), turn 55 to (4,5), turn 56 to (5,5).\n\nBut for the answer, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should list actions for about 5 turns or until key point.\n\nTurn t1=48, so list from turn 48 to, say, turn 53.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the plan, I have turns 48 to 56, but that's 9 turns, too many to list? But the format says to list actions, so I can list as many as needed, but perhaps for 5 turns is fine, with the plan to eat later.\n\nSince the food is the goal, I can list until I eat or something.\n\nBut let's see the requirement: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nFor turn 48, action is L.\n\nThen for turn 49, in my plan, D.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nPerhaps I can find a shorter path.\n\nAnother idea: from (4,2), move L to (3,2) on turn 48.\n\nThen on turn 49, from (3,2), move L to (2,2) — but earlier I thought U not possible, but after move, (3,3) is still body.\n\nIn new positions after turn 48 move, (3,3) is body, so from (3,2) cannot go U.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nIf I go L to (2,2) on turn 49.\n\nThen turn 50 from (2,2) move U to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 51 from (2,3) move R to (3,3)\n\nNow at (3,3), which is closer.\n\nThen turn 52 from (3,3) move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 53 from (3,4) move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 54 from (4,4) move R to (5,4) or U to (4,5)\n\nThen to (5,5).\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut let's use the first sequence.\n\nFor the answer, I'll list actions from turn 48 to turn 53, which is 6 turns, 5+ ahead.\n\nThen implicitly continue to food.\n\nBut to be complete.\n\nSince the food life span is long, and I have a safe path, I think it's fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 48: L\n\nTurn 49: D\n\nTurn 50: L\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: R\n\nThen beyond, to U on turn 54, R on 55, R on 56, but not listed.\n\nFor the box, list from turn 48 onwards for a few turns.\n\nThe format says to list actions, so I can list multiple.\n\nBut to save space, perhaps 5 turns.\n\nTurn t1=48, so turns 48,49,50,51,52,53 that's 6 turns.\n\nNow, in turn 51, I moved U, which is to (2,2) to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to specify the action.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the direction.\n\nAlso, for turn 48, action L.\n\nIn the state, head direction is L, and I move L, which is allowed, not reverse.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to confirm, are there any risks?\n\nIn the path, when I move to (3,3) on turn 53, it was free, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, later to (3,4), (3,5), all good.\n\nAnd eating on turn 56.\n\nBut since I need to output for current, I'll list for the first few turns.\n\nPerhaps I should include until the food is reached, but that might be long.\n\nThe instruction says \"maximize score by eating positive food\", and \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so listing 5 moves should be sufficient, with the plan to reach food.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 48: L\n\nTurn 49: D\n\nTurn 50: L\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: R\n\nThen the snake will continue to move towards (5,5) and eat it safely.\n\nTo be precise in the format.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 48\\), the snake must avoid immediate collisions and plan a path to eat the positive food at (5,5) with a value of +1 and a life span of 9 (meaning it can be eaten until turn 56). The snake starts at (4,2) with direction L (left), so it cannot move right (reverse) on the next turn. Possible moves from (4,2) are up (U), down (D), or left (L), but moving up to (4,3) causes a body collision. Thus, only moving down to (4,1) or left to (3,2) is safe.\n\nMoving down to (4,1) leads to a dead end quickly due to walls and body blocks, so moving left to (3,2) is chosen for turn 48. This begins a path to maneuver around obstacles and the body to reach (5,5) safely by turn 56. The plan prioritizes survival by avoiding risky cells and ensures the food is eaten before it disappears.\n\nThe sequence for the next 6 turns (5+ turns ahead) is as follows, with actions chosen to:\n- Avoid walls and body collisions.\n- Gradually move towards (5,5) while keeping options open.\n- Ensure the snake can reach the food by turn 56 without dying.\n\nAfter turn 53, the snake will continue to (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), and then (5,5) to eat the food on turn 56.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n- Turn 48: Move L (left) to (3,2) – Safe, avoids body and walls, starts path toward food area.\n- Turn 49: Move D (down) to (3,1) – Avoids moving left into a potential trap and keeps the center accessible.\n- Turn 50: Move L (left) to (2,1) – Moves away from the body and toward open space on the left.\n- Turn 51: Move U (up) to (2,2) – Shifts upward to align for moving right toward the food.\n- Turn 52: Move U (up) to (2,3) – Continues upward, avoiding the obstacle at (2,4).\n- Turn 53: Move R (right) to (3,3) – Moves right toward the center, setting up for the approach to (5,5).\n\n**Continuation beyond turn 53 (for context, not part of the answer format):**\n- Turn 54: Move U to (3,4)\n- Turn 55: Move R to (4,5)\n- Turn 56: Move R to (5,5) to eat the food (life span 1 at turn start, consumed safely; no tail reward danger as tail is distant).\n\nThis path ensures the snake survives, eats the food by turn 56, and avoids all risks (e.g., no instant reverse, no collisions). The food life span is sufficient for this route, and thinking 5+ turns ahead prioritizes long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 48: L \\\\\nTurn 49: D \\\\\nTurn 50: L \\\\\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U \\\\\nTurn 53: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 49, and I have to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So, I can't move into these cells.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left last turn.\n\nFood: There are two food items:\n\n- At (5,5) with value 1 and life span 8. So it will disappear after 8 turns, including this turn, so it has 7 turns left after this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 49, life span 8 means it will disappear after turn 56 (49 + 8 - 1 = 56? Let me calculate properly.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N, it's gone. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, if life span is L at turn t, after this turn, it will have L-1 left, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So for food at (5,5) with life span 8 at turn 49: after turn 49, life span becomes 7; after turn 50, 6; ... down to 0 after turn 56, so it disappears at the start of turn 57 or something. But for planning, I just need to know how many turns it has left. At turn 49, life span 8, so it can be eaten from turn 49 to turn 56 inclusive? Since it disappears after N turns, meaning it's present for N turns starting from now. Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life span N, it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? I need to clarify.\n\nAssume that \"disappears after N turns\" means it is present for exactly N turns from the current turn. So at turn t, it has life span N, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N. So for (5,5): turn 49, life span 8, so available from turn 49 to 56, disappears at turn 57.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) with life span 10, available from turn 49 to 58, disappears at turn 59.\n\nBoth foods have value +1, so positive food.\n\nNow, snake head is at (3,2), direction left. So last move was left to (3,2) from (4,2), I think. Positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), so yes, it moved left to (3,2).\n\nCurrent possible moves: Since head direction is L, I can move U, D, or L, but not R because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is the direction the head is facing, which is L, so I cannot move R (right) on this turn.\n\nSo for turn 49, I can move U, D, or L.\n\nNow, let's list the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (3,2)\n\n- Body: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nTail is at (3,5).\n\nFood at (5,5) and (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is directly above the tail? Tail is at (3,5), so (3,6) is one cell above.\n\nBut (3,6) is a food position. Is it under the snake body? Snake body: let's list all positions:\n\n(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nSo (3,5) is tail, (3,4), (3,3), etc. (3,6) is not occupied by snake, it's empty, since y=6 is above.\n\ny=0 is bottom? Usually in grids, y increases up or down? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nIn positions: head (3,2), and (3,5) is at y=5, so higher y is up.\n\nFood (3,6) at y=6, so above (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) at x=5,y=5.\n\nNow, (3,6) is adjacent to tail? Tail at (3,5), so (3,6) is directly above, adjacent.\n\nBut food is not under body; it's at (3,6), which is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is empty? Let's see if any snake at (5,5): positions are (3,2),(4,2),(5,2),(6,2),(6,3),(5,3),(4,3),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5). No (5,5), so both foods are on empty cells.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for turn 49 and beyond.\n\nFirst, for turn 49: head at (3,2), direction L, so I can move U, D, or L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,3) — but (3,3) is occupied by the snake body. It's the 8th segment? Positions: index 0: head (3,2), 1: (4,2), 2: (5,2), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (3,4), 9: (3,5) tail.\n\nSo (3,3) is position 7, a body segment.\n\nIf I move U to (3,3), that would be a body collision, which is deadly. So I cannot move U.\n\n- D: to (3,1) — is this within bounds? y=1, x=3. Borders: y=0 is wall, so y=1 is not wall. Internal obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), (2,4), etc., no (3,1). So (3,1) should be free? But let's confirm walls.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (3,1) has x=3 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,1) is a wall, but (3,1) is not listed, so it should be free. Similarly, no other walls at (3,1).\n\nSo (3,1) is free. But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: all listed, no (3,1), so yes, free.\n\n- L: to (2,2) — x=2, y=2. Borders: x=2 not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (2,4) is a wall, but (2,2) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: no (2,2), so free.\n\n- R: to (4,2) — but (4,2) is the second segment, body. And moving right would be opposite to current direction? Current direction is L, so moving R is reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So R is invalid anyway.\n\nSo for turn 49, possible moves: D to (3,1) or L to (2,2). U is invalid because (3,3) is body.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFood: (5,5) and (3,6). (3,6) is closer, but let's see paths.\n\nAlso, there's a danger with tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and collides.\n\nTail is at (3,5), and food is at (3,6), which is adjacent to tail. If I go to (3,6) and eat it, since it's positive food, snake grows, so after eating, the new tail is added, but let's see.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, the food is not on the tail; the food is at (3,6), tail is at (3,5). So if head moves to (3,6), it eats the food, and since it's positive, length increases. But the tail is at (3,5), which doesn't have food; the food is at (3,6), separate cell.\n\nThe danger is only if the food is on the tail cell itself. Rule says: \"if the tail cell has positive food\", meaning the cell where the tail is located has food that can be eaten when head moves there.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (3,5), no food there. Food is at (3,6), so if head moves to (3,6), it eats the food, tail is still at (3,5) for now.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move that turn? When snake eats food, it grows, so the tail stays in place or something? I need to recall snake mechanics.\n\nStandard snake: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each segment moves to the next position. If no food eaten, tail moves away, so the last cell is free. If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n\nIn terms of positions: after move, if head eats food, the new head is at food cell, and the tail remains, so the segment that was tail is now the new segment, and tail doesn't advance.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,5). If head moves to (3,6) and eats food, then the snake grows: head now at (3,6), and tail stays at (3,5), but (3,5) becomes the second last, and a new segment is added, so tail is still at (3,5)? Let's think.\n\nBefore move: positions: H(3,2), ... , T(3,5)\n\nAfter move, say to (3,6): head moves to (3,6), which has food, so eats it. Then the body moves: the segment behind head was (4,2) moves to (3,2)? No.\n\nThe positions shift: the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo if head moves to (3,6), then:\n\n- New head: (3,6)\n\n- Then the segment that was at (3,2) moves to where? The segment after head was at (4,2), but now it moves to the position of the previous head, which is (3,2).\n\nList the positions before move: index 0: (3,2), 1: (4,2), 2: (5,2), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (3,4), 9: (3,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,6) and eating food:\n\nSince food eaten, tail does not move, so the last position is not removed.\n\nNew positions: head at (3,6)\n\nThen segment 1 moves to old pos 0: (3,2)\n\nSegment 2 moves to old pos 1: (4,2)\n\n...\n\nUp to segment 9 moves to old pos 8: (3,4)\n\nAnd a new segment is added at the end, at the position where the tail was, which is (3,5), but since tail didn't move, it stays, but we add a new segment.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, the tail remains, so the snake gains a segment.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head: (3,6)\n\n- Segment 1: to (3,2)  // old head\n\n- Segment 2: to (4,2)  // old segment 1\n\n- Segment 3: to (5,2)  // old segment 2\n\n- Segment 4: to (6,2)  // old segment 3\n\n- Segment 5: to (6,3)  // old segment 4\n\n- Segment 6: to (5,3)  // old segment 5\n\n- Segment 7: to (4,3)  // old segment 6\n\n- Segment 8: to (3,3)  // old segment 7\n\n- Segment 9: to (3,4)  // old segment 8\n\n- And new segment 10: at old segment 9 position, (3,5)\n\nSo now tail is at (3,5), but that's where it was, and head is at (3,6).\n\nThe cell (3,5) is still occupied, but it's the tail now.\n\nIn this case, head at (3,6), tail at (3,5), they are adjacent, but no issue as long as not colliding.\n\nNow, the Tail Reward Danger: it applies when the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, meaning if there is food on the tail cell itself.\n\nIn this state, tail cell (3,5) has no food; food is at (3,6), which is now head.\n\nSo no danger here.\n\nThe rule: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\n\"eating it\" refers to eating the food on the tail cell.\n\nSo if food is on the tail cell, and head moves to it, then after eating, the new tail grows and causes collision.\n\nBut in this case, no food on tail cell.\n\nSo for (3,6), it should be safe to eat, but I need to get there.\n\nFirst, back to turn 49.\n\nHead at (3,2), can move D to (3,1) or L to (2,2).\n\nNow, let's think about getting to the foods.\n\nFood at (3,6) is closer in terms of vertical distance; head at y=2, food at y=6, so 4 steps up, but with obstacles.\n\nFood at (5,5) is at x=5,y=5, head at x=3,y=2, so Δx=2, Δy=3.\n\nAlso, the snake body is around.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nDraw a grid:\n\ny=7 top, y=0 bottom, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls, but since it's borders, all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo cells: (6,4) wall, (5,1) wall, (2,4) wall, (6,1) wall, (1,2) wall.\n\nSnake: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the bottom left, with a loop or something.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (6,2) right, then (6,3) up, (5,3) left, (4,3) left, (3,3) left, then (3,4) up, (3,5) up.\n\nSo it's like a shape: right from (3,2) to (6,2), up to (6,3), left to (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), then up to (3,4), (3,5).\n\nFood at (5,5) and (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is above the tail at (3,5), so if I can move up to (3,6), I can eat it.\n\nBut to get there from (3,2), I need to go up, but directly above at (3,3) is body, so I can't go up now.\n\nOptions: move left to (2,2) or down to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is below, which might lead me away from the food, but it could be a path around.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is left.\n\nNow, let's think about the area.\n\nI need to avoid colliding with walls or body.\n\nAlso, since I must think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving L to (2,2) on turn 49.\n\nTurn 49: move L to (2,2)\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow, (2,2) is free? We said yes.\n\nBut (1,2) is a wall, internal obstacle, so I cannot move to (1,2) or (2,2) is ok, but adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Current direction L, so cannot move R (right).\n\nCan move U, D, L.\n\nU to (2,3): is (2,3) free? Walls: no wall at (2,3), internal obstacles: (2,4) is wall, but (2,3) not, so should be free. Snake: no snake at (2,3), so free.\n\nD to (2,1): similarly, free? y=1, not border, no wall, no snake.\n\nL to (1,2): but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move L.\n\nR to (3,2): but (3,2) is now the second segment? After move, positions: head was (3,2) to (2,2), so body: (4,2) moves to (3,2), (5,2) to (4,2), etc., tail at (3,5) moves to (3,4)? Let's update positions after turn 49 move.\n\nAssume turn 49: move L to (2,2)\n\nThen new positions:\n\n- Head: (2,2)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,2)  // old head\n\n- Segment 2: (4,2)  // old seg1\n\n- Segment 3: (5,2)  // old seg2\n\n- Segment 4: (6,2)  // old seg3\n\n- Segment 5: (6,3)  // old seg4\n\n- Segment 6: (5,3)  // old seg5\n\n- Segment 7: (4,3)  // old seg6\n\n- Segment 8: (3,3)  // old seg7\n\n- Segment 9: (3,4)  // old seg8\n\n- Segment 10: (3,5)  // old seg9, tail\n\nNo food eaten, so tail moved? Since no food, tail moves away.\n\nOld tail was at (3,5), which is now empty? In the shift, segment 10 moves to old seg9 position (3,4), and the old tail position (3,5) is free now? Let's see indices.\n\nBefore move: positions: 0:(3,2), 1:(4,2), 2:(5,2), 3:(6,2), 4:(6,3), 5:(5,3), 6:(4,3), 7:(3,3), 8:(3,4), 9:(3,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (2,2):\n\n- New head: (2,2)\n\n- New segment 1: old pos 0, (3,2)\n\n- New segment 2: old pos 1, (4,2)\n\n- New segment 3: old pos 2, (5,2)\n\n- New segment 4: old pos 3, (6,2)\n\n- New segment 5: old pos 4, (6,3)\n\n- New segment 6: old pos 5, (5,3)\n\n- New segment 7: old pos 6, (4,3)\n\n- New segment 8: old pos 7, (3,3)\n\n- New segment 9: old pos 8, (3,4)\n\n- New segment 10: old pos 9, (3,5)  // tail\n\nSince no food eaten, the snake moves, so the last segment is removed, but in the position update, the tail moves to the previous position.\n\nIn standard, when no food, the tail cell is freed.\n\nIn terms of positions: the head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the last position is abandoned.\n\nSo after move to (2,2) without eating:\n\n- Head: (2,2)\n\n- Segment 1: was at (4,2) now moves to (3,2)\n\n- Segment 2: was at (5,2) now moves to (4,2)\n\n- Segment 3: was at (6,2) now moves to (5,2)\n\n- Segment 4: was at (6,3) now moves to (6,2)\n\n- Segment 5: was at (5,3) now moves to (6,3)\n\n- Segment 6: was at (4,3) now moves to (5,3)\n\n- Segment 7: was at (3,3) now moves to (4,3)\n\n- Segment 8: was at (3,4) now moves to (3,3)\n\n- Segment 9: was at (3,5) now moves to (3,4)\n\n- Tail: now at (3,4), and (3,5) is free.\n\nPositions: new head (2,2), then body: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) tail.\n\nOld segment 1 was at (4,2), now at (3,2); old segment 2 at (5,2) now at (4,2); etc.\n\nSo tail is now at (3,4).\n\nFrom (2,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (2,3): free? No wall, no snake, yes.\n\nD to (2,1): free? y=1, x=2, not wall, no obstacle, no snake, yes.\n\nL to (1,2): but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nR to (3,2): but (3,2) is now occupied by body (the first body segment), and also moving right is opposite to current direction L, so invalid anyway.\n\nSo can move U or D.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D at turn 49 to (3,1).\n\nTurn 49: move D to (3,1)\n\nThen head at (3,1), direction down.\n\nPositions: new head (3,1), then body: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) tail? After move, no food, so tail moves.\n\nBefore move: positions 0:(3,2),1:(4,2),2:(5,2),3:(6,2),4:(6,3),5:(5,3),6:(4,3),7:(3,3),8:(3,4),9:(3,5)\n\nAfter move head to (3,1):\n\n- Head: (3,1)\n\n- Seg1: to (3,2)\n\n- Seg2: to (4,2)\n\n- Seg3: to (5,2)\n\n- Seg4: to (6,2)\n\n- Seg5: to (6,3)\n\n- Seg6: to (5,3)\n\n- Seg7: to (4,3)\n\n- Seg8: to (3,3)\n\n- Seg9: to (3,4)\n\n- Tail at (3,4), (3,5) free.\n\nFrom (3,1), direction D, so can move U, D, L, R? Current direction D, so cannot move U (up), opposite.\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nD to (3,0): but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (2,1): is it free? x=2,y=1. Walls: no border, internal obstacles: (1,2) is wall, but (2,1) not listed, so free. Snake: no, so free.\n\nR to (4,1): x=4,y=1. Walls: internal (5,1) is wall, but (4,1) not, so free. Snake: no, so free.\n\nU to (3,2): but (3,2) is now body segment, occupied, so invalid.\n\nSo can move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nI need to get to food at (3,6) or (5,5).\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), and tail is at (3,5) now, but after moves, it changes.\n\nBut currently, to reach (3,6), I need to go to (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied by body. So I need to free that cell.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is free, but I need a path.\n\nAlso, life span: (5,5) has life span 8, so available until turn 56, 7 turns from now (turn 49 to 56, 8 turns? Turn 49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56, 8 turns, disappears turn 57.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) life span 10, to turn 58.\n\nSo both have time.\n\nBut (3,6) is closer if I can go up soon.\n\nBut currently blocked at (3,3).\n\nSo I need to move away to free space.\n\nIf I move left to (2,2) on turn 49, then I can go up to (2,3), etc.\n\nOr down to (3,1), then left or right.\n\nLet's consider the risk of the tail food danger.\n\nFor (3,6), it's not on tail, so no danger.\n\nBut if I go to (3,6), and tail is at (3,5), they are adjacent, but after eating, tail is still at (3,5), head at (3,6), so no collision.\n\nThe danger only if food on tail cell.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, another thing: the snake body might block paths.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so more body to avoid.\n\nBut since foods are positive, eating increases length.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat both if possible.\n\nFirst, let's find a path to (3,6).\n\nFrom head at (3,2), I need to go to (3,6).\n\nBut (3,3) is occupied, (3,4) occupied, (3,5) occupied.\n\nSo I cannot go directly up.\n\nI need to go around.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (2,2), then up to (2,3), (2,4), but (2,4) is a wall! Internal obstacle (2,4) is wall.\n\nSo (2,4) is wall, so from (2,3), I cannot go to (2,4), because wall.\n\nSo if I go to (2,2), then U to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can go U, but (2,4) wall, so cannot; D to (2,1), but I just came from (2,2)? Or L, but (1,2) wall, R to (3,3), which might be free later, but not now.\n\nFrom (2,3), after some moves.\n\nBut let's think.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (3,1) at turn 49, then from (3,1), I can move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nThen from there, I can go up or something.\n\nBut y=1 is low, so I need to go up eventually.\n\nPerhaps I can aim for (5,5) first.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), head at (3,2), so I need to go right and up.\n\nBut directly, (4,2) is body, so I cannot go right from (3,2) because R is invalid and occupied.\n\nSo I must go left or down first.\n\nLet's consider moving L to (2,2) on turn 49.\n\nThen turn 49: head to (2,2), direction L.\n\nThen for turn 50, from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3) or D to (2,1).\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), direction U.\n\nThen head at (2,3), direction U.\n\nNow, from (2,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Current direction U, so cannot move D (down).\n\nCan move U, but (2,4) is wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (1,3): is it free? x=1,y=3. Walls: border x=0 wall, but x=1 not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is wall, but (1,3) not listed, so free. Snake: no, so free.\n\nR to (3,3): but (3,3) is body segment, occupied, so invalid.\n\nD to (2,2): but (2,2) is now body, since after move to (2,3), the body is at (2,2), so moving down to (2,2) is body collision.\n\nAlso, moving D is opposite to current direction U, so invalid anyway.\n\nSo only possible move from (2,3) is L to (1,3).\n\nSo must move L to (1,3).\n\nTurn 50: move L to (1,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen head at (1,3), direction L.\n\nNow, from (1,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Current direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nU to (1,4): free? y=4, not border. Internal obstacles: (2,4) is wall, but (1,4) not, so free. Snake: no, so free.\n\nD to (1,2): but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (0,3): but x=0 is border wall, so invalid.\n\nR to (2,3): but (2,3) is now body, occupied, and moving right might be opposite or not, but occupied so invalid.\n\nCurrent direction L, so R is opposite, invalid anyway.\n\nSo can only move U to (1,4).\n\nTurn 51: move U to (1,4), direction U.\n\nHead at (1,4), direction U.\n\nNow, from (1,4), possible moves: U to (1,5): free? y=5, not border, no wall, no snake, free.\n\nD to (1,3): body, occupied.\n\nL to (0,4): x=0 wall.\n\nR to (2,4): but (2,4) is wall, internal obstacle.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nSo only move U to (1,5).\n\nTurn 52: move U to (1,5), direction U.\n\nHead at (1,5), direction U.\n\nThen U to (1,6): free? y=6, not border (y=7 border), no wall, no snake, free.\n\nD to (1,4): body.\n\nL to (0,5): wall.\n\nR to (2,5): free? x=2,y=5, not border, no wall listed, no snake, free.\n\nBut current direction U, so can move U or R or L, but L invalid, so U or R.\n\nU to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf I go to (1,6), then I can go to (1,7), but y=7 wall, so I can only go right or down from (1,6).\n\nBut let's see the food.\n\nFood at (3,6) and (5,5).\n\nFrom (1,5), I can go to (2,5), then to (3,5), but (3,5) is tail, but after several moves, tail might have moved.\n\nLet's track the snake positions over turns.\n\nFirst, this path is leading me to the top left, while food is at (3,6) and (5,5), so I need to turn right.\n\nBut from (1,5), I can go to (2,5) on turn 52.\n\nTurn 52: move to (1,5), then from there.\n\nPerhaps this is not efficient.\n\nIf from (2,2) on turn 49, I move D to (2,1) instead of U.\n\nTurn 49: move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 50: move D to (2,1)\n\nDirection D.\n\nHead at (2,1), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (2,2): body, occupied.\n\nD to (2,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,1): but (1,1) free? x=1,y=1. Walls: internal (1,2) wall, but (1,1) not listed, so free. Snake no.\n\nR to (3,1): free? x=3,y=1, not wall, no obstacle, snake no.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nCan move L or R.\n\nL to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nSay move R to (3,1), then I'm at (3,1), which is where I could be if I moved down initially.\n\nNot better.\n\nMove to (1,1), then from (1,1), I can go U to (1,2), but (1,2) wall, or to (1,0) wall, or (0,1) wall, so stuck, dead end.\n\nFrom (2,1), if move L to (1,1), then only can move U to (1,2) but wall, or other directions invalid, so die.\n\nSo moving D from (2,2) to (2,1) is bad because it might lead to dead end.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (3,1) from (2,1), better.\n\nBut let's consider the other initial choice: move D at turn 49 to (3,1).\n\nTurn 49: move D to (3,1), direction D.\n\nThen from (3,1), can move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\n(2,1) is free, (4,1) is free.\n\nSay move R to (4,1) on turn 50.\n\nDirection R.\n\nHead at (4,1), direction R.\n\nThen from (4,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Current direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nU to (4,2): but (4,2) is body? After previous moves.\n\nLet's track positions.\n\nTurn 49: move D to (3,1)\n\nPositions after turn 49: head (3,1), body: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) tail at (3,4)\n\n(3,5) free now.\n\nTurn 50: move R to (4,1)\n\nHead to (4,1), so new head (4,1)\n\nThen body: seg1 to (3,1)  // old head\n\nSeg2 to (3,2)  // old seg1\n\nSeg3 to (4,2)  // old seg2\n\nSeg4 to (5,2)  // old seg3\n\nSeg5 to (6,2)  // old seg4\n\nSeg6 to (6,3)  // old seg5\n\nSeg7 to (5,3)  // old seg6\n\nSeg8 to (4,3)  // old seg7\n\nSeg9 to (3,3)  // old seg8\n\nTail to (3,4)  // old seg9\n\nOld tail (3,4) moved to (3,3)?

Let's list occupied cells: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSo (3,5) is free, (2,5) free, (3,6) free, etc.\n\nFrom (1,5), if I move R to (2,5) on turn 54.\n\nTurn 54: move R to (2,5), direction R.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction R.\n\nThen from (2,5), can move U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) wall, L to (1,5) body, R to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is free, as above.\n\nU to (2,6) also free.\n\nSo can move U or R.\n\nIf move R to (3,5), then head at (3,5), which is adjacent to food at (3,6).\n\nThen from (3,5), can move U to (3,6) to eat food.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nFirst, turn 54: move to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 55: move to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 56: move to (3,6)\n\nBut at turn 56, food at (3,6) has life span: at turn 49, life span 10, so at turn 56, it has 10 - (56-49) = 10-7=3 turns left? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 49, life span 10, so after turn 49, 9 left; turn 50, 8; ... turn 56, 10 - (56-49) = 10-7=3, so yes, still available.\n\nNow, when I move to (3,6) on turn 56, I eat the food.\n\nBut is there Tail Reward Danger? Tail at that time.\n\nLet's find tail position at turn 56.\n\nFirst, from turn 53: positions after t53 move to (1,5): head (1,5), body: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3) tail at (6,3)\n\nTurn 54: move R to (2,5), no food, so head (2,5), body: seg1 to (1,5), seg2 to (1,4), seg3 to (1,3), seg4 to (2,3), seg5 to (2,2), seg6 to (3,2), seg7 to (4,2), seg8 to (5,2), seg9 to (6,2), tail to (6,3)? After move, tail moves.\n\nBefore move: positions 0:(1,5),1:(1,4),2:(1,3),3:(2,3),4:(2,2),5:(3,2),6:(4,2),7:(5,2),8:(6,2),9:(6,3)\n\nAfter move head to (2,5):\n\n- Head: (2,5)\n\n- Seg1: to (1,5)  // old pos 0\n\n- Seg2: to (1,4)  // old pos 1\n\n- Seg3: to (1,3)  // old pos 2\n\n- Seg4: to (2,3)  // old pos 3\n\n- Seg5: to (2,2)  // old pos 4\n\n- Seg6: to (3,2)  // old pos 5\n\n- Seg7: to (4,2)  // old pos 6\n\n- Seg8: to (5,2)  // old pos 7\n\n- Seg9: to (6,2)  // old pos 8\n\n- Tail at (6,2), (6,3) free.\n\nTurn 55: move R to (3,5)  // from (2,5) to (3,5)\n\nHead to (3,5), direction R.\n\nNo food at (3,5), so move.\n\nNew head (3,5)\n\nBody: seg1 to (2,5)  // old head\n\nSeg2 to (1,5)  // old seg1\n\nSeg3 to (1,4)  // old seg2\n\nSeg4 to (1,3)  // old seg3\n\nSeg5 to (2,3)  // old seg4\n\nSeg6 to (2,2)  // old seg5\n\nSeg7 to (3,2)  // old seg6\n\nSeg8 to (4,2)  // old seg7\n\nSeg9 to (5,2)  // old seg8\n\nTail to (6,2)  // old seg9\n\n(6,2) is tail.\n\nTurn 56: move U to (3,6)\n\n(3,6) has food, so eat it.\n\nHead to (3,6), body moves: seg1 to (3,5)  // old head\n\nSince food eaten, tail does not move, so new segment added.\n\nNew positions: head (3,6)\n\nSeg1: (3,5)  // old head\n\nSeg2: (2,5)  // old seg1\n\nSeg3: (1,5)  // old seg2\n\nSeg4: (1,4)  // old seg3\n\nSeg5: (1,3)  // old seg4\n\nSeg6: (2,3)  // old seg5\n\nSeg7: (2,2)  // old seg6\n\nSeg8: (3,2)  // old seg7\n\nSeg9: (4,2)  // old seg8\n\nSeg10: (5,2)  // old seg9, and new segment at old tail position (6,2)? When food eaten, the new segment is added at the end, so tail remains.\n\nAfter move to (3,6) and eat:\n\n- Head: (3,6)\n\n- Seg1: old pos 0 (3,5)\n\n- Seg2: old pos 1 (2,5)\n\n- Seg3: old pos 2 (1,5)\n\n- Seg4: old pos 3 (1,4)\n\n- Seg5: old pos 4 (1,3)\n\n- Seg6: old pos 5 (2,3)\n\n- Seg7: old pos 6 (2,2)\n\n- Seg8: old pos 7 (3,2)\n\n- Seg9: old pos 8 (4,2)\n\n- Seg10: old pos 9 (5,2)  // new tail, since no tail move\n\nOld tail was at (6,2), which is now free.\n\nHead at (3,6), tail at (5,2), no adjacency issue.\n\nFood eaten, score +1.\n\nNow, the other food at (5,5) with life span 8, at turn 49, by turn 56 it has 8 - (56-49) = 8-7=1 turn left, so must be eaten by turn 56 or gone.\n\nAt turn 56, I am at (3,6), (5,5) is at (5,5), distance |3-5| + |6-5| = 2+1=3, but I need to move to it in one turn, impossible, and at turn 56, if I don't eat it, it disappears.\n\nLife span: at turn 49, life span 8, so available on turns 49 to 56 inclusive, disappears at turn 57.\n\nSo on turn 56, it is still there, but I am at (3,6), cannot reach (5,5) in one move, so I miss it.\n\nIf I go directly to (3,6) earlier.\n\nFrom turn 53 at (1,5), instead of moving R to (2,5), I move U to (1,6).\n\nTurn 53: move U to (1,6), direction U.\n\nHead at (1,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 54: from (1,6), only can move R to (2,6), as before.\n\nThen at (2,6), can move U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6) body, R to (3,6).\n\nSo move R to (3,6) on turn 54 or 55.\n\nTurn 54: move R to (2,6) from (1,6)\n\nThen turn 55: move R to (3,6) from (2,6)\n\nAt turn 55, move to (3,6), eat food.\n\nThen (5,5) has life span, at turn 55, 8 - (55-49) = 8-6=2 turns left, so available at turn 56.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go to (3,5), (4,6), etc., to reach (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), from (3,6), I can go right to (4,6), then (5,6), then down to (5,5), but (5,6) may be free.\n\nAt turn 55, after eating (3,6), snake is longer.\n\nBut (5,5) can be reached in 2 moves: e.g. (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,5) or (3,6) to (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut at turn 55, (5,5) has 2 turns left, so can be eaten at turn 56 or 57? Disappears after turn 56, so must eat by turn 56.\n\nLife span at turn 49:8, so available turns 49 to 56, so on turn 56 it is there, turn 57 gone.\n\nSo at turn 55, I am at (3,6), after eating.\n\nThen on turn 56, I can move to (4,6) or (3,5) or (3,7) invalid or (2,6).\n\n(4,6) might be free.\n\nThen from there, to (5,6) or (4,5), then to (5,5) on turn 57, but turn 57 food gone, so too late.\n\nMust eat by turn 56.\n\nFrom (3,6) on turn 56, I can move directly to (4,6), but (5,5) is at (5,5), not adjacent.\n\n|dx|=2, |dy|=1, not adjacent, so cannot reach in one move.\n\nSimilarly, other moves don't reach (5,5).\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,5) if I eat (3,6) on turn 55.\n\nIf I eat (3,6) earlier, but in this path, the earliest I can eat (3,6) is turn 55 or 56.\n\nFrom turn 49, if I choose to go towards (5,5) first.\n\nBut initially, from (3,2), moving left or down.\n\nPerhaps move down to (3,1) on turn 49, then from there, move to (4,1) but (4,1) is free, but earlier when I tried, it led to dead end.\n\nTurn 49: move D to (3,1), direction D.\n\nThen turn 50: move R to (4,1), but from (4,1), no moves, as we saw earlier.\n\nMove L to (2,1) on turn 50.\n\nThen turn 50: move L to (2,1)\n\nFrom (2,1), move U to (2,2) on turn 51.\n\nThen from (2,2), move U to (2,3) on turn 52, etc., same as before.\n\nSo I think the only way is to go left and up to eat (3,6), and miss (5,5) if it times out.\n\nBut (5,5) has shorter life, so it might be better to go for (5,5) first if possible.\n\nHow to reach (5,5) from (3,2).\n\nHead at (3,2), need to go to (5,5).\n\nBut (4,2) is body, so cannot go right.\n\nMove down to (3,1), then right to (4,1), but from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) but body, or other invalid.\n\nUnless the body moves away.\n\nFor example, turn 49: move D to (3,1)\n\nPositions after: head (3,1), body (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) tail at (3,4)\n\nTurn 50: move R to (4,1)  -- but (4,1) is free, but after moving, head at (4,1), body: seg1 to (3,1), seg2 to (3,2), seg3 to (4,2), etc.\n\nThen from (4,1), as before, U to (4,2) is seg3, body, invalid; D wall; L to (3,1) seg1, body; R to (5,1) wall. All invalid, so death.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nMove to (2,1) on turn 50, then U to (2,2), then to (2,3), but (2,4) wall, so I have to go to (1,3), etc., same as before.\n\nSo it seems that with the snake position, the only safe path is to go left and up to the top left, and eat (3,6) around turn 55-56, and (5,5) will expire before I can reach it.\n\nBut (5,5) has life span 8, so at turn 49, it has 8 turns, so I can reach it later if I go directly.\n\nBut I can't go directly because of the body block.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a way to free the cells.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (3,1), then left to (2,1), then up to (2,2), then right to (3,2) but (3,2) may be body.\n\nTurn 49: move D to (3,1)\n\nTurn 50: move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 51: move U to (2,2)\n\nAt turn 51, head at (2,2), direction U.\n\nPositions after turn 50: after move to (2,1), head (2,1), body: seg1 (3,1), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (4,2), etc., tail at (3,4)\n\nAfter turn 51 move U to (2,2): head (2,2), body: seg1 (2,1), seg2 (3,1), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (4,2), ..., tail at (3,4) or something.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move U to (2,3) or R to (3,2) but (3,2) is seg3, body, occupied, so invalid. L to (1,2) wall, D to (2,1) body. So only U to (2,3).\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo no way to go right early.\n\nTherefore, the best is to go for (3,6) and eat it around turn 55-56.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for turn 49 and a few more, at least 5 turns ahead, so turn 49 to 54 or so.\n\nSince the planning is for multiple turns, I should output the sequence based on the path.\n\nIn the initial choice, for turn 49, I should move L to (2,2) to start going up.\n\nThen the sequence can be:\n\nTurn 49: L\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: L\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U  // to (1,5)\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,5) or (1,6), but for the answer, I can output up to turn 53 or 54.\n\nThe format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format\" with actions for several turns.\n\nCurrent turn 49, so plan for 49,50,51,52,53,54 at least.\n\nBut I can specify the actions.\n\nSince from turn 53 at (1,5), I have choices, but to be specific.\n\nTo reach food faster, from (1,5), I can move R to (2,5) on turn 54, then to (3,5) on turn 55, etc.\n\nBut for the output, I think output the actions for the next 5 turns.\n\nTurn 49: move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 50: move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 51: move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 52: move U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 53: move U to (1,5)\n\nThen for turn 54, I can move R to (2,5) to head towards (3,6).\n\nBut in the answer, I need to box the actions.\n\nAlso, for the other food, I may not reach it, but since life span is short, it's ok.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to (3,6) from another way.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 49, move down to (3,1), then to (2,1), then to (2,2), same as above.\n\nOr, since (3,3) is occupied, but if I move away, it might free soon.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (3,1), then the body moves, and (3,3) might be free later.\n\nBut in the path above, when I go left and up, the body follows, and (3,3) is freed after a few turns.\n\nIn the first path, when I went to (2,2), then up, (3,3) was freed by turn 50 or so.\n\nIn the position after turn 50, when head at (2,3), tail at (3,3), and (3,4) free.\n\nBut I was at (2,3), not able to go to (3,3) immediately.\n\nBut later, when I am at (2,5) or something, I can go to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,6) is above.\n\nI think the sequence I have is reasonable.\n\nSo for turn 49: move L\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 49: L\n\nTurn 50: U (from (2,2) to (2,3))\n\nTurn 51: L (from (2,3) to (1,3))\n\nTurn 52: U (from (1,3) to (1,4))\n\nTurn 53: U (from (1,4) to (1,5))\n\nFor turn 54, I can move R to (2,5), but since the answer might not require all, but to be complete, I can add.\n\nThe core is to start with L on turn 49.\n\nBut earlier I considered moving D, but it might lead to dead end or slower.\n\nSo I think L is better.\n\nAlso, for the food at (3,6), with this path, I can eat it around turn 55-56.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) expires at turn 56, but I am not near, so I miss it, but it's only one point, and I get the other.\n\nIf I can eat both, but I think not possible with the time.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing paths that lead to positive food while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body. The current state (turn 49) has the snake head at (3,2) moving left. The available moves are down (D) to (3,1) or left (L) to (2,2), as up (U) leads to a body collision at (3,3) and right (R) is invalid due to instant reverse.\n\nAfter evaluating paths:\n- Moving down (D) to (3,1) risks dead ends or slow progress toward food, as paths from (3,1) are limited and may lead to traps (e.g., moving right to (4,1) results in no valid moves on the next turn).\n- Moving left (L) to (2,2) allows a safer and more efficient path upward to reach the positive food at (3,6) (value +1, life span 10, available until turn 58). This path avoids immediate collisions and leverages the grid layout to approach the food in about 5-6 turns.\n\nThe food at (5,5) (value +1, life span 8, available until turn 56) is too far to reach safely by turn 56 given the snake's position and obstacles. Attempting to reach it would require risky maneuvers and likely result in missing both foods or causing a collision. Thus, the plan focuses on eating (3,6) for a guaranteed +1 score.\n\nThe sequence for turns 49 to 54 is planned as follows:\n- **Turn 49**: Move left (L) to (2,2) to avoid the body and start the upward path.\n- **Turn 50**: Move up (U) to (2,3), as only left (L) or up (U) are valid from (2,2), and up progresses toward (3,6).\n- **Turn 51**: Move left (L) to (1,3), as (2,4) is a wall, making left the only safe move from (2,3).\n- **Turn 52**: Move up (U) to (1,4), continuing the upward path with no other valid moves.\n- **Turn 53**: Move up (U) to (1,5), positioning to turn right toward the food.\n- **Turn 54**: Move right (R) to (2,5), initiating the approach to (3,6) for a planned eat on turn 55 or 56.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake survives, avoids all collisions, and reaches (3,6) by turn 56. Beyond turn 54, the snake can continue to (3,5) on turn 55 and (3,6) on turn 56 to eat the food safely, with no Tail Reward Danger (food is not on the tail cell). The path is collision-free based on simulated body movements and grid constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 49: L (left)  \nTurn 50: U (up)  \nTurn 51: L (left)  \nTurn 52: U (up)  \nTurn 53: U (up)  \nTurn 54: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 50. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,2), then body segments: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (2,2) from (3,2)? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (2,2) <- head, then (3,2), so if head is at (2,2) and previous was (3,2), that means it moved left to (2,2). Direction is L, so current head direction is left.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (5,5) with life span 7, value +1 (since it says \"positive food\" and value=1)\n\n- (3,6) with life span 9, value +1\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So cells to avoid.\n\nSnake: positions in order:\n\n- Head: (2,2)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- Tail: (3,4)\n\nSo the snake body: from (2,2) to (3,2) to (4,2) to (5,2) to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then left to (5,3), left to (4,3), left to (3,3), then up to (3,4). So tail is at (3,4).\n\nHead at (2,2), direction left. So last move was from (3,2) to (2,2), moving left.\n\nPossible moves from (2,2): since direction is left, I can move left, up, or down, but not right because that would be instant reverse? Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent head direction is L (left), so opposite is R (right). So I cannot move right on this turn. Possible moves: L (left), U (up), D (down). But L left to (1,2)? (1,2) is an internal obstacle? Walls include (1,2), let's check.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Yes, (1,2) is a wall, so I cannot move left to (1,2) because it's a wall.\n\nSo from (2,2), possible moves:\n\n- Left to (1,2): but (1,2) is wall, invalid.\n\n- Up to (2,3): is that free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nCurrent snake positions: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). So (2,3) is not in this list, and not a wall? Walls: borders and internal. (2,3): x=2, y=3. Not border, not in internal obstacles list: internal are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is wall, but (2,3) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, down to (2,1): (2,1) not in snake, not wall? Walls: y=0 is bottom, so (2,1) not border, not internal obstacle except (5,1) and (6,1), but (2,1) is free? Internal obstacles are (5,1) and (6,1), so (2,1) should be free.\n\nBut borders: y=0 is wall, so (2,1) is not y=0, y=0 is row 0, so (x,0) for x=0 to 7 are walls. Similarly, (0,y), (7,y), (x,7) walls.\n\n(2,1): x=2, y=1, not border, not internal obstacle, so should be free.\n\nBut snake body: positions include (2,2), (3,2), etc., but not (2,1) or (2,3).\n\n(2,3) might be free, but let's confirm.\n\nAlso, food: (5,5) and (3,6), both with value +1.\n\nLife span: for (5,5), life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 50, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 56? Let's see: on turn 50, life span 7, so after turn 50, it has 6 turns left? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Example: if life span 1 on turn t, it disappears after turn t, so can be eaten only on turn t.\n\nIf life span N on turn t, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – might be ambiguous.\n\nRule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo on the turn it spawns, countdown is N, decreases each turn, when countdown 0, it disappears after that turn? Better to think: with life span N, it is present for N turns, from turn t to t + N - 1.\n\nFor food at (5,5) with life span 7 on turn 50, it will be present until turn 56? Turn 50: life span 7, so after turn 50, 6 left; turn 51: 5 left; ... turn 56: 1 left? On turn when countdown decreases to 0, it disappears after that action or before?\n\nI think it's safer to assume that on turn t, with countdown C, it can be eaten, and after the turn, countdown decreases, so if C=1 on turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, and disappears after turn t.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,6) life span 9 on turn 50, present until turn 58? Turn 50:9, 51:8, ..., 58:1, 59:0? Disappears after turn when countdown reaches 0.\n\nBut for planning, since we are at turn 50, (5,5) must be eaten by turn 56, and (3,6) by turn 58.\n\nNow, back to current position: head at (2,2), direction left.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Left to (1,2): but (1,2) is wall, invalid.\n\n- Up to (2,3): let's check if free. (2,3) not in snake positions, not wall. Snake: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). (2,3) not there. Walls: borders no, internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is wall, but (2,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\n- Down to (2,1): similarly, (2,1) not in snake, not wall (internal obstacles include (5,1) and (6,1), but not (2,1)), and not border, so free.\n\n- Right to (3,2): but (3,2) is the next body segment, and moving right would be into the body, but (3,2) is not the tail; tail is (3,4). Also, instant reverse: current direction left, moving right is opposite, so invalid anyway.\n\nCannot move right because it's instant reverse and also into body.\n\nSo only possible moves: Up to (2,3) or Down to (2,1).\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to the food while avoiding risks.\n\nFood at (5,5) and (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is closer? Head at (2,2), (3,6) is at x=3,y=6, so distance |3-2| + |6-2| =1+4=5 Manhattan.\n\n(5,5) is |5-2| + |5-2| =3+3=6.\n\nBut with obstacles, not direct.\n\nAlso, life span: (5,5) has shorter life, must be eaten sooner.\n\nLife span 7 on turn 50, so eat by turn 56; (3,6) life span 9, eat by turn 58.\n\nTurn 50 to 56 is 6 turns, to 58 is 8 turns.\n\nBut I need to plan actions for multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving up or down.\n\nIf I move up to (2,3), what next?\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move up, down, left, right, but need to avoid walls and body, and no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head direction after moving up: if I move up from (2,2) to (2,3), new direction is U.\n\nThen from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), but (2,4) is wall? Internal obstacle (2,4), yes, (2,4) is wall, so cannot move up.\n\nD to (2,2), but (2,2) is now the body? After moving to (2,3), the snake body: head moves to (2,3), so positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), etc. down to (3,4).\n\nSo (2,2) is now the second segment, so moving down to (2,2) would be body collision, invalid.\n\nL to (1,3): (1,3) not wall? Walls: x=0 wall, y=0, etc. (1,3): x=1,y=3, not border, internal obstacles: (1,2) is wall, but (1,3) not listed, so should be free? Internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,2) is wall, but (1,3) is not, so free.\n\nR to (3,3): (3,3) is body? Current positions after move: head (2,3), body (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), tail (3,4). (3,3) is a body segment, so moving right to (3,3) would collide with body.\n\nList after moving up to (2,3):\n\n- Turn 50: move U to (2,3)\n\nSnake positions: head (2,3), then the previous head (2,2) becomes neck, so segments: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), and tail (3,4) but since head moved, tail moves? No, when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten, length same, tail moves away from (3,4) to (3,3)? Let's think.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nStart positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n\nIf head moves to (2,3), then new positions: head (2,3), then the segments follow: first body segment to (2,2), second to (3,2), third to (4,2), fourth to (5,2), fifth to (6,2), sixth to (6,3), seventh to (5,3), eighth to (4,3), ninth to (3,3), and the tail (3,4) is no longer part of snake, so removed. So new snake: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)] with 10 segments? From head to tail: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). But previously (3,3) was there, now it's the tail, and (3,4) is gone.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (2,3), 1: (2,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (5,2), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (3,3) tail.\n\nSo from (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,4): but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\n- D to (2,2): but (2,2) is now occupied by body segment at index 1, so collision, invalid.\n\n- L to (1,3): (1,3) not occupied, not wall (since (1,2) is wall but (1,3) not), so possible.\n\n- R to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by tail at index 9, but since it's a body segment, moving there would collide, and also, in snake, when you move, if you move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, but here (3,3) is currently occupied, and after move, the tail will move, but at the time of move, the cell is occupied, so it's a collision unless it's the tail and you are moving to it, but in this case, (3,3) is not the tail that will move away; let's think carefully.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if the head moves to the current tail position, it is allowed because the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nBut in this case, from (2,3) to (3,3), (3,3) is the current tail position? In the new positions, after move to (2,3), tail is at (3,3).\n\nIf I move head to (3,3), which is the current tail, then since the tail will move (to where? When head moves to (3,3), the body segments shift: head to (3,3), then the first body segment moves to (2,3), which was head, but (2,3) is now occupied by the new position? Standard: when head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nIf head is at (2,3), and I move to (3,3), which is currently the tail.\n\nCurrent positions before this move: head (2,3), body (2,2), (3,2), ..., (3,3) tail.\n\nIf I move head to (3,3), then the new head is (3,3), and the first body segment moves to (2,3), which is the previous head position, then (2,2) moves to (2,3)? Let's sequence:\n\n- Current: positions [A= (2,3), B= (2,2), C= (3,2), D= (4,2), E= (5,2), F= (6,2), G= (6,3), H= (5,3), I= (4,3), J= (3,3)] with J tail.\n\nMove head to new position P.\n\nIf P is (3,3), which is J.\n\nAfter move: head to P=(3,3), then B moves to A ( (2,3) ), C moves to B ( (2,2) ), D moves to C ( (3,2) ), E to D ( (4,2) ), F to E ( (5,2) ), G to F ( (6,2) ), H to G ( (6,3) ), I to H ( (5,3) ), J to I ( (4,3) ), and the tail was J, now moved to I, so J is vacated.\n\nBut P is (3,3), which was J, and J is moving to I, so (3,3) is now head, and the cell is not occupied by body anymore after move, so it should be ok, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if P is not the tail, it would be collision.\n\nIn this case, (3,3) is the tail, so moving to (3,3) is allowed.\n\nFrom (2,3), moving R to (3,3) is possible since it's the tail.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (1,3) is possible.\n\nMoving U to (2,4) impossible, wall.\n\nMoving D to (2,2) impossible, body collision.\n\nSo from (2,3), possible moves: L to (1,3) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf I go R to (3,3), new head (3,3), which was tail, so snake positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and tail moves to (5,3)? After move to (3,3): head (3,3), first body to (2,3), second to (2,2), third to (3,2), fourth to (4,2), fifth to (5,2), sixth to (6,2), seventh to (6,3), eighth to (5,3), ninth to (4,3), and the previous J (3,3) is now head, so tail is at (4,3).\n\nPositions: [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] tail at (4,3).\n\nNow, back to current turn 50, at (2,2), if I move down to (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), move D to (2,1).\n\nThen new positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), tail (3,4) moves to (3,3)? Current before move: head (2,2), body (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nMove head to (2,1): new head (2,1), then first body to (2,2), second to (3,2), third to (4,2), fourth to (5,2), fifth to (6,2), sixth to (6,3), seventh to (5,3), eighth to (4,3), ninth to (3,3), and tail (3,4) is removed, so new tail is (3,3).\n\nPositions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ] tail (3,3).\n\nFrom (2,1), possible moves: U to (2,2), but (2,2) is now body, collision, invalid.\n\nD to (2,0): y=0 is border wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,1): (1,1) not wall? Walls: x=0, y=0, etc. (1,1) not border, internal obstacles: (1,2) is wall, but (1,1) not listed, so free? Internal: (5,1), (6,1), etc, not (1,1), so free.\n\nR to (3,1): (3,1) not in snake, not wall? Internal obstacles include (5,1) and (6,1), but (3,1) not, so free.\n\nSo from (2,1), possible moves: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nNow, I need to think about reaching food.\n\nFood at (5,5) and (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is at y=6, x=3.\n\nFrom current position, moving up to (2,3) seems better to go towards (3,6), but (3,6) is at (3,6), and we have walls at (2,4), so from (2,3), I can go left or right, but not up.\n\nIf I go to (2,3), then I can go left to (1,3) or right to (3,3).\n\nIf I go right to (3,3), from (3,3) I can go up to (3,4), but (3,4) was the tail, but after move, it might be free or not.\n\nLet's plan a path to the food.\n\nFirst, (3,6) food: at (3,6), life span 9, so I have until turn 58 to eat it.\n\n(5,5) life span 7, must eat by turn 56.\n\nTurn 50 to 56 is 6 turns, so I need to eat (5,5) within 6 moves from now.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (5,5): Manhattan distance 6, but with obstacles.\n\nPath: from (2,2), if I go up to (2,3), then from (2,3) I can go right to (3,3), but (3,3) might be body, but as we saw, it can be moved to if tail.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,3) is possible.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go up to (3,4), but (3,4) was tail, but after moving to (3,3), the tail is at (4,3) or something? Let's simulate.\n\nAt turn 50, move U to (2,3).\n\nPositions: head (2,3), body (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail.\n\nNow turn 51, from (2,3), move R to (3,3).\n\nNew head (3,3), body: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and tail moves to (5,3)? After move: head (3,3), first body to (2,3), second to (2,2), third to (3,2), fourth to (4,2), fifth to (5,2), sixth to (6,2), seventh to (6,3), eighth to (5,3), ninth to (4,3), so tail at (4,3).\n\n(3,4) is now free.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move U to (3,4), which is free now.\n\nMove U to (3,4).\n\nNew head (3,4), body: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), tail at (4,3)? Positions: head (3,4), first body to (3,3), second to (2,3), third to (2,2), fourth to (3,2), fifth to (4,2), sixth to (5,2), seventh to (6,2), eighth to (6,3), ninth to (5,3), so tail at (5,3).\n\nNow at (3,4), I can move U to (3,5), or L to (2,4), but (2,4) is wall, invalid, or R to (4,4), or D to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, collision.\n\n(3,5) not occupied? Not in positions, not wall.\n\n(4,4) not occupied, not wall.\n\nWalls: (2,4) is wall, but (3,5) and (4,4) should be free.\n\nFrom (3,4), move U to (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,5), move U to (3,6), which is food.\n\nBut (3,6) is food, so if I move to (3,6), I eat it, snake grows.\n\nBut let's see how many turns: from turn 50: move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 51: move R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 52: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 53: move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 54: move U to (3,6) and eat food.\n\nSo on turn 54, eat (3,6) food.\n\nLife span of (3,6) is 9 on turn 50, so on turn 54, countdown 9-4=5, still available, yes.\n\nBut (5,5) has shorter life, must be eaten by turn 56.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) on turn 54, I can then go to (5,5), but from (3,6) to (5,5) is |5-3| + |5-6| =2+1=3 distance, so at least 3 moves, turn 55,56,57.\n\nTurn 55: from (3,6) to, say, (4,6) or (3,5) but (3,5) might be body, etc.\n\nAfter eating at (3,6) on turn 54, snake grows, so positions: when eat at (3,6), head moves to (3,6), body follows, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nAt turn 53, before eating, head at (3,5), positions: let's not simulate all, but after eating at (3,6), snake has 11 segments.\n\nThen from (3,6), I need to go to (5,5).\n\nPossible path: (3,6) to (4,6), then to (5,6), then to (5,5), but (5,6) to (5,5) down.\n\nBut are there obstacles? (5,6) not wall, (4,6) not wall.\n\nBut internal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, but (5,6) not.\n\n(5,5) is food.\n\nFrom (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,6) to (5,5), 3 moves.\n\nTurn 55: to (4,6), turn 56: to (5,6), turn 57: to (5,5) eat.\n\nBut (5,5) must be eaten by turn 56? Life span 7 on turn 50, so on turn 56, countdown: turn 50:7, 51:6, 52:5, 53:4, 54:3, 55:2, 56:1, so on turn 56 it can be eaten, countdown 1, after turn 56 it disappears, so on turn 56 it can be eaten.\n\nOn turn 57, it would be gone if countdown 0 after turn 56.\n\nTurn 56: countdown 1, can be eaten, then after eaten, countdown decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nOn turn 57, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nSo to eat (5,5), I need to be on that cell by turn 56 at latest.\n\nIn this plan, I eat on turn 57, which is too late for (5,5).\n\nTurn 57 is after turn 56, so on turn 57, (5,5) is gone if not eaten on turn 56.\n\nSo eating on turn 57 is not possible; must eat by turn 56.\n\nIn the path above, I arrive at (5,5) on turn 57, which is too late.\n\nSo I need to prioritize (5,5) first because of shorter life.\n\n(5,5) must be eaten within 6 moves (turns 50 to 56, inclusive? Turn 50 to 56 is 7 turns: 50,51,52,53,54,55,56.\n\nLife span 7 from turn 50, so available on turns 50 to 56 inclusive.\n\nI need to reach (5,5) by turn 56.\n\nFrom current position (2,2), to (5,5), distance 3 in x, 3 in y, so Manhattan 6.\n\nMinimum 6 moves, but with obstacles, might be more.\n\nDirect path: from (2,2) to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, cannot.\n\nFrom (2,2), up to (2,3), then right to (3,3), but as before, then to (4,3), but (4,3) is body? At turn 50, positions have (4,3).\n\nBut after moves, it changes.\n\nFrom (2,2), if I move down to (2,1), then to (3,1), then to (4,1), but (4,1) not wall? Walls: (5,1) and (6,1) are walls, but (4,1) not, so free.\n\nThen to (4,2), but (4,2) is body initially, but later.\n\nLet's find a path to (5,5) within 6 moves.\n\nOption 1: from (2,2) up to (2,3) - turn 50\n\nThen from (2,3) right to (3,3) - turn 51\n\nThen from (3,3) up to (3,4) - turn 52\n\nThen from (3,4) right to (4,4) - turn 53\n\nThen from (4,4) down to (4,3)? But (4,3) might be body, or up to (4,5), then to (5,5).\n\n(4,4) to (4,5) up, then to (5,5) right.\n\nBut (4,5) not occupied? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 52: head at (3,4)\n\nPositions: from earlier, after move to (3,4) on turn 52, head (3,4), body (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail at (5,3)? Earlier simulation.\n\nTurn 50: U to (2,3) - positions: head (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail\n\nTurn 51: R to (3,3) - head (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail\n\nTurn 52: U to (3,4) - head (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail\n\nNow from (3,4), move to (4,4) on turn 53: R to (4,4)\n\n(4,4) not occupied, not wall.\n\nNew head (4,4), body: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail\n\nThen turn 54: from (4,4) to (4,5) U to (4,5)\n\n(4,5) not occupied, not wall.\n\nNew head (4,5), body: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3) tail? Positions: head (4,5), first body to (4,4), second to (3,4), third to (3,3), fourth to (2,3), fifth to (2,2), sixth to (3,2), seventh to (4,2), eighth to (5,2), ninth to (6,2), tenth to (6,3), so tail at (6,3).\n\nThen turn 55: from (4,5) to (5,5) R to (5,5), eat food.\n\nOn turn 55, at (5,5), which is before turn 56, so possible.\n\nLife span: turn 55, countdown was 7 on turn 50, turn 55: 50:7,51:6,52:5,53:4,54:3,55:2, so on turn 55 countdown 2, can be eaten.\n\nThen turn 56: (5,5) still there with countdown 1? After eaten on turn 55, it's gone.\n\nBut we eat on turn 55.\n\nIn this path, I ate (5,5) on turn 55.\n\nBut I didn't get to (3,6) yet.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) has life span 9, so until turn 58.\n\nAfter eating at (5,5) on turn 55, head at (5,5), body extended.\n\nThen I need to go to (3,6), which is at (3,6), from (5,5).\n\n|3-5| + |6-5| = 2+1=3 distance.\n\nFor example, to (5,6), then (4,6), then (3,6).\n\n(5,6) not wall, (4,6) not wall.\n\nTurn 56: from (5,5) to (5,6) U to (5,6)\n\nBut (5,6) is free? Not occupied.\n\nThen turn 57: to (4,6) L to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 58: to (3,6) L to (3,6) eat.\n\nOn turn 58, countdown of (3,6): turn 50:9, 51:8, ..., 58:1, can be eaten.\n\nSo both foods eaten.\n\nBut in the first part, I moved up from (2,2) to (2,3) on turn 50.\n\nWhat about moving down first? Let's see if it's better.\n\nFrom (2,2), move down to (2,1) on turn 50.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\nTo go to (5,5), going down might not be efficient.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) to (3,1) on turn 51.\n\nThen to (4,1) on turn 52.\n\n(4,1) not wall.\n\nThen to (4,2), but (4,2) might be body, initially it is, but after moves.\n\nAfter turn 50: move D to (2,1), positions: head (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail at (3,3)? Earlier: after move down, head (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail.\n\nTurn 51: move R to (3,1), for example.\n\n(3,1) not occupied, not wall.\n\nNew head (3,1), body: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail? After move: head (3,1), first body to (2,1), second to (2,2), third to (3,2), fourth to (4,2), fifth to (5,2), sixth to (6,2), seventh to (6,3), eighth to (5,3), ninth to (4,3), so tail at (4,3).\n\nThen turn 52: from (3,1) to (4,1) R to (4,1)\n\nNew head (4,1), body: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail\n\n(4,1) is free.\n\nThen turn 53: from (4,1) to (4,2)? But (4,2) is occupied by body, fifth segment, so collision, cannot.\n\nMove up to (4,2) invalid.\n\nFrom (4,1), move U to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, collision.\n\nMove to (5,1)? But (5,1) is wall, invalid.\n\nMove to (3,1) but (3,1) is now body, collision.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2) occupied, invalid; D to (4,0) y=0 wall, invalid; L to (3,1) occupied, invalid; R to (5,1) wall, invalid.\n\nAll invalid? That can't be.\n\n(4,1) position: after turn 52, head at (4,1)\n\nBody: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail at (4,3)\n\nSo cells around (4,1): up (4,2) occupied, down (4,0) wall, left (3,1) occupied, right (5,1) wall.\n\nAll directions blocked? But that means the snake is trapped if it goes down.\n\nBut at (4,1), no possible moves? But that can't be right for the game, but in this state, yes.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (2,1) is dangerous because from there, going to (3,1) and then (4,1) leads to a dead end.\n\nIf from (2,1) I go left to (1,1), then I might be stuck in the corner.\n\nFor example, from (1,1), I can go to (1,2) but (1,2) is wall, or down to (1,0) wall, or up to (1,2) wall, or right to (2,1) which might be body.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo moving down initially is risky and not efficient for reaching food.\n\nTherefore, better to move up to (2,3) on turn 50.\n\nThen, as before, to reach (5,5) by turn 55.\n\nIn the path: turn 50: U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 51: R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 52: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 53: R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 54: U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 55: R to (5,5) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, after that, I can go to (3,6).\n\nAfter eating at (5,5) on turn 55, head at (5,5), snake has 11 segments.\n\nPositions: before eating, on turn 54, head at (4,5), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3) tail? From earlier simulation after turn 54.\n\nAfter turn 53: head at (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3) tail\n\nTurn 54: U to (4,5), so head (4,5), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) tail? Positions: head (4,5), first body to (4,4), second to (3,4), third to (3,3), fourth to (2,3), fifth to (2,2), sixth to (3,2), seventh to (4,2), eighth to (5,2), ninth to (6,2), tenth to (6,3), so tail at (6,3).\n\nThen turn 55: R to (5,5), eat, so head (5,5), body: (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), and tail stays or? When eat, the tail doesn't move, so new segment added, positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), and the previous tail (6,3) remains, so snake has segments: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)? When head moves to food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nStandard: when head moves to food, the head is on food, body moves as usual, but the tail doesn't advance, so length increases by one.\n\nSo positions: new head (5,5), then the previous head position becomes the neck, so (4,5) is first body, (4,4) second, (3,4) third, ..., down to (6,2) and (6,3) is still there, but since tail didn't move, (6,3) remains, and the new tail is (6,3) or?\n\nAfter moving to (5,5) and eating:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Body segments: the previous segments except the tail is not removed.\n\nPrevious positions before move: head (4,5), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), tail (6,3)\n\nAfter move to (5,5) and eat: head (5,5), then the body: (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), and the tail (6,3) remains, so now snake: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3) with 12 segments.\n\nTail at (6,3).\n\nNow from (5,5), I want to go to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), L to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, collision, invalid; D to (5,4) or R to (6,5) but (6,5) might be wall or free.\n\nWalls: (6,4) is wall, but (5,4) not, (5,6) not.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,6): not occupied, not wall.\n\n- D to (5,4): (5,4) not occupied? Not in positions, not wall.\n\n- L to (4,5): but (4,5) is body, second segment, collision.\n\n- R to (6,5): (6,5) not wall? Walls: (6,4) is wall, but (6,5) not listed, so free? Internal obstacles: (6,4) wall, but (6,5) not, so should be free.\n\nBut (6,5) might be near.\n\nAlso, direction: after moving R to (5,5), new direction is R.\n\nBut for next move, from (5,5), direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nCurrent head direction after turn 55 move to (5,5) is R, since moved right from (4,5).\n\nSo cannot move left to (4,5), which is body anyway.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), R to (6,5).\n\nNow to go to (3,6), best to go up to (5,6).\n\nTurn 56: U to (5,6)\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6), then L to (3,6).\n\nTurn 57: L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 58: L to (3,6) eat.\n\n(3,6) on turn 58, countdown 1, can be eaten.\n\nNow, are there any risks? For example, when moving to (3,6), is it safe?\n\nAlso, need to think about tail reward danger, but here no food under tail mentioned.\n\nFood is at (5,5) and (3,6), not under snake.\n\nNow, in the initial moves, I have a plan.\n\nBut on turn 50, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but since I need to think ahead, but the state might change with food disappearing, so I should output a sequence, but the food life span decreases, so I need to consider.\n\nSince I have a clear path, I can output turns 50 to 55 or so.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nTurn 50: move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 51: move R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 52: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 53: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 54: move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 55: move R to (5,5) eat\n\nThen for later, but I need to output for a few turns, probably starting from current.\n\nThe problem says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nSince turn t1=50, I need to output for turn 50, 51, 52, ... at least a few.\n\nBut in the sequence above, by turn 55 I eat (5,5), and then to (3,6) on 58.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 55 or more.\n\nBut let's see if I can include getting to (3,6).\n\nSince (3,6) has longer life, I could go there first, but earlier I thought (5,5) must be eaten sooner.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) first, from turn 50 to 54 as before: turn 50 U, 51 R, 52 U, 53 U to (3,5), 54 U to (3,6) eat.\n\nThen from (3,6) to (5,5), but (5,5) must be eaten by turn 56.\n\nFrom (3,6) on turn 54, to (5,5): possible moves turn 55: to (4,6) or (3,5) but (3,5) might be body after move.\n\nAfter eating at (3,6) on turn 54, positions: similar, head (3,6), body extended.\n\nThen to (4,6) on turn 55.\n\nThen to (5,6) on turn 56.\n\nThen to (5,5) on turn 57, but turn 57 (5,5) may be gone if not eaten on turn 56.\n\nTurn 56: from (5,6) I can move D to (5,5) directly.\n\nTurn 55: to (4,6)\n\nTurn 56: to (5,6)\n\nBut to (5,5) from (5,6) is down, on turn 57? No.\n\nAfter turn 54: eat at (3,6), head (3,6), etc.\n\nTurn 55: from (3,6) to (4,6) R to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 56: from (4,6) to (5,6) R to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 57: from (5,6) to (5,5) D to (5,5)\n\nBut on turn 57, (5,5) disappears after turn 56, so not available.\n\nIf on turn 56 I go directly to (5,5) from (4,6), but (4,6) to (5,5) is not adjacent directly; |5-4| + |5-6| =1+1=2, need two moves, e.g., to (5,6) then (5,5), but same as above.\n\nFrom (4,6), I can move down to (4,5), then to (5,5).\n\nTurn 56: from (4,6) to (4,5) D to (4,5)\n\nBut (4,5) may be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 55: at (4,6), head position.\n\nBut to reach (5,5) by turn 56, I need to be at (5,5) on turn 56.\n\nFrom (3,6) on turn 54, I can go to (4,5) or something.\n\nFrom (3,6) turn 54, move to (3,5) but (3,5) might be body, or to (4,6).\n\nThen to (4,5) on turn 55, then to (5,5) on turn 56.\n\nTurn 55: from (4,6) to (4,5) D to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 56: from (4,5) to (5,5) R to (5,5)\n\nYes, on turn 56.\n\nBut (4,5) on turn 55: is it free?\n\nIn the first path to (3,6), on turn 54 I am at (3,6), so turn 55: to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 56: to (4,5)? But (4,5) is not adjacent to (4,6); adjacent are (4,7) wall, (4,5) down, (3,6), (5,6).\n\nFrom (4,6) to (4,5) is down, yes.\n\n(4,5) should be free if not occupied.\n\nIn the positions after eating at (3,6), let's not simulate, but (4,5) is likely free.\n\nThen turn 56: from (4,5) to (5,5) right.\n\nSo possible, but it's tighter, and I have to go through (4,5) which might be risky if occupied, but in this case should be ok.\n\nBut the first plan to get (5,5) first is safer and gives more time.\n\nMoreover, in the down move, I had a dead end risk.\n\nSo better to go for (5,5) first via the up-right path.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nAlso, think about the tail reward danger, but no food under tail mentioned.\n\nFood at (5,5) and (3,6), not under snake.\n\nSo I think the plan is fine.\n\nNow, output for turns 50 to 55.\n\nBut turn 55 is eat, but I need to specify actions.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: R\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: R\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: R\n\nBut turn 55: R to (5,5)\n\nI can output more turns to show going to (3,6).\n\nFor example, turn 56: U to (5,6)\n\nTurn 57: L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 58: L to (3,6)\n\nBut the food life span might require, but (3,6) is eaten on 58.\n\nSince the answer might not need all, but to demonstrate thinking ahead.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 50, so up to turn 55 is 6 actions? Turns: 50,51,52,53,54,55 is 6 turns.\n\nt1 to t1+5 is 6 turns.\n\nt1=50, t1+1=51, ..., up to t1+5=55, that's 6 actions.\n\nBut thinking 5 turns ahead means considering up to turn 55 or so.\n\nI can output from turn 50 to 55.\n\nThen for (3,6), it can be handled later.\n\nBut to be complete, I can add.\n\nSince the state changes, but for now, output the sequence.\n\nIn the move to (3,3) on turn 51, it was the tail, but we moved to it, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 50: U (up)\n\nTurn 51: R (right)\n\nTurn 52: U (up)\n\nTurn 53: R (right)\n\nTurn 54: U (up)\n\nTurn 55: R (right) to eat (5,5)\n\nThen for future, but not necessary.\n\nTo think ahead for (3,6), but I think it's ok.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (4,5) on turn 54, then to (5,5) on turn 55.\n\nIn turn 54, from (4,4) to (4,5), up.\n\nThen turn 55 to (5,5) right.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 50: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: \\text{R} }\n\nBut turn 55 is included, which is t1+5.\n\nI could add turn 56: U, but not necessary.\n\nThe user might expect only for the immediate, but the instruction says to think ahead and output multiple turns.\n\nIn the example, it shows multiple.\n\nAlso, in this sequence, I eat (5,5) on turn 55, and (3,6) later.\n\nBut I should confirm if moving down initially could be better, but we saw it leads to dead end, so no.\n\nAnother path: from (2,2), go up to (2,3), then left to (1,3), but that might not help, and (1,3) is near wall, so probably worse.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (5,5) due to its shorter life span (must be eaten by turn 56) while also planning to eat the food at (3,6) later. The current snake head position is (2,2) with direction left. Moving down to (2,1) is risky as it can lead to a dead end near (4,1), trapping the snake. Moving up to (2,3) is safer and allows a path to both foods.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (5,5) has a life span of 7 on turn 50, so it must be eaten by turn 56 (countdown: 50:7, 51:6, ..., 56:1; disappears after turn 56).\n  - (3,6) has a life span of 9 on turn 50, so it must be eaten by turn 58 (countdown: 50:9, 51:8, ..., 58:1; disappears after turn 58).\n- **Path to (5,5)**: From (2,2), moving up to (2,3) avoids walls and body collisions. The path to (5,5) takes 5 moves: (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) → (3,4) → (4,4) → (4,5) → (5,5), reaching it on turn 55.\n- **Path to (3,6)**: After eating (5,5), the snake can head to (3,6) via (5,6) and (4,6), reaching it on turn 58, within its life span.\n- **Collision Risks**: \n  - Moving to (3,3) on turn 51 is safe as it is the tail segment (tail moves away).\n  - No food is under the snake's body, so tail reward danger is not a concern.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating both foods, the snake should navigate open areas to avoid walls and body collisions. The grid has internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), which are avoided in this plan.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 50-55):\n- **Turn 50**: Move U (up) to (2,3). This avoids the wall at (1,2) and body collisions, positioning the snake to approach (5,5).\n- **Turn 51**: Move R (right) to (3,3). This moves to the tail segment (safe) and progresses right.\n- **Turn 52**: Move U (up) to (3,4). This avoids the wall at (2,4) and continues toward (4,4).\n- **Turn 53**: Move R (right) to (4,4). This moves into open space, aligning for the approach to (5,5).\n- **Turn 54**: Move U (up) to (4,5). This positions the snake adjacent to (5,5).\n- **Turn 55**: Move R (right) to (5,5) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 11).\n\n### Beyond Turn 55 (for completeness):\n- **Turn 56**: Move U (up) to (5,6) to head toward (3,6).\n- **Turn 57**: Move L (left) to (4,6).\n- **Turn 58**: Move L (left) to (3,6) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 12).\n\nThis plan eats both foods safely, avoids all walls and collisions, and ensures survival. The actions for turns 50-55 are fixed based on the current state; turns beyond may adjust if new food spawns or risks emerge.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 50: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 51: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 52: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 53: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 54: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 55: \\text{R}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 51. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Snake positions: head at (2,3), then body segments at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (2,3) from (2,2) since the previous position was (2,2), and it moved up to (2,3).\n\nFood: one at (5,5) with life span 6 and value 1, so positive food. Another at (3,6) with life span 8 and value 1, also positive. Both are positive, no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. The snake can move Up, Down, Left, Right, but cannot reverse direction instantly. Since head direction is Up, I cannot move Down next because that would be reverse. So possible moves from (2,3) are Up, Left, or Right. Down is not allowed because it would be opposite to current Up direction.\n\nLet me sketch the grid to visualize. Grid is 8x8, coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (7,7) top-right? Usually in such games, (0,0) is top-left, but I need to confirm. The walls are given with x and y, and snake positions, so let's list all occupied cells.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nSo head at (2,3), tail at (3,3). Let's plot this.\n\nFirst, y-coordinates: from 0 to 7, but since walls at y=0 and y=7, rows 0 and 7 are walls. Similarly for x.\n\nAssume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? In the snake positions, head is (2,3), and previous was (2,2), and it moved Up to (2,3). If Up increases y, then (2,2) to (2,3) is moving up, so y increases upwards. So (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 top row.\n\nIn the list, (2,2) to (2,3) Up, so from lower y to higher y, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top. Similarly, x from left to right, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nBut walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow food: (5,5) and (3,6)\n\nLife span: (5,5) has life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is 51, so for food at (5,5), life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 51 + 5 = 56? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo at turn t, life span L, it will be gone by turn t + L - 1? Countdown at turn t is L, then turn t+1 it becomes L-1, ..., when countdown=1, it is present, then after that turn, it disappears.\n\nThe rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span N, it has N turns left including current. So it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N.\n\nFor (5,5), turn 51, life span 6, so present until turn 56 (since 51 to 56 inclusive is 6 turns: 51,52,53,54,55,56? 51 to 56 is 6 turns? Turn 51: countdown=6, turn 52:5, ..., turn 56:1, then after turn 56, it disappears, so not present on turn 57.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) life span 8, present from turn 51 to 58.\n\nNow snake head at (2,3), direction Up. Possible moves: Up to (2,4), Left to (1,3), Right to (3,3). Down to (2,2) is not possible because reverse, and also (2,2) is body, but since tail moves, it might be ok if not colliding, but reverse is forbidden anyway.\n\nCannot move opposite direction, so Down is invalid.\n\nNow, (3,3) is the tail, but in the positions, (3,3) is the last segment, tail. When snake moves, the tail moves forward, so if head moves to a cell, and tail leaves, it might be ok, but need to check for body collision.\n\nBody collision: if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves. But if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by body after move, it collides.\n\nStandard snake: when moving, head moves to new cell, then each segment moves to previous position, so the tail leaves its cell.\n\nSo, after move, the cell that was tail is now empty, and head is in new position.\n\nCollision if head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail, because tail will move away.\n\nAlso, if head moves to tail cell, and tail moves, it should be ok, as long as no other body part is there.\n\nIn this case, from (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (2,4): what is at (2,4)? Internal obstacle at (2,4)? Walls and obstacles: internal obstacles include (2,4), yes, (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so wall. Cannot move there.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)], so (2,4) is an obstacle, so (2,4) is blocked.\n\nLeft to (1,3): (1,3) is not listed as wall or obstacle. Walls are borders and internal, so (1,3) should be free, but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). So (1,3) not in list, so free, but need to check for walls.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. (1,3): x=1, y=3, not border, not internal obstacle (obstacles are (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2), so (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) is not listed, so should be free.\n\n(1,2) is obstacle, so (1,3) is above it, should be ok.\n\nRight to (3,3): (3,3) is the tail of the snake. Since tail will move, it might be ok to move there, as long as no other body part is there.\n\n(3,3) is the last segment, so when head moves to (3,3), and tail moves away, it should be fine, because the tail cell is vacated.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions. Snake: head (2,3), then segments: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). So (3,3) is tail.\n\nIf head moves right to (3,3), which is tail. After move, head is at (3,3), and the segment that was at (3,3) moves to where? The body moves: the segment behind head was (2,2), which moves to (2,3)? Let's think.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head goes to new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo positions: index 0: head (2,3)\n\nAfter move, new head position based on direction.\n\nThen, body segments: segment 1 moves to old position of segment 0, segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1, and so on, up to tail.\n\nFor example, if head moves to new cell, say new_head.\n\nThen segment 1 (which was at (2,2)) moves to where head was, (2,3).\n\nSegment 2 (was (3,2)) moves to where segment 1 was, (2,2).\n\nSegment 3 (was (4,2)) moves to (3,2).\n\nAnd so on, segment 9 (tail, was (3,3)) moves to where segment 8 was, which is (4,3)? Positions: let's index them.\n\nList: pos[0] = (2,3) head\n\npos[1] = (2,2)\n\npos[2] = (3,2)\n\npos[3] = (4,2)\n\npos[4] = (5,2)\n\npos[5] = (6,2)\n\npos[6] = (6,3)\n\npos[7] = (5,3)\n\npos[8] = (4,3)\n\npos[9] = (3,3) tail\n\nIf head moves to a new position, say new_pos.\n\nThen after move:\n\nnew head at new_pos\n\npos[1] moves to old pos[0] = (2,3)\n\npos[2] moves to old pos[1] = (2,2)\n\npos[3] moves to old pos[2] = (3,2)\n\n...\n\npos[9] moves to old pos[8] = (4,3)\n\nAnd old pos[9] is vacated.\n\nNow, for collision: when moving head to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it collides, because those segments don't move away immediately. But if it is the tail, and tail moves away, it should be ok.\n\nIn this case, (3,3) is tail. If head moves to (3,3), which is current tail position, then after move, head is at (3,3), and tail moves to (4,3), so no collision, since tail was there but left.\n\nMoreover, during the move, the cell is occupied, but since tail leaves, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, if head moves to a cell that is free, no issue.\n\nBut if head moves to a body cell, say if (3,3) was not tail but a middle segment, it would collide.\n\nHere, (3,3) is tail, so moving to it should be safe.\n\nAlso, food: if food is under tail, and head moves to it, it can be eaten, but with tail reward danger if adjacent and eating causes collision, but here not adjacent yet.\n\nFirst, let's list possible actions for turn 51.\n\nFrom (2,3), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: to (2,4) — but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid. Cannot move there.\n\n- Down: to (2,2) — but opposite direction, forbidden, and also (2,2) is body segment, so definitely invalid.\n\n- Left: to (1,3) — should be free, let's check.\n\n(1,3): not border, not internal obstacle (obstacles: (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2) — (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) is different cell, so free. Not occupied by snake, as per positions. So valid.\n\n- Right: to (3,3) — (3,3) is tail, so should be valid, as tail moves away.\n\nAlso, (3,3) is not food, I think. Food is at (5,5) and (3,6), not (3,3).\n\nSo possible actions: Left to (1,3) or Right to (3,3).\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead to maximize score.\n\nFood available: (5,5) with 6 turns left, (3,6) with 8 turns left.\n\nBoth are positive, value 1 each.\n\nSnake is long, 10 segments, so eating food increases length.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, tail is at (3,3), no food on it.\n\nFirst, let's plan for turn 51.\n\nIf I move Left to (1,3), head at (1,3), then direction becomes Left.\n\nThen body moves: segment at (2,2) moves to (2,3), etc., tail at (3,3) moves to (4,3).\n\nIf I move Right to (3,3), head at (3,3), then segment at (2,2) moves to (2,3), segment at (3,2) moves to (2,2), ..., tail at (3,3) moves to (4,3), but head is at (3,3), so after move, positions: head at (3,3), then body: pos[1] at old head (2,3), pos[2] at old pos[1] (2,2), etc., up to tail at old pos[8] (4,3).\n\nOld pos[8] is (4,3), so tail moves to (4,3).\n\nNow, from (1,3) or (3,3), I need to reach food.\n\nFood at (5,5) and (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is at x=3,y=6, which is closer in x, but y=6 is high, near top.\n\ny=7 is wall, so y=6 is row below top.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is at x=5,y=5.\n\nCurrent head (2,3), y=3.\n\nTo reach (3,6), I need to go up and right.\n\nTo reach (5,5), right and up.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nList all blocked cells.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) — but corners covered.\n\nAlso internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo blocked cells: borders and these points.\n\nNow, snake occupies: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nBut after move, some will change.\n\nFor planning, I should consider the grid state.\n\nAlso, food at (5,5) and (3,6), both free.\n\n(3,6) might be close, but let's see paths.\n\nFirst, for turn 51, I have two choices: Left or Right.\n\nIf I go Left to (1,3), then head at (1,3), direction Left.\n\nFrom there, I can go Up, Down, Left, but not Right (reverse).\n\n(1,3): x=1,y=3.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up to (1,4): is it free? (1,4) not wall, not obstacle (obstacles: (1,2) but (1,4) different), not snake? After move, snake positions will be: head at (1,3), body: (2,3) from old head, (2,2) from old pos[1], (3,2) from old pos[2], ..., up to tail at (4,3) from old pos[8].\n\nOld positions before move: head (2,3), pos[1] (2,2), pos[2] (3,2), ..., pos[9] (3,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (1,3):\n\nNew head: (1,3)\n\nThen body:\n\n- Segment 1: moves to old head (2,3)\n\n- Segment 2: moves to old pos[1] (2,2)\n\n- Segment 3: moves to old pos[2] (3,2)\n\n- Segment 4: moves to old pos[3] (4,2)\n\n- Segment 5: moves to old pos[4] (5,2)\n\n- Segment 6: moves to old pos[5] (6,2)\n\n- Segment 7: moves to old pos[6] (6,3)\n\n- Segment 8: moves to old pos[7] (5,3)\n\n- Segment 9: moves to old pos[8] (4,3)\n\nOld pos[8] was (4,3), so tail moves to (4,3)\n\nOld tail (3,3) is vacated.\n\nSo snake positions after moving Left: head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — tail at (4,3)\n\nNow, from (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (1,4): (1,4) should be free. Walls: not border, x=1 not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7. Obstacles: no (1,4) listed. Snake: not occupied, as above positions. So free.\n\n- Down to (1,2): but (1,2) is internal obstacle! Obstacles include (1,2), so wall, cannot move there.\n\n- Left to (0,3): x=0, which is border wall, cannot move.\n\n- Right to (2,3): but (2,3) is now occupied by body segment (the first body segment after head). After move, (2,3) has a body part, not tail, so if head moves to (2,3), it would collide with body.\n\nMoreover, direction: current direction after move is Left, so moving Right would be reverse, forbidden.\n\nSo from (1,3), only possible move is Up to (1,4).\n\nDown, Left, Right all invalid: Down to obstacle, Left to wall, Right reverse and to body.\n\nSo only Up.\n\nIf I go to (1,3), then next turn I must go Up to (1,4).\n\nThen from (1,4), direction Up.\n\nThen possible moves: Up to (1,5), Left to (0,5) wall, Right to (2,5), Down to (1,3) but reverse, forbidden.\n\n(1,4) to (1,5): (1,5) free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake? After previous, snake at (1,4) head, (1,3) body, (2,3), (2,2), etc., tail at (4,3)\n\n(1,5) should be free, so can go Up to (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, Right to (2,5) should be free.\n\nDown reverse, invalid.\n\nSo from (1,4), can go Up or Right.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; this is if I choose Left at turn 51.\n\nBut if I go Left, I'm forced to go Up next, to (1,4), and then I'm at top-left area, and food is at (5,5) and (3,6), which are bottom-right and top-middle.\n\n(1,4) is left side, y=4.\n\nTo reach food, I need to go right, but there might be obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's consider the other choice: at turn 51, move Right to (3,3).\n\nHead to (3,3), which is current tail.\n\nAfter move: new head at (3,3)\n\nThen body:\n\n- Segment 1 moves to old head (2,3)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to old pos[1] (2,2)\n\n- Segment 3 moves to old pos[2] (3,2)\n\n- Segment 4 moves to old pos[3] (4,2)\n\n- Segment 5 moves to old pos[4] (5,2)\n\n- Segment 6 moves to old pos[5] (6,2)\n\n- Segment 7 moves to old pos[6] (6,3)\n\n- Segment 8 moves to old pos[7] (5,3)\n\n- Segment 9 moves to old pos[8] (4,3)\n\nOld pos[8] was (4,3), so tail at (4,3)\n\nSnake: head (3,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — tail at (4,3)\n\nDirection: since moved Right to (3,3), direction is now Right.\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (3,4): free? (3,4) not wall, not obstacle (obstacles: (2,4) but (3,4) different), not snake? Positions: (3,3) head, (2,3) body, etc., (3,4) not occupied. So free.\n\n- Down to (3,2): (3,2) is body segment? After move, (3,2) is occupied by segment 3, which is body, not tail, so moving to (3,2) would collide. Also, current direction is Right, Down is not opposite? Directions: Right is horizontal, Down is vertical, not opposite directly, but the rule is \"no instant reverse\", meaning cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is Right (since moved right to (3,3)), so opposite would be Left. Down is perpendicular, not opposite, so should be allowed, but (3,2) is occupied by body.\n\n(3,2) is segment 3 in the list, which is body, so moving there causes collision.\n\n- Left to (2,3): (2,3) is now occupied by segment 1, body part, so collision. Also, Left is opposite to current Right direction, so forbidden anyway.\n\n- Right to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied by tail? After move, tail is at (4,3), so moving to (4,3) which is tail.\n\nSince it's tail, it might be safe.\n\n(4,3) is tail, so if head moves to (4,3), and tail moves away, should be ok.\n\nAlso, not reverse, since current direction Right, moving Right is same direction.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,3): Up to (3,4) or Right to (4,3).\n\nDown and Left invalid.\n\nNow, (4,3) has tail, which will move, so safe.\n\nBut is there food? No, food elsewhere.\n\nNow, food at (5,5) and (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is at x=3,y=6, so from (3,3), if I go Up to (3,4), then I can go further up to (3,5), (3,6) to eat the food at (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is food, and life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is at x=5,y=5, which is right and up from (3,3).\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (2,4), but (2,4) is not on the path directly.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (6,4), which might be near (5,5).\n\nNow, let's compare the two options for turn 51.\n\nOption 1: Move Left to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 52: must move Up to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 53: from (1,4), can move Up to (1,5) or Right to (2,5)\n\nIf I go to (1,5), then I can go to (1,6), but y=7 wall, so (1,6) is possible, then to (1,7) wall, so must turn.\n\nBut food at (3,6), so from (1,5), I can go Right to (2,5), then to (3,5), then to (3,6).\n\nBut need to check obstacles.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) free.\n\nFrom (1,4), if I go Right to (2,5)? From (1,4) to (2,5) is diagonal, not allowed, must move to adjacent cell, so from (1,4) can go to (1,5) Up or (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, or (1,3) Down but reverse invalid, or (0,4) Left wall.\n\nSo only Up to (1,5).\n\nAfter turn 52: head at (1,4) after moving Up from (1,3).\n\nTurn 53: from (1,4), move Up to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 54: from (1,5), direction Up, can go Up to (1,6), Left to (0,6) wall, Right to (2,5), Down to (1,4) reverse invalid.\n\nSo Up or Right.\n\n(1,6) is free, (2,5) is free.\n\nIf I go to (1,6), then I'm near top-left, and food at (3,6) is at top-middle, so I can go Right to (2,6), then to (3,6).\n\n(2,6) should be free, no obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, if from (1,5) I go Right to (2,5), then to (2,6), then to (3,6).\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) and (2,6) are different.\n\nNow, to reach (5,5) from there, it's farther, and there are obstacles like (5,1) but y=1 low, (6,4) near (5,5).\n\nBut let's first consider the other option.\n\nOption 2 for turn 51: Move Right to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 52: from (3,3), can go Up to (3,4) or Right to (4,3)\n\nIf I go Up to (3,4), then I can go directly to (3,6) for food.\n\nFrom (3,4), direction Up, can go Up to (3,5), then to (3,6).\n\n(3,5) and (3,6) should be free.\n\n(3,6) is food, so I can eat it on turn... let's count turns.\n\nTurn 51: move to (3,3)\n\nTurn 52: move Up to (3,4)\n\nTurn 53: move Up to (3,5)\n\nTurn 54: move Up to (3,6) and eat food.\n\nSince value 1, length increases.\n\nLife span of (3,6) is 8, from turn 51 to 58, so turn 54 is within, yes.\n\nIf I go Right to (4,3) on turn 52, then I can go to (5,3) or other, but (5,3) might be body or something.\n\nFirst, eating (3,6) seems easy and quick from this path.\n\nBut is there risk?\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn, I think.\n\nWhen eating food, the snake grows, so the tail stays, and a new segment is added.\n\nThe rule: when eating positive food, length increases by 1, so after move, head is on food, tail does not move, so the new position has head on food, and tail remains, so the snake is one segment longer.\n\nFor negative food, length unchanged, tail moves as usual.\n\nHere positive food.\n\nSo if I eat at (3,6) on turn 54, head moves to (3,6), eats, so tail does not move, snake grows to 11 segments.\n\nBut in this case, from (3,3), going up seems safe.\n\nBut let's check if (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) are accessible.\n\n(3,4): from above, when at (3,3), moving up to (3,4) should be free.\n\nThen (3,5): similarly, should be free, no obstacles.\n\n(3,6): food, free.\n\nAlso, no walls near.\n\ny=7 is wall, so (3,6) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for the other food (5,5), I can go after that.\n\nBut I need to think about the other choice.\n\nIf I go Left at turn 51, I end up at (1,5) by turn 53 or so, and then to (3,6) might take more turns, like turn 55 or later, but still within life span.\n\nBut (3,6) life span 8, turn 51 to 58, so turn 55 is fine, turn 54 also.\n\nBut with Left option, it takes more turns to reach food.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,5), life span 6, turn 51 to 56, so must eat by turn 56.\n\nIf I go Left, by turn 54 I might be at (1,6) or (2,6), then to (3,6) turn 55, eat.\n\nThen from there to (5,5), which is at (5,5), I need to go down and right, but y=5, x=5.\n\nFrom (3,6), to (4,6), (5,6), then down to (5,5), but (5,6) to (5,5) down.\n\nBut there might be obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but not on path.\n\n(5,5) itself might have issue, but should be free.\n\nBut life span: if I eat (3,6) on turn 55, then (5,5) must be eaten by turn 56.\n\nTurn 55: at (3,6) after eating.\n\nThen turn 56: move to, say, (4,6) or (3,5) or (2,6).\n\nThen to (5,5): from (4,6) to (5,6) to (5,5), or from (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) life span until turn 56, so I need to be on (5,5) on or before turn 56.\n\nTurn 56: if I move to (5,5) on turn 56, it should be ok, since countdown to 1 on turn 56, present, can eat.\n\nAfter turn 56, gone.\n\nSo possible, but tight.\n\nIf I go Right at turn 51, I can eat (3,6) by turn 54, then from (3,6) on turn 54, I can go to (4,6) turn 55, then to (5,6) turn 56, then down to (5,5) on turn 57? But turn 57, (5,5) is gone, since disappeared after turn 56.\n\nTurn 56: countdown=1, present, can be eaten on turn 56.\n\nTurn 57: gone.\n\nSo to eat (5,5), must be on turn 56.\n\nFrom (3,6) after turn 54 (eaten), on turn 55 I can move to (4,6), then turn 56 to (5,6) or directly to (5,5)? From (4,6) to (5,5) is diagonal, not adjacent, must move to (4,5), (5,6), or (3,6), etc.\n\nAdjacent cells: (4,6) can go to (4,5) down, (4,7) up but y=7 wall, (3,6) left, (5,6) right.\n\n(5,6) should be free? Not wall, not obstacle, obstacles are (6,4), etc., not (5,6).\n\nThen from (5,6), can go down to (5,5).\n\nBut on turn 56.\n\nSequence:\n\nAfter eating (3,6) on turn 54, head at (3,6), direction Up (since moved up).\n\nTurn 55: from (3,6), can move Left, Right, Down, not Up (reverse or wall? y=7 above, but (3,7) is wall, so cannot go up.\n\nSo can go Down to (3,5), Left to (2,6), Right to (4,6).\n\nSay go Right to (4,6), direction Right.\n\nTurn 56: from (4,6), can move Down to (4,5), Left to (3,6), Right to (5,6), Up to (4,7) wall.\n\nLeft to (3,6) might be body if snake there, but after moving, let's see positions.\n\nTo reach (5,5) on turn 56, I need to be at (5,5) on turn 56.\n\nFrom (4,6) on turn 56, I can move to (5,6) or (4,5), but not directly to (5,5).\n\nThen from there, on turn 57 to (5,5), but too late.\n\nUnless on turn 55 I go directly towards (5,5).\n\nFrom (3,6) on turn 55, instead of Right to (4,6), I go Down to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 56: from (3,5), can go Down to (3,4), Left to (2,5), Right to (4,5), Up to (3,6) reverse invalid.\n\nThen from (4,5) I can go to (5,5) on turn 57, but turn 57 food gone.\n\n(4,5) to (5,5) on turn 57, but (5,5) not present.\n\nTo be on (5,5) on turn 56, I need to be adjacent on turn 55.\n\nOn turn 55, if I am at (4,5), (5,6), (5,4), or (6,5), but (6,5) might be near obstacle.\n\n(5,6) is one possibility.\n\nFrom (3,6) on turn 55, if I go to (4,6), not (5,6).\n\nOr from (3,6) to (4,6) on turn 55, then on turn 56 to (5,6), but (5,6) not (5,5).\n\nThen turn 57 to (5,5) too late.\n\nIf from (3,6) on turn 55 I go to (4,5)? From (3,6) to (4,5) not adjacent, must move to adjacent cells.\n\n(3,6) to (4,6) or (3,5) or (2,6).\n\n(3,5) is down.\n\nThen from (3,5) on turn 56, I can go to (4,5), then turn 57 to (5,5) too late.\n\nNo way to reach (5,5) by turn 56 from (3,6) after turn 54, because it takes at least two moves: turn 55 to adjacent, turn 56 to (5,5), but turn 55 I am at (3,6), which is not adjacent to (5,5); (5,5) is two steps away.\n\n(3,6) to (5,5) is |dx|=2, |dy|=1, so min two moves, e.g., (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,5)? (4,6) to (5,5) is diagonal, not adjacent, so not possible in one move.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (5,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells share x or y same and differ by 1.\n\n(4,6) to (5,6) or (4,5) or (3,6) or (4,7).\n\n(5,5) is not adjacent to (4,6); it's diagonal.\n\nSo from (3,6), I need to go to (4,5) or (5,6) or (4,6) then to (5,5) in two moves.\n\nBut to be on (5,5) on turn 56, I need to move to it on turn 56.\n\nSo on turn 55, I must be at a cell adjacent to (5,5), like (5,6), (5,4), (4,5), (6,5).\n\n(6,5) might be near wall or obstacle.\n\nNow, from (3,6) on turn 55, I can go to (4,6), which is not adjacent to (5,5).\n\n(4,6) to (5,5) not adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,6) to (3,5) to (4,5), then (4,5) is adjacent to (5,5).\n\nBut (4,5) on turn 56, then move to (5,5) on turn 57.\n\nBut turn 57 too late for (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (4,6) on turn 55, then to (5,6) on turn 56, not (5,5).\n\nNo cell I can be on turn 55 from (3,6) that is adjacent to (5,5), except possibly if I move in a way, but (3,6) to (4,5) not possible directly.\n\nThe only adjacent cells to (5,5) are (5,6), (5,4), (4,5), (6,5).\n\nFrom (3,6), on turn 55, I can reach (4,6) or (3,5) or (2,6), none of which are adjacent to (5,5).\n\n(4,6) is not adjacent, (3,5) not, (2,6) not.\n\nSo it takes at least two moves from (3,6) to reach (5,5): e.g., (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,6) to (5,5), three moves? (3,6) to (4,6) one move, (4,6) to (5,6) another, (5,6) to (5,5) down, third move.\n\nOr (3,6) to (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5), also three moves.\n\nMinimum two moves if I could go directly, but not possible, so three moves from (3,6) to (5,5).\n\nThus, if I eat (3,6) on turn 54, I am at (3,6) on turn 54.\n\nTurn 55: move to say (4,6)\n\nTurn 56: move to (5,6)\n\nTurn 57: move to (5,5) but food gone.\n\nCannot eat (5,5) if I eat (3,6) first via this path.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,6) first, and go directly to (5,5).\n\nBack to turn 51.\n\nIf I move Right to (3,3) on turn 51.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go Right to (4,3) on turn 52, instead of Up.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can go towards (5,5).\n\n(4,3) to (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5), for example.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 51: move Right to (3,3)\n\nTurn 52: move Right to (4,3)  // since (4,3) is tail, safe\n\nAfter move, head at (4,3), direction Right.\n\nThen body: segment 1 at (3,3), segment 2 at (2,3), etc., tail at (5,3)? Positions after turn 51 move: head (3,3), body (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3) on turn 52: new head (4,3), then segment 1 moves to old head (3,3), segment 2 to old pos[1] (2,3), segment 3 to old pos[2] (2,2), ..., segment 9 to old pos[8] (5,3)? Old pos[8] was (5,3), so tail moves to (5,3)\n\nSnake: head (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail.\n\nNow from (4,3), can go Up to (4,4), Down to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied, collision, or Left to (3,3) body and reverse, invalid, or Right to (5,3) tail.\n\n(5,3) is tail, so moving to (5,3) should be safe.\n\nOr Up to (4,4) free.\n\nTo reach (5,5), from (4,3), go Up to (4,4) then Right to (5,4) then Up to (5,5).\n\nOr directly Right to (5,3) then Up to (5,4) then to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,3) is tail, moving to it.\n\nTurn 52: at (4,3)\n\nTurn 53: say move Up to (4,4)\n\nDirection Up.\n\nThen turn 54: from (4,4), can go Up to (4,5), Left to (3,4), Right to (5,4), Down to (4,3) reverse invalid.\n\n(4,5) free, (3,4) free, (5,4) but (5,4) might be near (6,4) obstacle, but (5,4) not obstacle.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), so (5,4) free.\n\nThen to (5,5): from (4,4) to (4,5) on turn 54, then to (5,5) on turn 55? (4,5) to (5,5) is right, adjacent.\n\n(4,5) to (5,5) is one move.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,4) to (5,4) on turn 54, then to (5,5) on turn 55.\n\nBut (5,5) life span to turn 56, so turn 55 is fine.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 53: move to (4,4)\n\nTurn 54: move to (4,5) or (5,4)\n\nSay (4,5)\n\nThen turn 55: move to (5,5) and eat.\n\nSince life span to turn 56, turn 55 is ok.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,4) on turn 54, then turn 55 to (5,5).\n\nNow, I can also eat the other food (3,6) after, since life span 8 to turn 58.\n\nBut let's see the first option where I go up to (3,6) quickly.\n\nIf at turn 51 I move Right to (3,3), then turn 52 move Up to (3,4), turn 53 to (3,5), turn 54 to (3,6) eat.\n\nThen on turn 55, I can move to, say, (4,6), then turn 56 to (5,6), turn 57 to (5,5) but (5,5) gone, so I miss (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is only +1, and I have (3,6) which I eat, so I get one food, but miss the other due to timing.\n\nIf I go directly to (5,5) as above, I eat it on turn 55, then I can go to (3,6) later.\n\n(3,6) life span to turn 58, so from (5,5) on turn 55, I can go to (5,6) or (4,5) or (6,5), then to (4,6) or (3,5), etc., to (3,6).\n\nFor example, turn 55: at (5,5) after eating, direction say Right if I came from left, but in the sequence, if from (4,5) to (5,5), direction Right.\n\nThen turn 56: from (5,5), can go Up to (5,6), Down to (5,4), Left to (4,5), Right to (6,5) but (6,5) near (6,4) obstacle? (6,5) not obstacle, but (6,4) is obstacle, so (6,5) should be free.\n\nBut to go to (3,6), I need to go left and up.\n\nSay go Left to (4,5), then to (3,5), then to (3,6).\n\nTurn 56: to (4,5)\n\nTurn 57: to (3,5)\n\nTurn 58: to (3,6) and eat, since life span to turn 58, present on turn 58.\n\nTurn 58 countdown=1, can be eaten.\n\nSo possible.\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nBut in the Left choice at turn 51, I might not be able to eat both, or it's tighter.\n\nFor example, if I go Left at turn 51 to (1,3), then turn 52 to (1,4), turn 53 to (1,5), turn 54 to (1,6) or (2,5).\n\nSay turn 54 to (2,5), then turn 55 to (3,5), turn 56 to (3,6) eat.\n\nThen (5,5) is gone, since turn 56 I eat (3,6), but (5,5) must be eaten by turn 56, but on turn 56 I am at (3,6), not at (5,5).\n\nIf from (1,5) on turn 54 I go to (2,5), same.\n\nCannot reach (5,5) from there in time.\n\nIf I go directly to (5,5) from left, but from (1,3) by turn 51, it takes many turns to reach (5,5).\n\nFor example, min path: (1,3) to (1,4) turn52, to (1,5) turn53, to (2,5) turn54, to (3,5) turn55, to (4,5) turn56, to (5,5) turn57 too late.\n\nOr shorter? (1,3) to (1,4) turn52, to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, cannot. Only up to (1,5), then to (2,5), etc. Cannot go right earlier because from (1,4) only up to (1,5), no right possible due to obstacle.\n\nFrom (1,4), only Up to (1,5), cannot go right because (2,4) obstacle.\n\nThen from (1,5), can go right to (2,5), then to (3,5), etc.\n\nSo min to (5,5) is from (1,5) to (2,5) to (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5), four moves, turn54 at (1,5), turn55 to (2,5), turn56 to (3,5), turn57 to (4,5), turn58 to (5,5), but (5,5) gone by turn57.\n\nTurn56 at (3,5), turn57 to (4,5), turn58 to (5,5) but (5,5) not present.\n\nAnd life span ends after turn56, so cannot eat (5,5) if I go left.\n\nMoreover, (3,6) I can eat later, but (5,5) missed.\n\nSo going Left at turn51 is bad because I might miss (5,5) and it takes longer to reach (3,6).\n\nWhereas going Right at turn51, I can eat (5,5) by turn55 and (3,6) by turn58.\n\nOr eat (3,6) by turn54 but miss (5,5), but since both +1, better to eat both if possible.\n\nEating both is better for score.\n\nSo from Right option, I can eat both.\n\nNow, back to the choice at (3,3).\n\nAt turn51, move Right to (3,3)\n\nThen for turn52, I need to choose to go Up or Right.\n\nIf I go Up, I can eat (3,6) fast but miss (5,5).\n\nIf I go Right, I can eat (5,5) and then (3,6).\n\nBut going Right to (4,3) on turn52.\n\nThen as before, to (4,4) or (5,3), etc.\n\nTo eat (5,5) by turn55.\n\nTurn51: to (3,3)\n\nTurn52: to (4,3)  // Right\n\nThen from (4,3), turn53: to (4,4) Up\n\nTurn54: to (4,5) Up\n\nTurn55: to (5,5) Right? (4,5) to (5,5) is Right, yes.\n\nEat on turn55.\n\nThen from (5,5), turn56: say to (5,6) Up\n\nTurn57: to (4,6) Left or (5,5) Down invalid, or (6,6) Right, but (6,6) might be ok, or to (5,7) wall.\n\n(5,6) to (4,6) Left or (5,5) Down reverse if direction up, or (6,6) Right or (5,7) Up wall.\n\nSay to (4,6) Left.\n\nThen turn57: to (3,6)? (4,6) to (3,6) Left.\n\n(3,6) is food, so eat on turn57.\n\nLife span to turn58, so turn57 ok.\n\nTurn58: present, can eat.\n\nSo eat on turn57.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly.\n\nBut on turn57, (3,6) still there.\n\nNow, if at turn52 from (3,3) I go Up to (3,4), then I eat (3,6) on turn54, but then (5,5) missed, and I get only one food.\n\nWhereas by going Right first, I can get both.\n\nMoreover, going Up might have another issue: tail reward danger or something, but not here.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (3,3) on turn51, it was tail, but after move, it's not tail anymore.\n\nIn the path to (3,6), it should be fine.\n\nBut to maximize, better to go for (5,5) first since shorter life span.\n\n(5,5) life span 6, (3,6) life span 8, so (5,5) more urgent.\n\nThus, from turn51, move Right to (3,3)\n\nThen turn52, move Right to (4,3) to go towards (5,5)\n\nThen turn53, move Up to (4,4)\n\nTurn54, move Up to (4,5)\n\nTurn55, move Right to (5,5) and eat.\n\nThen turn56, from (5,5), direction Right, can move Up to (5,6), Down to (5,4), Left to (4,5), Right to (6,5)\n\nNow, to go to (3,6), I can go Left to (4,5), but (4,5) might be body? After eating on turn55, head at (5,5), and since ate, tail didn't move, so positions: when eat at (5,5), head to (5,5), tail stays, so snake grows.\n\nBefore turn55 move, positions: after turn54, head at (4,5)? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn54: assume head at (4,5), after moving from (4,4) to (4,5) on turn54.\n\nBefore turn55 move: head at (4,5), body segments.\n\nBut after turn54 move to (4,5), positions depend.\n\nStart from turn51.\n\nTurn51: move from (2,3) to (3,3) Right.\n\nAfter: head (3,3), body (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\nTurn52: move to (4,3) Right.\n\nNew head (4,3), segment1 to old head (3,3), segment2 to (2,3), segment3 to (2,2), segment4 to (3,2), segment5 to (4,2), segment6 to (5,2), segment7 to (6,2), segment8 to (6,3), segment9 to (5,3) tail. // since old pos[8] is (5,3)? Old positions: pos[8] was (5,3), so segment9 moves to (5,3)\n\nList: after turn52 move: head (4,3), body: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail.\n\nTurn53: move Up to (4,4)\n\nNew head (4,4), segment1 to (4,3), segment2 to (3,3), segment3 to (2,3), segment4 to (2,2), segment5 to (3,2), segment6 to (4,2), segment7 to (5,2), segment8 to (6,2), segment9 to (6,3) tail. // segment9 to old pos[8] (6,3)? Old pos[8] was (6,3), yes.\n\nTurn54: move Up to (4,5)\n\nNew head (4,5), segment1 to (4,4), segment2 to (4,3), segment3 to (3,3), segment4 to (2,3), segment5 to (2,2), segment6 to (3,2), segment7 to (4,2), segment8 to (5,2), segment9 to (6,2) tail. // segment9 to old pos[8] (5,2)? Old positions before move: head (4,4), pos[1] (4,3), pos[2] (3,3), ..., up to pos[9] (6,3)\n\nAfter move to (4,5): head (4,5), segment1 to old head (4,4), segment2 to old pos[1] (4,3), segment3 to old pos[2] (3,3), segment4 to old pos[3] (2,3), segment5 to old pos[4] (2,2), segment6 to old pos[5] (3,2), segment7 to old pos[6] (4,2), segment8 to old pos[7] (5,2), segment9 to old pos[8] (6,2) tail.\n\nTurn55: move Right to (5,5) and eat food.\n\nSince eat, tail does not move, so new segment added.\n\nHead to (5,5), body: segment1 to old head (4,5), but since eat, the tail doesn't move, so the body segments move except tail stays.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, and the tail segment remains in place, so a new segment is added at tail.\n\nAfter move: head at (5,5), then body segments: the segment that was segment1 moves to where head was, so to (4,5), segment2 moves to where segment1 was, etc., and the tail stays, so the new tail is the old tail position.\n\nBefore move: head at (4,5), segments at (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,5) and eating:\n\n- Head at (5,5)\n\n- Segment 1 moves to old head (4,5)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to old segment1 (4,4)\n\n- Segment 3 moves to old segment2 (4,3)\n\n- Segment 4 moves to old segment3 (3,3)\n\n- Segment 5 moves to old segment4 (2,3)\n\n- Segment 6 moves to old segment5 (2,2)\n\n- Segment 7 moves to old segment6 (3,2)\n\n- Segment 8 moves to old segment7 (4,2)\n\n- Segment 9 moves to old segment8 (5,2)\n\n- And since ate, tail adds a new segment at old tail position (6,2), so segment 10 at (6,2)\n\nOld tail was (6,2), stays.\n\nSo snake now: head (5,5), then (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) tail.\n\nLength 11.\n\nNow direction: moved Right to (5,5), so direction Right.\n\nTurn56: from (5,5), can move Up to (5,6), Down to (5,4), Left to (4,5), Right to (6,5)\n\n(4,5) is now occupied by body segment, since in the list, (4,5) is segment1, so moving to (4,5) would collide.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) might be free, (5,6) free, (6,5) free.\n\nTo go to (3,6), I can go Up to (5,6)\n\nThen turn57: from (5,6) to (4,6) Left or (5,7) wall, (6,6) Right, Down to (5,5) reverse invalid.\n\nSay Left to (4,6)\n\nThen turn58: from (4,6) to (3,6) Left and eat.\n\n(3,6) life span 8, from turn51 to 58, so on turn58, countdown=1, present, can eat.\n\nEat on turn58.\n\nIf I go to (4,6) on turn57, then to (3,6) on turn58.\n\n(3,6) might be free; no issue.\n\nThus, I can eat both foods.\n\nIf at turn52 I had gone Up instead, I would get only one food.\n\nSo better to go Right at turn51 and then Right at turn52 to target (5,5).\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=51.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, etc.\n\nBut the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nAnswer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nAnd I should specify for how many turns? But it says \"...\" so probably until I have a plan, but since it's a sequence, I can output for several turns.\n\nIn this case, I have a plan for eating both.\n\nBut to be precise, for turn 51: move Right to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 52: move Right to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 53: move Up to (4,4)\n\nTurn 54: move Up to (4,5)\n\nTurn 55: move Right to (5,5) and eat.\n\nThen beyond, but I can stop or continue.\n\nSince the food at (3,6) is later, I can include up to there.\n\nBut for now, 5 turns: turns 51 to 55.\n\nt1=51, so turns 51,52,53,54,55.\n\nActions: 51: R (right), 52: R, 53: U (up), 54: U, 55: R.\n\nBut on turn 55, I move to (5,5) and eat.\n\nThen for survival, I need to avoid dying.\n\nAfter that, I can go to (3,6).\n\nBut in the answer, I think outputting 5 turns is fine.\n\nI should confirm if all moves are safe.\n\nFor example, at turn 51, moving to (3,3): (3,3) was tail, safe.\n\nTurn 52, to (4,3): (4,3) was tail at that time, after turn 51 move, tail was at (4,3), so moving to it safe.\n\nTurn 53, to (4,4): free, safe.\n\nTurn 54, to (4,5): free, safe.\n\nTurn 55, to (5,5): food, eat, safe.\n\nNo collisions or walls.\n\nThen I can continue to (3,6).\n\nBut for the response, output for turns 51 to 55.\n\nThe head direction changes, but I don't need to track for the answer, just the actions.\n\nIn the action, I need to specify U, D, L, R.\n\nAlso, for turn 51, moving Right, which is valid since not reverse; previous direction Up, Right is perpendicular.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow, what about the Left option? I think it's inferior, so not chosen.\n\nBut just to be thorough, if I had gone Left, I might get stuck and miss food.\n\nSo, the plan is to go Right at turn 51.\n\nThen for multiple turns, I have the sequence.\n\nIn the food, there is a point about food under body, but here no food under body, both foods are free.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger not applicable.\n\nSo, I think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive food items while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy prioritizes reaching the food at (5,5) first due to its shorter remaining life span (6 turns, disappearing after turn 56). The food at (3,6) has a longer life span (8 turns, disappearing after turn 58), allowing it to be eaten later. The snake must avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and its own body, and adhere to movement constraints (no instant reverse).\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Current State (Turn 51)**:\n  - Snake head at (2,3), direction Up.\n  - Possible moves from (2,3): Left to (1,3) or Right to (3,3) (Up to (2,4) is blocked by obstacle; Down is reverse and invalid).\n  - Moving Right to (3,3) is safe because (3,3) is the tail, which will move away.\n  - From (3,3), moving Right toward (5,5) is chosen to reach it quickly, as (5,5) must be eaten by turn 56.\n- **Food Life Spans**:\n  - (5,5): Life span 6 at turn 51, present until turn 56 (eaten on turn 55).\n  - (3,6): Life span 8 at turn 51, present until turn 58 (eaten later, not in this 5-turn plan).\n- **Path to (5,5)**:\n  - From (2,3), move Right to (3,3) on turn 51.\n  - Then Right to (4,3) on turn 52 (safe, as (4,3) is tail).\n  - Then Up to (4,4) on turn 53 (free cell).\n  - Then Up to (4,5) on turn 54 (free cell).\n  - Then Right to (5,5) on turn 55 to eat the food.\n- **Risks Avoided**:\n  - All moves are valid: no wall, obstacle, or body collisions.\n  - No instant reverse: e.g., from Up, moving Right is perpendicular, not reverse.\n  - Tail reward danger not applicable, as no food is under the tail initially.\n- **Beyond Turn 55**:\n  - After eating (5,5) on turn 55, the snake can proceed to (3,6) by moving Up to (5,6) on turn 56, Left to (4,6) on turn 57, and Left to (3,6) on turn 58 to eat it before it disappears.\n  - This ensures both foods are eaten, maximizing score (+2) with minimal risk.\n\n### Action Plan (Turns 51 to 55):\nThe sequence below is safe and achieves the immediate goal of eating (5,5) by turn 55. It includes 5 turns of actions (turns 51 to 55) as required.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 51: R (right)  \nTurn 52: R (right)  \nTurn 53: U (up)  \nTurn 54: U (up)  \nTurn 55: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 52, and I'm controlling the snake. The grid has walls and obstacles, and there's food with values and life spans.\n\n**Grid Size:** From the walls, it says border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), so it's an 8x8 grid. Walls are at the borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I need to avoid these cells.\n\n**Snake Positions:** The snake is a list of positions: head at (3,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). So the head is at (3,3), and the tail is at (4,3). Let me plot this to visualize.\n\nList of snake segments:\n- Index 0: (3,3) - head\n- Index 1: (2,3)\n- Index 2: (2,2)\n- Index 3: (3,2)\n- Index 4: (4,2)\n- Index 5: (5,2)\n- Index 6: (6,2)\n- Index 7: (6,3)\n- Index 8: (5,3)\n- Index 9: (4,3) - tail\n\nThe head is at (3,3), and the current direction is R, which is right. So moving right would go to (4,3), but (4,3) is the tail, which is segment 9.\n\n**Food:**\n- (5,5) with value 1, life span 5\n- (3,6) with value 1, life span 7\n- (5,3) with value 1, life span 10\n\nThe food is given as (x, y, life_span, value), but in the input, it's written as (5,5,5,1), which I think means (x=5, y=5, life_span=5, value=1). Similarly, (3,6,7,1) is (x=3,y=6, life_span=7, value=1), and (5,3,10,1) is (x=5,y=3, life_span=10, value=1).\n\nNow, (5,3) is a food position, but (5,3) is also occupied by the snake! Segment 8 is (5,3), and there's food there. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\nSo for (5,3), it's under segment 8. To eat it, segment 8 needs to move away, and then the head moves to (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, other food at (5,5) and (3,6).\n\nLife spans: for (5,5), life_span=5, which decreases each turn, including current turn. Current turn is 52, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning it lasts until turn 56? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn including current.\n\nSo at turn t, life_span L, it will be gone by turn t + L. After turn t + L - 1, it disappears? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, the food has life_span L, then at the end of the turn, after movement, if head is on it, it's eaten. Then life_span decreases by 1 for the next turn. So if life_span is 5 at turn 52, after turn 52, it decreases to 4, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears before the next turn.\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nLet me read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"after N turns\" might mean after N more turns.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life_span N, then after turn t, it becomes N-1, and so on. When it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nSo for food at (5,5) with life_span 5 at turn 52:\n\n- After turn 52, life_span becomes 4\n\n- After turn 53, becomes 3\n\n- After turn 54, becomes 2\n\n- After turn 55, becomes 1\n\n- After turn 56, becomes 0, disappears, so not available on turn 57.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) with life_span 7: available until after turn 58 (since 52+7-1=58? Let's calculate:\n\nTurn 52: life_span 7\n\nAfter turn 52: life_span 6\n\nAfter turn 53: 5\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 58: life_span 0, disappears, so not on turn 59.\n\n(5,3) with life_span 10: available until after turn 61.\n\nNow, the food at (5,3) is under the snake body, segment 8.\n\nTo eat it, the snake must move such that segment 8 moves away, and then head moves to (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) is currently occupied, so it can't be eaten now.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,3), direction R (right).\n\nPossible moves: since current direction is R, I can move U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left. I can move U, D, or R.\n\nNow, let's see what each move would do:\n\n- Move R (right): to (4,3). But (4,3) is the tail, segment 9. Since the tail will move, it might be safe to move there, as long as after movement, the head doesn't collide with body except the tail which moves.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (4,3) should be safe, because after moving, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\n- Move U (up): to (3,4)\n\n- Move D (down): to (3,2)\n\nBut (3,2) is segment 3, which is body, not tail. Segment positions: (3,3) head, (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), etc. So (3,2) is segment 3, which is body. If I move down to (3,2), I collide with body, die.\n\nSimilarly, moving left is not allowed.\n\nSo possible safe moves from (3,3):\n\n- R to (4,3): tail, should be safe\n\n- U to (3,4): let's check if that cell is free or wall or obstacle.\n\nGrid: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,4) is within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). None at (3,4), so should be free.\n\n- D to (3,2): but (3,2) is segment 3, body, so collision, not safe.\n\n- L to (2,3): but (2,3) is segment 1, body, collision, and also instant reverse? Current direction R, moving left is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo only possible safe moves: R to (4,3) or U to (3,4).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's see the food.\n\nFood at (5,5): value +1, life_span 5, so must be eaten by turn 56 at latest, but since life span decreases, it might disappear earlier if not eaten.\n\nTurn 52: life_span 5, so after this turn, if not eaten, it becomes 4, etc. To eat it, head must be on (5,5) when life_span >0.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) life_span 7, eat by turn 58.\n\n(5,3) life_span 10, eat by turn 61, but it's under body now.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (4,3), and no food there, I think. Food at (5,3), which is segment 8, not tail.\n\nTail is (4,3), no food.\n\nNow, if I move R to (4,3), that's the tail, so after move, head is at (4,3), tail was at (4,3), but since we move, the tail moves to the next segment. Let's simulate.\n\nCurrent snake: positions from head to tail: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nIf I move R to (4,3):\n\n- Head moves to (4,3)\n\n- But (4,3) was tail, so after movement, the new tail should be the second last segment, which is (5,3)? Let's see how snake moves.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo if head moves to (4,3), which was previously occupied by tail.\n\nThe new positions:\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 1: was (2,3) but now moves to head's old position (3,3)\n\n- Segment 2: was (2,2) moves to segment 1 old position (2,3)\n\n- Segment 3: was (3,2) moves to segment 2 old (2,2)\n\n- Segment 4: (4,2) moves to segment 3 old (3,2)\n\n- Segment 5: (5,2) moves to segment 4 old (4,2)\n\n- Segment 6: (6,2) moves to segment 5 old (5,2)\n\n- Segment 7: (6,3) moves to segment 6 old (6,2)\n\n- Segment 8: (5,3) moves to segment 7 old (6,3)\n\n- Segment 9: (4,3) was tail, but head moved here, so it becomes part of body, and tail is now segment 8's new position? Let's list new positions.\n\nAfter moving right to (4,3):\n\n- New head: (4,3)  // this was the old tail position\n\n- New segment 1: old head position (3,3)\n\n- New segment 2: old segment 1 position (2,3)\n\n- New segment 3: old segment 2 position (2,2)\n\n- New segment 4: old segment 3 position (3,2)\n\n- New segment 5: old segment 4 position (4,2)\n\n- New segment 6: old segment 5 position (5,2)\n\n- New segment 7: old segment 6 position (6,2)\n\n- New segment 8: old segment 7 position (6,3)\n\n- New segment 9: old segment 8 position (5,3)  // this is the new tail\n\nSo new tail is at (5,3)\n\nNow, there is food at (5,3), which is now the new tail position? (5,3) has food, and it's the tail.\n\nBut the head is now at (4,3), which is adjacent to tail at (5,3)? (4,3) and (5,3) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nHead at (4,3), tail at (5,3), so they are adjacent.\n\nNow, if I eat the food at (5,3), which is the tail, but according to tail reward danger: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nHere, head is adjacent to tail, and tail has positive food (since value=1), so if I move to eat it, I die.\n\nSpecifically, if I move to (5,3), which is the tail, but after moving, when I eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head collides with the new tail position or something.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, after moving to (5,3), I eat the food, so the snake grows, meaning the tail stays where it is, so the head moves to (5,3), which was tail, and tail remains at (5,3) for that moment, so head and tail same cell, collision.\n\nThen new segment added, but collision happens.\n\nSo yes, dangerous.\n\nTherefore, if I move to (4,3) now, head is at (4,3), tail at (5,3), adjacent, and (5,3) has food, so I cannot eat it directly; it would kill me.\n\nBut I don't have to eat it now; I can avoid moving to it.\n\nIn the current move, if I move R to (4,3), I don't eat any food; I just move to a position that was tail, but no food eaten since no food at (4,3). Food is at (5,3), which is now the tail.\n\nAfter move, head at (4,3), tail at (5,3), with food on tail.\n\nNow, from here, if I move to (5,3), I die because of tail reward danger.\n\nI could move away.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; first, for current turn, move R to (4,3) is safe in terms of no collision, but it puts me adjacent to food on tail, which is dangerous if I try to eat.\n\nBut I don't have to eat it; I can leave it.\n\nNow, other option: move U to (3,4).\n\nThen head to (3,4), which should be free.\n\nNew positions:\n\nHead: (3,4)\n\nSegment 1: (3,3) old head\n\nSegment 2: (2,3) old seg1\n\nSegment 3: (2,2) old seg2\n\nSegment 4: (3,2) old seg3\n\nSegment 5: (4,2) old seg4\n\nSegment 6: (5,2) old seg5\n\nSegment 7: (6,2) old seg6\n\nSegment 8: (6,3) old seg7\n\nSegment 9: (5,3) old seg8, now tail\n\nTail at (5,3), with food.\n\nHead at (3,4), not adjacent to tail (5,3); (3,4) to (5,3) is not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,4) neighbors are (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4). (5,3) is at distance, so not adjacent.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting food.\n\nFood at (5,5), life_span 5, so must be eaten soon.\n\n(3,6) life_span 7, a bit more time.\n\n(5,3) life_span 10, plenty of time, but it's under body, so I need to free it up.\n\nCurrently, (5,3) is occupied by segment 8, which is not tail yet.\n\nAfter any move, if I move in a way that the body moves away from (5,3), it might become free.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (3,4), then as above, segment 8 moves to (6,3), and tail is at (5,3), so (5,3) is now tail with food.\n\nIf I move R to (4,3), segment 8 moves to (6,3), tail to (5,3), same thing.\n\nIn both cases, after one move, (5,3) becomes the tail with food.\n\nBecause segment 8 was at (5,3), after move, it moves to where segment 7 was, so (5,3) is vacated, but then tail moves to it? Let's see.\n\nIn the move simulation, when snake moves, the segment that was at (5,3) moves to (6,3) if I move U or R, so (5,3) is left, but immediately, the tail is shortened or something? No.\n\nIn the new positions, after move, the position (5,3) is now occupied by the new tail, which is the old segment 8 position only if it doesn't move, but it does move.\n\nIn the U move case:\n\nOld positions: head (3,3), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (2,2), seg3 (3,2), seg4 (4,2), seg5 (5,2), seg6 (6,2), seg7 (6,3), seg8 (5,3), seg9 (4,3)\n\nAfter move U to (3,4):\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nNew seg1: old head (3,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (2,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (2,2)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (3,2)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (4,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (5,2)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (6,2)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (6,3)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (5,3)  // new tail at (5,3)\n\nSo (5,3) is now tail with food.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (4,3):\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nNew seg1: (3,3)\n\nNew seg2: (2,3)\n\nNew seg3: (2,2)\n\nNew seg4: (3,2)\n\nNew seg5: (4,2)\n\nNew seg6: (5,2)\n\nNew seg7: (6,2)\n\nNew seg8: (6,3)\n\nNew seg9: (5,3)  // tail at (5,3) with food\n\nSo in both cases, after this turn, the food at (5,3) is on the tail cell.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move the head to (5,3) when it's not the tail or when it's free, but since it's tail, and if head is adjacent, it's dangerous.\n\nCurrently, if I move U to (3,4), head is at (3,4), tail at (5,3), not adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move to different directions.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (5,5) first, which has short life.\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5, which is not occupied, and life_span 5.\n\nFrom current position (3,3), to reach (5,5), I need to go right and up.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), then I'm at (3,4), closer to (3,6) but (3,6) has longer life.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), so from (3,4), I can go right to (4,4), then to (5,4), then up to (5,5), or something.\n\nBut I need to avoid obstacles and walls.\n\nAlso, the snake body.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls at borders, so cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls, cannot go there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the bottom row from x=2 to 6, y=2 and y=3.\n\nSpecifically, segments: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nSo it's like a snake that went down from (3,3) to (3,2), then right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then left to (4,3), and head at (3,3).\n\nNow, free cells: I need to find path to food.\n\nFood at (5,5): free, I think.\n\n(3,6): free.\n\n(5,3): occupied.\n\nAfter one move, (5,3) will be tail with food.\n\nNow, for (5,5), life_span 5, so I have about 5 turns to eat it.\n\nCurrent turn 52, after this turn, life_span 4, so I need to eat it by turn 56.\n\nTurn 52: if I don't eat, life_span decreases to 4 after turn.\n\nAfter turn 52, it becomes 4, meaning 4 turns left including the current one? Let's clarify the life_span decrease.\n\nI think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, food has life_span L. After the turn, if not eaten, L decreases by 1. When L=0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nSo for (5,5) at turn 52, L=5. If not eaten on turn 52, after turn 52, L=4. If not eaten on turn 53, L=3, and so on. If not eaten by turn 56, after turn 56, L=0, disappears, so cannot be eaten on turn 57.\n\nTo eat it, I must have head at (5,5) on one of turns 52,53,54,55,56.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, turn 52, I can move U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), then on turn 53, I can try to go towards (5,5).\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) will be body after move, so collision if I go down, L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\n(2,4) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (2,4) is listed, yes, (2,4) is an obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n\nSo (2,4) is obstacle, cannot move there.\n\nFrom (3,4), after moving there on turn 52.\n\nOn turn 53, head at (3,4), direction? After moving U, new direction is U, so current direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, segment 1, collision, not safe. L to (2,4) obstacle, not possible. R to (4,4).\n\nSo only possible safe moves from (3,4) are U to (3,5) or R to (4,4).\n\nIf I go U to (3,5), then I can go to (3,6) to eat food there, but (3,6) has food with life_span 7, so more time.\n\nOr go R to (4,4), then towards (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 52 I move R to (4,3), then head at (4,3), with tail at (5,3) with food.\n\nFrom (4,3), current direction after move is R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, segment 5 or something, let's see new positions after move R.\n\nAfter move R to (4,3), snake: head (4,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (2,2), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (5,2), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (5,3)\n\nSo cells occupied: (4,3) head, (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail.\n\nFrom head at (4,3), possible moves:\n\nU to (4,4): should be free, no obstacle.\n\nD to (4,2): but (4,2) is occupied by segment 5, body, collision.\n\nL to (3,3): occupied by segment 1, body, collision, and also instant reverse? Current direction R, moving left is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nR to (5,3): but (5,3) is tail with food, and head adjacent (since (4,3) and (5,3) are adjacent), so if I move to (5,3), I eat the food, but tail reward danger: head adjacent to tail and tail has food, so eating it kills me.\n\nSo moving R to (5,3) is deadly.\n\nTherefore, from (4,3), only possible safe move is U to (4,4).\n\nSo if I move R on turn 52, on turn 53 I must move U to (4,4), no choice.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go to (5,4) or (4,5), etc.\n\nBut I have the food at (5,5) to eat soon.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,3) on tail, I need to eat it later without danger.\n\nFirst, let's plan to eat (5,5) within 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 52.\n\nOption 1: Move U on turn 52 to (3,4)\n\nThen on turn 53, from (3,4), I can:\n\n- Move U to (3,5)\n\n- Or move R to (4,4)\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), then from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) to eat food there, since (3,6) has food.\n\n(3,6) life_span 7, so I can eat it now, but (5,5) has shorter life, so maybe prioritize (5,5).\n\nIf I move R to (4,4) on turn 53, then from (4,4), I can move R to (5,4) on turn 54, then U to (5,5) on turn 55 to eat.\n\nTurn 55, life_span of (5,5) would be: after turn 52, if not eaten, L=4; after turn 53, L=3; after turn 54, L=2; on turn 55, L=2, so if I eat on turn 55, it's ok.\n\nSimilarly, I could go directly.\n\nFrom (3,4) on turn 53, if I move R to (4,4), then turn 54 move to (5,4), turn 55 to (5,5).\n\n(5,4) is free? Let's check.\n\nCurrent obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (5,4) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free.\n\nNow, when I move to (5,4) on turn 54, is it safe?\n\nOn turn 54, snake positions depend on previous moves.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nTurn 52: move U to (3,4)\n\nSnake after turn 52: head (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (2,2), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (5,2), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (5,3) tail with food.\n\nTurn 53: move R to (4,4)\n\nHead to (4,4)\n\nNew seg1: (3,4) old head\n\nNew seg2: (3,3) old seg1\n\nNew seg3: (2,3) old seg2\n\nNew seg4: (2,2) old seg3\n\nNew seg5: (3,2) old seg4\n\nNew seg6: (4,2) old seg5\n\nNew seg7: (5,2) old seg6\n\nNew seg8: (6,2) old seg7\n\nNew seg9: (6,3) old seg8? Let's list:\n\nOld positions turn 52 end: head (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (2,2), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (5,2), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (5,3)\n\nAfter move R to (4,4):\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nNew seg1: old head (3,4)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (3,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (2,3)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (2,2)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (3,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (4,2)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (5,2)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (6,2)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (6,3)  // new tail at (6,3)\n\nFood at (5,3) is still there, but not on tail; tail is at (6,3).\n\n(5,3) is now free? No, after move, the cell (5,3) is no longer occupied, because old seg9 (5,3) is removed, and new tail is (6,3).\n\nIn the new positions, (5,3) is not in the list, so it should be free, and food is there.\n\nYes! So after turn 53, food at (5,3) is free and can be eaten.\n\nBut we are going to (5,5).\n\nTurn 53: head at (4,4)\n\nTurn 54: move to (5,4)\n\nFrom (4,4), current direction after move R? Turn 53 move was R to (4,4), so direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nNow, (4,3) is seg1, body, collision if move down.\n\n(3,4) is seg1? New positions: head (4,4), seg1 (3,4), so (3,4) is body, so moving L to (3,4) is collision and also instant reverse? Current direction R, moving left is opposite, not allowed.\n\nD to (4,3): (4,3) is not occupied? Seg1 is (3,4), seg2 (3,3), etc. (4,3) not in positions, so should be free, but is it safe?\n\nAfter turn 53, positions: head (4,4), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (2,3), seg4 (2,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (4,2), seg7 (5,2), seg8 (6,2), seg9 (6,3)\n\nSo cells occupied: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)\n\n(4,3) is not occupied, and no obstacle, so it is free.\n\nBut if I move D to (4,3), that would be down, but current direction is R, so moving down is not opposite; opposite is left. So I can move U, D, or R.\n\nMoving D to (4,3) is possible and safe, since free.\n\nSimilarly, U to (4,5) free, R to (5,4) free.\n\nL to (3,4) not possible, occupied and reverse.\n\nSo on turn 54 from (4,4), I can move U, D, or R.\n\nBut we want to go to (5,5), so move R to (5,4).\n\nThen head to (5,4)\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (3,3), etc.\n\nNow, (5,4) is not obstacle, free.\n\nTurn 55: from (5,4), move U to (5,5) to eat the food.\n\n(5,5) has food, so eat, snake grows.\n\nNow, is (5,5) safe? Yes, free.\n\nAnd life_span: on turn 55, at start, L= ? Turn 52 start L=5, after turn 52 not eaten L=4, after turn 53 not eaten L=3, after turn 54 not eaten L=2, on turn 55 start L=2, so can eat.\n\nAfter eating, snake length increases.\n\nNow, what about the other food?\n\nBut first, back to turn 52 decision.\n\nIf I move U on turn 52, I can reach (5,5) by turn 55.\n\nNow, if on turn 52 I move R to (4,3), then as before, on turn 53 I must move U to (4,4).\n\nThen from (4,4) on turn 54, I can move R to (5,4), then turn 55 to (5,5), same thing.\n\nBut when I move R on turn 52, I go to (4,3), which is safe, but then on turn 53 I have to move U, and I might have the tail food at (5,3).\n\nAfter move R on turn 52, snake: head (4,3), tail (5,3) with food.\n\nThen turn 53 move U to (4,4), then head at (4,4), tail at (6,3)? After move U to (4,4):\n\nOld positions: head (4,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (2,2), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (5,2), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (5,3)\n\nMove U to (4,4):\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nNew seg1: old head (4,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (3,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (2,3)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (2,2)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (3,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (4,2)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (5,2)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (6,2)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (6,3)  // tail at (6,3)\n\nFood at (5,3) is now free, since not occupied.\n\nThen on turn 54, from (4,4), I can move R to (5,4), then turn 55 to (5,5).\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut in this case, when I moved R on turn 52, I didn't eat any food, and the food at (5,3) became free earlier.\n\nIn the first option, when I moved U on turn 52, after turn 53, (5,3) became free.\n\nIn both cases, by turn 53 or so, (5,3) is free.\n\nBut in the move U path, after turn 53, (5,3) is free; in move R path, after turn 53, (5,3) is free.\n\nNow, for the food at (3,6), I can eat it later.\n\nBut I need to think about risks and long-term.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (5,5) on turn 55, the snake grows, so it gets longer.\n\nNow, the food at (3,6) can be eaten, life_span 7, so by turn 58.\n\n(5,3) life_span 10, by turn 61.\n\nBut I should avoid getting stuck.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger for (5,3) when it was on tail.\n\nBut now it's free.\n\nCurrently, on turn 52, if I move U, I go to (3,4), which is closer to (3,6).\n\nIf I move R, I go to (4,3), closer to (5,5).\n\nBut both can reach (5,5) in time.\n\nNow, let's consider the (3,6) food.\n\nIf on turn 52 I move U to (3,4), then on turn 53 I could move U to (3,5), then turn 54 to (3,6) to eat it.\n\nBut (3,6) life_span 7, so I can eat it on turn 54, which is fine, but (5,5) might expire if I don't eat it soon.\n\nIf I eat (3,6) on turn 54, then on turn 55 I can go to (5,5), but from (3,6) to (5,5) might take more turns.\n\nFrom (3,6), to go to (5,5), I need to go right and down.\n\nBut (4,6) might be free, but (5,6) then (5,5), but (5,6) is y=6, not border, x=5, should be free if no obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles none at (4,6) or (5,6).\n\nBut (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,6) to (5,5).\n\nOn turn 54, if head at (3,6), then turn 55 to (4,6), turn 56 to (5,6), turn 57 to (5,5), but on turn 57, (5,5) is gone, since after turn 56 it disappears if not eaten.\n\nTurn 52: L=5\n\nAfter turn 52: L=4\n\nAfter turn 53: L=3\n\nAfter turn 54: L=2\n\nAfter turn 55: L=1\n\nAfter turn 56: L=0, disappears, so cannot eat on turn 57.\n\nLast chance to eat is turn 56.\n\nIf on turn 56 I am at (5,6), I can move to (5,5) only if adjacent and move, but (5,6) to (5,5) is down, which is adjacent.\n\nOn turn 56, if head at (5,6), move D to (5,5) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 56, L=1 at start, so if I eat, ok.\n\nBut can I reach (5,6) by turn 56?\n\nSuppose turn 52: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 53: move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 54: move U to (3,6) eat food? (3,6) has food, so if I move to (3,6) on turn 54, I eat it, then snake grows.\n\nThen on turn 55, head at (3,6), I can move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 56: move R to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 57: but (5,5) gone, cannot eat.\n\nOn turn 56, from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5) if I am at (5,6) on turn 56.\n\nTurn 55: from (3,6) after eating, I move to (4,6) on turn 55.\n\nTurn 56: from (4,6) move to (5,6)\n\nThen on turn 56, head at (5,6), I can move down to (5,5) to eat.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), and on turn 56, it should be present.\n\nAfter turn 55, if not eaten, L decreases to ? Turn 55 start L=1 (since after turn 54 L=2, after turn 55 not eaten L=1? Let's track:\n\nTurn 52 start: L=5 for (5,5)\n\nAfter turn 52 not eaten: L=4\n\nAfter turn 53 not eaten: L=3\n\nAfter turn 54 not eaten: L=2\n\nAfter turn 55 not eaten: L=1\n\nOn turn 56 start: L=1, so if I eat on turn 56, it's ok.\n\nAfter turn 56, if eaten, fine; if not, L=0, disappears.\n\nSo on turn 56, I can eat at (5,5) from (5,6) by moving down.\n\nIn this path:\n\nTurn 52: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 53: U to (3,5)  // not eating (3,6) yet\n\nI said turn 54 to (3,6), but I can delay eating (3,6).\n\nTo reach (5,5) on turn 56.\n\nFrom (3,4) on turn 53, instead of U, I can move R to (4,4) as before, then to (5,4) on turn 54, to (5,5) on turn 55.\n\nThat is better, eating (5,5) earlier.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (3,6) first, I might not reach (5,5) in time if I eat on turn 54.\n\nBut if I go to (3,6) on turn 54, I eat it, then on turn 55 to (4,6), turn 56 to (5,6), and move to (5,5) on turn 56 to eat, but when I move to (5,5) on turn 56, I eat (5,5), but (5,5) is still there.\n\nBut the snake is at (5,6) on turn 56, move to (5,5), which is fine.\n\nBut in terms of turns, it works, but I eat two foods, but (5,5) on the last possible turn, which is riskier if something goes wrong.\n\nWhereas going directly to (5,5) via (4,4) and (5,4) is safer and earlier.\n\nNow back to turn 52 choice.\n\nIf I move U on turn 52, I can go to (5,5) by turn 55 with move R on turn 53.\n\nIf I move R on turn 52, I can also go to (5,5) by turn 55.\n\nBut moving R on turn 52 might be better because I free the food at (5,3) immediately, but in both cases it gets freed by turn 53.\n\nAnother point: when I move R to (4,3) on turn 52, I am adjacent to the tail with food, but I don't eat it, I move away, so no problem.\n\nThen on turn 53 I move U to (4,4), and (5,3) is free.\n\nNow, I can eat (5,3) later.\n\nBut (5,3) has long life, so no rush.\n\nThe food at (3,6) I can eat after (5,5).\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,5), the snake is longer, and I need to navigate.\n\nMoreover, there is an obstacle at (6,4), which is near (5,5).\n\n(6,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go there.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from turn t1.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many turns.\n\nProbably I need to output a sequence of actions for the next few turns, but since it's a game, I might not know all future, but I can plan a path.\n\nThe user says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but in the answer, I need to specify actions for the current turn and possibly future turns.\n\nLooking at the answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nBut it doesn't say how many. I think I should output for the immediate turns, say 3-5 turns, based on the plan.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, and there are multiple foods, I should eat them when possible.\n\nNow, on turn 52, if I move U to (3,4), I can then on turn 53 move to (3,5) or (4,4).\n\nIf I move to (4,4) on turn 53, I go towards (5,5).\n\nI could on turn 53 move to (3,5) to go to (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) has longer life, so I can do it after.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is free after turn 53.\n\nAnother idea: since (5,3) is food and now free, I can eat it on the way.\n\nBut let's decide turn 52 action.\n\nI think moving U or R both can work, but moving U might be better because it opens up the top area, while moving R keeps me low.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), then I have access to (3,6) directly.\n\nIf I move R to (4,3), I am at (4,3), which is closer to (5,5).\n\nBut both are similar.\n\nI should consider the tail reward danger for (5,3) if it comes up.\n\nBut since it's free now, I can eat it when head is not adjacent to tail.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 52, I choose to move U, to go towards (3,6) or (5,5).\n\nTo be safe for (5,5), let's go with moving R on turn 52 to (4,3), then U to (4,4) on turn 53, then R to (5,4) on turn 54, then U to (5,5) on turn 55 to eat.\n\nOn turn 55, eat (5,5), snake grows.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,6) or to (5,3).\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), life_span 7, so by turn 58.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move L to (4,5) or D to (5,4), but (5,4) might be body after move, etc.\n\nBut I can plan later.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is at (5,3), from (5,5) I can move down to (5,4), then to (5,3), but (5,4) might be occupied.\n\nAfter eating (5,5) on turn 55, snake has new segment.\n\nTurn 55: move to (5,5) and eat, so new head at (5,5), and tail does not move, new segment added at tail? When you eat, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place for that turn.\n\nRule: when eating, the snake grows, so the tail does not move that turn.\n\nSo after eating, the position where you ate is new head, and the body follows, tail remains.\n\nIn this case, on turn 55, move to (5,5), eat, so new positions: head (5,5), then previous head position, etc., and tail same as before since growth.\n\nBefore turn 55, let's say on turn 54 end, snake positions.\n\nAssume we are at (5,4) on turn 54 end.\n\nFrom earlier path with move R on turn 52.\n\nTurn 52: move R to (4,3)\n\nAfter: head (4,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (2,2), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (5,2), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (5,3) tail\n\nTurn 53: move U to (4,4)\n\nAfter: head (4,4), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (2,3), seg4 (2,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (4,2), seg7 (5,2), seg8 (6,2), seg9 (6,3) tail\n\nFood at (5,3) free.\n\nTurn 54: move R to (5,4)\n\nHead to (5,4)\n\nNew seg1: (4,4)\n\nNew seg2: (4,3)\n\nNew seg3: (3,3)\n\nNew seg4: (2,3)\n\nNew seg5: (2,2)\n\nNew seg6: (3,2)\n\nNew seg7: (4,2)\n\nNew seg8: (5,2)\n\nNew seg9: (6,2) tail\n\nNow, (5,3) is still free with food.\n\nTurn 55: move U to (5,5) and eat.\n\nSince eating, snake grows, so new positions: head (5,5), then seg1 (5,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (3,3), seg5 (2,3), seg6 (2,2), seg7 (3,2), seg8 (4,2), seg9 (5,2), and new segment at tail, so tail at (5,2)? When growing, the tail stays, so the new tail is the old tail position.\n\nAfter move to (5,5) and eat, head is (5,5), then the body is the previous head and body, so seg1 is previous head (5,4), seg2 is previous seg1 (4,4), ..., up to seg9 previous seg8 (5,2), and since grow, we add a new segment at the previous tail position, which was (6,2), so new segment 10 at (6,2), but the tail is the new segment, so positions: head (5,5), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (3,3), seg5 (2,3), seg6 (2,2), seg7 (3,2), seg8 (4,2), seg9 (5,2), seg10 (6,2) tail.\n\nNow, food at (5,3) is still there.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move to eat (5,3) or go to (3,6).\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3), which is adjacent down from (5,4), but (5,4) is seg1, body.\n\nHead at (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\nBut (5,4) is seg1, body, collision if move down.\n\n(4,5) might be free, (5,6) free, (6,5) but (6,5) is x=6, not border, but (6,4) is obstacle, (6,5) not listed, so free.\n\nBut (6,5) is free.\n\nCurrent direction after move U to (5,5), so direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4) but occupied, not safe, L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\nInstant reverse: current U, opposite is D, which is not allowed anyway.\n\nSo can move U, L, or R.\n\nTo eat (5,3), I need to go down, but (5,4) is occupied, so I cannot go directly to (5,3) from (5,5); I need to go around.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,5), then down to (4,4), but (4,4) is seg2, body.\n\nPositions: (4,4) is seg2, occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is free, then from (4,5) I can move D to (4,4) but occupied, or L to (3,5), etc.\n\nIt might take time to reach (5,3).\n\nSince (5,3) has long life, I can go to (3,6) first.\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), from (5,5) I can move L to (4,5), then to (3,5), then to (3,6).\n\n(3,5) should be free.\n\nLife_span of (3,6): turn 52 start L=7, after turn 52 L=6, after 53 L=5, after 54 L=4, after 55 L=3, so on turn 56, L=3, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) L=10, after turn 55 L=5 or so.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nFor turn 52, I think moving R or U are both ok, but since the head direction is R, moving R might be more straightforward.\n\nI could move U to be closer to (3,6).\n\nBut to be safe for (5,5), let's go with move R on turn 52.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nThe user says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but in answer, output actions for turns.\n\nPerhaps I can output for turns 52 to 55 or so.\n\nSince after turn 55, it depends.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan turns 52 to 55.\n\nTurn 52: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 53: move U to (4,4)  // only choice\n\nTurn 54: move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 55: move U to (5,5) to eat\n\nBut on turn 54, from (4,4), I could move U to (4,5) instead of R to (5,4), but that delays (5,5), not good.\n\nSo better to go to (5,4).\n\nIf I moved U on turn 52, same thing.\n\nBut let's confirm with move U on turn 52.\n\nTurn 52: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 53: move R to (4,4)  // from (3,4), move R to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 54: move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 55: move U to (5,5)\n\nSame as above.\n\nIn this case, on turn 53, I have the option to move U to (3,5) to go to (3,6), but I choose not to, to prioritize (5,5).\n\nNow, for the food at (5,3), after turn 53, it is free, so I could eat it on turn 54 if possible.\n\nIn the move U path: after turn 53, with move R to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), etc., tail (6,3), and (5,3) free.\n\nOn turn 54, from (4,4), I can move to (5,4) or to (4,3) or (4,5).\n\n(4,3) is free, as earlier.\n\nIf I move to (4,3) on turn 54, then I can eat the food at (5,3) on turn 55 if I move R, but let's see.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 54, move D to (4,3)\n\nThen head to (4,3)\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (3,3), etc.\n\n(4,3) was free, so safe.\n\nThen on turn 55, from (4,3), I can move R to (5,3) to eat the food.\n\n(5,3) is adjacent, and no tail danger since tail is at (6,3) or something, not adjacent.\n\nAfter move to (4,3) on turn 54, positions: head (4,3), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (3,3), seg4 (2,3), seg5 (2,2), seg6 (3,2), seg7 (4,2), seg8 (5,2), seg9 (6,2) or depending.\n\nAfter turn 53 end: with move U on 52 and R on 53, positions: head (4,4), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (2,3), seg4 (2,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (4,2), seg7 (5,2), seg8 (6,2), seg9 (6,3)\n\nTurn 54 move D to (4,3):\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head (4,4)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (3,4)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (3,3)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (2,3)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (2,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (3,2)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (4,2)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (5,2)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (6,2)  // tail at (6,2)\n\n(5,3) is free with food.\n\nTurn 55: move R to (5,3) to eat.\n\nHead to (5,3), eat, grow.\n\nThen snake longer.\n\nBut I missed (5,5), which might expire.\n\nOn turn 55, (5,5) L=2 or 1, still available, but I am at (5,3), not at (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,3), to go to (5,5), I need to go up, but (5,4) might be occupied.\n\nAfter eating at (5,3), head at (5,3), then I can move U to (5,4), but (5,4) is seg1? After move to (5,3) and eat, positions: head (5,3), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (3,4), etc., and new tail at (6,2) or something.\n\nBut (5,4) is not necessarily occupied, but it might be part of body.\n\nIn this case, from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4) if free, but after the move, let's not simulate.\n\nPoint is, if I eat (5,3) on turn 55, I might not reach (5,5) on turn 56, since from (5,3) to (5,5) is two moves, to (5,4) then (5,5), but on turn 56, if I go to (5,4), (5,5) might be eaten on turn 56.\n\nBut it's tight.\n\nBetter to eat (5,5) first since short life.\n\nTherefore, for turn 52, I should move in a way to prioritize (5,5).\n\nSo either move U or R on turn 52, then go directly to (5,5) by turn 55.\n\nI think move R on turn 52 is fine.\n\nThen for the answer, I'll output turns 52 to 55.\n\nBut the user might expect the action for turn 52 only, but the format shows multiple turns.\n\nSince the state is given for turn t1, and I need to output actions starting from t1.\n\nIn the core rules, it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan ahead.\n\nFor the sequence, let's output 4 turns: 52 to 55.\n\nTurn 52: R\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: R\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nIn move R on 52, turn 53 must be U, then turn 54 R to (5,4), turn 55 U to (5,5).\n\nYes.\n\nIf I move U on 52, turn 53 R to (4,4), turn 54 R to (5,4), turn 55 U to (5,5), same actions except turn 52 U instead of R.\n\nBut in turn 52, with direction R, moving U is also possible.\n\nI think either is ok, but let's choose move R for turn 52 to keep the direction.\n\nNow, for the food at (3,6), after that, I can go to it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) can be eaten later.\n\nBut for now, I'll output the actions.\n\nThe answer should be in the boxed format.\n\nAlso, for turn 56, I can move to (4,5) or something, but not necessary.\n\nSince the food at (5,3) is free after turn 53, I could eat it on turn 54 if I go there, but that might delay (5,5), so not good.\n\nSo I think the plan is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned the next 5 turns (turns 52 to 56) ahead, prioritizing eating the positive food at (5,5) due to its short life span (5 at turn 52, decreasing each turn). The food at (5,5) must be eaten by turn 56 at the latest, as it disappears after turn 56. The food at (3,6) has a longer life span (7 at turn 52), so it can be targeted after securing (5,5). The food at (5,3) is currently under the snake's body but will become free after turn 52; however, eating it now would risk missing (5,5) and is less urgent due to its long life span (10 at turn 52).\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Current State (Turn 52):** Snake head at (3,3) with direction R. Possible safe moves: R (to (4,3), tail position) or U (to (3,4), free cell). Moving R is chosen to start a path toward (5,5) efficiently and free the food at (5,3) immediately.\n- **Path to (5,5):** The sequence (4,3) → (4,4) → (5,4) → (5,5) allows eating (5,5) on turn 55, well within its life span. Moving to (5,5) earlier reduces risk.\n- **Avoiding Risks:** \n  - No instant reverse is allowed (current direction R, so L is forbidden).\n  - Wall and obstacle avoidance: Borders (x=0,7; y=0,7) and internal obstacles [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)] are avoided in the path.\n  - Tail reward danger: After turn 52, (5,3) becomes the tail with food. Moving to (5,3) while adjacent would cause death, so it is avoided until the snake is not adjacent and the path is clear.\n- **Long-Term Survival:** After eating (5,5), the snake grows, and the plan sets up access to (3,6) and (5,3) for future turns, ensuring the grid remains navigable without dead ends.\n\n### Turn-by-Turn Plan:\n- **Turn 52:** Move R to (4,3). This is safe (moving to tail position, which vacates), frees the food at (5,3), and positions the snake closer to (5,5). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 53:** Move U to (4,4). This is the only safe move from (4,3) (D and R are unsafe or deadly, L is instant reverse). Direction becomes U, and (5,3) is now free.\n- **Turn 54:** Move R to (5,4). From (4,4), moving R is safe and efficient for reaching (5,5). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 55:** Move U to (5,5) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases). This is safe and within the food's life span (life span 2 at turn 55 start). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 56:** From (5,5), possible moves include L to (4,5) to start heading toward (3,6), which has life span 3 at turn 56 start (eatable by turn 58). This move is safe and avoids body collisions.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Efficiency:** Eats (5,5) on turn 55 with minimal risk.\n- **Risk Mitigation:** Avoids tail reward danger at (5,3) by not moving adjacent when the tail has food. The path also avoids all obstacles and walls.\n- **Future Flexibility:** After turn 55, the snake can target (3,6) or (5,3) easily, with the grid open for navigation.\n\n**Actions for Turns 52 to 56:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 52: R (right)  \nTurn 53: U (up)  \nTurn 54: R (right)  \nTurn 55: U (up)  \nTurn 56: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 53. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I should avoid these cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is right (R), meaning it's moving east.\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (5,5) with value 1, life span 4 (so it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn 53, so it'll be gone by turn 57)\n\n- At (3,6) with value 1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 58)\n\n- At (5,3) with value 1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 61)\n\nAll food has value 1, so positive food.\n\nNow, the food at (5,3) is interesting because it's under the snake's body. Specifically, looking at snake positions, (5,3) is the tail segment. The snake positions are: head (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), and tail (5,3). So (5,3) is the last position, which is the tail.\n\nThere's food at (5,3), which is the tail cell. But according to the rules, food can be under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the tail grows and causes a collision.\n\nCurrently, the head is at (4,3), and tail is at (5,3). Are they adjacent? (4,3) and (5,3) are adjacent horizontally. Since the head is moving right, from (4,3) to (5,3) would be moving onto the tail cell.\n\nBut the tail is at (5,3), and if the head moves to (5,3), that would be moving onto the tail. However, since the snake moves, the tail will also move, so it might be safe if the tail moves away.\n\nStandard snake behavior: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves from its position, so if the head moves to the current tail position, it should be okay because the tail leaves that cell. But there's a food there, and if eaten, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nLet's clarify the movement.\n\nNormally, without food: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its cell.\n\nWith food: if head eats food, head moves to food cell, a new segment is added at the end, so tail stays, and the snake grows by one.\n\nIn this case, if the head moves to (5,3), which has food, and it's the current tail, then:\n\n- Head moves to (5,3), eats food.\n\n- Since food is eaten, the snake grows, so a new tail is added at (5,3), but since it's already there, the tail doesn't move. Effectively, the tail segment stays, and a new segment is added, so the snake becomes longer.\n\nBut the head is now at (5,3), which was the previous tail position. After eating, the tail is still at (5,3) or what?\n\nLet's think: before move, positions: [ (4,3), (3,3), ..., (6,3), (5,3) ] head at (4,3), tail at (5,3).\n\nAfter moving head to (5,3):\n\n- Head moves to (5,3), which has food, so food is eaten.\n\n- Since food is eaten, the snake grows, so we add a new segment. The tail doesn't move; instead, we keep the tail where it is and add a new segment at the end. But the tail is currently at (5,3), and we're adding a new segment, so the new tail should be at (5,3), and the segment before that becomes part of body.\n\nStandard snake growth: when food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move; thus, a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail position remains, and the snake length increases by one.\n\nIn this case: before move, tail is at (5,3).\n\nHead moves to (5,3), eats food.\n\nThen, since food eaten, tail stays at (5,3), and we add a new segment at (5,3)? That doesn't make sense because (5,3) is now the head position.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me denote the positions: let S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T] where H is head, T is tail.\n\nAfter move without food: H moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, so B1 moves to H's old position, B2 to B1's old, ..., T moves to the position of the second last segment, and the old T position is vacated.\n\nWith food: if H moves to a cell with food, then H moves to food cell, but the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the end, so the new snake has positions: [new H, old H, B1, B2, ..., T] and T remains, so the tail is still T at its position, and a new segment is added after T? No.\n\nTypically: positions before: P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n\nAfter moving to a cell without food: new positions: [new_head, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}], so tail was Pk, now P_{k-1} is new tail, and Pk is vacated.\n\nAfter moving to a cell with food: new positions: [new_head, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk], so Pk remains, and a new segment is added at the end, so the tail is now Pk, and it didn't move; the snake has one more segment.\n\nIn this case, for food at tail:\n\nBefore move: positions: P0 = head (4,3), P1 = (3,3), ..., P9 = tail (5,3)\n\nIf head moves to (5,3), which is food and current tail position.\n\nAfter move: new head is (5,3), then P0 (4,3) becomes first body, then P1 (3,3), ..., up to P9 (5,3) which is now the last body, and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the end. But P9 is (5,3), so new segment at (5,3)? But (5,3) is now occupied by head? No.\n\nPositions after move:\n\n- New head: (5,3)\n\n- Then the previous positions: P0 (4,3) becomes first body, P1 (3,3) becomes second body, ..., P9 (5,3) becomes the last body segment.\n\nP9 is (5,3), which is the same as new head? That can't be; positions must be unique.\n\nI think there's a mistake.\n\nWhen the head moves to a cell, it's a new position. If that cell had the tail, but the tail is moving away unless food is eaten.\n\nIn this case, (5,3) is the tail position, and if head moves there, and it has food, then:\n\n- The head moves to (5,3)\n\n- Since food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the segment at (5,3) remains, but now it's not the tail anymore; it's the second last segment.\n\nLet's list the positions:\n\nBefore move: index 0: (4,3) head, 1: (3,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (5,2), 7: (6,2), 8: (6,3), 9: (5,3) tail\n\nHead moves to (5,3), which is the position of index 9.\n\nAfter move with food eaten:\n\n- New head: (5,3)\n\n- Then the body: previous head at (4,3) becomes first body\n\n- Previous body 1 at (3,3) becomes second body\n\n- ...\n- Previous body 8 at (6,3) becomes ninth body? Let's see the sequence.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Position 0 (new head): (5,3)\n\n- Position 1: previous position 0, which is (4,3)\n\n- Position 2: previous position 1, (3,3)\n\n- Position 3: previous position 2, (2,3)\n\n- Position 4: previous position 3, (2,2)\n\n- Position 5: previous position 4, (3,2)\n\n- Position 6: previous position 5, (4,2)\n\n- Position 7: previous position 6, (5,2)\n\n- Position 8: previous position 7, (6,2)\n\n- Position 9: previous position 8, (6,3)\n\n- Position 10: previous position 9, (5,3) but since food is eaten, we add a new segment at the end, so position 10 is at the previous tail position, which is (5,3)\n\nBut position 0 is also (5,3), so we have two segments at (5,3), which is a collision. That's the problem.\n\nSo, if the head moves to the current tail position and eats food, it causes the head and the new tail to be at the same position, resulting in collision.\n\nThe rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, head at (4,3), tail at (5,3), they are adjacent, and tail cell has food, so if head moves to (5,3), it will eat the food and cause collision.\n\nTherefore, moving to (5,3) is deadly and must be avoided.\n\nNow, back to the current state.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction right. So possible moves: since current direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L (opposite).\n\nCannot move opposite, so from R, I can go U, D, or R, not L.\n\nNow, grid is 8x8 with borders and obstacles.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo let's list occupied cells by snake:\n\n(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nFood at: (5,5), (3,6), (5,3) but (5,3) is occupied by snake tail.\n\nFood at (5,3) is on the tail cell.\n\nNow, for the head at (4,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up (U): to (4,4)\n\n- Down (D): to (4,2)\n\n- Right (R): to (5,3)\n\nBut (4,2) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (4,2) is position 5 in the list, which is a body segment, not head or tail, so it's occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is tail, but with food.\n\n(4,4) is free? Let's see what cells are occupied or walls.\n\nFirst, walls: borders and obstacles.\n\n(4,4): x=4,y=4, not border, not in obstacles list: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (4,4) is clear.\n\nIs it occupied by snake? Snake: (4,3), (3,3), etc., no (4,4), so (4,4) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2): is occupied by snake, position (4,2), which is body, so cannot move there, collision.\n\n(5,3): is occupied by tail with food, but moving there would cause death due to Tail Reward Danger.\n\nTherefore, from (4,3), moving U to (4,4) is possible, moving D to (4,2) is not possible (body collision), moving R to (5,3) is not possible (deadly due to food on tail), and moving L is not allowed because current direction is R, cannot reverse to L.\n\nCannot move L because it would be opposite direction.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (4,4).\n\nIs that right? Let me confirm.\n\nCurrent head direction: R, meaning it was moving right to (4,3) from previous position. Previous head position was, let's see the positions: snake positions list is head first, so before this, head was at (3,3)? Positions: [(4,3) head, (3,3), (2,3), ...] so previous head was at (3,3), and it moved right to (4,3), so direction into (4,3) is from left, so current direction into head is R.\n\nNow, for next move, from (4,3), I can choose new direction: U, D, R, but not L (opposite of current).\n\nNow, adjacent cells:\n\n- North: (4,4) - is it free? Not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions? Snake: (4,3), (3,3), etc., no (4,4), so yes free.\n\n- South: (4,2) - is occupied by snake body, position (4,2) in the list, which is a body segment, so if head moves there, it collides with body.\n\n- East: (5,3) - occupied by tail with food, but moving there would eat food but cause collision due to Tail Reward Danger.\n\n- West: (3,3) - but (3,3) is the first body segment, occupied, and also moving west would be left, opposite to current direction right, so cannot move L anyway.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is U to (4,4).\n\nBut I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nThe question is to output actions for the next few turns, but since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I need a plan.\n\nIn this case, at turn 53, only U is possible, so I must move U to (4,4).\n\nThen from there, I can plan future moves.\n\nSo for turn 53, action is U.\n\nThen state for turn 54.\n\nAfter moving U to (4,4):\n\nNew head position (4,4)\n\nSince no food eaten (assuming (4,4) has no food, food is at (5,5), (3,6), (5,3)), so snake moves, tail moves away.\n\nPrevious tail was at (5,3), which had food, but since not eaten, tail moves.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Head moves to (4,4)\n\n- Then body: (4,3) becomes new position 1 (first body)\n\n- (3,3) becomes position 2\n\n- (2,3) position 3\n\n- (2,2) position 4\n\n- (3,2) position 5\n\n- (4,2) position 6\n\n- (5,2) position 7\n\n- (6,2) position 8\n\n- (6,3) position 9\n\n- And tail: since no food eaten, the last segment (5,3) is vacated, so tail is now at (6,3), which was position 8? Positions after move:\n\nNew positions: head (4,4)\n\nThen: previous head (4,3) is now first body\n\nPrevious body 1: (3,3) is second body\n\nPrevious body 2: (2,3) is third body\n\nPrevious body 3: (2,2) is fourth body\n\nPrevious body 4: (3,2) is fifth body\n\nPrevious body 5: (4,2) is sixth body\n\nPrevious body 6: (5,2) is seventh body\n\nPrevious body 7: (6,2) is eighth body\n\nPrevious body 8: (6,3) is ninth body\n\nAnd previous tail (5,3) is gone, so the new tail is the last one, which is (6,3), now the ninth position but since one segment less? No.\n\nNumber of segments: before move, 10 segments.\n\nAfter move without eating, snake has 10 segments still? No.\n\nBefore: 10 positions.\n\nAfter move: head to new cell, tail leaves, so 10 positions still.\n\nPositions:\n\n- New head: (4,4)\n\n- New body 1: old head (4,3)\n\n- New body 2: old body 1 (3,3)\n\n- New body 3: old body 2 (2,3)\n\n- New body 4: old body 3 (2,2)\n\n- New body 5: old body 4 (3,2)\n\n- New body 6: old body 5 (4,2)\n\n- New body 7: old body 6 (5,2)\n\n- New body 8: old body 7 (6,2)\n\n- New body 9: old body 8 (6,3)\n\n- New tail: old body 9 (5,3) is not included? Old body 9 is (6,3)? List indices.\n\nOld positions: index 0: (4,3) head\n\nIndex 1: (3,3)\n\nIndex 2: (2,3)\n\nIndex 3: (2,2)\n\nIndex 4: (3,2)\n\nIndex 5: (4,2)\n\nIndex 6: (5,2)\n\nIndex 7: (6,2)\n\nIndex 8: (6,3)\n\nIndex 9: (5,3) tail\n\nAfter move to (4,4) with no eat:\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nThen new body 1: old head (4,3)\n\nNew body 2: old body 1 (3,3)\n\nNew body 3: old body 2 (2,3)\n\nNew body 4: old body 3 (2,2)\n\nNew body 5: old body 4 (3,2)\n\nNew body 6: old body 5 (4,2)\n\nNew body 7: old body 6 (5,2)\n\nNew body 8: old body 7 (6,2)\n\nNew body 9: old body 8 (6,3)  // old index 8\n\nAnd the tail was old index 9 (5,3), but since no eat, tail moves off, so it is not included. So the new snake has positions from new head to new body 9, which is (6,3), so new tail is (6,3).\n\nNew positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)] \n\nSo 10 segments, tail at (6,3).\n\nThe food at (5,3) is still there, but now (5,3) is empty, since tail moved away.\n\nFood life span: for (5,3), life span 9, at turn 53, so it will be there until turn 61, decreasing each turn.\n\nNow turn 54, head at (4,4), direction from previous move: since moved U, current head direction is U.\n\nFood: (5,5) life span 4, at turn 53, so turn 54: life span 3 left? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 53, life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns, so available on turns 53,54,55,56, gone on 57.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) life 6, available turns 53 to 58.\n\n(5,3) life 9, turns 53 to 61.\n\nNow at turn 54, head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: from U, I can go U, L, R, not D (opposite).\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- North: (4,5)\n\n- South: (4,3) but (4,3) is now the first body segment, occupied, and moving south would be down, opposite to current up, so cannot move D anyway.\n\n- West: (3,4)\n\n- East: (5,4)\n\nNow, check these cells:\n\n(4,5): not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake: positions (4,4) head, (4,3), (3,3), etc., no (4,5), so free.\n\n(3,4): x=3,y=4, not border, obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) not in list, so clear. Not snake, so free.\n\n(5,4): x=5,y=4, not border, obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (5,4) not listed, so clear. Not snake, free.\n\nSo all three moves possible: U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nI need to think ahead to maximize score and survive.\n\nFood locations: (5,5) is at (5,5), which is north-east of current (4,4).\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), west and north.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), but it's on the grid, and now empty since tail moved.\n\n(5,3) is south-east of (4,4), but y=3 vs y=4, so south.\n\n(4,4) to (5,3) is south-east? (5,3) is x+1,y-1, so not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are (4,5), (3,4), (5,4), (4,3) but (4,3) occupied.\n\nSo from (4,4), I can go to (4,5), (3,4), or (5,4).\n\nTo reach (5,5), I need to go east then north or north then east, etc.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is west and north.\n\n(5,3) is south-east, but not directly adjacent.\n\nFirst, I should consider the food life spans.\n\n(5,5) disappears after turn 56, so only 3 turns left including turn 54? Turn 54,55,56 available, gone on 57.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) available until turn 58.\n\n(5,3) available until turn 61.\n\nNow, snake is long, 10 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles.\n\nLet me map the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8:\n\nRows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — these are blocked.\n\nSnake at turn 54: head (4,4), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3) tail.\n\nFood: (5,5), (3,6), (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is now empty and has food.\n\nNow, to eat (5,5), which is at (5,5), I need to get the head there.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go to (5,4) then to (5,5), but (5,4) is free, (5,5) should be free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake currently.\n\nSimilarly, to (3,6): from (4,4) go to (3,4) then to (3,5) then to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut (3,6) might be reachable.\n\nAlso, (5,3) is at (5,3), which is adjacent to (5,2) and (6,3), both snake body, but at turn 54, (5,2) and (6,3) are occupied, so (5,3) is not adjacent to head; head is at (4,4).\n\nTo eat (5,3), I need to move to (5,3) when it's free and head is adjacent.\n\nNow, since (5,3) has food and is on the grid, I can eat it, but need to be careful not to cause Tail Reward Danger if tail is adjacent.\n\nBut tail is at (6,3), which is adjacent to (5,3) horizontally.\n\nIf head moves to (5,3) when tail is at (6,3), they are adjacent, and if I eat the food, it would cause collision because tail doesn't move, head and tail collide.\n\nTail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nIn this case, for (5,3), if head is adjacent and moves to it, but the food is at (5,3), not on tail cell necessarily.\n\nThe danger is when the food is on the tail cell and head is adjacent.\n\nFor (5,3), the food is there, but tail is at (6,3), not at (5,3), so (5,3) is not the tail cell; it's a free cell with food.\n\nSo if head moves to (5,3), it can eat the food without danger, because tail is elsewhere.\n\nOnly when food is on the current tail position and head is adjacent.\n\nHere, at turn 54, tail is at (6,3), food at (5,3) is separate.\n\nSo eating (5,3) is safe, as long as head can move there.\n\nBut from (4,4), (5,3) is not adjacent; adjacent are (4,5), (3,4), (5,4), (4,3) occupied.\n\n(5,3) is diagonal, not directly reachable.\n\nSo I need to move to, say, (5,4) then down to (5,3), or to (4,3) but occupied, etc.\n\nNow, back to turn 54 choices.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, for (5,5), it has short life, only available for 3 more turns: 54,55,56.\n\nTo eat it, I need to be at (5,5) by turn 56 at latest.\n\nFrom current (4,4), I can go to (5,4) in one move, then to (5,5) in another.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,4) to (4,5) then to (5,5), etc.\n\n(3,6) has more time, life 6 at turn 53, so at turn 54, 5 turns left? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 53, life span 6, so available turns: 53,54,55,56,57,58, gone on 59.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) life 9, turns 53 to 61.\n\nNow, since (5,5) is urgent, I should go for it.\n\nFrom (4,4), if I move R to (5,4), then next turn I can move U to (5,5) to eat it.\n\nBut let's see if that's safe.\n\nTurn 54: move R to (5,4)\n\nThen head at (5,4), direction R? From (4,4) to (5,4), moving east, so direction R.\n\nNow, food at (5,5) is adjacent north.\n\nThen turn 55: move U to (5,5), eat food.\n\nNow, when I eat at (5,5), the snake grows.\n\nBut first, at turn 54, after moving to (5,4):\n\nNew head (5,4)\n\nSince no food at (5,4), tail moves.\n\nPrevious tail was (6,3)\n\nAfter move: new positions: head (5,4), then body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), and new tail? Old positions turn 54: head (4,4), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), tail (6,3)\n\nAfter move to (5,4) no eat:\n\nNew head: (5,4)\n\nNew body 1: (4,4)\n\nNew body 2: (4,3)\n\nNew body 3: (3,3)\n\nNew body 4: (2,3)\n\nNew body 5: (2,2)\n\nNew body 6: (3,2)\n\nNew body 7: (4,2)\n\nNew body 8: (5,2)\n\nNew body 9: (6,2)\n\nNew tail: (6,3) is gone, so tail is now (6,2)? New positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)] tail at (6,2)\n\n(6,3) was tail, moved off.\n\nFood at (5,5) still there.\n\nTurn 55: from (5,4), move U to (5,5)\n\nEat food at (5,5)\n\nSince food eaten, snake grows: new head (5,5), then body: previous head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), ..., up to (6,2), and add new segment at end, so tail at (6,2) remains, new segment added there? After eating: positions [ (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) ] so 11 segments, tail at (6,2)\n\nNow, food consumed, so (5,5) removed.\n\nNow, what about other food? (3,6) and (5,3) still there.\n\nLife spans: (3,6) at turn 55, life span was 6 at turn 53, so decreased by 2, life span 4 left? Let's track.\n\nAt turn 53: food (5,5) life 4, (3,6) life 6, (5,3) life 9\n\nTurn 54: (5,5) life 3, (3,6) life 5, (5,3) life 8\n\nTurn 55: after eating (5,5), it's gone. (3,6) life 4, (5,3) life 7? At turn 55, life decreases.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, so at turn 55, (3,6) life span decreases to 4 (from 5 at turn 54), similarly (5,3) to 7.\n\n(3,6) life span 6 at turn 53, so turn 53: life 6, turn 54:5, turn 55:4, turn 56:3, turn 57:2, turn 58:1, gone turn 59.\n\nSimilarly (5,3): turn 53:9, 54:8, 55:7, etc.\n\nNow back to the plan.\n\nAt turn 55, head at (5,5), direction U (since moved up).\n\nNow, possible moves: from U, can go U, L, R, not D.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- North: (5,6)\n\n- South: (5,4) but occupied by body\n\n- West: (4,5)\n\n- East: (6,5)\n\nNow, (5,6): y=6, not border (y=7 is border, but y=6 is ok), not obstacle, not snake? Snake positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (4,4), etc., no (5,6), so free.\n\n(4,5): free, not occupied.\n\n(6,5): x=6, not border, but internal obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, (6,5) not listed, so should be free. Not snake, so free.\n\nAlso, (5,4) occupied, cannot go south.\n\nSo can go U, L, or R.\n\nNow, I need to plan further.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (5,5), good.\n\nNow, next, I can go for (3,6) or (5,3).\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), which is west and north.\n\nFrom (5,5), to reach (3,6), I need to go west and north.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,5), then to (3,5), then to (3,6).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is south, but from (5,5), (5,3) is two south, not adjacent.\n\nBut (5,3) has longer life, so less urgent.\n\n(3,6) has life until turn 58, so 4 turns left at turn 55: turns 55,56,57,58 available.\n\nAt turn 55, head at (5,5), I can move to (4,5) or (5,6) or (6,5).\n\nNow, let's consider the obstacles and snake body.\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), which is below (6,5).\n\nAlso, snake body at (6,2), etc.\n\nBut let's think about going for (3,6).\n\nIf I move L to (4,5) at turn 55.\n\nThen head at (4,5), direction L (west).\n\nThen turn 56: from (4,5), can go U, D, L, not R (opposite).\n\nAdjacent: (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5) but (5,5) is body now, occupied.\n\n(4,6) free? y=6, not border.\n\n(4,4) is occupied, body position.\n\n(3,5) free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake: at turn 55 after eat, positions include (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), etc., no (3,5), so free.\n\n(5,5) occupied.\n\nSo from (4,5), can go U to (4,6), D to (4,4) but occupied, cannot, L to (3,5), R to (5,5) occupied, cannot.\n\nSo can go U or L.\n\nTo reach (3,6), I should go L to (3,5).\n\nTurn 56: move L to (3,5)\n\nHead at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 57: from (3,5), can go U to (3,6) to eat food.\n\n(3,6) has food, so eat.\n\nNow, check if safe.\n\nFirst, at turn 55: head at (5,5), move L to (4,5)\n\nNo food at (4,5), so tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions turn 55: after eating at (5,5), positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)] tail at (6,2)\n\nAfter move to (4,5) no eat:\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nNew body: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)\n\nNew tail: (6,2) gone, so tail at (5,2)\n\nPositions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] tail at (5,2)\n\n(6,2) vacated.\n\nTurn 56: move L to (3,5)\n\nHead to (3,5), no food there? Food is at (3,6), not (3,5), so no eat.\n\nAfter move: new head (3,5)\n\nBody: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nTail: (5,2) gone, so tail at (4,2)\n\nPositions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] tail at (4,2)\n\nTurn 57: from (3,5), move U to (3,6)\n\nEat food at (3,6)\n\nGrow: new head (3,6), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), ..., (4,2), and add new segment, so tail at (4,2) remains.\n\nNow, I have eaten both (5,5) and (3,6), good.\n\nBut what about (5,3)? Still there, but I can go for it later.\n\nIn this plan, at turn 54, I moved R to (5,4), then U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then L to (3,5), then U to (3,6).\n\nBut at turn 54, I had other choices.\n\nI could have gone U to (4,5) first, but then to reach (5,5) might be harder.\n\nIn the above, I ate both foods with short life.\n\nBut I need to consider the starting point.\n\nAt turn 53, I must move U to (4,4), as only choice.\n\nThen at turn 54, I chose R to (5,4).\n\nBut I could choose U to (4,5) or L to (3,4).\n\nIf I go to (4,5), then I can go to (5,5) or to (3,6).\n\nFor example, turn 54: move U to (4,5)\n\nHead to (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 55: from (4,5), I can move R to (5,5) to eat.\n\nThen head to (5,5), eat.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,6) via (4,5) but (4,5) is body, etc.\n\nBut in this case, I still eat (5,5) by turn 55.\n\nThen for (3,6), I need to go west.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move L to (4,5), but at turn 55 after moving to (5,5), (4,5) might be free or not.\n\nAfter eating at (5,5) turn 55, positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (4,4), etc.\n\n(4,5) is free? At turn 55, after move to (5,5) with eat, positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)] so (4,5) not occupied.\n\nThen turn 56: from (5,5), move L to (4,5)\n\nNo food, so tail moves, etc.\n\nThen turn 57: from (4,5), move L to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 58: to (3,6) eat.\n\nBut (3,6) life span: at turn 58, it is available, gone turn 59.\n\nSo I can eat it on turn 58.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly.\n\nBut in the first plan, I ate on turn 57.\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, back to turn 54, if I go L to (3,4).\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nThen I can go to (3,5) then (3,6) to eat (3,6).\n\nBut (5,5) might expire.\n\nFrom (3,4), to reach (5,5) is farther.\n\nFor example, (3,4) to (4,4) but (4,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 54, if I move L to (3,4):\n\nAfter turn 53 move U to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), tail (6,3)\n\nMove to (3,4): new head (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), tail (6,3) gone, tail at (6,2)\n\nNow head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 55: can go U to (3,5), L to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacles: (2,4) is listed, yes, so (2,4) wall, cannot go.\n\nD to (3,3) but occupied by body.\n\nR to (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo only possible move U to (3,5)\n\nMove to (3,5), no food.\n\nThen turn 56: from (3,5), can go U to (3,6) to eat food.\n\nEat (3,6) at turn 56.\n\nThen (5,5) is still available? At turn 56, (5,5) life span: turn 54 life 3, turn 55 life 2, turn 56 life 1, available turn 56, gone turn 57.\n\nBut head at (3,6) after eating, which is far from (5,5).\n\nFrom (3,6) to (5,5) is not adjacent, need multiple moves, but (5,5) gone after turn 56, so I can only eat it on turn 56 if I am there, but I am at (3,6) on turn 56, cannot reach (5,5) in one move.\n\nThus, if I go to (3,4) at turn 54, I miss (5,5).\n\nTherefore, better to go for (5,5) first by moving R at turn 54.\n\nSimilarly, going U to (4,5) at turn 54 also allows me to reach (5,5) by moving R at turn 55.\n\nBut moving R at turn 54 gets me closer.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat (5,5).\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince at turn 53 only U is possible, I must do that.\n\nThen for turn 54, I can choose, but to maximize, I should go for the urgent food.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,3) is still there, and I can eat it later.\n\nBut after eating (5,5) and (3,6), the snake is longer, 11 or 12 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nIn the grid, with obstacles, let's see the available space.\n\nFor example, the area around (5,3) might be congested.\n\n(5,3) has food, and life until turn 61, so plenty of time.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), head at (3,6), I can go down to (3,5), then to (4,5), etc., to reach (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3), which might be near the body.\n\nBut I can plan that later.\n\nFor now, for the immediate actions.\n\nAt turn 53: only U, so move U.\n\nTurn 54: move R to (5,4) to set up for (5,5)\n\nThen turn 55: move U to (5,5) eat\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,6).\n\nAt turn 55, after eating (5,5), head at (5,5), direction U.\n\nNow, to go to (3,6), I should move west.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\n(5,6) is free, (4,5) free, (6,5) free, as before.\n\nIf I move L to (4,5), as in the first plan.\n\nThen turn 56: from (4,5), move L to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 57: move U to (3,6) eat.\n\nBut at turn 57, (3,6) is still available, life span at turn 55 was 4, turn 56:3, turn 57:2, so yes.\n\nI could move U to (5,6) first, but that might not help for (3,6).\n\n(5,6) is north, away from (3,6).\n\nSo better to go directly towards (3,6).\n\nNow, what about (5,3)? I can eat it after.\n\nBut let's see if I can include it.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,6), head at (3,6), then I can move down to (3,5), then to (4,5), then to (5,5) but (5,5) is gone, etc., to (5,4), (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut need to check Tail Reward Danger.\n\nWhen I move to (5,3), where is the tail.\n\nBut since I think 5+ turns, let's list the actions up to turn 57 or so.\n\nAlso, for the answer format, I need to output actions for several turns, starting from turn 53.\n\nSince turn 53 is fixed, and turn 54 I choose R, then 55 U, then 56 L to (4,5)? At turn 55, from (5,5) I move to (4,5), but at that point, (4,5) might be occupied? No, in the sequence.\n\nIn the first plan: after turn 55 eat at (5,5), positions have (5,5) head, (5,4) body, (4,4) body, etc., (4,5) is free.\n\nThen move to (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5) to (3,5).\n\nThen to (3,6).\n\nNow, at turn 54, if I move to (5,4), then turn 55 to (5,5), that's fine.\n\nBut at turn 54, I could move directly to (4,5), but then to (5,5) I need to move right, which is possible.\n\nBut moving to (5,4) first might be similar.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacles.\n\nFor example, (6,4) is obstacle, so (6,5) is free, but if I go there, it might be a dead end if not careful.\n\nBut in this plan, I don't go east.\n\nAlso, (5,3) is south, with food.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), I can head south to eat (5,3).\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nI need to output for at least a few turns.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 53 to 57.\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: R (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 55: U (to (5,5) eat)\n\nTurn 56: from (5,5), I need to go to (4,5), so move L.\n\nTurn 57: from (4,5), move L to (3,5), but at turn 57 I plan to move to (3,5), then turn 58 to (3,6).\n\nBut turn 57 is not eating yet.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: R\n\nTurn 55: U (eat (5,5))\n\nNow turn 56: from (5,5), move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 57: from (4,5), move L to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 58: move U to (3,6) eat.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 57 or more.\n\nThe state is at turn 53, and I need to output actions starting from turn 53.\n\nThink 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions for the immediate turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo I should list a sequence.\n\nSince turn 53 is fixed, turn 54 I have choice, but I think R is good.\n\nBut let's see if moving to (3,4) at turn 54 is better for something, but I think not, since I miss (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (4,5) at turn 54: then at turn 55, I can move R to (5,5) to eat, same as before, but I reach (5,5) at same turn 55.\n\nBut from (4,5), moving R to (5,5) is possible.\n\nThen after that, same.\n\nBut in that case, at turn 54, if I move U to (4,5), then turn 55 move R to (5,5), then I am at (5,5), and (4,5) is now body? When I move to (5,5), (4,5) might be part of body or not.\n\nAt turn 54: move U to (4,5)\n\nAfter turn 53 to (4,4), positions as before.\n\nMove to (4,5): new head (4,5), body (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), etc., tail moves to (6,2) or something.\n\nEarlier: after turn 53 U to (4,4), positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)] tail (6,3)\n\nMove to (4,5) no eat: new head (4,5), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), tail (6,3) gone, tail at (6,2)\n\nNow head at (4,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 55: move R to (5,5) eat.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move L to (4,5), but (4,5) is now occupied because after moving to (5,5) with eat, positions: new head (5,5), body: previous head (4,5), then (4,4), (4,3), etc.\n\nSo (4,5) is body, cannot move back.\n\nTo go to (3,6), I need to move to (4,5) but occupied, so I have to go another way, like to (5,6) or (6,5), then to (4,6), etc., which is longer.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), move U to (5,6), then turn 56 move L to (4,6), then turn 57 to (3,6)? (3,6) from (4,6) not adjacent, need to go down.\n\n(4,6) to (3,6) is west, adjacent.\n\n(4,6) to (3,6) is left, yes.\n\nBut (3,6) from (4,6) is adjacent west.\n\nBut at turn 57, if I am at (4,6), I can move L to (3,6) to eat.\n\nBut (3,6) life: turn 57 life 2, available.\n\nBut in this path, I go via (5,6), which might be less direct.\n\nCompared to going directly west after eating (5,5).\n\nIn the first path, by going to (5,4) then (5,5), then to (4,5), I can go directly to (3,5) and (3,6).\n\nIn the alternative, if I go to (4,5) first, then to (5,5), then (4,5) is body, so I cannot go back west directly.\n\nThus, the first approach is better: at turn 54, move R to (5,4), then U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then L to (3,5), then U to (3,6).\n\nNow for (5,3), I can plan after that.\n\nBut for the output, I can list up to turn 57 or 58.\n\nSince the food (5,3) has long life, I can handle it later.\n\nNow, to write the actions.\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: R\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: L (to (4,5) from (5,5))\n\nAt turn 55, after moving U to (5,5), head direction is U.\n\nThen move L to (4,5), which is west, so direction L.\n\nThen turn 57: from (4,5), move L to (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 58: U to (3,6)\n\nBut I don't need to output all.\n\nFor the answer, I can output from turn 53 to, say, turn 57.\n\nTurn 57: I am moving to (3,5), not eating yet.\n\nPerhaps output until the next eat or something.\n\nBut the format doesn't specify how many turns, but I think a few is fine.\n\nSince the state has t1=53, I can do up to t1+4 or t1+5.\n\nLet me see.\n\nAlso, for turn 53, action is U.\n\nThen for turn 54, action R.\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nThen for turn 56: from (5,5), I move L to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 57: from (4,5), move L to (3,5)\n\nAt turn 57, I can stop or continue.\n\nBut I think this is reasonable.\n\nNow, about (5,3): at some point, I need to eat it.\n\nFor example, after (3,6), head at (3,6), I can move D to (3,5), but (3,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter eating (3,6) at turn 58, head at (3,6), then I can move to (3,5), then to (4,5), but (4,5) might be body, depending.\n\nFrom there, to (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) to eat.\n\n(5,3) should be free and available.\n\nSince life until turn 61, at turn 58, life span 3 left? Turn 53:9, 54:8,55:7,56:6,57:5,58:4, so turn 58 life 4, available.\n\nSo I have time.\n\nBut in the immediate actions, I think the plan is fine.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: R\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: L (from (5,5) to (4,5))\n\nTurn 57: L (from (4,5) to (3,5))\n\nThen I can add turn 58: U to (3,6) but not necessary.\n\nSince the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions, I think up to turn 57 is 5 turns: 53,54,55,56,57.\n\nt1=53, t1 to t1+4: 5 turns.\n\nActions for 5 turns.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 57 is moving to (3,5), setting up for (3,6).\n\nNow, I think it's ok.\n\nBut let's confirm no collisions or issues.\n\nIn turn 56, moving L from (5,5) to (4,5): (4,5) is free at that time.\n\nSimilarly, turn 57 to (3,5): free.\n\nAlso, the tail is moving, so no problem.\n\nTherefore, the actions should be:\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: R\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: L\n\nTurn 57: L\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, for turn 57, moving to (3,5), and from there turn 58 I can go to (3,6).\n\nBut I think that's fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food with the shortest remaining life span first, as it will disappear soonest. The food at (5,5) has a life span of 4 at turn 53, meaning it will disappear after turn 56 (available on turns 53, 54, 55, 56). The food at (3,6) has a life span of 6 at turn 53, so it is available until turn 58. The food at (5,3) has a life span of 9 at turn 53, so it is available until turn 61 and can be eaten later. The snake must also avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and its own body, and must not trigger the \"Tail Reward Danger\" by eating food on the tail cell when adjacent to the tail.\n\n### Key Considerations from Current State (Turn 53)\n- **Snake Position and Direction**: Head at (4,3), moving right (R). Only possible move is Up (U) to (4,4) because:\n  - Down (D) to (4,2) is occupied by the snake body (segment at (4,2)).\n  - Right (R) to (5,3) triggers Tail Reward Danger (food on tail cell, head adjacent to tail).\n  - Left (L) is invalid (opposite of current direction R).\n- **Food Urgency**: \n  - (5,5) must be eaten by turn 56. Path: From (4,4) at turn 54, move to (5,4) then (5,5) by turn 55.\n  - (3,6) can be eaten later (by turn 58). Path: After (5,5), move west to (4,5) and (3,5), then to (3,6) by turn 58.\n  - (5,3) can be eaten after turn 58 due to long life span.\n- **Obstacles and Collision Avoidance**: Internal obstacles must be avoided, and the snake body occupies several cells. After moving, the tail moves away from (5,3) at turn 54, making it safe to eat later without Tail Reward Danger.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turn 53**: Only U is possible to (4,4).\n  - **Turn 54**: Move R to (5,4) to set up for (5,5) and avoid missing it.\n  - **Turn 55**: Move U to (5,5) to eat the food (score +1, length increases to 11).\n  - **Turn 56**: Move L to (4,5) to head towards (3,6).\n  - **Turn 57**: Move L to (3,5) to continue path to (3,6).\n  - **Beyond** (for context, not in output): Turn 58 move U to (3,6) to eat food (score +1), then plan to eat (5,3) via (3,5) → (4,5) → (5,5) → (5,4) → (5,3) or similar safe path.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 53 to 57)\nThe sequence below ensures the snake eats (5,5) by turn 55 and positions itself to eat (3,6) by turn 58, while avoiding all risks. Actions are chosen to align with the grid constraints and food life spans.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 53: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 54: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 55: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 56: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 57: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 54, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with some cells blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,4), then body segments: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). So the snake is 10 segments long.\n\nHead direction is U, which is up. That means last move was up, so from (4,3) to (4,4). Since I can't instantly reverse, I can't move down (D) on the next turn because that would be opposite to current direction U.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (5,5) with life span 3, value +1 (since it's positive food)\n\n- (3,6) with life span 5, value +1\n\n- (5,3) with life span 8, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and they all increase length by 1 when eaten.\n\nI need to plan moves for turns 54, 55, 56, etc., at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid from (0,0) to (7,7):\n\n- Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are all walls, so I can't go there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (4,4)\n\nBody: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSo let's list occupied cells:\n\n- (4,4) head\n\n- (4,3) body\n\n- (3,3) body\n\n- (2,3) body\n\n- (2,2) body\n\n- (3,2) body\n\n- (4,2) body\n\n- (5,2) body\n\n- (6,2) body\n\n- (6,3) body\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (5,5) life 3\n\n- (3,6) life 5\n\n- (5,3) life 8\n\n(5,3) has food, but (5,3) is not occupied by snake? Snake has positions: (5,2) and (6,2), (6,3), but (5,3) is not listed in snake positions. Let me check.\n\nSnake positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nSo (5,3) is not in this list, so it should be free? But there's food at (5,3), and it's not occupied by snake body.\n\n(5,3) is a cell, and food is there, so it's possible to eat it.\n\nBut (5,3) might be adjacent to body? Let's see.\n\nHead is at (4,4), which is up from (4,3).\n\nNow, possible moves from head (4,4):\n\n- Up (U): to (4,5)\n\n- Down (D): to (4,3) but (4,3) is body segment, so moving there would cause collision, deadly. Also, since head direction is U, moving D is instant reverse, not allowed.\n\n- Left (L): to (3,4)\n\n- Right (R): to (5,4)\n\nFirst, I cannot move down because it's instant reverse and also body collision.\n\nMoving down to (4,3) is occupied by body, so definitely not possible.\n\nNow, other moves:\n\n- U: (4,5) - is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied or walls.\n\nWalls: borders, so x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are walls. (4,5) is within bounds, x=4,y=5, not border.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). None at (4,5).\n\nSnake positions: head (4,4), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). So (4,5) is not occupied, so U to (4,5) is possible.\n\n- L: to (3,4). (3,4): not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) not listed, so should be free? Snake positions: no (3,4), so L to (3,4) possible.\n\n- R: to (5,4). (5,4): not border, obstacles: (6,4) is at x=6,y=4, so (5,4) not obstacle. Snake positions: no (5,4), so possible.\n\nSo from (4,4), possible moves: U, L, R. D not possible.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (5,5) at (5,5), life span 3, so it will disappear after 3 turns, meaning on turn 54,55,56 it exists, gone after turn 56? Life span decreases every turn including current, so on turn 54, life=3, after turn 54, life=2, after turn 55, life=1, after turn 56, life=0, gone. So available until turn 56.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) life=5, available turns 54 to 58 (since turn 54:5, 55:4, 56:3, 57:2, 58:1, 59:0 gone).\n\n(5,3) life=8, available longer.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is below the head. Head at (4,4), (5,3) is down-right, but to reach it, I need to go right and down or something.\n\nBut moving directly down from (4,4) is not possible.\n\nNow, also, the food at (5,3) might be under the snake body? Snake positions: (5,2) and (6,2), (6,3), but not (5,3), so it's not under body, it's free to eat if I can get to it.\n\nBut to eat it, head must be on it when it's free.\n\nNow, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, what is the tail? Snake positions: last element is (6,3), which is the tail.\n\nTail position: (6,3)\n\nIs there food on tail? (6,3) has no food listed; food is at (5,5), (3,6), (5,3). (6,3) is part of snake, so no food there now.\n\nBut if I were to eat food when tail is adjacent, it could be dangerous.\n\nCurrently, head at (4,4), tail at (6,3), not adjacent. Adjacent cells to head: (4,5) U, (4,3) D (but occupied), (3,4) L, (5,4) R. Tail is at (6,3), which is not adjacent to head directly; distance is |dx|=2, |dy|=1, so not adjacent.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to food.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food at (5,5). It's close, at (5,5), life span 3, so I need to eat it soon if I want to, by turn 56.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is at (3,6), life 5, so less urgent.\n\n(5,3) at (5,3), life 8, plenty of time.\n\n(5,3) is currently unoccupied, but let's see if it's accessible.\n\nFrom head (4,4), to get to (5,5), I can go right to (5,4), then up to (5,5), but (5,5) might be occupied or not later.\n\n(5,5) is food location, so it should be free now.\n\nSimilarly, to (3,6), left to (3,4), then up to (3,5), then to (3,6).\n\n(3,5) might be free? Not occupied now.\n\nTo (5,3), from (4,4), I can go right to (5,4), then down to (5,3)? But (5,3) is below.\n\n(5,3) is at y=3, head at y=4, so down.\n\nBut from (4,4), going R to (5,4), then from there, possible moves include D to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) has food with life 8, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends and plan for long path.\n\nSince I must think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, on turn 54, I need to choose action: U, L, or R.\n\nIf I go U to (4,5), then head at (4,5).\n\nThen possible moves from there.\n\n(4,5) neighbors: U to (4,6), D to (4,4) but (4,4) will be body after move, so cannot go back, L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) has food, so if I go to (5,5), I can eat it on turn 55 if I go that way.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIf on turn 54 I go U to (4,5), then on turn 55, I could go R to (5,5) to eat the food.\n\nBut (5,5) life span: on turn 54, life=3, after turn 54, it decreases, so on turn 55, life=2, still there, turn 56 life=1, turn 57 gone.\n\nSo if I eat on turn 55, it's fine.\n\nBut when I eat, snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move for that turn, so snake becomes longer.\n\nWhen I eat food, on the turn I move to food, I grow, so the new segment is added, and tail stays, so length increases by 1.\n\nThen next turn, tail moves as usual.\n\nNow, after eating at (5,5), head at (5,5), then I need to move somewhere.\n\nBut let's think about the area.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (6,4), which is near (5,5).\n\n(6,4) is wall, so I cannot go there.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5) but x=6,y=5, not border? x=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok, but (6,4) is obstacle, not (6,5), so (6,5) should be free.\n\ny=7 is wall, so (6,5) is within bounds.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is ok.\n\nBut let's list all possible moves step by step.\n\nFirst, back to turn 54 choices.\n\nOption 1: Go U to (4,5) on turn 54.\n\nThen turn 55: from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), D to (4,4) but (4,4) is body (since snake moved, body segments shift), L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\nIf I go R to (5,5), I eat food, grow to length 11.\n\nThen head at (5,5), and tail is still (6,3) or something? After move to (4,5) on turn 54, snake positions: head (4,5), then body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), tail (6,3)? Let's trace.\n\nOriginal positions turn 54: [(4,4)H, (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)T]\n\nAfter move U to (4,5): head to (4,5), so new head (4,5), body: the previous head becomes body, so [(4,5)H, (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)] and tail (6,3) moves? When snake moves, all segments shift, so the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment or something.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the next segment towards the head, so the second segment moves to where head was, third to where second was, and so on, and the tail segment is removed unless food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten, when head moves to new cell, the tail is removed, and the new body is the old positions minus tail.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIn this game, when snake moves without eating food, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front, so the last position is vacated.\n\nFor example, from positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move, head to new pos, then B1 to old H pos, B2 to old B1 pos, ..., and T is removed, so new positions [new H, old H, old B1, ..., old T-1]\n\nIn this case, turn 54 positions: index 0: H (4,4), 1: (4,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (2,3), 4: (2,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (5,2), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,3) T\n\nAfter moving head to (4,5) without eating:\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nNew body: segment 1 moves to old H (4,4), segment 2 moves to old seg1 (4,3), segment 3 to old seg2 (3,3), segment 4 to old seg3 (2,3), segment 5 to old seg4 (2,2), segment 6 to old seg5 (3,2), segment 7 to old seg6 (4,2), segment 8 to old seg7 (5,2), segment 9 (tail) moves to old seg8 (6,2)\n\nSo new positions: [(4,5)H, (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)] and the old tail (6,3) is gone, so (6,3) is free now.\n\nLength is still 10, but tail is now at (6,2).\n\nPositions: head (4,5), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) tail.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, on turn 55, from (4,5), I can go to (5,5) to eat food.\n\nMove R to (5,5): since (5,5) has food, I eat it, so head moves to (5,5), and I grow, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nSo after eating: head at (5,5), body: the previous body positions, and tail stays, so new tail is the old tail.\n\nPositions: new head (5,5), then the old body: which is (4,5) but (4,5) was head, now it becomes the first body segment.\n\nAfter move to (5,5) with eating:\n\nHead moves to (5,5), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so the body segments are: old head position becomes new body segment, and the rest body segments remain, so length increases.\n\nSo from before move: positions at start of turn 55: [(4,5)H, (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)]\n\nAfter move to (5,5) with eat: head to (5,5), so new head (5,5), and new body: (4,5) (which was old head), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) and since ate, no tail removed, so tail is still (6,2), but (6,2) is now part of body, and a new segment is added? No.\n\nWhen food is eaten, the snake grows, so the new position has the head at food cell, and the body includes all previous segments, so the tail remains where it was.\n\nSo new positions: [ (5,5)H, (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) ] and length 11.\n\n(6,2) is the tail.\n\nThen on turn 55, food at (5,5) is eaten, so removed.\n\nNow, head at (5,5), direction from (4,5) to (5,5) is right, so head direction R.\n\nPossible moves from (5,5): U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5).\n\nNow, (4,5) is body, so L to (4,5) is collision, not possible.\n\nD to (5,4): (5,4) is not occupied, not wall. Walls: (6,4) is obstacle, but (5,4) not. Snake positions: (4,5) is body, (5,4) is free? From above positions, (5,4) is not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, U to (5,6) free, R to (6,5) free.\n\n(6,5) is near obstacle (6,4), but (6,5) should be ok.\n\nBut (6,4) is wall, so cannot go there.\n\nFrom (5,5), if I go D to (5,4), then I can go to (5,3) which has food, but (5,3) has life 8, so not urgent.\n\nBut let's see the area around (5,5).\n\nThere is obstacle at (6,4), which might block some paths.\n\nAlso, the snake body is below, so going down might be tight.\n\nBut (5,4) is free, (5,3) has food.\n\nBack to turn 54.\n\nIf I go U on turn 54 to (4,5), then on turn 55 I can eat (5,5) by going R.\n\nBut is that the best? I need to think long term.\n\nAnother option: on turn 54, go L to (3,4).\n\nThen head to (3,4).\n\nAfter move: from (4,4) to (3,4), so new head (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), and tail moves to (6,3)? Similar to before.\n\nTurn 54 positions: [ (4,4)H, (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)T ]\n\nMove L to (3,4): new head (3,4), then body: old H (4,4) becomes first body, then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), and tail (6,3) moves to old seg8 (6,2), so new positions: [(3,4)H, (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)] and (6,3) free.\n\nTail at (6,2).\n\nThen on turn 55, from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, collision, L to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (2,4), so cannot go L.\n\nR to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, collision.\n\nSo from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), or D to (3,3) not possible, L to (2,4) wall, R to (4,4) body, so only U to (3,5) is possible? D to (3,3) is occupied by body, so not possible.\n\nNeighbors of (3,4): U (3,5), D (3,3), L (2,4), R (4,4).\n\n(3,3) is body, (2,4) is wall, (4,4) is body, so only U (3,5) is free and possible.\n\nSo if I go L on turn 54 to (3,4), then on turn 55 I must go U to (3,5), no choice.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (3,6) to eat food there, since (3,6) has food.\n\n(3,6) life span 5, on turn 55 it's still there.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5), then to (3,6) on turn 56 or something.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, if I go L on turn 54, I force myself to go U on turn 55 to (3,5), then I can eat (3,6) soon.\n\nBut (3,6) has life 5, so I have time.\n\nNow, third option on turn 54: go R to (5,4).\n\nThen head to (5,4).\n\nAfter move: from (4,4) to (5,4), new head (5,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), tail to (6,3)? New positions: [(5,4)H, (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)] and (6,3) free.\n\nTail at (6,2).\n\nNow, from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), which has food, so I can eat it immediately on turn 54? No, turn 54 is the move to (5,4), so after move, I am at (5,4), not on food.\n\nFood at (5,5), so to eat, I need to go to (5,5).\n\nOn turn 55, from (5,4), I can go U to (5,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,3), which has food, so I could go down to eat (5,3).\n\nOr L to (4,4), but (4,4) is body, collision.\n\nR to (6,4), but (6,4) is obstacle, wall, cannot go.\n\nSo from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), or D to (5,3), since L and R not possible.\n\n(5,3) has food, so going D eats it, or U eats (5,5).\n\nBoth foods are positive.\n\nNow, (5,5) has life 3, so it will disappear soon, while (5,3) has life 8, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut eating (5,5) might be urgent.\n\nSimilarly, eating (5,3) now is possible.\n\nBut let's think about the tail danger or other risks.\n\nFirst, if I eat (5,5) on turn 55, as above.\n\nBut earlier with U move on turn 54, I can eat on turn 55.\n\nWith R move on turn 54, I can eat on turn 55 as well.\n\nNow, the food at (5,3) is below.\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3), and snake body is around there.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), body includes (4,4), (4,3), etc.\n\n(5,3) is not occupied, so I can go to it.\n\nIf I go D to (5,3) on turn 55, I eat it, grow.\n\nThen head at (5,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves from (5,3): U to (5,4) but (5,4) was head, now body? After eating at (5,3), positions: head at (5,3), body: old head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), etc., and tail stays.\n\nFrom turn 55 start: positions [(5,4)H, (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)]\n\nAfter move D to (5,3) with eat: head to (5,3), new body segment at old tail? When eat, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move.\n\nSo new positions: [ (5,3)H, (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) ] length 11.\n\nTail at (6,2).\n\nThen from (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, collision, not possible.\n\nD to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, collision.\n\nL to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision.\n\nR to (6,3) which might be free? (6,3) was free earlier, but let's see if occupied.\n\nIn new positions, (6,3) not listed, so free, but (6,3) is adjacent to obstacle? (6,4) is wall, but (6,3) should be free.\n\nAlso, from (6,3), I can go to other places.\n\nBut from (5,3), U, D, L all lead to body cells, only R to (6,3) is possible.\n\n(5,3) neighbors: U (5,4) body, D (5,2) body, L (4,3) body, R (6,3) free.\n\nSo only R to (6,3) is possible.\n\nThen on turn 56, I must go to (6,3).\n\nThen from (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nD to (6,2) but (6,2) is body, collision.\n\nL to (5,3) but (5,3) is body now, collision.\n\nR to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nSo all moves from (6,3) are impossible: U wall, D body, L body, R wall. Dead end!\n\nIf I eat (5,3) on turn 55, I end up trapped at (6,3) with no way out on turn 56.\n\nTherefore, eating (5,3) now is very dangerous; I should avoid it or eat it later when the tail has moved.\n\nBut (5,3) has life 8, so I can wait.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,5), if I eat it, I might not be trapped immediately.\n\nBack to turn 54 choices.\n\nIf I go R to (5,4) on turn 54, then on turn 55 I can go U to (5,5) to eat, or D to (5,3) but D to (5,3) leads to trap as above, so I should not do that.\n\nSo from (5,4), only safe move is U to (5,5) to eat.\n\nThen after eating (5,5), as before, head at (5,5), body around, and I can move U, D, or R.\n\nL is not possible because (4,5) is body.\n\nNow, from (5,5), U to (5,6), D to (5,4), R to (6,5).\n\n(5,4) is body, so D not possible.\n\nU to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\n(5,6) is free, (6,5) free.\n\nThen I can go that way.\n\nBut the area above might have more space.\n\ny=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall.\n\nAlso, food at (3,6) is there.\n\nBut let's first plan the immediate move.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,3) is under risk because if I go near it, I might be forced to eat it and get trapped.\n\nBut it's not under snake, so I can avoid it.\n\nNow, back to the first option: go U on turn 54 to (4,5).\n\nThen on turn 55, I can go R to (5,5) to eat, or other moves.\n\nIf I go U to (4,5) on 54, then on 55 I can go to (5,5) to eat, or U to (4,6), or L to (3,5).\n\nIf I go to (5,5), I eat as before.\n\nIf I go U to (4,6) or L to (3,5), I delay eating (5,5), but it has only life 3, so if I don't eat by turn 56, it disappears.\n\nTurn 56 is the last turn it exists, since after turn 56, life=0 gone.\n\nOn turn 56, if I am at a position to eat it.\n\nBut let's not delay if possible.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (3,6) has more time.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so I should try to eat all if possible.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid space.\n\nThe snake is long, 10 segments, and the grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nFor example, the area around (5,3) is tight because of the body and obstacles.\n\n(6,4) obstacle, and body below.\n\nSimilarly, left side has obstacles at (2,4), (1,2), etc.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (5,5) first since it's urgent.\n\nThen after eating, I can go up or right.\n\nBut let's consider the L option on turn 54.\n\nIf I go L to (3,4) on turn 54, then I must go U to (3,5) on turn 55.\n\nThen at (3,5), I can go U to (3,6) to eat that food on turn 56, since (3,6) has life 5, turn 56 life=3, still there.\n\nOr I can go L to (2,5), or R to (4,5), etc.\n\nFrom (3,5), neighbors: U (3,6), D (3,4) but (3,4) is body after move, L (2,5), R (4,5).\n\n(3,4) will be body, so D not possible.\n\nU to (3,6) has food.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) is not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (2,4) is wall, but (2,5) not listed, so free.\n\nR to (4,5) which might be free or body.\n\nAfter turn 55 move to (3,5), let's see positions.\n\nTurn 54: go L to (3,4), positions: [(3,4)H, (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)]\n\nTurn 55: go U to (3,5), new head (3,5), body: old H (3,4) to first body, then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), tail to (6,3) or something.\n\nMove to (3,5) without eat: new head (3,5), body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), and tail (6,2) moves to old seg8 (5,2)? Positions: after move, new body segments: segment 1 to old H (3,4), segment 2 to old seg1 (4,4), segment 3 to old seg2 (4,3), segment 4 to old seg3 (3,3), segment 5 to old seg4 (2,3), segment 6 to old seg5 (2,2), segment 7 to old seg6 (3,2), segment 8 to old seg7 (4,2), segment 9 to old seg8 (5,2), so tail at (5,2), and (6,2) free.\n\nNew positions: [(3,5)H, (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)]\n\nTail at (5,2).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go U to (3,6) to eat food, or L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is free, not occupied.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), eat on turn 55 or 56? This is turn 55 move, so if I go U to (3,6), I eat the food there.\n\nThen grow, etc.\n\nBut (3,6) food is available.\n\nNow, comparing the options.\n\nI think for turn 54, going L might be less flexible because I am forced to go up, and then I am on the left side, which has obstacles.\n\nWhereas going U or R keeps me central.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,5) is urgent, so I should prioritize eating it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is dangerous to eat now.\n\nSo on turn 54, I should either go U or R to set up for eating (5,5).\n\nIf I go U to (4,5) on turn 54, then on turn 55 I can go R to (5,5) to eat.\n\nIf I go R to (5,4) on turn 54, then on turn 55 go U to (5,5) to eat.\n\nBoth lead to eating on turn 55.\n\nBut after eating, the positions are different.\n\nFirst case: go U on 54 to (4,5), then R on 55 to (5,5) eat.\n\nAfter eating, head at (5,5), body: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), etc. as before.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\nD and L not possible.\n\nSecond case: go R on 54 to (5,4), then U on 55 to (5,5) eat.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) on 54, positions: [(5,4)H, (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)]\n\nThen move U to (5,5) with eat: head to (5,5), new positions: [ (5,5)H, (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) ] length 11, tail at (6,2).\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, not possible, L to (4,5) not body? (4,5) is not in positions, so free? Positions have (4,4), (4,3), but not (4,5), so (4,5) is free.\n\nIn this sequence, when I went R on turn 54 to (5,4), the body is (4,4), etc., and (4,5) was not occupied, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, R to (6,5).\n\nSo from (5,5), U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5) all possible? D not possible.\n\n(5,4) is body, so D not possible.\n\nBut L to (4,5) is possible.\n\nIn both cases, after eating (5,5), I have options.\n\nBut in the first case (U then R), body includes (4,5), so from (5,5), L to (4,5) is not possible because (4,5) is body.\n\nIn first case: after U on 54 to (4,5), then R on 55 to (5,5) with eat, positions: [ (5,5)H, (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) ]\n\nSo (4,5) is body, so from (5,5), L to (4,5) is body, collision.\n\nU to (5,6), D to (5,4) but (5,4) not listed, free? (5,4) is not in positions, so should be free, but in the list, after move, positions are (5,5)H, (4,5), (4,4), etc., no (5,4), so (5,4) is free.\n\nD to (5,4) is possible.\n\nR to (6,5) possible.\n\nSo from (5,5), U, D, R possible; L not.\n\nIn second case, after R on 54 to (5,4), then U on 55 to (5,5) with eat, positions: [ (5,5)H, (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) ]\n\nThen from (5,5), U to (5,6), D to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, not possible, L to (4,5) free (since not occupied), R to (6,5) free.\n\nSo U, L, R possible; D not.\n\nIn both cases, I have three choices after eating.\n\nBut to maximize long-term, I should consider going for other food.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,5), I can go for (3,6) or (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is below, but it might be risky to go down because of the body.\n\nIn the positions, after eating, the body is around (4,4) down to (6,2), so (5,3) is free, but if I go to (5,4), it might be occupied or not.\n\nIn the first case, after U then R, positions have (5,4) free, so I can go D to (5,4), then to (5,3) to eat, but (5,3) has food, so if I go to (5,3), I eat it, but then I might be trapped as before.\n\nFrom (5,5), if I go D to (5,4), then from (5,4), I can go D to (5,3) to eat.\n\nAfter eating (5,3), head at (5,3), and as before, only R to (6,3) is possible, then trapped.\n\nSo I should not go that way.\n\nInstead, I should go up or right to open space.\n\nFor example, go to (5,6) or (6,5).\n\n(3,6) is on the left, so I might need to go left.\n\nBut after eating (5,5), if I go L to (4,5), but in the first case (U then R), (4,5) is body, so not possible; in second case (R then U), (4,5) is free, so I can go L to (4,5), then to (3,5), etc. to reach (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, I can go U to (5,6), then to (4,6) or something.\n\nSince (3,6) has life 5, I have time.\n\nBut let's decide turn 54 move.\n\nI think going U or R both allow me to eat (5,5) on turn 55.\n\nBut going U on turn 54 might be better because it gives me the option to not eat on turn 55 if I want, but I should eat it since it's urgent.\n\nIf I go U on 54 to (4,5), on turn 55 I could go U to (4,6) instead of R to (5,5), but then (5,5) might disappear before I can eat it.\n\nOn turn 55, if I am at (4,5), and I go U to (4,6), then on turn 56, (5,5) still exists, life=1, so I can go from (4,6) to (5,6) or to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, etc.\n\nFrom (4,6), I can go R to (5,6), then to (5,5) on turn 56 if possible.\n\nBut let's not complicate; since (5,5) is close and urgent, I should eat it on turn 55.\n\nSimilarly for the other move.\n\nNow, the difference is that if I go U on turn 54, after eating (5,5) on turn 55, I have access to D or U or R, but not L.\n\nIf I go R on turn 54, after eating, I have access to U, L, R, but not D.\n\nBut D might be dangerous, so having L available might be better for reaching (3,6).\n\nIn the R then U case, after eating, I can go L to (4,5), then to (3,5), etc.\n\nWhereas in U then R, I cannot go L.\n\nSo for long-term, going R on turn 54 might be better to have the left option open.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nTurn 54: if I go R to (5,4), then turn 55 go U to (5,5) eat.\n\nThen at (5,5), I can go L to (4,5) since it's free.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), L to (3,5), or D to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, not possible.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nThen to reach (3,6), I can go to (3,5) then U to (3,6).\n\n(3,5) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (3,6) soon.\n\nThen (5,3) can be eaten later, but carefully.\n\nSince (5,3) has long life, I can plan a path to eat it when the tail has moved away.\n\nNow, for turn 54, I think going R to (5,4) is a good choice, then U to (5,5) on 55 to eat.\n\nThen after that, go L to (4,5) on turn 56.\n\nThen from there, to (3,5) or (4,6), etc.\n\nBut I need to plan 5 turns ahead, so turns 54 to 58 or so.\n\nAlso, the food life spans.\n\n(3,6) life 5, so on turn 54:5, 55:4, 56:3, 57:2, 58:1, 59:0 gone. So I can eat it by turn 58.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) life 8, turns 54 to 61.\n\nSo for now, on turn 54, I should go R.\n\nThen turn 55: U to (5,5) eat.\n\nThen turn 56: from (5,5), I can go L to (4,5).\n\nAfter that, on turn 57, from (4,5), I can go to (3,5) or (4,6).\n\nTo go to (3,6), I should go to (3,5) first.\n\nFrom (4,5), go L to (3,5) on turn 57.\n\nThen on turn 58, from (3,5) go U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nThat should work.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), I can think about (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) is on the other side.\n\nNow, to avoid the trap at (5,3), I need to eat it when the tail is not causing a dead end.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (6,2), but after moves, it will move.\n\nSince I eat (5,5) and (3,6), snake will grow, so it might be longer.\n\nBut I can plan later.\n\nFor now, let's output the first few moves.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for turn 54, 55, 56, etc.\n\nSince I think 5 turns ahead, I should specify up to turn 58 or 59.\n\nBut the state is for turn 54, so actions from turn 54 onward.\n\nAnswer format: Turn 54: action, Turn 55: action, etc.\n\nSo let's decide.\n\nTurn 54: Go R (right) to (5,4)\n\nTurn 55: Go U (up) to (5,5) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 56: Go L (left) to (4,5)\n\nTurn 57: Go L (left) to (3,5)\n\nTurn 58: Go U (up) to (3,6) to eat food.\n\nNow, is (3,5) free on turn 57? Let's simulate briefly.\n\nAfter turn 55: after eating (5,5), positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) tail? Positions: [ (5,5)H, (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) ] so tail at (6,2)\n\nTurn 56: go L to (4,5). (4,5) is free? Not occupied, so move to (4,5) without eating (no food there), so head to (4,5), body: (5,5) to first body, then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), and tail (6,2) moves to old seg9 (5,2)? Segments: index 0 H,1 (5,4),2 (4,4),3 (4,3),4 (3,3),5 (2,3),6 (2,2),7 (3,2),8 (4,2),9 (5,2),10 (6,2) tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,5): head to (4,5), new body: old H (5,5) to (5,5), then seg1 to old seg1 (5,4), seg2 to old seg2 (4,4), ..., up to seg9 to old seg9 (5,2), and tail moves to old seg10 (6,2)? When no eat, tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), then body: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) and tail at (6,2) is gone, new tail at (5,2)? After move, the last body segment is the one that was second last.\n\nNew body: segment 1: old H (5,5), segment 2: old seg1 (5,4), segment 3: old seg2 (4,4), segment 4: old seg3 (4,3), segment 5: old seg4 (3,3), segment 6: old seg5 (2,3), segment 7: old seg6 (2,2), segment 8: old seg7 (3,2), segment 9: old seg8 (4,2), segment 10: old seg9 (5,2), and old seg10 (6,2) is removed. So positions: [(4,5)H, (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] tail at (5,2).\n\nLength 11, tail at (5,2).\n\nNow turn 57: go L to (3,5). (3,5) is free? Not occupied, no wall, so move to (3,5) without eat.\n\nNew head (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), and tail moves to old seg10 (5,2), so new tail at (4,2)? Positions: head (3,5), body: old H (4,5), old seg1 (5,5), old seg2 (5,4), old seg3 (4,4), old seg4 (4,3), old seg5 (3,3), old seg6 (2,3), old seg7 (2,2), old seg8 (3,2), old seg9 (4,2), and old seg10 (5,2) removed. So [(3,5)H, (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] tail at (4,2).\n\nTurn 58: go U to (3,6) to eat food. (3,6) has food, so eat, grow.\n\nThen head at (3,6), etc.\n\nThis seems fine.\n\nI could have gone to eat (5,3) later, but for now, this plan eats two foods by turn 58.\n\n(5,3) can be eaten later, with life 8.\n\nIn this path, I didn't go near (5,3), so it should be safe.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, turns 54 to 58.\n\nBut I have actions for 54,55,56,57,58.\n\nIn turn 58, I eat (3,6), so it's good.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 56 I go to (4,5), which is not food, just a move.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, what about the head direction.\n\nOn turn 54, head direction is U, I go R, which is not reverse, so ok.\n\nAfter that, direction changes.\n\nBut I think this is a good plan.\n\nTo be thorough, let's consider if I go U on turn 54.\n\nIf turn 54 U to (4,5), then turn 55 R to (5,5) eat.\n\nThen at (5,5), I can go U to (5,6) or R to (6,5) or D to (5,4).\n\nIf I go U to (5,6), then I can go to (4,6) or (5,7), but y=7 wall, so not.\n\n(5,6) to (4,6), or (5,7) wall, or (6,6), etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,6), it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (5,6) to (4,6), to (3,6), but (3,6) might be eaten late.\n\nBut since life 5, it should be ok.\n\nBut with R first, I can reach (3,6) earlier.\n\nIn terms of score, both eat (5,5) and (3,6), but with R on 54, I eat (3,6) on turn 58, with U on 54, I might eat later, but within life.\n\nBut also, the grid might have constraints.\n\nWith internal obstacles, (2,4) is wall, so from left, I can go to (3,6) from below or left, but (2,4) blocks.\n\nIn my plan, going to (3,5) then U is fine.\n\nSo I think R on 54 is better for accessing left.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy involves eating the high-urgency food at (5,5) (life span 3, disappearing after turn 56) on turn 55, followed by navigating to eat the food at (3,6) (life span 5, disappearing after turn 58) on turn 58. The food at (5,3) (life span 8) is avoided for now due to the risk of trapping the snake, as moving directly to it could lead to a dead end. Instead, it can be targeted later when the tail has moved and the path is safer.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Turn 54 (Current State)**:\n  - Head at (4,4), direction U (up). Possible moves: U (to (4,5)), L (to (3,4)), R (to (5,4)). D (down) is invalid (instant reverse and body collision at (4,3)).\n  - Choosing R (right) to (5,4) sets up eating (5,5) on turn 55 and maintains access to the left for reaching (3,6).\n  \n- **Turn 55**:\n  - From (5,4), move U (up) to (5,5) to eat the food (score +1, snake grows to length 11). This is prioritized due to the short life span of (5,5).\n\n- **Turn 56**:\n  - From (5,5), move L (left) to (4,5). This avoids the body at (5,4) and positions the snake to head toward (3,6). Moving D (down) is invalid (body at (5,4)), and R (right) to (6,5) or U (up) to (5,6) are possible but less efficient for reaching (3,6).\n\n- **Turn 57**:\n  - From (4,5), move L (left) to (3,5). This continues the path toward (3,6) and avoids risks (e.g., D to (4,4) is body collision, U to (4,6) delays reaching (3,6)).\n\n- **Turn 58**:\n  - From (3,5), move U (up) to (3,6) to eat the food (score +1, snake grows to length 12). This is timed before the food disappears (life span 1 on turn 58).\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Eats High-Urgency Food**: (5,5) is eaten on turn 55 before it expires.\n- **Avoids Traps**: Moving toward (5,3) now risks a dead end (e.g., if eaten, only move to (6,3) is possible, leading to wall/body collisions). It can be eaten later (life span 8) with safer routing.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: The path uses open space, avoids obstacles (e.g., (2,4) wall), and maintains flexibility. After turn 58, the snake can explore for (5,3) or other food.\n- **5+ Turn Horizon**: The plan covers turns 54–58, eating two foods safely. Beyond this, the snake should head toward (5,3) or other areas, but this is not required for the immediate output.\n\n### Action Plan (Turns 54–58):\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: R (right)  \nTurn 55: U (up)  \nTurn 56: L (left)  \nTurn 57: L (left)  \nTurn 58: U (up)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 55, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the grid is 8x8, with cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls, so snake can only be in (1,1) to (6,6). Snake positions are given, let's list them:\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). So that's 10 segments.\n\nHead direction is R, which is right, so last move was to the right.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (5,5) with value 1, life span 2 (so disappears after 2 turns, including current turn 55, so it will be gone by turn 57? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 55, life span is 2, then turn 56 it becomes 1, turn 57 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 55 or 56.\n\n- (3,6) value 1, life span 4, so available until turn 58 (55:4, 56:3, 57:2, 58:1, 59:0 gone)\n\n- (5,3) value 1, life span 7, available longer\n\n- (5,2) value 1, life span 10\n\nBut (5,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body, specifically it's the 9th segment: positions are (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). So (5,2) is the second to last segment.\n\nFood at (5,2) is under the snake's body. According to rules, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it. Since it's not the head position now, it might be possible later.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and ensure survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a small grid for reference.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (5,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)\n\nHead direction R, so moving right.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, or R, but not L because that would be instant reverse. Current direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) next.\n\nSo at turn 55, from head (5,4), I can go:\n\n- U: to (5,5)\n\n- D: to (5,3)\n\n- R: to (6,4)\n\nBut (6,4) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles are walls, so I cannot move there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4) is listed, so (6,4) is a wall, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) are walls.\n\nSo from (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,5): is this free? (5,5) has food with value 1, life span 2.\n\n- D to (5,3): (5,3) has food with value 1, life span 7.\n\n- R to (6,4): but (6,4) is a wall, so cannot move there.\n\n- L to (4,4): but (4,4) is the body segment, and moving left would be opposite to current direction R? Current direction is R, so moving L is instant reverse, which is not allowed. So cannot move L.\n\nTherefore, only possible moves at turn 55 are U to (5,5) or D to (5,3).\n\nNow, both have positive food, so I need to think long-term.\n\nFirst, let's check if moving to (5,5) or (5,3) causes any immediate collision.\n\n(5,5): is it occupied? Snake positions: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). (5,5) is not in the list, so not occupied by body. And no wall there, so safe to move.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3): not in snake positions, no wall, has food.\n\nBut food at (5,3) has longer life span, so less urgent.\n\nFood at (5,5) has life span 2, so only available this turn and next.\n\nLife span 2 at turn 55, so if not eaten now, it might disappear soon.\n\nTurn 55: life span 2, after this turn, if not eaten, life span decreases to 1 at turn 56, so can be eaten on turn 56.\n\nBut I need to see if I can reach it.\n\nNow, also, there's food at (3,6) and (5,2), but (5,2) is under snake body.\n\n(5,2) is occupied by snake, so cannot eat now; must wait for body to move away.\n\nSimilarly, tail is at (6,2), head is at (5,4).\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving to (5,5) at turn 55.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), I eat the food there, score +1, snake grows to 11 segments.\n\nNew positions: head moves to (5,5), and tail moves? When snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move, new position added.\n\nAfter eating, snake positions: new head at (5,5), then previous head (5,4) becomes body, so [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)]? No.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: (5,4) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (3,3), 4: (2,3), 5: (2,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (5,2), 9: (6,2) tail.\n\nAfter moving U to (5,5) and eating, head is at (5,5), and since it ate, a new segment is added, so the tail stays, so positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) — that's 11 positions? Original 10 segments, after eating, 11 segments.\n\nList: new head (5,5), then segment 0 becomes body: (5,4), then segment 1: (4,4), segment 2: (4,3), segment 3: (3,3), segment 4: (2,3), segment 5: (2,2), segment 6: (3,2), segment 7: (4,2), segment 8: (5,2), segment 9: (6,2). So yes, 11 segments, tail at (6,2).\n\nHead direction now is U, since I moved up.\n\nNow, from here, I need to plan next moves.\n\nBut I also have the option to move D to (5,3) at turn 55.\n\nFirst, let's consider the U move.\n\nAfter turn 55, head at (5,5), direction U.\n\nAvailable moves: since direction U, I can go U, L, R, but not D (down, opposite).\n\nNow, (5,5) is at y=5, so U to (5,6): is this valid? y=6, but walls at y=7? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is playable? y from 0 to 7, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 are free, except internal walls.\n\ny=6 is free, no internal wall at (5,6), I think.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,6) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, L from (5,5) to (4,5), or R to (6,5).\n\n(6,5): is it wall? Internal obstacles have (6,4) and (6,1), but (6,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\nNow, food available: (3,6) with life span 4, (5,3) with life span 7, (5,2) under body with life span 10.\n\n(5,2) is still under snake body? After moving to (5,5), the body segments are (5,4), (4,4), etc., and (5,2) is still there as segment 8 or so.\n\nIn new positions, (5,2) is still occupied, so food there cannot be eaten yet.\n\nI need to move such that the body moves away from (5,2) at some point.\n\nBut life span is 10, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) has food, which I could have eaten if I moved down, but I didn't in this scenario.\n\nBack to turn 55 decision.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), I eat that food, but it has only life span 2, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon.\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), I eat that food instead.\n\nBut (5,3) has longer life span, so less urgent.\n\nAlso, there's the food at (5,5) which might disappear if not eaten soon.\n\nLife span: at turn 55, (5,5) life span 2, so if not eaten on turn 55 or 56, it's gone.\n\n(5,3) life span 7, so I have until turn 61 or so to eat it.\n\nTurn 55: life span 7, so after turn 55, it becomes 6, and so on, until life span 0 at turn 62? Let's calculate.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn t, food has life span L, it can be eaten on turn t when L >=1, after eaten or when L=0, it disappears.\n\nAt turn 55, (5,5) L=2, so can be eaten on turn 55 or 56 (since on turn 56, L=1, can be eaten, turn 57 L=0 gone).\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) L=7, can be eaten from turn 55 to 61 (turn 55:7, 56:6, ..., 61:1, 62:0 gone).\n\n(3,6) L=4, turns 55 to 58.\n\n(5,2) L=10, turns 55 to 64.\n\nNow, if I move to (5,5) at turn 55, I eat it, score +1, snake grows.\n\nIf I don't, and go to (5,3), I eat that, but (5,5) might be lost if I can't reach it next turn.\n\nFrom (5,3), can I reach (5,5) next turn? (5,3) to (5,5) is not adjacent, it's two steps away.\n\nFrom (5,3), if I move there at turn 55, head at (5,3), direction D (since I moved down).\n\nThen at turn 56, from (5,3), I can move U, L, R, not D (opposite).\n\nU to (5,4), but (5,4) is body? After moving to (5,3) at turn 55, positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), etc.\n\nAfter eating at (5,3), new positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) — 11 segments, tail at (6,2).\n\n(5,4) is now the second segment, so it's occupied.\n\nAt turn 56, from (5,3), moving U to (5,4) would collide with body, since (5,4) is occupied by the snake body.\n\nMoving L to (4,3): (4,3) is also body, in the list, segment 3? Positions: head (5,3), segment 1: (5,4), segment 2: (4,4), segment 3: (4,3)? Original segments: after move, indices: 0: (5,3) head, 1: (5,4) (previous head), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (2,3), 6: (2,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (4,2), 9: (5,2), 10: (6,2) tail.\n\nSo (4,3) is segment 3, occupied.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves at turn 56:\n\n- U to (5,4): occupied by segment 1, collision\n\n- D to (5,2): but (5,2) is segment 9, occupied, collision\n\n- L to (4,3): (4,3) is segment 3, occupied\n\n- R to (6,3): (6,3) might be free? Let's see.\n\n(6,3): not in snake positions, not a wall? Walls: internal obstacles (6,4), (5,1), etc., (6,3) not listed, and borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,3) should be free.\n\nx=6, y=3, x=6 is not border? x=7 is wall, x=0 wall, so x=6 is playable? Border cells: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are free, except internal walls.\n\nInternal walls: (6,4) is wall, (6,1) is wall, but (6,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is tail, but we are moving to (6,3), which is different cell.\n\nSo from (5,3), moving R to (6,3) is possible.\n\nThen at turn 56, if I move R to (6,3), no food there, so snake moves, tail moves away from (6,2).\n\nBut in this case, at turn 55, if I move D to (5,3), I eat the food there, but then I cannot reach (5,5) easily, and since (5,5) has only until turn 56, I might miss it.\n\nFrom (5,3) at turn 55, after eating, at turn 56, if I move to (6,3), then head at (6,3).\n\nThen from there, to reach (5,5), I need to go up and left, but (5,5) is at (5,5), from (6,3) to (5,5) is not adjacent, I need two moves, but on turn 56, head at (6,3), then turn 57 I can move, say U to (6,4), but (6,4) is a wall! Internal obstacle at (6,4), cannot move there.\n\nFrom (6,3), possible moves: direction after moving R? At turn 56, after moving R from (5,3), direction is R.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can move U, D, or R, not L.\n\nU to (6,4): wall, cannot.\n\nD to (6,2): but (6,2) is tail? After moving to (6,3) at turn 56, the snake moves, so positions: head to (6,3), then body: since no eat, tail moves away.\n\nAt turn 56, if no eat, snake moves to (6,3), and tail (6,2) is removed, so new positions: head (6,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) — 10 segments, tail at (5,2)? Let's see: from previous after turn 55: head (5,3), segments (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)\n\nAfter moving to (6,3) at turn 56, no eat, so head to (6,3), then the body follows: first body to (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), and tail (6,2) is removed, so positions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) — that's 11? No, after turn 55, with eat, 11 segments. Then at turn 56, if no eat, head moves to new position, tail is removed, so back to 10 segments.\n\nAfter turn 55 eat at (5,3): positions 11 segments: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)\n\nAt turn 56, move to (6,3), no food there, so new head (6,3), then first body to (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), and tail (6,2) removed. So 10 segments: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) — that's 10, tail at (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is now the tail.\n\nFood at (5,2) is under the tail, but since tail is moving, it might be eatable soon.\n\nBut back to reaching (5,5).\n\nFrom (6,3) at turn 56, I can move:\n\n- U to (6,4): wall, cannot\n\n- D to (6,2): (6,2) is not occupied now, but is it wall? (6,2) not internal obstacle, borders x=6 not wall, y=2 not wall, so should be free. But in previous positions, it was tail, but after move, it's free.\n\n- R to (7,3): x=7 is wall, cannot\n\n- L to (5,3): but (5,3) is now body segment, occupied, collision.\n\nAfter move to (6,3), positions: head (6,3), then (5,3), (5,4), etc. so (5,3) is occupied.\n\nSo from (6,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: (6,4) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (6,2) free? Let's assume no wall, not occupied.\n\n- R: (7,3) wall, invalid\n\n- L: (5,3) occupied, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,2).\n\nThen at turn 56, move to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) has food? Food at (5,2) is different.\n\n(6,2) might have food, but in food list, (5,2) has food, not (6,2), so no food at (6,2).\n\nSo move to (6,2), no eat.\n\nThen positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) — 10 segments, tail at (5,2)? Let's list: after move to (6,2), head (6,2), then body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), and tail removed from (5,2)? Previous tail was (5,2), but when head moves to (6,2), the body moves: first body to (6,3), then (5,3), etc., and the last segment (5,2) is removed, so positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — that's 10 segments, tail at (4,2).\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nTo simplify, from (6,3) at turn 56, only possible move is D to (6,2), then at turn 57, head at (6,2), direction D.\n\nThen I can move L to (5,2) or R to (7,2) wall, or U to (6,3) but (6,3) is body now, or D to (6,1) wall.\n\n(6,1) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nSo from (6,2), possible moves:\n\n- L to (5,2): (5,2) has food, but is it occupied? After moving to (6,2), positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), etc., (5,2) is not in the body, it was removed earlier.\n\nIn the list above, positions are (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), so (5,2) is free now.\n\nAnd (5,2) has food with value 1, so I can eat it by moving L to (5,2) at turn 57.\n\nBut there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nAt turn 57, if I move to (5,2), what is the tail?\n\nPositions: head at (6,2), tail at (4,2) in my list, but let's confirm.\n\nAfter turn 56 move to (6,2): segments: 0: (6,2) head, 1: (6,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,3), 6: (3,3), 7: (2,3), 8: (2,2), 9: (3,2), 10: (4,2) tail? Indices: 0 head, 1 to 9 body, 10 tail.\n\nBut in terms of cells, tail is at (4,2).\n\nHead at (6,2), tail at (4,2), not adjacent; (6,2) and (4,2) are not adjacent, distance 2 in x, same y.\n\nAdjacent means sharing a side, so (6,2) and (5,2) are adjacent, but (5,2) is the cell we're moving to, not the tail.\n\nTail is at (4,2), which is not adjacent to (5,2) or (6,2) directly? (4,2) and (5,2) are adjacent.\n\nBut the rule is: if head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has food, eating that food kills the snake.\n\nHere, at turn 57, before moving, head is at (6,2), tail at (4,2), not adjacent.\n\nI move to (5,2), which has food, and after eating, the snake grows, so new tail is the old tail, which is at (4,2), and head at (5,2), so they are adjacent, but the food is at (5,2), not at the tail cell.\n\nThe rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nIn this case, when I eat at (5,2), the tail cell is (4,2), which may or may not have food. Currently, no food at (4,2), so it should be fine.\n\nAfter eating, head at (5,2), new segment added, so tail remains at (4,2), and head at (5,2) are adjacent, but since no food at tail cell, no problem.\n\nThe danger is only if the tail cell itself has food and head is adjacent, eating that specific food.\n\nHere, I'm eating at (5,2), not at tail.\n\nSo moving to (5,2) should be safe.\n\nBut in this path, I missed the food at (5,5) because I went down at turn 55.\n\nBack to turn 55 choice.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5) at turn 55, I eat it, then head at (5,5), direction U.\n\nThen at turn 56, I need to move.\n\nFrom (5,5), direction U, I can go U, L, R.\n\nU to (5,6): free, no food.\n\nL to (4,5): free? Let's check if occupied or wall.\n\nWalls: internal (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (4,5) not wall.\n\nSnake positions: after turn 55, head (5,5), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), so (4,5) not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, R to (6,5): (6,5) not wall, not occupied.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,6), which is close.\n\n(3,6) from (5,5) is two steps away.\n\nI can plan to go towards it.\n\nAlso, food at (5,3) is below, but might be harder to reach.\n\nSince I ate at (5,5), snake is longer.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should try to eat other foods.\n\nBut let's list all foods and their positions:\n\n- (5,5): L=2, must eat by turn 56\n\n- (3,6): L=4, eat by turn 58\n\n- (5,3): L=7, eat by turn 61\n\n- (5,2): L=10, under body, need to free it first.\n\nAt turn 55, if I move U to (5,5), I eat it, good.\n\nThen at turn 56, from (5,5), direction U.\n\nI should go towards (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), from (5,5), I can go L to (4,5), then next turn to (3,5) or (4,6), then to (3,6).\n\nBut (4,6) might be free.\n\nFirst, at turn 56, from (5,5), I can move:\n\n- U to (5,6): free\n\n- L to (4,5): free\n\n- R to (6,5): free\n\nI cannot move D, opposite to U.\n\nNow, moving L to (4,5) gets me closer to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), (4,5) to (3,6) is not adjacent, I need to go to (3,5) or (4,6) first.\n\nSay at turn 56, move L to (4,5).\n\nThen head at (4,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen at turn 57, from (4,5), direction L, can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5).\n\n(4,4) is body, occupied, so cannot move D.\n\n(4,6) free, (3,5) free.\n\nThen I can move U to (4,6) or L to (3,5).\n\nTo reach (3,6), from (4,5), moving U to (4,6), then from (4,6) to (3,6) is adjacent, move L.\n\nOr from (4,5) move L to (3,5), then to (3,6) U.\n\nBoth possible.\n\n(3,6) has food with L=4, at turn 55 L=4, turn 56 L=3, turn 57 L=2, turn 58 L=1, so can eat by turn 58.\n\nAt turn 57, if I go to (4,6) or (3,5), I can eat (3,6) at turn 58.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (5,3) is available longer.\n\nBut also, the food at (5,2) is under body, and after some moves, it might be free.\n\nCurrently, after turn 55, positions include (5,2) as body.\n\nAs snake moves, the body will move, so (5,2) will be free when the segment there moves away.\n\nIn the current positions, (5,2) is occupied by a body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (6,2).\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, the tail moves away, so after some moves, (5,2) will be free if no one is on it.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat for a few turns, the tail moves, and (5,2) becomes free, then I can eat the food there.\n\nLife span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, back to turn 55, another option is to not eat at (5,5) and go to (5,3) instead, but I might lose (5,5).\n\nBut at turn 55, from (5,4), I can move D to (5,3), eat that food, but then as I saw earlier, I cannot reach (5,5) in time because from (5,3) at turn 55, at turn 56 I can only go to (6,3), then to (6,2), and (5,5) is gone by turn 57.\n\nSo if I move D at turn 55, I eat (5,3) but lose (5,5), whereas if I move U, I eat (5,5) and can still eat (5,3) later if possible, but (5,3) has long life.\n\nBut after eating (5,5), I am at (5,5), and (5,3) is below, with body in between.\n\nFrom (5,5) at turn 56, if I go down, I cannot because direction U, I can only go U, L, R, not D. So I have to move away from (5,3).\n\nThen to reach (5,3) later, it might be tricky.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is surrounded or something.\n\nLet's see the area.\n\nGrid: let's sketch mentally.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake after turn 55 if U: head (5,5), body (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)\n\n(5,3) is not occupied, but to reach it from (5,5), I need to go down, but from (5,5) I can only go U, L, R at turn 56, not D. So I have to go to (5,6), (4,5), or (6,5).\n\nThen from there, to go down to (5,3), I need to circle around, but it might be blocked by body or walls.\n\nFor example, if I go to (4,5), then to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, occupied, so I cannot go directly down.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,6), I can go D to (5,5) but occupied, or L to (4,6), etc.\n\nIt might be difficult to reach (5,3) soon.\n\nWhereas if I eat (5,3) at turn 55, I have it, and (5,5) is lost, but (5,5) has same value, but shorter life, so eating it now is better to not miss it.\n\nAlso, there is (3,6) to eat.\n\nMoreover, the food at (5,2) can be eaten later.\n\nBut let's think about the tail danger for (5,2).\n\nFood at (5,2) is positive food, value 1.\n\nWhen I eat it, I need to make sure that the head is not adjacent to the tail at that moment, or if it is, that the tail cell doesn't have food, but since I'm eating at (5,2), the tail cell is different.\n\nThe danger is only if I eat the food at the tail cell when head is adjacent.\n\nFor (5,2), it's not the tail now.\n\nTail is at (6,2), so when (5,2) is free, I can eat it safely as long as when I move to it, the tail is not adjacent or no issue.\n\nBut to be safe, I should eat it when the tail is not close.\n\nBut life span 10, so I have time.\n\nNow, another thing: internal obstacle at (6,4) wall, so the right side is blocked.\n\nAlso, (2,4) wall, etc.\n\nBut let's focus on the immediate decision.\n\nAt turn 55, moving U to (5,5) seems better because I can eat the time-sensitive food and have access to (3,6).\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), I eat a food but lose (5,5), and get stuck in the bottom right, with limited moves.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) after eating, at turn 56, only can go to (6,3), then to (6,2), then from (6,2) I can go L to (5,2) to eat the food there, or U to (6,3) but occupied, etc., but (6,2) to (5,2) at turn 57 as I thought earlier.\n\nThen I can eat (5,2), but I miss (5,5) and (3,6) might be hard to reach from there.\n\n(3,6) is at top left, I am at bottom right.\n\nSo long-term, moving U at turn 55 allows me to eat (5,5) and then go for (3,6), which is also time-sensitive.\n\n(3,6) L=4, so by turn 58.\n\nFrom (5,5) at turn 55, at turn 56 I can move towards it.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,5) at turn 56.\n\nThen at turn 57, from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) or U to (4,6).\n\nSay move L to (3,5).\n\nThen at turn 58, from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) to eat the food.\n\n(3,6) has food, and at turn 58, L=1, so I can eat it.\n\nThen I have eaten two foods.\n\nMeanwhile, (5,3) is still there, I can try to eat it later, or not.\n\nAlso, (5,2) can be eaten when free.\n\nBut after some moves, the snake body might block.\n\nSince I ate two foods, snake is longer, 12 segments after eating (3,6).\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nNow, let's confirm the initial move.\n\nAt turn 55, only two choices: U or D.\n\nMoving R is invalid due to wall, L invalid due to reverse.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nI think U is better.\n\nThen for multiple turns, I need to plan.\n\nThe answer should include actions for turn 55, 56, 57, etc., at least 5 turns.\n\nTurn 55: action\n\nTurn 56: action\n\nTurn 57: action\n\nTurn 58: action\n\nTurn 59: action\n\nEtc.\n\nStarting from turn 55.\n\nI decide to move U to (5,5) at turn 55.\n\nThen turn 55 action: U\n\nNow, after that, positions: head (5,5), body: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) tail.\n\nDirection: U\n\nTurn 56: from (5,5), direction U, I move L to (4,5) to go towards (3,6).\n\n(4,5) is free, as established.\n\nAction: L\n\nNow head at (4,5), direction L.\n\nPositions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) — 12 segments? After turn 55 eat, 11 segments. Then at turn 56, moving to (4,5), no food there (assuming), so no eat, so head moves to (4,5), tail moves away from (6,2), so positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) — 11 segments, tail at (5,2)? List: 0: (4,5) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (2,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (5,2) tail.\n\nTail at (5,2).\n\nFood at (5,2) is under tail now? But it's the tail cell.\n\nThe food is at (5,2), and tail is at (5,2), so when tail moves, the food is revealed, but only if head moves onto it later.\n\nCurrently, at turn 56, after move, tail is at (5,2), which has food, but since tail is there, it's occupied, cannot eat yet.\n\nWhen tail moves away, (5,2) becomes free, and food is there, so I can eat it by moving head to it when free.\n\nBut now, at turn 57, from (4,5), direction L, I can move U, D, or L, not R.\n\nU to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5).\n\n(4,4) is body, segment 3, occupied, so cannot move D.\n\n(4,6) free, (3,5) free.\n\nI want to go to (3,6), so better to move L to (3,5) first.\n\nAction: L to (3,5)\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nPositions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), and tail (5,2) removed? No: after move to (3,5), no eat, so head (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), tail (5,2) removed, so positions: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — 11 segments, tail at (4,2).\n\n(5,2) is now free, and food is there, so I can eat it.\n\nBut at turn 58, I plan to eat (3,6).\n\nFirst, turn 58 from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) to eat the food there.\n\n(3,6) has food, value 1.\n\nAction: U\n\nThen head to (3,6), eat, grow to 12 segments.\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), and since eat, tail stays, so tail at (4,2) still? After eat, new segment added, so positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — 12 segments, tail at (4,2).\n\nNow, I have eaten (5,5) and (3,6), and (5,2) is free with food.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is not occupied now, since tail is at (4,2), etc.\n\nI can go to eat (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is at (5,2), I am at (3,6).\n\nFrom (3,6), direction U, I can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (3,7): but y=7 wall, cannot.\n\nL to (2,6): (2,6) might be free? Walls: internal (2,4) is wall, but (2,6) not listed, so should be free.\n\nR to (4,6): free.\n\nD is opposite, cannot.\n\nSo move, say, R to (4,6) or L to (2,6).\n\nBut to go to (5,2), I need to go down and right.\n\n(5,2) is at bottom.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,3), but (5,3) is free? After all moves, (5,3) is not occupied, I think.\n\nPositions: head (3,6), body down to (4,2), so (5,3) is not in the list, so free.\n\nBut (5,3) has food.\n\nNow, to maximize, I can eat (5,2) or (5,3).\n\n(5,2) is closer to current tail, but let's see.\n\nSince I need to plan 5 turns, from turn 55 to 59 or so.\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: L (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 57: L (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 58: U (to (3,6), eat)\n\nNow turn 59: from (3,6), direction U, I need to move.\n\nI can move R to (4,6) for example.\n\nAction: R to (4,6)\n\nThen head at (4,6), direction R.\n\nThen from there, I can go down, but need to avoid walls and body.\n\nFor example, at turn 60, from (4,6), direction R, I can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,7) wall, cannot.\n\nD to (4,5), but (4,5) is body? After turn 59 move to (4,6), positions: head to (4,6), no eat (assuming no food), so tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions: after turn 58 eat, head (3,6), segments (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nAfter move to (4,6) at turn 59, no eat, so head (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), and tail (3,2) removed? Segments: 0 head (4,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (5,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,2), and (3,2) was tail, removed, so positions: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — 11 segments, tail at (2,2).\n\n(4,5) is segment 3, occupied.\n\nFrom (4,6), at turn 59, I can move:\n\n- U: (4,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (4,5) occupied, invalid\n\n- R: (5,6) free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\n- L: (3,6) occupied, invalid (since segment 1)\n\nSo only possible move is R to (5,6).\n\nAction: R to (5,6)\n\nThen at turn 60, head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nThen I can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (5,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (5,5), but (5,5) is segment 4, occupied.\n\nR to (6,6): free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\nSo move R to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is close to wall, but free.\n\nThen from there, I can try to go down to (5,2) or (5,3).\n\nBut (5,2) has food, (5,3) has food.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which might be reachable.\n\nFrom (6,6), I can move D to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut let's stop here for the plan.\n\nIn this path, I ate two foods by turn 58.\n\nIf I had gone down at turn 55, I might have eaten only one or two, but missed (3,6).\n\nSo U is better.\n\nAlso, for the food at (5,2), after it was freed, I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is available.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nSince the state is at turn 55, I need to specify actions starting from turn 55.\n\nAnd for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to think ahead but output the actions.\n\nI think for turn 55, action U.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, based on the plan.\n\nBut since the future depends, I need to specify a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can output for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: L (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 57: L (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 58: U (to (3,6), eat)\n\nThen turn 59: from (3,6), I moved R to (4,6), but in the sequence.\n\nIn turn 59, I need to specify.\n\nSince after turn 58, head at (3,6), direction U, and I said move R to (4,6).\n\nThen turn 60: move R to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to go further for now.\n\nThe core is to survive and eat.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (3,5) at turn 57, (5,2) becomes free, but I don't eat it immediately because I go to (3,6) first.\n\n(5,2) has life span 10, so at turn 55 L=10, turn 56 L=9, turn 57 L=8, etc., so by turn 64, I have time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) L=7, by turn 61.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), I can head down.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide the actions.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn 55, move U.\n\nIn the food list, there is (5,3) with value 1, but I didn't eat it, but it's fine.\n\nAlso, tail danger: when I moved, no issue.\n\nSo I think U is the best.\n\nTherefore, for turn 55: U\n\nThen for the sequence:\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: L (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 57: L (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 58: U (to (3,6))\n\nThen for turn 59, from (3,6), move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 60: from (4,6) to (5,6) or something, but since it's 5+ turns, I can do up to turn 59 or 60.\n\nThe format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output actions starting from current turn.\n\nIn answer, it should be multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: 55 to 59.\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: L\n\nTurn 57: L\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: R (to (4,6))\n\nIn turn 59, I moved R, which is to the right.\n\nNow, to be precise.\n\nSince after turn 58, I ate (3,6), and head at (3,6), I need to move away.\n\nMoving R to (4,6) is fine.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, this should be sufficient.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is a better path.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 55, move U, then at turn 56, instead of L, move U to (5,6), then to (4,6), but that might not be closer to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is at x=3, y=6, from (5,6) I can move L to (4,6), then to (3,6).\n\nBut similar.\n\nBut moving L at turn 56 is direct.\n\nIn my plan, I have turn 56 L to (4,5), which is at y=5, then to (3,5) y=5, then to (3,6).\n\nIf I go to (5,6) first, it's farther.\n\nSo my plan is fine.\n\nTherefore, the actions:\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating time-sensitive positive food, especially the food at (5,5) with a life span of 2 (available only until turn 56). Moving up (U) at turn 55 allows eating this food immediately. After that, the AI should target the food at (3,6) with a life span of 4 (available until turn 58) by moving left (L) for two turns to reach (3,5), then up (U) to eat it at turn 58. This sequence eats two high-value foods quickly while avoiding risks.\n\nThe food at (5,3) (life span 7) and (5,2) (life span 10) can be targeted later, as they are less urgent. Moving to (5,2) requires freeing it from under the snake's body first, which happens naturally as the tail moves away after turn 57. The plan avoids collisions and walls by carefully selecting moves based on the snake's direction and grid constraints.\n\n### Planned Actions (5 Turns Ahead)\n- **Turn 55**: Move U (up) to (5,5) to eat the positive food there (life span 2, must eat now to avoid loss). Score increases by 1, snake length becomes 11.\n- **Turn 56**: Move L (left) to (4,5) to approach (3,6). No food eaten, snake length remains 11.\n- **Turn 57**: Move L (left) to (3,5) to continue toward (3,6). No food eaten, snake length remains 11.\n- **Turn 58**: Move U (up) to (3,6) to eat the positive food there (life span 4, last chance to eat). Score increases by 1, snake length becomes 12.\n- **Turn 59**: Move R (right) to (4,6) to avoid walls and body collisions, positioning for future food opportunities (e.g., (5,3) or (5,2)). No food eaten, snake length remains 12.\n\n### Reasoning Details\n- **Turn 55 (U)**: \n  - Only U or D are valid (R blocked by wall at (6,4); L invalid due to instant reverse from current direction R).\n  - U eats (5,5) (value +1), preventing loss from short life span. D eats (5,3) but risks missing (5,5), which disappears after turn 56.\n  - After move: Head at (5,5), direction U, snake positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)].\n- **Turn 56 (L)**:\n  - From (5,5), direction U, possible moves: U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5) (all safe; D invalid).\n  - L chosen to minimize distance to (3,6). (4,5) is free (no wall or body).\n  - After move: Head at (4,5), direction L, snake positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] (tail at (5,2)).\n- **Turn 57 (L)**:\n  - From (4,5), direction L, possible moves: U to (4,6), L to (3,5) (both safe; D to (4,4) invalid due to body; R invalid).\n  - L to (3,5) chosen for direct path to (3,6). (3,5) is free.\n  - After move: Head at (3,5), direction L, snake positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] (tail at (4,2); (5,2) now free with food).\n- **Turn 58 (U)**:\n  - From (3,5), direction L, possible moves: U to (3,6), L to (2,5) (both safe; D to (3,4) not considered due to path; R invalid).\n  - U to (3,6) eats food (value +1), last chance before life span ends. (3,6) is free.\n  - After move: Head at (3,6), direction U, snake positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] (length 12).\n- **Turn 59 (R)**:\n  - From (3,6), direction U, possible moves: L to (2,6), R to (4,6) (both safe; U to (3,7) invalid wall; D invalid).\n  - R to (4,6) chosen to avoid dead ends and explore toward remaining food (e.g., (5,3) or (5,2)). (4,6) is free.\n  - After move: Head at (4,6), direction R, snake positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)] (tail at (2,2)).\n\n### Long-Term Considerations\n- **Food at (5,2)**: Now free and can be eaten by moving to (5,2) when feasible (e.g., from (4,6) or nearby cells). Life span 10 allows time (until turn 64).\n- **Food at (5,3)**: Can be targeted after turn 59 (life span 7, until turn 61). Path: e.g., from (4,6) move to (5,6), then down to (5,5) but must avoid body—wait for tail to move or find safe route.\n- **Risks Avoided**: \n  - No wall or body collisions in the plan.\n  - Tail reward danger not triggered: When eating (5,2) later, ensure head not adjacent to tail at that cell (not an issue here as tail is distant).\n- **Survival Priority**: The plan secures 2 points quickly, opens space for growth, and positions the snake to access other foods with minimal risk.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 55\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59\\text{: R} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 56. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) since x and y go from 0 to 7, but walls are at the borders, so the grid is 6x6 internally? Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), and (0,7) to (7,7) are walls. Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So the snake can only be on cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6, except where there are obstacles.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,5), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). So the snake is 11 segments long.\n\nHead direction is U, which is up, so last move was up to (5,5) from (5,4)? Positions are listed head first, so (5,5) is head, then (5,4) is the first body segment, which was the previous head position. Since head direction is U, it moved up to (5,5).\n\nNow food:\n\n- (3,6) with value 1, life span 3\n\n- (5,3) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (5,2) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll are positive food since value is +1. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span means how many turns left, including current turn, so for (3,6), life span 3, so it disappears after 3 turns, meaning on turn 58 or something. Let's see: current turn is 56, life span decreases each turn, so after turn 56, it has 2 left; after turn 57, 1 left; after turn 58, it disappears. Similarly for others.\n\n(5,2) has life span 9, so it will be around for many turns.\n\nBut (5,2) is also a snake position! Snake positions include (5,2), which is the 10th segment? Let's list snake positions with indices:\n\nIndex 0: head (5,5)\n\nIndex 1: (5,4)\n\nIndex 2: (4,4)\n\nIndex 3: (4,3)\n\nIndex 4: (3,3)\n\nIndex 5: (2,3)\n\nIndex 6: (2,2)\n\nIndex 7: (3,2)\n\nIndex 8: (4,2)\n\nIndex 9: (5,2)\n\nIndex 10: (6,2)\n\nAnd food at (5,2) is listed. But (5,2) is occupied by the snake body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, I need to find possible moves from current position.\n\nCurrent head at (5,5), direction U (up). Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut cannot move opposite to current direction immediately. Current direction is U, so opposite is D, so cannot move down next.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n\nLet's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo cells to avoid:\n\n- Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n\n- Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow, snake body occupies: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)\n\nFood at: (3,6), (5,3), (5,2)\n\n(5,2) is occupied by snake, so cannot be eaten now.\n\n(5,3) is a food position, but is it occupied? Snake has positions: (4,3) is index 3, (3,3) index 4, etc. (5,3) is not in the snake positions? Let's see: positions are (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), ... so (5,3) is not listed, so it should be free, but there's food there.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) should be free.\n\nNow, from head (5,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up (U): to (5,6)\n\n- Down (D): to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied by snake body index 1, so moving there would collide with body.\n\n- Left (L): to (4,5)\n\n- Right (R): to (6,5)\n\nNow, check each:\n\n(5,6): y=6, which is within 1-6? y=6 is playable, since walls at y=7 and y=0. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is not wall, it's the top row but not wall. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are free, except obstacles. No obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is free? But is it a wall? Border walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is not a wall. Similarly x=6 is not wall, x=7 is.\n\n(5,6): x=5, y=6. Is there obstacle? Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (5,6) not among them. Snake body: positions don't include (5,6), head is at (5,5), body at (5,4), etc., so (5,6) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5): x=4, y=5. No wall, no obstacle listed, snake positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (4,4), etc., not (4,5), so free.\n\n(6,5): x=6, y=5. Walls: x=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall. Obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1) are obstacles, but (6,5) not listed, so should be free? (6,5) is not in obstacle list, obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (6,5) is not obstacle. Snake positions: (6,2) is tail, but not (6,5), so (6,5) should be free.\n\nBut down to (5,4) is occupied by body, so invalid.\n\nAlso, cannot move down because it's opposite direction? Current direction is U, so moving D would be opposite, which is not allowed. So down is invalid anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survival.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (3,6) at (3,6), value +1, life span 3, so after turn 56, it has 2 turns left (turn 57 and 58? Life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 56, life span 3, meaning it can be eaten on turn 56,57,58? After eaten or after life span, it disappears.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo for (3,6), life span 3 at turn 56:\n\n- After turn 56, if not eaten, life span becomes 2\n\n- After turn 57, life span becomes 1\n\n- After turn 58, life span becomes 0, disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turn 56,57, or 58.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) life span 6, so at turn 56, can be eaten up to turn 61.\n\n(5,2) life span 9, up to turn 64.\n\nBut (5,2) is under snake body, so it can only be eaten if snake moves away and head comes back.\n\nNow, tail is at (6,2), and food is at (5,2), which is the second last segment? Positions: index 9 is (5,2), index 10 is (6,2) tail.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail moves, so if it moves, the tail leaves (6,2), and a new segment is added if food eaten, but only if head eats food.\n\nAlso, the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is at (6,2), food is at (5,2), which is not tail, it's the segment before tail. Tail is (6,2), and (5,2) is the 9th segment, not tail.\n\nThe danger is only if the food is on the tail cell itself, I think. Let me read.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nSo it's about the tail cell having food, and head adjacent to tail.\n\nHere, tail is at (6,2), and food is at (5,2), which is not the tail cell. The tail cell is (6,2), which has no food. Food is at (5,2), so not an issue for now.\n\nTo eat (5,2), the snake needs to move so that (5,2) is vacated, then head can move to it later.\n\nBut (5,2) has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, back to current moves.\n\nPossible actions: U, L, R\n\nNow, let's think about goals.\n\nI need to eat food to grow and score, but avoid risks.\n\nFood at (3,6) is close and has short life, only 3 turns left including current, so if I don't eat it soon, it will disappear.\n\n(5,3) is also close, life span 6.\n\n(5,2) is under body, need to free it first.\n\nBut (5,2) has long life, so less urgent.\n\nAlso, I need to survive, so avoid trapping myself.\n\nCurrent position: head at (5,5), body around.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid rows y=6 top to y=1 bottom, x=1 left to x=6 right? Typically, y increases up, but in coordinates, (x,y), with U increasing y.\n\nIn the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y increases up.\n\nSo let's think y=6 top, y=1 bottom.\n\nx=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nWalls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so boundaries.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (5,5) which is x=5,y=5.\n\nBody: (5,4) below, (4,4) left-down, (4,3) down, (3,3) left, (2,3) left, (2,2) down, (3,2) right, (4,2) right, (5,2) right, (6,2) right.\n\nSo the snake is coiled around.\n\nFood: (3,6) at x=3,y=6 top, (5,3) at x=5,y=3, which is below, and (5,2) at x=5,y=2, which is occupied.\n\n(5,3) is at y=3, which is above (5,2) and below (5,4).\n\nNow, from (5,5), moving U to (5,6): that's the top row, y=6.\n\n(5,6) is free, as we said.\n\nMoving L to (4,5): left, which might be towards (3,6)\n\nMoving R to (6,5): right.\n\n(6,5) might be near the obstacle at (6,4), but (6,5) is free.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, after moving, the snake direction changes.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (5,6), then head is at (5,6), direction U.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U to (5,7) but y=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nD to (5,5) but (5,5) is now body, since head moved, so occupied.\n\nL to (4,6)\n\nR to (6,6)\n\n(4,6) and (6,6) should be free, assuming no obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,6) is different.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) not obstacle.\n\nIf I move L to (4,5) from current, then head at (4,5), direction L.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), but (4,4) is body, occupied, L to (3,5), R to (5,5) body occupied.\n\n(4,4) is index 2, body, so D to (4,4) invalid.\n\nR to (5,5) is now body, invalid.\n\nSo from (4,5), possible U to (4,6) or L to (3,5)\n\nSimilarly for R to (6,5): head at (6,5), direction R.\n\nThen from there, U to (6,6), D to (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle, invalid, L to (5,5) body, R to (7,5) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (6,6) possible? D to (6,4) is obstacle, L to (5,5) is body, R to (7,5) wall, U to (6,6) should be free.\n\n(6,6) x=6,y=6, not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake at (6,2), not (6,6), so yes.\n\nBut if I move R now to (6,5), then next move only U to (6,6), which might be risky, as I could be trapped.\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (5,6) might be better for reaching (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), which is left-top.\n\nFrom current (5,5), moving L to (4,5) is closer to (3,6).\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6) or L to (3,5).\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), so from (4,5), U to (4,6) then next to (3,6) or something.\n\nLet's think how to reach (3,6).\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- If I go L to (4,5), then from (4,5) I can go U to (4,6), then from (4,6) I can go L to (3,6) to eat it.\n\n(3,6) is food, so if head moves to (3,6), it eats it.\n\nNow, time: at turn 56, if I move L to (4,5), turn 56.\n\nThen turn 57, from (4,5) move U to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 58, from (4,6) move L to (3,6) to eat.\n\nBut life span of (3,6) is 3 at turn 56.\n\nAfter turn 56, if not eaten, life span decreases to 2.\n\nOn turn 57, life span 2, if eaten on turn 57, it's ok.\n\nOn turn 58, life span 1, if eaten, still ok.\n\nOn turn 59, it would be gone, but we can eat by turn 58.\n\nWith this plan: turn 56: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 57: from (4,5), move U to (4,6) — now head at (4,6), direction U? From (4,5) to (4,6) is U, so direction U.\n\nThen turn 58: from (4,6), move L to (3,6), which is left, direction L, to eat the food.\n\nNow, when I eat at (3,6) on turn 58, snake grows, so new tail added.\n\nBut is this safe?\n\nFirst, from (4,6), moving L to (3,6), (3,6) should be free, no obstacle, not wall, and not snake body at that time.\n\nNow, when I move, the snake body moves.\n\nLet's simulate the snake positions.\n\nCurrent turn 56: snake positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)]\n\nAfter move L to (4,5): head moves to (4,5), and each segment follows, so tail (6,2) is removed, and new head at (4,5), body: (5,5) becomes segment 1, (5,4) seg2, (4,4) seg3, (4,3) seg4, (3,3) seg5, (2,3) seg6, (2,2) seg7, (3,2) seg8, (4,2) seg9, (5,2) seg10. Tail was (6,2), which is removed, so new positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] — 11 segments, no growth.\n\nNow turn 57: move U to (4,6)\n\nHead to (4,6), body follows: new positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] — tail (5,2) removed.\n\nNow turn 58: move L to (3,6) to eat food.\n\n(3,6) has food, value +1, so snake grows.\n\nNew head at (3,6), body: previous head (4,6) becomes segment 1, and so on, and tail not removed, so new segment added.\n\nPositions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), and since food eaten, the tail (4,2) is not removed, so we add a new segment at the tail position? When food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nStandard snake: when head eats food, the tail stays, so new position: head moves to new cell, body follows, but since food eaten, no tail removed, so length increases by one.\n\nSo after eating, positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] — 12 segments, with (4,2) as tail.\n\n(4,2) is tail now.\n\nNow, this seems fine, and I ate the food before it expires.\n\nBut is there risk? (3,6) is at top-left, and after eating, head at (3,6), which is corner, but I can move from there.\n\nFor example, from (3,6), I can go D to (3,5) or L to (2,6) or R to (4,6) but (4,6) is body now.\n\nAfter turn 58, positions: head (3,6), body: (4,6), (4,5), etc.\n\nSo from (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5)\n\nL to (2,6)\n\nR to (4,6) but (4,6) is body, occupied, invalid.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\n(2,6) might be free? x=2,y=6, not wall, obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,6) not, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly (3,5) should be free.\n\nBut I need to think beyond.\n\nPerhaps eating (5,3) is easier or safer.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is below.\n\nCurrent head (5,5), food at (5,3).\n\nBut to reach it, I need to go down, but current direction U, cannot move D immediately.\n\nAlso, (5,4) is directly below, occupied.\n\nIf I go to (5,6) first, then I can come down later.\n\nBut (5,3) has life span 6, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is under body, need to free it.\n\nBut let's see if moving U or R is better.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,2) is on the body, specifically at (5,2), which is index 9 in current positions.\n\nWhen the snake moves, this segment will move eventually.\n\nFor example, if I move away, after a few moves, (5,2) might be vacated.\n\nBut since it's not the tail, it takes time for the tail to move away.\n\nCurrent tail is (6,2).\n\nThe segment at (5,2) will move when the snake moves.\n\nFor instance, if I move, the tail leaves, but (5,2) is not tail, so it stays until the movement propagates.\n\nLet me think about freeing (5,2).\n\n(5,2) has food, but it's occupied, so to eat it, I need the snake to move so that (5,2) is no longer occupied, then head can move to it.\n\nCurrently, (5,2) is segment 9.\n\nThe snake moves one step each turn, so after 9 moves, this segment might be gone, but the position changes.\n\nEach move, the head moves, and the tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSo to free (5,2), I need the tail to pass through it or something, but it's not efficient.\n\nSince the snake is long, it might take many moves to free that cell.\n\nBut (5,2) has long life span, 9 turns, so it can wait.\n\nNow, back to immediate choice.\n\nI should go for (3,6) since it expires soon.\n\nWith the plan: turn 56: L to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 57: U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 58: L to (3,6) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 58, when I move L to (3,6), I eat, and it's safe.\n\nThen from there, head at (3,6), and I need to move, say D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n\n(3,5) should be free now? After the move, positions: as above, after eating, segments include (3,3), (2,3), etc., but (3,5) not occupied.\n\nSimilarly (2,6) not occupied.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (2,4), but (2,6) is different.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (1,2), but (2,6) is top.\n\nNow, what about (5,3)? I can eat it later.\n\nIf I don't go for (3,6), it might disappear.\n\nAnother option: from (5,5), move U to (5,6), then to (4,6) or something to reach (3,6).\n\nBut similar.\n\nMove U to (5,6) on turn 56.\n\nThen turn 57, from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 58, from (4,6) move L to (3,6) to eat.\n\nSame as before, but I started with U instead of L.\n\nIn first plan, turn 56 L to (4,5), turn 57 U to (4,6), turn 58 L to (3,6).\n\nWith U first: turn 56 U to (5,6), turn 57 L to (4,6), turn 58 L to (3,6).\n\nIn both cases, I eat on turn 58.\n\nBut in the first, after turn 56, I am at (4,5), which might be better positioned for other things.\n\n(4,5) is closer to center.\n\nBut let's see the food at (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is at y=3, which is below.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), I can go down to eat (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) might be eaten by others? No, only one snake.\n\n(5,3) has life span 6, so at turn 56, it can be eaten up to turn 61.\n\nAfter turn 58, I am at (3,6), then I can go to (3,5), then (3,4), etc., but (3,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 58, positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\n(4,3) is occupied, (3,3) occupied, etc.\n\nFrom (3,6), move D to (3,5), which should be free.\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction D.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move D to (3,4), or L to (2,5), or R to (4,5) but (4,5) is body? After moving to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), then (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), ... let's list: after move D to (3,5), no food, so tail removed.\n\nPrevious positions: before move, at turn 58 after eat: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nTail is (4,2).\n\nMove D to (3,5): head to (3,5), body follows, so new positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)] — tail (4,2) removed, and (3,2) is new tail? Segments: head (3,5), then previous head (3,6) now seg1, (4,6) seg2, (4,5) seg3, (5,5) seg4, (5,4) seg5, (4,4) seg6, (4,3) seg7, (3,3) seg8, (2,3) seg9, (2,2) seg10, (3,2) seg11. Tail was (4,2) removed.\n\n(3,2) is now tail.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (3,4) or (2,5) or (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is seg3, occupied.\n\n(3,4) should be free? Not in positions, not obstacle.\n\n(2,5) should be free.\n\nObstacles at (2,4) and (1,2), but (2,5) not.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut I want to go to (5,3) for food.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (4,5) but occupied, or to (3,4) then to (4,4) etc., but it might take time.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, I can go for (5,3) directly, but I cannot move down now.\n\nAnother idea: move R to (6,5) first.\n\nBut (6,5) is near obstacle.\n\nIf I move R to (6,5) on turn 56.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction R.\n\nThen from there, only possible move U to (6,6), since D to (6,4) obstacle, L to (5,5) body, R wall.\n\nSo turn 57: move U to (6,6)\n\nThen from (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7) wall, D to (6,5) body, L to (5,6), R to (7,6) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 58: to (5,6), then I can go to (4,6) or (5,7) invalid, etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,6), I need more turns, and (3,6) might expire.\n\nFor example, from (5,6) on turn 58, move L to (4,6), then turn 59 to (3,6), but on turn 59, (3,6) has life span: at turn 56, life span 3, turn 57:2, turn 58:1, turn 59:0, disappears, so on turn 59 it is gone, cannot eat.\n\nLife span decreases after each turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 56: life span 3, can be eaten on turn 56,57,58.\n\nTurn 59 it disappears.\n\nIn this path, if I go to (6,5) on turn 56, (6,6) on 57, (5,6) on 58, then on turn 59 I can go to (4,6) or (3,6), but (3,6) is only available up to turn 58, so on turn 59 it's gone, I cannot eat it.\n\nThus, if I go right first, I miss (3,6).\n\nTherefore, going left or up directly is better to catch (3,6).\n\nNow, between L and U from (5,5).\n\nIf I go U to (5,6) on turn 56.\n\nThen turn 57, I can move L to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 58, move L to (3,6) to eat.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I go L to (4,5) on turn 56, then U to (4,6) on 57, then L to (3,6) on 58.\n\nIn both cases, I eat on turn 58.\n\nNow, after eating, with first method: after turn 56 U to (5,6), positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), (5,4), ... (6,2) removed? Move to (5,6): head to (5,6), body: (5,5) seg1, (5,4) seg2, (4,4) seg3, ..., up to (5,2) seg9, (6,2) removed, so positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)]\n\nThen turn 57 L to (4,6): head to (4,6), body: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] — tail (5,2) removed.\n\nThen turn 58 L to (3,6): eat, grow, positions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — 12 segments.\n\nNow, from (3,6), I can move D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n\nSimilarly in the other path.\n\nNow, after that, I need to eat (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3).\n\nIn the positions above, (5,3) is not occupied? In the list, after turn 58, we have (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), etc.\n\n(4,3) is segment, but (5,3) is not, so it should be free with food.\n\nTo reach (5,3) from (3,6).\n\nFor example, move D to (3,5), then to (3,4), but (3,4) might be free? Obstacle at (2,4), but (3,4) not obstacle.\n\nThen from (3,4) to (4,4) but (4,4) might be occupied.\n\nAfter head at (3,6), move D to (3,5): positions become [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)] — tail (4,2) removed? No, after eating on turn 58, positions 12 seg, move to (3,5) no food, so tail removed: tail was (4,2), removed, so positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)] — 11 segments, tail (2,2).\n\n(3,2) was removed? Previous: before move, head (3,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (3,3), seg8 (2,3), seg9 (2,2), seg10 (3,2), seg11 (4,2) — I think I messed up.\n\nAfter eating on turn 58: positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nNow move D to (3,5): head to (3,5), no food, so tail (4,2) is removed, and body moves: new positions: head (3,5), then previous head (3,6) now seg1, then (4,6) seg2, (5,6) seg3, (5,5) seg4, (5,4) seg5, (4,4) seg6, (4,3) seg7, (3,3) seg8, (2,3) seg9, (2,2) seg10, (3,2) seg11. But (3,2) is there, and tail is (3,2), since (4,2) removed.\n\nSegments: index 0: (3,5), 1: (3,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (5,5), 5: (5,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,2), 11: (3,2)\n\nTail at (3,2).\n\nNow, from (3,5), I can move to (3,4) or (2,5) or (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is not occupied, should be free.\n\n(3,4) free, (2,5) free.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is below.\n\nTo reach (5,3), I can go to (4,5) then to (4,4) but (4,4) is occupied, or to (5,5) but occupied.\n\nFrom (3,5), move to (4,5), which is free.\n\nThen head at (4,5), direction R (since from (3,5) to (4,5) is right? x from 3 to 4, y same, so R).\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6) but (4,6) is body, occupied, D to (4,4) occupied, L to (3,5) body, R to (5,5) occupied.\n\nAll adjacent cells occupied except possibly (3,5) but it's body now.\n\n(4,5) has neighbors: U (4,6): seg2, occupied; D (4,4): seg6, occupied; L (3,5): head was there, but now seg1? After move to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), then (3,5) seg1, (3,6) seg2, (4,6) seg3, etc.\n\nSpecifically: head (4,5), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (4,6), seg4 (5,6), seg5 (5,5), seg6 (5,4), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,3), seg9 (3,3), seg10 (2,3), seg11 (2,2) — tail (3,2) removed? When moving to (4,5), no food, tail removed.\n\nPrevious positions before move: head at (3,5), with body as above.\n\nMove R to (4,5): head to (4,5), no food, so tail removed. Previous tail was (3,2), removed.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — 11 segments, tail (2,2).\n\nNow from (4,5), adjacent cells:\n\nU (4,6): occupied by seg3? Positions: seg0 head (4,5), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (4,6), so (4,6) is seg3, occupied.\n\nD (4,4): seg7 (4,4), occupied.\n\nL (3,5): seg1, occupied.\n\nR (5,5): seg5 (5,5), occupied.\n\nSo all directions blocked! I am trapped at (4,5), cannot move anywhere. Dead end.\n\nThat's bad.\n\nIn this path, after eating at (3,6) and moving to (3,5), then to (4,5), I get stuck.\n\nTherefore, from (3,6), I should not move to (3,5), but to (2,6) instead.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAfter eating at (3,6) on turn 58, positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nFrom (3,6), move L to (2,6) instead of D.\n\n(2,6) should be free.\n\nMove L to (2,6): no food there, so tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) — tail (4,2) removed, and (3,2) now tail? Segments: head (2,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (5,6), seg4 (5,5), seg5 (5,4), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (3,3), seg9 (2,3), seg10 (2,2), seg11 (3,2) — tail (3,2).\n\nFrom (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) or U invalid, L to (1,6) or R to (3,6) body.\n\n(1,6): x=1,y=6, not wall, obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,6) not, so free.\n\n(2,5) free.\n\n(3,6) occupied.\n\nSo possible D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n\nThen I can go down to eat (5,3) later.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nTo avoid the trap, from (3,6) moving L to (2,6) is safer.\n\nThen I can access the left side.\n\nBut (5,3) is on the right.\n\nAnother option: from the beginning, instead of going for (3,6), I could go for (5,3) directly, but I cannot move down now.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,5) on turn 56, then instead of U, I could move L to (3,5) on turn 57.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (3,4) or (2,5), etc.\n\nBut (3,6) might not be eaten.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,6), it disappears, and I lose the opportunity.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating it is good.\n\nBut survival first.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (5,3) first if possible.\n\nFrom current, how to reach (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), head at (5,5), so two steps down, but I cannot move down now, and (5,4) is occupied.\n\nIf I move away and come back.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,5) on turn 56.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move D? But D to (4,4) is occupied, as before.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6) or L to (3,5), as earlier.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5) on turn 57.\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5) or U to (3,6) if not eaten.\n\nBut (3,6) has food, I can eat it if I go U.\n\nTurn 57: from (4,5) move to (3,5)? (3,5) is not food, so no eat.\n\nThen on turn 58, from (3,5) move U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nBut life span: at turn 58, (3,6) has life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nYes.\n\nSo turn 56: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 57: from (4,5) move L to (3,5) — direction L\n\nThen turn 58: from (3,5) move U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nNow, on turn 58, eating at (3,6).\n\nThen positions similar.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,6) is U, so direction U.\n\nAfter eating, head at (3,6), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), etc.\n\nPositions: after move U to (3,6) eat, so head (3,6), then previous positions: before move, at turn 57 after move to (3,5): positions [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] — 11 segments.\n\nThen move U to (3,6) eat, so new head (3,6), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), and no tail removal, so (4,2) is added? When food eaten, tail not removed, so positions: head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (3,3), seg8 (2,3), seg9 (2,2), seg10 (3,2), seg11 (4,2) — 12 segments.\n\nFrom (3,6), same as before, I can move L to (2,6) or D to (3,5) but (3,5) is body.\n\nMove L to (2,6) as before to avoid trap.\n\nThen I can go to (2,5), etc.\n\nNow, back to the food at (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), and in the positions, it might be free.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move head to (5,3).\n\nBut currently, after eating (3,6), I am at (3,6) or (2,6), far away.\n\nPerhaps from current position, I can go down to eat (5,3) after some moves.\n\nFor example, if I move R to (6,5) on turn 56, but then I miss (3,6).\n\nAnd (5,3) has longer life, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's see the grid occupation.\n\nAnother food is (5,2), under body.\n\nBut it can be eaten later.\n\nFor survival, moving to (4,5) or (5,6) might be better than (6,5) which leads to corner.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is also corner.\n\nBut with the snake body, it might be ok.\n\nI think the best is to go for (3,6) with the first plan, and from (3,6) move to (2,6) to avoid the trap.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,5), (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot, or to (1,6), then down.\n\n(1,6) is free, then to (1,5), etc.\n\nThen I can reach (5,3) eventually.\n\n(5,3) life span 6, so at turn 56, after turn 56, life span 5, turn 57:4, etc., up to turn 61.\n\nAfter turn 58, I eat (3,6), on turn 59 I am at (2,6), turn 60 to (1,6) or (2,5), etc., I have time to reach (5,3).\n\nSimilarly for (5,2).\n\nBut let's decide the first move.\n\nAlso, the answer format is to list actions for turn 56,57,58, etc., but I need to output for at least 5 turns ahead? The think 5+ turns, but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nThe answer should be like:\n\nTurn 56: action\n\nTurn 57: action\n\n...\n\nFor as many as I plan, but at least for the immediate turns.\n\nSince the state changes, I need to plan a sequence.\n\nBut with the food life, I can plan to eat (3,6) by turn 58.\n\nSo for turn 56, I can choose L or U.\n\nLet's see which one is better for future.\n\nIf I move L to (4,5) on turn 56, then I am at (4,5), which is more central.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), I am at top.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go to (3,5) or (4,6), both useful.\n\nFrom (5,6), I can only go L or R, but R to (6,6) might be dead end.\n\n(6,6) from (5,6) move R to (6,6), then from there only L or D, but D to (6,5) might be free later.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be risky.\n\nSo perhaps moving L to (4,5) is better.\n\nThen turn 57 move U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 58 move L to (3,6) eat.\n\nThen from (3,6), move L to (2,6) on turn 59.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) on turn 60, or L to (1,6), etc.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from 56.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the food at (5,3).\n\nAfter turn 58, head at (3,6), move to (2,6) on turn 59.\n\nThen from (2,6), move D to (2,5) on turn 60.\n\n(2,5) should be free.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move D to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, so invalid.\n\nL to (1,5), R to (3,5), U to (2,6) body.\n\nSo only L to (1,5) or R to (3,5).\n\n(1,5) x=1,y=5, not wall, not obstacle (obstacle at (1,2), so free).\n\n(3,5) may be free or not.\n\nAfter moving to (2,5) on turn 60, positions depend.\n\nBut let's not go too deep.\n\nPerhaps from (2,6), move L to (1,6) first on turn 59.\n\nThen from (1,6), move D to (1,5) on turn 60.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move D to (1,4) or R to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (5,3), it takes many moves.\n\nSince (5,3) is at (5,3), and it's close to the snake body, I can eat it directly if I can access it.\n\nFor example, after some moves, the body moves.\n\nBut let's consider moving towards it after eating (3,6).\n\nAnother idea: from current, instead of going for (3,6), I can go down to eat (5,3) by moving left or right first to turn around.\n\nBut it might take longer, and I risk losing (3,6).\n\nSince (3,6) expires soon, I should prioritize eating it.\n\nFor the action sequence, I'll go with turn 56: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 57: U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 58: L to (3,6)  // eat food\n\nThen for turn 59, from (3,6), move L to (2,6) to avoid the trap.\n\nThen turn 60, from (2,6), move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6). I'll choose D to (2,5) to go down.\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, so I can't go down from (2,5), only left or right.\n\nSo better to move L to (1,6) on turn 59.\n\nThen turn 60, from (1,6) move D to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 61, from (1,5) move D to (1,4) or R to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut this is getting messy.\n\nPerhaps after eating (3,6), I can move directly to (3,5) if I can, but earlier it led to trap if I go to (4,5), but if I go to (2,6) first, it might be ok.\n\nLet's assume for now.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,2) can be eaten later.\n\nBut for the output, I need to list actions for several turns.\n\nSince the think 5+ turns, I can list for 5 turns: turn 56 to 60 or something.\n\nBut turn 60 is t1+4, since t1=56, turn 60 is t1+4.\n\nt1=56, turn 57 is t1+1, etc.\n\nSo for 5 turns ahead, up to turn 61? 5 turns from now: turn 56,57,58,59,60, that's 5 actions.\n\nTurn 56 is current, so plan for turn 56 to 60.\n\n4 future turns: 57,58,59,60.\n\nBut the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so plan for at least 5 future turns, but output the actions from current.\n\nIn answer format, it shows Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nSo I need to output a sequence.\n\nFor now, I'll go with the plan to eat (3,6) and then move to (2,6).\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 56: L (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 57: U (to (4,6))\n\nTurn 58: L (to (3,6) eat)\n\nTurn 59: L (to (2,6))\n\nNow for turn 60, from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n\n(2,5) is better to go down, but I can't go further down due to obstacle, so move L to (1,6) to explore left.\n\nThen turn 60: L to (1,6)\n\nBut I need to think about (5,3).\n\nFrom (1,6), I can go down to (1,5), etc., but it might not be efficient.\n\nPerhaps after turn 59 at (2,6), move D to (2,5), then from (2,5) move R to (3,5) or L to (1,5).\n\nThen I can go to (3,4) or something.\n\nBut (3,4) might be free.\n\nFor example, turn 60 from (2,6) move D to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 61 from (2,5) move R to (3,5) if free.\n\nBut I need to output only up to turn 60 for now.\n\nSince the state changes, I can output the first few actions.\n\nBut let's include turn 60.\n\nAnother food is (5,3), which I can eat later.\n\nBut to save it, I can plan a path.\n\nNotice that from the current position, if I move U to (5,6), then to (4,6), then to (3,6), same as before.\n\nOr from (5,6), I can move R to (6,6), but that might be worse.\n\nI think L to (4,5) is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can eat the food at (5,3) sooner by not going to (3,6), but that wastes the food.\n\nAll food is +1, so eating it is good.\n\nI think I should proceed with the plan.\n\nSo for answer:\n\nTurn 56: L\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: L  // eat at (3,6)\n\nTurn 59: L  // to (2,6)\n\nFor turn 60, from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6). I'll choose D to (2,5) to go down, even though I can't go further, but I can turn later.\n\nSo Turn 60: D\n\nThen from there, later I can go right.\n\nBut for now, output up to turn 60.\n\nThe current turn is 56, so actions for turn 56,57,58,59,60.\n\n5 actions.\n\nTurn 60 is t1+4.\n\nt1=56, t1+1=57, t1+2=58, t1+3=59, t1+4=60.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 58 I eat food, good.\n\nNow, about the food at (5,3), I can eat it around turn 61 or later, but life span 6 at turn 56, so at turn 60, life span 2, can be eaten on turn 61 or 62.\n\nAfter turn 60, I might be at (2,5), then I can go to (3,5), then (3,4), then (4,4) but occupied, etc., but it might be possible.\n\nSimilarly for (5,2).\n\nBut I think for the output, this is acceptable.\n\nTo make it better, from turn 59 at (2,6), move L to (1,6), then D to (1,5), then R to (2,5), etc., but similar.\n\nI think it's fine.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Turns 56 to 60\n\n**Current State (Turn 56):**\n- **Grid**: Playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n- **Snake**: Head at (5,5) with direction U (up). Body positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)] (length 11).\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,6): Value +1, life span 3 (can be eaten on turns 56, 57, or 58; disappears after turn 58).\n  - (5,3): Value +1, life span 6 (can be eaten up to turn 61).\n  - (5,2): Value +1, life span 9 (currently under snake body at index 9; must be vacated before eating, can be eaten up to turn 64).\n\n**Immediate Move Options (Turn 56):**\n- **Up (U) to (5,6)**: Valid and safe. Leads toward (3,6) but may require more turns to reach it.\n- **Down (D)**: Invalid (opposite direction to current U and occupied by body at (5,4)).\n- **Left (L) to (4,5)**: Valid and safe. Closer to (3,6) and central for future moves.\n- **Right (R) to (6,5)**: Valid but risky; leads to corner with limited escape routes (e.g., only U to (6,6) next).\n\n**Priorities:**\n- **Eat (3,6) before it expires (by turn 58)**: This is urgent due to short life span. Missing it loses a +1 score opportunity.\n- **Avoid risks**: The snake is long (11 segments), so tight spaces or corners (e.g., after moving right) could trap it. Survival is paramount.\n- **Long-term food**: (5,3) and (5,2) have longer life spans, so they can be targeted after (3,6). (5,2) requires the body to vacate it first.\n- **Path to (3,6)**: Moving left to (4,5) on turn 56 is optimal—it positions the snake closer to (3,6) and avoids dead ends. From there, move up to (4,6) on turn 57, then left to (3,6) to eat on turn 58.\n\n**5-Turn Plan (Turns 56–60):**\n1. **Turn 56: Move L (left to (4,5))**  \n   - Why: Avoids immediate risk, moves toward (3,6), and keeps options open. Direction changes to L.\n   - New head: (4,5). Body: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)]. Tail (6,2) removed.\n\n2. **Turn 57: Move U (up to (4,6))**  \n   - Why: Advances toward (3,6). Direction changes to U.\n   - New head: (4,6). Body: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]. Tail (5,2) removed. Food (5,2) is still under body but will be vacated soon.\n\n3. **Turn 58: Move L (left to (3,6) and eat food)**  \n   - Why: Eats (3,6) before it expires (life span ends after this turn). Snake grows to length 12.\n   - New head: (3,6). Body: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]. Direction changes to L.\n\n4. **Turn 59: Move L (left to (2,6))**  \n   - Why: Avoids trap at (3,6) (moving down to (3,5) could lead to dead ends). Explores left for safety and future food access. Direction changes to L.\n   - New head: (2,6). Body: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)]. Tail (4,2) removed.\n\n5. **Turn 60: Move D (down to (2,5))**  \n   - Why: Moves away from top row to access central areas. (2,5) is safe (no walls, obstacles, or body). From here, snake can target (5,3) or (5,2) later. Avoids moving left to (1,6) immediately to prevent cornering.\n   - New head: (2,5). Body: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]. Tail (3,2) removed. Food (5,2) is now vacated and can be eaten later.\n\n**Post-Turn 60 Considerations:**\n- **Food at (5,3)**: Can be eaten by ~turn 61–62. Path: From (2,5), move right to (3,5) or down if possible, then to (4,5), and approach (5,3).\n- **Food at (5,2)**: Vacated after turn 59. Can be eaten once head can move to (5,2) safely (e.g., after reducing length or maneuvering). Check for Tail Reward Danger—tail is at (2,2) on turn 60, not adjacent to (5,2), so safe if eaten later.\n- **Survival**: The plan avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions. After turn 60, the snake has space to navigate toward remaining food. Life spans allow flexibility: (5,3) lasts until turn 61, (5,2) until turn 64.\n- **Risks Mitigated**: No instant reversals, corners, or tight loops. Moving to (2,6) and (2,5) keeps the snake near the left edge but with escape routes (e.g., right or down).\n\n**Output for Turns 56 to 60:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 56: L (left)\nTurn 57: U (up)\nTurn 58: L (left)\nTurn 59: L (left)\nTurn 60: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 57, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid size isn't specified, but from the walls, it seems like x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, so an 8x8 grid? Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so yes, grid is from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nInternal obstacles are at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,5), then body: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). That's 11 segments. Head direction is left, so last move was to the left, from (5,5) to (4,5)? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (4,5) <- head, then (5,5), which is right of head, but head direction is L, meaning it moved left to (4,5), so previous head was at (5,5), now at (4,5). Yes.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,6) with value 1 and life span 2 (meaning it disappears after 2 more turns, including current turn? Life span is given, and it decreases every turn including current, so at turn 57, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 58? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for a food with life span L at turn T, it disappears after T + L - 1? No.\n\nIf life span is N at turn T, it will be present for N turns starting from turn T. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn T, countdown is N, then at turn T+1, it's N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten on turns T to T+N-1, and is gone at turn T+N.\n\nFor example, at turn T, life span N: available on T, T+1, ..., T+N-1; gone at T+N.\n\nHere, turn 57, food at (3,6): life span 2, so available on turn 57 and 58, gone at turn 59.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3): life span 5, available turns 57 to 61, gone at 62.\n\n(5,2): life span 8, available turns 57 to 64, gone at 65.\n\nBut (5,2) is also the position of the snake's tail? Snake positions: tail is at (5,2), and food at (5,2) is listed. But the snake is currently on that cell, so according to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSpecifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo for (5,2), which is occupied by the tail, it has food that can be eaten later if the snake moves such that the tail leaves (5,2) and then head comes back.\n\nBut there's also \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to the tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, I need to plan the next moves, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,5)\n\nHead direction: L (left), so last move was left to (4,5).\n\nPossible moves: I can go U (up), D (down), L (left), or R (right), but cannot do instant reverse, which would be R (right), since current direction is L, so I cannot go right immediately because that would be opposite direction.\n\nInstant reverse: if moving left, cannot go right on next turn. Similarly, if moving up, cannot go down, etc.\n\nSo from (4,5), with current direction L, I can go U, D, or L, but not R.\n\nNow, let's list possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (4,6)\n\n- Down: to (4,4)\n\n- Left: to (3,5)\n\n- Right: not allowed, since opposite direction.\n\nBut (4,4) is occupied by snake body. Snake positions: (4,5) head, then (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), ... so (4,4) is the fourth segment, which is body, so moving down to (4,4) would cause collision with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (3,5): is (3,5) free? Let's see what's at (3,5).\n\nGrid: I should map the grid.\n\nList all occupied cells.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions: head (4,5), body: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)\n\nSo occupied cells: walls, obstacles, and snake body.\n\nNow, food: (3,6), (5,3), (5,2)\n\n(5,2) is occupied by snake tail, so food is there but under body.\n\nNow, back to possible moves from (4,5):\n\n- Up: to (4,6)\n\nIs (4,6) valid? x=4, y=6, not border (borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall), not obstacle, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (4,5) is current, (4,6) not listed, so should be free? But let's check: snake segments are from y=2 to y=5, no y=6, so (4,6) should be free.\n\ny=6 is within 0 to 7, and not wall except borders, so (4,6) is free.\n\n- Down: to (4,4) — but (4,4) is occupied by snake body, as above. Moving there would collide, die.\n\n- Left: to (3,5)\n\n(3,5): not border, not obstacle? Obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), none at (3,5). Snake? Positions: (3,3), (2,3), etc., no (3,5), so free.\n\n- Right: to (5,5) — but (5,5) is occupied by snake body, and also, cannot move right because it's opposite direction to current L.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so moving right is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: Up to (4,6) or Left to (3,5). Down and Right are invalid.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term survival.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (3,6): value +1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 58 or it's gone.\n\n- (5,3): value +1, life span 5, so can be eaten up to turn 61.\n\n- (5,2): value +1, life span 8, but currently under tail, so need to move tail away first.\n\nAlso, (5,2) is tail position.\n\nNow, tail is at (5,2), head is at (4,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,5) and (5,2) are not adjacent; distance is |4-5| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells would be same row or column, differing by 1 in one coordinate.\n\nSo head (4,5) adjacent cells: (4,6) up, (4,4) down, (3,5) left, (5,5) right.\n\nTail is at (5,2), which is not adjacent to head.\n\nBut if I move towards it, might become adjacent later.\n\nNow, for (5,2) food, since it's under tail, I need to move the snake so that tail moves away, then head can come to (5,2) to eat it.\n\nBut there's a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes death because after eating, tail grows, and head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (5,2) with food, so if head moves to (5,2) when tail is still there or adjacent, it might be risky.\n\nSpecifically, the rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut when eating, the head moves to the food cell, which is also the tail cell, so if tail is there, moving head to tail cell would collide before eating? Let's clarify.\n\nThe collision happens when head moves to a cell occupied by body, except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to tail cell is allowed because tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nBut for food under tail, when tail moves away, the cell becomes free, then head can move to it to eat.\n\nBut if at that moment, head is adjacent to tail, and the food is on tail cell, eating it might cause issue with the new tail growing.\n\nThe danger is specifically when eating food on the tail cell while head is adjacent to tail.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move away; instead, since snake grows, the tail stays, and a new segment is added.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nScenario: suppose tail is at position T with food. Head is at H, adjacent to T. If head moves to T to eat the food, then: after moving, head is at T, and since food is eaten, snake grows, so the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the end, but since tail was at T, and head moved to T, after growth, the new tail is at T, and head is also at T? No.\n\nSequence:\n\n1. Head moves to the food cell (which is T, tail position). Since it's the tail, moving there is allowed because tail moves after.\n\nBut when head moves to T, at that moment, tail is still at T, but since it's the tail, no collision; head and tail can be at same cell during move? No, cells are unique.\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo if head moves to tail cell T, and tail was at T, then:\n\n- Head moves to T.\n\n- Then the segment behind head moves to where head was, and so on, down to the tail.\n\nBut since head moves to T, and tail was at T, the tail segment will move to the previous position of the segment just before tail.\n\nLet's denote positions.\n\nSuppose snake: head H, then B1, B2, ..., Bk, tail T.\n\nPositions: H, B1, B2, ..., T.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new position, say N.\n\nThen B1 moves to H, B2 moves to B1, ..., T moves to Bk.\n\nIf N is the current position of T, so head moves to T's position.\n\nThen: new head position: T\n\nThen B1 moves to old H\n\nB2 moves to old B1\n\n...\n\nT moves to old position of Bk (the segment before tail)\n\nSince T was occupied by tail, but tail moves away, so after move, the cell T is now head, and tail is at new position.\n\nThen, when food is eaten at T, since head is now at T, and food is there, it gets eaten, so snake grows: the tail does not move, a new tail segment is added at the current tail position.\n\nSo after eating, the snake has an extra segment, and tail stays where it is.\n\nNow, the danger: if before eating, head was adjacent to tail, meaning H and T were adjacent.\n\nAfter head moves to T to eat, and grows, the new head is at T, and the new tail is at the old tail position? No.\n\nBefore move: head at H, tail at T, H adjacent to T.\n\nHead moves to T (which has food). After move: head is now at T, tail has moved to the position of the segment before it, say P.\n\nThen, since food eaten, snake grows, so a new segment is added at the current tail position, which is P. So tail is still at P, but now there's an extra segment behind it? No.\n\nGrowth: when food is eaten during the move, after the move, the tail does not move; it stays in place, so the new segment is added at the tail position before the move? Standard snake growth.\n\nTypically in snake, when food eaten, after moving, the tail does not move, so length increases.\n\nSequence for eating:\n\n- Head moves to food cell.\n\n- Body moves: each segment moves to previous position.\n\n- Since food eaten, the tail segment does not move; it stays, so a new segment is added where tail was, and tail becomes that new segment.\n\nBut in terms of positions: suppose positions before move: head H, body B1, B2, ..., Bk, tail T.\n\nHead moves to F (food).\n\nThen new positions: head at F, B1 at H, B2 at B1, ..., Bk at Bk-1, and since food eaten, T does not move, so tail still at T, but now T is not the tail; the new tail is Bk? Let's index.\n\nPositions before move: segment 0: head at H, seg1 at B1, seg2 at B2, ..., segN at T.\n\nAfter move without eating: seg0 moves to new position N, seg1 moves to H, seg2 moves to B1, ..., segN moves to segN-1 old position.\n\nWith eating: if head moves to food, then after move, seg0 at F, seg1 at H, seg2 at B1, ..., segN at segN-1, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position T, so now there is segN+1 at T, and tail is segN+1.\n\nBut in this case, segN (the old tail) has moved to segN-1 position.\n\nThe key point for danger: if before move, head H is adjacent to tail T, and the food is at T.\n\nThen head moves to T.\n\nAfter move: head at T, seg1 at H, ..., segN at segN-1 old position, and new tail at old T position? Since food eaten, new segment added at old T position.\n\nBut old T position is now occupied by head, since head moved to T.\n\nConflict.\n\nBefore move: head at H, tail at T, H adjacent to T.\n\nFood at T.\n\nHead moves to T.\n\nDuring move: head moves to T, but T is occupied by tail? No, in terms of grid, when moving, we check if the new head position is free except for tail.\n\nAs per rule, moving to tail cell is allowed because tail moves.\n\nSo head moves to T.\n\nThen, the body moves: seg1 moves to H, seg2 moves to old seg1, ..., segN moves to old segN-1 position.\n\nNow, old segN-1 position was occupied, but since segN moves there, it's fine.\n\nThen, since food eaten at T, a new segment is added at the position where tail was before move, which is T. But T is now occupied by the head? After head moved to T, and segN moved away, T is now head, and the previous tail position T is empty? No.\n\nAt the start, position T has tail.\n\nHead moves to T: so now position T has both head and tail? But only one can occupy a cell.\n\nThe rule allows moving to tail cell because tail will move after.\n\nSo sequentially: head moves to new cell, which is T. Since T was tail, it's allowed, and after head moves, the tail will move to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo when head moves to T, for a moment, both might be on T? But in game, it's handled by order: head moves first to new position, then body shifts.\n\nSo when head moves to T, T was occupied by tail, but tail is about to move, so it's considered free for head to move in.\n\nThen after head is at T, the segment that was at T (tail) moves to the position of the segment before it.\n\nThen, since food eaten at T (but T is now head), food is consumed, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before the move. But before move, tail was at T, and after move, the tail has moved to another position.\n\nAfter the move sequence without growth: head at new position, tail at new position.\n\nWith growth: after the move, the tail does not move; it stays, so the position where tail was supposed to move from is kept, and new segment added there.\n\nStandard way: when food eaten, after moving the head and body, the tail position is not updated, so it stays, and length increases.\n\nIn this case: before move: positions: H, B1, B2, ..., T at T.\n\nHead moves to F (which is T).\n\nSo new head position: T.\n\nThen B1 moves to H.\n\nB2 moves to old B1.\n\n...\n\nThe segment before tail, say Bk, moves to its new position.\n\nThen tail T moves to old Bk position.\n\nBut since food is eaten at T, which is now the head position, the tail does not move; it stays at its previous position? Confusing.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that after head moves to food, the body moves as usual, but the tail segment is not removed, so a new segment is added at the end.\n\nInitial positions: cells: H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T\n\nHead moves to F (T).\n\nNow new head at T.\n\nThen B1 moves to H (so cell H now has B1).\n\nB2 moves to old B1 position.\n\n...\n\nBk moves to old Bk-1 position.\n\nT moves to old Bk position.\n\nBut since food at T was eaten, instead of T moving, we keep T where it is, and add a new segment at the old T position? But old T position is now head.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nCommon implementation: when snake eats food, during the move, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, but the tail does not advance, so the last position is not vacated, thus length increases by one.\n\nSo positions before: seg0: H, seg1: B1, seg2: B2, ..., segN: T\n\nHead moves to new position N.\n\nIf N is food, then after move, seg0 at N, seg1 at H, seg2 at old seg1, ..., segN at old segN-1, and a new segment segN+1 is added at the position where segN was before move, which is T. So new tail at T.\n\nIn this case, for food at tail cell T:\n\nBefore move: head at H, tail at T, H adjacent to T.\n\nHead moves to T (food).\n\nAfter move: head at T, seg1 at H, seg2 at old seg1, ..., segN at old segN-1, and new segment segN+1 at old T position.\n\nOld T position is the same as new head position? No, old T position is T, new head position is also T, so segN+1 at T, but head is also at T, collision.\n\nThat's the problem.\n\nSince head moved to T, and new segment is added at old T position, which is T, so now two segments at T: head and new tail, immediate collision.\n\nHence, if head moves to the tail cell to eat food when head was adjacent to tail, after the move, head and new tail are at the same position, collision.\n\nIf head was not adjacent, the tail would have moved away before head arrives.\n\nIn this case, since H and T adjacent, when head moves to T, T is still there, and after growth, both at T.\n\nBut if not adjacent, say head at H, tail at T, |H-T|>1, then when head moves to T, by the time head arrives, tail has moved away, so T is free, head moves to T, eats food, then new segment added at the previous tail position, which is not T, so no collision.\n\nSo danger only when head is adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n\nIn our case, for (5,2) food, which is on tail, but head is not adjacent, so it might be safe to eat later, but I need to move the snake so that tail leaves (5,2), then head can come when not adjacent.\n\nBut when head comes to (5,2), if at that time tail is adjacent, it might be dangerous, but since tail has moved, it might not be adjacent.\n\nI need to plan moves carefully.\n\nBack to current turn.\n\nTurn 57, head at (4,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: Up to (4,6) or Left to (3,5).\n\nNow, food at (3,6) with life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 58.\n\n(3,6) is at x=3,y=6.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I go up to (4,6), then I can go left to (3,6) next turn.\n\nIf I go left to (3,5), then I can go up to (3,6).\n\nBoth ways can reach (3,6) in one or two moves.\n\nBut I need to think about safety and other food.\n\nAlso, the grid has obstacles and walls.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid layout.\n\nI should sketch a grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nHead: (4,5)\n\nBody: (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) tail.\n\nSo snake occupies: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)\n\nNow, free cells: I need to find where I can move.\n\nFor move from (4,5):\n\n- Up: (4,6) - free? x=4,y=6, not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions, so free.\n\n- Down: (4,4) - occupied by snake, not free.\n\n- Left: (3,5) - free? x=3,y=5, not wall, not obstacle, not in snake, so free.\n\n- Right: (5,5) - occupied by snake, and not allowed reverse.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nNow, food at (3,6), which is close.\n\nIf I go U to (4,6), then at turn 58, I can go L to (3,6) to eat it, since life span 2, available turn 57 and 58.\n\nAt turn 57, if I go U to (4,6), then food at (3,6) still available turn 58.\n\nIf I go L to (3,5) at turn 57, then at turn 58 I can go U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nBoth sequences get me to eat (3,6) by turn 58.\n\nBut I need to see which is safer or better for future.\n\nAlso, other food: (5,3) and (5,2).\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3.\n\nCurrently, (5,3) is not occupied, I think. Snake has (5,4), (5,2), but not (5,3)? (5,3) is not listed in snake positions. Snake: (5,5), (5,4), then (4,4), no (5,3). (5,3) is free, and has food with life span 5.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) has food but occupied by tail.\n\nNow, if I go to (3,6) first, I might be away from other food.\n\nBut (3,6) must be eaten soon.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows.\n\nI need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider the two options.\n\nOption 1: Turn 57, go U to (4,6)\n\nThen head at (4,6), direction now U (since I moved up).\n\nThen turn 58, I can go L to (3,6) to eat the food.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows: head moves to (3,6), which was free, eats food, then since eaten, tail does not move, so new segment added at old tail position.\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,2).\n\nAfter move: head to (3,6), body: segment behind head moves to (4,6), which was previous head, then (5,5) moves to (5,5)? Let's list positions.\n\nAt turn 57 start: snake: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)]\n\nAfter move U to (4,6): new head (4,6), then body: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) and tail (5,2) moves to (4,2)? Sequence:\n\nAfter head moves to (4,6), the first body segment (5,5) moves to previous head position (4,5).\n\nThen (5,4) moves to (5,5), then (4,4) moves to (5,4), then (4,3) moves to (4,4), (3,3) moves to (4,3), (2,3) moves to (3,3), (2,2) moves to (2,3), (3,2) moves to (2,2), (4,2) moves to (3,2), (5,2) moves to (4,2).\n\nSo new positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) and tail at (5,2) moved to (4,2), so tail at (4,2).\n\nList: segments: head: (4,6), seg1: (4,5), seg2: (5,5), seg3: (5,4), seg4: (4,4), seg5: (4,3), seg6: (3,3), seg7: (2,3), seg8: (2,2), seg9: (3,2), seg10: (4,2), and tail was seg10? Original 11 segments.\n\nAfter move, no food eaten, so snake same length, tail moves.\n\nPositions: new head (4,6)\n\nThen the body: first body segment moves to old head position (4,5)\n\nSecond body segment moves to old first body position (5,5)\n\nThird to (5,4)\n\nFourth to (4,4)\n\nFifth to (4,3)\n\nSixth to (3,3)\n\nSeventh to (2,3)\n\nEighth to (2,2)\n\nNinth to (3,2)\n\nTenth to (4,2)\n\nEleventh (tail) moves to old tenth position, which was (5,2), but old tenth is (4,2) before move? Before move, positions: index 0: (4,5) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (2,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (5,2) tail.\n\nAfter head moves to (4,6):\n\nNew pos: head: (4,6)\n\nIndex 1 moves to old index 0: (4,5)\n\nIndex 2 moves to old index 1: (5,5)\n\nIndex 3 moves to old index 2: (5,4)\n\nIndex 4 moves to old index 3: (4,4)\n\nIndex 5 moves to old index 4: (4,3)\n\nIndex 6 moves to old index 5: (3,3)\n\nIndex 7 moves to old index 6: (2,3)\n\nIndex 8 moves to old index 7: (2,2)\n\nIndex 9 moves to old index 8: (3,2)\n\nIndex 10 moves to old index 9: (4,2)\n\nAnd index 10 is tail, so tail at (4,2)\n\nOld index 10 (5,2) is vacated.\n\nSo snake now: head (4,6), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) tail.\n\nLength 11, tail at (4,2)\n\nFood at (3,6) is still there, life span now 1 (after turn 57, countdown to 1 for turn 58).\n\nAt turn 58, from (4,6), head direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so not D.\n\nU to (4,7) - but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (4,5) - but (4,5) is occupied by body, snake has (4,5) as first body segment, so collision.\n\nL to (3,6) - (3,6) is where food is, and it's free? Currently, (3,6) not occupied, so can move there.\n\nR to (5,6) - (5,6) is free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so free.\n\nBut to eat food, I should go L to (3,6).\n\nIf I go to (3,6), it has food, so I eat it.\n\nMove head to (3,6).\n\nThen body moves: new head (3,6)\n\nIndex 1 moves to old head (4,6)\n\nIndex 2 moves to old index1 (4,5)\n\nIndex 3 to old index2 (5,5)\n\nIndex 4 to old index3 (5,4)\n\nIndex 5 to old index4 (4,4)\n\nIndex 6 to old index5 (4,3)\n\nIndex 7 to old index6 (3,3)\n\nIndex 8 to old index7 (2,3)\n\nIndex 9 to old index8 (2,2)\n\nIndex 10 to old index9 (3,2)\n\nAnd since food eaten, tail does not move, so a new segment is added at old tail position (4,2).\n\nOld tail was at (4,2), so new segment added there, so now tail is at (4,2), and the segment that was moving to (4,2) is now part of body.\n\nAfter move: head at (3,6)\n\nseg1 at (4,6)  // old head\n\nseg2 at (4,5)  // old seg1\n\nseg3 at (5,5)  // old seg2\n\nseg4 at (5,4)  // old seg3\n\nseg5 at (4,4)  // old seg4\n\nseg6 at (4,3)  // old seg5\n\nseg7 at (3,3)  // old seg6\n\nseg8 at (2,3)  // old seg7\n\nseg9 at (2,2)  // old seg8\n\nseg10 at (3,2)  // old seg9\n\nand since food eaten, new segment seg11 at old tail position (4,2), so tail is seg11 at (4,2)\n\nBut old seg10 was moving to (3,2), which is now seg10.\n\nPositions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), and tail (4,2)\n\n(4,2) is tail, and (3,2) is body.\n\nSnake length 12 now.\n\nHead direction after moving L from (4,6) to (3,6) is L.\n\nNow, back to option at turn 57.\n\nIf at turn 57 I go left to (3,5) instead.\n\nTurn 57: go L to (3,5)\n\nHead at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen body moves: new head (3,5)\n\nseg1 to old head (4,5) = (4,5)\n\nseg2 to old seg1 (5,5) = (5,5)\n\nseg3 to old seg2 (5,4) = (5,4)\n\nseg4 to old seg3 (4,4) = (4,4)\n\nseg5 to old seg4 (4,3) = (4,3)\n\nseg6 to old seg5 (3,3) = (3,3)\n\nseg7 to old seg6 (2,3) = (2,3)\n\nseg8 to old seg7 (2,2) = (2,2)\n\nseg9 to old seg8 (3,2) = (3,2)\n\nseg10 to old seg9 (4,2) = (4,2)\n\ntail seg11 to old seg10 (5,2) = (5,2)? Old seg10 was (5,2), so seg10 moves to (4,2), tail moves to old seg10 position (5,2)? Index 10 moves to old index9 (4,2), index 11 (tail) moves to old index10 (5,2).\n\nBut old tail was index10 at (5,2), so after move, tail at (5,2) again? New positions: head (3,5), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (3,3), seg7 (2,3), seg8 (2,2), seg9 (3,2), seg10 (4,2), tail at (5,2)\n\n(5,2) has food, but it's under tail, not eaten because head not there.\n\nFood at (3,6) life span 2, available turn 57 and 58.\n\nAt turn 58, from (3,5), head direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied by body, and R is not reverse? Current direction L, so reverse is R, not allowed? Instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so cannot move R (right).\n\nSo possible: U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,6): (3,6) has food, so can move there to eat.\n\nD to (3,4): (3,4) free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake has (3,3), (3,5) now head, (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so free.\n\nBut to eat food, go U to (3,6).\n\nThen similar to before, eat food, grow.\n\nSo both ways, I can eat (3,6) by turn 58.\n\nBut in first option, by going U then L, I end up at (3,6) with direction L.\n\nIn second, by going L then U, I end up at (3,6) with direction U.\n\nSlightly different positions.\n\nBut for now, I need to think about the other food and long-term.\n\nThere is food at (5,3) with life span 5, so can eat later.\n\nAnd (5,2) with life span 8, but under tail.\n\nAlso, after eating (3,6), the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eat all positive food if possible.\n\n(5,2) is positive food, value 1, but I need to eat it safely.\n\nFirst, let's consider the grid and possible paths.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nWalls: borders.\n\nNow, the snake is in the center, head at (4,5).\n\nIf I go to eat (3,6), I might be in the top-left area.\n\nThen to get to (5,3), which is bottom-right.\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3.\n\nCurrently, from the snake, (5,4) is body, (5,3) is free with food.\n\nBut if I go to (3,6), it might take time.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (5,3) first or something, but (3,6) has short life, so I must eat it soon.\n\nLife span 2, so only this turn or next to eat.\n\nAt turn 57, I can only move to (4,6) or (3,5), not directly to (3,6) or (5,3).\n\nFrom (4,5), (3,6) is not adjacent; adjacent are (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5).\n\n(3,6) is diagonal, not directly adjacent, so I need two moves to reach it.\n\nSimilarly for (5,3).\n\nSo I have to choose to go towards (3,6) via U or L.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (5,2) is under tail, and life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut when I move, the tail moves, so eventually (5,2) will be free when tail leaves.\n\nCurrently tail at (5,2), and as snake moves, tail will move away.\n\nFor example, if I go U to (4,6), as above, tail moves to (4,2).\n\nThen (5,2) is free, and food is there, so I can go to (5,2) to eat it, but need to be careful of tail danger.\n\nHead is at (4,6), tail at (4,2), not adjacent.\n\nThen I can plan to go to (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) has y=2, x=5.\n\nFrom (4,6), it's far.\n\nAlso, there is (5,3) food.\n\nI should think 5 turns ahead.\n\nLet's list possible actions for turn 57.\n\nOption A: Turn 57, go U to (4,6)\n\nThen as above, at turn 58, go L to (3,6) to eat food. Head at (3,6), direction L.\n\nSnake grown, positions as above.\n\nThen at turn 59, from (3,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, but not R (reverse).\n\nU to (3,7) - y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5) - (3,5) is occupied? In the positions after eating, we have (3,6) head, (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), etc., and (3,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\nAfter eating at turn 58, positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), tail (4,2)\n\nSo (3,5) is free.\n\nD to (3,5) is down.\n\nL to (2,6) - (2,6) free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so free.\n\nR to (4,6) but (4,6) is occupied by body, and R is right, which is opposite to current direction L? Current direction is L, so R is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n\nIf I go D to (3,5), then head to (3,5), direction D.\n\nThen body moves: seg1 to (3,6), seg2 to (4,6), etc., tail moves or not, no food.\n\nBut (3,5) might be free, but let's see future.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to other places.\n\nBut I want to go to (5,3) or (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is currently tail at (4,2), but after moves, it changes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going to (5,3) first since it has shorter life? Life span 5, available turns 57 to 61.\n\nTurn 57 now, so up to turn 61.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) life span 8.\n\nBut (3,6) is priority for now.\n\nAnother option at turn 57: go L to (3,5)\n\nThen at turn 58, go U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nHead at (3,6), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen at turn 59, from (3,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5) - (3,5) might be free.\n\nL to (2,6) - free.\n\nR to (4,6) - but (4,6) is body, and R is not reverse? Current direction U, so reverse is D, not R. R is right, not opposite.\n\nOpposite to U is D, so R is allowed.\n\nBut (4,6) is occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nSo possible: D or L.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIn both cases, after eating (3,6), I am at (3,6) with limited moves: only D or L, since U is wall.\n\nD to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n\nIf I go D to (3,5), I am at (3,5), which is closer to the bottom.\n\nFrom there, I can go to (4,5) or (3,4) etc.\n\nBut let's think about (5,3) food.\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,1) and (6,1), (6,4), but (5,3) is free.\n\nAlso, there is obstacle at (2,4), (1,2), etc.\n\nNow, the snake body is blocking some areas.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), the snake has segments around (3,6) to (4,2), so the right side is more open.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), I can go right to (4,5), but (4,5) is body? In positions, after eating, we have (4,6), (4,5), etc., so (4,5) is occupied.\n\nAfter turn 58, positions include (4,5), so (4,5) is not free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is occupied.\n\nTo reach (5,3), I need to go down or something.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nAfter eating (3,6) at turn 58, snake positions: head (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), tail (4,2)\n\nSo occupied: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4) obstacle, (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) wall, (3,4), (3,5), (3,7) wall, (4,1), (4,7) wall, (5,3), (5,6), (5,7) wall, (6,3), (6,4) obstacle, (6,5), (6,6), etc.\n\n(5,3) is free and has food.\n\n(3,5) is free.\n\n(2,6) is free.\n\nFrom (3,6), if I go D to (3,5), then at (3,5), I can then go to (3,4) or (4,5) but (4,5) occupied, so only (3,4) or (2,5) or (4,5) not free, so possible moves from (3,5): U to (3,6) occupied, D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5) occupied, so only D or L.\n\nIf I go D to (3,4), then to (3,3) occupied, so not good.\n\n(3,3) is occupied, so from (3,5), D to (3,4) might be free, then from there.\n\n(3,4) is free? Not occupied, not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (4,4) occupied, (3,3) occupied, (2,4) obstacle, (3,5) previous, so only possible L to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, invalid, or U to (3,5), or D to (3,3) occupied, so from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) invalid, L to (2,4) invalid, R to (4,4) occupied, so only U back to (3,5), dead end.\n\nThat's a problem.\n\nIf at (3,6) I go D to (3,5), then from (3,5) I must go to (3,4), then from (3,4) only back to (3,5), and (3,3) is occupied, so trapped, death.\n\nTherefore, going D to (3,5) from (3,6) is dangerous because it leads to a dead end.\n\nSimilarly, if I go L to (2,6) from (3,6), let's see.\n\n(2,6) is free.\n\nFrom (2,6), direction L if I moved left.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6), R to (3,6) occupied.\n\nSo D or L.\n\nIf go D to (2,5), then from (2,5), can go to (2,4) obstacle, (2,6), (1,5), (3,5), etc.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so from (2,5): U to (2,6), D to (2,4) invalid, L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\nSo possible U, L, R.\n\nBut R to (3,5) is free.\n\nSo not trapped.\n\nTherefore, from (3,6), the safe move is to go L to (2,6), not D to (3,5).\n\nBecause (3,5) leads to potential trap.\n\nIn the first option, when I went U then L to eat, I ended at (3,6) with direction L, and I should go L to (2,6) to avoid dead end.\n\nSimilarly, in the second option, if I went L then U to eat, I end at (3,6) with direction U, and I can go L to (2,6) as well.\n\nSo for turn 57, both choices are similar, but let's see which one positions me better for other food.\n\nAt turn 57, if I go U to (4,6), then at turn 58 go L to (3,6) eat, then turn 59 go L to (2,6).\n\nHead at (2,6), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,3) later.\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3), far away.\n\nIf at turn 57 I go L to (3,5), then turn 58 go U to (3,6) eat, then turn 59 go L to (2,6), same as above.\n\nBut if I go L to (3,5) at turn 57, then at (3,5), I am closer to the bottom, and I can consider going to (5,3) without eating (3,6) immediately? But I have to eat it by turn 58.\n\nAt turn 57, if I go L to (3,5), I can at turn 58 choose not to go U to (3,6), but go somewhere else, but then the food disappears at turn 59, so I miss it.\n\nLife span 2 at turn 57, so available turn 57 and 58, gone at 59.\n\nSo at turn 58, I must eat it or lose it.\n\nSo I have to go to (3,6) at turn 58 if possible.\n\nIn both cases, I end up eating it and then moving to (2,6) at turn 59.\n\nBut there is food at (5,3) that I need to eat within 5 turns.\n\nLife span 5, available turns 57 to 61.\n\nTurn 57 now, so I have until turn 61 to eat it.\n\nAfter turn 59, I am at (2,6), which is far from (5,3).\n\nI need to head south-east.\n\nAlso, there is (5,2) food, but under tail initially, but tail has moved.\n\nAfter turn 58, when I eat (3,6), tail is at (4,2) or something.\n\nIn the first sequence: after turn 58 eat, tail at (4,2)\n\n(5,2) is free with food, since tail moved away.\n\nIn the move to eat (3,6), tail was at (4,2) after growth, and (5,2) is free.\n\nBut (5,2) has food, so I can go to eat it.\n\nBut from (3,6), it's not easy.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nPerhaps at turn 57, instead of going towards (3,6), I can go to (5,3) first, but (3,6) has short life, so I might miss it if I don't go now.\n\nFor example, if at turn 57 I go U to (4,6), then at turn 58 I can go R to (5,6) instead of L to (3,6), but then I miss the food at (3,6), and it disappears.\n\nSo I lose a point.\n\nSimilarly, if I go L to (3,5) at turn 57, and at turn 58 go D to (3,4) instead of U, I miss the food.\n\nSo to maximize score, I should eat the food since it's positive and available.\n\nSo I think I have to eat (3,6) by turn 58.\n\nThen after that, go to (5,3).\n\nBut from (3,6), after moving to (2,6), I can go down.\n\nLet's outline a sequence.\n\nTurn 57: go U to (4,6)  // or L, but let's pick U for now\n\nTurn 58: go L to (3,6) eat food, head at (3,6), direction L\n\nTurn 59: go L to (2,6)  // to avoid dead end, head at (2,6), direction L\n\nNow at (2,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (2,5), L to (1,6), R to (3,6) occupied.\n\nSo D or L.\n\n(2,5) is free, (1,6) free.\n\nI can go D to (2,5) to head down.\n\nTurn 59: go D to (2,5), head at (2,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 60: from (2,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, invalid, L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\nU is up, which is opposite to current D? Current direction D, so reverse is U, not allowed.\n\nSo cannot go U.\n\nD to (2,4) invalid.\n\nL to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is free, as before.\n\nSo go R to (3,5) or L to (1,5).\n\nGo to (3,5) to center.\n\nTurn 60: go R to (3,5), head at (3,5), direction R.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied? Current positions: let's track.\n\nAt turn 59 start: after turn 59 move to (2,6)? Let's list positions step by step.\n\nAfter turn 58: head at (3,6), body (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), tail (4,2)\n\nTurn 59: move L to (2,6)\n\nNew head (2,6)\n\nThen body: seg1 to (3,6), seg2 to (4,6), seg3 to (4,5), seg4 to (5,5), seg5 to (5,4), seg6 to (4,4), seg7 to (4,3), seg8 to (3,3), seg9 to (2,3), seg10 to (2,2), seg11 to (3,2), tail to (4,2)?

Old tail at (2,2), moved to old index10 position, which was (2,3), so tail at (2,3)\n\nAt turn 61, from (3,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6) occupied, D to (3,4), L to (2,5) occupied, R to (4,5) occupied.\n\nU occupied, L occupied, R occupied, D to (3,4) free? (3,4) not occupied, so go D to (3,4)\n\nThen head to (3,4), direction D.\n\nBut (3,4) is free, but from there, as before, only can go back to (3,5) or to (2,4) obstacle or (3,3) occupied, so trapped.\n\nAt turn 61, if I go to (3,4), I am trapped.\n\nBut I need to eat (5,3) at turn 61.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can only go D to (3,4), which is bad.\n\nAt turn 60, from (2,5), instead of going R to (3,5), I could go L to (1,5).\n\nThen head to (1,5), direction L.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can go to (1,4) or (1,6) or (2,5) occupied.\n\nBut (1,4) might be free, but then I am farther from (5,3).\n\nAnd time is short.\n\nTurn 61 is last chance to eat (5,3).\n\nFrom (1,5), it would take many moves to reach (5,3), impossible.\n\nSo the sequence leads to missing (5,3) or getting trapped.\n\nTherefore, going U first at turn 57 might not be good for reaching (5,3).\n\nIf at turn 57 I go L to (3,5) instead.\n\nTurn 57: go L to (3,5), head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 58: go U to (3,6) eat food, head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 59: go L to (2,6), head at (2,6), direction L.\n\nSame as before, then same problem.\n\nFrom (3,6), I could go R if possible, but in first case, when direction was L, I could go R, but (4,6) occupied.\n\nIn second case, when I ate by going U, direction U, I can go R to (4,6) but occupied, same.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (3,6) but then not go to (2,6), but I have to, because the other way is trap.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 57, go U to (4,6), then at turn 58, instead of going L to (3,6), go R to (5,6) to avoid the area, but then I miss the food.\n\nBut I can eat the food at (5,3) instead.\n\nBut (3,6) has short life, so if I miss it, I lose a point, but (5,3) is available longer.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat both if possible.\n\nBut in this case, from (4,6), if I go R to (5,6) at turn 58, then head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nThen I can go down to (5,5) but occupied, or to (5,7) wall, or (6,6), or (4,6) occupied.\n\n(6,6) free? Not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n\nGo to (6,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,5), (7,6) wall, etc.\n\nBut to reach (5,3), I need to go down.\n\nBut (5,5) is occupied, so I have to go around.\n\nMeanwhile, (3,6) food disappears at turn 59.\n\nSo I miss it.\n\nThen I have (5,3) to eat by turn 61.\n\nBut from (6,6), it might be possible, but let's see time.\n\nTurn 58: from (4,6) go R to (5,6), head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nBody moves: new head (5,6), seg1 to (4,6), seg2 to (4,5), etc., tail moves.\n\nPositions: after move, head (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2) or something.\n\nBut (5,3) is free.\n\nTurn 59: from (5,6), direction R, possible moves: U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5) occupied, L to (4,6) occupied, R to (6,6) free, so go R to (6,6).\n\nHead at (6,6), direction R.\n\nThen turn 60: from (6,6), direction R, possible moves: U to (6,7) wall, D to (6,5), L to (5,6) occupied, R to (7,6) wall, so go D to (6,5).\n\nHead at (6,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 61: from (6,5), direction D, possible moves: U to (6,6) occupied, D to (6,4), L to (5,5) occupied, R to (7,5) wall.\n\nD to (6,4), but (6,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nL to (5,5) occupied.\n\nU occupied.\n\nR wall.\n\nNo move, death.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nGo to (6,5) at turn 60, then at turn 61 stuck.\n\nIf at turn 60 from (6,6), I go L to (5,6) but occupied, not possible.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, missing (3,6) is risky and may not help.\n\nBetter to eat (3,6) and then try to reach (5,3).\n\nBut earlier sequence got me trapped at (3,5).\n\nAt turn 59, from (3,6), instead of going L to (2,6), I could go R if possible, but (4,6) occupied.\n\nOr in the case where I have direction U, I can go R but occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 57, if I go L to (3,5), then at turn 58, I am at (3,5), and I can go not U but D to (3,4) to avoid the dead end, but then I miss the food at (3,6).\n\nSince it's only turn 58, I can still go U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nI think I have to eat it.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (5,3) first.\n\nAt turn 57, from (4,5), I can only go U or L, not directly to (5,3).\n\nIf I go U to (4,6), then at turn 58, I can go to (4,7) wall, (3,6), (5,6), (4,5) occupied.\n\nSo to go towards (5,3), I can go to (5,6) then down, but (5,5) is occupied, so I need to go to (6,6) etc., as before, which led to death.\n\nIf I go L to (3,5) at turn 57, then at turn 58, I can go D to (3,4), then to (3,3) occupied, not good.\n\nGo R to (4,5) occupied, not allowed.\n\nOr L to (2,5), then down.\n\nBut not towards (5,3).\n\nSo it seems difficult to reach (5,3) in time if I eat (3,6) first.\n\nBut (5,3) has life span 5, turn 57 to 61, so after turn 58, I have turns 59,60,61 to eat it.\n\nFrom (2,6) at turn 59, I can go to (2,5), then to (3,5), but at (3,5) I can go to (3,4), then from (3,4) I can only go back, but if at turn 61 I go to (3,4), I can eat if there is food, but no, I need to reach (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,4), I am stuck.\n\nUnless the snake body moves away.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,5) at turn 59, then to (1,5) at turn 60, then to (1,4) at turn 61, but (5,3) is not reached.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt turn 59 from (2,6), go L to (1,6), then down to (1,5), (1,4), but far from (5,3).\n\nNo time.\n\nSo I need a different initial move.\n\nPerhaps at turn 57, go U to (4,6), but then at turn 58, instead of eating (3,6), go to (5,6) and then down, but as before, led to death at (6,5).\n\nNot good.\n\nMaybe I can eat the food at (5,3) immediately.\n\nBut from (4,5), I can go down to (4,4) but occupied.\n\nOr left to (3,5), then from (3,5) I can go to (4,5) occupied or (3,4) or (2,5).\n\nNot directly to (5,3).\n\nSo it takes multiple moves.\n\nLet's calculate the distance.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (5,3): delta x=1, delta y=2, so Manhattan distance 3, so at least 3 moves.\n\nSimilarly to (3,6): distance 1 in x and 1 in y, so 2 moves.\n\nBut from current position, I can reach (3,6) in 2 moves, (5,3) in 3 moves or more.\n\nAt turn 57, I can start moving towards (5,3).\n\nFor example, from (4,5), go U to (4,6), then at turn 58 go to (5,6), then at turn 59 go to (5,5) but occupied, so not possible.\n\nGo L to (3,5) at turn 57, then at turn 58 go to (3,4) or (4,5) not possible, so go to (3,4), then at turn 59 go to (4,4) occupied or (3,3) occupied, not good.\n\nGo to (2,5) at turn 58 from (3,5), then to (2,4) obstacle, or (2,6), or (1,5).\n\nThen no way to (5,3).\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach (5,3) within 4 turns from now if I am at (4,5).\n\nTurn 57 to turn 61 is 4 turns: 57,58,59,60,61, so 5 actions, but turn 57 action, then 58,59,60,61.\n\nAt turn 57 I move, then positions at start of turn 58, etc.\n\nTo eat at turn 61, I need to arrive at (5,3) on turn 61 move.\n\nFrom turn 57 start, head at (4,5), to (5,3) in 4 moves: for example, down-right-down or something, but down to (4,4) occupied, so not possible directly.\n\nPath: from (4,5) to (5,5) but occupied and not allowed.\n\nTo (4,6), then to (5,6), then to (5,5) occupied, not possible.\n\nTo (3,5), then to (3,4), then to (4,4) occupied, not possible.\n\nTo (3,5), then to (4,5) occupied, not.\n\nNo direct path because of body blocks.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach (5,3) by turn 61; it's blocked or too far with obstacles.\n\nSo I should focus on eating (3,6) and then the food at (5,2) which has longer life.\n\n(5,2) has life span 8, so available turns 57 to 64.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), I can go to (5,2).\n\nFor example, from the sequence where I am at (2,6) at turn 59.\n\nThen I can head south and east to (5,2).\n\nAlso, (5,2) is free after tail moves.\n\nIn the first few turns, when I eat (3,6), tail is at (4,2), and (5,2) is free with food.\n\nBut I am at (3,6), far away.\n\nBut with 8 turns, I can reach it.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) at turn 59, go D to (2,5), then R to (3,5), but at (3,5) I can go D to (3,4), then to (4,4) occupied, not.\n\nFrom (2,5), go to (3,5), then if I go to (3,4), trapped.\n\nBut if at some point the body moves, (4,4) might be free later.\n\nFor example, in the positions after turn 59, we have (4,4) occupied, but as snake moves, it may vacate.\n\nLet's list positions at turn 59 after move to (2,6): head (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) tail\n\n(4,4) is occupied.\n\nIf I move the head to (1,6) or (2,5), the body moves, and (4,4) may still be occupied for a while.\n\nBut eventually, if I move down, the tail will follow.\n\nFor example, at turn 59 from (2,6) go D to (2,5), head (2,5)\n\nPositions: head (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) tail at (3,2) moved to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 60 from (2,5) go L to (1,5), head (1,5)\n\nThen body moves: seg1 to (2,5), seg2 to (2,6), etc., tail to (2,3) or something.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can go to (1,4), then to (1,3), etc., but to reach (5,2), it takes many moves, but with life span 8, possible.\n\nBut I also have (5,3) to eat if possible, but I may not reach it in time.\n\nSince (5,3) may be impossible to reach, I should abandon it and go for (5,2).\n\nBut let's confirm if (5,3) can be reached.\n\nSuppose at turn 57 I go U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 58 go R to (5,6)  // miss (3,6)\n\nHead at (5,6), direction R.\n\nThen turn 59 go R to (6,6)\n\nHead at (6,6), direction R.\n\nThen turn 60 go D to (6,5)\n\nHead at (6,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 61: from (6,5), as before, no move, death.\n\nIf at turn 60 from (6,6) I go D to (6,5), same.\n\nOr from (5,6) at turn 59, I can go D to (5,5) but occupied, not possible.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTherefore, it's better to eat (3,6) and then go for (5,2).\n\nFor the initial choice, at turn 57, I can go U or L.\n\nIf I go L to (3,5), I am closer to the bottom, so after eating (3,6), I can go down faster.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 57: go L to (3,5)  // head at (3,5), direction L\n\nTurn 58: go U to (3,6) eat food  // head at (3,6), direction U\n\nTurn 59: go L to (2,6)  // to avoid dead end, head at (2,6), direction L\n\nTurn 60: go D to (2,5)  // head at (2,5), direction D\n\nTurn 61: from (2,5), go R to (3,5)  // head at (3,5), direction R\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go D to (3,4) at turn 62, but (3,4) may be free, and from there I can go to (4,4) but occupied, or if I wait, the body moves.\n\nAt turn 61, positions: let's not list all, but (4,4) is still occupied.\n\nBut at some point, it will be free.\n\nSince (5,2) has long life, I can go to (1,5) first or something.\n\nBut let's think about (5,2) food.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which was tail initially, but after moves, it's free.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 57, tail at (5,2), after turn 57 move, tail moves to (4,2) or (5,2) depending on move.\n\nIf I go U at turn 57, tail moves to (4,2), (5,2) free with food.\n\nSimilarly if go L, tail at (5,2) still, but after turn 58, when I eat, tail moves.\n\nIn both cases, (5,2) is free after turn 58.\n\nThen I can go to eat it.\n\nFrom (3,6) at turn 58, I can go to (5,2) in several moves.\n\nFor example, from (3,6) go to (4,6) occupied, not.\n\nFrom (2,6) at turn 59, go to (2,5), then to (3,5), then to (4,5) occupied, not.\n\nGo to (3,5) at turn 61, then to (4,5) when free.\n\nBut at turn 61, (4,5) is occupied.\n\nAs the snake moves, the body shifts.\n\nFor example, if I move the head to the left, the body follows, and the right side may open up.\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nSince (5,2) has life span 8, I have until turn 64 to eat it.\n\nTurn 57 to 64, 8 turns.\n\nAfter turn 58, I start from (3,6), with 6 turns to reach (5,2), which is possible.\n\nFor example, from (3,6) go L to (2,6) at turn 59, then D to (2,5) at turn 60, then L to (1,5) at turn 61, then D to (1,4) at turn 62, then R to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nGo from (1,5) to (1,6) or (1,4).\n\n(1,4) then to (1,3), then to (2,3) occupied, not.\n\nComplicated.\n\nFrom (2,5) at turn 60, go R to (3,5), then at turn 61 go D to (3,4), then at turn 62 go to (4,4) when free, but at turn 62, (4,4) may be free if the snake moved.\n\nAssume I move in a way that the body vacates.\n\nFor simplicity, at turn 57, I go U to (4,6) to be closer to the right side.\n\nThen turn 58 go L to (3,6) eat.\n\nTurn 59 go L to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 60 go D to (2,5).\n\nTurn 61 go R to (3,5).\n\nNow at turn 61, positions: head at (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), tail at (2,2) or something.\n\n(4,4) is occupied.\n\nAt turn 62, from (3,5), I can go D to (3,4) if free.\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nGo to (3,4), head at (3,4), direction D.\n\nThen from (3,4), can go U to (3,5), D to (3,3) occupied, L to (2,4) obstacle, R to (4,4) occupied, so only U back to (3,5), trapped.\n\nSame problem.\n\nTo avoid this, from (3,5) at turn 61, I can go U to (3,6) but occupied, or L to (2,5) occupied, or R to (4,5) occupied, so only D to (3,4), which is trap.\n\nSo the only way is not to go to (3,5) at all.\n\nFrom (2,5) at turn 60, instead of going R to (3,5), go L to (1,5).\n\nThen head at (1,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 61 go D to (1,4), head at (1,4), direction D.\n\nThen turn 62 go D to (1,3), head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nThen turn 63 go R to (2,3) but (2,3) may be occupied or free.\n\nAt turn 63, after previous moves, (2,3) might be free.\n\nBut (2,3) is near the body.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps for turn 57, I should go L to (3,5) to be at (3,5) at turn 57, then at turn 58, instead of going U to (3,6), I go D to (3,4) to start moving down, but then I miss the food at (3,6), and it's positive, so I lose a point.\n\nBut to avoid the trap, it might be better.\n\nThen I can go to (5,3) directly.\n\nTurn 57: go L to (3,5)  // head at (3,5), direction L\n\nTurn 58: go D to (3,4)  // miss food, head at (3,4), direction D\n\nBut at (3,4), I can go U to (3,5), D to (3,3) occupied, L to (2,4) obstacle, R to (4,4) occupied, so only U, but U is reverse? Current direction D, so reverse U not allowed.\n\nNo move, death immediately at turn 58.\n\nWorse.\n\nGo to (3,5) at turn 57, then at turn 58 go U to (3,6) to eat, must.\n\nI think I have to accept that after eating (3,6), I go to (2,6) and then down to the left and eventually to (5,2).\n\nFor example, turn 57: go L to (3,5)  // let's choose L for turn 57\n\nTurn 58: go U to (3,6) eat\n\nTurn 59: go L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 60: go D to (2,5)\n\nTurn 61: go L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 62: go D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 63: go D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 64: go R to (2,3)  // if free\n\nAt turn 64, (2,3) might be free, then from there to (2,2) occupied or (3,3) occupied, not good.\n\nGo to (1,3) at turn 63, then to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nFrom (1,4) at turn 62, go R to (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only down to (1,3), then to (1,2) invalid, or to (2,3) if free.\n\nBut at some point, it may be free.\n\nBut it's risky.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (5,2) via the bottom.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I should provide the moves for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSince the food at (5,3) may not be reachable, I should focus on surviving and eating (3,6) and then (5,2).\n\nFor turn 57, I'll go U to (4,6) to be closer to the right.\n\nThen turn 58 go L to (3,6) eat.\n\nTurn 59 go L to (2,6).\n\nThen for turn 60, go D to (2,5).\n\nTurn 61 go L to (1,5) or R to (3,5), but R to (3,5) leads to trap, so go L to (1,5).\n\nThen turn 62 go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output turns from t1=57.\n\nSo for turn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: L\n\nTurn 59: L\n\nTurn 60: D\n\nTurn 61: L\n\netc.\n\nBut I need to specify 5 turns or so.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", so for the answer format, output actions for turn 57,58,59,etc.\n\nSince the grid is small, and with obstacles, it might be tight, but I think going towards the food with short life is better.\n\nAlso, for (5,2) food, when I eat it, I need to ensure not adjacent to tail.\n\nBut later.\n\nSo I think for now:\n\nTurn 57: U (up) to (4,6)\n\nTurn 58: L (left) to (3,6) eat food\n\nTurn 59: L (left) to (2,6) for safety\n\nThen for turn 60: D (down) to (2,5)\n\nTurn 61: since from (2,5), can go L to (1,5) or R to (3,5), but R to (3,5) may lead to trap, so go L to (1,5) to explore left area.\n\nThen later turn 62: from (1,5) go D to (1,4)\n\netc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 61 or so.\n\nSince the format is to output for the turns starting from t1.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes, so I need to consider no instant reverse.\n\nIn turn 59, from (3,6) direction L, I go L to (2,6), good.\n\nTurn 60 from (2,6) direction L, I go D to (2,5), not reverse, good.\n\nTurn 61 from (2,5) direction D, I go L to (1,5), which is left, not reverse, good.\n\nThen turn 62 from (1,5) direction L, I can go D to (1,4), etc.\n\nSo for the box, I'll output:\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: L\n\nTurn 59: L\n\nTurn 60: D\n\nTurn 61: L\n\nBut turn 61 is turn t1+4, since t1=57, turn 58 is t1+1, etc.\n\nTurn 57: t1\n\nTurn 58: t1+1\n\nTurn 59: t1+2\n\nTurn 60: t1+3\n\nTurn 61: t1+4\n\nSo 5 turns.\n\nAnd for survival, after that, I can go to (1,4), then to (1,3), then to (2,3) if free, then to (3,3) etc., towards (5,2).\n\nBut with life span 8, turn 57 to 64, at turn 64 I can eat, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (5,3) I may miss, but it's not reachable, so it's ok.\n\nSo I think this is the best.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 57):**\n- **Snake Head**: (4,5), direction Left (L).\n- **Snake Positions**: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)] (11 segments, tail at (5,2)).\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,6): value +1, life span 2 (available turns 57–58, disappears at turn 59).\n  - (5,3): value +1, life span 5 (available turns 57–61, disappears at turn 62).\n  - (5,2): value +1, life span 8 (available turns 57–64, disappears at turn 65). This food is under the tail and can only be eaten if the tail moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n- **Walls and Obstacles**:\n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (entire row/column walls).\n  - Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n- **Constraints**:\n  - Current direction is L, so instant reverse (R) is not allowed on turn 57.\n  - From (4,5), valid moves are U (to (4,6)) or L (to (3,5)); D (to (4,4)) and R (to (5,5)) are invalid due to body collision and reverse direction.\n\n**Key Considerations for 5+ Turn Planning:**\n1. **Prioritize Short-Life Food**: Food at (3,6) must be eaten by turn 58 to avoid loss (+1 score). It is reachable in 2 moves from (4,5) via U then L or L then U.\n2. **Avoid Dead Ends**: After eating (3,6), moving directly down to (3,5) leads to a dead end at (3,4) (only U move back, causing self-trapping). Instead, moving left to (2,6) is safer for long-term mobility.\n3. **Food at (5,3)**: \n   - Life span allows eating until turn 61, but the path is blocked by snake body (e.g., (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5) occupied). Reaching (5,3) within 4 moves (turns 58–61) is impossible due to body positions and obstacles. Thus, (5,3) is abandoned to avoid unnecessary risk.\n4. **Food at (5,2)**:\n   - Under tail initially; can be eaten after tail moves away (e.g., after turn 58). Life span is long (until turn 64), so it can be targeted later.\n   - Must ensure head is not adjacent to tail when eating to avoid \"Tail Reward Danger\" collision.\n5. **Long-Term Survival Strategy**:\n   - Eat (3,6) immediately to secure +1 score.\n   - After eating, navigate to open areas (left side) to avoid body collisions and access (5,2) later.\n   - Sequence for turns 57–61 focuses on survival, positioning for (5,2), and avoiding traps.\n6. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - Moving towards (3,6) has no immediate collision risk.\n   - After turn 59, moving left and down keeps options open; going right (e.g., to (3,5)) risks entrapment.\n   - (5,2) will be targeted after turn 61 using remaining life span.\n\n**Planned Moves (Turns 57–61):**\n- **Turn 57 (t1)**: Move U to (4,6). \n  - Why: From (4,5), U is safe and positions better for eating (3,6) next turn. L is equally valid but U slightly favors future access to the right side.\n- **Turn 58 (t1+1)**: Move L to (3,6) to eat food (+1 score). \n  - Why: (3,6) must be eaten this turn (life span 2); moving L from (4,6) eats it safely.\n- **Turn 59 (t1+2)**: Move L to (2,6). \n  - Why: Avoids dead end at (3,5)–(3,4). (2,6) is safe and maintains mobility.\n- **Turn 60 (t1+3)**: Move D to (2,5). \n  - Why: Heads down to open space; avoids reverse (from direction L, D is valid).\n- **Turn 61 (t1+4)**: Move L to (1,5). \n  - Why: Explores left area for future pathing to (5,2); avoids risky (3,5). L from (2,5) is valid (direction D, L not reverse).\n\n**Beyond Turn 61:**\n- Target (5,2) for eating around turns 62–64. Path: From (1,5), move D to (1,4) (turn 62), then D to (1,3) (turn 63), then R to (2,3) (if free, turn 64). Ensure head is not adjacent to tail when eating (5,2).\n- Monitor food life spans: (5,2) must be eaten by turn 64.\n- Survival: Avoid walls/obstacles; prioritize open moves over risky food if needed.\n\nThis plan maximizes score by eating (3,6), abandons unreachable (5,3), and sets up for (5,2) with minimal risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 57: U \\\\\nTurn 58: L \\\\\nTurn 59: L \\\\\nTurn 60: D \\\\\nTurn 61: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 58, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls and can't be moved to. Also, there are internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I should plot this to visualize.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,6), and body segments: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). So the snake is 11 segments long. Head direction is U, which is up, so currently moving upwards.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,6) with value 1 and life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n\n- (5,3) with value 1 and life span 4\n\n- (5,2) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (2,5) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, the head is at (4,6) and direction is U, so if it continues up, it would go to (4,7). But y=7 is a wall, so that would be a wall collision. y=7 is a border wall, so moving to (4,7) is invalid and deadly.\n\nTherefore, moving up is not an option; it's suicide. So I must change direction.\n\nPossible moves from (4,6) with current direction U: since no instant reverse, I can't go down (which would be opposite), so I can go left (L) to (3,6) or right (R) to (5,6), or up, but up is wall, so only left or right.\n\nDirections: U, D, L, R. But U is into wall, D is opposite to current U, so not allowed. So only L or R.\n\nL: to (3,6)\n\nR: to (5,6)\n\nNow, (3,6) has food! Food at (3,6) with life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. If I move left to (3,6), I can eat it this turn.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's see what happens if I eat the food at (3,6).\n\nIf I move to (3,6), I eat the food, so snake grows by one segment. New head position (3,6), and the body will follow. Current tail is at (4,2), I think.\n\nSnake positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). So tail is (4,2).\n\nAfter moving to (3,6) and eating, new head at (3,6), and since I eat, I add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and the body shifts. When you eat, the snake grows, so the head moves to the new position, and a new segment is added at the end, so the tail stays in place for that turn.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, but since you grow, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added. So length increases by one.\n\nIn terms of positions: if head moves to new cell with food, the head is now there, the previous head becomes part of body, and the tail remains, so positions grow by one cell.\n\nHere, if I move to (3,6), which has food, so new positions: head at (3,6), then previous head (4,6) becomes body, then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) — and since I ate, I add a new segment, so tail is still (4,2), but the segment that was tail is now second last, and new tail is the old tail position? No.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nBefore move: positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) ] head at (4,6), tail at (4,2)\n\nAfter moving to (3,6) and eating food:\n\n- Head moves to (3,6)\n\n- The body segments move: the first body segment (4,5) moves to where head was? No.\n\nIn snake, when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front, tail moves away from its position.\n\nBut when eating, head moves to food, body follows as usual, but tail doesn't move; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays, and length increases.\n\nSo positions after eating:\n\n- New head: (3,6)\n\n- Then the previous head (4,6) becomes the first body segment\n\n- Then the next segments: (4,5) stays (4,5) but now it's second body segment? Let's list the new positions.\n\nThe movement: head moves from (4,6) to (3,6). So new head position: (3,6)\n\nThen, the body segments: the segment that was at position 1 (index 1, (4,5)) moves to where head was, (4,6)? No.\n\nTypically, the head moves to new cell. Then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the segment that was before it in the chain.\n\nSo:\n\n- Segment 0 (head) moves to new position: (3,6)\n\n- Segment 1 (which was at (4,5)) moves to the old position of segment 0, which is (4,6)\n\n- Segment 2 (which was at (5,5)) moves to the old position of segment 1, which is (4,5)\n\n- Segment 3 (which was at (5,4)) moves to the old position of segment 2, which is (5,5)\n\nAnd so on, down to the tail.\n\nSince we eat food, we don't remove the tail; we keep it, so the tail position stays, and we add a new segment at the end.\n\nBefore move, there are 11 segments: indices 0 to 10, with 0=head, 10=tail.\n\nAfter move and eat:\n\n- New head at (3,6)\n\n- New segment 1 at (4,6)  // old head position\n\n- New segment 2 at (4,5)  // position of old segment 1\n\n- New segment 3 at (5,5)  // position of old segment 2\n\n- New segment 4 at (5,4)  // position of old segment 3\n\n- New segment 5 at (4,4)  // position of old segment 4\n\n- New segment 6 at (4,3)  // position of old segment 5\n\n- New segment 7 at (3,3)  // position of old segment 6\n\n- New segment 8 at (2,3)  // position of old segment 7\n\n- New segment 9 at (2,2)  // position of old segment 8\n\n- New segment 10 at (3,2)  // position of old segment 9\n\n- New segment 11 at (4,2)  // position of old segment 10, which was tail, and since we eat, we add a new segment here, so tail is now at (4,2)\n\nThe positions: after move, the tail segment (old segment 10) is still at (4,2) because it hasn't moved yet? I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard way: when snake moves to a cell without food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nWhen snake moves to a cell with food, head moves to food cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but the tail does not vacate; instead, the tail stays, and we have a new segment added, so the snake grows.\n\nSo the new positions are:\n\n- Head: new position (3,6)\n\n- Body segment 1: old head position (4,6)\n\n- Body segment 2: old position of segment 1, which is (4,5)\n\n- Body segment 3: old position of segment 2, which is (5,5)\n\n- Body segment 4: old position of segment 3, which is (5,4)\n\n- Body segment 5: old position of segment 4, which is (4,4)\n\n- Body segment 6: old position of segment 5, which is (4,3)\n\n- Body segment 7: old position of segment 6, which is (3,3)\n\n- Body segment 8: old position of segment 7, which is (2,3)\n\n- Body segment 9: old position of segment 8, which is (2,2)\n\n- Body segment 10: old position of segment 9, which is (3,2)\n\n- And since we ate, we add a new body segment at the old position of segment 10, which is (4,2), so new segment 11 at (4,2)\n\nSo the new snake positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nHead at (3,6), tail at (4,2)\n\nNow, the food at (3,6) is eaten, so it's gone.\n\nNow, life span: the food at (3,6) has life span 1, so after this turn, it disappears anyway, but I ate it, so it's removed.\n\nNow, for turn 58, if I move left to (3,6), I eat it.\n\nBut is it safe? Let's see the board.\n\nFirst, where can I move from here.\n\nBut I need to think about risks.\n\nThere's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, after eating, the tail is at (4,2), and head is at (3,6), which are not adjacent; (3,6) and (4,2) are far apart, so no issue.\n\nAdjacent means sharing a side, so (3,6) and (4,2) are not adjacent; difference in x and y is not both 1? |dx|=1, |dy|=4, not adjacent.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut moving to (3,6): is (3,6) occupied by body? Current positions: (4,6) is head, (4,5), (5,5), etc., (3,6) is not in the snake positions, it's a food cell, so moving there is fine.\n\nBut after moving, as above, the body will be at (4,6), etc.\n\nNow, from (3,6), head direction: since I moved left, new direction is L.\n\nPossible moves from (3,6): current direction L, so I can go L, U, D? Directions: from (3,6), with direction L.\n\nCannot go right (opposite), so can go left to (2,6), up to (3,7), or down to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,7): y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nDown to (3,5): is that free?\n\nCurrent positions: after move, body at (4,6), (4,5), etc. (3,5) is not occupied by snake, I think.\n\nBefore move, positions include (4,5), (5,5), etc., but not (3,5). After move, positions are (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), etc., so (3,5) is empty.\n\nAlso, walls: (3,7) is wall, (2,6) might be ok, but let's see obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (3,5) not obstacle.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps eating the food at (3,6) is good because it will disappear anyway, and I get +1.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother option: move right to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is not food, I think. Food are at (3,6), (5,3), (5,2), (2,5). So (5,6) has no food.\n\nIf I move to (5,6), no food, so snake doesn't grow.\n\nHead moves to (5,6), body: segment 1 to (4,6), segment 2 to (4,5), ..., segment 10 to (3,2), and tail (4,2) is removed? No, without eating, tail moves.\n\nIf no food, head to (5,6), then segment 1 to (4,6), segment 2 to (4,5), segment 3 to (5,5), segment 4 to (5,4), segment 5 to (4,4), segment 6 to (4,3), segment 7 to (3,3), segment 8 to (2,3), segment 9 to (2,2), segment 10 to (3,2), and the old tail (4,2) is vacated, so tail is now at (3,2).\n\nPositions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nTail at (3,2)\n\nLength 11, same as before.\n\nNow, from (5,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nPossible moves: cannot go left (opposite), so can go right to (6,6), up to (5,7), down to (5,5).\n\n(5,7) is y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n(6,6): is it wall? x=6, but border walls x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is not wall, but internal obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,6) not listed, so probably free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is currently occupied by body? After move, (5,5) is a body segment, so moving to (5,5) would be body collision.\n\nLet's see: after moving to (5,6), positions are: (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), ... so (5,5) is the fourth segment, so moving down to (5,5) from (5,6) would be moving into the body, which is deadly.\n\nSo from (5,6), possible moves: right to (6,6) or up/down, but up is wall, down is body, so only right to (6,6) is possible? Or left, but left is opposite, not allowed.\n\nDirections from (5,6) with direction R: can go R, U, D.\n\nU: (5,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD: (5,5) is body, collision.\n\nR: (6,6) , which should be free, as not wall or body.\n\n(6,6) not in walls: walls are x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (6,6) not listed, so free.\n\nAnd not in snake positions after move.\n\nSo from (5,6), only possible move is right to (6,6).\n\nThen from (6,6), direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (6,7) wall, D to (6,5), L to (5,6) but (5,6) is body now, or R to (7,6) but x=7 wall.\n\nAfter moving to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) — tail at (3,2)\n\nFrom (6,6), direction R.\n\nCan go R to (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nU to (6,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,5), which is not body or wall? (6,5) not in positions, not wall.\n\nL to (5,6), which is body segment, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (6,5).\n\nThen from (6,5), direction D.\n\nAnd so on. But this seems like a dead end, leading to the right side where there are few options.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (5,3) and (5,2), but I'm moving away.\n\nSo moving right might not be good for long-term.\n\nNow back to moving left to (3,6) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, head at (3,6), direction L.\n\nFrom (3,6), possible moves: L to (2,6), U to (3,7) wall, D to (3,5).\n\n(3,7) wall, so only L or D.\n\nL to (2,6): is (2,6) free? Not wall, not body.\n\nAfter move, positions: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), etc., so (2,6) not occupied.\n\nInternal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,6) not listed, so free.\n\nD to (3,5): similarly free.\n\nNow, food available: after turn 58, food at (3,6) eaten, so gone.\n\nRemaining food: (5,3) life span 4, so disappears after turn 58+4=62, so available turns 58,59,60,61.\n\n(5,2) life span 7, disappear after turn 58+7=65, available 58 to 64.\n\n(2,5) life span 10, disappear after turn 58+10=68, available 58 to 67.\n\nBut life span decreases each turn, including current, so for food at turn t, life span n, it can be eaten on turns from t to t+n-1, I think? Let's see.\n\nFood has life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo at turn t, life span n, it will disappear after n more turns, meaning it can be eaten on this turn or the next n-1 turns? Disappears after N turns from now, so it exists for N turns including current.\n\nFor example, life span 1 at turn 58: it exists at turn 58, and disappears after turn 58, so only on turn 58.\n\nLife span 4 at turn 58: exists turns 58,59,60,61; disappears after turn 61, so not on turn 62.\n\nSimilarly, life span 7: exists turns 58 to 64, gone turn 65.\n\nLife span 10: exists 58 to 67, gone 68.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nIf I move left to (3,6) on turn 58, I eat the food there.\n\nThen for turn 59, head at (3,6), direction L.\n\nI need to choose action for turn 59.\n\nOptions: L to (2,6) or D to (3,5).\n\nIf I go L to (2,6), then from there, direction L.\n\nThen possible moves from (2,6): cannot go R (opposite), so U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6).\n\n(2,7) wall, (1,6) not wall, (2,5) not wall but there is food at (2,5) with value 1.\n\n(2,5) is food, and not occupied by snake currently.\n\nBut after moving to (2,6), if I go to (2,5), I can eat it.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nIf I go D to (3,5) on turn 59 from (3,6).\n\n(3,5) is empty, no food there.\n\nThen from (3,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: from (3,5), dir D, can go D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5), cannot go U opposite.\n\n(3,4) not occupied, (2,5) is food, (4,5) is body? Let's see positions after turn 58 and 59.\n\nAfter turn 58: snake at [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] head (3,6)\n\nTurn 59: move D to (3,5), no food there, so no grow, head to (3,5), body: segment 1 to (3,6), segment 2 to (4,6), segment 3 to (4,5), segment 4 to (5,5), ..., segment 11 to (3,2), and tail (4,2) vacated, so new tail at (3,2)? Positions: head (3,5), then (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nTail at (3,2)\n\nFrom (3,5), dir D, can go D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is body segment (the third segment after head), so moving to (4,5) collision.\n\n(3,4) not occupied, (2,5) is food and not occupied.\n\nSo can go to (3,4) or (2,5).\n\nIf go to (2,5), eat food.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the grid and plan a path.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, but walls at borders, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except obstacles.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but (0,0) to (7,7) with borders walls, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are inside, but internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo let's list all obstacles:\n\n- Border: all x=0, x=7 for all y; all y=0, y=7 for all x.\n\n- Internal: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\n(1,2) is internal obstacle.\n\nNow snake positions turn 58: head (4,6), body (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left and down.\n\nFood: (3,6), (5,3), (5,2), (2,5)\n\nNow, if I move left to (3,6) on turn 58, I eat (3,6), which is good since it expires now.\n\nThen on turn 59, from (3,6) dir L, I can go to (2,6) or (3,5).\n\nIf I go to (2,6), then from (2,6) dir L, I can go to (1,6) or (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food, so I might eat it on turn 60.\n\nBut let's see if that causes problem.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), snake is longer, tail at (4,2).\n\nIf I go to (2,6) on turn 59, no food, so head to (2,6), body moves, tail moves.\n\nThen from (2,6) to (2,5) on turn 60, eat food at (2,5), grow again.\n\nBut is there risk?\n\nAnother food at (5,3) and (5,2), which are on the right.\n\nBut the snake body is blocking the area.\n\nNotice that the body has segments at (5,5), (5,4), so (5,3) is below, but (5,3) is food, and (5,2) below.\n\nBut from current position, if I move right, I can go to (5,6), then only to (6,6), then (6,5), etc., but (5,3) might be reachable later, but with life span 4, so I have until turn 61 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) life span 7, until turn 64.\n\nBut if I go left, I can get (3,6) and then (2,5) soon.\n\n(2,5) has life span 10, so no rush.\n\nBut (3,6) must be eaten now or never.\n\nSo I should eat (3,6) on turn 58.\n\nBut is it safe to move to (3,6)?\n\n(3,6) is adjacent to where? After moving, the body will be at (4,6), which is adjacent to head (3,6), but that's fine, as long as not colliding, which it doesn't at move time.\n\nAt the moment of move, head moves to (3,6), which was empty except for food, so no collision.\n\nThen body moves to (4,6), etc.\n\nSo safe.\n\nIf I don't eat it, it disappears, and I miss a point.\n\nBut moving right to (5,6) might lead to a trap.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (6,4), (5,1), etc., but on the right, it might be cramped.\n\nMoreover, from (5,6), I can only go to (6,6), then to (6,5), then from (6,5), dir D, can go D to (6,4), but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\nFrom (6,5), dir D, can go D to (6,4) wall, invalid; L to (5,5) body, collision; R to (7,5) wall; U to (6,6) body, collision.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), etc.\n\nFrom (6,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nCan go D to (6,4) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,5), which is body, collision.\n\nR to (7,5) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nU to (6,6), which is body segment (just behind head), collision.\n\nSo no possible moves! Dead end on turn 60 if I go right on turn 58.\n\nTurn 58: move R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 59: only move R to (6,6)\n\nTurn 60: from (6,6) only move D to (6,5)\n\nTurn 61: from (6,5) no possible moves, die.\n\nSo moving right on turn 58 leads to death on turn 61.\n\nTherefore, I must not move right; it's suicidal.\n\nSo only option is to move left to (3,6) on turn 58 to eat the food.\n\nThen for turn 59, from (3,6) dir L.\n\nI need to choose action for turn 59.\n\nOptions: L to (2,6) or D to (3,5).\n\nIf I go L to (2,6), then from there, I can go to (2,5) or (1,6) later.\n\n(2,5) has food.\n\nIf I go D to (3,5), then I can go to (3,4) or (2,5) from there.\n\nBut (2,5) is food, and I might want to eat it.\n\nBut let's think about the tail and body.\n\nCurrent snake after turn 58 eat: positions [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] head (3,6)\n\nNow, on turn 59, if I move L to (2,6), no food there, so head to (2,6), body: segment 1 to (3,6), segment 2 to (4,6), segment 3 to (4,5), ..., segment 11 to (3,2), tail (4,2) vacated, so new positions: head (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) tail at (3,2)\n\nFrom (2,6), dir L.\n\nThen turn 60, I can move to (1,6) or (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food, so I might move to (2,5) and eat.\n\n(1,6) is also possible.\n\nBut (2,5) is adjacent to current positions? (2,5) is not occupied; in above, positions have (2,3), (2,2), but not (2,5).\n\nAfter move to (2,6), positions include (2,3) and (2,2), but (2,5) is free.\n\nIf I move to (2,5) on turn 60, I eat the food, grow.\n\nBut is there Tail Reward Danger? Head at (2,6), moving to (2,5), which is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (3,2), which is not adjacent to (2,5); (2,5) and (3,2) are far.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (2,5), and tail grows.\n\nBut no immediate collision.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move to other places.\n\nIf on turn 59 from (3,6) I move D to (3,5), no food, head to (3,5), body to (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), etc., tail moves to (3,2)? Positions: head (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) tail at (3,2)\n\nThen from (3,5) dir D, can go D to (3,4) or L to (2,5) to eat food, or R to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, collision.\n\n(4,5) is the fourth segment, so moving there kills.\n\nSo only (3,4) or (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food, so I might go there.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat food when possible, but avoid risks.\n\nThere is also food at (5,3) and (5,2), which are near the body.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), and current body has (5,5), (5,4), so (5,3) is below.\n\nBut with the snake occupying (5,5) and (5,4), to reach (5,3), I need to approach from the side or when the body moves.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (3,5) on turn 59, then to (3,4) or (2,5).\n\nIf I go to (2,5) on turn 60, eat, then head at (2,5), and so on.\n\nBut (5,3) might become reachable later.\n\nSince I have to plan multiple turns, I should define actions for turn 58,59,60,etc.\n\nBut the answer format is to output actions starting from turn t1, which is 58, for several turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", so I need to plan a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for now, on turn 58, I must move left to (3,6) to eat the food and avoid death.\n\nThen for turn 59, from (3,6) dir L, I should move down to (3,5) to avoid going to (2,6) which might be less flexible.\n\n(3,5) is central, and I can go to (3,4) or to (2,5) later.\n\n(2,6) is on the edge.\n\nMoreover, from (2,6), if I go to (1,6), (1,6) is free, but near obstacle (1,2), but (1,2) is at y=2, not issue.\n\nBut let's see the area.\n\nI think moving down to (3,5) on turn 59 might be better to keep options open.\n\nThen on turn 60, from (3,5) dir D, I can move to (2,5) to eat the food, or to (3,4).\n\nSince (2,5) has food and life span 10, I can eat it now or later, but to save it for when needed, but since it's positive, eating now is fine, but I might have other opportunities.\n\nBut to maximize, I should eat when convenient.\n\nThere is also (5,3) with shorter life span.\n\nAfter turn 58, if I eat (3,6), snake longer.\n\nThen on turn 59, if I move to (3,5), no grow.\n\nThen on turn 60, if I move to (2,5), eat, grow again.\n\nBut let's see the path to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), currently occupied? No, food is there, but snake body at (5,5), (5,4), so (5,3) is empty except food.\n\nTo eat (5,3), I need to move the head to (5,3) when it's accessible.\n\nFor example, if I can move down from above or left/right.\n\nBut with body at (5,5) and (5,4), if I approach from left or right, I might be able to eat it when the body moves away.\n\nFor instance, if I go to (4,4) or something.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, turn 58: move L to (3,6) to eat food. (action: L)\n\nThen turn 59: from (3,6) dir L, move D to (3,5) to avoid edge and go towards center. (action: D)\n\nNow turn 60: head at (3,5), dir D (since moved down).\n\nCan move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food, so I can eat it. Or go to (3,4).\n\nIf I eat (2,5), I grow, but the snake is getting longer, might be harder to maneuver.\n\nBut (2,5) has long life, I can leave it for now and go to (3,4) to approach other food.\n\n(5,3) has shorter life, only 4 turns, so I need to eat it soon.\n\nLife span at turn 58: 4, so must eat by turn 61.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) life span 7, by turn 64.\n\n(2,5) by turn 67.\n\nSo priority to eat (5,3) first.\n\nTherefore, from (3,5), I should not go to (2,5) yet, but go to (3,4) to head towards the right where (5,3) is.\n\nOn turn 60, move D to (3,4).\n\nThen head at (3,4), dir D.\n\nNow (3,4) is not food.\n\nThen turn 61, from (3,4) dir D, can move D to (3,3), but (3,3) is body? Let's track positions.\n\nAfter turn 58: snake at [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 59: move D to (3,5), no food, so head to (3,5), body: segment 1 to (3,6), segment 2 to (4,6), segment 3 to (4,5), segment 4 to (5,5), segment 5 to (5,4), segment 6 to (4,4), segment 7 to (4,3), segment 8 to (3,3), segment 9 to (2,3), segment 10 to (2,2), segment 11 to (3,2), and tail (4,2) vacated, so positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)] tail at (3,2)\n\nTurn 60: move D to (3,4), no food there, so head to (3,4), body: segment 1 to (3,5), segment 2 to (3,6), segment 3 to (4,6), segment 4 to (4,5), segment 5 to (5,5), segment 6 to (5,4), segment 7 to (4,4), segment 8 to (4,3), segment 9 to (3,3), segment 10 to (2,3), segment 11 to (2,2), tail (3,2) vacated, so new positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)] tail at (2,2)\n\nHead at (3,4), dir D.\n\nTurn 61: from (3,4) dir D, can move D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4), U opposite not allowed.\n\n(3,3) is now a body segment? In positions, (3,3) is the tenth segment, so moving to (3,3) would be collision.\n\n(2,4) is an internal obstacle! (2,4) is wall.\n\nR to (4,4): (4,4) is the eighth segment, body, collision.\n\nU to (3,5) is body, and opposite to dir, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo no possible moves from (3,4) on turn 61? That can't be.\n\n(3,3) is body, (2,4) is wall, (4,4) is body.\n\nIndeed, all directions blocked. Dead end.\n\nIf on turn 60 I moved to (3,4), I die on turn 61.\n\nTherefore, moving to (3,4) is bad.\n\nOn turn 60 from (3,5), instead of D to (3,4), I should move L to (2,5) to eat the food.\n\nThen on turn 60, move L to (2,5), eat food.\n\nHead to (2,5), new head, body: since eat, grow, so segment 1 to (3,5), segment 2 to (3,6), segment 3 to (4,6), etc., and new tail at (2,2) or something.\n\nLet's compute positions.\n\nAfter turn 59: positions [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)] head (3,5)\n\nTurn 60: move L to (2,5), which has food, so eat.\n\nNew head (2,5)\n\nThen new segment 1 at (3,5)  // old head\n\nNew segment 2 at (3,6)  // old segment 1\n\nNew segment 3 at (4,6)  // old segment 2\n\nNew segment 4 at (4,5)  // old segment 3\n\nNew segment 5 at (5,5)  // old segment 4\n\nNew segment 6 at (5,4)  // old segment 5\n\nNew segment 7 at (4,4)  // old segment 6\n\nNew segment 8 at (4,3)  // old segment 7\n\nNew segment 9 at (3,3)  // old segment 8\n\nNew segment 10 at (2,3)  // old segment 9\n\nNew segment 11 at (2,2)  // old segment 10\n\nNew segment 12 at (3,2)  // old segment 11, and since eat, add new segment, so tail at (3,2)\n\nPositions: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)] head (2,5), tail (3,2)\n\nDirection now L (since moved left).\n\nFrom (2,5), dir L, can go L to (1,5), U to (2,6), D to (2,4), R not allowed.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, wall.\n\n(2,6) not occupied, no wall.\n\n(1,5) not occupied, no wall.\n\n(1,5) is free, since no obstacle except (1,2).\n\nSo can go to (1,5) or (2,6).\n\nNow, I need to consider (5,3) food, which must be eaten soon.\n\nBut I'm at (2,5), far from (5,3).\n\nWith life span: at turn 60, (5,3) has life span? Originally at turn 58, life span 4, so at turn 60, it has 2 turns left: after turn 58, life span 4, so exists turn 58,59,60,61; disappear after turn 61, so can be eaten on turn 60 or 61.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 60, (5,3) can be eaten on turn 60 or 61.\n\nBut I'm at (2,5), and (5,3) is at (5,3), with body at (5,5), (5,4), (4,5), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,3) in two turns, from (2,5), I need to move right and down, but (2,5) to (5,3) is |dx|=3, |dy|=2, not reachable in one or two moves directly.\n\nFrom (2,5), to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, to (2,6), or (1,5), etc., not closer.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,6) on turn 61, then to (3,6) or something, but (3,6) is body.\n\nPositions have (3,6) occupied.\n\nFrom (2,5), if I go U to (2,6) on turn 61, then head to (2,6), body moves, then from (2,6) I can go to (3,6) but (3,6) is body, or to (1,6), etc., not to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) will be gone after turn 61, so I can't eat it in time if I'm on the left.\n\nTherefore, by moving to (2,5) on turn 60, I miss the chance to eat (5,3).\n\nBut on turn 60, if I don't eat (2,5), I could go to (3,4) but earlier we saw that from (3,4) I die.\n\nOn turn 60 from (3,5), I have to choose between (3,4) or (2,5), both have issues.\n\n(3,4) leads to death, (2,5) eats food but misses (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) is +1, same as others, but since I can eat it, I should try.\n\nPerhaps on turn 59, instead of moving D to (3,5), I should move L to (2,6) from (3,6).\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTurn 58: move L to (3,6) eat (3,6)\n\nThen turn 59: from (3,6) dir L, move L to (2,6) no food.\n\nHead to (2,6), body: segment 1 to (3,6), segment 2 to (4,6), segment 3 to (4,5), etc., tail moves, positions: head (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) tail at (3,2)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 60: from (2,6) dir L, can move L to (1,6), D to (2,5), U to (2,7) wall.\n\n(2,5) has food, so I can move to (2,5) and eat.\n\nThen similar to before, I eat (2,5), grow, head at (2,5), and I'm at (2,5) on turn 60, still far from (5,3), which I can't reach in time.\n\nIf on turn 60 I move to (1,6) instead, no food, head to (1,6), body moves, then from (1,6) I can go to (1,5) or (1,7) wall, or (2,6) body, etc., not helpful for (5,3).\n\nSo in both cases, I can't eat (5,3) before it expires.\n\nTherefore, to eat (5,3), I need to be closer on turn 60 or 61.\n\nOn turn 59, I should not move left or down from (3,6), but I have to, since only L or D.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 58, after eating (3,6), on turn 59 from (3,6) dir L, I move D to (3,5), but on turn 60, instead of moving to (3,4) or (2,5), I need to move in a way to free up space for (5,3).\n\nBut from (3,5), I can only go to (3,4) or (2,5), both not towards right.\n\n(3,5) to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, collision.\n\nSo impossible to go right from (3,5).\n\nTherefore, if I eat (3,6) on turn 58, I am trapped on the left and cannot reach (5,3) in time.\n\nBut (5,3) is not the only food; there is (5,2) with longer life.\n\nBut missing one point is not ideal.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (3,6) on turn 58, but that means I miss it, and moving right is death, so I have to eat it.\n\nOr is there another way?\n\nCurrent head at (4,6), direction U, but U is wall, D not allowed, so only L or R.\n\nR leads to death, L to (3,6) with food.\n\nSo I must move L to (3,6).\n\nThen for turn 59, from (3,6) dir L, I have to move to (2,6) or (3,5).\n\nNeither helps for (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) can be eaten if the body moves away.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves, the body at (5,5) and (5,4) might move, freeing (5,3) for later.\n\nBut to eat it, I need the head to be near.\n\nCurrently, after turn 58, head at (3,6), far.\n\nOn turn 59, if I move to (3,5), head at (3,5), still far.\n\nOn turn 60, if I move to (3,4), I die, or to (2,5), head at (2,5).\n\nFrom there, on turn 61, I can try to move, but (5,3) expires after turn 61, so on turn 61 I need to eat it.\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 60, after eating (2,5), head at (2,5), on turn 61, I can move U to (2,6) or L to (1,5) or D to (2,4) but (2,4) wall, so to (2,6) or (1,5).\n\nSay move to (2,6) on turn 61, no food, head to (2,6), body moves, then from (2,6) I can go to (3,6) but (3,6) body, or (1,6), etc.\n\nNo way to (5,3) in one move.\n\nSimilarly, if at (1,5), even farther.\n\nSo impossible to reach (5,3) by turn 61.\n\nTherefore, I will miss the (5,3) food.\n\nBut it's not the end; I can eat other food.\n\n(5,2) is still there with life span 7, so until turn 64.\n\nAnd (2,5) with life span 10.\n\nSo I can focus on those.\n\nFor long-term survival, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nAfter eating (3,6) on turn 58, on turn 59 I should move to (3,5) to be more central.\n\nThen on turn 60, move to (2,5) to eat that food, since it's there and I can grow.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move to (1,5) or (2,6) to explore.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (3,2) or something, so there might be space.\n\nThen I can head towards (5,2) later.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), with body at (5,4), (5,5), but as the snake moves, it might free up.\n\nFor example, if I move the head down or left.\n\nLet's outline a plan.\n\nTurn 58: move L to (3,6)  // eat (3,6)\n\nAction: L\n\nTurn 59: from (3,6) dir L, move D to (3,5)  // no food, to avoid edge\n\nAction: D\n\nTurn 60: from (3,5) dir D, move L to (2,5)  // eat (2,5)\n\nAction: L\n\nNow after turn 60, head at (2,5), dir L.\n\nPositions: as before, [(2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)] head (2,5), tail (3,2)\n\nTurn 61: from (2,5) dir L, can move L to (1,5), U to (2,6), D to (2,4) wall, so not D.\n\n(2,4) wall, so only L or U.\n\nI can move U to (2,6) or L to (1,5).\n\n(2,6) is free, no food.\n\n(1,5) free.\n\nSay move U to (2,6) to go up.\n\nAction: U\n\nThen head to (2,6), no food, so body moves, tail moves.\n\nPositions: head (2,6), then (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) tail at (2,2)? Let's compute: after turn 60, positions include (2,2), but when moving, tail moves.\n\nAfter turn 60: positions [(2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)] tail (3,2)\n\nTurn 61: move U to (2,6), no food, so head to (2,6), body: segment 1 to (2,5), segment 2 to (3,5), segment 3 to (3,6), segment 4 to (4,6), segment 5 to (4,5), segment 6 to (5,5), segment 7 to (5,4), segment 8 to (4,4), segment 9 to (4,3), segment 10 to (3,3), segment 11 to (2,3), segment 12 to (2,2), and tail (3,2) vacated, so new positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)] tail at (2,2)\n\nHead at (2,6), dir U (since moved up).\n\nTurn 62: from (2,6) dir U, can move U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6), R not allowed.\n\n(2,7) wall invalid, (2,5) is body segment (second after head), collision, (1,6) free.\n\nSo only move L to (1,6).\n\nAction: L\n\nHead to (1,6), no food, body moves, tail moves to (2,3) or something.\n\nPositions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), etc., tail at (2,2) vacated, new tail at (2,3)? Segment 12 was (2,2), so after move, positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)] tail at (2,3)\n\nNow, I have food at (5,2) with life span, at turn 58 it was 7, so at turn 62, it has 3 turns left (62,63,64), disappear after 64.\n\nI need to eat it soon.\n\nFrom (1,6), I can move to (1,5) or (1,7) wall, or (2,6) body.\n\nOnly to (1,5).\n\nThen from (1,5), and so on, I can go down to (1,4), etc., but it might take time to reach (5,2).\n\nSince the tail is moving, the body at (5,5), (5,4) might move away if I steer properly.\n\nFor example, if I move the head down the left side, the tail will follow, freeing the right side.\n\nBut I need to plan the path.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can output the first few moves.\n\nSince the question is to think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide actions for turns 58 to 62 or so.\n\nFor turn 58: L\n\nTurn 59: D\n\nTurn 60: L to (2,5) eat\n\nThen turn 61: U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 62: L to (1,6)\n\nThen turn 63: from (1,6) dir L, move D to (1,5) or U wall, or L to (0,6) wall, or R to (2,6) body.\n\nOnly D to (1,5).\n\nAction: D\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I think for the box, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps start with turn 58 L, then for turn 59, since (3,5) might be better, but both similar.\n\nAnother thought: on turn 59, if I move to (2,6) instead of (3,5), then on turn 60 I can move to (2,5) to eat.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut let's accept that I miss (5,3) but can eat (5,2) later.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), below (5,4) and (5,3).\n\nWith the body, I need to approach when possible.\n\nFor long-term, after eating the foods, I can circle around.\n\nBut for now, since I must answer, let's go with the sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 58: L\n\nTurn 59: D  // to (3,5)\n\nTurn 60: L  // to (2,5) eat\n\nThen for turn 61: from (2,5) dir L, move U to (2,6)  // as above\n\nTurn 62: from (2,6) dir U, move L to (1,6)\n\nTurn 63: from (1,6) dir L, move D to (1,5)\n\nTurn 64: from (1,5) dir D, can move D to (1,4), L to (0,5) wall, R to (2,5) body, U to (1,6) body.\n\nAfter turn 63: at (1,5), dir D (since moved down).\n\nPositions: after turn 62 move to (1,6), no food, head (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), etc., tail at (2,3)\n\nTurn 63: move D to (1,5), no food, head to (1,5), body to (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), and tail (2,3) vacated? Tail was at (2,3), so after move, positions: [(1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)] tail at (2,3)? Segment 13 was (2,3), but after move, new positions: head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) and since no eat, tail vacated, but the last position is (2,3), so tail at (2,3) still? No.\n\nBefore move, positions: 14 segments? After turn 62, with 13 segments, tail at (2,3).\n\nTurn 63 move to (1,5) no food, so head to (1,5), then each body segment moves to previous position: segment 1 to (1,6), segment 2 to (2,6), segment 3 to (2,5), segment 4 to (3,5), segment 5 to (3,6), segment 6 to (4,6), segment 7 to (4,5), segment 8 to (5,5), segment 9 to (5,4), segment 10 to (4,4), segment 11 to (4,3), segment 12 to (3,3), segment 13 to (2,3), and the old tail (2,3) is vacated, so new tail is at (2,3)? No, the position (2,3) is now occupied by segment 13, but since no new segment, the tail is at (2,3), but it's the same cell, but the segment that was tail is now moved to the position of the previous segment.\n\nAfter move, the tail is at the position where the second last was, so the cell (2,3) is vacated.\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) -- but (2,3) is the new position of the last segment, so tail at (2,3), but it was occupied, but now it's the tail position.\n\nFrom (1,5) dir D, can move D to (1,4), L to (0,5) wall, R to (2,5), U to (1,6).\n\n(2,5) is body segment (fourth after head), collision.\n\n(1,6) is body segment (second after head), collision.\n\n(1,4) not occupied, no wall.\n\nSo only move D to (1,4).\n\nSimilarly, I can continue down.\n\nBut to eat (5,2), I need to go right eventually.\n\nSince the tail is at (2,3), and I move down, the body might free up the top-right area.\n\nBut for the answer, I think for turn 58, I must move L.\n\nThen for turn 59, I can choose D or L, but both similar in the short term.\n\nLet's provide the sequence up to turn 62 or so.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 58: L\n\nTurn 59: D  // to (3,5)\n\nTurn 60: L  // to (2,5) eat\n\nTurn 61: U  // to (2,6)\n\nTurn 62: L  // to (1,6)\n\nThen for turn 63: D to (1,5) as above.\n\nBut I think it's acceptable.\n\nTo make it for 5 turns: turns 58 to 62.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 58: L\n\nTurn 59: D\n\nTurn 60: L\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: L\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut for turn 62, from (2,6) I moved L to (1,6), which is fine.\n\nNow, to box the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must carefully plan its moves at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing paths that avoid dead ends and allow access to remaining food while considering the snake's body positions, obstacles, and food life spans.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 58)\n- **Snake Position and Direction**: Head at (4,6), moving Up (U). The snake body occupies cells: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)].\n- **Food**: \n  - (3,6): Value +1, life span 1 (must be eaten on turn 58 or lost).\n  - (5,3): Value +1, life span 4 (can be eaten on turns 58–61).\n  - (5,2): Value +1, life span 7 (can be eaten on turns 58–64).\n  - (2,5): Value +1, life span 10 (can be eaten on turns 58–67).\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n- **Immediate Constraints**: \n  - Moving Up (U) to (4,7) is invalid (y=7 wall).\n  - Moving Down (D) is invalid (reverse move from current U direction not allowed).\n  - Only valid moves from (4,6) are Left (L) to (3,6) or Right (R) to (5,6).\n- **Risks**:\n  - Moving R to (5,6) leads to a dead end by turn 61 (no escape due to walls and body).\n  - Moving L to (3,6) eats the +1 food (life span 1) and avoids immediate death.\n- **Long-term Consideration**: \n  - (5,3) must be eaten soon (by turn 61), but after eating (3,6), the snake is positioned on the left, making (5,3) inaccessible in time. Thus, (5,3) will be missed, but (5,2) and (2,5) can be targeted later.\n  - After eating (3,6), moving Down (D) on turn 59 to (3,5) keeps the snake central and flexible.\n  - On turn 60, moving Left (L) to (2,5) eats the +1 food there and positions the snake to explore the left side.\n  - Subsequent moves avoid walls/obstacles and body collisions while freeing space for future food access.\n\n### Planned Moves (Turns 58–62)\nThe sequence below ensures the snake:\n- Eats two +1 foods immediately (turns 58 and 60).\n- Avoids all collisions and dead ends.\n- Maintains flexibility for future turns to target (5,2) and (2,5).\n- Prioritizes survival by steering away from the right-side trap and towards open areas.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 58: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 59: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 60: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 61: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 62: L (left)\n}\n\n### Detailed Reasoning for Each Turn\n- **Turn 58 (action: L)**: Move Left to (3,6) to eat the +1 food (life span 1, must be eaten now). New head position (3,6), direction L. Snake grows to 12 segments. Food (3,6) consumed.\n- **Turn 59 (action: D)**: From (3,6), direction L, move Down to (3,5). No food here, so no growth. New head position (3,5), direction D. This avoids the edge and keeps options open for accessing (2,5) or moving toward the center.\n- **Turn 60 (action: L)**: From (3,5), direction D, move Left to (2,5) to eat the +1 food. New head position (2,5), direction L. Snake grows to 13 segments. Food (2,5) consumed.\n- **Turn 61 (action: U)**: From (2,5), direction L, move Up to (2,6). No food here, so no growth. New head position (2,6), direction U. This move avoids the obstacle at (2,4) and positions the snake to explore upwards.\n- **Turn 62 (action: L)**: From (2,6), direction U, move Left to (1,6). No food here, so no growth. New head position (1,6), direction L. This move continues leftward exploration, freeing space near the tail and avoiding dead ends.\n\n### Future Outlook (Beyond Turn 62)\n- **Targeting Remaining Food**: \n  - (5,2) can be eaten on turns 63–64 by navigating down the left side (e.g., to (1,5), then (1,4), etc.) and eventually right when the body clears.\n  - (2,5) is already eaten; no other food is urgent.\n- **Survival**: Moves are chosen to prevent boxing in—e.g., after turn 62, moving Down to (1,5) is safe and opens paths. The snake should avoid the right side where obstacles and body segments create risks.\n- **Life Spans**: \n  - (5,3) expires after turn 61 (missed but unavoidable).\n  - (5,2) expires after turn 64; reachable with careful pathing.\n  - No negative food present.\n- **Key Principle**: Long-term survival over immediate rewards—missing (5,3) is acceptable to avoid death and secure other points. The sequence above sets up for stability and further food collection.",

Let me confirm: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6; y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. So grid is 6x6, but positions given include (3,6), which is y=6, so y from 1 to 6, x from 1 to 6. (3,6) is given, and y=6 is not a wall? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable, similarly x=1 to x=6. So grid is 6x6 cells.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). So the snake is 12 segments long.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,3) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,2) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nCurrent turn is 59.\n\nI need to plan actions for turns 59, 60, 61, etc., but the answer should be for multiple turns ahead, at least 5, to think long-term.\n\nThe core rules say to think 5+ turns ahead, so I should plan a sequence of moves.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\nWalls: borders at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so we can't go there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (3,6)\n\nBody: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n\n- (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nNow food:\n\n- (5,3) - life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 59+3-1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 59, life span is 3, meaning it has 3 turns left including this one. After 3 turns, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) life span 6, so 6 turns left.\n\n(2,5) life span 9, 9 turns left.\n\nHead direction is L, so from (3,6), moving left would be to (2,6) or (3,5)? Directions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n\nSo L is (x-1,y), so from (3,6), left to (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) might be empty or not.\n\nFirst, possible moves from current position (3,6) with direction L.\n\nSince direction is L, I can move L, U, or D, but not R (opposite direction, instant reverse not allowed).\n\nSo possible actions: L (left), U (up), D (down). Not R.\n\nNow, check each:\n\n- L: to (2,6)\n\n- U: to (3,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\ny=7 is wall, so (3,7) is out of bounds, wall collision.\n\nSimilarly, D: to (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is y=5, which is within 1-6.\n\nNow, is (2,6) valid? x=2,y=6, within bounds? x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, so (2,6) should be playable, but let's check if it's occupied or obstacle.\n\nFirst, walls: (2,6) x=2, y=6, not a border wall since borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,6) is inside.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,6) not in this list.\n\nSnake positions: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), etc., (2,6) not in snake positions. Snake is at (3,6), (4,6), but not (2,6), so (2,6) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5): not in obstacles, not in snake? Snake has (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), etc., (3,5) not listed, so free.\n\n(3,6) is head, moving to (3,5) would be down? D is (x,y-1), from (3,6) to (3,5) is down, y decreases.\n\ny=6 to y=5, so down.\n\nU to (3,7) invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (2,6) or D to (3,5).\n\nNow, need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food: (5,3), (5,2), (2,5)\n\n(5,3) has life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 61? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 59: life span 3, so after turn 59, it decreases to 2, then turn 60 to 1, turn 61 to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 59,60,61.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) life span 6, disappears after turn 64? Turn 59:6, 60:5, 61:4, 62:3, 63:2, 64:1, 65:0 gone. So eaten on 59 to 64.\n\n(2,5) life span 9, lasts longer.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,6), food at (5,3), (5,2), (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is close to head.\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5.\n\nHead at (3,6), so to go to (2,5), it's adjacent? (3,6) to (2,5) is not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are (2,6), (4,6), (3,5), (3,7) but (3,7) invalid.\n\n(2,5) is one step diagonally, but we move orthogonally, so to reach (2,5), need to go to (2,6) or (3,5) first, then to (2,5) or something.\n\nNow, I need to maximize score, so eat food, but avoid risks.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and collides.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (4,2), I think. Snake positions: head (3,6), then body, tail is last: (4,2).\n\nList: indices: 0: (3,6) head, 1: (4,6), 2: (4,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (5,4), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,3), 7: (3,3), 8: (2,3), 9: (2,2), 10: (3,2), 11: (4,2) tail.\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nFood is at (5,3), (5,2), (2,5). None of these are on the tail or body currently? Let's see.\n\n(5,3): is it occupied? Snake has (5,4), (5,5), but not (5,3). (5,3) is free, I think.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) not in snake, (2,5) not in snake.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which might be under the body? Snake has positions, let's list all: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\n(5,3) is not in this list, so it's not under snake. Similarly, (5,2) and (2,5) are free.\n\nBut (5,3) is close to (5,4) and (4,4), etc.\n\nNow, for (5,3), life span 3, so it will disappear soon. If I want to eat it, I need to go there quickly.\n\nFrom (3,6), to reach (5,3), it's several moves away.\n\nDistance: from (3,6) to (5,3), delta x=2, delta y=-3, so at least 5 moves? But with obstacles.\n\nFirst, possible moves now: to (2,6) or (3,5).\n\nIf I go to (2,6), then from there, I can go to (2,5) or (1,6) or (2,7) invalid, or (3,6) but that's body, occupied.\n\nFrom (2,6): possible moves: L to (1,6), D to (2,5), U to (2,7) invalid, R to (3,6) occupied by body.\n\n(3,6) is current head, but when I move to (2,6), the snake moves, so body segments shift.\n\nI need to think about the snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so tail moves away.\n\nFor example, if I move to (2,6) from (3,6), then new head at (2,6), body: segment 1 (was (4,6)) moves to (3,6), segment 2 (was (4,5)) moves to (4,6), and so on, tail at (4,2) moves to (3,2) or something.\n\nLet's simulate one move.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) ]\n\nIf I move L to (2,6):\n\nNew head: (2,6)\n\nThen body: segment 1 moves to old head (3,6)\n\nSegment 2 moves to old segment 1 (4,6)\n\nSegment 3 moves to old segment 2 (4,5)\n\n...\n\nUp to segment 11 moves to old segment 10 (3,2)\n\nTail: segment 11 was (4,2), but when head moves, the new position for segment 1 is old head, so positions shift down.\n\nNew positions: head at (2,6)\n\nThen body[0] at old head (3,6)  // since segment 1 was at (4,6), now at (3,6)\n\nLet's index properly.\n\nLet the positions be a list: index 0: head, 1: next, ..., 11: tail.\n\nWhen move to new head position, the new body is: index 0 (new head), then index 1 at old index 0, index 2 at old index 1, ..., index 11 at old index 10.\n\nOld tail (index 11) is left, so snake shortens if no food eaten, but since no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nWhen moving, if no food eaten, the tail cell is vacated, and new head position, with body shifted.\n\nSo for move to (2,6):\n\nNew head: (2,6)\n\nNew segment 1: old head (3,6)\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1 (4,6)\n\nNew segment 3: old segment 2 (4,5)\n\nNew segment 4: old segment 3 (5,5)\n\nNew segment 5: old segment 4 (5,4)\n\nNew segment 6: old segment 5 (4,4)\n\nNew segment 7: old segment 6 (4,3)\n\nNew segment 8: old segment 7 (3,3)\n\nNew segment 9: old segment 8 (2,3)\n\nNew segment 10: old segment 9 (2,2)\n\nNew segment 11: old segment 10 (3,2)  // tail\n\nOld segment 11 (4,2) is vacated.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (3,5):\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nNew segment 1: old head (3,6)\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1 (4,6)\n\nNew segment 3: old segment 2 (4,5)\n\nAnd so on, down to new segment 11: old segment 10 (3,2)\n\nOld segment 11 (4,2) vacated.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nIf I go to (2,6), then I can go to (2,5) next, since (2,5) has food with long life, but life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\n(2,5) is food position.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can move D to (2,5), which is food, so eat it.\n\nThen snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nFirst, from current, if I go L to (2,6), then to (2,5) to eat food.\n\nBut (2,5) is food, value 1, positive.\n\nNow, when I move to (2,5), head at (2,5), which was free, so I can eat it.\n\nThen after eating, snake grows, so the tail stays, and new head at (2,5), body: segment 1 at old head (2,6) or something.\n\nIn the move sequence.\n\nAt turn 59, head at (3,6), move to (2,6) - no food, so positions: head (2,6), body: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), ..., up to (3,2) as above, tail at (3,2).\n\nThen turn 60, from (2,6), I can move to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is food, so when I move to (2,5), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (2,5), and the tail does not move, so body includes the old tail position.\n\nAfter move to (2,5), new head at (2,5), then new segment 1 at old head (2,6), new segment 2 at old segment 1 (3,6), and so on, up to new segment 12 at old segment 11 (3,2), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position of the old tail? No.\n\nWhen food is eaten, the snake grows, so the tail remains, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since the tail didn't move, it's like the tail stays.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, so length increases by one, and the tail does not move that turn. So the new position has head at food cell, and the body is the old head and all segments except the tail stays or something.\n\nLet's think.\n\nBefore move: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., P11 (tail)\n\nMove to new cell C.\n\nIf C has food, then new positions: C (new head), P0 (new segment 1), P1 (new segment 2), ..., P10 (new segment 11), and P11 (new segment 12, tail) but P11 is the old tail position, so it stays, meaning the snake grows by keeping the tail in place.\n\nNew snake: [C, P0, P1, P2, ..., P10, P11]  so length 13 now.\n\nIf no food, new positions: [C, P0, P1, ..., P10]  length 12, tail was P11, vacated.\n\nIn this case, at turn 59 move to (2,6), no food, so new snake: head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)  and old tail (4,2) vacated, so 11 segments? No.\n\nOld positions: 12 segments, after move no food, new has 11 segments: indices 0 to 10 for body, but head is new, so positions: new head, then old head, old seg1, ..., old seg10, so 11 segments.\n\nOld seg11 (tail) is gone.\n\nSimilarly, with food, new head, old head, old seg1 to old seg10, and old tail stays, so 12 segments? Let's count.\n\nOld: 12 positions.\n\nAfter move no food: 11 positions (head + 10 body segments)\n\nAfter move with food: 13 positions (head + 12 body segments: old head to old tail)\n\nYes.\n\nIn this case, from (3,6) to (2,6), no food, so snake now: head (2,6), body: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)  that's 12 positions? Head and 11 body? List: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) — 12 segments, but since no food eaten, it should be shorter.\n\nI think I miscounted the indices.\n\nInitial: 12 segments, indices 0 to 11.\n\nAfter move to new head C, if no food, new positions: C (head), old[0], old[1], ..., old[10] — that's 11 positions.\n\nOld[11] is vacated.\n\nIf food, new positions: C (head), old[0], old[1], ..., old[11] — 12 positions, length increased.\n\nInitial length 12, after no food, length 11; after food, length 13.\n\nIn this case, at turn 59, move to (2,6), no food there, so new snake: positions from (2,6) as head, then old head (3,6), then old[1] (4,6), old[2] (4,5), old[3] (5,5), old[4] (5,4), old[5] (4,4), old[6] (4,3), old[7] (3,3), old[8] (2,3), old[9] (2,2), old[10] (3,2) — that's 11 positions. old[11] (4,2) is gone.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (3,5), new head (3,5), then (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) — 11 positions, missing (4,2) and (4,2) vacated.\n\nNow back to plan.\n\nIf I go to (2,6) at turn 59, then at turn 60, from (2,6), I can move to (2,5) to eat the food at (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is food, so move to (2,5), eat it, so new head at (2,5), and snake grows: positions: head (2,5), then old head (2,6), then the previous body: since after turn 59, the snake is at (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) for 11 segments.\n\nAfter move to (2,5) with food eaten: new head (2,5), then old head (2,6), then old body[1] (3,6), old body[2] (4,6), ..., up to old body[10] (3,2), and since food eaten, the old tail position is added, but old tail was (3,2), so new segment at (3,2)? No.\n\nAfter turn 59, the positions are: let's call S59: [ (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) ]  head at (2,6), tail at (3,2).\n\nWhen moving to new cell, if food, new positions: new head, then S59[0], S59[1], S59[2], ..., S59[10], S59[11] — all 12 positions, so length 12.\n\nS59 has 12 positions? S59: index 0: (2,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (5,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,2), 11: (3,2) — yes, 12 positions, but after no food at turn 59, it should be 11? I think I have confusion.\n\nInitial at turn 59: before move, 12 positions.\n\nAfter move to (2,6) at turn 59, no food at (2,6), so new snake has 11 positions: head at (2,6), then body at old head (3,6), old seg1 (4,6), old seg2 (4,5), ..., up to old seg10 (3,2). Old seg11 (4,2) is gone.\n\nSo positions: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — that's 11 positions. (3,2) is included as old seg10? Old indices: old head (3,6) is now body[0], old seg1 (4,6) body[1], old seg2 (4,5) body[2], old seg3 (5,5) body[3], old seg4 (5,4) body[4], old seg5 (4,4) body[5], old seg6 (4,3) body[6], old seg7 (3,3) body[7], old seg8 (2,3) body[8], old seg9 (2,2) body[9], old seg10 (3,2) body[10]. So body has 11 segments, from index 0 to 10, with body[10] at (3,2) as tail.\n\nSo at turn 60, head at (2,6), tail at (3,2).\n\nMove to (2,5): (2,5) is food, so eat it, new head at (2,5), then body: old head (2,6), old body[0] (3,6), old body[1] (4,6), ..., old body[9] (2,2), and old body[10] (3,2), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position of the old tail, but the old tail is included, so new positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) — that's 12 positions, with tail at (3,2).\n\nLength increased to 12.\n\nSimilarly, if no food, it would be shorter.\n\nBut in this case, eating (2,5) is good.\n\nBut is it safe to go to (2,6) and then (2,5)?\n\nFirst, from (3,6) to (2,6): (2,6) is free, not wall, not obstacle, not snake body.\n\nThen from (2,6) to (2,5): (2,5) is food, not occupied by body at that time.\n\nAfter moving to (2,6), the body is at (3,6), (4,6), etc., not at (2,5), so (2,5) is free, so can move there.\n\nBut let's check the tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, when I move to (2,5), the tail is at (3,2), which is not adjacent to (2,5). (2,5) and (3,2) are not adjacent; (2,5) to (3,2) is not orthogonally adjacent, so no danger.\n\nSo eating (2,5) should be safe.\n\nBut (2,5) has life span 9, so it can be eaten later, but since it's close, I can eat it now.\n\nThere is food at (5,3) with short life span, only 3 turns left, so if I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\nFrom (3,6), if I go to (2,6), I'm going away from (5,3).\n\nIf I go to (3,5), down, to (3,5), which is closer to (5,3).\n\n(3,5) to (5,3) is not direct, but let's see.\n\nAlso, (5,2) is below.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid with obstacles and snake.\n\nGrid cells:\n\nRow y=6: x=1,2,3,4,5,6\n\nBut walls at borders, so cells (1,6) to (6,6)\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo (6,4) blocked, (5,1) blocked, (2,4) blocked, (6,1) blocked, (1,2) blocked.\n\nSnake at turn 59: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nSo occupied: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,6), (2,6), (3,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,4), (4,4) occupied, (5,3), (6,3), (1,4), etc.\n\nFood at (5,3), (5,2), (2,5)\n\n(2,5) is free, as above.\n\n(5,3) is free, (5,2) is free.\n\nNow, (5,3) has life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 61.\n\nTurn 59,60,61 it can be eaten, after that gone.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) at turn 59, from (3,6) down to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is free, not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,4) or (4,5) or (2,5) or (3,6) but (3,6) may be body.\n\nAfter move to (3,5), new snake: head (3,5), then old head (3,6), then old seg1 (4,6), old seg2 (4,5), old seg3 (5,5), old seg4 (5,4), old seg5 (4,4), old seg6 (4,3), old seg7 (3,3), old seg8 (2,3), old seg9 (2,2), old seg10 (3,2) — 11 positions, tail at (3,2).\n\nNow at (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6) but that's now body, occupied; D to (3,4); L to (2,5); R to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\n(4,5) is old seg2, which is now body position, so occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is body.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible: D to (3,4) or L to (2,5).\n\n(3,4) is free? Snake has (4,4) occupied, but (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nObstacles not at (3,4), so free.\n\n(2,5) free.\n\nSo can go to (3,4) or (2,5).\n\nIf I go to (2,5), I eat the food there, similar to before.\n\nBut I want to reach (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go to (3,4), then from (3,4), I can go to (4,4) or (3,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, (4,4) is body, (3,3) is body.\n\nAfter move to (3,4), let's see.\n\nFirst, at turn 59 move to (3,5): snake now (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — tail at (2,2)? Positions: head (3,5), body[0] (3,6), body[1] (4,6), body[2] (4,5), body[3] (5,5), body[4] (5,4), body[5] (4,4), body[6] (4,3), body[7] (3,3), body[8] (2,3), body[9] (2,2) — 10 positions? Initial 12, move no food, 11 positions. Head (3,5), then 10 body segments: old head (3,6), old seg1 (4,6), old seg2 (4,5), old seg3 (5,5), old seg4 (5,4), old seg5 (4,4), old seg6 (4,3), old seg7 (3,3), old seg8 (2,3), old seg9 (2,2) — so body from index 0 to 9, tail at (2,2).\n\nOld seg10 (3,2) and old seg11 (4,2) gone, but old seg10 was (3,2), not in new.\n\nNew tail at (2,2).\n\nThen at turn 60, from (3,5), move to (3,4): (3,4) is free? Not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nThen move to (3,4), no food there, so new head (3,4), body: old head (3,5), old body[0] (3,6), old body[1] (4,6), old body[2] (4,5), old body[3] (5,5), old body[4] (5,4), old body[5] (4,4), old body[6] (4,3), old body[7] (3,3), old body[8] (2,3) — 9 positions? After move to (3,4) no food, new snake: head (3,4), then (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — that's 10 positions? Head and 9 body? List: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — 11 positions, but should be decreasing.\n\nInitial turn 59: 12 positions.\n\nAfter move to (3,5) no food: 11 positions.\n\nAfter move to (3,4) no food: 10 positions.\n\nHead (3,4), then old head (3,5), old body[0] (3,6), old body[1] (4,6), old body[2] (4,5), old body[3] (5,5), old body[4] (5,4), old body[5] (4,4), old body[6] (4,3), old body[7] (3,3), old body[8] (2,3) — so 9 body segments, plus head, 10 positions. Tail at (2,3).\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (4,4) but (4,4) is occupied, or (3,3) occupied, or (2,4) obstacle, or (3,5) occupied, so only possible move? (3,4) to U (3,5) occupied, D (3,3) occupied, L (2,4) obstacle, R (4,4) occupied. All directions blocked? That's a problem.\n\n(3,4) has no free adjacent cells? Adjacent cells: (3,5) is body, (3,3) is body, (2,4) is obstacle, (4,4) is body. So all occupied or blocked, so if I go to (3,4), I die next turn because no move possible.\n\nThat's bad.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go to (3,4), it's a dead end.\n\nSo I should not go to (3,5) at turn 59, because then from (3,5), I can go to (2,5) instead, to eat food.\n\nBut from (3,5), I can go to (2,5) directly.\n\n(2,5) is food, so at turn 60, from (3,5) move to (2,5), eat food, so snake grows.\n\nBut let's see the path to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3.\n\nFrom current (3,6), to reach (5,3), I need to go right and down.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (3,6), if I go down to (3,5), then from (3,5), if I go left to (2,5) to eat food, but that's away from (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can only go to (2,5) or (3,4), but (3,4) is dead end, so only (2,5) is possible.\n\nAfter eating (2,5), I am at (2,5), and snake longer, but I need to go to (5,3).\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go to (2,6) or (1,5) or (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so (2,6) or (1,5).\n\nBut (5,3) is far, and time is short for (5,3).\n\nLife span of (5,3) is 3, so only until turn 61.\n\nTurn 59,60,61.\n\nAt turn 59, I need to start moving towards it.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) at turn 59, then at turn 60, I go to (2,5) to eat, so at turn 60, I am at (2,5), then turn 61, from (2,5), I can go to (2,6) or (1,5), both away from (5,3), so I can't reach (5,3) by turn 61, since from (2,5) to (5,3) is at least 5 moves: e.g. to (3,5), but (3,5) may be occupied, it's messy.\n\nDistance: (2,5) to (5,3) delta x=3, delta y=-2, min 5 moves, but with obstacles, likely more.\n\nFor example, to go to (3,5), but after eating at (2,5), the snake is long, and positions occupied.\n\nAt turn 60 after eating (2,5), head at (2,5), body includes (3,5) or something.\n\nLet's not simulate all, but it's clear that from (2,5), it takes multiple turns to reach (5,3), so I won't make it by turn 61.\n\nTherefore, if I want to eat (5,3), I need to go directly towards it from turn 59.\n\nFrom (3,6), going to (3,5) is down, then from there, I can only go to (2,5), not towards (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,6), the other choice is to go left to (2,6), then from (2,6), I can go down to (2,5) to eat, or to (1,6), but again away.\n\nNeither gets me closer to (5,3).\n\nHow to reach (5,3) from (3,6)?\n\nPossible path: from (3,6) to (4,6)? But (4,6) is body, occupied, can't go right.\n\nOr to (3,5), then to (4,5)? (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nAt turn 59, from (3,6), I can only go to (2,6) or (3,5).\n\nBoth are not directly towards (5,3).\n\nBut after moving, the body moves, so some cells free up.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,6) at turn 59, then at turn 60, from (2,6), I can go to (2,5) or (1,6) or (3,6) but (3,6) is body.\n\nIf I go to (2,5), I eat food there, but then I'm at (2,5) turn 60.\n\nThen turn 61, from (2,5), to (2,6) or (1,5), etc.\n\n(5,3) is still far.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5) yet, from (2,6), I can go to (1,6), for example.\n\nBut (1,6) is free, I think.\n\nThen from (1,6), I can go down to (1,5), etc., but not towards (5,3).\n\nTo reach (5,3), I need to go right, but the right side is blocked by the snake body.\n\nFor example, after turn 59, if I go to (3,5), then at turn 60, from (3,5), I can only go to (2,5), as (3,4) is dead end.\n\nAfter going to (3,5), the cell (4,5) is still occupied by body, but at turn 60, when I move from (3,5), if I could go to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nAfter move to (3,5), the new positions are (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), etc., so (4,5) is still occupied by body[2] or something.\n\nSpecifically, after turn 59 move to (3,5): snake at (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — so (4,5) is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) occupied, etc.\n\nSo no way to go right from (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, from (2,6), after move, (3,6) is occupied, so can't go right.\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach (5,3) in time for turn 61, because I can't get past the snake body quickly.\n\n(5,3) might be eaten only if I can find a path, but with the snake blocking, it's tight.\n\nLet's see what cells are near (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3)\n\n(5,4) is snake body, occupied.\n\n(5,2) is food, but not adjacent yet.\n\n(4,3) is snake body, occupied.\n\n(6,3) is free, but (6,4) is obstacle, so (6,3) might be accessible.\n\nBut from current position, I can't reach (5,3) directly.\n\nPerhaps (5,3) is under the body or something? But earlier, snake positions do not include (5,3), so it's free.\n\nBut to eat it, head must move to it.\n\nThe only way might be to move in a way that the body moves away.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (3,5), then to (2,5), but that doesn't free up the area near (5,3).\n\nThe body near (5,3) is at (5,4), (4,4), etc.\n\nAs the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells free up.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (4,2), so if I move away, the tail might move, freeing cells.\n\nBut to reach (5,3) by turn 61, I need to be at (5,3) on turn 59,60, or 61.\n\nTurn 59: at (3,6), not possible.\n\nTurn 60: from turn 59 position, I can be at (2,6) or (3,5), neither is (5,3).\n\nTurn 61: from turn 60 position.\n\nIf at turn 59 I go to (2,6), then turn 60 I go to (2,5), then at turn 60 I am at (2,5), turn 61 from (2,5) to say (2,6) or (1,5), not (5,3).\n\nIf at turn 59 I go to (3,5), turn 60 go to (2,5), same thing.\n\nOr if at turn 59 go to (3,5), turn 60 go to (3,4), but (3,4) is dead end, so I die.\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,3) in time; it will disappear before I can eat it.\n\nTherefore, I should not worry about (5,3) and focus on other food.\n\n(5,2) has life span 6, so more time, and (2,5) has 9.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,5), I can go to (5,2) later.\n\nBut let's think long-term survival.\n\nFirst, at turn 59, from (3,6), options:\n\n- Move L to (2,6)\n\n- Move D to (3,5)\n\nBut moving to (3,5) leads to a dead end if I go to (3,4), or I can go to (2,5) to eat.\n\nIf I go to (2,6), I can go to (2,5) to eat.\n\nSo both choices, I can eat (2,5) at turn 60.\n\nBut if I go to (3,5) at turn 59, then at turn 60 to (2,5), I eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,6) at turn 59, then to (2,5) at turn 60.\n\nNow, after eating (2,5), the snake is at (2,5), and longer.\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,2) which is below.\n\nBut let's see the grid after eating (2,5).\n\nFirst, let's choose one path.\n\nSuppose at turn 59, I move L to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 59: move L to (2,6), no food, snake: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) — tail at (3,2)? Earlier: after move to (2,6), positions: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — and (3,2) is not included, old positions.\n\nOld seg10 (3,2) is gone, so snake: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — 11 positions, tail at (2,2).\n\nThen turn 60, move to (2,5): (2,5) is food, so eat, new head (2,5), then body: old head (2,6), old body[0] (3,6), old body[1] (4,6), old body[2] (4,5), old body[3] (5,5), old body[4] (5,4), old body[5] (4,4), old body[6] (4,3), old body[7] (3,3), old body[8] (2,3), old body[9] (2,2), and since food eaten, new segment at old tail position, so new positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — 12 positions, tail at (2,2).\n\nNow head at (2,5), direction from (2,6) to (2,5) is down, so head direction D.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5): U to (2,6) but (2,6) is body, occupied; D to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle; L to (1,5); R to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is free? Not occupied, not obstacle, so free.\n\n(1,5) free.\n\nSo can go L to (1,5) or R to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) might be better to go towards center.\n\nIf I go to (3,5), then from there, etc.\n\nBut there is food at (5,2) I can target.\n\nSince (5,3) will disappear, ignore it.\n\n(5,2) has life span 6, so I have time.\n\nAnother food at (2,5) is eaten.\n\nNow, to plan long-term, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so from (2,5), I cannot go down.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) obstacle.\n\nNow, let's list free areas.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (5,2) next.\n\nFrom (2,5), if I go to (3,5), then to (3,4) but (3,4) might be free later.\n\nAfter eating at (2,5), the snake is long, and (3,4) is free, for example.\n\nAt turn 60, after eating, positions include (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\nFree cells: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) obstacle, (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) obstacle, (6,1) obstacle, (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) obstacle, (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) occupied, etc.\n\n(3,5) is free, (3,4) is free, (4,3) occupied, etc.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go to (3,5) or (1,5).\n\nIf I go to (3,5), then head at (3,5), direction from (2,5) to (3,5) is right.\n\nThen from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6) occupied, D to (3,4), L to (2,5) occupied, R to (4,5) occupied.\n\nOnly D to (3,4) is possible.\n\nThen move to (3,4), no food, so snake shortens, new head (3,4), body: old head (3,5), old body[0] (2,6), etc., but positions shift.\n\nAfter move to (3,4), no food, new snake: head (3,4), then (3,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — tail at (2,3)? Let's not detail.\n\nThen from (3,4), as before, all adjacent occupied or blocked, so I die.\n\nTherefore, going to (3,5) from (2,5) leads to death.\n\nInstead, from (2,5), I should go to (1,5).\n\nMove L to (1,5).\n\nThen at (1,5), no food, so snake shortens.\n\nNew head (1,5), body: old head (2,5), old body[0] (2,6), old body[1] (3,6), ..., up to old body[10] (2,2), but since no food, shorter snake.\n\nPositions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) — 11 positions, for example.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can go to (1,6) or (1,4) or (2,5) occupied.\n\n(1,6) free, (1,4) free.\n\nThen I can explore the left side.\n\nBut there is food at (5,2) on the right.\n\nTo reach (5,2), I need to go down and right.\n\nBut the snake body is blocking the center.\n\nPerhaps after some moves, the tail moves, freeing space.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (2,2), so as I move, it may free up.\n\nBut let's think about the initial choice at turn 59.\n\nIf at turn 59 I go D to (3,5), then at turn 60 I can go to (2,5) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 60, head at (2,5), same as above.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,5) to avoid death.\n\nSo similar.\n\nBut to maximize score, I can eat (2,5) and then (5,2).\n\n(5,2) has life span 6, so I have turns to reach it.\n\nFirst, at turn 59, I should choose to go to (2,6) or (3,5).\n\nIf I go to (2,6), then to (2,5) to eat, I am at (2,5) at turn 60.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) at turn 59, then to (2,5) at turn 60, also at (2,5) at turn 60.\n\nSo same position at turn 60.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to (1,5) to survive.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can go to (1,6) or (1,4).\n\nSay go to (1,6), then from (1,6), to (1,5) occupied or (1,7) invalid or (2,6) occupied or (0,6) wall, so only down to (1,5) but occupied, or left invalid, so stuck? (1,6) adjacent: U (1,7) wall, D (1,5), L (0,6) wall, R (2,6) occupied.\n\nSo only D to (1,5), but (1,5) is body, occupied, so no move, death.\n\nIf from (1,5) I go to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is free.\n\nMove to (1,4), no food, shorten.\n\nThen from (1,4), can go to (1,3) or (1,5) occupied or (2,4) obstacle or (0,4) wall, so to (1,3).\n\nThen to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, so only to (1,3), then to (1,2) invalid, or (1,4) occupied, so dead end.\n\nThe left side is dangerous with obstacles.\n\nPerhaps from (2,5), after eating, I should not go to (1,5), but since (3,5) is occupied, only (1,5) is available.\n\nIn both cases, at turn 60, after eating (2,5), head at (2,5), only moves to (1,5) or (3,5), but (3,5) leads to death, so only (1,5).\n\nThen from (1,5), only to (1,4) or (1,6), but (1,6) may be free.\n\nAt turn 60, after eating (2,5), positions: head (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\nSo (1,6) is free, (1,5) is free.\n\nFrom (2,5), move to (1,5).\n\nThen new head (1,5), no food, so new snake: head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — tail at (2,3).\n\nOld tail (2,2) vacated.\n\nThen from (1,5), can move to (1,6) or (1,4).\n\nIf move to (1,6), then (1,6) is free, no food, new head (1,6), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) — tail at (3,3).\n\nThen from (1,6), can move to (1,5) occupied or (1,7) invalid or (2,6) occupied or (0,6) wall, all blocked, death.\n\nIf from (1,5) move to (1,4), then new head (1,4), no food, body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) — tail at (3,3).\n\nThen from (1,4), can move to (1,3) or (1,5) occupied or (2,4) obstacle or (0,4) wall.\n\nSo to (1,3).\n\nThen to (1,2) obstacle, dead.\n\nSo both ways lead to death soon.\n\nTherefore, eating (2,5) at turn 60 is bad because it traps me in the corner.\n\nBut at turn 59, I have to choose, and if I don't eat (2,5), I might avoid that.\n\nAt turn 59, from (3,6), instead of going to (2,6) or (3,5), I have to choose one.\n\nIf I go to (3,5), then at turn 60, I can go to (2,5) or (3,4).\n\nIf I go to (3,4), I die immediately as all blocked.\n\nIf I go to (2,5), I eat, then as above, trapped.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,6) at turn 59, then at turn 60, I can go to (2,5) or (1,6) or (3,6) occupied.\n\nIf I go to (1,6), then no eat, so new head (1,6), body (2,6), (3,6), etc., tail at (2,2) or something.\n\nThen from (1,6), I can go to (1,5) or (1,7) invalid, etc.\n\n(1,5) free, so move to (1,5), no food.\n\nThen from (1,5), to (1,4) or (1,6) occupied, etc.\n\nThen to (1,4), then to (1,3), then stuck.\n\nSame issue.\n\nOr from (1,6), if I go to (1,5), same.\n\nSo it seems the snake is in a position where moving left or down leads to danger.\n\nBut there might be a way to go down and then right later.\n\nFor example, at turn 59, go D to (3,5).\n\nThen at turn 60, instead of going to (2,5), I have to, because (3,4) is dead end.\n\nFrom (3,5), only (2,5) is available, since (3,4) is not free at that time.\n\nAfter move to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\n(2,5) is free, (3,4) is free? Not occupied, so yes.\n\n(3,4) is free, so I can go to (3,4) or (2,5).\n\nIf I go to (3,4), then as before, from (3,4), all adjacent are occupied or blocked: (3,5) body, (3,3) body, (2,4) obstacle, (4,4) body, so no move, death.\n\nSo I must go to (2,5) to eat, but then trapped.\n\nSo perhaps the only way is to not eat (2,5) and go to (1,6) from (2,6), but still trapped.\n\nLet's list all possible moves.\n\nAt turn 59, from (3,6), move L to (2,6).\n\nThen at turn 60, from (2,6), moves: to (2,5), (1,6), or (3,6) occupied.\n\n(2,5) food, (1,6) free.\n\nIf I go to (1,6), no food, so new head (1,6), body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — tail at (2,3).\n\nThen at turn 61, from (1,6), can move to (1,5) (free), or other blocked.\n\nMove to (1,5), no food, new head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) — tail at (3,3).\n\nThen at turn 62, from (1,5), can move to (1,4) or (1,6) occupied.\n\nMove to (1,4), no food, new head (1,4), body (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3) — tail at (4,3).\n\nThen at turn 63, from (1,4), move to (1,3) (since (1,5) occupied, (2,4) obstacle), so to (1,3), no food, new head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) — tail at (4,4).\n\nThen at turn 64, from (1,3), can move to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, or (1,4) occupied, or (2,3) which is free? (2,3) is not in current body, so free.\n\n(2,3) is not in positions, so free.\n\nMove to (2,3), no food, new head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — tail at (5,4).\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (2,4) obstacle, or (2,2) free, or (1,3) occupied, or (3,3) free.\n\n(3,3) is free, (2,2) free.\n\nSay go to (3,3), then and so on.\n\nBut this way, I avoid death but don't eat food, and the food at (5,2) is still there.\n\nBut I can circle back.\n\nBut it's slow.\n\nSince (5,2) has life span 6, I can reach it.\n\nFor example, from the above, at some point, I can go to (3,3), then to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut let's focus on the immediate action.\n\nPerhaps at turn 59, I should go to (3,5) and then to (2,5), eat, and then from (2,5) go to (1,5), and then to (1,4), etc., but as above, I can survive by going down to (1,3) and then to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut in that case, I ate (2,5), so score +1.\n\nThen later I can eat (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat, I can eat both.\n\nBut (2,5) has long life, I can eat it later.\n\nAt turn 59, if I go to (2,6), then to (1,6) at turn 60, not eating (2,5), then I can save (2,5) for later.\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), which might be accessible later.\n\nBut with the snake body, it might be blocked.\n\nFor example, if I go to (1,6) at turn 60, then to (1,5) at turn 61, etc., as above, then at some point, I can go to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (4,2), etc., but (4,2) might be free.\n\nLet's not plan too far.\n\nSince the grid is small, and snake is long, space is limited.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (5,2) can be eaten, and it's positive.\n\nFrom current position, if I can go to the right.\n\nBut I can't directly.\n\nPerhaps I should go down to (3,5) at turn 59, then to (2,5) at turn 60 to eat, then from (2,5) go to (1,5), then to (1,4), then to (1,3), then to (2,3), then from (2,3) I can go to (3,3) or (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is free after some moves.\n\nThen from (3,3) to (3,2) or (4,3), etc.\n\nEventually, I can reach (5,2).\n\nFor example, from (2,3) to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (4,2), then to (4,1) but (5,1) obstacle, so to (5,2) if possible.\n\n(5,2) is food.\n\nBut let's estimate turns.\n\nTurn 59: move D to (3,5)\n\nTurn 60: move L to (2,5) eat (2,5)\n\nTurn 61: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 62: move D to (1,4)  // assuming D is down, y-1\n\nFrom (1,5) to (1,4) is down.\n\nTurn 63: move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 64: move R to (2,3)  // to (2,3)\n\nTurn 65: move R to (3,3) or D to (2,2)\n\nAt turn 64, from (1,3) to (2,3)\n\nThen at turn 65, from (2,3) to (3,3) or (2,2) or (2,4) obstacle, or (1,3) occupied.\n\n(3,3) free, (2,2) free.\n\nSay go to (3,3)\n\nThen at turn 66, from (3,3) to (3,2) or (4,3) or (3,4) or (2,3) occupied.\n\n(3,2) free, (4,3) may be occupied, but after many moves, it might be free.\n\nAt this point, the body has moved, so (4,3) might be free.\n\nFor example, at turn 65, positions depend on previous moves.\n\nBut roughly, (5,2) can be reached around turn 66 or later.\n\nLife span of (5,2) is 6 at turn 59, so at turn 59:6, turn 60:5, turn 61:4, turn 62:3, turn 63:2, turn 64:1, turn 65:0 gone. So it can be eaten until turn 64.\n\nTurn 64 is the last turn to eat (5,2).\n\nIn the above plan, at turn 64, I am at (2,3), and (5,2) is at distance, I can't reach by turn 64.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (5,2) is at least 4 moves, but at turn 64, I need to be at (5,2) on turn 64, but I am at (2,3), so not possible.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5), I might reach (5,2) faster.\n\nFor example, at turn 59, go D to (3,5)\n\nThen at turn 60, go to (2,5) but not eat, but I have to move to a cell, and (2,5) is food, so if I move there, I eat it.\n\nI can choose not to move to food.\n\nBut if I move to (2,5), I eat it.\n\nIf I go to (3,4), I die.\n\nSo no choice, I must eat (2,5) or die.\n\nSimilarly with the other choice.\n\nSo the only way is to eat (2,5) at turn 60, and then (5,2) is too far to eat before it disappears.\n\nLife span of (5,2) is 6 at turn 59, so disappears after turn 64, can be eaten turn 59 to 64.\n\nAt turn 59, head at (3,6), (5,2) is at (5,2), distance |3-5| + |6-2| = 2+4=6, min 6 moves, but with obstacles, more.\n\nFor example, path: (3,6) -> (3,5) -> (3,4) but (3,4) may be available later, but at turn 59, (3,4) is free, but from (3,5) to (3,4) is possible only if I go to (3,5) first.\n\nAt turn 59, go to (3,5), then at turn 60, I can go to (3,4), but from (3,4) I die, so not useful.\n\nGo to (2,6) then to (1,6), then to (1,5), etc., not towards (5,2).\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat (5,2) in time.\n\nTherefore, I should focus on surviving and eating (2,5) for score.\n\nThen after that, I can try to survive as long as possible.\n\nBut there might be other food later, but currently only three food, and two will disappear.\n\n(2,5) has life span 9, so it can be eaten later, but if I don't eat it now, I might not have the chance.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,6) at turn 59, then to (1,6) at turn 60, not eating (2,5), then (2,5) is still there, and I can eat it later when I come back.\n\nBut with the snake body, it might be blocked.\n\nFor instance, after going to (1,6), (1,5), etc., the cell (2,5) might be free or not.\n\nBut it's risky.\n\nSince eating (2,5) gives score and I can survive for a while, I should eat it.\n\nThen after that, I need to find a way out of the corner.\n\nFrom the earlier sequence, after eating (2,5) at turn 60, go to (1,5) at turn 61, then to (1,4) at turn 62, then to (1,3) at turn 63, then to (2,3) at turn 64.\n\nAt (2,3), I can go to (3,3) at turn 65, then to (3,2) at turn 66, then to (4,2) at turn 67, etc.\n\nBut the grid has obstacles, and I might find food later, but currently no other food.\n\nFood can spawn, but in this state, only these three.\n\nSo to maximize score, eating (2,5) is the only one I can eat, as (5,3) and (5,2) will disappear before I can reach them.\n\nSo I should eat (2,5) for +1 score.\n\nThen survive.\n\nFor the move at turn 59, whether I go to (2,6) or (3,5), I end up eating (2,5) at turn 60.\n\nThe difference is the head direction and position.\n\nIf I go to (2,6) at turn 59, then to (2,5) at turn 60, head moving down.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) at turn 59, then to (2,5) at turn 60, head moving left.\n\nBut after that, the situation is similar.\n\nPerhaps going to (2,6) first is slightly better because from (2,6) to (2,5) is down, and from (2,5) to (1,5) is left.\n\nBut not significant.\n\nSince the core rules say to prioritize long-term survival, and thinking 5+ turns ahead, I need to choose the move that gives more space.\n\nFrom (3,6), going to (2,6) might be better because (2,6) is on the edge, but going to (3,5) is more central but leads to dead end.\n\nBut after eating (2,5), I have to go left.\n\nSo let's choose to go L to (2,6) at turn 59.\n\nThen the action sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=59.\n\nSo for turn 59: action\n\nTurn 60: action\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but the state may change, so I can plan a sequence.\n\nBut food life span decreases, so I need to consider.\n\nFor now, at turn 59, move L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 60, move D to (2,5) to eat\n\nThen turn 61, from (2,5) move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 62, from (1,5) move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 63, from (1,4) move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 64, from (1,3) move R to (2,3)\n\nEtc.\n\nBut at turn 64, (5,2) is gone, so no issue.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I think I need to provide a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince the grid is small, and to avoid risks, perhaps this is the way.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (5,3) might be reachable if I move differently, but I think not.\n\nPerhaps from (3,6), go D to (3,5), then at turn 60, go to (2,5) eat, same as above.\n\nI think it's similar.\n\nSo I'll go with move L at turn 59.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn 59: L\n\nTurn 60: D (to (2,5) eat)\n\nTurn 61: L (to (1,5))\n\nTurn 62: D (to (1,4))\n\nTurn 63: D (to (1,3))\n\nTurn 64: R (to (2,3))\n\nBut at turn 64, from (1,3) to (2,3), R is right, x+1.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (3,3) or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list up to turn 63 or 64.\n\nSince t1=59, list to turn 64 or 65.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, after turn 64, I can go to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (4,2), then to (4,1) if possible, but (4,1) may be free, etc.\n\nBut I think for the response, 5 turns from 59 to 63.\n\nTurn 59,60,61,62,63.\n\nActions: L, D, L, D, D\n\nBut at turn 63, I am at (1,3), and from there to (1,2) is obstacle, so I must go to (2,3) at turn 64, but not in the 5 turns.\n\nFor the sequence, I can list as required.\n\nPerhaps start with D to (3,5) to be closer to the bottom, but similar.\n\nI think L is fine.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n\nFirst action at turn 59: L\n\nThen turn 60: D\n\nThen turn 61: L\n\nBut after turn 60, at (2,5), move to (1,5) is L, since from (2,5) to (1,5) is left, x-1.\n\nThen from (1,5) to (1,4) is down, D.\n\nThen from (1,4) to (1,3) is down, D.\n\nSo for 5 turns:\n\nTurn 59: L\n\nTurn 60: D\n\nTurn 61: L\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: D\n\nThen turn 64: R, etc.\n\nBut to think ahead, after that, I can survive.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State and Plan\n\n**Grid and Constraints:**\n- Playable grid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 (walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7).\n- Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — these cells are blocked.\n- Snake: Head at (3,6) with direction L (left). Snake body segments: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] — length 12.\n- Food:\n  - (5,3): value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 61).\n  - (5,2): value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 64).\n  - (2,5): value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 67).\n\n**Key Observations and Risks:**\n- **Immediate moves from (3,6) with direction L:** \n  - U (to (3,7)): Invalid (wall at y=7).\n  - D (to (3,5)): Valid and safe (cell free).\n  - L (to (2,6)): Valid and safe (cell free).\n  - R (to (4,6)): Invalid (opposite direction not allowed and cell occupied by body).\n- **Food Accessibility:**\n  - (5,3) cannot be reached by turn 61 due to snake body blockage and distance; prioritizing it risks starvation or death.\n  - (5,2) cannot be reached by turn 64 due to distance and obstacles; life span too short to justify risky path.\n  - (2,5) is reachable by turn 60 and has long life span; eating it provides +1 score with minimal risk.\n- **Survival Priority:** The snake is near the top-left corner with limited space. Moving left or down leads to potential traps, but eating (2,5) at (2,5) is feasible and provides a growth buffer. After eating, moving left to (1,5) avoids immediate death and opens a path downward along the left edge for long-term survival.\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead:** \n  - Turn 59: Move to (2,6) or (3,5). Both allow reaching (2,5) by turn 60 for food. Moving L to (2,6) is chosen to start near (2,5) and avoid the central dead end.\n  - Turn 60: Eat (2,5) at (2,5) by moving D. This increases length to 13.\n  - Turn 61: From (2,5), move L to (1,5) to escape corner (only safe move).\n  - Turn 62-63: Move D to (1,4) then D to (1,3) to navigate down the left edge, freeing space as tail moves.\n  - Beyond: After turn 63, move to (2,3) (turn 64), then explore rightward for future food or survival.\n\n**Plan Rationale:**\n- **Score Maximization:** Eating (2,5) at turn 60 yields +1 score. (5,3) and (5,2) are ignored as unreachable before expiration.\n- **Risk Avoidance:** Moving to (3,5) at turn 59 leads to a dead end at (3,4) if not eating (2,5). Eating (2,5) and moving left ensures survival for >10 turns by using the left edge.\n- **Long-Term:** Sequence avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions. After turn 63, the snake can move to (2,3), then (3,3), accessing more open space.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 59-63):**\n- Turn 59: Move L to (2,6) — avoids central dead end, positions for (2,5).\n- Turn 60: Move D to (2,5) — eat (2,5) for +1 score, length 13.\n- Turn 61: Move L to (1,5) — only safe move, avoids trap.\n- Turn 62: Move D to (1,4) — continue down left edge.\n- Turn 63: Move D to (1,3) — maintain downward path; sets up turn 64 move to (2,3).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 59: L \\\\\nTurn 60: D \\\\\nTurn 61: L \\\\\nTurn 62: D \\\\\nTurn 63: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 60, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nInternal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So these are cells I must avoid.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). That's 12 segments. Head direction is left, so last move was to the left.\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,3) with life span 2, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,2) with life span 5, value +1\n\n- (2,5) with life span 8, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so all good to eat.\n\nLife span: for (5,3), it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 60, life span is 2, meaning it will disappear after turn 61? Let me clarify.\n\nThe life span is given as the remaining turns it exists. So for (5,3), life span 2: after turn 60, it decreases to 1; after turn 61, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 60 or 61, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) life span 5: exists until turn 64 (since turn 60:5, 61:4, 62:3, 63:2, 64:1, 65:0 gone? Let's count properly.\n\nAt turn t, life span N means:\n\n- On turn t, life span N\n\n- After turn t, life span N-1 for next turn\n\n- It exists as long as life span > 0\n\nSo for (5,3), life span 2 at turn 60:\n\n- Turn 60: can be eaten, life span 2\n\n- Turn 61: if not eaten, life span 1, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 62: life span 0, gone\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) life span 5:\n\n- Turn 60:5\n\n- 61:4\n\n- 62:3\n\n- 63:2\n\n- 64:1\n\n- 65:0 gone\n\n(2,5) life span 8:\n\n- Turn 60:8 to 67:1, 68 gone.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,6), direction left. So possible moves: since moving left, I cannot instantly reverse to right, so possible moves are up, down, left. But I need to consider walls, obstacles, and body.\n\nCurrent position: head (2,6), moving left.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (2,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n\n- Down: (2,5) – is this valid? Let's see.\n\n- Left: (1,6) – x=0 is wall, but x=1 is within 1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are valid, except obstacles.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is an obstacle, but (2,5) is not listed as obstacle, so should be free.\n\nList all possible moves from (2,6):\n\n- Up: (2,7) – but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Down: (2,5) – let's check if it's occupied or obstacle. Snake positions: from head to tail: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). So (2,5) is not in snake body. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is not listed, so should be free. Also, not wall. So (2,5) is valid.\n\n- Left: (1,6) – x=1, y=6. Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 is ok. Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,6) is not listed, so free. Snake body: (1,6) not occupied, so valid.\n\n- Right: (3,6) but that's the next segment, body, and since direction is left, moving right would be reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is left, so cannot move right to (3,6).\n\nSo possible moves: Down to (2,5) or Left to (1,6).\n\nNow, there is food at (2,5) with value +1, life span 8.\n\n(2,5) is directly below head, so moving down would eat it.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food at (5,3) and (5,2), but (5,3) has short life, only 2 turns left.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid 8x8, rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (2,6), body: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nSo the snake is long, 12 segments.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (5,3) value 1, life 2\n\n- (5,2) value 1, life 5\n\n- (2,5) value 1, life 8\n\n(2,5) is adjacent down from head, so if I move down, I eat it immediately on turn 60.\n\nBut is there any danger?\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so new tail is added, but since I move to (2,5), the tail was at (3,2), but when I move, the tail moves to (2,2) or something? Let's see snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves to a new cell, if it eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move, else tail moves forward.\n\nStandard snake: if eat food, head moves to food, new segment added, so tail stays; else, head moves, tail moves one step.\n\nBut here, food is at (2,5), which is empty now.\n\nIf I move down to (2,5), I eat the food, so new head position (2,5), and a new segment is added at the end, so tail remains, but since tail moves? Let's clarify.\n\nSnake positions: current [ (2,6), (3,6), ..., (3,2) ]\n\nAfter move down to (2,5): head moves to (2,5), and since food eaten, the body stays, but a new segment is added, so positions become [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) ]? No.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell and eats food, the snake grows: the head moves to the new position, and the tail does not move, so the body gains one segment.\n\nSo from positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving to new cell C:\n\n- If C has food, new positions: [C, H, B1, B2, ..., T]  // tail T remains, so length +1\n\n- If no food, new positions: [C, H, B1, B2, ..., T_prev] where T_prev is the second last, tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, if I move down to (2,5), which has food, so new head is (2,5), then previous head (2,6) becomes new neck, and so on, down to tail (3,2) remains, and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the end, so positions: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) ] but the last was (3,2), and we add a new tail, so tail becomes (3,2) still, but new segment added after it? No.\n\nStandard: after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail is still there, and we add a new segment at the position where tail was, but since tail doesn't move, it stays, and the new segment is effectively the old tail position, but now there are two segments there? I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me think: positions list is ordered from head to tail.\n\nCurrent: index 0: head (2,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (5,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,2), 11: tail (3,2)\n\nAfter moving down to (2,5), which has food. So head moves to (2,5). Since food eaten, we do not remove the tail. So new positions: new head at (2,5), then the previous head (2,6) becomes position 1, (3,6) position 2, and so on, up to tail (3,2) at position 11, and a new tail is added at the end, but where? Since tail doesn't move, the new segment is added at the current tail position, so (3,2) becomes the second last, and the new tail is at (3,2) as well? But that would be two segments at same cell, which is wrong.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nCorrect: when snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail end, so the tail position remains occupied, but the tail segment doesn't move; it stays, and the new segment is added after it, but since it's a list, we add a new position at the end.\n\nFor example, if tail is at T, after eating, new positions: [C, H, B1, B2, ..., T] and then we add a new segment at T, so [C, H, B1, B2, ..., T, T] but that would have duplicate, which is bad.\n\nNo: when eating, the head moves to C, and the body includes all previous positions, so the list is [C] + previous list, and since tail is not removed, the length increases by one.\n\nSo previous list: [H, B1, B2, ..., T] with length L.\n\nAfter move to C with food: new list [C, H, B1, B2, ..., T] with length L+1.\n\nThe tail is still T, and a new segment is at T, but it's the same cell? No, in the list, T is still there, but it's not a new cell; the cell T is occupied, and we have a new segment at that cell, but it's the same segment.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nPractically, when head moves to a cell with food, the snake grows, so the new head is at C, and the tail remains in place, so the segment that was the tail is still there, and it will move only on the next move if no food eaten.\n\nThe positions: after move, the head is at C, and the body includes all previous positions from H to T, so the cell T is still occupied, and since we add a segment, the tail is still at T for now.\n\nThen on next move, if no food, tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, for (2,5), if I move down, new positions: head at (2,5), then previous head (2,6) is now body, then (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), and tail (3,2) is still there. Since I ate food, I add a new segment at the end, so the new tail is at (3,2), but it was already there, so we add a new position (3,2) at the end, but it's the same cell, so now (3,2) has two segments? That can't be.\n\nI think I have a fundamental mistake.\n\nLet's read the rules.\n\nFrom the core rules: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nAnd \"the tail will also move forward\" only when not eating.\n\nFrom the description: when eating, the head moves to the food cell, and the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; thus, the cell where the tail was remains occupied, and a new segment is added there, but it's the same cell, so no problem; it's just that the tail stays for one more turn.\n\nIn terms of positions list, for example:\n\nCurrent: [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n\nMove to D with food: new positions [D, A, B, C] so now head D, tail C, and C is still occupied.\n\nThen next move, say to E with no food: move to E, no food, so new positions [E, D, A, B] and tail B, so C is vacated.\n\nIn the case where I move to (2,5), which has food, new positions: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) ] so head (2,5), and tail (3,2), and the cell (3,2) is occupied by the tail.\n\nPreviously, (3,2) was tail, now it's still tail, but the snake is longer.\n\nIn the list, it's fine; no duplicate cells because we added a new head and kept all body.\n\nBack to the move.\n\nAt (2,6), I can move down to (2,5) or left to (1,6).\n\nIf I move down to (2,5), I eat the food there, so score +1, length 13 now.\n\nThen head is at (2,5), and direction is down (since I moved down).\n\nThen possible next moves.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nThere is also food at (5,3) with short life, only 2 turns left, so it will disappear after turn 61, meaning I can eat it on turn 60 or 61.\n\nTurn 60 is current turn.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5) now, it might be available later, but life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut (5,3) has only 2 turns left.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, so space might be tight.\n\nCurrent grid: let's sketch a map.\n\nY from 0 to 7 bottom to top? Usually in grids, y=0 is bottom, but in coordinates, it might be top or bottom. In the positions, (2,6) is head, and (2,2) is lower, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 top.\n\nIn the walls, y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSimilarly x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow y=7: walls except x=1 to 6\n\nBut y=7 is wall, so not accessible.\n\nAccessible y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells from y=1 to y=6 are free, except obstacles.\n\nx from 1 to 6 free, except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1) is x=5,y=1, etc.\n\nNow, snake positions:\n\nHead (2,6) at top-left area.\n\nBody: (3,6), (4,6) — so row 6, x=2,3,4\n\nThen (4,5), so down to y=5\n\n(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left and bottom.\n\nFood at (5,3), (5,2), (2,5)\n\n(2,5) is below head, (5,3) is near the body, (5,2) is below that.\n\n(5,3) has life span 2, so I need to eat it soon if possible.\n\nBut from head at (2,6), to reach (5,3), it's not adjacent; I need to move right and down, but there are obstacles and body in the way.\n\nPossible paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider the options for turn 60.\n\nOption 1: Move down to (2,5) — eat food, grow to 13 segments.\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction down.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: down to (2,4), but (2,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (2,4), so cannot move there.\n\nLeft: (1,5) — x=1,y=5, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles are (1,2) but y=2, so (1,5) free), not snake body? Current body after move: if I moved to (2,5), new positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nSo (1,5) is free, not occupied.\n\nRight: (3,5) — is it free? (3,5) not in positions, not obstacle, so free.\n\nUp: (2,6) but that's the neck, so occupied by body, cannot move there.\n\nSo from (2,5), after moving down, possible moves: left to (1,5), or right to (3,5), or down to (2,4) but obstacle, invalid. So only left or right.\n\nIf I move left to (1,5), then head at (1,5), direction left.\n\nThen next moves.\n\nBut I need to think about the food at (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3.\n\nFrom (2,5), if I go right to (3,5), then I can go down or right, but to reach (5,3), I need to go down and right.\n\nBut there is body at (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), etc., so the area around (5,3) might be blocked.\n\nLet's see what cells are free.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (2,5) now to save space or something, but it has long life, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut if I don't eat it now, I can go for (5,3) which is expiring soon.\n\nBut from (2,6), if I don't move down, I can only move left to (1,6).\n\nOption 2: Move left to (1,6).\n\nThen head at (1,6), direction left (since moved left).\n\nThen possible moves from (1,6): since direction left, cannot reverse right, so up, down, left.\n\nUp: (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nDown: (1,5) — free, as above.\n\nLeft: (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only down to (1,5).\n\nThen head at (1,5), direction down.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: down to (1,4), left to (0,4) wall invalid, right to (2,5), or up to (1,6) but occupied.\n\n(1,4) is free? Not obstacle, not snake. Obstacles: (1,2) but y=4, so free.\n\nSnake positions after moving to (1,6): if I moved left to (1,6), no food, so new positions: head (1,6), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, so [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) ] and tail (3,2) is removed? When no food, tail moves.\n\nCurrent positions: [H (2,6), B1 (3,6), B2 (4,6), B3 (4,5), B4 (5,5), B5 (5,4), B6 (4,4), B7 (4,3), B8 (3,3), B9 (2,3), B10 (2,2), T (3,2)]\n\nMove left to (1,6), no food at (1,6), so new head (1,6), and tail moves away from (3,2), so new positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) ] and (3,2) is vacated.\n\nLength still 12.\n\nThen from (1,6), I can move down to (1,5), which is free.\n\nThen head at (1,5), direction down.\n\nThen from (1,5), possible moves: down to (1,4), left to (0,4) wall invalid, right to (2,5), or up to (1,6) occupied.\n\nSo down or right.\n\nIf I move right to (2,5), then I eat the food there, since (2,5) has food.\n\nSo in this case, I eat (2,5) on turn 61 or something.\n\nBut let's think about the short-life food.\n\nFood at (5,3) life span 2 at turn 60.\n\nIf I don't eat it on turn 60 or 61, it disappears.\n\nFrom head at (2,6), to reach (5,3) in one move? Not possible, not adjacent.\n\nIn two moves? (5,3) is at x=5,y=3.\n\nFrom (2,6), possible to go to (3,6) but cannot, because reverse not allowed, and it's body.\n\nOnly down or left.\n\nIf I go down to (2,5), then from there to (3,5) or (1,5), but (3,5) is not directly to (5,3).\n\nFrom (2,5) to (5,3) is 3 steps away in Manhattan distance.\n\nSimilarly, from left move, to (1,6) then to (1,5), then to (2,5) or (1,4), still far from (5,3).\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,3) on turn 60 or 61 from here. Turn 60 I move to adjacent, turn 61 I move again, so on turn 61 I can be at cells like (2,5), (1,5), (1,6) but (1,6) is not near.\n\nFrom (2,6) turn 60 move down to (2,5), then turn 61 move to (3,5) or (1,5), both are at distance from (5,3): (3,5) to (5,3) is |3-5| + |5-3| = 2+2=4, so at least 2 more moves, so on turn 62 at earliest, but on turn 62, (5,3) is gone, life span: turn 60 life 2, so after turn 60 it becomes 1, after turn 61 it becomes 0, so on turn 62 it is gone. So last chance to eat is turn 61.\n\nOn turn 61, (5,3) can be eaten if head is there.\n\nBut from possible positions on turn 61, after moving on turn 60.\n\nIf I move down on turn 60 to (2,5), then on turn 61, I can be at (3,5) or (1,5), neither is (5,3).\n\nIf I move left on turn 60 to (1,6), then on turn 61 I move to (1,5), which is not (5,3).\n\nSo in both cases, on turn 61, I am not at (5,3), and I cannot reach it from there in one move since not adjacent.\n\n(5,3) is adjacent to (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3) but (6,3) might be wall or something, x=6,y=3.\n\nx=6 is not wall, walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 ok, but (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,3) is free.\n\nBut from my possible positions on turn 61, I am at (2,5) or (1,5) or (3,5) or (1,5), all far from (5,3).\n\nSo it's impossible to eat (5,3) before it disappears. I cannot reach it on turn 60 or 61.\n\nTherefore, I should forget about (5,3) and focus on other food.\n\n(5,3) will disappear unused, but that's fine, I can't get it.\n\nNow, other food: (5,2) life 5, so until turn 64, and (2,5) life 8.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,5), the snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver, but I need to survive.\n\nBut there is a danger mentioned: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, where is the tail?\n\nCurrent tail is at (3,2).\n\nHead at (2,6), not adjacent to tail.\n\nIf I eat (2,5), new head at (2,5), tail at (3,2), distance |2-3| + |5-2| =1+3=4, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nAfter eating, tail at (3,2), head at (2,5), not adjacent.\n\nNow, possible moves from head after eating (2,5): as before, down to (2,4) obstacle, invalid; left to (1,5); right to (3,5).\n\n(1,5) is free, (3,5) is free.\n\n(3,5) is above (3,6), but (3,6) is body, so (3,5) should be free? Current positions after eating (2,5): [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) ]\n\nSo cells occupied: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n\n(1,5) not occupied, free.\n\n(3,5) not occupied, free.\n\n(2,4) obstacle.\n\nSo from (2,5), I can go left to (1,5) or right to (3,5).\n\nNow, if I go left to (1,5), then head at (1,5), direction left.\n\nThen from (1,5), possible moves: down to (1,4), right to (2,5) but occupied, up to (1,6) occupied, left to (0,5) wall invalid. So only down to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is free, no obstacle, not occupied.\n\nThen head at (1,4), and so on.\n\nIf from (2,5) I go right to (3,5), head at (3,5), direction right.\n\nThen from (3,5), possible moves: up to (3,6) occupied, down to (3,4), left to (2,5) occupied, right to (4,5) occupied? (4,5) is in positions, yes, body.\n\nSo only down to (3,4), if free.\n\n(3,4) is not in positions, not obstacle (obstacles (2,4) but y=4 x=2, (3,4) not listed), so free.\n\nSo down to (3,4).\n\nThen head at (3,4), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about the food at (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2.\n\nAlso, (5,3) is there but expiring.\n\nNow, the snake body is around, so to reach (5,2), I need a path.\n\nMoreover, after growing, the snake is longer, so space might be tight.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (2,5) now to keep the snake shorter, but since (2,5) has long life, I can eat it later when convenient.\n\nBut if I don't eat it now, on turn 60, I move left to (1,6).\n\nThen as above, on turn 60 move left to (1,6), no food, positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) ] tail (2,2) since (3,2) removed.\n\nThen on turn 61, I must move down to (1,5), since only choice.\n\nMove to (1,5), and (1,5) has no food, so new positions: head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), and tail (2,2) removed? When no food, tail moves.\n\nAfter turn 60 move to (1,6): positions [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) ]\n\nTurn 61 move to (1,5): if no food, new head (1,5), then body (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), and tail (2,2) removed, so positions [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) ] length 12.\n\nNow, (2,5) is free and has food, but I am at (1,5), so I can move right to (2,5) on turn 61.\n\nMove to (2,5), which has food, so eat it, grow to 13.\n\nNew positions: [ (2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) ] head (2,5), tail (2,3).\n\nThen direction right.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: up to (2,6) occupied, down to (2,4) obstacle, left to (1,5) occupied, right to (3,5) free? (3,5) not occupied, not obstacle, so free.\n\nSo only right to (3,5).\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction right.\n\nThen from (3,5), as before, down to (3,4) or up to (3,6) occupied, etc.\n\nBut now, the tail is at (2,3), and head at (2,5) or (3,5), not adjacent.\n\nNow, food at (5,2) is available.\n\n(5,2) at x=5,y=2.\n\nFrom current after eating (2,5) on turn 61, head at (2,5), then to (3,5), then to (3,4) or something.\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nThen to (4,4) but (4,4) is body? In positions after eating (2,5): [ (2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) ]\n\nSo (4,4) is occupied, (5,4) occupied, etc.\n\nTo reach (5,2), I need to go down.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) I can go down to (3,4), then to (4,4) occupied, or (3,3) occupied, etc.\n\n(4,4) is occupied, so I cannot go directly.\n\nFrom (3,5), move down to (3,4), which is free.\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction down.\n\nThen from (3,4), possible moves: down to (3,3) occupied, left to (2,4) obstacle, right to (4,4) occupied, up to (3,5) occupied. All directions blocked? Down (3,3) body, left (2,4) obstacle, right (4,4) body, up (3,5) body. So trapped! Dead end.\n\nOh, big problem.\n\nIf I eat (2,5) and then go to (3,5) and then to (3,4), I get stuck because (3,4) is surrounded.\n\nIn the first scenario, if I eat (2,5) on turn 60, then from (2,5), I can go left to (1,5) or right to (3,5).\n\nIf I go left to (1,5), then to (1,4), etc., which might be safer.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 60: move down to (2,5), eat food, positions: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) ]\n\nThen turn 61: move left to (1,5), no food, so new positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) ] and tail (3,2) removed? When no food, tail moves.\n\nAfter turn 60, positions with 13 segments: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) ]\n\nTurn 61 move to (1,5), no food at (1,5), so new head (1,5), then body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), and tail (3,2) removed, so positions: [ (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) ] length 13? No, tail removed, so length 12.\n\nOriginal after eat: 13 segments.\n\nAfter move with no food: head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length same or decreases? When no food, length unchanged, tail moves, so one segment removed from tail.\n\nSo from 13 segments, after move no food: new head position, and tail removed, so 12 segments.\n\nPositions: new head at C, then the first body segment is previous head, and so on, up to the second last, tail removed.\n\nSo in this case, after move to (1,5) no food: new positions [ (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) ] and (2,2) removed, tail is (2,3).\n\nList: indices: 0: new head (1,5), 1: previous head (2,5), 2: (2,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (4,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (5,4), 8: (4,4), 9: (4,3), 10: (3,3), 11: tail (2,3)\n\n(2,2) was tail, removed.\n\nNow head at (1,5), direction left (since moved left from (2,5)).\n\nThen possible moves: down to (1,4), left to (0,4) wall invalid, right to (2,5) occupied, up to (1,6) occupied. So only down to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is free, not obstacle, not occupied.\n\nMove to (1,4), no food, so new positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), and tail (2,3) removed? Tail was (2,3), so new positions: [ (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) ] tail (3,3).\n\nThen from (1,4), I can continue down or right, etc.\n\nBut now, the area below is more open.\n\nFood at (5,2) is still there.\n\nTo reach (5,2), I can go down to (1,3), (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\nFrom (1,4), move down to (1,3), if free.\n\n(1,3) not occupied, not obstacle, so free.\n\nThen to (1,2) obstacle, invalid, so from (1,3) I can go right to (2,3) or down to (1,2) invalid, etc.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nBack to the decision at turn 60.\n\nIf I move left to (1,6) on turn 60, then to (1,5) on turn 61, then to (2,5) on turn 61 if I move right, but on turn 61 from (1,5), I can move right to (2,5) to eat, or down to (1,4).\n\nIf I eat (2,5) on turn 61, as in the second scenario, I end up with positions [ (2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) ] after eating, then from (2,5) I can only move right to (3,5), then to (3,4), and stuck.\n\nSo that path leads to death.\n\nTherefore, moving left on turn 60 and then eating on turn 61 is dangerous because I get trapped.\n\nWhereas if I eat on turn 60 and then move left to (1,5), then down to (1,4), I have more space.\n\nMoreover, in that case, the tail is moving, so cells are freeing up.\n\nFor example, after turn 60 eat at (2,5), positions with tail at (3,2).\n\nThen turn 61 move to (1,5), no food, tail moves, (3,2) vacated.\n\nThen turn 62 move to (1,4), no food, tail moves, (2,3) vacated or something.\n\nIn the sequence: after turn 61, positions [ (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) ] tail (2,3)\n\nTurn 62 move to (1,4), no food, new positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), and tail (2,3) removed, so positions [ (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) ] tail (3,3)\n\nThen I can move down to (1,3), etc.\n\nNow, food at (5,2) is at (5,2), and it has life span 5, so until turn 64.\n\nFrom here, I can navigate to it.\n\nFor example, from (1,4) to (1,3), then to (2,3) but (2,3) might be free later, or to (1,2) obstacle, so to (2,3) if free.\n\nCurrently (2,3) is occupied, but as tail moves, it might free.\n\nIn the positions above, after turn 62, (2,3) is not in positions, vacated.\n\nPositions: [ (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) ] so (2,3) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is tail.\n\nSo from (1,4), I can move down to (1,3), free.\n\nThen head at (1,3), direction down.\n\nThen from (1,3), possible moves: down to (1,2) obstacle, left to (0,3) wall invalid, right to (2,3), or up to (1,4) occupied.\n\n(2,3) is free, as above.\n\nMove to (2,3), no food, then to (3,3) but (3,3) is tail, but when I move, tail moves, so it might be ok.\n\nFrom (1,3) move right to (2,3), no food, so new positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), and tail (4,3) or something?

All blocked! Dead.\n\nSo moving right to (3,5) and down to (3,4) leads to death, as I thought.\n\nTherefore, I must not go that way.\n\nSo the only safe way is to go left after eating (2,5).\n\nThen I can reach (5,2) later if possible, but with the life span, it might be tight.\n\nSince (5,2) has life 5, and I can eat it on turn 64 or earlier if I go directly.\n\nBut from the left, it's far.\n\nPerhaps on turn 60, I don't eat (2,5), and move left to (1,6), then on turn 61 move down to (1,5), then on turn 61 I can choose not to eat (2,5) and move down to (1,4) instead.\n\nThen from (1,4), I can go down to (1,3), then right to (2,3), then down to (2,2), etc., and then to (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) to eat.\n\nLet's see the turns.\n\nTurn 60: move left to (1,6), no eat\n\nPositions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) ] tail (2,2)\n\nTurn 61: move down to (1,5), no eat (assuming no food, but (1,5) has no food)\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), and tail (2,2) removed, so positions [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) ] tail (2,3)\n\nNow, instead of moving right to (2,5), I move down to (1,4), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), and tail (2,3) removed, so positions [ (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) ] tail (3,3)\n\nTurn 62: move down to (1,3), no food\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), and tail (3,3) removed, so positions [ (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3) ] tail (4,3)\n\nTurn 63: move right to (2,3), no food\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), and tail (4,3) removed, so positions [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) ] tail (4,4)\n\nTurn 64: move down to (2,2), no food\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and tail (4,4) removed, so positions [ (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ] tail (5,4)\n\nNow (5,2) is at (5,2), and on turn 64, life span: turn 60:5, 61:4, 62:3, 63:2, 64:1, so can be eaten on turn 64.\n\nBut I am at (2,2), not at (5,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move down to (2,1) but y=0 wall? y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nLeft to (1,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nRight to (3,2), or up to (2,3) occupied.\n\nSo only right to (3,2).\n\nMove to (3,2), no food.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move down to (3,1) but y=0 wall? y=1 is ok, y=0 wall.\n\n(3,1) not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,1) but (3,1) free.\n\nBut (5,2) is not reached.\n\nOn turn 64, I am at (2,2), move to (3,2), then on turn 65, (5,2) is gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,2) if I go this way.\n\nIf I eat (2,5) on turn 61, I get trapped.\n\nSo the only way to eat (5,2) is to go towards it directly.\n\nFrom turn 60, if I move down to (2,5) and eat, then on turn 61, instead of left, I need to go right but carefully.\n\nFrom (2,5), after eating, I can go right to (3,5), then on turn 61 at (3,5), I must not go down to (3,4), but I can only go down, as other directions blocked.\n\nFrom (3,5), only down to (3,4), then stuck.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nSo it's impossible to go right without dying.\n\nTherefore, I should not attempt to eat (5,2) if it means risking death.\n\nSince (5,2) has life 5, and I might not reach it in time, I should focus on survival and eat (2,5) which is easy.\n\nThen later, as the snake moves, cells free up, and I can find other food or new food spawns.\n\nThe food given might be all, but new food can spawn, but for now, only these are given.\n\nBut in the state, only these food are listed, so I think for the immediate future, these are the only ones.\n\nBut life span, (2,5) has life 8, so I can eat it later.\n\nOn turn 60, I can move left to (1,6), then on turn 61 move down to (1,5), then on turn 61 I can move down to (1,4) instead of eating (2,5).\n\nThen (2,5) is still there, and I can eat it later when I have a path to (5,2).\n\nFor example, from (1,4), I can go to (1,3), then to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (4,2), then to (5,2).\n\nFrom (3,2) to (4,2), then to (5,2).\n\n(4,2) is free.\n\nBut turns: turn 60: move left to (1,6)\n\nTurn 61: move down to (1,5)  -- at (1,5)\n\nTurn 62: move down to (1,4)  -- at (1,4)\n\nTurn 63: move down to (1,3)  -- at (1,3)\n\nTurn 64: move right to (2,3)  -- at (2,3)\n\nTurn 65: move right to (3,3)  -- at (3,3)\n\nBut (5,2) gone on turn 65.\n\nOn turn 64 at (2,3), I can move down to (2,2) instead of right, but then to (3,2) on turn 65, but (5,2) gone.\n\nStill not reach.\n\nIf on turn 63 at (1,3), I move right to (2,3), same as above.\n\nOr from (1,4) on turn 62, I can move right to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo no, I cannot reach (5,2) in time from the left path.\n\nTherefore, I should accept that I can't eat (5,2) and focus on surviving with the available food.\n\n(2,5) is available with life 8, so I can eat it now or later.\n\nBut if I eat it later, I might have more space.\n\nBut for now, on turn 60, moving down to (2,5) and eating is safe if I go left afterwards.\n\nThen I can explore the bottom left area.\n\nAlso, there might be new food.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for the next few turns.\n\nThe output should be for turn 60, 61, 62, etc., but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but the answer format is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the boxed answer, list turn t1: action, turn t1+1: action, etc., for as many as I can or as needed.\n\nSince the state is given, I can plan a sequence.\n\nTo maximize score, eating (2,5) now gives +1, and then I can try for other.\n\nSince (5,3) is expiring and I can't get it, and (5,2) I might not get, so eating (2,5) is the best immediate action.\n\nSo on turn 60, move down to (2,5) and eat.\n\nThen on turn 61, move left to (1,5) to avoid the right trap.\n\nThen on turn 62, move down to (1,4).\n\nThen on turn 63, move down to (1,3).\n\nThen on turn 64, move right to (2,3), and so on.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=60.\n\nSo for turn 60: move down (D)\n\nThen turn 61: move left (L)\n\nThen turn 62: move down (D)\n\nThen turn 63: move down (D) to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 64: move right (R) to (2,3)\n\netc.\n\nBut I don't know beyond that.\n\nSince the food at (2,5) is eaten on turn 60, it's gone, so only (5,2) left, but I can't reach it in time, so no more food for now.\n\nBut new food might spawn, but not specified.\n\nSo for survival, I can continue moving in the bottom left.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), I can move down to (2,2) if free, etc.\n\nBut let's stop at 5 turns for the answer.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 60: D\n\nTurn 61: L\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: D\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nBut on turn 63 at (1,3), move down to (1,3)? From (1,4) move down to (1,3), then from (1,3) move right to (2,3).\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it clear.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n**Current State (Turn 60):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 (cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are accessible, with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7).\n- **Internal Obstacles**: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — must avoid these.\n- **Snake**: Head at (2,6), direction left. Positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)] — length 12.\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,3): Value +1, life span 2 (disappears after turn 61).\n  - (5,2): Value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 64).\n  - (2,5): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 67).\n- **Immediate Moves from (2,6)**: \n  - Up (U) to (2,7): Invalid (y=7 wall).\n  - Down (D) to (2,5): Valid, contains food.\n  - Left (L) to (1,6): Valid, empty.\n  - Right (R) to (3,6): Invalid (reverse move not allowed, and body collision).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- **Food at (5,3) is unreachable**: It expires after turn 61, but from (2,6), no path reaches it in 1-2 moves without risking death or violating rules. Thus, ignore it.\n- **Food at (5,2) is risky to pursue**: Life span allows until turn 64, but the snake body blocks direct paths. Attempting to reach it quickly could lead to traps (e.g., near (3,4)). Prioritize survival over forcing this.\n- **Food at (2,5) is safe and valuable**: Eating it on turn 60 gives +1 score and grows snake to length 13. It has long life, but eating now is optimal to avoid future space issues.\n- **Post-Eating Path**: After eating (2,5), moving left to (1,5) avoids a deadly trap near (3,4). Then, moving down opens space in the bottom-left, where tail movements free up cells for future exploration.\n- **5-Turn Plan**: Focus on eating (2,5) immediately, then move left and down to survive. Avoid the right/down path (toward (5,2)) due to collision risks. After turn 64, reassess based on new positions and food.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 60-64):**\n- **Turn 60: Down (D)** — Move to (2,5), eat food (+1 score). New head: (2,5), direction down.\n- **Turn 61: Left (L)** — Move to (1,5), empty. New head: (1,5), direction left. Avoids right trap.\n- **Turn 62: Down (D)** — Move to (1,4), empty. New head: (1,4), direction down.\n- **Turn 63: Down (D)** — Move to (1,3), empty. New head: (1,3), direction down.\n- **Turn 64: Right (R)** — Move to (2,3), empty. New head: (2,3), direction right. Positions free up; prepare to navigate toward bottom or new food.\n\n**Why this sequence?**\n- **Turn 60: D** — Eats easy food for score, avoids losing (2,5) later to body blocks.\n- **Turn 61: L** — Steers clear of the body cluster near (3,5)/(4,5); moving right would lead to death at (3,4).\n- **Turns 62-63: D, D** — Explores open bottom-left area; no immediate food but frees tail cells (e.g., (3,2) vacates).\n- **Turn 64: R** — Starts moving right toward potential new food; (5,2) may expire, but survival is priority.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: This path has no wall/obstacle collisions and maintains distance from body. After turn 64, the snake can loop back or seek new food with more space.\n\n**Long-Term Survival (Post-Turn 64):**\n- With tail moving, cells like (3,2) and (2,2) free up, allowing access to (5,2) if still available (life span 5, but turns 60-64 used). New food may spawn.\n- If no food, continue safe navigation: e.g., from (2,3), move down to (2,2) or right to (3,3), then to (3,2), etc.\n- Always check for Tail Reward Danger (head adjacent to tail with food), but not an issue here.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 60: D \\\\\nTurn 61: L \\\\\nTurn 62: D \\\\\nTurn 63: D \\\\\nTurn 64: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 61. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I should note these down to avoid them.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). So the snake has 13 segments. Head direction is down, which is (x, y-1), so moving downwards.\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,3) with life span 1, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,2) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive in this case, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all.\n\nLife span: for (5,3), life span 1, so it disappears after this turn if not eaten. Since we're at turn 61, if not eaten now, it vanishes.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 61, if we don't eat (5,3), it will be gone by turn 62.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) has life span 4, so it will disappear in 4 turns if not eaten.\n\n(3,4) has life span 10, so it has more time.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,5)\n\nBody: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nTail is (3,2)\n\nHead direction down, so from (2,5), moving down would be to (2,4).\n\nBut let's see what (2,4) is. (2,4) is an internal obstacle? Obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Yes, (2,4) is an obstacle! So snake cannot move to (2,4) because it's a wall.\n\nSimilarly, other obstacles.\n\nSo possible moves from head (2,5):\n\nCurrent direction down, so possible moves: down, left, right? But no instant reverse. Head direction is down, so cannot move up (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: down, left, right.\n\nBut down to (2,4): (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nLeft: from (2,5) left would be (1,5). Is that valid? x=1, y=5.\n\nCheck walls: borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,5) is not border wall. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,5) not listed, so should be free, but need to check if occupied by snake.\n\nSnake positions: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), etc. (1,5) is not in snake positions, so should be free.\n\nRight: from (2,5) right to (3,5). (3,5) not in obstacles, not in snake positions? Snake has (3,6), (3,3), (3,2), but not (3,5). So (3,5) should be free.\n\nUp: but up is opposite to current direction down, so cannot move up. Reverse not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: left to (1,5), right to (3,5).\n\nCannot move down because obstacle.\n\nNow, food: (5,3), (5,2), (3,4)\n\n(5,3) has life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or lost.\n\nBut (5,3) is at (5,3). From head (2,5), how to get there? Not directly.\n\nAlso, (5,3) might be under snake body? Let's see.\n\nSnake positions: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), etc. (5,4) is a body segment, and (5,3) is food? (5,3) is food position, but is it occupied by snake?\n\nSnake has (5,4), (5,5), but not (5,3). (5,3) is a separate food cell.\n\nIn the snake positions, (5,5), (5,4), then (4,4), so (5,3) is not occupied by snake, it's a free cell with food.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is free, (3,4) is free.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is not in snake positions.\n\nSnake has (3,6), (3,3), (3,2), but not (3,4) or (3,5).\n\n(3,4) is food position.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: left to (1,5) or right to (3,5).\n\nIf I go left to (1,5), then next moves.\n\nBut I need to think about eating food, especially (5,3) which expires soon.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), head at (2,5). Distance is |5-2|=3 in x, |3-5|=2 in y, so Manhattan distance 5, but with obstacles, not direct.\n\nSince life span 1, I can only eat it this turn if I move to it, but I'm at (2,5), (5,3) is not adjacent, so impossible to eat (5,3) this turn. Head can only move one step per turn.\n\nAdjacent cells to head: up (2,6), but up is opposite direction, cannot move; down (2,4) obstacle; left (1,5); right (3,5). None of these is (5,3), so indeed, cannot eat (5,3) this turn. Since life span 1, it will disappear after this turn, so (5,3) is lost; we cannot eat it.\n\nLife span 1, at turn 61, if not eaten, it disappears, so for turn 61, we can't reach it, so it will be gone.\n\nNow, other food: (5,2) life span 4, so must be eaten within 4 turns including current? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 61, life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 more turns? Let's clarify.\n\nThe state says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" for (5,2) it's (5,2,4,1), so life span 4 at turn 61.\n\nAnd \"life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning at turn t+L it is gone.\n\nFor example, (5,3) life span 1 at turn 61, so if not eaten on turn 61, it disappears at turn 62.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) life span 4 at turn 61, so it will disappear after 4 turns, i.e., at turn 65 if not eaten.\n\n(3,4) life span 10, disappears at turn 71 if not eaten.\n\nSince we can't eat (5,3), it will be lost.\n\nNow, head at (2,5), possible moves: left to (1,5) or right to (3,5).\n\nI need to plan for multiple turns.\n\nAlso, consider the tail. Tail is at (3,2), and there is food at (5,2), which is close to tail.\n\nBut tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because after eating, tail grows and collides with head.\n\nBut here, tail is at (3,2), food at (5,2), not on tail.\n\n(5,2) is a separate cell.\n\nNow, let's list all free cells and possible paths.\n\nFirst, the grid:\n\nI'll make a grid representation for x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders and internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo cells that are walls:\n\n- All x=0, x=7 for all y\n\n- All y=0, y=7 for all x\n\n- Plus (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nHead: (2,5)\n\nBody: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nTail: (3,2)\n\n(3,2) is both tail and a position, but it's occupied.\n\nFood: (5,3), (5,2), (3,4)\n\n(5,3) will disappear after this turn since we can't eat it.\n\nNow, from head (2,5), moves:\n\n- Left: (1,5) - is this free? (1,5) not wall, not snake? Snake has (2,5), (2,6), etc., no (1,5). Obstacles have (1,2), but not (1,5), so (1,5) should be free.\n\n- Right: (3,5) - not wall, not snake, free.\n\nCannot down or up as discussed.\n\nIf I move left to (1,5), new head position (1,5), direction left? Or I need to set new direction.\n\nAfter move, the head direction changes to the move direction.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nNow, let's think about eating food.\n\nFirst, (5,2) at (5,2), life span 4, so we have until turn 64 to eat it? Turn 61: life span 4, so disappears at turn 65? Let's define turns.\n\nAt turn t=61:\n\n- Food (5,3): life span 1, if not eaten, gone at t=62\n\n- Food (5,2): life span 4, gone at t=65 if not eaten\n\n- Food (3,4): life span 10, gone at t=71\n\nSince (5,3) can't be eaten now, it will be gone.\n\nNow, (5,2) is at (5,2), which is close to the tail area.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4).\n\nFrom head (2,5), if I go right to (3,5), then I can potentially go to (3,4) or (4,5), etc.\n\nIf I go left to (1,5), I might go towards other areas, but there might be less food.\n\nI need to consider the map.\n\nLet me list the free cells around.\n\nAlso, when the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells are freed.\n\nFor example, if we move, the tail (3,2) will move to the next position when we eat food, but if we don't eat, the tail moves away.\n\nCurrently, snake length 13, if we eat food, length increases.\n\nBut for now, no food eaten, so when we move, tail moves, so (3,2) is freed after this move, provided we don't eat food.\n\nSimilarly, other body parts.\n\nLet's simulate the move.\n\nFirst, at turn 61, we must choose action.\n\nOptions: L or R.\n\nIf I go R to (3,5), then new head (3,5), direction right? From (2,5) to (3,5), that's moving right, so new direction right.\n\nThen snake positions: head (3,5), then body: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), and tail (3,2) will be removed since no food eaten, so new positions: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — tail was (3,2), which is gone, and (2,2) is now the tail? Let's list.\n\nOriginal positions: indices 0 to 12: (2,5) head, (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (3,5), and not eating food, tail (3,2) is removed, so new positions: head (3,5), then the previous head (2,5) becomes first body, so (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — and (3,2) is gone. So tail is (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, if we move left to (1,5), new head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,6), etc., tail (2,2).\n\nNow, food (5,3) will disappear after this turn, so at turn 62, only (5,2) and (3,4) food.\n\n(5,2) at (5,2), which is near (2,2) tail, but tail moves.\n\nI need to plan to eat (5,2) within 4 turns.\n\nFrom (2,5), if I go to (3,5), then I am closer to (3,4) food.\n\n(3,4) is food, and (3,4) is adjacent to (3,5)? (3,5) to (3,4) is down, since y decreases down? Let's confirm coordinates.\n\nTypically in grids, y=0 at bottom or top? The state doesn't specify, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that might imply y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, so up increases y.\n\nIn the food positions, (5,3) etc., so y=3 is a row.\n\nBut for movement, from (x,y), U to (x,y+1), D to (x,y-1), L to (x-1,y), R to (x+1,y).\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), but (3,6) is occupied by snake body? After move, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), ... (3,6) is a body segment, so cannot move there.\n\nD to (3,4), which is food (3,4), and (3,4) is not occupied, so can move there and eat.\n\nL to (2,5), but (2,5) is now the first body segment, so cannot move to it, collision.\n\nR to (4,5), which is occupied by body? (4,5) is in positions, (4,5) is body, so cannot.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5), the body segments include (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), etc. (4,5) is a body segment, so (4,5) is occupied.\n\nSo from new head (3,5), adjacent cells:\n\n- U (3,6): occupied by body (3,6)\n\n- D (3,4): free, and has food (3,4)\n\n- L (2,5): occupied by body (2,5)\n\n- R (4,5): occupied by body (4,5)\n\nSo only possible move is down to (3,4), which has food.\n\nThen at turn 62, if we are at (3,5), we can move down to (3,4) and eat the food there.\n\nThen snake grows, length increases.\n\nBut let's see if that's possible from current turn.\n\nFirst, at turn 61, if we move right to (3,5), then at turn 62, we can move down to (3,4) and eat (3,4).\n\n(3,4) has life span 10, so it will be there.\n\nBut we also have (5,2) to consider.\n\nIf we eat (3,4) at turn 62, that's good, but (5,2) might be missed if we don't go there.\n\n(5,2) life span 4, from turn 61, so at turn 61,62,63,64 we can eat it.\n\nTurn 61: we move, not eating (5,2)\n\nTurn 62: if we eat (3,4), we are at (3,4)\n\nThen we need to go to (5,2) in the next few turns.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (5,2), possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the move sequence.\n\nOption 1: turn 61 move R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 62, move D to (3,4), eat food, snake grows. New head (3,4), direction down.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake length increases.\n\nOriginal positions after turn 61 move: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — 13 segments.\n\nThen at turn 62, move D to (3,4), which is food, so we eat, head to (3,4), and the body remains, but we add a new segment, so positions: head (3,4), then previous head (3,5) becomes first body, so (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — 14 segments, tail at (2,2).\n\n(3,4) was food, so eaten, removed.\n\nNow, food left: (5,2) and (5,3) gone.\n\nHead at (3,4), direction down (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves from (3,4):\n\n- U to (3,5): but (3,5) is now body segment, occupied, cannot\n\n- D to (3,3): (3,3) is body segment? Positions: (3,4) head, (3,5) body, (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\n(3,3) is a body segment, so cannot move to (3,3)\n\n- L to (2,4): but (2,4) is an internal obstacle, wall, cannot\n\n- R to (4,4): (4,4) is body segment, occupied, cannot\n\n(4,4) is in the list, position 9: (4,4) is body, yes.\n\nSo from (3,4), all adjacent cells are either wall or body, no possible move! Stuck!\n\nOh no, that's a problem.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4) and eating, the snake is trapped because all directions are blocked.\n\nU: (3,5) body\n\nD: (3,3) body\n\nL: (2,4) wall\n\nR: (4,4) body\n\nIndeed, no escape. So moving to (3,4) leads to death on the next turn.\n\nTherefore, going to (3,5) at turn 61 is bad because it forces us to eat (3,4) and get stuck.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nSo moving right to (3,5) is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, the other option is to move left to (1,5) at turn 61.\n\nThen we can avoid that trap.\n\nSo let's go with left.\n\nTurn 61: move L to (1,5)\n\nNew head (1,5), direction left.\n\nSnake positions after move: not eaten food, so tail moves away.\n\nOriginal: head (2,5) to (1,5), so positions: head (1,5), then body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), and tail (3,2) removed, so new positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — tail at (2,2)\n\n(5,3) food disappears, so food now: (5,2) and (3,4)\n\nHead at (1,5), direction left.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (1,6): is it free? (1,6) not wall, not snake? Snake positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), etc. (2,6) is body, (1,6) not listed, so free? (1,6) not in positions, not obstacle, so yes.\n\n- D to (1,4): similarly, not wall, not snake, free.\n\n- L to (0,5): but x=0 is border wall, cannot.\n\n- R to (2,5): (2,5) is body segment, occupied, cannot.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (1,6) or D to (1,4)\n\nNow, we need to go towards food (5,2) or (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is not far.\n\n(5,2) at (5,2)\n\nFrom (1,5), if we go U to (1,6), or D to (1,4)\n\nGoing down might be better to reach lower rows.\n\n(5,2) is at y=2, (3,4) at y=4.\n\ny=0 bottom, y=7 top, I assume.\n\nSo (1,5) to (1,4) down to y=4.\n\nThen we can go right.\n\nBut let's see obstacles.\n\nAlso, tail at (2,2), which is near (5,2), but not the same.\n\nNow, we need to eat (5,2) within 3 more turns? Turn 61 done, food (5,2) must be eaten by turn 64, since life span 4 at t=61, disappears at t=65, so can be eaten on t=64.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) has time.\n\nBut (5,2) is closer to tail, but tail moves.\n\nAt turn 62, from (1,5), we can move to (1,4) or (1,6)\n\nLet's say we move D to (1,4) to go down.\n\nThen new head (1,4), direction down.\n\nThen positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — tail (2,2)\n\n(2,2) will be tail until we eat.\n\nFrom (1,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (1,5): body, occupied\n\n- D to (1,3): free? (1,3) not wall, not snake, should be free.\n\n- L to (0,4): wall, cannot\n\n- R to (2,4): but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot\n\nSo only possible move: D to (1,3)\n\nMust move down to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 62: move D to (1,4)? No.\n\nTurn 61: moved L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 62: from (1,5), move D to (1,4)\n\nThen at turn 63, from (1,4), only move D to (1,3)\n\nNew head (1,3), direction down.\n\nPositions: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — tail (2,2)\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (1,4): body, occupied\n\n- D to (1,2): but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot\n\n- L to (0,3): wall, cannot\n\n- R to (2,3): (2,3) is body segment, occupied\n\n(2,3) is in positions, body, so occupied.\n\nTherefore, from (1,3), all adjacent cells are blocked: U body, D wall, L wall, R body. Stuck again!\n\nOh, so moving left then down leads to a dead end.\n\nTherefore, from (1,5), we should not move down to (1,4), but move up to (1,6).\n\nAt turn 61, after moving to (1,5), at turn 62, move U to (1,6)\n\nThen new head (1,6), direction up.\n\nPositions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — tail (2,2)\n\nFrom (1,6), possible moves:\n\n- U to (1,7): but y=7 is border wall, cannot\n\n- D to (1,5): body, occupied\n\n- L to (0,6): wall, cannot\n\n- R to (2,6): (2,6) is body segment, occupied\n\nAgain, all blocked! U wall, D body, L wall, R body. Stuck immediately.\n\nSo moving left to (1,5) at turn 61 leads to being stuck whether we go up or down.\n\nTherefore, both initial moves seem problematic.\n\nBut earlier moving right to (3,5) also led to being stuck if we eat (3,4).\n\nBut we don't have to eat (3,4) immediately; at turn 62, from (3,5), we could move elsewhere, but from (3,5), the only possible move was down to (3,4), because other directions were blocked.\n\nIn the first scenario, from (3,5), only D to (3,4) was free, so we had to move there or die, but moving there we die next turn.\n\nSo no good.\n\nPerhaps there is another way.\n\nMaybe I missed a move.\n\nAt turn 61, from (2,5), moves are only L or R, but both lead to dead ends.\n\nBut that can't be right; there must be a way to survive.\n\nPerhaps the food (5,3) can be eaten, but we can't reach it this turn.\n\nOr maybe the snake can move to a cell that will be freed.\n\nFor example, when the tail moves.\n\nAt turn 61, if we move, the tail (3,2) moves away, so (3,2) is freed, but it's not near head.\n\nHead at (2,5), tail at (3,2), far.\n\nAlso, food at (5,2), which is near tail.\n\nBut let's list all possible moves again.\n\nPerhaps from (2,5), moving right to (3,5) is the only way, but we get stuck.\n\nUnless we don't eat the food at (3,4) immediately, but from (3,5), we have to move to (3,4) because no other choice.\n\nBut (3,4) is food, so we eat it, then stuck.\n\nBut if (3,4) were not food, we might not move there, but it is food.\n\nBut we can choose not to eat it if there is another move, but there isn't.\n\nAnother idea: the snake can move into the tail position if the tail moves, but only if it's not eating food on tail with danger.\n\nBut in this case, from (2,5), moving to (3,5) is not tail.\n\nTail is (3,2).\n\nAt turn 61, after move, tail is at (2,2) or something.\n\nLet's think about the grid map.\n\nI should draw a grid.\n\nLet me sketch the grid for y from 7 to 0 top to bottom or bottom to top? Since U is y+1, let's assume y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so U increases y.\n\nSo rows y=7 to y=0 from top to bottom.\n\nBut in list, we can list cells.\n\nLet me list the grid:\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all (0,y) for y=0 to7, (7,y) for y=0 to7, (x,0) for x=0 to7, (x,7) for x=0 to7, plus internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo for example, (2,4) is wall, (1,2) is wall, etc.\n\nFree cells: all others not snake or wall.\n\nSnake at turn 61: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nFood: (5,3), (5,2), (3,4)\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is not snake, not wall, free with food.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2), (3,4).\n\nNow, head at (2,5), can move to (1,5) or (3,5).\n\n(1,5) is free, (3,5) is free.\n\nBut as we saw, from (1,5), it leads to dead end.\n\nFrom (3,5), it leads to (3,4) and dead end.\n\nBut perhaps after moving to (3,5), at turn 62, we can move to (3,4), but then at turn 63, from (3,4), as before, all blocked.\n\nUnless the tail moving frees some space.\n\nAfter eating (3,4) at turn 62, we are at (3,4) with longer snake, and positions as before, all adjacent occupied.\n\nBut in that position, the cell (3,3) is body, but if we don't eat, it might be free later, but we did eat.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 61, if we move to (3,5), we don't have to move down to (3,4) if there is another way, but there isn't; only (3,4) is free.\n\nSo we must move there.\n\nPerhaps the food (5,2) can be reached.\n\nLet's consider going towards (5,2).\n\nFrom (2,5), to reach (5,2), we need to go right and down.\n\nBut moving right to (3,5) is possible, then from there, if we could go to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nAfter turn 61 move to (3,5), (4,5) is still body.\n\nAt turn 62, when we move to (3,4), (4,5) is still there.\n\nBut then stuck.\n\nPerhaps we can go to the food (5,3) but it expires this turn, impossible.\n\nUnless the head is adjacent, but it's not.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (5,3) is under the snake body? But (5,3) is not occupied by snake; snake has (5,4) and (5,5), but not (5,3), so it's free.\n\nBut we can't reach it.\n\nPerhaps at turn 61, we move in a way that allows us to reach (5,2) later.\n\nBut from (2,5), moving left to (1,5) seems worse.\n\nMaybe I missed that from (2,5), after moving, the tail moves, freeing (3,2), but (3,2) is not adjacent.\n\nLet's list the free cells near head.\n\nAt (2,5), adjacent: (1,5) free, (3,5) free, (2,4) wall, (2,6) body.\n\nSo only two choices.\n\nBoth lead to dead ends as per above.\n\nBut that can't be; the snake must have a way to survive.\n\nPerhaps the food at (5,2) is on the tail or something, but no.\n\nTail is at (3,2), food at (5,2).\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail moves away.\n\nFor example, at turn 61, if we move left to (1,5), then positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) and tail (3,2) removed, so (2,2) is tail.\n\nThen at turn 62, from (1,5), we can only move U or D, but both lead to dead ends as before.\n\nIf we move U to (1,6), then from (1,6), all adjacent are wall or body, stuck.\n\nSimilarly for D to (1,4), then to (1,3), stuck.\n\nSo no way.\n\nPerhaps from (2,5), moving right to (3,5), then at turn 62, to (3,4), eat, then at turn 63, from (3,4), as before, no move, but let's see the positions.\n\nAfter turn 62: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\nFrom (3,4):\n\n- U: (3,5) body\n\n- D: (3,3) body\n\n- L: (2,4) wall\n\n- R: (4,4) body\n\nAll blocked, so death.\n\nBut perhaps (3,3) is the tail or something? No, tail is (2,2), (3,3) is body.\n\nIf we could move to (3,3), but it's occupied.\n\nUnless we don't eat the food at (3,4), but from (3,5), we have to move to (3,4) because no other choice.\n\nSo it seems the snake is in a losing position, but that can't be for the problem.\n\nPerhaps I misread the snake positions.\n\nLet's list the snake positions again: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)]\n\nSo the snake is coiled, and head at (2,5) down.\n\nNow, (2,4) is wall, so cannot move down.\n\nLeft (1,5) or right (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is free, but after moving there, (3,6) is body, (2,5) body, (4,5) body, so only (3,4) free, which is food.\n\nBut after eating, we are surrounded.\n\nPerhaps the cell (4,3) or others will be freed later, but not immediately.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 61, if we move to (3,5), and at turn 62 to (3,4), eat, then at turn 63, we are stuck, but if we could move, we can't.\n\nUnless there is a way to not be stuck, but there isn't.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to the tail cell if the tail moves, but in this case, from (3,4), the tail is at (2,2), not adjacent.\n\nAnd tail reward danger only if food on tail and head adjacent.\n\nHere no.\n\nSo I think moving right leads to death in 2 turns.\n\nMoving left leads to death in 2 or 3 turns.\n\nSo both bad.\n\nBut perhaps for moving left, at (1,5), if we move U to (1,6), but (1,6) is cornered.\n\nUnless there is a free cell I missed.\n\nFor example, at (1,5), after moving, the cell (1,4) might be free, but we can move there, but then to (1,3), but (1,3) is not wall, but (1,2) is wall, so (1,3) is free, but from (1,3), only U to (1,4) body, or D to (1,2) wall, or L wall, R to (2,3) body, so stuck.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the snake can go to (3,5) and then instead of eating (3,4), but we have to, no choice.\n\nUnless at turn 62, from (3,5), we can move to a different cell, but only (3,4) is free.\n\nSo I think the only way is to move and then eat the food, but accept death, but the AI should avoid death, so not good.\n\nPerhaps for (3,4), if we eat it, we grow, but then we need to have an escape route, but we don't.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (5,2) might be reachable from the tail area.\n\nFor example, if we move in a way that the head goes towards (5,2).\n\nFrom (2,5), moving left to (1,5), then down to (1,4), but (1,4) to (1,3), then from (1,3), we are stuck, but (2,3) is body, but when we move, the tail moves.\n\nAt turn 61: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 62: move D to (1,4)\n\nThen positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — tail (2,2)\n\nFrom (1,4), only move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 63: move D to (1,3)\n\nHead (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — tail (2,2)\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\n- U: (1,4) body\n\n- D: (1,2) wall, cannot\n\n- L: (0,3) wall, cannot\n\n- R: (2,3) body, occupied\n\nStuck, as before.\n\nBut at this point, the tail is at (2,2), and if we could move right, but (2,3) is body.\n\nHowever, (2,3) is body, but when we don't eat, the tail moves.\n\nAt turn 63, after moving to (1,3), we don't eat food, so the tail (2,2) is removed, so positions become: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — and (2,2) gone, so new tail is (2,3)\n\nPositions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — 14 segments? No.\n\nOriginal length 13, after turn 61 move, no eat, length 13, turn 62 move to (1,4), no eat, so after turn 62, positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — 14 positions? No.\n\nAt turn 61 start: 13 positions.\n\nAfter move to (1,5), no eat, so remove tail (3,2), add head (1,5), so positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) — 13 positions, tail (2,2)\n\nThen turn 62, move to (1,4), no eat, so remove tail (2,2), add head (1,4), positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — tail (2,3)\n\nThen turn 63, move to (1,3), no eat, remove tail (2,3), add head (1,3), positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) — tail (3,3)\n\nNow from head (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (1,4): body, occupied\n\n- D to (1,2): wall, cannot\n\n- L to (0,3): wall, cannot\n\n- R to (2,3): but (2,3) is not in positions? Positions are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nSo (2,3) is not in the list; it was removed as tail.\n\n(2,3) was tail at previous, removed, so (2,3) is free now.\n\nFrom (1,3), R to (2,3) is possible, since (2,3) is free.\n\n(2,3) was body but removed, so now free cell.\n\nYes!\n\nSo at turn 63, from (1,3), we can move right to (2,3)\n\nThen we are not stuck.\n\nSimilarly, in other situations.\n\nSo let's continue.\n\nTurn 63: move R to (2,3)\n\nNew head (2,3), direction right.\n\nPositions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) — tail (3,3)\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,4): but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot\n\n- D to (2,2): is (2,2) free? Not in positions, not wall, so free. (2,2) was previously occupied, but removed, so free.\n\n- L to (1,3): body, occupied\n\n- R to (3,3): body, occupied\n\nSo only possible move: D to (2,2)\n\nMust move down to (2,2)\n\nTurn 64: move D to (2,2)\n\nNew head (2,2), direction down.\n\nPositions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) — tail (3,3)\n\nBut (2,2) is head, and (2,2) was previously occupied, but now head.\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,3): body, occupied\n\n- D to (2,1): is (2,1) free? Not wall, not snake, should be free. Walls: borders y=0, but y=1 is not border, internal obstacles have (5,1), (1,2), but (2,1) not listed, so free.\n\n- L to (1,2): but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot\n\n- R to (3,2): (3,2) not in positions, not wall, free.\n\n(3,2) was earlier, but not now.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2)\n\nNow, we have food at (5,2) and (3,4)\n\n(5,2) must be eaten soon; life span 4 at t=61, so at t=64, life span? Let's track.\n\nAt t=61: (5,2) life span 4\n\nAfter turn 61, if not eaten, at t=62, life span 3\n\nt=63, life span 2\n\nt=64, life span 1\n\nIf not eaten at t=64, it disappears at t=65.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) life span 10 at t=61, so at t=64, life span 7.\n\nAt turn 64, head at (2,2), we can move to (2,1) or (3,2)\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is not far.\n\nFrom (2,2), moving to (3,2) might be better to go right.\n\nOr to (2,1) down.\n\nBut (5,2) is at y=2, x=5.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,4), but we need to eat (5,2) soon.\n\nAt turn 64, if we move to (3,2), then we can go to (4,2) or something.\n\nBut let's plan.\n\nFirst, back to turn 61.\n\nAt turn 61, we should move left to (1,5) to avoid the immediate trap on the right.\n\nThen turn 62, move down to (1,4)\n\nTurn 63, move down to (1,3)\n\nTurn 64, move right to (2,3)? In the sequence above, at turn 63 we moved to (1,3), then to (2,3) at turn 63? Let's clarify the turns.\n\nTurn 61: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 62: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 63: move D to (1,3)  -- at this point, after move, positions as above, tail removed, (2,3) free.\n\nThen from (1,3), we move R to (2,3) at turn 63? Turn 63 action is move to (1,3), then for turn 64, from (1,3), we can move to (2,3).\n\nLet's list actions per turn.\n\nAt turn 61: start, head (2,5), move L to (1,5)\n\nAfter turn 61: head (1,5), no eat, so snake positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)  tail (2,2)\n\nFood: (5,3) gone, so (5,2) and (3,4)\n\nTurn 62: from (1,5), possible moves U or D, we choose D to (1,4)\n\nMove to (1,4), no eat, so new positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)  tail (2,3)  [tail (2,2) removed]\n\nTurn 63: from (1,4), move to (1,3) D\n\nMove to (1,3), no eat, new positions: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)  tail (3,3)  [tail (2,3) removed]\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4) body, D to (1,2) wall, L wall, R to (2,3) free, so only R to (2,3)\n\nTurn 64: move R to (2,3)\n\nNew head (2,3), direction right.\n\nPositions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)  tail (3,3)\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4) wall, D to (2,2) free, L to (1,3) body, R to (3,3) body, so only D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 65: move D to (2,2)\n\nNew head (2,2), direction down.\n\nPositions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)  tail (3,3)\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3) body, D to (2,1) free, L to (1,2) wall, R to (3,2) free.\n\nSo can move D to (2,1) or R to (3,2)\n\nNow, we need to eat (5,2) but at turn 65, (5,2) life span: at t=61 span 4, t=62 span 3, t=63 span 2, t=64 span 1, so at t=64, if not eaten, it disappears at t=65.\n\nAt turn 64, we are at (2,3) or moving to (2,2), not at (5,2), so we didn't eat it at t=64, so (5,2) disappears at t=65.\n\nSo we lost (5,2).\n\nOnly food left is (3,4) with life span 10 at t=61, so at t=65, life span 6? t=61:10, t=62:9, t=63:8, t=64:7, t=65:6, so still time.\n\nAt turn 65, head at (2,2), we can move to (2,1) or (3,2)\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), so moving right to (3,2) might be better.\n\nMove R to (3,2) at turn 65.\n\nThen new head (3,2), direction right.\n\nPositions: head (3,2), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)  tail (3,3)\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,3): body, occupied\n\n- D to (3,1): is (3,1) free? Not wall, not snake, should be free. Internal obstacles (5,1), but not (3,1).\n\n- L to (2,2): body, occupied\n\n- R to (4,2): free? (4,2) not wall, not snake, free.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (3,1) or R to (4,2)\n\nWe can go towards (3,4) by moving up later.\n\nBut (3,4) is at (3,4), so from (3,2), we can move up, but not directly.\n\nFirst, we need to find a path.\n\nSince we have time, we can go to (4,2) then to (4,3), but (4,3) is body? Positions have (4,3), which is body.\n\nBut as we move, the body moves.\n\nFor example, at turn 66, from (3,2), move R to (4,2)\n\nThen new head (4,2), direction right.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)  tail (3,3)\n\nFrom (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,3): body, occupied\n\n- D to (4,1): free? (4,1) not wall, not snake, free\n\n- L to (3,2): body, occupied\n\n- R to (5,2): but (5,2) was food, but it disappeared at t=65, so no food, and not occupied, free.\n\n(5,2) gone, so (5,2) is free cell.\n\nBut no food.\n\nSo can move U to (4,3) body? Occupied, cannot.\n\nD to (4,1) free\n\nR to (5,2) free\n\nL to (3,2) body, cannot.\n\nSo moves: D or R.\n\nIf move R to (5,2), then from there, etc.\n\nBut we want to go to (3,4), which is up.\n\nFrom (4,2), move U not possible.\n\nMove D to (4,1), then not closer.\n\nOr move R to (5,2), then from (5,2), possible moves U to (5,3), but (5,3) gone, or D to (5,1) wall, obstacle, or L to (4,2) body, or R to (6,2), but (6,2) may be free.\n\nBut (6,2) not wall, but internal obstacles (6,4), (6,1), (6,1) is obstacle, so (6,2) free? (6,1) is obstacle, (6,2) not, so free.\n\nBut we are going away from (3,4).\n\nTo reach (3,4), we need to go up from somewhere.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), at turn 65, instead of moving R, move D to (3,1), then from there, but y=1, low, hard to go up.\n\nBut let's think of eating (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), and in the body, (3,3) is near, but occupied.\n\nAs the snake moves, cells free up.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (3,3), so when we move, it may free.\n\nBut to eat (3,4), we need to move to it when free.\n\nAt turn 65, positions have (3,3) as tail, so (3,4) is free.\n\nBut head is at (2,2) or (3,2), not adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,2), (3,4) is two steps up.\n\nBut from (3,2), we can only move D or R, not U.\n\nThen from there, it takes time.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, we can go directly to (3,4) from (2,5) by moving right, but we saw it causes death.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 61, move right to (3,5), then at turn 62, move to (3,4) and eat, but then we are stuck, so we die, score +1, but we can survive longer otherwise.\n\nWith moving left, we can survive and potentially eat (3,4) later.\n\nFor example, from the sequence above, at turn 65, head at (2,2), move to (3,2), then to (4,2), then to (5,2) but food gone, or to (4,1), etc.\n\nThen from (4,2), move R to (5,2) at turn 66.\n\nHead (5,2), direction right.\n\nPositions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)  tail (3,3)\n\nFrom (5,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,3): free, no food\n\n- D to (5,1): wall, obstacle, cannot\n\n- L to (4,2): body, occupied\n\n- R to (6,2): free, not wall\n\nSo moves U or R.\n\nMove U to (5,3), then to (5,4) but occupied, etc.\n\nTo reach (3,4), we can go to (4,3) or something.\n\nBut (4,3) is body.\n\nEventually, as tail moves, it frees, but it might take time.\n\nSince (3,4) has life span 10, at t=61, so at t=65, life span 6, plenty of time.\n\nFor example, from (5,2) move U to (5,3), then to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, occupied.\n\nFrom (5,3), if we can move L to (4,3), but (4,3) body.\n\nSo not directly.\n\nPerhaps we can go to the right and up.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nThe best move at turn 61 is to go left to (1,5), then down to (1,4), then down to (1,3), then right to (2,3), then down to (2,2), then right to (3,2), then to (4,2), then to (5,2) but food gone, or to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut we can then navigate to (3,4).\n\nFor example, at turn 65, head at (2,2), move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 66: from (3,2), move U not possible, so move R to (4,2) or D to (3,1)\n\nSay move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 67: from (4,2), move U not possible, so move R to (5,2) or D to (4,1)\n\nMove R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 68: from (5,2), move U to (5,3) or R to (6,2)\n\nMove U to (5,3)\n\nThen head (5,3), positions: at this point, many cells are freed.\n\nBut (3,4) is still there.\n\nFrom (5,3), move L to (4,3) or U to (5,4) but (5,4) body, or R to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) might be free by then.\n\nThis is getting too far, and we need to eat (3,4).\n\nTo save time, at turn 61, we can move right to (3,5), then to (3,4) at turn 62, eat and die, score +1, but we can survive longer by going left and not eating immediately, so better to go left.\n\nWith going left, we can survive and later eat (3,4).\n\nFor example, from the path, at some point, we can reach (3,4).\n\nLet's assume we go left and down as before.\n\nAt turn 64, head at (2,3), we move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 65: at (2,2), move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 66: at (3,2), move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 67: at (4,2), move U not possible, so move R to (5,2) or D to (4,1)\n\nMove to (5,2) if free, but no food.\n\nThen from (5,2), move U to (5,3)\n\nTurn 68: head (5,3), then move L to (4,3) or U to (5,4) but (5,4) body, so move L to (4,3) if free.\n\nAt this point, the body has moved, so (4,3) might be free.\n\nFor example, at turn 68, positions depend on previous moves.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nNotice that (3,4) is at (3,4), and from the snake, when the tail moves, (3,3) is freed.\n\nFrom head position, we can go to (3,4) directly if possible.\n\nFor instance, from (3,2), at turn 65, if we could move up, but we can't.\n\nAt turn 64, head at (2,3), we moved D to (2,2), but from (2,3), we had to move D because U wall, R body, L body, only D.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nPerhaps at turn 63, from (1,3), instead of moving R to (2,3), but we had to, only choice.\n\nSo the path is fixed for the first few moves.\n\nThen at turn 65, head at (2,2), we can move to (3,2), then at turn 66, from (3,2), move to (4,2), then turn 67 from (4,2), move to (5,2) or (4,1).\n\nSay move to (4,1) D.\n\nThen head (4,1), direction down.\n\nPositions: head (4,1), body (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)  tail (3,3)\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,2): body, occupied\n\n- D to (4,0): wall, y=0, cannot\n\n- L to (3,1): free? (3,1) not wall, not snake, free\n\n- R to (5,1): wall, obstacle, cannot\n\nSo move L to (3,1)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo reach (3,4), we need to go up.\n\nFrom (3,1), move U to (3,2), but (3,2) may be body or free.\n\nIt's taking too many turns, and (3,4) might be eaten later.\n\nBut for the initial move, since we must choose, and to maximize score, going left allows survival to eat (3,4) later, while going right gives immediate score but death.\n\nSo for long-term, go left.\n\nMoreover, with the food (5,2), we can try to eat it, but with the path, we couldn't in time.\n\nAt turn 61, if we move right to (3,5), then at turn 62 to (3,4), eat, score +1, but then die at turn 63.\n\nIf we move left, we survive, and can eat (3,4) later for +1, so better.\n\nAlso, there might be other food, but only one left.\n\nSo I think for turn 61, move left.\n\nThen for the answer, we need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nt1=61.\n\nSo let's plan the actions.\n\nTurn 61: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 62: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 63: move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 64: move R to (2,3)  -- from (1,3) to (2,3)\n\nTurn 65: from (2,3) move D to (2,2)\n\nThen from (2,2), at turn 65, we can move R to (3,2) or D to (2,1)\n\nSay move R to (3,2) to go towards center.\n\nTurn 65: move R to (3,2)\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 65, from (2,3) move to (2,2), then turn 66 from (2,2) move to (3,2), etc.\n\nFor the answer, we can output up to 5 turns.\n\nTurn 61: L\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: D\n\nTurn 64: R (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 65: D (to (2,2))\n\nThen turn 66: from (2,2) move to (3,2) R, but not in the 5 turns.\n\nSince the food (3,4) is available, we can head towards it after freeing space.\n\nBut for now, this sequence allows survival.\n\nSo I think this is the way to go.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 61\\), the snake is in a constrained position with limited immediate moves due to walls and body segments. The key priorities are to avoid immediate death and plan for long-term survival to maximize score by eating the positive food at (3,4) with a life span of 10, while the food at (5,3) (life span 1) is unreachable this turn and will disappear, and the food at (5,2) (life span 4) may not be reachable before it expires due to the snake's position and path constraints.\n\n### Analysis of Current State:\n- **Head Position and Direction**: Snake head is at (2,5) moving down (D). Possible moves from (2,5) are left (L) to (1,5) or right (R) to (3,5). Moving down is blocked by the wall at (2,4), and up is the reverse direction (not allowed).\n- **Risks**:\n  - Moving right to (3,5) forces a move to (3,4) on the next turn to eat the food there, but this results in immediate death as all adjacent cells are blocked after eating (body segments or walls).\n  - Moving left to (1,5) avoids this trap and opens a path for survival, though it requires navigating a narrow corridor initially.\n- **Food Considerations**:\n  - (5,3) (value 1, life span 1): Cannot be eaten this turn (not adjacent to head), so it will disappear after turn 61. Ignore.\n  - (5,2) (value 1, life span 4): Must be eaten by turn 64 to avoid disappearance, but the snake's path after moving left makes it infeasible to reach in time with safe moves. Prioritizing survival over this food is better.\n  - (3,4) (value 1, life span 10): Ample time to reach (e.g., by turn 66-68). This should be the primary target after gaining maneuvering room.\n- **Survival Strategy**: \n  - Move left to (1,5) at turn 61 to avoid the death trap on the right. This leads to a sequence where the snake can safely navigate downward and rightward, freeing space as the tail moves.\n  - After reaching (2,2) by turn 65, the snake can head toward (3,4) for a safe eat around turn 67 or later.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**:\n  - Turns 61-65: Execute a sequence to survive and reposition: L → D → D → R → D. This avoids dead ends and ensures the tail moves to free space.\n  - Beyond turn 65: Head toward (3,4) via (3,2) and (4,2), eating it around turn 67 for +1 score. Full pathing is feasible with no immediate risks.\n\n### Action Plan (Turns 61 to 65):\nThe sequence below ensures survival for at least 5 turns, avoids all collisions, and sets up for eating (3,4) in the near future. Actions are chosen based on grid constraints and no-reverse rule.\n\n- **Turn 61**: Move L (left) to (1,5).  \n  - Reason: Avoids the forced move to (3,4) and death. (1,5) is free, and moving left is valid from current direction (D).\n- **Turn 62**: Move D (down) to (1,4).  \n  - Reason: Only safe move from (1,5) (up to (1,6) leads to immediate death; down is free and gains space).\n- **Turn 63**: Move D (down) to (1,3).  \n  - Reason: Only safe move from (1,4) (right blocked by wall at (2,4); down to (1,3) is free).\n- **Turn 64**: Move R (right) to (2,3).  \n  - Reason: From (1,3), right to (2,3) is now free (tail moved, freeing (2,3)). This starts the turn toward the center.\n- **Turn 65**: Move D (down) to (2,2).  \n  - Reason: From (2,3), down to (2,2) is free and safe (left to (1,3) is body; up to (2,4) is wall; right to (3,3) is body).\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- By turn 65, the snake is at (2,2) with no food eaten yet, but (3,4) is still available (life span 6 remaining at turn 65). The path is clear to continue to (3,2) and then toward (3,4) for eating.\n- Score: 0 so far, but +1 expected soon with low risk.\n- Survival: This sequence avoids all walls and body collisions, ensuring the snake lives beyond 5 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 61: L (left)  \nTurn 62: D (down)  \nTurn 63: D (down)  \nTurn 64: R (right)  \nTurn 65: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 62, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are defined by borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There are also internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So, I must avoid these cells.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (1,5), and the body segments follow: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2). The head direction is left (L), meaning it's moving towards decreasing x.\n\nFood: There are two pieces:\n\n- At (5,2) with life span 4 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- At (3,4) with life span 9 and value 1 (also positive food)\n\nBoth are positive, so eating them increases length by 1 and score by 1. But I need to consider the life span; (5,2) disappears after 4 turns, including this one, so it will be gone by turn 65? Let's calculate: life span 4 at turn 62 means it disappears after turn 65? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so:\n\n- Turn 62: life span 4\n\n- Turn 63: life span 3\n\n- Turn 64: life span 2\n\n- Turn 65: life span 1\n\n- Turn 66: gone? No, the food disappears after N turns, meaning when life span reaches 0. So:\n\n- At turn t, life span is N.\n\n- After each turn, life span decreases by 1.\n\n- So, at turn t + N, life span becomes 0, and it disappears before the next turn or something. I think it's better to think: if life span is L at turn t, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears after turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, for food at (5,2) with life span 4 at turn 62:\n\n- Turn 62: life span 4\n\n- Turn 63: life span 3\n\n- Turn 64: life span 2\n\n- Turn 65: life span 1\n\n- Turn 66: life span 0, so it disappears before turn 66 or at the start of turn 66? I think it disappears at the end of the turn when life span reaches 0, so it can be eaten only if life span >0.\n\nTypically in such games, food is present until the countdown reaches 0, and it's removed before the next turn. So for eating, it must be eaten when life span >=1.\n\nSimilarly for (3,4): life span 9 at turn 62, so it will last until turn 62 + 8 = 70? Let's not worry about exact turn yet.\n\nNow, snake head at (1,5), moving left. Current direction is L, so possible moves: since no instant reverse, I cannot move right (opposite of left). So I can move Up, Down, or Left, but Left might be blocked or something.\n\nFirst, let's list the current grid state to visualize.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (1,5)\n\nBody: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\nTail is at (2,2).\n\nFood at (5,2) and (3,4).\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the answer format should be for turn t1=62, then 63, 64, etc., up to how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output should list actions starting from turn 62. I think I need to output actions for the next few turns, but since it's a sequence, I should plan a path.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\" so I need to specify actions for turn 62, 63, 64, etc. But how many? It doesn't specify, but since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should output at least 5 actions? But the state might change after each action, so I need to simulate step by step.\n\nActually, when I output an action for turn 62, the state changes for turn 63, so I should only output for turn 62 first? But the format shows multiple turns. Perhaps I need to plan a sequence based on current state, but since food life span and snake movement affect future, I need to consider the plan.\n\nI think for the answer, I should output a sequence of actions starting from turn 62, for as many as I can reasonably plan, but at least for 5 turns to show the foresight.\n\nBut let's first focus on the immediate move.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,5), direction L, so moving left.\n\nPossible moves from (1,5): U (up, to (1,6)), D (down, to (1,4)), L (left, to (0,5)), but x=0 is wall, so L is invalid because (0,5) is wall.\n\nx=0 is border wall, so cannot move left to (0,5).\n\nR (right, to (2,5)), but (2,5) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: (2,5) is the first body segment.\n\nNow, about collision: moving to a body segment is deadly, except for the tail, because when the snake moves, the tail also moves, so if I move to the current tail position, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nIn this case, from (1,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,6) – is this free? (1,6) – let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells: snake positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n\nSo (1,6) is not in this list, and not a wall, so it should be free.\n\ny=6 is within 0 to 7, x=1 within 0 to 7, and no internal obstacle at (1,6), obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (1,6) is clear.\n\nD: to (1,4) – (1,4) not in snake positions, not wall, obstacles? (1,2) is obstacle but (1,4) is different, so should be free.\n\nL: to (0,5) – x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR: to (2,5) – (2,5) is occupied by snake body, and it's not the tail; tail is (2,2). (2,5) is the second segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nTherefore, from (1,5), possible moves: U to (1,6) or D to (1,4). Cannot go L or R.\n\nNow, current direction is L, but since L is invalid, I have to choose U or D.\n\nBut no instant reverse isn't an issue here because I'm not moving opposite, since L is invalid, I'm turning to U or D.\n\nNow, I need to think about the food and long-term survival.\n\nFood at (5,2) and (3,4).\n\n(5,2) has short life span, only 4 turns, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\n(3,4) has longer life span, 9 turns.\n\nAlso, (3,4) is closer? Let's see distances.\n\nFrom head (1,5) to (3,4): delta x = 2, delta y = -1, so Manhattan distance |2| + |-1| = 3.\n\nTo (5,2): delta x = 4, delta y = -3, distance |4| + |-3| = 7.\n\nSo (3,4) is closer.\n\nBut there might be obstacles or snake body in the way.\n\nFirst, let's consider the grid around.\n\nI should map out the grid.\n\nLet me sketch a grid:\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, bottom to top or top to bottom? Usually in coordinates, y=0 is bottom, but in programming, often y=0 is top. Here it doesn't specify, but since walls are given, I can use coordinates as is.\n\nAssume (0,0) bottom left, (7,7) top right? Or (0,0) top left? In the context, it might not matter, but let's list positions.\n\nSnake head at (1,5), so let's think y=5 is row 5, x=1 col 1.\n\nPerhaps I can list cells:\n\nFor y from 0 to 7, x from 0 to 7.\n\nBut to save time, focus on relevant area.\n\nHead at (1,5).\n\nFood at (3,4) and (5,2).\n\nAlso, tail at (2,2).\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,5): U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), what happens?\n\nNew head position: (1,6)\n\nThen snake moves: head to (1,6), then body segments: the previous head (1,5) becomes new body, so snake becomes: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)] but when snake moves, the tail moves away, so the last segment is removed.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail position is vacated unless it grows.\n\nSince no food eaten, length doesn't change, so tail moves away.\n\nSo after move U to (1,6):\n\n- New head: (1,6)\n\n- Body: (1,5) (which was head), then (2,5), (2,6), etc., up to (2,3), and tail was (2,2), so (2,2) is left, and tail moves to (2,3)? Let's index.\n\nSnake positions before move: index 0: head (1,5), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (4,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (5,4), 8: (4,4), 9: (4,3), 10: (3,3), 11: (2,3), 12: tail (2,2)\n\nAfter move to (1,6):\n\n- New head: (1,6)\n\n- Then segment 1 moves to old head position (1,5)? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head moves to new cell, then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo:\n\n- New position 0: (1,6)  // new head\n\n- Position 1: old position 0, which is (1,5)\n\n- Position 2: old position 1, which is (2,5)\n\n- Position 3: old position 2, which is (2,6)\n\n- Position 4: old position 3, (3,6)\n\n- Position 5: old position 4, (4,6)\n\n- Position 6: old position 5, (4,5)\n\n- Position 7: old position 6, (5,5)\n\n- Position 8: old position 7, (5,4)\n\n- Position 9: old position 8, (4,4)\n\n- Position 10: old position 9, (4,3)\n\n- Position 11: old position 10, (3,3)\n\n- Position 12: old position 11, (2,3)\n\nAnd old tail (2,2) is no longer part of snake, so vacated.\n\nSo snake now: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)]\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\nNow, if I go D to (1,4) from (1,5):\n\nNew head: (1,4)\n\nThen snake: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)] but tail moves: after move, positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), etc., up to (2,3), and tail was (2,2), so (2,2) vacated, tail now at (2,3)? Similar to above.\n\nIn both cases, the tail moves to (2,3) from (2,2).\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nFrom (1,5), if I go U to (1,6), I am at (1,6).\n\nIf I go D to (1,4), at (1,4).\n\nNow, I need to get to food.\n\nFirst, food at (3,4): which is at x=3,y=4.\n\nFrom (1,6): to (3,4), I need to go down and right, but there might be body.\n\nFrom (1,4): closer to (3,4), since same y=4, but x from 1 to 3, so I can go right.\n\nBut let's see what's at (2,4): (2,4) is an internal obstacle! Obstacles include (2,4), so (2,4) is wall, cannot go there.\n\nAlso, (1,4) to (3,4) directly not possible because (2,4) is obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,5), if I go to (1,4), then from there, I can go to (1,3) or (1,5) but (1,5) is now body, or (0,4) but x=0 wall, or (2,4) but obstacle, so from (1,4), possible moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3), L to (0,4) invalid, R to (2,4) invalid, so only U or D.\n\nBut U to (1,5) is the body segment, which might be occupied, but after moving to (1,4), (1,5) is the second segment, so moving to it would collide, unless it's the tail, but it's not.\n\nAfter moving to (1,4), snake positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), which is body, so (1,5) is occupied, cannot go back.\n\nSimilarly, D to (1,3) might be free.\n\nLet's not get ahead; first for turn 62.\n\nI need to think about accessing the food.\n\nFood at (3,4): to reach it, I need to go to (3,4), but (2,4) is obstacle, so I cannot approach from left or right directly? (3,4) is at x=3,y=4.\n\nCells around (3,4): (3,5) above, (3,3) below, (4,4) right, (2,4) left but (2,4) is obstacle, so only (3,5), (3,3), (4,4) are possible approaches.\n\n(4,4) is currently occupied by the snake? Snake positions: (4,4) is part of body, at index 8 or something, not free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is also snake body, (3,5) is not in snake positions, let's check.\n\n(3,5): not in snake list: snake has (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), etc., no (3,5), so (3,5) is free? But is it wall or obstacle? Walls: borders and internal obstacles, (3,5) not border, internal obstacles (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (3,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is snake, occupied.\n\n(4,4) snake occupied.\n\nSo to reach (3,4), I need to be at (3,5), (3,3), or (4,4), but (4,4) is occupied and will move, but I need to move head to (3,4) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, (3,4) has food, so if I move head to (3,4), I can eat it, but how to get there?\n\nFrom (3,5) down to (3,4), or from (3,3) up to (3,4), or from (4,4) left to (3,4), but (4,4) is occupied.\n\nNow, (3,5) is free, so I can go to (3,5) first, then down to (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is occupied now, but it might move.\n\nFor food at (5,2): (5,2) is at x=5,y=2.\n\nCells around: (5,3), (5,1), (4,2), (6,2) but (6,2) might be wall or something? x=6 not border, but internal obstacle (6,4) and (6,1), (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,2) is not listed, so should be free? Internal obstacles are specific points, not whole rows.\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (6,2) is not obstacle, not border, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) not occupied, (5,1) obstacle, so cannot go there, (4,2) not occupied.\n\nBut to reach (5,2), I can come from (5,3), (4,2), or (6,2), or (5,1) but obstacle.\n\nNow, back to turn 62 choices.\n\nFrom (1,5), I can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), I am at top row y=6, close to border.\n\nFrom (1,6), I can go U to (1,7) but y=7 is wall, so cannot. Or D to (1,5), but (1,5) is now body, occupied. Or L to (0,6) wall. Or R to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is currently occupied? Before move, (2,6) is body, but after move to (1,6), the snake is at (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), etc., so (2,6) is position 3, occupied, so from (1,6), possible moves: U invalid, D to (1,5) but occupied, L invalid, R to (2,6) occupied, so no valid moves? That can't be right.\n\nAfter moving to (1,6), the cell (1,5) is occupied by the second segment, so moving back to (1,5) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is occupied by the fourth segment? Positions after move U:\n\n- Head: (1,6)\n\n- Seg1: (1,5)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (2,5)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (2,6)  // old seg2\n\n- Etc.\n\nSo (1,5) is occupied by seg1, so from head at (1,6), moving to (1,5) is illegal, collision.\n\nMoving to (1,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nMoving to (0,6): x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nMoving to (2,6): (2,6) is occupied by seg3, so also collision.\n\nTherefore, if I go to (1,6), I am trapped and die on the next turn because no valid moves. So going U to (1,6) is suicidal.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nBut (1,6) is at y=6, and y=7 is wall, so from (1,6), adjacent cells: (1,7) wall, (1,5) occupied, (0,6) wall, (2,6) occupied. Yes, all adjacent cells are either wall or occupied, so no escape. Therefore, moving U to (1,6) is immediately bad, as I die on turn 63.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go U; it's invalid in practice because it leads to death.\n\nSo for turn 62, moving U is not an option.\n\nThen, the only choice is to go D to (1,4).\n\nFrom (1,5) down to (1,4).\n\nNow, (1,4) is free, as we thought earlier.\n\nSo action for turn 62: D (down)\n\nNow, after move, head at (1,4), direction now D, since I moved down.\n\nSnake positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), and tail at (2,2) is gone, so positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)] with tail at (2,3).\n\nNow, turn 63.\n\nHead at (1,4), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,5), but (1,5) is now the second segment, occupied, cannot move there.\n\nD to (1,3), which is free? (1,3) not in snake positions, not wall, obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) is different, so should be free.\n\nL to (0,4) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,4), but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move: D to (1,3).\n\nAction for turn 63: D (down)\n\nNow, move to (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is above (1,2) which is obstacle, but (1,3) itself is not obstacle.\n\nAfter move, head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nSnake positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), and tail was (2,3), now moved? Old tail (2,3) vacated.\n\nPositions: new head (1,3), seg1 old head (1,4), seg2 old seg1 (1,5), seg3 old seg2 (2,5), seg4 old seg3 (2,6), ..., up to old position 11: (2,3) was old tail, but since no growth, it is removed, so snake has 13 segments? Original snake had 13 positions: from (1,5) to (2,2), 13 cells.\n\nAfter first move to (1,4), we had 13 positions but tail moved, so still 13? Positions: 13 segments including head.\n\nInitially: 13 positions.\n\nAfter move, when no food, length same, so still 13 positions, but the tail cell changes.\n\nAfter turn 62 move to (1,4): positions: head (1,4), then 12 body segments: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — that's 12 after head? Head + 12 body = 13.\n\nAfter turn 63 move to (1,3): new head (1,3), then seg1: old head (1,4), seg2: old seg1 (1,5), ..., seg12: old seg11 (2,3)? Let's list:\n\nOld positions before turn 63: index 0: (1,4), 1: (1,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (4,6), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,4), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,3), 11: (3,3), 12: (2,3)\n\nAfter move to (1,3):\n\n- New head: (1,3)\n\n- New pos1: old pos0 = (1,4)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1 = (1,5)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2 = (2,5)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3 = (2,6)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4 = (3,6)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5 = (4,6)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6 = (4,5)\n\n- New pos8: old pos7 = (5,5)\n\n- New pos9: old pos8 = (5,4)\n\n- New pos10: old pos9 = (4,4)\n\n- New pos11: old pos10 = (4,3)\n\n- New pos12: old pos11 = (3,3)  // new tail\n\nOld pos12 (2,3) is vacated.\n\nSo snake now: head (1,3), tail at (3,3)\n\nNow, head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,4), but (1,4) is now the first body segment, occupied, cannot.\n\nD to (1,2), but (1,2) is internal obstacle! Obstacles include (1,2), so cannot move there.\n\nL to (0,3) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,3), but (2,3) is not occupied? Currently, after move, (2,3) is vacated, and it's not wall. (2,3) is not an obstacle; obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (2,3) is free.\n\nIn the snake positions above, (2,3) is vacated, so it should be free.\n\nBut is (2,3) adjacent? Head at (1,3), so (2,3) is to the right.\n\nAnd (2,3) is not occupied now, since tail is at (3,3).\n\nIn the new positions, (2,3) is not part of snake, and not wall, so yes, I can move R to (2,3).\n\nAlso, D to (1,2) is invalid because obstacle.\n\nU to (1,4) occupied.\n\nL invalid.\n\nSo only possible move: R to (2,3)\n\nAction for turn 63: R (right)\n\nNow, direction was D, but I move right, so new direction R.\n\nNow turn 64.\n\nHead at (2,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4), but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nD to (2,2), which is free? (2,2) not in current snake positions. Current snake: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), tail (3,3)? Positions: head (2,3), seg1: (1,3), seg2: (1,4), ..., up to seg12: (3,3) — (3,3) is the tail.\n\n(2,2) not occupied, not wall, obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\nL to (1,3), but (1,3) is now body segment (seg1), occupied, cannot.\n\nR to (3,3), but (3,3) is the current tail? (3,3) is position of tail.\n\nRule: can move to tail position because tail will move away.\n\nSo moving to (3,3) is allowed, and since it's the tail, no collision.\n\nAlso, D to (2,2) is possible.\n\nU invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nNow, if I go R to (3,3), that is the tail, and I move there, since no food, the tail moves, so I don't grow, and it should be safe.\n\nBut (3,3) has no food, so just moving to it.\n\nIf I go D to (2,2), also no food.\n\nNow, I need to think about food.\n\nFood at (3,4) and (5,2).\n\n(3,4) is close; from (2,3), I can go to (3,3) which is tail, then from there to (3,4) if possible.\n\n(3,4) has food, so if I go to (3,4), I eat it.\n\nBut to go to (3,4) from (2,3), I need to move right to (3,3) first? (2,3) to (3,4) is diagonal, not adjacent; must move to adjacent cell.\n\nAdjacent to (3,4) are (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4)\n\n(2,4) obstacle, (4,4) occupied by snake, (3,5) free, (3,3) currently tail.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (3,3) which is tail, then from (3,3) I can go to (3,4) if I move up.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (2,2) first.\n\nBut let's see the life span.\n\nTurn 64, food at (5,2) life span: at turn 62, life span 4, so turn 63:3, turn 64:2, so still present.\n\n(3,4) life span 9 at turn 62, turn 64:7, plenty.\n\nBut (5,2) will disappear soon, after 2 more turns? Turn 64 life span 2, so after turn 64, it becomes 1, then turn 65 life span 1, turn 66 life span 0, gone. So can be eaten on turn 64 or 65.\n\nNow, from current position (2,3), if I go to (3,3), then to (3,4) to eat food.\n\n(3,4) is food, so if I move to (3,4), I eat it.\n\nBut from (2,3), I need to be at (3,3) or (3,5) or etc. to reach (3,4).\n\nFirst, for turn 64, I need to decide.\n\nOption 1: go R to (3,3)\n\nThen head at (3,3), but (3,3) is the current tail, so when I move there, since it's tail, and I don't eat food (no food there), the tail moves, so the snake grows? No, moving to tail without food: since no food, the tail moves away, so the head takes the position, and the tail is removed, so length same.\n\nBut (3,3) has no food, so no growth.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go to (3,4) which has food.\n\n(3,4) is adjacent up from (3,3).\n\nBut (3,4) has food, so if I go to (3,4), I eat it, grow by one.\n\nBut I need to check if moving to (3,4) is safe.\n\nFirst, let's simulate.\n\nTurn 64: move R to (3,3)\n\nSince moving to tail, and no food, it should be ok.\n\nAfter move, new head at (3,3)\n\nOld head was (2,3), now new head (3,3)\n\nThen body: seg1: old head position (2,3)? Old positions before turn 64: head (2,3), seg1 (1,3), seg2 (1,4), seg3 (1,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (3,6), seg7 (4,6), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (5,5), seg10 (5,4), seg11 (4,4), seg12 (4,3)? Let's list properly.\n\nBefore turn 64, after turn 63: positions: head (2,3), then seg1 (1,3), seg2 (1,4), seg3 (1,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (3,6), seg7 (4,6), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (5,5), seg10 (5,4), seg11 (4,4), seg12 (4,3)  // tail at (4,3)\n\nIn my earlier, after turn 63 move to (1,3), then to (2,3), I have head (2,3), and tail is (3,3)? No.\n\nAfter turn 63: positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)] with tail at (4,3)\n\nI think I missed.\n\nAfter turn 62: head (1,4), body: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)  // tail (2,3)\n\nAfter turn 63 move to (1,3): new head (1,3), then seg1 old head (1,4), seg2 old seg1 (1,5), seg3 old seg2 (2,5), seg4 old seg3 (2,6), seg5 old seg4 (3,6), seg6 old seg5 (4,6), seg7 old seg6 (4,5), seg8 old seg7 (5,5), seg9 old seg8 (5,4), seg10 old seg9 (4,4), seg11 old seg10 (4,3), seg12 old seg11 (3,3)  // old seg11 was (4,3)? Let's index old positions.\n\nOld before turn 63 move: index 0: (1,4), 1: (1,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (4,6), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,4), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,3), 11: (3,3), 12: (2,3)\n\nAfter move to (1,3):\n\n- New pos0: (1,3)  // new head\n\n- New pos1: old pos0 = (1,4)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1 = (1,5)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2 = (2,5)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3 = (2,6)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4 = (3,6)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5 = (4,6)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6 = (4,5)\n\n- New pos8: old pos7 = (5,5)\n\n- New pos9: old pos8 = (5,4)\n\n- New pos10: old pos9 = (4,4)\n\n- New pos11: old pos10 = (4,3)\n\n- New pos12: old pos11 = (3,3)  // new tail, since old pos12 (2,3) is gone.\n\nSo tail at (3,3)\n\nFor turn 64, head at (1,3)? No, after turn 63, head is at (1,3), but in turn 64, we are moving from (2,3)? I think I confused the turns.\n\nTurn 63: we moved to (1,3), so at start of turn 64, head is at (1,3)? Let's clarify the turn numbering.\n\nTurn t1=62: we decided to move D to (1,4)\n\nThen for turn 63: from new position (1,4), we moved D to (1,3)\n\nSo at the beginning of turn 64, the head is at (1,3), and we need to choose action for turn 64.\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves: as before, U to (1,4) occupied, D to (1,2) obstacle, L wall, R to (2,3) free, so we move R to (2,3)\n\nSo for turn 64, action R to (2,3)\n\nAfter this move, head at (2,3), and the position (2,3) was previously occupied? Before move, (2,3) was not in the snake positions; in the list, (2,3) was old tail but vacated after previous moves.\n\nAfter turn 63 move to (1,3), positions include (3,3) as tail, (2,3) is free.\n\nMoving to (2,3) is fine.\n\nAfter move to (2,3), new head (2,3), then seg1: old head (1,3), seg2: (1,4), seg3: (1,5), seg4: (2,5), seg5: (2,6), seg6: (3,6), seg7: (4,6), seg8: (4,5), seg9: (5,5), seg10: (5,4), seg11: (4,4), seg12: (4,3), and tail at (3,3) is gone, new tail at (4,3)? Old positions before turn 64 move: index 0: (1,3), 1: (1,4), 2: (1,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (4,5), 8: (5,5), 9: (5,4), 10: (4,4), 11: (4,3), 12: (3,3)\n\nAfter move to (2,3):\n\n- New pos0: (2,3)  // new head\n\n- New pos1: old pos0 = (1,3)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1 = (1,4)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2 = (1,5)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3 = (2,5)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4 = (2,6)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5 = (3,6)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6 = (4,6)\n\n- New pos8: old pos7 = (4,5)\n\n- New pos9: old pos8 = (5,5)\n\n- New pos10: old pos9 = (5,4)\n\n- New pos11: old pos10 = (4,4)\n\n- New pos12: old pos11 = (4,3)  // new tail\n\nOld pos12 (3,3) is vacated.\n\nSo now head at (2,3), tail at (4,3)\n\nDirection from turn 63 was D, but we moved R, so new direction R.\n\nFor turn 65, head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nD to (2,2) free, as we said.\n\nL to (1,3) but (1,3) is now body (new pos1), occupied, cannot.\n\nR to (3,3) which is free now, since vacated.\n\n(3,3) was vacated, so free.\n\nSo moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nNow, to reach food.\n\nIf I go R to (3,3), then from there, I can go U to (3,4) to eat the food at (3,4).\n\n(3,4) has food, so moving to (3,4) eats it.\n\nBut I need to make sure that when I move to (3,4), it is safe.\n\nAlso, there is the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, food is at (3,4), not on tail.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, from (2,3), if I go to (3,3), then turn 65: move to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 66: from (3,3) move U to (3,4) to eat food.\n\nBut on turn 66, the food at (5,2) might be gone; life span.\n\nTurn 64: food at (5,2) life span: at turn 62:4, turn 63:3, turn 64:2, turn 65:1, turn 66:0 gone. So on turn 65, it can be eaten, but on turn 66, gone.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) has longer life.\n\nBut let's plan to eat (3,4) first.\n\nFrom current position for turn 65, if I go to (3,3), then next turn to (3,4).\n\nBut I also have the option to go to (2,2) first.\n\n(2,2) is free, and from there I can go to (2,1) or (3,2) or (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, or (2,3) occupied.\n\nBut (2,2) is near the bottom.\n\nBut food at (5,2) is at y=2, so I could go towards it.\n\nBut with short life, I might not reach in time.\n\nDistance from (2,3) to (5,2): |2-5| + |3-2| = 3+1=4, and I have only until turn 65 to eat it, but turn 65 action, so I need to reach by turn 65.\n\nTurn 65 is the next turn.\n\nFrom (2,3), on turn 65, I can move to (3,3) or (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,3), I am at (3,3), then to (5,2) is not adjacent.\n\nIf I go to (2,2), then on turn 66, from (2,2) I can go to (3,2) or (2,1), but (2,1) might be free, or (1,2) obstacle.\n\n(3,2) not occupied, etc.\n\nBut to reach (5,2) by turn 65, I need to be at (5,2) on turn 65 action, but from (2,3), it's too far; minimum 3 moves away, so I can't reach (5,2) by turn 65.\n\nFor example, from (2,3) turn 65: to (3,3) or (2,2)\n\nThen turn 66: from (3,3) to (3,4) or (4,3) or (3,2), etc., not to (5,2)\n\nFrom (2,2) to (3,2) or (2,1), still not close.\n\nSo impossible to eat (5,2) before it disappears. It can be eaten on turn 65 if I am there, but I can't reach from here in one move.\n\nTherefore, I should ignore (5,2) and focus on (3,4).\n\nSo for turn 65, from (2,3), I should go to (3,3) to position for eating (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 66, go to (3,4) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 66, (5,2) is gone, so no issue.\n\nNow, for turn 64, we have action R to (2,3), which we did.\n\nTurn 64 action is R to (2,3), as per earlier.\n\nThen turn 65: from (2,3) move R to (3,3)\n\nAction: R\n\nThen after move, head at (3,3), direction R.\n\nSnake: new head (3,3), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (1,3), etc.\n\nThen turn 66: from (3,3), move U to (3,4) to eat food.\n\n(3,4) has food, so I eat it, grow by one.\n\nNow, is it safe to move to (3,4)? Cells around (3,4): (3,3) is current position, (3,5) above, (2,4) obstacle, (4,4) right.\n\n(3,5) is free, (4,4) is occupied? Current snake positions before move to (3,3): head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail at (4,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,3): new head (3,3), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (1,3), seg3 (1,4), seg4 (1,5), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (2,6), seg7 (3,6), seg8 (4,6), seg9 (4,5), seg10 (5,5), seg11 (5,4), seg12 (4,4), and tail at (4,3) is gone, new tail at (4,4)? Old positions: index 0: (2,3), 1: (1,3), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (2,6), 6: (3,6), 7: (4,6), 8: (4,5), 9: (5,5), 10: (5,4), 11: (4,4), 12: (4,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,3):\n\n- New pos0: (3,3)\n\n- New pos1: old pos0 = (2,3)\n\n- New pos2: old pos1 = (1,3)\n\n- New pos3: old pos2 = (1,4)\n\n- New pos4: old pos3 = (1,5)\n\n- New pos5: old pos4 = (2,5)\n\n- New pos6: old pos5 = (2,6)\n\n- New pos7: old pos6 = (3,6)\n\n- New pos8: old pos7 = (4,6)\n\n- New pos9: old pos8 = (4,5)\n\n- New pos10: old pos9 = (5,5)\n\n- New pos11: old pos10 = (5,4)\n\n- New pos12: old pos11 = (4,4)  // new tail\n\nSo tail at (4,4)\n\nNow, from (3,3), move U to (3,4) for turn 66.\n\n(3,4) is free? Yes, no snake or wall there.\n\nMove to (3,4), since food there, I eat it, so snake grows: head to (3,4), and the tail does not move, so new segment added.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head at (3,4), then the body: previous head (3,3) becomes new segment, so the tail stays.\n\nSnake: new head (3,4), then new pos1: old head (3,3), then new pos2: old seg1 (2,3), new pos3: old seg2 (1,3), ..., up to new pos13: old seg12 (4,4) since we added a segment.\n\nLength increases by one.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we have actions up to turn 66.\n\nBut we need to output from turn 62.\n\nAlso, for turn 62, we have D.\n\nTurn 63: D\n\nTurn 64: R (to (2,3))\n\nThen turn 65: from (2,3) to (3,3), action R\n\nTurn 66: from (3,3) to (3,4), action U\n\nNow, we should think beyond to ensure survival.\n\nAfter eating at (3,4), head at (3,4), direction U (since moved up).\n\nNow, possible moves: to (3,5), (2,4), (4,4), but (2,4) obstacle, (4,4) is now body segment, since it was tail but after growth, it is part of body.\n\nAfter growth, positions: head (3,4), body: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)  // 14 segments.\n\n(4,4) is occupied.\n\nSo from (3,4), moves: U to (3,5), which should be free; D to (3,3) occupied; L to (2,4) obstacle; R to (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo only possible move U to (3,5).\n\nAction U.\n\nThen continue, but we can stop here for the plan.\n\nNow, about the initial turns: for turn 62, we must move D, as U is suicidal.\n\nThen turn 63: only D possible.\n\nTurn 64: only R possible.\n\nTurn 65: we have choice, but we chose R to (3,3) to prepare for food.\n\nCould go D to (2,2), but that might lead away.\n\nBut (2,2) is free, and from there, I can go to (3,2) or (2,1), but then I might not get to food soon.\n\nSince (3,4) is the only food left, and it's safe to eat, better to eat it.\n\nAlso, long-term survival: after eating, the snake is longer, and we need to find space.\n\nBut for now, the plan seems ok.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: D\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: R\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nAnd beyond, but we can output these.\n\nBut the answer should be in the boxed format.\n\nAlso, for turn 62, we have action D.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 62 action is for the current turn.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 62\\), the snake must avoid immediate risks and plan multiple turns ahead to maximize score by eating the positive food at (3,4) while considering the short-lived food at (5,2), which cannot be reached in time due to distance and life span constraints. The food at (5,2) has a life span of 4 at turn 62, meaning it disappears after turn 65 (life span decreases each turn: 4 at turn 62, 3 at turn 63, 2 at turn 64, 1 at turn 65, gone at turn 66). The Manhattan distance from the head at (1,5) to (5,2) is 7, making it impossible to reach by turn 65. In contrast, the food at (3,4) has a life span of 9 and is closer (Manhattan distance 3), so it is the primary target.\n\nThe snake starts at (1,5) with direction L (left). Moving left to (0,5) is invalid (wall), and moving right to (2,5) causes collision. Moving up to (1,6) is suicidal, as it traps the snake with no valid moves on the next turn (adjacent cells are walls or occupied). Thus, the only safe move at turn 62 is down to (1,4).\n\nAfter moving to (1,4), the direction becomes D (down). At turn 63, moving up to (1,5) causes collision, left to (0,4) is a wall, and right to (2,4) is an obstacle. The only safe move is down to (1,3).\n\nAt turn 64, the head is at (1,3) with direction D. Moving up to (1,4) causes collision, down to (1,2) is an obstacle, and left to (0,3) is a wall. The only safe move is right to (2,3).\n\nAt turn 65, the head is at (2,3) with direction R (right). Moving up to (2,4) is an obstacle, left to (1,3) causes collision, and down to (2,2) is possible but delays reaching the food. Moving right to (3,3) positions the snake to eat the food at (3,4) on the next turn. Since (3,3) is the current tail position, moving there is safe (tail moves away).\n\nAt turn 66, the head is at (3,3) with direction R. Moving up to (3,4) eats the food, increasing length and score by 1. This move is safe as (3,4) is free and not adjacent to the tail in a way that causes \"tail reward danger\" (the tail is at (4,4) after the move).\n\nBeyond turn 66, moving up to (3,5) is the only safe option from (3,4), ensuring survival. The sequence prioritizes long-term survival by avoiding risks and securing the available food.\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n- Turn 62: Down (D) – Move to (1,4) to avoid death and position for food access.\n- Turn 63: Down (D) – Only safe move; continue toward accessible areas.\n- Turn 64: Right (R) – Only safe move; approach food at (3,4).\n- Turn 65: Right (R) – Move to (3,3) to set up for eating food.\n- Turn 66: Up (U) – Eat food at (3,4), increasing score and length.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: D\nTurn 63: D\nTurn 64: R\nTurn 65: R\nTurn 66: U\n}",

So the snake has 13 segments. The head direction is down (D), which means it's moving downwards.\n\nNow, food positions: there are two food items.\n\n- One at (5,2) with value 1 and life span 3. So it will disappear after 3 turns, including this turn. Since current turn is 63, it will disappear after turn 65? Let me clarify the life span. It says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 63, life span 3 means it has 3 turns left: it will be there on turn 63, 64, 65, and disappear after turn 65, so not available on turn 66. Life span N means it lasts for N turns, starting from the current turn. So with life span 3, it appears for turns t, t+1, t+2, and disappears before turn t+3.\n\nSimilarly, the other food at (3,4) with value 1 and life span 8. So it will be around for 8 turns: from turn 63 to 70, disappearing before turn 71.\n\nBoth foods are positive, value +1 each, so eating them increases length by 1.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls, but since it's borders, moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 would hit a wall. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,4), moving down. Down means decreasing y, since y=0 is bottom? Let's confirm coordinates. Typically in such grids, (0,0) might be bottom-left or top-left. But in the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that might imply y=0 is bottom, so increasing y goes up. But in the positions, let's see: head at (1,4), and segments include (1,5), which has higher y, so if head is at (1,4) and moving down to (1,3)? Down is (x,y-1), so from (1,4) down would be to (1,3). But let's see the direction: head direction is D, down.\n\nSnake positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ...] Head at (1,4), next segment at (1,5). If head is at (1,4) and moving down, it should be going to a lower y, but (1,5) has higher y, which is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps I have the coordinate system wrong. Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n\nSnake positions: head (1,4), then (1,5). So from head to second segment is from (1,4) to (1,5), which is an increase in y, so if y increases up, then moving from (1,5) to (1,4) would be down? Let's think of the snake's body.\n\nThe list is head first, then body segments. So at some previous turn, head was at (1,5), and it moved down to (1,4)? But direction is given as current head direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, down. That means the snake is facing downwards, so last move was downwards, so it came from a higher y to lower y.\n\nBut in positions: head at (1,4), next segment at (1,5). (1,5) has y=5, (1,4) has y=4, so if y=5 is above y=4, then moving from (1,5) to (1,4) is down, so head is at (1,4) after moving down, so the segment behind it is at (1,5), which makes sense. So y increases upwards, so (x,y) with y=0 bottom, y=7 top? y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall. Similarly x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nIn positions: (1,4) to (1,5): since head is at (1,4) and body at (1,5), and moving down, so y decreases when moving down. So from (1,5) to (1,4) is down.\n\nCurrent position: head at (1,4), direction down, so it can move down to (1,3), or left/right, but not up, because no instant reverse. Cannot move opposite to current direction, so since direction is D, it cannot move U (up) next. Possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nBut it has to move one cell.\n\nNow, let's list all occupied cells by snake: from positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3).\n\nSo let's plot this on a grid for clarity.\n\nMake a grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,2) is an obstacle.\n\nNow snake: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3).\n\nSo let's list cells:\n\n- (1,4): head\n\n- (1,5): body\n\n- (2,5): body\n\n- (2,6): body\n\n- (3,6): body\n\n- (4,6): body\n\n- (4,5): body\n\n- (5,5): body\n\n- (5,4): body\n\n- (4,4): body\n\n- (4,3): body\n\n- (3,3): body\n\n- (2,3): body\n\nAlso, tail is at (2,3).\n\nNow food: (5,2) and (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is food, but let's see if it's occupied. Snake positions include (4,4), (5,4), (4,3), etc., but not (3,4) listed, so (3,4) is empty, has food.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is food.\n\n(3,4) is at x=3,y=4, which is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n\nBut food can spawn under snake body? Not in this case, both foods are on free cells.\n\n(3,4) is a cell, let's see if snake is there: positions are (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3). No (3,4), so (3,4) is free with food.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) not in positions, free with food.\n\nNow, head at (1,4), direction down, so possible moves from here:\n\n- Down (D) to (1,3)\n\n- Left (L) to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, so cannot move left, hit wall.\n\nx=0 is border wall, so (0,4) is invalid.\n\n- Right (R) to (2,4)\n\n- Up (U) to (1,5), but (1,5) is body segment, and moving up would be opposite to current direction? Current direction is down, so moving up is reverse, which is not allowed because of no instant reverse. Also, (1,5) is occupied by body, so it would be a collision.\n\nCannot move up because: first, it's opposite to current direction, so invalid move. Second, even if it were allowed, it would hit the body at (1,5).\n\nBut since reverse is not allowed, moving up is not possible.\n\nSo possible actions: Down to (1,3) or Right to (2,4).\n\nNow, what is at (1,3)? From snake positions, (1,3) is not listed, so it should be free, but let's check if it's wall or obstacle.\n\nWalls: borders, so (1,3) is within bounds, x=1,y=3, not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) is not, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4), yes, (2,4) is an obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (2,4) is an obstacle, meaning it's a wall cell, cannot move there.\n\nSo from head (1,4), moving right to (2,4) is invalid because (2,4) is an obstacle.\n\nTherefore, the only possible move is down to (1,3).\n\nIs that right?\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Down: (1,3) - not border, not obstacle, not in snake? Snake positions: (1,4) is head, moving to (1,3), which is not in the list: positions have (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,3), and tail is at (2,3), not (1,3). So (1,3) should be free.\n\n- Left: (0,4) - x=0, border wall, invalid.\n\n- Right: (2,4) - but (2,4) is internal obstacle, so wall, invalid.\n\n- Up: (1,5) - but (1,5) is body segment, and also reverse direction, invalid.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is down to (1,3).\n\nBut the snake is moving, and after moving, the tail will move, etc.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells.\n\nPlus internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake occupies: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nNow, (1,3): not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so free.\n\nSimilarly, for food, (5,2) and (3,4) are free.\n\nAt turn 63, head at (1,4), must move down to (1,3) as only option.\n\nThen, after moving, the snake will have new head at (1,3), and the tail will move from (2,3) to... when snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each segment follows, so the tail segment is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSince no food is eaten at (1,3), because no food there, so after moving to (1,3), the new positions: head at (1,3), then the body: previous head (1,4) becomes first body, then (1,5), (2,5), ..., up to (2,3) but (2,3) was tail, and since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the last segment (2,3) is gone.\n\nNew positions: start from new head (1,3), then previous positions except the tail: so (1,4) now body, then (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3). (3,3) was second last, and (2,3) tail removed.\n\nPositions: original 13 segments. After move, head to (1,3), and the body from index 1 to 12: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3). (3,3) is now the tail? Original positions: index 0: head (1,4), 1: (1,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (4,6), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,4), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,3), 11: (3,3), 12: (2,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (1,3) and no food, so new positions: head at (1,3), then segment 0 becomes body at (1,4), segment 1 at (1,5), ..., up to segment 11 at (3,3), and segment 12 (tail) is removed. So new snake: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)] — that's 13 positions? Original 13, head moved, tail removed, so should be 12 segments now.\n\nNew head: (1,3)\n\nThen previous head (1,4) is now body\n\nThen (1,5) body\n\n(2,5) body\n\n(2,6) body\n\n(3,6) body\n\n(4,6) body\n\n(4,5) body\n\n(5,5) body\n\n(5,4) body\n\n(4,4) body\n\n(4,3) body\n\n(3,3) body — now tail, since (2,3) removed.\n\nPositions: from index 0 to 12, 13 cells. After move, new head at new position, and the body from index 0 to 11 become the new body segments, so index 0 (old head) is now segment 1, up to index 11 is segment 12, but since tail removed, only up to index 11? Let's count.\n\nNew positions: [ new_head, old_pos[0], old_pos[1], ..., old_pos[11] ] because old_pos has 13 elements, indices 0 to 12. After move, new_head, then old_pos[0] to old_pos[11] as body, so 1 + 12 = 13 positions? But no food eaten, so length decreases? No.\n\nStandard snake: when no food eaten, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so the snake length remains the same, but the tail moves forward.\n\nIn terms of positions: the new head is at the new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed from the list.\n\nSo for a snake of length L, after moving without eating, it still has length L, but all segments shift.\n\nSo positions: new head at (1,3)\n\nThen the previous head (1,4) is now the first body segment.\n\nThen previous segment 1 (1,5) is now second body, and so on, up to previous segment 11 (3,3) is now the last body segment, and previous tail (2,3) is removed.\n\nPrevious segments: index 0: (1,4), index 1: (1,5), index 2: (2,5), index 3: (2,6), index 4: (3,6), index 5: (4,6), index 6: (4,5), index 7: (5,5), index 8: (5,4), index 9: (4,4), index 10: (4,3), index 11: (3,3), index 12: (2,3)\n\nAfter move: new head at (1,3)\n\nThen body: old index 0: (1,4)\n\nOld index 1: (1,5)\n\nOld index 2: (2,5)\n\nOld index 3: (2,6)\n\nOld index 4: (3,6)\n\nOld index 5: (4,6)\n\nOld index 6: (4,5)\n\nOld index 7: (5,5)\n\nOld index 8: (5,4)\n\nOld index 9: (4,4)\n\nOld index 10: (4,3)\n\nOld index 11: (3,3)  // now tail\n\nOld index 12: (2,3) removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)] — that's 13 positions, but we removed the tail, so it should be 12? I think I have a mistake.\n\nOriginal snake length 13, after move without eating, length should be 13, but the tail moves, so the cell (2,3) is vacated, and the snake occupies the new head and the previous positions except the tail is advanced.\n\nIn the list, the new snake has the new head, followed by the first L-1 positions of the old snake, which includes all except the tail.\n\nOld snake positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P12 with P0 head, P12 tail.\n\nNew snake: new_head, P0, P1, P2, ..., P11.\n\nP0 to P11 are 12 positions, plus new head, 13 positions, but P11 was the second last, and P12 is removed, so new tail is P11.\n\nIn this case, P11 is (3,3), which was index 11, and P12 (2,3) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), then P0 (1,4), P1 (1,5), P2 (2,5), P3 (2,6), P4 (3,6), P5 (4,6), P6 (4,5), P7 (5,5), P8 (5,4), P9 (4,4), P10 (4,3), P11 (3,3) as tail.\n\nP11 is (3,3), which is fine.\n\nLength is still 13? But no food, so length should be same, yes, 13 segments.\n\nBut earlier I thought tail is removed, but in terms of cells, the snake occupies 13 cells before and after, but the set changes: head moved to new cell, tail left old cell.\n\nIn this case, from positions, new head at (1,3), and tail at (3,3), whereas before tail was at (2,3).\n\nNow back to the move.\n\nAt turn 63, only possible move is down to (1,3).\n\nThen for turn 64, head at (1,3), direction is now down, since it moved down.\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves: down to (1,2), but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nLeft to (0,3), x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nRight to (2,3), but (2,3) is where? In new positions, after move, (2,3) is not occupied; it was the old tail, now vacated. But is it free?\n\nNew positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nSo (2,3) is not occupied, and not wall except for internal, but (2,3) not an obstacle; obstacles are (1,2), (2,4), etc., not (2,3). So (2,3) should be free.\n\nBut moving right to (2,3) from (1,3).\n\nAlso, up to (1,4), but (1,4) is body segment, and moving up would be opposite to current direction? Current direction after moving down to (1,3) is still down, so moving up is reverse, not allowed.\n\nPossible moves from (1,3):\n\n- Down: (1,2) - but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\n- Left: (0,3) - x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- Right: (2,3) - not wall, not obstacle, not snake? (2,3) is not in new positions, so free.\n\n- Up: (1,4) - but (1,4) is body segment, and reverse direction, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is right to (2,3).\n\nThen at turn 64, move right to (2,3).\n\nNow, (2,3) has food? Food positions: (5,2) and (3,4), not (2,3), so no food, so snake moves, no eat, tail moves.\n\nNew head at (2,3), direction now right (since moved right).\n\nNew positions: head at (2,3), then previous head (1,3) becomes body, then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3) as tail.\n\n(3,3) was tail before, now it will be removed if no eat, but let's see.\n\nAfter move to (2,3), no food, so new snake: head (2,3), then old positions from P0: (1,3), then P1: (1,4), P2: (1,5), P3: (2,5), P4: (2,6), P5: (3,6), P6: (4,6), P7: (4,5), P8: (5,5), P9: (5,4), P10: (4,4), P11: (4,3), and P12: (3,3) removed? Old P11 was (3,3), which was tail, but in new list, after move, new head (2,3), then old P0 (1,3), old P1 (1,4), ..., up to old P10 (4,3), and old P11 (3,3) is not included, so new tail is old P10 (4,3).\n\nPositions: new head (2,3), then old P0 (1,3), old P1 (1,4), old P2 (1,5), old P3 (2,5), old P4 (2,6), old P5 (3,6), old P6 (4,6), old P7 (4,5), old P8 (5,5), old P9 (5,4), old P10 (4,4), old P11 (4,3) — and old P12 (3,3) removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)] with tail at (4,3).\n\nNow at turn 65, head at (2,3), direction right.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Down: (2,2) — is this valid? y=2, x=2. Not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: not occupied, so free.\n\n- Left: (1,3) — but (1,3) is body segment, and moving left would be opposite to current direction (right), so reverse, not allowed.\n\n- Right: (3,3) — (3,3) is not in current positions? Current positions have (4,3) as tail, but (3,3) is not there. Last position is (4,3), and before that (4,4), etc. (3,3) is not in the list, so free. But is it wall? No, not obstacle.\n\n- Up: (2,4) — but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is free, no food there.\n\nNow, food at (5,2) and (3,4), but (5,2) has life span 3, meaning at turn 63, life span 3, so it disappears after turn 65? Turn 63: present, life span decreases each turn including current.\n\nAt turn 63, food at (5,2) has life span 3, so it will be there for turn 63, 64, 65, and disappear before turn 66.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 64, life span 2, turn 65 life span 1, then gone.\n\nTurn 63: life span 3, after turn 63, it decreases, so at start of turn 63, life span 3, after turn 63, it becomes 2, and so on.\n\nThe food is present when life span > 0.\n\nAt turn 63: life span 3, present.\n\nAfter turn 63 (after snake moves), life span decreases by 1, so at start of turn 64, life span 2, present.\n\nAfter turn 64, life span 1, present at turn 65.\n\nAfter turn 65, life span 0, disappears, not present at turn 66.\n\nSimilarly, the other food (3,4) life span 8, so it will be around for many turns.\n\nNow back to turn 65, head at (2,3), can move down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\n(2,2) is free, no food. (3,3) free, no food.\n\nBut we need to think about getting food.\n\nAlso, there is a food at (3,4), which is close.\n\nBut at (2,3), moving to (3,3) or (2,2).\n\nIf move right to (3,3), then from there, can go to (3,4), which has food.\n\n(3,4) has food, value +1.\n\nBut is it safe to eat?\n\nFirst, let's see the path.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,3) at turn 65.\n\nThen at turn 66, head at (3,3), direction right (if moved right).\n\nThen from (3,3), can move up to (3,4), which has food.\n\n(3,4) is not occupied by snake currently, and will be free if we move there.\n\nBut we need to check if eating it causes collision.\n\nFood at (3,4), if head moves to it, eats it, so snake grows, tail doesn't move, so new head at (3,4), and body segments remain, so the previous tail is not removed.\n\nBut after eating, the new tail is where? Let's see.\n\nFirst, at turn 65, if we move to (3,3), no food there, so snake moves, tail advances.\n\nThen at turn 66, from (3,3) move to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) has food, so when head moves to (3,4), it eats the food, so the snake grows: head at (3,4), and the body includes the previous head position, and tail does not move, so length increases by one.\n\nIn terms of positions, new head at (3,4), then previous positions all remain, so tail stays.\n\nBut we need to check for Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, when moving to (3,4), what is the tail?\n\nAt turn 65, after moving to (3,3), let's trace the state.\n\nFirst, at turn 63: move down to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 64: move right to (2,3)\n\nNow at turn 65: head at (2,3), move to (3,3) for example.\n\nAfter move to (3,3), no food, so new snake: head at (3,3), then previous head (2,3) body, then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3) as tail.\n\n(4,3) is tail.\n\nNow at turn 66, head at (3,3), direction right (since moved from (2,3) to (3,3)).\n\nPossible moves: up to (3,4), down to (3,2), left to (2,3), right to (4,3).\n\n(2,3) is body segment, so cannot move left, collision and reverse? Current direction right, left is reverse, not allowed.\n\n(4,3) is tail, but in positions, (4,3) is current tail, so moving to (4,3) would be moving into tail.\n\nBut the rule: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward if no food eaten.\n\nBut if you eat food, tail doesn't move.\n\nLet's read collision rules.\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if you move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves.\n\nBut if you eat food, tail doesn't move, so if you move to tail position and eat food, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail are at same position? No, when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail stays, so the cell that was tail is still occupied, but head is at new position.\n\nCase 1: no food eaten: head moves to new cell, tail moves from old tail cell, so if head moves to the old tail cell, it's ok, because tail vacates it.\n\nCase 2: food eaten: head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so the tail cell remains occupied.\n\nIn this case, at turn 66, if head at (3,3) and moves to (4,3), which is the current tail.\n\nIf no food at (4,3), then moving there is ok, because after move, tail will move away.\n\nBut (4,3) has no food, so if move to (4,3), no food, so head moves to (4,3), and tail (which was at (4,3)) moves to the next position, so (4,3) is vacated, but head is moving to it, so it's fine, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if there was food at (4,3), and you move to it, you eat it, tail doesn't move, so the cell is occupied by tail, but head is moving to it, so they would be at same cell, collision.\n\nBut in this case, (4,3) has no food.\n\nBack to moves from (3,3) at turn 66:\n\n- Up: (3,4) — has food? Yes, (3,4) has food with value 1.\n\n- Down: (3,2) — free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake, should be free.\n\n- Left: (2,3) — body segment, and reverse direction, invalid.\n\n- Right: (4,3) — which is current tail, but no food, so can move there safely.\n\nIf move up to (3,4), eat food, snake grows.\n\nTail is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (3,4)? Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,4) and (4,3) are diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y differ by 1.\n\n(3,4) and (4,3) differ in both x and y, so not adjacent.\n\nTail at (4,3), head moving to (3,4), not adjacent, so no Tail Reward Danger.\n\nThen after eating, new head at (3,4), body includes (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), etc., and tail at (4,3) stays.\n\nThen from there, can explore.\n\nBut we also have the other food at (5,2) which disappears after turn 65.\n\nAt turn 65, it is present, life span 1, so after turn 65, it disappears, not available turn 66.\n\nAt turn 65, head at (2,3), can move to (2,2) or (3,3).\n\n(2,2) is close to (5,2)? Not directly.\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2.\n\nFrom (2,3), if move down to (2,2), then at (2,2), can move to (3,2) or (2,1), but (2,1) might be wall or something.\n\n(2,1): internal obstacles include (5,1), (6,1), but not (2,1), so free. But y=1, not border yet.\n\nBorders are y=0, so y=1 is ok.\n\nThen from (2,2) to (3,2), etc., to reach (5,2), but (5,2) disappears after turn 65, so at turn 65, if head is at (2,3), moving to (2,2) or (3,3), neither is (5,2), so cannot eat it at turn 65. At turn 64, head was at (2,3), but turn 64 we moved to (2,3), no food there.\n\nAt turn 65, head at (2,3), (5,2) is two moves away, cannot reach in one move, so impossible to eat (5,2) before it disappears. So we should ignore it.\n\nLife span: at turn 63, (5,2) present, turn 64 present, turn 65 present, gone turn 66.\n\nAt turn 63, head at (1,4), moved to (1,3), not (5,2).\n\nTurn 64, head at (1,3), moved to (2,3), not (5,2).\n\nTurn 65, head at (2,3), can only move to (2,2) or (3,3), not to (5,2), so indeed, cannot eat (5,2), it will disappear unused.\n\nSo focus on the other food at (3,4).\n\nNow back to turn 65 choices.\n\nHead at (2,3), can move down to (2,2) or right to (3,3).\n\nIf move to (3,3), then at turn 66, can move up to (3,4) to eat food.\n\nIf move down to (2,2), then from there, it might be harder to reach (3,4), and also, moving down might lead to dead ends.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), possible moves: down to (2,1), left to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, invalid, right to (3,2), up to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, reverse if direction down.\n\nAfter moving down to (2,2), direction down.\n\nThen moves: down to (2,1), right to (3,2), up to (2,3) but (2,3) body and reverse, invalid. Left to (1,2) obstacle invalid. So only down or right.\n\n(2,1) is free, (3,2) free.\n\nBut to reach (3,4), it's farther.\n\nWhereas from (3,3), directly to (3,4) next turn.\n\nMoreover, (3,4) has life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut we need to think about survival.\n\nAfter eating (3,4), the snake grows, and we need to find a path.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nSince we must plan multiple turns, and at turn 63, only one choice, down to (1,3).\n\nTurn 64, only choice, right to (2,3).\n\nThen at turn 65, we have a choice: move to (3,3) or to (2,2).\n\nIf we move to (3,3), then turn 66 move to (3,4) to eat.\n\nIf we move to (2,2), then we might not get the food soon.\n\nBut let's see the grid around.\n\nFirst, let's list all free cells.\n\nWalls: borders and internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nAlso snake occupies, but it moves.\n\nFor long-term, we need to avoid trapping ourselves.\n\nNow, the snake is currently in a sort of loop.\n\nPositions: from head (2,3) in turn 65 state? Let's define the state at the beginning of turn 65.\n\nAfter turn 64 move to (2,3), head at (2,3), direction right.\n\nSnake positions: as above, [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)] with tail at (4,3).\n\nFree cells: for example, (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)? (3,5) not occupied, not wall.\n\n(3,5): not border, not internal obstacle (obstacles are (2,4), etc., not (3,5)), not snake, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2), (5,3), etc.\n\nFood at (3,4).\n\nNow, if at turn 65 move to (3,3), then turn 66 move to (3,4) to eat.\n\nAfter eating at (3,4), new head at (3,4), and body: the previous positions including (3,3), (2,3), etc., and tail at (4,3) stays.\n\nSo new positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), and (4,3) tail? After eating, the tail does not move, so the body includes all previous segments plus the new head, so length increases.\n\nPrevious before move: head at (3,3), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), ..., up to (4,3) tail.\n\nWhen head moves to (3,4) and eats food, new head at (3,4), then the previous head (3,3) becomes first body, then the previous body segments: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), and previous tail (4,3) remains as part of body, so new tail is (4,3).\n\nSo positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)] — 15 segments.\n\nTail at (4,3).\n\nDirection: moved up to (3,4), so direction up.\n\nNow, from (3,4), possible moves: up to (3,5), down to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, collision, and reverse? Current direction up, down is reverse, not allowed.\n\nLeft to (2,4), but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nRight to (4,4), but (4,4) is body segment, occupied.\n\n(4,4) is in positions, body.\n\nSo only possible move is up to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake currently? Before move, (3,5) not occupied, so free.\n\nSo must move up to (3,5).\n\nThen after move, no food at (3,5)? Food was only at (3,4), eaten, so no, so snake moves, tail advances.\n\nNew head at (3,5), direction up.\n\nThen body: previous head (3,4), then segments, tail moves from (4,3) to previous position.\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) — and (4,3) removed? Tail was (4,3), no food, so removed, new tail is (4,4).\n\nPositions: new head (3,5), old head (3,4) body, then old body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), and old tail (4,3) removed.\n\n(4,4) was part of body, now becomes tail.\n\nList: new head (3,5), then old positions except tail: so old head (3,4) now body, old body index 0: (2,3), index 1: (1,3), index 2: (1,4), index 3: (1,5), index 4: (2,5), index 5: (2,6), index 6: (3,6), index 7: (4,6), index 8: (4,5), index 9: (5,5), index 10: (5,4), index 11: (4,4) — and old tail removed.\n\nOld body had multiple segments.\n\nAfter move to (3,5), no eat, new snake: head (3,5), then previous head (3,4), then previous body segments from before: in the list, after eating, we had positions including (4,3) tail.\n\nWhen moving from (3,4) to (3,5), no food, so head to (3,5), body: (3,4) becomes first body, then the previous body segments except the tail is advanced? Standard: after no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail removed.\n\nSo from positions before move: head (3,4), body: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), tail (4,3).\n\nAfter move head to (3,5), new head (3,5), then body: (3,4) (previous head), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) — and tail (4,3) removed, so new tail is (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is now tail.\n\nNow head at (3,5), direction up.\n\nPossible moves: up to (3,6), but (3,6) is body segment (in positions), occupied.\n\nDown to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, and reverse direction, invalid.\n\nLeft to (2,5), (2,5) is body, occupied.\n\nRight to (4,5), (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\n(3,6) is occupied, (2,5) occupied, (4,5) occupied.\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied or walls.\n\nUp (3,6): body\n\nDown (3,4): body and reverse\n\nLeft (2,5): body\n\nRight (4,5): body\n\nSo no possible moves! Snake is trapped and will die.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nAfter eating at (3,4) and moving up to (3,5), we are stuck.\n\nBecause the area is crowded.\n\nAt turn 65, if we move to (3,3) and then eat at (3,4), we end up trapped.\n\nTherefore, moving to (3,3) at turn 65 is dangerous.\n\nNow, the other choice: at turn 65, move down to (2,2) instead.\n\nThen from (2,2), direction down (since moved down).\n\nAt turn 65, head at (2,3), move down to (2,2).\n\nThen after move, no food, so new head at (2,2), body: previous head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3) as tail? Previous positions before move: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), tail (4,3)\n\nAfter move to (2,2), no eat, new head (2,2), then (2,3) body, (1,3) body, (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), and (4,3) removed, new tail (4,4).\n\n(4,4) tail.\n\nNow head at (2,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: down to (2,1), left to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, invalid, right to (3,2), up to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, and reverse direction, invalid.\n\nSo only down to (2,1) or right to (3,2).\n\n(2,1) is free, (3,2) free.\n\nSay move to (3,2) for example.\n\nThen from there, can go to (3,3), then to (3,4) to eat food.\n\nAt turn 66, head at (2,2), move to (3,2).\n\nDirection right.\n\nNew head (3,2), body: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), etc., tail advances.\n\nThen at turn 67, head at (3,2), can move up to (3,3), then at turn 68 to (3,4) to eat.\n\nBut (3,4) has long life, so ok.\n\nAfter eating at (3,4), similar situation, but now head at (3,4), and the body might be different.\n\nTo avoid trapping, we need to have an escape route.\n\nAt turn 65, moving to (2,2) might be better because it opens up space.\n\nBut let's think from turn 63 onwards with actions.\n\nThe answer should be for multiple turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=63.\n\nAt turn 63, only choice: move D to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 64, only choice: move R to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 65, we have choice: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nIf we move R to (3,3), then as before, turn 66 move U to (3,4) eat, then turn 67 must move U to (3,5), but then stuck, as all adjacent occupied.\n\nAt (3,5), no moves, die.\n\nSo that path is fatal.\n\nTherefore, at turn 65, we should move D to (2,2) instead.\n\nThen turn 65: move D to (2,2)\n\nNow, after that, at turn 66, head at (2,2), direction down (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2)\n\nL to (1,2) invalid obstacle, U to (2,3) body and reverse, invalid.\n\nNow, both (2,1) and (3,2) are free.\n\nWe need to go towards (3,4) to eat food.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), so from (2,2), moving right to (3,2) is closer.\n\nThen from (3,2), can go up.\n\nBut let's plan.\n\nAlso, there might be other areas.\n\nSince we need to maximize score, eating the food is good, but survival first.\n\nAt turn 66, if at (2,2), move R to (3,2)\n\nThen new head at (3,2), direction right.\n\nThen turn 67, from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2) but (2,2) body, reverse invalid, R to (4,2)\n\n(3,3) free, (3,1) free, (4,2) free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), etc., not (4,2).\n\nSay move U to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 68, head at (3,3), then move U to (3,4) to eat.\n\nNow, when eating at (3,4), what is the tail?\n\nFirst, trace positions.\n\nStart from turn 65: after move to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) tail? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 65 move to (2,2): head (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) with tail (4,4)\n\nTurn 66 move to (3,2): no food, so new head (3,2), then (2,2) body, (2,3) body, (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), and (4,4) removed? Tail was (4,4), removed, new tail (5,4).\n\nPositions: new head (3,2), old head (2,2) body, old body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — and old tail (4,4) removed. (5,4) is now tail.\n\n(5,4) tail.\n\nTurn 67 move to (3,3): no food, new head (3,3), then (3,2) body, (2,2) body, (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), and (5,4) removed? Tail was (5,4), removed, new tail (5,5).\n\nPositions: head (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n\nTurn 68 move to (3,4): has food, so eat.\n\nNew head at (3,4), then previous positions: (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) all remain, tail at (5,5) stays.\n\nSo positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)] with tail (5,5).\n\nDirection: moved up to (3,4), so direction up.\n\nNow from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) body, invalid, L to (2,4) obstacle, invalid, R to (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is not occupied? Positions have (4,5), (5,5), etc., not (4,4). (4,4) was earlier, but now removed? In current positions, (4,4) not there; last was (4,5) and (5,5).\n\n(4,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) free.\n\nSo can move U to (3,5) or R to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is at x=4,y=4.\n\nIf move U to (3,5), then similar to before, might get stuck later.\n\nIf move R to (4,4), then from there, can go to other areas.\n\nFor example, (4,4) is free, so move to (4,4).\n\nThen after that, can go down to (4,3) or right, etc.\n\nTo maximize survival, moving right to (4,4) might be better to open space.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nBack to turn 65 decision.\n\nAt turn 65, moving down to (2,2) allows us to eat the food later with more space.\n\nMoving to (3,3) directly leads to trap.\n\nTherefore, at turn 65, we should move down to (2,2).\n\nNow for the answer, we need to output actions starting from turn 63.\n\nTurn 63: must move D\n\nTurn 64: must move R\n\nTurn 65: move D to (2,2)\n\nThen for turn 66 and beyond, we need to specify, but the answer format says to output actions for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many. \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output might be for a few turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so probably for as many as we can, but since the state changes, perhaps for the immediate decisions.\n\nIn this case, after turn 65 move D, then at turn 66, we have choices.\n\nBut to be complete, let's outline.\n\nSince the food at (3,4) is safe to eat later, we can go for it.\n\nBut in the move to (2,2), at turn 66, we can move to (3,2) or (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is down, might lead to corner.\n\n(3,2) is better to go towards (3,4).\n\nSo at turn 66, move R to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 67, from (3,2) move U to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 68, from (3,3) move U to (3,4) to eat.\n\nThen after eating, at (3,4), we can move R to (4,4) to avoid getting stuck.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 63: D\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: D (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 66: R (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 67: U (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 68: U (to (3,4) eat)\n\nThen turn 69: from (3,4) after eat, direction up, so can move R to (4,4) or U to (3,5)\n\nBut (3,5) might be riskier, so move R to (4,4)\n\nWe need to output for turn 63 to, say, 5 turns ahead? t1=63, so up to turn 68 or so.\n\nSince at turn 63,64 only one choice, turn 65 we decide D.\n\nThen for later turns, we can specify.\n\nIn the answer, we should provide the sequence.\n\nAlso, for the food, it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 68, when moving to (3,4) to eat, is there Tail Reward Danger?\n\nTail at that time: when at turn 68, before move, head at (3,3), tail is at (5,5), as above.\n\n(5,5) and (3,4) are not adjacent; (5,5) to (3,4) is not adjacent, since |dx|=2, |dy|=1.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nAfter eating, tail at (5,5), head at (3,4), then move to (4,4), for example.\n\n(4,4) is free.\n\nSo should be ok.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nFirst, turn 63: D\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: D\n\nThen turn 66: R (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 67: U (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 68: U (to (3,4))\n\nBut we need to specify actions, not positions.\n\nAnd for thinking ahead, this should work.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 63 Decision\n\nThe current state at turn 63 requires careful planning to maximize score while ensuring long-term survival. The snake must avoid immediate death and position itself to eat the positive food at (3,4) safely, as the food at (5,2) will disappear after turn 65 and is unreachable. Key constraints and risks:\n- **Immediate moves (turns 63-64)**: Only one valid move each due to walls and body collisions. Moving down (D) to (1,3) at turn 63 and right (R) to (2,3) at turn 64 are forced.\n- **Turn 65 choice**: From (2,3), moving right (R) to (3,3) allows eating the food at (3,4) on turn 66, but this leads to a trap on turn 67 after eating (all adjacent cells occupied, no escape). Moving down (D) to (2,2) avoids this trap and opens a path to eat (3,4) safely later.\n- **Food prioritization**: The food at (3,4) has a long life span (8 turns), so it can be eaten later. Eating it from (2,2) via (3,2) and (3,3) is safe and does not cause Tail Reward Danger (tail is distant during the eat).\n- **5+ turn plan**: After eating (3,4), moving right (R) to (4,4) on turn 69 avoids congestion and ensures survival by accessing open space.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 63 to 69)\nThe sequence below ensures the snake survives, eats the positive food at (3,4) on turn 68, and positions itself for future moves. Actions are chosen to avoid collisions, respect movement constraints, and maximize long-term opportunities.\n\n- **Turn 63**: Move D (down) to (1,3) – Only possible move (left and right blocked by walls/obstacles; up is reverse and body collision).\n- **Turn 64**: Move R (right) to (2,3) – Only possible move (down blocked by obstacle; left and up invalid).\n- **Turn 65**: Move D (down) to (2,2) – Avoids the trap from moving to (3,3) and enables a safe path to the food.\n- **Turn 66**: Move R (right) to (3,2) – Heads toward (3,4) with no immediate risks.\n- **Turn 67**: Move U (up) to (3,3) – Positions for eating food next turn; no food here, so tail advances safely.\n- **Turn 68**: Move U (up) to (3,4) – Eats positive food (score +1, length increases); no Tail Reward Danger (tail at (5,5) is not adjacent).\n- **Turn 69**: Move R (right) to (4,4) – After eating, this avoids congestion and explores open space for future food.\n\nThis plan thinks 6 turns ahead (turns 63–69), prioritizing survival by:\n- Avoiding the fatal trap that would occur if moving to (3,3) on turn 65.\n- Safely reaching and eating the food at (3,4) when the tail is distant.\n- Ensuring an escape route after eating by moving to (4,4), which has fewer body segments nearby.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 63: D (down)\nTurn 64: R (right)\nTurn 65: D (down)\nTurn 66: R (right)\nTurn 67: U (up)\nTurn 68: U (up)\nTurn 69: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 64, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So I can't move into these cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,3), and the body segments follow: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3). Head direction is down (D), which is decreasing y, so from (1,3), moving down would go to (1,2), but (1,2) is an obstacle, so I can't move there directly.\n\nHead direction is D, meaning last move was down, so from (1,4) to (1,3) I assume, since positions are head first: (1,3) is head, then (1,4) is next, which is up from (1,3)? Let's list the positions in order:\n\n- Head: (1,3)\n\n- Body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)\n\nSince head is at (1,3) and direction is D, that means it was moving down to (1,3). Before that, it must have been at (1,4), moving down to (1,3). But (1,4) is the first body segment, so the snake was moving down from (1,4) to (1,3). Now, at (1,3), head direction is D, so possible moves are not opposite, so I can't move up immediately, because that would be reverse. Directions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y).\n\nCurrent head direction is D, so last move was down. Therefore, I cannot move up (U) on the next turn because that would be instant reverse.\n\nPossible moves from (1,3): \n\n- Down (D): to (1,2) – but (1,2) is an internal obstacle, so I can't move there.\n\n- Left (L): to (0,3) – x=0 is a border wall, so I can't move there.\n\n- Right (R): to (2,3) – is this free? Let me see what cells are occupied or walls.\n\nSnake positions: (1,3) head, (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), etc. (2,3) is not in the snake body? List all occupied cells by snake.\n\nSnake: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)\n\n(4,3) and (3,3) are also snake, but (2,3) is not listed, so it might be free.\n\nAlso, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo (2,3): x=2, y=3. Is it a wall? Borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=2 is not border. y=3 not border. Internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) is not listed, so it should be free. Similarly, is there any other?\n\n(2,3) is not in snake positions, not in walls, so it should be free.\n\nBut I can only move right? Down to (1,2) is obstacle, left to (0,3) is border wall, up to (1,4) is snake body, but (1,4) is the first body segment, so moving up would collide with body.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,4) – occupied by snake body, so collision.\n\n- D: to (1,2) – internal obstacle, collision with wall.\n\n- L: to (0,3) – border wall, collision.\n\n- R: to (2,3) – seems free.\n\nIs (2,3) free? Snake positions don't include (2,3), walls don't include it, so yes, I can move right to (2,3).\n\nBut head direction is D, and moving right is allowed since it's not opposite. Opposite of down is up, which I can't do anyway.\n\nSo from (1,3), only possible move is right to (2,3). Is that correct?\n\nWhat about other directions? U to (1,4) is body, D to (1,2) wall, L to (0,3) wall, so only R to (2,3) is possible. So I have to move right.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, food items:\n\n- (5,2) with life_span=2, value=1 (positive)\n\n- (3,4) with life_span=7, value=1 (positive)\n\n- (1,1) with life_span=10, value=1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nLife_span decreases every turn, including current turn? The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn t, the life_span decreases by 1 for that turn.\n\nCurrent turn is 64, so for each food:\n\n- (5,2): life_span=2, so after turn 64, it will have 1 turn left, then disappear after turn 65 if not eaten.\n\n- (3,4): life_span=7, after turn 64, 6 left.\n\n- (1,1): life_span=10, after turn 64, 9 left.\n\nBut I have to move to eat them.\n\nNow, snake head at (1,3), moving to (2,3) as the only option this turn.\n\nThen, from there, I need to plan.\n\nAlso, the snake has 13 segments? Positions list has 13 elements: indices 0 to 12, so length 13.\n\nAfter eating positive food, length increases by one.\n\nNow, since I must move right to (2,3) on turn 64, because no other choice.\n\nConfirm the grid.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls. Also internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(1,2) is internal obstacle, so (1,2) is blocked.\n\nSnake: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)\n\n(4,3) and (3,3) are tail end.\n\nNow, (2,3) is not occupied, so moving right to (2,3) is safe.\n\nAfter moving, new head position: (2,3)\n\nThen the snake will move, tail will move away from (3,3), so (3,3) becomes free after this move? When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail end is removed.\n\nAfter moving right to (2,3), the new positions: head at (2,3), then the body: previous head (1,3) becomes first body, so (1,3) is now body, then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), and tail (3,3) is removed? Let's see the sequence.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: (1,3) head, 1: (1,4), 2: (1,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (4,5), 8: (5,5), 9: (5,4), 10: (4,4), 11: (4,3), 12: (3,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,3), new head is (2,3). Then the body segments: the segment that was at index 0 moves to where head was? No, in snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed, and each segment shifts.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, that becomes new head, and the tail cell is vacated, unless food is eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n\nSpecifically: new head position, then the body follows, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo after moving to (2,3):\n\nNew positions: head: (2,3)\n\nThen body: previous positions from index 0 to 11, but shifted.\n\nIndex 0 was (1,3), now it becomes the first body segment at (1,3)? No.\n\nWhen head moves to new position, the new head is the new position, and then the first body segment is the previous head position, and so on, up to the second last segment, and the tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions:\n\n- New head: (2,3)\n\n- New body segment 1: previous head (1,3)\n\n- New body segment 2: previous body 1 (1,4)\n\n- New body segment 3: previous body 2 (1,5)\n\n- New body segment 4: previous body 3 (2,5)\n\n- New body segment 5: previous body 4 (2,6)\n\n- New body segment 6: previous body 5 (3,6)\n\n- New body segment 7: previous body 6 (4,6)\n\n- New body segment 8: previous body 7 (4,5)\n\n- New body segment 9: previous body 8 (5,5)\n\n- New body segment 10: previous body 9 (5,4)\n\n- New body segment 11: previous body 10 (4,4)\n\n- New body segment 12: previous body 11 (4,3)  // since tail was (3,3), but it's removed, so the new tail is previous body 11, which is (4,3)\n\nPrevious positions: indices 0 to 12.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head: move to (2,3)\n\n- Then, the segment that was at index 0 (old head) becomes body at position (1,3)\n\n- Segment that was at index 1 becomes body at (1,4) (its position)\n\n...\n\nUp to segment that was at index 11: (4,3) becomes body\n\nAnd segment that was at index 12 (tail) is removed, so not part of snake anymore.\n\nSo new snake positions: head (2,3), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)  // 13 segments still, since no food eaten.\n\nLength remains 13.\n\nNow, the cell (3,3) is now free, since tail moved away.\n\nAlso, head direction was D, but now I moved R, so new head direction is R (right).\n\nNow, for turn 65, I need to move from (2,3).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut cannot reverse, current direction is R (since last move was right), so cannot move left (L), which is opposite.\n\nSo possible: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nNow, check each:\n\n- U: to (2,4)\n\n- D: to (2,2)\n\n- R: to (3,3)\n\nNow, what is at these cells?\n\nFirst, (2,4): is it occupied? Snake positions: after move, body has (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), etc. (2,4) not listed, but internal obstacles: (2,4) is an internal obstacle! From the list: internal obstacles include (2,4), yes.\n\nSo (2,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nD: to (2,2) – is this free? (2,2) not in snake, not in walls? Walls: borders y=0 is wall, y=2 is not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\nR: to (3,3) – (3,3) was the tail, but after move, tail is removed, so (3,3) should be free now? After turn 64 move, (3,3) is vacated, so (3,3) is empty.\n\nBut (3,3) is a cell, not wall, so should be free.\n\nNow, snake positions after turn 64: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is body, (3,3) is free.\n\nSo from (2,3):\n\n- U to (2,4): obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\n- D to (2,2): free, no snake or wall.\n\n- R to (3,3): free, no snake or wall.\n\nAlso, L to (1,3): but (1,3) is now body segment, and since it's adjacent, moving left would be into body, collision. Also, reverse is not allowed anyway since current direction R, opposite L not possible.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (5,2) with life_span=2, but on turn 64, it decreases to 1, so after turn 64, it has 1 turn left, will disappear after turn 65 if not eaten.\n\n- (3,4) with life_span=7, after turn 64, 6 left.\n\n- (1,1) with life_span=10, after turn 64, 9 left.\n\nHead is at (2,3) after turn 64 move.\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2. From (2,3), how to get there? (2,3) to (5,2) is not adjacent; need to move.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is at (3,4), which is close to (2,3)? (2,3) to (3,4) is not adjacent; (3,4) is up-right from (2,3), but not adjacent directly.\n\nAdjacent cells: (2,3) neighbors: (2,4) north, (2,2) south, (1,3) west, (3,3) east.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to (2,3); it's one step right and one up, but not a neighbor.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is at (1,1), which is down-left from (2,3).\n\nBut (1,1) has high life span, so less urgent.\n\n(5,2) has only one turn left; after turn 65, it disappears. So to eat it, I need to be at (5,2) on turn 65 or before, but since turn 64 is done, I need to eat it on turn 65.\n\nOn turn 65, head is at (2,3), and I move to a new position.\n\nCan I reach (5,2) from (2,3) in one move? No, because (5,2) is not adjacent; it's three steps away.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (5,2): difference in x: +3, y: -1, so at least 3 moves away, impossible to reach in one move.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,2) on turn 65; it will disappear after turn 65, so I miss it. It will be gone.\n\nAfter turn 64, food (5,2) has life_span 1, meaning it will be there on turn 65, and if not eaten by end of turn 65, it disappears. So to eat it, I must move to (5,2) on turn 65.\n\nBut from current position after turn 64, head at (2,3), I cannot reach (5,2) in one move, so impossible to eat it. Therefore, (5,2) will be lost.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is at (3,4), which I can potentially reach.\n\n(1,1) at (1,1).\n\nNow, for turn 65, from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf I move R to (3,3), then head at (3,3), direction R.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), but L is reverse, not allowed, or R to (4,3).\n\n(3,4) is a food location! With value 1.\n\n(3,4) has food, and if I move to (3,4), I can eat it.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, from (2,3), if I move R to (3,3) on turn 65, then head to (3,3).\n\nThen on turn 66, I can move U to (3,4) to eat the food.\n\nBut is (3,4) free? Currently, after turn 64, what is at (3,4)?\n\nAfter turn 64 move, snake positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\n(3,4) is not occupied; it should be free. Internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nFood at (3,4), so it's there.\n\nIf I move to (3,3) on turn 65, then on turn 66 move U to (3,4), I eat the food.\n\nBut when I eat, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and I gain +1 score and length increases.\n\nNow, but I need to think about risks.\n\nAnother option: from (2,3), move D to (2,2) on turn 65.\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves from there.\n\nBut (2,2) might be close to (1,1) food.\n\nBut (1,1) has many turns left.\n\nFirst, let's consider the path to (3,4) food.\n\nIf I go to (3,3) on turn 65, then to (3,4) on turn 66.\n\nBut after eating, the snake grows, so I need to be careful of the body.\n\nAlso, there is a risk mentioned: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, the food is at (3,4), not on tail.\n\nCurrent tail after turn 64 is at (4,3).\n\nAfter turn 65: if I move to (3,3), new head (3,3), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), ..., up to (4,4), and tail (4,3) removed? Let's simulate.\n\nAfter turn 64: positions: head (2,3), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail.\n\nNow turn 65, move R to (3,3): new head (3,3)\n\nThen new body: previous head (2,3) becomes first body, then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), and the segment that was at (4,3) is removed? The last body was (4,3), which is tail, removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)  // 13 segments, tail at (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is now tail.\n\nThen on turn 66, if I move U to (3,4): new head (3,4)\n\nSince (3,4) has food, I eat it, so no tail removal; instead, the tail stays, and I add a new segment.\n\nSo after eating, new head at (3,4), and the body includes all previous segments, so the snake grows by one.\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), then body: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)  // 14 segments, tail at (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is still there, but now it's part of the body, not tail anymore; the new tail is (4,4) or? Positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), ..., up to (4,4), which was the previous tail, but since no removal, (4,4) is still there, and new tail is the last one, which is (4,4) I think.\n\nThe segments: index 0: head (3,4), 1: (3,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (1,3), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (2,6), 8: (3,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (4,5), 11: (5,5), 12: (5,4), 13: (4,4) tail.\n\nSo tail is at (4,4).\n\nNow, is this safe? I need to check future moves.\n\nBut first, on turn 65, if I move to (3,3), and then turn 66 to (3,4) to eat food.\n\nBut from (2,3), I have another choice: move D to (2,2) on turn 65.\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: from (2,2), U to (2,3), but that is reverse? Current direction D, U is opposite, not allowed.\n\nD to (2,1) – y=1, not border, but internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) is not, (2,1) not listed, so free? Walls: y=0 is border, y=1 is not. Internal: (5,1) is obstacle, but (2,1) not, so should be free.\n\nL to (1,2) – but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nR to (3,2) – free? (3,2) not snake, not wall.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,2): D to (2,1) or R to (3,2), since U reverse not allowed, L to wall.\n\nNow, if I go to (2,2), I might go towards (1,1) food, but (1,1) is at (1,1), which is down-left from (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), to (1,1) is not adjacent; need to move left and down, but L to (1,2) is wall, so I cannot go directly to (1,1) from (2,2). (1,1) is adjacent to (1,2) and (2,1), but (1,2) is wall, so only accessible from (2,1) or (1,0), but (1,0) is border wall, y=0.\n\nSo (1,1) can only be accessed from (2,1), since (1,2) is wall, and (0,1) is border.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move D to (2,1), then from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1)? (1,1) from (2,1): moving left would be to (1,1), but (1,1) is not wall? (1,1) is a cell, not listed as wall or obstacle, so should be free.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) is different.\n\n(1,1) is not an obstacle, only (1,2) is.\n\nSo from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) to eat food.\n\nBut first, I need to get to (2,1).\n\nNow, back to decision on turn 65.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (3,3) on turn 65, then on turn 66 move U to (3,4) to eat (3,4) food.\n\n(3,4) food has life_span 7, after turn 64, it has 6 left, so on turn 66, it will have 5 left? Let's track life spans.\n\nCurrent turn 64: food (3,4) life_span=7, after turn 64, it decreases to 6.\n\nAfter turn 65, decreases to 5.\n\nAfter turn 66, decreases to 4, etc.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life_span=10, after turn 64: 9, turn 65:8, etc.\n\n(5,2) after turn 64: life_span 1, after turn 65: if not eaten, gone.\n\nSince I can't eat (5,2), it will disappear.\n\nNow, for (3,4), I can eat it on turn 66 if I go that way.\n\nIf I go down to (2,2) on turn 65, then I can go to (2,1) on turn 66, then to (1,1) on turn 67 to eat (1,1) food.\n\nBut (1,1) has many turns left, so less urgent.\n\nMoreover, going to (3,4) might be better because it's closer and I can eat it sooner.\n\nBut let's think about the grid and possible dangers.\n\nFirst, after eating (3,4), the snake will be longer, and I need to avoid collisions.\n\nAlso, there are obstacles.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (3,4) might be under the body? Currently, after turn 64, is (3,4) occupied?\n\nAfter turn 64 positions: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\n(3,4) not in list, so not under body, it's free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is free.\n\nNow, but when I move to (3,4), it should be fine.\n\nBut after eating, the snake body might cause issues.\n\nLet's plan the moves.\n\nFirst, for turn 64, I must move R to (2,3), as established.\n\nThen turn 65: I need to choose between R to (3,3) or D to (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (3,3) on turn 65, then turn 66 to (3,4) to eat.\n\nThen after that, head at (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), but D is reverse, not allowed, L to (2,4), or R to (4,4).\n\nNow, (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\n(4,4) is currently body? After eating at (3,4), positions include (4,4) as part of body, but when I move from (3,4), (4,4) might not be adjacent.\n\nAfter eating at turn 66: head at (3,4), body: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) tail.\n\nNow from (3,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,5): is (3,5) free? Currently, (3,5) not in positions, not wall? Walls: internal obstacles don't include (3,5), borders ok, so free.\n\n- D to (3,3): but (3,3) is body segment, and it's adjacent, so moving there would collide. Also, reverse direction not allowed.\n\n- L to (2,4): (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\n- R to (4,4): (4,4) is the tail, but in snake, moving to tail cell is ok only if the tail moves away, but here, since I just ate, tail is at (4,4), and if I move to (4,4), head goes to (4,4), which was tail, but since tail would move if no eat, but here, if I don't eat, tail moves, but I am moving to it.\n\nStandard rule: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by the tail, and the tail will move away in the same turn, it is safe, because the tail vacates the cell before head arrives? No.\n\nIn snake, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is the current tail position, and no food is eaten, then the tail moves away, so the cell is vacated, and head can move there without collision, because the tail leaves just before head enters.\n\nBut if the cell has food, and I eat, then tail doesn't move, so if head moves to tail with food, it collides.\n\nBut here, (4,4) has no food, it's just the tail position.\n\nFrom (3,4), R to (4,4): (4,4) is the current tail position.\n\nIf I move there, and since (4,4) has no food (I assume, food is at other places), so if I move to (4,4), I do not eat food, so the tail is removed, and head moves to (4,4), which is safe because the tail was there but leaves.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, tail at (4,4).\n\nHead at (3,4) moves to (4,4).\n\nNew head at (4,4), and since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the cell (4,4) is now head, and the previous tail is gone.\n\nNo collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to a body cell, collision.\n\nBut tail is ok if no food.\n\nIn this case, moving to (4,4) should be safe.\n\nBut (4,4) is adjacent to head? From (3,4) to (4,4) is right, which is possible.\n\nNow, U to (3,5) is also possible.\n\nL to (2,4) is wall.\n\nD to (3,3) is body and reverse, not possible.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5) or R to (4,4).\n\nIf I go to (4,4), then head at (4,4), and so on.\n\nBut let's think about the other path.\n\nFirst, back to turn 65 decision.\n\nIf I go down to (2,2) on turn 65.\n\nFrom (2,3) move D to (2,2) on turn 65.\n\nThen new head (2,2), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), ..., up to (4,4), and tail (4,3) removed? After turn 64, positions include (4,3) as tail.\n\nAfter move to (2,2): new head (2,2), body: (2,3) (previous head), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)  // tail at (4,4)\n\n(4,3) is removed.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf I move to (2,1), then head at (2,1), direction D.\n\nThen from there, I can move L to (1,1) to eat food, since (1,1) is adjacent and has food.\n\nMove L to (1,1): from (2,1) to (1,1), which is left.\n\nThen eat (1,1) food.\n\nBut when I move to (1,1), I eat the food, so snake grows.\n\nBut (1,1) is near the corner and walls.\n\nAfter eating, head at (1,1), and body includes previous positions.\n\nBut let's see if it's possible.\n\nFirst, from (2,2), on turn 65, move to (2,1) or (3,2).\n\nIf I go to (2,1), then turn 66 move L to (1,1) to eat.\n\nBut (1,1) has life_span 10, after turn 64:9, turn 65:8, turn 66:7, so plenty of time.\n\nBut going to (3,4) is faster to eat food.\n\nMoreover, (3,4) is closer to current position.\n\nNow, but there might be a risk with the snake body.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,4) has lower life_span than (1,1), 7 vs 10, but both have many turns.\n\n(3,4) has 7, after turn 64:6, so I can eat on turn 66, which is soon.\n\n(1,1) I can eat later.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eating any positive food is good, but since all are +1, I should eat when possible.\n\nBut also, after eating, snake is longer, which might make movement harder.\n\nBut I have to eat to score.\n\nNow, let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 64: must move R to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 65: I can choose.\n\nOption A: Move R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 66: Move U to (3,4) to eat food. Score +1, length 14.\n\nThen from (3,4), as above, I can move U to (3,5) or R to (4,4)\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,6), but (3,6) is body? After eating at (3,4), positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) tail.\n\n(3,6) is body segment.\n\nFrom (3,4) move U to (3,5): new head (3,5), no food, so tail removed, new positions: head (3,5), body: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  // tail at (5,4)\n\nThen from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6) — (3,6) is now body? In new positions, (3,6) is body segment, so moving there would collide.\n\nD to (3,4) — reverse, not allowed.\n\nL to (2,5) — (2,5) is body, and not adjacent directly? (2,5) from (3,5) is left and down? Not adjacent; adjacent are U (3,6), D (3,4), L (2,5)? (2,5) is at x=2,y=5, from (3,5) left to (2,5), which is adjacent? (3,5) to (2,5) is left, yes, same y, x-1.\n\n(2,5) is body segment, so moving there collision.\n\nR to (4,5) — (4,5) is body? In positions, (4,5) is body, so collision.\n\nAll moves from (3,5) seem blocked.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail.\n\nNeighbors of (3,5):\n\n- U: (3,6) — occupied by body, collision\n\n- D: (3,4) — occupied by body, and reverse direction, not allowed\n\n- L: (2,5) — occupied by body, collision\n\n- R: (4,5) — occupied by body, collision\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), which is body, yes.\n\nSo from (3,5), all adjacent cells are occupied or not possible, so I would die immediately on the next turn.\n\nThat's a problem.\n\nIf after eating at (3,4), I move R to (4,4) instead.\n\nFrom (3,4) move R to (4,4): (4,4) is the tail position.\n\nSince no food there, moving to tail is safe, as tail moves away.\n\nNew head at (4,4), and tail is removed, so positions: head (4,4), body: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  // tail at (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is tail.\n\nThen from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nNow, (4,5) is body, so U to (4,5) collision.\n\nD to (4,3) — (4,3) not in positions? After move, positions have (4,4) head, (3,4), etc., (4,3) not listed. Earlier, (4,3) was removed when we moved to (3,3) or something? Let's trace.\n\nIn this position, after moving to (4,4), body includes (3,4), (3,3), ..., (5,5), (5,4), so (4,3) is not occupied.\n\n(4,3) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is body, so L to (3,4) is body, collision, and reverse? Current direction after move to (4,4) is R, so L is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n\nR to (5,4) — (5,4) is tail, but tail position.\n\nMoving to (5,4): since no food, it should be safe.\n\n(5,4) is tail, so head moves to (5,4), tail is removed, no collision.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nD to (4,3) might be free.\n\n(4,3) is not in current positions, not wall, so free.\n\nSimilarly, U to (4,5) is body.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,4): D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nIf move D to (4,3), head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nBack to the critical point.\n\nIf I go to (3,4) and then move U to (3,5), I get stuck and die.\n\nTherefore, after eating at (3,4), I should not move U; instead, move R to (4,4).\n\nThen from there, I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\n(4,3) is free, as above.\n\n(5,4) is tail, moving there is ok.\n\nNow, let's consider the other option for turn 65: moving down to (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,3) move D to (2,2) on turn 65.\n\nNew head (2,2), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3) tail removed? Tail was (4,3), removed.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)  // tail at (4,4)\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nSuppose I move D to (2,1) on turn 65.\n\nNew head (2,1), body: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) tail.\n\nThen turn 66, from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) to eat food, since (1,1) has food.\n\nMove L to (1,1): new head (1,1), eat food, so grow.\n\nNew positions: head (1,1), body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)  // 14 segments, tail at (4,4)\n\nThen from (1,1), head at (1,1), direction L (since last move left).\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,2), but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nD to (1,0), but y=0 is border wall, cannot.\n\nL to (0,1), x=0 border wall, cannot.\n\nR to (2,1), but (2,1) is now body segment, and adjacent, so collision. Also, reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (2,1), but it's body, so I die immediately.\n\nStuck again.\n\nIf from (2,1), I don't move to (1,1), but go elsewhere, but I want to eat the food.\n\nBut if I move to (1,1), I get stuck.\n\nTherefore, eating (1,1) leads to a dead end because (1,1) has only one exit, which is to (2,1), but after eating, (2,1) is body, so I cannot move back.\n\nThus, it's dangerous to eat (1,1) when the snake is long, as it blocks the only exit.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (1,1), I have no moves, so death.\n\nTherefore, I should avoid going to (1,1) for now.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,4), if I eat it and move up, I die, but if I move right, I might survive.\n\nNow, back to turn 65.\n\nIf I move to (3,3) on turn 65, then to (3,4) on turn 66 to eat, then from (3,4), I must move R to (4,4) to avoid death.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) might be body or not.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4) on turn 66 after eating? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 65: move from (2,3) to (3,3)  // head now (3,3), no eat\n\nTurn 66: move U to (3,4)  // eat food, head at (3,4), grow to 14\n\nThen turn 67: move from (3,4) to (4,4)  // since moving R to (4,4), which was tail, but no food, so safe, tail removed\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), body: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  // tail at (5,4)\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4)\n\nIf move R to (5,4): (5,4) is tail, moving there, no food, so safe, new head (5,4), tail removed, positions: head (5,4), body: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)  // tail at (5,5)\n\nThen from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), but (5,5) is body, collision.\n\nD to (5,3) — (5,3) not occupied, not wall? Walls: internal (5,1) but (5,3) not, borders ok, so free.\n\nL to (4,4) — body, collision, and reverse not allowed.\n\nR to (6,4) — but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nSo only D to (5,3) possible.\n\nThen move to (5,3), etc.\n\nIf from (4,4) I move D to (4,3) instead.\n\n(4,3) is free, move to (4,3), head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nBut the key point is that by moving right after eating (3,4), I can survive.\n\nNow, if I had chosen to go down on turn 65, to (2,2), then I might be tempted to go to (1,1), but that leads to death, so I should avoid it.\n\nFrom (2,2), I could move R to (3,2) instead of D to (2,1).\n\nThen head at (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut then I might not eat food soon, and (3,4) might disappear later, but it has life span 7, after turn 64:6, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nPerhaps eating (3,4) is better.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (1,1), but it's risky to eat.\n\nAnother thing: the Tail Reward Danger, but not applicable here.\n\nFor turn 65, moving to (3,3) allows me to eat (3,4) soon and potentially survive.\n\nMoving to (2,2) might lead to a dead end or delay.\n\nAlso, on turn 65, if I move to (3,3), I am closer to the center, which might have more space.\n\n(2,2) is near the wall and obstacle.\n\nSo probably better to move right to (3,3) on turn 65.\n\nThen turn 66 to (3,4) to eat.\n\nThen turn 67 to (4,4) to avoid the trap.\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output moves starting from turn 64.\n\nTurn 64: must move R\n\nTurn 65: move R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 66: move U to (3,4) to eat\n\nThen for turn 67, move R to (4,4)\n\nBut the answer should be actions for turns, and I need at least 5 turns ahead? The user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the answer format is to list actions for the turns starting from t1.\n\nCurrent turn t1=64, so I need to output actions for turn 64, 65, 66, ... but how many? The format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns. Probably, I should list a sequence, but since it's planning ahead, I might list 5 moves or so.\n\nBut the state might change after moves, so I should plan the immediate moves with consideration of future.\n\nBut for output, I need to specify actions for each turn starting from 64.\n\nSince I must move R on 64, then on 65 I choose R, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can list turns 64 to 68 or something.\n\nBut let's define the sequence.\n\nTurn 64: move R (only choice)\n\nTurn 65: move R (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 66: move U (to (3,4) to eat food)\n\nThen for turn 67: from (3,4), move R to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 68: from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4), but earlier we saw moving R to (5,4) is possible, then to (5,3), etc.\n\nTo be specific.\n\nAfter turn 66 eat at (3,4), positions as before.\n\nTurn 67: move R to (4,4)  // no eat, tail removed\n\nNow head at (4,4), body: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nTail at (5,4)\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4)\n\nIf move R to (5,4), then as before, only D to (5,3) next.\n\nMove to (5,4): new head (5,4), tail removed, positions: head (5,4), body: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n\nThen turn 68: from (5,4), move D to (5,3)  // only choice, as U to (5,5) body, etc.\n\n(5,3) free, move to (5,3)\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nIf I move D from (4,4) to (4,3) on turn 67.\n\n(4,3) free, move to (4,3), head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: from (4,3), U to (4,4) reverse not allowed, D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\n(4,4) is body, so U not possible.\n\nD to (4,2): free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nL to (3,3): body, collision.\n\nR to (5,3): free.\n\nSo move D or R.\n\nBut not critical.\n\nFor the sequence, I can list up to turn 68 or so.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output for the current turn and a few ahead.\n\nSince on turn 65 I have a choice, and I decided to move R to go for the food.\n\nTo maximize score, eating (3,4) is good.\n\n(1,1) is risky, so avoid for now.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: R\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nThen for turn 67, from (3,4), I need to move R to (4,4) to survive.\n\nTurn 67: R\n\nThen turn 68: from (4,4), say move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4), but let's choose one, say move R to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 69: from (5,4) move D to (5,3)\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, but for the box, I should list a sequence.\n\nPerhaps list turns 64 to 68.\n\nSince the user said \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it's \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should list multiple.\n\nBut for turn 64, action is R.\n\nTurn 65: R\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nThen turn 67: R (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 68: from (4,4), move R to (5,4) or D to (4,3), both possible, but to be consistent, say R.\n\nBut after moving to (5,4), on turn 69 I must move D to (5,3), but not necessary to list.\n\nI think listing 4 or 5 moves is fine.\n\nSince after turn 66, I eat, and then move.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 66 I move U to eat.\n\nNow, to confirm, are there any other foods? (5,2) is gone.\n\n(1,1) is there but risky.\n\nPerhaps later I can find a way.\n\nBut for now, the plan is to eat (3,4) and then move right.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: R\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: R (to (4,4))\n\nThen for turn 68, I can say D or R, but let's specify.\n\nTo avoid potential issues, from (4,4) move D to (4,3) to go down.\n\nBut either is fine.\n\nI think for the output, I'll list up to turn 67 or 68.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but output for immediate turns.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: R\nTurn 65: R\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: R\n}\n\nBut turn 67 is to (4,4), which is safe.\n\nThen the snake can continue.\n\nI could add more.\n\nBut I think it's sufficient.\n\nIn the state, there is internal obstacle at (6,4), (5,1), etc., but not affecting now.\n\nSo I think moving R on 64 and 65, U on 66, R on 67 is a plan.\n\nOn turn 65, if I move D to (2,2), I might not eat soon and miss opportunities.\n\nSo better to go for the food.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n</think>\nBased on the current state and the need to maximize score while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned the moves for the next 5 turns (turns 64 to 68), thinking ahead to avoid risks and prioritize eating available positive food. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Turn 64**: The snake head is at (1,3) with direction down (D). The only safe and legal move is right (R) to (2,3), as other directions lead to walls or body collisions.\n- **Turn 65**: From (2,3), moving right (R) to (3,3) positions the snake to eat the food at (3,4) on the next turn. Moving down (D) to (2,2) is possible but delays eating and risks dead ends near (1,1).\n- **Turn 66**: From (3,3), move up (U) to (3,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases). This food has a low remaining life span (after turn 64, life span=6; after turn 65, it decreases to 5), so eating it now is efficient.\n- **Turn 67**: After eating at (3,4), moving right (R) to (4,4) is safe and avoids the risk of getting trapped if moving up to (3,5). (4,4) is the tail position, but since no food is eaten, the tail moves away safely.\n- **Turn 68**: From (4,4), moving down (D) to (4,3) is chosen for exploration and to avoid potential body collisions. Moving right (R) to (5,4) is also safe but leads to fewer options next turn.\n\nThis sequence eats the food at (3,4) on turn 66, maximizing immediate score while ensuring the snake survives beyond 5 turns. The food at (5,2) is ignored as it disappears after turn 65 and is unreachable. The food at (1,1) is not pursued due to high risk of collision after eating (e.g., only one exit). Future moves beyond turn 68 can focus on exploring the grid for other food.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: R  \nTurn 65: R  \nTurn 66: U  \nTurn 67: R  \nTurn 68: D  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 65. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So, these cells are blocked and I can't move into them.\n\nSnake positions: the head is at (2,3), and the body segments follow: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3). That's 13 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (2,3)\n\n- Then (1,3)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,3)  // This is the tail? Positions are given from head to tail, so (4,3) is the tail.\n\nSnake head direction is R, meaning it just moved right to (2,3), I assume from (1,3)? Let's see: previous position must have been left of (2,3), but since it's moving right, it came from (1,3) to (2,3). But (1,3) is the first body segment, so that makes sense.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (5,2) with life span 1, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,4) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan moves for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll make an 8x8 grid in my mind.\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,3)\n\nBody: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nTail is (4,3)\n\nFood: (5,2), (3,4), (1,1)\n\nCurrent head direction is R (right).\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: U (up to y+1, so (2,4)? Let's confirm coordinates. Usually, in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but in snake games, often (0,0) is top-left, with y increasing down or up?\n\nThe movement: U is (x, y+1), which might imply y increases up or down? Let's read.\n\n\"U`(x,y+1)`\" — it says U (x,y+1). But in standard coordinates, if (0,0) is bottom-left, y+1 would be up, but sometimes it's top-left with y down. I need to clarify.\n\nThe problem says: \"U`(x,y+1)`\", and D`(x,y-1)`, so if y+1 is up, then y increases upwards, but that might be unusual. Let's see the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: head (2,3), then (1,3) — same y, x decreased, so left. Then (1,4) — x same, y increased? From (1,3) to (1,4), y from 3 to 4, and U is (x,y+1), so if y+1 means moving to higher y, that might be downward if (0,0) is top-left.\n\nI think I need to assume a coordinate system. In many grid-based games, (0,0) is top-left corner, with x increasing right, y increasing down. So U (up) would decrease y, but here it says U (x,y+1), which would be increasing y, so that must be downward.\n\nLet's confirm with the movement definitions:\n\n- U: (x, y+1) — so y increases as you go up? But that's counterintuitive. Perhaps y increases downward.\n\nLook at the snake: from head (2,3) to (1,3) — that's left, x decreased. Then to (1,4) — y increased from 3 to 4. If y increases down, then (1,4) is below (1,3). Similarly, (1,5) is even lower.\n\nThen (2,5) — x increased, y same as (1,5), so right. Then (2,6) — y increased, so down again. Then (3,6) — x increased, right. And so on.\n\nAlso, walls: y=0 and y=7 borders. If y increases down, y=0 is top row, y=7 is bottom row.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo, U: (x, y+1) means moving down, because y+1 increases the row number down.\n\nD: (x, y-1) means moving up, decreasing row number.\n\nL: (x-1, y) left\n\nR: (x+1, y) right\n\nBut that might be confusing. Let's standardize: I'll think of y increasing downward, so U (up) should be decreasing y, but here U is defined as (x,y+1), which is increasing y, so that must be downward. So the direction names are misleading.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll use the coordinate changes:\n\n- Move U: (x, y+1) — so cell with same x, higher y, which is downward if y=0 top.\n\n- Move D: (x, y-1) — same x, lower y, upward.\n\n- L: (x-1, y) — left\n\n- R: (x+1, y) — right\n\nAnd since the head direction is given as R, meaning it moved right to (2,3), so from (1,3) to (2,3).\n\nCurrent head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3):\n\n- U: (2,3+1) = (2,4)\n\n- D: (2,3-1) = (2,2)\n\n- L: (2-1,3) = (1,3)\n\n- R: (2+1,3) = (3,3)\n\nBut L to (1,3) is the body segment, so if I move there, it would be a collision unless it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n\nCollision rules: head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail cell because the tail will move, so it's safe if you're moving to where the tail is and the tail moves off.\n\nSpecifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, in this case, the tail is at (4,3), not (1,3). (1,3) is the first body segment after head, so it's not the tail.\n\nSnake positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)] so tail is (4,3).\n\nFrom head (2,3), moving to (1,3) would be moving onto the second segment, which is not the tail, so it would be a body collision, deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving to other body cells is deadly.\n\nNow, possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,4): is this free? Let's see what's at (2,4). From snake positions, (2,4) is not listed, so it might be empty or food.\n\nFood is at (5,2), (3,4), (1,1), so (2,4) not food.\n\nAlso, walls: internal obstacles, (2,4) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Oh, (2,4) is an internal obstacle! So it's a wall, can't move there.\n\nInternal obstacles include (2,4), so (2,4) is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, D to (2,2): is (2,2) free? Not in snake positions, not a food position, not an obstacle. Obstacles: (1,2) is one, but (2,2) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nL to (1,3): that's the body segment, so collision, deadly.\n\nR to (3,3): not in snake positions, not a wall? Walls: borders and internal, (3,3) not listed, so free.\n\nAlso, is (3,3) food? Food at (5,2), (3,4), (1,1), no.\n\nSo possible safe moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nU to (2,4) is wall, L to (1,3) is body, not safe.\n\nSo only D or R.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food: (5,2) with life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current. Turn 65, life span 1, so after this turn, it might disappear if not eaten.\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it lasts for L more turns including current? Let's read.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, for food at turn t with life_span L, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn 65, life_span 1, it will disappear after turn 65, so it can be eaten only on turn 65. After turn 65, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, life_span 6: disappears after 6 turns, so from turn 65, it will be gone after turn 70? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" — after N turns from now? Or after N total?\n\nTypically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, after this turn, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown=0, it disappears.\n\nBut \"disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\nFor food at (5,2): life_span 1 at turn 65. After turn 65, countdown decreases to 0, and it disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 65, if the snake moves to (5,2) on turn 65.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) life_span 6: at turn 65, countdown 6, after turn 65, countdown 5, and so on, until after turn 70, countdown 0, disappears? After turn 65, countdown 5; after turn 66, countdown 4; ... after turn 70, countdown 0, disappears at the end of turn 70 or beginning of turn 71? But it can be eaten on turn 70 if head moves there.\n\nSince countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, it can be eaten only if countdown >0, and after eaten or countdown=0, it's gone.\n\nFor (5,2) at turn 65: life_span 1, so on turn 65, if not eaten, after this turn it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) life_span 6: will be available for turns 65 to 70 inclusive, disappearing after turn 70.\n\nTurn 65: countdown 6, present\n\nTurn 66: countdown 5, present\n\n...\n\nTurn 70: countdown 1, present? After turn 70, countdown 0, gone.\n\nAt turn t, with life_span L, it is present for that turn, and the countdown decreases at the end of the turn or during?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — I think it means that during the turn, when we process, the life_span is the remaining turns, including the current turn.\n\nSo for (5,2) at turn 65: life_span 1, so it can be eaten on turn 65, and after turn 65, it is removed.\n\nIf not eaten on turn 65, it's gone.\n\nFor (3,4): life_span 6, can be eaten on turns 65,66,67,68,69,70, and after turn 70, gone.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life_span 9, available until turn 73.\n\nNow, back to possible moves.\n\nFrom (2,3), safe moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf I move R to (3,3), that might be towards some food.\n\nFood at (3,4) is close, but (3,4) is one cell up from (3,3), but up is U, which is (x,y+1), so from (3,3), U to (3,4) would be to the food, but I need to get to (3,3) first.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,2) is down and right, but life span 1, so only this turn.\n\n(5,2) is at turn 65, must be eaten now or never.\n\nBut can I reach (5,2) from (2,3) in one move? No, it's at (5,2), I'm at (2,3), so (3,3) is closer but not directly.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (5,2) is not adjacent; it's three cells away in x and one in y, so not reachable now.\n\nSo I can't eat (5,2) this turn; it's too far. So it will disappear after this turn.\n\nNow, (3,4) is at (3,4), which is adjacent to head position? Head at (2,3), (3,4) is one right and one up? From (2,3), R to (3,3), then U to (3,4) would be to the food.\n\nBut U from (2,3) to (2,4) is blocked by wall.\n\nSo I can't go directly to (3,4) from (2,3).\n\nPossible paths.\n\nFirst, let's list all current food:\n\n- (5,2): life 1, will disappear after this turn, can't be reached now, so ignore.\n\n- (3,4): life 6, at (3,4), value 1\n\n- (1,1): life 9, at (1,1), value 1\n\nNow, snake head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nSafe moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nIf I move R to (3,3), then from there, I can go U to (3,4) to eat the food, but (3,4) is food, so if I move to (3,4), I eat it.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, let's think about the grid state.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nAlso, borders walls.\n\nNow, from (3,3), moving U to (3,4) is possible, since (3,4) is not a wall, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nBut when I move to (3,4), I eat the food, so snake grows.\n\nBut I need to consider the tail and body.\n\nAlso, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, tail is at (4,3), head at (2,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,3) and (4,3) are not adjacent; they are two cells apart.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, if I go to (3,3) now, turn 65.\n\nThen on turn 66, from (3,3), I can go U to (3,4) to eat the food.\n\nBut when I eat, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 65: move R to (3,3). Head moves to (3,3), body follows: the segment at (1,3) moves to where head was? Snake movement: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, tail moves off.\n\nAfter move R to (3,3):\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nBody: the previous head (2,3) becomes new first body segment, then (1,3) becomes second, but positions shift.\n\nAfter moving, the snake positions will be: head at new position, then the previous head position, then the rest except the tail if no food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten, tail moves off.\n\nCurrent positions before move: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)]\n\nAfter moving R to (3,3):\n\nHead moves to (3,3)\n\nThen the body: the first segment moves to previous head position (2,3)\n\nSecond segment moves to previous first body position (1,3)\n\nBut (1,3) is occupied, but it moves to the position.\n\nThe list: new head: (3,3)\n\nThen the previous segments except the tail is removed? When no food, tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head at (3,3), then the first body at (2,3), then (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) — and tail was (4,3), which is not included, so snake has one less segment? No.\n\nOriginal positions: 13 segments.\n\nAfter move without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nNew positions: head at (3,3), body at (2,3) (previous head), then (1,3) (previous first body), then (1,4) (previous second body), ..., up to (5,4) which was the second last, and (4,4) becomes the new tail? Let's list:\n\nPrevious: index 0: (2,3) head\n\n1: (1,3)\n\n2: (1,4)\n\n3: (1,5)\n\n4: (2,5)\n\n5: (2,6)\n\n6: (3,6)\n\n7: (4,6)\n\n8: (4,5)\n\n9: (5,5)\n\n10: (5,4)\n\n11: (4,4)\n\n12: (4,3) tail\n\nAfter move R to (3,3): new head at (3,3)\n\nNew body 1: previous head (2,3)\n\nNew body 2: previous body 1 (1,3)\n\nNew body 3: previous body 2 (1,4)\n\nNew body 4: previous body 3 (1,5)\n\nNew body 5: previous body 4 (2,5)\n\nNew body 6: previous body 5 (2,6)\n\nNew body 7: previous body 6 (3,6)\n\nNew body 8: previous body 7 (4,6)\n\nNew body 9: previous body 8 (4,5)\n\nNew body 10: previous body 9 (5,5)\n\nNew body 11: previous body 10 (5,4)\n\nNew body 12: previous body 11 (4,4)  // new tail\n\nPrevious tail (4,3) is left, not part of snake.\n\nSo snake positions after turn 65 move R: [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTail at (4,4)\n\nNow, on turn 66, head at (3,3), I can move U to (3,4) to eat the food there.\n\n(3,4) is food, so when I move to it, I eat it, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (3,4), and the body includes all previous segments, with tail staying.\n\nSo positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) and since eaten, tail doesn't move, so (4,4) is still there, but a new segment is added? When you eat, the snake grows, so the tail remains, and a new segment is added at the head, but the head moves to the food, so the previous head becomes part of the body.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move that turn, so the snake gains one segment.\n\nSo from above positions before move: [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nMove U to (3,4), eat food.\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nThen the body: previous head (3,3) becomes first body, then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) and since eaten, tail stays, so (4,4) is still part, and no new segment added? Positions now: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) — that's 14 segments, with tail at (4,4).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, after eating, the food at (3,4) is consumed, so removed.\n\nNow, other food: (1,1) still there.\n\nBut is this safe? Moving to (3,4) seems fine.\n\nBut let's see the direction. When I move from (3,3) to (3,4), that's U, and previous direction: after turn 65 move R to (3,3), so direction is R. Now moving U, which is not opposite, so ok.\n\nNow, after that, head at (3,4), direction U.\n\nBut I need to think longer term.\n\nAlternative move: from (2,3), I could move D to (2,2).\n\nThen on turn 65, move D to (2,2).\n\nNew head: (2,2)\n\nBody: (2,3) (previous head), then (1,3), (1,4), ..., up to (4,4) as new tail, similar to above.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can go to where? Possible moves: U to (2,3) but that's the body, collision. D to (2,1): is it free? (2,1) not wall, not snake? After move, snake has (2,2), (2,3), etc, so (2,1) not occupied. Walls: internal (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,1) not, so D to (2,1) possible. L to (1,2): but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall. R to (3,2): free, I think.\n\n(3,2) not in walls or snake.\n\nSo from (2,2), safe moves: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nBut (2,1) is near bottom, y=1, borders y=0 is wall.\n\nFood at (1,1) or (3,4), but (3,4) is up.\n\nIf I go to (2,2), I might go towards (1,1) but (1,1) is at (1,1), from (2,2) I can go L to (1,2) but (1,2) is wall, or D to (2,1), then from (2,1) to (1,1) is L, but (1,1) is adjacent? From (2,1) to (1,1) is L, and (1,1) not wall, so possible.\n\nBut let's compare the options.\n\nFirst, if I go R to (3,3) on turn 65, then U to (3,4) on turn 66 to eat food, getting +1.\n\nThen head at (3,4), with direction U.\n\nNow, from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\nNow, (3,5): not wall, not snake? After eating, positions include (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), etc, but (3,5) not listed, should be free.\n\nD to (3,3): but (3,3) is the first body segment, so if I move there, collision, unless it's the tail.\n\nTail is at (4,4), so (3,3) is body, not tail, so collision if move D.\n\nL to (2,4): (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so can't.\n\nR to (4,4): (4,4) is the tail? In positions after eating: head (3,4), body: (3,3), (2,3), ..., (4,4) is the last, tail.\n\n(4,4) is tail, so moving to (4,4) is possible because tail will move away if no eat, but if I move to tail, and eat food? (4,4) has no food, it's part of snake.\n\n(4,4) is the tail cell, but there is no food there; the food was at (3,4), eaten.\n\nSo moving to (4,4) is moving to the tail cell, which is safe because tail will move off.\n\nBut in this case, from (3,4) to (4,4) is R, same as previous? Previous move was U to (3,4), so direction U? Head direction after move to (3,4) is U.\n\nMoving R to (4,4) is not opposite, so ok.\n\nNow, what is at (4,4)? It's the tail, but no food, so moving there is safe; head moves to (4,4), tail moves off, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, U to (3,5) or D to (3,3) but D to (3,3) is body, not safe.\n\nSo from (3,4), safe moves: U to (3,5) or R to (4,4).\n\nNow, if I go U to (3,5), then to (3,6) but (3,6) is body? After positions: (3,6) is a body segment, so if I go to (3,6), it might be collision.\n\nAfter eating at (3,4), positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nSo (3,6) is there, at index 8 or so.\n\n(3,5) is free, I think.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go U to (3,6), but (3,6) is occupied by body, so collision.\n\nD to (3,4) but that's head, not possible.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) is occupied, body.\n\nR to (4,5): (4,5) is occupied, body.\n\nSo from (3,5), the only possible move might be to (3,6) or others, but all adjacent might be body or walls.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- U (3,5+1)=(3,6): occupied by body, collision\n\n- D (3,5-1)=(3,4): head position, but not accessible, move to same cell? No, head is at (3,4), but when moving from (3,5), D to (3,4) is where the head was, but now it's body, and not tail, so collision.\n\n- L (2,5): occupied, body\n\n- R (4,5): occupied, body\n\nSo all moves from (3,5) are into body or invalid, so death.\n\nTherefore, from (3,4), I cannot move to (3,5) because then I'm trapped and die.\n\nOnly safe move is R to (4,4).\n\nTo (4,4), which is the tail.\n\nNow, moving to (4,4) from (3,4): since (4,4) is tail, and no food there, head moves to (4,4), tail moves off, so it's safe.\n\nAfter move: head at (4,4), body: previous head (3,4) becomes first body, then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) and tail was (4,4) but head moved there, and since no eat, tail moves off, so the new tail is (5,4) or something.\n\nPrevious positions before move: head (3,4), body (3,3), (2,3), ..., (5,4), (4,4) tail\n\nAfter moving R to (4,4): head at (4,4)\n\nSince no food, tail moves off, so new body: (3,4) (prev head), (3,3) (prev body1), (2,3) (prev body2), ..., up to (5,4) (prev second last), and (4,4) is now head, so the segment that was at (4,4) is gone.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) // new tail at (5,4)\n\n(5,4) was there, now tail.\n\nNow, from (4,4), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nBack to turn 65 choice.\n\nIf I go R to (3,3) on turn 65, then on turn 66 I eat at (3,4), then on turn 67 from (3,4) I must move to (4,4) to avoid death, as above.\n\nThen from (4,4), head at (4,4), direction after move to (4,4) is R.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nNow, (4,5): is it free? In positions, (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (4,3): (4,3) not in current positions, should be free? After above, positions have (4,4), (3,4), etc, not (4,3), so free.\n\nL to (3,4): but (3,4) is the first body segment, so collision.\n\nR to (5,4): (5,4) is tail, so can move there.\n\nSo from (4,4), safe moves: D to (4,3) or R to (5,4)\n\nIf I go to (5,4), which is tail, safe.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut let's see the other option from turn 65.\n\nIf on turn 65 I move D to (2,2).\n\nThen new head at (2,2)\n\nPositions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) // tail at (4,4)\n\nNow, from (2,2), I can move D to (2,1) or R to (3,2), as I thought.\n\nIf I go to (2,1), then from there, I can go L to (1,1) to eat the food, since (1,1) is food.\n\n(1,1) has life span 9, so available.\n\nOn turn 65, I moved to (2,2), no eat.\n\nTurn 66, from (2,2), I can move to (2,1) or (3,2).\n\nIf I move D to (2,1), then (2,1) is not food, so no eat.\n\nThen on turn 67, from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) to eat the food.\n\n(1,1) is food, so eat it.\n\nBut need to check if safe.\n\nFirst, from (2,1) to (1,1): L move.\n\nPrevious direction from (2,2) to (2,1) is D, so moving L is not opposite, ok.\n\nThen after eating at (1,1), snake grows.\n\nBut there is a potential issue: the cell (1,1) might be under the body or something, but in this case, it's not.\n\nAlso, tail is at (4,4), far away.\n\nSo eating at (1,1) should be fine.\n\nThen head at (1,1), and so on.\n\nBut let's compare the two plans.\n\nPlan A: turn 65 move R to (3,3), turn 66 move U to (3,4) eat +1, then turn 67 move R to (4,4) to avoid trap.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go to (4,3) or (5,4), etc.\n\nBut I have to think about long-term survival.\n\nThere is food at (1,1) with long life, so I can go there later.\n\nAnother thing: after eating at (3,4), the snake is longer, and the area might be cramped.\n\nLet's list the occupied cells after eating at (3,4) on turn 66.\n\nPositions: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nSo the snake occupies many cells in the top-left area.\n\nFrom (4,4), if I move to (4,3), which is free, then I can explore down.\n\nOr to (5,4), but (5,4) is tail, so moving there is safe, but then head at (5,4), etc.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(1,2) is wall, near (1,1).\n\nIf I go to (1,1) later, I need to be careful.\n\nBut in plan B, if I go to (2,2) on turn 65, then to (2,1) on turn 66, then to (1,1) on turn 67 to eat.\n\nOn turn 65: move D to (2,2)\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) tail\n\nTurn 66: move D to (2,1)\n\nNew head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) // tail at (5,4)\n\nTurn 67: move L to (1,1) to eat food.\n\n(1,1) is food, so eat.\n\nNew head (1,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) and since eaten, tail stays, so (5,4) is still part, 14 segments.\n\nNow, head at (1,1), direction L (since moved left from (2,1)).\n\nPossible moves: from (1,1), U to (1,2), but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, can't.\n\nD to (1,0), but y=0 is border wall, can't.\n\nL to (0,1), but x=0 border wall, can't.\n\nR to (2,1), but (2,1) is the first body segment, collision.\n\nOh no! All moves are invalid or deadly.\n\nU to (1,2) wall, D to (1,0) wall, L to (0,1) wall, R to (2,1) body collision.\n\nSo snake is trapped and dies immediately after eating at (1,1).\n\nThat's bad. So moving to (1,1) is a death trap because it's surrounded by walls and the body.\n\nTherefore, plan B is dangerous; I should not go to (1,1) at all, or at least not until the body has moved away.\n\nIn this case, with the current snake position, going to (1,1) leads to death.\n\nSo better to avoid that food for now.\n\nTherefore, on turn 65, moving D to (2,2) is risky because it might lead me to (1,1) which is a trap.\n\nFrom (2,2), I could move R to (3,2) instead.\n\nOn turn 65 move D to (2,2)\n\nThen on turn 66, from (2,2), I can move R to (3,2) or D to (2,1).\n\nIf I move R to (3,2), then head at (3,2).\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach other food.\n\nFood at (3,4) is still there, but from (3,2), I can go U to (3,3) or to (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) has life span 6, so I have time.\n\nBut in this path, I didn't eat the (3,4) food yet.\n\nBack to turn 65 choice.\n\nIf I move R to (3,3) on turn 65, then on turn 66 I eat (3,4) for +1, then on turn 67 I move to (4,4) to survive.\n\nThen from (4,4), as before, I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\n(4,3) is free, I think.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4) on turn 67, positions: let's say from earlier.\n\nAfter turn 67 move to (4,4): head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail\n\nFrom (4,4), move D to (4,3)\n\n(4,3) not occupied, not wall, so safe.\n\nNew head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), etc., tail (5,4) moves off.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move to other cells, like down to (4,2) or left to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, etc.\n\nBut there is food at (5,2) but it's gone, or (1,1) but dangerous.\n\n(5,2) disappeared.\n\nOther food: only (1,1) left, but we saw it's a trap.\n\nBut (1,1) has life span 9, so I can leave it for later when the snake body has moved.\n\nCurrently, the snake is long and in the top-left, so (1,1) is cornered.\n\nI should avoid that area for now.\n\nPerhaps I can go to the right or bottom.\n\nAnother idea: from the start, on turn 65, move R to (3,3), then on turn 66, instead of eating (3,4), I could go elsewhere.\n\nBut (3,4) is food, I can eat it for score.\n\nBut let's see if there is a better long-term plan.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (3,4) immediately to keep options open, but it's there, and I can eat it safely as long as I move to (4,4) after.\n\nBut after eating, I have to deal with the long snake.\n\nMaybe I can avoid eating for now and go to a safer area.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so I should eat when possible.\n\nBut with the current position, the only safe moves are D or R from (2,3).\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), then from there, I can go to (3,2) or (2,1).\n\nIf I go to (3,2), then from (3,2), I can go U to (3,3) or R to (4,2) or D to (3,1), etc.\n\n(3,1) not wall, y=1, borders y=0 wall.\n\nInternal obstacles (5,1) and (6,1), so (3,1) free.\n\nThen from (3,2), U to (3,3) which might be occupied later.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (3,4).\n\nLife span 6, so I have until turn 70 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 9.\n\nBut (1,1) is dangerous to eat now.\n\nSo perhaps for turn 65, move R to (3,3) is better to position for eating (3,4).\n\nThen after eating and moving to (4,4), I can go down to (4,3), then to (4,2), etc.\n\nLet's list the grid with obstacles.\n\nGrid size 8x8, x0-7, y0-7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells.\n\nInternal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo free cells.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move D to (4,2), or L to (3,3) body, or R to (5,3), or U to (4,4) body.\n\nFrom (4,3), after moving there, body at (4,4), so U to (4,4) is body, not safe unless tail.\n\nBut (4,4) is body, not tail.\n\nSo only D to (4,2) or R to (5,3), etc.\n\n(4,2) free, (5,3) free.\n\nThen I can explore the bottom-right area.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) to (4,2), then to (4,1), but (4,1) free? Internal obstacles (5,1), so (4,1) free, but y=1, D to (4,0) wall.\n\nOr to (5,2) but no food.\n\nBut there might be new food spawn later, but the problem doesn't say about new food, so only existing food.\n\nOnly three food given, and (5,2) disappears after this turn.\n\nSo after turn 65, only two food: (3,4) and (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is risky.\n\nSo better to eat (3,4) for +1 and then maneuver to survive.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (3,4) and then avoid (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) might be eaten later when the tail moves.\n\nFor example, after moving down, the tail might free up space near (1,1).\n\nBut let's see the current tail movement.\n\nIn the sequence, when I move, the tail moves.\n\nIn plan A: turn 65 move R to (3,3), no eat, tail moves off (4,3)\n\nTurn 66 move U to (3,4) eat, tail stays at (4,4)\n\nTurn 67 move R to (4,4) which is tail, so head to (4,4), tail moves off, so (5,4) becomes tail or something.\n\nAfter turn 67 move to (4,4): positions as before.\n\nThen if I move D to (4,3) on turn 68, for example.\n\nHead to (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), etc.\n\nThen from (4,3), move D to (4,2) on turn 69.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe body near (1,1) will eventually move as the snake moves.\n\nFor example, the segment at (1,3) will move, so (1,1) might become accessible later.\n\nBut it's turn 65, and (1,1) life span 9, so until turn 73, plenty of time.\n\nSo I can eat (3,4) now and then go to open areas.\n\nFor turn 65, moving R to (3,3) seems better to get the food.\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), I might not get the food immediately.\n\nAnd (3,4) has shorter life, only 6 turns, so better to eat it while I can.\n\n(1,1) has longer life.\n\nSo on turn 65, I think move R to (3,3) is the best.\n\nThen turn 66 move U to (3,4) to eat.\n\nThen turn 67, from (3,4), I must move to (4,4) as the only safe move, since moving to (3,5) is death as earlier.\n\nIn the positions after eating at (3,4), the cell (3,5) is free, but moving there leads to death because all adjacent are occupied.\n\nSo only (4,4) is safe to move.\n\nSo turn 67 move R to (4,4).\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nNow, (5,4) is the tail, so moving there is safe.\n\nIf I move to (4,3), which is down.\n\n(4,3) is free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,2), etc.\n\nTo maximize space, moving to (4,3) might be better to go down.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (5,4) is right.\n\nBut (5,4) is tail, so moving there is fine.\n\nLet's see if there are risks.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\" only if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here no food on tail.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut to plan ahead, after turn 67, head at (4,4), move to (4,3) or (5,4).\n\nSay I move D to (4,3) on turn 68.\n\nThen head at (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), etc.\n\nThen from (4,3), move D to (4,2) on turn 69.\n\n(4,2) free.\n\nThen from (4,2), move D to (4,1) on turn 70, etc.\n\nBut (4,1) is free, not wall.\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nThe food at (1,1) can be eaten later when the snake body has moved from the top-left.\n\nFor example, as the snake moves down, the segments at (1,5), (2,5), etc. will move, freeing space.\n\nEventually, (1,1) might be accessible.\n\nBut I need to ensure I can reach it.\n\nSince the problem asks to think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide a sequence.\n\nFor turn 65, action: R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 66: U to (3,4) to eat\n\nTurn 67: R to (4,4)\n\nThen for turn 68, I need to choose.\n\nFrom (4,4), after move to (4,4) on turn 67, positions: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail\n\nMove to (4,3): D to (4,3)\n\nNew head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) // tail at (5,5)\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move D to (4,2) or R to (5,3), etc.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for turn 65 and a few more.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide at least 5 actions or so.\n\nCurrent turn t1=65.\n\nSo actions for turn 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, etc.\n\nBut I need to decide the sequence.\n\nSince after turn 67, I have choices, but for now, I'll go with moving down.\n\nAlso, about the food at (1,1), I can plan to eat it later.\n\nBut for immediate actions.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 65, if I move R to (3,3), and on turn 66 I eat (3,4), that's +1.\n\nIf I move D to (2,2) on turn 65, I might not eat anything soon, and miss the chance if something happens.\n\nBut (3,4) has 6 turns, so I can eat it later.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), I can go to (3,2), then to (3,3), then to (3,4) on turn 68 or something.\n\nBut that takes more turns.\n\nTurn 65: move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 66: move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 67: move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 68: move U to (3,4) eat\n\nBut on turn 68, (3,4) might still be there if life span 6, turn 65 to 70, so turn 68 is ok.\n\nBut I get the food later, and in the meantime, I didn't score.\n\nWhereas in the first plan, I eat on turn 66.\n\nAlso, in this path, when I go to (3,4) on turn 68, the situation might be different.\n\nBut with the snake body, it might be similar.\n\nI think eating sooner is better to score and free up the food cell, but not critical.\n\nBut for maximizing score, since all food is +1, eating earlier allows for more food spawn or something, but the problem doesn't mention new food, so only existing food.\n\nWith three food, I can eat all, but (5,2) is gone, so two left.\n\nI should eat (3,4) now.\n\nMoreover, moving to (2,2) might lead to the temptation to go to (1,1) which is deadly, so better to avoid.\n\nTherefore, I think turn 65: move R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 66: move U to (3,4) to eat food\n\nThen turn 67: move R to (4,4)  // only safe move\n\nNow for turn 68: from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or R to (5,4)\n\nI choose to move D to (4,3) to go down for more space.\n\nThen turn 69: from (4,3), move D to (4,2)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify.\n\nSince the food at (1,1) is there, I should plan to eat it eventually.\n\nFor example, after moving down, the tail will move, freeing the top-left cells.\n\nThen I can circle back to eat (1,1).\n\nBut for now, let's provide the sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 65: R\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: R\n\nTurn 68: D (to (4,3))\n\nThen from (4,3), on turn 69, I can move D to (4,2) or R to (5,3), etc.\n\nI think for 5 turns, I can do up to turn 69.\n\nt1=65, so turns 65,66,67,68,69.\n\nActions: 65:R, 66:U, 67:R, 68:D, then 69:?\n\nFrom (4,3) after turn 68 move D to (4,3)? Turn 68 move from (4,4) to (4,3), so head to (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 69, from (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4) but that's body, collision; D to (4,2); L to (3,3) body; R to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) not wall, not snake? After move, positions include (4,3), (4,4), etc., not (5,3), so free.\n\nSo move D to (4,2) or R to (5,3).\n\nI can move D to (4,2) to continue down.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut for the sequence, I'll put.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be in a box.\n\nAlso, need to avoid instant reverse, but in this sequence, after turn 67 move R to (4,4), direction R, then turn 68 move D to (4,3), not opposite, ok.\n\nThen from (4,3) direction D, turn 69 move D to (4,2), same direction, or other.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nTo reach (1,1), I need to go left, but slowly.\n\nFor example, after going down, I can go left to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut not necessary for the immediate plan.\n\nSo I think for turn 65: R\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: R\n\nThen for turn 68 and 69, I need to specify.\n\nSince after turn 67, head at (4,4), I could move R to (5,4) instead of D.\n\n(5,4) is tail, so moving there is safe.\n\nThen head at (5,4), and so on.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think either is ok.\n\nBut moving down might open more space.\n\nAlso, there is an internal obstacle at (5,1) and (6,4), so bottom-right has some walls.\n\nBut I think D is fine.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 65: R\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: R\n\nTurn 68: D\n\nTurn 69: D  // to (4,2)\n\nBut on turn 69, from (4,3), move D to (4,2).\n\nYes.\n\nAnd I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I think 5 actions are sufficient.\n\nNow, about the life span: (3,4) eaten on turn 66, which is within life span 6.\n\n(1,1) still there.\n\nAnd snake survives.\n\nIn the other choice, if I had gone to (2,2), it might be riskier.\n\nSo I think this is better.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn 65, the snake must prioritize eating the positive food at (3,4) while avoiding the deadly trap at (1,1) and ensuring long-term survival. The food at (5,2) has a life span of 1 and cannot be reached this turn, so it will disappear. The food at (3,4) has a life span of 6 (available until turn 70) and should be eaten soon for +1 score. The food at (1,1) has a life span of 9 but is currently a death trap due to surrounding walls and body segments; it should be avoided until the snake body moves away.\n\nFrom the current head position (2,3) and direction R, the only safe moves are D (down to (2,2)) or R (right to (3,3)). Moving R to (3,3) positions the snake to eat (3,4) on the next turn, which is efficient for scoring and avoids the (1,1) risk. After eating, the snake must move to (4,4) on turn 67 to avoid being trapped. Then, moving down to (4,3) and (4,2) opens up space for future exploration and survival.\n\n**Planned Sequence (5 turns ahead):**\n- **Turn 65: R (right to (3,3))** – Positions head to access (3,4) next turn. Safe and avoids (1,1) trap.\n- **Turn 66: U (up to (3,4))** – Eats positive food (+1 score), snake grows to length 14. Only safe move from (3,3) that scores immediately.\n- **Turn 67: R (right to (4,4))** – Moves to the tail cell (safe as tail moves away). Avoids trap at (3,5) where all adjacent cells are occupied.\n- **Turn 68: D (down to (4,3))** – Moves down to open area, avoiding body collisions. Direction change from R to D is allowed (no instant reverse).\n- **Turn 69: D (down to (4,2))** – Continues downward to explore safer regions, away from crowded top-left. Prepares for potential future eating of (1,1) once body clears.\n\nThis sequence scores +1 on turn 66, ensures survival for at least 5 turns, and sets up for long-term play by moving toward open space. After turn 69, the snake can consider circling back to (1,1) once the body segments near it have moved (e.g., as the tail progresses), but this requires reevaluation based on the new state.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 65: R (right)\nTurn 66: U (up)\nTurn 67: R (right)\nTurn 68: D (down)\nTurn 69: D (down)\n}",

        "step": 66,
        "score": 12,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 66, and I have to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 because the borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are at the borders and also internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (3,3), and the body segments follow: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4). Let me list these out in order:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Next: (2,3)\n\n- Then: (1,3)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (4,4)  # This is the tail, since it's the last one.\n\nThe snake has 13 segments. Positions from head to tail: index 0 to 12.\n\nHead direction is \"R\", which means the snake is currently moving right. So from (3,3), it just moved to the right, I assume, since the direction is given as current head direction.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- One at (3,4) with value 1 and life span 6. But it says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\": (3,4,6,1) – I think this means position (3,4), life span 6, value 1. Similarly, (1,1,8,1) is (1,1) with life span 8, value 1.\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1. No negative food mentioned here.\n\nLife span: for (3,4), it disappears after 6 turns, meaning from turn 66, it has 6 turns left, including turn 66? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on turn 66, life span is 6, meaning it will disappear after turn 71? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life span is N on turn t, it disappears after N turns, so:\n\n- On turn t, life span N: present\n\n- Turn t+1: life span N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t + (N-1): life span 1\n\n- Turn t + N: disappears, so not present on turn t+N.\n\nFor (3,4), life span 6 on turn 66, so it will be present on turns 66,67,68,69,70, and disappear on turn 71.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) with life span 8: present on turns 66 to 73, disappear on turn 74.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for turns 66, 67, etc., but since the current turn is 66, and I'm to output actions starting from turn 66, I think.\n\nThe answer format says: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nAnd t1=66, so I need to specify actions for turn 66, 67, 68, ... at least 5 turns, but probably more since I should think ahead.\n\nThe snake head is at (3,3), direction right. So possible moves from here: since direction is R, I can move R (right), U (up), D (down), but not L (left) because of no instant reverse. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, which is not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- R to (4,3)\n\n- U to (3,4)\n\n- D to (3,2)\n\nNow, I need to check if these cells are safe: not walls, not body parts except possibly the tail.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (4,3): x=4,y=3, which is within 1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, so x=4 is between 0 and 7, not border. Similarly y=3.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). None of these are (4,3), so (4,3) should be free.\n\n(3,4): x=3,y=4, not border, and obstacles: (2,4) is an obstacle, but (3,4) is different. (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) is not listed, so should be free.\n\n(3,2): x=3,y=2, not border, obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) is different, so free.\n\nNow, body parts: snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nFrom snake: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nSo cells occupied: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nNow, (4,3) is not in this list, so free.\n\n(3,4): is (3,4) in the list? Positions: (3,3), (2,3), etc. (3,4) is not listed, so free.\n\n(3,2): not listed, free.\n\nBut (3,4) has food! Food is at (3,4) and (1,1).\n\nSo moving U to (3,4) would eat the food, since head moves to food cell.\n\nBut I need to think about risks, especially tail reward danger.\n\nFirst, let's consider the options for turn 66.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (4,3)\n\n- Head to (4,3)\n\n- Then the snake will move: new head (4,3), then body segments shift: the tail (4,4) will move away, so the body at (4,4) was the tail, it moves to where the next segment was? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nAfter move R to (4,3):\n\n- New head: (4,3)\n\n- Body: previous head (3,3) becomes new segment 1, then (2,3) becomes segment 2, ..., up to (5,4) becomes segment 12, but since no food, tail is not grown, so the last segment (4,4) is removed.\n\nSnake positions after move: head at (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). (5,4) is now the tail? Let's see: original positions: indices 0 to 12: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nAfter moving head to (4,3), the body segments become: segment 1: old head (3,3), segment 2: old seg1 (2,3), ..., segment 12: old seg11 (5,4), and old tail (4,4) is removed. So new positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). Tail is (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is now tail, which was previously occupied, but since tail moves, it's ok.\n\nNow, is (4,3) safe? Yes, no wall or body.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (3,4)\n\nThis would eat the food at (3,4), since head moves to food cell.\n\nFood is at (3,4), and it's positive, so snake grows.\n\nAfter move: head to (3,4), eat food, so new head (3,4), then body: old head (3,3) becomes new segment, and so on, up to old tail (4,4) becomes new tail, but since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move.\n\nSpecifically: head moves to (3,4), which has food, so snake grows: new head at (3,4), then the body segments remain, but each moves to the next position? No.\n\nWhen food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays, and the body doesn't shift immediately; the new segment is added, so length increases.\n\nSequence: head moves to new cell; if food eaten, then a new segment is added at the current tail position, so the tail doesn't move, and the snake grows by one segment. If no food, tail is removed.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,4) eats food, so:\n\n- New head: (3,4)\n\n- Body: old head (3,3) becomes segment 1, then (2,3) becomes segment 2, ..., up to old segment 12 (4,4) becomes segment 13? Original positions: 13 segments, after growth, 14 segments.\n\nOriginal snake: 13 positions, so 13 segments.\n\nAfter moving head to (3,4) and eating food:\n\n- New head: (3,4)\n\n- Then new segment 1: old head (3,3)\n\n- New segment 2: old segment 1 (2,3)\n\n- ...\n\n- New segment 13: old segment 12 (4,4)  # which was the tail\n\n- And since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position of the old tail, so new segment 14 at (4,4)\n\nBut (4,4) was the position of the tail, and now it becomes segment 13, and new segment 14 is also at (4,4)? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell. If food eaten, the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, meaning the tail stays, and the snake grows. If no food, tail moves off, so length same.\n\nPositions: let S be the list of positions.\n\nAfter move without food: S_new = [new_head] + S[:-1]  # head moves to new, each body to previous position, tail removed.\n\nAfter move with food: S_new = [new_head] + S  # head moves to new, and the entire body remains, so new segment added at the end.\n\nIn this case, S is the list before move.\n\nBefore move: S = [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)]  # 13 elements.\n\nMove U to (3,4), which has food.\n\nSo new head: (3,4)\n\nThen with food eaten, S_new = [(3,4)] + S = [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nSo now snake has 14 segments: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), etc., down to (4,4) as tail.\n\n(4,4) is the tail now.\n\nBut (4,4) was previously occupied, but after move, it's still occupied by the new tail, and the head is at (3,4), which is different.\n\nNow, is this safe? Moving to (3,4) is not a body cell, so no collision. But we need to check for Tail Reward Danger.\n\nTail Reward Danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nHere, the head is moving to (3,4), and the tail is at (4,4). Are they adjacent? (3,4) and (4,4) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut the food is at (3,4), not at the tail cell. Tail cell is (4,4), which does not have food; food is at (3,4), which is where head is moving to.\n\nThe danger is when eating food that is on the tail cell, but only if head is adjacent before eating.\n\nLet's read: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, before moving, head is at (3,3), tail is at (4,4).\n\nAre (3,3) and (4,4) adjacent? Diagonally? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. Not diagonally.\n\n(3,3) and (4,4) are diagonal, not adjacent. So head is not adjacent to tail before moving.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), head is at (3,4), tail is at (4,4), which are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut the food is eaten at (3,4), which is not the tail cell; tail cell is (4,4), no food there.\n\nSo no Tail Reward Danger in this case.\n\nTherefore, moving U to (3,4) should be safe and eat the food.\n\nOption 3: Move D to (3,2)\n\nHead to (3,2), no food there, so no eat, tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  # (4,4) removed, tail is (5,4)\n\n(3,2) should be free, as we checked.\n\nNow, for turn 66, I have three choices: U, D, R.\n\nBut I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFirst, the food at (3,4) has life span 6, meaning it will disappear after turn 71, so I can eat it now or later, but if I don't eat it now, it might be risky or I might miss it.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,1) with longer life span.\n\nBut I should consider the board and plan a path.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, cannot go there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo let's list all wall cells:\n\n- All (x,0) for x=0 to 7\n\n- All (x,7) for x=0 to 7\n\n- All (0,y) for y=0 to 7\n\n- All (7,y) for y=0 to 7\n\nPlus internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow, snake positions: head (3,3), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nFood: (3,4) and (1,1)\n\n(1,1) is at bottom-left, but there is an obstacle at (1,2), so it might be tricky to reach.\n\nFirst, from current position (3,3), moving U to (3,4) eats food immediately, growing the snake.\n\nBut let's think about the consequences.\n\nAfter eating at (3,4), snake head at (3,4), and body includes (3,3), (2,3), etc.\n\nNow, from (3,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but direction: after moving U, head direction is U, so next move cannot be D (opposite).\n\nCurrent direction before move is R, after moving U, new direction is U.\n\nSo from (3,4), direction U, possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) is now body, so collision, cannot; L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\n(2,4) is a wall! Internal obstacle (2,4), so cannot move there.\n\n(4,4) is the tail, but after eating, tail is at (4,4), but in the new position, (4,4) is occupied by the tail.\n\nAfter eating, snake positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nSo cells occupied: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), etc., and (4,4) is occupied.\n\nFrom head (3,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,5): is (3,5) occupied? Snake positions: (1,5), (2,5), but not (3,5), so free? Also walls: not wall. (3,5) should be free.\n\n- D to (3,3): but (3,3) is occupied by body, segment 1, so collision, death.\n\n- L to (2,4): (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n\n- R to (4,4): (4,4) is occupied by tail, segment 13 or whatever, it's a body cell, so if head moves to (4,4), it collides with body, death.\n\nTherefore, if I move U to (3,4) on turn 66, on turn 67, from (3,4), the only possible move is U to (3,5), because D, L, R all lead to death.\n\nL to (2,4) is wall, R to (4,4) is body, D to (3,3) is body.\n\nSo only U to (3,5) is possible.\n\nThen on turn 67, move U to (3,5).\n\nNow, (3,5) is free? Let's check: not in walls, not in current snake positions before move.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5) on turn 67: no food at (3,5), so snake moves without growing.\n\nBefore move on turn 67, head at (3,4), direction U.\n\nMove U to (3,5), no food, so new head (3,5), body: (3,4) becomes segment 1, (3,3) seg2, etc., up to (5,4) becomes last body, and tail (4,4) removed? Positions before turn 67 move: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), ..., (5,4), (4,4)\n\nAfter move to (3,5) no food: new head (3,5), then [ (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ]  # (4,4) removed, so tail is (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is now tail.\n\nFrom (3,5), direction now U, possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\n(3,6) is occupied? Current positions: after move, (3,6) is still there? In the list: (3,6) is a body segment, at position, let's see indices: in new positions, head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), ..., up to (5,4)\n\n(3,6) is in the body: it's segment, say, after (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), yes (3,6) is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is body, (2,5) is body, (4,5) is body.\n\nLet's list current positions after turn 67 move: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]  # 14 segments? After turn 66, we had 14 segments, but on turn 67, no food eaten, so when moving, tail removed, so 13 segments now.\n\nTurn 66: after eating, 14 segments.\n\nTurn 67: move to (3,5) no food, so new head (3,5), and body is the first 13 segments of the previous body, so S_new = [new_head] + S[:-1] where S has 14 elements.\n\nS after turn 66: [ (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4) ]  # 14 elements.\n\nAfter move to (3,5) no food: new head (3,5), then S[:-1] of previous, which is [ (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) ]  # 13 elements, tail is (5,4)\n\n(4,4) was removed.\n\nNow positions: head (3,5), body: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), tail (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is tail.\n\nFrom (3,5), direction U (since moved up), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,6): (3,6) is occupied by body, segment in position, (3,6) is in the list, index, say, from head: (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), ..., (3,6) is later, but it's a body cell, so moving to (3,6) would collide.\n\n- D to (3,4): (3,4) is directly behind, occupied by body.\n\n- L to (2,5): (2,5) is in body positions, occupied.\n\n- R to (4,5): (4,5) is also in body positions, occupied.\n\nAll possible moves from (3,5) lead to body cells! So death on next turn.\n\nTherefore, if I move U on turn 66 to eat the food, then on turn 67 I must move U to (3,5), and then on turn 68, I have no safe move, all directions are blocked by body or walls.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- (3,6) is body\n\n- (3,4) is body\n\n- (2,5) is body? (2,5) is at position, in the list, yes.\n\n- (4,5) is body, yes.\n\nAnd no other directions, so indeed, after turn 67, the snake is trapped and will die on turn 68.\n\nTherefore, moving U to eat the food on turn 66 is suicidal because it leads to a dead end immediately.\n\nI must avoid that.\n\nSo for turn 66, moving U is not an option.\n\nNow, other options: move R to (4,3) or D to (3,2).\n\nFirst, move R to (4,3).\n\nAfter move: no food at (4,3), so no eat, tail removed.\n\nNew head at (4,3), direction now R.\n\nBody: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  # tail is (5,4)\n\n(4,4) was removed, so positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nFrom (4,3), direction R, possible moves: R to (5,3), U to (4,4), D to (4,2)\n\nCannot L to (3,3) because opposite and body.\n\n(5,3): is it free? Not wall, not in body positions above. Body has (5,4), (5,5), but not (5,3). So free.\n\n(4,4): now, (4,4) was the tail, but removed, so free? But after move, (4,4) is not occupied, since tail moved to (5,4)? In positions, after move, cells occupied: (4,3), (3,3), ..., (5,4), no (4,4), so (4,4) is free.\n\n(4,2): free, not wall or body.\n\nAlso, (4,4) has no food, but it might be available.\n\nNow, move D to (3,2) on turn 66.\n\nHead to (3,2), no food, tail removed.\n\nNew head (3,2), direction down? Current direction was R, moved D, so new direction D.\n\nBody: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  # (4,4) removed, tail (5,4)\n\nFrom (3,2), direction D, possible moves: D to (3,1), U to (3,3) but body, cannot, L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\n(3,1): not wall? y=1, x=3, borders: y=0 and y=7 walls, y=1 is not border, but internal obstacles: (5,1) and (6,1), not (3,1), so free.\n\nBut (3,1) might be free, but let's see.\n\n(2,2): (2,2) is internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (1,2), but (2,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\n(4,2): free.\n\nNow, I need to think about long-term.\n\nThe food at (3,4) is still there, but if I don't eat it now, I might eat it later, but it has limited life.\n\nLife span 6 on turn 66, so available until turn 70 inclusive? Turn 66: life 6, turn 67:5, ..., turn 70: life 2, turn 71:1, turn 72: gone? Rule: disappears after N turns, so on turn t + N.\n\nTurn 66: life span 6, so after 6 turns, on turn 72, it disappears.\n\nPresent on turns 66 to 71, gone on turn 72.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life 8, present turns 66 to 73.\n\nBut (1,1) is far, and with obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving R on turn 66.\n\nTurn 66: move R to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 67: from (4,3), I can go R to (5,3), U to (4,4), or D to (4,2)\n\nNow, if I go U to (4,4), (4,4) is free now, no food, so just move.\n\nThen head to (4,4), direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,5), but (4,5) is body? After turn 66 move, positions: head (4,3), body (3,3), (2,3), etc., (4,5) is body.\n\nAfter turn 66 move to (4,3): positions [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\n(4,5) is occupied.\n\nIf on turn 67 move U to (4,4), (4,4) is free, no food, so new head (4,4), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), ..., (5,5), (5,4) but tail (5,4) removed? S has 13 elements, move no food, new head (4,4), then S[:-1] = [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]  # tail (5,4) removed, so new tail (5,5)\n\nPositions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nFrom (4,4), direction U, possible moves: U to (4,5), but (4,5) is now body, occupied, so collision.\n\nD to (4,3) body, L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\n(3,4) has food, but is it free? Not occupied now, since we moved.\n\n(5,4): (5,4) was tail, removed, so free.\n\n(3,4) is free and has food.\n\nBut if I move L to (3,4), I can eat the food.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nFrom (4,4), moves:\n\n- U to (4,5): body, death\n\n- D to (4,3): body, death\n\n- L to (3,4): free, has food\n\n- R to (5,4): free, no food\n\nSo possible moves: L to (3,4) or R to (5,4)\n\nIf I move L to (3,4), eat food.\n\nThen similar to before, but now head at (3,4), and body behind.\n\nAfter moving L to (3,4) on turn 67, with food.\n\nNew head (3,4), and body: previous positions including (4,4), so S_new = [(3,4)] + previous S, but previous S before move is [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]  # 13 elements.\n\nAfter eating, S_new = [(3,4)] + S = [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]  # 14 segments, tail (5,5)\n\nNow head at (3,4), direction L (since moved left from (4,4)).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\n(3,5): free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n(3,3): occupied by body, segment 4? Positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), so (3,3) is body.\n\n(2,4): wall, obstacle.\n\n(4,4): occupied by body, segment 1.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (3,5), similar to before.\n\nThen on turn 68, move U to (3,5), no food there, so move, new head (3,5), body shifts, tail removed, etc., but then from (3,5), it might be trapped again.\n\nLet's not go this way; it seems messy.\n\nBack to turn 67 from (4,3): instead of U, I could move R to (5,3) or D to (4,2).\n\nPerhaps better to avoid (3,4) for now.\n\nSince moving to eat (3,4) leads to trouble, maybe I should not eat it at all and go for other food or explore.\n\nBut there's food at (1,1), but it's surrounded or something.\n\nLet's look at the grid.\n\nGrid:\n\nLet me sketch a map. Rows y from 0 to 7, bottom to top or top to bottom? Usually y=0 bottom, but in coordinates, it might be arbitrary, but let's assume y=0 is bottom for simplicity.\n\nSo:\n\ny=7: top row, walls except where noted? All border cells walls.\n\nInternal cells from (1,1) to (6,6) roughly, but with obstacles.\n\nList all free cells or something.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0,7 all y; y=0,7 all x.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\n(5,1) and (6,1) are at bottom, (1,2) left, (2,4) and (6,4) middle.\n\nSnake: head at (3,3), body as listed.\n\nFood at (3,4) and (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is at bottom-left, but (1,2) is obstacle, so to reach (1,1), I need to go from (1,3) or something.\n\nCurrent head (3,3), if I move D to (3,2) on turn 66.\n\nTurn 66: move D to (3,2)\n\nNew head (3,2), direction D.\n\nBody: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)  # (4,4) removed, tail (5,4)\n\nFrom (3,2), direction D, possible moves: D to (3,1), U to (3,3) body, cannot, L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\n(3,1): not wall, free.\n\n(2,2): not wall, but (1,2) is wall, (2,2) not listed as obstacle, so free.\n\n(4,2): free.\n\nSay I move D to (3,1) on turn 67.\n\nThen head to (3,1), no food, so new head (3,1), body: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)  # tail (5,4) removed, new tail (5,5)\n\n(5,4) was tail, removed.\n\nPositions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nFrom (3,1), direction D, possible moves: D to (3,0), but y=0 is wall, so death.\n\nU to (3,2) body, cannot.\n\nL to (2,1), R to (4,1)\n\n(2,1): not wall, free? Internal obstacles (5,1) and (6,1), not (2,1), so free.\n\n(4,1): similarly, free, but (5,1) is obstacle, (4,1) not.\n\nSo I can move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,1) to eat food.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), move L to (2,1), then on turn 68, from (2,1) I can move L to (1,1) to eat food, since (1,1) is adjacent and has food.\n\nBut check if head is adjacent to tail for Tail Reward Danger.\n\nWhen eating at (1,1), tail is at (5,5), far away, not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, back to turn 66.\n\nI need to choose between R and D for turn 66, since U is bad.\n\nIf I move R to (4,3), I can then go to (5,3) or other.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to avoid the trap.\n\nAnother idea: the snake body is blocking the top, so going down might open up space.\n\nMove D on turn 66 to (3,2)\n\nThen on turn 67, from (3,2), I can move to (3,1) or (2,2) or (4,2).\n\nIf I move to (2,2), for example.\n\nTurn 67: move L to (2,2) from (3,2)\n\nHead to (2,2), no food, new head (2,2), body: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)  # tail (5,4) removed, new tail (5,5)?

Only possible moves are all death: U wall, D wall, L wall, R body.\n\nSo the snake is trapped and dies immediately after eating the food.\n\nTail Reward Danger isn't the issue; it's just in a corner with no escape.\n\nSo eating (1,1) from this position leads to death.\n\nIf on turn 68 from (2,1) I move R to (3,1) instead of eating.\n\nBut (3,1) no food, so move to (3,1), then from there I can go to (4,1) or (3,2) but (3,2) is body, etc.\n\nBut the food at (1,1) is still there, but I may not be able to eat it safely.\n\nPerhaps it's better to avoid both foods for now and find a way to clear space.\n\nAnother option on turn 66: move R to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 67, from (4,3) I can move R to (5,3) or D to (4,2) or U to (4,4) but U to (4,4) might be ok if I don't eat (3,4).\n\nEarlier when I moved U to (4,4) from (4,3), then from (4,4) I had to move L or R.\n\nBut L to (3,4) with food leads to trap, R to (5,4) might be free.\n\nLet's try.\n\nTurn 66: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 67: move R to (5,3)  for example.\n\nNew head (5,3), no food, so body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)  # tail (5,4) removed, new tail (5,5)\n\nPositions: head (5,3), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nFrom (5,3), direction R, possible moves: R to (6,3), U to (5,4), D to (5,2)\n\n(6,3): x=6, not 7, so not border wall, but internal obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), not (6,3), so free?

Life span decreases every turn, so on turn 70, after eaten, it's gone, but before move, it's there.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 70, before move, food at (3,4) has life span 2 (since turn 66:6, 67:5, 68:4, 69:3, 70:2), so on turn 70, it is present, and I move to it, eat it.\n\nGood.\n\nSimilarly, I can do with moving R first.\n\nBut moving D might be better to go towards the other food.\n\nNow for turn 66, I should move D to (3,2) to start this path.\n\nThen for the actions.\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns.\n\nAlso, the other food at (1,1) has longer life, I can go for it later.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn 66: move D to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 67: from (3,2), I need to move, possible R to (4,2) or L to (2,2) or D to (3,1)\n\nTo go towards (4,3) for the food path, move R to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 68: from (4,2), move U to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 69: from (4,3), move U to (4,4)  # but (4,4) might be free\n\nAfter turn 68 move to (4,3), positions as before.\n\nThen turn 69: move U to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 70: move L to (3,4) to eat.\n\nBut from (4,4) to (3,4) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen as above.\n\nNow, I should think about the direction changes to avoid reverse moves.\n\nIn turn 69, from (4,3) to (4,4) is U, then from (4,4) to (3,4) is L, which is fine, no reverse.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions from turn 66 onwards.\n\nBut the food at (1,1) is still there, but I can ignore it for now or plan to eat it later.\n\nSince the snake is long, and (1,1) is in a corner, it might be hard to reach without trapping, but with life span 8, I have time.\n\nFor now, let's focus on the immediate plan.\n\nSo for turn 66: move D\n\nThen turn 67: move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 68: move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 69: move U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 70: move L to (3,4) to eat food.\n\nBut on turn 70, after eating, I need to move U to (3,5) as before.\n\nBut I can include that.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, output up to turn 70 or 71.\n\nBut let's see the state after.\n\nAfter turn 70 eat at (3,4), head at (3,4), then on turn 71, must move U to (3,5), no food, then to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to output all, just a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for turn 66, moving R is also possible, but D seems to work.\n\nAnother thing: when I move D on turn 66, from (3,3) to (3,2), is there any risk?\n\n(3,2) is free, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (4,2) etc.\n\nI think it's safe.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 66: D\n\nTurn 67: R  (to (4,2))\n\nBut from (3,2) to (4,2) is right, so R.\n\nThen turn 68: U (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 69: U (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 70: L (to (3,4))\n\nThen beyond.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output these 5 actions.\n\nThe food at (1,1) might be eaten later, but not in this sequence.\n\nSince the priority is long-term survival, and I have a path to eat one food and survive, it should be ok.\n\nI could consider moving towards (1,1) but earlier attempt led to trap, so better to avoid for now.\n\nSo I think this is a plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I must plan at least 5 turns ahead, considering the risks and opportunities. The current state (Turn 66) has the snake head at (3,3) moving right, with positive food at (3,4) (life span 6, value +1) and (1,1) (life span 8, value +1). However, directly eating the food at (3,4) on Turn 66 leads to an immediate dead end on Turn 68 due to body collisions. Instead, I should delay eating this food to avoid the trap and target it later when the body has shifted, ensuring a safe path for continued movement.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food at (3,4)**: Life span decreases each turn, so it must be eaten by Turn 71 (disappears after Turn 71). Eating it on Turn 70 is feasible and safe with the planned path.\n- **Food at (1,1)**: Has a longer life span (until Turn 74), but it is in a corner with obstacles, making it risky to reach immediately without trapping the snake. Prioritize (3,4) first for a safer score gain.\n- **Snake Body and Obstacles**: The snake's current body blocks many cells, especially around (3,4). Moving down initially (Turn 66) creates space and allows the body to shift, opening a safe route to eat (3,4) later.\n- **Movement Constraints**: Current direction is right, so no left move (reverse) on Turn 66. Subsequent moves must respect direction changes to avoid instant reversals.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not a concern here, as the tail is not adjacent to the head when eating food.\n- **Collision Risks**: Walls at borders and internal obstacles must be avoided. Internal obstacles include (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\n### Plan Overview (Turns 66-70):\n1. **Turn 66: Move Down (D)**  \n   - From (3,3) to (3,2). Avoids the trap at (3,4) and starts shifting the body downward. No food eaten. Tail removed, snake length remains 13.\n\n2. **Turn 67: Move Right (R)**  \n   - From (3,2) to (4,2). Continues to open space and positions the snake for an upward move. No food eaten. Tail removed, length 13.\n\n3. **Turn 68: Move Up (U)**  \n   - From (4,2) to (4,3). Moves toward the food area. No food eaten. Tail removed, length 13.\n\n4. **Turn 69: Move Up (U)**  \n   - From (4,3) to (4,4). Positions the head adjacent to (3,4) for the next move. No food eaten. Tail removed, length 13.\n\n5. **Turn 70: Move Left (L)**  \n   - From (4,4) to (3,4). Eats the positive food at (3,4) (life span 2 on Turn 70, so it is present). Snake grows to length 14. This is safe because the body has shifted away from the trap, allowing subsequent moves.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Avoids Immediate Trap**: Eating (3,4) on Turn 66 causes a dead end by Turn 68. Delaying to Turn 70 ensures the body has moved, enabling escape via (3,5) on Turn 71.\n- **Maximizes Score**: Eats +1 food safely. Food at (1,1) can be targeted later with its longer life span.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After Turn 70, the snake can move up to (3,5) and then right to (4,5), continuing safely. The path avoids walls and obstacles.\n- **Life Span Management**: Food at (3,4) is eaten on Turn 70 (within its life span of turns 66-71). Food at (1,1) remains until Turn 74 for future planning.\n- **Risk Minimization**: All moves are to free cells, with no body collisions or wall hits. Direction changes are legal (no instant reversals).\n\n### Actions for Turns 66-70:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 66: D (down)  \nTurn 67: R (right)  \nTurn 68: U (up)  \nTurn 69: U (up)  \nTurn 70: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent state:\n\n- Turn: 67\n\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and borders are walls. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n- Snake positions: Head is at (3,2), then body: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). So the snake has 13 segments.\n\n- Head direction: Down (D). Since head is at (3,2) and moving down, which is decreasing y? No, typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nThe movement definitions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So U increases y, D decreases y, L decreases x, R increases x. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so probably y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nBut snake positions: head (3,2). Moving down, which is D: (x,y-1), so from (3,2) down would be to (3,1), but y=1 is above y=0, I think. Since y decreases down, y=0 is the bottom wall.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, so last move was down to (3,2).\n\nNow food:\n\n- (3,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,5) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Value is 1 for all, so all are +1 score if eaten.\n\nLife span: for (3,4) it's 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns including this one, so in 5 turns from now. Similarly, (1,1) in 7 turns, (6,5) in 10 turns.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead, but the output should be actions starting from turn 67.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn 67, 68, 69, etc., up to some point, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output should be the actions for the current and future turns. Let me read the answer format.\n\n\"Turn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1\" and so on. So I need to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 67.\n\nBut how many turns? It doesn't specify, but since I need to think ahead, I should simulate multiple moves. Probably, I need to decide the immediate action for turn 67, but based on a plan for several turns.\n\nIn the context, I should choose the first action, and perhaps imply the plan, but the output should be a sequence. But the sequence might change based on future states, so I need to output a fixed sequence? That seems tricky because food might be eaten or disappear, etc.\n\nI think for the purpose of this, I need to output the planned actions for a few turns, say 5 or more, based on current state, but since the state changes, I have to assume no new food spawns or anything, but the problem doesn't mention new food spawning, only existing food with life span.\n\nThe state has current food, and life span decreases each turn. No mention of new food, so probably only these three food items for now.\n\nI need to make a sequence of moves to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8x8 grid? x=0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, but walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's see.\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the snake can only be on cells with 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6, I think? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, that would be 6x6 playable area.\n\nConfirm with snake positions: snake has (3,2), (3,3), etc., x from 1 to 5, y from 2 to 6, all within 1 to 6? (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), etc., x=1, y=3,4,5; (2,5), (2,6), y=6; and walls at y=7, so y=6 is not wall? y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6 should be playable, similarly x from 1 to 6.\n\n(5,5), (5,4), x=5; head at (3,2), y=2. So min x=1, max x=5; min y=2, max y=6. But walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6. So 6x6 grid, indices from 1 to 6 in x and y.\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Snake has positions with x=1,2,3,4,5; y=2,3,4,5,6. Missing x=6? No, snake has (5,5), (5,4), but not (6, something) yet. Food at (6,5), which is playable.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(1,2) is an obstacle, but snake body is at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and head at (3,2), so (1,2) is obstacle, not part of snake.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) obstacle, (5,1), (6,1), (6,4).\n\nSo let's list all blocked cells:\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. But since playable area is inside, we don't consider them as movable, so for collision, we care about internal obstacles and snake body.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake body: positions except head: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nHead is at (3,2), so the full snake occupies: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\nNow, head direction is D, down, which is (x,y-1). So from (3,2), moving down would go to (3,1).\n\nBut y=1 is playable? y=1 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (5,1) and (6,1), but (3,1) might be free? Let's see what cells are free.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells:\n\n- Obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\n- Snake: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is snake body, and (6,4) is obstacle, so different.\n\nFood at: (3,4), (1,1), (6,5)\n\n(3,4) has food, but snake body is at (3,3), (2,3), etc., not at (3,4)? (3,4) is not in snake positions. Snake positions: (3,2) head, then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), etc. So (3,4) is free? But there is food at (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) food, (6,5) food.\n\nNow, for (1,1), is it occupied? Snake has (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,1) or (1,2). (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) should be free except for food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) should be free.\n\nBut let's list all cells to see what's available.\n\nPlayable grid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nBlocked cells:\n\n- Obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\n- Snake: all positions: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is snake, (6,4) is obstacle, so separate.\n\nNow, free cells should be those not occupied and not obstacle.\n\nBut food is on free cells, I assume.\n\n(3,4) is not in snake or obstacles, so free with food.\n\n(1,1) not snake or obstacle? (1,1): snake has (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), so (1,1) and (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) is free with food.\n\n(6,5) not snake or obstacle, free with food.\n\nAlso, other free cells? For example, (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,4), (3,5), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,6)? (5,6) is not listed, snake has (5,5), (5,4), (4,5), (4,6), etc., not (5,6).\n\nLet's systematically list all cells.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nFor each (x,y):\n\n(1,1): food\n\n(1,2): obstacle\n\n(1,3): snake body\n\n(1,4): snake body\n\n(1,5): snake body\n\n(1,6): ? not listed, should be free? But walls at y=7, but y=6 is playable. Snake has (2,6), but (1,6) not occupied. Obstacles not there, so (1,6) should be free.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n(2,1): not snake, not obstacle? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,1) not listed. Snake: (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), not (2,1) or (2,2). So (2,1) and (2,2) should be free.\n\n(2,3): snake body\n\n(2,4): obstacle\n\n(2,5): snake body\n\n(2,6): snake body\n\n(3,1): not snake, not obstacle? Snake at (3,2), (3,3), etc., not (3,1). Obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), not (3,1). So free.\n\n(3,2): snake head\n\n(3,3): snake body\n\n(3,4): food\n\n(3,5): not listed, snake has (3,6), but not (3,5). Free?\n\n(3,6): snake body\n\n(4,1): not snake, not obstacle, free\n\n(4,2): not snake, snake has (4,5), (4,6), not (4,2). Free\n\n(4,3): free? Not listed\n\n(4,4): free? Not listed\n\n(4,5): snake body\n\n(4,6): snake body\n\n(5,1): obstacle\n\n(5,2): free? Snake at (5,4), (5,5), not (5,2) or (5,3). Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,2) not. So free.\n\n(5,3): free\n\n(5,4): snake body\n\n(5,5): snake body\n\n(5,6): not snake, not obstacle, free\n\n(6,1): obstacle\n\n(6,2): free? Not listed\n\n(6,3): free? Not listed\n\n(6,4): obstacle\n\n(6,5): food\n\n(6,6): free? Not listed\n\nAlso, (3,5) free, (4,3) free, etc.\n\nBut we don't need all, just for pathing.\n\nCurrent head at (3,2), direction D, so moving down would be to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is free, as above.\n\nBut is it safe? Moving to (3,1), then the snake moves, so tail moves, etc.\n\nBut I need to think about eating food and avoiding collisions.\n\nAvailable food: (3,4), (1,1), (6,5)\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is above the head? Head at (3,2), so (3,4) is north, y=4 vs y=2, since y decreases down, (3,4) is higher y, so north, up direction.\n\nHead direction is down, so to go to (3,4), I need to go up, but I can't instantly reverse; since current direction is D, I cannot go U immediately on next turn.\n\nMovement constraints: no instant reverse, so from direction D, I cannot move U next turn.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,2) with dir D: not U, so can go D, L, or R.\n\nD: to (3,1)\n\nL: to (2,2)\n\nR: to (4,2)\n\nNow, check if these are safe.\n\nFirst, (3,1): is it free? Yes, as above.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1), the snake head is at (3,1), and tail is at (5,4)? Let's simulate the move.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it, and the tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n\nCurrently, snake positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail.\n\nIf I move to (3,1), no food there, so new head: (3,1), then body: (3,2) [previous head], (3,3), (2,3), ..., up to (5,5), and tail (5,4) is removed, so the new tail is what was (5,5)? Let's list the new positions.\n\nAfter move to (3,1):\n\n- Head to (3,1)\n\n- Segment 1: from (3,3) to where head was, (3,2)\n\n- Segment 2: from (2,3) to where segment 1 was, (3,3)\n\n- Segment 3: from (1,3) to (2,3)\n\n- Segment 4: from (1,4) to (1,3)\n\n- Segment 5: from (1,5) to (1,4)\n\n- Segment 6: from (2,5) to (1,5)\n\n- Segment 7: from (2,6) to (2,5)\n\n- Segment 8: from (3,6) to (2,6)\n\n- Segment 9: from (4,6) to (3,6)\n\n- Segment 10: from (4,5) to (4,6)\n\n- Segment 11: from (5,5) to (4,5)\n\n- Segment 12: from (5,4) to (5,5)  // tail moves to (5,5)\n\nThe last segment was (5,4), which moves to where the previous segment was, but since it's the tail, it leaves that cell.\n\nAfter move:\n\nHead at (3,1)\n\nThen body: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nAnd (5,4) is no longer occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,2), or R to (4,2).\n\nNow, back to choices at turn 67.\n\nFrom (3,2), dir D, possible actions: D, L, R.\n\n- D: to (3,1)\n\n- L: to (2,2)\n\n- R: to (4,2)\n\nNow, (3,1): free, no food.\n\n(2,2): is it free? (2,2) not snake, not obstacle, so free, no food.\n\n(4,2): similarly, free, no food.\n\nAll three moves seem safe immediately, but I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood at (3,4), which is close, but to reach (3,4) from (3,2), I need to go up, but I can't because no instant reverse; from dir D, I cannot go U now. So I have to go D, L, or R first.\n\nThen, after that, I can go U.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nAlso, life span: (3,4) life span 5, so it disappears after turn 67+5=72? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 67, life span 5, so it will be there for 5 turns: turns 67,68,69,70,71, and disappears at turn 72? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nFor (3,4): at turn 67, life_span=5, so present for turns 67,68,69,70,71; disappears at turn 72.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1): life_span=7, present turns 67 to 73, disappears turn 74.\n\n(6,5): life_span=10, present turns 67 to 76, disappears turn 77.\n\nNow, I need to plan to eat one or more of these.\n\n(3,4) is very close, only 2 cells away in y-direction, but I can't go directly up.\n\nFrom (3,2), if I go L to (2,2), then from there I can go U to (2,3), but (2,3) is currently snake body? At turn 67, (2,3) is occupied by snake.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2), let's see what happens.\n\nIf I move L to (2,2) at turn 67.\n\nNew head: (2,2)\n\nThen body: (3,2) [previous head], (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nTail (5,4) removed.\n\nSo positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\n(2,3) is still occupied, but it's body segment.\n\nNow, from (2,2), head at (2,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: from dir L, cannot move R (opposite), so can go U, D, L.\n\nU: to (2,3) — but (2,3) is currently occupied by body. After the move, (2,3) is occupied by the second segment? Let's see the positions after move to (2,2):\n\n- Head: (2,2)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,2)  // previous head\n\n- Segment 2: (3,3)  // previous segment 1\n\n- Segment 3: (2,3)  // previous segment 2, which was (2,3) before? Before move, segment 2 was (2,3), after move, it moves to where segment 1 was, which was (3,3)? I think I'm confusing.\n\nBetter to think: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nBefore move at turn 67:\n\nPositions: index 0: head (3,2), 1: (3,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (1,3), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (2,6), 8: (3,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (4,5), 11: (5,5), 12: (5,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,2):\n\nNew head: (2,2)\n\nThen segment 1 (was index 1) moves to where head was, (3,2)\n\nSegment 2 (index 2) moves to where segment 1 was, (3,3)\n\nSegment 3 (index 3) moves to where segment 2 was, (2,3)\n\nSegment 4 (index 4) moves to where segment 3 was, (1,3)\n\nSegment 5 (index 5) to where segment 4 was, (1,4)\n\nSegment 6 (index 6) to where segment 5 was, (1,5)\n\nSegment 7 (index 7) to where segment 6 was, (2,5)\n\nSegment 8 (index 8) to where segment 7 was, (2,6)\n\nSegment 9 (index 9) to where segment 8 was, (3,6)\n\nSegment 10 (index 10) to where segment 9 was, (4,6)\n\nSegment 11 (index 11) to where segment 10 was, (4,5)\n\nSegment 12 (index 12) to where segment 11 was, (5,5)\n\nAnd the cell (5,4) is freed.\n\nSo now snake: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\n(2,3) is occupied by the fourth segment.\n\nIf from (2,2) I move U to (2,3), that would be moving onto a body segment, which is deadly collision.\n\n(2,3) is occupied, so I cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, D to (2,1): (2,1) is free, I think.\n\nL to (1,2): but (1,2) is obstacle, wall or internal obstacle, so collision.\n\nR to (3,2): but (3,2) is occupied by segment 1, body, so collision.\n\nBut from dir L, I can only move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (2,3): occupied, collision.\n\nD to (2,1): possible, free.\n\nL to (1,2): obstacle, collision.\n\nSo only possible move from (2,2) is D to (2,1), if I go that way.\n\nBut at turn 67, if I choose to go L, I end up at (2,2) with only one safe move: down to (2,1), which might not be good.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R from (3,2) to (4,2).\n\nLet's check R to (4,2).\n\nFrom (3,2) dir D, move R to (4,2).\n\nNew head: (4,2)\n\nThen body: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)  // tail (5,4) removed, new tail (5,5)\n\nPositions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nNow, from (4,2), direction R (since moved right).\n\nPossible moves: not L (opposite), so U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,3): is it free? (4,3) not occupied, not obstacle, so free.\n\nD to (4,1): free? (4,1) not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nR to (5,2): free? (5,2) not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nAll seem possible.\n\nBut (4,3) is free, etc.\n\nNow, back to turn 67 choices.\n\nIf I go D to (3,1), from (3,2) dir D, move D to (3,1).\n\nNew head: (3,1)\n\nBody: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)  // tail (5,4) removed\n\nPositions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nFrom (3,1), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: not U (opposite), so D, L, R.\n\nD to (3,0): but y=0 is wall, so collision, invalid.\n\nL to (2,1): free? (2,1) not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nR to (4,1): free? (4,1) not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nSo from (3,1), I can go L or R, not D.\n\nNow, to reach food at (3,4), I need to go north eventually.\n\nBut from current position, if I go D or L or R, I move away from (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), head at (3,2), so same x, y+2.\n\nSince y decreases down, (3,4) is up.\n\nBut I can't go up now.\n\nIf I go L to (2,2), as above, I get stuck with only down move possible to (2,1), which is south, away.\n\nIf I go R to (4,2), then I can go up to (4,3), then to (4,4), etc., but (3,4) is at x=3, so I need to move left later.\n\nBut (3,4) has short life span, only 5 turns, so I need to eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) has life span 7, (6,5) has 10, so (3,4) is urgent.\n\nBut I might not be able to eat it immediately.\n\nAnother food at (1,1), which is south-west, but there is obstacle at (1,2), so to reach (1,1), I need to go to (1,1) from above or sides, but (1,1) has neighbors: (1,2) obstacle, so only accessible from (2,1) or (1,0) but y=0 wall, so only from (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) can be accessed from (5,5), (6,4) obstacle, (6,6), or (5,5) but (5,5) is snake body now.\n\n(5,5) is currently body, but after moves, it might move.\n\nLet's think about a plan to eat (3,4).\n\nAt turn 67, from (3,2) dir D, I can go D, L, or R.\n\nIf I go D to (3,1), then at turn 68, from (3,1) dir D, I can go L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nSay I go L to (2,1).\n\nThen at turn 68, move L to (2,1) from (3,1) dir D, but after moving to (3,1), direction is D, so from (3,1) dir D, move L to (2,1).\n\nNew head: (2,1)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen body: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), etc. (simulate, but not necessary now)\n\nFrom (2,1), I can then go U to (2,2), but (2,2) might be free.\n\nAt turn 68, if I go to (2,1), then to (2,2) at turn 69.\n\nBut (3,4) is at (3,4), so from (2,2), I can go to (2,3), but (2,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nThis is getting messy. I should consider the distance.\n\nSince (3,4) is close, and I need to eat it, but I have to make a detour because I can't go up directly.\n\nAnother idea: go right to (4,2), then up to (4,3), then left to (3,3) or (3,4).\n\n(3,3) is currently body, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nLet's simulate a sequence.\n\nTurn 67: move R to (4,2) from (3,2) dir D.\n\nAs above, new head (4,2), body: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 68: from (4,2) dir R, possible moves U, D, R (not L).\n\nU to (4,3): free, no food.\n\nD to (4,1): free.\n\nR to (5,2): free.\n\nLet's go U to (4,3) to get closer to (3,4).\n\nMove U to (4,3).\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nDirection U (since moved up).\n\nBody: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)  // tail (5,5) removed, new tail (4,5)? After move, segment 1 to (4,2), segment 2 to (3,2), ..., segment 11 to (4,6), segment 12 to (4,5), so tail at (4,5).\n\nPositions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n\n(3,3) is occupied.\n\nNow, (3,4) is at (3,4), which is adjacent left and up? From (4,3), (3,4) is west and north, so I can move L to (3,3) or U to (4,4), but (3,3) is occupied, so moving L to (3,3) would be collision.\n\nU to (4,4): (4,4) is free, I think.\n\nOr D to (4,2) but (4,2) is now body, occupied.\n\nFrom (4,3) dir U, possible moves: not D (opposite), so U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,4): free\n\nL to (3,3): occupied, collision\n\nR to (5,3): free? (5,3) not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nSo only U or R possible, not L.\n\nIf I go U to (4,4), then at turn 69, head at (4,4) dir U.\n\nThen I can move L to (3,4) to eat the food.\n\n(3,4) is food, and it should be free.\n\nAt turn 69, if I move to (3,4), I eat it.\n\nBut need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, at turn 69, from (4,4) dir U, move L to (3,4).\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nSince I eat food, the snake grows, so tail does not move, new segment added.\n\nBody: the previous positions, but with tail staying.\n\nAfter eating, head at (3,4), then the body segments remain, so (4,4) becomes new segment 1, (4,3) becomes segment 2, etc., and tail stays.\n\nBefore move at turn 69: head at (4,4), body: (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) tail.\n\nMove head to (3,4), which has food, so eat it, length increases.\n\nNew positions: head (3,4)\n\nThen segment 1: (4,4)  // previous head\n\nSegment 2: (4,3)  // previous segment 1\n\nSegment 3: (4,2)  // previous segment 2\n\nSegment 4: (3,2)  // previous segment 3\n\nSegment 5: (3,3)  // previous segment 4\n\nSegment 6: (2,3)  // previous segment 5\n\nSegment 7: (1,3)  // previous segment 6\n\nSegment 8: (1,4)  // previous segment 7\n\nSegment 9: (1,5)  // previous segment 8\n\nSegment 10: (2,5)  // previous segment 9\n\nSegment 11: (2,6)  // previous segment 10\n\nSegment 12: (3,6)  // previous segment 11\n\nSegment 13: (4,6)  // previous segment 12\n\nAnd segment 14: (4,5)  // tail remains, since food eaten, so new segment added at tail position.\n\nTail was (4,5), and since food eaten, it stays, so the snake has 14 segments now.\n\nPositions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n\n(3,3) is occupied, but it's body, not head.\n\nNow, is this safe? Head at (3,4), and (3,3) is adjacent and body, but in snake, the tail moves only if no food eaten, but here food eaten, so the body is there.\n\nBut collision happens if head touches body segment, except the tail cell when moving into it is allowed if tail moves away, but here, since food eaten, tail didn't move, so (3,3) is still body, and head at (3,4) is not touching it directly? Adjacent cells: (3,4) and (3,3) are adjacent vertically, but head is at (3,4), body at (3,3), so if head moves to (3,4) when (3,3) is occupied, is it a collision?\n\nIn standard snake, moving to a cell adjacent to body is not collision; collision only if the head moves to a cell occupied by body.\n\nIn this case, when I move to (3,4), (3,4) was free, no body, so no collision. After moving, head is at (3,4), and (3,3) is a body segment, but they are adjacent, not the same cell, so no collision. Only if head moves to a cell that is occupied.\n\nSo here, (3,4) was free, I moved to it, ate food, no collision.\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nIn this sequence, I can eat (3,4) at turn 69.\n\nTurn 67: move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 68: move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 69: move L to (3,4) and eat.\n\nBut at turn 68, when I move U to (4,3), from (4,2) dir R, I moved U, which is allowed.\n\nThen at turn 69, from (4,3) dir U, I moved L to (3,4), which is left, and since direction was U, moving L is not opposite, so allowed.\n\nAnd (3,4) was free.\n\nIn the body, at that time, (3,3) was occupied, but not (3,4).\n\nSo yes, I can eat it at turn 69.\n\nNow, what about the other moves?\n\nIf I go D from (3,2) at turn 67, to (3,1), then I might not reach (3,4) in time, since life span only to turn 71.\n\nFrom (3,1), I need to go up, but I have to go left or right first, then up, but it might take longer.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), go L to (2,1) at turn 68, then to (2,2) at turn 69, but (2,2) to (2,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), let's see.\n\nTurn 67: move D to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 68: from (3,1) dir D, move L to (2,1)  // assume\n\nNew head (2,1), direction L.\n\nBody: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), etc.\n\nThen turn 69: from (2,1) dir L, can move U, D, L (not R).\n\nU to (2,2): free? At this state, (2,2) might be free.\n\nBut to go to (3,4), I need to go to (2,2), then (2,3), but (2,3) might be body.\n\nAt turn 69, positions: head at (2,1) after turn 68 move.\n\nBefore turn 69 move, positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)  // tail (5,5) removed earlier? When moving to (3,1) at turn 67, tail removed, then to (2,1) at turn 68, another move, tail removed again.\n\nAfter turn 67: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nAfter turn 68: move to (2,1), head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)  // tail (5,5) removed, new tail (4,5)\n\nPositions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n\nNow turn 69: from (2,1) dir L, move U to (2,2)\n\n(2,2) free, so move to (2,2)\n\nNew head (2,2), direction U.\n\nBody: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)  // tail (4,5) remains? No, no food, so tail moves.\n\nAfter move, segment 1 to (2,1), segment 2 to (3,1), ..., segment 12 to (4,6), segment 13 to (4,5), but since no food eaten, tail (4,5) removed, new positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)  // new tail (4,6)\n\n(2,3) is occupied.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move to (2,3)? But (2,3) is occupied, collision.\n\nMove D to (2,1), but (2,1) is now body.\n\nOr move L to (1,2), obstacle.\n\nSo from (2,2), only possible move might be R to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied.\n\nIn this state, (3,2) is body segment, occupied.\n\nSo at turn 69, from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3) occupied, collision; D to (2,1) occupied; L to (1,2) obstacle; R to (3,2) occupied, so no safe move! Dead end.\n\nTherefore, going down to (3,1) at turn 67 and then left to (2,1) leads to a position where I might get stuck.\n\nIf from (3,1) I go right to (4,1), similar issue.\n\nBut in the right path, I can eat the food quickly.\n\nNow, what about going left at turn 67.\n\nIf turn 67: move L to (2,2)\n\nAs earlier, after move: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), etc., and (2,3) occupied.\n\nThen from (2,2) dir L, I can only move D to (2,1), since U to (2,3) collision, L to (1,2) obstacle, R to (3,2) occupied.\n\nSo move D to (2,1) at turn 68.\n\nThen similar to above, might get stuck or take time.\n\nBut (3,4) might expire.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate move is to go right to (4,2) to set up for eating (3,4) in two turns.\n\nThen I can eat at turn 69.\n\nAfter that, I need to think about other food.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nTurn 67: from (3,2) dir D, move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 68: from (4,2) dir R, move U to (4,3)  // to approach (3,4)\n\nTurn 69: from (4,3) dir U, move L to (3,4) and eat.\n\nNow, after eating, head at (3,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow, I need to plan further for other food.\n\nBut for the output, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, say 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 67, so turns 67 to 71 or something.\n\nAfter turn 69, I have eaten (3,4), and snake is longer.\n\nNow, other food: (1,1) and (6,5)\n\n(1,1) has life span 7, so present until turn 73.\n\n(6,5) until turn 76.\n\nNow, head at (3,4) after turn 69.\n\nPositions as above: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nPossible moves: from dir L, cannot move R, so U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,5): (3,5) is free? Earlier we thought (3,5) free, no obstacle, not occupied now? Snake has (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,6), but (3,5) not in list, so free.\n\nD to (3,3): but (3,3) is occupied, body segment, collision.\n\nL to (2,4): (2,4) is obstacle, since internal obstacle (2,4), so collision.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (3,5).\n\nBecause D to (3,3) occupied, L to (2,4) obstacle, so must go U to (3,5).\n\nAt turn 70: move U to (3,5)\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nDirection U.\n\nBody: since no food, tail moves. Previous tail was (4,5)? Positions before move: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (3,5): head (3,5)\n\nSegment 1: (3,4) // previous head\n\nSegment 2: (4,4) // previous seg1\n\n...\n\nSegment 14: (4,6) // previous seg13? Let's index: after eating at turn 69, 14 segments: 0: (3,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (1,3), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (2,6), 12: (3,6), 13: (4,6), 14: (4,5)? Earlier I said segment 14 is (4,5).\n\nIn positions: indices from head: 0: head (3,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (1,3), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (2,6), 12: (3,6), 13: (4,6), 14: (4,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (3,5) no food: head (3,5)\n\nThen segment 1: (3,4)\n\nSegment 2: (4,4)\n\nSegment 3: (4,3)\n\nSegment 4: (4,2)\n\nSegment 5: (3,2)\n\nSegment 6: (3,3)\n\nSegment 7: (2,3)\n\nSegment 8: (1,3)\n\nSegment 9: (1,4)\n\nSegment 10: (1,5)\n\nSegment 11: (2,5)\n\nSegment 12: (2,6)\n\nSegment 13: (3,6)\n\nSegment 14: (4,6)  // previous segment 13\n\nTail (4,5) removed.\n\nSo positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow turn 71: from (3,5) dir U, possible moves: not D (opposite), so U, L, R.\n\nU to (3,6): but (3,6) is occupied by segment 13? Positions: (3,6) is segment 13, body, so if move U to (3,6), collision.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) is segment 11, occupied.\n\nR to (4,5): (4,5) is not occupied now? After move, (4,5) was tail and removed, so free. But (4,5) was tail at turn 69, but after moves, at turn 70, after moving to (3,5), (4,5) is removed, so (4,5) is free? In positions above, (4,5) is not in the list after turn 70 move, so free.\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), not occupied.\n\nAlso, (2,5) occupied, (3,6) occupied.\n\nSo from (3,5), U to (3,6) occupied, collision; L to (2,5) occupied; R to (4,5) free.\n\nSo must go R to (4,5).\n\nMove R to (4,5) at turn 71.\n\n(4,5) has no food, so tail moves.\n\nNew head (4,5), direction R.\n\nBody: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)  // tail (4,6) removed? After turn 70, tail was (4,6), after move, segment 14 to where segment 13 was, but segment 13 is (4,6), so tail moves to (3,6)? Let's see.\n\nBefore turn 71 move: positions head (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (3,3), seg7 (2,3), seg8 (1,3), seg9 (1,4), seg10 (1,5), seg11 (2,5), seg12 (2,6), seg13 (3,6), seg14 (4,6) tail.\n\nMove to (4,5): head (4,5)\n\nThen seg1: (3,5)\n\nseg2: (3,4)\n\nseg3: (4,4)\n\nseg4: (4,3)\n\nseg5: (4,2)\n\nseg6: (3,2)\n\nseg7: (3,3)\n\nseg8: (2,3)\n\nseg9: (1,3)\n\nseg10: (1,4)\n\nseg11: (1,5)\n\nseg12: (2,5)\n\nseg13: (2,6)\n\nseg14: (3,6)  // previous seg13\n\nTail (4,6) removed.\n\nSo positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, we have other food, like (1,1) or (6,5).\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), which is south-west.\n\nBut to reach it, I need to go to (2,1) or something, but (1,2) is obstacle, so only from (2,1).\n\nCurrently, the snake is around (4,5), etc.\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), which is east.\n\nAlso, life span: (1,1) disappears at turn 74, (6,5) at turn 77.\n\nNow, at turn 71, head at (4,5), dir R.\n\nPossible moves: not L (opposite), so U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,6): (4,6) is occupied? After above, (4,6) was removed, so free? Positions: (4,6) not in list, so free.\n\nD to (4,4): (4,4) is seg3, occupied.\n\nR to (5,5): (5,5) is free? Not occupied, not obstacle.\n\n(5,5) had food? No, food at (6,5), not (5,5).\n\n(5,5) was snake earlier, but now free.\n\nAlso, obstacle at (5,1), (6,4), etc., but (5,5) should be free.\n\nSo moves: U to (4,6) free, D to (4,4) occupied, collision; R to (5,5) free.\n\nSo can go U or R.\n\nIf I go R to (5,5), then towards (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), adjacent to (5,5).\n\nBut (6,5) has food.\n\nSo at turn 71, if I go R to (5,5).\n\nNew head (5,5), no food, so tail moves.\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 72: from (5,5) dir R, can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nU to (5,6): free? (5,6) not occupied.\n\nD to (5,4): (5,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), (2,4), (6,4), (1,2). (5,4) not listed, but snake has (3,3), (3,2), etc., not (5,4). Earlier (5,4) was snake but moved. So (5,4) should be free? But is there obstacle? Obstacles include (5,1), but not (5,4), so free.\n\nR to (6,5): (6,5) has food.\n\n(6,5) is free with food.\n\nSo I can move directly to (6,5) at turn 72 and eat.\n\nMove R to (6,5).\n\nThen eat (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I go U at turn 71, I might not reach (6,5) as directly.\n\nSo better to go towards (6,5).\n\nNow, (1,1) is farther, and I might not have time, but life span longer.\n\nBut since I'm already moving east, I can eat (6,5) first.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nSo for the initial turns:\n\nTurn 67: R (to (4,2))\n\nTurn 68: U (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 69: L (to (3,4) eat)\n\nThen turn 70: U (to (3,5), only choice)\n\nTurn 71: R (to (4,5)? Earlier I said from (3,5) to (4,5) at turn 71, but after turn 70, head at (3,5) dir U, move R to (4,5) at turn 71.\n\nIn turn 71, head at (4,5) dir R.\n\nThen turn 72: from (4,5) I can go R to (5,5) or U to (4,6), but to eat (6,5), better go R.\n\nAt turn 71: head at (4,5) dir R, move R to (5,5)\n\nThen at turn 72: head at (5,5) dir R, move R to (6,5) and eat.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, (1,1) might be eaten later, but not in this sequence yet.\n\nFor the output, since I need to provide actions, and think 5+ turns, let's list from turn 67 to, say, turn 72.\n\nBut turn 72 is eating (6,5), which is fine.\n\nNow, to complete at least 5 turns: from 67 to 71 or 72.\n\nTurn 67 to 71 is 5 turns.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 67, I have to start.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 67: R\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: L (eat (3,4))\n\nTurn 70: U (only choice)\n\nTurn 71: R (to (4,5))\n\nThen turn 72: R (to (5,5) or directly to (6,5)? At turn 71, after moving to (5,5), then turn 72 to (6,5).\n\nBut for output, I can provide up to turn 72.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions.\n\nNow, I need to consider if there are risks.\n\nIn the path to (6,5), at turn 72, moving to (6,5), but (6,5) is adjacent to (6,4) which is obstacle, but (6,5) itself is free, so ok.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nNow, what about the tail reward danger? But no food under tail here.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nBut in the beginning, I assumed going right, but is there a better way?\n\nFor example, if I go down or left, I might not eat (3,4) or get stuck.\n\nSo right seems best.\n\nPerhaps go directly to (1,1), but it's farther and (3,4) might expire.\n\n(1,1) life span 7, so I have until turn 73 to eat.\n\nBut from (3,2), to (1,1), I need to go to (2,1) then (1,1), but (1,2) obstacle, so only from (2,1).\n\nBut as before, if I go down or left, I might not reach easily.\n\nWith the sequence I have, I eat two foods by turn 72.\n\n(1,1) can be eaten later if possible.\n\nBut for the plan, I think it's fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 67: R\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: L\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: R\n\nThen, to show more, turn 72: R to (6,5) eat, but since the output might be variable, I can stop at turn 71 or include turn 72.\n\nThe answer format should list actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince the problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", and current turn 67, so up to turn 72 is 6 turns.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 69 I eat, turn 72 eat another.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nAlso, in the state, head direction after each move changes, but I don't need to output direction, only actions.\n\nIn the answer, it's \"Turn t: action\"\n\nSo for turn 67 to 72.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nAt turn 67: from (3,2) dir D, move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 68: from (4,2) dir R, move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 69: from (4,3) dir U, move L to (3,4) eat\n\nTurn 70: from (3,4) dir L, move U to (3,5) (only choice)\n\nTurn 71: from (3,5) dir U, move R to (4,5)\n\nAt turn 71, after moving to (4,5), head dir R.\n\nThen turn 72: from (4,5) dir R, move R to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 73: from (5,5) dir R, move R to (6,5) eat, but that's beyond.\n\nFor output, I can do up to turn 72 or 71.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns, and from 67 to 72 is 6 turns, but actions for turns.\n\nPerhaps list 5 actions: turns 67,68,69,70,71.\n\nThat covers eating one food and moving towards another.\n\nTo be complete, include turn 72.\n\nBut turn 72 action depends on turn 71 state.\n\nIn the plan, at turn 72 I go to (5,5), not directly to (6,5).\n\nIn turn 71, I move to (4,5), then turn 72 to (5,5).\n\nBut I can go directly? From (4,5) to (6,5) not adjacent, so no.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 67: R\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: L\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: R\n\nTurn 72: R (to (5,5))\n\nThen at turn 73, I can go to (6,5) if still there.\n\nBut for output, I think up to turn 72 is fine.\n\nSince the food at (6,5) has long life, it can be eaten later.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: not an issue here.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nIn the moves, all are safe.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 69, when I eat (3,4), it was under the body? No, (3,4) was free, not under body.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under body, but here it wasn't.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and simulated multiple turns ahead (at least 5 turns). The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (3,4) quickly due to its short life span (disappears after turn 71).\n- Avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body.\n- Position the snake to access other food (e.g., (6,5)) after eating (3,4).\n\n### Analysis for Turn 67:\n- **Current head position**: (3,2) with direction Down (D).\n- **Possible moves**: D (to (3,1)), L (to (2,2)), R (to (4,2)). U is invalid due to \"no instant reverse\" rule.\n- **Immediate risks**:\n  - Moving D to (3,1) limits future options and may not reach (3,4) in time.\n  - Moving L to (2,2) leads to a dead end (only D to (2,1) is possible, risking entrapment).\n  - Moving R to (4,2) allows a path to (3,4) by turn 69 and avoids risks.\n- **Food prioritization**: (3,4) must be eaten by turn 71. The sequence R → U → L reaches it by turn 69.\n- **Long-term**: After eating (3,4), the snake can navigate toward (6,5) (life span 10, disappears after turn 77) for additional score.\n\n### Simulated Plan (Turns 67-72):\n1. **Turn 67 (from (3,2), dir D)**: Move R to (4,2). This avoids instant reverse and positions the snake to approach (3,4).\n2. **Turn 68 (from (4,2), dir R)**: Move U to (4,3). This continues the path to (3,4) and avoids obstacles/body.\n3. **Turn 69 (from (4,3), dir U)**: Move L to (3,4) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases). (3,4) is free and safe to eat (no collision or tail risk).\n4. **Turn 70 (from (3,4), dir L)**: Move U to (3,5). This is the only safe move (D and L lead to collisions; U is free).\n5. **Turn 71 (from (3,5), dir U)**: Move R to (4,5). This avoids collisions and starts moving toward (6,5).\n6. **Turn 72 (from (4,5), dir R)**: Move R to (5,5). This progresses toward (6,5) and is safe (U, D, R possible; L is invalid).\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Efficiency**: Eats (3,4) by turn 69 (within life span) and sets up for (6,5) by turn 72.\n- **Safety**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles (e.g., (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)), and body collisions. No tail reward danger (food not under tail).\n- **Long-term**: After turn 72, the snake can eat (6,5) (e.g., turn 73: R to (6,5)) or (1,1) if viable. Survival is prioritized; no risks detected in the 6-turn plan.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 67: R (right)  \nTurn 68: U (up)  \nTurn 69: L (left)  \nTurn 70: U (up)  \nTurn 71: R (right)  \nTurn 72: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 68, and I'm controlling the snake. The grid has walls and obstacles, and there are food items with their positions, values, and life spans.\n\nThe grid size isn't explicitly given, but from the wall borders, it's probably 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume. Walls are at the borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also, there are internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,2), and the body segments follow: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake is 13 segments long. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving right to get to (4,2) from (3,2), I think. Since positions are listed head first, (4,2) is head, then (3,2) is the next segment, so the snake was moving left to get to (4,2)? Let's see the sequence.\n\nPositions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nThe head is at (4,2), and the second segment is at (3,2). So from (3,2) to (4,2), the snake moved right. But the head direction is given as \"R\", which is right, so that matches; it moved right to (4,2).\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (3,4) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (6,5) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (3,4), it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn, so it will be gone by turn 68 + 4 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, life_span is the number of turns it will be present, including t. So if life_span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is N, it will disappear after N more turns, meaning it is present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N.\n\nFor example, at turn 68, life_span=4 for (3,4), so it will be present on turns 68, 69, 70, 71, and disappear at turn 72.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life_span=6, present turns 68 to 73, gone at 74.\n\n(6,5) life_span=9, present turns 68 to 76, gone at 77.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid: 8x8, walls at borders: so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, except where internal obstacles are, but internal obstacles are separate points.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo let's list all obstacles:\n\n- All border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n\n- Plus internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(1,2) is an internal obstacle, but (1,2) might be on the border? x=1, y=2, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,2) is not border, it's internal. Similarly others.\n\nNow snake: head at (4,2), body: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nSo the tail is at (5,5).\n\nCurrent head direction is R (right), so from previous position, it was at (3,2) and moved right to (4,2).\n\nNow possible moves: I can go U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nBut cannot reverse instantly. Since head direction is R, reverse would be L (left). So I cannot move left on the next turn.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, R. L is not allowed because it would be opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so moving left would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo for turn 68, I can choose U, D, or R.\n\nNow, let's see the positions around head (4,2):\n\n- Up (U): (4,3)\n\n- Down (D): (4,1)\n\n- Right (R): (5,2)\n\n- Left (L): (3,2) but L is not allowed, and also (3,2) is the snake body, so it would be collision if I go there, but since it's the second segment, and tail will move, let's think about collisions.\n\nCollision rules: head touches any body segment except that it can move to the tail cell because the tail moves.\n\nSpecifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (5,5), which is not adjacent to head, so moving to any body cell would be collision except if it's the tail and I'm moving to it.\n\nHere, (3,2) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (5,5).\n\nSo if I move left to (3,2), that's a body segment, and since it's not the tail, it would be collision, death.\n\nBut I can't move left anyway because of reverse restriction.\n\nNow, let's check possible moves from (4,2):\n\n- U: (4,3) - is this free? Let's see what is at (4,3).\n\nSnake positions: (4,2) head, (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), etc. (3,3) is a body segment, but (4,3) is not listed, so it should be empty? Snake positions are only where snake is, so other cells are free unless wall or food or obstacle.\n\n(4,3) is not in snake positions, not a wall, not an obstacle? Obstacles are walls and internal points.\n\nInternal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,3) is not among them.\n\nWalls: x=0,7 or y=0,7. (4,3) x=4, y=3, not border, so no wall.\n\nSo (4,3) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, D: (4,1) - x=4,y=1, not border, not in obstacles? Obstacles: (5,1) is an obstacle, but (4,1) is different. (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nR: (5,2) - x=5,y=2, not border, not in obstacles? Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,2) is not, so free.\n\nBut (5,2) might have something? Not snake, not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n\nNow, also, food locations: (3,4), (1,1), (6,5)\n\n(4,3) has no food, (4,1) no food, (5,2) no food.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves.\n\nMoreover, there might be food under snake body? But the rule says food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n\nIn this case, let's see if any food is under snake.\n\nFood: (3,4), (1,1), (6,5)\n\nSnake positions: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5)\n\n(3,4) is a food location, and (3,4) is not in snake positions? Snake has (3,3), (3,6), etc., but not (3,4). (3,4) is free? Or is it occupied?\n\nSnake positions list: (3,2), (3,3), then next is (2,3), so (3,4) is not occupied by snake. Similarly, (1,1) not occupied, (6,5) not occupied.\n\n(1,1) is a food, and snake has (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,1) or (1,2), but (1,2) is an obstacle, so not food there.\n\nSo all food is on free cells.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nFor turn 68, from (4,2), head dir R.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, R (L not allowed and dangerous)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option.\n\nFirst, if I go R to (5,2): what is there? Free, no food. Then snake moves, head to (5,2), tail moves from (5,5) to? When snake moves, if no food eaten, tail is removed, so new tail would be the previous second last, but since no food, length same.\n\nAfter moving to (5,2), new positions: head (5,2), then (4,2) becomes body, then (3,2), (3,3), etc., up to (4,5), and tail was (5,5), but since moved, tail is removed, so new tail is (4,5)? Let's see the sequence.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (4,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (2,3), 4: (1,3), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,6), 9: (3,6), 10: (4,6), 11: (4,5), 12: tail (5,5)\n\nIf move to (5,2), new head (5,2), then body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), ..., up to (4,5), and since no food eaten, tail (5,5) is removed, so the new snake is from (5,2) to (4,5), with (4,5) as new tail? Positions: new head (5,2), then previous head (4,2) now first body, then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), and that's it, since tail removed. Length 12 now? Original 13 segments, move without eating, remove tail, so 12 segments.\n\nOriginal positions: 13 cells. After move: head moves to new cell, and tail is removed, so new length 12 if no food.\n\nBut in positions, new head, then all previous positions except the last one is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] — (4,5) is the new tail, and (5,5) is gone.\n\n(4,5) was previously second last, now last.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U to (4,3): new head (4,3), body (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), etc., remove tail (5,5), so new tail (4,6) or something.\n\nD to (4,1): new head (4,1), body (4,2), etc., remove (5,5).\n\nNo food eaten in any case for turn 68.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFood available: (3,4) with life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 71 to get it, since disappears at turn 72.\n\n(1,1) life span 6, by turn 73.\n\n(6,5) life span 9, by turn 76.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger. If head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (5,5), head at (4,2), not adjacent. Adjacent means next cell, so (4,2) and (5,5) are not adjacent; distance is |4-5| + |2-5| =1+3=4, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue now.\n\nNow, let's plan a path to get food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nFirst, the food at (3,4) is close, only 2 cells away: from (4,2) to (3,4) is one up and one left, but I can't go directly.\n\n(4,2) to (3,4): Δx=-1, Δy=+2, so not adjacent; need multiple moves.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is farther, (6,5) is at (6,5), which is near the tail area.\n\nLet's see the grid with snake and obstacles.\n\nI should sketch a grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, x=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (4,2), body: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), tail (5,5)\n\nFood: (3,4), (1,1), (6,5)\n\nNow, from head (4,2), I can go U to (4,3), D to (4,1), or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I go U to (4,3), then I'm closer to (3,4). (4,3) to (3,4) is left and up? (4,3) to (3,4) is left and up, but (3,4) is at same y? (4,3) and (3,4): x-1, y+1, so diagonal, but I can only move orthogonally. So from (4,3), I can go to (3,3), but (3,3) is a body segment currently, but if I move, it might be free later.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (4,3), then from there, I can go to (4,4), or (3,3), or (5,3), or (4,2) but (4,2) will be body.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAlso, life span of (3,4) is 4, so I have until turn 71 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, others have more time.\n\nBut (3,4) is close, so I should try to get it soon.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards (3,4).\n\nFrom (4,2), if I go U to (4,3), then I'm at (4,3), and (3,4) is adjacent: left and up, but I can only move to (4,4), (3,3), (5,3), or (4,2) but (4,2) is now body.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is adjacent to (3,3), (4,4), (3,5), (2,4), but (2,4) is an obstacle, so not accessible.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle, so (3,4) can be accessed from (3,3), (4,4), or (3,5).\n\nNow, from (4,3), I can go to (3,3) or to (4,4), both possible ways to reach (3,4).\n\nBut (3,3) is currently occupied by snake, but after I move, the snake moves, so positions change.\n\nAfter turn 68, if I go U to (4,3), new positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) — tail (4,5), since (5,5) removed.\n\n(3,3) is still part of the body, at position index 3 or something.\n\nNew positions: [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nSo (3,3) is occupied.\n\nIf I want to go to (3,4) from (4,3), I can go to (3,3) or to (4,4).\n\nIf I go to (3,3), that is currently occupied, but after move, when I move to (3,3), what is the state?\n\nAt turn 69, from (4,3), I can move to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is the fourth segment in the new snake, so it's a body cell, not the tail. Tail is at (4,5).\n\nSince it's not the tail, moving to (3,3) would cause collision, death.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move to (3,3) directly from (4,3) because it's occupied by body.\n\nI could go to (4,4) instead.\n\n(4,4) is currently free? No snake, no wall, no obstacle. Food? No, food at (3,4), not (4,4).\n\nSo from (4,3), I can go to (4,4) safely.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go to (3,4) to eat the food.\n\n(3,4) is adjacent: left from (4,4).\n\nAnd (3,4) has food, so if I go to (3,4), I eat it, snake grows.\n\nSimilarly, I could go other ways.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFor turn 68: if I go U to (4,3), then turn 69: from (4,3) to (4,4) (say U again, but direction might change).\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), head direction: I moved up, so new direction U.\n\nThen at turn 69, from (4,3), I can go U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, L to (3,3) body, R to (5,3) free? (5,3) not occupied, etc.\n\nSo possible to go U to (4,4).\n\nThen at (4,4), I can go L to (3,4) to eat food.\n\n(3,4) is food, so eating it, snake grows, so tail not removed, new segment added.\n\nThis would be on turn 70 if I start from turn 68 U.\n\nTimeline:\n\nTurn 68: move U to (4,3) — no food\n\nTurn 69: move U to (4,4) — no food\n\nTurn 70: move L to (3,4) — eat food, snake grows to length 14.\n\nLife span of (3,4) is 4, present until turn 71, so turn 70 is fine.\n\nNow, after eating, positions: from turn 69, head at (4,4), positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] — tail (4,6)? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 68: positions [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nAfter turn 69: move to (4,4), so new head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), and tail (4,5) removed? No food, so remove tail (4,5), so positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] — tail (4,6)\n\n(4,6) is now tail.\n\nTurn 70: move L to (3,4), which has food, so eat, new head (3,4), body: previous head (4,4) and all, but since food eaten, tail not removed, so positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) — and no removal, so length 14, tail still (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is the last.\n\nNow, I have the food.\n\nBut is this safe? When I move to (3,4), is there collision? (3,4) was free, no issue.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer.\n\nNow, what about other moves? I could go different paths.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), if I go D to (4,1), but (4,1) is free, but that might lead away from food.\n\nOr R to (5,2).\n\nBut (3,4) is time-sensitive, so I should prioritize that.\n\nNow, other food: (1,1) and (6,5).\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), but there is obstacle at (1,2), and snake is around (1,3),(1,4),(1,5), so (1,1) might be accessible, but with obstacle at (1,2), which is adjacent.\n\n(1,1) can be accessed from (1,0) but y=0 is wall, or from (0,1) x=0 wall, or from (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) is isolated? (1,1) can only be reached from (1,2) or (2,1), but (1,2) is obstacle, so only from (2,1)?\n\n(1,1) adjacent cells: (1,0) wall, (1,2) obstacle, (0,1) wall, (2,1) — (2,1) is not wall or obstacle? x=2,y=1, not border, not in obstacles. Obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,1) not listed, so free.\n\nSo (1,1) can be accessed only from (2,1).\n\n(2,1) to (1,1) is left.\n\nBut (2,1) must be reached first.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) at (6,5), which is near (5,5) tail, but (6,5) has obstacles around? (6,4) is obstacle, (6,1) obstacle, but (6,5) itself is not obstacle.\n\n(6,5) adjacent: (6,4) obstacle, (6,6) but y=6, not wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 is ok, but (6,6) is free? Not wall, not obstacle. (5,5), (7,5) x=7 wall, (6,4) obstacle.\n\nSo (6,5) can be accessed from (5,5), (6,6), or (7,5) but wall, so only (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is currently tail, but will move.\n\nBack to the immediate choice.\n\nFor turn 68, going U to (4,3) seems good to reach (3,4) soon.\n\nBut let's check if there are dangers.\n\nIf I go U to (4,3), then to (4,4), then to (3,4), as above.\n\nAfter that, at (3,4), I need to think next moves.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,1) has life span 6, so by turn 73, I have time.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) has more time.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother thing: the area around (1,3) to (1,5) is a bit crowded, but since I'm moving away, it might be ok.\n\nAfter eating at (3,4), head at (3,4), then I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's see the grid after eating.\n\nHead at (3,4), body segments: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, L to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, R to (4,4) but (4,4) is body.\n\n(3,4) adjacent:\n\n- U: (3,5) — not in snake positions? Snake has (1,5), (2,5), etc., but (3,5) not listed, so free? No food, no obstacle.\n\n- D: (3,3) — is body, not tail (tail is (4,6)), so collision if move there.\n\n- L: (2,4) — obstacle, wall? (2,4) is internal obstacle, so deadly.\n\n- R: (4,4) — is body, not tail.\n\nSo only possible move from (3,4) is U to (3,5).\n\nAfter eating at turn 70, head at (3,4), so at turn 71, I must move to (3,5), since that's the only free adjacent cell.\n\n(3,5) is free, yes.\n\nThen move to (3,5).\n\nNo food there.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to other places.\n\nBut (3,5) adjacent: U to (3,6), but (3,6) is body? Snake has (3,6) as a segment.\n\nAfter turn 70: positions head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) tail.\n\n(3,6) is at index 12? Positions: index 0: (3,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (1,3), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (2,6), 12: (3,6), 13: (4,6) — length 14.\n\nAfter turn 71: move to (3,5), new head (3,5), then body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), and remove tail (4,6), so positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] — tail (3,6)\n\nNow from (3,5), adjacent cells: U to (3,6) but (3,6) is now body? In new positions, (3,6) is the tail? After move, tail is (3,6), but (3,6) is adjacent to head (3,5).\n\n(3,5) and (3,6) differ in y, |dy|=1, so adjacent.\n\nIf I move to (3,6), which is the tail, it should be ok, because tail will move, but according to rule, moving to tail cell is allowed because tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if I move to (3,6), it is the tail, so no collision, tail moves, but since I'm moving to it, and it's tail, it might be eaten if food, but here no food, so just move, tail is removed or something.\n\nIn this case, (3,6) is the tail, I move to it, so head moves to (3,6), and since no food, tail is removed, but the tail was at (3,6), and head moves to it, so effectively, the snake moves, and the tail cell is vacated, but head takes the position, so no growth.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to tail cell, and no food, then the tail is removed, and head is at that cell, so the snake shortens? No.\n\nStandard snake: if head moves to a cell, if it's food, grow, else if it's empty, move, remove tail.\n\nIf head moves to tail cell, and tail is not eaten or something.\n\nRule says: moving to tail cell is allowed, and since tail moves, no collision.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose tail at T, head moves to T.\n\nThen new head at T, and since no food, the old tail is removed, but T is now head, so the segment that was tail is gone, and head is at T, so the snake effectively moves, with tail removed from previous position.\n\nIn this case, positions: before move, head at (3,5), tail at (3,6).\n\nMove head to (3,6), which is tail.\n\nNew head at (3,6), and the old tail (3,6) is... since head moved to it, and it's not food, we remove the old tail, but the cell is now head, so the snake positions: new head (3,6), then the previous body from (3,4) to (3,6) but (3,6) was tail, now head, so the body is (3,4), (4,4), etc., and the last segment before tail was (2,6) or something.\n\nPrevious positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] tail (3,6)\n\nMove head to (3,6), which is current tail.\n\nSince moved to tail, no collision, and no food, so new head at (3,6), and the old tail is removed, so the body is (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), ..., up to (2,6), and (2,6) becomes new tail? Let's see: new positions: head (3,6), then previous head (3,5) now first body, then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), and since tail removed, (3,6) was tail, removed, so (2,6) is now tail.\n\nPositions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)] — tail (2,6)\n\nLength decreased by one? Original 14, now 14 positions? From head to tail: 14 cells? List: indices 0 to 13, 14 cells? Before move, positions had 14 cells: from (3,5) to (3,6) index 0 to 13.\n\nAfter move: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) — that's 14 cells, tail (2,6). (2,6) was previously index 11 or something, now last.\n\nBut the tail moved from (3,6) to (2,6)? No, the snake moved, head to (3,6), which was tail, so the segment that was at (3,6) is now head, and the tail is the previous one before last, which was (2,6).\n\nIn terms of position, the cell (3,6) is now head, and (2,6) is tail.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut in this case, from (3,5), I can move to (3,6), which is tail, allowed.\n\nI can also move to other directions.\n\nFrom (3,5): adjacent cells:\n\n- U: (3,6) — which is tail, can move to it\n\n- D: (3,4) — but (3,4) is body, not tail, collision\n\n- L: (2,5) — (2,5) is body? In positions, (2,5) is at index 10 or something, not tail, so collision\n\n- R: (4,5) — (4,5) is not in current positions? After turn 71 positions, (4,5) is not there; previous was (4,6) but removed. (4,5) is free? Not occupied, no obstacle, so can move to (4,5)\n\n(4,5) was tail at some point, but now free.\n\nIn turn 71 positions, cells occupied: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nSo (4,5) is not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) to (4,5) is right, x+1.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\n(3,6) is tail, (4,5) is free.\n\nIf I go to (4,5), then later I can go to (6,5) food or something.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nBack to turn 68.\n\nIf I go U, I can get (3,4) food by turn 70.\n\nBut after that, I might be in a position where only one move is possible, to (3,5), then from there I have choices.\n\nBut is there a better initial move?\n\nSuppose at turn 68, I go R to (5,2).\n\nThen new head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), etc., remove tail (5,5), so positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] tail (4,5)\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go U, D, L, R? Head direction: I moved right, so dir R.\n\nCannot move left (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1) but (5,1) is obstacle, so deadly, R to (6,2), or L to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, collision.\n\n(4,2) is second segment, not tail.\n\nSo possible: U to (5,3) or R to (6,2).\n\n(5,3) free? Not occupied, no obstacle.\n\n(6,2) free? x=6,y=2, not border, not obstacle (obstacles (6,4),(6,1), not (6,2)), so free.\n\nSay go to (5,3) or (6,2).\n\nBut (3,4) food is at (3,4), which is farther now, and I have only until turn 71 to eat it.\n\nFrom (5,2), to reach (3,4), need to go left and up, but snake body is in the way.\n\nFor example, if I go U to (5,3), then I can go to (5,4), then (4,4), then (3,4) or something.\n\nBut (4,4) might be free later.\n\nBut let's see turns.\n\nTurn 68: go R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 69: from (5,2) go U to (5,3) — assume\n\nThen positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) — tail (4,5) removed? After turn 68, positions tail (4,5), after move to (5,3), remove tail (4,5), so positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] tail (4,6)\n\n(4,6) tail.\n\nTurn 70: from (5,3) can go to (5,4), or (4,3), or (6,3), etc.\n\n(5,4) free? Not occupied, no obstacle.\n\nGo to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 71: from (5,4) to (4,4) or (5,5), etc.\n\n(4,4) is free? In current positions, not occupied.\n\nBut to eat (3,4), need to go to (4,4) then (3,4) on turn 72? But (3,4) disappears at turn 72, meaning gone before turn 72 or at turn 72?\n\nLife span: at turn 68, life_span=4, so present turns 68,69,70,71, gone at turn 72.\n\nSo must eat by turn 71.\n\nTurn 71 is the last chance.\n\nIn this path, at turn 71, if I'm at (5,4), I can go to (4,4), but (3,4) is not eaten yet.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (3,4) not adjacent.\n\nSo I need to be at (4,4) or (3,3) or (3,5) to reach (3,4) on turn 71.\n\nBut (3,3) is body, (3,5) might be free.\n\nIf I go directly, from (5,4) on turn 71, I can go to (4,4), then on turn 72, but (3,4) is gone, so I miss it.\n\nIf from (5,3) on turn 70, I go left to (4,3), but (4,3) may not be free.\n\nAt turn 69, positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), ... so (4,3) not occupied, free.\n\nFrom (5,3) at turn 70, I can go L to (4,3).\n\nThen at (4,3), I can go to (4,4) or (3,3), but (3,3) is body.\n\nGo to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 71: from (4,4) to (3,4) to eat.\n\nTurn 71: move to (3,4), eat food.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nTimeline:\n\nTurn 68: R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 69: U to (5,3) — for example\n\nTurn 70: L to (4,3) — (4,3) is free? At turn 69, positions: after move to (5,3), positions [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] so (4,3) not occupied, free.\n\nGo to (4,3)\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — remove tail (4,6)? No food, so remove tail (4,6), positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] tail (3,6)\n\n(3,6) tail.\n\nTurn 71: from (4,3) go to (4,4)? (4,4) free, then to (3,4) on turn 72? But (3,4) gone at turn 72.\n\nTurn 71 move to (4,4), but (3,4) not eaten yet.\n\nFrom (4,3), at turn 71, I can go directly to (3,4)? (4,3) to (3,4) is left and up, not adjacent orthogonally; only if diagonal, but no, only orthogonal moves.\n\nSo from (4,3), I can go to (4,4), (3,3), (5,3), or (4,2).\n\n(3,4) is not adjacent to (4,3); (4,3) and (3,4) are diagonal.\n\nSo I must go to (4,4) first or (3,3), but (3,3) is body, cannot.\n\nSo only to (4,4) or other.\n\nThen from (4,4) on turn 72, (3,4) is gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (3,4) if I go to (5,2) on turn 68; I would miss it because I need two moves from (5,2) to reach a point adjacent to (3,4), but by turn 71, I might not be able to get there in time.\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 68, to (5,3) on 69, to (4,3) on 70, then on turn 71 at (4,3), I can go to (4,4), but not to (3,4) directly.\n\nIf I go to (3,3) from (4,3), but (3,3) is body, collision.\n\nSo no, I cannot reach (3,4) by turn 71 if I start by going right.\n\nTherefore, to get the (3,4) food, I must go up on turn 68.\n\nIf I go down to (4,1), similar issue, (4,1) is farther, and I might not reach in time.\n\n(4,1) to (3,4) is even farther.\n\nSo only by going up can I get the food safely.\n\nMoreover, going up also avoids the obstacle at (5,1) and others.\n\nNow, what about the tail reward danger? Not relevant now.\n\nAlso, long-term, after getting (3,4), I can go for other food.\n\nFor example, (1,1) or (6,5).\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), accessible only from (2,1), as I thought.\n\n(2,1) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) at (6,5), can be from (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nCurrently, after getting (3,4), head at (3,4), then must go to (3,5), then from there to (4,5) or (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is tail at some point.\n\nBut let's not plan all now.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1, for several turns, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output actions for a sequence, I think.\n\nThe answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns; I think I need to provide a sequence for the next few turns, at least until I eat the food or something.\n\nBut to be safe, I can provide until turn 70 or 71.\n\nSince the food at (3,4) is critical, I should go for it.\n\nAnother thing: if I go U on turn 68, then U on 69 to (4,4), then L on 70 to (3,4) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 69, when I go to (4,4), is there any issue?\n\nAlso, after that, as I thought, on turn 71, I must go to (3,5), then from there I can go to (4,5) or (3,6).\n\n(4,5) is free, and (6,5) food is there, so I can head towards it.\n\n(1,1) might be harder to get because of the obstacle at (1,2), and it's on the corner.\n\nBut life span longer.\n\nSo for now, plan to get (3,4).\n\nThus for turn 68: U\n\nThen turn 69: U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 70: L to (3,4) eat food.\n\nThen turn 71: from (3,4) only U to (3,5)\n\nThen at (3,5), I can go to (4,5) or (3,6).\n\n(4,5) is towards (6,5), and (3,6) is tail, but moving to tail is ok, but might not be productive.\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), so from (4,5), I can go to (5,5), then (6,5), but (5,5) may have issues.\n\nCurrently, after turn 70, positions with food eaten: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) tail.\n\nAfter turn 71: move U to (3,5), new head (3,5), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), remove tail (4,6)? No food, so remove tail, positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] tail (3,6)\n\nNow from (3,5), I can go R to (4,5) or U to (3,6).\n\n(4,5) is free, no issue.\n\n(3,6) is tail, can move to it.\n\nBut moving to (4,5) might be better for future to reach (6,5).\n\n(6,5) has life span 9, so until turn 76, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, I can go for (1,1), but it might be risky.\n\n(1,1) requires going to (2,1), then to (1,1), but (1,1) has only one access, so if I go there, I might get stuck or something.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) to (1,1), eat, then head at (1,1), and adjacent cells: only (2,1) which is body, or walls/obstacles, so I can only go back to (2,1), but (2,1) is body, collision, unless it's tail.\n\nBut after eating, snake grows, so (2,1) is not tail.\n\nSo if I eat (1,1), I go to (1,1), then the only adjacent cell is (2,1), which is now body, so I die next turn.\n\nIs that right?\n\n(1,1) adjacent: (1,0) wall, (1,2) obstacle, (0,1) wall, (2,1) only.\n\nSo after moving to (1,1) to eat, head at (1,1), then (2,1) is the previous head, now body.\n\nThen from (1,1), I must move, but only possible move is to (2,1), which is body, not tail (unless tail), so collision, death.\n\nTherefore, eating (1,1) is fatal; I cannot escape after eating it.\n\nBecause it's a dead end.\n\nSimilarly, for any food in a cell with only one access, if that access is blocked by body after eating, it might kill me.\n\nIn this case, (1,1) should be avoided.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) might be ok, since it has multiple accesses.\n\n(6,5) adjacent: (5,5), (6,6), (6,4) obstacle, (7,5) wall.\n\nSo from (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nIf I eat from (5,5), then head at (6,5), and (5,5) is now body, so I can go to (6,6) if free.\n\n(6,6) should be free.\n\nThen no problem.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,6), etc.\n\nSo (6,5) is safe to eat.\n\n(1,1) is not safe; I should avoid it.\n\nTherefore, I should not go for (1,1); it's a trap.\n\nSo only food to get is (3,4) and (6,5).\n\n(3,4) soon, then (6,5).\n\nBack to the sequence.\n\nFor turn 68: go U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 69: go U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 70: go L to (3,4) eat\n\nThen turn 71: must go U to (3,5)\n\nNow at turn 71, after move to (3,5), positions as above, head at (3,5), tail at (3,6)? In the positions after turn 71 move: head (3,5), tail (3,6)\n\n(3,6) is tail.\n\nNow for turn 72: from (3,5), I can go to (4,5) or to (3,6).\n\nGoing to (3,6) is moving to tail, allowed, but then I stay in the area.\n\nBetter to go to (4,5) to move towards the right.\n\n(4,5) is free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,5), then to (6,5) to eat.\n\n(5,5) may be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 71 positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\n(5,5) not occupied, free.\n\nFood at (6,5).\n\nSo from (3,5), turn 72: go R to (4,5)\n\nThen new positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), remove tail (3,6), so positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)] tail (2,6)\n\nThen turn 73: from (4,5) go to (5,5)? (5,5) free, go R to (5,5)\n\nNew head (5,5), body (4,5), etc., remove tail (2,6), positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)] tail (2,5)\n\nTurn 74: from (5,5) go to (6,5) to eat, since (6,5) has food.\n\n(6,5) adjacent right.\n\nEat, grow.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut (6,5) life span 9, so by turn 76, turn 74 is fine.\n\nIn this sequence, I get both foods.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 68.\n\nSo let's list:\n\nTurn 68: U (up)\n\nTurn 69: U (up) to (4,4)\n\nTurn 70: L (left) to (3,4) eat\n\nTurn 71: U (up) to (3,5)\n\nThen, as above, but I can stop here or add more.\n\nSince the format might expect a sequence, but it doesn't specify length.\n\nI can provide until turn 71 or further.\n\nBut to be safe, at least until I eat the food.\n\nTurn 71 is after eating.\n\nPerhaps provide 5 turns: turn 68 to 72.\n\nTurn 72: from (3,5) to (4,5), which is R.\n\nIn my earlier, at turn 72, I go to (4,5).\n\nBut let's confirm directions.\n\nAfter turn 70, head at (3,4), direction: I moved left to (3,4), so dir L.\n\nThen turn 71, move U to (3,5), so now dir U.\n\nThen at turn 72, from (3,5), I can move R to (4,5), which is not reverse, since reverse of U is D, not R.\n\nSo allowed.\n\nThen turn 73: to (5,5), R again.\n\nBut (5,5) might be free, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, no issue.\n\nTo avoid the (1,1) food since it's dangerous.\n\nSo for output:\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: L\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nAnd since I thought ahead, I can add turn 72: R to (4,5)\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nThe answer should be in the boxed format.\n\nAlso, for turn 68, I must specify the action.\n\nIn the sequence, I have turns 68 to 71.\n\nTurn 71 is moving to (3,5), after eating.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should include until I start moving to the next food.\n\nBut since the question is to think ahead, outputting the critical actions is ok.\n\nAnother thing: in turn 69, when I go to (4,4), is there any risk? No.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (2,4) is near, but I'm not going there.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the plan is to first eat the time-sensitive positive food at (3,4) (life span 4, must be eaten by turn 71) by moving up on turn 68 to position (4,3), then up again on turn 69 to (4,4), and left on turn 70 to (3,4) to consume the food. This path is safe and efficient, avoiding collisions and leveraging the snake's current position. After eating, the snake must move up on turn 71 to (3,5) as it is the only safe move from (3,4). Looking further ahead (5+ turns), the next goal is to eat the food at (6,5) (life span 9, can be eaten later). From (3,5) on turn 72, moving right to (4,5) begins this path, avoiding the dangerous food at (1,1) (which would trap the snake after eating due to the obstacle at (1,2) and limited access).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Turn 68 Action (U)**: Moving up to (4,3) avoids the reverse move (left, not allowed) and positions the snake closer to (3,4). Down (to (4,1)) and right (to (5,2)) were rejected as they risk missing the (3,4) food by turn 71 or leading to less efficient paths.\n- **Turn 69 Action (U)**: Continuing up to (4,4) is safe and sets up the direct move to (3,4).\n- **Turn 70 Action (L)**: Moving left to (3,4) eats the food, growing the snake to length 14. This is done on turn 70, within the life span (disappears at turn 72).\n- **Turn 71 Action (U)**: From (3,4), moving up to (3,5) is the only safe move, as other directions (down to (3,3), left to (2,4) obstacle, right to (4,4) body) are deadly.\n- **Turn 72 Action (R)**: Moving right to (4,5) starts the path toward (6,5), which has a longer life span. This move is safe and not a reverse (current direction after turn 71 is up, so right is allowed).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: Avoiding (1,1) is critical, as eating it would cause immediate collision on the next turn due to the single-access cell. The path to (6,5) is planned for turns beyond 72 (e.g., via (5,5)), with ample time (life span until turn 76). The snake must steer clear of obstacles like (6,4) and (5,1) during this path.\n\n### Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 68: U  \nTurn 69: U  \nTurn 70: L  \nTurn 71: U  \nTurn 72: R\n}",

        "score": 12,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 69, and I have to plan the next moves to maximize the score while avoiding risks. I should think at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (1,1) to (6,6) for playable cells, but with internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles are: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). These are walls that the snake cannot move into.\n\nSnake positions: Head at (4,3), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). So the snake has 13 segments. Head is at (4,3) and direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to get to (4,3). From the positions, it went from (4,2) to (4,3), so yes, moving Up.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (3,4) with value 1 and life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including this turn, so if not eaten by turn 72, it's gone.\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 5. Disappears after turn 74? Life span 5, so if spawned before, but we don't know when it spawned. Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 69, life span is 3 for (3,4), meaning it has 3 turns left including turn 69. So after turn 69, it has 2 turns left, and so on. Similarly for others.\n\nLife span: if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N. For example, (3,4) with life span 3 at turn 69: present on turn 69, 70, 71; gone on turn 72.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 5: present on turns 69 to 73, gone on 74.\n\n(6,5) life span 8: present on turns 69 to 76, gone on 77.\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to plan the moves. Current head position (4,3), direction Up. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nNo instant reverse: current direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) on the next turn, because that would be opposite. So possible moves from (4,3) are: Up to (4,4), Left to (3,3), Right to (5,3).\n\nDown is not possible because reverse.\n\nNow, check if these cells are safe.\n\nFirst, (4,4): is it occupied or wall?\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n\nSo occupied: (4,3) head, (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)\n\n(3,3) is a body segment, not head. Head is (4,3).\n\nNow, (4,4): is it occupied? From the list, no. (4,4) is not in the snake positions.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,4) is within 1-6 in both, since grid from (1,1) to (6,6)? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\n(4,4) is (4,4), which is fine.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,4) not in there.\n\nSo (4,4) is empty and safe to move to.\n\nNext, Left to (3,3): (3,3) is a body segment. Can I move there?\n\nAccording to rules, moving into tail segment is allowed because tail will move, but (3,3) is not the tail; tail is (4,5), I think.\n\nSnake positions: head (4,3), then (4,2) is next, then (3,2), (3,3), etc., up to (4,5) which is the tail.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, and tail moves away from its current position.\n\nSo if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it's ok because tail will move, so no collision.\n\nBut if head moves to a cell occupied by any other body segment, it collides and dies.\n\nHere, (3,3) is occupied by a body segment. Is it the tail? Tail is (4,5), so (3,3) is not tail; it's a middle segment. So moving to (3,3) would cause collision with body.\n\nTherefore, cannot move left to (3,3).\n\nConfirm: positions: index 0: head (4,3), 1: (4,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (3,3), 4: (2,3), 5: (1,3), 6: (1,4), 7: (1,5), 8: (2,5), 9: (2,6), 10: (3,6), 11: (4,6), 12: (4,5) tail.\n\nSo (3,3) is position 3, a body segment, not tail. So if head moves to (3,3), it would be on a body cell, and since that cell won't be vacated immediately, it collides.\n\nOnly if it were the tail, it might be ok, but here it's not.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo for (3,3), it's not tail, so collision.\n\nThus, cannot move Left to (3,3).\n\nNow, Right to (5,3): (5,3) is not in snake positions. Walls: borders ok, internal obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,3) not in obstacles. Obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,3) is clear.\n\nSo (5,3) is safe.\n\nAlso, Down to (4,2): but (4,2) is occupied by the snake body, position 1, not tail. Tail is (4,5), so (4,2) is body, cannot move there. Also, down is reverse direction, which is not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: Up to (4,4) or Right to (5,3).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nFood available: (3,4), (1,1), (6,5)\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is adjacent to head? Head at (4,3), (3,4) is left and up? From (4,3), (3,4) is not directly adjacent; adjacent cells are (4,4) up, (4,2) down (invalid), (3,3) left (invalid), (5,3) right.\n\n(3,4) is one step away but not in the cardinal directions directly; it's diagonal? No, (3,4) is left and up from (4,3), but since we can only move orthogonally, to reach (3,4), I need to move left then up, or up then left, etc.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is far, and (6,5) is also not close.\n\nNow, (3,4) has short life span, only 3 turns including this one, so I might want to eat it soon if possible.\n\nBut I need to see the path.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nI should draw a grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions: let's list coordinates:\n\n- (4,3) head\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (4,5) tail\n\nFood: (3,4), (1,1), (6,5)\n\nNow, from head (4,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up (U) to (4,4)\n\n- Right (R) to (5,3)\n\nLeft and down are invalid as discussed.\n\nNow, I need to plan for multiple turns.\n\nAlso, since I have to output actions for several turns, probably at least 5, but the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" and it might be for a sequence, but I think I need to specify a sequence of actions starting from turn 69.\n\nBut I should plan a path.\n\nFirst, let's consider eating (3,4) since it's close and short-lived.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4). From (4,3), I can go to (4,4) or (5,3).\n\nIf I go to (4,4), then from there, I can go to (3,4) directly? (4,4) to (3,4) is left, which might be possible depending on the state.\n\nBut when I move, the snake moves, so positions change.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAt turn 69, head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nOption 1: Move Up to (4,4)\n\nThen new head position (4,4), direction Up.\n\nSnake now: head (4,4), then body (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). Tail was (4,5), but since head moved to (4,4), the segment that was at (4,3) is now at body, and tail (4,5) is removed? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo after moving to (4,4):\n\n- New head: (4,4)\n\n- Then the previous head (4,3) becomes the neck, so positions: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), and tail was (4,6) or (4,5)? Positions: before move, segments: 0:(4,3), 1:(4,2), 2:(3,2), 3:(3,3), 4:(2,3), 5:(1,3), 6:(1,4), 7:(1,5), 8:(2,5), 9:(2,6), 10:(3,6), 11:(4,6), 12:(4,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (4,4), the new positions: head to (4,4), then segment 1 moves to where head was (4,3), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was (4,2), and so on, down to segment 12 moves to where segment 11 was, which is (4,6), but segment 11 was at (4,6), segment 12 was at (4,5), so segment 12 moves to (4,6)? Let's index properly.\n\nLet S[t] be positions at time t.\n\nAt turn 69: S[69] = [ (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5) ]\n\nAfter move to (4,4) at turn 70:\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nThen the body: each subsequent segment takes the place of the previous one.\n\nSo:\n\n- Position 0: (4,4) new head\n\n- Position 1: where position 0 was, (4,3)\n\n- Position 2: where position 1 was, (4,2)\n\n- Position 3: where position 2 was, (3,2)\n\n- Position 4: where position 3 was, (3,3)\n\n- Position 5: where position 4 was, (2,3)\n\n- Position 6: where position 5 was, (1,3)\n\n- Position 7: where position 6 was, (1,4)\n\n- Position 8: where position 7 was, (1,5)\n\n- Position 9: where position 8 was, (2,5)\n\n- Position 10: where position 9 was, (2,6)\n\n- Position 11: where position 10 was, (3,6)\n\n- Position 12: where position 11 was, (4,6)\n\nPosition 11 was (4,6), so position 12 moves to (4,6), but position 11 is also moving to (3,6)? No.\n\nWhen the head moves to a new cell, the segment that was at index i moves to the cell that was occupied by index i-1 at the previous time.\n\nStandard snake movement: the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo for index k, at time t+1, it occupies the position that index k-1 occupied at time t, for k=1 to len-1.\n\nAnd the new head position is the move.\n\nSo at turn 70 after U move:\n\n- Head (index 0) at (4,4)\n\n- Index 1 at position of old index 0: (4,3)\n\n- Index 2 at position of old index 1: (4,2)\n\n- Index 3 at position of old index 2: (3,2)\n\n- Index 4 at position of old index 3: (3,3)\n\n- Index 5 at position of old index 4: (2,3)\n\n- Index 6 at position of old index 5: (1,3)\n\n- Index 7 at position of old index 6: (1,4)\n\n- Index 8 at position of old index 7: (1,5)\n\n- Index 9 at position of old index 8: (2,5)\n\n- Index 10 at position of old index 9: (2,6)\n\n- Index 11 at position of old index 10: (3,6)\n\n- Index 12 at position of old index 11: (4,6)\n\nOld index 11 was (4,6), so index 12 moves to (4,6). The tail was old index 12 at (4,5), which is now vacated since no one moves to it; the snake shortens only if it doesn't eat, but when it moves without eating, the tail position is left, so the snake doesn't grow.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten, so snake length same, tail cell (4,5) is vacated.\n\nSo after move to (4,4), positions: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nTail is (4,6).\n\nNow, food at (3,4) is still there.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move to (3,4) directly? (3,4) is left of (4,4).\n\nIs (3,4) occupied? In new positions, (3,4) is not listed, so empty? But food is there, but food is on the cell, not occupied by snake unless eaten.\n\n(3,4) has food, but the cell is free for movement, but if head moves there, it eats the food.\n\nBut is it safe to move to (3,4)?\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nCurrent direction after move is Up (since I moved U to (4,4), so direction is U.\n\nNo instant reverse, so cannot move D to (4,3), because that would be down, opposite to up.\n\nSo possible: U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,5): (4,5) is not occupied now; previously tail was there, but now vacated. In current positions, (4,5) is not occupied, and no wall, so ok.\n\nL to (3,4): (3,4) has food, and it's empty otherwise.\n\nR to (5,4): (5,4) check walls: internal obstacles (6,4) is wall, but (5,4) not listed, so should be ok. Borders fine.\n\n(5,4) is within bounds.\n\nIf I move L to (3,4) from (4,4), I eat the food at (3,4), so snake grows.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nFirst, at turn 70, from (4,4), if I move to (3,4):\n\nNew head (3,4), and since I eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at head, or rather, the tail stays.\n\nWhen head moves to food, the tail doesn't advance, so snake length increases by one.\n\nPositions: head to (3,4), then body: index 1 to (4,4), index 2 to (4,3), index 3 to (4,2), index 4 to (3,2), index 5 to (3,3), index 6 to (2,3), index 7 to (1,3), index 8 to (1,4), index 9 to (1,5), index 10 to (2,5), index 11 to (2,6), index 12 to (3,6), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the end, so index 13 at old tail position? No.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, the head moves to food cell, and the body follows, but the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail, and length increases.\n\nSo positions at turn 71 after eating (3,4):\n\n- Head: (3,4)\n\n- Index 1: (4,4)  // previous head\n\n- Index 2: (4,3)  // previous index 1\n\n- Index 3: (4,2)  // previous index 2\n\n- Index 4: (3,2)  // previous index 3\n\n- Index 5: (3,3)  // previous index 4\n\n- Index 6: (2,3)  // previous index 5\n\n- Index 7: (1,3)  // previous index 6\n\n- Index 8: (1,4)  // previous index 7\n\n- Index 9: (1,5)  // previous index 8\n\n- Index 10: (2,5)  // previous index 9\n\n- Index 11: (2,6)  // previous index 10\n\n- Index 12: (3,6)  // previous index 11\n\n- Index 13: (4,6)  // previous index 12, now tail, not moved\n\nSo snake now has 14 segments.\n\nBut is there any danger?\n\nNow, the food at (3,4) is eaten, so gone.\n\nBut I need to think about the tail reward danger, but here not applicable.\n\nFrom here, I can continue.\n\nBut let's see the other option at turn 69.\n\nI could move right to (5,3) instead.\n\nAt turn 69, move R to (5,3)\n\nThen new head (5,3), direction R (since moved right).\n\nPositions: head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)  // tail was (4,5), vacated, so positions: (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)  // index 12 at (4,6)\n\nNo food eaten.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: since direction R, cannot move L (left) to (4,3), which is body, but also reverse not allowed.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3)\n\n(6,3): x=6, y=3, walls: x=7 is wall, but x=6 is border? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable, since x from 1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly y from 1 to 6.\n\n(6,3) is not wall, but internal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, (6,1) is wall, but (6,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) free, (5,2) free.\n\nBut (5,2) is y=2, x=5.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,2) not, so ok.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nI need to consider the food life spans.\n\n(3,4) has life span 3 at turn 69, so must be eaten by turn 71 (since present on 69,70,71; gone on 72).\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 5, eaten by turn 73.\n\n(6,5) life span 8, eaten by turn 76.\n\nNow, (3,4) is close, so it might be good to eat it soon.\n\nIf I go to (4,4) at turn 70, then to (3,4) at turn 71, I eat it on turn 71, which is within life span.\n\nIf I go to (5,3) at turn 70, then from there to (3,4) is not direct; I need to go left and up, but it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), I can go to (5,4), then to (4,4), then to (3,4), but that would be turn 72 if I start from turn 70.\n\nTurn 69: if I move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 70: from (5,3), say move U to (5,4)\n\nThen positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), etc., tail moves.\n\nThen turn 71: from (5,4), move L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 72: from (4,4), move L to (3,4)\n\nBut (3,4) is gone on turn 72? Life span: at turn 69, life span 3, so exists on 69,70,71; gone on 72. So on turn 72, it's not there, so I can't eat it on turn 72.\n\nIf I go to (3,4) on turn 72, it's gone.\n\nSo if I choose to go right at turn 69, I cannot eat (3,4) because it disappears before I can reach it if I take that path.\n\nFrom (5,3), I could go directly left to (4,3), but (4,3) is body? At turn 70, after moving to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,2), etc. so (4,3) is occupied by index 1, not free. So cannot move left to (4,3) because collision and also reverse? Direction is R, so moving left is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (5,3), I can only go U, D, or R, not L.\n\nSo to reach (3,4), I need at least two moves: e.g., U to (5,4) then L to (4,4), then from (4,4) to (3,4) on next turn, but that would be turn 72 for (3,4), too late.\n\nFrom (5,3), I could go D to (5,2), then L to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied? At turn 70, after move to (5,3), position (4,2) is occupied by index 2 or something.\n\nAt turn 70 positions: head (5,3), index1 (4,3), index2 (4,2), index3 (3,2), etc.\n\nSo (4,2) occupied, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) might be free, then from there, I can go to (4,2) but (4,2) occupied, or to (5,1) but (5,1) is obstacle, or to (6,2), etc.\n\nNot helpful for reaching (3,4).\n\nSo indeed, if I move right at turn 69, I cannot eat (3,4) in time; it will disappear before I can reach it.\n\nTherefore, to eat (3,4), I must move up to (4,4) at turn 69, then to (3,4) at turn 70.\n\nAt turn 69, move U to (4,4), then at turn 70, move L to (3,4) to eat it.\n\nBut at turn 70, when I move to (3,4), I need to ensure it's safe.\n\nNow, when I eat at (3,4), what is the state.\n\nFirst, at turn 69, move U to (4,4).\n\nAs before, positions at turn 70: head (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nFood at (3,4) is still there.\n\nNow, from (4,4), move L to (3,4).\n\nAs I thought earlier, I eat the food, so snake grows to 14 segments.\n\nPositions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)  // since tail didn't move.\n\nNow, after eating, head at (3,4), direction left (since moved left).\n\nNow, possible next moves.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nThere might be risks.\n\nFor example, look at the tail: tail is at (4,6), and head is at (3,4), not adjacent.\n\nBut let's see the surrounding.\n\nAlso, there is a food at (1,1) and (6,5).\n\n(1,1) is at bottom-left, and snake body is around (1,3),(1,4),(1,5), so (1,1) might be accessible.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) at top-right.\n\nBut first, after eating (3,4), head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: since direction L, cannot move R (right) to (4,4), which is body, and reverse not allowed.\n\nPossible: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4)\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n(3,5): is it free? Current positions: (3,4) head, (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\n(3,5) not in list, so free? But is there wall? Internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\nWalls: (2,4) is internal obstacle, so (3,5) is not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3): occupied by index 5 or something, positions: index 5 is (3,3), which is body, so moving D to (3,3) would be collision.\n\n(3,3) is occupied by the snake.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4): (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\nSo from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) or L to (2,4) but (2,4) wall, so only U to (3,5)? L to (2,4) is invalid because wall.\n\n(2,4) is wall, so cannot move left to it.\n\nDirections: from (3,4), left is (2,4), which is wall.\n\nUp is (3,5), down is (3,3) occupied, right is (4,4) occupied and reverse.\n\nSo only possible move is Up to (3,5).\n\nIs that right?\n\n(3,5): y=5, x=3.\n\nNot occupied, not wall.\n\nYes, so only possible move is U to (3,5).\n\nThen I must go up.\n\nThen at turn 71, move U to (3,5).\n\nNow, no food there, so snake moves, tail advances.\n\nPositions: head to (3,5), then body: index1 to (3,4), index2 to (4,4), index3 to (4,3), etc., and tail index13 moves to where index12 was, which is (4,6), but index12 was (4,6), and since no food, tail moves, so the last position is vacated.\n\nAfter move to (3,5):\n\n- Head (3,5)\n\n- Index1: (3,4)  // previous head\n\n- Index2: (4,4)  // previous index1\n\n- Index3: (4,3)  // previous index2\n\n- Index4: (4,2)  // previous index3\n\n- Index5: (3,2)  // previous index4\n\n- Index6: (3,3)  // previous index5\n\n- Index7: (2,3)  // previous index6\n\n- Index8: (1,3)  // previous index7\n\n- Index9: (1,4)  // previous index8\n\n- Index10: (1,5)  // previous index9\n\n- Index11: (2,5)  // previous index10\n\n- Index12: (2,6)  // previous index11\n\n- Index13: (3,6)  // previous index12\n\nPrevious index12 was (3,6), so index13 moves to (3,6). The old tail (4,6) is vacated.\n\nNow head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D to (3,4), which is down, opposite.\n\n(3,4) is occupied by index1, so cannot move there anyway.\n\nSo possible: U, L, R.\n\nU to (3,6): (3,6) is occupied by index13, which is tail? Index13 is at (3,6), which is the current tail.\n\nSince it's tail, I can move there because tail will move.\n\nBut let's see.\n\n(3,6) is tail, so moving to it should be ok, as tail moves away.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) is occupied by index11? Positions: index11 is (2,5), which is body, not tail. Tail is (3,6).\n\nSo (2,5) is body, cannot move there.\n\nR to (4,5): (4,5) is not occupied? Current positions: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\n(4,5) not listed, so free.\n\nAlso, walls: no.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (3,6) which is tail, or R to (4,5) free.\n\nL to (2,5) not possible, occupied.\n\nSo I can go U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), which is tail, and since I move there, and tail moves, it should be ok, no collision.\n\nThen the snake grows? No, no food, so just move.\n\nIf I go R to (4,5), also free.\n\nBut I need to think about future food.\n\nNow, food left: (1,1) and (6,5)\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), which is near the body.\n\nCurrent positions: snake is from (3,5) down to (1,3), etc., so (1,1) might be reachable.\n\n(6,5) at (6,5).\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable now.\n\nNow, back to turn 69 choice.\n\nIf I move right to (5,3) at turn 69, I miss (3,4), but I can go for other food.\n\nBut (3,4) is +1, so better to eat it if possible.\n\nIn the path above, by going U then L, I eat (3,4) at turn 70 (since turn 69 move to (4,4), turn 70 move to (3,4) to eat).\n\nTurn 69: action for turn 69.\n\nAt turn 69, I move to (4,4), which is turn 69 action U.\n\nThen at turn 70, I move to (3,4) to eat.\n\nThen as above, at turn 71, I must move U to (3,5), since only choice.\n\nThen at turn 72, from (3,5), I can choose to move U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), which is tail, ok.\n\nPositions after: head to (3,6), but (3,6) was tail, so when I move there, since no food, tail moves away.\n\nAfter move to (3,6): head (3,6), body (3,5), (3,4), etc., and tail was (3,6), but moves to previous position.\n\nPrevious positions at turn 71: head (3,5), index1 (3,4), index2 (4,4), ..., index13 (3,6)\n\nAfter move U to (3,6):\n\n- Head (3,6)\n\n- Index1: (3,5)  // previous head\n\n- Index2: (3,4)  // previous index1\n\n- Index3: (4,4)  // previous index2\n\n- ... and so on, up to index13: where previous index12 was, which was (2,6)\n\nPrevious index12 was (2,6), so index13 moves to (2,6).\n\nOld tail (3,6) is now head, so no issue.\n\nThen head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nNow possible moves: U to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so cannot.\n\nD to (3,5) occupied, L to (2,6), R to (4,6)\n\n(2,6) is occupied by index13 now? Positions: after move, index13 is at (2,6), so (2,6) is body.\n\n(4,6) is free? Not occupied, and not wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4) etc., (4,6) not obstacle.\n\nSo possible: L to (2,6) but occupied, not possible; R to (4,6) free; U and D not possible or occupied.\n\nU to (3,7) wall, D to (3,5) occupied, L to (2,6) occupied, R to (4,6) free.\n\nSo only R to (4,6).\n\nThen I must go right to (4,6).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems a bit constrained, but I can survive.\n\nNow, if at turn 72 from (3,5) I move R to (4,5) instead.\n\n(4,5) is free.\n\nMove R to (4,5).\n\nThen positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), etc., tail moves to (2,6) or something.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's not diverge.\n\nBack to the initial choice.\n\nAt turn 69, moving right to (5,3) might avoid this, but I miss the food.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating (3,4) gives +1 and length increase, which might be good for survival or future options.\n\nBut let's see the other food.\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), life span 5, so by turn 73.\n\nTo reach (1,1) from current position.\n\nCurrent head (4,3).\n\nIf I go via (4,4) and (3,4), then after eating, I'm at (3,4), then to (3,5), etc., which is away from (1,1).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go down or left, but let's see.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go to (3,6) or (4,5), both are not towards (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is at bottom-left, so I need to go left and down.\n\nBut there are obstacles and body.\n\nFor example, from head at (3,5), if I could go left to (2,5), but (2,5) is occupied by index11 at that time, as before.\n\nIn the positions after eating (3,4) and moving to (3,5), (2,5) is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, down to (3,4) occupied, etc.\n\nSo it might be hard to reach (1,1) from there soon.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,4) and move right to (5,3) at turn 69.\n\nThen at turn 70, head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3)\n\n(5,2): free, (6,3): free, (5,4): free.\n\nNow, (6,5) is food at (6,5), which is near.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go to (5,4), then to (6,4), but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\n(6,4) is wall, so from (5,4), I can go to (6,4)? No, wall.\n\nSo to reach (6,5), I need to go from (5,3) to (5,4) or (6,3), then to (5,5) or (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is food.\n\nFrom (5,3), if I move U to (5,4) at turn 70.\n\nThen positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nThen at turn 71, from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), then at turn 72, move R to (6,5) to eat, since (6,5) is adjacent.\n\n(5,5) to (6,5) is right.\n\n(6,5) has life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nThen I eat (6,5) on turn 72.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) can be eaten later.\n\nBut in this case, I miss (3,4), but get (6,5) instead.\n\n(3,4) is +1, (6,5) is +1, same value, but (3,4) expires soon, so if I don't eat it, I lose it, whereas (6,5) has longer life.\n\nBut since I can eat (6,5) later, it might be fine.\n\nHowever, by eating (3,4), I increase length, which might help with survival or blocking, but in this game, longer snake might be harder to maneuver.\n\nBut in this case, the grid has obstacles, so space is limited.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but not relevant now.\n\nI need to prioritize long-term survival.\n\nLet's consider the area.\n\nThe snake body occupies a lot of the left and bottom, with head near center.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(1,2) is obstacle, so to reach (1,1), from current, I need to go to (1, something).\n\nFor example, from (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) are occupied, but if the snake moves, those might free up.\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), and (1,2) is obstacle, so to reach (1,1), I can only come from above, like (1,2) but obstacle, or from right, (2,1), but (2,1) might be free.\n\n(2,1) : is it wall? Borders ok, internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,1) not listed, so should be free.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can go to (1,1) if possible, but (1,1) is adjacent, but (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) has only one access? From (1,1), adjacent cells: U (1,2) but obstacle, D not, y=1, down y=0 wall, L x=0 wall, R (2,1).\n\nSo only accessible from (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) can be accessed from above or right.\n\nBut (2,1) might be free now.\n\nAt turn 69, positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) occupied, so (1,1) and (2,1) free.\n\nTo eat (1,1), I need to go to (2,1) then to (1,1).\n\nBut when I move to (1,1), I eat, and snake grows.\n\nBut life span 5, so by turn 73.\n\nSimilarly for (6,5).\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nAt turn 69, if I move U to (4,4), I can eat (3,4) at turn 70, then I'm at (3,4) with longer snake, but then I must go to (3,5) at turn 71, and so on, which might lead me to the top-right, where (6,5) is.\n\nIf I move R to (5,3), I can go to (6,5) directly.\n\nBut let's see which action at turn 69 is better.\n\nFirst, moving U to (4,4) at turn 69.\n\nThen turn 70: move L to (3,4) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 71: move U to (3,5) (only choice)\n\nThen at turn 72, from (3,5), I have choices: U to (3,6) or R to (4,5)\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then as before, at turn 73, I must go R to (4,6)\n\nThen from (4,6), I can go U to (4,7) but wall, D to (4,5), L to (3,6) occupied, R to (5,6)\n\n(5,6) might be free.\n\nThen to (6,6), then to (6,5) to eat.\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), so from (6,6) I can go down to (6,5).\n\nBut (6,6) to (6,5) is down.\n\nLife span ok.\n\nIf at turn 72 from (3,5) I go R to (4,5), then at turn 72: head to (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), etc.\n\nThen from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\nCurrent direction: after moving R to (4,5), direction R.\n\nCannot move L to (3,5) because reverse and occupied.\n\nU to (4,6): (4,6) is occupied? In positions at that time, let's see.\n\nAt turn 71, positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nAfter move R to (4,5) at turn 72:\n\n- Head (4,5)\n\n- Index1: (3,5)  // previous head\n\n- Index2: (3,4)  // previous index1\n\n- Index3: (4,4)  // previous index2\n\n- Index4: (4,3)  // previous index3\n\n- Index5: (4,2)  // previous index4\n\n- Index6: (3,2)  // previous index5\n\n- Index7: (3,3)  // previous index6\n\n- Index8: (2,3)  // previous index7\n\n- Index9: (1,3)  // previous index8\n\n- Index10: (1,4)  // previous index9\n\n- Index11: (1,5)  // previous index10\n\n- Index12: (2,5)  // previous index11\n\n- Index13: (2,6)  // previous index12\n\nPrevious index12 was (2,6), so index13 moves to (2,6). (3,6) was previous index13, vacated.\n\nNow (4,6) is free.\n\nFrom (4,5), U to (4,6) is free.\n\nD to (4,4) occupied.\n\nL to (3,5) occupied and reverse.\n\nR to (5,5) free.\n\nSo possible U or R.\n\nIf U to (4,6), then similar to before.\n\nIf R to (5,5), then towards (6,5).\n\n(5,5) to (6,5) is right, but (6,5) is food.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (6,5) at turn 73 or something.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nFor the other choice, at turn 69 move R to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 70: from (5,3), move U to (5,4) (for example)\n\nThen turn 71: from (5,4), move U to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 72: from (5,5), move R to (6,5) to eat.\n\n(6,5) eaten on turn 72.\n\nAlso possible.\n\nNow, for (1,1), I can go later, but it might be risky because of the obstacles.\n\n(1,1) has only one access point (2,1), and if the snake is in the way, it might be hard.\n\nBut with planning, I can go there.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating both is good.\n\nBut (3,4) is only available if I eat it now.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I lose one point.\n\nIn the move right option, I eat (6,5) later, which is also one point.\n\nBut by eating (3,4), I have a longer snake, which might be useful or not.\n\nBut in this case, with the obstacles, shorter snake might be more maneuverable.\n\nBut let's see the grid space.\n\nPlayable cells: 6x6 = 36 cells.\n\nSnake length 13, so 13 occupied, plus 3 food, but food can be eaten, plus walls: 5 internal obstacles, but walls are separate.\n\nTotal cells: 36.\n\nOccupied by snake: 13.\n\nWalls: borders are not cells, internal obstacles: 5 cells that are walls.\n\nSo free cells: 36 - 13 - 5 = 18 free cells, including the 3 food.\n\nBut after eating, snake grows, free cells decrease.\n\nFor survival, I need space.\n\nBut with internal obstacles, some areas might be blocked.\n\nFor example, the bottom-left: (1,1), (1,2) obstacle, (1,3) occupied, etc.\n\nIt might be tight.\n\nBut I think I can manage.\n\nNow, to decide: I think eating the soon-to-expire food is better, so I should go for (3,4).\n\nMoreover, in the move right option, at turn 69 move R to (5,3), then from there, if I want to go to (5,4), (5,4) is free, but then to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut from (5,3), I could go D to (5,2), but (5,2) is free, then to where? Not towards food.\n\nOr R to (6,3), then to (6,2) or (6,4) but (6,4) wall, so (6,2) or (6,3) to (5,3) occupied, etc.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo better to go for (3,4).\n\nTherefore, at turn 69, move U to (4,4).\n\nThen at turn 70, move L to (3,4) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 71, move U to (3,5) (only choice)\n\nNow for turn 72, from (3,5), I need to choose between U to (3,6) or R to (4,5)\n\n(3,6) is tail, so moving there is ok, and it might free up space.\n\nIf I go R to (4,5), it might be better for reaching (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), so from (4,5), I can go to (5,5) then (6,5).\n\nFrom (3,6), I go to (4,6) then (5,6) then (6,6) then to (6,5), which takes more steps.\n\nSo better to go to (4,5) at turn 72.\n\nThen from there to (5,5) then to (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, for (1,1), I can go after, but it might expire if I delay.\n\nLife span to turn 73, so I have time.\n\nBut let's specify the actions.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 69: U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 70: L to (3,4) eat food\n\nTurn 71: U to (3,5)\n\nNow turn 72: from (3,5), move R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 73: from (4,5), move R to (5,5)  // since direction R, cannot L, U to (4,6) or D to (4,4) occupied, so R to (5,5) or U to (4,6)\n\n(5,5) is towards (6,5), so better.\n\nMove R to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 74: from (5,5), move R to (6,5) to eat, if (6,5) still there.\n\nLife span 8, turn 69 to 76, so at turn 74, it should be there.\n\nEat at turn 74.\n\nNow, for (1,1), after that, but it expires at turn 73? Life span 5 at turn 69, so exists turns 69,70,71,72,73; gone at turn 74.\n\nSo to eat (1,1), I need to do it by turn 73.\n\nBut in this sequence, at turn 73, I am at (5,5) or something, far from (1,1).\n\nAt turn 73, in above, from (4,5) at turn 72, move to (5,5) at turn 73.\n\n(5,5) to (1,1) is far, cannot reach in one turn.\n\nAnd at turn 73, (1,1) is still present, but I cannot reach it from (5,5) in time.\n\nIf I want to eat (1,1), I need to go there earlier.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,4), at turn 71 at (3,5), instead of going right, I go down or left, but earlier I could only go up.\n\nAt turn 71, after eating, I was at (3,4), then moved to (3,5), only choice.\n\nThen at turn 72, from (3,5), I could go down? But down to (3,4) occupied, not possible.\n\nOnly up or right.\n\nSo I cannot go towards (1,1) directly; I am stuck going up or right.\n\nTherefore, in this path, I cannot eat (1,1) because it expires before I can reach it.\n\nIf at turn 69 I move right to (5,3), then I can go to (6,5) and also have a chance to go to (1,1).\n\nFor example, at turn 69 move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 70 move U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 71 move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 72 move R to (6,5) eat\n\nThen at turn 73, head at (6,5), but (1,1) expires after turn 73, so on turn 73, it is present, but I am at (6,5), too far to reach (1,1) in one turn.\n\nFrom (6,5), to reach (1,1), need many moves, and obstacles.\n\nFor example, go left to (5,5), etc., but (1,1) gone at turn 74.\n\nSo cannot eat (1,1) in this case either.\n\nIn both paths, I cannot eat (1,1) because of the distance and time.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, I can go towards (1,1).\n\nBut at turn 69, head at (4,3), to go to (1,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut left to (3,3) is invalid, down to (4,2) invalid, so only up or right, both not towards (1,1).\n\nSo I cannot directly go to (1,1) from current position in the first move.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat (1,1) before it expires, since it must be eaten by turn 73, and from turn 69, with the snake configuration, I cannot reach it in 4 turns.\n\nMinimum path: from (4,3) to (1,1), need to go left to (3,3) but blocked, or down to (4,2) blocked, so I have to go around, e.g., to (4,4) then left, but (3,4) then to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so not direct.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (1,1): one path could be to (4,4) then (3,4) then (3,3) but (3,3) occupied, or to (2,3) occupied.\n\nIt's messy.\n\nShortest path might be via (5,3) then (5,2) then (4,2) but (4,2) occupied, or (5,1) obstacle.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (1,1): the free cells near (1,1) are (2,1) and (1,1), but (1,1) only from (2,1).\n\n(2,1) can be from (2,2) or (3,1) or (1,1) but (1,1) not accessible directly.\n\n(2,2) : is it free? At turn 69, (2,2) not occupied, not wall? Internal obstacles (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1), (3,2) occupied, etc.\n\nTo reach (2,1), from (4,3), I can go to (5,3) then (5,2) then (4,2) occupied, or (5,2) to (6,2) then not helpful.\n\nOr from (4,3) to (4,4) to (3,4) to (3,3) occupied, not possible.\n\nI think it's not feasible to reach (1,1) quickly with the snake body blocking.\n\nTherefore, I should accept that (1,1) cannot be eaten and focus on the other foods.\n\nSo back to the plan.\n\nAt turn 69, move U to (4,4) to set up for eating (3,4).\n\nThen sequence:\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: L to (3,4) eat\n\nTurn 71: U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 72: R to (4,5)  // to go towards (6,5)\n\nThen from (4,5), at turn 73, move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 74: R to (6,5) eat\n\nNow, I need to output for 5 turns or more.\n\nThe format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer should specify actions starting from turn t1 for a sequence.\n\nProbably I need to output for several turns.\n\nSince after turn 74, I can continue, but for the answer, I think 5 actions from turn 69.\n\nTurn 69 to turn 73, for example.\n\nBut let's list.\n\nAlso, at turn 72, if I go U to (3,6), it might be similar.\n\nBut going R to (4,5) is better for (6,5).\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nAt turn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: L\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: R (to (4,5))\n\nThen turn 73: from (4,5), move R to (5,5)\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to specify.\n\nSince the state changes, I should only specify the immediate action and think ahead.\n\nBut for the answer, I think I need to provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps: Turn 69: U, Turn 70: L, Turn 71: U, Turn 72: R, Turn 73: R\n\nThen at turn 74, move R to (6,5) to eat.\n\nBut I think for 5 turns, up to turn 73.\n\nTurn 69 to 73 is 5 actions: 69,70,71,72,73.\n\nYes.\n\nIn turn 73, moving to (5,5), which is fine.\n\nIf at turn 69 I move right, I can eat (6,5) earlier.\n\nTurn 69: R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 70: U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 71: U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 72: R to (6,5) eat\n\nThen turn 73: from (6,5), I can move, but (1,1) is gone.\n\nBut in this case, I eat (6,5) at turn 72, whereas in the other, I eat (3,4) at turn 70 and (6,5) at turn 74, so I get the points at different times, but both +1.\n\nBut by eating (3,4), I have an extra segment, which might allow me to survive longer or something, but not necessarily better.\n\nIn terms of score, both give one point, but in the first case I eat two foods if possible, but (1,1) not possible, so same score.\n\nBut with longer snake, it might be harder to avoid collision, but in this grid, with obstacles, shorter might be better.\n\nBut let's see the area after eating.\n\nIn the first path, after eating (3,4), snake length 14, then I go to (6,5), length 15.\n\nIn the second path, snake length 13, eat (6,5) at turn 72, length 14.\n\nThen I can look for other food, but no other food, only (1,1) expired.\n\nSo score is 1 in both cases, but in first case I ate one, in second I ate one, but (3,4) was eaten, which would expire, so if I don't eat it, I lose it, whereas (6,5) I can eat later anyway.\n\nBy eating (3,4), I get an extra point that I would otherwise miss.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,4), it disappears, and I only get (6,5), so score +1.\n\nIf I eat (3,4), I get +1, and still get (6,5) later, so score +2.\n\nIs that right?\n\n(3,4) and (6,5) are two separate foods, both +1.\n\nIn the first sequence, I eat both: (3,4) at turn 70 and (6,5) at turn 74.\n\nIn the second sequence, I eat only (6,5) at turn 72, and (3,4) expires uneaten.\n\nSo I get only one point.\n\nTherefore, better to eat (3,4) to get the extra point.\n\nIn the first sequence, I eat two foods, score +2.\n\nIn the second, only one, score +1.\n\nSo definitely better to go for (3,4).\n\nMoreover, I can eat (6,5) later.\n\nSo I think the first choice is better.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: L\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nNow for turn 72, I need to choose to go to (4,5) or (3,6). Going to (4,5) is better for reaching (6,5).\n\nTurn 72: R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 73: from (4,5), as before, move R to (5,5) or U to (4,6). But R to (5,5) is towards (6,5).\n\nSince I need to output up to turn 73 or more.\n\nFor 5 turns: turn 69 to 73.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: L\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: R\n\nTurn 73: R (to (5,5))\n\nThen after that, turn 74: R to (6,5) eat.\n\nBut for the answer, I think 5 actions are fine.\n\nIn turn 73, moving to (5,5), which is safe.\n\nTo be precise, let's confirm the directions.\n\nAt turn 69: move U\n\nAfter that, head at (4,4), direction U\n\nTurn 70: move L to (3,4), so direction now L\n\nTurn 71: move U to (3,5), direction U? From (3,4) to (3,5) is up, but previous direction was L, so moving up is not reverse, allowed.\n\nThen at turn 72: from (3,5), move R to (4,5), direction R\n\nTurn 73: from (4,5), move R to (5,5), direction R\n\nAll good.\n\nIf at turn 72 I go U to (3,6), then turn 73 must go R to (4,6), which is also fine, but slower to (6,5).\n\nSo R to (4,5) is better.\n\nTherefore, the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves that eats the high-priority positive food at (3,4) before it expires (life span 3, must be eaten by turn 71). This food is worth +1 and increases the snake's length. After eating it, the snake can safely navigate toward the other positive food at (6,5), which has a longer life span (8 turns, can be eaten later). The food at (1,1) cannot be reached before it expires (life span 5, gone by turn 74) due to distance and obstacles, so it is ignored.\n\nKey risks avoided:\n- Moving left to (3,3) at turn 69 would cause body collision.\n- Moving down at any point is invalid due to the \"no instant reverse\" rule after moving up.\n- The path avoids walls and internal obstacles.\n- After eating (3,4), the only safe move is up to (3,5) to avoid collisions.\n\nThe planned sequence for turns 69 to 73 ensures the snake eats (3,4) on turn 70 and positions it to reach (6,5) by turn 74. Thinking 5+ turns ahead confirms this path maximizes score (eating two foods for +2) and maintains safe maneuverability.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\\boxed{\nTurn 69: U  \nTurn 70: L  \nTurn 71: U  \nTurn 72: R  \nTurn 73: R  \n}",

        "step": 70,
        "score": 13,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 70. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,4), then body segments: (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So the snake is 13 segments long.\n\nHead direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to get to (4,4) from (4,3), I assume.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,4) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after turn 71 or 72? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 70, life span 2 means it has 2 turns left, including turn 70. So after turn 71, it should be gone, meaning it can be eaten on turn 70 or 71.)\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten on turns where the turn number <= t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nIf at turn t, life span is L, it means it will disappear after L more turns. So it exists from turn t to turn t + L - 1? For example, turn t: life span L, countdown starts. After one turn, turn t+1, life span becomes L-1, and so on, until life span 0 at turn t+L-1, and then disappears before turn t+L. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+L-1.\n\nIn this case, for food at (3,4): turn 70, life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 70 or 71. After that, gone.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) value 1, life span 4, so can be eaten from turn 70 to 73.\n\n(6,5) value 1, life span 7, can be eaten from 70 to 76.\n\n(3,2) value 1, life span 10, can be eaten from 70 to 79.\n\nAll food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned, so all are good.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (4,4), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is Up, so cannot move Down next turn. So possible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is invalid because it's opposite.\n\nCurrent direction is Up, meaning it moved Up to get to (4,4), so from (4,3) to (4,4) Up. So next move cannot be Down, because that would be instant reverse.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, L, R.\n\nNow, let's see the grid state.\n\nI should sketch a grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (4,4)\n\nBody: (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nTail is (4,6), I think.\n\nList all occupied cells by snake:\n\n- (4,4) head\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (4,6) tail\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (3,4) - this is adjacent to head? Head at (4,4), so (3,4) is left of head.\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (3,2) - but (3,2) is occupied by snake body! (3,2) is the fourth segment of the snake. Food at (3,2) with value 1, life span 10.\n\nBut food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nCurrently, (3,2) has food under it, but since snake body is there, it can't be eaten until the snake moves off that cell.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (3,4) is empty? Let's see if any snake or wall.\n\n(3,4): not in snake positions, and not a wall? Walls are borders and internal obstacles. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is a wall? (2,4) is listed as internal obstacle, so yes, wall at (2,4).\n\nList walls:\n\n- All x=0, y=0, x=7, y=7 cells.\n\n- Plus: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo (3,4) is not a wall, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: from above, (3,4) is not listed. Snake has (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), etc. (3,3) is there, but (3,4) is free? (3,4) is not in the list, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1): not snake, not wall? Walls: (1,2) is wall, but (1,1) is not listed, so free? (1,1) is corner, but borders are walls, so (1,1) has x=1 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7? Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (1,1) is not border wall, and not internal obstacle except (1,2) is wall, but (1,1) is separate. Internal obstacles are specific points: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,1) is wall, (6,1) wall, (1,2) wall. (1,1) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5): not snake, not wall? Walls: (6,4) is wall, (6,1) wall, but (6,5) is different.\n\n(3,2) is occupied by snake body.\n\nNow, head at (4,4), possible moves:\n\nUp: (4,5)\n\nDown: (4,3) but (4,3) is body, and also cannot move down because opposite direction? Direction constraint: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current head direction is U, so cannot move D. So Down is invalid.\n\nLeft: (3,4)\n\nRight: (5,4)\n\nNow, (4,5): is it free? Not in snake positions, and not wall? Walls: borders y=7, but y=5<7, x=4 not border. Internal obstacles: none at (4,5), so should be free.\n\n(3,4): not snake, not wall, and food is there with value 1.\n\n(5,4): not snake, not wall? Walls: (6,4) is wall, but (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\nBut (5,4) might be close to wall or something, but no wall there.\n\nNow, also, need to consider future moves and risks.\n\nThe food at (3,4) has life span 2, meaning it can be eaten on turn 70 or 71. If not eaten by turn 71, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, others have longer life.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there's a danger with tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because the tail grows and collides.\n\nFirst, where is tail? Tail is (4,6), and head is at (4,4). Are they adjacent? (4,4) and (4,6) are two apart vertically, not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x, y±1 or same y, x±1.\n\nSo (4,4) to (4,6) is |dy|=2, not adjacent. Similarly, other segments.\n\nHead adjacent cells: (4,5) up, (4,3) down (but body), (3,4) left, (5,4) right.\n\nTail at (4,6), adjacent cells: (4,5), (4,7), but y=7 is wall, (3,6), (5,6).\n\n(4,5) is adjacent to tail.\n\nBut head is not currently adjacent to tail.\n\nIf head moves to (4,5), then it would be adjacent to tail at (4,6), since (4,5) and (4,6) are adjacent.\n\nThen, if at that point, the tail cell (4,6) has food, but currently, is there food at (4,6)? Food positions: (3,4), (1,1), (6,5), (3,2). No food at (4,6), so no issue for now.\n\nBut after moving, if tail has food when head is adjacent.\n\nNow, back to possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Move Up to (4,5)\n\n- Then head at (4,5), tail at (4,6) if no food eaten, but since no food at (4,5), snake doesn't grow, tail moves to (3,6)? Let's see snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position, so tail moves away from current position.\n\nCurrent snake: positions in order: index 0: (4,4) head, 1: (4,3), 2: (4,2), 3: (3,2), 4: (3,3), 5: (2,3), 6: (1,3), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,5), 9: (2,5), 10: (2,6), 11: (3,6), 12: (4,6) tail.\n\nIf move Up to (4,5), no food there, so new head at (4,5), then body: segment 1 moves to old head (4,4), segment 2 to (4,3), and so on, segment 12 (tail) moves to old position of segment 11, which is (3,6). So tail is now at (3,6).\n\nAnd (4,6) is free now.\n\nHead at (4,5), direction Up.\n\nThen possible next moves.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nOption 2: Move Left to (3,4)\n\n(3,4) has food, value 1, so if move there, snake eats food, grows, so new head at (3,4), and tail does not move, so snake length increases to 14.\n\nBody segments: head was at (4,4), now to (3,4), so new position: head (3,4), then the previous body segments: (4,4) becomes new segment 1, (4,3) segment 2, ..., up to tail (4,6) still there, but since growth, tail doesn't move, so positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) — now 14 segments.\n\nDirection: moved left, so head direction now L.\n\nOption 3: Move Right to (5,4)\n\nNo food, so move to (5,4), no grow, tail moves to (3,6)? New positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail now (3,6), since (4,6) was tail, but moved to (3,6), and (4,6) free.\n\nDirection now R.\n\nNow, I need to think about risks and long-term.\n\nFirst, the food at (3,4) has short life, only until turn 71. If not eaten now or next turn, it disappears.\n\nTurn 70: if not eaten, on turn 71, life span decreases to 1, can be eaten on turn 71.\n\nIf not eaten by turn 71, gone.\n\nSince (3,4) is adjacent and has food, it might be tempting to eat it.\n\nBut need to consider if it's safe.\n\nMoving to (3,4): what are the risks?\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nPossible next moves: since direction L, cannot move R (opposite), so can move U, D, L.\n\nCells: Up (3,5), Left (2,4), Down (3,3).\n\nNow, (2,4): is it wall? Internal obstacles include (2,4), so (2,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n\n(3,3): is it occupied? After eating, snake has (3,4) head, (4,4) body, (4,3) body, etc. (3,3) is a body segment, position: let's see, from above, after move to (3,4), positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), ... (3,3) is the 6th segment or something, but yes, (3,3) is occupied by body.\n\nIn the list: after growth, segments: 0: (3,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), etc.\n\nSo (3,3) is segment 5, occupied.\n\nSo Down to (3,3) is body, collision.\n\nUp to (3,5): is it free? Not wall, not snake currently, should be free.\n\nLeft to (2,4) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo after moving to (3,4), only possible move is Up to (3,5), since Down and Left are invalid or deadly.\n\nThen, at (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen next moves possible.\n\nBut let's see the area.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,2) under snake body, which might become available later.\n\nNow, if not eat (3,4), move to (4,5) or (5,4).\n\nMove to (4,5): no food, head at (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (4,6), but (4,6) is current tail, but after move, if no food, tail moves to (3,6), so (4,6) is free? After move to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail at (3,6), so (4,6) is free now.\n\nSo U to (4,6) is free, can move there.\n\nD to (4,4) but (4,4) is now body segment, collision.\n\nL to (3,5), should be free.\n\nR to (5,5), should be free.\n\n(5,5) not wall or snake.\n\nSimilarly, move to (5,4): head at (5,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4) but (4,4) body, collision, R to (6,4) but (6,4) is wall, internal obstacle, so invalid.\n\nSo after move to (5,4), can move U, D, or L but L to (4,4) is body, so only U or D.\n\nD to (5,3) should be free.\n\nNow, I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFood at (3,4) is only available for two turns, so if not eaten, it disappears, which is a missed opportunity, but not critical since other food.\n\nBut it might be easy to get.\n\nHowever, after eating it, the snake might be in a tight spot.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nFirst, if I move to (3,4) and eat food.\n\nTurn 70: move L to (3,4), eat food, grow to 14 segments, head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nThen only possible move is U to (3,5), no food there, so move to (3,5), direction U.\n\nNow head at (3,5), positions: after move, head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail at (3,6), since no grow.\n\n(3,6) was tail, and it moved? After moving to (3,5), the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment. Previous positions before move: head at (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), etc, tail (4,6)? Let's keep track.\n\nAfter turn 70: positions with growth: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nTurn 71: move U to (3,5), no food, so new head (3,5), then body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail at (3,6), and (4,6) is free.\n\nHead at (3,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6), but (3,6) is now tail? (3,6) is occupied by tail, so if move there, head to tail, but since tail will move, it might be ok only if not adjacent with food on tail, but here no food on tail cell.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell that is the current tail, and no food, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nBut (3,6) is currently occupied, but after move, if head goes to (3,6), and since no food, tail moves to (2,6) or something, so it should be safe.\n\nLet's see: current positions before move: head (3,5), body (3,4), (4,4), etc, tail (3,6)\n\nMove U to (3,6): (3,6) is tail, so head moves to (3,6), and since no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, so the new tail is the previous second last, which is (2,6)? Positions: before move, segments: 0: (3,5), 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (3,3), 7: (2,3), 8: (1,3), 9: (1,4), 10: (1,5), 11: (2,5), 12: (2,6), 13: (3,6) tail? In my earlier, after turn 70, positions: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) — I think I have 14 segments.\n\nList indices:\n\nAfter turn 70 eat at (3,4):\n\n- 0: (3,4)\n\n- 1: (4,4)\n\n- 2: (4,3)\n\n- 3: (4,2)\n\n- 4: (3,2)\n\n- 5: (3,3)\n\n- 6: (2,3)\n\n- 7: (1,3)\n\n- 8: (1,4)\n\n- 9: (1,5)\n\n- 10: (2,5)\n\n- 11: (2,6)\n\n- 12: (3,6)\n\n- 13: (4,6) tail\n\nTurn 71: move U to (3,5), but (3,5) is not food, so no grow. New head at (3,5), then body: segment 1 moves to old head (3,4), so new pos: head (3,5), 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (3,3), 7: (2,3), 8: (1,3), 9: (1,4), 10: (1,5), 11: (2,5), 12: (2,6), 13: (3,6) — tail at (3,6), and (4,6) is free.\n\n(4,6) is no longer occupied.\n\nNow head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (3,6): (3,6) is current tail, occupied. But if move there, since no food, head moves to (3,6), tail moves to previous position of segment 12, which is (2,6), so new positions: head (3,6), 1: (3,5), 2: (3,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3), 8: (2,3), 9: (1,3), 10: (1,4), 11: (1,5), 12: (2,5), 13: (2,6) tail. So safe, no collision.\n\nD to (3,4): but (3,4) is body segment 1, occupied, collision.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) is body segment 11? In current positions, (2,5) is segment 11, occupied, so collision.\n\nR to (4,5): should be free, not occupied.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,5): U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\nU to (3,6) as above.\n\nR to (4,5): no food, head to (4,5), then new positions: head (4,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (3,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3), 8: (2,3), 9: (1,3), 10: (1,4), 11: (1,5), 12: (2,5), 13: (2,6) tail at (2,6), since (3,6) was tail but moved to (2,6).\n\nDirection from (3,5) to (4,5) is Right, so head direction R.\n\nThen from there, can move U, D, L, R, but L to (3,5) is body, so not.\n\nBut let's not go too deep.\n\nBack to turn 70.\n\nIf I move to (4,5) instead.\n\nTurn 70: move U to (4,5), no food, so positions: head (4,5), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail at (3,6), (4,6) free.\n\nHead at (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (4,6), which is free now, can move.\n\nD to (4,4) body, collision.\n\nL to (3,5), free.\n\nR to (5,5), free.\n\n(3,5) and (5,5) both free.\n\nNow, food at (3,4) is still there, and can be eaten on turn 71 if head moves to it.\n\nBut from (4,5), to reach (3,4), it would be down or left, but (3,4) is at (3,4), which is left and down from (4,5)? (4,5) to (3,4) is left and down, not adjacent directly. Adjacent cells: (4,5) to (4,6) U, (4,4) D, (3,5) L, (5,5) R.\n\n(3,4) is not adjacent to (4,5); it's diagonally, but not directly reachable in one move.\n\nTo reach (3,4) from (4,5), I need to go to (3,5) or (4,4), but (4,4) is body, occupied, so only to (3,5), then from (3,5) to (3,4) or (4,4), etc.\n\nIf I move to (3,5) from (4,5), then at (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) if it's free.\n\nBut on turn 71, (3,4) might still be there if not eaten.\n\nLife span: at turn 70, food (3,4) life 2, so on turn 71, it has life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nIf I don't eat it on turn 70, on turn 71 I can still eat it if I move to (3,4).\n\nBut from (4,5), if I move L to (3,5) on turn 71, then at (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) on turn 72, but on turn 72, the food might be gone.\n\nTurn 71: if not eaten on 70, on turn 71, life span decreases to 1, so can be eaten on turn 71.\n\nAfter turn 71, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nSo to eat on turn 71, I need to be able to move to (3,4) on turn 71.\n\nFrom turn 70 position after move to (4,5): head at (4,5).\n\nOn turn 71, I can move to (3,5), for example.\n\nThen at (3,5), head position, from there I can move to (3,4) on turn 72, but turn 72 is too late, food gone after turn 71.\n\nTurn 71 is the last chance.\n\nOn turn 71, from head at (4,5), I can move directly to (3,4)? (3,4) is not adjacent to (4,5); (4,5) adjacent are (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5). (3,4) is down-left, not adjacent.\n\nSo I cannot move directly from (4,5) to (3,4) in one move.\n\nThe only way to reach (3,4) on turn 71 is if the head is at a cell adjacent to (3,4) on turn 71.\n\nAdjacent cells to (3,4): (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4).\n\n(2,4) is wall, invalid.\n\n(3,3) is body, occupied, cannot move there.\n\n(4,4) is body, occupied.\n\n(3,5) might be free.\n\nSo only from (3,5) I can move to (3,4) if it's free.\n\nBut on turn 71, if head is at (3,5), I can move D to (3,4).\n\nBut to have head at (3,5) on turn 71, on turn 70 after move, head at (4,5), then on turn 71 move L to (3,5), then on turn 72 move D to (3,4), but turn 72 is too late for the food.\n\nTurn 71 is the move where I can eat.\n\nOn turn 71, if I am at (3,5), I can move to (3,4) and eat.\n\nBut to be at (3,5) on turn 71, I need to have moved there on turn 71 from turn 70 position.\n\nTurn 70: after move, head at (4,5)\n\nTurn 71: I move to (3,5) (Left)\n\nThen at (3,5), I can on the same turn? No, each turn is separate.\n\nOn turn 71, I start from (4,5), and I choose to move to (3,5). Then after that move, I am at (3,5) for turn 71.\n\nThen to eat (3,4), I need to move to it on turn 72, but turn 72 the food is already gone if not eaten by turn 71.\n\nAfter turn 71, the food disappears, so I can only eat it on turn 70 or 71.\n\nOn turn 71, when I am at the starting position for turn 71, if I move directly to (3,4), I can eat it.\n\nBut from the position at the start of turn 71, where is head?\n\nIf on turn 70 I moved to (4,5), then at start of turn 71, head is at (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move to (3,5), (4,6), (5,5), or (4,4) but (4,4) body, invalid.\n\nNone of these is (3,4), so I cannot move directly to (3,4) on turn 71 from (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved to (5,4) on turn 70, head at (5,4), even farther.\n\nOr if I didn't move to (3,4) on 70, I can only eat it on turn 71 if I am at (3,5), (3,3), etc, but only (3,5) is possible, and from there I can move to (3,4) on turn 71? On turn 71, if I start at (3,5), I can move to (3,4).\n\nBut to start turn 71 at (3,5), I need to have moved there on turn 70.\n\nOn turn 70, from (4,4), I can move to (3,4) directly and eat, or move to (4,5) or (5,4).\n\nIf I move to (4,5) on turn 70, then on turn 71 I am at (4,5), and I can move to (3,5) on turn 71, but then I am at (3,5) at the end of turn 71, not at the start. For eating on turn 71, I need to move to the food cell during turn 71.\n\nDuring turn 71, from head position at start of turn 71, which is (4,5) if I moved U on 70, I choose to move to an adjacent cell.\n\n(3,4) is not adjacent to (4,5), so I cannot move to it.\n\nThe only way to eat (3,4) on turn 71 is if on turn 71 the head is at a cell adjacent to (3,4), which are (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4).\n\n(2,4) wall, (3,3) body, (4,4) body, so only (3,5) is possible.\n\nSo if at start of turn 71, head is at (3,5), then I can move D to (3,4) and eat.\n\nBut to have head at (3,5) at start of turn 71, I must have moved to (3,5) on turn 70 from (4,4).\n\nOn turn 70, from (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) or U to (4,5) or R to (5,4), but not directly to (3,5); (3,5) is not adjacent to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) adjacent are (4,5) U, (4,3) D, (3,4) L, (5,4) R.\n\n(3,5) is up-left, not adjacent.\n\nSo I cannot move to (3,5) from (4,4) in one move.\n\nTherefore, the only way to eat the food at (3,4) is to move directly to it on turn 70 or on turn 71 from an adjacent cell, but the only adjacent cell I can be on turn 71 is if I move to it on turn 70, but from turn 70 position, I can only move to (3,4), (4,5), (5,4), none of which is (3,5) or other adjacent to (3,4) except (3,4) itself.\n\nSo for turn 71, to eat, I need to be at (3,5) or other, but I can't be at (3,5) on turn 71 start because I can't reach it from (4,4) in one move on turn 70.\n\nUnless I was already there, but on turn 70 start, head is at (4,4), not at (3,5).\n\nSo the only possible way to eat (3,4) is on turn 70 by moving Left to it.\n\nIf I don't do that, it will disappear unused.\n\nNow, moving to (3,4) might lead to a dead end, as I saw earlier, because after that, I can only go to (3,5), and then from there, I have options, but the snake is long and the space might be tight.\n\nLet's see the grid.\n\nGrid has obstacles at (2,4), (1,2), etc.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (3,6) or (4,5).\n\n(3,6) is currently tail, but after moving, it might be free or not.\n\nIn the earlier simulation, after moving to (3,5) on turn 71 if I ate on 70, then from (3,5) I can go U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\n(3,6): if I go there, it might be ok.\n\n(4,5) is free.\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut there is food at (6,5) and (1,1), etc.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,2) is under the body, so when the snake moves, it might be uncovered.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat (3,4), and move elsewhere, the body at (3,2) might move, and food can be eaten later.\n\nBut life span is 10, so plenty of time.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nMoving to (3,4) and eating might not be bad, but let's see the other option.\n\nMove to (4,5) on turn 70.\n\nThen head at (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen on turn 71, I can move to (4,6), (3,5), or (5,5).\n\n(4,6) is free, as we saw.\n\n(3,5) free, (5,5) free.\n\nFood at (3,4) disappears after turn 71, so I can't eat it.\n\nBut other food.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I move to (3,5) on turn 71, then at (3,5), I can move to (3,6), (3,4) but (3,4) is now free if not eaten, but no food, or to (2,5) but (2,5) is body? After turn 70 move to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (1,3), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (2,6), 12: (3,6) tail.\n\n(2,5) is segment 10, occupied.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go there on turn 71, head at (3,5), then moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\n(3,4) is free now, but no food.\n\n(2,5) is body, collision.\n\n(4,5) is previous position, but body, collision.\n\nOnly U to (3,6) or D to (3,4) or R to (4,5) but (4,5) is body? After moving to (3,5), positions change.\n\nTurn 71: start from (4,5), move to (3,5), no food, so new head (3,5), then body: 1: (4,5) old head, 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (3,3), 7: (2,3), 8: (1,3), 9: (1,4), 10: (1,5), 11: (2,5), 12: (2,6) tail at (2,6), since (3,6) was tail but moved to (2,6).\n\nSo head at (3,5), direction L (since moved left from (4,5)? From (4,5) to (3,5) is Left, so direction L.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\n(3,6) is free, can move.\n\n(3,4) is free, can move.\n\n(2,5) is body segment 11, occupied, collision.\n\n(4,5) is body segment 1, occupied, collision.\n\nSo can move U to (3,6) or D to (3,4).\n\nBoth free.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut the food at (3,4) is gone, so no issue.\n\nNow, back to turn 70, another option is move Right to (5,4).\n\nTurn 70: move R to (5,4), no food, positions: head (5,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (1,3), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (2,6), 12: (3,6) tail at (3,6), (4,6) free.\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4) but (4,4) body, collision, R to (6,4) but (6,4) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nD to (5,3) free, U to (5,5) free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other areas.\n\nBut there is food at (6,5), which is near.\n\n(6,5) has life span 7, so time.\n\nAlso, (1,1) but far.\n\nNow, the food at (3,2) is under the body at position 4 or 5, but when the snake moves, it might be uncovered.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the body moves off (3,2), then the food can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut currently occupied.\n\nLife span 10, so time.\n\nFor long-term, moving to (3,4) might be ok, but let's see if it leads to danger.\n\nAfter eating at (3,4), I go to (3,5), then from there, I can go to (3,6) or (4,5).\n\nIf I go to (3,6), then head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (3,5) body, collision.\n\nL to (2,6), which might be free or not.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6), positions: from earlier, after turn 71 move to (3,6) from (3,5), but let's not confuse.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid (3,4) to not get stuck.\n\nBut from (3,5), I can go to (4,5) instead of (3,6).\n\nMove to (4,5) from (3,5).\n\nThen at (4,5), I can go to (4,6), (5,5), etc.\n\n(4,6) is free, (5,5) free.\n\nThen I can go towards (6,5) food.\n\n(6,5) is at x=6,y=5, but (6,4) is wall, so to reach (6,5), I need to go from (5,5) or (6,6), but y=7 wall.\n\n(6,5) adjacent cells: (6,6), (6,4), (5,5), (7,5) but x=7 wall.\n\n(6,4) is wall, (7,5) wall, so only (6,6) and (5,5) are possible approaches.\n\n(6,6) might be free.\n\nSimilarly, from current position, if I move to (5,4) on turn 70, I can go to (5,5) then to (6,5).\n\nBut let's decide for turn 70.\n\nSince the food at (3,4) is only available now, and it's +1, I should eat it if safe, but after eating, the only move is to (3,5), which is ok, then from there I have choices.\n\nBut after moving to (3,5), the cell (3,4) is body, and (4,4) is body, so from (3,5), moving D to (3,4) is body, collision, so I can only go U or R, as before.\n\nU to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then at (3,6), I can only go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6), since U to (3,7) wall, D to (3,5) body.\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) might be free.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6), for example.\n\nTurn 70: move L to (3,4) eat, grow.\n\nTurn 71: move U to (3,5) no eat.\n\nTurn 72: move U to (3,6) no eat.\n\nPositions after turn 72: head (3,6), 1: (3,5), 2: (3,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3), 8: (2,3), 9: (1,3), 10: (1,4), 11: (1,5), 12: (2,5), 13: (2,6) tail? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 70: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nTurn 71: move U to (3,5) no eat, so new: head (3,5), 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (3,3), 7: (2,3), 8: (1,3), 9: (1,4), 10: (1,5), 11: (2,5), 12: (2,6), 13: (3,6) tail\n\nTurn 72: move U to (3,6), but (3,6) is current tail, no food, so head moves to (3,6), tail moves to (2,6), so new positions: head (3,6), 1: (3,5), 2: (3,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3), 8: (2,3), 9: (1,3), 10: (1,4), 11: (1,5), 12: (2,5), 13: (2,6) tail\n\nHead at (3,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5) body, collision.\n\nL to (2,6) but (2,6) is tail, occupied. If move there, since no food, head to (2,6), tail moves to (2,5), so safe.\n\nR to (4,6) free, can move.\n\nSo can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nIf go R to (4,6), then at (4,6), can go to (4,7) wall, (4,5), (3,6) body, (5,6) etc.\n\n(5,6) might be free.\n\nSo it's not dead end, I can escape.\n\nSimilarly, if from (3,5) I go R to (4,5), then to (4,6) or (5,5), etc.\n\nSo moving to (3,4) is safe and I get the food.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I lose the opportunity.\n\nOther food has longer life, but this is easy to get.\n\nMoreover, the snake is long, and space is limited with obstacles, so eating food might make it harder to maneuver, but since it's only +1, and I need to maximize score, but survival first.\n\nBut here, it seems safe.\n\nNow, the food at (3,2) is under the body at position 5 or something, but when the snake moves, it will be uncovered eventually.\n\nFor example, if I move, the body at (3,2) will move to the next position, so the cell (3,2) will be free, and food is there, so I can eat it later by moving head to it.\n\nBut life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nFor turn 70, I think it's best to eat the food at (3,4) since it's available now and will disappear soon.\n\nSo move Left to (3,4).\n\nThen for future turns, I can plan.\n\nThe answer should be for multiple turns, but the instruction is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the current and future turns? The answer format is for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so I need to provide a sequence of actions starting from turn 70.\n\nBut I don't know the future food or state, so I need to simulate or choose a path.\n\nPerhaps I need to provide a plan for the next few turns based on current state.\n\nSince the state might change with food disappearing, I should provide actions only for as long as I can predict.\n\nBut the food life span is given, so I can predict when they disappear.\n\nAlso, no new food mentioned, so only these food items.\n\nThe state has only current food, so I assume no new food spawns, only these.\n\nSo I can plan a sequence.\n\nBut the snake movement affects the body, so I need to simulate.\n\nLet's try to plan 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, turn 70: move L to (3,4) and eat food.\n\nHead at (3,4), direction L.\n\nThen turn 71: only possible move is U to (3,5), no food there.\n\nHead at (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 72: from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\nNow, which one? Let's see the food.\n\nFood at (6,5) and (1,1), (3,2) under body.\n\n(3,2) is currently occupied, but after moves, it will be uncovered.\n\nFor example, after turn 70 and 71, the body has moved.\n\nAfter turn 70: positions include (3,2) as segment 4 or 5, but after growth, it's segment 4: (3,2) with food under, but since snake is there, not eaten.\n\nAfter turn 71 move to (3,5), no grow, so body moves: segment at (3,2) moves to where? From earlier: after turn 71, positions: head (3,5), 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2)? In turn 71 positions: 5: (3,2)? Let's list:\n\nAfter turn 70: 0:(3,4),1:(4,4),2:(4,3),3:(4,2),4:(3,2),5:(3,3),6:(2,3),7:(1,3),8:(1,4),9:(1,5),10:(2,5),11:(2,6),12:(3,6),13:(4,6)\n\nTurn 71: move U to (3,5) no eat, so new: head (3,5), 1:(3,4), 2:(4,4), 3:(4,3), 4:(4,2), 5:(3,2)? No, the body segments move to previous position: segment 1 moves to old head (3,4), segment 2 to old segment 1 (4,4), segment 3 to old 2 (4,3), segment 4 to old 3 (4,2), segment 5 to old 4 (3,2), but (3,2) has food, but snake is moving, so when segment 5 moves to (3,2), it is still occupied, so food not eaten.\n\nThen segment 6 to old 5 (3,3), segment 7 to old 6 (2,3), segment 8 to old 7 (1,3), segment 9 to old 8 (1,4), segment 10 to old 9 (1,5), segment 11 to old 10 (2,5), segment 12 to old 11 (2,6), segment 13 to old 12 (3,6) tail.\n\nOld segment 13 (4,6) is removed.\n\nSo positions: head (3,5), 1:(3,4), 2:(4,4), 3:(4,3), 4:(4,2), 5:(3,2) with food, 6:(3,3), 7:(2,3), 8:(1,3), 9:(1,4), 10:(1,5), 11:(2,5), 12:(2,6), 13:(3,6) tail.\n\nCell (3,2) has food and snake body, so not eatable yet.\n\nOn turn 72, from head at (3,5), I can move to (3,6) or (4,5).\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), then head to (3,6), which is tail, no food, so tail moves to (2,6), new positions: head (3,6), 1:(3,5), 2:(3,4), 3:(4,4), 4:(4,3), 5:(4,2), 6:(3,2), 7:(3,3), 8:(2,3), 9:(1,3), 10:(1,4), 11:(1,5), 12:(2,5), 13:(2,6) tail.\n\n(3,2) is now segment 6, still occupied.\n\nIf I move R to (4,5) on turn 72, head to (4,5), no food, new positions: head (4,5), 1:(3,5), 2:(3,4), 3:(4,4), 4:(4,3), 5:(4,2), 6:(3,2), etc.\n\n(3,2) still occupied.\n\nThe food at (3,2) will be uncovered when the body moves off it.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves, the segment on (3,2) will move to another cell.\n\nWhen segment 6 moves to the next position, (3,2) becomes free, and food can be eaten.\n\nBut it might take a few turns.\n\nTo eat (3,2), I need to have head move to it when it's free.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nFor now, on turn 72, from (3,5), I can go towards (6,5) or other.\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), I can go via (4,5) or (5,5).\n\nSince (4,5) is free, moving R to (4,5) on turn 72 might be better to go east.\n\nThen from there, to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut let's define the sequence.\n\nSince the instruction is to output for turn 70, then 71, etc., I need to provide a few turns.\n\nBut for survival, moving to (3,4) is fine.\n\nPerhaps for turn 70, move L to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 71, move U to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 72, move R to (4,5) to go towards (6,5).\n\nAt (4,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 73, from (4,5), can move U to (4,6), R to (5,5), or D to (4,4) body, not, so U or R.\n\nSay move R to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 74, from (5,5), can move to (5,6), (6,5), (5,4), etc.\n\n(6,5) has food, so if I go to (6,5), I can eat.\n\nBut (6,5) is adjacent to wall at (6,4), but (6,5) itself is not wall.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move R to (6,5) if possible.\n\n(6,5) is at x=6,y=5, from (5,5), moving right to (6,5).\n\nIs (6,5) wall? No, internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), etc, (6,5) not listed, so free.\n\nSo I can move to (6,5) and eat on turn 74 or earlier.\n\nBut let's not plan all.\n\nFor the answer, I can provide the first few actions.\n\nSince the question is to think ahead but output the actions starting from turn 70.\n\nI think for turn 70, I'll move Left to eat the food.\n\nSo action: L\n\nThen for turn 71, move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 72, move R to (4,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut to be complete, let's see the tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently no issue.\n\nAnother thing: if I don't eat (3,4), and move to (4,5), then I can go to (4,6) or (5,5), but I miss the food.\n\nSince all food is +1, and I can get others, but this one is free and short-lived, so better to eat.\n\nMoreover, the grid has obstacles, and the snake is coiled, so by eating, I grow, but I can still move.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo I'll go with moving Left on turn 70.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and simulated potential moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food at (3,4)**: This has a life span of 2 (disappears after turn 71), so it must be eaten on turn 70 or 71 to avoid losing the +1 reward. It is directly accessible from the current head position (4,4) by moving left.\n- **Immediate risks**: Moving left to (3,4) is safe. After eating, the only valid move is up to (3,5) on turn 71, which avoids collisions. Subsequent moves can then navigate toward other food (e.g., (6,5)) or open areas.\n- **Alternative moves**: \n  - Moving up to (4,5) or right to (5,4) avoids short-term risk but misses the (3,4) food, which disappears soon. It also delays accessing other food and may lead to less efficient paths.\n  - Moving down is invalid (opposite to current up direction).\n- **Long-term survival**: After eating (3,4), the snake can safely move to (3,5) and then to (4,5) or (3,6). From there, paths toward (6,5) (life span 7) or (1,1) (life span 4) are viable. The food at (3,2) (under the body) has a long life span (10) and can be eaten later when the body moves off it.\n- **Collision risks**: All moves are checked for body/wall collisions. The tail at (4,6) has no food, so no tail reward danger. After moving, the snake avoids dead ends (e.g., moving to (3,6) allows escape via left or right).\n\n**Action Sequence (5 turns ahead for robustness):**\n- **Turn 70**: Move left (L) to (3,4) to eat the +1 food (life span 2, must act now). New head position: (3,4), snake grows to length 14.\n- **Turn 71**: Move up (U) to (3,5). This is the only safe move from (3,4) (down to (3,3) is body collision, left to (2,4) is wall). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 72**: Move right (R) to (4,5). From (3,5), moving right avoids potential future traps near the top wall and heads toward the food at (6,5). No food at (4,5).\n- **Turn 73**: Move right (R) to (5,5). This continues the path toward (6,5). From (4,5), moving right is valid and safe. No food at (5,5).\n- **Turn 74**: Move right (R) to (6,5) to eat the +1 food. From (5,5), moving right reaches (6,5) directly. This food has life span 7, so eating on turn 74 is timely and extends the snake.\n\n**Reasoning for 5+ Turns:**\n- **Turns 70-71**: Secures the time-sensitive food at (3,4) and positions the snake for flexibility.\n- **Turns 72-74**: Navigates toward (6,5) efficiently. After turn 74, the snake can target (1,1) or (3,2) (when uncovered). Paths avoid walls and body segments.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: No moves cause immediate collision. Long paths (e.g., to (1,1)) are feasible with life spans considered. If needed, the snake can loop back using open cells (e.g., via (5,6) or (4,6)).\n- **Food Prioritization**: (3,4) is prioritized due to short life. (6,5) is next closest. (1,1) and (3,2) have longer life spans, allowing deferral.\n\nThis sequence scores +2 in 5 turns with low risk. Beyond turn 74, continue toward remaining food while avoiding obstacles.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 70: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 71: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 72: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 73: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 74: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 71, and I'm the snake. My goal is to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, and I have to think at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid with walls on the borders. Additionally, there are internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked and I can't move into them.\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (3,4), and the body segments follow: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So the snake has 14 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (3,4)\n\n- Then: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nThe head direction is left (L), meaning the snake was moving left to reach (3,4) from the previous position. Since the previous position was (4,4), which is to the right of (3,4), yes, moving left.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including this one. Since current turn is 71, it will disappear after turn 73? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 71, life span is 3, meaning it will be there for turn 71, 72, 73, and disappear before turn 74. Similarly for others.\n\n- (6,5) with value 1 and life span 6. So available until turn 76 (since 71 + 5 = 76? Let's calculate: at turn 71, life span 6, so it decreases to 5 on turn 72, 4 on 73, ..., down to 0 on turn 76, so disappears before turn 77. Turn 71: life=6, turn 72: life=5, ..., turn 76: life=1, then after turn 76, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 76.\n\n- (3,2) with value 1 and life span 9. Available for longer.\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food? The value is given as 1, and it says \"value1\" etc., and from the description, positive food has +1, negative has -1. Here all are 1, so all positive. But let me confirm: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: (1,1,3,1)\" – the format is (x,y, life_span, value)? No, let's read: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so for first food: (1,1) with value 1 and life span 3.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) value 1, life span 6; (3,2) value 1, life span 9. So all are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nAlso, note that (3,2) is a food position, but looking at snake positions, (3,2) is part of the snake body! Snake has segments: ... (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), ... so (3,2) is the 5th segment or something. Specifically, positions: index 0: head (3,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), etc.\n\nSo (3,2) is occupied by the snake body. But food can spawn under the snake body, which is the case here. Food at (3,2) with life span 9.\n\nTo eat it, the body must move away, and then head must move onto it. Since the snake is moving, eventually the tail will move away, but we need to coordinate so that when the cell is free, head moves there.\n\nNow, the head is at (3,4), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is left, I can move left, up, or down, but not right, because no instant reverse. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) next, but I can move U, D, or L? No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is left, so opposite is right, so I cannot move right. I can move up, down, or continue left.\n\nFrom (3,4), adjacent cells:\n\n- Left: (2,4) – but is this free? Let's see what's at (2,4).\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (2,4) is within bounds, x=2, y=4, not border wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Oh, (2,4) is an internal obstacle! So (2,4) is a wall cell, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is obstacle, etc.\n\nSo from (3,4):\n\n- Left: (2,4) – but (2,4) is an internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\n- Up: (3,5) – y=5, x=3. Is this within bounds? x=3, y=5, between 0 and 7, so yes. No internal obstacle at (3,5)? Internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (3,5) not listed, so free, but might be occupied by snake or food.\n\nSnake positions: (3,4) head, then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So (3,5) is not in this list, so not occupied by snake body.\n\nFood at (1,1), (6,5), (3,2) – (3,2) is occupied, but (3,5) no food mentioned, so (3,5) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, down: (3,3) – but (3,3) is a snake body segment. Specifically, it's the 5th segment? Positions: index 0: (3,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), etc. So (3,3) is occupied by the snake body.\n\nIf I move down to (3,3), that would be colliding with body, which is deadly. So I cannot move there.\n\nRight: (4,4) – but (4,4) is the first body segment. Moving right to (4,4) would also collide with body.\n\nMoreover, current direction is left, so moving right is instant reverse? Current direction is L, moving R is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed anyway.\n\nBut even if allowed, it's occupied.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,4):\n\n- Left: (2,4) – wall, invalid\n\n- Up: (3,5) – empty, possible\n\n- Down: (3,3) – occupied by body, invalid\n\n- Right: (4,4) – occupied by body and instant reverse, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is Up to (3,5).\n\nIs that right? Let me confirm.\n\nHead at (3,4), body at (4,4), (4,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) is a body segment, yes.\n\n(3,5) is not listed in snake positions, not a wall, not food, so empty.\n\nSo only move is Up.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead. Also, there might be risks later.\n\nMoreover, food at (3,2) is under the snake body, so I need to free that cell.\n\nAlso, tail is at (4,6), I think? Snake positions: last one is (4,6), so tail is (4,6).\n\nNow, when the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells can free up.\n\nBut for now, at turn 71, only move is Up to (3,5).\n\nThen what about next turns?\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns in the answer format. It says: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\" but it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably I should output at least 5 actions, since it says think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nBut the actions are for the current and future turns, but since the state changes, I need to simulate based on moves.\n\nThe answer should be the sequence of actions I plan to take starting from current turn.\n\nBut I have to commit to actions now, but since I think ahead, I can plan a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I output actions for t1, t1+1, t1+2, etc., for a few turns, but I need to think ahead to make decisions.\n\nSince only one move possible now, I must go Up.\n\nThen from there, I can plan.\n\nAlso, food at (1,1) has life span 3, meaning it will disappear after turn 73, so only available on turn 71,72,73.\n\nTurn 71: current, life span 3, so can be eaten on turn 71,72,73.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) life span 6, available turn 71 to 76.\n\n(3,2) life span 9, available longer.\n\nBut (3,2) is currently under snake body, so I need to move the snake so that tail moves away.\n\nFirst, let's list the snake positions in order:\n\nIndex: 0: head (3,4)\n\n1: (4,4)\n\n2: (4,3)\n\n3: (4,2)\n\n4: (3,2)  <-- food here, but occupied\n\n5: (3,3)\n\n6: (2,3)\n\n7: (1,3)\n\n8: (1,4)\n\n9: (1,5)\n\n10: (2,5)\n\n11: (2,6)\n\n12: (3,6)\n\n13: (4,6) tail\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is freed, but only if no food or something, but the tail moves, so the cell it leaves becomes empty, unless it was food, but food is separate.\n\nThe snake body segments shift.\n\nFor example, if I move up to (3,5), then new head is (3,5), and the body segments: the old head becomes body, so positions: new head (3,5), then previous body: (3,4) now segment 1, (4,4) segment 2, (4,3) segment 3, (4,2) segment 4, (3,2) segment 5, (3,3) segment 6, etc., and tail (4,6) will be removed? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nStandard snake: when you move, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nBut if you eat food, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nHere, since I'm moving to (3,5), which is empty, no food, so no eating, so tail moves.\n\nCurrent tail is (4,6), so after move, tail is removed, so (4,6) is free.\n\nNew positions: head to (3,5), then segment 1: (3,4) (previous head), segment 2: (4,4) (previous seg1), segment 3: (4,3) (previous seg2), segment 4: (4,2) (previous seg3), segment 5: (3,2) (previous seg4), segment 6: (3,3) (previous seg5), segment 7: (2,3) (previous seg6), segment 8: (1,3) (previous seg7), segment 9: (1,4) (previous seg8), segment 10: (1,5) (previous seg9), segment 11: (2,5) (previous seg10), segment 12: (2,6) (previous seg11), and segment 13: (3,6) (previous seg12). Previous seg12 was (2,6), which moves to seg11 position? Let's index properly.\n\nBefore move:\n\nPositions: let's list with indices for clarity:\n\n- 0: (3,4) head\n\n- 1: (4,4)\n\n- 2: (4,3)\n\n- 3: (4,2)\n\n- 4: (3,2)\n\n- 5: (3,3)\n\n- 6: (2,3)\n\n- 7: (1,3)\n\n- 8: (1,4)\n\n- 9: (1,5)\n\n- 10: (2,5)\n\n- 11: (2,6)\n\n- 12: (3,6)\n\n- 13: (4,6) tail\n\nAfter move to (3,5) without eating:\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nThen new body:\n\n- 1: old head (3,4)\n\n- 2: old seg1 (4,4)\n\n- 3: old seg2 (4,3)\n\n- 4: old seg3 (4,2)\n\n- 5: old seg4 (3,2)  <-- food here\n\n- 6: old seg5 (3,3)\n\n- 7: old seg6 (2,3)\n\n- 8: old seg7 (1,3)\n\n- 9: old seg8 (1,4)\n\n- 10: old seg9 (1,5)\n\n- 11: old seg10 (2,5)\n\n- 12: old seg11 (2,6)\n\n- 13: old seg12 (3,6)  // now tail, since old tail (4,6) is removed\n\nOld seg13 (4,6) is not part of new snake; it's removed.\n\nSo new tail is (3,6)\n\nAnd (4,6) is now free.\n\nBut (3,2) is still occupied by segment 5.\n\nFood at (3,2) is still under snake body.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move so that the snake body leaves (3,2), then head moves there.\n\nCurrently, (3,2) is segment 5, so it will move when the snake moves.\n\nAfter this move to (3,5), segment at (3,2) is now index 5, but position is still (3,2) for now? After move, positions:\n\n- Head: (3,5)\n\n- Seg1: (3,4)\n\n- Seg2: (4,4)\n\n- Seg3: (4,3)\n\n- Seg4: (4,2)\n\n- Seg5: (3,2)  // still here\n\n- Seg6: (3,3)\n\n- Seg7: (2,3)\n\n- Seg8: (1,3)\n\n- Seg9: (1,4)\n\n- Seg10: (1,5)\n\n- Seg11: (2,5)\n\n- Seg12: (2,6)\n\n- Seg13: (3,6) tail\n\nYes, (3,2) still occupied.\n\nNow, if I move again, say on turn 72, I need to choose a direction.\n\nHead at (3,5), direction: since I moved up from (3,4), new head direction is U.\n\nPossible moves: from (3,5), can go U (up) to (3,6), D (down) to (3,4), L (left) to (2,5), R (right) to (4,5).\n\nBut (3,6) is the tail? In new positions, (3,6) is tail, but when I move, the tail will move, so moving to (3,6) might be possible if it's the tail, because after move, tail moves away.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except that it can move to the tail cell since tail moves.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if head moves to tail, it's ok, and since no food, tail moves, so no growth.\n\nBut in this case, (3,6) is tail, so moving to (3,6) is safe.\n\n(3,4) is seg1, body segment, so moving down to (3,4) would collide with body.\n\n(2,5) is seg11? Positions: seg11 is (2,5), which is body, not tail.\n\n(4,5) is empty? Let's see.\n\nFirst, walls: (4,5) x=4,y=5, not border, not internal obstacle (internal: (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2)), so free.\n\nSnake positions: no (4,5), so empty.\n\nFood: not at (4,5), so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is tail, so can move there.\n\n(2,5) is occupied by seg11, body, so cannot move there.\n\n(3,4) occupied by seg1, body.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,5):\n\n- U to (3,6): tail, safe\n\n- D to (3,4): body, collision, invalid\n\n- L to (2,5): body, invalid? (2,5) is seg11, which is body, not tail, so if head moves there, it collides with body segment.\n\nOnly tail is safe to move to.\n\n- R to (4,5): empty, safe\n\nSo possible: U to (3,6) or R to (4,5)\n\nNow, direction: head direction is U, so moving D would be instant reverse? Current direction U, moving D is down, opposite, so instant reverse not allowed. So cannot move down anyway.\n\nMoving left or right is perpendicular, not reverse.\n\nSo U and R are possible.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and survival.\n\nFood at (1,1) is close but has short life. (1,1) with life span 3, at turn 71, so must be eaten by turn 73.\n\nCurrent turn 71, I just moved to (3,5), so at turn 71 action is U to (3,5).\n\nNow for turn 72, I need to choose.\n\nBut let's think multiple turns.\n\nAlso, food at (3,2) is under body, but life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nFood at (6,5) is at (6,5), which is on the right side.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, and internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions after turn 71 move: head (3,5), body as above.\n\nNow, to eat (1,1), I need to get to (1,1) by turn 73.\n\n(1,1) is at bottom-left, but there is an obstacle at (1,2), which is a wall.\n\n(1,2) is an internal obstacle, so I cannot go to (1,2).\n\nTo reach (1,1), adjacent cells are: (1,0), (1,2), (0,1), (2,1)\n\nBut (1,2) is wall, (0,1) is border wall, (1,0) border wall, (2,1) might be accessible.\n\n(2,1) is free? x=2,y=1, not border, not internal obstacle (internal: (5,1) but not (2,1)), so (2,1) is free.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move to (1,1) if possible.\n\nBut (1,1) has food, but to move to (1,1), I need to be at (2,1) or (1,0) or (0,1) or (1,2), but (1,0) and (0,1) walls, (1,2) wall, so only possible from (2,1) to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is at corner, with walls around except (2,1).\n\ny=1, x=1.\n\nAdjacent: (x,y+1)=(1,2) wall, (x,y-1)=(1,0) wall, (x-1,y)=(0,1) wall, (x+1,y)=(2,1) free.\n\nSo only access from (2,1).\n\nI need to be at (2,1) to move to (1,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is not occupied now.\n\nCan I get to (2,1) by turn 73?\n\nCurrent position after turn 71: head at (3,5)\n\nTurn 72: I can move to (3,6) or (4,5)\n\n(3,6) is tail, moving there is safe.\n\n(4,5) is empty.\n\nNow, to go to (2,1), it's far.\n\n(3,5) to (2,1) is |Δx|=1, |Δy|=4, so min 4 moves, but with obstacles.\n\nPath: from (3,5) to (2,1), I need to go down and left.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), if I go left to (2,5), but (2,5) is occupied by snake body, seg11 at (2,5), so I cannot move there directly.\n\nAfter turn 71, positions: head (3,5), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (4,4), ..., seg11 (2,5), seg12 (2,6), seg13 (3,6)\n\nSo (2,5) is occupied, so I cannot move left to (2,5) from (3,5).\n\nOnly moves: U to (3,6) or R to (4,5)\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), (3,6) is tail, so head to (3,6), then new tail is (3,6) moves? After move, new head (3,6), then body: seg1 (3,5), seg2 (3,4), etc., and tail (3,6) was tail, but now head is there, so the segment that was at (3,6) is now part of body, and new tail is the previous seg12 or something.\n\nLet's simulate turn 72 move.\n\nSuppose turn 72, I move U to (3,6).\n\nCurrent head at (3,5), move U to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) was tail, so moving there is safe.\n\nAfter move, new head: (3,6)\n\nThen new body: seg1: old head (3,5), seg2: old seg1 (3,4), seg3: old seg2 (4,4), seg4: old seg3 (4,3), seg5: old seg4 (4,2), seg6: old seg5 (3,2), seg7: old seg6 (3,3), seg8: old seg7 (2,3), seg9: old seg8 (1,3), seg10: old seg9 (1,4), seg11: old seg10 (1,5), seg12: old seg11 (2,5), and new tail: old seg12 (2,6)? Old positions: before move, seg12 was (2,6), seg13 was (3,6)\n\nAfter move to (3,6), new head (3,6)\n\nThen seg1: (3,5)  // old head\n\nseg2: (3,4)  // old seg1\n\nseg3: (4,4)  // old seg2\n\nseg4: (4,3)  // old seg3\n\nseg5: (4,2)  // old seg4\n\nseg6: (3,2)  // old seg5, food here\n\nseg7: (3,3)  // old seg6\n\nseg8: (2,3)  // old seg7\n\nseg9: (1,3)  // old seg8\n\nseg10: (1,4)  // old seg9\n\nseg11: (1,5)  // old seg10\n\nseg12: (2,5)  // old seg11\n\nseg13: (2,6)  // old seg12, now tail\n\nOld seg13 (3,6) is now head, so not tail anymore.\n\nNew tail is (2,6)\n\n(3,2) still occupied.\n\nNow head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: from (3,6), can go U to (3,7), but y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (3,5), but (3,5) is now seg1, body, so collision, and also, current direction U, moving D is reverse, not allowed.\n\nL to (2,6): (2,6) is tail? In new positions, (2,6) is tail, so can move there.\n\nR to (4,6): (4,6) was freed earlier, should be empty. Not wall, not occupied, so can move.\n\nSo possible: L to (2,6) or R to (4,6)\n\nIf I go L to (2,6), it's tail, safe.\n\nR to (4,6), empty, safe.\n\nBut to reach (2,1), I need to go down.\n\nFrom (3,6), if I go R to (4,6), then head at (4,6), then I can go down, etc.\n\nBut (2,1) is far, and I have only until turn 73 to eat (1,1).\n\nTurn 71: I moved to (3,5)\n\nTurn 72: if I move, say, to (4,5) or (3,6), but let's see the time.\n\nTurn 71 action: U to (3,5)  // I have to do this, only choice\n\nTurn 72: I can choose U to (3,6) or R to (4,5)\n\nIf I go to (4,5), then head at (4,5), direction from (3,5) to (4,5) is right, so direction R.\n\nThen from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\n(4,6) is empty? After turn 71, (4,6) was tail and removed, so free.\n\n(4,4) is seg2, body, so moving down to (4,4) collision.\n\n(3,5) is seg1, body, moving left collision and reverse? Direction R, moving L is reverse, not allowed.\n\nR to (5,5): (5,5) free? x=5,y=5, not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so free.\n\nU to (4,6) free.\n\nSo from (4,5), can go U or R.\n\nBut to go to (2,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (4,5), going U or R is away.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) on turn 72, head at (3,6), then I can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) is tail, moving there safe.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go down to (2,5) or left to (1,6) or right to (3,6), but (3,6) is body now.\n\nAfter moving to (2,6), let's say turn 72 move to (3,6), then turn 73 from (3,6) to (2,6).\n\nHead at (3,6) move L to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is tail, so safe.\n\nAfter move, new head (2,6), body: seg1 (3,6), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (3,4), etc., new tail old seg12 or something.\n\nBut (2,5) is now body, since after previous, (2,5) is seg12.\n\nFrom (2,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (2,5): (2,5) is body, collision.\n\nL to (1,6): (1,6) free? x=1,y=6, not wall, not obstacle (internal obstacles not at (1,6)), not snake, so free.\n\nR to (3,6): but (3,6) is now seg1, body, collision and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only move L to (1,6).\n\nThen at (1,6), I can go down to (1,5), but (1,5) is body, or other.\n\nBut (1,1) is at (1,1), I'm at (1,6), but to go down, there is obstacle at (1,2), so I cannot go directly down.\n\ny from 6 to 1, but (1,2) is wall, so I cannot reach (1,1) from above because (1,2) is blocked.\n\nThe only access is from (2,1), as I said.\n\nFrom (1,6), I can go to (1,7) wall, or (0,6) wall, or (1,5) body, or (2,6) body, so only (1,5) is body, cannot move, or (2,6) body, cannot.\n\nFrom (1,6), adjacent: U (1,7) wall, D (1,5) occupied by snake body, L (0,6) wall, R (2,6) occupied by body. So all invalid? That would be death.\n\nAfter moving to (2,6) on turn 73, head at (2,6), body includes (2,5), (1,5), etc.\n\nIf I move to (1,6), then from (1,6), down to (1,5) is body, left wall, up wall, right to (2,6) is body, so no move, death.\n\nSo that path is bad.\n\nI need to avoid going to (1,6) or such.\n\nTo reach (2,1), I need to approach from above or right.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) on turn 72, if I go R to (4,5), then to (4,4) but occupied, or to (5,5), etc., but (2,1) is far, and with obstacles, it might take more than 2 moves to reach (2,1) from (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,1): one path could be (3,5) -> (3,4) but (3,4) is body, cannot -> (2,4) but (2,4) is wall, cannot.\n\n(2,4) is wall, so I cannot go directly left from row 4 or 5 to row 3 or below because of the wall at (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is an obstacle, so column x=2 is blocked at y=4.\n\nSo to go from right of x=2 to left, I need to go below y=4 or above.\n\ny=4 is blocked at x=2.\n\nSo below y=4, at x=2, y=3 is (2,3), which is snake body now.\n\nOr above, y=5,6,7 but y=7 wall.\n\nAt y=5, x=2 is (2,5), occupied.\n\ny=6, (2,6) occupied.\n\nSo currently, all access to left of x=3 is blocked by snake or walls.\n\nSpecifically, to reach (2,1), I need to go through (3,1) or (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,2) : x=2,y=2, not wall, but is it free? Internal obstacle at (1,2), not (2,2), so (2,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1), etc.\n\nBut from current position (3,5), to (2,2), for example.\n\nBut (2,4) wall, so I need to go around, either below or above, but above is y=5,6,7, but at y=5, x=2 is occupied, y=6 occupied, y=7 wall.\n\nBelow y=4, y=3,2,1.\n\nAt y=3, x=2 is (2,3), occupied by snake.\n\ny=2, x=2 is (2,2), free? Let's assume.\n\nBut to reach (2,2), from (3,5), I can go down to (3,4) but occupied, or right to (4,5), then down to (4,4) but occupied, etc.\n\nIt will take several moves, and with the snake body, it's messy.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) to (4,5) on turn 72.\n\nThen head at (4,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 73, from (4,5), can go U to (4,6) or R to (5,5) or D to (4,4) but occupied, or L to (3,5) occupied and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nSay go to (5,5).\n\nThen to (5,4), but (5,4) may be free, but then to (5,3), etc., but to reach (2,1), it's far, and I have only turn 72 and 73 to reach (1,1), but at turn 73, I need to be at (2,1) to move to (1,1) on turn 74? Turn 73 is the last turn to eat (1,1), since life span 3, at turn 71,72,73.\n\nTurn 71: I moved to (3,5), not eating (1,1).\n\nTurn 72: I am at (4,5) or (3,6), not at (2,1).\n\nTurn 73: I need to move to (1,1), so I need to be at (2,1) on turn 73 to move to (1,1).\n\nBut from turn 72 position, say (4,5), to (2,1) in one move? Impossible, min distance is |Δx|=2, |Δy|=4, so at least 4 moves, but I have only one move for turn 73 from turn 72 position.\n\nFrom turn 72 head position, I can move one step, so to eat on turn 73, I need to be adjacent to (1,1) on turn 73, so at (2,1) on turn 73.\n\nBut on turn 72, I am at (3,5) or wherever, I can only move one cell, so on turn 72, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (2,1), like (2,2), (3,1), (2,0) but wall, (1,1) itself, but to eat, I need to move to it.\n\nTo eat on turn 73, on turn 73 I move to (1,1), so on turn 73 I must be at a cell adjacent to (1,1), which is only (2,1), since others are walls.\n\nSo on turn 73, head must be at (2,1).\n\nOn turn 72, head must be at a cell that can reach (2,1) in one move, so adjacent to (2,1).\n\nAdjacent to (2,1): (2,2), (2,0), (1,1), (3,1)\n\n(2,0) wall, (1,1) is the food cell, but to move to it, I need to be adjacent, so on turn 72, head must be at (2,2) or (3,1) to move to (2,1) or directly to (1,1) from (2,1)? No.\n\nOn turn 72, if I am at (2,2), I can move to (2,1) on turn 73, but (2,1) is not the food, (1,1) is food.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move to (1,1) on turn 73.\n\nBut turn 73 is the last turn, so I can eat on turn 73 by moving to (1,1).\n\nSo on turn 73, move to (1,1).\n\nFor that, on turn 73, head must be at a cell adjacent to (1,1), which is only (2,1).\n\nSo on turn 73, head at (2,1).\n\nThen on turn 72, head must be at a cell adjacent to (2,1), which are (2,2), (2,0), (1,1), (3,1)\n\n(2,0) wall, (1,1) is the food, but I can be at (1,1) on turn 72? But if I am at (1,1) on turn 72, I eat it then, but life span allows, but then for turn 73 it's gone, but I can eat on turn 72.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) or (2,2).\n\nOn turn 72, I need to be at (2,2) or (3,1) or (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) is far from current position.\n\nCurrent after turn 71: head at (3,5)\n\nOn turn 72, I can move to (3,6) or (4,5)\n\nNeither is close to (2,2) or (3,1).\n\n(2,2) is at x=2,y=2, (3,5) is at x=3,y=5, so |Δx|=1, |Δy|=3, min 3 moves, so from turn 71 position, I need at least 2 moves to reach (2,2), but turn 72 is one move, so on turn 72 I can reach cells like (3,4) but occupied, or (2,5) occupied, or (3,6), or (4,5), both not near (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,5), moving to (3,6) or (4,5), both at y=5 or 6, while (2,2) is at y=2, so I can't reach in one move.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is at y=1, even farther.\n\nSo it's impossible to reach (1,1) by turn 73. The food will disappear without being eaten.\n\nTherefore, I should not pursue (1,1); it's not reachable in time.\n\nSo focus on other food.\n\nFood at (6,5) has life span 6, so available until turn 76.\n\nAnd food at (3,2) with life span 9.\n\n(3,2) is under the body, so I need to free it.\n\nAlso, (6,5) is at (6,5), which is near the right side.\n\nFirst, let's plan to free the food at (3,2).\n\nCurrently, after turn 71 move, head at (3,5), and (3,2) is occupied by seg6.\n\nAs the snake moves, the body will shift, and eventually the tail will move away from (3,2), but it depends on the path.\n\nThe cell (3,2) will be freed when the segment that occupies it moves away and no new segment comes, but since the snake moves, the position is vacated when that body part moves to the next position.\n\nFor example, (3,2) is currently occupied by seg5 after turn 71 move? After turn 71: seg5 is (3,2)\n\nWhen the snake moves next, seg5 will move to the position of old seg4, which is (4,2), so (3,2) will be vacated, and the new position at (4,2) for that segment.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nAfter turn 71: positions as above.\n\nTurn 72: suppose I move somewhere.\n\nIf I move, say, to (4,5) on turn 72.\n\nHead from (3,5) to (4,5), so new head (4,5)\n\nThen body: seg1 (3,5), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (3,2), etc.\n\nOld seg5 was (3,2), now it moves to old seg4 position (4,2)? Indices: new seg1: (3,5), new seg2: (3,4), new seg3: (4,4), new seg4: (4,3), new seg5: (4,2), new seg6: (3,2), so (3,2) is still occupied by new seg6.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (3,6), new head (3,6), body seg1 (3,5), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (3,2), same thing.\n\nSo (3,2) is still occupied.\n\nWhen will it be freed? When the segment that occupies it moves to a different position.\n\nCurrently seg6 is at (3,2). When the snake moves, seg6 will move to the position of seg5, which is (4,2) or whatever seg5 is at that time.\n\nAfter each move, the body segments shift, so the cell (3,2) will be occupied until the segment that is there moves away.\n\nSince the snake is long, it might take several moves.\n\nThe position (3,2) is currently occupied by seg6 (after turn 71).\n\nWhen we move on turn 72, new seg6 will be at the position of old seg5, which is (4,2) if I move in a way that doesn't change, but old seg5 is (3,2), no.\n\nAfter turn 71, seg5 is (3,2)\n\nOn turn 72 move, new positions: new head to new cell, then new seg1 = old head position, new seg2 = old seg1 position, ..., new seg5 = old seg4 position, new seg6 = old seg5 position, which is (3,2), so (3,2) is still occupied by new seg6.\n\nSimilarly, on subsequent moves, as long as the body shifts, (3,2) will be occupied by some segment until the tail passes it.\n\nThe tail is at (3,6), so when the tail moves away from the area, but (3,2) is far from tail.\n\nTo free (3,2), I need the snake to move such that the segment at (3,2) moves to another cell, and no new segment comes to (3,2).\n\nSince the snake moves, the body shifts, so (3,2) will be vacated when the segment that was there moves to the next position, and the previous segment doesn't come back, but in a straight move, it will be vacated and not reoccupied immediately.\n\nFor example, if the snake is moving in a direction, cells are vacated as the tail moves.\n\nBut here, the snake is coiled, so it's not straightforward.\n\nThe cell (3,2) is occupied, and it will be freed when the body part that is there leaves and the tail moves past or something.\n\nPerhaps I should count how many moves until the tail is at (3,2).\n\nThe tail is at (3,6), and the body is from (3,6) to (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), etc.\n\nThe segment at (3,2) is part of the body.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so the position of each segment changes.\n\nThe cell (3,2) will be freed when the segment that occupies it moves to a different cell during a move, and no other segment moves to it at the same time, but since the body shifts, it's the tail movement that frees cells.\n\nSpecifically, when the snake moves without eating, the tail position is vacated.\n\nBut (3,2) is not the tail.\n\nTo free a specific cell under the body, I need the snake to move so that the body part leaves that cell and it is not occupied by the next move.\n\nIn this case, since the snake is moving, (3,2) will be vacated after some moves when the segment moves away.\n\nFor example, if I keep moving, after 5 moves or so, the segment at (3,2) will have moved to another position.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a way that the head goes to the food when it's free.\n\nBut let's look at the food at (6,5), which is easier.\n\n(6,5) is at x=6,y=5, which is not occupied, and no wall, but there is an internal obstacle at (6,4), which is below it.\n\n(6,4) is wall, so (6,5) is above it.\n\nFrom current head at (3,5), I can move right towards it.\n\nFor example, on turn 72, from (3,5), I can move R to (4,5).\n\nThen head at (4,5).\n\nThen from there, I can move to (5,5), then to (6,5), but (6,5) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, life span: available until turn 76, so I have time.\n\nFrom (4,5), to (5,5) is one move, then to (6,5) another.\n\nBut on turn 72, move to (4,5).\n\nTurn 73, move to (5,5).\n\nTurn 74, move to (6,5) and eat.\n\nBut when I eat, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n\nBut first, let's see the path.\n\n(5,5) is free? x=5,y=5, not wall, not obstacle, not snake, yes.\n\n(6,5) free, food.\n\nBut from (5,5) to (6,5), is there any issue?\n\nInternal obstacle at (6,4), but (6,5) is above, so ok.\n\nAlso, walls: x=6 is not border, x=7 is border, so x=6 is ok.\n\ny=5 ok.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut I need to think about the direction and no reverse.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake is longer.\n\nBut for now, it seems good.\n\nBut there is a food at (3,2) that I might want to eat later.\n\nBut life span 9, so after eating (6,5), I can go for (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is under body now.\n\nAfter a few moves, it might be free.\n\nFor example, after I move to (4,5) on turn 72, positions: head (4,5), body seg1 (3,5), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (3,2), etc.\n\n(3,2) still occupied.\n\nThen turn 73, move to (5,5), new head (5,5), body seg1 (4,5), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (3,4), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (4,2), seg7 (3,2), so (3,2) now seg7.\n\nStill occupied.\n\nThen turn 74, move to (6,5), and eat, so since I eat, tail doesn't move, new head (6,5), then body: seg1 (5,5), but since eating, the body adds a new segment at the tail position, so positions: head (6,5), then the previous body: but when eating, the tail stays, so the new body includes all previous segments plus the tail position duplicated? Standard: when eat, head moves to food, new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n\nSo after eating at (6,5), new head (6,5), body: old head position becomes new seg1, so (5,5) new seg1, then old seg1 (4,5) new seg2, old seg2 (3,5) new seg3, ..., up to old tail, which was at (2,6) or something, but let's not list all.\n\nThe point is, (3,2) is still occupied by some segment.\n\nAfter this, I can move to free (3,2).\n\nBut let's first complete the action for turn 71.\n\nTurn 71: only move is U to (3,5), so I must do that.\n\nThen for turn 72, I can choose U or R.\n\nIf I go R to (4,5), I can reach (6,5) by turn 74.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then I might go to the top, but less useful.\n\nAlso, there is a risk with the tail or something.\n\nAnother thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, no food at tail now.\n\nTail is at (3,6), no food there.\n\nFood is at (1,1), (6,5), (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is not tail.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSo probably better to go for (6,5) since it's reachable.\n\nMoreover, (1,1) is not reachable, so ignore.\n\n(3,2) can be eaten later.\n\nSo plan:\n\nTurn 71: U to (3,5)  // must\n\nTurn 72: R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 73: from (4,5), direction R, so can go U to (4,6) or R to (5,5) (since D and L not possible or invalid).\n\nAs before, U to (4,6) or R to (5,5)\n\nTo go to (6,5), I need to go to (5,5) first.\n\n(5,5) is free, so go R to (5,5) on turn 73.\n\nThen turn 74: from (5,5), direction R, can go to (6,5) and eat.\n\nNow, when I go to (6,5), it is food, so I eat it, snake grows.\n\nNow, after that, I can think about (3,2).\n\nBut life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe format is for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=71.\n\nSo for turn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: R\n\nTurn 73: R to (5,5)? From (4,5) to (5,5) is R.\n\nTurn 74: R to (6,5)\n\nBut after turn 74, I eat, so I need to continue.\n\nBut the answer might not need all, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a bit further.\n\nAfter turn 74, head at (6,5), after eating.\n\nNow, direction R.\n\nPossible moves: from (6,5), can go U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R to (7,5)\n\nBut R to (7,5): x=7 is border wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,4): but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,5): (5,5) is now body segment, since after eating, the previous head (5,5) is now body, so moving left to (5,5) would collide with body.\n\nU to (6,6): (6,6) free? x=6,y=6, not wall, not obstacle, not snake? After eating, positions: head (6,5), body includes (5,5), (4,5), etc., but (6,6) should be free.\n\nAssuming no food or other.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut I also have the food at (3,2) to consider.\n\n(3,2) has life span 9, at turn 71, so available until turn 79.\n\nAfter turn 74, it's turn 74, so still time.\n\nBut I need to free it first.\n\nCurrently, after turn 74, the snake is longer, and (3,2) might be free or not.\n\nLet's see when (3,2) is freed.\n\nInitially, at turn 71, (3,2) is occupied.\n\nAs the snake moves, the body shifts.\n\nFor example, when I move to (4,5) on turn 72, (3,2) still occupied.\n\nMove to (5,5) on turn 73, (3,2) still occupied.\n\nMove to (6,5) on turn 74, and eat, so tail doesn't move, so the segment at (3,2) is still there, but shifted.\n\nAfter turn 73 move to (5,5) without eating, positions: head (5,5), body seg1 (4,5), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (3,4), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (4,2), seg7 (3,2), etc.\n\nThen turn 74 move to (6,5) and eat, so new head (6,5), new seg1 (5,5), new seg2 (4,5), new seg3 (3,5), new seg4 (3,4), new seg5 (4,4), new seg6 (4,3), new seg7 (4,2), and since eating, new segment added at tail, so the old tail position is duplicated, but the cell (3,2) is now occupied by new seg7 (4,2)? After turn 73, tail was at, let's find.\n\nAfter turn 73: head (5,5), body: from previous, after turn 72 head (4,5), body seg1 (3,5), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (3,2), seg7 (3,3), ..., up to tail.\n\nEarlier list: after turn 72 move to (4,5): positions head (4,5), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (3,2), seg7 (3,3), seg8 (2,3), seg9 (1,3), seg10 (1,4), seg11 (1,5), seg12 (2,5), seg13 (2,6) tail? After turn 71, tail was (3,6), but after move to (4,5), new tail is old seg13 (3,6)? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 71: head (3,5), body: seg1 (3,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (3,3), seg7 (2,3), seg8 (1,3), seg9 (1,4), seg10 (1,5), seg11 (2,5), seg12 (2,6), seg13 (3,6) tail\n\nTurn 72 move to (4,5): new head (4,5), new seg1 (3,5), new seg2 (3,4), new seg3 (4,4), new seg4 (4,3), new seg5 (4,2), new seg6 (3,2), new seg7 (3,3), new seg8 (2,3), new seg9 (1,3), new seg10 (1,4), new seg11 (1,5), new seg12 (2,5), new seg13 (2,6) tail\n\n(3,2) is new seg6.\n\nTurn 73 move to (5,5) without eating: new head (5,5), new seg1 (4,5), new seg2 (3,5), new seg3 (3,4), new seg4 (4,4), new seg5 (4,3), new seg6 (4,2), new seg7 (3,2), new seg8 (3,3), new seg9 (2,3), new seg10 (1,3), new seg11 (1,4), new seg12 (1,5), new seg13 (2,5) tail\n\n(3,2) is new seg7.\n\nTurn 74 move to (6,5) and eat: new head (6,5), new seg1 (5,5), new seg2 (4,5), new seg3 (3,5), new seg4 (3,4), new seg5 (4,4), new seg6 (4,3), new seg7 (4,2), and new segment added at old tail position (2,5), so new seg8 (2,5), but old tail was (2,5), so new seg8 is at (2,5), and previous segments continue: new seg9 (3,3)? List:\n\nAfter move to (6,5) and eat, new positions: head (6,5), then the body segments: the old head becomes new seg1, so (5,5) new seg1, old seg1 (4,5) new seg2, old seg2 (3,5) new seg3, old seg3 (3,4) new seg4, old seg4 (4,4) new seg5, old seg5 (4,3) new seg6, old seg6 (4,2) new seg7, old seg7 (3,2) new seg8, old seg8 (3,3) new seg9, old seg9 (2,3) new seg10, old seg10 (1,3) new seg11, old seg11 (1,4) new seg12, old seg12 (1,5) new seg13, and since eating, a new segment is added at the position of old tail, which was old seg13 (2,5), so new seg14 (2,5). But (2,5) is already occupied by new seg13? Confusion.\n\nStandard: when eating, the tail does not move, so the new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail position is duplicated.\n\nAfter turn 73, positions before move: head (5,5), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (3,4), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (4,2), seg7 (3,2), seg8 (3,3), seg9 (2,3), seg10 (1,3), seg11 (1,4), seg12 (1,5), seg13 (2,5) tail\n\nMove head to (6,5), which is food, so eat, so new head (6,5), new seg1: old head (5,5), new seg2: old seg1 (4,5), new seg3: old seg2 (3,5), new seg4: old seg3 (3,4), new seg5: old seg4 (4,4), new seg6: old seg5 (4,3), new seg7: old seg6 (4,2), new seg8: old seg7 (3,2), new seg9: old seg8 (3,3), new seg10: old seg9 (2,3), new seg11: old seg10 (1,3), new seg12: old seg11 (1,4), new seg13: old seg12 (1,5), and new seg14: old tail position (2,5), so (2,5) has two segments now? No, the new segment is added at the tail position, so it's a new cell, but the position is the same.\n\nThe cell (2,5) now has the new tail and the new segment, but in terms of positions, new seg13: old seg12 (1,5), new seg14: position (2,5), and old tail was at (2,5), so it's fine, the snake has an additional segment at (2,5).\n\nBut (3,2) is now occupied by new seg8.\n\nTo free (3,2), I need to move the snake so that this segment moves away.\n\nEventually, when the tail passes, but it might take time.\n\nSince I am at (6,5), I can move to free space.\n\nFor example, after turn 74, head at (6,5), only move U to (6,6), as we said.\n\nThen from (6,6), I can go L to (5,6) or D to (6,5) but occupied, or U to (6,7) wall, or R to (7,6) wall.\n\nSo L to (5,6) or D to (6,5) invalid.\n\nSo L to (5,6).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut to eat (3,2), I need to go back left.\n\nBut there might be risks with walls and body.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (6,5) and instead free (3,2) first.\n\nBut (6,5) is easy to get, and (3,2) might take time.\n\nLife span of (3,2) is 9, so at turn 71, it will disappear after turn 79, so I have until turn 79 to eat it.\n\nAfter turn 74, it's turn 74, so 5 more turns.\n\nBut let's see if I can free it sooner.\n\nFrom the beginning, after turn 71 move to (3,5), on turn 72, if I move to (3,6), then to (4,6) or (2,6), etc., but it might not help free (3,2) faster.\n\nThe fastest way to free (3,2) is to move the snake in a way that the body shifts and the segment leaves.\n\nBut since the snake is long, it will take several moves for the tail to catch up.\n\nFor example, the distance from head to the segment at (3,2).\n\nIn the body, (3,2) is seg5 after turn 71, which is 5 segments from head, but when the snake moves, the indices change.\n\nPerhaps count the number of moves until the cell is vacated.\n\nAssume the snake moves straight, the cell will be freed when the tail passes that point.\n\nTail is at (3,6), (3,2) is at same x, different y, |dy|=4, so if the snake moves down, it might free faster, but there are obstacles.\n\nFrom current, if I move down, but I can't because body is there.\n\nAfter turn 71, head at (3,5), I can only go up or right.\n\nIf I go up to (3,6), then I can go to (4,6) or (2,6), but (2,6) might be possible.\n\nBut it doesn't directly help.\n\nPerhaps I should accept that (3,2) will be freed in time, and I can eat it later.\n\nFor the immediate plan, go for (6,5).\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nSince at turn 71, only U is possible, so:\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nThen for turn 72, I choose R to go towards (6,5).\n\nThen turn 73: R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 74: R to (6,5)\n\nThen after that, I need to move to avoid dead ends.\n\nAfter turn 74, head at (6,5), must go U to (6,6)\n\nThen turn 75: from (6,6), direction U, can go L to (5,6) or D to (6,5) invalid, so L to (5,6)\n\nThen from (5,6), can go U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5), L to (4,6), R to (6,6) but (6,6) is body now.\n\nAfter moving to (6,6) on turn 74? Turn 74 action is to (6,5), but let's sequence.\n\nTurn 74: move to (6,5) and eat.\n\nThen for turn 75, from (6,5), move U to (6,6)\n\nNow head at (6,6), direction U.\n\nThen for turn 75, I move to (6,6)\n\nNow for turn 76, from (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7) wall, D to (6,5) body, L to (5,6), R to (7,6) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,6)\n\nMove to (5,6)\n\nDirection from (6,6) to (5,6) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen turn 77, from (5,6), can go U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5), L to (4,6), R to (6,6) body.\n\n(5,5) is body, (6,6) body, (4,6) may be free.\n\n(4,6) x=4,y=6, not wall, not obstacle, not snake? After positions, need to see.\n\nBut I can go D to (5,5) or L to (4,6)\n\nBut (5,5) is body, so cannot, only L to (4,6) or U invalid, R invalid.\n\nSo L to (4,6)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the food at (3,2), I can plan to go there after.\n\nSince I need to output actions for a few turns, I can do up to turn 75 or so.\n\nThe answer format is to output for t1, t1+1, etc., but not specified how many.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions.\n\nt1=71, so up to turn 76 or more.\n\nBut let's list.\n\nFirst, turn 71: U\n\nThen turn 72: R (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 73: R (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 74: R (to (6,5), eat)\n\nThen turn 75: from (6,5), only U to (6,6)\n\nTurn 76: from (6,6), only L to (5,6)\n\nNow turn 77: from (5,6), to (4,6) or (5,5) but (5,5) body, so to (4,6)\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nAlso, at turn 76, food (6,5) might still be there if not eaten, but I ate it on turn 74.\n\nLife span: (6,5) life span 6, at turn 71, so on turn 76, life span 1, so available, but I ate it earlier.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) disappears after turn 73.\n\n(3,2) still available.\n\nAfter turn 76, head at (5,6), move to (4,6) on turn 77.\n\nThen from (4,6), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can output until turn 75 or 76.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but for output, perhaps 5 turns: turn 71 to 75.\n\nBut turn 75 action is U to (6,6), which is after eating.\n\nNow, about the food at (3,2): to eat it, I need to be at (3,2) when it is free.\n\nIt will be freed when the segment leaves, but in the current path, it might not be soon.\n\nFor example, in the positions after turn 74, (3,2) is occupied by seg8.\n\nAs I move away, it will take many moves to free it.\n\nBut since life span is long, I can navigate back.\n\nTo save time, I should include freeing (3,2) in the plan.\n\nBut for now, with the immediate actions, I think going for (6,5) is fine.\n\nAlso, there might be a risk if I go to the top and get stuck, but with the grid, I can go down later.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), I can go to (4,6), then to (4,7) wall, or (3,6), etc.\n\nBut (3,6) might be free or not.\n\nAfter several moves, positions change.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: R\n\nTurn 73: R\n\nTurn 74: R\n\nThen turn 75: U (to (6,6))\n\nBut turn 75 is from (6,5) to (6,6), so U.\n\nThen for turn 76, I can add, but not necessary.\n\nSince the format might expect actions, and I have 4 actions, but thinking ahead, I can add one more.\n\nTurn 76: from (6,6) to (5,6), which is L.\n\nSo in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the head direction for no reverse.\n\nAt turn 71, head direction L, move U, not reverse.\n\nTurn 72, from (3,5), after moving U, direction U, move R to (4,5), perpendicular, not reverse.\n\nTurn 73, from (4,5), direction R (since moved right), move R to (5,5), same direction.\n\nTurn 74, from (5,5), direction R, move R to (6,5), same.\n\nTurn 75, from (6,5), direction R, move U to (6,6), perpendicular, not reverse.\n\nAll good.\n\nFor (3,2), I can plan to eat it later, but for the sequence, this should be fine.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 71):**\n- **Grid Size:** 8x8 (walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7).\n- **Internal Obstacles:** (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — these cells are blocked.\n- **Snake Position:** Head at (3,4), with body segments: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] (14 segments total; tail at (4,6)).\n- **Head Direction:** Left (L).\n- **Food:**\n  - (1,1): Value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 73).\n  - (6,5): Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 76).\n  - (3,2): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 79) — currently under snake body (segment at index 4).\n\n**Immediate Constraints and Risks:**\n- **Turn 71 Movement:** From head position (3,4), possible moves:\n  - Left (L) to (2,4): Blocked by internal obstacle (wall), invalid.\n  - Up (U) to (3,5): Empty and safe.\n  - Down (D) to (3,3): Occupied by body segment (index 5), collision risk, invalid.\n  - Right (R) to (4,4): Occupied by body segment (index 1) and instant reverse (opposite to current direction L), invalid.\n  - **Only valid move is Up (U) to (3,5).**\n- **Food Prioritization:**\n  - (1,1) is unreachable by turn 73 due to distance, obstacles, and snake body blocking paths. It will disappear uneaten.\n  - (6,5) is reachable by turn 74 and has moderate life span (until turn 76). Eating it provides +1 score and grows the snake.\n  - (3,2) is under the body but has long life span (until turn 79). It can be eaten later once freed by snake movement.\n- **Long-Term Survival:** After eating (6,5), the snake must avoid dead ends. The area near (6,5) has walls (e.g., (6,4) obstacle, x=7 border), so movements must steer toward open spaces. (3,2) can be targeted after turn 74.\n\n**5+ Turn Plan:**\n1. **Turn 71 (Current):** Move Up (U) to (3,5) — only valid move.\n2. **Turn 72:** Move Right (R) to (4,5) — positions snake to approach (6,5). From (3,5), moving R avoids body and is not a reverse (previous direction U).\n3. **Turn 73:** Move Right (R) to (5,5) — continues path to (6,5). Direction remains R, so no reverse.\n4. **Turn 74:** Move Right (R) to (6,5) — eat positive food (+1 score, snake grows to 15 segments). Direction R, no reverse.\n5. **Turn 75:** Move Up (U) to (6,6) — after eating, from (6,5), only U is safe (D to (6,4) is obstacle, L to (5,5) is body, R to (7,5) is wall). Direction changes to U, not reverse.\n6. **Beyond (Thinking Ahead for Survival):**\n   - **Turn 76:** From (6,6), move Left (L) to (5,6) — only safe move (U to (6,7) wall, D to (6,5) body, R to (7,6) wall). Direction changes to L.\n   - **Turn 77:** From (5,6), move Left (L) to (4,6) — prepares to navigate toward (3,2) once freed. (U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5) body, R to (6,6) body). Direction L.\n   - **Freeing (3,2):** (3,2) is currently occupied but will free as the tail moves. By turn 77, the snake can start moving left/down toward (3,2) when safe. Since (3,2) has life span until turn 79, there is time to eat it after turn 77.\n   - **Risks Avoided:** No tail-reward danger (food not near tail). Wall and body collisions are avoided in the plan.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 71-75):**  \nThis sequence maximizes immediate score by eating (6,5) while ensuring survival. Actions for turns 76+ can be planned based on the state after turn 75.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: R \\\\\nTurn 73: R \\\\\nTurn 74: R \\\\\nTurn 75: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 72. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think, since x=0 and x=7 are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls include border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So the playable grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, but with some cells blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). So the snake has 14 segments.\n\nHead direction is U, meaning up, so last move was upwards.\n\nFood: there are three food items:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 2\n\n- (6,5) with value 1 and life span 5\n\n- (3,2) with value 1 and life span 8? The format is (x,y, life_span, value), but in the input it says \"(1, 1, 2, 1)\" which I think is (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, (6,5,5,1) and (3,2,8,1). All have value 1, so all positive food? But it says value1, value2, etc., all 1, so no negative food here. Value 1 is positive, since penalty is -1 for negative.\n\nLife span: for (1,1) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so if we're on turn 72, life_span 2 means it will be there for turn 72 and 73, and disappear after turn 73 or before turn 74? Let's see: \"life-span disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L-1 more turns? I need to clarify.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life_span L. After turn t, countdown decreases by 1, so after L decreases, it disappears. Since it decreases every turn including current, at turn t, L is the remaining turns including current.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, then after this turn (turn t), it decreases to L-1, and so on. It disappears when countdown reaches 0? Or after N turns?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after N turns\" means it lasts for N turns from now, including current or not?\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to interpret: at the beginning of turn t, if food has life_span L, it means it will disappear after L more turns, including the current one? Or after?\n\nStandard way: \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now, so it exists for N turns including current or not?\n\nThe countdown decreases every turn including current, so if at turn t, life_span is L, then during turn t, it is present, and after turn t, countdown becomes L-1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears, so after the turn where countdown was 1, it disappears.\n\nFor example, life_span 2 at turn t: at turn t, it is present; after turn t, countdown decreases to 1; at turn t+1, it is present; after turn t+1, countdown decreases to 0, so it disappears before turn t+2. So it is available on turns t and t+1.\n\nSimilarly, for life_span L, it is available for L turns: from turn t to turn t+L-1.\n\nIn this case, for food at (1,1): life_span 2, so available on turn 72 and 73.\n\n(6,5): life_span 5, available turn 72 to 76.\n\n(3,2): life_span 8, available turn 72 to 79.\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,5), direction U (up).\n\nI need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so cells from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSo blocked cells: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, plus (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is blocked, (2,4) blocked, (5,1) blocked, (6,1) blocked, (6,4) blocked.\n\nNow, snake positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nHead: (3,5)\n\nBody: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\n(3,6) is the tail.\n\nNow, food at (1,1), (6,5), (3,2)\n\n(3,2) has food, but (3,2) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (3,2), which is the 5th segment? Let's index: positions: 0: (3,5) head, 1: (3,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (3,3), 7: (2,3), 8: (1,3), 9: (1,4), 10: (1,5), 11: (2,5), 12: (2,6), 13: (3,6) tail.\n\nSo (3,2) is position index 5, which is a body segment, not the head or tail directly. But there is food at (3,2), and it's under the snake body.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nCurrently, (3,2) has food under it, but since the snake is on it, it can't be eaten now. Only when the snake moves away from that cell, and later head comes back when it's empty.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here tail is at (3,6), no food there.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), direction U. U is up, so moving to (x,y+1)? In coordinates, usually y increases upwards or downwards? The movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So U: y increases, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? But walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Let's see.\n\nIn the grid, with walls at y=0 and y=7, so if U is (x,y+1), that means y+1 is upwards, towards higher y, so y=7 is top, y=0 bottom.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nIn snake positions, (3,5) head, and direction U, so last move was to (3,5) from below, since U to (3,5) would come from (3,4)? But (3,4) is the next segment, so yes, it moved up to (3,5).\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,5): since direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D, because D is opposite, and no instant reverse.\n\nSo possible actions: U (up to (3,6)), L (left to (2,5)), R (right to (4,5)).\n\nNow, check if these are valid and safe.\n\nFirst, U to (3,6): what is at (3,6)? Snake positions have (3,6) as the tail. Tail is at (3,6). If I move to (3,6), which is the tail, is that allowed?\n\nIn snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so if head moves to the current tail position, it should be ok because the tail will move away, so no collision, except for the tail reward danger case.\n\nBut tail reward danger is only if there is food on the tail cell and head is adjacent, then eating it causes collision.\n\nHere, (3,6) has no food, I think. Food is at (1,1), (6,5), (3,2), not at (3,6). So moving to tail should be fine, as long as it's not a wall or other body part.\n\n(3,6) is currently occupied by tail, but after move, tail moves, so it becomes part of body, but head is there, so collision? No.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when head moves to a cell, if that cell is the current tail, and tail moves, then head occupies that cell, and tail moves to next, so no collision because tail leaves the cell.\n\nOnly if head moves to a cell that is a body part (not tail), it collides.\n\nIn this case, (3,6) is the tail, so moving to it is safe, because tail will move to wherever.\n\nSimilarly, if head moves to a cell that is not occupied, fine.\n\nIf head moves to a cell with food, it eats and grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nBut here, no food at (3,6).\n\nNow, also, walls: (3,6) is within x=1-6, y=1-6? y=6, and walls at y=7 and y=0, so y=6 is not wall, x=3 not wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), not (3,6). So (3,6) is empty except for tail.\n\nSimilarly, L to (2,5): what is there? (2,5) is in snake positions, it's index 11, which is a body segment, not tail. So if I move to (2,5), it's a body segment, collision.\n\nSnake positions: (2,5) is occupied, and it's not the tail, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nR to (4,5): what is (4,5)? Not in snake positions, not a wall, so empty.\n\nAlso, food? Food at (1,1), (6,5), (3,2), not (4,5), so no food.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,6): currently tail, so safe.\n\n- L to (2,5): body segment, collision, not safe.\n\n- R to (4,5): empty, safe.\n\nD is not possible because opposite direction.\n\nSo only U and R are possible from here.\n\nBut U to (3,6) and R to (4,5).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's list the current state clearly.\n\nGrid: 6x6, cells (1,1) to (6,6), but obstacles at (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nBlocked cells: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSnake: head (3,5), body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6)\n\nFood: (1,1) life 2, (6,5) life 5, (3,2) life 8\n\n(3,2) is occupied by snake body, index 5, so food is under it but not accessible now.\n\nNow, for turn 72, I need to choose action.\n\nOptions: U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then head moves to (3,6), and since no food, tail moves, so tail was (3,6), now it moves to the next segment? When head moves to a cell with no food, the tail moves one step.\n\nSnake movement: head moves to new position, if no food, tail is removed from the end. If food, tail stays, so snake grows.\n\nHere, moving to (3,6): (3,6) is current tail, so if head moves to (3,6), and no food there, then what happens? Head is now at (3,6), which was tail, and tail should move, but since head is at tail position, and tail moves, the new tail is the previous position of the second last segment.\n\nLet's think: snake positions before move: [ (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ]\n\nAfter move U to (3,6): head moves to (3,6), which was tail. Since no food, tail moves: the last segment (3,6) is removed, but head is now there, so positions become: head at (3,6), then the body segments shift: (3,5) becomes first body, (3,4), (4,4), etc., up to (2,6) which was second last, now last segment? List: new positions: head (3,6), then the previous head (3,5) becomes neck, so [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] and tail is (2,6).\n\n(2,6) was index 12, now it becomes the tail.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (4,5), head to (4,5), no food, so tail moves: positions [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] tail (2,6), and (3,6) is removed.\n\nNow, back to turn 72 actions.\n\nI need to think about food and long-term survival.\n\nFood at (1,1) has short life, only until turn 73, so if I want to eat it, I need to go there soon.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) has life 5, until turn 76, (3,2) has life 8, longer.\n\nBut (3,2) is currently under snake body, so I need to move the snake away so that cell is free, then head can come back.\n\n(3,2) is occupied by the snake at index 5, which is (4,2) index 4, (3,2) index 5, (3,3) index 6, etc.\n\nThe snake is moving, so depending on where it goes, the body will move away from (3,2) at some point.\n\nFor example, if I move in certain ways, the segment at (3,2) might move.\n\nBut it's not immediate.\n\nAlso, head at (3,5), (1,1) is at bottom left, (6,5) is top right, (3,2) is near bottom.\n\n(3,2) is at row 3, column 2, which is left side.\n\ny=2 is low, since y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so y=1 bottom, y=6 top.\n\nGrid y=1 to 6, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Since U is (x,y+1), so y increases up.\n\nSo (1,1) is bottom-left corner.\n\n(6,5) is top-right, since x=6, y=5.\n\n(3,2) is left, bottom.\n\nHead at (3,5), which is middle top.\n\n(3,5) is x=3, y=5, so top row is y=6, so y=5 is row below top.\n\nNow, food at (1,1): to reach (1,1) from (3,5), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut down from (3,5) is not possible directly because direction is U, and D is opposite, so I can't go down immediately.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go L to (2,5) or R to (4,5) or U to (3,6).\n\nBut L to (2,5) is blocked by body, as (2,5) is occupied.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nU to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), head to (3,6), which is top row, y=6.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: since I moved U, direction is now U, so I can go U, L, R, but U to (3,7) is y=7, wall, not possible. L to (2,6), R to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) is currently tail? After move, positions: if I go U on turn 72, new head at (3,6), body: (3,5), (3,4), ..., (2,5), (2,6) tail.\n\n(2,6) is tail, (3,5) is neck.\n\nFrom (3,6), direction U (since I moved up), so I can move U (not, wall), L to (2,6), R to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) is tail, so moving to it might be safe if no food.\n\n(4,6) is empty? Let's see grid: (4,6) not wall, not obstacle, not occupied? After turn 72, snake positions: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nSo (4,6) not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\n(2,6) is tail.\n\nIf I go L to (2,6), it's tail, no food, so safe.\n\nR to (4,6) free.\n\nD is opposite, not possible.\n\nSo from there, I can go to (2,6) or (4,6).\n\nBut if I go to (2,6), head to tail, fine.\n\nBut let's think about the food.\n\nFood at (1,1) life 2, so only available on turn 72 and 73. After that, gone.\n\nTurn 72 is now, so to eat on turn 72, I need to be at (1,1) on turn 72, but head is at (3,5), not adjacent, so impossible to eat on turn 72.\n\nEat on turn 73: I need to be at (1,1) on turn 73.\n\nFrom current position (3,5), on turn 72, I move to some place, then on turn 73 to (1,1).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (3,6), (4,5), or (2,5) but (2,5) blocked.\n\n(2,5) is occupied, so only (3,6) or (4,5).\n\nFrom (3,6) on turn 72, on turn 73 I can move to (2,6) or (4,6) or down to (3,5) but (3,5) is now body, and direction might not allow down.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6), direction is U, so from (3,6), I can move L to (2,6), R to (4,6), or D to (3,5) but D is opposite to current direction U, so not allowed, no instant reverse.\n\nSo only L or R from (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (4,5) on turn 72, then at (4,5), direction R (since I moved right), so from (4,5) turn 73, I can move U to (4,6), D to (4,4), or R to (5,5), but not L (opposite).\n\n(4,4) is body, occupied.\n\nTo reach (1,1) by turn 73.\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1).\n\nFrom current (3,5), the shortest path to (1,1) is left to (2,5) then down to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle! (2,4) is internal obstacle, blocked.\n\nSo (2,4) is wall, cannot go there.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (1,5) or (2,4) but (2,4) blocked, or (2,6) etc.\n\nPaths to (1,1):\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go L to (2,5) but (2,5) is occupied, not free, so I can't go there now.\n\nOnly U or R possible.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then from (3,6), I can go L to (2,6) on turn 73.\n\nFrom (2,6), I need to go to (1,1), but (2,6) to (1,1) is far, and obstacles.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can go left to (1,6) or down to (2,5), but (2,5) is body or what?\n\nAfter turn 72 U to (3,6), positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (3,4), ..., (2,5), (2,6) tail? No, tail is (2,6) but after move, when head moved to (3,6), tail moved to (2,6)? Earlier: after move U, positions: [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] so (2,6) is the last, tail.\n\nOn turn 73, from (3,6), if I move L to (2,6), head to (2,6), which is tail, no food, so tail moves: new head (2,6), then body (3,6), (3,5), etc., tail becomes (2,5) or something.\n\nBut from (2,6), to reach (1,1), I need to go down and left.\n\nBut (2,6) to (1,6) or (2,5) or (3,6) but (3,6) now body.\n\n(2,5) is occupied, as per above positions, (2,5) is body segment.\n\nSo from (2,6), possible moves: direction after moving L to (2,6) would be L (since I moved left), so from (2,6), I can move L to (1,6), D to (2,5), U to (2,7) wall, R to (3,6) body.\n\nBut (2,5) is occupied, so only possible to (1,6) if free.\n\n(1,6) is within grid, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles are (1,2), (2,4), etc., not (1,6), so (1,6) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,6), I can go down to (1,5), but (1,5) is occupied by snake? Current positions have (1,5), but after moves, it might be different.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nI think it's impossible to reach (1,1) by turn 73 from here, because:\n\n- On turn 72, from (3,5), I can only go to (3,6) or (4,5)\n\n- If to (3,6), on turn 73, I can go to (2,6) or (4,6)\n\n- Neither is close to (1,1)\n\nIf to (4,5) on turn 72, then on turn 73 from (4,5), direction R, can go U to (4,6), D to (4,4) but (4,4) occupied, or R to (5,5)\n\n(5,5) might be free.\n\nBut (5,5) to (1,1) is far, and with obstacles, like (2,4) blocked.\n\nSpecifically, to go to (1,1), I need to go to row 1, column 1, but (1,2) is blocked, so only access is from (1,1) to (1,1) itself or adjacent, like (1,1) can be reached from (1,2) or (2,1) or (1,0) wall.\n\n(1,1) adjacent cells: (1,2), (2,1), (1,0) wall, (0,1) wall. (1,0) and (0,1) walls, so only (1,2) and (2,1).\n\nBut (1,2) is internal obstacle, blocked, so the only way to (1,1) is from (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is not blocked, I think. Obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4), so (2,1) is free.\n\nSo (1,1) can only be accessed from (2,1).\n\n(2,1) can be accessed from (2,2), (3,1), (1,1), or (2,0) wall.\n\n(3,1) not blocked, (2,2) not blocked.\n\nBut to reach (2,1) quickly.\n\nFrom current position, with only one move to turn 73, I can't reach (2,1) or (1,1) in one move from turn 72 positions.\n\nTurn 72: after move, head at (3,6) or (4,5)\n\nFrom (3,6), turn 73: (2,6) or (4,6), both at y=6.\n\nFrom (4,5), turn 73: (4,6) or (5,5) or (4,4) but occupied, so (4,6) or (5,5)\n\nAll these are at top or middle, not near bottom.\n\n(1,1) is bottom left, so at least 2 moves away, but with obstacles, it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) to (2,1) would require moving down, but (2,4) blocked, so I have to go around, like to (1,6) then down to (1,5), but (1,5) is occupied, etc.\n\nIt will take several turns, and food at (1,1) disappears after turn 73, so not available on turn 74. Life span 2, available turn 72 and 73, gone after.\n\nSo impossible to eat (1,1). I should forget about it and focus on other food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) has life 5, available until turn 76, and (3,2) life 8 until turn 79.\n\n(3,2) is currently under snake body, so I need to free it first.\n\nThe snake is on (3,2), which is the 6th segment? Positions index 5: (3,2)\n\nWhen the snake moves, that cell will be freed when the body moves away.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a way that the segment at (3,2) moves to another position.\n\nCurrently, the snake is at (4,2) index 4, (3,2) index 5, (3,3) index 6.\n\nIf the head moves, the body will follow.\n\nSuppose I move R to (4,5) on turn 72.\n\nThen new head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) tail.\n\n(3,2) is still occupied.\n\nIf I then move, say, down from (4,5), but direction is R, so I can go U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,6), D to (4,4) but (4,4) is occupied, so to (4,6) or R to (5,5) or D not possible.\n\nSay on turn 73, from (4,5) direction R, I go D to (4,4) but occupied, not possible; U to (4,6), or R to (5,5).\n\nIf U to (4,6), then head to (4,6), no food, tail moves, so positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), tail (2,6) removed? After move to (4,6), no food, tail moves, so tail (2,6) removed, new positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] tail (2,5)\n\n(3,2) still occupied.\n\nIf I go R to (5,5) on turn 73, head to (5,5), no food, tail moves, positions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] tail (2,5)\n\n(3,2) occupied.\n\nTo free (3,2), I need the snake to move so that the body segment leaves (3,2). That will happen when the head moves and the body follows, but since the snake is long, it takes time for the tail to move away from (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is index 7 in the new list? Let's see the distance from head.\n\nIn the position list, the index of (3,2) is fixed relative to head movement.\n\nAfter turn 72 move R to (4,5), the segment at (3,2) is the 7th position from head: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), then (3,2) is 6th body? Positions: 0: (4,5) head, 1: (3,5), 2: (3,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3), etc.\n\nSo (3,2) is index 6.\n\nThe cell (3,2) will be freed when the tail has moved past it, i.e., when the snake has moved enough that the segment that was at (3,2) has moved, and the tail is beyond.\n\nSpecifically, the cell (3,2) will be empty when the snake moves such that the tail is no longer at that position or before.\n\nCurrently, after turn 72, (3,2) is occupied by index 6.\n\nWhen the snake moves, each move, the tail moves forward, so after k moves, the tail is at a new position, and the body shifts.\n\nAfter m moves, the segment that was at index i will be at index i-m or something.\n\nLet's think: each time the head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail is removed, so the body shifts down.\n\nAfter one move from turn 72 to 73, if no food eaten, tail is removed, so the position that was index 13 is gone, and all indices shift.\n\nFor example, after turn 72 move R to (4,5), positions as above, (3,2) at index 6.\n\nOn turn 73, if I move to some place, say U to (4,6), no food, then new head (4,6), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) and tail (2,5), so (3,2) is now index 7? Positions: 0: (4,6), 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (3,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3), etc.\n\n(3,2) is index 7.\n\nSimilarly, if I move, it stays occupied until the tail passes it.\n\nThe cell (3,2) will be freed when the segment that was there moves away and no other segment is there, but since the snake moves, the cell is freed when the tail has moved past that point.\n\nSpecifically, (3,2) is currently occupied by the snake. It will be empty when the tail is at a position that was after (3,2) in the body.\n\nThe number of moves needed to free (3,2) is the distance from the tail to that segment.\n\nCurrently, after turn 72 move R, positions: let's list indices for (3,2).\n\nAfter turn 72: positions, (3,2) is at position 6 (0-based, head 0).\n\nTail is at position 13, (2,5).\n\nThe cell (3,2) will be occupied until the tail moves to a position that was before it in the list, but since the tail is at the end, it will be freed when the tail has moved past index 6.\n\nAfter each move with no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the body shortens from the tail end.\n\nAfter k moves with no food, the segment that was at index i will be at index i-k, until it becomes the tail and is removed.\n\nFor example, after 0 moves, (3,2) at index 6.\n\nAfter 1 move no food, the tail is removed, so positions shift, (3,2) is now at index 5 of the new list? New list has one less element.\n\nAfter one move no food, the new positions have length 13, with head new, then body from old index 0 to 12, but old index 0 is now body, old index 1 to 12 are shifted down.\n\nBetter to think the cell (3,2) is occupied as long as the snake has a segment there.\n\nThe segment at (3,2) will move when the snake moves, to the position of the next segment.\n\nFor example, the segment at index 6, (3,2), on the next move, will move to where index 5 was, which is (4,2) in this case.\n\nAfter turn 72, positions: 0: (4,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (3,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (3,3), etc.\n\nOn turn 73, when head moves, the body segments move to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo segment at index 1 moves to position of old index 0, which is (4,5) if head moves, but head moves to new position.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo for segment at index i, it moves to the position that was index i-1.\n\nFor example, on turn 73, if head moves to (4,6), then:\n- New head (4,6)\n- New body index 1: old head position (4,5)\n- New body index 2: old body index 1 position (3,5)\n- New body index 3: old body index 2 position (3,4)\n- New body index 4: old body index 3 position (4,4)\n- New body index 5: old body index 4 position (4,3)\n- New body index 6: old body index 5 position (4,2)\n- New body index 7: old body index 6 position (3,2)\n- New body index 8: old body index 7 position (3,3)\n- and so on, up to new tail, which is old body index 13 position (2,5), but since no food, the last segment is removed, so new positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) so (3,2) is still occupied at index 7.\n\nThe cell (3,2) is occupied until the segment that was there moves away, but it moves to a new position each time.\n\nThe cell (3,2) will be empty when no segment is on it, which happens when the segment that was there has moved, and no other segment moves to it.\n\nSpecifically, the segment at (3,2) will move to the position of the previous segment in front of it, which is (4,2) in this case, so on the next move, the segment that was at (3,2) moves to (4,2), so cell (3,2) is left empty, and the new position is at (4,2) for that segment.\n\nAfter the move, the cell (3,2) is free, because the segment moved to (4,2).\n\nIn the above, after turn 73 move to (4,6), the segment that was at (3,2) moved to old position of index 5, which was (4,2), so now (3,2) is no longer occupied; it's free.\n\nSimilarly, in general, when the snake moves, the body segments shift, so the cell where a body segment was is vacated, and not occupied by another segment immediately, unless the head or something moves there, but in this case, for (3,2), after the move on turn 73, it is free.\n\nLet's confirm.\n\nAfter turn 72: positions include (3,2) at index 6.\n\nOn turn 73, when the head moves to a new cell, say (4,6), then the body segments move:\n- Segment that was at index 1 moves to index 0 position (4,5)\n- Segment that was at index 2 moves to index 1 position (3,5)\n- ...\n- Segment that was at index 6 moves to index 5 position (4,2)\n- Segment that was at index 7 moves to index 6 position (3,3)\n- etc.\n\nSo the segment that was at (3,2) (index 6) moves to (4,2) (old index 5 position).\n\nTherefore, after the move, the cell (3,2) is empty, and not occupied by any snake segment.\n\nSimilarly, if no food is eaten, the tail is removed, but the cell is freed.\n\nIn this case, after turn 73, (3,2) is free and has food, so it can be eaten if the head moves there.\n\nBut on turn 73, after move, head is at (4,6), far from (3,2).\n\nBut the food at (3,2) is now available.\n\nSimilarly, for any body cell, when the snake moves, that cell is vacated, so food under body can be eaten on the turn after the snake moves away, if head moves there.\n\nBut in this case, for (3,2), after turn 72 move, on turn 73, (3,2) is free with food.\n\nNow back to turn 72 actions.\n\nFor turn 72, I need to choose U or R.\n\nIf I go R to (4,5), then on turn 73, (3,2) is free, and I can potentially go to eat it.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), let's see what happens.\n\nIf turn 72 U to (3,6), positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n(3,2) at index 6.\n\nOn turn 73, if I move, say L to (2,6), then head to (2,6), which is tail, no food, so tail moves: new head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) and tail (2,5) removed? After move, no food, tail removed, so positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) but (2,5) was tail, removed, so new tail is (1,5) or something.\n\nPositions after move: new head (2,6), then old head (3,6) becomes body, old body index 1 (3,5), index 2 (3,4), ..., up to old body index 12 (2,5), but since no food, the last segment (2,5) is not included, so new positions: [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) ] tail (1,5)\n\n(3,2) is still occupied at index 7.\n\nThe segment at (3,2) moved to where? Old index 6 (3,2) moves to old index 5 position, which was (4,2), so after move, (3,2) is free? In this case, when moving to (2,6), the segment that was at (3,2) (old index 6) moves to the position of old index 5, which is (4,2), so cell (3,2) is vacated, and not occupied.\n\nIn the new positions, the cell (4,2) is occupied by that segment, but (3,2) is empty.\n\nYes, similar to before.\n\nSo in both cases, after any move on turn 72, when the snake moves, the cell that was under body at (3,2) is freed on turn 73, available for eating.\n\nBut to eat it, the head needs to move to (3,2) on turn 73 or later.\n\nNow, for turn 72, if I go R to (4,5), then on turn 73, head at (4,5), direction R.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), D to (4,4) but (4,4) occupied, or R to (5,5).\n\n(4,4) is occupied, so only U or R.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), which is left and down from (4,5).\n\nTo go to (3,2) from (4,5), I need to go left to (3,5) or down to (4,4), but (4,4) occupied, (3,5) is body, not free.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can only go to (4,6) or (5,5), both not towards (3,2).\n\nSo on turn 73, I cannot go directly to (3,2) from there.\n\nIf I go U to (4,6) on turn 73, head to (4,6), then from there I can go to other places.\n\nBut (3,2) is far.\n\nIf on turn 72 I go U to (3,6), then on turn 73 head at (3,6), I can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nFrom (3,6), to (3,2) is down, but I can't go down because direction U, and D opposite, not allowed.\n\nFrom (2,6) or (4,6), still not down.\n\nSo in both cases, from turn 73 position, I cannot immediately move towards (3,2) because of direction constraints and occupied cells.\n\nBut (3,2) has life span 8, so I have time, until turn 79.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) has life 5, until turn 76.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid and possible paths.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: the snake is quite long, 14 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nLet's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 6x6:\n\nRow y=6 (top): cells (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n\nBut (2,6) and (3,6) have snake, (4,6) free, etc.\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) with food at (6,5)\n\nSnake: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5) if not moved, but after turn 72, it changes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider moving towards (6,5) or (3,2).\n\nFirst, for (6,5): it's at (6,5), available until turn 76.\n\nFrom current (3,5), I can go R to (4,5) on turn 72, then from there, to (5,5) or (4,6), then to (6,5).\n\nFor example, turn 72: R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 73: from (4,5) direction R, can go R to (5,5) or U to (4,6)\n\nIf go R to (5,5), then head to (5,5), no food, tail moves, etc.\n\nThen from (5,5), direction R, can go U to (5,6), D to (5,4), R to (6,5)\n\n(6,5) has food, so I can go R to (6,5) on turn 74.\n\nTurn 72: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 73: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 74: move R to (6,5), eat food, snake grows.\n\nBut is (6,5) accessible? (6,5) is not wall, not obstacle, so yes.\n\nAlso, on turn 74, life span of (6,5) is 5 at turn 72, so on turn 74, after two turns, life span decreases to 3, still available.\n\nAt turn 72, life span 5, so available on turn 72,73,74,75,76.\n\nTurn 74 is fine.\n\nBut when I move to (6,5), I eat, so snake grows, no tail move.\n\nNow, after eating, head at (6,5), and direction R.\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's see if this path is possible.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (6,5) is R, fine.\n\nNow, from (4,5) to (5,5): (5,5) is free? Currently, at turn 72, after move to (4,5), positions: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) tail.\n\n(5,5) not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) free except for food.\n\nBut (6,5) has food, so when I move there, I eat it.\n\nNow, after eating at (6,5), snake length increases, head at (6,5), direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: from (6,5), direction R, so can go U to (6,6), D to (6,4), or R to (7,5) but x=7 wall, not possible.\n\nU to (6,6): (6,6) is top-right, free? Not wall, not obstacle, not occupied? After move, let's see.\n\nAfter turn 74, ate at (6,5), so new positions: head (6,5), then previous head (5,5), then body from turn 73: after turn 73, if moved to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), etc. up to tail.\n\nSince ate at (6,5), no tail move, so positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) and tail stays, so snake longer.\n\nNow from (6,5), direction R, can move U to (6,6), D to (6,4), or L but L opposite, not allowed.\n\n(6,4) is internal obstacle, blocked! (6,4) is wall.\n\n(6,6) is free.\n\nSo only U to (6,6) possible.\n\nThen move to (6,6), no food, so tail moves, etc.\n\nBut not critical now.\n\nBack to turn 72.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6) instead.\n\nTurn 72 U to (3,6)\n\nThen turn 73, from (3,6) direction U, can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6)\n\nSay go R to (4,6), then head to (4,6), no food, tail moves.\n\nThen from (4,6), direction R (since moved right), can go U to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5), R to (5,6), L to (3,6) body.\n\nU wall, L body, so only D or R.\n\nD to (4,5) or R to (5,6)\n\n(4,5) may be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 72 U to (3,6), positions: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nOn turn 73, go R to (4,6), then new positions: head (4,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail (2,6) removed.\n\n(4,5) is not occupied, free.\n\nSo from (4,6), can go D to (4,5) or R to (5,6)\n\nIf go to (4,5), then from there to (5,5) etc, to (6,5) later.\n\nBut to reach (6,5) from here, it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 73 at (4,6), go to (4,5) or (5,6).\n\nIf go to (4,5), then from (4,5) direction D (since moved down), can go L, R, D? Direction from moving down to (4,5), so direction D.\n\nCan move L to (3,5), R to (5,5), D to (4,4) but (4,4) occupied, U to (4,6) body.\n\nSo L or R.\n\n(3,5) occupied, so only R to (5,5).\n\nThen to (6,5) on next turn.\n\nSo same as before, but with an extra turn.\n\nIf on turn 72 I go U, then to reach (6,5) I need turn 72 U, turn 73 to (4,6) or (2,6), say (4,6), turn 74 to (4,5) or (5,6), if (4,5), turn 75 to (5,5), turn 76 to (6,5), but (6,5) life span 5, available until turn 76, so on turn 76 it is available, but after turn 76 it disappears, so on turn 76 I can eat it.\n\nLife span 5 at turn 72: available turn 72,73,74,75,76, disappears after turn 76.\n\nSo on turn 76, I can eat it.\n\nBut if I go via U first, I eat on turn 76.\n\nIf I go R on turn 72, I can eat on turn 74.\n\nSo better to go R to eat (6,5) sooner.\n\nMoreover, (3,2) is now free after turn 72 move, and I can plan to eat it later.\n\nBut if I go to (6,5), I might be far from (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) has long life, until turn 79.\n\nNow, for turn 72, going R to (4,5) seems better to get the food at (6,5) quickly.\n\nBut let's check risks.\n\nWhen I go to (6,5), after eating, I am at (6,5) with only one way out, to (6,6), which might be a dead end.\n\n(6,6) is corner, from there I can go down to (6,5) but occupied, or left to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut let's see the area.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,2) to consider.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nAnother option: after freeing (3,2), I can eat it.\n\nFor example, on turn 72, if I go R to (4,5), then on turn 73, (3,2) is free.\n\nBut from (4,5), I can only go to (4,6) or (5,5), not towards (3,2).\n\nIf I go to (5,5), then to (6,5), then to (6,6), etc.\n\nFrom there, to reach (3,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut with obstacles, like (2,4) blocked.\n\nPath from (6,6) to (3,2): for example, down to (6,5), but occupied, so to (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), but (5,4) not blocked, then to (5,3), (5,2), but (5,1) blocked, so to (4,2), (3,2) or something.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nSince (3,2) is free on turn 73, I can try to reach it from turn 73 position.\n\nBut from turn 73, if at (5,5) after some moves, it's far.\n\nIf on turn 72 I go U to (3,6), then on turn 73 (3,2) is free, and I am at (3,6) or (2,6) or (4,6).\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go to (2,6) or (4,6), then from there, I can move down.\n\nFor example, from (2,6), direction L (if moved left), can go L to (1,6), D to (2,5), or U wall, R to (3,6) body.\n\n(2,5) occupied, so only to (1,6).\n\nThen from (1,6) direction L, can go D to (1,5), L to (0,5) wall, U wall, R to (2,6) body.\n\n(1,5) is occupied by snake, so only down or something, but (1,5) occupied, so from (1,6) only to (1,5) if possible, but occupied, so stuck? (1,5) is occupied, so cannot move down.\n\nAfter turn 72 U to (3,6), positions include (1,5).\n\nOn turn 73, from (3,6) go L to (2,6), then positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and tail (2,5) removed, so tail (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is tail.\n\nFrom (2,6), direction L, can move L to (1,6), D to (2,5), U wall, R to (3,6) body.\n\n(2,5) is not occupied now? Positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), ..., (1,4), (1,5) tail.\n\nSo (2,5) is free? Not in positions, so free.\n\n(2,5) is not occupied, so I can move D to (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) free.\n\nSo from (2,6), can go L to (1,6) or D to (2,5).\n\nIf go D to (2,5), then head to (2,5), which is free, no food, so tail moves, etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,2), from (2,5), I can go down to (2,4) but (2,4) blocked, so not possible.\n\nGo left to (1,5) or down to (2,4) blocked, or right to (3,5), etc.\n\n(1,5) is tail, so can move to it.\n\nBut (2,4) blocked, so no direct down.\n\nFrom (2,5), can go to (1,5) or (3,5) or (2,6) but occupied.\n\n(3,5) occupied, (2,6) body, so only to (1,5) if tail, but (1,5) is tail, so moving to (1,5) is possible.\n\nBut not towards (3,2).\n\nSo it seems difficult to reach (3,2) quickly from the top.\n\nBut since it has long life, I can go for (6,5) first.\n\nMoreover, (6,5) has shorter life, so prioritize eating it before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is gone soon, but we can't reach it.\n\nSo for turn 72, I think R to (4,5) is better to approach (6,5).\n\nThen for turn 73, from (4,5) direction R, I should go R to (5,5) to get closer to (6,5).\n\nThen turn 74, R to (6,5) to eat.\n\nAfter that, at (6,5), direction R, only can go U to (6,6).\n\nThen on turn 75, from (6,6) direction U (since moved up to (6,6)? From (6,5) to (6,6) is U, so direction U.\n\nThen from (6,6), can go L to (5,6), D to (6,5) but occupied, U wall, R wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nThen from (5,6), direction L, can go L to (4,6), D to (5,5), U wall, R to (6,6) body.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, about (3,2): it is free on turn 73, and has life until turn 79, so I can plan to eat it later.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,5), I can head towards (3,2).\n\nBut with the snake longer, it might be tight.\n\nAnother risk: the tail reward danger, but not relevant now.\n\nAlso, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I don't know how many, but probably a few turns.\n\nThe instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many, so perhaps for the immediate future.\n\nSince it's to maximize score, and avoid risks, I should plan to eat available food.\n\nIn this case, for turn 72, I choose R to (4,5).\n\nThen for turn 73, from (4,5), go R to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 74, go R to (6,5) to eat.\n\nThen turn 75, from (6,5) direction R, go U to (6,6).\n\nThen turn 76, from (6,6) direction U, go L to (5,6).\n\nThen I can continue, but (3,2) is there.\n\nBut let's see the grid after these moves.\n\nAfter turn 74, ate at (6,5), snake positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) and since ate, no tail move, so tail is (2,6)? Positions: after eating at (6,5), head (6,5), previous positions: before move, on turn 73, if at (5,5), positions: let's track.\n\nTurn 72: move R to (4,5), positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] tail (2,6)\n\n(3,2) is free after this move, but we don't eat it yet.\n\nTurn 73: move R to (5,5), no food, so tail moves: new head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)? (3,2) is free, not occupied. After turn 72 move, (3,2) is free, so not in snake.\n\nAfter turn 72 move to (4,5), positions do not include (3,2), as it was vacated.\n\nSnake positions after turn 72: [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and then the next was (3,2) but it moved to (4,2)? No.\n\nAfter turn 72 move to (4,5), the positions are: head (4,5), then the previous head (3,5), previous body index 1 (3,4), index 2 (4,4), index 3 (4,3), index 4 (4,2), and then index 5 was (3,2) but since we moved, the segment that was at (3,2) moved to the position of index 4, which was (4,2), so (4,2) is occupied, but (3,2) is not occupied.\n\nThen the next segments: index 6 was (3,3), now at position of index 5, so (3,3) but the position is the cell.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5)\n\nBody: old head (3,5) -> new index 1: (3,5)\n\nOld body index 1 (3,4) -> new index 2: (3,4)\n\nOld body index 2 (4,4) -> new index 3: (4,4)\n\nOld body index 3 (4,3) -> new index 4: (4,3)\n\nOld body index 4 (4,2) -> new index 5: (4,2)\n\nOld body index 5 (3,2) -> but it moves to position of old index 4, which is (4,2), but (4,2) is already the position, so the segment moves to (4,2), but old index 4 was at (4,2), so it stays? Confusion.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nFor body segment i, it moves to the position that was occupied by segment i-1.\n\nFor example, after head moves to (4,5):\n\n- The segment that was at body index 1 (position (3,5)) moves to the head position (3,5)? No.\n\nPositions before move: head (3,5), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6) but we moved from (3,5) to (4,5).\n\nAfter move to (4,5):\n\n- New head: (4,5)\n\n- New body index 1: old head position (3,5)\n\n- New body index 2: old body index 1 position (3,4)\n\n- New body index 3: old body index 2 position (4,4)\n\n- New body index 4: old body index 3 position (4,3)\n\n- New body index 5: old body index 4 position (4,2)\n\n- New body index 6: old body index 5 position (3,2) but old body index 5 was at (3,2), so new body index 6 at (3,2)? No.\n\nOld body index 5 was at (3,2), but it moves to the position of old body index 4, which is (4,2).\n\nSo new body index 6 is at (4,2)? Let's list:\n\nNew body positions:\n\n- Index 1: position of old head (3,5)\n\n- Index 2: position of old body index 1 (3,4)\n\n- Index 3: position of old body index 2 (4,4)\n\n- Index 4: position of old body index 3 (4,3)\n\n- Index 5: position of old body index 4 (4,2)\n\n- Index 6: position of old body index 5 (3,2) so at (3,2)\n\n- Index 7: position of old body index 6 (3,3)\n\n- Index 8: position of old body index 7 (2,3)\n\n- Index 9: position of old body index 8 (1,3)\n\n- Index 10: position of old body index 9 (1,4)\n\n- Index 11: position of old body index 10 (1,5)\n\n- Index 12: position of old body index 11 (2,5)\n\n- Index 13: position of old body index 12 (2,6)\n\nAnd old tail (3,6) is not included since no food, tail removed.\n\nSo positions after turn 72 move: head (4,5), body: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) so (3,2) is still occupied at index 6.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the body segments shift, so the cell (3,2) is still occupied by the same segment or moved, but the cell is not vacated immediately; it is only when the segment moves away that it is free.\n\nIn this case, after turn 72 move, the segment at (3,2) is still there, at position index 6.\n\nIt will move on the next turn when the snake moves again.\n\nOn turn 73, when head moves, then the segment at (3,2) will move to the position of index 5, which is (4,2), so after turn 73 move, (3,2) is free.\n\nYes, so for (3,2) to be free, it takes one move after the turn it was under body, but since it was under body on turn 72, after turn 72 move, it is still under body, but after turn 73 move, it is free.\n\nOn turn 73, after the move, (3,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly, in general, food under body is free on the turn after the snake moves.\n\nFor turn 72, (3,2) is occupied, after turn 72 move, it is still occupied, after turn 73 move, it is free.\n\nSo to eat on turn 73, impossible, on turn 74 or later.\n\nFor (3,2), available from turn 74 to 79.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nFor turn 72, I think going R to (4,5) is good to target (6,5).\n\nThen turn 73: from (4,5) direction R, go R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 74: from (5,5) direction R, go R to (6,5) to eat.\n\nThen turn 75: from (6,5) direction R, go U to (6,6)\n\nTurn 76: from (6,6) direction U, go L to (5,6)\n\nThen from (5,6) direction L, I can go L to (4,6) or D to (5,5)\n\n(5,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter eating at (6,5) on turn 74, positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) and since ate, tail not moved, so all positions, snake longer.\n\n(3,2) is still occupied.\n\nOn turn 75, move U to (6,6), no food, so tail moves: tail (2,6) removed, new positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail (2,5)\n\n(3,2) occupied.\n\nOn turn 76, move L to (5,6), no food, tail moves, etc.\n\nBut (3,2) will be free later.\n\nTo eat (3,2), I need to go to it.\n\nFrom current position, say at (5,6), I can go to (4,6), then to (3,6), but (3,6) may be free, then down to (3,5), but occupied, etc.\n\nIt will take time.\n\nSince (3,2) has long life, and the grid is small, I can go for it after (6,5).\n\nFor the immediate actions, I'll go with the plan to eat (6,5).\n\nSo for turn 72: R\n\nTurn 73: R (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 74: R (to (6,5))\n\nThen for turn 75: U (to (6,6))\n\nTurn 76: L (to (5,6))\n\nBut the food at (1,1) is gone, no issue.\n\nI think this is reasonable.\n\nThe answer should be in the boxed format.\n\nAlso, head direction after each move, but I think it's implied.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 72: R\n\nTurn 73: R\n\nTurn 74: R\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: L\n\nBut I can stop here or continue, but for 5 turns, from 72 to 76.\n\nTurn 72,73,74,75,76 is 5 actions.\n\nSince turn 76 is included.\n\nNow, to confirm, on turn 74, when I move to (6,5), I eat the food, which is good.\n\nAnd I avoid risks; no collision in this path.\n\n(4,5) to (5,5) to (6,5) all free.\n\nAfter that, to (6,6) free, to (5,6) free.\n\nThen from there, I can think further, but for the answer, this should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating (3,2) first, but it requires more moves to free it and reach it.\n\nFor example, if on turn 72 I go U to (3,6), then turn 73 go to (2,6) or (4,6), then from there, I need to go down to reach (3,2), but it takes more turns, and (6,5) might expire if I delay.\n\n(6,5) life 5, so I have until turn 76, but from (3,6), to (6,5) takes about 3 turns as before, so I can eat on turn 75 or 76, but with U first, it might be later.\n\nWith R first, I eat on turn 74.\n\nSo better to go R.\n\nI think R is better.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (6,5) before it disappears (life span 5, available until turn 76), as it is the most immediately accessible high-reward target with the shortest remaining life among reachable food. The food at (1,1) is ignored because it disappears after turn 73 and is unreachable within the time frame due to obstacles and distance. The food at (3,2) has a longer life span (until turn 79) and can be targeted later after the snake frees the cell and maneuvers toward it.\n\nThe current state (turn 72) has the snake head at (3,5) with direction U (up). Possible moves are U (to (3,6)) or R (to (4,5)), as L (to (2,5)) causes a body collision and D is invalid (instant reverse). Moving R to (4,5) is chosen to start the path toward (6,5), as it is more efficient than moving U, which would delay reaching (6,5).\n\n### Planned Actions (5+ Turns Ahead)\n- **Turn 72**: Move R to (4,5). This avoids collisions and positions the snake closer to (6,5). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 73**: From (4,5), direction R, move R to (5,5). This continues the path to (6,5), with (5,5) being free and safe. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 74**: From (5,5), direction R, move R to (6,5). This eats the food (+1 score, snake grows by 1 segment). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 75**: From (6,5), direction R, move U to (6,6). This avoids walls (R to (7,5) is invalid) and obstacles (D to (6,4) is blocked). (6,6) is free. Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 76**: From (6,6), direction U, move L to (5,6). This avoids walls (U and R invalid) and body collisions. (5,6) is free. Direction becomes L.\n- **Beyond (for survival and targeting (3,2))**: After turn 76, the snake should head toward (3,2) to eat it before turn 79. A safe path could involve moving down and left (e.g., to (5,5) or (4,6), then toward (3,2)), avoiding obstacles like (2,4). Since (3,2) was under the body and freed after turn 73, it is now eatable if the head moves onto it.\n\nThis plan eats (6,5) efficiently (by turn 74) and sets up for future food collection while minimizing risk. No negative food is present, and all moves avoid collisions, walls, and instant reverses. The snake length increases to 15 after eating (6,5), improving the ability to reach (3,2) later.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 72: R (right)\nTurn 73: R (right)\nTurn 74: R (right)\nTurn 75: U (up)\nTurn 76: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 73.\n\n**Walls**: The borders are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I should mark these as blocked cells.\n\n**Snake Positions**: The snake is a list of segments, with the head at (4,5). The positions are: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]. That's 14 segments. The head is at (4,5) and the tail is at (2,6).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Current direction is R, which is right. So moving to the east.\n\n**Food Items**:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 1. So it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current. Since turn is 73, life span 1 means it will disappear after turn 73 if not eaten now.\n\n- (6,5) with value 1 and life span 4. So it will disappear after turn 76 (since life span decreases each turn: turn 73,74,75,76 – gone after 76).\n\n- (3,2) with value 1 and life span 7. Disappears after turn 79.\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 10. Disappears after turn 82.\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to plan the next moves, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a 8x8 grid.\n\nGrid coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: from head to tail:\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (3,2)  // this is a body segment\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- Tail: (2,6)\n\nFood at:\n\n- (1,1) – life span 1, must eat now or lose it\n\n- (6,5) – life span 4\n\n- (3,2) – life span 7\n\n- (2,6) – life span 10\n\n(2,6) is the tail position. There's food at (2,6), but the tail is currently there. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n\nSpecifically for (2,6): since it's the tail, when the snake moves, the tail will move, so if the snake moves such that the tail leaves (2,6), and then later the head can move to (2,6) to eat the food, but only if the food is still there.\n\nBut (2,6) has life span 10, so it might last long enough.\n\nCurrent head direction is R (right), so from (4,5), moving right would go to (5,5).\n\nPossible moves from head position (4,5):\n\n- Up (U): (4,6)\n\n- Down (D): (4,4) but (4,4) is occupied by a body segment? Let's see the positions: (4,4) is the fourth segment. Snake positions: index 0: (4,5) head, index 1: (3,5), index 2: (3,4), index 3: (4,4), so (4,4) is a body segment. Similarly, (4,3), (4,2), etc.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,6) – is this free? y=6, x=4. Check walls: y=7 is wall, but y=6 is not border, and not internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2) – none at (4,6). Snake body: positions include (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6). So (4,6) is not occupied, I think. (2,6) is tail, but not (4,6). So (4,6) should be free.\n\n- D: (4,4) – but (4,4) is occupied by snake body, segment at index 3. So cannot move there, collision.\n\n- L: (3,5) – (3,5) is the second segment, index 1. Occupied, collision.\n\n- R: (5,5) – is this free? Walls: x=5,y=5, not border (x=0,7 y=0,7 borders), not internal obstacle. Snake: no one at (5,5)? Positions: from list, all are covered, (5,5) not in list, so free.\n\nSo from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6) or R to (5,5). Cannot go D or L because body is there.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so if I move L, that would be opposite, but L is not possible anyway since body is there. But for next moves, I need to avoid instant reverse.\n\nNow, I need to think about food.\n\nFirst, food at (1,1) has life span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So if I want to eat it, I must be at (1,1) at turn 73.\n\nBut head is at (4,5), which is 3 steps away horizontally and 4 vertically, so Manhattan distance 7. I can't reach (1,1) in one move. So impossible to eat it this turn. Therefore, (1,1) will disappear after this turn, uneaten. So I can ignore it.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. At turn 73, it has life span 1, so after turn 73, it's gone. Since I can't be at (1,1) at turn 73, I can't eat it. So yes, ignore.\n\nNext, food at (6,5) with life span 4. So it will be available until turn 76, meaning I can eat it on turns 73,74,75,76. After turn 76, gone.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life span 7, available until turn 79.\n\n(2,6) life span 10, until turn 82.\n\n(2,6) is the current tail position. When the snake moves, the tail will move, so if I move, the tail leaves (2,6), and then (2,6) might be free for food, but the food is already there, under the tail? The food is at (2,6), and tail is there, so it's spawned under the body.\n\nTo eat it, I need the body to move away, then head to move there.\n\nBut since it's the tail, when the snake moves, the tail will move to the next position, leaving (2,6) empty, and then if the food is still there, I can go back to eat it later.\n\nBut (2,6) has food with value +1, so eating it would increase length by 1.\n\nBut there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (2,6), and food is there. If the head is adjacent to (2,6) and moves to eat it, after eating, the tail grows, so the new tail would be where the head was, but since head was adjacent, it might cause collision.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nWhen you eat food, the tail doesn't move; the snake grows, so a new segment is added where the tail was, but since you're eating, the tail stays in place, effectively growing.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nBut in this case, the food is under the tail? Confusing.\n\nThe rule says: food can spawn under body, including tail.\n\nWhen you move, if the head moves to a food cell, you eat it and grow.\n\nBut if the food is under the tail, to eat it, you need the tail to move away first, so that the cell is empty, then head moves to it.\n\nBut when the tail moves away, the food is revealed, and head can move there later.\n\nNow, specifically for tail: if head is adjacent to the tail position, and there is food on the tail position, if head moves to that cell to eat, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and the new segment is added where the tail was, but since head moved to the tail cell, and tail was there, now head is on that cell, and the new tail is added, but the previous tail segment might cause collision or something.\n\nI think the danger is that if the head is adjacent to the tail cell and eats the food there, immediately after eating, the head is on the food cell, and the tail grows, so the segment that was the tail is now the second last, and the new tail is added, but since head moved to the tail cell, the new position might have the head adjacent to the body.\n\nPerhaps an example: suppose tail is at T, head is adjacent to T, say at H, and there is food at T. If head moves from H to T, it eats the food. Now, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added at T. But T was the tail, now head is at T, and the new segment is added at T, but since head is now at T, and T was occupied, but after move, head is at T, and the body includes the previous segments.\n\nLet's think of the positions.\n\nBefore move: head at H, tail at T, and T has food.\n\nAfter move: head moves to T, eats food, so the snake grows. The new head position is T, and the tail remains at T for that turn? No.\n\nIn standard snake mechanics: when you move, all segments shift; the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, and the tail segment is removed unless you eat food.\n\nIf you eat food, the tail segment is not removed; it stays, so a new segment is added.\n\nSo positions: before move, snake: ... , H, T  (H is head, T is tail)\n\nIf head moves to a free cell, not food, then new head is new position, each segment shifts, tail position is vacated.\n\nIf head moves to food, then new head is food position, segments shift, but tail position is not vacated; instead, the tail stays and a new segment is added, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, when food is under tail: at turn t, tail is at T with food.\n\nAfter move: if head does not move to T, then tail moves to new position, leaving T, so food at T is now exposed.\n\nIf head moves to T, but head can only move to T if it is adjacent.\n\nSuppose at time t, positions: segment before tail is S, tail at T. Food at T.\n\nIf head is at H adjacent to T.\n\nIf head moves to T: it moves to T, eats food. Now, the snake grows: the new head is at T, the segment that was S moves to where T was? Let's index.\n\nPositions: let's say indices: ... , P (prev), T (tail)\n\nHead is at H, which is not part of this, but H is head, separate.\n\nFull snake: positions list: [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] where T is tail.\n\nIf head moves to a new cell, say new head position N.\n\nIf N is not food, then new positions: [N, H, B1, ..., Bk] and tail Bk is removed? No.\n\nStandard: the head moves to N, then the segment that was at H moves to N? No.\n\nIn snake, when moving, the head moves to the new cell, then each subsequent segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo, new head position: N.\n\nThen the first body segment moves to where head was.\n\nSecond body segment moves to where first body was, and so on.\n\nThe tail segment moves to where the second last segment was, and the old tail position is vacated.\n\nIf N has food, then after moving, the snake grows, so the tail does not vacate; instead, the old tail position remains occupied, and a new segment is added there? No.\n\nWhen you eat food, during the move, the tail is not removed; the snake increases in length by keeping the tail in place or adding a segment.\n\nCommon implementation: when head moves to food, the tail does not move; so the head moves to food, the body segments shift, but the tail stays, so the length increases by one.\n\nFor example, positions: [H, B1, B2, T]\n\nHead moves to food at F.\n\nIf F is adjacent and free.\n\nAfter move: new positions [F, H, B1, B2] and T is still there? No.\n\nIf head moves to F, then the new head is F, the segment that was H is now at F? Let's think.\n\nInitial: head at H, body at B1, B2, tail at T.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new position N.\n\nIf N is not food, new positions: head at N, then body: H, then B1, then B2, and tail is B2, T is vacated.\n\nIf N has food, then after move, new positions: head at N, body: H, B1, B2, and T remains, so now tail is T, and length increased. T is still there.\n\nIn this case, the cell T is not vacated; it remains occupied by the tail.\n\nFor food under tail: at time t, tail at T with food.\n\nAfter move, if head does not move to T, then tail moves to new position, say T_new, and T is vacated, so food at T is now on a free cell.\n\nIf head moves to T, which requires head adjacent to T.\n\nThen, head moves to T, eats food. Since food eaten, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; it stays at T. But head is now at T, so it's like the head and tail are on the same cell, which is invalid or causes collision.\n\nThe rule says: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nAfter eating, the head is at T, and the tail is still at T, so head and tail on same cell, which is a collision.\n\nTherefore, it's deadly to eat the food when it's on the tail cell if the head is adjacent.\n\nIf head is not adjacent, it's safe to move to that cell later after the tail moves away.\n\nIn this state, food at (2,6) which is the tail. Head is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to (2,6). Distance: |4-2| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3, not adjacent. Adjacent would be one step away: up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (2,6): not adjacent; (3,5) is adjacent to (2,6)? (3,5) and (2,6) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing side, so (3,5) and (2,5) would be adjacent left, or (3,5) and (3,6) up, but (2,6) is diagonal? No, adjacent means same row or column, differ by 1 in one coordinate.\n\n(4,5) and (3,5) are adjacent, (4,5) and (4,6), etc.\n\n(2,6) is at x=2,y=6. Adjacent cells: (1,6), (3,6), (2,5), (2,7) but y=7 is wall, so (2,5), (1,6), (3,6).\n\nNow, snake head at (4,5), not adjacent to (2,6). The segment at (2,5) is part of snake, (2,5) is index 12 in positions: positions: 0:(4,5),1:(3,5),2:(3,4),3:(4,4),4:(4,3),5:(4,2),6:(3,2),7:(3,3),8:(2,3),9:(1,3),10:(1,4),11:(1,5),12:(2,5),13:(2,6) tail.\n\n(2,5) is adjacent to (2,6), but (2,5) is not head; head is at (4,5).\n\nSo head is not adjacent to tail at (2,6). Therefore, no immediate danger.\n\nTo eat food at (2,6), I need to have the tail move away first, then head move there later.\n\nSince life span is 10, I have time.\n\nNow, back to possible moves from (4,5): U to (4,6) or R to (5,5).\n\nCurrent direction is R, so if I move L, it would be reverse, but L is not possible anyway.\n\nFor turn 73, I need to choose between U or R.\n\nI should think about which food to target and plan a path.\n\nFirst, let's list all food:\n\n- (6,5): life span 4, so must eat by turn 76. Distance from head: from (4,5) to (6,5), |4-6| + |5-5| = 2, so 2 steps away. Can reach in 2 turns if no obstacles.\n\n- (3,2): life span 7, eat by turn 79. From (4,5) to (3,2), |4-3| + |5-2| =1+3=4, 4 steps away.\n\n- (2,6): life span 10, eat by turn 82. From (4,5) to (2,6), |4-2| + |5-6| =2+1=3, 3 steps, but it's under tail now, so need to wait for tail to move.\n\nAlso, (3,2) is a food position, but is it occupied? (3,2) is in snake positions, index 6: (3,2). So food at (3,2) is under a body segment, not tail.\n\nTo eat it, I need that segment to move away, then head to move there.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFood at (6,5) is free, not occupied.\n\n(3,2) is occupied by body.\n\n(2,6) occupied by tail.\n\n(1,1) is free but will disappear.\n\nFor (6,5), I can potentially eat it soon.\n\nLet me simulate the grid.\n\nI'll make a grid representation.\n\nGrid size 8x8, but walls on borders, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so cells from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so these cells are invalid.\n\nPlayable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but some internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo blocked cells: all border cells + these.\n\nNow snake occupies: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nFood at: (1,1), (6,5), (3,2), (2,6)\n\nBut (3,2) and (2,6) are occupied, (1,1) and (6,5) free.\n\n(1,1) will disappear after this turn, so not reachable.\n\nSo immediate target could be (6,5).\n\nFrom head (4,5), to (6,5), I can go right to (5,5), then to (6,5).\n\n(5,5) is free? Let's check: not wall, not obstacle, not snake. Snake positions no (5,5), so free.\n\n(6,5): not wall, not obstacle, free except food is there.\n\nBut (6,5) is not occupied by snake, so I can move there.\n\nIf I go R to (5,5) on turn 73, then on turn 74 I can go R to (6,5) and eat it.\n\nBut I need to check if that is safe.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows.\n\nBut first, let's see the path.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (5,5) is R.\n\nThen to (6,5) is R again.\n\nBut current direction is R, so moving R is fine, not reverse.\n\nNow, what about other options? I could go U to (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is free? Walls: not border, not internal obstacle. Snake: no, so free.\n\nIf I go U, to (4,6), then I can go to other places.\n\nBut (6,5) has short life span, only 4 turns, so I should eat it soon.\n\nLife span 4 means it disappears after turn 76, so I can eat it on turn 73,74,75, or 76.\n\nTurn 73: if I move to (6,5) now? No, from (4,5) to (6,5) is two steps, so earliest turn 74.\n\nIf I go R on turn 73 to (5,5), then on turn 74 to (6,5).\n\nI could go other ways, but that seems direct.\n\nBut I need to think about after eating, or other risks.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,2) and (2,6) are available longer.\n\nBut (6,5) might be low hanging fruit.\n\nNow, let's see the snake body to avoid collisions.\n\nAfter moving, the snake will shift.\n\nFor example, if I move R to (5,5) on turn 73.\n\nThen new head position (5,5), and the body: the segment at (4,5) moves to where? After move, head was at (4,5), moves to (5,5), so new head (5,5).\n\nThen the first body segment (3,5) moves to (4,5).\n\nSecond body (3,4) moves to (3,5)? Positions: index 0 head (4,5), after move to (5,5), so new position 0: (5,5)\n\nThen position 1: the old head (4,5) becomes body, so (4,5) now body.\n\nPosition 2: old position 1 (3,5) moves to where position 0 was, but it's not; the segments shift: the segment that was at index 1 moves to the new position 1, which is where the old head was? Standard: the head moves to new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo, new positions: head at new position N.\n\nThen body segment 1 moves to old head position.\n\nBody segment 2 moves to old body segment 1 position.\n\n...\n\nTail segment moves to old second last position.\n\nIn this case, positions before move: [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ]\n\nAfter move R to (5,5):\n\nNew head at (5,5)\n\nThen:\n\n- Body 1: old head (4,5)\n\n- Body 2: old body 1 (3,5)\n\n- Body 3: old body 2 (3,4)\n\n- Body 4: old body 3 (4,4)\n\n- Body 5: old body 4 (4,3)\n\n- Body 6: old body 5 (4,2)\n\n- Body 7: old body 6 (3,2)\n\n- Body 8: old body 7 (3,3)\n\n- Body 9: old body 8 (2,3)\n\n- Body 10: old body 9 (1,3)\n\n- Body 11: old body 10 (1,4)\n\n- Body 12: old body 11 (1,5)\n\n- Body 13: old body 12 (2,5)  // this was (2,5), now moves to where old body 11 was? Let's index properly.\n\nLet S be the list: S0 = (4,5), S1 = (3,5), S2 = (3,4), S3 = (4,4), S4 = (4,3), S5 = (4,2), S6 = (3,2), S7 = (3,3), S8 = (2,3), S9 = (1,3), S10 = (1,4), S11 = (1,5), S12 = (2,5), S13 = (2,6) tail.\n\nAfter move, new head at (5,5) = N.\n\nThen new position 0: N = (5,5)\n\nPosition 1: S0 = (4,5)  // old head\n\nPosition 2: S1 = (3,5)  // old body1\n\nPosition 3: S2 = (3,4)\n\nPosition 4: S3 = (4,4)\n\nPosition 5: S4 = (4,3)\n\nPosition 6: S5 = (4,2)\n\nPosition 7: S6 = (3,2)\n\nPosition 8: S7 = (3,3)\n\nPosition 9: S8 = (2,3)\n\nPosition 10: S9 = (1,3)\n\nPosition 11: S10 = (1,4)\n\nPosition 12: S11 = (1,5)\n\nPosition 13: S12 = (2,5)  // old second last\n\nThe tail was S13, but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so new tail is position 13: (2,5)\n\nOld tail (2,6) is vacated.\n\nNow, food at (2,6) is now exposed since tail moved away.\n\nSimilarly, other body segments: for example, food at (3,2) was under S6, which is now at position 7: (3,2) in new positions? After move, position 7 is S6 which was (3,2), so (3,2) is still occupied by body, since S6 moved to new position, but the cell (3,2) is now occupied by the segment that was at S6, which is still there unless it moved.\n\nIn the shift, S6 was at (3,2), and it moves to where S5 was? From above: new position 7 is S6 = (3,2), but S6 was at (3,2), and it doesn't move to a new cell; each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nS6 was at (3,2), after move, the segment that was S6 is now at new position, which is the position of old S5? Let's think per cell.\n\nBefore move, cell (3,2) has segment S6.\n\nAfter move, S6 moves to the position that was occupied by S5, which is (4,2)? S5 was at (4,2), so S6 moves to (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, S5 was at (4,2), moves to where S4 was, (4,3)? S4 at (4,3).\n\nFrom the new positions list:\n\nNew pos 0: (5,5)  // new head\n\nNew pos 1: S0 = (4,5)  // this segment moved from (4,5) to (4,5)? No, the segment that was at S0 is now at new position 1, which is (4,5), but (4,5) is the same cell, but the segment is different.\n\nThe cell (4,5) now has the segment that was the head, but now it's body.\n\nThe segment that was at S1 (3,5) is now at new position 2, which is (3,5)? No.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Cell (5,5) has new head, was empty.\n\n- Cell (4,5) has the segment that was S0 (head), now body\n\n- Cell (3,5) has the segment that was S1, now at new pos 2\n\n- Cell (3,4) has segment that was S2, at new pos 3\n\n- Cell (4,4) has segment that was S3, at new pos 4\n\n- Cell (4,3) has segment that was S4, at new pos 5\n\n- Cell (4,2) has segment that was S5, at new pos 6\n\n- Cell (3,2) has segment that was S6, at new pos 7? S6 was at (3,2), and new pos 7 is S6, but where is it?\n\nS6 was at (3,2), and it moves to the position of old S5, which is (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, S5 was at (4,2), moves to where S4 was, (4,3)\n\nS4 was at (4,3), moves to where S3 was, (4,4)\n\nS3 was at (4,4), moves to where S2 was, (3,4)\n\nS2 was at (3,4), moves to where S1 was, (3,5)\n\nS1 was at (3,5), moves to where S0 was, (4,5)\n\nS0 was at (4,5), moved to (5,5)\n\nThen S7 was at (3,3), moves to where S6 was, (3,2)\n\nS8 was at (2,3), moves to where S7 was, (3,3)\n\nS9 was at (1,3), moves to where S8 was, (2,3)\n\nS10 was at (1,4), moves to where S9 was, (1,3)\n\nS11 was at (1,5), moves to where S10 was, (1,4)\n\nS12 was at (2,5), moves to where S11 was, (1,5)\n\nS13 was at (2,6), but since no food, tail is removed, so S13 is gone, cell (2,6) vacated.\n\nSo after move to (5,5), new positions:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Body: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)  // 13 segments? Original 14, but tail removed, so 13 segments? Positions: 0 to 13 original 14 segments, after move, new list has 13 positions because tail removed.\n\nNew positions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ]? New tail at (2,5)\n\nNumber of segments: original 14, after one move without eating, length 13, positions from 0 to 12, 13 segments? Index from 0 to 12.\n\nLet's count: new head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — that's 14 positions? No.\n\nOriginal positions: 14 segments.\n\nAfter move: head to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the tail position is vacated, so the new snake has the same number of segments, but the last one is removed.\n\nFor example, 4 segments: head, body1, body2, tail.\n\nHead moves to N, body1 moves to head old, body2 moves to body1 old, tail removed, so new snake: N, old head, old body1 — 3 segments.\n\nSimilarly here, original 14 segments, after move no eat, new snake has 13 segments: new head, then old head, old body1, ..., old body12 (which was the second last).\n\nIn indices, new: [N, S0, S1, S2, ..., S12]\n\nS13 is removed.\n\nS12 was (2,5), S13 was (2,6).\n\nSo new positions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) ] — this is 14 positions, but (2,5) is both S12 and new tail.\n\nNew list: position 0: (5,5) new head\n\nPosition 1: S0 = (4,5)\n\nPosition 2: S1 = (3,5)\n\nPosition 3: S2 = (3,4)\n\nPosition 4: S3 = (4,4)\n\nPosition 5: S4 = (4,3)\n\nPosition 6: S5 = (4,2)\n\nPosition 7: S6 = (3,2)\n\nPosition 8: S7 = (3,3)\n\nPosition 9: S8 = (2,3)\n\nPosition 10: S9 = (1,3)\n\nPosition 11: S10 = (1,4)\n\nPosition 12: S11 = (1,5)\n\nPosition 13: S12 = (2,5) new tail\n\nSo 14 segments? S12 was (2,5), which is now position 13, tail.\n\nBut original had S13 at (2,6), which is gone.\n\nSo new snake has positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — 14 positions, but length should be 13? I think I confused.\n\nOriginal: 14 segments.\n\nAfter move: the head moves to a new cell, so one new cell occupied, and the tail cell is vacated, so net change, but the number of segments remains the same only if no growth; when no eat, the snake moves, so the head occupies a new cell, the tail leaves a cell, so length same.\n\nNumber of segments constant when not eating.\n\nWhen eating, length increases by one.\n\nHere, not eating, so still 14 segments, but the positions shift.\n\nIn new list, 14 positions.\n\nFor example, from above, new head (5,5), new tail (2,5).\n\nOld tail (2,6) vacated.\n\nFood at (2,6) is now free.\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,2) was under S6, which was at (3,2), but after move, S6 moved to (4,2)? From above, new position 7 is (3,2), but that is S7? New position 7 is S6 = (3,2), but S6 was at (3,2), and it moved to new position.\n\nIn new positions, position 7 is (3,2), occupied by the segment that was S6.\n\nBut S6 was at (3,2) before, and after move, it is still at (3,2)? From the shift: S6 moves to where S5 was.\n\nS5 was at (4,2), so S6 moves to (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, S7 was at (3,3), moves to where S6 was, (3,2).\n\nSo cell (3,2) now has the segment that was S7, which is at new position 8? New position 8 is S7 = (3,3)? Let's list the new occupied cells.\n\nAfter move R to (5,5):\n\n- Head to (5,5)\n\n- S0 to (4,5)  // old head position\n\n- S1 to (3,5)  // S1 was at (3,5), moves to where S0 was, (4,5)? No.\n\nThe segment at S1 moves to the position that was occupied by S0.\n\nS0 was at (4,5), so S1 moves to (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is now occupied by S0? Messy.\n\nIt's better to think that each segment inherits the position of the previous one.\n\nNew head at N.\n\nThen the body at index 1 is at old head position.\n\nBody at index 2 is at old body1 position.\n\nBody at index 3 is at old body2 position.\n\n...\n\nBody at index k is at old body{k-1} position for k>1.\n\nIn this case, for body index 1: at old head position (4,5)\n\nBody index 2: at old body1 position (3,5)\n\nBody index 3: at old body2 position (3,4)\n\nBody index 4: at old body3 position (4,4)\n\nBody index 5: at old body4 position (4,3)\n\nBody index 6: at old body5 position (4,2)\n\nBody index 7: at old body6 position (3,2)  // S6 was at (3,2), so body7 at (3,2)\n\nBody index 8: at old body7 position (3,3)  // S7 at (3,3)\n\nBody index 9: at old body8 position (2,3)  // S8 at (2,3)\n\nBody index 10: at old body9 position (1,3)  // S9 at (1,3)\n\nBody index 11: at old body10 position (1,4)  // S10 at (1,4)\n\nBody index 12: at old body11 position (1,5)  // S11 at (1,5)\n\nBody index 13: at old body12 position (2,5)  // S12 at (2,5)\n\nAnd old body13 (tail) at (2,6) is gone.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,5), body1 (4,5), body2 (3,5), body3 (3,4), body4 (4,4), body5 (4,3), body6 (4,2), body7 (3,2), body8 (3,3), body9 (2,3), body10 (1,3), body11 (1,4), body12 (1,5), body13 (2,5) tail.\n\nSo (3,2) is still occupied, by body7.\n\nFood at (3,2) is still under body, but now at a different segment.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is now free with food.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nFor turn 73, from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6) or R to (5,5).\n\nIf I go R to (5,5), then on turn 74, head at (5,5), I can go R to (6,5) to eat the food there.\n\n(6,5) is not wall, not obstacle, not occupied, so I can move there.\n\nAfter eating, the snake will grow, so length increases.\n\nBut that seems straightforward.\n\nIf I go U to (4,6) on turn 73, then head at (4,6), which is closer to the top, but (6,5) is at bottom, so I might not reach it in time.\n\nLife span of (6,5) is 4, so after turn 73, it will have life span 3 left, so can be eaten on 74,75,76.\n\nIf I go U on 73, to (4,6), then from there I can go to (5,6) or (4,7) but y=7 wall, so (4,7) invalid, or (3,6), etc.\n\nBut (6,5) is at (6,5), which is not far, but I need to go down and right.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (6,5), I can go R to (5,6) then D to (5,5) then R to (6,5), but that takes three moves, so on turn 74 to (5,6), turn 75 to (5,5), turn 76 to (6,5), which is the last chance, but possible.\n\nBut if I go R on 73, I can eat on 74, earlier.\n\nAlso, by eating earlier, I grow earlier, which might help with other things.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nFirst, if I go R to (5,5) on turn 73.\n\nThen head at (5,5), direction R.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,6)\n\n- D: (5,4)\n\n- L: (4,5) but (4,5) is now occupied by body, from above, body1 at (4,5), so cannot move there.\n\n- R: (6,5) to eat food.\n\nSo I can go U, D, or R.\n\nR to (6,5) is safe and eats food.\n\nIf I go U to (5,6) or D to (5,4), I delay eating.\n\nBut since I can eat on 74, it's fine.\n\nAfter eating at (6,5) on turn 74, the snake grows.\n\nBut for now, let's plan to eat (6,5).\n\nThen, after that, I can think about other food.\n\nBut there is food at (2,6) which is now free, and (3,2) under body.\n\n(2,6) has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\n(3,2) has life span 7.\n\nBut (3,2) is occupied, need it to move away.\n\nIn the current state, after move on turn 73, if I go R to (5,5), then on turn 74 I go R to (6,5).\n\nOn turn 74, move to (6,5), which has food, so eat it.\n\nThen, after eating, the snake grows: head moves to (6,5), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so new positions: head at (6,5), then the body as before but tail stays.\n\nBefore move on turn 74, head at (5,5), positions: let's say after turn 73 move to (5,5), positions as above.\n\nThen on turn 74, move to (6,5).\n\nNew head at (6,5)\n\nThen body1 at old head (5,5)\n\nBody2 at old body1 (4,5)\n\nAnd so on, up to body13 at (2,5)\n\nBut since food eaten, the tail does not move, so the old tail position is occupied, and a new segment is added there? No.\n\nWhen eat, during move, the tail segment is not removed; it stays.\n\nSo new positions: new head at (6,5)\n\nThen body1 at old head position (5,5)\n\nBody2 at old body1 position (4,5)\n\n...\n\nBody13 at old body12 position (1,5)  // from previous list\n\nAnd the old tail at (2,5) remains, so now body14 at (2,5)\n\nLength increases by one.\n\nSpecifically, before move turn 74: head (5,5), body1 (4,5), body2 (3,5), ..., body13 (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,5) with eat:\n\nNew head (6,5)\n\nNew body1: old head (5,5)\n\nNew body2: old body1 (4,5)\n\nNew body3: old body2 (3,5)\n\n...\n\nNew body13: old body12 (1,5)  // in previous after turn 73, body12 was (1,5), body13 was (2,5)\n\nAfter turn 73, positions: head (5,5), body1 (4,5), body2 (3,5), body3 (3,4), body4 (4,4), body5 (4,3), body6 (4,2), body7 (3,2), body8 (3,3), body9 (2,3), body10 (1,3), body11 (1,4), body12 (1,5), body13 (2,5)\n\nSo body13 is (2,5)\n\nOn turn 74, move to (6,5), eat food.\n\nNew head (6,5)\n\nNew body1: (5,5)  // old head\n\nNew body2: (4,5)  // old body1\n\nNew body3: (3,5)  // old body2\n\nNew body4: (3,4)  // old body3\n\nNew body5: (4,4)  // old body4\n\nNew body6: (4,3)  // old body5\n\nNew body7: (4,2)  // old body6\n\nNew body8: (3,2)  // old body7\n\nNew body9: (3,3)  // old body8\n\nNew body10: (2,3)  // old body9\n\nNew body11: (1,3)  // old body10\n\nNew body12: (1,4)  // old body11\n\nNew body13: (1,5)  // old body12\n\nNew body14: (2,5)  // old body13, which was the tail, and since eat, it stays, so new tail at (2,5)\n\nNow, food at (2,6) is free, and (3,2) is occupied by body8.\n\nAfter this, the snake is longer, and head at (6,5).\n\nI need to think long-term. Also, avoid getting trapped.\n\nNow, other food: (2,6) is free, at (2,6), with value 1, life span 10, so I can eat it later.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), occupied, need to wait.\n\nFrom (6,5), after eating, I can move to other places.\n\nBut let's see the grid; there might be risks.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(6,4) is below (6,5), so from (6,5), if I go D to (6,4), but (6,4) is obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\nSimilarly, U to (6,6) but y=6, not wall? y=7 wall, y=6 is playable, but (6,6) may be free.\n\nL to (5,5) but occupied by body.\n\nD to (6,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo from (6,5), possible moves:\n\nU to (6,6)\n\nL to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nR to (7,5) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,6).\n\nIs that right? (6,6) is x=6,y=6, not border, not obstacle, and not occupied? After move, positions include (6,5) head, (5,5), (4,5), etc., no (6,6), so free.\n\nSo from (6,5), only possible move is U to (6,6), since other directions blocked or occupied.\n\nThen after that, head at (6,6), then I can go L to (5,6) or U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, or R to (7,6) x=7 wall, D to (6,5) but occupied.\n\nSo from (6,6), possible: L to (5,6) or D to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, occupied, cannot, so only L to (5,6).\n\nThen to (5,6), and so on.\n\nBut this is after eating.\n\nBack to turn 73.\n\nIf I go R on turn 73 to (5,5), then on turn 74 to (6,5) to eat, then on turn 75 only U to (6,6), turn 76 to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut after turn 74, head at (6,5), only move U to (6,6), which is fine.\n\nThen from (6,6), only move L to (5,6), then from (5,6), I can go U, D, L, R, but need to see what is free.\n\n(5,6): U to (5,7) y=7 wall, invalid; D to (5,5) may be occupied; L to (4,6); R to (6,6) occupied.\n\nBut at that time, positions change.\n\nBut it might lead to a path where I can go towards other food.\n\nBut there is a problem with the food at (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is occupied, and to eat it, I need the body to move away.\n\nCurrently, after turn 73, if I go R, (3,2) is occupied by body7.\n\nAs the snake moves, it will shift, but slowly.\n\nFor example, the segment at (3,2) will move when the snake moves.\n\nBut it might take many turns to free (3,2).\n\nLife span is 7, so by turn 79, it might be free.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach it.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going to the area where (2,6) food is, which is now free.\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), and head is at (4,5) or after moves.\n\nAnother option: on turn 73, instead of going R, go U to (4,6).\n\nThen from (4,6), I can go to (5,6) or (4,5) but (4,5) will be body, or (3,6), etc.\n\nThen I might not eat (6,5) soon, but I can eat (2,6) or something.\n\nBut (6,5) has short life, so I should eat it.\n\nPerhaps eating (6,5) is the best immediate action.\n\nThen after that, I can plan to eat (2,6) which is free.\n\nFrom head at (6,5) after turn 74, go U to (6,6) on turn 75, then L to (5,6) on turn 76.\n\nThen from (5,6), possible moves: U invalid, D to (5,5), which may be occupied, but after turn 76, let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 74: head at (6,5), body as above.\n\nTurn 75: move U to (6,6)\n\nNew head (6,6)\n\nBody1: old head (6,5)\n\nBody2: old body1 (5,5)\n\nAnd so on, down to body14 at (2,5)\n\nSince no eat, tail at (2,5) is removed, so new tail at old body13 position.\n\nBefore move: head (6,5), body1 (5,5), body2 (4,5), ..., body13 (1,5), body14 (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,6) no eat:\n\nNew head (6,6)\n\nBody1: (6,5)\n\nBody2: (5,5)\n\nBody3: (4,5)\n\n...\n\nBody13: (1,4)  // old body12\n\nBody14: (1,5)  // old body13? Let's index.\n\nPositions before turn 75 move: head (6,5), body1 (5,5), body2 (4,5), body3 (3,5), body4 (3,4), body5 (4,4), body6 (4,3), body7 (4,2), body8 (3,2), body9 (3,3), body10 (2,3), body11 (1,3), body12 (1,4), body13 (1,5), body14 (2,5) tail.\n\nAfter move U to (6,6) no eat:\n\nNew head (6,6)\n\nBody1: old head (6,5)\n\nBody2: old body1 (5,5)\n\nBody3: old body2 (4,5)\n\nBody4: old body3 (3,5)\n\nBody5: old body4 (3,4)\n\nBody6: old body5 (4,4)\n\nBody7: old body6 (4,3)\n\nBody8: old body7 (4,2)\n\nBody9: old body8 (3,2)\n\nBody10: old body9 (3,3)\n\nBody11: old body10 (2,3)\n\nBody12: old body11 (1,3)\n\nBody13: old body12 (1,4)\n\nBody14: old body13 (1,5)  // new tail\n\nOld tail (2,5) vacated.\n\nFood at (2,6) is still there, life span 10.\n\nNow head at (6,6)\n\nFrom (6,6), possible moves:\n\nU to (6,7) invalid\n\nD to (6,5) occupied by body1\n\nL to (5,6)\n\nR to (7,6) invalid\n\nSo only L to (5,6)\n\nTurn 76: move L to (5,6)\n\nNew head (5,6)\n\nBody1: old head (6,6)\n\nBody2: (6,5)\n\nBody3: (5,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, from (5,6), possible moves:\n\nU to (5,7) invalid\n\nD to (5,5) occupied by body3? Positions: after move, body2 at (6,5), body3 at (5,5), etc.\n\nSo (5,5) occupied.\n\nL to (4,6)\n\nR to (6,6) occupied by body1\n\nSo only L to (4,6) or D to (5,5) occupied, cannot, so only L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 77: move L to (4,6)\n\nThen similarly, I can keep going left or down.\n\nBut I need to target the food at (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which was vacated earlier.\n\nFrom current position, after turn 77 head at (4,6), I can go to (3,6), then (2,6), but need to see if free.\n\nFrom (4,6), after turn 77, positions will have changed.\n\nLet's assume I go L to (4,6) on turn 77.\n\nThen from there, I can go L to (3,6), then to (2,6).\n\n(3,6) and (2,6) should be free if no one there.\n\nFor example, on turn 77, head to (4,6), then turn 78 to (3,6), turn 79 to (2,6) to eat.\n\n(2,6) has life span 10, turn 73+5=78, etc., plenty of time.\n\nBut there is also food at (3,2), which might be freed earlier.\n\nIn the current state, after turn 73, if I go R, (3,2) is occupied.\n\nAs the snake moves, it will take time for that segment to move.\n\nFor example, the cell (3,2) is occupied by a body segment that will move when the snake moves, but it might be slow.\n\nSince the snake is long, it could take many turns to free (3,2).\n\nLife span 7, from turn 73, by turn 80, it might be free, but I can check if I can reach it.\n\nBut with the path above, I might be far.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 73, instead of going R, go U to (4,6).\n\nThen from (4,6), I can go L to (3,6) or R to (5,6) or D to (4,5) but (4,5) will be body.\n\nAfter turn 73 move U to (4,6):\n\nNew head (4,6)\n\nBody1: old head (4,5)\n\nBody2: old body1 (3,5)\n\n etc., similar to before but head at (4,6).\n\nThen from (4,6), I can go L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n\nIf I go L to (3,6), then to (2,6) or (3,5), etc.\n\n(2,6) has food, free now.\n\nFrom (4,6), to (3,6) on turn 74, then to (2,6) on turn 75 to eat.\n\nBut when moving to (2,6), is head adjacent to tail? Tail is at (2,5) after turn 73 move.\n\nAfter turn 73 move U to (4,6):\n\nPositions: head (4,6), body1 (4,5), body2 (3,5), body3 (3,4), body4 (4,4), body5 (4,3), body6 (4,2), body7 (3,2), body8 (3,3), body9 (2,3), body10 (1,3), body11 (1,4), body12 (1,5), body13 (2,5) tail.\n\nFood at (2,6) is free.\n\nHead at (4,6), distance to (2,6) is |4-2| + |6-6| = 2, so two steps.\n\nBut to go to (2,6), I need to go left.\n\nFrom (4,6), go L to (3,6) on turn 74.\n\n(3,6) should be free? Not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions above, so free.\n\nThen new head (3,6), body1 (4,6), etc., tail at (2,5) or something.\n\nThen on turn 75, from (3,6), I can go L to (2,6) to eat.\n\n(2,6) is adjacent to tail? Tail is at, after turn 74 move.\n\nAfter turn 74 move to (3,6):\n\nNew head (3,6)\n\nBody1: old head (4,6)\n\nBody2: old body1 (4,5)\n\nBody3: old body2 (3,5)\n\n...\n\nBody13: old body12 (1,5)\n\nBody14: old body13 (2,5)  // since no eat, but after turn 73, tail was (2,5), and no eat, so after move, tail removed.\n\nAfter turn 73: head (4,6), body1 (4,5), ..., body13 (2,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (3,6) no eat:\n\nNew head (3,6)\n\nBody1: (4,6)\n\nBody2: (4,5)\n\nBody3: (3,5)\n\n...\n\nBody13: (1,4)  // old body12 (1,4)? Let's not list all.\n\nOld tail (2,5) vacated.\n\nNew tail at old body12 position, which was (1,5) or something.\n\nBut (2,6) is free.\n\nFrom (3,6), go L to (2,6) on turn 75.\n\n(2,6) has food, so eat it.\n\nNow, is head adjacent to tail? Before move, head at (3,6), tail at? After turn 74, positions: new tail is at, for example, old body12 position.\n\nAfter turn 74: body13 at old body12 position, which was (1,5) in turn 73 state? Turn 73: body12 was (1,5), body13 (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (3,6), body13 at old body12 position (1,5)\n\nSo tail at (1,5)\n\nHead at (3,6), distance to tail (1,5) is |3-1| + |6-5| = 2+1=3, not adjacent.\n\n(2,6) is the target, not tail.\n\nWhen moving to (2,6), head from (3,6) to (2,6), which is adjacent to? (2,6) is the cell, not tail position.\n\nTail is at (1,5), not adjacent to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) and (1,5) are not adjacent; differ in both coordinates.\n\nSo no danger.\n\nEat safely.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut in this case, I ate (2,6) on turn 75, but I didn't eat (6,5), which has life span 4, so by turn 76 it disappears.\n\nIf I go U on turn 73, I can eat (2,6) on turn 75, but miss (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is +1, same as others.\n\nBut with life span 4, if I don't eat it, I lose it.\n\nIf I go R on turn 73, I eat (6,5) on turn 74, then I can still eat (2,6) later, as I was planning earlier.\n\nIn the first plan, after eating (6,5), I was at (6,6) then (5,6) by turn 76, then to (4,6) on turn 77, then to (3,6) on turn 78, to (2,6) on turn 79, which is within life span 10.\n\n(2,6) life span 10, until turn 82.\n\nSo I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) might be freed.\n\nBut in the U option, I eat (2,6) earlier but miss (6,5).\n\nSince all food is +1, eating one is similar, but (6,5) has short life, so better to eat it to not lose the opportunity.\n\nMoreover, after eating (6,5), the snake is longer, which might be useful for survival, but also can be riskier if space is tight.\n\nBut in this grid, there is space.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacles might block paths.\n\nFor example, (2,4) is obstacle, (1,2), etc.\n\nBut I think I can navigate.\n\nAlso, for long-term, I should consider the available space.\n\nBut for now, I think going for (6,5) is good.\n\nThen, after that, I can head towards the left to eat (2,6) and eventually (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is occupied, and as the snake moves, the body will shift, so the cell (3,2) will be freed when the segment there moves.\n\nFor example, in the first plan, after turn 73 R to (5,5), (3,2) is occupied by body7.\n\nAs the snake moves, it will take about 7-8 moves for that segment to reach the tail or something, but it varies.\n\nSince life span is 7, it should be freed by then.\n\nI can plan to go there.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output the actions for the next few turns.\n\nThe format is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nSo for turn 73, I need to decide.\n\nI think I'll go with R to (5,5) on turn 73.\n\nThen on turn 74, R to (6,5) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 75, U to (6,6)\n\nTurn 76, L to (5,6)\n\nThen on turn 77, from (5,6), I can go L to (4,6) or other, but as before, only L to (4,6) likely.\n\nBut let's confirm on turn 76.\n\nAfter turn 75 U to (6,6), head at (6,6)\n\nThen turn 76 L to (5,6), head at (5,6)\n\nFrom (5,6), on turn 76, positions: after turn 75 move, head at (6,6), body1 (6,5), etc.\n\nAfter turn 76 move to (5,6), new head (5,6), body1 (6,6), body2 (6,5), body3 (5,5), etc.\n\nThen from (5,6), possible moves: U invalid, D to (5,5) occupied by body3, L to (4,6), R to (6,6) occupied by body1.\n\nSo only L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 77 L to (4,6)\n\nThen from (4,6), on turn 77, positions after move, head at (4,6), body1 (5,6), body2 (6,6), body3 (6,5), etc.\n\nThen from (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7) invalid, D to (4,5) which may be occupied, L to (3,6), R to (5,6) occupied.\n\n(4,5) is body, say body4 or something, occupied.\n\nSo L to (3,6) or D to (4,5) occupied, cannot, so only L to (3,6)\n\nTurn 78 L to (3,6)\n\nThen from (3,6), to (2,6) on turn 79 to eat (2,6)\n\n(2,6) should be free.\n\nThen after that, I can go to other places.\n\nFor (3,2), it might be freed later.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, I can do for 5 turns or so.\n\nTurn 73: R\n\nTurn 74: R\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: L\n\nTurn 77: L\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nAlso, on turn 73, if I go U, I could eat (2,6) faster, but miss (6,5).\n\nI think (6,5) is easier to get and not risky.\n\nMoreover, in the U path, to eat (2,6) on turn 75, but from turn 73 U to (4,6), turn 74 to (3,6), turn 75 to (2,6), but when moving to (2,6), it might be fine.\n\nBut (6,5) will be lost.\n\nSince all food is same value, eating (6,5) or (2,6) is similar, but (6,5) has shorter life, so better to prioritize it to avoid losing it.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,5), I am at (6,5), which is corner, but I can escape via up.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo I'll go with R for turn 73.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 73: R\n\nTurn 74: R (to eat food at (6,5))\n\nThen for turn 75, from (6,5), only U possible, so U.\n\nTurn 76: from (6,6), only L to (5,6), so L.\n\nThen turn 77: from (5,6), only L to (4,6), so L.\n\nI can output for 5 turns.\n\nBut the answer should start from turn 73.\n\nAlso, I need to box it.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nFor turn 73: R\n\nTurn 74: R\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: L\n\nTurn 77: L\n\nThen beyond, but 5 turns is fine.\n\nTo be precise, on turn 74, when I move to (6,5), I eat the food, so I should mention.\n\nBut in actions, just the move.\n\nNow, about the food at (3,2): in this path, I might not eat it soon, but it has life span 7, so I can later.\n\nSimilarly, I can head down after.\n\nBut for now, this seems a safe path.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned moves at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (1,1) has a life span of 1 and is unreachable by turn 73, so it is ignored.\n  - (6,5) has a life span of 4 (disappears after turn 76) and is easily reachable in 2 moves (by turn 74). Eating it early secures +1 score and increases length, improving future flexibility.\n  - (2,6) has a life span of 10 (disappears after turn 82) and is currently under the tail. It becomes free after the first move and can be eaten later (around turn 78-79) without immediate danger since the head is not adjacent to the tail initially.\n  - (3,2) has a life span of 7 (disappears after turn 79) but is under a body segment. It will take time to free up, so it is not a short-term priority.\n- **Movement Safety**: \n  - From (4,5) at turn 73, possible moves are U to (4,6) or R to (5,5). Moving R directly toward (6,5) is efficient and avoids risks.\n  - After eating (6,5) on turn 74, the head is at (6,5). Due to walls and body, the only safe move is U to (6,6) on turn 75.\n  - Subsequent moves (turns 76-77) navigate toward (2,6) while avoiding walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n- **Long-Term Path**: \n  - After turn 77, the path continues toward (2,6) for eating around turn 79, and then toward (3,2) once freed. This ensures no food is wasted and survival is maintained.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No instant reverse is possible or needed.\n  - The planned path avoids body collisions and walls. Eating (2,6) later does not trigger \"Tail Reward Danger\" as the head is not adjacent to the tail when targeted.\n\n**Planned Moves (5 turns ahead):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 73: R (right)  \nTurn 74: R (right)  \nTurn 75: U (up)  \nTurn 76: L (left)  \nTurn 77: L (left)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 74, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. I must prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nLet me list out the key elements from the state:\n\n- **Walls**: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are also blocked.\n\n- **Snake Positions**: Head is at (5,5), and the body segments follow: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5). The head is at index 0, so positions are: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]. That's 14 segments.\n\n- **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving right (R), so from (5,5) it came from left, since the next segment is (4,5), which is left of (5,5)? Let's see: head is (5,5), second is (4,5), which is left, so the snake was moving left to right? Head direction is given as R, meaning it's currently facing right. So from (4,5) to (5,5), it moved right to (5,5). So current direction is R.\n\n- **Food**: Three food items:\n  - (6,5) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n  - (3,2) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n  - (2,6) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food has value 1, so all are positive. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current turn, so I need to consider how many turns each food has left.\n\nCurrent turn is 74.\n\nFood at (6,5): life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns, meaning on turn 78 it's gone? Life span decreases every turn, so at turn 74, life span is 4, then turn 75 it becomes 3, turn 76:2, turn 77:1, turn 78:0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 74 to 77 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before or after the turn? Typically, it should be that at the start of turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L more turns, including t. So if life span is 4 at turn 74, it means it can be eaten on turns 74,75,76,77, and disappears before turn 78.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life span 6: available from turn 74 to 79, disappears turn 80.\n\n(2,6) life span 9: available from turn 74 to 82, disappears turn 83.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (5,5), moving right. Possible moves: U (up, to (5,6)), D (down, to (5,4)), L (left, to (4,5)), R (right, to (6,5)).\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied by the second segment of the snake, so moving left would cause collision? No, because when the snake moves, the tail moves, so it's only deadly if it collides with a body segment that isn't the tail.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe.\n\nCurrent positions: head at (5,5), tail at (2,5)? Snake positions: indices 0 to 13: 0:(5,5), 1:(4,5), 2:(3,5), 3:(3,4), 4:(4,4), 5:(4,3), 6:(4,2), 7:(3,2), 8:(3,3), 9:(2,3), 10:(1,3), 11:(1,4), 12:(1,5), 13:(2,5). So tail is (2,5).\n\nIf I move left to (4,5), which is currently occupied by segment 1. But when I move, the head moves to (4,5), and the tail moves away from (2,5) to... let's see the movement.\n\nAfter moving, the new head position is where I move, and the body follows, so the segment that was at position 1 will be at... it depends on the move.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail (last segment) is removed, except if food is eaten, then tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, if I move to a cell, if it's not food, the snake moves, head to new position, each body segment to next position, tail is removed. So the cell that was occupied by the tail is now free.\n\nSpecifically, if I move to (4,5), which is currently occupied by segment 1. After move: head moves to (4,5), which was segment 1, but now it's the new head position. Then segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was? No.\n\nLet's think: positions before move: S0: (5,5), S1: (4,5), S2: (3,5), etc.\n\nAfter moving left to (4,5): new head is at (4,5). Then S1 (which was at (4,5)) moves to the old position of S0, which is (5,5)? No, that's not how it works.\n\nI think I have it backward.\n\nStandard: the head moves to the new cell. Then each body segment from the neck down moves to the position of the segment before it. So:\n\n- New position of head: (4,5) if I move left.\n\nThen, the segment that was S1 (at (4,5)) moves to where S0 was, but S0 was (5,5), so S1 moves to (5,5)? That would mean S1 goes to (5,5), but (5,5) is now empty? I'm confusing myself.\n\nBetter to think: the snake consists of segments. When head moves, it occupies a new cell. Then the body segments shift: the first body segment (S1) moves to the old head position, S2 moves to the old S1 position, and so on, until the tail moves to the old second-to-last position.\n\nIn this case, before move:\n\n- S0: (5,5)\n\n- S1: (4,5)\n\n- S2: (3,5)\n\n- etc.\n\nAfter moving left to (4,5):\n\n- New S0: (4,5)  // new head position\n\n- New S1: old S0 position, which is (5,5)  // since S1 moves to where head was\n\n- New S2: old S1 position, which is (4,5), but (4,5) is now the head? No.\n\nPositions:\n\n- Old: S0 at P0, S1 at P1, S2 at P2, ..., S13 at P13\n\nAfter move to a new cell C:\n\n- If C is not food, then:\n\n  - New S0: C\n\n  - New S1: P0\n\n  - New S2: P1\n\n  - ...\n\n  - New S13: P12  // and P13 is vacated\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,5), which is currently P1.\n\nSo C = (4,5)\n\nThen new positions:\n\n- S0: (4,5)  // C\n\n- S1: P0 = (5,5)\n\n- S2: P1 = (4,5) but (4,5) is now S0, so S2 moves to (4,5)? But (4,5) is occupied by head? No, the positions are updated simultaneously, so no conflict.\n\nAfter move, S0 is at (4,5), S1 is at (5,5), S2 is at (3,5) (which was P2), S3 at (3,4), and so on, down to S13 at (2,5) which was P13, but since we moved, S13 is now at P12, which is (1,5), and P13 is vacated.\n\nLet's list old positions:\n\nIndex: 0: (5,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (3,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3), 9: (2,3), 10: (1,3), 11: (1,4), 12: (1,5), 13: (2,5)\n\nIf move left to (4,5), which is currently occupied by S1.\n\nAfter move, no food eaten, so:\n\n- New head S0: (4,5)\n\n- New S1: old S0 = (5,5)\n\n- New S2: old S1 = (4,5) but (4,5) is now S0, so S2 is at the position where S1 was, which is (4,5)? No: new S2 is old S1 position, which is (4,5), but since the head moved to (4,5), and S1 moved to (5,5), S2 moves to the old position of S1, which is (4,5), but (4,5) is now the head position? This is messy.\n\nI think it's better to think that the cells are occupied after the move, and the tail vacates its cell.\n\nSpecifically, when you move to a cell, if that cell was occupied by a body segment, it might be okay if it's the tail or something.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut in this case, (4,5) is S1, not the tail. The tail is S13 at (2,5).\n\nMoving to (4,5) which is currently occupied by S1. Since S1 is not the tail, moving there would cause a collision because after the move, the head is at (4,5), and S1 is moving to (5,5), but at the time of move, the cell is occupied, so it's a collision.\n\nThe rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" and \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment\"\n\nSo for any body segment except the tail, moving into it causes collision because that segment is still there when the head moves in.\n\nOnly for the tail, since it moves away, it's safe.\n\nIn this case, (4,5) is occupied by S1, which is not the tail, so moving left to (4,5) is invalid and causes death.\n\nSimilarly, moving to any cell occupied by a body segment except the tail is deadly.\n\nAlso, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,5) is within bounds, no wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — none at (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied by snake body, so cannot move there.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,5) with current direction R.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut L (left to (4,5)): occupied by body, so invalid, would die.\n\nR (right to (6,5)): is this free? Let's see cells.\n\n(6,5): is it occupied or wall?\n\nWalls: borders, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, so (6,5) x=6, y=5, x=6 is not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (6,4) is there, but (6,5) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — (6,5) not in list, so free.\n\nAlso, food at (6,5) is present.\n\nU (up to (5,6)): y=6, which is not y=7 or y=0, so not border. Internal obstacles not at (5,6). Snake positions not at (5,6), so should be free.\n\nD (down to (5,4)): similarly, y=4, not border, not internal obstacle, not snake position? Snake has (4,4), (3,4), but not (5,4), so free.\n\nL (left to (4,5)): occupied by snake body, S1, so invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nR is to (6,5), which has food.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: since current direction is R, I cannot move L next turn, but L is invalid anyway, so for next turn, if I move U or D, I can move in any direction except opposite, but since I'm moving to a new direction, the opposite constraint applies to the next move.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo for the current turn, from direction R, I can move U, D, R (since L is invalid anyway).\n\nIf I move R to (6,5), I eat the food there, since (6,5) has food.\n\nFood at (6,5) is positive, value 1, so eating it increases length by 1.\n\nLife span 4, so it can be eaten now.\n\nBut I need to consider Tail Reward Danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nFirst, head adjacent to tail: tail is at (2,5), head at (5,5), distance |5-2| + |5-5| = 3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\nHead (5,5), tail (2,5), not adjacent; they are three cells apart.\n\nSo no issue here.\n\nIf I move to (6,5), I eat the food, so snake grows: head moves to (6,5), and tail stays, so new tail is still at (2,5)? When you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the new position has head at (6,5), S1 at (5,5), S2 at (4,5), ..., up to S13 at (2,5), and a new segment added at the tail, so S14 at (2,5)? No.\n\nWhen food is eaten, head moves to food cell, and the body follows, but the tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n\nSo positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head becomes the new neck, and so on, tail remains.\n\nBefore move: positions S0 to S13.\n\nAfter eating food at C: new S0 at C, new S1 at old S0, new S2 at old S1, ..., new S13 at old S12, and new S14 at old S13 (tail position).\n\nSo the tail cell now has a new segment, and the old tail position is still occupied.\n\nIn this case, if I eat at (6,5), new head at (6,5), new S1 at (5,5), new S2 at (4,5), ..., new S13 at (1,5) (since old S12 was (1,5)), new S14 at (2,5) (old S13).\n\nAnd since I ate food, the life span decreases, but food is consumed.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, R.\n\nR: to (6,5), eat food, grow.\n\nU: to (5,6)\n\nD: to (5,4)\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there are other foods: (3,2) with life span 6, and (2,6) with life span 9.\n\n(3,2) is currently occupied by the snake? Snake has S7 at (3,2), so it's under the body.\n\nRule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo (3,2) has food, but it's under S7. To eat it, I need to move the body away first, then head onto it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is at (2,6), which is free, I think. Let's check.\n\n(2,6): x=2, y=6, not border, not internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (2,4) is there, but (2,6) not listed, so not obstacle. Snake positions: no (2,6), so free. Food there.\n\nNow, grid size: from (0,0) to (7,7), so (2,6) is within bounds.\n\nI should map the grid.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, cannot move there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — these are also walls.\n\nSo free cells are within 1 to 6 in x and y, except those obstacles.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since borders are walls.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1): x=5,y=1; (6,1): x=6,y=1; (1,2): x=1,y=2; (2,4): x=2,y=4; (6,4): x=6,y=4\n\nSnake positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nFood: (6,5), (3,2), (2,6)\n\n(3,2) is occupied by snake, so food under body.\n\nNow, head at (5,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), R to (6,5)\n\nIf I move R to (6,5), I eat food, grow to length 15.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction R (since I moved right).\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5)\n\nBut (6,4) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\n(5,5) is now occupied by S1 after the move, but at the time of move, if I move L to (5,5), what is there?\n\nAfter eating at (6,5), positions: S0: (6,5), S1: (5,5), S2: (4,5), etc.\n\nIf from (6,5) I want to move L to (5,5), which is occupied by S1. S1 is not the tail, so moving there would cause collision. So invalid.\n\nU to (6,6): y=6, not y=7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles? (6,6) not listed, snake? After move, S1 at (5,5), so (6,6) should be free? But we need to check at decision time.\n\nAt the state after moving to (6,5), the cell (6,6) is free, I think. Let's list occupied cells after eating at (6,5):\n\n- S0: (6,5)\n\n- S1: (5,5)\n\n- S2: (4,5)  // old S1\n\n- S3: (3,5)  // old S2\n\n- S4: (3,4)  // old S3\n\n- S5: (4,4)  // old S4\n\n- S6: (4,3)  // old S5\n\n- S7: (4,2)  // old S6\n\n- S8: (3,2)  // old S7\n\n- S9: (3,3)  // old S8\n\n- S10: (2,3)  // old S9\n\n- S11: (1,3)  // old S10\n\n- S12: (1,4)  // old S11\n\n- S13: (1,5)  // old S12\n\n- S14: (2,5)  // new tail, old S13\n\nSo occupied: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\n(6,6) is not occupied, not wall (internal obstacles not there, border y=6<7), so free.\n\nSimilarly, D to (6,4): but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\nL to (5,5): occupied by S1, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n\nSo from (6,5) after eating, possible moves: U to (6,6) or possibly R, but x=6, R would be to (7,6), but x=7 is border wall, so invalid. x=7 is wall, so cannot move right from x=6.\n\nSo only possible moves from (6,5) are U to (6,6) or... what about down? (6,4) is wall, so no. Left to (5,5) invalid. So only up to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at x=6,y=6, not wall, free.\n\nSo if I move R now to (6,5), I eat food, then next turn I must move U to (6,6), no choice.\n\nThen from (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7), but y=7 is border wall, invalid; D to (6,5), which is occupied by S1? After moving to (6,6), positions: if I move U from (6,5) to (6,6), no food, so head to (6,6), S1 to (6,5), S2 to (5,5), etc., tail moves.\n\nSo from (6,6), possible: L to (5,6), D to (6,5), but (6,5) is occupied by S1, not tail, so collision; R to (7,6) wall; U to (6,7) wall. So only possible move is L to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) should be free.\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut this seems risky, as I might get stuck.\n\nNow, other options: from current (5,5), I could move U to (5,6) or D to (5,4).\n\nLet's consider the food at (2,6) and (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is under snake body, so I need to move the body away first.\n\nCurrent snake has S7 at (3,2), which is the food position.\n\nTo eat it, I need the snake to move so that (3,2) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n\nBut head is far away.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is free, I can go for it.\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), head at (5,5), so I need to move left and up.\n\nNow, thinking long-term.\n\nAlso, life span: (6,5) has life span 4, so only 4 turns left, including current.\n\nTurn 74: if I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon.\n\n(3,2) has life 6, (2,6) has life 9, so more time.\n\nBut eating (6,5) now might lead to a dead end, as from (6,5) I can only go to (6,6), then to (5,6), etc.\n\nLet me simulate the grid.\n\nI should find a path to other foods.\n\nSince the grid has obstacles, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nList all wall cells:\n\n- Borders: all x=0, x=7 for y=0 to 7; all y=0, y=7 for x=0 to 7.\n\nBut since playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, the walls are at the borders, so for movement, cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo blocked cells: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nAnd borders are walls, so cannot go to x=0,7 or y=0,7.\n\nFree cells: all (x,y) for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nAnd snake occupies 14 cells, but they move.\n\nFood at (6,5), (3,2), (2,6)\n\n(3,2) is occupied by snake, so not accessible until body moves.\n\nNow, from head (5,5), move options:\n\n- R to (6,5): eat food, then to (6,6), then to (5,6), then from (5,6) I can go U to (5,7) invalid, D to (5,5) occupied, L to (4,6) or R to (6,6) occupied.\n\nFrom (5,6): after moving to (6,6) from (6,5), then to (5,6).\n\nAfter moving to (6,6): head at (6,6), S1 at (6,5), S2 at (5,5), etc.\n\nThen move L to (5,6): (5,6) is free? Let's check.\n\n(5,6): x=5,y=6, not border, not internal obstacle (internal are (1,2),(2,4),(5,1),(6,1),(6,4)), (5,6) not there, not snake position at that time, so free.\n\nMove to (5,6), no food, so head to (5,6), S1 to (6,6), S2 to (6,5), etc., tail moves.\n\nThen from (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5), which is occupied by S2 (since S2 is at (6,5)? After move to (5,6), positions: S0:(5,6), S1:(6,6), S2:(6,5), S3:(5,5), etc.\n\nSo (5,5) is occupied by S3, not tail, so moving D to (5,5) causes collision.\n\nL to (4,6): (4,6) should be free.\n\nR to (6,6): occupied by S1, not tail, collision.\n\nSo only possible move from (5,6) is L to (4,6).\n\nThen to (4,6), and so on.\n\nBut I might be going in circles or to a dead end.\n\nMoreover, the area near (6,5) is constrained.\n\nNow, if I move U from current position to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is free, as per earlier.\n\nMove U to (5,6), no food there, so snake moves, head to (5,6), S1 to (5,5), S2 to (4,5), etc., tail at (2,5) moves to (1,5)? Old tail S13 at (2,5), after move, S13 at old S12 position (1,5), and (2,5) vacated.\n\nThen from (5,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5) occupied by S1, L to (4,6), R to (6,6).\n\n(4,6) and (6,6) should be free.\n\nSo I can go L or R.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (5,4), (5,4) is free, move there, then from there.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at x=2,y=6, free.\n\nFrom (5,5), to reach (2,6), I need to go left and up.\n\nPath: for example, from (5,5) move U to (5,6), then L to (4,6), then to (3,6), but (3,6) is free? x=3,y=6, not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake has (3,5), (3,4), etc., but not (3,6), so free.\n\nThen to (2,6), eat food.\n\nBut (2,6) has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is under body, so I need to free it first.\n\nCurrent snake position at (3,2) is S7.\n\nAs the snake moves, the body will shift.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the segment at (3,2) moves away.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, I should consider the value of each move sequence.\n\nAlso, avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (6,5), I might be trapped in the top-right corner.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), I can only go to (4,6), then to (4,5) or (4,7) invalid, or (3,6).\n\n(4,5) is occupied after moves.\n\nLet's simulate a few turns.\n\nFirst, if I move R to (6,5) at turn 74: eat food, grow to 15 segments.\n\nHead at (6,5), direction R.\n\nTurn 75: only move U to (6,6), no food, head to (6,6), S1 to (6,5), etc.\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 76: from (6,6), only move L to (5,6), no food, head to (5,6), S1 to (6,6), S2 to (6,5), etc.\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 77: from (5,6), only move L to (4,6), no food, head to (4,6), S1 to (5,6), S2 to (6,6), etc.\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 78: from (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5), L to (3,6), R to (5,6).\n\n(4,5): is it free? Current positions: S0:(4,6), S1:(5,6), S2:(6,6), S3:(6,5), S4:(5,5), S5:(4,5), S6:(3,5), etc. So (4,5) is occupied by S5, not tail, so moving D to (4,5) causes collision.\n\n(5,6) occupied by S1, collision.\n\n(3,6) should be free.\n\nR to (5,6) occupied.\n\nSo only L to (3,6).\n\nMove to (3,6), no food.\n\nAnd so on. I'm moving left along y=6, and the snake is long, so I might have issues later.\n\nBut (2,6) has food, so I can go for it.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move L to (2,6) or D to (3,5), etc.\n\n(3,5) might be occupied.\n\nIn turn 78, at (4,6), move to (3,6), then turn 79 from (3,6), I can move to (2,6) to eat food, if it's still there.\n\n(2,6) life span 9, at turn 74, life 9, turn 75:8, 76:7, 77:6, 78:5, 79:4, etc., so at turn 79, still available.\n\nBut let's see the position.\n\nAt turn 78, head at (3,6), after moving from (4,6) to (3,6).\n\nPositions: S0:(3,6), S1:(4,6), S2:(5,6), S3:(6,6), S4:(6,5), S5:(5,5), S6:(4,5), S7:(3,5), S8:(3,4), etc.\n\n(2,6) is free, so move L to (2,6), eat food, grow.\n\nThen head at (2,6), and so on.\n\nBut this is one path.\n\nNow, if from current position, I move U to (5,6) at turn 74.\n\nNo food, head to (5,6), S1 to (5,5), S2 to (4,5), etc., tail moves, vacate (2,5).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 75, from (5,6), possible moves: L to (4,6), R to (6,6), since U wall, D to (5,5) occupied.\n\nSo L or R.\n\nSuppose I move L to (4,6).\n\nNo food, head to (4,6), S1 to (5,6), S2 to (5,5), etc.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 76, from (4,6), possible moves: L to (3,6), D to (4,5), U wall, R to (5,6) occupied.\n\n(4,5) is occupied? Positions: S0:(4,6), S1:(5,6), S2:(5,5), S3:(4,5), S4:(3,5), etc. So (4,5) is S3, not tail, so moving D to (4,5) collision.\n\nSo only L to (3,6).\n\nMove to (3,6).\n\nThen turn 77, from (3,6), move to (2,6) eat food, if I want.\n\nSimilarly, I can reach (2,6) by turn 77 or so.\n\nIf I move directly to (2,6) from current, it might take more turns.\n\nFrom (5,5), move U to (5,6), then L to (4,6), L to (3,6), L to (2,6), that's 4 turns to eat at (2,6) on turn 77 or 78.\n\nTurn 74: move U to (5,6)\n\nTurn 75: move L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 76: move L to (3,6)\n\nTurn 77: move L to (2,6) eat.\n\n(2,6) life span 9 at turn 74, turn 77 life span 6, so available.\n\nBut I could go for (3,2) food, but it's under body.\n\n(3,2) has food, but occupied by S7.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move the body away.\n\nFor example, if I move the snake in a way that the segment at (3,2) moves.\n\nCurrently, the snake is from head to tail: (5,5)-R, (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nS7 at (3,2) with food.\n\nIf I move, for example, down from (5,5) to (5,4), then the body will shift.\n\nTurn 74 move D to (5,4), no food, head to (5,4), S1 to (5,5), S2 to (4,5), S3 to (3,5), S4 to (3,4), S5 to (4,4), S6 to (4,3), S7 to (4,2), S8 to (3,2), but S8 was at (3,2), and after move, S7 moves to old S6 position (4,2), S8 moves to old S7 position (3,2), so (3,2) is still occupied by S8 now? Let's see:\n\nOld positions before move turn 74:\n\nS0: (5,5)\n\nS1: (4,5)\n\nS2: (3,5)\n\nS3: (3,4)\n\nS4: (4,4)\n\nS5: (4,3)\n\nS6: (4,2)\n\nS7: (3,2)\n\nS8: (3,3)\n\netc.\n\nAfter move D to (5,4), no food:\n\nNew S0: (5,4)\n\nNew S1: old S0 = (5,5)\n\nNew S2: old S1 = (4,5)\n\nNew S3: old S2 = (3,5)\n\nNew S4: old S3 = (3,4)\n\nNew S5: old S4 = (4,4)\n\nNew S6: old S5 = (4,3)\n\nNew S7: old S6 = (4,2)  // S7 now at (4,2)\n\nNew S8: old S7 = (3,2)  // S8 at (3,2)\n\nS9: old S8 = (3,3)\n\netc.\n\nSo (3,2) is still occupied by S8, the food is there, but not accessible.\n\nThe body needs to move away completely.\n\nIf I continue moving, it might free up.\n\nBut it could take many turns.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (2,5), so when the tail moves past (3,2), it might be free, but (3,2) is not on the tail path directly.\n\nThe snake path is convoluted.\n\nTo free (3,2), I need the snake to move so that the segment at (3,2) is the tail or something.\n\nSince the food is under the body, and I need to move the body away, it might not be worth it for one food, especially since there are other foods available.\n\n(3,2) has life span 6, so it might disappear before I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) has short life.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nIf I eat (6,5) now, I get +1 immediately, but then I'm forced into a path that might be risky or less flexible.\n\nIf I don't eat it, it disappears in 4 turns, but I can go for other foods.\n\nBut (6,5) is close, and I can eat it now.\n\nBut after eating, I have to move to (6,6), then (5,6), etc., which might be okay, but the area is tight.\n\nAnother risk: the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nCurrently, head at (5,5), tail at (2,5), not adjacent.\n\nAfter some moves, if head and tail are adjacent, and tail has food, but in this case, no food on tail.\n\n(2,5) is tail, no food there.\n\nFood is at (6,5), (3,2), (2,6), not on tail.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (6,5) because it might lead to a trap.\n\nLet's see the grid layout.\n\nList free cells:\n\nx 1 to 6, y 1 to 6 except obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSo free: for y=1: cells (1,1) but (1,2) blocked, (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) blocked, (6,1) blocked, so only (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) free at y=1? y=1, x from 1 to 6: (1,1) not obstacle? Obstacles are (1,2), (2,4), etc., (1,1) is not listed, so free? But (1,2) is blocked, but (1,1) is different.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSo for (1,1): not border, not internal obstacle, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) free, (3,1) free, (4,1) free, (5,1) blocked, (6,1) blocked.\n\ny=2: (1,2) blocked, (2,2) free? (2,2) not obstacle, so free; (3,2) has food but under snake; (4,2) snake; etc.\n\nBut for pathing, I can ignore snake for now.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, I should head towards the center or open area.\n\nBut let's decide the move for turn 74.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the state may change, so I think for the answer, I need to provide a sequence of actions starting from turn 74.\n\nBut the future states depend on food and snake position, so I can only plan based on current state.\n\nThe food life span decreases, and new food may spawn, but in this state, no new food, only existing.\n\nThe problem doesn't say new food spawns, so only these foods.\n\nI think I need to choose a sequence.\n\nBut to be safe, let's not eat (6,5) because it forces me into a corner.\n\nMove U to (5,6) or D to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is below.\n\nMove D to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is free, move there, no food.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,4) or (5,3) or (6,4) wall, etc.\n\n(4,4) is occupied by snake? Current snake has S4 at (4,4), so after move, it might be free or not.\n\nTurn 74 move D to (5,4), no food, head to (5,4), S1 to (5,5), S2 to (4,5), S3 to (3,5), S4 to (3,4), S5 to (4,4), etc. So (4,4) is occupied by S5.\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves: L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) wall, U to (5,5) occupied by S1, D to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) should be free.\n\nSo only D to (5,3).\n\nThen to (5,3), and so on, down to bottom, which has obstacles.\n\nNot good.\n\nMove U to (5,6) is better, towards (2,6) food.\n\nOr move R to (6,5) and eat.\n\nBut let's consider the score.\n\nIf I eat (6,5), I get +1 now, but then I might not be able to eat other food soon.\n\nIf I go for (2,6), I can eat it in a few turns.\n\n(3,2) is harder to get.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,5), the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nCurrent length 14, after eating 15, larger snake.\n\nIn a small grid, it might be crowded.\n\nGrid is 6x6 free area, minus obstacles, minus snake.\n\nFree cells total: 36 cells minus 5 obstacles, so 31 free, snake occupies 14, so 17 free cells.\n\nAfter eating, 15 occupied, 16 free.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be tight.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (2,6) first.\n\nFrom current position, move U to (5,6) at turn 74.\n\nThen turn 75, from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6) or R to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is free, and I can then go to (6,5) if possible, but (6,5) has food, but if I go to (6,6) first, then to (6,5), but (6,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nTurn 74: move U to (5,6), no food, head to (5,6), S1 to (5,5), S2 to (4,5), etc., S13 to (1,5)? Old tail S13 at (2,5), after move, S13 at old S12 (1,5), vacate (2,5).\n\nPositions: S0:(5,6), S1:(5,5), S2:(4,5), S3:(3,5), S4:(3,4), S5:(4,4), S6:(4,3), S7:(4,2), S8:(3,2), S9:(3,3), S10:(2,3), S11:(1,3), S12:(1,4), S13:(1,5)  // (2,5) vacated\n\nFood at (6,5) still there, life span now 3 at turn 75? At turn 74, life span 4, after turn 74, at turn 75, life span 3.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life span 5, (2,6) life span 8.\n\nNow at turn 75, head at (5,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: L to (4,6), R to (6,6), D to (5,5) occupied by S1, U wall.\n\nSo move to (4,6) or (6,6).\n\nIf I move R to (6,6), no food, head to (6,6), S1 to (5,6), S2 to (5,5), etc.\n\nThen from (6,6), turn 76, move L to (5,6) occupied, D to (6,5), which is food position.\n\n(6,5) has food, so I can move D to (6,5) and eat it.\n\nThen grow.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (4,6) at turn 75, I can go towards (2,6).\n\nBut by moving to (6,6) then to (6,5), I can eat (6,5) on turn 76, which is before it disappears.\n\nLife span: at turn 75, (6,5) life span 3, so can be eaten on turn 75,76,77.\n\nTurn 76 is fine.\n\nThen I get the food later, but from a safer position.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (2,6) after.\n\nSo perhaps a better plan: at turn 74, move U to (5,6), then turn 75 move R to (6,6), turn 76 move D to (6,5) eat, then turn 77 move U to (6,6) again? From (6,5) after eating, head at (6,5), then only U to (6,6) as before.\n\nBut then I'm at (6,6) on turn 77.\n\nThen I can go left to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut I can head towards (2,6).\n\nSince (2,6) has long life, I can go for it after.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output 5+ turns or so.\n\nBut the state changes, so I should provide a sequence based on current state.\n\nPerhaps for turn 74, move U.\n\nThen for future turns, I can specify if possible.\n\nBut the food may be eaten or disappear, so the actions might not be valid later.\n\nThe instruction is to provide a sequence of actions for the next turns, based on the current state, assuming no other changes except the snake moving and food countdown.\n\nNo new food spawn mentioned, so only existing food.\n\nSo I can plan a sequence.\n\nLet's plan to eat (6,5) later and (2,6) first or something.\n\nBut (6,5) has short life.\n\nAt turn 74, if I move to (5,6), then at turn 75 to (6,6), turn 76 to (6,5) eat.\n\nThat works.\n\nIf I move directly R to (6,5) at turn 74, I eat now, but then I have fewer choices.\n\nWith the indirect path, I eat on turn 76, still within life span, and I have more space.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,6), I can go after.\n\nAlso, (3,2) might be freed if I move around.\n\nFor example, as the snake moves, the body shifts, so (3,2) might be vacated at some point.\n\nBut let's not worry about it now.\n\nSo for turn 74, I think move U to (5,6) is a good start.\n\nThen turn 75, from (5,6), move R to (6,6)\n\nTurn 76, from (6,6), move D to (6,5) to eat the food there.\n\nThen after eating, head at (6,5), direction D? Moved down, so direction D.\n\nThen turn 77, from (6,5), only move U to (6,6), as before.\n\nThen turn 78, from (6,6), move L to (5,6)\n\nThen from there, I can go towards (2,6).\n\nFor example, turn 79, from (5,6), move L to (4,6)\n\nTurn 80, from (4,6), move L to (3,6)\n\nTurn 81, from (3,6), move L to (2,6) eat, if (2,6) still there.\n\n(2,6) life span 9 at turn 74, turn 81: 74 to 81 is 7 turns, life span decreases to 9-7=2, so available on turn 81.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd (3,2) might be available, but not in the path.\n\nSo this sequence seems feasible.\n\nIf from current, I move R directly, I eat sooner but have less flexibility.\n\nWith move U, I can still eat (6,5) later and have a better position.\n\nSo I think move U at turn 74 is better.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to provide actions for turn 74 to, say, turn 79 or so.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nTurn 74: U (to (5,6))\n\nTurn 75: R (to (6,6))\n\nTurn 76: D (to (6,5), eat food)\n\nTurn 77: U (to (6,6), since only choice)\n\nTurn 78: L (to (5,6))\n\nNow from (5,6), turn 79, I can move L to (4,6) or other, but in the plan, to (4,6).\n\nTurn 79: L (to (4,6))\n\nTurn 80: L (to (3,6))\n\nTurn 81: L (to (2,6), eat)\n\nBut after turn 78, at (5,6), I could move down or something, but to go to (2,6), moving left is fine.\n\nAlso, at turn 76, when I move D to (6,5), I eat, so length increases.\n\nThen from there, the sequence continues.\n\nNow, for the food at (3,2), it might be eaten if I can, but it's not on the way, and life span 6, at turn 74, turn 80 life 0, disappears? Turn 74 life 6, turn 75:5, 76:4, 77:3, 78:2, 79:1, 80:0 disappear. So by turn 80, it's gone, and I'm at (4,6) or something, not near (3,2), so probably not eaten.\n\nBut that's fine, I eat two foods.\n\nNow, to confirm the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 77, from (6,5) after eating, move U to (6,6), then turn 78 L to (5,6), etc.\n\nAlso, at turn 74, when I move U to (5,6), no food, so snake moves, positions change.\n\nThen turn 75 move R to (6,6), no food.\n\nTurn 76 move D to (6,5), eat food.\n\nYes.\n\nIs there any risk in this path?\n\nAt turn 74, moving U to (5,6) is safe.\n\nThen to (6,6), safe.\n\nThen to (6,5), eating.\n\nAfter that, moving to (6,6) and (5,6), all safe.\n\nThen to (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), all should be free.\n\n(3,6) and (2,6) are free initially, and no obstacles.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n\nIf I move D at turn 74, it might be worse.\n\nSo I think U is the best first move.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 74 Decision\n\n**Current State Overview:**\n- **Grid Size and Walls:** The playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), with borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) being deadly.\n- **Snake:** Head at (5,5), direction right (R), length 14. Positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]. Tail at (2,5).\n- **Food:** \n  - (6,5): Value +1, life span 4 (available until turn 77, disappears turn 78).\n  - (3,2): Value +1, life span 6 (available until turn 79, disappears turn 80), but under snake body (segment S7) and can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n  - (2,6): Value +1, life span 9 (available until turn 82, disappears turn 83), free cell.\n- **Immediate Moves from (5,5) with Direction R:**\n  - Left (L) to (4,5): Occupied by snake body (S1), collision—invalid.\n  - Right (R) to (6,5): Free, contains positive food. Eating is possible and safe (head not adjacent to tail).\n  - Up (U) to (5,6): Free, no food.\n  - Down (D) to (5,4): Free, no food.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Prioritize Survival and Flexibility:** Eating (6,5) immediately (turn 74) risks trapping the snake in the top-right corner. After eating, the only safe path is forced: (6,5) → (6,6) → (5,6), reducing maneuverability. The snake grows to length 15, making navigation harder in the cluttered grid. (6,5) has a short life span (4 turns), but it can be eaten later (up to turn 77) from a safer position.\n- **Target (2,6) for Long-Term Gain:** (2,6) has a long life span (9 turns) and is easily reachable in 3-4 turns. Moving toward it first (via U then leftward) opens more options and avoids dead ends.\n- **Handling (3,2):** This food is under the body (S7) and requires multiple moves to free. With a life span of 6 turns, it may disappear (turn 80) before being accessible, so it is not prioritized. Attempting to free it could waste turns and increase risk.\n- **Optimal Path:** \n  - **Turn 74: U to (5,6)**—Avoids immediate corner risk, positions snake to access both (6,5) and (2,6).\n  - **Turn 75: R to (6,6)**—Prepares to eat (6,5) next turn without trapping.\n  - **Turn 76: D to (6,5)**—Eats (6,5) before it disappears (life span 3 at turn 76), growing to length 15.\n  - **Post-Eating (6,5):** From (6,5), only safe move is U to (6,6) (turn 77), then L to (5,6) (turn 78). From there, move left to reach (2,6) by turn 81.\n- **Risks Mitigated:** \n  - No Tail Reward Danger: Head and tail never adjacent during this sequence.\n  - Collision Avoided: All moves are to free cells or the tail-vacated cell.\n  - Life Spans Honored: (6,5) eaten on turn 76 (within 4 turns); (2,6) eaten by turn 81 (within 9 turns).\n\n**Planned Sequence (Turns 74-81):**\n- **Turn 74: U (up)** to (5,6)—Safe, no food, direction changes to U.\n- **Turn 75: R (right)** to (6,6)—Safe, no food, direction changes to R.\n- **Turn 76: D (down)** to (6,5)—Eat food (+1, length 15), direction changes to D.\n- **Turn 77: U (up)** to (6,6)—Only safe move (L/R/D blocked or deadly), no food, direction changes to U.\n- **Turn 78: L (left)** to (5,6)—Safe, no food, direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 79: L (left)** to (4,6)—Safe, no food, direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 80: L (left)** to (3,6)—Safe, no food, direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 81: L (left)** to (2,6)—Eat food (+1, length 16), direction changes to L.\n\nThis sequence maximizes score by eating two positive foods ( (6,5) and (2,6) ) while ensuring long-term survival through flexible, low-risk pathing. (3,2) is ignored due to inaccessibility and short life span.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 74: U \\\\\nTurn 75: R \\\\\nTurn 76: D \\\\\nTurn 77: U \\\\\nTurn 78: L \\\\\nTurn 79: L \\\\\nTurn 80: L \\\\\nTurn 81: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 75. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So, these are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,6), then body segments: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). That's 14 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (5,6) from below, so previous position was (5,5), but (5,5) is the first body segment, so it was moving up to (5,6).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks. The snake can move Up, Down, Left, Right, but cannot reverse direction instantly. Since head direction is Up, I cannot move Down next turn because that would be opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so I cannot move D on turn 76. Possible moves from (5,6): Up, Left, Right. Down is invalid because of no reverse.\n\nLet's list possible moves from (5,6):\n\n- Up: to (5,7)\n\n- Down: but invalid, reverse direction\n\n- Left: to (4,6)\n\n- Right: to (6,6)\n\nBut (5,7) is y=7, which is a border wall, so moving Up to (5,7) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6): x=6, y=6. Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x=7 and y=7 are walls, but x=6 is not a wall unless it's an obstacle. Border walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is fine. Similarly, y=6 is fine.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (6,6) is not an obstacle, so it should be free.\n\n(5,7): y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n\n(4,6): not a wall, not an obstacle.\n\n(6,6): not a wall, not an obstacle.\n\nBut I need to check if these cells are occupied by snake body.\n\nSnake positions: head (5,6), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nSo, (4,6) is not in the list, so empty.\n\n(6,6) not in list, empty.\n\n(5,7) is wall, invalid.\n\nDown to (5,5) is invalid because reverse and also (5,5) is body, but since it's the tail, moving there might be ok if the tail moves, but we have to be careful.\n\nCollision rules: moving into body segment is deadly, except for the tail, because when head moves to tail position, the tail moves away, so no collision if it's the tail.\n\nIn this case, (5,5) is the first body segment, which is the neck, not the tail. Tail is (1,5).\n\nLet's list snake positions in order: head: (5,6), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) so tail is (1,5).\n\nSo from head (5,6), moving to (5,5) would be moving to the neck position, which is occupied, so that would be a body collision, deadly. Similarly, moving to any body segment except the tail is deadly.\n\nBut (5,5) is not the tail; tail is (1,5). So moving to (5,5) would collide with body.\n\nTherefore, from (5,6), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (5,7) - wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (5,5) - body collision, invalid\n\n- Left: (4,6) - empty? Let's confirm cells.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n(4,6): not a wall, not an obstacle, not in snake positions, so should be free.\n\n(6,6): similarly free.\n\nSo only possible moves: Left to (4,6) or Right to (6,6).\n\nI cannot move Down because of reverse and collision.\n\nNow, food: (6,5) is at (6,5), which is below current head? Head is (5,6), so (6,5) is down-right? Directions: U (y+1), D (y-1), L (x-1), R (x+1).\n\nSo (6,5) from (5,6) is R and then D? No, adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (5,6), adjacent cells:\n\n- (5,7) U\n\n- (5,5) D\n\n- (4,6) L\n\n- (6,6) R\n\n(6,5) is not adjacent to (5,6); (5,6) to (6,5) is diagonal, not adjacent, so not directly reachable in one move.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is far away, (2,6) is at (2,6), which might be reachable.\n\nFirst, I need to plan multiple moves.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (6,5) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nCurrent turn is 75, so for (6,5), life span 3, it will disappear after turn 75 + 3 - 1? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L.\n\nFor example, at turn 75, life span 3, countdown is 3, decreases to 2 on turn 76, to 1 on turn 77, to 0 on turn 78, so disappears after turn 78, meaning not available on turn 79.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life span 5: at turn 75, countdown 5, disappears after turn 80.\n\n(2,6) life span 8: disappears after turn 83.\n\nNow, I need to think about eating food but avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, immediate move: from (5,6), I can go Left to (4,6) or Right to (6,6).\n\nIf I go Right to (6,6), that is closer to the food at (6,5), which is below (6,6). From (6,6), I can go Down to (6,5) to eat it, but (6,5) has life span 3, so it will be available for turns 75,76,77, and disappear on turn 78.\n\nSince we're on turn 75, I can eat it on turn 76 or 77.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach it.\n\nIf I move to (6,6) on turn 76, then on turn 77, I can move Down to (6,5) to eat it, if it's still there.\n\nBut when I eat, snake grows, so length increases.\n\nAlso, need to check for dangers.\n\nAnother food at (3,2), which is where? (3,2) is a food, but in snake positions, (3,2) is occupied by a body segment. Snake has (3,2) as the 8th segment? Positions: index 0: head (5,6), 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,4), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,2), 8: (3,2), yes, (3,2) is a body segment.\n\nBut food at (3,2) with value 1 and life span 5.\n\nNow, the rule about food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo (3,2) has food, but it's under the snake body now. To eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (3,2), and then head moves there.\n\nBut currently, segment at (3,2) is part of body. When the snake moves, the body segments follow.\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, tail is at (1,5), not near head.\n\nFirst, for the immediate move.\n\nI should simulate the grid.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (5,6), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail.\n\nSo snake occupies: let's list all positions:\n\n- Row y=6: (5,6) head\n\n- y=5: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\n- y=4: (3,4), (4,4), (1,4)\n\n- y=3: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (1,3)\n\n- y=2: (4,2), (3,2)\n\n- y=1: no snake? (1,2) is obstacle, not snake.\n\nSnake has (1,5) at y=5.\n\nAlso, (1,3) at y=3, (1,4) at y=4.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (6,5) at x=6,y=5\n\n- (3,2) at x=3,y=2, but occupied by snake body\n\n- (2,6) at x=2,y=6\n\n(2,6) is at x=2,y=6, which is not occupied, I think. Snake positions: y=6 only (5,6), so (2,6) is free.\n\nBut internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,6) is not listed, so free.\n\nWalls are only borders and those points.\n\nNow, for move from (5,6) on turn 76.\n\nOptions: L to (4,6) or R to (6,6)\n\nIf I go R to (6,6), then I am at (6,6), head direction now R.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,5) or (6,7) or (5,6) or (7,6), but (7,6) is x=7 wall, invalid; (6,7) y=7 wall invalid; (5,6) is previous head position, but now it's occupied by the neck, which will move? After move to (6,6), the snake body: head moves to (6,6), so body segment 1 (previously (5,5)) moves to (5,6), segment 2 (4,5) moves to (5,5), and so on. Tail (1,5) moves to (1,4) or something.\n\nLet's simulate one move.\n\nSuppose turn 76: move R to (6,6)\n\nThen new positions: head (6,6), then body: the first body segment is now at (5,6) (previous head), then (5,5) (previous segment 1), (4,5) (previous seg2), (3,5) (seg3), (3,4) (seg4), (4,4) (seg5), (4,3) (seg6), (4,2) (seg7), (3,2) (seg8), (3,3) (seg9), (2,3) (seg10), (1,3) (seg11), (1,4) (seg12), and tail was (1,5), which moves to (1,4)? No.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo after move to (6,6):\n\n- Head: (6,6)\n\n- Seg1: previous head (5,6)\n\n- Seg2: previous seg1 (5,5)\n\n- Seg3: previous seg2 (4,5)\n\n- Seg4: previous seg3 (3,5)\n\n- Seg5: previous seg4 (3,4)\n\n- Seg6: previous seg5 (4,4)\n\n- Seg7: previous seg6 (4,3)\n\n- Seg8: previous seg7 (4,2)\n\n- Seg9: previous seg8 (3,2)\n\n- Seg10: previous seg9 (3,3)\n\n- Seg11: previous seg10 (2,3)\n\n- Seg12: previous seg11 (1,3)\n\n- Seg13: previous seg12 (1,4)\n\n- Tail: previous seg13 (1,5)? Original snake has 14 segments: positions 0 to 13.\n\nIndex: 0: head, 1 to 13: body.\n\nAfter move, new head at (6,6), new seg1 at old head (5,6), new seg2 at old seg1 (5,5), ..., new seg13 at old seg12 (1,4), and old seg13 (1,5) is no longer part of snake, so tail is now at (1,4)? New tail is new seg13 at old seg12 position (1,4).\n\nLet's list old positions:\n\nIndex: 0: (5,6), 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,4), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (3,3), 10: (2,3), 11: (1,3), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,5)\n\nAfter move R to (6,6):\n\n- New head: (6,6)\n\n- New seg1: old pos0 (5,6)\n\n- New seg2: old pos1 (5,5)\n\n- New seg3: old pos2 (4,5)\n\n- New seg4: old pos3 (3,5)\n\n- New seg5: old pos4 (3,4)\n\n- New seg6: old pos5 (4,4)\n\n- New seg7: old pos6 (4,3)\n\n- New seg8: old pos7 (4,2)\n\n- New seg9: old pos8 (3,2)\n\n- New seg10: old pos9 (3,3)\n\n- New seg11: old pos10 (2,3)\n\n- New seg12: old pos11 (1,3)\n\n- New seg13: old pos12 (1,4)\n\nOld pos13 (1,5) is vacated, so tail is now (1,4)\n\nSnake has 14 segments, so after move, still 14 segments, no food eaten.\n\nNow, food at (6,5) is still there, life span decreases to 2 on turn 76.\n\nFrom (6,6), possible moves on turn 77:\n\nHead at (6,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nCannot move L (reverse) to (5,6), but (5,6) is now occupied by seg1, so if I move L to (5,6), it would collide with body, deadly.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: (6,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n\nD: (6,5) - is this free? (6,5) is a food position, and not occupied by snake now? After move, snake positions: head (6,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (5,5), etc., so (6,5) not occupied, and not wall, so free.\n\nL: (5,6) but occupied by seg1, collision\n\nR: (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid\n\nSo only possible move Down to (6,5), which has food.\n\nIf I move D to (6,5) on turn 77, I eat the food, since it's positive, snake grows to 15 segments.\n\nWhen eating, the head moves to (6,5), and the tail does not move, so new segment added at tail position? Standard snake: when eat food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, on turn 77, move to (6,5), which is food, so eat it, value +1, length +1.\n\nNew snake: head at (6,5), body: previous head (6,6) becomes neck, then previous body, and tail stays or new segment.\n\nAfter move without eating: head to new position, body follows, tail moves away.\n\nWith eating: head moves to food, body follows as usual, but tail does not move, so the previous tail position has a new segment, so length increases.\n\nSo here, on turn 77, move to (6,5):\n\n- Head: (6,5)\n\n- New segment at previous tail: previous tail was at (1,4), so new segment added there? No.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Before move, turn 76 positions: head (6,6), seg1 (5,6), ..., seg13 (1,4), tail is seg13 at (1,4)\n\nWhen head moves to (6,5) and eats food:\n\n- Head moves to (6,5)\n\n- The body segments move: seg1 moves to old head (6,6), seg2 to old seg1 (5,6), ..., seg13 to old seg12 (1,3)? Let's see.\n\nOld positions turn 76: index 0: (6,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,3), 8: (4,2), 9: (3,2), 10: (3,3), 11: (2,3), 12: (1,3), 13: (1,4)\n\nAfter move to (6,5) with eat:\n\n- Head moves to (6,5)\n\n- Body: seg1 moves to old head (6,6)\n\n- seg2 moves to old seg1 (5,6)\n\n- seg3 moves to old seg2 (5,5)\n\n- ...\n\n- seg13 moves to old seg12 (1,3)\n\n- And a new segment is added at old tail position (1,4), so new seg14 at (1,4)\n\nNow, the food at (6,5) is eaten, so removed.\n\nLife span: on turn 77, it was available, eaten.\n\nBut (6,5) had life span 3, at turn 75 countdown 3, turn 76 countdown 2, turn 77 countdown 1, so on turn 77 it can be eaten before disappearing.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nIf I go right on turn 76 to (6,6), then on turn 77 I can eat (6,5) by moving down.\n\nBut when I move down to (6,5), head direction was R, moving D, which is not reverse, since reverse of R is L, not D. So allowed.\n\nThen I get +1 score.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nIf I go left on turn 76 to (4,6), what happens?\n\nTurn 76: move L to (4,6)\n\nThen new head at (4,6), direction L.\n\nSnake positions: head (4,6), seg1 at old head (5,6), seg2 at old seg1 (5,5), seg3 at old seg2 (4,5), ..., same body shift.\n\nNow from (4,6), possible moves on turn 77.\n\nHead at (4,6), direction L.\n\nCannot move R (reverse) to (5,6), which is now occupied by seg1.\n\nU: (4,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n\nD: (4,5) - is it free? (4,5) is old seg2 position, but after move, on turn 76, positions: head (4,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (4,5) — so (4,5) is occupied by seg3, so moving to (4,5) would collide with body.\n\nL: (3,6) - is it free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake positions: (4,6) head, (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), etc., so (3,6) not occupied, should be free.\n\nR: (5,6) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move Left to (3,6) on turn 77.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other areas.\n\nBut food (6,5) might not be reachable soon.\n\n(6,5) has short life, only until turn 77, so if I don't go right, I might miss it.\n\nTurn 75: countdown 3\n\nTurn 76: countdown 2\n\nTurn 77: countdown 1, available\n\nTurn 78: countdown 0, disappears\n\nSo only on turns 76 or 77 I can eat it.\n\nOn turn 76, from (5,6), if I go right to (6,6), I can eat on turn 77.\n\nIf I go left to (4,6), I cannot reach (6,5) by turn 77, since from (4,6) to (6,5) is not adjacent, and on turn 77 I move to (3,6) or something, not closer.\n\nSo if I want to eat (6,5), I should go right on turn 76.\n\nBut is there risk?\n\nAfter eating, snake is longer, which might be riskier.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,6), which has longer life, and (3,2) under body.\n\n(3,2) is under body, and it has life span 5, so disappears after turn 80.\n\nTo eat (3,2), I need to move the body away first.\n\nCurrently, (3,2) is occupied by body segment.\n\nIn turn 76 positions, if I go right, (3,2) is still occupied.\n\nAfter turn 76 move to (6,6), positions include seg9 at (3,2) still? Turn 76: after move R, positions: head (6,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (4,2), seg9 (3,2), etc.\n\nSo (3,2) occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left, (3,2) occupied.\n\nTo free (3,2), the snake needs to move so that the segment on (3,2) moves away.\n\nSince the snake moves, each turn the segments shift.\n\nFor example, if I go right on turn 76, then on turn 77 I eat (6,5), then positions: head (6,5), seg1 (6,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (3,5), seg6 (3,4), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,3), seg9 (4,2), seg10 (3,2), seg11 (3,3), seg12 (2,3), seg13 (1,3), seg14 (1,4) new tail.\n\n(3,2) is now seg10.\n\nOn turn 78, if I move from (6,5), head direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: from (6,5), cannot move U (reverse) to (6,6), which is seg1, collision.\n\nL to (5,5) - (5,5) is seg3? Positions: seg2 is (5,6), seg3 is (5,5), so (5,5) occupied.\n\nD to (6,4) - (6,4) is an internal obstacle! Walls include (6,4), so cannot move there.\n\nR to (7,5) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nU invalid as above.\n\nWhat? Only moves: L to (5,5) occupied, U to (6,6) occupied, D to (6,4) wall, R to (7,5) wall. All invalid? That can't be right.\n\nHead at (6,5), after eating, positions as above.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- U: (6,6) - occupied by seg1\n\n- D: (6,4) - obstacle, wall\n\n- L: (5,5) - occupied by seg3? Coordinates: from (6,5), left is (5,5)? x decreases, y same? U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nSo from (6,5):\n\n- U: (6,6) - occupied\n\n- D: (6,4) - obstacle (internal wall)\n\n- L: (5,5) - let's see, (5,5) is position of seg3 in the list above.\n\nAfter eating on turn 77: head (6,5), seg1 (6,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (4,5), etc.\n\nSo (5,5) is seg3, occupied.\n\n- R: (7,5) x=7, border wall, invalid.\n\nSo indeed, from (6,5), no possible moves! All adjacent cells blocked or occupied.\n\nThat means if I eat (6,5) on turn 77, I get stuck and die on next turn.\n\nHuge risk!\n\nTherefore, going to (6,6) and then eating (6,5) is suicidal.\n\nI must avoid that.\n\nSo I should not go right on turn 76.\n\nInstead, go left to (4,6).\n\nThen on turn 76: move L to (4,6)\n\nNew head (4,6), direction L.\n\nPositions: head (4,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (3,4), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (4,2), seg9 (3,2), seg10 (3,3), seg11 (2,3), seg12 (1,3), seg13 (1,4)  // since no eat, tail moves from (1,5) to (1,4)? Old tail was (1,5), not occupied now, new tail is seg13 at old seg12 (1,4)\n\nOld positions turn 75: seg12 (1,4), seg13 (1,5)\n\nAfter move: head to (4,6), seg1 to old head (5,6), seg2 to old seg1 (5,5), ..., seg12 to old seg11 (1,3), seg13 to old seg12 (1,4), old seg13 (1,5) vacated.\n\nNow on turn 77, from (4,6), as I thought earlier, only possible move is L to (3,6), since U and D blocked, R to (5,6) occupied.\n\nMove L to (3,6)\n\nThen new head (3,6), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow positions: head (3,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (3,5), seg6 (3,4), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,3), seg9 (4,2), seg10 (3,2), seg11 (3,3), seg12 (2,3), seg13 (1,3)\n\nNow, food at (2,6) is at (2,6), which is adjacent? From (3,6), (2,6) is left, so I can move to it on turn 78.\n\n(2,6) has life span 8, available.\n\nAlso, (2,6) is not occupied.\n\nBut let's see if I can move there.\n\nOn turn 78, head at (3,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: (3,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n\nD: (3,5) - occupied? Positions: seg5 is (3,5), so (3,5) occupied by seg5.\n\nL: (2,6) - free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake, should be free.\n\nR: (4,6) - occupied by seg1.\n\nSo only move L to (2,6).\n\nNow, (2,6) has food, positive, so I can eat it on turn 78.\n\nMove to (2,6), eat food, snake grows.\n\nNew head (2,6), body: seg1 to old head (3,6), seg2 to old seg1 (4,6), etc., and new segment at old tail position.\n\nOld tail was seg13 at (1,3), so new seg14 at (1,3).\n\nNow, after eating, head at (2,6), direction L (from previous move).\n\nNow possible moves on turn 79.\n\nFrom (2,6):\n\nU: (2,7) wall\n\nD: (2,5) - is it free? Let's see positions after eat on turn 78.\n\nAfter move to (2,6) with eat:\n\n- Head: (2,6)\n\n- Seg1: old head (3,6)\n\n- Seg2: old seg1 (4,6)\n\n- Seg3: old seg2 (5,6)\n\n- Seg4: old seg3 (5,5)\n\n- Seg5: old seg4 (4,5)\n\n- Seg6: old seg5 (3,5)\n\n- Seg7: old seg6 (3,4)\n\n- Seg8: old seg7 (4,4)\n\n- Seg9: old seg8 (4,3)\n\n- Seg10: old seg9 (4,2)\n\n- Seg11: old seg10 (3,2)\n\n- Seg12: old seg11 (3,3)\n\n- Seg13: old seg12 (2,3)\n\n- New seg14: old tail (1,3)  // since old seg13 was at (1,3), new segment there.\n\nNow, adjacent cells from (2,6):\n\nU: (2,7) wall\n\nD: (2,5) - not occupied? Snake has (2,3) seg13, (3,3) seg12, etc., no (2,5). Also, obstacles: (2,4) is an internal obstacle! Walls include (2,4), so (2,5) is not wall, but is it free? (2,5) not occupied, not obstacle, should be free.\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, so (2,5) is above it, not affected.\n\nL: (1,6) - not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake positions: (2,6) head, (3,6) seg1, (4,6) seg2, ..., no (1,6), so free.\n\nR: (3,6) occupied by seg1.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n\nCannot move U or R.\n\nNow, direction is L, so moving D or L are not reverse.\n\nNow, I need to think about the food at (3,2).\n\n(3,2) has food under body, currently occupied by seg11 at (3,2) in the above positions.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move the snake so that (3,2) is vacated and head moves there.\n\nLife span 5, at turn 75, disappears after turn 80, so available until turn 80.\n\nCurrent turn 78 after eating (2,6).\n\nTurn 78: I just ate (2,6), so turn 78 is done.\n\nNow on turn 79, I need to move from (2,6) to either (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nIf I go to (1,6), that might be risky because x=1, y=6, and walls.\n\n(1,6) is not wall, but let's see the area.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,6) is fine.\n\nBut snake is long, might get trapped.\n\nIf I go down to (2,5), then from there.\n\nBut (3,2) is at bottom left.\n\nPerhaps I should plan to free (3,2).\n\nCurrently, (3,2) is occupied by seg11.\n\nAs snake moves, the segment will move away.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (2,5) on turn 79.\n\nMove D to (2,5)\n\nThen new head (2,5), direction D.\n\nPositions: head (2,5), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (4,6), seg4 (5,6), seg5 (5,5), seg6 (4,5), seg7 (3,5), seg8 (3,4), seg9 (4,4), seg10 (4,3), seg11 (4,2), seg12 (3,2), seg13 (3,3), seg14 (2,3)\n\n(3,2) is now seg12.\n\nStill occupied.\n\nOn turn 80, from (2,5), possible moves.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction D.\n\nCannot move U (reverse) to (2,6), occupied by seg1.\n\nD: (2,4) - but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nL: (1,5) - free?

It doesn't specify, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 moves.\n\nt1=75, so from turn 76 to 80 or 81.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAlso, for the food at (3,2), it's not eaten, but I can't help it.\n\nPerhaps I can eat it if I move differently.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 76, go left to (4,6), then on turn 77 to (3,6), then on turn 78 to (2,6) eat, then on turn 79 at (2,6), instead of moving down or left, I have to, but both are ok.\n\nBut from (2,6), if I go to (1,6), then to (1,5), same.\n\nBut from (1,6), I can only go down.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps after eating (2,6), at (2,6), I can go down to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can only go left to (1,5), then from (1,5), go down to (1,4).\n\nFrom (1,4), on turn 81, head at (1,4), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves:\n\nU: (1,5) occupied\n\nD: (1,3) - may be occupied or not\n\nL: (0,4) wall\n\nR: (2,4) obstacle\n\nSo only D to (1,3) if free, but (1,3) is the tail position or something.\n\nPositions at turn 80: after moving to (1,5), as before.\n\nAfter turn 80 move to (1,5), positions: head (1,5), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,6), ..., seg14 (3,3) or something.\n\n(1,3) is occupied by seg14 or earlier.\n\nIn turn 80 positions: head (1,5), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (3,6), ..., up to seg14 at (3,3) or (2,3), but (1,3) is not occupied, since vacated.\n\nIn turn 79 positions at (2,5): head (2,5), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (3,6), ..., seg14 (2,3)  // from earlier\n\nAfter move to (1,5) on turn 80: head (1,5), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (3,6), ..., seg13 (3,2), seg14 (3,3)  // old seg14 (2,3) vacated, new seg14 at old seg13 (3,3)? Let's not complicate.\n\n(1,3) is free at this point.\n\nSo from (1,4) on turn 81, I can move D to (1,3), which is free.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut no food, so just surviving.\n\nFor the plan, I'll output the sequence for 5 turns.\n\nSo for turn 76: L\n\nTurn 77: L\n\nTurn 78: L\n\nTurn 79: D  (assume to (2,5))\n\nTurn 80: L  (to (1,5))\n\nThen for turn 81, I can add, but not necessary.\n\nSince the food (2,6) is eaten on turn 78, and others not, score +1.\n\nIf I had gone right, I would die, so this is better.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 76: L\n\nTurn 77: L\n\nTurn 78: L\n\nFor turn 79 and 80, I need to specify.\n\nSince on turn 79 at (2,6), I can go D or L, both similar, I can choose D.\n\nThen turn 80 to (1,5) with L.\n\nBut from (2,6) to (1,6) is L, then to (1,5) is D.\n\nBut in terms of action, it's fine.\n\nI think D on turn 79 is ok.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 76: L (left)\n\nTurn 77: L (left)\n\nTurn 78: L (left)  // eats food\n\nTurn 79: D (down)\n\nTurn 80: L (left)  // to (1,5)\n\nFor thinking ahead, I have 5 moves: 76 to 80.\n\nAlso, the head direction for no reverse, but in the moves, from turn 76 L, direction L, then turn 77 L, same direction, ok; turn 78 L, same; turn 79 D, from L, down is not reverse; turn 80 L, from D, left is not reverse, so all good.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and simulated possible moves 5+ turns ahead, considering food life spans, collision risks, and movement constraints. The key priorities are:\n- Avoid the deadly trap near (6,5), as moving right on turn 76 leads to inevitable death on turn 77 after eating.\n- Eat the accessible positive food at (2,6) before it disappears (life span 8, expires after turn 83), as it provides +1 score with minimal risk.\n- The food at (3,2) is under the snake's body and cannot be eaten before it disappears (life span 5, expires after turn 80) due to body occupancy and limited time.\n- The food at (6,5) is too risky to pursue (short life span and lethal surroundings) and is skipped to prioritize survival.\n- After eating (2,6), the snake moves downward to avoid the congested left wall and maintain maneuverability.\n\n### Move Sequence Justification:\n- **Turn 76 (from (5,6))**: Move Left to (4,6) to avoid the death trap near (6,6) and (6,5). Moving right would lead to a dead end on turn 77. Only left is safe.\n- **Turn 77 (from (4,6))**: Move Left to (3,6) as the only legal move (up/down blocked by walls or body, right blocked by body).\n- **Turn 78 (from (3,6))**: Move Left to (2,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 15). This is the only legal move, and (2,6) is safe with long life span.\n- **Turn 79 (from (2,6))**: Move Down to (2,5) to avoid the left wall area and create space for future moves. Moving left to (1,6) is possible but risks congestion near obstacles; down is better for long-term pathing.\n- **Turn 80 (from (2,5))**: Move Left to (1,5) as the only legal move (up blocked by body, down blocked by wall at (2,4), right blocked by body). This positions the snake to potentially access the lower-left area safely on future turns.\n\n### 5+ Turn Outlook:\n- **Beyond turn 80**: From (1,5), the snake can move down to (1,4) or up to (1,6) to explore open areas, avoiding known obstacles. With no immediate food, survival is key; new food may spawn, allowing future scoring. The path remains open with no dead ends foreseen within 5+ turns.\n\nThis sequence safely scores +1 from (2,6) and avoids all collisions, with a viable survival path. The food at (3,2) and (6,5) are unattainable or too risky, so skipping them is optimal.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 75: L (left)  \nTurn 76: L (left)  \nTurn 77: L (left)  \nTurn 78: D (down)  \nTurn 79: L (left)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 76, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders. There are also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,6), and the body segments follow: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4). That's 14 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,6)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,6)\n\n- Segment 2: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 3: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 4: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 5: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 6: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 7: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 8: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 9: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 10: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 11: (2,3)\n\n- Segment 12: (1,3)\n\n- Segment 13: (1,4)  // tail\n\nSnake head direction is L, which is left, so moving left from (4,6) would be to (3,6), but let's see where it can go.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (6,5) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,2) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including this one. So for (6,5), life span 2, it will disappear after turn 77? Let's clarify life span.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (6,5) with life span 2:\n\n- On turn 76, life span 2, so it will be there for this turn and next turn? Or does it disappear after N turns from spawn?\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think it means that at the end of each turn, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nStandard interpretation: if life span is L on turn T, it will be available on turns T, T+1, ..., T+L-1, and disappear at the start of turn T+L.\n\nFor example, food with life span 2 on turn 76:\n\n- Available on turn 76 and 77.\n\n- Disappears at the start of turn 78.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life span 4: available turns 76,77,78,79, disappears turn 80.\n\n(2,6) life span 7: available turns 76 to 82.\n\n(4,4) life span 10: available turns 76 to 85.\n\nNow, current head position: (4,6), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: Since head direction is L (left), I can move left, up, or down, but not right because that would be instant reverse? No.\n\nMovement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R (right). So I cannot move right on this turn. But I can move U, D, or L.\n\nFrom (4,6), possible moves:\n\n- L: left to (3,6)\n\n- U: up to (4,7) but y=7 is wall, since border y=7 is wall. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=7 is wall, cannot move up.\n\n- D: down to (4,5)\n\n- R: right to (5,6), but cannot because instant reverse from L to R.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so moving R would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible actions: L to (3,6), or D to (4,5).\n\nU is to (4,7), which is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (4,5).\n\nNow, what is at (4,5)? Looking at snake positions: (4,5) is a body segment, specifically the third segment? Positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), ... so (4,5) is the fourth segment? Let's index:\n\n0: (4,6) head\n\n1: (5,6)\n\n2: (5,5)\n\n3: (4,5)\n\n4: (3,5)\n\netc.\n\n(4,5) is position of segment 3.\n\nIf I move down to (4,5), that's a body segment, but is it a collision?\n\nCollision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,5), which is not the tail; tail is (1,4). So it would be a collision with body, death.\n\nTherefore, moving D to (4,5) is invalid and deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (3,6): what is there? (3,6) is not in snake positions, and not wall? Let's check.\n\nFirst, walls: border x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(3,6) is within bounds: x=3, y=6, not border, not in obstacles. Snake positions: (3,5) is segment 4, (3,4) segment 5, (3,3) segment 10, (3,2) segment 9, etc. (3,6) not listed, so empty.\n\nSo moving L to (3,6) is possible.\n\nOnly one possible move? U is wall, D is body collision, R is instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only L to (3,6) is safe? But let's confirm the tail situation.\n\nAfter moving, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail moves off.\n\nCurrent tail is (1,4). After move, if head goes to (3,6), then:\n\nNew head: (3,6)\n\nThen body: previous head (4,6) becomes new segment 1, then (5,6) becomes seg2, (5,5) seg3, (4,5) seg4, (3,5) seg5, (3,4) seg6, (4,4) seg7, (4,3) seg8, (4,2) seg9, (3,2) seg10, (3,3) seg11, (2,3) seg12, (1,3) seg13, and tail (1,4) is gone? Let's see the sequence.\n\nSnake positions: [ (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) ]\n\nAfter moving left to (3,6):\n\nNew positions: head at (3,6), then the previous positions except the tail is removed? No, when moving without eating, snake moves to new head, and tail is cut off.\n\nStandard snake: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail segment is removed.\n\nSo new snake: head at (3,6), then segment 1 at (4,6) (previous head), segment 2 at (5,6) (previous seg1), segment 3 at (5,5) (previous seg2), segment 4 at (4,5) (previous seg3), segment 5 at (3,5) (previous seg4), segment 6 at (3,4) (previous seg5), segment 7 at (4,4) (previous seg6), segment 8 at (4,3) (previous seg7), segment 9 at (4,2) (previous seg8), segment 10 at (3,2) (previous seg9), segment 11 at (3,3) (previous seg10), segment 12 at (2,3) (previous seg11), segment 13 at (1,3) (previous seg12), and (1,4) is gone.\n\nPrevious seg12 is (1,3), so new tail is at (1,3)? Let's list new positions:\n\n- Head: (3,6)\n\n- Seg1: (4,6)  // previous head\n\n- Seg2: (5,6)  // previous seg1\n\n- Seg3: (5,5)  // previous seg2\n\n- Seg4: (4,5)  // previous seg3\n\n- Seg5: (3,5)  // previous seg4\n\n- Seg6: (3,4)  // previous seg5\n\n- Seg7: (4,4)  // previous seg6\n\n- Seg8: (4,3)  // previous seg7\n\n- Seg9: (4,2)  // previous seg8\n\n- Seg10: (3,2)  // previous seg9\n\n- Seg11: (3,3)  // previous seg10\n\n- Seg12: (2,3)  // previous seg11\n\n- Seg13: (1,3)  // previous seg12, new tail\n\nPrevious seg12 was (1,3), and it was not tail; tail was (1,4). After move, since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the last segment is gone, and new tail is the previous second last segment.\n\nIn the list, positions 0 to 13, 14 segments? Count: indices from 0 to 13, that's 14 positions.\n\n(4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4) — that's 14 cells.\n\nAfter move to (3,6) without eating, new head at (3,6), then the first body segment at old head (4,6), then old seg1 at (5,6), old seg2 at (5,5), ..., up to old seg12 at (1,3), and old tail (1,4) is gone. So new snake has 13 segments: from (3,6) to (1,3).\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Head: (3,6)\n\n- Body: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) // tail\n\n(1,3) is the tail.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,6) is safe because it's empty.\n\nNow, back to choices: only L is possible this turn? U is wall, D is body collision, R not allowed.\n\nBut let's confirm D: (4,5) is occupied by segment 3, which is not tail, so collision.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for turn 76, I must move L to (3,6).\n\nBut the problem is to think 5+ turns ahead and maximize score.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, food is present, but at (4,4) there is food, but it's under the snake body.\n\nFood at (4,4) is listed, and in snake positions, (4,4) is segment 6.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSo for (4,4), it's currently occupied by snake, so I can't eat it now; I need to move the body away first.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (6,5), (3,2), (2,6)\n\n(3,2) is also under snake? Snake has (3,2) as segment 10? Positions: ... (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), ... so (3,2) is segment 10.\n\nFood at (3,2) with life span 4.\n\nBut it's under the snake, so similarly, need to move away to eat.\n\nOnly (6,5) and (2,6) are not under snake, I think.\n\n(6,5): is it occupied? Snake positions: (5,5) is segment 2, (4,5) segment 3, etc. (6,5) not listed, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6): not in snake positions, empty.\n\nFood at (4,4) and (3,2) are under snake body.\n\nNow, for turn 76, I have to move L to (3,6).\n\nThen, after that, head at (3,6), direction was L, but after move, new direction is L.\n\nNow, I need to plan for future turns.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders and internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: after move to (3,6), positions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n\nFood: (6,5) life 2, so available turn 76 and 77? Turn 76 current, life span 2, so available turn 76 and 77, disappears turn 78.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life 4, available turn 76,77,78,79\n\n(2,6) life 7, available 76 to 82\n\n(4,4) life 10, available 76 to 85\n\nBut (4,4) and (3,2) under snake, so not accessible immediately.\n\nNow, after turn 76, move to (3,6), head at (3,6), direction L.\n\nTurn 77: possible moves from (3,6).\n\nCurrent direction: after moving L, head direction is now L.\n\nPossible moves: not opposite, so not R. Can move U, D, L.\n\nU: up to (3,7) — but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD: down to (3,5) — what is there? Snake positions: after turn 76, (3,5) is segment 5? New positions: head (3,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (3,5), etc. So (3,5) is occupied by segment 5, not tail. Tail is (1,3). So moving to (3,5) would be body collision.\n\nL: left to (2,6) — is that possible? (2,6) is not wall, not snake? Snake has (2,3) segment 12, (1,3) tail, etc. (2,6) not listed, so empty.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,6) with life span 7.\n\nSo moving to (2,6) would eat the food, since it's positive, snake grows.\n\nIf I move to (2,6), I eat the food, so head moves to (2,6), and tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nNew head at (2,6), body: old head (3,6) becomes new seg1, then (4,6) seg2, (5,6) seg3, (5,5) seg4, (4,5) seg5, (3,5) seg6, (3,4) seg7, (4,4) seg8, (4,3) seg9, (4,2) seg10, (3,2) seg11, (3,3) seg12, (2,3) seg13, and tail remains? Since food eaten, no removal, add new segment at tail.\n\nAfter eating, the tail stays, so snake length increases.\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), and (1,3) still there, but (1,3) was tail, now it's not tail; the new tail is (2,3) or something.\n\nList: old positions before move: head (3,6), body: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n\nAfter moving to (2,6) and eating food:\n\nNew head: (2,6)\n\nNew body: (3,6) // old head\n\nThen (4,6) // old seg1\n\n(5,6) // old seg2\n\n(5,5) // old seg3\n\n(4,5) // old seg4\n\n(3,5) // old seg5\n\n(3,4) // old seg6\n\n(4,4) // old seg7\n\n(4,3) // old seg8\n\n(4,2) // old seg9\n\n(3,2) // old seg10\n\n(3,3) // old seg11\n\n(2,3) // old seg12\n\nAnd (1,3) // old tail, still there since growth.\n\nSo new tail is (1,3), and new segments: 15 total.\n\n(2,3) is still there, but it's not tail anymore; tail is (1,3).\n\nIn the list: positions from head (2,6) to tail (1,3), with (2,3) in between.\n\nNow, is this safe? Moving to (2,6) is empty, so yes.\n\nIf I don't move to (2,6), but I have to move somewhere.\n\nFrom (3,6), U and D not possible, only L to (2,6) or R, but R is opposite to current direction L? Current direction after turn 76 move is L, so moving R would be instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move from (3,6) is L to (2,6).\n\nIs that right? U: (3,7) wall, D: (3,5) occupied, L: (2,6) empty, R: (4,6) but (4,6) is occupied by seg1, which is body, not tail.\n\n(4,6) is segment 1, not tail, so moving R to (4,6) would be body collision.\n\nYes, so only L to (2,6) is possible, and it has food, so I eat it.\n\nThen for turn 77, I move to (2,6) and eat food.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 76, I must move L to (3,6).\n\nThen turn 77, from (3,6), only move L to (2,6), eat food, grow.\n\nNow turn 77, after eating, head at (2,6), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,6) for turn 78.\n\nCurrent direction L.\n\nPossible moves: not R (opposite). U, D, L.\n\nU: up to (2,7) — y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD: down to (2,5) — what is there? (2,5) not in snake positions? Snake: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n\n(2,5) not listed, and not wall? Walls: internal obstacles, (2,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so (2,5) is not obstacle, not border, not snake, so empty.\n\nL: left to (1,6) — (1,6) not wall, not snake? Snake has (1,3), (1,4) was gone, now tail is (1,3), but (1,6) not listed, so empty? But let's see x=1,y=6.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to7, (1,6) should be free unless obstacle. Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,6) not listed, so free.\n\nR: right to (3,6) — but (3,6) is occupied by body segment, specifically the first body segment after head. Head is (2,6), body starts with (3,6), so moving to (3,6) would be collision.\n\nAlso, R is opposite to current direction L? Current direction is L, so moving R is instant reverse, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: U invalid, L to (1,6), D to (2,5).\n\nL to (1,6) or D to (2,5).\n\nNow, (1,6) is empty, (2,5) empty.\n\nNo food at these points currently.\n\nFood: (6,5) has life span 2, on turn 76 and 77. Turn 77 is next turn? Let's clarify turns.\n\nTurn 76: current, we move to (3,6)\n\nTurn 77: from (3,6) to (2,6), eat food at (2,6)? Food at (2,6) is available, yes.\n\nAfter turn 77, head at (2,6), food eaten, so (2,6) food is consumed.\n\nNow for turn 78, food at (6,5) has life span 2 on turn 76, so on turn 77 it was available, but after turn 77, life span decreases.\n\nFood life spans:\n\nAt turn 76:\n\n- (6,5): life 2, available turn 76,77\n\n- (3,2): life 4, available 76,77,78,79\n\n- (2,6): life 7, available 76 to 82\n\n- (4,4): life 10, available 76 to 85\n\nOn turn 76, we move, no food eaten since we went to (3,6), no food there.\n\nThen turn 77: we move to (2,6), and eat the food there. So (2,6) food consumed.\n\nNow for turn 78, what food is available.\n\n(6,5): life span was 2 on turn 76, after turn 76, life span decreases to 1 for turn 77. After turn 77, life span decreases to 0, so it disappears, not available turn 78.\n\n(3,2): life 4 on turn 76, after turn 76, life 3 for turn 77; after turn 77, life 2 for turn 78, so available.\n\n(2,6) eaten, gone.\n\n(4,4): life 10 on turn 76, after turn 76, life 9 for turn 77; after turn 77, life 8 for turn 78, available but under snake body.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) under snake body? (3,2) is occupied by snake segment, specifically in new positions, after turn 77: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n\n(3,2) is a body segment, and food at (3,2) is there, but under snake.\n\nFor turn 78, from (2,6), I can move L to (1,6) or D to (2,5).\n\nNow, (1,6): empty, no food.\n\n(2,5): empty, no food.\n\nBut there is food at (6,5), but it disappears after turn 77, so not available turn 78.\n\nOther food under body.\n\nI need to think about accessing the food under body.\n\nFor example, food at (3,2) and (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is segment 8 in current positions after turn 77? Positions: index from head: 0:(2,6), 1:(3,6), 2:(4,6), 3:(5,6), 4:(5,5), 5:(4,5), 6:(3,5), 7:(3,4), 8:(4,4), 9:(4,3), 10:(4,2), 11:(3,2), 12:(3,3), 13:(2,3), 14:(1,3)\n\nSo (4,4) is segment 8, (3,2) is segment 11.\n\nTo eat (3,2) food, I need to move the snake so that (3,2) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4).\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger. If head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (1,3), head at (2,6), not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent means neighboring cells, up/down/left/right.\n\n(2,6) and (1,3): not adjacent, since |dx|=1, |dy|=3, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue now.\n\nFor turn 78, from (2,6), I can go to (1,6) or (2,5).\n\nIf I go to (1,6), that's left, direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go down or left or up, but up is wall.\n\nIf I go to (2,5), that's down, direction D.\n\nI need to consider the board and plan to reach the food.\n\nFood at (3,2) has life span 2 for turn 78? Life span: on turn 78, (3,2) has life span 2? Original life 4 on turn 76.\n\nAfter turn 76: consumed? No, not eaten. On turn 76, food not eaten, so after turn, life decreases.\n\nTurn 76: food available, not eaten, so after turn 76, life span decreases by 1.\n\nSimilarly after each turn.\n\nSo for (3,2): turn 76 life 4, available.\n\nAfter turn 76, life 3 for turn 77.\n\nTurn 77, not eaten (since we ate (2,6)), so after turn 77, life decreases to 2 for turn 78.\n\nAvailable turn 78 and 79.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4): turn 76 life 10, after turn 76 life 9, after turn 77 life 8 for turn 78, available many turns.\n\nNow, to eat (3,2), I need to free up that cell.\n\n(3,2) is currently occupied by segment 11.\n\nAs the snake moves, that segment will move away.\n\nFor example, if I move the head, the body will shift.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4).\n\nAlso, there might be other cells.\n\nI should think about the path to access food.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid with obstacles.\n\nGrid cells:\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7; y=0,7; internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo free cells except these and snake.\n\nBut snake moves.\n\nFor turn 78, from (2,6), options:\n\nOption 1: Move L to (1,6)\n\nThen head at (1,6), direction L.\n\nThen from (1,6), possible moves: U (1,7) wall invalid, D (1,5) , L (0,6) wall invalid, R (2,6) but (2,6) is previous head, now body, and instant reverse? Direction L, moving R opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only D to (1,5) possible? (1,5) not wall, not snake? Snake has (1,3), but (1,5) free, assuming no obstacle; obstacle at (1,2), not (1,5).\n\nSo move to (1,5).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nOption 2: from (2,6) move D to (2,5)\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction D.\n\nThen from (2,5), possible moves: U (2,6) but (2,6) is body, collision and instant reverse? Direction D, moving U opposite, not allowed.\n\nD to (2,4) but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,5), or R to (3,5)\n\nL to (1,5) or R to (3,5)\n\n(1,5) empty, (3,5) is snake segment? After turn 77, (3,5) is segment 6, occupied.\n\nSo moving to (3,5) collision.\n\nR to (3,5) not possible.\n\nL to (1,5) possible.\n\nD to (2,4) wall.\n\nU not allowed.\n\nSo only L to (1,5) from (2,5).\n\nBut from (2,6), if I move D to (2,5), then from (2,5) only L to (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (1,6) from (2,6), then from (1,6) only D to (1,5).\n\nSo in both cases, I end up at (1,5) on turn 78 or later.\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nTurn 78 from (2,6):\n\n- If move L to (1,6), then head (1,6), direction L\n\nThen turn 79 from (1,6): only D to (1,5), head (1,5), direction D\n\n- If move D to (2,5), head (2,5), direction D\n\nThen turn 79 from (2,5): only L to (1,5), head (1,5), direction L\n\nSo either way, by turn 79, head at (1,5), and direction depends on path.\n\nBut in both cases, I reach (1,5) by turn 79.\n\nFrom (2,6) turn 78 move to (1,6) or (2,5), then turn 79 move to (1,5).\n\nNow at (1,5), let's say after turn 79.\n\nFood at (3,2) available until turn 79, so on turn 79 it is available if I can eat it, but I'm at (1,5), not close.\n\nLife span: (3,2) available turn 78 and 79, disappears turn 80.\n\nOn turn 79, it is available, but I'm at (1,5), and (3,2) is at (3,2), which is not adjacent; I need multiple moves.\n\nAlso, (3,2) is still under snake? Not necessarily, as the snake moves, it might be free.\n\nLet's see the snake positions over time.\n\nFirst, after turn 77: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n\n(3,2) is occupied.\n\nOn turn 78, I move from (2,6) to, say, (1,6) or (2,5), but let's assume I go to (1,6) for now.\n\nTurn 78: move L to (1,6), no food, so snake moves: head to (1,6), tail (1,3) removed, new positions: head (1,6), body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)  // tail at (2,3)\n\n(3,2) still occupied.\n\nThen turn 79: from (1,6) move D to (1,5), no food, head to (1,5), tail removed: old tail (2,3) gone, new positions: head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)  // tail at (3,3)\n\n(3,2) still occupied, but now by the second last segment? Segments: head (1,5), seg1 (1,6), seg2 (2,6), ..., up to seg13 (3,2), seg14 (3,3) tail? List: positions: 0:(1,5), 1:(1,6), 2:(2,6), 3:(3,6), 4:(4,6), 5:(5,6), 6:(5,5), 7:(4,5), 8:(3,5), 9:(3,4), 10:(4,4), 11:(4,3), 12:(4,2), 13:(3,2), 14:(3,3) tail\n\nSo (3,2) is segment 13, not tail.\n\nTo free (3,2), I need the snake to move so that this segment moves away.\n\nFor example, if I move down or left from (1,5).\n\nAt (1,5), direction is D (since moved down from (1,6)).\n\nPossible moves: not U (opposite). D to (1,4), L to (0,5) wall, R to (2,5)\n\n(1,4): is it free? Not wall, not snake? Snake has (1,6), (1,5) is head, (1,4) not listed, but obstacle at (1,2), not (1,4), so free.\n\n(2,5) free.\n\nAlso, food at (3,2) available turn 79.\n\nBut (1,5) to (3,2) is not direct.\n\nIf I move to (1,4), then to (1,3) but (1,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nCurrent positions: head (1,5), tail at (3,3)\n\n(1,3) is free? Not in positions, so free.\n\nBut there is food at (3,2), which is occupied.\n\nAs I move, the body shifts.\n\nFor example, if from (1,5) I move D to (1,4), no food, head to (1,4), tail (3,3) removed, new positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)  // tail at (3,2)\n\nNow, (3,2) is tail, and there is food at (3,2), but it's under tail.\n\nTo eat it, I need the head to move to (3,2) after the tail moves away.\n\nBut if I move the head to (3,2) now, it might be dangerous because of tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, at this point, head at (1,4), tail at (3,2), not adjacent.\n\nIf I want to eat (3,2), I need the tail to move away first.\n\nFor example, if I move the head to (1,3) or (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nFrom (1,4), possible moves.\n\nHead at (1,4), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,5) but (1,5) is body, collision, and instant reverse? Direction D, moving U opposite, not allowed.\n\nD to (1,3), L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4) obstacle.\n\nSo only D to (1,3) possible? (1,3) is free, no food.\n\nMove to (1,3), no food, head to (1,3), tail (3,2) removed, new positions: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)  // tail at (4,2)\n\n(3,2) is now free, but food at (3,2) was available until turn 79, and this is turn 80? Let's track turns.\n\nTurn 76: move to (3,6)\n\nTurn 77: move to (2,6), eat food\n\nTurn 78: move to (1,6), no food\n\nTurn 79: move to (1,5), no food\n\nTurn 80: from (1,5) move to (1,4), no food  // I think I lost track.\n\nAfter turn 79: head at (1,5) (after moving from (1,6) to (1,5))\n\nThen turn 80: from (1,5) move to, say, (1,4)\n\nHead to (1,4), no food, tail (3,3) removed, new positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)  // tail at (3,2)\n\nThis is turn 80.\n\nFood at (3,2) was available until turn 79, so on turn 80, it has disappeared, since life span 4, available turn 76,77,78,79, gone turn 80.\n\nSo on turn 80, (3,2) is free but no food, and tail is there.\n\nI missed the food; it expired.\n\nSimilarly, the other food at (4,4) is still there, but under body.\n\n(4,4) in positions is segment 10 or something.\n\nPositions: head (1,4), tail (3,2), (4,4) is occupied.\n\nLife span long, so available later.\n\nBut I need to eat food to score.\n\nAnother food is (6,5), but it expired on turn 78.\n\nOn turn 78, (6,5) was not available.\n\nBack to turn 78, I have a choice to go to (2,5) instead of (1,6).\n\nFrom (2,6) turn 78, move D to (2,5).\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 79 from (2,5): only L to (1,5), as earlier.\n\nHead to (1,5), no food, direction L or D? Moved from (2,5) to (1,5), which is left, so direction L.\n\nThen same as before, to (1,4) etc.\n\nSo I end up in a similar position.\n\nBut at (2,5), I am closer to the bottom, but the food is at (3,2) which is below.\n\n(3,2) is at y=2, x=3.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle.\n\nOr to (1,5), then (1,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (3,2), I need to go down.\n\nBut from (2,5), I can only go to (1,5) because U is reverse, D to (2,4) wall, R to (3,5) occupied.\n\nSo no direct way.\n\nPerhaps I should have chosen different path earlier.\n\nFor turn 76, I had to move L to (3,6), no choice.\n\nTurn 77, only move L to (2,6), eat food.\n\nThen for turn 78, I have two choices: move to (1,6) or to (2,5).\n\nIf I move to (2,5), I am at (2,5), which is closer to (3,2) in terms of y-coordinate.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can then on turn 79 move to (1,5), or if possible, but not.\n\nOnly to (1,5).\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move to (1,4) or (2,5) but (2,5) is previous position.\n\nLet's assume turn 78: move D to (2,5)\n\nHead at (2,5), direction D.\n\nTurn 79: move L to (1,5), head at (1,5), direction L.\n\nNow at (1,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,6) but (1,6) is body, collision, and instant reverse? Direction L, moving R would be opposite, but U is not opposite.\n\nDirections: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction L, so opposite is R.\n\nMoving U or D is allowed.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (1,6): but (1,6) is occupied by body segment? After turn 79, positions: let's track.\n\nAfter turn 78: moved to (2,5), no food (since (2,5) no food), so snake moves: head to (2,5), tail removed, old tail was (2,3) or something.\n\nAfter turn 77: head (2,6), body (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) tail\n\nTurn 78: move D to (2,5), no food, so new head (2,5), body: old head (2,6) becomes seg1, then (3,6) seg2, (4,6) seg3, (5,6) seg4, (5,5) seg5, (4,5) seg6, (3,5) seg7, (3,4) seg8, (4,4) seg9, (4,3) seg10, (4,2) seg11, (3,2) seg12, (3,3) seg13, and tail (1,3) removed. New tail is (3,3)?

Also, if not occupied, but it is.\n\nIn positions after turn 79: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,6), etc., so (1,6) is not in positions, let's see.\n\nAfter turn 79: head at (1,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) tail\n\n(1,6) is free? Not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\n(1,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) free, (2,5) occupied, etc.\n\nFrom (1,5), direction L (left).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (1,6): free, not opposite, so allowed.\n\n- D to (1,4): free, allowed.\n\n- L to (0,5): x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- R to (2,5): but (2,5) is body segment, occupied, and moving R is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nBoth empty, no food.\n\nIf I move U to (1,6), then I go up, away from (3,2).\n\nIf I move D to (1,4), I go down towards (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so from (1,4), I can go to (1,3), then to (2,3) but (2,3) may be occupied or not.\n\nAfter moving to (1,4), positions change.\n\nBut food at (3,2) expired.\n\nFor long-term, I should go for (4,4) food.\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), currently occupied.\n\nLife span 10, available many turns.\n\nI can plan to free it and eat it.\n\nFor example, the snake is long, so I need to move in a way that the body moves away from (4,4).\n\nCurrently, after turn 77, (4,4) is segment 8.\n\nAs the snake moves, it will shift.\n\nBut to have (4,4) free, the segment that is there must move, and the head must be able to reach it.\n\nPerhaps I can move the head towards the food area.\n\nFor turn 78, from (2,6), if I move D to (2,5), then I am at (2,5), which is closer to (4,4) than (1,6).\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), (2,5) is at (2,5), distance |dx=2|, |dy=1|.\n\nFrom (1,6) it's farther.\n\nSo moving to (2,5) is better to reach the bottom left.\n\nThen from (2,5), turn 79 to (1,5), then from (1,5) move D to (1,4), then to (1,3), etc.\n\nBut (1,3) is free, then I can go to (2,3) but (2,3) is tail or body.\n\nAfter some moves, it will be free.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nFood at (4,4) can be eaten when free.\n\nFor example, on turn 80 or later.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead from turn 76.\n\nTurn 76,77,78,79,80,81.\n\nTurn 76: move L to (3,6)\n\nTurn 77: move L to (2,6), eat food\n\nTurn 78: let's choose D to (2,5) to go down.\n\nThen turn 79: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 80: from (1,5) move D to (1,4) (assume we go down)\n\nHead to (1,4), no food, new positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) tail? After move, tail removed.\n\nOld positions before turn 80: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) tail\n\nMove to (1,4), no food, so new head (1,4), body: old head (1,5) seg1, then (2,5) seg2, (2,6) seg3, (3,6) seg4, (4,6) seg5, (5,6) seg6, (5,5) seg7, (4,5) seg8, (3,5) seg9, (3,4) seg10, (4,4) seg11, (4,3) seg12, (4,2) seg13, and tail (3,2) removed. New tail is (4,2).\n\n(4,4) is still occupied as seg11.\n\nTo free (4,4), I need to move more.\n\nFrom (1,4), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,5) body, collision, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nD to (1,3), L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4) obstacle.\n\nSo only D to (1,3) possible.\n\nMove to (1,3), no food, head to (1,3), tail removed, new positions: head (1,3), body (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) tail\n\n(4,4) still occupied.\n\nThen from (1,3), can move D to (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nU to (1,4) body, collision, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nL to (0,3) wall.\n\nR to (2,3) or something, but (2,3) may be free.\n\n(2,3) not in positions, so free.\n\nBut direction: after moving D to (1,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: not U (opposite). D to (1,2) obstacle, L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3) free.\n\nSo move R to (2,3).\n\nThen and so on.\n\nEventually, (4,4) will be free when the segment moves away, but it will take time.\n\nTo maximize score, I should try to eat the available food.\n\nBut in this state, only the (2,6) food was eaten, and (3,2) expired.\n\nThere is also food at (4,4) and it has long life.\n\nAlso, the grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, the bottom left has obstacles at (1,2) and (2,4), so area around (1,3), (2,3) might be tricky.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can move to (2,3), then to (3,3) or (2,2) but (2,2) not obstacle, but (2,4) is obstacle, so (2,2) free? Obstacles: (1,2), so (2,2) free.\n\nBut let's not go too deep.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output the actions for a few turns.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to list actions for multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many.\n\nIt says \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut not how many. Probably for the immediate turns where decisions are made.\n\nSince for turn 76 and 77, only one choice, I can list those.\n\nFor turn 78, I have a choice.\n\nBut to maximize score, moving to (2,5) on turn 78 might be better to stay in the center or access other areas.\n\nIf I move to (1,6) on turn 78, I go to the top left, which has fewer options.\n\nFor example, from (1,6), to (1,5), then to (1,4), etc., similar but at y=6,7.\n\nU is wall, so I have to go down eventually.\n\nWhereas (2,5) is at y=5, so I can go down to y=4,3, etc.\n\nAlso, (4,4) is at y=4, so from (2,5) I am closer.\n\nSo for turn 78, I should move D to (2,5).\n\nThen for turn 79, move L to (1,5).\n\nThen for turn 80, from (1,5) move D to (1,4) or U to (1,6), but U to (1,6) is away, so D to (1,4) better.\n\nThen turn 81 from (1,4) move D to (1,3), etc.\n\nBut since the food at (3,2) is gone, I need to target (4,4).\n\n(4,4) can be eaten when free.\n\nFor example, after a few moves, when the body moves away.\n\nBut let's assume I output the actions.\n\nFor turn 76: L\n\nTurn 77: L ( to eat food)\n\nTurn 78: D ( to (2,5) )\n\nThen for turn 79: L ( to (1,5) )\n\nThen for turn 80: from (1,5) I can choose D to (1,4)\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the format is to list actions, and think ahead, but for now, I can list up to turn 80 or so.\n\nBut let's see if there is a way to eat another food soon.\n\nThere is food at (4,4) with long life, and it might become accessible.\n\nFor example, if I move the head to the right.\n\nFrom the current path, I am going left and down.\n\nAfter turn 79 head at (1,5), I can move R to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, and opposite direction not allowed.\n\nOr U to (1,6), then from there to (1,7) invalid, so to (1,5) again, loop.\n\nSo I have to go down.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, on turn 78, moving to (2,5) is better.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll list the actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 76: only L, so action L.\n\nTurn 77: only L, action L.\n\nTurn 78: I choose D to go down, action D.\n\nThen turn 79: from (2,5) only L to (1,5), action L.\n\nTurn 80: from (1,5), I can move D to (1,4) or U to (1,6). To go down, action D.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nAfter turn 79 move to (1,5), direction L.\n\nMove D to (1,4), so action D.\n\nThen turn 81: from (1,4) move to (1,3), action D, etc.\n\nBut for the box, I need to output.\n\nSince the food at (4,4) is important, I should move towards it.\n\nFrom (2,6) on turn 78, if I move D to (2,5), then on turn 79 to (1,5), then from (1,5) I can move U to (1,6), but that doesn't help.\n\nI have to accept that for now, I am moving to the bottom left.\n\nPerhaps later I can turn right.\n\nFor example, after reaching (1,3), I can move to (2,3), then to (3,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) may be occupied or not.\n\nBut let's stop and output.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 76: L\n\nTurn 77: L\n\nTurn 78: D\n\nTurn 79: L\n\nTurn 80: D  (from (1,5) to (1,4))\n\nTurn 81: D  (from (1,4) to (1,3))\n\nBut at (1,3), I can move to (2,3) on turn 82, etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can list from turn 76 to turn 80 or 81.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", probably 5 turns from now.\n\nTurn 76 to 80 is 5 turns.\n\nTurn 76,77,78,79,80.\n\nActions: 76:L, 77:L, 78:D, 79:L, 80:D\n\nBut on turn 80, from (1,5) to (1,4), action D.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if on turn 78 moving D is better.\n\nIf I move to (1,6) on turn 78, then turn 79 to (1,5), same as above, but from (1,6) to (1,5) is down, so at (1,5) direction D.\n\nThen move U not allowed, so to (1,4) or (1,6) but (1,6) body, so to (1,4) same.\n\nSo same position on turn 80.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nThe current state at turn 76 requires careful planning to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, with a focus on long-term survival. The snake must move left (L) to (3,6) on turn 76 due to constraints (up is a wall, down causes body collision, right is instant reverse). On turn 77, the only safe move is left (L) to (2,6), eating the positive food there (value +1, snake grows by 1 segment).\n\nFor turn 78, two moves are possible from (2,6): left (L) to (1,6) or down (D) to (2,5). Both paths lead to (1,5) by turn 79, but moving down (D) to (2,5) on turn 78 is prioritized because:\n- It positions the snake closer to the bottom-left area, where food at (3,2) (life span 4) is located, though this food expires after turn 79 and may not be reachable in time.\n- It avoids unnecessary movement toward the top-left corner (which has fewer options due to walls) and keeps the snake centered for better access to the remaining food at (4,4) (life span 10, available until turn 85).\n- Long-term, moving down facilitates exploration of the grid to reach (4,4) once it becomes free.\n\nAfter moving to (2,5) on turn 78, the only safe move on turn 79 is left (L) to (1,5) (up is instant reverse or invalid, down is a wall, right causes collision). On turn 80, from (1,5), moving down (D) to (1,4) is chosen to continue toward the bottom-left, avoiding instant reverse (up is opposite direction) and walls.\n\n#### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Access**: \n  - Food at (3,2) (life span 4) expires after turn 79 and cannot be eaten due to the snake's position and movement constraints. It is under the snake body until at least turn 80, by which time it disappears.\n  - Food at (4,4) (life span 10) is under the snake body but has a long life span. It can be targeted after a few turns when the body moves away. The plan is to navigate toward the center to access it later.\n  - Food at (6,5) expired after turn 77, and (2,6) was eaten on turn 77.\n- **Risks**: \n  - No immediate collision risks in the planned moves. Tail reward danger is not a concern, as the head and tail are not adjacent.\n  - Internal obstacles (e.g., (2,4)) and walls are avoided.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - Moving down on turn 78 keeps the snake in a more open area, reducing the risk of dead ends. The grid has obstacles at (1,2) and (2,4), so moving down and left allows the snake to loop back toward the center for future food access.\n  - After turn 80, the snake should aim to free up (4,4) by moving right or up when possible, but this requires more turns than the 5-turn plan.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 76 to 80)\nThe actions for the next 5 turns (76 to 80) are as follows:\n- **Turn 76**: Move left (L) to (3,6) – only safe option.\n- **Turn 77**: Move left (L) to (2,6) – eat food (+1 score), grow to 15 segments.\n- **Turn 78**: Move down (D) to (2,5) – prioritize positioning for long-term access to (4,4) food.\n- **Turn 79**: Move left (L) to (1,5) – only safe option from (2,5).\n- **Turn 80**: Move down (D) to (1,4) – continue toward bottom-left to avoid walls and open paths for future turns.\n\nThis sequence ensures survival for at least 5 turns and sets up opportunities to target the (4,4) food in later turns (e.g., by moving to (1,3), then (2,3), and eventually toward (4,4)).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 76: L\nTurn 77: L\nTurn 78: D\nTurn 79: L\nTurn 80: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 77, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 steps ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). I should avoid these cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,6), and the body segments follow: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). The head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to reach (3,6) from the previous position.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,5) with value 1 and life span 1. So it disappears after turn 77 + 1 = 78? Life span is given, and it decreases each turn including current. Life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (6,5), life span 1. On turn 77, life span is 1, so after this turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears. That means it must be eaten on turn 77 or it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) has life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 77 + 3 - 1? Countdown decreases every turn including current. So if life span is N on turn t, it will be gone by turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose a food spawns with life span N on turn S. Then on turn S, life span = N. After each turn, it decreases. When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for turn t, if life span is L, after this turn, it becomes L-1. If L-1 = 0, it disappears.\n\nFor (6,5): position (6,5), value 1, life span 1 on turn 77. So if not eaten on turn 77, after turn 77, life span becomes 0, and it disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 77.\n\nBut turn 77 is the current turn, and I need to decide the action for turn 77.\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t1: action on turn t1\", so for turn 77, I need to choose an action.\n\nSimilarly, other food:\n\n(3,2) value 1, life span 3, so it will last until turn 79? On turn 77, life span 3; after turn 77, 2; after turn 78, 1; after turn 79, 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 77, 78, or 79.\n\n(2,6) value 1, life span 6, so it will last until turn 82 or so.\n\n(4,4) value 1, life span 9, long time.\n\nAll food have value 1? In the list: (6,5,1,1), (3,2,3,1), (2,6,6,1), (4,4,9,1). The third number is value, all 1? But (6,5,1,1) – let's see the format: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nFor (6,5): (x,y) = (6,5), value=1, life_span=1\n\n(3,2): value=1, life_span=3\n\n(2,6): value=1, life_span=6\n\n(4,4): value=1, life_span=9\n\nAll food are positive, value +1, since no negative food mentioned. But in the core rules, there is negative food, but in this state, all are value 1, so positive.\n\nAlso, (4,4) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (4,4), which is part of the body. But food can spawn under the body, and it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSpecifically, for (4,4), food is there, but snake has a segment at (4,4). So to eat it, I need the segment to move away, and then head to move there.\n\nNow, snake head is at (3,6), direction L, so coming from right, moving left.\n\nPossible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since head direction is L, I cannot go R (right) immediately, as that would be opposite direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, meaning it was moving left to (3,6). So from (4,6) to (3,6), left.\n\nSo next move, I cannot go right, because that would be opposite to current direction.\n\nAllowed moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), but not R (right).\n\nNow, grid size: walls at borders, so x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but internal obstacles.\n\nList all blocked cells:\n\n- Borders: x=0, x=7 for all y? No, \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo cells to avoid: walls and snake body except tail when moving.\n\nFor movement, if head moves to a cell with wall or body, it dies. But tail is special: if head moves to the tail cell, it might be ok if tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body, it collides unless it's the tail and the tail moves away at the same time.\n\nIn this case, snake positions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). So tail is (1,3).\n\nLength of snake is 14 segments.\n\nNow, for turn 77, I need to choose action: U, D, L.\n\nL is left, to (2,6)? (3,6) left to (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) has food? Food at (2,6) with life span 6, value 1.\n\nBut let's see what cells are safe to move to.\n\nFirst, adjacent cells to head (3,6):\n\n- Up: (3,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n\n- Down: (3,5) – is this occupied? Snake positions: (3,5) is a body segment, yes, index 5? Positions list: index 0: (3,6) head, 1: (4,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (5,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (3,4), 7: (4,4), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,2), 10: (3,2), 11: (3,3), 12: (2,3), 13: (1,3) tail.\n\nSo (3,5) is position index 5, which is body, not tail. Tail is (1,3).\n\nSo moving down to (3,5) would collide with body, since (3,5) is occupied and not the tail.\n\n- Left: (2,6) – is this wall or body? x=2,y=6. Walls: borders, y=6 is not border, x=2 not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,6) not listed, so not obstacle. Snake body: positions don't include (2,6), so it should be free? Food is at (2,6), but that's fine, head can move to food.\n\n(2,6) has food, but moving there would eat it if possible.\n\n- Right: (4,6) – but (4,6) is body segment, index 1, and also, since current direction is L, I cannot move right, it's opposite direction. So not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: only left to (2,6)? But down is invalid, up is wall, right not allowed.\n\nUp is (3,7), y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n\nDown to (3,5) is body, occupied.\n\nLeft to (2,6) seems possible.\n\nBut (2,6) is not occupied, and not wall, so yes.\n\nNow, if I move left to (2,6), I eat the food there? (2,6) has food with value 1, life span 6.\n\nBut life span 6, so it won't disappear immediately.\n\nAlso, is there any risk?\n\nFirst, let's confirm if I can move to (2,6).\n\nSnake head at (3,6), move left to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is not wall, not body, so yes.\n\nAfter moving, the snake grows by one segment since it's positive food, so new head at (2,6), tail remains or moves? When eating, length increases, so tail doesn't move this turn? Standard snake mechanics.\n\nWhen snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so tail stays in place for that turn. Then next turn, when moving, tail moves.\n\nSequence: on each turn, the snake moves one step in direction, head to new cell. If that cell has food, it eats it, and the snake grows, so tail does not move (the segment is added). If no food, tail moves to the previous position, so length same.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (2,6) which has food, I eat it, so snake grows: new positions, head at (2,6), then the previous head (3,6) becomes second segment, and so on, up to tail (1,3) stays, since no tail movement when eating.\n\nPositions after move: new head at (2,6), then the old head (3,6) is now second segment, then (4,6), (5,6), etc., down to tail (1,3). Since eating, tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n\nNow, but I need to think about the food at (4,4) under the body.\n\nAlso, for turn 77, I have the food at (6,5) with life span 1, which must be eaten now or lost.\n\nBut (6,5) is at x=6,y=5.\n\nHead is at (3,6), so it's not adjacent; I can't reach it this turn.\n\nAdjacent cells: (3,6) to (6,5) is not adjacent, distance |3-6| + |6-5| = 3+1=4, so multiple moves away. I can't eat it this turn since it's not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) food at (3,2), which is occupied by snake segment? Snake has (3,2) at index 10.\n\n(3,2) is a body segment, and food is there, but I can only eat it if the segment moves away and head moves there.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4).\n\nBack to turn 77 moves.\n\nPossible actions: since head direction L, I can go U, D, or L.\n\nU: (3,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD: (3,5) occupied by body, invalid.\n\nL: (2,6) free, with food.\n\nR: not allowed, opposite direction.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (2,6).\n\nIs that right? (2,6) is free? Let me confirm.\n\nGrid: walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 all cells.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,6): x=2,y=6, not border, not in internal obstacles, so not wall.\n\nSnake positions: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). No (2,6), so free.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for turn 77, I must move left to (2,6) and eat the food there.\n\nBut is there a risk? Let's see the position after move.\n\nAfter moving to (2,6), head at (2,6), then segments: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). Tail at (1,3).\n\nSince I ate food, length is now 15, tail stays.\n\nNow, food at (6,5) with life span 1: since not eaten, after this turn, it disappears.\n\nLife span was 1 on turn 77, after turn 77, it becomes 0, disappears.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (3,2) life span 3, now on turn 78, it will be 2, etc.\n\n(4,4) life span 9, decreases to 8 after turn 77.\n\nNow, for turn 78, I need to choose next action.\n\nHead at (2,6), and head direction: I moved left to (2,6), so now direction is L (left).\n\nCurrent head position (2,6), came from (3,6), so moving left.\n\nNow possible moves: U, D, L, but not R (right).\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (2,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- Down: (2,5) – is this free? x=2,y=5. Walls: not border, internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed, so not obstacle. Snake body: positions after turn 77: head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). So (2,5) not in list, so free.\n\n- Left: (1,6) – x=1,y=6. Walls: not border, internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,6) not, so not wall. Snake body: no (1,6), so free? But let's see, tail is at (1,3), but (1,6) different.\n\n- Right: (3,6) – but (3,6) is now the second segment, occupied, and also, since direction is L, moving right is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: down to (2,5) or left to (1,6).\n\nNow, food available: after turn 77, (6,5) disappeared.\n\n(3,2) at (3,2) with life span now 2 (since after turn 77, decreased from 3 to 2).\n\n(2,6) we just ate, so gone.\n\n(4,4) at (4,4) with life span 8 (was 9, decreased to 8).\n\nAlso, (3,2) is occupied by snake body at (3,2), which is index 10 in previous positions, but after growth, positions: head (2,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (5,6), seg4 (5,5), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (3,5), seg7 (3,4), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (4,3), seg10 (4,2), seg11 (3,2), seg12 (3,3), seg13 (2,3), seg14 (1,3). So (3,2) is seg11, body segment.\n\nFood at (3,2), but occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is seg8, occupied.\n\nTo eat (3,2), I need the body to move away from (3,2) and then head to move there.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4).\n\nNow for turn 78, head at (2,6), direction L.\n\nOptions: down to (2,5) or left to (1,6).\n\n(1,6): let's see if it's safe. (1,6) is free, as above.\n\nBut I need to think ahead to eat the food under the body.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving to (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nI should think about accessing the food at (3,2) or (4,4).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), which is below.\n\nCurrent head (2,6), so (2,5) is directly below.\n\nIf I go down to (2,5), then head at (2,5), direction down.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,4), but (2,4) is internal obstacle! Walls include (2,4), so (2,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nFrom (2,5), adjacent cells: up (2,6) occupied, down (2,4) wall, left (1,5), right (3,5).\n\n(1,5): x=1,y=5, not border, not internal obstacle (internal: (1,2) but different y), so free? But need to check snake.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is occupied, as per positions.\n\nAfter moving to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). Tail at (1,3).\n\nSince no food at (2,5), tail moves? When moving without eating, tail moves.\n\nIn this case, moving to (2,5), no food there, so tail moves away from (1,3).\n\nSo positions: head to (2,5), then the body: previous head (2,6) becomes second, (3,6) third, ..., up to (2,3) which was seg13, now seg14, and tail (1,3) is removed? Standard: the tail moves, so the last segment is removed.\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), then segments: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3). Tail at (2,3).\n\nLength 15, no growth.\n\nNow, from (2,5), possible moves: up (2,6) occupied, down (2,4) wall, left (1,5), right (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is occupied, as above, (3,5) is in positions.\n\n(1,5): is it free? Not wall, not in snake positions above, so free.\n\nSo can go left to (1,5) or right to (3,5) but occupied, invalid, so only left to (1,5).\n\nThen from (1,5), and so on.\n\nBut this seems constrained.\n\nBack to turn 78 at (2,6).\n\nOption to go left to (1,6).\n\n(1,6): free, as established.\n\nMove to (1,6), no food there, so tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3). Tail at (2,3)? Positions after move: head (1,6), then previous head (2,6) becomes second, (3,6) third, ..., (2,3) is the last body segment, and tail was (1,3), which is removed, so tail at (2,3).\n\nSegments: indices: after growth turn 77, we had 15 segments: (2,6), (3,6), ..., (1,3)\n\nWhen move without eating, head to new cell, tail removed.\n\nSo from (2,6) move to (1,6), head at (1,6), then body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3). And (1,3) is removed, so tail at (2,3).\n\nNow, from (1,6), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: U (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid; D (1,5) free?; L (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid; R (2,6) occupied, and opposite direction? Direction is left, so moving right is opposite, not allowed.\n\nCurrent head direction: I moved left to (1,6), so direction L.\n\nSo cannot move right to (2,6).\n\nPossible: down to (1,5) or up invalid, left invalid, so only down to (1,5).\n\nThen to (1,5), and so on.\n\nNow, in both cases, from (2,6) I can only go to (2,5) or (1,6), and then to (1,5) or similar, but I need to access the food.\n\nPerhaps I should go towards the area where food is under body.\n\nFood at (3,2) and (4,4).\n\n(3,2) is at bottom left, (4,4) is center.\n\nCurrent head at (2,6), top left.\n\nAlso, tail is at (1,3) or after moves, but I need to free up the cells with food.\n\nFor example, to eat (3,2), I need the snake to move so that the segment at (3,2) moves away, and then head can move to (3,2).\n\nSimilarly for (4,4).\n\nBut (4,4) is deeper in the body.\n\nLet's see the snake shape. From positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), then down to (5,5), left to (4,5), down to (3,5)? (4,5) to (3,5) is left, then (3,5) to (3,4) down, then (3,4) to (4,4) right, then (4,4) to (4,3) down, then (4,3) to (4,2) down, then (4,2) to (3,2) left, then (3,2) to (3,3) up? (3,2) to (3,3) is up, y from 2 to 3, so up? y=2 to y=3, increasing y, so up if y up is north.\n\nCoordinates: usually y increases up or down? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y increases north.\n\nSo (3,2) to (3,3) is up, then (3,3) to (2,3) left, then (2,3) to (1,3) left.\n\nSo the snake has a loop or something.\n\nTo free (3,2), which has food, I need the segment at (3,2) to move.\n\nCurrently, after turn 77, segment at (3,2) is the 11th segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves, that segment will move only if the tail moves past it or something, but it will move when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if I move the head, the body segments follow.\n\nSo after a few moves, the segment at (3,2) will be at a different position.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4).\n\nBut the food is on the cell, so when the snake moves away from that cell, the food is exposed, and then head can move to it.\n\nBut I need to plan the path so that head can reach it after it's exposed.\n\nAlso, for (3,2), life span 2 on turn 78, so it will disappear after turn 79 if not eaten.\n\nOn turn 78, life span 2, after turn 78, becomes 1, after turn 79, becomes 0, disappears. So must be eaten by turn 79.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) has longer life.\n\nSo priority to eat (3,2) soon.\n\nNow, to expose (3,2), I need the body to move away from it.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (3,2) is between (4,2) and (3,3). In the sequence: (4,2) to (3,2) left, then (3,2) to (3,3) up.\n\nSo when the snake moves, if the head moves in a way that the body shifts, (3,2) will be vacated after some moves.\n\nFor example, if the head moves, the body segments move one step towards the head.\n\nSo the position (3,2) will be occupied by the next segment in line.\n\nLet's think of the body as a chain.\n\nWhen the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo for the cell (3,2), it will be vacated when the segment that was there moves to the next position.\n\nIn the current configuration, the segment at (3,2) will move to where the segment in front of it was, which is (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) will move to where (2,3) was, and so on.\n\nBut to vacate the cell (3,2), I need the segment that was at (3,2) to move away, and no other segment to move there immediately, but since it's a chain, when a segment moves from a cell, it might be filled by another segment or not, depending on the path.\n\nIn this case, since the snake is connected, when the head moves, the entire body shifts, so the cell (3,2) will be occupied by the segment that was at (4,2), because the segment at (4,2) moves to (3,2), and the segment at (3,2) moves to (3,3), etc.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nSuppose at turn 78, I move from (2,6) to (2,5) down.\n\nThen new positions: head at (2,5), then body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nTail at (2,3), since (1,3) removed.\n\nNow, the cell (3,2) is still occupied, by the segment that was previously at (4,2), which moved to (3,2)? Let's see: in the new positions, the 12th segment is at (3,2), which was previously the 11th segment at (3,2), but in the list, after move, positions: index 0: (2,5) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (5,6), 5: (5,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (3,4), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,3), 11: (4,2), 12: (3,2), 13: (3,3), 14: (2,3) tail.\n\nSo (3,2) is still occupied by index 12.\n\nSimilarly, the food is still under it, not exposed.\n\nIf I move to (1,6) instead.\n\nFrom (2,6) move left to (1,6).\n\nHead at (1,6), body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) tail.\n\n(3,2) occupied by index 11.\n\nStill occupied.\n\nI need to move in a way that the body shifts so that (3,2) is vacated.\n\nFor example, if I can move the head such that the segment at (3,2) moves and no one replaces it immediately.\n\nBut since the snake is dense, it might be hard.\n\nPerhaps I should move towards the tail area to create space.\n\nAnother idea: the tail is at (1,3), and I can move to free cells near there.\n\nBut let's list free cells.\n\nCurrent grid after turn 77: head (2,6), body as above.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) is tail but will move, (2,5), (3,5) occupied, etc.\n\nAlso, (6,5) gone, (2,6) eaten, so food left: (3,2), (4,4), (2,6) eaten, (6,5) gone, so (3,2) and (4,4).\n\n(3,2) at (3,2), occupied.\n\n(4,4) at (4,4), occupied.\n\nOther cells: for example, (0,6) wall, (1,6) free, (2,6) occupied, (3,6) occupied, (4,6) occupied, (5,6) occupied, (6,6) but x=6,y=6, border? x=7 is border, x=6 not border, y=6 not border. Walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So (6,6) is not border, internal obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,6) not, so free? But snake has (5,6), so not occupied? (5,6) is occupied, (6,6) free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) but food gone, so free if not occupied.\n\n(6,5) was food, but gone, so cell free.\n\nSimilarly, (7,5) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\n etc.\n\nBut I need to plan to eat (3,2) within two turns.\n\nLife span for (3,2): on turn 78, life span 2, so after turn 78, it becomes 1, after turn 79, 0, so must be eaten on turn 78 or 79.\n\nOn turn 78, if I can move to (3,2), but it's occupied, so I can't.\n\nOn turn 79, if it's free, I can.\n\nSo I need to vacate (3,2) by turn 79.\n\nThat means on the move of turn 78, after the move, (3,2) should be free, or at least by turn 79 it is free.\n\nLet's see the body movement.\n\nThe segment at (3,2) will move based on the head movement.\n\nCurrently, after turn 77, the segment at (3,2) is connected to (4,2) behind and (3,3) in front? In the sequence, it is between (4,2) and (3,3).\n\nThe body segments are ordered from head to tail.\n\nSo from head (2,6) to tail (1,3), the segments are in order.\n\nThe segment at (3,2) has previous segment at (4,2) and next segment at (3,3)? No.\n\nIn the list, the segments are: index 0: head (2,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (5,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (3,5), 7: (3,4), 8: (4,4), 9: (4,3), 10: (4,2), 11: (3,2), 12: (3,3), 13: (2,3), 14: (1,3) tail.\n\nSo for segment at index 11: (3,2), it is preceded by index 10: (4,2), and succeeded by index 12: (3,3).\n\nWhen the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nSpecifically, when the head moves to a new cell, the segment that was at index 1 moves to where the head was, index 2 moves to where index 1 was, and so on, up to the tail.\n\nFor the cell (3,2), it is currently occupied by index 11.\n\nAfter the head moves, index 11 will move to where index 10 was, which is (4,2).\n\nThen the cell (3,2) will be occupied by the segment that was at index 12, which moves to where index 11 was, so to (3,2).\n\nLet's see: after head moves to a new cell, the new position of each body segment is the old position of the segment before it.\n\nFor example, after head moves to new position, new index 1 is old index 0 position, new index 2 is old index 1 position, ..., new index k is old index k-1 position, for k from 1 to 14, and the new tail is old index 13 position or something.\n\nOld positions: index 0 to 14.\n\nNew head at new cell.\n\nThen new index 1 is old index 0 position.\n\nNew index 2 is old index 1 position.\n\nNew index 3 is old index 2 position.\n\n...\nNew index 11 is old index 10 position.\n\nNew index 12 is old index 11 position.\n\nNew index 13 is old index 12 position.\n\nNew index 14 is old index 13 position.\n\nAnd the old index 14 position is vacated if no growth.\n\nFor cell (3,2), it was old index 11 position.\n\nAfter move, new index 12 is at old index 11 position, which is (3,2).\n\nSo the cell (3,2) is now occupied by new index 12, which is the segment that was at old index 11, but the position is still occupied.\n\nSimilarly, it remains occupied until the tail moves past it.\n\nTo vacate (3,2), I need the segment that was there to move away and no segment to move to it, but since the snake is continuous, the only way to vacate a cell is when the tail moves away from it and the body doesn't loop back.\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (1,3), which is near (3,3), so (3,2) is not the tail.\n\nThe cell (3,2) will be vacated when the tail is at that position and moves away.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,3), so it will take several moves for the tail to reach (3,2).\n\nFor example, the distance from tail to (3,2) in the chain.\n\nFrom tail (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3) to (3,2), so three segments away.\n\nSo when the snake moves, the tail moves first, so after three moves, the tail will be at (3,2), and when it moves away, (3,2) is vacated.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAt turn 77, tail at (1,3).\n\nAfter turn 78 move, tail moves to (2,3) if no growth, but depending on move.\n\nAssume no eating for now.\n\nAfter turn 77, positions with 15 segments.\n\nAfter turn 78 move, if no eat, tail removed, new tail at old index 13 position, which was (2,3), so tail at (2,3).\n\nThen after turn 79 move, new tail at old index 13 position, which was (3,3) in turn 78 positions.\n\nLet's define.\n\nAt start of turn 78, positions: P = [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)]\n\nIndex 0 to 14.\n\nIf head moves to new cell, say (2,5), no food.\n\nThen new positions: head at (2,5), then new body: old P[0] to P[13], so new index 1: P[0] = (2,6), new index 2: P[1] = (3,6), ..., new index 11: P[10] = (4,2), new index 12: P[11] = (3,2), new index 13: P[12] = (3,3), new index 14: P[13] = (2,3)\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\nCell (3,2) is occupied by new index 12.\n\nIf head moves to (1,6), new head (1,6), new index 1: P[0] (2,6), new index 2: P[1] (3,6), ..., new index 11: P[10] (4,2), new index 12: P[11] (3,2), new index 13: P[12] (3,3), new index 14: P[13] (2,3)\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\n(3,2) still occupied.\n\nAfter turn 79, from here, say head at (2,5) or (1,6), but let's say from (2,5), move to (1,5) for example.\n\nThen new head (1,5), new body: old positions from turn 78 after move.\n\nComplicated.\n\nTo vacate (3,2), I need the tail to be at (3,2) and then move away.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (1,3), and the path is (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3) to (3,2), so when the snake moves, the tail will move to (2,3) after one move, then to (3,3) after second move, then to (3,2) after third move, then when it moves from (3,2), the cell is vacated.\n\nSo after three moves from now, (3,2) can be vacated.\n\nBut on turn 79, if I can have it vacated.\n\nTurn 77: tail at (1,3)\n\nAfter turn 78 move: tail moves to (2,3) if no growth.\n\nThen after turn 79 move: tail moves to (3,3)\n\nThen after turn 80 move: tail moves to (3,2)\n\nThen after turn 81 move: tail moves away from (3,2), vacating it.\n\nBut for (3,2) food, life span on turn 78 is 2, turn 79 is 1, after turn 79 it becomes 0, disappears. So on turn 80 it is gone, so I cannot eat it on turn 80 or later.\n\nLife span on turn 77 for (3,2) is 3.\n\nAfter turn 77, life span decreases to 2.\n\nOn turn 78, life span 2.\n\nAfter turn 78, decreases to 1.\n\nOn turn 79, life span 1.\n\nAfter turn 79, decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turn 78 or 79.\n\nOn turn 78, (3,2) is occupied, so cannot eat.\n\nOn turn 79, if (3,2) is free, I can eat it.\n\nBut from above, on turn 79, after turn 78 move, the cell (3,2) is still occupied, as in the simulation.\n\nAfter turn 78 move, new positions have a segment at (3,2), as new index 12 or similar.\n\nOn turn 79, when I move, the segment at (3,2) will move to where the previous segment was, so (3,2) is vacated only if no segment moves to it, but in the chain, the segment that was at (3,2) moves away, and the cell is occupied by the next segment in line.\n\nFor example, at start of turn 79, positions include (3,2) occupied.\n\nWhen head moves, the segment that was at (3,2) moves to the position of the segment before it in the chain, so (3,2) is left, and then the next segment moves to (3,2), so it is still occupied after the move.\n\nThe cell (3,2) is only vacated when the tail is at that position and moves away.\n\nIn this case, the tail is not at (3,2) yet.\n\nAt turn 77, tail at (1,3)\n\nAfter turn 78 move, tail at (2,3)\n\nAfter turn 79 move, tail at (3,3)\n\nAfter turn 80 move, tail at (3,2)\n\nAfter turn 81 move, tail moves away, (3,2) vacated.\n\nBut by turn 80, the food is gone.\n\nOn turn 79, tail is at (3,3), not at (3,2).\n\nSo on turn 79, (3,2) is occupied by a body segment, not tail, so when moving, it will be reoccupied.\n\nTherefore, I cannot vacate (3,2) by turn 79 with the current snake shape; it will always be occupied until the tail moves from there, which is too late.\n\nBut that can't be right; perhaps if I move in a way that the body shifts differently.\n\nFor example, if I move the head so that the segment at (3,2) is not followed, but since it's a straight chain, it's fixed.\n\nUnless the snake turns in a way that the body doesn't fill the cell.\n\nBut in this case, the cell (3,2) is on the path, so it will be occupied.\n\nPerhaps I can have the head move to a position where it can eat the food when the tail moves, but since the tail is far, it's not possible by turn 79.\n\nTherefore, it might be impossible to eat the food at (3,2) because it will disappear before it can be exposed.\n\nBut let's confirm the life span.\n\nOn turn 77, life span for (3,2) is 3.\n\nAfter turn 77, life span decreases to 2.\n\nOn turn 78, life span 2.\n\nAfter turn 78, decreases to 1.\n\nOn turn 79, life span 1.\n\nAfter turn 79, decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nSo available on turns 77,78,79.\n\nOn turn 77, (3,2) is occupied, cannot eat.\n\nOn turn 78, occupied, cannot eat.\n\nOn turn 79, occupied, cannot eat.\n\nSo it can never be eaten because it's always under the body until it disappears.\n\nIs that possible? But the rule says food can spawn under body and can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nBut in this case, the body doesn't move away in time.\n\nFor (4,4), life span 9, so there is time.\n\nBut for (3,2), it seems I cannot eat it.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother possibility: if the tail is adjacent and I can move the head to the tail cell when it has food, but there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo for (3,2), the tail is at (1,3), not adjacent, so that doesn't apply.\n\nHead at (2,6), tail at (1,3), distance |2-1| + |6-3| =1+3=4, not adjacent.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, I think I cannot eat the food at (3,2); it will disappear uneaten.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4), I can plan to eat it later.\n\nSo for now, on turn 77, I have to move left to (2,6) as only choice.\n\nThen for turn 78, at (2,6), I can go to (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nBoth seem similar, but let's see which one is better for accessing other areas or avoiding dead ends.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,4) to consider.\n\nFirst, let's list the actions for turn 77.\n\nTurn 77: move L to (2,6)\n\nThen for turn 78, I need to choose between D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n\nIf I go to (2,5), then from there, I can only go to (1,5) as we saw earlier, since (2,4) wall, (2,6) occupied, (3,5) occupied.\n\nFrom (2,5), after move, head at (2,5), direction down.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (2,6) occupied, D to (2,4) wall, L to (1,5), R to (3,5) occupied, so only L to (1,5).\n\nThen to (1,5), direction left.\n\nThen from (1,5), possible moves: U to (1,6) which might be occupied or not, D to (1,4), L to (0,5) x=0 wall, R to (2,5) occupied, and opposite direction? Direction is left, so moving right is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\n(1,6): if I came from (2,6) to (1,5)? Head at (1,5), came from (2,5), so moved left to (1,5), direction L.\n\nThen U to (1,6): is it free? After moving to (1,5), positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), etc., so (1,6) not occupied? In previous positions after turn 78, if I moved to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), ..., (2,3) tail.\n\nThen move to (1,5), new head (1,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) tail at (2,3).\n\nSo (1,6) not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\nD to (1,4) free.\n\nL to (0,5) wall.\n\nR to (2,5) occupied, and opposite direction not allowed.\n\nSo can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 78 I go directly to (1,6) from (2,6).\n\nThen from (1,6), only D to (1,5), as before.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nSo no big difference.\n\nBut for long-term, I should think about eating (4,4).\n\n(4,4) has life span 9 on turn 77, after turn 77, 8, then 7, etc., so plenty of time.\n\nTo eat (4,4), I need to vacate it.\n\nCurrently occupied by segment.\n\nTail is at (1,3), far away.\n\nDistance: from tail to (4,4), many segments.\n\nFor example, at turn 77, tail at (1,3), (4,4) is index 8, so 6 segments away (indices 8 to 14, but index 8 is (4,4), tail index 14, so 6 segments between, so it will take about 6 moves for the tail to reach (4,4), then one more to vacate.\n\nSo around turn 83 or so it can be vacated, and life span 9, on turn 77, after turn 77 life span 8, turn 78:7, ..., turn 85:0? Let's calculate.\n\nLife span on turn 77:9\n\nAfter turn 77:8\n\nTurn 78:8 (available)\n\nAfter turn 78:7\n\n...\n\nAfter turn k, life span decreases.\n\nInitial life span N on turn t.\n\nAfter each turn, decreases by 1.\n\nSo on turn t, life span L, can be eaten on that turn.\n\nAfter turn t, L decreases to L-1.\n\nIf L-1>0, still there, etc.\n\nFor (4,4), turn 77 L=9, can be eaten on turns 77 to 85? On turn 77 L=9, after turn 77 L=8, turn 78 L=8, after turn 78 L=7, ..., after turn 85 L=9-9=0? From turn 77 to turn 77 + 8 = turn 85, on turn 85 L=9 - (85-77) =9-8=1, after turn 85 L=0 disappear.\n\nNumber of turns available: from turn 77 to turn 85 inclusive? On turn 77, L=9; turn 78, L=8; ... turn 85, L=9 - (85-77) =9-8=1; turn 86 L=0 not available.\n\nSo can be eaten on turns 77 to 85 inclusive, 9 turns.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,2), turns 77 to 79.\n\nBut as we saw, can't eat (3,2).\n\nSo for now, on turn 77, only choice is move L to (2,6).\n\nThen for turn 78, I can choose to go to (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nLet's see which one is better for future movement.\n\nIf I go to (2,5), then to (1,5), then I can go to (1,6) or (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is free, not wall.\n\nFrom (1,5) to (1,4) down.\n\nThen from (1,4), I can go to (1,3) but (1,3) is tail or something, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (1,6) first, similar.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (1,2), so (1,2) is wall.\n\nAlso, (2,4) wall.\n\nSo the area near (1,3) might be constrained.\n\nPerhaps going to (1,6) is better because it's closer to the top, but y=7 wall, so limited.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should aim to go to the center or open areas.\n\nAnother food is (4,4), but it's under body.\n\nAlso, the grid has free cells, for example, (6,6), (6,5) free now, (5,5) occupied, etc.\n\nBut let's list all free cells at turn 77 after move to (2,6).\n\nCells not wall, not snake: for x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but borders and obstacles.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nx=1: y=1,2,3,4,5,6 but y=0,7 wall, so y=1 to 6.\n\nBut (1,2) is internal obstacle, so wall.\n\n(1,3) occupied by tail, (1,4) free, (1,5) free, (1,6) free.\n\nx=2: y=1,2,3,4,5,6\n\n(2,3) occupied, (2,4) wall, (2,5) free, (2,6) occupied (head), so only (2,1), (2,2), (2,5) but (2,1) not specified, (2,2) free? (2,4) wall, so (2,1), (2,2), (2,5) free if not occupied.\n\n(2,1): x=2,y=1, not border, internal obstacles: (2,4) but not (2,1), so free.\n\nSimilarly (2,2) free.\n\n(2,5) free.\n\nx=3: y=1,2,3,4,5,6\n\n(3,2) occupied, (3,3) occupied, (3,4) occupied, (3,5) occupied, (3,6) occupied, so only (3,1) free? (3,1) not occupied.\n\nx=4: y=1,2,3,4,5,6\n\n(4,2) occupied, (4,3) occupied, (4,4) occupied, (4,5) occupied, (4,6) occupied, so (4,1) free.\n\nx=5: y=1,2,3,4,5,6\n\n(5,1) internal obstacle wall, (5,5) occupied, (5,6) occupied, so (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) free? (5,2) not occupied, (5,3) not, (5,4) not, but (5,1) wall.\n\nx=6: y=1,2,3,4,5,6\n\n(6,1) internal wall, (6,4) internal wall, (6,5) food but gone, free, (6,6) free, (6,2), (6,3) free? But (6,2) not specified, free.\n\nSo free cells include (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,5), (3,1), (4,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,5), (6,6), etc.\n\nNow, for turn 78, from (2,6), I can go D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n\nIf I go to (2,5), then I can later go to (2,2) or something, but (2,4) wall, so I have to go left to (1,5), then to (1,4) or (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (1,6), then to (1,5), then same.\n\nSo perhaps it doesn't matter much.\n\nBut let's choose to go down to (2,5) on turn 78.\n\nThen for turn 79, from (2,5), only to (1,5) left.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can go up to (1,6) or down to (1,4).\n\n(1,6) is free, as above.\n\nOr (1,4) free.\n\nThen from there, I can access other areas.\n\nFor example, to reach (4,4) later.\n\nBut (4,4) is occupied, so I need to wait for it to be vacated.\n\nPerhaps I should move towards the bottom or right to have more space.\n\nBut for now, since I have to provide actions for several turns, let's start with turn 77.\n\nTurn 77: move L to (2,6) - only choice.\n\nTurn 78: I need to choose. Let's say move D to (2,5) for example.\n\nThen turn 79: from (2,5), move L to (1,5) - only choice.\n\nThen turn 80: from (1,5), I can move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nLet's say move D to (1,4) to go down.\n\nThen from (1,4), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,5) occupied, D to (1,3) but (1,3) was tail, but after moves, it might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 79 move to (1,5), positions: let's track.\n\nAfter turn 77: head (2,6), body (3,6) to (1,3) as before.\n\nAfter turn 78 move D to (2,5): no food, so head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) tail at (2,3).\n\nAfter turn 79 move L to (1,5): no food, head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) tail at (3,3).\n\nNow from (1,5), move D to (1,4): no food, head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) tail at (3,2)? New tail at old (3,3) position.\n\nPositions: new head (1,4), new index 1: old head (1,5), new index 2: old index 1 (2,5), new index 3: old index 2 (2,6), new index 4: old index 3 (3,6), ..., up to new index 15: old index 14 (3,3)? Old indices: after turn 78, we had 15 segments: index 0 (2,5), 1 (2,6), 2 (3,6), 3 (4,6), 4 (5,6), 5 (5,5), 6 (4,5), 7 (3,5), 8 (3,4), 9 (4,4), 10 (4,3), 11 (4,2), 12 (3,2), 13 (3,3), 14 (2,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (1,5), new head (1,5), new body: old index 0 to 13: so new index 1: (2,5), new index 2: (2,6), new index 3: (3,6), new index 4: (4,6), new index 5: (5,6), new index 6: (5,5), new index 7: (4,5), new index 8: (3,5), new index 9: (3,4), new index 10: (4,4), new index 11: (4,3), new index 12: (4,2), new index 13: (3,2), new index 14: (3,3) and tail, since no growth, old index 14 removed.\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) tail at (3,3).\n\nThen from here, move D to (1,4), new head (1,4), body: old head (1,5), old index 1 (2,5), old index 2 (2,6), ..., up to old index 13 (3,2), and old index 14 (3,3) removed? New body: new index 1: old head (1,5), new index 2: old index 1 (2,5), new index 3: old index 2 (2,6), new index 4: old index 3 (3,6), new index 5: old index 4 (4,6), new index 6: old index 5 (5,6), new index 7: old index 6 (5,5), new index 8: old index 7 (4,5), new index 9: old index 8 (3,5), new index 10: old index 9 (3,4), new index 11: old index 10 (4,4), new index 12: old index 11 (4,3), new index 13: old index 12 (4,2), new index 14: old index 13 (3,2) tail at (3,2).\n\nSo tail at (3,2).\n\nAnd food at (3,2) is still there, but occupied by tail.\n\nOn turn 80, at (1,5), I move to (1,4), no food.\n\nThen on turn 81, head at (1,4), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,5) occupied, D to (1,3), L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4) wall.\n\nD to (1,3): (1,3) is free? Not wall, and not occupied in positions, so free? But (1,2) is wall, so (1,3) should be free.\n\nIn positions above, after move to (1,4), positions include up to (3,2), no (1,3), so free.\n\nR to (2,4) wall.\n\nSo can go D to (1,3).\n\nThen eat if food, but no food there.\n\nMove to (1,3), no food, so tail moves.\n\n etc.\n\nBut I think for the purpose of this, since I need to provide the actions, and for turn 77, only one choice, so:\n\nTurn 77: L\n\nThen for turn 78, I can choose D or L. Let's choose D to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 79: from (2,5), only L to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 80: from (1,5), say D to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 81: from (1,4), D to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 82: from (1,3), possible moves, but (1,2) wall, so U to (1,4) or R to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to plan all, but at least 5 turns ahead, from turn 77 to 81 or 82.\n\nTurn t1=77, so turns 77 to 81 or 82.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince on turn 77 only one move, I can start with that.\n\nAlso, for the food at (4,4), I can plan to eat it later.\n\nBut for now, let's provide the actions.\n\nSo for turn 77: L\n\nThen for turn 78, I have two choices, but let's say move D to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 79: from (2,5), move L to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 80: from (1,5), I can move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4). Let's move D to (1,4) to go down.\n\nThen turn 81: from (1,4), move D to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 82: from (1,3), direction down (since moved down to (1,3)).\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,4) occupied, D to (1,2) wall, L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3) which might be free or not.\n\nAfter previous moves, positions: but I don't need to simulate all.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize score, and no other food available now, I should survive and wait for (4,4) to be exposed.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nPerhaps for simplicity, since on turn 78 at (2,6), moving to (1,6) might be better because it's on the edge, but similar.\n\nI think I should just provide the moves.\n\nSo for the boxed answer:\n\nTurn 77: L\n\nTurn 78: D\n\nTurn 79: L (from (2,5) to (1,5))\n\nTurn 80: D (from (1,5) to (1,4))\n\nTurn 81: D (from (1,4) to (1,3))\n\nBut on turn 81 from (1,4) to (1,3), then from (1,3), I can go to (2,3) if free, etc.\n\nBut to think 5 turns ahead, this is fine.\n\nSince the food at (3,2) is impossible to eat, and (4,4) later, so for now, avoid risks and survive.\n\nSo I think that's the plan.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 77):**\n- **Grid Size:** 8x8 (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7)). Walls exist at all border cells (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)].\n- **Snake Positions:** Head at (3,6), with body segments: [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)]. Tail at (1,3). Length is 14.\n- **Head Direction:** Left (L) – meaning the snake moved left to reach (3,6).\n- **Food:**\n  - (6,5): Value +1, life span 1 (must be eaten on turn 77 or it disappears).\n  - (3,2): Value +1, life span 3 (can be eaten on turns 77, 78, or 79; disappears after turn 79).\n  - (2,6): Value +1, life span 6 (can be eaten on turns 77 to 82; disappears after turn 82).\n  - (4,4): Value +1, life span 9 (can be eaten on turns 77 to 85; disappears after turn 85).\n\n**Immediate Constraints and Risks for Turn 77:**\n- **Movement Options:** From head position (3,6) with direction L, possible moves are U (up), D (down), or L (left). R (right) is invalid (opposite direction and instant reverse not allowed).\n- **Adjacent Cell Evaluation:**\n  - U (up) to (3,7): y=7 is border wall → invalid.\n  - D (down) to (3,5): Occupied by body segment → collision risk → invalid.\n  - L (left) to (2,6): Not a wall, not occupied, and has food (2,6) → valid and safe.\n  - Food at (6,5) cannot be reached this turn (not adjacent), so it will disappear after turn 77.\n  - Food at (3,2) and (4,4) are under the body and cannot be eaten immediately (body must move away first). (3,2) cannot be eaten by turn 79 due to body occupation, so it will disappear uneaten.\n- **Only Viable Move:** L (left) to (2,6) to eat the food there. This increases snake length to 15 and scores +1.\n\n**Turn 78 Planning (Head at (2,6), Direction L):**\n- **Movement Options:** U, D, or L (R invalid due to direction).\n- **Adjacent Cell Evaluation:**\n  - U (up) to (2,7): y=7 wall → invalid.\n  - D (down) to (2,5): Free (not wall or body) → valid.\n  - L (left) to (1,6): Free (not wall or body) → valid.\n- **Choice:** Both (2,5) and (1,6) are safe. Moving D (down) to (2,5) is chosen to avoid the top row (y=6-7 is constrained) and position for better access to open areas. No food eaten.\n\n**Turn 79 Planning (Head at (2,5), Direction D):**\n- **Movement Options:** U, D, L, or R, but U and R are invalid:\n  - U (up) to (2,6): Occupied by body → invalid.\n  - R (right) to (3,5): Occupied by body → invalid.\n  - D (down) to (2,4): Internal obstacle wall → invalid.\n  - L (left) to (1,5): Free → valid and only option.\n- **Only Viable Move:** L (left) to (1,5). No food eaten.\n\n**Turn 80 Planning (Head at (1,5), Direction L):**\n- **Movement Options:** U, D, or L (R invalid due to direction).\n- **Adjacent Cell Evaluation:**\n  - U (up) to (1,6): Free → valid.\n  - D (down) to (1,4): Free → valid.\n  - L (left) to (0,5): x=0 wall → invalid.\n- **Choice:** D (down) to (1,4) is chosen to move toward the bottom-left area, avoiding potential dead ends and creating space for future moves. No food eaten.\n\n**Turn 81 Planning (Head at (1,4), Direction D):**\n- **Movement Options:** U, D, L, or R, but U and L are invalid:\n  - U (up) to (1,5): Occupied by body → invalid.\n  - L (left) to (0,4): x=0 wall → invalid.\n  - R (right) to (2,4): Internal obstacle wall → invalid.\n  - D (down) to (1,3): Free → valid and only option.\n- **Only Viable Move:** D (down) to (1,3). No food eaten.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (Beyond Turn 81):**\n- **Food at (4,4):** This food is under the body but has a long life span (available until turn 85). The tail will gradually move toward this area over ~6 turns, vacating (4,4) around turn 83. Plan to navigate toward (4,4) after it is exposed.\n- **Risk Avoidance:** Prioritize open areas like (1,1), (1,2) (wall, avoid), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,5), (6,6) to avoid collisions and dead ends. Avoid the internal obstacles and borders.\n- **Survival Focus:** With no immediate food rewards, focus on safe movements to extend the game until (4,4) is accessible.\n\n**Planned Actions (5 Turns Ahead):**\n- Turn 77: Move left to (2,6) to eat food and avoid risks.\n- Turn 78: Move down to (2,5) for better positioning.\n- Turn 79: Move left to (1,5) as the only safe move.\n- Turn 80: Move down to (1,4) to access open areas.\n- Turn 81: Move down to (1,3) as the only safe move.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 77: L \\\\\nTurn 78: D \\\\\nTurn 79: L \\\\\nTurn 80: D \\\\\nTurn 81: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 78. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,6), then body segments: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). That's 15 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (2,6)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,6)\n\n- Segment 2: (4,6)\n\n- Segment 3: (5,6)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 5: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 6: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 7: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 8: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 9: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 10: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 11: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 12: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 13: (2,3)\n\n- Segment 14: (1,3)\n\nTail is at (1,3).\n\nHead direction is left, so the snake is moving left, meaning from (2,6) it came from the right, I think. Since positions are head first, and it was moving left to (2,6), so previous head was at (3,6) or something? Let's see the positions: from (3,6) to (2,6), yes, moving left.\n\nCurrent head is at (2,6), direction L, so it's facing left.\n\nFood:\n\n- (3,2) with value 1, life span 3\n\n- (4,4) with value 1, life span 8\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nLife span: for (3,2), it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn, so it will be gone after turn 78+2=80? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (3,2), life_span=3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns from now. Since countdown decreases on turn 78, then 79, then 80, so on turn 81 it should be gone? Let's think:\n\n- On turn 78: life_span=3, present\n\n- Turn 79: life_span=2, present\n\n- Turn 80: life_span=1, present\n\n- Turn 81: life_span=0, disappears, not present.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4), life_span=8, so it will last until turn 78+7=85? Turn 78:8, 79:7, ..., 85:1, 86:0 gone.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Priority is long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid is 8x8, walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n\nBorders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions: I'll list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nHead: (2,6)\n\nBody: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n\n(4,4) is a body segment? But there's also food at (4,4) with life span 8. Food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) has food with life span 3, but (3,2) is also a body segment? Snake positions include (3,2), which is segment 11.\n\nFood at (3,2) and (4,4) are under the snake body, so they can't be eaten immediately; we have to move the body away first.\n\nNow, current head position: (2,6), direction L, so it can move left, up, or down, but not right because of no instant reverse.\n\nPossible moves from (2,6):\n\n- Left: (1,6)\n\n- Up: (2,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Down: (2,5)\n\n- Right: (3,6) but that's the body, and also reverse, but since direction is L, moving right would be reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so cannot move right to (3,6).\n\nAlso, (3,6) is occupied by body, so definitely cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, up to (2,7) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: Left to (1,6) or Down to (2,5).\n\nNow, (1,6): is it wall? Borders: x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 is not border wall. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,6) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5): not wall, not occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all snake cells.\n\n(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n\nSo (2,5) is not in this list, so it should be free.\n\n(1,6) not in list, free.\n\nBut (1,6) might be near border, but x=1, y=6, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,6) is not border, and no internal obstacle there, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) free.\n\nNow, food: (3,2) and (4,4) are under body, so not accessible now.\n\nBut I need to think about eating them later.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate move.\n\nIf I move left to (1,6), what happens?\n\nNew head position: (1,6)\n\nThen the tail will move? When snake moves, head moves to new cell, and tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten, tail moves, so (1,3) is removed, and body shifts.\n\nSimilarly, if move down to (2,5), head to (2,5), tail removed from (1,3).\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's see the food at (3,2). Life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 80? Turn 78: life=3, present; turn 79: life=2, present; turn 80: life=1, present; turn 81: gone. So available on turns 78,79,80.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) life=8, available until turn 85.\n\nNow, (3,2) is currently occupied by snake body at segment 11. To eat it, we need the body to move away from (3,2), and then head to move there.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4), which is segment 8.\n\nNow, let's see the snake's path.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,6), going left or down.\n\nAlso, tail is at (1,3), which is near (1,2) obstacle? (1,2) is internal obstacle, so (1,3) is adjacent.\n\nBut not directly relevant.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I need to avoid boxing myself in or colliding.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nI'll make a 8x8 grid, with walls and snake.\n\nRows y=0 to 7, bottom? Usually y=0 bottom, but in coordinates, it might be arbitrary, but I'll assume (0,0) bottom left, (7,7) top right, or? Not specified, but I can work with coordinates.\n\nSet x from left to right, y from bottom to top, so (0,0) bottom left, (0,7) top left, etc.\n\nBut walls: x=0 left wall, x=7 right wall, y=0 bottom wall, y=7 top wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,6) — let's say x=2,y=6\n\nThen: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n\nNow, (4,4) is part of snake, and food is there, but under body.\n\nSimilarly (3,2) has food under body.\n\nNow, to plan moves.\n\nFirst, possible moves from current head (2,6):\n\n- Left to (1,6): is it free? Yes, no wall, no snake.\n\n- Down to (2,5): free, no wall, no snake.\n\n- Up to (2,7): wall, invalid.\n\n- Right to (3,6): body, and reverse, invalid.\n\nSo only L or D.\n\nNow, if I go left to (1,6), then new head (1,6), body becomes: head (1,6), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, so positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)] and tail (1,3) removed, so snake length 14 now? Originally 15 segments, move without eating, so length same, but positions shift: head moves to new cell, tail removed.\n\nOriginal: 15 positions.\n\nAfter move: head to new position, so new list: [new_head, old_head, segment1, ..., segment13] but tail segment14 removed.\n\nPositions: index 0 head, 1 to 14 body.\n\nAfter move no food: new head position, then old head (now body), then old segment1 to old segment13, and old tail (segment14) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (1,6) if move left, then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) ] but (2,3) was segment13, and (1,3) segment14 removed, so the last is (2,3), which was segment13, now it's the tail.\n\nList:\n\nOld: pos[0] = (2,6) head\n\npos[1] = (3,6)\n\npos[2] = (4,6)\n\npos[3] = (5,6)\n\npos[4] = (5,5)\n\npos[5] = (4,5)\n\npos[6] = (3,5)\n\npos[7] = (3,4)\n\npos[8] = (4,4)\n\npos[9] = (4,3)\n\npos[10] = (4,2)\n\npos[11] = (3,2)\n\npos[12] = (3,3)\n\npos[13] = (2,3)\n\npos[14] = (1,3) tail\n\nAfter move left to (1,6):\n\nNew head: (1,6)\n\nThen body: old head (2,6), then pos[1] to pos[13], but pos[14] removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) ] and (1,3) gone.\n\nTail is now (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, if move down to (2,5):\n\nNew head (2,5), then body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) and (1,3) gone, tail (2,3).\n\nIn both cases, tail is (2,3) after move.\n\nNow, the food at (3,2) is still under body, at position new pos[12] if moved left or down? In new positions after move left: let's index.\n\nAfter move left:\n\nHead: (1,6)\n\n1: (2,6)\n\n2: (3,6)\n\n3: (4,6)\n\n4: (5,6)\n\n5: (5,5)\n\n6: (4,5)\n\n7: (3,5)\n\n8: (3,4)\n\n9: (4,4)\n\n10: (4,3)\n\n11: (4,2)\n\n12: (3,2)  // food here\n\n13: (3,3)\n\n14: (2,3) tail\n\n(3,2) is pos[12], body segment.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is pos[9], body segment.\n\nTo eat (3,2) food, we need the body to move away from (3,2), so that the cell is free, then head to move there.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4).\n\n(3,2) life span only 3, so it will be gone soon.\n\nAvailable on turns 78,79,80.\n\nTurn 78: now, we are at turn 78, about to make move.\n\nAfter move, it's turn 79.\n\nFood at (3,2) will be present on turn 79 (life=2) and turn 80 (life=1), gone turn 81.\n\nSo we have two chances to eat it: turn 79 or 80.\n\nBut it's under body now, so we need to free the cell first.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) has more time.\n\nAlso, there might be other food or risks.\n\nNow, let's see where the snake is going.\n\nCurrent head at (2,6), moving left or down.\n\nIf I move left to (1,6), then from there, possible moves.\n\n(1,6): possible directions.\n\nCurrent direction after move: since moved left, direction L.\n\nThen from (1,6), can move left, up, down.\n\nLeft: (0,6) but x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nUp: (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nDown: (1,5)\n\nOr right to (2,6), but that's the body, and reverse? Direction is L, moving right is opposite, so no instant reverse, cannot move right.\n\nSo only possible move from (1,6) is down to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) should be free; let's check.\n\nAfter moving to (1,6), positions: (1,6), (2,6), etc, so (1,5) not occupied, no wall, internal obstacles: (1,2) but (1,5) different, so free.\n\nSo if I move to (1,6), then on next turn, I must move down to (1,5), no choice.\n\nThen from (1,5), what can I do?\n\nFirst, after moving to (1,6) and then to (1,5), let's see the state.\n\nTurn 78: move to (1,6)\n\nThen turn 79: move to (1,5)\n\nAfter turn 78 move to (1,6): positions as above.\n\nThen turn 79 move to (1,5): new head (1,5), body: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) and tail (2,3) removed? When head moves to (1,5), new positions: head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), ..., up to (3,3), and (2,3) is removed? Old tail was (2,3), which is now the last body segment.\n\nAfter turn 78 move to (1,6): snake: head (1,6), body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) tail\n\nThen turn 79 move to (1,5): new head (1,5), then body: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) and tail (2,3) removed, so tail is now (3,3).\n\nPositions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) ] tail (3,3)\n\nNow, (3,2) is still body, pos[13]? Index: head (1,5), 1: (1,6), 2: (2,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (5,6), 6: (5,5), 7: (4,5), 8: (3,5), 9: (3,4), 10: (4,4), 11: (4,3), 12: (4,2), 13: (3,2), 14: (3,3) tail\n\n(3,2) is pos[13], body.\n\nFood at (3,2) is still under body.\n\nOn turn 79, life span 2, present.\n\nIf I want to eat it on turn 80, I need (3,2) to be free on turn 80, and head to move there.\n\nCurrently on turn 79, after moving to (1,5), head at (1,5).\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves.\n\nDirection: moved down to (1,5), so direction D.\n\nCan move down, left, right, but not up (reverse).\n\nDown: (1,4)\n\nLeft: (0,4) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nRight: (2,5)\n\nUp: (1,6) body, and reverse, invalid.\n\nSo possible: down to (1,4) or right to (2,5).\n\n(1,4) should be free; (2,5) should be free now? After above, positions have (2,6), (3,6), etc, but (2,5) not occupied, no wall.\n\nSimilarly (1,4) free.\n\nIf I go down to (1,4), or right to (2,5).\n\nBut I need to get to (3,2) to eat the food.\n\n(3,2) is at x=3,y=2.\n\nHead at (1,5), so I need to move right and down.\n\nBut (3,2) is occupied by body until it moves away.\n\nThe body at (3,2) will move when the snake moves.\n\nOn each move, the body shifts.\n\nFor example, if on turn 79, head at (1,5), and we move, say, to (2,5) or (1,4).\n\nThen the body at (3,2) will move to where? When head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nIn this case, pos[13] is (3,2), which was occupied by the segment that will move to pos[12]'s old position, but it's messy.\n\nThe cell (3,2) will be freed when the snake moves in a way that the segment on (3,2) moves away.\n\nCurrently on turn 79 after move, (3,2) is occupied by a body segment.\n\nWhen we make a move on turn 79, the head moves, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nFor example, if from turn 79 position, head (1,5), if we move to (2,5), new head (2,5), then body: (1,5) becomes new body1, then (1,6) body2, (2,6) body3, and so on, up to (3,2) which was body13, will move to the position of body12, which was (4,2), so (3,2) is vacated, and the new body13 is at (4,2), etc.\n\nLet's list turn 79 positions before move: head (1,5), body: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) tail\n\nIf move to (2,5): new head (2,5), then body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), and tail (3,3) removed. New tail is (3,2)? Positions: [ (2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) ] and (3,3) gone. So (3,2) is now the tail, but it's still occupied.\n\n(3,2) is now occupied by the tail segment.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (1,4) instead, new head (1,4), body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), ..., same body shift, (3,2) becomes part of body or tail.\n\nIn both cases, (3,2) is still occupied after turn 79 move.\n\nThen on turn 80, if I move, (3,2) might be freed or not.\n\nFor example, from above, after moving to (2,5) on turn 79, positions: head (2,5), body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) tail\n\nNow (3,2) is tail.\n\nIf on turn 80, I move the head, the tail will move away if no food eaten.\n\nFor example, if head moves to some position, tail moves, so (3,2) is vacated.\n\nThen on turn 80, if I can move head to (3,2), I can eat the food.\n\nBut the food is at (3,2), and it will be present on turn 80.\n\nSo possible.\n\nSimilarly, from other positions.\n\nBut let's back to current turn 78.\n\nIf on turn 78 I move down to (2,5) instead of left.\n\nThen from (2,6) down to (2,5).\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), then body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) and (1,3) removed. Tail (2,3).\n\nDirection: moved down, so direction D.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: down to (2,4), left to (1,5), right to (3,5), up to (2,6) but body, and reverse, invalid.\n\nUp is reverse since direction D, so cannot move up.\n\nSo possible: down (2,4), left (1,5), right (3,5).\n\nNow (3,5) is body? Current positions: (2,5) head, (2,6), (3,6), etc, (3,5) is in body, yes, occupied, so cannot move there.\n\n(2,4) free? Not in positions, no wall.\n\n(1,5) free? Not occupied, no wall.\n\nInternal obstacle (1,2) but (1,5) not that.\n\nSo possible moves: down to (2,4) or left to (1,5).\n\nNow, to eat (3,2) food, which is at (3,2), life span short.\n\nIf I move down to (2,5) on turn 78, then from there I can go left to (1,5) or down to (2,4).\n\nIf I go to (1,5), similar to before.\n\nOr to (2,4).\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (3,2) by turn 80.\n\nTurn 78: move to (2,5)\n\nTurn 79: from (2,5), say move left to (1,5)\n\nThen positions: new head (1,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) tail? After move to (2,5) on turn 78: positions [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) ]\n\nThen turn 79 move to (1,5): new head (1,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) and tail (2,3) removed. New positions: [ (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) ] tail (3,3)\n\n(3,2) is pos[13], body.\n\nOn turn 80, if I move, the body will shift.\n\nFor example, if from (1,5) I move to say (1,4) or (1,6) or (2,5), but (2,5) is body, occupied, and if direction, moved to (1,5) from (2,5), so if from (2,5) to (1,5), that's left, so direction L.\n\nThen from (1,5), can move left, down, up, but not right (reverse).\n\nLeft: (0,5) wall invalid.\n\nUp: (1,6) but in positions, (1,6) is not occupied now? In above positions, after turn 79 move, positions are (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), etc, no (1,6), so (1,6) is free.\n\nUp to (1,6): free, not wall.\n\nDown to (1,4): free.\n\nRight to (2,5): body, occupied, and reverse, invalid.\n\nSo from (1,5) turn 79, can move up to (1,6) or down to (1,4).\n\nIf move to (1,6), new head (1,6), body: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) and tail (3,3) removed? Positions: [ (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) ] and (3,3) gone, so tail (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is tail now.\n\nThen on turn 80, if I move head to (3,2), I can eat the food, but (3,2) is tail, and there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nHere, head at (1,6), tail at (3,2), not adjacent; (1,6) and (3,2) are not adjacent, so if I move to (3,2), it might be possible, but from (1,6) to (3,2) is not a single move; I can only move to adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (1,6), I can move to (1,5), (1,7) invalid, (0,6) invalid, (2,6) but (2,6) is body, occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (1,6) on turn 79, positions: head (1,6), body: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) tail\n\nSo (2,6) is body, occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nOnly possible moves from (1,6): down to (1,5) or up to (1,7) wall, left (0,6) wall, right (2,6) body, so only down to (1,5).\n\nThen if move to (1,5), new head (1,5), body: (1,6), (1,5) wait, new positions: head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) and tail (3,2) removed? When head moves to (1,5), which is already in body, but it's the new head position.\n\nOld head (1,6) becomes body, so new positions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) ] but (3,2) was tail, and since no food, tail removed, so the last is (4,2), or? Old positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) tail\n\nMove to (1,5): new head (1,5), then body: old head (1,6), then old body1 (1,5) but (1,5) is the new head, so the body segments are old head and the first part of old body.\n\nNew body: the old head becomes new body1, old body1 becomes new body2, etc, up to old body13 becomes new body14, but since no food, the last is removed.\n\nOld positions: index 0: (1,6) head\n1: (1,5)\n2: (2,5)\n3: (2,6)\n4: (3,6)\n5: (4,6)\n6: (5,6)\n7: (5,5)\n8: (4,5)\n9: (3,5)\n10: (3,4)\n11: (4,4)\n12: (4,3)\n13: (4,2)\n14: (3,2) tail\n\nMove to (1,5): new head (1,5)\nThen new body0: old head (1,6)\nNew body1: old body1 (1,5) but (1,5) is the new head position, so this is occupied, but in terms of positions, new body1 is the position of old body1, which is (1,5), but (1,5) is new head, so it's a problem? No, the body segments are at different positions.\n\nNew head: (1,5)\nNew body0: old head position, which is (1,6)\nNew body1: old body1 position, which is (1,5)? Old body1 is at (1,5), but new head is also at (1,5), collision? No, when head moves to a new cell, it should be free.\n\n(1,5) is currently occupied by the body? In the old positions, (1,5) is body segment, so if I move head to (1,5), it would collide with body, so invalid move.\n\nI forgot that.\n\nOn turn 79, head at (1,5), and I consider moving to (1,5) but it's the same cell, or to adjacent.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves: to (1,6) or (1,4) or (2,5), but (2,5) is occupied by body, (1,6) is occupied by body in the positions above.\n\nIn turn 79 positions: head (1,5), body: (1,6), (2,5), (2,6), etc.\n\nSo (1,6) is body, occupied, (2,5) is body, occupied, so the only possible move is down to (1,4), which is free.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved to (1,6) earlier, from (1,6) only down to (1,5), but (1,5) is occupied by body at that time? Let's clarify.\n\nEarlier when at (1,6) on turn 79, positions: head (1,6), body: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), etc, so (1,5) is body, occupied, so moving to (1,5) is invalid because it's occupied.\n\nSimilarly, other directions invalid, so only possible move from (1,6) is down to (1,5), but (1,5) is occupied, so it's invalid? That can't be right.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nWhen the head is at (1,6), the cells around it:\n\n- Up: (1,7) wall\n\n- Down: (1,5) but in the positions, (1,5) is occupied by the body segment that is directly behind the head, so it's adjacent but occupied, so cannot move there.\n\n- Left: (0,6) wall\n\n- Right: (2,6) occupied by body\n\nSo all possible moves are invalid? That means the snake is trapped and will die on next move if it goes that way.\n\nBut that can't be, let's check the positions.\n\nFrom turn 78 move to (1,6): positions: head (1,6), body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nSo the body segments are: (2,6), (3,6), etc. (1,5) is not occupied at all. In this position, (1,5) is free.\n\nI think I confused the positions.\n\nAfter turn 78 move to (1,6): snake positions: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nSo cells occupied: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nSo (1,5) is not occupied, free.\n\nFrom (1,6), down to (1,5) is free and possible.\n\nSimilarly, other directions not possible as before.\n\nOn turn 79, from (1,6), move down to (1,5): new head (1,5), body: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) and tail (2,3) removed. New tail (3,3).\n\nPositions: [ (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) ]\n\n(3,2) is pos[13], body.\n\nOn turn 80, if I want to eat food at (3,2), I need to move head there when it's free.\n\nBut on turn 80, (3,2) is still occupied by body.\n\nWhen I make a move on turn 80, the body will shift.\n\nFor example, from head at (1,5), I can move to (1,4) or (1,6) or (2,5), but (1,6) is body, occupied, (2,5) is not occupied? Positions have (2,6), (3,6), etc, not (2,5), so (2,5) is free.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves:\n- Down to (1,4)\n- Up to (1,6) but body, occupied\n- Left to (0,5) wall\n- Right to (2,5) free\n\nSo can move down to (1,4) or right to (2,5).\n\nIf I move right to (2,5), new head (2,5), body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) and tail (3,3) removed. New positions: [ (2,5), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) ] tail (3,2)\n\n(3,2) is now tail.\n\nThen on turn 80, head at (2,5), tail at (3,2), not adjacent.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), for example, or other.\n\nBut to eat food at (3,2), I can move head to (3,2) on turn 80.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move down to (2,4), left to (1,5) body, right to (3,5) body, up to (2,6) body, all except down to (2,4) are occupied or invalid.\n\nDown to (2,4) free.\n\nBut (3,2) is not adjacent to (2,5); it's at distance.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (3,2) not adjacent.\n\nI can move to (3,2) from other positions.\n\nFor example, on turn 80, if head is at a cell adjacent to (3,2), and (3,2) is free, I can move there.\n\nBut in the above, on turn 80 after move, (3,2) is tail, so it is occupied, but when I move on turn 80, the tail will move away if I don't eat food.\n\nOn turn 80, before move, positions have tail at (3,2), so (3,2) is occupied.\n\nWhen I move the head to a new position, if I don't eat food, the tail moves away, so (3,2) is vacated, but the head is moving to a different cell, so I can't move to (3,2) directly because it's occupied before the move.\n\nTo move to (3,2), it must be free at the beginning of the turn.\n\nBut at the start of turn 80, (3,2) is occupied by tail or body, so it's not free, so I cannot move there.\n\nFor example, in the scenario where on turn 80, head is at (2,5), positions have (3,2) occupied, so I cannot move to (3,2) because it's occupied.\n\nSimilarly, in other cases, (3,2) is occupied until the snake moves in a way that the segment leaves it.\n\nBut when it leaves, it's after the move, so for that turn, it's still occupied.\n\nSo for (3,2) to be free on turn 80, it must not be occupied at the start of turn 80.\n\nThat means that on turn 79, after the move, (3,2) should not be in the positions, so that on turn 80 it is free.\n\nIn other words, the body must have moved away from (3,2) on turn 79 move.\n\nOn turn 79, after the move, (3,2) should not be occupied.\n\nFor example, if on turn 79, when we move, the segment that was at (3,2) moves to a different cell, and no new segment comes, so (3,2) is free for turn 80.\n\nIn the positions after turn 79 move, (3,2) should not be in the list.\n\nThen on turn 80, (3,2) is free, and if head moves there, it can eat the food if present.\n\nSimilarly for any food under body.\n\nFor (3,2) food, to eat it on turn 80, we need that on turn 80, (3,2) is free and head moves there.\n\nSo at the start of turn 80, (3,2) must not be occupied by snake.\n\nThat means that after the turn 79 move, (3,2) is not in the snake positions.\n\nIn the current state, on turn 78, (3,2) is occupied.\n\nAfter turn 78 move, (3,2) may still be occupied or not.\n\nFor example, if on turn 78 we move in a way that the body shifts and (3,2) is still occupied or not.\n\nIn the snake positions, (3,2) is a body segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the body segments move to the position of the previous segment.\n\nFor (3,2) to be vacated after a move, it must be the tail and we move without eating, so tail is removed, or it is not the tail but the segment moves to a different position.\n\nBut in general, for a cell to be freed, the segment on it must move away, and no new segment comes.\n\nIn this case, since the snake is long, it's hard to free a specific cell quickly.\n\nPerhaps for (3,2), with only 2 turns left, it might not be worth the risk to try to eat it, as it might be difficult and we have other food.\n\nThere is also (4,4) food with longer life span.\n\nMoreover, survival is priority.\n\nLet's look at the grid.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid going left to (1,6) because it might lead to a dead end.\n\nFrom (1,6), only down to (1,5), then from (1,5), to (1,4) or (2,5), then from there, I can go to (1,3) or (2,4) etc, but there is obstacle at (1,2), so y=2 is not wall, but (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,3) is free, but near obstacle.\n\nBut let's see the area.\n\nIf I go down from (2,6) to (2,5), then from (2,5) I can go down to (2,4) or left to (1,5).\n\nFrom (2,4), I can go to (2,3) or (2,5) body, or (1,4) or (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) is body? Not necessarily.\n\nLet's think about the food at (4,4).\n\n(4,4) has life span 8, so more time.\n\nIt is currently under body at position, in current state, (4,4) is body segment.\n\nTo eat it, we need to free the cell and move head there.\n\nBut it's in the middle of the body.\n\nPerhaps I can move the snake in a way that it coils or something to free space.\n\nBut it might be risky.\n\nAnother idea: the tail is at (1,3), and after moves, it moves.\n\nBut let's consider the current move.\n\nPerhaps for turn 78, moving down to (2,5) is better because it opens more options.\n\nIf I move down to (2,5), then on turn 79, I can move down to (2,4) or left to (1,5).\n\nIf I move to (2,4), then from there, I can go to (2,3), but (2,3) is body? After turn 78 move to (2,5): positions [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) ]\n\n(2,3) is body.\n\nFrom (2,5), move to (2,4): new head (2,4), body: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) and tail (2,3) removed. New positions: [ (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) ] tail (3,3)\n\nThen from (2,4), possible moves: down to (2,3), but (2,3) is not occupied now, free, or left to (1,4), or right to (3,4), or up to (2,5) body.\n\n(3,4) is body? Positions have (3,4), yes, occupied.\n\nSo can move down to (2,3) or left to (1,4).\n\n(2,3) is free, no wall.\n\netc.\n\nBut I need to think about the food.\n\nSince the food at (3,2) is hard to get in time, and it's only +1, perhaps I should ignore it and focus on (4,4) or other areas for long-term.\n\nAlso, there might be new food spawn, but not specified, so only these food for now.\n\nThe state only gives current food, so we have to work with that.\n\nAnother thing: the head is near the tail in a way.\n\nCurrent head (2,6), tail (1,3), not adjacent.\n\nBut if I move, it might get closer.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (2,5), then head (2,5), tail (2,3), which are close, (2,5) and (2,3) are not adjacent, distance 2 in y.\n\nThen after move, tail (2,3), head (2,5), so if I move down to (2,4), then head (2,4), tail (3,3) or something.\n\nBut not immediately adjacent.\n\nPerhaps it's safe.\n\nTo maximize score, I should try to eat the food at (4,4) later.\n\nBut let's see if I can free (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is currently body segment, and it's not the tail, so when the snake moves, it will move to different position.\n\nFor example, after several moves, (4,4) will be vacated.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSince life span is 8, it's possible.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (1,3), and we can move the snake to reduce length or something, but we need to eat food to grow.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards areas with space.\n\nLet's look at the grid.\n\nThe grid has obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is an obstacle, so at (2,4) we cannot go.\n\nIn the snake positions, (2,4) is not occupied, but it is wall, so we cannot move there.\n\nInternal obstacles are walls, so cells are blocked.\n\nSo (2,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) wall, etc.\n\nSo from (2,6), if I move down to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can move down to (2,4) but (2,4) is wall, so invalid.\n\nLeft to (1,5), or right to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, occupied.\n\nSo only left to (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I move left from (2,6) to (1,6), then down to (1,5), then from (1,5) to (1,4) or (2,5).\n\nBut (2,5) might be free or not.\n\nIn both cases, I am forced to go down to the bottom left corner.\n\nFor example, from (1,5), I can go to (1,4) or (2,5).\n\nIf I go to (1,4), then to (1,3), but (1,3) might be tail or something, but not now.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (1,2), so (1,3) is free, but (1,2) wall.\n\nFrom (1,4), I can go down to (1,3), or left wall, right to (2,4) but (2,4) wall, up to (1,5) body.\n\nSo only down to (1,3).\n\nThen from (1,3), down to (1,2) wall, left wall, right to (2,3) , up to (1,4) body.\n\nSo only right to (2,3) if free.\n\nBut (2,3) is body now, but later it might be free.\n\nThis seems like a dead end.\n\nIf I go from (1,5) to (2,5), then from (2,5) I can go to (2,4) wall, or down to (2,4) invalid, or left to (1,5) body, or right to (3,5) body, so no move, trapped.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAfter turn 78 move to (2,5): positions head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), etc.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves:\n- Down to (2,4): but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n- Up to (2,6): body, occupied, and reverse if direction, but direction D, up is reverse, invalid.\n- Left to (1,5): free\n- Right to (3,5): body, occupied\n\nSo only left to (1,5).\n\nThen from (1,5), as before, can move down to (1,4) or right to (2,5) body, or left wall, up to (1,6) if free.\n\nAfter move to (2,5), positions: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nSo (1,5) is free, (1,6) is free? Not occupied.\n\nFrom (1,5), after moving there, direction from (2,5) to (1,5) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen moves: down to (1,4), up to (1,6), left wall, right to (2,5) body.\n\nSo can move to (1,4) or (1,6).\n\nBoth free.\n\nIf move to (1,6), then from there only down to (1,5), but (1,5) may be occupied later, but at that time it might be free.\n\nBut eventually, it leads to the bottom.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (1,4), then to (1,3), then to (2,3) if free, but (2,3) is body now, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nFor example, on turn 78, if I move down to (2,5), then on turn 79 move to (1,5), then on turn 80 move to (1,4), then on turn 81 move to (1,3), then from (1,3) to (2,3) if free.\n\nBut at that time, (2,3) might not be occupied.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPerhaps the best move is to go down to (2,5) on turn 78, then to (1,5) on turn 79, then to (1,4) on turn 80, etc.\n\nBut for the food, (3,2) will be gone soon, so forget it.\n\n(4,4) has time.\n\nAlso, there is space at the bottom or other areas.\n\nAnother idea: the snake is long, 15 segments, so it occupies many cells, but there are free cells.\n\nFor example, bottom left: (1,1), (1,0) wall, (2,1), etc, but (1,2) obstacle, so (1,1) may be free, but near walls.\n\nTop right has obstacles, but some space.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nGrid size 8x8, walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions: as above.\n\nFree cells: for example, (0,1) to (0,6) but x=0 wall, so not.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but borders are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) except walls.\n\nInternal walls are cells that are walls.\n\nSo free cells: all cells not wall and not snake.\n\nFor example, (1,1), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,5), (3,1), (3,7) y=7 wall, etc.\n\nBut y=7 wall, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly x from 1 to 6.\n\nBut (2,4) wall, (1,2) wall, (5,1) wall, (6,1) wall, (6,4) wall.\n\nSo free cells include (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2) but (3,2) snake, etc.\n\nAt current, many are occupied.\n\nBut after moves, some free.\n\nFor long-term, moving down to (2,5) might be better because it avoids the potential dead end at (1,6).\n\nIf I move left to (1,6), then I must go down to (1,5), then I have choices, but it might be tight.\n\nWith move down to (2,5), then to (1,5), then I can go to (1,4) or (1,6), then to other places.\n\nFor example, from (1,5), if I go to (1,4), then to (1,3), then to (2,3) if free.\n\nOn turn 80 or later.\n\nBut let's decide on turn 78 action.\n\nSince both moves seem possible, but moving down might be safer for now.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,4) can be targeted later.\n\nSo for turn 78, I think move down to (2,5).\n\nThen for future turns, I can plan.\n\nThe answer should include multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nSo I need to plan a sequence.\n\nCurrent turn 78.\n\nAction for turn 78: D to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 79: from (2,5), only possible move is L to (1,5) because down to (2,4) wall, right to (3,5) body, up reverse.\n\nSo move L to (1,5)\n\nDirection: from (2,5) to (1,5) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen turn 80: from (1,5), can move D to (1,4) or U to (1,6)\n\nBoth are free now.\n\nIf I move D to (1,4), then from there, can move D to (1,3) or R to (2,4) but (2,4) wall, or L wall, U to (1,5) body.\n\nSo only D to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 81: from (1,3), can move R to (2,3) if free, or U to (1,4) body, D to (1,2) wall, L wall.\n\nSo only R to (2,3) if free.\n\nAt that time, (2,3) might be free or not.\n\nSimilarly, if from (1,5) I move U to (1,6) on turn 80, then from (1,6) only D to (1,5), but (1,5) may be body, occupied, so invalid, as before.\n\nAfter move to (1,5) on turn 79, positions: let's not list, but (1,6) is free at that time.\n\nFrom (1,5) move U to (1,6), then from (1,6) only D to (1,5), which will be occupied after move, so it's invalid to move back immediately, but in terms of position, when at (1,6), (1,5) is body, so cannot move there.\n\nSo from (1,6), only possible move is D to (1,5), but it's occupied, so no valid move, death.\n\nTherefore, from (1,5), I must move D to (1,4), not U to (1,6), because that leads to trap.\n\nSimilarly, in the other path.\n\nSo on turn 80, from (1,5), move D to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 81, from (1,4) move D to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 82, from (1,3) move R to (2,3) if free.\n\nBut at that time, it might be free.\n\nTo avoid risk, perhaps on turn 78, moving down is better, but it leads to the same area.\n\nIf I move left on turn 78 to (1,6), then turn 79 to (1,5), then turn 80 to (1,4), etc, same as above.\n\nSo either way, I end up going down to (1,3) area.\n\nBut on turn 82, from (1,3) to (2,3), which is now body, but after several moves, it might be free.\n\nFor example, on turn 78 move D to (2,5)\n\nTurn 79 move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 80 move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 81 move D to (1,3)\n\nNow on turn 81, after move to (1,3), positions depend on previous.\n\nBut (2,3) might be free or not.\n\nInitially, (2,3) is body, but as snake moves, it changes.\n\nPerhaps I can assume that after few moves, (2,3) is free.\n\nBut to be precise, let's think about the food at (4,4).\n\nPerhaps I should try to move towards the center or other areas.\n\nFrom current head (2,6), if I move down to (2,5), then to (1,5), then instead of down, on turn 80 from (1,5) I can move to (1,6) but as we saw, it's bad, so must move to (1,4).\n\nThen to (1,3), then to (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (3,3) or (2,2) etc.\n\nBut there is food at (3,2) and (4,4), but (3,2) may be gone.\n\nLife span of (3,2) is 3, so on turn 78,79,80 present, gone turn 81.\n\nOn turn 81, it's gone, so no need to worry.\n\n(4,4) life span 8, present until turn 85.\n\nOn turn 81, head at (1,3), far from (4,4), so hard to eat.\n\nBut the snake can move there.\n\nPerhaps for now, on turn 78, move D to (2,5), then turn 79 L to (1,5), turn 80 D to (1,4), turn 81 D to (1,3), then turn 82 R to (2,3), assuming (2,3) is free.\n\nAt that point, (2,3) may be free.\n\nFor example, after several moves, the tail has moved.\n\nBut it's vague.\n\nI think I should output the actions for 5 turns.\n\nSo for turn 78: D\n\nThen turn 79: from (2,5), move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 80: from (1,5), move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 81: from (1,4), move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 82: from (1,3), move R to (2,3) if possible, but at that time it might be free.\n\nBut in the plan, I can assume it is free.\n\nTo be safe, perhaps choose the move that avoids risks.\n\nAnother idea: from current position, move down to (2,5), then on turn 79 to (1,5), then on turn 80 to (1,6) but that is invalid, so only to (1,4), etc.\n\nI think I have to go with that.\n\nPerhaps for turn 78, moving down is the way to go.\n\nSo let's set the actions.\n\nTurn 78: D\n\nTurn 79: L (to (1,5))\n\nTurn 80: D (to (1,4))\n\nTurn 81: D (to (1,3))\n\nTurn 82: R (to (2,3))\n\nThen for turn 83, from (2,3), can move to (3,3) or (2,2) or (2,4) wall, etc.\n\nBut (3,3) may be body or free.\n\nBut we don't need to specify beyond.\n\nThe answer should be for turns 78 to 82 or so.\n\nBut let's see the food at (4,4).\n\nAfter turn 82, head at (2,3), then I can move towards (4,4).\n\nBut (4,4) might be free by then.\n\nFor example, the body will move, and after several moves, (4,4) could be free.\n\nBut it's not guaranteed.\n\nTo maximize score, I should try to eat it.\n\nBut for now, the sequence is to move down and left.\n\nSimilarly, if I moved left on turn 78, it would be similar.\n\nBut with move down, on turn 78, I have a choice on turn 80 to go to (1,6) but it's bad, so I go down.\n\nSo I think D on turn 78 is fine.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 78: D\n\nTurn 79: L\n\nTurn 80: D\n\nTurn 81: D\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nBut on turn 82, moving to (2,3), at that time it might be free, but in the sequence, it should be possible.\n\nTo be precise, let's assume the snake can move there.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way.\n\nNotice that the snake has a loop or something, but with obstacles, it might be tight.\n\nAnother thought: the head is at (2,6), and the body goes to (1,3), but there is an obstacle at (2,4), so the area below is separated.\n\nCells below y=4 or something.\n\nBut (2,5) is free, (2,4) wall, so from (2,5) I can go left to (1,5), then down to (1,4), etc.\n\nI think it's the only way.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned the next 5 turns (turns 78 to 82) by evaluating the grid, food positions, and potential risks. The key considerations are:\n- **Immediate risks**: Moving left to (1,6) on turn 78 leads to a potential dead end, as subsequent moves are restricted (e.g., on turn 79, only (1,5) is valid, and on turn 80, moving up to (1,6) is invalid due to body collision). Moving down to (2,5) on turn 78 avoids this and provides slightly more flexibility.\n- **Food prioritization**: The food at (3,2) has a short life span (disappears after turn 80) and is under the snake's body, making it difficult to eat safely within the timeframe. Attempting to eat it risks collisions or tail reward danger. The food at (4,4) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 85) and can be targeted later after the body moves away. Thus, immediate food is deprioritized for survival.\n- **Movement constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction instantly, so moves are chosen to avoid body/wall collisions and dead ends. The path focuses on moving toward open areas (bottom-left) to free space and reduce risk.\n- **Long-term survival**: The sequence avoids the bottom-left dead end by moving to (2,3) on turn 82, which should be free by then due to tail movement. This sets up potential access to the (4,4) food in later turns.\n\n### Action Sequence for Turns 78 to 82:\n- **Turn 78 (current turn)**: Move down (D) to (2,5).  \n  - Reason: Avoids the risky left move to (1,6), which forces the snake toward a dead end. Moving down keeps more options open and starts the descent to safer areas.\n- **Turn 79**: Move left (L) to (1,5).  \n  - Reason: From (2,5), down to (2,4) is blocked by a wall, and right to (3,5) is blocked by body. Left to (1,5) is the only valid move and progresses toward open cells.\n- **Turn 80**: Move down (D) to (1,4).  \n  - Reason: From (1,5), moving up to (1,6) would lead to a trap (on turn 81, only down to (1,5) is possible, but it would be occupied). Moving down to (1,4) is safe and continues the path away from walls.\n- **Turn 81**: Move down (D) to (1,3).  \n  - Reason: From (1,4), only down to (1,3) is valid (right to (2,4) is a wall, left is wall, up to (1,5) is body). This moves the snake to the bottom row, where (2,3) can be targeted next.\n- **Turn 82**: Move right (R) to (2,3).  \n  - Reason: From (1,3), only right to (2,3) is valid (down to (1,2) is a wall, left is wall, up to (1,4) is body). By turn 82, (2,3) should be free due to tail movement (it was occupied earlier but will vacate as the snake moves). This avoids the dead end and positions the snake to explore upward or rightward later for the (4,4) food.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- **Food consumption**: No food is eaten in this sequence, as the available food is under the body or too risky to reach. The focus is on survival and positioning for future opportunities.\n- **Risk mitigation**: The path avoids walls, body collisions, and dead ends. Moving to (2,3) on turn 82 should be safe, as the tail (originally at (1,3)) will have moved away.\n- **Future planning (beyond turn 82)**: From (2,3), the snake can move to (3,3) or (2,2) to access open areas and target the (4,4) food once it is freed from the body (likely within 2-3 turns as the snake shifts). Long-term, prioritize eating (4,4) when safe and explore the bottom-right for new food spawns.\n\nThis sequence prioritizes survival over the short-term +1 reward, ensuring the snake remains alive to score more points later.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 78: D\nTurn 79: L\nTurn 80: D\nTurn 81: D\nTurn 82: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. The current turn is 79. The grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid. Walls are at the borders and specific internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,5), and the body segments follow: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3). That's 15 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nHead direction is Down (D), meaning the snake is moving downwards. Since it's at (2,5) and direction is D, it probably moved to (2,5) from above, like from (2,4) or something. Let me list the positions in order:\n\nHead: (2,5)\n\nThen: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nTail is at (2,3).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,2) with life span 2 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,4) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,5) with life span 10 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so they're all good to eat.\n\nI need to plan the next moves, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls: borders are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: I should map the snake on the grid.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction D.\n\nBody: (2,6) — above head? y=6 is above y=5 if we consider y increasing upwards? No, in grids, often y=0 is top or bottom. The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might be up or down depending on coordinate system.\n\nLet's clarify the coordinate system. Typically in such games, (0,0) is top-left, and y increases downwards. But here, U is (x,y+1), which would mean y+1 is up or down?\n\nThe movement definitions:\n\n- U: (x, y+1) — so if y+1, and U is up, that means y increases downwards? I think I have a confusion.\n\nStandard: if (0,0) is top-left, then:\n\n- U: up, so y decreases? No.\n\nLet's read: U (x,y+1) — it says U (up) is (x,y+1). So if y+1 is up, that means y=0 is bottom? Or what?\n\nPerhaps I should think in terms of coordinates.\n\nAssume (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases upwards. Then U (up) would be (x, y+1), D (down) (x, y-1), L (left) (x-1,y), R (right) (x+1,y).\n\nBut in the wall description, it says \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", and internal obstacles given as coordinates.\n\nAlso, in snake positions, (2,5) to (2,6) — if y=6 is higher y, and direction is D, down, meaning from higher y to lower y? Direction D means snake is moving down, so to decreasing y if y=0 is bottom.\n\nI think it's consistent to assume (0,0) is bottom-left, y increasing upwards. So:\n\n- U: (x, y+1) — up, increasing y\n\n- D: (x, y-1) — down, decreasing y\n\n- L: (x-1, y) — left, decreasing x\n\n- R: (x+1, y) — right, increasing x\n\nFor example, head at (2,5), direction D, so it came from (2,6), since moving down to (2,5).\n\nPrevious position was (2,6), which is in the body.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (3,2) life 2, value 1\n\n- (4,4) life 7, value 1\n\n- (4,5) life 10, value 1\n\nNotice that (4,5) is also a snake body segment? Snake positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), etc.\n\n(4,5) is listed as a body segment, and also there is food at (4,5) with life 10.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) has food and is a body segment? Snake has (4,4) as well? Positions: after (3,5) is (3,4), then (4,4), then (4,3), etc. So (4,4) is a body segment.\n\nAnd food at (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nAlso, (3,2) has food, and (3,2) is a body segment? Snake positions: ... (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3). So (3,2) is a body segment with food on it.\n\nSo all food items are currently under the snake's body.\n\nRule for eating: food under body can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, let's list all occupied cells.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: 15 segments.\n\n(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (3,2) with life 2, value 1\n\n- (4,4) with life 7, value 1\n\n- (4,5) with life 10, value 1\n\nAll under body.\n\nLife span: decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 79, life span decreases? The state is given at turn 79, so for food, life span is as given, and will decrease to 1 on turn 80, then 0 on turn 81 for (3,2), since life span 2 now.\n\nFor (3,2): life span 2 at turn 79, so after turn 79, it will have life 1, then after turn 80, life 0, so disappears after turn 80, meaning on turn 81 it's gone? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it exists for L more turns, including turn t.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life_span L, then at turn t+1, life_span L-1, ..., at turn t+L-1, life_span 1, then after turn t+L-1, it disappears, so on turn t+L, it's gone.\n\nSo for (3,2): at turn 79, life_span 2, so it exists on turn 79 and 80, disappears on turn 81.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4): life_span 7 at turn 79, exists until turn 85 (79+6? Let's calculate: from turn 79 to turn 79+7-1=85, life_span 1 on turn 85, disappears on turn 86.\n\nTurn t, life_span L: present on turns t to t+L-1, absent on turn t+L.\n\nSo (3,2): L=2, present turn 79 and 80, gone turn 81.\n\n(4,4): L=7, present turn 79 to 85, gone turn 86.\n\n(4,5): L=10, present turn 79 to 88, gone turn 89.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,5), direction D (down). So possible moves: since direction is D, it can move D (continue down), L (left), R (right), but not U, because U is opposite, no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U on next turn.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5):\n\n- D: down to (2,4)\n\n- L: left to (1,5)\n\n- R: right to (3,5)\n\nBut need to check for collisions or walls.\n\nFirst, (2,4): is it wall or snake body?\n\nWalls: internal obstacles include (2,4), yes! (2,4) is an internal obstacle wall.\n\nAlso, borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (2,4) is not border, but internal wall at (2,4).\n\nSo (2,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nL: (1,5): is it wall or snake?\n\nx=1, y=5. Borders: x=0 and x=7 walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. x=1 not border, y=5 not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is wall, but (1,5) not listed, so should be free, but is it occupied by snake?\n\nSnake positions: let's list all snake cells: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)\n\n(1,5) not in list, so free, but need to check if it's wall. Internal walls: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,2) is wall, but (1,5) is not wall. So (1,5) should be free.\n\nR: (3,5): is it snake? Yes, (3,5) is a body segment. Snake positions include (3,5), which is the 8th segment? Positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — yes, (3,5) is occupied by snake body.\n\nSo moving to (3,5) would be body collision, death.\n\nTherefore, from (2,5), possible moves:\n\n- D: to (2,4) — but (2,4) is wall, cannot.\n\n- L: to (1,5) — possible, free cell.\n\n- R: to (3,5) — occupied by body, cannot.\n\n- U: to (2,6) — but U is opposite direction? Current direction D, so moving U would be reverse, not allowed. Also, (2,6) is occupied by body, but even if not, reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (1,5).\n\nIs that right? Head at (2,5), direction D, so last move was from (2,6) to (2,5), so moving back to (2,6) is U, which is opposite, not allowed.\n\nAnd (2,4) wall, (3,5) body, so only (1,5) is free.\n\nBut (1,5) is adjacent? x=1, y=5, yes.\n\nNow, after moving to (1,5), what happens?\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, on turn 79, I must choose action.\n\nAvailable actions: only L to (1,5), since D and R are blocked, U not allowed.\n\nIs there any other direction? No, only three choices, but D and R invalid, U invalid, so only L.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nGrid: let's make a mental map.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls:\n\n- All x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n\n- Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (2,5), body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)\n\nFood under body: (3,2), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nNow, from (2,5), moving L to (1,5):\n\n(1,5) is free? x=1, y=5.\n\nNot border wall, not internal wall (internal walls at (1,2), not (1,5)), not snake (snake at (2,5), (2,6), etc., no (1,5)).\n\nSo yes, only possible move is L to (1,5).\n\nSo for turn 79, action must be L.\n\nThen head moves to (1,5), direction becomes L (since moved left).\n\nSnake body: the tail will move? When snake moves, head goes to new position, and each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nNo food eaten at (1,5), so tail is removed. Tail is at (2,3), so after move, snake positions: new head (1,5), then the previous head (2,5) becomes second segment, and so on, up to the segment before tail, which was (2,3)? Let's trace.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: (2,5) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (5,6), 5: (5,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (3,4), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,3), 11: (4,2), 12: (3,2), 13: (3,3), 14: (2,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (1,5), new head (1,5). Then segment 1 moves to (2,5), segment 2 to (2,6)? No.\n\nThe body follows: the segment that was at index 1 moves to where head was, but since head moves to new cell, the first body segment moves to the old head position, and so on.\n\nSo after move:\n\n- New head: (1,5)\n\n- Segment 1: old head position (2,5)\n\n- Segment 2: old position of segment 1, which was (2,6)\n\n- Segment 3: old position of segment 2, (3,6)\n\n- ...\n\n- Segment 14: old position of segment 13, which was (3,3)\n\n- And the tail (old segment 14) is removed, so (2,3) is free now.\n\nList:\n\nNew positions:\n\nHead: (1,5)  // new\n\nSegment 1: (2,5)  // old head\n\nSegment 2: (2,6)  // old seg1\n\nSegment 3: (3,6)  // old seg2\n\nSegment 4: (4,6)  // old seg3\n\nSegment 5: (5,6)  // old seg4\n\nSegment 6: (5,5)  // old seg5\n\nSegment 7: (4,5)  // old seg6\n\nSegment 8: (3,5)  // old seg7\n\nSegment 9: (3,4)  // old seg8\n\nSegment 10: (4,4)  // old seg9\n\nSegment 11: (4,3)  // old seg10\n\nSegment 12: (4,2)  // old seg11\n\nSegment 13: (3,2)  // old seg12\n\nSegment 14: (3,3)  // old seg13\n\nAnd old tail (2,3) is gone.\n\nNow, the body segments: from seg1 to seg14, but seg14 is now at (3,3), which was previously occupied, but now the snake has 15 segments? Head plus 14 body, but when no food eaten, length same, so tail removed, so new snake has head and 14 body segments? Original had 15 positions, after move, head to new, tail removed, so 14 segments? Let's count.\n\nOriginal: 15 positions.\n\nAfter move: head to new cell, and tail cell vacated, so new snake has 14 positions: head + 13 body segments? Positions: head + segments 1 to 13? I think I confused indexing.\n\nBetter: the snake is a list of positions. When it moves without eating, the head moves to a new position, and the tail is removed. So the new list has all except the last position.\n\nOriginal positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P14, with P0 head, P14 tail.\n\nAfter move to new head position N:\n\nNew head: N\n\nNew body: P0, P1, P2, ..., P13\n\nSo the segment that was P0 is now the first body segment, at position P0.\n\nSimilarly, P1 to P13 become body segments.\n\nIn this case, new head at (1,5)\n\nThen body: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n(3,3) is the new tail.\n\nAnd (2,3) is free now.\n\nFood: (3,2) is still under body? (3,2) is now occupied by a body segment, segment 12? New positions: head (1,5), then:\n\n1: (2,5)\n\n2: (2,6)\n\n3: (3,6)\n\n4: (4,6)\n\n5: (5,6)\n\n6: (5,5)\n\n7: (4,5)\n\n8: (3,5)\n\n9: (3,4)\n\n10: (4,4)  // food here\n\n11: (4,3)\n\n12: (4,2)  // no food at (4,2)? Food is at (3,2), (4,4), (4,5)\n\n(4,5) is at position 7: (4,5)\n\n(4,4) at position 10: (4,4)\n\n(3,2) at position 12: (3,2)? Position 12 is (4,2), no.\n\nNew body positions:\n\nIndex: 1: (2,5), 2: (2,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (5,6), 6: (5,5), 7: (4,5), 8: (3,5), 9: (3,4), 10: (4,4), 11: (4,3), 12: (4,2), 13: (3,2), tail: (3,3) is missing? Positions: head, then 13 body segments? Let's list:\n\n- Head: (1,5)\n\n- Body1: (2,5)  // old head\n\n- Body2: (2,6)  // old body1\n\n- Body3: (3,6)  // old body2\n\n- Body4: (4,6)  // old body3\n\n- Body5: (5,6)  // old body4\n\n- Body6: (5,5)  // old body5\n\n- Body7: (4,5)  // old body6\n\n- Body8: (3,5)  // old body7\n\n- Body9: (3,4)  // old body8\n\n- Body10: (4,4)  // old body9\n\n- Body11: (4,3)  // old body10\n\n- Body12: (4,2)  // old body11\n\n- Body13: (3,2)  // old body12\n\n- Tail: (3,3)  // old body13? Original had body13 (3,3) and body14 (2,3), but body14 was tail, removed.\n\nOriginal: positions: 0: (2,5) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (5,6), 5: (5,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (3,4), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,3), 11: (4,2), 12: (3,2), 13: (3,3), 14: (2,3) tail.\n\nAfter move: new head (1,5), then body: old position 0: (2,5), old pos1: (2,6), old pos2: (3,6), old pos3: (4,6), old pos4: (5,6), old pos5: (5,5), old pos6: (4,5), old pos7: (3,5), old pos8: (3,4), old pos9: (4,4), old pos10: (4,3), old pos11: (4,2), old pos12: (3,2), and old pos13: (3,3) becomes the new tail. Old tail pos14 (2,3) removed.\n\nSo new snake: head (1,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), tail (3,3)\n\nSo 15 segments? Head + 14 body segments? Head (1,5), then 14 positions from (2,5) to (3,3), but (3,3) is tail, so it's 15 cells: head and 14 body, but when no food eaten, length should be same, original 15, after move still 15? No.\n\nMistake: when snake moves without eating, the head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length decreases by one? No.\n\nStandard snake: when no food, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length same as before, not decreased.\n\nInitial length L, after move, new head, and the last L-1 segments, so length L.\n\nIn this case, original snake has 15 segments. After moving to new cell without eating, new snake has the new head and the first 14 segments of the old snake, but the old segments are shifted.\n\nOld snake: positions P0 to P14, length 15.\n\nAfter move to N: new positions: N, P0, P1, P2, ..., P13. So from N to P13, that's 15 positions: N (new head), P0 (now body), P1, ..., P13 (new tail). P13 was the second last, now last.\n\nIn this case, P13 is (3,3), which was old body13, now new tail.\n\nAnd P14 (2,3) removed.\n\nSo new snake: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n(3,3) is tail.\n\nFood: (3,2) is occupied by body, (4,4) occupied by body, (4,5) occupied by body.\n\nLife span: at turn 80, life span decreases.\n\nTurn 80: t1+1 = 80.\n\nFood:\n\n(3,2) life span was 2 at turn 79, so at turn 80, life span 1.\n\n(4,4) was 7, now 6\n\n(4,5) was 10, now 9\n\nNow, head at (1,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves from (1,5):\n\n- U: (1,6)\n\n- D: (1,4)\n\n- L: (0,5) but x=0 is wall, cannot\n\n- R: (2,5) but (2,5) is now body segment, occupied.\n\n(2,5) is the first body segment, so moving to (2,5) would be collision.\n\nAlso, cannot move L to wall.\n\nSo possible: U to (1,6) or D to (1,4)\n\nNow, (1,6): y=6, not border wall, but y=7 is wall, y=6 is not. Internal walls? (1,6) not listed, so free? But is it occupied? Snake: head at (1,5), body at (2,5), (2,6), etc. (1,6) not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4): not border, not internal wall (internal (1,2) but (1,4) not), not snake.\n\nSo both U and D possible.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there might be food to consider, but currently no food at (1,6) or (1,4), I think.\n\nFood only at (3,2), (4,4), (4,5), all under body.\n\nTo eat them, need to move the body away and then head to it.\n\nBut life span short for (3,2), only 1 turn left.\n\nAt turn 80, (3,2) has life 1, so after turn 80, it disappears, so only on turn 80 it can be eaten, but it's under body.\n\nSimilarly, others have more time.\n\nBut first, for turn 79, we must move L to (1,5), as only choice.\n\nThen for turn 80, from (1,5), we can go U or D.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid.\n\nAlso, tail is at (3,3), and food at (3,2), which is adjacent to tail? (3,2) and tail (3,3) are adjacent vertically.\n\nBut (3,2) is occupied by body, not tail.\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, food is on body, not necessarily tail.\n\nFor now, at turn 80, head at (1,5), can go U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nIf go U to (1,6), then direction U.\n\nThen possible moves from there, etc.\n\nBut let's see what's around.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the long-term goal.\n\nThe snake is long, 15 segments, and the grid has obstacles, so space might be tight.\n\nFree cells: total cells 8x8=64, walls: border 32 cells? Not all border cells are walls, only the outer layer.\n\nx=0, all y=0 to 7: 8 cells\n\nx=7, all y: 8 cells\n\ny=0, all x, but x=0 and x=7 already counted, so y=0, x=1 to 6: 6 cells\n\nSimilarly y=7, x=1 to 6: 6 cells\n\nSo border walls: 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 cells? Let's calculate:\n\nCorners counted once.\n\nx=0: y=0 to 7: 8 cells\n\nx=7: y=0 to7: 8 cells\n\ny=0: x=1 to6: 6 cells (since x=0 and x=7 done)\n\ny=7: x=1 to6: 6 cells\n\nTotal border walls: 8+8+6+6=28 cells\n\nInternal obstacles: 5 cells: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo total walls: 28 + 5 = 33 cells\n\nSnake: 15 cells\n\nFood: 3 cells, but under snake, so occupied.\n\nFree cells: 64 - 33 walls - 15 snake = 16 free cells, but food is on snake cells, so not additional occupied, so free cells are 16.\n\nBut food cells are occupied by snake, so they are part of the 15 snake cells.\n\nAvailable empty cells: 64 - 33 walls - 15 snake = 16, yes.\n\nWith internal obstacles, it might be fragmented.\n\nBut for now, on turn 79, only choice is L to (1,5).\n\nSo action for turn 79: L\n\nThen turn 80, from (1,5), head direction L, can move U or D.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nSince (3,2) food has short life, only available on turn 80 (life span 1 at turn 80), then gone.\n\nBut to eat it, head needs to move to (3,2) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, (3,2) is occupied by body.\n\nIn the new snake, (3,2) is a body segment.\n\nTo free it, the snake needs to move so that (3,2) is vacated.\n\nCurrently, after turn 79 move, snake is at (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n(3,2) is the second last body segment, before tail (3,3).\n\nWhen the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail moves, so (3,3) will be vacated if snake moves away, but (3,2) is before that.\n\nTo vacate (3,2), the snake needs to move in such a way that the segment at (3,2) moves to another position.\n\nFor example, if on turn 80, snake moves, the body segment at (3,2) will move to where the next segment was, but it's fixed.\n\nWhen snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo for (3,2), it is currently occupied by a body segment. When snake moves, that segment will move to the position of the segment ahead of it in the chain.\n\nThe segment at (3,2) is followed by tail at (3,3).\n\nWhen snake moves, the tail will move to a new position if the head moves, but the segment at (3,2) will move to where the segment before it was, which is (4,2)? In the chain, the segments are connected.\n\nFrom the list: the body segments are in order: after head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), tail (3,3)\n\nSo the segment at (4,2) is before (3,2), and (3,2) is before (3,3).\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to new position, say N.\n\nThen the first body segment moves to old head position (1,5)\n\nThe second body segment moves to old first body position (2,5)\n\nAnd so on, down to the tail: the segment that was at (3,2) will move to the position of the previous segment, which is (4,2)? Let's see the order.\n\nThe body segments are ordered from head to tail.\n\nSo when moving, each segment inherits the position of the previous one.\n\nSpecifically, for a body segment at position i, after move, it moves to the position that was occupied by the segment closer to head.\n\nIn this case, the segment at (3,2) is the 13th position? Head is position 0, body1 at (2,5), body2 at (2,6), ..., let's index.\n\nSet:\n\nAt turn 80 start: positions:\n\n0: head (1,5)\n\n1: body (2,5)\n\n2: body (2,6)\n\n3: body (3,6)\n\n4: body (4,6)\n\n5: body (5,6)\n\n6: body (5,5)\n\n7: body (4,5)\n\n8: body (3,5)\n\n9: body (3,4)\n\n10: body (4,4)\n\n11: body (4,3)\n\n12: body (4,2)\n\n13: body (3,2)\n\n14: tail (3,3)\n\nWhen snake moves to new head position N:\n\nNew position 0: N\n\nNew position 1: old position 0 (1,5)\n\nNew position 2: old position 1 (2,5)\n\nNew position 3: old position 2 (2,6)\n\n...\nNew position 13: old position 12 (4,2)\n\nNew position 14: old position 13 (3,2)\n\nAnd old position 14 (3,3) is vacated.\n\nSo the cell (3,2) is now occupied by the new tail, position 14.\n\nAfter move, the cell that was (3,2) is now occupied by the segment that was there, but it moves to old position 12 or something.\n\nIn this case, after move, the cell (3,2) is no longer occupied by the same segment; the segment moves.\n\nFor example, if no move to eat, after move, the segment that was at (3,2) (position 13) moves to new position 14, which is the tail position, and it goes to old position 13, which is (3,2)? Old position 13 is (3,2), so the segment moves to where it was? No.\n\nWhen the head moves to N, the body segment at index 1 moves to old position 0, index 2 moves to old position 1, ..., index 13 moves to old position 12, index 14 moves to old position 13.\n\nIn this case, index 13 (body at (3,2)) moves to old position 12, which is (4,2)\n\nIndex 14 (tail at (3,3)) moves to old position 13, which is (3,2)\n\nThen the old position 14 (3,3) is vacated.\n\nSo after move, the cell (3,2) is occupied by the new tail, which came from (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is occupied by the segment that was at (3,2), and so on.\n\nFor food at (3,2): at turn 80 start, it is occupied by body index 13.\n\nAfter the snake moves, if no food eaten, the cell (3,2) will be occupied by the new tail, which moved from (3,3) to (3,2).\n\nSo the food is still under the snake, at the tail position.\n\nTo eat the food at (3,2), the head needs to move to (3,2) when it is free and has food.\n\nBut at turn 80, (3,2) is occupied, so it can't be eaten on turn 80.\n\nAfter the move on turn 80, (3,2) is occupied by tail, so not free.\n\nOn turn 81, if the snake moves and the tail moves away, then (3,2) might be free, but food disappears on turn 81, since life span 1 at turn 80, so after turn 80, it disappears, so on turn 81, no food at (3,2).\n\nLife span: at turn 80, (3,2) has life span 1, so it exists during turn 80. After turn 80, life span 0, so gone on turn 81.\n\nTo eat it, it must be eaten on turn 80.\n\nBut on turn 80, (3,2) is occupied by a body segment, so head cannot move there; it's collision.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat the (3,2) food; it will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSimilarly, for other food, we can plan.\n\nSo for (3,2), we can ignore it; it's not eatable.\n\nNow, for turn 79, only choice is L, so action for turn 79: L\n\nThen for turn 80, head at (1,5), direction L, can move U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nLet's evaluate both options.\n\nFirst, option: move U to (1,6) on turn 80.\n\nThen new head (1,6), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves from (1,6):\n\n- U: (1,7) but y=7 is wall, cannot\n\n- D: (1,5) but (1,5) is now body segment (old head position), so collision\n\n- L: (0,6) x=0 wall, cannot\n\n- R: (2,6) but (2,6) is body segment, occupied\n\n(2,6) is body2, so occupied.\n\nSo from (1,6), all directions blocked or invalid? U wall, D body, L wall, R body. So no possible move, death.\n\nTherefore, moving U to (1,6) on turn 80 leads to death, not good.\n\nOnly other choice is D to (1,4) on turn 80.\n\nMove D to (1,4).\n\nThen new head (1,4), direction D (since moved down).\n\nNow, from (1,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: (1,5) but (1,5) is old head position, now body, occupied\n\n- D: (1,3)\n\n- L: (0,4) wall\n\n- R: (2,4) but (2,4) is internal wall, cannot\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,3)\n\n(1,3) is free? y=3, not border, not internal wall (internal (1,2) but (1,3) not), not snake.\n\nSnake at (1,5), (2,5), etc., no (1,3).\n\nSo move D to (1,3).\n\nThen on turn 81, head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (1,4) but (1,4) is now body? After move to (1,4) on turn 80, let's track positions.\n\nAt turn 80 start: head (1,5), body as above.\n\nMove D to (1,4)\n\nNew head (1,4)\n\nNew body: old head (1,5), then old body1 (2,5), old body2 (2,6), ..., up to old body13 (3,2), and new tail is old body14 (3,3)? Old positions:\n\nTurn 80 start:\n\n0: (1,5) head\n\n1: (2,5)\n\n2: (2,6)\n\n3: (3,6)\n\n4: (4,6)\n\n5: (5,6)\n\n6: (5,5)\n\n7: (4,5)\n\n8: (3,5)\n\n9: (3,4)\n\n10: (4,4)\n\n11: (4,3)\n\n12: (4,2)\n\n13: (3,2)\n\n14: (3,3) tail\n\nMove head to (1,4)\n\nNew head: (1,4)\n\nNew body1: old pos0 (1,5)\n\nNew body2: old pos1 (2,5)\n\nNew body3: old pos2 (2,6)\n\n...\nNew body13: old pos12 (4,2)\n\nNew body14: old pos13 (3,2)\n\nNew tail: old pos14 (3,3) moved to new position? New position 14 is old pos13 (3,2)\n\nLet's: new positions:\n\n0: (1,4) head\n\n1: (1,5)  // old head\n\n2: (2,5)  // old body1\n\n3: (2,6)  // old body2\n\n4: (3,6)  // old body3\n\n5: (4,6)  // old body4\n\n6: (5,6)  // old body5\n\n7: (5,5)  // old body6\n\n8: (4,5)  // old body7\n\n9: (3,5)  // old body8\n\n10: (3,4)  // old body9\n\n11: (4,4)  // old body10\n\n12: (4,3)  // old body11\n\n13: (4,2)  // old body12\n\n14: (3,2)  // old body13\n\nAnd old tail (3,3) vacated.\n\nSo tail now at (3,2)\n\nFood at (3,2) was there, but after move, the head moved to (1,4), no food eaten, so the food at (3,2) is still there, but now under the tail at (3,2).\n\nBut since not eaten, it remains.\n\nLife span: at turn 80, (3,2) had life span 1, so after turn 80, it disappears, so on turn 81, no food at (3,2).\n\nOther food: (4,4) at old body10 position, now at new body11: (4,4), life span at turn 80: was 6, after turn 80, 5.\n\nSimilarly (4,5) at old body7, now new body8: (4,5), life span was 9, now 8.\n\nBack to turn 81: head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (1,4) but (1,4) is now body segment (new body1), occupied\n\n- D: (1,2)\n\n- L: (0,3) wall\n\n- R: (2,3) but (2,3) is free? Not snake, not wall.\n\n(2,3): not border, internal walls: (2,4) is wall, but (2,3) not listed, so free.\n\nIs it occupied? Snake positions: head (1,3), body (1,4), (2,5), (2,6), etc., no (2,3), so free.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (1,2) or R to (2,3)\n\nBut (1,2) is internal wall? Internal obstacles: (1,2) is listed, so (1,2) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), so (1,2) is wall.\n\nTherefore, from (1,3), D to (1,2) is wall, not possible.\n\nL to (0,3) wall, not possible.\n\nU to (1,4) occupied, not possible.\n\nR to (2,3) possible.\n\nSo only move R to (2,3).\n\nThen on turn 81, move R to (2,3).\n\nNew head (2,3), direction R (since moved right).\n\nNow, (2,3) was previously the tail at turn 79, but now free.\n\nAfter move, new positions:\n\nNew head: (2,3)\n\nNew body1: old head (1,3)\n\nNew body2: old body1 (1,4)\n\nNew body3: old body2 (2,5)\n\n...\n\nBut let's list old turn 81 start positions:\n\nTurn 81 start: from above, after turn 80 move:\n\nHead: (1,3)  // but we are at turn 81 start, before move.\n\nAt the beginning of turn 81, positions are:\n\nFrom end of turn 80: head (1,4)? No.\n\nTurn 80 action: moved to (1,4), so at end of turn 80, snake positions as above: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)\n\nTail at (3,2)\n\nNow turn 81, head at (1,4), direction D.\n\nMove to (2,3)? But (2,3) is not adjacent? Head at (1,4), moving to (2,3) is not a valid move; adjacent means same x or y differ by 1.\n\n(1,4) to (2,3): x+1, y-1, which is diagonal, not allowed. Only U, D, L, R.\n\nFrom (1,4), possible moves: U (1,5), D (1,3), L (0,4) wall, R (2,4) wall.\n\nU to (1,5): occupied by body\n\nD to (1,3): free? (1,3) not wall, not snake? At turn 81 start, positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), etc., so (1,3) not occupied, not wall (internal (1,2) but (1,3) not), so free.\n\nR to (2,4) is wall.\n\nSo from (1,4), can move D to (1,3) or U to (1,5) but U to (1,5) occupied, so only D to (1,3).\n\nThen on turn 81, move D to (1,3).\n\nNew head (1,3), direction D.\n\nThen for turn 82, from (1,3), can move D, L, R, but L to (0,3) wall, D to (1,2) wall (internal), R to (2,3) free, U to (1,4) occupied.\n\nSo only R to (2,3).\n\nMove to (2,3).\n\nNew head (2,3), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 82, head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4), but (2,4) is wall, cannot\n\nD to (2,2)\n\nL to (1,3) occupied by body\n\nR to (3,3)\n\nNow, (3,3) is occupied? At turn 82 start, after previous move.\n\nLet's not get too deep; I need to think about the food.\n\nPerhaps for the immediate turns, we have to go this way.\n\nBut let's list the actions so far.\n\nTurn 79: must move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 80: from (1,5), move D to (1,4) (since U leads to death)\n\nTurn 81: from (1,4), move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 82: from (1,3), move R to (2,3)\n\nNow on turn 82, head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nPositions at turn 82 start: after turn 81 move to (1,3).\n\nAt turn 81 start: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)\n\nMove to (1,3): new head (1,3)\n\nNew body1: old head (1,4)\n\nNew body2: old body1 (1,5)\n\nNew body3: old body2 (2,5)\n\nNew body4: old body3 (2,6)\n\nNew body5: old body4 (3,6)\n\nNew body6: old body5 (4,6)\n\nNew body7: old body6 (5,6)\n\nNew body8: old body7 (5,5)\n\nNew body9: old body8 (4,5)\n\nNew body10: old body9 (3,5)\n\nNew body11: old body10 (3,4)\n\nNew body12: old body11 (4,4)\n\nNew body13: old body12 (4,3)\n\nNew body14: old body13 (4,2)\n\nNew tail: old body14 (3,2)  // moved to old body13 position? New position 14 is old position 13 (4,2)\n\nOld positions: body13 (4,2), body14 (3,2) tail.\n\nAfter move: new head (1,3)\n\nNew body1: old pos0 (1,4)\n\nNew body2: old pos1 (1,5)\n\nNew body3: old pos2 (2,5)\n\nNew body4: old pos3 (2,6)\n\nNew body5: old pos4 (3,6)\n\nNew body6: old pos5 (4,6)\n\nNew body7: old pos6 (5,6)\n\nNew body8: old pos7 (5,5)\n\nNew body9: old pos8 (4,5)\n\nNew body10: old pos9 (3,5)\n\nNew body11: old pos10 (3,4)\n\nNew body12: old pos11 (4,4)\n\nNew body13: old pos12 (4,3)\n\nNew body14: old pos13 (4,2)\n\nAnd old tail (3,2) vacated.\n\nSo tail at (4,2)\n\nFood at (4,2) is not there; food at (4,4) and (4,5).\n\n(4,4) is at new body12, (4,5) at new body9.\n\nLife span decreasing each turn.\n\nOn turn 82, head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (2,4) but (2,4) wall, cannot\n\n- D: (2,2)\n\n- L: (1,3) occupied by body (new body1)\n\n- R: (3,3)\n\n(3,3) is free? Not wall, not snake. Snake positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), tail (4,2)? Positions: head (2,3), body1 (1,3), body2 (1,4), body3 (1,5), body4 (2,5), body5 (2,6), body6 (3,6), body7 (4,6), body8 (5,6), body9 (5,5), body10 (4,5), body11 (3,5), body12 (3,4), body13 (4,4), body14 (4,3), tail (4,2)\n\nSo (3,3) not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) not wall, not occupied, free.\n\nInternal walls: (1,2), (2,4), etc., (2,2) not listed.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nIf move D to (2,2), then direction D.\n\nThen from (2,2), can move L, R, U, but U to (2,3) occupied, L to (1,2) wall, R to (3,2) but (3,2) is free? Not occupied, but food was there, gone.\n\n(3,2) free, but no food.\n\nD to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut we need to think about eating food.\n\nFood at (4,4) and (4,5) with longer life.\n\nFor example, (4,4) has life span at turn 79:7, turn 80:6, turn 81:5, turn 82:4, etc.\n\nSimilarly (4,5) turn 79:10, turn 80:9, etc.\n\nTo eat (4,4), it needs to be free and head move to it.\n\nCurrently, (4,4) is occupied by body.\n\nIn the current position, it's at body13 or something.\n\nThe snake is coiled, so we can uncoil to free space.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), if we move R to (3,3), then to (3,2) or (4,3), etc.\n\nLet's plan to go towards the food areas.\n\nFirst, for turn 82, from (2,3), move R to (3,3) or D to (2,2).\n\nIf move R to (3,3), then head at (3,3), direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3) occupied, R to (4,3)\n\n(3,4) is body? At turn 82 start, body12 at (3,4), so occupied.\n\n(4,3) is body14? Positions above, body14 at (4,3), occupied.\n\n(3,2) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo from (3,3), can move D to (3,2) or U to (3,4) occupied, L occupied, R occupied, so only D to (3,2).\n\nThen move to (3,2), which is free.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this is getting messy; I need to think strategically.\n\nThe snake is currently in the left part, and the food is at (4,4) and (4,5), which are in the center-right.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (2,4), (1,2), etc.\n\nPerhaps the snake should move down or right to open space.\n\nFrom the initial position, after moving to (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), then from (2,3), move to (3,3), then (3,2), then from (3,2), can move to (3,1) or (4,2), but (3,1) may be wall or free.\n\n(3,1): y=1, not border, internal walls: (5,1), (6,1), (1,2), so (3,1) not wall, free.\n\n(4,2) is tail or body.\n\nAt turn 82, after moving to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), tail (4,2)\n\nIf move R to (3,3), new head (3,3), new body1 (2,3), body2 (1,3), body3 (1,4), body4 (1,5), body5 (2,5), body6 (2,6), body7 (3,6), body8 (4,6), body9 (5,6), body10 (5,5), body11 (4,5), body12 (3,5), body13 (3,4), body14 (4,4), tail (4,3)\n\nTail at (4,3)\n\nFood at (4,4) is now at body14, (4,5) at body11.\n\nThen from (3,3), only move D to (3,2), new head (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (3,2) has no food.\n\nThen from (3,2), can move D to (3,1), or L to (2,2), or R to (4,2), but (4,2) is tail position, but after move, it changes.\n\nThis is taking too long; I should accept that for turn 79, only choice is L, and for turn 80, only choice is D, and so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 79, so turns 79 to 83 or something.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn 79: L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 80: D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 81: D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 82: from (1,3), move R to (2,3)\n\nTurn 83: from (2,3), can move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nLet's choose one.\n\nIf move R to (3,3) on turn 83.\n\nThen turn 84: from (3,3), move D to (3,2)\n\netc.\n\nBut to eat food, for example, at some point, when the tail moves, the food at (4,4) or (4,5) might be exposed.\n\n(4,4) is currently deep in the body.\n\nLife span is long, so we have time.\n\nFor instance, (4,4) life span at turn 82: since turn 79 life 7, turn 80 life 6, turn 81 life 5, turn 82 life 4, turn 83 life 3, etc.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) life 10 at turn 79, turn 82 life 7.\n\nSo we can plan to reach there.\n\nBut for now, for the answer, I can provide the necessary actions.\n\nSince the question is to think 5+ turns ahead, but for the output, I need to list actions for turns starting from t1=79.\n\nAlso, in the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 79: action\n\nTurn 80: action\n\n...\n\nUp to some turns.\n\nSince on turn 79 only one choice, I can set that.\n\nThen for turn 80, only one choice from (1,5) is D to (1,4), since U leads to death.\n\nThen turn 81 from (1,4) only D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 82 from (1,3) only R to (2,3)\n\nTurn 83 from (2,3): can move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nBoth are possible, but R to (3,3) might be better to go to the center.\n\nOr D to (2,2) to avoid the crowded area.\n\nBut (2,2) is near wall at (1,2) and (2,4), so might be dead end.\n\n(2,2): can move to (2,1), (3,2), etc.\n\n(3,2) might be free.\n\nBut let's not decide; for the answer, I can choose one.\n\nSince the food is at (4,4) and (4,5), moving right might be better.\n\nSo for turn 83, move R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 84 from (3,3) move D to (3,2) (only choice)\n\nThen turn 85 from (3,2) can move D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut I think for the purpose, I can stop at turn 83 or 84.\n\nThe answer should include actions for the current turn and a few ahead, but since the state is given at turn 79, action for turn 79 is first.\n\nAlso, in the format, it says \"action on turn t1\", \"action on turn t1+1\", etc.\n\nSo for t1=79, turn 79: L\n\nTurn 80: D\n\nTurn 81: D\n\nTurn 82: R (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 83: let's say R to (3,3)\n\nThen for turn 84: from (3,3) move D to (3,2)\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps I can list 5 turns.\n\nTurn 79 to 83.\n\nTurn 79: L\n\nTurn 80: D\n\nTurn 81: D\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nTurn 83: R  (to (3,3))\n\nBut on turn 83 from (2,3), moving R to (3,3) is valid.\n\nThen the next moves depend.\n\nBut for the answer, it should be fine.\n\nTo eat food, for example, if we continue, from (3,3) to (3,2), then from (3,2) to (4,2), but (4,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 83, if head at (3,3), positions change.\n\nBut I think it's acceptable.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 79: L\n\nTurn 80: D\n\nTurn 81: D\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nTurn 83: R\n\nThen for turn 84, it would be D, but not necessary.\n\nSince the food at (4,5) has long life, we can reach it later.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but food is on body, not necessarily tail.\n\nFor now, this should work.\n\nSo the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 79 and Beyond\n\nThe current state at turn 79 requires careful planning to maximize long-term survival and score, considering the snake's position, food life spans, and movement constraints. The snake is at [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)] with head at (2,5) and direction Down (D). Food is present at (3,2), (4,4), and (4,5), all under the snake's body and positive (value +1). Key constraints:\n- Movement from (2,5) is limited: Down to (2,4) is a wall, Right to (3,5) is a body collision, and Up is reverse (not allowed). Only Left to (1,5) is safe.\n- Food at (3,2) has life span 2 (disappears after turn 80), making it uneatable as it remains under the body until expiration.\n- Food at (4,4) and (4,5) have longer life spans (7 and 10 at turn 79, respectively), so they can be targeted later.\n- The snake must avoid dead ends and plan a path to free space and food.\n\n#### 5+ Turn Plan\n- **Turn 79 (current):** Only possible move is Left (L) to (1,5) to avoid immediate death. Direction becomes Left.\n- **Turn 80:** From (1,5), direction Left. Up to (1,6) leads to death (all moves blocked). Down to (1,4) is safe. Move Down (D) to (1,4). Direction becomes Down.\n- **Turn 81:** From (1,4), direction Down. Only Down to (1,3) is safe (Up to (1,5) occupied, Left and Right walls). Move Down (D) to (1,3). Direction remains Down.\n- **Turn 82:** From (1,3), direction Down. Only Right to (2,3) is safe (Down to (1,2) wall, Left wall, Up occupied). Move Right (R) to (2,3). Direction becomes Right.\n- **Turn 83:** From (2,3), direction Right. Down to (2,2) or Right to (3,3) are safe. Right to (3,3) is chosen to move toward the center and future food opportunities. Move Right (R) to (3,3). Direction remains Right.\n- **Turn 84 (beyond 5 turns for context):** From (3,3), direction Right. Only Down to (3,2) is safe (Up, Left, Right occupied). Move Down (D) to (3,2). Direction becomes Down.\n\nThis path avoids collisions, opens space, and positions the snake to potentially access food at (4,4) or (4,5) in later turns. Long-term, the snake should:\n- Monitor food life spans: (4,4) disappears after turn 85, (4,5) after turn 88.\n- Aim to free body-occupied food by moving the snake to vacate cells (e.g., by extending into open areas near (3,1) or (4,1)).\n- Avoid the \"tail reward danger\" by not eating food adjacent to the tail if the head would collide with the new tail segment.\n\n**Answer Format:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 79: L  \nTurn 80: D  \nTurn 81: D  \nTurn 82: R  \nTurn 83: R  \n}",

        "step": 80,
        "score": 14,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 80. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these are cells I can't move into.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,5), and the body segments follow. The snake is 15 segments long, since there are 15 positions listed. Head direction is L, which means left, so the snake is currently moving left.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,2) with value 1 and life span 1\n\n- (4,4) with value 1 and life span 6\n\n- (4,5) with value 1 and life span 9\n\nAll food has value 1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned here.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Since head direction is left, and I can't reverse instantly, my next move can't be right. So possible moves from (1,5) are up, down, or left, but not right.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,5). From here, moving:\n\n- Left: to (0,5), but x=0 is a wall, so I can't go there. Border wall.\n\n- Up: to (1,6)\n\n- Down: to (1,4)\n\n- Right: but that's reverse, not allowed since current direction is left.\n\nSo only possible moves are up or down. Left is blocked by wall.\n\nNow, what about the food?\n\nFood at (3,2): life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. But it's at (3,2), and I'm at (1,5), which is two steps away horizontally and three vertically. I can't reach it in one turn, since I can only move one cell per turn. Life span 1 means after this turn, it disappears, so if I don't eat it this turn, it's gone. But I'm not on it, so I can't eat it now. Since I'm at (1,5) and food at (3,2), I need at least two moves to get there, but life span is 1, so it will vanish before I can reach it. Therefore, this food is not reachable; I should ignore it.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 80, life span is 1, meaning after turn 80, it disappears. So during turn 80, if head moves onto it, it can be eaten. But since I'm not on it now, and I can move to adjacent cells, I can only move to (1,6), (1,4), or (0,5) but (0,5) is wall, so only (1,6) or (1,4). Neither is (3,2), so I cannot eat it this turn. Therefore, it will disappear after this turn, and I can't get it. So forget about that food.\n\nNext food: (4,4) value 1, life span 6. So it will last for 6 more turns, including turn 80. Life span 6 means it has 6 turns left, starting from now. After 6 turns, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) value 1, life span 9.\n\nNow, snake positions: let's list them to understand the body.\n\nSnake: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)]\n\nHead: (1,5)\n\nThen (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nTail is (3,3)\n\nNow, food at (4,4) and (4,5) are both on the snake's body? Let's see:\n\n(4,4) is in the snake positions: it's the 11th segment, counting from head. Positions: index 0: (1,5), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (4,6), 5: (5,6), 6: (5,5), 7: (4,5), 8: (3,5), 9: (3,4), 10: (4,4)? Let's list with indices:\n\n0: (1,5) head\n\n1: (2,5)\n\n2: (2,6)\n\n3: (3,6)\n\n4: (4,6)\n\n5: (5,6)\n\n6: (5,5)\n\n7: (4,5)\n\n8: (3,5)\n\n9: (3,4)\n\n10: (4,4)  // food is here?\n\nFood at (4,4), and snake has a segment at (4,4) which is position 10.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,5), and snake has segment at (4,5) which is position 7.\n\nThe rule says: food can spawn under snake body but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nFor (4,4): it's currently occupied by the snake, so to eat it, the body must move away first, then head moves in.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5).\n\nAlso, life span: (4,4) has life span 6, so it has 6 turns left, including turn 80. After 6 turns, it disappears.\n\n(4,5) has life span 9, more time.\n\nNow, I need to think about moving the snake.\n\nCurrent head at (1,5), direction left, but left is wall, so I must move up or down.\n\nOptions: up to (1,6) or down to (1,4).\n\nNow, check if these are safe.\n\nFirst, (1,6): is it occupied by body or wall?\n\nWalls: internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,6) is not listed, and borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,6) is within bounds, y=6 <7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles don't include (1,6), so no wall.\n\nNow, is it occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), ... (2,6) is at (2,6), which is different from (1,6). (1,6) is not in the list: let's see all positions: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3). None are (1,6), so it's empty. So moving up to (1,6) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, down to (1,4): (1,4) not in walls, not in snake positions? Snake has (1,5), but not (1,4). (1,4) is free? But internal obstacle at (1,2), but (1,4) is different. Walls: internal (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,4) is not listed, so should be free. Snake positions no (1,4), so also safe.\n\nBut (1,4) might be close to something? I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, direction: after moving, the head direction changes.\n\nBut for now, both up and down seem possible.\n\nNow, I need to consider the food on body.\n\nFood at (4,4) and (4,5) are on the snake body, so I need to plan to move the body away so I can eat them later.\n\nFirst, let's think about the tail. Tail is at (3,3), and there's food at (3,2) but it's disappearing after this turn, so irrelevant.\n\nFood at (3,2) has life span 1, so after turn 80, gone.\n\nNow, for (4,4) and (4,5), since they're on body, I need to free them up.\n\nBut to eat them, I must move the head there after the body moves.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,3), no food there, so not an issue now.\n\nFirst, I need to decide where to go.\n\nSince I'm at (1,5), and grid is small, I should map out the grid.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (1,5)\n\nBody: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) tail.\n\nFood: (3,2) but disappearing, (4,4) on body, (4,5) on body.\n\n(4,4) is a food and also a body segment, similarly (4,5).\n\nLife span: (4,4) has 6 turns, (4,5) has 9 turns.\n\nNow, from (1,5), I can go up to (1,6) or down to (1,4).\n\nIf I go up to (1,6):\n\nNew head position: (1,6)\n\nDirection becomes U (up)\n\nThen body moves: the tail end moves, but since no food eaten, length same, so tail moves away from (3,3) to the next segment? When snake moves without eating, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so tail is removed.\n\nSo after moving up to (1,6), new positions:\n\nHead: (1,6)\n\nThen body: previous head (1,5) becomes segment 1, then (2,5) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to (3,2) becomes second last, and (3,3) is tail, but since tail moves, (3,3) is no longer part of snake; the new tail is the previous position of the second last segment.\n\nLet's list the positions after move.\n\nCurrent positions: indices 0 to 14\n\nAfter move, head moves to new position, and each segment i moves to position of segment i-1 from previous state.\n\nAfter moving to (1,6):\n\nNew head: (1,6)\n\nThen segment 1: old head position (1,5)\n\nSegment 2: old segment 1 (2,5)\n\nSegment 3: old segment 2 (2,6)\n\nSegment 4: old segment 3 (3,6)\n\nSegment 5: old segment 4 (4,6)\n\nSegment 6: old segment 5 (5,6)\n\nSegment 7: old segment 6 (5,5)\n\nSegment 8: old segment 7 (4,5)\n\nSegment 9: old segment 8 (3,5)\n\nSegment 10: old segment 9 (3,4)\n\nSegment 11: old segment 10 (4,4)  // but (4,4) is still there, but now segment 11 is at (4,4)? No.\n\nOld segment 10 is (4,4), so new segment 11 is at old segment 10 position (4,4)\n\nBut (4,4) has food, but since the snake is moving, and head didn't eat, the food is still there, but now the body segment that was at (4,4) has moved to where? Let's see the positions.\n\nNew snake positions after moving U to (1,6):\n\n- Head: (1,6)\n\n- Seg1: (1,5)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (2,5)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (2,6)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (3,6)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: (4,6)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: (5,6)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: (5,5)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: (4,5)  // old seg7\n\n- Seg9: (3,5)  // old seg8\n\n- Seg10: (3,4)  // old seg9\n\n- Seg11: (4,4)  // old seg10, which was (4,4)\n\n- Seg12: (4,3)  // old seg11 (4,3)\n\n- Seg13: (4,2)  // old seg12 (4,2)\n\n- Seg14: (3,2)  // old seg13 (4,2)? Old seg12 is (4,2), old seg13 is (3,2), old seg14 is (3,3)\n\nPositions: old indices 0 to 14\n\nAfter move, new segment 0: (1,6)\n\nNew segment 1: old pos of 0: (1,5)\n\nNew segment 2: old pos of 1: (2,5)\n\nNew segment 3: old pos of 2: (2,6)\n\nNew segment 4: old pos of 3: (3,6)\n\nNew segment 5: old pos of 4: (4,6)\n\nNew segment 6: old pos of 5: (5,6)\n\nNew segment 7: old pos of 6: (5,5)\n\nNew segment 8: old pos of 7: (4,5)\n\nNew segment 9: old pos of 8: (3,5)\n\nNew segment 10: old pos of 9: (3,4)\n\nNew segment 11: old pos of 10: (4,4)  // so (4,4) is now occupied by segment 11\n\nNew segment 12: old pos of 11: (4,3)  // old seg11 was (4,3)\n\nOld positions: seg10: (4,4), seg11: (4,3), seg12: (4,2), seg13: (3,2), seg14: (3,3)\n\nSo new segment 11: old seg10 position: (4,4)\n\nNew segment 12: old seg11 position: (4,3)\n\nNew segment 13: old seg12 position: (4,2)\n\nNew segment 14: old seg13 position: (3,2)  // and the old tail (3,3) is gone.\n\nSo the food at (4,4) is still under the snake body, now at segment 11.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,5) was at old seg7 (4,5), which is now new seg8 position.\n\nOld seg7 was (4,5), new seg8 is at that position.\n\nSo both foods are still covered.\n\nIf I move down to (1,4), let's see.\n\nBut first, I need to think long-term.\n\nThe food at (4,4) has only 6 turns left, so I need to eat it within 6 turns.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) has 9 turns, more time.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 15 segments, so the body is coiled.\n\nI should aim to free up the food cells.\n\nFor example, food at (4,4) is currently occupied. To eat it, I need to move the snake such that the segment at (4,4) moves away, and then I move head there.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is closer to the head in terms of body segments? Not necessarily.\n\nLet's see the path from head to food.\n\nHead at (1,5), food at (4,4) and (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), which is not far.\n\nBut occupied.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, the body follows, so the occupied cells shift.\n\nI should consider the grid state.\n\nLet me list free cells or something.\n\nFirst, for turn 80, I need to choose move: U or D.\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), then from there, I can go U, D, L, R, but not D (since head direction would be U, so reverse is D not allowed).\n\nSimilarly, if I go D to (1,4), direction D, then next move can't be U.\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (4,4) with life span 6.\n\nIt will disappear after 6 turns, so by turn 86, it's gone. I need to eat it on or before turn 85.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) by turn 89.\n\nBut since I'm at (1,5), and (4,4) is at (4,4), I need to go there.\n\nBut it's occupied.\n\nSo I need to first move the body away from (4,4).\n\nThe segment at (4,4) will move when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if I move the snake, that segment will move to a new position.\n\nIn the current state, (4,4) is segment 10 or something.\n\nIn the move to (1,6), as above, new segment 11 is at (4,4), so it stays there for now.\n\nIf I move again, it will change.\n\nI should plan a path to get to (4,4) after the body moves away.\n\nSimilarly, the tail is at (3,3), and it will move as the snake moves.\n\nLet's think about the tail movement.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail moves away from its current position, so if there's food under tail, it might be freed if tail moves, but only if head moves onto it at the right time.\n\nBut here, food is not under tail.\n\nTail is at (3,3), no food.\n\nFood at (4,4) and (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is closer to head in the body chain.\n\nFrom head to tail, the body segments are in order.\n\nHead (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) tail.\n\nSo (4,5) is segment 7, (4,4) is segment 10.\n\nWhen the snake moves, segments move towards the tail direction.\n\nFor example, if I move the head, the segment that was at (4,4) will move to where the previous segment was, but it's a chain.\n\nPerhaps I need to move the snake in a way that the body vacates (4,4) soon.\n\nFor instance, if I can make the snake move such that the segment at (4,4) moves to a different cell, freeing (4,4), then I can move head there.\n\nBut it depends on how I move.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,4) has limited time.\n\nLife span 6, so after 6 moves, it's gone.\n\nTurn 80: current, life span 6 means it will disappear after turn 85? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 80, life span is 6, so after 6 turns, it disappears, meaning it is present on turns 80,81,82,83,84,85, and disappears after turn 85, so last chance to eat is on turn 85.\n\nSimilarly, for life span 1 at (3,2), it is present on turn 80, disappears after turn 80, so only eatable on turn 80 if head on it, which it's not.\n\nFor (4,4), I can eat it on turns 80 to 85.\n\nBut on turn 80, it's occupied, so I can't eat it now.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 81, etc, until it's free.\n\nI need to free it within 5 turns or so.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5), more time.\n\nNow, back to move choice.\n\nFrom (1,5), if I move up to (1,6), then head at (1,6), direction U.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U to (1,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (1,5), but that's reverse, not allowed since direction U.\n\nL to (0,6), x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,6), which is possible? (2,6) is occupied by body? In current state, (2,6) is segment 2, but after move to (1,6), let's see what is at (2,6).\n\nAfter moving to (1,6), the positions are as above: head at (1,6), seg1 at (1,5), seg2 at (2,5), seg3 at (2,6), etc.\n\nSo (2,6) is occupied by seg3.\n\nIf I move R to (2,6), that's where seg3 is, but after the move, when I move to (2,6), it might be occupied.\n\nAt the time of move, the snake body is at previous positions except head.\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to new cell, if that cell has food, eat, else the tail is removed.\n\nBut the body cells are occupied during the turn.\n\nSo if I try to move to a cell occupied by body, it's collision, death.\n\nIn this case, from (1,6), if I move to (2,6), but (2,6) is occupied by seg3, so it's body collision, I die.\n\nSimilarly, moving to other cells.\n\nFrom (1,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (1,5) but that's seg1 position, occupied, and also reverse direction, not allowed.\n\n- L: (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,6) occupied by seg3, so invalid.\n\nOh, so from (1,6), all moves are invalid? That can't be right.\n\nAfter moving to (1,6), the cells around:\n\n- Up: (1,7) is border wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (1,5) is now the position of segment 1, which is occupied by the body, so moving there would collide with body.\n\n- Left: (0,6) border wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,6) is position of segment 3, occupied.\n\nSo indeed, from (1,6), no possible moves! That means if I move to (1,6), I am trapped and die on the next turn.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet's confirm the positions after move to (1,6):\n\nHead: (1,6)\n\nSeg1: (1,5)  // so (1,5) occupied\n\nSeg2: (2,5)  // (2,5) occupied\n\nSeg3: (2,6)  // (2,6) occupied\n\nSeg4: (3,6)  // (3,6) occupied\n\netc.\n\nSo adjacent cells:\n\n- (1,7): wall, invalid\n\n- (1,5): occupied by seg1\n\n- (0,6): wall, invalid\n\n- (2,6): occupied by seg3\n\nYes, all adjacent cells are either wall or occupied, so no possible moves next turn. Therefore, moving to (1,6) leads to death on turn 81.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move up to (1,6); it's suicidal.\n\nNow, the only other option is to move down to (1,4).\n\nSo I must move down to (1,4).\n\nThen head at (1,4), direction D.\n\nNow, from there, I need to plan the next moves.\n\nFirst, turn 80: move D to (1,4)\n\nNow, after this move, snake positions:\n\nHead moves to (1,4)\n\nThen body: seg1: old head (1,5)\n\nSeg2: old seg1 (2,5)\n\nSeg3: old seg2 (2,6)\n\nSeg4: old seg3 (3,6)\n\nSeg5: old seg4 (4,6)\n\nSeg6: old seg5 (5,6)\n\nSeg7: old seg6 (5,5)\n\nSeg8: old seg7 (4,5)\n\nSeg9: old seg8 (3,5)\n\nSeg10: old seg9 (3,4)\n\nSeg11: old seg10 (4,4)\n\nSeg12: old seg11 (4,3)\n\nSeg13: old seg12 (4,2)\n\nSeg14: old seg13 (3,2)  // and tail (3,3) gone.\n\nOld seg13 was (3,2), old seg14 was (3,3), so new seg13: old seg12 position? Old positions: seg12: (4,2), seg13: (3,2), seg14: (3,3)\n\nAfter move:\n\nNew seg0: (1,4) head\n\nNew seg1: old seg0: (1,5)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1: (2,5)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2: (2,6)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3: (3,6)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4: (4,6)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5: (5,6)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6: (5,5)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7: (4,5)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8: (3,5)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9: (3,4)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10: (4,4)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11: (4,3)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12: (4,2)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13: (3,2)  // new tail at (3,2)\n\nFood: (3,2) had life span 1, but after turn 80, it disappears since life span decreases and was 1, so gone. But now, the tail is at (3,2), but no food there anymore, I think. Food disappears after the turn it times out.\n\nAt turn 80, food at (3,2) with life span 1: during turn 80, it exists, but after turn 80, it disappears. Since we didn't eat it on turn 80, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (4,4) life span now 5? After turn 80, life span decreases by 1.\n\nAt the start of turn 80, life span for (4,4) is 6, after turn 80, it becomes 5 for turn 81.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5).\n\nBut for now, after move to (1,4), head at (1,4), direction down.\n\nPossible moves from (1,4):\n\n- U to (1,5): but (1,5) is now seg1, occupied, and also reverse direction? Current direction is D, so moving U is reverse, not allowed.\n\n- D to (1,3)\n\n- L to (0,4): x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- R to (2,4)\n\nNow, (2,4): is it occupied or wall?\n\nWalls: internal obstacles include (2,4), yes, (2,4) is an internal obstacle! From state: internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n\nSo (2,4) is a wall, cannot move there.\n\nTherefore, from (1,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: not allowed, reverse and occupied\n\n- D: to (1,3)\n\n- L: wall\n\n- R: to (2,4) wall, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,3)\n\nThus, on turn 81, I must move down to (1,3)\n\nNow, let's go step by step.\n\nTurn 80: move D to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 81: move D to (1,3)\n\nAfter this move:\n\nHead to (1,3)\n\nDirection D\n\nPrevious head (1,4) becomes seg1\n\nThen seg2: old seg1 (1,5)\n\nSeg3: old seg2 (2,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNew positions:\n\nHead: (1,3)\n\nSeg1: (1,4)  // old head\n\nSeg2: (1,5)  // old seg1\n\nSeg3: (2,5)  // old seg2\n\nSeg4: (2,6)  // old seg3\n\nSeg5: (3,6)  // old seg4\n\nSeg6: (4,6)  // old seg5\n\nSeg7: (5,6)  // old seg6\n\nSeg8: (5,5)  // old seg7\n\nSeg9: (4,5)  // old seg8\n\nSeg10: (3,5)  // old seg9\n\nSeg11: (3,4)  // old seg10\n\nSeg12: (4,4)  // old seg11\n\nSeg13: (4,3)  // old seg12\n\nSeg14: (4,2)  // old seg13, and tail (3,2) gone? Old seg13 was (3,2), new seg13: old seg12 (4,2)? Old positions before this move: after turn 80, seg13 was (4,2), seg14 was (3,2)\n\nAfter move to (1,3) on turn 81:\n\nNew head: (1,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head (1,4)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (1,5)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (2,5)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (2,6)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (3,6)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (4,6)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (5,6)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (5,5)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (4,5)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (3,5)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (3,4)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (4,4)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (4,3)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (4,2)  // new tail at (4,2)\n\nNow, head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (1,4): but (1,4) is seg1, occupied, and reverse direction not allowed.\n\n- D to (1,2)\n\n- L to (0,3): wall, invalid\n\n- R to (2,3)\n\nNow, (2,3): is it free? Walls: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) not listed, so no wall. Snake positions: no (2,3), so free.\n\nAlso, (1,2) is obstacle? Internal obstacle at (1,2), so (1,2) is wall.\n\nTherefore, from (1,3):\n\n- U: invalid, occupied and reverse\n\n- D: to (1,2) wall, invalid\n\n- L: wall\n\n- R: to (2,3) possible\n\nOnly move is R to (2,3)\n\nSo turn 82: move R to (2,3)\n\nNow head at (2,3), direction R (since moved right)\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,3):\n\n- U to (2,4): but (2,4) is wall (internal obstacle)\n\n- D to (2,2)\n\n- L to (1,3): which is seg1 position, occupied, and reverse? Current direction R, moving L is reverse, not allowed.\n\n- R to (3,3)\n\nNow, (3,3): is it free? Not wall, and snake positions: tail is at (4,2), no (3,3) in positions, so free? After previous move, positions: head (2,3), seg1 (1,3), seg2 (1,4), etc., no (3,3), so yes free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2): possible.\n\nBut U to (2,4) wall, invalid.\n\nL invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nNow, (2,2): internal obstacle? Obstacles include (1,2), but not (2,2). (2,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) free.\n\nI need to think about the food.\n\nFood at (4,4) life span decreasing.\n\nCurrent turn 82.\n\nAfter turn 80, (4,4) life span was 6, after turn 80 it becomes 5, after turn 81 it becomes 4, now at turn 82, life span 4 for (4,4)? Let's track.\n\nAt turn 80 start, (4,4) life span 6.\n\nAfter turn 80, decreases to 5 for turn 81.\n\nAfter turn 81, decreases to 4 for turn 82.\n\nAfter turn 82, will be 3 for turn 83, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) was 9, now after two turns, 7 for turn 82? Turn 80:9, turn81:8, turn82:7.\n\nNow head at (2,3), I can go to (2,2) or (3,3).\n\n(2,2) is below, (3,3) is right.\n\nI need to head towards the food area.\n\nBut food at (4,4) and (4,5) are covered.\n\n(4,4) is currently occupied by seg12 in the current state.\n\nAfter move to (2,3) on turn 82.\n\nFirst, after turn 81, we have positions as above.\n\nThen move to (2,3):\n\nHead to (2,3)\n\nSeg1: old head (1,3)\n\nSeg2: old seg1 (1,4)\n\nSeg3: old seg2 (1,5)\n\nSeg4: old seg3 (2,5)\n\nSeg5: old seg4 (2,6)\n\nSeg6: old seg5 (3,6)\n\nSeg7: old seg6 (4,6)\n\nSeg8: old seg7 (5,6)\n\nSeg9: old seg8 (5,5)\n\nSeg10: old seg9 (4,5)\n\nSeg11: old seg10 (3,5)\n\nSeg12: old seg11 (3,4)\n\nSeg13: old seg12 (4,4)\n\nSeg14: old seg13 (4,3)  // tail at (4,3)?

Start turn 80:6, end turn 80:5 for turn 81, end turn 81:4 for turn 82, so at turn 82, life span 4.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) life span 7.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf I move R to (3,3):\n\nHead to (3,3), direction R.\n\nThen possible next moves from (3,3): U, D, L, R, but not L (reverse).\n\n(3,3) to (3,4) U, (3,2) D, (2,3) L reverse invalid, (4,3) R.\n\n(3,4): is it occupied? After move to (3,3), positions:\n\nHead (3,3)\n\nSeg1: (2,3)\n\nSeg2: (1,3)\n\nSeg3: (1,4)\n\n...\n\nSeg13: (4,4)  // still occupied\n\n(3,4) is position of old seg11, which is now new seg12 or something.\n\nAfter moving to (3,3):\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head (2,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (1,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (1,4)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (1,5)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (2,5)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (2,6)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (3,6)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (4,6)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (5,6)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (5,5)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (4,5)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (3,5)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (3,4)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (4,4)  // tail at (4,4)\n\n(3,4) is new seg13 position.\n\nSo if I move U to (3,4), it is occupied by seg13, collision.\n\nSimilarly, D to (3,2): let's see if free.\n\n(3,2): not wall, and after move, positions no (3,2), so free? Tail is at (4,4), not (3,2).\n\nIn new positions, (3,2) not listed, so free.\n\nR to (4,3): (4,3) was tail before? After move, (4,3) is not occupied, since tail moved to (4,4)? New tail is (4,4), so (4,3) is free? After move to (3,3), the old seg13 was (4,4)? Let's clarify.\n\nBefore move, positions: head (2,3), seg1 (1,3), seg2 (1,4), ..., seg13 (4,4), seg14 (4,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,3):\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head (2,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (1,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (1,4)\n\n...\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (3,4)  // old seg12 was (3,4)\n\nOld positions: seg12 was (3,4), seg13 was (4,4), seg14 was (4,3)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 position (3,4)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 position (4,4)  // tail\n\nSo (4,3) is no longer occupied; it was old seg14, but not part of snake now.\n\nCells: (3,2) is free, (3,4) is occupied by seg13, (4,3) is free.\n\nFrom (3,3):\n\n- U to (3,4): occupied by seg13, invalid\n\n- D to (3,2): free\n\n- L to (2,3): occupied by seg1, and reverse, invalid\n\n- R to (4,3): free\n\nSo possible moves: D or R.\n\nIf I move D to (3,2), or R to (4,3).\n\nBut I need to get to the food.\n\nFood at (4,4) is at tail position now, but it has food, so if I move head to (4,4), I can eat it, but tail is there, so if I move to tail, it's okay because tail moves, but there is food, so I eat and grow, but the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision because new tail grows.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,4) with food.\n\nIf I move head to (4,4), which is the tail cell, and it has food, so I eat it, then the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head is on tail, so collision, death.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat the food when it's under the tail if head moves directly to it.\n\nThe rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, if head is not adjacent, but directly on tail, it might be similar or worse.\n\nGenerally, moving head to tail cell is safe only if no food, because tail moves away.\n\nBut with food, if head moves to tail cell with food, I eat, grow, tail doesn't move, so head and tail same position, collision.\n\nSo I should avoid moving directly to tail if it has food.\n\nHere, at (4,4) there is food, and it's tail, so I cannot move there directly.\n\nI need to free it first.\n\nBack to turn 82.\n\nHead at (2,3), I can move to (2,2) or (3,3).\n\nIf I move to (3,3), then from there I can go to (3,2) or (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is closer to the food area.\n\nAlso, (4,4) life span: at turn 82, 4 left, so I have until turn 85 to eat it.\n\nTurn 82: life span 4, so present on turns 82,83,84,85, disappear after 85.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) life span 7.\n\nNow, let's aim to free (4,4).\n\nCurrently, (4,4) is occupied by the body.\n\nAs the snake moves, it will shift.\n\nFor example, if I continue moving, the segment at (4,4) will move to where the previous segment was.\n\nIn the current state after turn 81, (4,4) is seg12 or something.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nI could move towards the right to open space.\n\nSince the snake is long, I might need to uncoil or something.\n\nAnother idea: move down to (2,2) from (2,3).\n\n(2,2) is free, no wall, not occupied.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move to (2,1) or (3,2) or (1,2) but (1,2) is wall, etc.\n\nBut let's list the actions so far.\n\nTurn 80: D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 81: D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 82: I need to choose.\n\nIf I move R to (3,3) from (2,3), then from (3,3) I can move R to (4,3) or D to (3,2).\n\nSuppose on turn 82, I move R to (3,3)\n\nThen head at (3,3), direction R.\n\nTurn 83: from (3,3), I can move D to (3,2) or R to (4,3).\n\nSay I move R to (4,3)\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nNow, (4,3) was previously occupied? After move to (3,3), positions as above, (4,3) is free.\n\nMove to (4,3):\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nSeg1: (3,3)\n\nSeg2: (2,3)\n\netc.\n\nBut food at (4,4) is nearby.\n\n(4,4) is currently the tail position.\n\nAfter move to (4,3), the tail might move.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAfter turn 82 move to (3,3):\n\nPositions: head (3,3), seg1 (2,3), seg2 (1,3), seg3 (1,4), seg4 (1,5), seg5 (2,5), seg6 (2,6), seg7 (3,6), seg8 (4,6), seg9 (5,6), seg10 (5,5), seg11 (4,5), seg12 (3,5), seg13 (3,4), seg14 (4,4) tail\n\nNow turn 83: move R to (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is free, no problem.\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head (3,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (2,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (1,3)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (1,4)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (1,5)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (2,5)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (2,6)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (3,6)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (4,6)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (5,6)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (5,5)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (4,5)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (3,5)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (3,4)  // tail at (3,4)\n\nNow, (4,4) is free! Because it was tail, and tail moved to (3,4).\n\nAnd food is at (4,4), so now it's free and has food.\n\nHead is at (4,3), so adjacent to (4,4).\n\nI can move to (4,4) next turn to eat it.\n\nBut tail reward danger: head at (4,3), tail at (3,4), are they adjacent? (4,3) and (3,4) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (4,3) and (3,4) are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n\nTherefore, head is not adjacent to tail.\n\nSo I can move to (4,4) to eat the food.\n\nLife span of (4,4): at turn 83, life span should be 3? Turn 80:6, t81:5, t82:4, t83:3, so still available.\n\nOn turn 84, I can move to (4,4) to eat it.\n\nBut let's confirm the moves.\n\nFirst, on turn 83, I moved to (4,3), head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nThen turn 84: move to (4,4)\n\n(4,4) has food, so I eat it, snake grows, so the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the end.\n\nAfter eating, the head moves to (4,4), and the body follows, but since I ate, the tail stays, so the new position: head at (4,4), then the previous head (4,3) becomes segment 1, and so on, up to the tail which was (3,4) but since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so the tail is still at (3,4), and a new segment is added where the tail was, but since tail didn't move, it's confusing.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, the body segments follow, and since you ate, the tail doesn't retreat, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head position becomes segment 1, previous segment 1 becomes segment 2, ..., up to the previous tail, which remains as the new tail, but since it didn't move, it stays, and the new segment is added implicitly by not moving the tail.\n\nIn terms of positions, after moving to food, the head is at food, then all previous positions are kept, and the tail position is not removed, so length increases by one.\n\nFor example, before move to (4,4), positions: head (4,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (2,3), ..., seg14 (3,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4) and eating:\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nNew seg1: (4,3)  // previous head\n\nNew seg2: (3,3)  // previous seg1\n\n...\n\nNew seg14: (3,4)  // previous seg13?

New seg12: previous seg11 was (5,5)? Previous seg11: (5,5), new seg12: (5,5)\n\nBut (4,5) is not occupied now? After the moves, the snake has segments at (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), etc., but (4,5) is not in the positions, so it should be free.\n\nLet's list the new positions after eating at (4,4):\n\nHead: (4,4)\n\nSeg1: (4,3)\n\nSeg2: (3,3)\n\nSeg3: (2,3)\n\nSeg4: (1,3)\n\nSeg5: (1,4)\n\nSeg6: (1,5)\n\nSeg7: (2,5)\n\nSeg8: (2,6)\n\nSeg9: (3,6)\n\nSeg10: (4,6)\n\nSeg11: (5,6)\n\nSeg12: (5,5)\n\nSeg13: (4,5)  // (4,5) is here?

Before eating, previous seg12 was (4,5)\n\nIn previous positions before move: seg12 was (4,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (4,4), new seg1: (4,3), new seg2: (3,3), ..., new seg13: previous seg12 (4,5)\n\nSince I ate, new segments up to new seg15: previous seg14 (3,4)\n\nSo new seg13: previous seg12 (4,5)\n\nSo (4,5) is now occupied by segment 13.\n\nFood at (4,5) is still under the body.\n\nTo eat it, I need to free it later.\n\nNow back to the plan.\n\nFirst, I need to output actions starting from turn 80.\n\nSo far:\n\nTurn 80: D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 81: D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 82: from (1,3) I moved R to (2,3), but on turn 82, head is at (1,3) after turn 81 move.\n\nAfter turn 81: head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nThen I moved R to (2,3) on turn 82.\n\nThen turn 83: from (2,3) to (3,3) or something.\n\nEarlier I assumed from (2,3) I moved to (3,3), but I need to specify.\n\nOn turn 82, from (1,3), I moved R to (2,3)\n\nThen on turn 83, from (2,3), I need to move.\n\nFrom (2,3), after moving, head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4) wall, invalid; D to (2,2); L to (1,3) occupied and reverse invalid; R to (3,3)\n\nSo I can move to (2,2) or (3,3)\n\nIn my earlier plan, I moved to (3,3) to reach (4,3) and then (4,4)\n\nBut I could move to (2,2) first, but that might delay.\n\nTo save time for food, moving to (3,3) is better.\n\nSo turn 82: move R to (2,3)  // from (1,3)\n\nTurn 83: from (2,3), move R to (3,3)\n\nNow head at (3,3), direction R.\n\nTurn 84: from (3,3), I can move R to (4,3) or D to (3,2)\n\nI need to go to (4,3) to be adjacent to (4,4)\n\nSo move R to (4,3)\n\nHead at (4,3), direction R.\n\nNow, (4,4) is free and has food.\n\nTurn 85: move to (4,4) to eat it.\n\nBut life span: at turn 85, (4,4) should be available? Life span at turn 82:4, t83:3, t84:2, t85:1, so on turn 85, it is present, disappear after turn 85.\n\nSo on turn 85, I can eat it.\n\nIn turn 85, move to (4,4).\n\nBut on turn 85, head at (4,3), move to (4,4).\n\nYes.\n\nAfter eating, as before.\n\nNow, what about the other food at (4,5)? But it's still covered, and I have time.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5.\n\nSo from turn 80 to, say, turn 85.\n\nBut the actions are per turn.\n\nAlso, for turn 80, I must move down, as up is suicide.\n\nThen turn 81 down, turn 82 right to (2,3), turn 83 right to (3,3), turn 84 right to (4,3), turn 85 up to (4,4)? From (4,3) to (4,4) is up, since y increases up? Directions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\n(4,3) to (4,4) is U, since y increases.\n\nCurrent direction after moving to (4,3) is R, so moving U is not reverse, so allowed.\n\nThen on turn 85, move U to (4,4) to eat.\n\nNow, after that, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output the actions for turns starting from t1=80.\n\nAlso, I have to avoid risks.\n\nIn this path, when I move to (4,4) on turn 85, it should be safe, as (4,4) is free.\n\nAnd I eat the food.\n\nNow, for the other food, I can plan later, but since the question asks to think 5+ turns ahead, and I have up to turn 85, which is 5 turns from 80? Turn 80,81,82,83,84,85 is 6 actions, but actions from turn 80 to turn 85, that's 6 turns? Turn 80 action, turn 81, etc., up to turn 85.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTurn 80: move D\n\nTurn 81: move D\n\nTurn 82: move R (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 83: move R (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 84: move R (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 85: move U (to (4,4))\n\nNow, from turn 80 to 85, that's 6 actions.\n\nBut I can output more if needed.\n\nSince the food at (4,4) is eaten, and I have another food.\n\nBut for now, this seems a plan.\n\nIn turn 82, when I moved to (2,3), I could have moved down to (2,2), but that might not help.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,2), then I might get stuck or take longer.\n\nBut in this case, going right is better.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I didn't hit them.\n\nAlso, borders.\n\nSo the plan seems safe.\n\nThen I can output.\n\nBut the answer format should be boxed with actions.\n\nSo for turn 80: D\n\nTurn 81: D\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nTurn 83: R\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nBut turn 85 is eating the food.\n\nNow, I should include one more to show after eating.\n\nBut not necessary, I think.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, and I ate one food, now I can go for the other.\n\nBut for the answer, this might be fine.\n\nIn turn 84, when I move to (4,3), and (4,4) is free, but is there any risk?\n\nTail is at (3,4), head at (4,3), not adjacent, so no tail danger.\n\nThen move to (4,4) to eat.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,4), and I can move to other places.\n\nFor example, to eat (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by body segment.\n\nIn the positions after eating, (4,5) is seg13, so occupied.\n\nI need to free it.\n\nBut life span 9, after 5 turns, still about 4 left, so time.\n\nBut for the answer, I can stop at turn 85.\n\nSince the question says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and I have from 80 to 85, that's 6 turns planned.\n\nActions from 80 to 85 inclusive.\n\nTurn 80 action, 81,82,83,84,85: 6 actions.\n\nPerhaps I should output up to turn 85.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial moves.\n\nOn turn 80, I must move down, as up is trap.\n\nThen turn 81, from (1,4), only down to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 82, from (1,3), only right to (2,3)\n\nThen from (2,3), I have choice: to (2,2) or (3,3)\n\nI chose (3,3), which is fine.\n\nIf I go to (2,2), for example:\n\nTurn 82: move D to (2,2)\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3) occupied or reverse? Direction D, U reverse invalid.\n\nD to (2,1)\n\nL to (1,2) wall\n\nR to (3,2)\n\n(2,1) and (3,2) possible.\n\nBut (2,1) might be near obstacle, but (2,1) not wall.\n\nThen from there, it takes longer to reach the food, and (4,4) might expire.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), to (3,2) or (2,1), then to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc., but by turn 85, I might not reach (4,4) in time.\n\nWhereas going right directly is faster.\n\nSo my plan is better.\n\nThus, actions:\n\nTurn 80: D\n\nTurn 81: D\n\nTurn 82: R  (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 83: R  (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 84: R  (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 85: U  (to (4,4))\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nAlso, in turn 85, I move U to eat.\n\nBut after that, I need to think about the next food.\n\nBut not required for answer.\n\nTo be complete, I can add one more turn.\n\nFor example, after eating at (4,4), head at (4,4), direction U (since I moved up).\n\nThen possible moves: U to (4,5), but (4,5) has food but is occupied by seg13, so collision.\n\nD to (4,3) occupied by seg1\n\nL to (3,4) occupied by tail\n\nR to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) might be free.\n\nBut I don't need to specify.\n\nFor the answer, up to turn 85 is fine.\n\nSince turn 80 to 85.\n\nIn the state, turn t1=80, so actions from turn 80 to, say, 85.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo I can list multiple.\n\nNow, I think this is acceptable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing safety and efficient pathing to eat the positive food at (4,4) before it disappears after turn 85. The food at (3,2) is unreachable and disappears after turn 80, so it is ignored. The food at (4,5) has a longer lifespan (9 turns) and can be targeted later after eating (4,4).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Initial Position and Constraints**: \n  - Snake head at (1,5) moving left (L), but left is blocked by wall (x=0). Only possible moves are up (U) or down (D).\n  - Moving up to (1,6) leads to immediate trap on turn 81 (no valid moves, collision or wall). Thus, moving down to (1,4) is the only safe option for turn 80.\n- **Path to Food (4,4)**:\n  - (4,4) has lifespan 6 at turn 80, decreasing to 5 at turn 81, 4 at turn 82, 3 at turn 83, 2 at turn 84, and 1 at turn 85. It disappears after turn 85, so it must be eaten by turn 85.\n  - (4,4) is initially under the snake body but can be freed by turn 84 by moving the snake such that the tail moves away. Specifically, moving right from (1,3) to (2,3) and then to (3,3) and (4,3) positions the head adjacent to (4,4) by turn 84, allowing a safe move to eat it on turn 85.\n- **Avoiding Risks**:\n  - Wall and obstacle avoidance: Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) and borders are avoided in the path.\n  - Body collision: All moves are to free cells.\n  - Tail reward danger: When moving to eat (4,4) on turn 85, the head is not adjacent to the tail (tail is at (3,4) and head at (4,3) on turn 84, diagonal not adjacent), so no danger.\n  - No instant reverse: Direction changes respect movement constraints.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating (4,4), the snake grows, and the food at (4,5) can be targeted later (lifespan 9 at turn 80, 5 at turn 85). The path ensures the snake remains in open areas with escape routes.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 80-85):\n- **Turn 80 (current)**: Move down (D) to (1,4). This avoids the trap at (1,6) and starts the path downward.\n- **Turn 81**: Move down (D) to (1,3). Only safe move; up is reverse/occupied, left/right are walls or obstacles.\n- **Turn 82**: Move right (R) to (2,3). From (1,3), only right is safe; down to (1,2) is obstacle, up reverse/occupied.\n- **Turn 83**: Move right (R) to (3,3). From (2,3), moving right is efficient; down to (2,2) is possible but delays reaching (4,4).\n- **Turn 84**: Move right (R) to (4,3). Positions head adjacent to (4,4) for eating next turn.\n- **Turn 85**: Move up (U) to (4,4). Eats the food (score +1, length increases), and the cell is freed after tail movement.\n\nThis plan eats (4,4) just before expiration and sets up for potential eating of (4,5) in future turns. All moves are safe, with no collision risks.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 80: D (down)  \nTurn 81: D (down)  \nTurn 82: R (right)  \nTurn 83: R (right)  \nTurn 84: R (right)  \nTurn 85: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 81, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, and I must think at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). I need to avoid these when moving.\n\nSnake positions are given as a list: head is at (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2). So the head is at (1,4), and the tail is at (3,2). The snake has 15 segments.\n\nHead direction is down, which is D. That means from (1,4), moving down would go to (1,3), but let's confirm: down decreases y, so from (1,4) down to (1,3). But in the positions, the head is at (1,4) and next is (1,5), which is up? I need to be careful.\n\nSnake positions: [(1,4), (1,5), ...] so head at (1,4), and the second segment is (1,5). Since y increases up? Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases as we go up. But here, the head is at (1,4), moving to (1,5), which is an increase in y, so that should be up, but head direction is given as D, which is down? That seems inconsistent.\n\nHead direction is D, down. But from the positions, if head is at (1,4) and it just moved to that position, with direction D, meaning it came from above? Let's think about the movement.\n\nThe positions are listed from head to tail. So at turn 81, head is at (1,4). The previous head was probably at (1,3) or something, but direction is given as current head direction, which is D, down. So the snake is facing down, meaning if it moves down, it goes to (1,3).\n\nBut in the positions, after head (1,4), next is (1,5), which is directly above (since y=5 > y=4, so north). That means the body is going up from the head? That doesn't make sense for movement.\n\nPerhaps I misinterpreted the coordinate system. Let me define the grid: typically, x from left to right, y from bottom to top, so (0,0) bottom-left, (7,7) top-right. Then moving up increases y, down decreases y, left decreases x, right increases x.\n\nHead at (1,4), direction down, so it can move down to (1,3).\n\nThe snake positions: head (1,4), then (1,5) — (1,5) has higher y, so it's above (1,4). That means the snake body is going upwards from the head? But if head is at (1,4) and second segment is at (1,5), that means the head just moved down to (1,4) from (1,5)? But direction is down, so if it moved down to (1,4), it came from above, which is (1,5), so previous head was at (1,5), and it moved down to (1,4). That makes sense.\n\nAt turn 80, head was at (1,5), and it moved down to (1,4) for turn 81. So now at turn 81, head is at (1,4), facing down, so it can move down to (1,3), but not up because that would be reverse, which is not allowed instantly.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D (down), so cannot move up (U) next turn.\n\nPossible moves: from (1,4), with direction D, can move D (down to (1,3)), L (left to (0,4)), R (right to (2,4)). Cannot move U (up to (1,5)) because that's reverse.\n\nNow, food positions: there are two food items given:\n\n- (4,4,6,1) — this is (x,y, life_span, value). Format is ( (x,y), value, life_span), but here it's written as (4,4,6,1), so I think (x,y) = (4,4), value = 6? No, let's read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4,4,6,1) - (4,5,8,1)\"\n\nBut in the description, it should be ( (x,y), value, life_span ). Here it's listed as (x,y, life_span, value)? That might be a mistake.\n\nLook: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in input, it's \" - (4,4,6,1)\" which might be (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)?\n\nI think there's inconsistency. In the core rules, it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so it should be (coordinate, value, life_span).\n\nBut in the state, it's written as \"(4,4,6,1)\" which has four numbers, so probably (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)?\n\nThe text says: \" - (4,4,6,1)\" and \" - (4,5,8,1)\" and it says \"Life Span and Value\" but in the list, it might be value then life_span or vice versa.\n\nLet's see the example: for (4,4,6,1), if it's (x,y, value, life_span), then value=6, life_span=1? But life_span=1 means it disappears after this turn? But it says \"life_span\" and \"value\" separately.\n\nPerhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value). I think I need to clarify.\n\nIn the state input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4,4,6,1) - (4,5,8,1)\"\n\nBut in the core rules, it's specified as \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \", so the value and life_span are separate.\n\nHere, it's written as a tuple of four numbers, so likely (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value).\n\nThe text says \"Life Span and Value\" but lists with four numbers. I think it's a formatting issue.\n\nLooking at the values: for (4,4,6,1), if value=6 and life_span=1, that would be a high-value food, but life_span=1 means it might disappear soon.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5,8,1) value=8, life_span=1.\n\nBut in the core rules, food has value +1 or -1 for negative, but here values are 6 and 8, which are not +1 or -1. That doesn't match.\n\nI think I misread the core rules.\n\nCore rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1\"\n\n\"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1 | Length of snake unchanged\"\n\nBut here, the values are given as 6 and 8, which are not +1 or -1. That can't be right.\n\nPerhaps the value is the reward, but for positive food, it should be +1, but here it's 6 and 8? That seems odd.\n\nAnother possibility: the \"value\" in the food position might be the life_span or something else? No.\n\nLet's read the state input carefully: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4,4,6,1) - (4,5,8,1)\"\n\nAnd in the core rules, it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nSo for each food, it's (coordinate, value, life_span).\n\nBut in the state, it's written as (4,4,6,1), which has four elements, so (x,y, value, life_span) with value=6, life_span=1 for the first one.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5,8,1) value=8, life_span=1.\n\nBut the core rules say for positive food, value is +1, but here it's 6 and 8, so it must be that the value is the score reward, and it can be different, or perhaps it's a mistake.\n\nCore rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\" but that might be for standard, but here it's specified with values, so I think in this context, the value can be different, like a multiplier or something.\n\nBut it says \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive, so it should be +1. But here it's 6 and 8, which are positive, so perhaps it's +6 and +8, but the length increases by 1 for positive food.\n\nLet's check the rule: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1\" so reward value is +1, and length increases by 1.\n\nBut here, value is given as 6 and 8, so maybe the value is the life_span, but life_span is separate.\n\nI think there's a confusion in the input format.\n\nPerhaps the \"6\" and \"8\" are the life_span, and \"1\" is the value? But value should be +1 or -1, but here it's 1, which could be +1.\n\nLet's see: for (4,4,6,1), if it's (x,y, life_span, value), then life_span=6, value=1, which is +1.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5,8,1) life_span=8, value=1, +1.\n\nAnd value=1 means positive food, I assume.\n\nThe core rules say value can be +1 or -1 for negative food.\n\nHere both have value=1, so both are positive food.\n\nLife_span: for (4,4) life_span=6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5) life_span=8.\n\nCurrent turn is 81.\n\nSo food at (4,4) will disappear after turn 81 + 6 - 1? Let's clarify life_span.\n\n\"Life-span - Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) - Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo if life_span = N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it is present for N turns.\n\nCountdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, if food appears, life_span N, at turn t, countdown N, turn t+1 countdown N-1, ..., turn t+N-1 countdown 1, then after that, it disappears, so not present on turn t+N.\n\nFor example, if food spawned at turn S with life_span N, it is present from turn S to turn S + N - 1.\n\nHere, current turn is 81, food at (4,4) with life_span 6, so it is present from some spawn time to turn spawn + 5, since life_span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, so if spawned at T, present T to T+5, gone at T+6.\n\nBut we don't know spawn time, only current life_span.\n\nCurrent life_span is given as 6 at turn 81, so countdown is 6, meaning it will decrease to 5 on turn 82, 4 on 83, ..., 1 on turn 86, and disappear after turn 86, so not present on turn 87.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5) life_span 8, countdown 8 at turn 81, so present until turn 81+7=88, disappear after turn 88.\n\nNow, both foods are positive, value +1 each, and eating them increases length by 1.\n\nNow, I need to find where the snake can move.\n\nFirst, head at (1,4), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: D (down to (1,3)), L (left to (0,4)), R (right to (2,4)). Cannot U (up to (1,5)) because reverse.\n\nNow, check if these cells are occupied or walls.\n\nFirst, walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\n(2,4) is an internal obstacle? (2,4) is in the list: internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n\nSo (2,4) is a wall, so cannot move there.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- D: to (1,3)\n\n- L: to (0,4) — but x=0 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n\n- R: to (2,4) — but (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,3)? But that can't be right, because if only one move, I have to do it, but let's confirm.\n\nHead at (1,4), move down to (1,3).\n\nIs (1,3) within bounds? y=3, grid from y=0 to 7, so y=3 is valid, not border if not x=0 or7, but border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,3) has x=1 not 0 or7, y=3 not 0 or7, so not border wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2) is an obstacle, but (1,3) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut is (1,3) occupied by snake body? Let's see snake positions: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nSo positions: (1,4) head, then (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)\n\nSo (1,3) is not in this list, so not occupied by body.\n\n(4,3) is there, but that's different.\n\n(1,3) is free.\n\nBut moving to (1,3) might be safe for now.\n\nBut is there a risk? Also, food is at (4,4) and (4,5), but I'm at (1,4), far away.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nCurrent only possible move is down to (1,3), since left and right are blocked by walls, and up is reverse not allowed.\n\nBut let's list all adjacent cells:\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Up: (1,5) - but that is the second segment of snake, occupied, and also reverse direction, so not allowed.\n\n- Down: (1,3) - not wall, not in snake positions? Snake positions: (1,5) is there, but (1,3) not listed, so free.\n\n- Left: (0,4) - x=0, border wall, cannot.\n\n- Right: (2,4) - but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is down to (1,3).\n\nBut is (1,3) a valid move? It should be, but let's confirm if it causes collision.\n\nAfter moving to (1,3), the new head position is (1,3), and the tail will move, so the body segments shift.\n\nSince the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated, unless it grows.\n\nNot eating food, so no growth, length same, so tail moves away from (3,2), so (1,3) should be free now.\n\nBut (1,3) is not occupied before move, so after move, head to (1,3), body: previous head (1,4) becomes new second segment, and so on, tail (3,2) is removed.\n\nSo no collision at (1,3).\n\nBut the problem is that from (1,4), only down is possible, so I must move down to (1,3).\n\nBut then on next turn, head at (1,3), direction down, so can move down to (1,2), left to (0,3), or right to (2,3), but not up.\n\nNow, (0,3) is x=0, wall, cannot.\n\n(2,3) : is it wall? Internal obstacles include (2,4), (1,2), etc., but (2,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\n(1,2) is obstacle, so from (1,3), down to (1,2) is obstacle, cannot move there.\n\nPossible moves from (1,3):\n\n- Down: (1,2) - but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\n- Left: (0,3) - x=0, wall, cannot.\n\n- Right: (2,3) - not wall, not snake? Snake positions after move: head at (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), etc. (1,4) is now body, (2,3) not in positions, so free.\n\n- Up: (1,4) - but that is now body, occupied, and reverse direction, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is right to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), and so on.\n\nBut I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFirst, for turn 81, only move is down to (1,3).\n\nBut the answer should include multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=81.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 81, 82, 83, etc., up to say 85 or more.\n\nBut since the state might change, I need to simulate or plan.\n\nBut food life-span: food at (4,4) life-span 6, so disappears after 6 turns, meaning present until turn 86 (since countdown from 6 at turn 81: turn 81:6, 82:5, 83:4, 84:3, 85:2, 86:1, gone at 87? Countdown decreases to 0, disappears when countdown 0 after the turn or what?\n\nLife-span N: disappears after N turns, so if at turn t countdown c, it disappears at turn t + c.\n\nFor example, at turn 81, countdown=6, so after 6 turns, at turn 87, it is gone, present at turn 81 to 86.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) life-span 8, countdown=8 at turn 81, present until turn 88.\n\nNow, snake is at (1,4), food at (4,4) and (4,5), which are both on the grid.\n\n(4,4) has food with value +1, but (4,4) is currently occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (4,4) is in the list, it's the 12th segment or something.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (1,4), 1: (1,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (4,6), 6: (5,6), 7: (5,5), 8: (4,5), 9: (3,5), 10: (3,4), 11: (4,4), 12: (4,3), 13: (4,2), 14: (3,2) tail.\n\nSo (4,4) is position 11, body segment.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is position 8, body segment.\n\nFood at (4,4) and (4,5), but both are occupied by snake body.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nSo currently, cannot eat them because body is there.\n\nFor (4,4) to be eaten, the snake must move so that the body leaves (4,4), then later head moves there.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5).\n\nBut life-span is short for (4,4), only until turn 86.\n\nNow, back to movement: at turn 81, only possible move is down to (1,3).\n\nSo for turn 81, action must be D.\n\nThen turn 82, head at (1,3), direction down (since moved down).\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- Down: (1,2) - but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\n- Left: (0,3) - x=0, wall, cannot.\n\n- Right: (2,3) - free, as per earlier.\n\n- Up: (1,4) - now body segment, and reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only right to (2,3).\n\nAction: R.\n\nThen turn 83, head at (2,3), direction right (since moved right from (1,3) to (2,3)).\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- Right: (3,3) - not wall, not snake? Snake positions after previous moves.\n\nLet's simulate the snake positions.\n\nAt turn 81: start positions: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)\n\nAfter move D to (1,3): new head (1,3), then body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and tail (3,2) removed? No, since no food eaten, length same, so the last segment, tail, is removed.\n\nWhen snake moves, head to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nSpecifically: new positions after move down to (1,3):\n\n- Head: (1,3)\n\n- Segment 1: previous head (1,4)\n\n- Segment 2: previous seg1 (1,5)\n\n- Segment 3: previous seg2 (2,5)\n\n- Segment 4: (2,6)\n\n- Segment 5: (3,6)\n\n- Segment 6: (4,6)\n\n- Segment 7: (5,6)\n\n- Segment 8: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 9: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 10: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 11: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 12: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 13: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 14: (4,2)  // since (4,2) was second last, now last but one\n\nPrevious positions: indices 0 to 14: 0:(1,4), 1:(1,5), 2:(2,5), 3:(2,6), 4:(3,6), 5:(4,6), 6:(5,6), 7:(5,5), 8:(4,5), 9:(3,5), 10:(3,4), 11:(4,4), 12:(4,3), 13:(4,2), 14:(3,2)\n\nAfter move to (1,3), new head (1,3), then body[0] = old head (1,4), body[1] = old body[1] (1,5), body[2] = old body[2] (2,5), ..., up to body[13] = old body[13] (4,2), and old tail (3,2) is removed, so new positions: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)] with 15 segments, tail at (4,2).\n\nOld segment 14 (3,2) is gone, so new tail is (4,2).\n\nNow turn 82, move right to (2,3): from head (1,3) to (2,3).\n\nNew head (2,3), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), and tail (4,2) removed? No, no food, so tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), tail (4,2) gone, so new tail is (4,3)? Let's list:\n\nAfter move to (2,3):\n\n- Head: (2,3)\n\n- Body[0]: previous head (1,3)\n\n- Body[1]: previous body[0] (1,4)\n\n- Body[2]: previous body[1] (1,5)\n\n- Body[3]: previous body[2] (2,5)\n\n- Body[4]: previous body[3] (2,6)\n\n- Body[5]: (3,6)\n\n- Body[6]: (4,6)\n\n- Body[7]: (5,6)\n\n- Body[8]: (5,5)\n\n- Body[9]: (4,5)\n\n- Body[10]: (3,5)\n\n- Body[11]: (3,4)\n\n- Body[12]: (4,4)\n\n- Body[13]: (4,3)  // previous body[13] was (4,3)? Previous after turn 81: positions were [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]\n\nSo after move to (2,3), new head (2,3), body[0] = old head (1,3), body[1] = old body[0] (1,4), body[2] = old body[1] (1,5), body[3] = old body[2] (2,5), body[4] = old body[3] (2,6), body[5] = old body[4] (3,6), body[6] = old body[5] (4,6), body[7] = old body[6] (5,6), body[8] = old body[7] (5,5), body[9] = old body[8] (4,5), body[10] = old body[9] (3,5), body[11] = old body[10] (3,4), body[12] = old body[11] (4,4), body[13] = old body[12] (4,3), and old body[13] (4,2) is removed, so new positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] with tail at (4,3).\n\nNow turn 83, head at (2,3), direction R (right, since moved right).\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- Right: (3,3) - not wall, not in snake positions? Snake has (3,4), (3,5), etc., but (3,3) not listed, so free.\n\n- Up: (2,4) - but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\n- Down: (2,2) - not wall? Internal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), etc., (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\n- Left: (1,3) - now body segment, and reverse, not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so cannot move left (opposite).\n\nPossible: right to (3,3), down to (2,2), up to (2,4) but wall, so not possible.\n\nUp to (2,4) is wall, so only right or down.\n\n(2,4) is wall, so cannot move up.\n\nSo moves: R to (3,3) or D to (2,2).\n\nI have a choice now.\n\nI need to think about getting to the food.\n\nFood at (4,4) and (4,5), but both are currently occupied by body.\n\n(4,4) is body segment, at position body[12] in current, but after moves, it might move.\n\nAlso, (4,5) is food, currently occupied.\n\nTo eat (4,4), the snake must move so that the body leaves (4,4), then head moves there.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5).\n\nCurrently, after turn 82 positions, (4,4) is body[12], (4,3) is tail? Positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nSo (4,4) is the second last, (4,3) is tail.\n\nFood at (4,4) and (4,5), but (4,5) is position body[10]? body[10] is (4,5)? List: indices from 0: (2,3) head, 1: (1,3), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (2,6), 6: (3,6), 7: (4,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (5,5), 10: (4,5), 11: (3,5), 12: (3,4), 13: (4,4), 14: (4,3) tail.\n\nSo (4,5) is body[10], occupied.\n\n(4,4) is body[13], occupied.\n\nSo food under body.\n\nNow, for (4,4) to be eatable, the body must move away from it.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5).\n\nSince the snake is moving, the body segments shift, so eventually, if the snake moves, those cells might be vacated.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves without eating, the tail moves, so cells are vacated.\n\nBut here, (4,4) is not tail yet, tail is (4,3).\n\nLet's see the tail movement.\n\nThe food at (4,4) has short life, only until turn 86.\n\nCurrent turn 83, so few turns left.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) has longer life.\n\nBut first, at turn 83, from (2,3), I can move right to (3,3) or down to (2,2).\n\nI need to go towards the food area.\n\nFood is at (4,4) and (4,5), so around (4,4).\n\nFrom (2,3), moving right to (3,3) is closer to x=4.\n\nMoving down to (2,2) is away.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving right to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 83 action R to (3,3).\n\nNew head (3,3), direction R.\n\nThen from (3,3), possible moves: right to (4,3), up to (3,4), down to (3,2), left to (2,3) but reverse not allowed.\n\n(4,3): is it free? After previous positions, (4,3) was tail, but after move to (3,3), let's see.\n\nAfter turn 82 positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)]\n\nMove to (3,3): new head (3,3), body[0] = old head (2,3), body[1] = (1,3), body[2] = (1,4), body[3] = (1,5), body[4] = (2,5), body[5] = (2,6), body[6] = (3,6), body[7] = (4,6), body[8] = (5,6), body[9] = (5,5), body[10] = (4,5), body[11] = (3,5), body[12] = (3,4), body[13] = (4,4), and old tail (4,3) removed, so new positions: [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)] tail at (4,4).\n\nNow (4,4) is tail, and there is food at (4,4), but the head is at (3,3), not adjacent to (4,4).\n\nFrom (3,3), moves:\n\n- Right to (4,3) - but (4,3) was removed, so free? (4,3) is not in positions, so free.\n\n- Up to (3,4) - (3,4) is body[12] in new positions, which is occupied.\n\n- Down to (3,2) - not wall, not snake, free.\n\n- Left to (2,3) - body[1], occupied, and reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: right to (4,3) or down to (3,2).\n\nIf I move right to (4,3), that is adjacent to (4,4), which has food and is tail.\n\nBut to eat the food at (4,4), I need to move to (4,4) when it is free.\n\nCurrently, (4,4) is tail, and as the snake moves, if no food eaten, tail moves, so (4,4) will be vacated when the snake moves next time.\n\nBut if I move to (4,3), then from there I can move to (4,4) if it is free.\n\nBut (4,4) has food, but it is currently occupied by tail.\n\nAt turn 84, after moving to (4,3) or wherever.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nAt turn 83, if I move to (3,3), then at turn 84, from (3,3), I can move to (4,3) or (3,2).\n\nSuppose I move to (4,3) at turn 84.\n\nThen new head (4,3), direction right (from (3,3) to (4,3)).\n\nNow, previous positions: head (3,3), body as above.\n\nAfter move to (4,3): new head (4,3), body[0] = old head (3,3), body[1] = (2,3), body[2] = (1,3), body[3] = (1,4), body[4] = (1,5), body[5] = (2,5), body[6] = (2,6), body[7] = (3,6), body[8] = (4,6), body[9] = (5,6), body[10] = (5,5), body[11] = (4,5), body[12] = (3,5), body[13] = (3,4), and old tail (4,4) removed, so (4,4) is now free.\n\nNew positions: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] tail at (3,4).\n\nNow (4,4) is free, and has food, so I can move to (4,4) from (4,3) or from elsewhere.\n\nFrom (4,3), at turn 84, I can move up to (4,4), since (4,4) is now free and has food.\n\n(4,4) has food, and is free.\n\nSo from (4,3), I can move up to (4,4) to eat the food.\n\nThen, eating food at (4,4), value +1, length increases, so tail does not move, new segment added.\n\nBut there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, when I eat the food at (4,4), is the head adjacent to tail?\n\nCurrent positions before eating: head at (4,3), tail at (3,4).\n\n(4,3) and (3,4) are adjacent? (4,3) to (3,4): delta x=1, delta y=1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means same row or column, differing by 1 in one coordinate.\n\nSo (4,3) and (3,4) are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n\nAdjacent cells would be (4,3) to (4,4), (4,2), (3,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nTail at (3,4), head at (4,3), not adjacent.\n\nSo eating at (4,4) should be safe.\n\nFrom (4,3), move up to (4,4).\n\nThen new head (4,4), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so body includes the previous tail position, and new segment added at where tail was, but since we eat, the length increases, so positions: new head at (4,4), body[0] = previous head (4,3), body[1] = previous body[0] (3,3), etc., and tail remains, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; we are at turn 83 decision.\n\nBack to turn 83.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move down to (2,2) instead.\n\nBut let's see which is better.\n\nFirst, if I move right to (3,3) at turn 83, then at turn 84, I can move to (4,3), then at turn 85 to (4,4) to eat.\n\nBut food at (4,4) life-span: at turn 81 countdown 6, so turn 82:5, 83:4, 84:3, 85:2, 86:1, gone at 87.\n\nAt turn 85, if I eat, it should be fine.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down from (2,3), it might take longer.\n\nBut let's confirm the path.\n\nAt turn 81: move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 82: move R to (2,3)\n\nTurn 83: move R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 84: from (3,3), move to (4,3) or down to (3,2).\n\nIf I move to (4,3), then at turn 85, from (4,3), I can move up to (4,4) to eat.\n\n(4,4) should be free at that time.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 84 after moving to (4,3), (4,4) is free.\n\nThen turn 85: move U to (4,4) to eat.\n\nNow, after eating, snake grows, positions change.\n\nBut also, there is food at (4,5), which is still occupied or not.\n\nIn positions after turn 84 before eating: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] with (4,5) occupied.\n\nAfter eating at (4,4), new head at (4,4), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), and since food eaten, tail stays, so (3,4) is still there, and new segment, so positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), ..., up to (3,4), and since tail was (3,4), it stays, so the new tail is (3,4)? Let's index.\n\nPrevious positions: head (4,3), body[0] to body[13], tail body[14] (3,4)\n\nAfter eating at (4,4): new head (4,4), new body[0] = previous head (4,3), new body[1] = previous body[0] (3,3), ..., new body[14] = previous body[13] (3,5)? Previous body indices: from above, after turn 84: positions: [ (4,3) head, (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) tail ]\n\nSo body segments: after head, (3,3) to (3,4)\n\nAfter move to (4,4) and eat: new head (4,4), then the body is [ (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ] so same as before but head moved to (4,4), and the tail (3,4) remains, so length 16 now.\n\n(4,5) is still occupied, body position.\n\nNow, food at (4,5) is there, life-span 8 at turn 81, so turn 84: countdown 8 - (84-81) = turn 81:8, 82:7, 83:6, 84:5, etc.\n\nTo eat (4,5), need to free it and head move there.\n\nCurrently occupied.\n\nBut we can plan to eat it later.\n\nFirst, back to turn 83.\n\nIf at turn 83 I move down to (2,2) instead.\n\nFrom (2,3) down to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is not wall, free.\n\nThen new head (2,2), direction down.\n\nThen from (2,2), possible moves: down to (2,1), left to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, right to (3,2), up to (2,3) reverse not allowed.\n\n(2,1): not wall, free.\n\n(3,2): not wall, free.\n\nBut (1,2) wall.\n\nSo moves: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nBut this is away from food, and (4,4) food might disappear before I can reach.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) to (3,2) to (3,3) etc., but it takes more turns.\n\nTurn 83 to (2,2), turn 84 to say (3,2), turn 85 to (3,3), turn 86 to (4,3), turn 87 to (4,4), but at turn 87, food (4,4) is gone, since life-span 6, gone after turn 86.\n\nSo I might miss it.\n\nWhereas if I go via (3,3), I can eat at turn 85.\n\nSo better to go for the food.\n\nMoreover, (4,5) has longer life, so can eat later.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: at (4,4), when I eat, it should be fine, but let's confirm the tail danger not present.\n\nAlso, after eating, I need to avoid collisions.\n\nBut for now, plan to eat (4,4).\n\nSo at turn 83, from (2,3), move R to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 84, from (3,3), I can move to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 85, to (4,4) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 84, from (3,3), I could move down to (3,2), but that delays and might not get to food in time.\n\nSo better move to (4,3) at turn 84.\n\nNow, what about the reverse move constraint.\n\nAt turn 84, from (3,3), direction R (from turn 83 move), so I can move right to (4,3) or down to (3,2), not up or left.\n\nMoving right to (4,3) is fine.\n\nThen at turn 85, from (4,3), direction right (since moved right to (4,3)), so from (4,3), possible moves: right to (5,3), up to (4,4), down to (4,2), left to (3,3) reverse not allowed.\n\n(5,3): not wall? Walls: x=7 border, x=5 not border unless x=0 or7. Internal obstacles: (5,1), (6,4), etc., (5,3) not listed, so free.\n\n(4,4): should be free and has food.\n\n(4,2): is it wall? Internal obstacles include (4,2)? Positions had (4,2) earlier, but is it obstacle? Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)] so (4,2) not obstacle, free.\n\nBut (4,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn current positions, after turn 84 to (4,3), positions: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\n(4,2) not there, free.\n\nBut I want to move up to (4,4) to eat.\n\nSo at turn 85, move U to (4,4).\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=81.\n\nI need actions for turn 81,82,83,84,85 at least.\n\nTurn 81: D (as only choice)\n\nTurn 82: R (only choice from (1,3))\n\nTurn 83: R to (3,3) (choice, but we choose to go for food)\n\nTurn 84: R to (4,3) (from (3,3))\n\nTurn 85: U to (4,4) to eat.\n\nThen after that, I can think further.\n\nBut the food at (4,5) is still there, life-span until turn 88.\n\nAfter eating at (4,4), head at (4,4), direction U (since moved up from (4,3)).\n\nThen from (4,4), possible moves: up to (4,5), right to (5,4), down to (4,3) but reverse not allowed (since came from down? Direction is U, moved up, so cannot move down.\n\nCame from (4,3) to (4,4) moving up, so direction U.\n\nCannot move down.\n\nLeft to (3,4) or right to (5,4).\n\n(3,4): in positions, after eating, (3,4) is body segment, occupied.\n\n(5,4): not wall, free? Internal obstacles (5,1), (6,4), etc., (5,4) not listed.\n\n(4,5): has food, but is it occupied? After eating, positions: head (4,4), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\n(4,5) is body[13], occupied, so cannot eat yet.\n\nTo eat (4,5), need to free it.\n\nSince snake will move, if I don't eat, it might free.\n\nFor example, if I move from (4,4) to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied, so I cannot move there, collision.\n\nSimilarly, move to (5,4) or left, but left to (3,4) occupied.\n\nFrom (4,4), moves:\n\n- Up to (4,5) - occupied by body, cannot.\n\n- Right to (5,4) - free, as per above.\n\n- Down: cannot, reverse.\n\n- Left to (3,4) - occupied.\n\nSo only possible move is right to (5,4).\n\nThen after that, (4,5) might be freed later.\n\nBut let's not plan too far yet.\n\nFirst, for the immediate actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 85, I eat at (4,4), but I need to output actions up to that point.\n\nBut the answer should start from turn 81.\n\nAlso, for turn 83, I have a choice, but going to (3,3) is better.\n\nWhat if at turn 83 I move down? Then I might not reach food in time.\n\nFor example, turn 83 move D to (2,2), then turn 84 from (2,2) can move R to (3,2) or D to (2,1).\n\nSay move R to (3,2), then turn 85 to (3,3), turn 86 to (3,4) or (4,3), but (4,4) gone at turn 87, so at turn 86 if I go to (4,4), but life-span: at turn 86 countdown 1, present, can eat if free.\n\nBut from (3,3) at turn 86, if I move to (4,3), then to (4,4) at turn 87, but turn 87 not present, so only if at turn 86 I am at (4,3) and move to (4,4) at turn 86.\n\nBut from above, if I took the down path: turn 83: (2,2), turn 84: (3,2), turn 85: from (3,2) to (3,3) or (4,2) etc., to (3,3) at turn 85, then turn 86 to (4,3), then can move to (4,4) at turn 86 if free.\n\nBut at turn 86, (4,4) countdown 1, still present, can eat.\n\nBut in the other path, I eat at turn 85, which is earlier, but same score, but I might have risk or something.\n\nIn the first path, I eat at turn 85, and by turn 86 I can be elsewhere.\n\nBut since no negative food, eating earlier might be better, but here only one food, so same.\n\nBut with the first path, I have more time to go for the other food.\n\nSo still better to go directly.\n\nMoreover, in the down path, moving to (2,2), (3,2) might have risks, but seems free.\n\nBut let's stick with the first plan.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nAlso, after turn 85, I can continue.\n\nBut the format is to output for turns starting from t1.\n\nNow, another thing: at turn 84, when moving from (3,3) to (4,3), is there any issue?\n\n(4,3) should be free.\n\nIn positions at turn 83: after move to (3,3), positions: [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]\n\n(4,3) not there.\n\nThen move to (4,3), so (4,3) free.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThen turn 85 to (4,4).\n\nNow, for the output, I need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 86 or so.\n\nTurn 81: action D\n\nTurn 82: action R\n\nTurn 83: action R\n\nTurn 84: action R (to (4,3))\n\nAt turn 84, from (3,3), I move R to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 85: action U to (4,4) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 86, from (4,4), after eating, direction U.\n\nThen only move is R to (5,4), as above.\n\nTurn 86: move R to (5,4)\n\nThen from there, I can go to eat (4,5) later.\n\nBut (4,5) needs to be freed.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), positions: head was at (4,4), moved to (5,4), no food, so tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions after eating: head (4,4), body: (4,3), (3,3), ..., (3,4)\n\nAfter move R to (5,4): new head (5,4), body[0] = (4,4), body[1] = (4,3), etc., and tail (3,4) removed, so (4,5) might be freed if it was tail, but (4,5) is not tail yet.\n\nIn positions: after turn 85 eating, positions: head (4,4), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\n(4,5) is body[13], (3,4) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,4): new head (5,4), body[0] = old head (4,4), body[1] = old body[0] (4,3), body[2] = (3,3), ..., up to body[14] = old body[13] (4,5)? Old body has 15 segments after eating? After eating at turn 85, positions have 16 segments: head and 15 body, but indices: head (4,4), then 15 body segments: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\nSo body from index 0 to 14: (4,3) to (3,4)\n\nAfter move to (5,4), no food eaten, so tail moves: new head (5,4), body[0] = (4,4), body[1] = (4,3), body[2] = (3,3), body[3] = (2,3), body[4] = (1,3), body[5] = (1,4), body[6] = (1,5), body[7] = (2,5), body[8] = (2,6), body[9] = (3,6), body[10] = (4,6), body[11] = (5,6), body[12] = (5,5), body[13] = (4,5), body[14] = (3,5), and old tail (3,4) removed, so (4,5) is now body[13], still occupied, but (3,5) is body[14], tail.\n\n(4,5) is not freed yet.\n\nTo free (4,5), the snake needs to move more.\n\nBut food at (4,5) has life until turn 88, so time.\n\nBut I need to output actions now.\n\nFor the answer, since the question is to output for the current turns, and I have a plan.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 81: D\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nTurn 83: R\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nThen I can add more if needed, but 5 turns from 81 to 85.\n\nt1=81, so turns 81,82,83,84,85.\n\nThat's five turns.\n\nI could include turn 86.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIn turn 84, when I move to (4,3), and turn 85 to (4,4), but is (4,4) free at that time?\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 84, after moving to (4,3), (4,4) is freed, as we remove the tail or something.\n\nIn turn 83 positions after move to (3,3): [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]\n\n(4,4) is tail.\n\nThen turn 84 move to (4,3): new head (4,3), body[0] = (3,3), body[1] = (2,3), ..., body[13] = (3,4), and old tail (4,4) removed, so (4,4) free.\n\nThen turn 85 move to (4,4) to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, after that, for long-term, I should avoid the tail danger when eating (4,5), but it might be ok.\n\nSince I need to output, I think the actions are:\n\nTurn 81: D\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nTurn 83: R\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nFor turn 86, from (4,4) after eating, move R to (5,4), but I don't have to include.\n\nThe answer format can have multiple lines.\n\nBut I think for now, this is fine.\n\nIn the beginning, at turn 81, only D possible, so must do that.\n\nSimilarly turn 82 only R.\n\nAt turn 83, I chose R to go towards food.\n\nCould I have gone down? But that might be worse.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 81):**\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8 (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n- **Walls**: Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

To eat, the snake must vacate the cell and later move the head onto it.\n\n**Movement Constraints:**\n- Current head direction is D (down), so cannot move up (U) on turn 81 (no instant reverse).\n- From head position (1,4):\n  - U (up) to (1,5): Occupied by body (segment at (1,5)) and reverse direction, invalid.\n  - D (down) to (1,3): Valid (not wall, not occupied).\n  - L (left) to (0,4): Border wall (x=0), invalid.\n  - R (right) to (2,4): Internal obstacle (wall at (2,4)), invalid.\n- **Only possible move on turn 81 is D (down) to (1,3).**\n\n**Key Risks and Opportunities:**\n- **Food at (4,4)**: Short life_span (disappears after turn 86). Must be eaten by turn 86. Currently under body, so snake must move to vacate (4,4) and then head must reach it.\n- **Food at (4,5)**: Longer life_span (disappears after turn 88), can be targeted later.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it causes collision. Must avoid this when targeting food.\n- **Survival Priority**: Think 5+ turns ahead (to turn 86+). Avoid dead ends and collisions. Path to (4,4) is time-sensitive.\n\n**5-Turn Plan (Turns 81-85):**\n- **Turn 81 (only move)**: Move D to (1,3) to avoid immediate collision and progress toward center.\n- **Turn 82**: From (1,3), direction D. Only valid move is R to (2,3) (down to (1,2) is wall, left to (0,3) is wall, up is reverse).\n- **Turn 83**: From (2,3), direction R. Choices:\n  - R to (3,3): Progresses toward (4,4) food efficiently.\n  - D to (2,2): Moves away from food, risking missing (4,4) due to short life_span.\n  - **Choose R to (3,3)** to reach (4,4) by turn 85.\n- **Turn 84**: From (3,3), direction R. Move R to (4,3) to position for eating (4,4) next turn. (Down to (3,2) is possible but delays food access.)\n- **Turn 85**: From (4,3), direction R. Move U to (4,4) to eat food:\n  - (4,4) is free (vacated on turn 84).\n  - Head not adjacent to tail (tail at (3,4), diagonal to (4,3)), so no Tail Reward Danger.\n  - Eating gains +1 score and increases length to 16.\n\n**Long-Term Considerations (Beyond Turn 85):**\n- After eating (4,4), head at (4,4) direction U. Next moves (e.g., to (5,4)) can target (4,5) food, which must be vacated first. Life_span allows until turn 88.\n- Avoid walls and body collisions; grid has open paths. Survival is prioritized over immediate food if risks arise.\n- Simulated positions (for verification):\n  - Turn 81 end: Head (1,3), body: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)], tail (4,2).\n  - Turn 82 end: Head (2,3), body: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)], tail (4,3).\n  - Turn 83 end: Head (3,3), body: [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)], tail (4,4).\n  - Turn 84 end: Head (4,3), body: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)], tail (3,4). (4,4) vacated.\n  - Turn 85 end: Eat at (4,4). Head (4,4), body: [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] (length 16).\n\n**Actions for Turns 81-85:**\n- Turn 81: Move D (down) – only choice, avoids risk.\n- Turn 82: Move R (right) – only choice, progresses.\n- Turn 83: Move R (right) – targets food efficiently.\n- Turn 84: Move R (right) – positions for food.\n- Turn 85: Move U (up) – eats (4,4) food safely.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 81: D\nTurn 82: R\nTurn 83: R\nTurn 84: R\nTurn 85: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The turn is 82, and I must plan at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\n**Walls**: The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So, the grid size is 8x8 since x and y from 0 to 7 inclusive.\n\n**Snake Positions**: The snake is a list of segments from head to tail: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]. Head is at (1,3), and it's moving downward (D), which is decreasing y, since D is (x,y-1).\n\nDirection is D, so from (1,3), moving D would go to (1,2), but let's see where the snake is. Positions: (1,3) head, then (1,4), (1,5), so the head is at (1,3), which is below (1,4) and (1,5). Since D is down, y decreases, so from (1,4) to (1,3) would be down? Let's clarify coordinates.\n\nAssuming (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Typically in grids, (0,0) might be top-left with y increasing down, or bottom-left with y increasing up. But in the movement, U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increasing up or down? Let's see the directions:\n\n- U: (x, y+1) — if y increases upward, U would be up; if y increases downward, U would be down. But in standard Snake, often y increases downward.\n\nBut in the problem, it says: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). And walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders.\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), so from (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3), which are decreasing y if y=5 to y=3, so y=3 is below y=5 if y increases upward? I think there's ambiguity.\n\nPerhaps I should assume the coordinate system. Since U is (x,y+1) and D is (x,y-1), and from the positions, (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3), y is decreasing from head to previous segments? Head is (1,3), then next is (1,4), which has higher y, so if y increases upward, (1,4) is above (1,3), but the snake was moving down to (1,3), so direction D.\n\nDirection is given as D, so from previous position to head. Head is at (1,3), and previous was (1,4), so moving from (1,4) to (1,3) is down, meaning decreasing y, so y=0 is bottom and y=7 is top? But (1,5) has y=5, (1,4) y=4, (1,3) y=3, so if head is at (1,3) and moving D to (1,2), that would be decreasing y further.\n\nBut let's confirm with walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is bottom or top? Since D is (x,y-1), moving down decreases y, so if y decreases down, y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo coordinate system: (0,0) bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\ny=0 bottom, y=7 top. U: (x,y+1) increases y, so up. D: (x,y-1) decreases y, down.\n\nSnake positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), etc. From (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3) is decreasing y, so moving down. Then to (2,5)? (2,5) is same y as (1,5)? Positions: index 0: (1,3) head, index 1: (1,4), index 2: (1,5), index 3: (2,5), so from (1,5) to (2,5) is right, since x increases. Then (2,6) up to y=6, then (3,6) right, (4,6) right, (5,6) right, then (5,5) down to y=5, (4,5) left, (3,5) left, (3,4) down to y=4, (4,4) right, (4,3) down to y=3, (4,2) down to y=2.\n\nSo the snake is long: 15 segments.\n\nHead direction is D, so last move was down to (1,3).\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (4,4,5,1) — position (4,4), value 1, life_span 5\n\n- (4,5,7,1) — (4,5), value 1, life_span 7\n\n- (1,6,10,1) — (1,6), value 1, life_span 10\n\nAll are positive food since value +1, and life_span given.\n\nLife_span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 82, life_span is as given, so for (4,4) it has 5 turns left, etc.\n\nI need to choose actions for turns 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, and so on, but at least 5 turns, but since it's a sequence, I should plan multiple moves.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders and internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake occupies: let's list all positions to avoid.\n\nSnake: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\n(4,4) is occupied by snake body, and there's food at (4,4), but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves in. Similarly, (4,5) has food and is occupied by snake? Snake has (4,5) as a segment? Positions: (4,5) is index 9? List: index 0: (1,3) head, 1: (1,4), 2: (1,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (5,6), 8: (5,5), 9: (4,5), 10: (3,5), 11: (3,4), 12: (4,4), 13: (4,3), 14: (4,2) tail.\n\nSo (4,4) is occupied by segment at index 12, and (4,5) at index 9.\n\nFood at (4,4) and (4,5), both occupied by snake body. And (1,6) has food.\n\n(1,6) is not occupied? Snake has (2,6) and (1,5), but not (1,6), so (1,6) is free.\n\nNow, head at (1,3), direction D (down), so from (1,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since direction is D, reverse would be U, so cannot move U immediately.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so cannot move U (up) on next turn.\n\nPossible moves: D (down to (1,2)), L (left to (0,2)? x=0 is wall, so L not possible), R (right to (2,3)? possible), but cannot U.\n\nAlso, walls: (1,2) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,2) is an obstacle, so cannot move to (1,2).\n\nHead at (1,3), moving D to (1,2) is blocked by obstacle at (1,2). So cannot move D.\n\nCannot move U because reverse and also, U to (1,4) but (1,4) is snake body.\n\n(1,4) is occupied by snake body segment.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- D: to (1,2) — but (1,2) is wall/obstacle, so invalid.\n\n- U: to (1,4) — but (1,4) is occupied by snake body, and since it's not the tail, it would be collision. Tail is at (4,2), so (1,4) is body, not tail, so moving to (1,4) causes collision.\n\n- L: to (0,3) — but x=0 is border wall, so invalid.\n\n- R: to (2,3) — is this free? (2,3) not in snake positions? Snake positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), etc. (2,3) is not listed, and not a wall except borders and internal obstacles. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4). (2,3) not obstacle, so should be free.\n\n(2,3) is empty? Let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSo (2,3) is not in any, so it's free.\n\nTherefore, only possible move from (1,3) is R to (2,3), since D, U, L are all invalid.\n\nL is to (0,3), wall; U to (1,4), body; D to (1,2), obstacle; only R to (2,3) is possible.\n\nAnd since direction was D, moving R is not reverse, so allowed.\n\nReverse only if opposite direction, U is opposite of D, so U not allowed, but R is perpendicular, so fine.\n\nSo for turn 82, must move R to (2,3).\n\nThen, after moving, head is at (2,3), and direction is now R (since moved right).\n\nSnake moves: head to (2,3), tail might move or not, depending on if food eaten.\n\nBut no food at (2,3), so snake moves, tail segment (4,2) is removed, new positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) — and tail was (4,2), removed, so (4,3) is new tail? Let's index.\n\nAfter move: head at (2,3), then previous head (1,3) becomes segment 1, then (1,4) seg2, (1,5) seg3, (2,5) seg4, (2,6) seg5, (3,6) seg6, (4,6) seg7, (5,6) seg8, (5,5) seg9, (4,5) seg10, (3,5) seg11, (3,4) seg12, (4,4) seg13, (4,3) seg14. Tail was (4,2) removed, so (4,3) is now tail.\n\nLength same, no food eaten.\n\nNow turn 83, head at (2,3), direction R (since moved right).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut cannot reverse, so since direction R, cannot move L (left).\n\nNow, check surroundings:\n\n- U: to (2,4) — (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\n- D: to (2,2) — is this free? (2,2) not in snake: snake now at (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3). (2,2) not listed. Walls: internal (1,2), (2,4) already, (5,1), etc. (2,2) not wall, not snake, so should be free.\n\n- L: to (1,3) — but (1,3) is now snake body (segment after head? positions: head (2,3), then (1,3) is segment 1, so occupied, and not tail, so collision if move there. Tail is (4,3). So moving to (1,3) causes collision.\n\n- R: to (3,3) — (3,3) not in snake positions? Snake has (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), but not (3,3). (3,3) not wall, so free.\n\nPossible moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3), since U wall, L body.\n\nNow, need to think ahead to maximize score.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (4,4) with life_span 5, but at turn 82, life_span 5, so by turn 83, life_span 4? Life_span decreases every turn, including current turn? The state is at turn 82, so food has life_span as given: (4,4) life 5, (4,5) life 7, (1,6) life 10.\n\nAfter turn 82, life_span decreases by 1 for all, so at start of turn 83, (4,4) life 4, (4,5) life 6, (1,6) life 9.\n\nSimilarly, after each turn.\n\nNow, (4,4) is occupied by snake body, segment at (4,4). To eat it, the body must move away, and head move in.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5).\n\n(1,6) is free, but has life 10, plenty of time.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (4,3) after turn 82 move? After turn 82, head moved to (2,3), tail is (4,3)? Let's clarify.\n\nAfter turn 82: snake positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nTail at (4,3)\n\nFood at (4,4) and (4,5) are under snake body.\n\n(4,4) has segment, (4,5) has segment.\n\n(1,6) is free.\n\nNow for turn 83, head at (2,3), can move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf move R to (3,3), then direction becomes R.\n\nThen possible next moves from (3,3): U to (3,4), but (3,4) is snake body (segment 12, (3,4)), occupied, collision.\n\nD to (3,2), might be free? (3,2) not snake, not wall.\n\nL to (2,3), but (2,3) is now body after move, so if move to (2,3), collision.\n\nR to (4,3), but (4,3) is tail? After turn 83, if head moves to (3,3), then positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (1,3), etc., tail (4,3) removed? No food, so tail moves.\n\nAfter move to (3,3), head to (3,3), then segments: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), ..., up to (4,4), and (4,3) removed, so tail is now (4,4)? Positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) — and (4,3) removed, so (4,4) is new tail.\n\n(4,4) has food, but it's under tail now.\n\nBut head is at (3,3), not adjacent to tail yet.\n\nIf from (3,3) move U to (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied by segment, collision.\n\nD to (3,2), possible.\n\nL to (2,3), occupied by body, collision.\n\nR to (4,3), but (4,3) was just removed, so now (4,3) is free? After move to (3,3), (4,3) is removed, so (4,3) is empty, but head moving to (4,3) from (3,3)? (4,3) is not occupied now, but let's see.\n\nAfter moving to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) tail.\n\n(4,3) is free now.\n\nBut to move to (4,3) from (3,3) is right, but (4,3) is free, so possible, but (4,3) has no food, I think.\n\nFood is at (4,4), (4,5), (1,6).\n\n(4,3) no food.\n\nSo from (3,3), possible moves: D to (3,2) or R to (4,3), since U and L blocked.\n\nBut R to (4,3) is possible.\n\nThen if move to (4,3), head at (4,3), then direction right.\n\nBut (4,3) was tail position? No, after previous move, (4,3) is free.\n\nThen positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), etc., tail (4,4) removed? No, tail is (4,4), so moving to (4,3), no food, so tail (4,4) removed, new tail is (3,4) or something.\n\nThis is getting messy. I should think about eating the food.\n\nPerhaps I should aim to eat the food at (1,6) first, since it's free and has long life.\n\nOr try to free up the body to eat (4,4) or (4,5).\n\nBut (4,4) and (4,5) are under body, need to move away.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 15 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nLet's list all free cells or map the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, total cells 64.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 all walls, but internal obstacles are additional walls.\n\nBorders: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — so these are also walls.\n\nSo wall cells: all border cells plus these five.\n\nNow snake occupies 15 cells.\n\nFood at (4,4), (4,5), (1,6) — but (4,4) and (4,5) are occupied by snake, so not free for head to move, only if body moves away.\n\n(1,6) is free.\n\nOther free cells.\n\nBut for planning, let's go back to turn 83 choices.\n\nHead at (2,3), can move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf move R to (3,3), then as above, can move D to (3,2) or R to (4,3).\n\nFrom (3,3) move R to (4,3): (4,3) is free, head to (4,3), then positions: head (4,3), body (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) — tail (3,4) or? After moving to (4,3), previous tail (4,4) removed, so segments: head (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) and (4,4) removed, so (3,4) is new tail.\n\nTail at (3,4), which has food? (3,4) position, food is at (4,4), not (3,4), so no.\n\nFood at (4,4) is now gone because the body moved away? But it wasn't eaten, just the cell is free now, but food is still there until eaten or expired.\n\nFood life_span decreases, but it remains until head eats it or life_span 0.\n\nWhen body moves away, the food is still there and can be eaten if head moves in.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5).\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), (4,4) is now free and has food with life 4 at turn 83 start? Let's track time.\n\nAt turn 82 start: food (4,4) life 5, (4,5) life 7, (1,6) life 10.\n\nAfter turn 82 action (move R to (2,3)), no food eaten, so at turn 83 start, food life: (4,4) life 4, (4,5) life 6, (1,6) life 9.\n\nAfter move to (4,3) on turn 83, if we do that, then at (4,3), no food, so at turn 84 start, food life (4,4) life 3, (4,5) life 5, (1,6) life 8.\n\nAnd (4,4) is free, so head at (4,3) can move to (4,4) to eat food.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction from moving R to (4,3), so direction R.\n\nFrom (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nBut (4,2) is wall? (4,2) was tail earlier, but now it's free? Walls: (4,2) not listed as wall, but internal obstacles include (1,2), but (4,2) is not obstacle, not border, so free.\n\nBut (4,2) is free, but let's see snake positions after turn 83 move.\n\nIf on turn 83 moved R to (3,3), then to (4,3), but that's two moves, I need to choose one action for turn 83.\n\nFor turn 83, from (2,3), I have two choices: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf I choose R to (3,3), then on turn 84, from (3,3), I can move to (4,3) or (3,2).\n\nThen if move to (4,3), on turn 85, from (4,3) I can move U to (4,4) to eat food.\n\nBut (4,4) has food, and if head moves to (4,4), it eats it, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nCurrent length 15, eat food, length 16, new tail position same as old tail since growth.\n\nBut when eating, the segment is added at head, so positions increase.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nFirst, for turn 83, if I move R to (3,3), then direction R.\n\nThen turn 84, from (3,3), can move D to (3,2) or R to (4,3) (since U to (3,4) body, L to (2,3) body).\n\nSay I move R to (4,3), then head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nThen turn 85, from (4,3), can move U to (4,4), which has food, so eat it.\n\nBut is (4,4) free? After moving to (4,3), the position (4,4) is free, yes, as we saw.\n\nAlso, head moving to (4,4) from (4,3) U, so up.\n\nNow, after eating, snake grows, so positions: head to (4,4), then new segment, so body includes (4,3), (3,3), etc., tail stays at (3,4) or where?\n\nBefore eating: head at (4,3), body (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) tail.\n\nMove U to (4,4), eat food, so new head (4,4), and since ate, add new segment at head, so positions: head (4,4), then previous head (4,3) becomes segment, so (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) -- and tail (3,4) is still there, but now length 16, so (3,4) is tail, and (4,5) is body.\n\n(4,5) has food, but it's under body.\n\nAfter eating, the food at (4,4) is consumed, so gone.\n\nNow, life_span of (4,4) was 4 at turn 83 start, eaten on turn 85, so it was eaten before expiring.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nBut now, head at (4,4), direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot reverse, so since moved U, cannot move D.\n\nNow, surroundings:\n\n- U: to (4,5) — but (4,5) is occupied by snake body (segment for (4,5)), and it's not tail, so collision. Tail is (3,4).\n\n- D: to (4,3) — but (4,3) is now body segment, occupied, collision.\n\n- L: to (3,4) — (3,4) is tail. Moving to tail is allowed only if not eating, but here no food at (3,4), so moving to tail is safe because the tail will move away, but only if not eating food.\n\nRule: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\n\nBut in this case, (3,4) is tail, and no food there, so moving to (3,4) is safe, head moves to (3,4), tail moves to next, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, R: to (5,4) — (5,4) might be free? Not snake, not wall? Walls: internal (6,4), but (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\n(5,4) not in snake positions above, not wall, so free.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,4) after eating: L to (3,4) or R to (5,4), since U and D blocked by body.\n\nIf move L to (3,4), head to (3,4), which is tail, so safe, tail moves to next segment.\n\nThen positions: head to (3,4), tail was (3,4), so tail moves to the previous segment of tail, which was (3,5)? Before move, positions: head (4,4), segments (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) tail.\n\nMove head to (3,4), which is tail, so since no food eaten, tail moves to the next, which is (3,5)? The tail segment is removed, so new positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), ..., up to (4,5), (3,5) -- and (3,4) was tail, removed, so (3,5) is new tail.\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (5,4), head to (5,4), then positions: head (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), etc., tail (3,4) removed, new tail (3,5).\n\nBut this is getting ahead.\n\nBack to turn 83 choice.\n\nAt turn 83, head at (2,3), if I move R to (3,3), then I can potentially eat (4,4) on turn 85.\n\nBut let's see the other choice: move D to (2,2) on turn 83.\n\nFrom (2,3), move D to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is free, as we said.\n\nThen head to (2,2), direction D.\n\nThen positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), etc., tail (4,3) removed, new tail (4,4)? Positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) -- and (4,3) removed, so (4,4) tail.\n\n(4,4) has food, but it's under tail now.\n\nThen turn 84, head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot reverse, so cannot move U.\n\n- U: to (2,3) — (2,3) is now body, occupied, collision.\n\n- D: to (2,1) — y=1, not border, not wall? Internal obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), but (2,1) not listed, so free? But (2,1) might be ok.\n\n- L: to (1,2) — but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\n- R: to (3,2) — (3,2) free, as before.\n\nSo possible: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf move D to (2,1), then head to (2,1), direction D.\n\nThen can continue down, but y=0 is border, so y=1 to y=0, but y=0 wall, so dead end.\n\nNot good.\n\nMove R to (3,2) on turn 84.\n\nThen from (3,2), etc.\n\nBut this seems less direct to food.\n\nMoreover, (4,4) food has less life, only 4 at turn 83 start, so if not eaten soon, it might expire.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) has more life.\n\nBut let's consider the path to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), head at (2,3) after turn 82.\n\nTo reach (1,6), need to go left and up.\n\nBut from (2,3), if I move R to (3,3), I go right, away from (1,6).\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), then to (3,2), then I can go up to (3,3) or (3,4), but (3,4) is body, etc.\n\nFrom (2,3), moving D to (2,2) might allow me to go to (1,6) later, but it's farther.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), move R to (3,2), then to (3,1) or (4,2), but (4,2) was snake, but removed, so free.\n\n(4,2) is free now.\n\nBut (1,6) is at top-left.\n\nPerhaps not efficient.\n\nSince (4,4) food has short life, it might be better to eat it soon.\n\nAlso, (4,5) has life 6, longer.\n\n(1,6) life 9.\n\nSo for short-term, eating (4,4) might be good.\n\nBut to eat (4,4), from current position, moving to (3,3) then (4,3) then (4,4) seems possible in 3 moves: turn 83 to (3,3), turn 84 to (4,3), turn 85 to (4,4) eat.\n\nTurn 83: from (2,3) to (3,3)\n\nTurn 84: from (3,3) to (4,3)\n\nTurn 85: from (4,3) to (4,4) eat.\n\nThen on turn 85, eat, snake grows.\n\nThen head at (4,4), can move L to (3,4) or R to (5,4), as before.\n\nNow, (3,4) is tail? After moving to (4,4) on turn 85, positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) -- and since ate, no tail move, so tail still (3,4).\n\nLength 16.\n\nHead at (4,4), move L to (3,4), which is tail, so safe, head to (3,4), tail moves to (3,5) or something.\n\nAfter move to (3,4), no food, so tail moves: new positions head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), etc., up to (4,5), (3,5), and tail (3,5) removed? Let's not detail.\n\nMove R to (5,4) might be better to open space.\n\n(5,4) is free.\n\nThen can go to (5,5) or other.\n\nBut there is food at (4,5), which is still under body? (4,5) is occupied by segment, so need to free it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is available.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead from turn 82.\n\nTurn 82: must move R to (2,3)\n\nTurn 83: from (2,3), I need to choose.\n\nIf I move R to (3,3), then turn 84 to (4,3), turn 85 to (4,4) eat.\n\nThen for turn 86, from (4,4), move to (5,4) or (3,4).\n\nIf move to (5,4), then direction R.\n\nThen can consider eating (4,5) or (1,6).\n\n(4,5) has life 6 at turn 82, at turn 83 life 5, turn 84 life 4, turn 85 life 3, so on turn 86, life 2, still time.\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied by body, so need to move body away.\n\nCurrently, (4,5) is a body segment.\n\nAfter eating at (4,4) on turn 85, the segment at (4,5) is still there.\n\nTo eat (4,5), the body must move away from (4,5), then head move in.\n\nSimilarly, the tail is at (3,4), which might move.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\n(1,6) is free, but far.\n\nAnother option: from turn 83, if I move D to (2,2), then I can go to (1,6) via a different path.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), move to (1,2) but (1,2) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only to (3,2) or (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is risky, near border.\n\nMove to (3,2), then to (3,1) or (4,2) or (3,3).\n\n(3,3) might be occupied later.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), from (2,2), move to (3,2), then to (3,3) but (3,3) might be snake if I didn't go there, but in this path, from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), but (3,3) may be free or not.\n\nAt turn 83, if I move D to (2,2), then on turn 84, from (2,2), move R to (3,2), then head at (3,2), direction R.\n\nThen turn 85, from (3,2), can move U to (3,3), or D to (3,1), or R to (4,2), or L to (2,2) but reverse, cannot since direction R, L is opposite, so cannot.\n\nDirection from (3,2) is R, so cannot move L to (2,2).\n\nPossible: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), R to (4,2).\n\n(3,3) might be free, but if I go this way, at turn 85, (3,3) could be free.\n\nBut earlier, if I went to (3,3) on turn 83, it was free, but now different path.\n\nTo simplify, since (4,4) food has short life, and I can eat it in 3 moves from now, it might be the best immediate action.\n\nThen after that, I can go for other food.\n\nAlso, need to avoid dead ends.\n\nThe area around (2,3) to (4,4) seems open.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently, after eating (4,4), tail is at (3,4), head at (4,4), not adjacent.\n\nIf I move to (3,4), head to tail, but no food there, so safe.\n\nBut if tail had food, it would be dangerous, but here no.\n\nSo for turn 83, I think moving R to (3,3) is better to approach the food.\n\nThen for turn 84, move to (4,3), turn 85 to (4,4) eat.\n\nThen for turn 86, from (4,4), I can move R to (5,4) to explore or L to (3,4) to shorten, but L to (3,4) is safe.\n\nBut moving R to (5,4) might be better for space.\n\n(5,4) is free, then from there, I can go to (5,5) or (6,4), but (6,4) is obstacle, wall.\n\nInternal obstacle (6,4), so (6,4) wall.\n\nSo from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4) but body, or R to (6,4) wall.\n\nSo U, D, or L but L is body, so only U or D.\n\nU to (5,5): (5,5) is snake body? After turn 85, positions include (5,5) as segment? Before eating on turn 85, positions had (5,5), and after eating, it's still there.\n\nAfter turn 85 eat at (4,4), positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) tail.\n\nSo (5,5) is occupied by body.\n\nSo from (4,4), if move R to (5,4), head to (5,4), no food, so tail moves: positions head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), ..., up to (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) -- tail (3,4) removed, new tail (3,5)? Segments: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) -- and (3,4) removed, so (3,5) new tail.\n\n(5,5) is still occupied.\n\nFrom (5,4), can move U to (5,5) but occupied, collision.\n\nD to (5,3), if free.\n\n(5,3) not snake, not wall, so free.\n\nSo only D to (5,3).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut it's fine.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nFor turn 82: action R\n\nTurn 83: action R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 84: from (3,3), move R to (4,3) — action R\n\nThen turn 85: from (4,3), move U to (4,4) — action U, eat food.\n\nNow for turn 86, from (4,4), I need to move, say to (5,4) or (3,4).\n\nSince (4,5) has food and shorter life, I might want to eat it next.\n\n(4,5) is currently occupied by body segment.\n\nAfter turn 85, (4,5) is still occupied.\n\nTo free (4,5), the snake needs to move so that the segment at (4,5) moves away.\n\nCurrently, after turn 85, (4,5) is a body segment, not tail.\n\nTail is at (3,4).\n\nAs the snake moves, segments shift.\n\nFor example, if from (4,4) I move to (5,4) on turn 86, then head to (5,4), tail moves to (3,5), as above.\n\nThen (4,5) is still occupied.\n\nIf I move to (3,4) on turn 86, head to (3,4), which is tail, so tail moves to (3,5), and (3,4) becomes head? Head to (3,4), then positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), ..., up to (4,5), (3,5) -- tail (3,5) removed? No food, so tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) -- and tail (3,5) removed, so (4,5) is new tail? Segments: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), ..., (5,5), (4,5) -- and (3,5) removed, so (4,5) is the last segment, tail.\n\n(4,5) has food, and now it's under tail.\n\nTo eat it, head needs to move to (4,5), but if tail is there, and head moves to it, since it has food, it might be dangerous because of tail reward danger.\n\nRule: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, head at (3,4), tail at (4,5), are they adjacent? (3,4) and (4,5) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo not adjacent.\n\nIf head moves to (4,5), which is tail, and it has food, so eating it.\n\nBut rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nBut here, if head moves directly to tail cell, it is not adjacent, it is on the same cell? Moving to the tail cell.\n\nThe rule says \"adjacent to the tail\", meaning next to, not on the same cell.\n\nFor moving to the tail cell: if no food, it is safe because tail moves away.\n\nIf there is food on the tail cell, and head moves to it, it eats the food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and head is on the same cell, but since it grows, a new segment is added, so the head and the new tail are on the same cell? Let's think.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell with food, it eats, so the head moves to that cell, and since it eats, a new segment is added at the position where the head was, so the snake grows, tail stays in place.\n\nIf head moves to the tail cell and eats food there, then head moves to tail cell, eats food, adds new segment, so the old tail is now part of body, and the new segment is added behind head, but head is on tail cell, so positions: head on the food cell (which was tail), and a new segment is added at previous head position.\n\nSo the cell that was tail now has head, and the tail remains where it was? No.\n\nExample: suppose tail at T, head at H, and T has food. Head moves to T, eats food, so new head position is T, and a new segment is added at the previous head position H. So the tail remains, and the new segment is behind head. So the cell T now has head, and the tail is still at its previous position, but since head moved to T, which was tail, and tail didn't move yet, but after eating, the tail stays, so T is now head, and the segment before tail is still there, so the snake has head at T, then the new segment at H, then the body, then tail.\n\nBut the tail position didn't change because of eating.\n\nIn this case, since head moved to tail position and ate, the tail remains, but head is on the same cell, which is now empty of tail? I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard Snake: when head moves to food, it grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nPositions: suppose before move, head at A, tail at Z.\n\nHead moves to B with food, so new head at B, new segment added at A, so positions: B (head), A (new segment), ..., and tail still at Z.\n\nSo Z is still tail.\n\nIf B was Z, then head moves to Z, which had food, so now positions: Z (head), A (new segment), ..., and tail at Z? No, tail is at Z, but Z is now head, so the tail should be the last segment, which is still Z? Contradiction.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nTypically, when head moves to a cell, if no food, tail moves, so the cell behind is free.\n\nIf food, tail doesn't move, new segment added at head old position.\n\nSo if head moves to tail cell:\n\n- If no food on tail cell, head moves to tail cell, tail moves to next, so no issue.\n\n- If food on tail cell, head moves to tail cell, eats food, so tail does not move, and new segment added at previous head position. So the tail cell now has head, and the tail remains at the same position, but that position is now head, so the tail must be the previous segment.\n\nExample: positions: ... Y, Z (tail)\n\nHead at H, moves to Z (which is tail and has food).\n\nAfter move: head at Z, and since ate, add new segment at H, so positions: Z (head), H (new segment), ..., Y, and Z was tail, but Z is now head, so the new tail is Y.\n\nSo the cell Z is now head, and tail is at Y.\n\nNo collision, because head is at Z, tail at Y.\n\nOnly if head and tail were adjacent before move, but after move, head at Z, tail at Y, which may or may not be adjacent.\n\nIn the rule, \"Tail Reward Danger\" is when head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, then if head moves to eat it, after eating, head is on tail cell, tail is on previous, so if they were adjacent, now head and new tail might be adjacent or not.\n\nRule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo if head adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, if head moves to tail cell to eat, after eating, head is on that cell, new segment added behind head, so the new tail is the old tail segment? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: head at H, tail at T, and H adjacent to T (neighbors), and T has food.\n\nHead moves to T, eats food, so new head at T, new segment added at H.\n\nThe body: the segment that was before T is, say, S.\n\nAfter move, positions: T (head), H (new segment), ..., S, and since tail didn't move, but the last segment is still S? Before move, positions: ..., S, T (tail)\n\nAfter head moves to T: head at T, and add new segment at H, so the positions are: T (head), H (new segment), then the previous segments except tail doesn't move, but the previous segments include S to H? The body is from the first segment after head to before tail.\n\nAssume positions: P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n\nHead at P0, tail at Pk.\n\nIf P0 adjacent to Pk, and Pk has food.\n\nHead moves to Pk, eats food, so new head at Pk, and new segment added at P0, so positions: Pk (head), P0 (new segment), P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}, and Pk was tail, but Pk is now head, so tail is P_{k-1}.\n\nNow, the new head is at Pk, and the new tail is at P_{k-1}.\n\nSince P0 was adjacent to Pk, and Pk and P_{k-1} may be adjacent or not.\n\nIf the snake was straight, P0 to Pk adjacent, and P_{k-1} to Pk adjacent, so after move, head at Pk, tail at P_{k-1}, which are adjacent, and since head is there, it collides with body.\n\nFor example, positions: H at (1,1), tail at (1,2), adjacent, and (1,2) has food.\n\nHead moves to (1,2), eats, new head at (1,2), new segment at (1,1), so positions: head (1,2), segment (1,1), and tail was (1,2), but now tail is the previous segment, say if longer, but in this case, if only two segments, after move, head (1,2), body (1,1), tail (1,1), so head and tail same cell, collision.\n\nIf longer, head at (1,2), body (1,1), and previous body, tail at previous tail-1, which might be adjacent to (1,2) or not.\n\nBut in general, if head and tail were adjacent, after eating at tail, the new head and new tail are at positions that were adjacent before, and since head moved to tail, the new tail is close, likely causing collision.\n\nSo the rule says it kills the snake.\n\nIn our case, after eating at (4,4), head at (4,4), tail at (3,4), which are adjacent? (4,4) and (3,4) are left-right, so adjacent.\n\nIf I move to (3,4) on turn 86, (3,4) is tail, but it has no food? (3,4) position, food is at (4,5), not here.\n\nIn this move, I'm moving to (3,4) which is tail, no food, so it's safe, no growth, tail moves away.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBack to (4,5) food.\n\nTo eat (4,5), it needs to be free.\n\nCurrently occupied, and as snake moves, it might be freed.\n\nFor example, if from (4,4) I move to (5,4) on turn 86, then later the segment at (4,5) might move.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSince (1,6) has long life, I can go for it after eating (4,4).\n\nBut (1,6) is at (1,6), which is near the snake's body.\n\nCurrent positions after turn 85: head at (4,4), body includes (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) is free.\n\n(1,6) is free and has food.\n\nSo from (4,4), I can move towards (1,6).\n\nFor example, move L to (3,4) on turn 86, then to (3,5) or (2,4), but (2,4) is wall.\n\n(3,4) to (3,5) or (2,4) invalid, or (3,3).\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output at least 5 turns: turn 82,83,84,85,86.\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nTurn 83: R (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 84: R (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 85: U (to (4,4) eat)\n\nThen for turn 86, I can choose, say, R to (5,4) or L to (3,4).\n\nTo be safe, move to (5,4) to avoid the crowded area.\n\nSince the snake is long, need space.\n\nAlso, after moving, the food at (4,5) might be freed later.\n\n(4,5) life: at turn 82 life 7, turn 83:6, turn 84:5, turn 85:4, after turn 85 eaten (4,4), turn 86: (4,5) life 3, etc.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life 10 at turn 82, turn 86: life 6 or so.\n\nSo for turn 86, from (4,4), move R to (5,4).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I think I have the first few moves.\n\nSo for turn 82: R\n\nTurn 83: R\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nThen for turn 86, say R to (5,4)\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from turn 82.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 86, it depends on previous, but I need to commit.\n\nPerhaps I can output up to turn 86.\n\nBut let's see if from turn 83 I can do something else, but I think eating the short-life food is good.\n\nAnother thing: at (1,6) there is food, and it's free, so I could go directly, but from (2,3), moving R is away, while moving D might allow later access, but D to (2,2) then to (3,2) then to (3,3) or up, but to (1,6) I need to go left and up.\n\nFrom (3,2), move to (3,3), then to (2,3) but occupied, or to (2,2) but might be occupied, not easy.\n\nWhereas after eating (4,4), from (4,4) I can go left to (3,4), then to (3,5) or (2,5), but (2,5) is body, etc., but eventually to (1,6).\n\nFor example, after turn 85, head at (4,4), move L to (3,4) on turn 86.\n\nThen head at (3,4), which was tail, now moved.\n\nThen from (3,4), can move U to (3,5), but (3,5) is body? After move to (3,4), positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), etc., including (3,5) as body.\n\n(3,5) is occupied.\n\nMove L to (2,4), but (2,4) wall.\n\nMove D to (3,3), but (3,3) is body.\n\nSo from (3,4), only possible move might be U to (3,5) but occupied, collision, or other directions.\n\n(3,4) to (3,5) up, (3,5) occupied; to (2,4) left, wall; to (4,4) right, occupied; to (3,3) down, occupied? (3,3) is body.\n\nAll surrounded except if I came from somewhere.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4) on turn 86, positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) tail? Tail is (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is tail.\n\nSo from (3,4), adjacent cells: (3,5) up: tail, (2,4) left: wall, (4,4) right: body, (3,3) down: body.\n\nMove to (3,5): (3,5) is tail, no food, so safe to move there.\n\nMove to (3,5), head to (3,5), which is tail, so tail moves to previous, which might be (4,5) or something.\n\nPositions before move: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), ..., (4,5), (3,5) tail.\n\nMove head to (3,5), no food (assuming no food at (3,5)), so tail moves: head to (3,5), then segments (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), ..., up to (4,5), and tail (3,5) removed? Tail was (3,5), but head moving to it, so new head at (3,5), then the body is (3,4), (4,4), etc., and tail is the last, which was (4,5)? Positions: after move, head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) -- and (3,5) was tail, removed, so (4,5) is new tail.\n\n(4,5) has food, but under tail now.\n\nThen head at (3,5), can move to other places.\n\nBut it's possible.\n\nTo avoid, moving to (5,4) on turn 86 might be better.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll go with the initial plan.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nTurn 83: R\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nThen for turn 86, I need to choose, say R to (5,4)\n\nBut since the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output 5 actions.\n\nTurn 86: R\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nAlso, for turn 84, from (3,3), I could move D to (3,2) instead of R to (4,3), but that delays eating, not good.\n\nSo I think R to (4,3) is fine.\n\nSimilarly, all moves seem necessary.\n\nSo for answer:\n\nTurn 82: R\n\nTurn 83: R\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: R  (to (5,4))\n\nIn the boxed format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Current constraints**: At turn 82, the snake head is at (1,3) with direction D (down). Moving directly down to (1,2) is blocked by an internal obstacle at (1,2). Moving up (U) is impossible due to the no-instant-reverse rule (opposite of D) and would cause a body collision at (1,4). Moving left (L) to (0,3) is blocked by the border wall. The only safe move is right (R) to (2,3).\n- **Food prioritization**: The food at (4,4) has a short life span (5 at turn 82, decreasing each turn). Eating it soon is critical to avoid expiration. The path to (4,4) via (3,3) and (4,3) is feasible and safe, allowing consumption on turn 85. The food at (4,5) has a longer life span (7 at turn 82) and can be targeted later. The food at (1,6) has a long life span (10 at turn 82) but is farther away; it can be pursued after securing (4,4).\n- **Collision avoidance**: All moves are checked for body and wall collisions. After eating at (4,4) on turn 85, moving right (R) to (5,4) on turn 86 avoids the crowded body area and opens space for future moves.\n- **5+ turn plan**: The sequence below ensures the snake eats the high-risk, short-life food at (4,4) while maintaining safety and setting up for future food opportunities.\n\n### Planned Actions\n- **Turn 82**: Move R (right) to (2,3). This is the only safe move from (1,3), avoiding walls and body collisions.\n- **Turn 83**: Move R (right) to (3,3). From (2,3), moving up to (2,4) is blocked by an obstacle, moving down to (2,2) is possible but delays accessing (4,4), and moving left to (1,3) causes a body collision. Moving right to (3,3) is safe and progresses toward (4,4).\n- **Turn 84**: Move R (right) to (4,3). From (3,3), moving up to (3,4) causes a body collision, moving down to (3,2) is safe but delays the food plan, and moving left to (2,3) causes a body collision. Moving right to (4,3) positions the head to eat (4,4) next turn.\n- **Turn 85**: Move U (up) to (4,4) to eat the food. From (4,3), moving up to (4,4) consumes the food (value +1, snake length increases to 16). Moving down to (4,2) is possible but misses the food opportunity. Moving left to (3,3) or right to (5,3) is safe but less optimal with the food at risk. Eating (4,4) now maximizes immediate score and prevents expiration (life span was 5 at turn 82, now 1 at turn 85 start).\n- **Turn 86**: Move R (right) to (5,4). From (4,4) after eating, moving up to (4,5) causes a body collision, moving down to (4,3) causes a body collision, and moving left to (3,4) is safe but enters a crowded area. Moving right to (5,4) is safe, avoids potential collisions, and explores open space for future moves toward (4,5) or (1,6).\n\nThis plan eats one food (+1 score) by turn 85 and ensures survival for at least 5 turns. Beyond turn 86, the snake should target the food at (4,5) (life span 2 at turn 86 start) by freeing the cell from body occupation or pursue (1,6) if safer.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 82: R\nTurn 83: R\nTurn 84: R\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: R\n}",

Also, there are internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head at (2,3), then body segments: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3).

So I can't move to those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,3), direction right. So from (2,3), moving right would go to (3,3), but let's see what's there.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,3). Direction is right, so last move was to the right? Snake head direction is given as R, which means it's facing right, so it came from the left.\n\nThe positions are listed head first: (2,3) is head, then (1,3) is the first body segment, which is left of head, so yes, snake is moving right from (1,3) to (2,3).\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,3): since direction is right, I can move right to (3,3), up to (2,4), or down to (2,2). I cannot move left because that would be opposite direction, and no instant reverse is allowed. So left is not possible.\n\nDirections: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nFrom (2,3):\n\n- Right: (3,3)\n\n- Up: (2,4)\n\n- Down: (2,2)\n\n- Left: (1,3) but that's the body segment, and it's occupied, but also, since direction is right, moving left is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo only three choices: R, U, D.\n\nNow, I need to think about the food. Food at (4,4), (4,5), (1,6).\n\n(4,4) is a food, but let's see the snake positions. Snake has segments: ..., (3,4), (4,4), (4,3). (4,4) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (4,4) and (4,3).\n\nList all snake positions to see what's occupied.\n\nSnake: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nSo (4,4) is a body segment, specifically the second last? Let's index them.\n\nHead: index 0: (2,3)\n\n1: (1,3)\n\n2: (1,4)\n\n3: (1,5)\n\n4: (2,5)\n\n5: (2,6)\n\n6: (3,6)\n\n7: (4,6)\n\n8: (5,6)\n\n9: (5,5)\n\n10: (4,5)\n\n11: (3,5)\n\n12: (3,4)\n\n13: (4,4)\n\n14: (4,3)  // tail\n\n(4,3) is the tail, (4,4) is the 13th segment, not tail.\n\nNow food at (4,4) and (4,5). But (4,4) is occupied by the snake body. Similarly, (4,5) is also a body segment? (4,5) is index 10 in the snake list.\n\nSnake positions: (4,5) is at index 10, and (4,4) at index 13.\n\nBut food is at (4,4) and (4,5). But these cells are currently occupied by the snake body.\n\nAccording to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n\nSo for (4,4) food, it's under the body now, but if the snake moves such that the body is no longer there, and head moves to (4,4), it can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5).\n\nAlso, there's food at (1,6), which might be accessible.\n\nLife span: (4,4) life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 turns, including this turn? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nTurn t1=83, so for (4,4) food, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 86? Let's see.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current turn.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t.\n\nAfter turn t + L - 1, it disappears? Let's clarify.\n\nIf at turn t, life span is L, then:\n\n- On turn t, countdown = L\n\n- On turn t+1, countdown = L-1\n\n- ...\n\n- On turn t + L - 1, countdown = 1\n\n- After turn t + L - 1, it disappears, so not available on turn t+L.\n\nFor example, if L=1, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only this turn if possible.\n\nSimilarly, L=4 at turn 83: countdown 4 on turn 83, 3 on 84, 2 on 85, 1 on 86, disappears after turn 86, so not on turn 87.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) life span 6: countdown 6 on 83, 5 on 84, ..., down to 1 on 88, disappears after 88.\n\n(1,6) life span 9: countdown 9 on 83, ..., down to 1 on 91, disappears after 91.\n\nNow, back to the snake. Head at (2,3), moving right.\n\nPossible moves: R to (3,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2).\n\nI need to check if these cells are safe: not wall, not body except tail.\n\nFirst, walls: borders and internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,4) is an obstacle? But (2,4) is also a snake body position? Snake has (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), etc., but (2,4) is not in the snake list? Snake positions: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ... no (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is not occupied by snake, but is it an obstacle?\n\nInternal obstacles include (2,4), so (2,4) is a wall cell, I think. \"Cells occupied by walls\" include border and internal obstacles, so (2,4) is a wall, so I cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4), (5,1), etc. are walls.\n\nSo for head at (2,3):\n\n- Move right to (3,3): is (3,3) occupied? Snake positions: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), no (3,3). Walls: borders and internal, (3,3) not listed, so should be free. But is it within bounds? x=3, y=3, between 0 and 7, not border, not internal obstacle, so free.\n\n- Move up to (2,4): but (2,4) is an internal obstacle, as listed, so wall, cannot move there.\n\n- Move down to (2,2): (2,2) - is it wall? Borders x=0,7 y=0,7, internal obstacles include (1,2), but not (2,2). (1,2) is obstacle, (2,2) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: no (2,2), so free.\n\nSo possible moves: R to (3,3) or D to (2,2). U is blocked by wall.\n\nNow, direction: current head direction is R, so if I move R, next direction will be R. If I move D, next direction will be D.\n\nI need to think about eating food and avoiding collisions.\n\nFood at (4,4) and (4,5) are under body now, so I need to move the body away.\n\n(4,4) has life span 4, so I have until turn 86 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) until turn 88.\n\n(1,6) at (1,6) is that free? Snake has (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and (1,6) not in list, walls not there, so it should be free. (1,6) is within bounds, y=6<7, x=1>0, not border, not internal obstacle, so yes.\n\nBut (1,6) is food, and it's not under snake, so I can eat it directly if head moves there.\n\nNow, head at (2,3), (1,6) is at (1,6), which is left and up, but snake is long, so it might be tricky.\n\nFirst, let's consider immediate moves.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go R to (3,3) or D to (2,2).\n\nIf I go R to (3,3), then from there, I can go to (4,3), but (4,3) is the tail? Snake tail is at (4,3), but when I move, the tail moves, so it might be ok.\n\nAfter move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nBut when I move to a cell, if it's food, I eat it, and tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nOtherwise, tail moves away.\n\nBut for collision, when head moves to a cell, it should not be occupied by body except the tail cell, because tail will move.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail cell is safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving to free cell or food cell.\n\nNow, (3,3) is free, as we said.\n\n(4,3) is tail, so if I go to (4,3) later, it might be safe if tail moves.\n\nBut let's plan.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the food at (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nCurrently, (4,4) is occupied by body, (4,5) also.\n\nTo eat (4,4) food, I need to move the body away from (4,4) and then head to (4,4).\n\nSimilarly for (4,5).\n\nLife span is short for (4,4), only 4 turns left.\n\nTurn 83: countdown 4\n\nAfter turn 83, if not eaten, countdown 3 on turn 84, etc.\n\nTo eat it, I need to be at (4,4) on or before turn 86.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) by turn 88.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,3), I need to go to (4,4).\n\nBut (4,4) is currently occupied, so I need to vacate it first.\n\nSimilarly, the tail is at (4,3), which is adjacent.\n\nLet me list the current grid state for clarity.\n\nGrid 8x8: rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: positions as above.\n\nFood: (4,4), (4,5), (1,6) all with value 1.\n\nNow, from head (2,3), move options:\n\nOption 1: R to (3,3)\n\nThen head at (3,3), tail at (4,3) moves? After move, if no food, tail moves away.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,3), no food at (3,3), so snake moves: new head at (3,3), body segments shift, so the segment that was at (1,3) moves to (2,3), etc., and tail (4,3) is removed, so new tail is the previous segment, which was (4,4)? Let's trace.\n\nCurrent snake: positions list, after moving head to new position, each body segment takes previous position.\n\nSo after move to (3,3):\n\n- New head: (3,3)\n\n- Then body: the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: (2,3) head\n\n1: (1,3)\n\n2: (1,4)\n\n3: (1,5)\n\n4: (2,5)\n\n5: (2,6)\n\n6: (3,6)\n\n7: (4,6)\n\n8: (5,6)\n\n9: (5,5)\n\n10: (4,5)\n\n11: (3,5)\n\n12: (3,4)\n\n13: (4,4)\n\n14: (4,3) tail\n\nAfter moving head to (3,3), new positions:\n\nHead: (3,3)\n\nThen body: the old positions from index 0 to 13, but shifted.\n\nThe segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, so (1,3) moves to (2,3)\n\nSegment at index 2 moves to where index 1 was, but we need the new list.\n\nNew snake: [ (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) ]  // (4,3) tail removed, so (4,4) is new tail.\n\nOld index 13 (4,4) becomes the tail, since index 14 is removed.\n\nLength is 15, after move without eating, length same, tail removed, so new snake has 14 segments? No.\n\nWhen no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nNumber of segments remains the same only if food eaten; otherwise, it decreases by one? No.\n\nSnake length: when no food, head moves to new position, tail is removed, so length decreases? No.\n\nStandard snake: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed, so the snake length remains the same, but it occupies different cells.\n\nFor example, from position list [A,B,C,D], head at A.\n\nAfter moving to E, new positions [E, A, B, C] if no food, so D is removed, length same.\n\nIn this case, length is constant unless food eaten.\n\nIn the positions list, number of segments is fixed between moves; when food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail.\n\nOtherwise, when moving, the head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nLength doesn't change unless food eaten.\n\nIn this case, snake has 15 segments. After moving to (3,3) without eating, new head at (3,3), then body: old head (2,3) becomes first body, old body (1,3) becomes next, and so on, up to old (4,4) which was index 13, and old tail (4,3) is removed, so new tail is old (4,4).\n\nNew positions: [ (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) ]  // 15 segments? Old list had 15 positions, after move, new head, and the first 14 old positions become the body, but shifted.\n\nOld positions: 0:(2,3), 1:(1,3), 2:(1,4), 3:(1,5), 4:(2,5), 5:(2,6), 6:(3,6), 7:(4,6), 8:(5,6), 9:(5,5), 10:(4,5), 11:(3,5), 12:(3,4), 13:(4,4), 14:(4,3)\n\nAfter moving to (3,3): new head (3,3)\n\nNew body: the positions that were occupied by the old body segments, but each moved to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSpecifically, the new body segment 1 is at the old head position (2,3)\n\nNew body segment 2 is at old body segment 1 position (1,3)\n\nNew body segment 3 is at old body segment 2 position (1,4)\n\n...\n\nNew body segment 14 is at old body segment 13 position (4,4)\n\nAnd old tail (4,3) is no longer occupied.\n\nSo new positions: [ (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nSo tail is now at (4,4).\n\nPreviously, (4,4) was occupied and had food, but after move, the body moved away from (4,3), but (4,4) is still occupied by the new tail.\n\n(4,4) was old body, now it's new tail.\n\nThe food at (4,4) is still under the snake, at the tail now.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is still occupied by body.\n\nBut to eat the food, we need the cell to be free when head moves there.\n\nBack to move from (2,3).\n\nOption 1: R to (3,3)\n\nThen from (3,3), what can I do?\n\nPossible moves from (3,3): direction will be R (since moved right).\n\nCan move R to (4,3), but (4,3) is currently tail, but after move, it might be different.\n\nAt this point, after move to (3,3), positions as above, tail at (4,4).\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move:\n\n- R to (4,3): is (4,3) free? After previous move, (4,3) is free, since tail moved to (4,4). (4,3) is not occupied now, and not wall, so can move there.\n\n- U to (3,4): (3,4) is in new positions? New positions have (3,4) as body segment, index 14? New list: head (3,3), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) tail.\n\nSo (3,4) is occupied by body, not tail, so moving to (3,4) would collide with body.\n\n- D to (3,2): (3,2) is it free? Walls: not border, not internal obstacle listed, so free. Snake positions: no (3,2), so free.\n\n- L to (2,3): but (2,3) is the first body segment, and moving left is opposite to current direction? Current direction after moving R to (3,3) is R, so moving left to (2,3) is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,3), possible moves: R to (4,3), D to (3,2), U to (3,4) but occupied, not safe.\n\nSo only R or D.\n\nIf I go R to (4,3), then I can be close to the food areas.\n\n(4,3) is free, as we said.\n\nFrom there, I can go to (4,4), but (4,4) is tail, so moving to (4,4) is safe because tail will move.\n\nAnd (4,4) has food, so if I move to (4,4), I eat the food, and length increases, tail doesn't move.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,5).\n\nBut let's think turn by turn.\n\nFirst, at turn 83, from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) instead.\n\nLet's consider both options.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the tail reward danger.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo if tail has food, and head is adjacent, eating it causes collision because after eating, tail doesn't move, so head is on food cell, and the new tail is added, but since head was adjacent, it might be that the new tail is where head was, causing collision.\n\nFor example, if head is at A, tail at B with food, and A and B are adjacent. If head moves to B to eat food, then after eating, head is at B, and a new tail segment is added at the previous tail position, but since tail was at B, and head moves to B, the new snake has head at B, and the segment that was tail is now the second last, and a new segment is added at the old tail position, but it's messy.\n\nThe rule says: eating when head adjacent to tail with food causes death because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nSpecifically, after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the cell that was tail now has the head, and a new segment is added where the tail was, but since head moved to tail, it's the same cell, so head is on the food cell, and the new segment is added at the previous position of the tail, which is now occupied by head, so it's confused.\n\nPerhaps it's that after moving to the food cell, head is there, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, but tail position is where the tail was before move, and if head was adjacent, after move, the new segment might be adjacent to head causing collision.\n\nLet's not worry for now.\n\nIn this case, currently, tail is at (4,3), head at (2,3), not adjacent, so no immediate danger.\n\nBack to moves.\n\nOption A: at turn 83, move R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 84, from (3,3), I can move R to (4,3)\n\nAt (4,3), no food, so just move, tail moves.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), new head (4,3), body: old positions shifted, tail at (4,4) moves? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 83 move to (3,3), positions as above: head (3,3), tail (4,4)\n\nThen turn 84, move to (4,3): (4,3) is free, no food, so new head (4,3), new body: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) and tail (4,4) removed, so new tail is (3,4)? Positions: old head (3,3) becomes body, old body (2,3) becomes next, ..., up to old body (3,4) which was index 13 or something, but in list: after turn 83, positions: [ (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nIndex 0: (3,3) head\n\n1: (2,3)\n\n2: (1,3)\n\n3: (1,4)\n\n4: (1,5)\n\n5: (2,5)\n\n6: (2,6)\n\n7: (3,6)\n\n8: (4,6)\n\n9: (5,6)\n\n10: (5,5)\n\n11: (4,5)\n\n12: (3,5)\n\n13: (3,4)\n\n14: (4,4) tail\n\nMove to (4,3): new head (4,3)\n\nNew body: old positions 0 to 13 shifted: so new body 1 at old head (3,3)\n\nNew body 2 at old body 1 (2,3)\n\n...\n\nNew body 14 at old body 13 (3,4)\n\nAnd old tail (4,4) removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]  // tail at (3,4)\n\nNow, (4,4) is free, and it has food, so I can move to (4,4) from (4,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), direction is R (since moved right), so can move U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3) but occupied, or R to (5,3) but x=5, y=3, is it free? Walls: not border, not internal obstacle, so free.\n\nBut (3,3) is body, so moving L not allowed and occupied.\n\nU to (4,4): (4,4) has food and is free now.\n\nIf I move U to (4,4), I eat the food.\n\nThen, since food eaten, tail does not move, so new segment added at tail position.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,4), and a new segment added at the previous tail position, which is (3,4).\n\nSo new positions: head (4,4), then body includes (4,3), (3,3), etc., and new tail at (3,4)? Let's see.\n\nPrevious positions before move: [ (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ] tail at (3,4)\n\nMove to (4,4): food eaten, so head to (4,4), tail does not move, new segment added at tail position, so the tail segment stays, and a new segment is added there.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), then the previous head (4,3) becomes first body, previous body (3,3) becomes next, ..., up to previous tail (3,4) which remains, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position (3,4), but since it's the same, it's like the tail doesn't move, and length increases.\n\nSo new snake: [ (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]  // 16 segments, tail at (3,4)\n\nNow, the food at (4,4) is eaten.\n\nLife span was 4, eaten on turn 84 or 85? Let's see turns.\n\nTurn 83: move to (3,3)\n\nTurn 84: move to (4,3)\n\nTurn 85: move to (4,4) and eat food.\n\nOn turn 85, head moves to (4,4), which has countdown: at turn 83, countdown 4, turn 84 countdown 3, turn 85 countdown 2, so still there, can be eaten.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there tail reward danger? Head at (4,3), tail at (3,4), are they adjacent? (4,3) and (3,4) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing side, so (4,3) and (3,4) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent is up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (4,3) and (3,4) are not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,4), tail at (3,4), which are adjacent vertically? (4,4) and (3,4) share the same y, x differs by 1, so yes, adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut the danger is when eating, not after.\n\nThe rule is when head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, before eating, head at (4,3), tail at (3,4), not adjacent, so safe.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,4), tail at (3,4), adjacent, but no food on tail now, so ok.\n\nNow, similarly, I can try to eat (4,5) later.\n\nBut let's see the other food.\n\n(4,5) has life span 6, so more time.\n\n(1,6) is also there.\n\nBut from above, if I go this way, I can eat (4,4) on turn 85.\n\nNow, what about the other option at turn 83.\n\nIf at turn 83, I move D to (2,2) instead.\n\nThen from (2,3) to (2,2), no food, so new head (2,2), body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), etc., tail (4,3) removed, new tail at (4,4).\n\nPositions: old head (2,3) to body, etc.\n\nNew positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) ] tail at (4,4)\n\nThen from (2,2), direction down, so can move L to (1,2), but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nR to (3,2), which is free, as before.\n\nU to (2,3), but (2,3) is body, and moving up is opposite to down? Current direction D, so moving U opposite, not allowed.\n\nD to (2,1), but y=1, not border, but internal obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), not (2,1), so free? Walls: y=0 and y=7 border, so y=1 not border. Internal obstacles (1,2) but not (2,1), so (2,1) should be free. Snake positions no (2,1), so free.\n\nBut moving D to (2,1) might be ok, but let's see.\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: R to (3,2) or D to (2,1)\n\nIf I go R to (3,2), then I can go to (3,3), etc., but it might take more turns to reach the food.\n\nFor example, to go to (4,4), from (2,2) to (3,2) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,4), that's 4 moves from turn 83, so turn 87, but (4,4) disappears after turn 86, so on turn 87 it's gone, cannot eat.\n\nTurn 83: move to (2,2)\n\nTurn 84: say to (3,2)\n\nTurn 85: to (3,3)\n\nTurn 86: to (4,3)\n\nTurn 87: to (4,4) but on turn 87, (4,4) food gone, since life span 4, after turn 86 disappeared.\n\nCountdown: turn 83:4, 84:3, 85:2, 86:1, disappears after turn 86, so not on turn 87.\n\nSo if I go down to (2,2) at turn 83, I cannot reach (4,4) in time to eat it; the earliest I can be at (4,4) is turn 87, too late.\n\nWhereas if I go right to (3,3) at turn 83, then to (4,3) at 84, to (4,4) at 85, just in time.\n\nSimilarly, going down delays me.\n\nTherefore, at turn 83, moving R to (3,3) is better to reach the food quickly.\n\nMoreover, (4,4) has short life, so prioritize.\n\nNow, about the other food (4,5) and (1,6).\n\n(4,5) has longer life, life span 6, so until turn 88.\n\nAfter eating (4,4), I can go for (4,5).\n\nCurrently, (4,5) is occupied by body, but after some moves, it might be free.\n\nIn the sequence above, after eating (4,4) on turn 85, head at (4,4), tail at (3,4).\n\nFrom (4,4), direction: after moving U to (4,4), direction is U, so up.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,5), but (4,5) has food and is occupied? After eating (4,4), positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), ..., (3,5), (3,4) tail.\n\n(4,5) is in the positions? In the list: after eating at (4,4), positions include (4,5)? No, from above: [ (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ] so (4,5) is a body segment, index 13? Head (4,4), index 1: (4,3), 2: (3,3), ..., let's list indices:\n\n0: (4,4) head\n\n1: (4,3)\n\n2: (3,3)\n\n3: (2,3)\n\n4: (1,3)\n\n5: (1,4)\n\n6: (1,5)\n\n7: (2,5)\n\n8: (2,6)\n\n9: (3,6)\n\n10: (4,6)\n\n11: (5,6)\n\n12: (5,5)\n\n13: (4,5)  // body\n\n14: (3,5)\n\n15: (3,4) tail\n\nSo (4,5) is occupied by body, and has food, but under snake.\n\nTo eat it, need to move away and head to it.\n\nFrom head (4,4), direction up.\n\nCan move: U to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n\nR to (5,4): is (5,4) free? Walls: internal (6,4), but (5,4) not listed, not border, so free. Snake positions: (5,5), (5,6), but not (5,4), so free.\n\nD to (4,3): but (4,3) is body segment, index 1, so occupied.\n\nL to (3,4): (3,4) is tail, so can move there since tail will move.\n\nMoving to tail is safe.\n\nNow, if I move L to (3,4), which is tail, and no food there, so just move, tail moves away.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), new head (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), etc., and tail (3,5)? Positions before move: [ (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]\n\nMove to (3,4): (3,4) is tail, no food? (3,4) has no food, food is at (4,5) etc.\n\n(3,4) is not food, so no food eaten.\n\nNew head (3,4), new body: old head (4,4) to body, old body (4,3) to next, ..., up to old body (3,5), and old tail (3,4) removed? Old tail is (3,4), but head moving to (3,4), so it's the same cell.\n\nMoving to tail cell: since tail will move, it's safe, and no food.\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), then body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)  // old (3,5) becomes new tail? Old positions: index 0:(4,4), 1:(4,3), 2:(3,3), 3:(2,3), 4:(1,3), 5:(1,4), 6:(1,5), 7:(2,5), 8:(2,6), 9:(3,6), 10:(4,6), 11:(5,6), 12:(5,5), 13:(4,5), 14:(3,5), 15:(3,4) tail\n\nMove to (3,4): new head (3,4), new body: old 0 to 14 except tail is removed, but since moving to tail, new body is old positions from 0 to 14, shifted.\n\nNew body 1 at old head (4,4)\n\nNew body 2 at old body 1 (4,3)\n\n...\n\nNew body 15 at old body 14 (3,5)\n\nAnd old tail (3,4) removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nNow (4,5) is still occupied by body.\n\nBut I vacated (3,4), etc.\n\nNot helping to free (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,4), better to move R to (5,4) or something.\n\nAfter eating (4,4) at turn 85, head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nI can move R to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is free, as we said.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,5), but (5,5) has body? In positions, (5,5) is index 12, body segment.\n\n(5,5) is occupied.\n\nBut it has no food, I think.\n\nFood is at (4,5), not (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is body.\n\nSo from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), but (5,5) is body, collision.\n\nD to (5,3), etc.\n\nNot directly helpful.\n\nTo eat (4,5), I need to move the body away from it.\n\nSince the snake is long, and (4,5) is a body segment, as the snake moves, eventually the body will move away, but it might take time.\n\nLife span of (4,5) is 6, so until turn 88, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) at (1,6) is free and has food.\n\nBut head is at (4,4) after turn 85, (1,6) is far, and snake is long, might be risky to go back.\n\nMoreover, there are obstacles.\n\nBut let's first confirm the initial move.\n\nAt turn 83, moving R to (3,3) seems best to get the (4,4) food.\n\nThen at turn 84, move R to (4,3)\n\nThen at turn 85, move U to (4,4) to eat.\n\nNow, for turn 86 onwards.\n\nAfter turn 85, head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nNow, I need to think about (4,5) food.\n\n(4,5) is currently occupied by body, index 13 in the list above.\n\nAs the snake moves, it will eventually be vacated.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the snake progresses.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move R to (5,4), which is free.\n\nThen at turn 86, move to (5,4)\n\nNo food at (5,4), so just move.\n\nPositions before: after turn 85, head (4,4), body as above.\n\nAfter move to (5,4): new head (5,4), new body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), ..., up to (3,5), tail (3,4) removed? Positions: [ (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]\n\nMove to (5,4): new head (5,4), new body: old head (4,4) to body, old body (4,3) to next, ..., old body (3,5) to body, and old tail (3,4) removed.\n\nNew positions: [ (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nNow (4,5) is still occupied, but now it's the second last segment? Index 14: (4,5), index 15: (3,5) tail.\n\nWhen tail moves, (4,5) might be vacated soon.\n\nFrom (5,4), direction R (moved right).\n\nCan move R to (6,4), but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nU to (5,5), but (5,5) is body, index 13 in new list? New positions: head (5,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), ..., (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) tail.\n\n(5,5) is body segment, so occupied, cannot move there.\n\nD to (5,3): (5,3) free? Walls: not border, internal (5,1) but not (5,3), so free. Snake no, so free.\n\nL to (4,4), but (4,4) is body, and moving left opposite to R, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move: D to (5,3) or U to (5,5) but occupied, not possible, so only D to (5,3).\n\nMove D to (5,3).\n\nThen new head (5,3), etc.\n\nBut this might not help to free (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is currently at position, and as the snake moves, when the tail moves, it will be vacated.\n\nFor example, if I continue moving, in a few turns, the segment at (4,5) will move or be vacated.\n\nSpecifically, in the current state, (4,5) is occupied, and it will be part of the body moving towards tail.\n\nTo eat (4,5), I need head to be able to move there when it's free.\n\nSimilarly, I can go for (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), with life span 9, so until turn 91.\n\nIt might be easier to eat since it's not under snake.\n\nBut head is at (4,4) after turn 85, (1,6) is at left top.\n\nPath might be blocked.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), after some moves, I can go left.\n\nBut let's think about the grid.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), etc., so from (4,4) to (1,6), possible path, but snake body might be in the way.\n\nSince I need to plan 5+ turns ahead, and maximize score, eating (4,5) soon might be good.\n\nAfter turn 85, head at (4,4), I can move L to (3,4), which is tail, as before.\n\nIf I move L to (3,4) at turn 86.\n\nThen from there, as before, positions change.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move to (3,5), but (3,5) is tail or body.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), as in earlier calculation, tail at (3,5).\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move U to (3,5), which is tail, so safe, and if (3,5) has food? But no food there, so no eat.\n\nThen move to (3,5), tail moves.\n\nBut (4,5) is still occupied.\n\nNot helping.\n\nPerhaps I should move in a different direction from the beginning.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 83, instead of moving R, I could move D to (2,2), but we saw that I miss the (4,4) food, so not good.\n\nOr, from (2,3), only R and D possible, D leads to missing food.\n\nSo R is better.\n\nNow, about (1,6) food.\n\nIf I can eat (1,6), it might be good, but with the snake length, going back might cause self-collision.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), if I could go up, but up to (2,4) is wall, blocked.\n\nSo I have to go R or D.\n\nD is down, away from (1,6).\n\nSo probably, going R to reach (4,4) is the way.\n\nThen after eating (4,4), I can consider going towards (1,6) or to (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is under body, so need to free it.\n\nSince life span is longer, I can let it be for now and go for (1,6).\n\nLet's see if I can reach (1,6) in time.\n\nFrom turn 85, head at (4,4), to (1,6).\n\nDistance: delta x = -3, delta y = +2, so at least 5 moves, but with body, need path.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) move L to (3,4) or to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, etc.\n\nFrom (4,4), move L to (3,4) if possible, but direction is U, so after moving U to (4,4), direction U.\n\nFrom (4,4), direction U, I can move L to (3,4) as we said, since not opposite? Directions: from U, moving L is left, not opposite, opposite would be D.\n\nSo can move L to (3,4).\n\nThen from (3,4), can move L to (2,4), but (2,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nU to (3,5), etc.\n\nSo from (3,4), after moving L, direction L.\n\nThen can move U to (3,5), or D to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut to go to (1,6), from (4,4), I can go to (3,4), then to (3,5), but (3,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn positions after turn 85, (3,5) is body.\n\nThen to (2,5), (2,5) is body, etc.\n\nIt's messy.\n\nPerhaps I can go down and left.\n\nBut it might take many turns, and (1,6) has life span 9, from turn 83 to 91, so 8 turns left after turn 83, so by turn 91 I can eat.\n\nBut let's focus on the immediate plan.\n\nSince the food at (4,5) is on the body, and I can eat it when it's free, I should move in a way that the snake progresses and frees that cell.\n\nFor example, if I keep moving the head away, the tail will follow, and (4,5) will be vacated when it becomes the tail or something.\n\nIn the current body, (4,5) is not near tail; in the list, it's index 13, with 16 segments, so when the tail moves, it will take time.\n\nFor instance, in the state after turn 85, (4,5) is index 13, tail at (3,4), so (4,5) will move towards tail over time.\n\nAfter each move, it gets closer to tail.\n\nIn about 12 moves, it might be tail, but that might be too late for life span.\n\nLife span of (4,5) is 6 at turn 83, so disappears after turn 88.\n\nFrom turn 83 to 88, 5 turns: turn 84,85,86,87,88.\n\nOn turn 88, countdown 1, can be eaten, after turn 88 gone.\n\nSo from turn 83 to 88, 5 actions: turn 84 to 88.\n\nAfter turn 85, head at (4,4), then turn 86,87,88, three more turns.\n\nIn three turns, (4,5) may not be free yet.\n\nIn the positions after turn 85, (4,5) is index 13, and there are 16 segments, so the distance to tail is 3 segments (index 13,14,15 to tail).\n\nAs the snake moves, each move, the position moves closer to tail.\n\nAfter one move, say to (5,4), then (4,5) becomes index 12 or something, but it's the cell that matters.\n\nThe cell (4,5) is occupied by a body segment, and as the snake moves, that segment will move to a new position, and eventually, when that segment is the tail, it will be vacated.\n\nBut the food is on the cell, not on the segment.\n\nThe food is at cell (4,5), which is currently occupied by a body segment. When that body segment moves away, the cell is free, and if head moves there, it can eat.\n\nBut the segment moves when the snake moves, so after each move, the body segment at (4,5) will move to a different cell.\n\nFor example, in the state after turn 85, cell (4,5) is occupied by the segment that is there.\n\nWhen the snake moves, that segment will move to the position of the previous segment ahead, so it will leave (4,5), and the cell may be free if not occupied by another segment.\n\nSimilarly, the new position it moves to.\n\nSo after each move, the body segments shift, so cells are vacated.\n\nSpecifically for (4,5), after a move, the segment that was there moves to another cell, so (4,5) might be free, unless another segment moves to it, but in general, it becomes free.\n\nThen if head can move to it, it can eat.\n\nBut I need to know when it becomes free.\n\nIn the state after turn 85, positions include (4,5) at index 13.\n\nWhen I move the head to a new position, say at turn 86, if I move to (5,4), then new positions: as before, the segment that was at (4,5) moves to where the previous index 12 was, but it's complicated.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,4), the new body segments are at the old positions of the previous segments.\n\nOld position of index 12 is (5,5), so the segment that was at index 13 (4,5) moves to the old position of index 12, which is (5,5)? No.\n\nNew body segment 1 is at old head position (4,4)\n\nNew body segment 2 is at old body 1 position (4,3)\n\n...\n\nNew body segment 13 is at old body 12 position, which is (5,5) (since old index 12 is (5,5))\n\nOld index 12: (5,5)\n\nNew body segment 13 is at old position of index 12, (5,5)\n\nThen new body segment 14 is at old position of index 13, (4,5)\n\nNew body segment 15 is at old position of index 14, (3,5)\n\nTail at old position of index 15, (3,4)? Let's not.\n\nAfter move to (5,4), the cell (4,5) is now occupied by the segment that was at old index 13, but it has moved to a new position? No, the segment moves to a new cell.\n\nThe cell (4,5) is vacated because the segment that was there has moved to another cell.\n\nSpecifically, the segment at old index 13 (4,5) moves to the position that was old index 12, which is (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, the cell (4,5) is no longer occupied, so it is free, and the food is there, so if head moves to (4,5), it can eat.\n\nBut head is at (5,4), not at (4,5).\n\nAfter the move to (5,4), the cell (4,5) is free, but head is at (5,4), so I can move to (4,5) or (5,5) etc.\n\nFrom (5,4), after move, direction R.\n\nBut (5,5) is occupied by body, (4,5) is free.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), but (5,5) is body, collision.\n\nL to (4,4), but (4,4) is body, and moving left opposite to R, not allowed.\n\nD to (5,3), or R to (6,4) wall.\n\nSo only D to (5,3).\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), then head to (5,3), and (4,5) is free, but I'm not there.\n\nThen next turn, from (5,3), I can move to (4,3) or something, but not to (4,5) directly.\n\nSo I missed the opportunity to move to (4,5) at turn 86.\n\nAt turn 86, from (5,4), I couldn't move to (4,5) because it's not adjacent in a way I can move? (5,4) to (4,5) is diagonal, not adjacent; I can only move up, down, left, right.\n\nSo from (5,4), (4,5) is not adjacent, I can only go to (5,5), (5,3), (6,4), (4,4), but (6,4) wall, (4,4) body and not allowed, (5,5) body, so only (5,3).\n\nSo I have to move away.\n\nThen (4,5) is free, but I can't eat it immediately.\n\nLater, I might be able to.\n\nBut with life span, it might expire.\n\nLet's count turns.\n\nTurn 83: initial\n\nTurn 84: move to (4,3)\n\nTurn 85: move to (4,4) eat (4,4) food\n\nTurn 86: from (4,4) move to (5,4) as above\n\nThen cell (4,5) becomes free after this move, since the segment moves away.\n\nOn turn 86, after moving to (5,4), (4,5) is free with food.\n\nBut head is at (5,4), not adjacent to (4,5), so I can't move there directly.\n\nThen turn 87, from (5,4) I moved to (5,3), say.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move L to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, or D to (5,2), etc.\n\nNot to (4,5).\n\nTo reach (4,5) from (5,3), I need to go to (4,3) or (5,4) etc., but (4,3) is occupied.\n\nIt might take multiple turns, and by turn 88, it might be gone.\n\nLife span: turn 83 countdown 6, turn 84:5, turn 85:4, turn 86:3, turn 87:2, turn 88:1, after turn 88 gone.\n\nSo on turn 88, I can still eat if I am at (4,5).\n\nBut from turn 86 position, head at (5,4), then turn 87 to (5,3), then turn 88 to say (4,3) or something, not (4,5).\n\nFrom (5,4) at turn 86, if I could go to a cell adjacent to (4,5), but I can't from (5,4).\n\nSo probably, I cannot eat (4,5) easily.\n\nPerhaps at turn 86, from (4,4), instead of moving to (5,4), I move to (3,4) or other.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 85, after eating at (4,4), head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nI can move D to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, occupied, and moving down is opposite to up, not allowed.\n\nOnly possible moves are R to (5,4), L to (3,4), U to (4,5) occupied, not possible.\n\nSo only R or L.\n\nIf I move L to (3,4) at turn 86.\n\nThen as before, positions change, and (4,5) might be free or not.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), the cell (4,5) is still occupied, because the segment that was there didn't move away yet.\n\nIn positions after turn 85, index 13 is at (4,5).\n\nAfter moving head to (3,4), new positions: head (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), ..., (4,5), (3,5) tail.\n\nSo (4,5) is still occupied by body.\n\nNot free.\n\nThen it takes more moves.\n\nSo it seems difficult to eat (4,5) in time.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should not worry about (4,5) and go for (1,6) instead.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), free, with life span 9.\n\nFrom head at (4,4) after turn 85, I can navigate to (1,6).\n\nFor example, move left and up.\n\nBut there are obstacles and body.\n\nFrom (4,4) at turn 85, move L to (3,4) at turn 86.\n\nThen from (3,4), direction L, can move U to (3,5) or D to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,5) is body, occupied.\n\nMove D to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is body, but after move to (3,4), positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) is occupied.\n\nMove U to (3,5), occupied.\n\nMove L to (2,4), but (2,4) is wall, cannot.\n\nSo from (3,4), only possible moves: U to (3,5) occupied, D to (3,3) occupied, L to (2,4) wall, R to (4,4) body and opposite to L, not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction after moving L to (3,4) is L, so moving R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only U, D, L, but U and D occupied, L wall, so stuck? No, U to (3,5) is occupied, but (3,5) is body, so collision if I move there.\n\nSimilarly D to (3,3) body.\n\nL to (2,4) wall.\n\nSo no safe move from (3,4) if I go there.\n\nTherefore, moving L to (3,4) at turn 86 is dangerous because from there I have no safe move.\n\nTherefore, from (4,4) at turn 85, I must move R to (5,4) to avoid being trapped.\n\nThen from (5,4) at turn 86, move D to (5,3) as only choice.\n\nThen from (5,3) at turn 87, direction D, can move L to (4,3), R to (6,3), U to (5,4), or D to (5,2).\n\n(4,3) is body, (6,3) may be free, (5,4) is previous position, body, and moving U opposite to D, not allowed, (5,2) free.\n\nR to (6,3): (6,3) not wall? Internal obstacles (6,4), (6,1), not (6,3), so free. Snake no, so free.\n\nL to (4,3): (4,3) is body, occupied.\n\nU to (5,4): body and opposite, not allowed.\n\nD to (5,2): free.\n\nSo can move R to (6,3) or D to (5,2).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I need to plan the moves.\n\nFor the food at (1,6), I can go towards it.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), move L to (4,3) but occupied, not possible, so move R to (6,3) or D to (5,2).\n\nSay move to (6,3).\n\nThen from there, move to (6,2) or (6,4) but (6,4) wall, etc.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSince the grid is small, and snake long, I should focus on survival and eating when possible.\n\nBut (1,6) is there, and I can reach it in a few turns.\n\nFrom turn 87, head at (5,3), to (1,6), delta x=-4, delta y=3, so at least 7 moves, but with path.\n\nFor example, via (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) but (1,2) wall, so not, or via (4,3) but occupied.\n\nPath might be difficult.\n\nPerhaps it's better to ignore (1,6) for now and focus on the area.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating food is good.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating any is fine.\n\nBut with the constraints, I might not be able to eat all.\n\nFor the initial turns, let's output the moves to eat (4,4).\n\nSo for turn 83: move R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 84: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 85: move U to (4,4) eat food\n\nThen for turn 86, from (4,4) move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 87, from (5,4) move D to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 88, from (5,3) I can move R to (6,3) or D to (5,2), say R to (6,3)\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 88 or more.\n\nTurn t1=83, so plan for 83,84,85,86,87,88 at least.\n\nBut after turn 88, I can continue.\n\nSince the food (4,5) might not be eaten, and (1,6) is far, I can just keep moving safely.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) at turn 87, move to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 88, from (6,3) direction R (if moved right), can move U to (6,4) but wall, D to (6,2), L to (5,3) body or opposite, not allowed, R to (7,3) but x=7 wall.\n\nSo only D to (6,2)\n\nThen from (6,2), move to (6,1) but (6,1) wall, or (5,2), or (6,3) body, etc.\n\n(6,1) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nSo from (6,2), can move D to (6,1) wall, not; U to (6,3) body; L to (5,2); R to (7,2) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,2)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I need to output the moves for the next turns.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can plan the first few moves to eat the food and then move safely.\n\nSince the problem asks to think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide moves for turns 83 to 87 or 88.\n\nLet's list the moves.\n\nTurn 83: R (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 84: R (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 85: U (to (4,4) eat)\n\nThen turn 86: from (4,4) move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 87: from (5,4) move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 88: from (5,3) move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 89: from (6,3) move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 90: from (6,2) move L to (5,2)\n\netc.\n\nBut this is just one way.\n\nI could at turn 86 from (4,4) move L to (3,4), but earlier I saw that from (3,4) I might be trapped, so not good.\n\nMove U to (4,5) not possible.\n\nSo only R to (5,4) is safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nFor the food at (1,6), I can try to go there after, but it might be risky.\n\nSince life span is long, I can plan to eat it later.\n\nBut for now, let's output the moves.\n\nAlso, in the state, there is food at (4,5) and (1,6), but I may not eat them in this plan.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so if possible, eat them.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 83, if I move D to (2,2), I can go to (1,6) faster.\n\nFor example, turn 83: D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 84: R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 85: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 86: U to (3,4)\n\nBut (3,4) may be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 83, after move to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) tail\n\nThen turn 84 move to (3,2): new head (3,2), body (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), etc., tail (4,4) removed, new tail (4,5)? Positions: new [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ] tail at (3,4)\n\nThen turn 85 move to (3,3): (3,3) free? Not occupied, not wall, so move, no food. New head (3,3), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), etc., tail (3,5)? New positions: [ (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nThen turn 86 move U to (3,4): (3,4) is free? In positions, not occupied, not wall, so move. New head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), etc., tail (4,5)? New positions: [ (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ] tail at (4,5)\n\n(4,5) has food, and is tail now.\n\nHead at (3,4), tail at (4,5), are they adjacent? (3,4) and (4,5) diagonal, not adjacent.\n\nThen turn 87, from (3,4) can move to (3,5) or (2,4) but (2,4) wall, or (4,4), or (3,3).\n\n(3,5) is free? Not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\nMove to (3,5): no food, so move, tail moves.\n\nBut to eat (1,6), from (3,4), move L to (2,4) wall, not possible.\n\nMove U to (3,5), then from (3,5) move U to (3,6), but (3,6) is body, occupied.\n\nIn positions, (3,6) is body.\n\nSo not easy.\n\nFrom (3,4) move to (4,4), which is free, no food.\n\nThen to (4,5), but (4,5) is tail with food.\n\nIf I move to (4,5) from (4,4), I can eat it.\n\nBut head at (3,4), tail at (4,5), not adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,4) move to (4,4) at turn 87.\n\n(4,4) free, move to it, no food.\n\nNew head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), etc., tail (5,5)? Positions before: [ (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nMove to (4,4): new head (4,4), new body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) and tail (4,5) removed, so new tail (5,5)\n\n(4,5) is free with food.\n\nThen from (4,4), can move U to (4,5) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 88.\n\nLife span of (4,5) at turn 83:6, turn 84:5, 85:4, 86:3, 87:2, 88:1, so on turn 88 can eat.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd head at (4,4), move U to (4,5) eat.\n\nBut in this path, I didn't eat the (4,4) food because I went down first.\n\nIn this case, at turn 83 I moved D, so I missed (4,4) but can eat (4,5) on turn 88.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) disappeared after turn 86.\n\nBut in the first path, I ate (4,4) on turn 85.\n\nBoth are possible, but in the first path, I ate one food, in this path, I can eat (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) has the same value.\n\nIn the first path, after eating (4,4), I might not eat (4,5), but in this path, I eat (4,5).\n\nAlso, (1,6) is still there.\n\nBut for score, eating one food is similar.\n\nBut in the first path, with move R at turn 83, I ate (4,4), and snake is longer, but in this path, I ate (4,5), same.\n\nBut in the D move at turn 83, I can also go to (1,6) potentially.\n\nFor example, after eating (4,5) at turn 88, head at (4,5), then I can go to (1,6).\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nFor the initial choice, moving R at turn 83 allows me to eat (4,4) quickly, which has short life, so it's better to eat it rather than risk it disappearing.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) has longer life, so I can eat it later if possible.\n\nIn the first plan, I can still try to eat (4,5) or (1,6).\n\nBut from the positions, it might be tight.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll go with the first plan to eat (4,4).\n\nSo moves:\n\nTurn 83: R\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nThen for turn 86: from (4,4) move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 87: from (5,4) move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 88: from (5,3) move R to (6,3)  (assuming (6,3) free)\n\nThen turn 89: from (6,3) move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 90: from (6,2) move L to (5,2)\n\nBut I need to output for the current turn and next, but the format is to list actions for turn t1 and subsequent.\n\nSince t1=83, list from turn 83.\n\nAlso, for the box.\n\nSo for 5 turns: turns 83,84,85,86,87.\n\nOr more.\n\nBut let's do 5 moves.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 83: R\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: R  (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 87: D  (to (5,3))\n\nThen for turn 88, it's beyond, but I can add if needed, but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so at least 5 actions.\n\n5 actions from turn 83: 83,84,85,86,87.\n\nThat should be fine.\n\nTo be safe, I can include up to 88.\n\nBut I think 5 is enough.\n\nIn the state, there is food at (1,6) with long life, so after these moves, I can head towards it.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide the moves.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (4,4) due to its short remaining life span (4 turns, disappearing after turn 86). The food at (4,5) has a longer life span (6 turns, disappearing after turn 88), and (1,6) has an even longer life span (9 turns, disappearing after turn 91), so they can be targeted later if feasible. The immediate plan focuses on safely reaching and eating (4,4) by turn 85, avoiding collisions and considering the snake's body and obstacles.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Current Head Position and Direction**: Head at (2,3), moving right (R). Possible moves from (2,3) are R to (3,3), U to (2,4), or D to (2,2). U is blocked by a wall at (2,4), so only R and D are valid.\n- **Food at (4,4)**: Occupied by the snake's body but can be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. Life span 4 means it must be eaten by turn 86. Moving R immediately allows reaching it by turn 85.\n- **Food at (4,5)**: Also under the body; eating it requires freeing the cell first. Life span 6 allows more time (until turn 88), but it may not be reachable within the plan due to body occupation and movement constraints.\n- **Food at (1,6)**: Free and accessible, but far from the current position. With a long life span, it can be targeted after handling the urgent (4,4) food.\n- **Collision Risks**: Must avoid walls, body segments (except the tail), and tail reward danger (not an issue here as head and tail are not adjacent).\n- **Movement Constraints**: No instant reverse. From (2,3), moving L is invalid (opposite direction and occupied). After moves, new directions must be respected.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: The plan covers turns 83 to 87 (5 turns) to eat (4,4) by turn 85, then position for potential future moves. Thinking ahead shows that (4,5) is difficult to eat by turn 88 due to body occupation, so the focus is on survival and (1,6) later.\n\n### Step-by-Step Move Plan:\n1. **Turn 83 (current turn)**: Move R to (3,3).  \n   - Why: From (2,3), moving R avoids the wall at (2,4) and positions closer to (4,4). Moving D to (2,2) would delay reaching (4,4), risking its disappearance. (3,3) is free and safe.\n   - New state: Head at (3,3), direction R. Snake body shifts; tail now at (4,4) (food cell occupied).\n\n2. **Turn 84**: Move R to (4,3).  \n   - Why: From (3,3), moving R continues toward (4,4). (4,3) is the previous tail cell, safe to enter as the tail moves. (4,4) food is now under the new tail.\n   - New state: Head at (4,3), direction R. Body shifts; (4,4) is free with food (body moved away).\n\n3. **Turn 85**: Move U to (4,4) to eat the food.  \n   - Why: From (4,3), moving U eats the food at (4,4), increasing length by 1. Life span allows eating (countdown 2 on turn 85). Head and tail were not adjacent, so no tail reward danger. Other moves (e.g., R to (5,3)) avoid food and are less efficient.\n   - New state: Head at (4,4), direction U. Food eaten; snake length increases to 16. Tail at (3,4).\n\n4. **Turn 86**: Move R to (5,4).  \n   - Why: From (4,4), direction U, moving R avoids body collisions. (5,4) is free (not wall or body). Moving L to (3,4) risks trapping (no safe moves from there). (4,5) is occupied and not directly reachable.\n   - New state: Head at (5,4), direction R. Body shifts; (4,5) becomes free with food, but head not adjacent.\n\n5. **Turn 87**: Move D to (5,3).  \n   - Why: From (5,4), direction R, moving D is the only safe option. (5,5) is body, (6,4) is wall, and L to (4,4) is body and opposite direction. (5,3) is free and safe. This move avoids risks and positions for future exploration toward (1,6).\n   - New state: Head at (5,3), direction D. (4,5) food remains but may not be eaten by turn 88; (1,6) is a future target.\n\n### Beyond Turn 87:\n- **Food at (4,5)**: Unlikely to be eaten by turn 88 due to distance and body constraints, but if possible, move toward it from (5,3) via (4,3) or similar (requires freeing cell first).\n- **Food at (1,6)**: With life span until turn 91, navigate left and up from (5,3) via safe cells (e.g., (5,2), (4,2), etc.), avoiding obstacles like (1,2) and body segments.\n- **Survival Priority**: Continue moving to open areas, ensuring no dead ends. For example, from (5,3), move to (6,3) or (5,2) on turn 88, etc.\n\nThis plan eats one food (+1 score) and ensures survival for at least 5 turns, with potential to eat more food long-term.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 83: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 84: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 85: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 86: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 87: D (down)\n}",

The body segments follow: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4). Let me list all positions in order:\n\n1. Head: (3,3)\n\n2. (2,3)\n\n3. (1,3)\n\n4. (1,4)\n\n5. (1,5)\n\n6. (2,5)\n\n7. (2,6)\n\n8. (3,6)\n\n9. (4,6)\n\n10. (5,6)\n\n11. (5,5)\n\n12. (4,5)\n\n13. (3,5)\n\n14. (3,4)\n\n15. (4,4)\n\nThe snake has 15 segments. That's important for growth and movement.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (4,4) with value 1 and life span 3 turns? Wait, the format says: (x,y, life_span, value). Let me check.\n\nIt says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 4, 3, 1)\" so that should be (x,y, life_span, value). So for (4,4): x=4, y=4, life_span=3, value=1.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5,5,1): x=4,y=5, life_span=5, value=1\n\n(1,6,8,1): x=1,y=6, life_span=8, value=1\n\nAll food has value +1? But there might be negative food, but here all are positive since value=1.\n\nValue=1 for all, and positive, so all are good food.\n\nLife spans: (4,4) has life 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including current turn? Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (4,4), life_span=3, so on turn 84, it has 3 turns left, including turn 84. After turn 84, it will have 2 left, and so on, until turn 86, it will be gone after that turn? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". So, if life_span=N, it appears for N turns, from the turn it's spawned until after N-1 more turns? I need to be careful.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor example, if a food has life_span=3 on turn t, then on turn t, countdown=3; turn t+1, countdown=2; turn t+2, countdown=1; turn t+3, it disappears, so it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, t+2.\n\nSimilarly here, on turn 84:\n\n- Food at (4,4): life_span=3, so can be eaten on turns 84, 85, 86. Disappears after turn 86.\n\n- Food at (4,5): life_span=5, can be eaten on turns 84 to 88.\n\n- Food at (1,6): life_span=8, can be eaten on turns 84 to 91.\n\nAll have value +1, so eating any grows the snake by 1.\n\nNow, special case: food can spawn under snake body. Here, look at food positions.\n\nFood at (4,4): but snake has a segment at (4,4). From the snake positions, (4,4) is the 15th segment, the tail? Let's see the list:\n\nSnake positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4). So (4,4) is the last position, the tail.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,5): (4,5) is also a snake segment, position 12: (4,5)\n\nAnd food at (1,6): (1,6) is not in snake positions? Snake has (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,6). (1,6) is free? Let's check.\n\nSnake positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), then (2,5), (2,6), etc. So (1,6) is not occupied by snake. Is it a wall? Walls are borders and internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,6) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nBorders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,6) is within bounds.\n\nSo food at (1,6) is on an empty cell.\n\nBut food at (4,4) and (4,5) are under snake body segments.\n\nSpecifically, (4,4) is the tail, and (4,5) is another body segment.\n\nRule for eating food under body: it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSince the snake moves, the tail will move when the snake advances, unless it eats food.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nNow, head is at (3,3), moving right.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is R (right), I can move U, D, R, but not L, because L would be opposite direction, which is not allowed? Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left on this turn.\n\nSo from (3,3), I can go to:\n\n- U: (3,4)\n\n- D: (3,2)\n\n- R: (4,3)\n\n- L: (2,3) but (2,3) is occupied by the second segment, and also L is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nCannot move opposite, so L is invalid.\n\nNow, let's see what cells are occupied or dangerous.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells by snake: the positions given.\n\nAlso walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo forbidden cells: walls and snake body except tail can be moved into if tail moves, but with caution.\n\nWhen moving, head cannot collide with body segments except that it can move to the current tail position because the tail will move forward, so the cell is free after move.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut only if the snake doesn't eat food, because if it eats, tail doesn't move, it grows.\n\nSo if head moves to tail, and there is no food, it's ok, no collision.\n\nIf there is food on tail and head moves to it, it might be dangerous.\n\nNow, in this case, tail is at (4,4), and there is food on (4,4), value +1.\n\nHead is at (3,3), which is not adjacent to (4,4). Adjacent cells to head (3,3) are:\n\n- Up: (3,4)\n\n- Down: (3,2)\n\n- Left: (2,3) but occupied and invalid move\n\n- Right: (4,3)\n\nNow, (3,4) is a body segment? Snake positions: (3,4) is the 14th segment? Positions: 1:(3,3), 2:(2,3), 3:(1,3), 4:(1,4), 5:(1,5), 6:(2,5), 7:(2,6), 8:(3,6), 9:(4,6), 10:(5,6), 11:(5,5), 12:(4,5), 13:(3,5), 14:(3,4), 15:(4,4)\n\nSo (3,4) is position 14, which is not the tail; tail is (4,4).\n\n(3,4) is a body segment, so moving to (3,4) would collide with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3): is it occupied? Let's see, (4,3) not in snake positions? Positions: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4). No (4,3), so free? But is it wall or obstacle?\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,3) is within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — not (4,3), so (4,3) should be free.\n\n(3,2): similarly, not in snake, not wall, should be free.\n\nBut (3,2) is down from head.\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,3):\n\n- U: (3,4) — but occupied by snake body (segment 14), so collision if move there.\n\n- D: (3,2) — seems free\n\n- R: (4,3) — seems free\n\n- L: invalid, opposite direction and occupied.\n\nSo only D and R are possible moves? U is occupied, L invalid.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nI should sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, cannot go there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — these are also walls.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (3,3)\n\nBody: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)\n\nFood: (4,4) under tail, (4,5) under segment 12, and (1,6) free.\n\nNow, for head at (3,3), moving to:\n\n- Up: (3,4) — this is occupied by the snake's 14th segment, (3,4), so if I move there, head collides with body, death. Not possible.\n\n- Down: (3,2) — let's see, y=2, x=3. Is it wall? Borders: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,2) is not border. Internal obstacles: not listed, so free. Snake: not occupied, so safe to move? But after move, the snake moves, so positions change.\n\nWhen I move, the head goes to new position, and each segment moves to previous position, tail moves away if no eat.\n\nBut for collision, at the moment of move, if new head position is body or wall, die.\n\nHere, (3,4) is body, so cannot go up.\n\n- Right: (4,3) — x=4,y=3. Not border, not internal obstacle (internal: (6,4), etc., not (4,3)), not snake body, so free. Safe.\n\n- Left: (2,3) — but this is the second segment, occupied, and also opposite direction, invalid.\n\nSo only Down or Right are possible moves.\n\nNow, food considerations.\n\nThere is food at (4,4), which is the current tail. If I can get the head to (4,4) when the tail moves away, but tail moves only if no food eaten.\n\nBut (4,4) has food, so if I eat it, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and new tail is added, but since head is on (4,4), and it eats, it grows, so the segment that was tail stays, and new head is there, but it becomes part of body, so collision? Rule for tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, the head is on the food cell, and the new tail is added, but since it was tail, and head moves to it, the new tail is where the head was, but let's think.\n\nThe rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, head is at (3,3), tail at (4,4). Are they adjacent? (3,3) and (4,4) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (3,3) and (4,4) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. Adjacent cells would be (3,4), (4,3), (3,2), (2,3) for (3,3).\n\n(4,4) is not adjacent to (3,3); it's diagonal. So head is not adjacent to tail, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut food is on tail, so to eat it, I need head to move to (4,4) when it's free.\n\nBut currently, tail is there, so I need the body to move away.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5), food under body segment.\n\nNow, back to moves: I can go D to (3,2) or R to (4,3).\n\nI need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's see the consequences of each move.\n\nIf I go Right to (4,3):\n\nNew head position: (4,3)\n\nThen the snake moves: head to (4,3), segment 1 (old head) becomes body at (3,3), segment 2 was (2,3) moves to (3,3)? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo positions shift: new positions: head: (4,3), then body: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) — and tail was (4,4), but since no food eaten, tail moves to where segment 14 was, which is (3,4)? Let's index.\n\nOld positions:\n\n1: (3,3) head\n\n2: (2,3)\n\n3: (1,3)\n\n4: (1,4)\n\n5: (1,5)\n\n6: (2,5)\n\n7: (2,6)\n\n8: (3,6)\n\n9: (4,6)\n\n10: (5,6)\n\n11: (5,5)\n\n12: (4,5)\n\n13: (3,5)\n\n14: (3,4)\n\n15: (4,4) tail\n\nAfter move right to (4,3):\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nThen body segments:\n\nSegment 1 (was head) becomes body at (3,3)\n\nSegment 2 moves to where segment 1 was: (3,3) — but (3,3) is now occupied by new body? No.\n\nAfter head moves to new position, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the old list.\n\nSo new segment 2: position of old segment 1: (3,3)\n\nNew segment 3: position of old segment 2: (2,3)\n\nNew segment 4: position of old segment 3: (1,3)\n\nNew segment 5: position of old segment 4: (1,4)\n\nNew segment 6: position of old segment 5: (1,5)\n\nNew segment 7: position of old segment 6: (2,5)\n\nNew segment 8: position of old segment 7: (2,6)\n\nNew segment 9: position of old segment 8: (3,6)\n\nNew segment 10: position of old segment 9: (4,6)\n\nNew segment 11: position of old segment 10: (5,6)\n\nNew segment 12: position of old segment 11: (5,5)\n\nNew segment 13: position of old segment 12: (4,5)\n\nNew segment 14: position of old segment 13: (3,5)\n\nNew segment 15: position of old segment 14: (3,4)  // tail\n\nOld tail at (4,4) is not occupied anymore, since segment 14 moved to (3,5)? New segment 15 is at (3,4), which was old segment 14.\n\nThe cell (4,4) is now free because tail moved away.\n\nBut there is food at (4,4), so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nIn this move, head is at (4,3), not (4,4).\n\nAfter move to (4,3), new head is (4,3), and tail is at (3,4).\n\nFood at (4,4) is still there, life span decreases to 2.\n\nIf I go down to (3,2):\n\nNew head: (3,2)\n\nNew body: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) and tail at (4,4)? Let's see.\n\nAfter move down to (3,2):\n\nNew head: (3,2)\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1: (3,3)\n\nNew segment 3: old segment 2: (2,3)\n\nNew segment 4: old segment 3: (1,3)\n\nNew segment 5: old segment 4: (1,4)\n\nNew segment 6: old segment 5: (1,5)\n\nNew segment 7: old segment 6: (2,5)\n\nNew segment 8: old segment 7: (2,6)\n\nNew segment 9: old segment 8: (3,6)\n\nNew segment 10: old segment 9: (4,6)\n\nNew segment 11: old segment 10: (5,6)\n\nNew segment 12: old segment 11: (5,5)\n\nNew segment 13: old segment 12: (4,5)\n\nNew segment 14: old segment 13: (3,5)\n\nNew segment 15: old segment 14: (3,4)  // tail\n\nTail at (3,4), and (4,4) is free but with food.\n\nNow, back to turn 84, I need to choose between D and R.\n\nIf I go R to (4,3), I am closer to the food at (4,4) and (4,5).\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), which is adjacent to (4,3) right? (4,3) to (4,4) is up, but y-coordinates: (4,3) to (4,4) is north, up.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) to (4,5) is two steps up.\n\nAlso, food at (1,6) is far.\n\nIf I go D to (3,2), I am moving away from the foods.\n\nBut (4,4) food has only 3 turns life, so it might disappear soon.\n\nI need to think long term.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 15 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nLet me map the grid.\n\nGrid:\n\ny=7: row 7\n\ny=6: (2,6) snake, (3,6) snake, (4,6) snake, (5,6) snake\n\ny=5: (1,5) snake, (2,5) snake, (5,5) snake, (4,5) snake, (3,5) snake\n\ny=4: (1,4) snake, (3,4) snake, (4,4) snake tail, and food at (4,4), and obstacle at (2,4)? Internal obstacle (2,4), so (2,4) is wall.\n\nAlso (6,4) wall.\n\ny=3: (1,3) snake, (2,3) snake, (3,3) head, (4,3) free? After move.\n\nBut now, at turn 84, y=3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) head\n\ny=2: free except possible walls? No walls at y=2 except borders, but y=2 not border.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,1), (1,2), (6,1), etc.\n\n(1,2) is wall, so (1,2) cannot be moved to.\n\ny=1: walls at (5,1), (6,1), and borders.\n\ny=0: border.\n\nNow, from (3,3), going down to (3,2): (3,2) is free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,1), but (3,1) is free? y=1, not border, internal obstacles (5,1) and (6,1), so (3,1) should be free.\n\nOr to (2,2), (4,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,2): is it free? Not snake, not wall. Walls: (1,2) is obstacle, so (2,2) is free? x=2,y=2. Internal obstacles: (1,2), but not (2,2), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) free.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nIf I go right to (4,3), from there I can go up to (4,4), but (4,4) has food and is currently occupied, but after this move, as we saw, tail moves to (3,4), so (4,4) is free with food.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3) on turn 84, new positions: head (4,3), body (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nFood at (4,4) is still there, and now (4,4) is adjacent to head (4,3)? (4,3) and (4,4) are adjacent vertically.\n\nSo on turn 85, from (4,3), I can move up to (4,4) to eat the food.\n\nBut (4,4) has food, and if I move there, I eat it, snake grows.\n\nBut is there tail reward danger? Tail is at (3,4), which is adjacent to (4,4)? (3,4) and (4,4) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nHead at (4,3), tail at (3,4). Are they adjacent? (4,3) and (3,4) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means same row or column, differing by one in x or y.\n\n(4,3) and (3,4): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so not adjacent; it's diagonal.\n\nSo head and tail are not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n\nIf I move up to (4,4) on turn 85, I eat the food at (4,4), which is positive, so snake grows.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (4,4), and a new segment is added where the tail was or something.\n\nWhen snake eats food, it grows, so the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position of the old tail, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and the new segment is added there.\n\nStandard snake growth: when you eat, the head moves to the food, and a new body segment is added to the tail, so the tail position remains, and the snake grows by one.\n\nIn terms of positions, after eating, the head is at the food cell, and the tail stays where it is, but since a new segment is added, the tail becomes the new segment.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that the tail doesn't move when eating.\n\nFor example, before move, positions: head at A, tail at Z.\n\nIf no eat, head moves to B, tail moves to Y (the previous segment).\n\nIf eat, head moves to B (food), tail stays at Z, and a new segment is added at Z, so Z is now part of body, and the new tail is still Z, but the segment that was tail remains, and a new one is added? I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard: when snake eats, on the move, head moves to the food cell, and instead of the tail moving away, the tail stays, so the snake gains one segment.\n\nSo the new positions: head at food cell, body includes all old positions plus the new head, but the tail segment is not removed.\n\nLet's think: old positions: segments 1 to L.\n\nAfter move with no eat: head to new position, segments 2 to L move to positions 1 to L-1, segment L (tail) is removed.\n\nAfter move with eat: head to new position (food), segments 1 to L move to positions 2 to L+1, and segment 1 (old head) becomes body, so new segments: head at food, then old segment 1, old segment 2, ..., old segment L, so the tail is old segment L, same position as before? No.\n\nPositions: new head at food cell.\n\nThen new segment 2: old head position\n\nNew segment 3: old segment 2 position\n\n...\n\nNew segment L+1: old segment L position (tail)\n\nSo the old tail position now has the new segment L+1, which is the new tail? New tail is at old segment L position.\n\nBut the cell of old tail is still occupied.\n\nIn this case, for food at (4,4), if head moves to it from (4,3), head was at (4,3), moves to (4,4), eats food, so new head at (4,4), new segment 2: (4,3) (old head), new segment 3: (3,3) (old segment 2), and so on, up to new segment 16: old segment 15 position, which is (3,4) in the previous state? Let's use the state after turn 84 move.\n\nAfter turn 84 move to (4,3): positions as above: head (4,3), tail (3,4)\n\nOn turn 85, if I move up to (4,4):\n\n(4,4) has food, so eat it.\n\nNew head at (4,4)\n\nNew segment 2: old head position (4,3)\n\nNew segment 3: old segment 2 position (3,3)\n\nNew segment 4: old segment 3 position (2,3)\n\n...\n\nNew segment 16: old segment 15 position (3,4)  // new tail\n\nSo tail is at (3,4)\n\nAnd the food is consumed.\n\nNo collision, since (4,4) was free before move.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to (3,2) on turn 84, then I might not reach (4,4) in time.\n\n(4,4) food has life span 3, so it can be eaten on turn 84,85,86.\n\nOn turn 84, I can't eat it directly from (3,3), but from (4,3) on turn 85, I can.\n\nIf I go to (3,2) on turn 84, then on turn 85, I might go to (3,3) or (4,2) or (2,2), but (3,3) is occupied by body, so from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3) but occupied, R to (4,2), L to (2,2), D to (3,1).\n\nU to (3,3) is body, collision.\n\nSo from (3,2), I can go R to (4,2), L to (2,2), or D to (3,1).\n\nThen to reach (4,4), it might take more turns, and food might disappear.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), go R to (4,2), then from (4,2) to (4,3), then to (4,4), but on turn 86, food might be gone or something.\n\nTurn 84: if I go D to (3,2), positions: head (3,2), tail (3,4) as before, but (4,4) free with food.\n\nThen turn 85: from (3,2), I can go R to (4,2) (assume free), or L to (2,2), or D to (3,1).\n\nSay go R to (4,2).\n\nThen positions: head (4,2), body (3,2), (3,3), etc., tail (3,4)\n\nThen turn 86: from (4,2), go to (4,3) or (3,2) or (5,2), etc.\n\n(4,3) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 85 move to (4,2), positions: head (4,2), segment 2: (3,2), segment 3: (3,3), segment 4: (2,3), and so on, up to segment 15: (3,4) or something.\n\nIt's messy, and (4,4) food can only be eaten until turn 86.\n\nIf I go to (4,2) on turn 85, then on turn 86, I can go to (4,3), then to (4,4) only on turn 87, but turn 87 is after life span, since life span 3, disappears after turn 86, so on turn 87, it's gone.\n\nLife span 3 on turn 84: present on turn 84,85,86; disappears after turn 86, so not available on turn 87.\n\nIf I am at (4,3) on turn 86, I can move to (4,4) to eat it on turn 86.\n\nBut if I went down on turn 84, I might not reach (4,3) by turn 86 easily.\n\nTurn 84: start at (3,3)\n\nOption 1: go R to (4,3) on turn 84.\n\nThen turn 85: at (4,3), I can go U to (4,4) to eat food immediately.\n\nOption 2: go D to (3,2) on turn 84.\n\nThen turn 85: from (3,2), can go R to (4,2) (if free).\n\nAssume (4,2) is free, no wall, no snake.\n\nThen turn 85: go to (4,2)\n\nNow at (4,2)\n\nTurn 86: from (4,2), can go U to (4,3) or R to (5,2) or L to (3,2) or D to (4,1)\n\nIf I go U to (4,3), then at (4,3), and (4,4) is adjacent, so on turn 86, I can move to (4,4) to eat if it's still there.\n\nBut on turn 86, it is still there, since disappears after turn 86.\n\nSo I can eat it on turn 86.\n\nBut compared to option 1, I eat it on turn 85, which is earlier, but since the score is the same, eating it earlier might not be better, but I should avoid risks.\n\nIn option 1, I eat on turn 85, snake grows to 16 segments.\n\nIn option 2, I eat on turn 86, same growth.\n\nBut in option 1, by going right, I am closer to other food, like (4,5).\n\n(4,5) has food with life span 5, so until turn 88.\n\nAlso, food at (1,6) with life span 8.\n\nBut there is a risk with the food at (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is currently under a body segment, position 12: (4,5)\n\nAfter moves, it might be freed.\n\nFor example, in option 1, after eating (4,4) on turn 85, head at (4,4), tail at (3,4)\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,5) to eat the food there, but (4,5) is currently occupied by a body segment.\n\nAfter turn 85, positions: after eating (4,4), head at (4,4), segment 2: (4,3), segment 3: (3,3), ..., up to segment 16: (3,4)\n\nNow, food at (4,5): it is not on head or tail, so when the snake moves, it might be freed.\n\nFor example, on turn 86, from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied? In current positions, segment 12 was at (4,5) in turn 84, but after moves, it changed.\n\nAfter turn 85, positions: let's list.\n\nAfter turn 84 move to (4,3): positions as before turn 85 head at (4,3), tail at (3,4)\n\nThen turn 85 move to (4,4) and eat: new head (4,4), new segment 2: (4,3), new segment 3: (3,3), new segment 4: (2,3), new segment 5: (1,3), new segment 6: (1,4), new segment 7: (1,5), new segment 8: (2,5), new segment 9: (2,6), new segment 10: (3,6), new segment 11: (4,6), new segment 12: (5,6), new segment 13: (5,5), new segment 14: (4,5), new segment 15: (3,5), new segment 16: (3,4)  // tail\n\nSegment 14 is at (4,5), and there is food at (4,5).\n\nSo (4,5) is occupied by segment 14.\n\nIf I move to (4,5) on turn 86, it would collide with body.\n\nSo I cannot eat it directly; I need to move away so that the body moves off (4,5).\n\nSince (4,5) is not the tail, when the snake moves without eating, the segment will move away.\n\nFor example, if on turn 86, I move from (4,4) to, say, left to (3,4) or down to (4,3), etc.\n\n(3,4) is the tail? Tail is at (3,4), so moving to (3,4) might be possible if no food, but there is no food there.\n\nLet's see possible moves from (4,4) on turn 86.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction from previous move was U (since came from (4,3) to (4,4)), so current direction U.\n\nCannot move down, opposite.\n\nCan move U, L, R.\n\n- U: (4,5) — occupied by segment 14, collision.\n\n- D: invalid, opposite.\n\n- L: (3,4) — but (3,4) is tail, segment 16. Since it's tail, I can move there if no food, but no food at (3,4), so moving to (3,4) is ok, because tail will move away.\n\nIf I move to (3,4), and no food, then head to (3,4), tail moves to where segment 15 was, which is (3,5)? Positions: segment 15 is at (3,5), segment 16 at (3,4).\n\nAfter move to (3,4): head to (3,4), which was tail, so since no food, tail moves away: new head (3,4), new segment 2: (4,4), new segment 3: (4,3), etc., and new tail at old segment 15 position (3,5).\n\n(3,4) was freed, but head moved there.\n\n(4,5) is still occupied.\n\nTo free (4,5), I need to move so that the segment on (4,5) moves.\n\nFor example, if I move right from (4,4) to (5,4) or something, but (5,4) might be wall or free.\n\n(5,4): x=5,y=4. Walls: borders ok, internal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, but (5,4) not listed, so free? But (5,4) not in snake, so free.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,4), move R to (5,4).\n\nThen positions: head to (5,4), segment 2 to (4,4), segment 3 to (4,3), etc., and segment 14 was at (4,5), moves to where segment 13 was? New segment 14: position of old segment 13, which is (5,5), etc.\n\nAfter move, segment that was on (4,5) moves to new position.\n\nSpecifically, after moving to (5,4) with no eat, new positions: head (5,4), segment 2: (4,4), segment 3: (4,3), segment 4: (3,3), segment 5: (2,3), segment 6: (1,3), segment 7: (1,4), segment 8: (1,5), segment 9: (2,5), segment 10: (2,6), segment 11: (3,6), segment 12: (4,6), segment 13: (5,6), segment 14: (5,5), segment 15: (4,5), segment 16: (3,5)  // tail\n\nOld segment 14 at (4,5) is now new segment 15 at (4,5)? New segment 15 is at old segment 14 position? New segment 15: position of old segment 14, which was (4,5), so (4,5) is still occupied by new segment 15.\n\nThe cell (4,5) is still occupied, but by a different segment; it's not freed yet.\n\nTo free the cell, the snake needs to move so that no segment is on (4,5).\n\nSince (4,5) is not tail, it will move when the snake moves, but the cell might be occupied by another segment later.\n\nThe only way to free it is when the segment that was on it moves away and no other segment moves to it immediately.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a way that the segment on (4,5) advances to a new cell, and that cell is not occupied by another segment.\n\nBut in a linear move, it might not free immediately.\n\nSince the snake is long, it might take multiple moves to free a body cell.\n\nBut (4,5) is segment 14 in turn 85, which is not near the tail; tail is at (3,4).\n\nIn the position list, segments are in order, so to free (4,5), I need to move the snake so that the segment on (4,5) moves to another cell, and that cell is empty.\n\nBut when it moves, it goes to the position of the previous segment, so unless the previous segment has moved away, it might not free.\n\nIt's easier to move the head away from the body to create space.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the food at (1,6), which is free and has long life span.\n\nBut let's go back to the initial choice.\n\nOn turn 84, if I go down to (3,2), I might avoid the crowded area, but I miss the food at (4,4) which has short life.\n\nIf I go right, I can eat (4,4) quickly and then have options.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (4,5) which is under body, so it might be hard to eat.\n\nFood at (1,6) is at (1,6), which is near the snake body.\n\nSnake has (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), etc.\n\n(1,6) is adjacent to (1,5) and (2,6), but not occupied.\n\nFrom head position, it's a bit far.\n\nI am considering the long-term survival.\n\nThe grid has obstacles, so space is limited.\n\nFor example, the area around (3,3) is crowded with snake body.\n\nMoving down to (3,2) might open up the bottom area.\n\nMoving right to (4,3) might lead to the top-right.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (6,4), etc.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: currently not an issue.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,4) on tail, but head not adjacent.\n\nBut after I eat it, if I move, it might create situations.\n\nSince all food is positive, eating is good, but I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nLet's think about the available moves.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate both options for a few turns.\n\nFirst, option: turn 84, go R to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 85, from (4,3), go U to (4,4) to eat food. As discussed.\n\nAfter that, head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nPositions as above.\n\nOn turn 86, from (4,4), I cannot go U to (4,5) because occupied, cannot go D (opposite), so only L to (3,4) or R to (5,4).\n\nIf I go L to (3,4), which is tail, no food, so move there.\n\nNew head (3,4), tail moves to (3,5) or something.\n\nPositions after move: head to (3,4), new segment 2: (4,4), new segment 3: (4,3), etc., new tail at (3,5).\n\n(4,5) is still occupied.\n\nIf I go R to (5,4), similar.\n\nNeither frees (4,5) immediately.\n\nThen from (3,4) or (5,4), I can move to other places.\n\nFor example, from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5) or L to (2,4) or D to (3,3), etc.\n\n(3,5) is body? In positions, new tail at (3,5), so if I go to (3,5), it is tail, no food, so ok.\n\nBut (4,5) food is still under body.\n\nThe food at (4,5) has life span 5, so it can be eaten later.\n\nBut it might take time to free it.\n\nI could go for the food at (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is free, so I can eat it directly if I can get there.\n\nFrom current position, it's at (1,6), head at (3,3), so I need to go left and up.\n\nBut with obstacles, like (1,2) wall, (2,4) wall, etc.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), if I go down to (3,2), then to (3,1), or to (4,2), etc., but to go to (1,6), I need to go through left side.\n\nBut left side has wall at (1,2), and snake at (1,3),(1,4),(1,5), so (1,6) is above, but (1,5) is snake, so I can move to (1,6) if I approach from above or side.\n\n(1,6) is adjacent to (1,5), (2,6), (1,7) but y=7 wall, so only (1,5) and (2,6).\n\n(1,5) is snake body, (2,6) is snake body.\n\nSo to eat (1,6), I need to move the snake so that (1,6) is free, which it is, and head moves to it.\n\nBut I need a path.\n\nFor example, from head at (3,3), go left to (2,3), but (2,3) is body and invalid move, so I cannot go left directly.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can only go D or R now.\n\nIf I go R to (4,3), then I can go down to (4,2) or up to (4,4), etc.\n\nIf I go D to (3,2), then to (4,2) or (2,2) or (3,1).\n\n(2,2) is free, (1,2) is wall, so from (2,2) I can go U to (2,3) or L to (1,2) wall or R to (3,2) or D to (2,1).\n\n(2,3) is body, so from (2,2), U to (2,3) occupied, so not possible.\n\nSo from (2,2), can go R to (3,2) or D to (2,1) or L to (1,2) wall, so only R or D.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (1,6), it might be difficult because the left side is blocked.\n\nPerhaps I should not go for (1,6) immediately.\n\nSince (4,4) food is easy to get by going right, I should do that.\n\nMoreover, after eating (4,4), I can then move to free space.\n\nLet's consider the risk of going down.\n\nIf I go down to (3,2) on turn 84, then on turn 85, from (3,2), I can go R to (4,2), or D to (3,1), or L to (2,2).\n\nIf I go R to (4,2), then on turn 86, from (4,2), I can go U to (4,3), then on turn 87 to (4,4), but (4,4) food is gone after turn 86, so on turn 87, no food, so I miss it.\n\nIf on turn 85 from (3,2), I go U, but U to (3,3) occupied, not possible.\n\nOr go D to (3,1), then from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2), R to (4,1), L to (2,1), D to (3,0) wall.\n\nBut not closer to food.\n\nSo by going down, I likely miss the food at (4,4).\n\nWhereas by going right, I can eat it on turn 85.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake is longer, but I have more options.\n\nFood at (4,5) can be eaten later if I can free the cell.\n\nBut it has life span 5, so until turn 88.\n\nAfter eating (4,4) on turn 85, head at (4,4), I can move to (5,4) on turn 86, for example.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go to (5,3) or (5,5) or (6,4) but (6,4) is wall, so not.\n\n(5,5) has food? Food at (4,5), not (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is snake segment, from positions.\n\nAfter turn 85, segment 13 at (5,5).\n\nBut no food there.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go U to (5,5) or D to (5,3) or R to (6,4) wall or L to (4,4) occupied.\n\nU to (5,5) might be occupied.\n\nIn positions after turn 85, (5,5) is segment 13.\n\nSo if I go to (5,5), collision.\n\nSo from (5,4), possible moves: D to (5,3) or L to (4,4) occupied, or R to (6,4) wall, U to (5,5) occupied. So only D to (5,3) if free.\n\n(5,3) : free? Not wall, not snake in current state, so yes.\n\nThen go to (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, I can explore the grid.\n\nBut to free (4,5), I need to move the snake so that the segment on (4,5) moves to a different cell.\n\nSince it's segment 14 in turn 85, which is not near head, it will move when the snake moves, but the cell (4,5) will be occupied by the next segment only if the snake doesn't turn.\n\nFor example, if I move the head down or right, the body will follow, and after some moves, (4,5) might be freed when the segment moves off it.\n\nBut it might take several turns.\n\nSince life span is 5, on turn 84 to 88, I have time.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate.\n\nFor now, on turn 84, going right allows me to eat the short-lived food and position for other foods.\n\nGoing down might lead to a dead end or miss food.\n\nAlso, the bottom area has obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), and wall at (1,2), so moving down might be risky.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), if I go to (3,1), then (3,1) is near y=0, and obstacles, so less space.\n\nWhereas right side has more space.\n\nFor instance, (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), etc., except (6,4) wall.\n\nAlso, food at (1,6) can be considered later.\n\nBut with life span 8, I have time.\n\nSo I think going right on turn 84 is better.\n\nThen turn 85, go up to eat (4,4).\n\nThen for turn 86, from (4,4), I need to choose a move.\n\nBut the answer format is to provide actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is for actions starting from turn 84.\n\nIt says: \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but I need to output a sequence of actions for a few turns.\n\nHow many turns? It doesn't specify, but probably for the immediate future, based on thinking ahead.\n\nI can provide actions for turn 84, 85, 86, etc.\n\nBut since future depends on choices, I should plan a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for turn 84, I decide to go R, then turn 85 U to eat, then turn 86, say, go R to (5,4) or L to (3,4).\n\nBut to avoid the body at (4,5), I should not go up.\n\nSo from (4,4) on turn 86, go R to (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,4), go D to (5,3) or something.\n\nBut let's see the food at (4,5): to eat it, I need head to move to (4,5) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, on turn 85, (4,5) is occupied by segment 14.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if no one moves to (4,5), it might be free.\n\nFor example, if on turn 86, I move from (4,4) to (5,4), then the segment that was at (4,4) moves to (4,4), but segment at (4,5) moves to where segment 13 was, which is (5,5), so (4,5) is now free? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 85: head (4,4), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (3,3), seg4 (2,3), seg5 (1,3), seg6 (1,4), seg7 (1,5), seg8 (2,5), seg9 (2,6), seg10 (3,6), seg11 (4,6), seg12 (5,6), seg13 (5,5), seg14 (4,5), seg15 (3,5), seg16 (3,4) tail\n\nOn turn 86, move to (5,4) with no eat.\n\nNew head: (5,4)\n\nNew seg2: (4,4)  // old head\n\nNew seg3: (4,3)  // old seg2\n\nNew seg4: (3,3)  // old seg3\n\nNew seg5: (2,3)  // old seg4\n\nNew seg6: (1,3)  // old seg5\n\nNew seg7: (1,4)  // old seg6\n\nNew seg8: (1,5)  // old seg7\n\nNew seg9: (2,5)  // old seg8\n\nNew seg10: (2,6)  // old seg9\n\nNew seg11: (3,6)  // old seg10\n\nNew seg12: (4,6)  // old seg11\n\nNew seg13: (5,6)  // old seg12\n\nNew seg14: (5,5)  // old seg13\n\nNew seg15: (4,5)  // old seg14\n\nNew seg16: (3,5)  // old seg15  // tail\n\nOld seg16 at (3,4) is not occupied anymore.\n\nCell (4,5) is now occupied by new seg15, not free.\n\nBut the food is at (4,5), so it's still under body.\n\nTo free it, I need to move so that no segment is on (4,5).\n\nFor example, if I move the head in a way that the body shifts.\n\nSince (4,5) is seg14, and the snake is moving, it will only free when that segment moves and the cell is not reoccupied, but in a straight line, it might not.\n\nIf I turn the head, it might create a gap.\n\nFor example, from (5,4) on turn 86, I can go D to (5,3).\n\nThen new head (5,3), new seg2 (5,4), new seg3 (4,4), etc.\n\n(4,5) is still occupied by seg15.\n\nSimilarly, not free.\n\nEventually, after several moves, it might free, but with life span 5, I have until turn 88.\n\nTurn 84,85,86,87,88.\n\nOn turn 88, it can be eaten.\n\nIf I can free it by then.\n\nBut it's uncertain.\n\nI could ignore it and go for the food at (1,6) which is free.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), free, value 1, life span 8.\n\nFrom current position, after eating (4,4), head at (4,4), I can move left and up.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) on turn 86, go L to (3,4), which is tail, so move there.\n\nNew head (3,4), tail at (3,5)\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5) or L to (2,4) or D to (3,3)\n\n(2,4) is wall, internal obstacle.\n\n(3,5) is body, so if I go U to (3,5), it is tail, no food, so ok.\n\nMove to (3,5), then new head (3,5), tail at (3,6) or something.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go U to (3,6) or R to (4,5) or L to (2,5) etc.\n\n(4,5) is occupied, so not.\n\nBut (3,6) is body, so if I go U, collision.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: since came from (3,4), direction U? From (3,4) to (3,5), so direction U.\n\nCannot go D, opposite.\n\nCan go U to (3,6), but occupied, L to (2,5), R to (4,5) occupied, so only L to (2,5) if free.\n\n(2,5) is body? In positions, after previous moves, it might be.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nPerhaps for turn 84, I should go right to eat the available food.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can provide:\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U  (to eat (4,4))\n\nThen for turn 86, from (4,4), I can go R to (5,4) to move to open space.\n\nThen turn 87 from (5,4) to (5,3) or something.\n\nBut I need to think about the other food.\n\nSince the food at (4,5) is under body and hard to eat, and (1,6) is far, I might not eat them immediately.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should try to eat all.\n\nBut survival first.\n\nAnother idea: after eating (4,4), on turn 86, I go L to (3,4), then on turn 87 from (3,4) go D to (3,3), but (3,3) is body, collision.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4) on turn 86, positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), etc., tail at (3,5)\n\nThen from (3,4), go D to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by a body segment, so collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo U to (3,5): (3,5) is tail, so move there.\n\nNew head (3,5), tail at (3,6) or something.\n\nThen from (3,5), go L to (2,5) or U to (3,6) or R to (4,5) occupied.\n\n(2,5) may be free or not.\n\nIn initial positions, (2,5) is body, but after moves, it might be different.\n\nTo simplify, I think for the first two turns, go R then U to eat the food.\n\nThen for turn 86, go R to (5,4) to avoid the body.\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (5,3), then to (5,2), etc., to explore.\n\nThe food at (1,6) can be targeted later.\n\nSince I need to output actions, let's decide.\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nThen turn 86: from (4,4), go R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 87: from (5,4), go D to (5,3) (assume free)\n\nTurn 88: from (5,3), go D to (5,2) or L to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut this is arbitrary.\n\nPerhaps I should only provide the necessary actions, but the format says to provide for multiple turns.\n\nLooking at the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so probably for a few turns.\n\nSince the state is given, I can plan for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 84, 85, 86, 87, 88.\n\nBut for turns after 85, it depends on the state.\n\nBut for now, based on current state.\n\nI think going right and up is the best for turn 84 and 85.\n\nFor turn 86, to be safe, go right to (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, for turn 87 and 88, I can decide based on future, but I need to output.\n\nPerhaps I can provide a sequence that avoids risks.\n\nAnother thought: if I go down on turn 84, I might be able to go to the bottom and then left, but with obstacles, it might be tight.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), go to (4,2), then (5,2), but (5,1) is wall, so (5,2) is ok, then to (6,2) or (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (6,1) wall, (6,4) wall, so row y=2 might be ok.\n\nBut then to reach food, it's farther.\n\nI think going right is better.\n\nMoreover, the head direction is R, so moving R is consistent.\n\nSo I'll go with R for turn 84.\n\nThen U for turn 85 to eat.\n\nThen for turn 86, from (4,4), since direction is U, I can go L, R, or U, but U to (4,5) occupied, so go R to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 87, from (5,4), direction R (since moved right), can go U, D, R, but R to (6,4) wall, U to (5,5) occupied, so only D to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 88, from (5,3), can go L to (4,3), R to (6,3) wall, D to (5,2), U to (5,4) occupied.\n\nSo go D to (5,2) or L to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can provide up to turn 86 or 88.\n\nSince the food at (4,5) might be eaten if possible, but I don't have a clear path.\n\nPerhaps I should not provide too many turns, but the format requires multiple.\n\nLet's see the core rules: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nI think for turn 84, action is R.\n\nThen for turn 85, U.\n\nThen for turn 86, R to (5,4).\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nBut to be complete, let's provide 5 actions.\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: R\n\nTurn 87: D  (from (5,4) to (5,3))\n\nTurn 88: from (5,3), I can go L to (4,3) or D to (5,2), say L to (4,3) to go back.\n\nBut (4,3) might be free.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence: Turn 84: R, Turn 85: U, Turn 86: R, Turn 87: D, Turn 88: L for example.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial move.\n\nPerhaps on turn 86, I can go L instead to (3,4), but (3,4) is tail, so ok, then from there go U to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut I think R is better to explore.\n\nI think R then U then R is ok.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 84 Decision\n\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. The current state on turn 84 has the snake head at (3,3) moving right (R). The key elements are:\n- **Food at (4,4)**: Value +1, life span 3 (available on turns 84, 85, 86). It is under the tail segment at (4,4), and the head is not adjacent to the tail (diagonal, not edge-adjacent), so no immediate tail reward danger.\n- **Food at (4,5)**: Value +1, life span 5 (available on turns 84–88). It is under a body segment and requires the snake to move away before it can be eaten.\n- **Food at (1,6)**: Value +1, life span 8 (available on turns 84–91). It is on a free cell but far from the head and partially blocked by body segments and obstacles.\n- **Possible moves from (3,3)**: \n  - Up (U) to (3,4): Occupied by body segment (3,4), collision risk. Invalid.\n  - Down (D) to (3,2): Free cell, no immediate risk.\n  - Right (R) to (4,3): Free cell, no immediate risk.\n  - Left (L) to (2,3): Occupied by body and opposite direction. Invalid.\n\nOnly **D (down)** and **R (right)** are safe moves. I must prioritize eating positive food while avoiding risks.\n\n#### Why R is better than D for turn 84:\n- **Immediate food opportunity**: Moving R to (4,3) on turn 84 positions the head adjacent to (4,4) for turn 85. (4,4) food has only 3 turns of life; missing it risks losing +1 score. If I move D to (3,2), reaching (4,4) by turn 86 is unlikely due to distance, and the food disappears after turn 86.\n- **Long-term positioning**: After moving R to (4,3), I can eat (4,4) on turn 85 (U move). This grows the snake to 16 segments and opens paths to explore the right side of the grid, which has fewer obstacles compared to the bottom (where walls at (1,2), (5,1), etc., create dead-end risks).\n- **Food at (4,5)**: Although under a body segment, it has a longer life span (until turn 88). After eating (4,4), moving right/away can eventually free (4,5) for consumption if possible within 5 turns.\n- **Food at (1,6)**: It has a long life span and can be targeted later after dealing with near-term opportunities.\n- **Risk minimization**: Moving D to (3,2) leads to a tighter area with obstacles (e.g., (1,2) wall, bottom border), increasing collision risk with a longer snake. Moving R accesses more open space (e.g., (4,2), (5,3), etc.), supporting survival.\n\n#### 5-Turn Plan (Turns 84–88):\n1. **Turn 84 (t1=84)**: Move **R (right)** to (4,3). This avoids missing the (4,4) food and sets up for eating it next turn.\n2. **Turn 85**: From (4,3), move **U (up)** to (4,4) to eat the food. Head and tail are not adjacent (tail at (3,4) is diagonal), so no tail reward danger. Snake grows to length 16.\n3. **Turn 86**: From (4,4) (direction now U), move **R (right)** to (5,4). This avoids the occupied (4,5) and moves toward open space. (U to (4,5) is occupied, D is invalid opposite move).\n4. **Turn 87**: From (5,4) (direction now R), move **D (down)** to (5,3). This avoids walls ((6,4) wall) and occupied cells ((5,5) is body), exploring safer areas.\n5. **Turn 88**: From (5,3) (direction now D), move **L (left)** to (4,3). This repositions toward the center and may allow future access to (4,5) if freed, or to (1,6). (R to (6,3) is wall, U to (5,4) may be occupied).\n\nThis sequence:\n- Eats the high-priority (4,4) food (+1 score) before it expires.\n- Avoids collisions and dead ends by moving to free cells.\n- Positions for potential (4,5) or (1,6) consumption in later turns (beyond turn 88) if feasible.\n- Prioritizes survival by staying in less constrained areas.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 84: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 85: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 86: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 87: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 88: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 85, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,3), and the body segments follow: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). That's 15 segments, so the snake is 15 cells long.\n\nHead direction is Right (R), meaning it's moving to the right, so from (4,3), it was probably moving to (5,3) or something, but let's see the positions. The head is at (4,3), and the next segment is (3,3), which is left of head, so since head direction is R, that means the snake is moving right, so from (3,3) to (4,3) on the last move. So current head is (4,3), moving right.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (4,4) with life span 2, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,5) with life span 4, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,1) with life span 10, value 1 (positive food)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Value is 1 for all, and life span given.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including the current turn, so for food at (4,4), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns, including turn 85. Since it's turn 85, after this turn, life span becomes 1, then after turn 86, it becomes 0 and disappears. Similarly for others.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n\nGrid from x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7.\n\nWalls:\n\n- Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So all cells on these lines are walls.\n\n- Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo these cells are blocked.\n\nSnake positions: List them in order:\n\nHead: (4,3)\n\nThen: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is the tail.\n\nNow, food at: (4,4), (4,5), (1,6), (2,1)\n\n(4,5) is listed as food, but in snake positions, (4,5) is part of the snake? Snake positions include (4,5) as the 13th segment or something. Let's list all snake positions:\n\nIndex: 0: (4,3) head\n\n1: (3,3)\n\n2: (2,3)\n\n3: (1,3)\n\n4: (1,4)\n\n5: (1,5)\n\n6: (2,5)\n\n7: (2,6)\n\n8: (3,6)\n\n9: (4,6)\n\n10: (5,6)\n\n11: (5,5)\n\n12: (4,5)\n\n13: (3,5)\n\n14: (3,4) tail\n\nFood at (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by the snake at index 12. So food is under the snake body? But according to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is food, but let's see what's at (4,4). Snake positions: from head (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), etc. (4,4) is not in the list? Positions: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). So (4,4) is not occupied by snake; it's empty? But food is at (4,4), so it should be free.\n\n(4,4) is not in snake positions, so it's free cell with food.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is in snake positions, index 12, which is a body segment. But food is at (4,5), so food is under the body at (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) and (2,1) are food, not occupied by snake.\n\n(1,6): snake has (1,5), (2,6), etc., but (1,6) is not listed, so free.\n\n(2,1) not in snake, free.\n\nNow, head at (4,3), direction R, so moving right. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Current direction R, so cannot move L (left), because that would be opposite. Reverse of R is L, so cannot move L. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's see adjacent cells:\n\nFrom (4,3):\n\n- Up: (4,4)\n\n- Down: (4,2)\n\n- Right: (5,3)\n\n- Left: (3,3) but (3,3) is body, and moving left would be reverse, which is not allowed, so L invalid.\n\nSo valid moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), R to (5,3)\n\nNow, (4,4) has food with value 1, life span 2.\n\n(4,2): let's see what's there. Is it wall or body? y=2, x=4. Borders are walls, but (4,2) is not border; borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7. (4,2) is within, y=2 not 0 or 7, x=4 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,2) not in that list, so free cell, no food mentioned, so empty.\n\n(5,3): similarly, not border, not internal obstacle (5,1 is obstacle but (5,3) not), so free cell, no food.\n\nNow, if I move to (4,4), I eat the food, since it's positive, snake length increases by 1, score +1.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there's food at (4,5), but (4,5) is currently occupied by snake body, so I can't eat it now; need to move away and come back later.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nLife span: for (4,4), life span 2, so after turn 85, it will have life span 1, then after turn 86, life span 0, gone. Since we're at turn 85, after this action, life span decreases.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"Turn t1 = 85\"\n\nSo for food at (4,4) with life span 2 at turn 85. After turn 85 is executed (after we move), life span decreases to 1. Then after turn 86, to 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 85 or 86, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) life span 4: at turn 85, life span 4, after turn 85, 3; turn 86, 2; turn 87,1; turn 88,0 gone. So can be eaten on turns 85 to 88, but since it's under body, only when accessible.\n\n(1,6) life span 7: at turn 85, life span 7, after turn 85,6; ... up to turn 91, then gone.\n\n(2,1) life span 10: longer.\n\nNow, back to immediate moves.\n\nIf I move to (4,4), I eat the food, snake grows to 16 segments. New head at (4,4), and tail stays or moves? When you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake extends.\n\nAfter eating, the new position: head moves to (4,4), body follows, so the segment that was at (3,4) tail moves? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you move without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its cell.\n\nWhen you eat, head moves to food cell, new segment is added where tail was, so tail doesn't move; snake grows by one.\n\nIn terms of positions: after eating, the tail remains, so the new tail is the same as old tail, but a new segment is added behind or something. No.\n\nPositions: let's say before move, positions: S0, S1, S2, ..., S14\n\nAfter moving without eating: new head at new position, then S0 to S13 become body, S14 is gone.\n\nAfter moving with eating: new head at food, then S0 to S14 remain, so new positions: new head, S0, S1, ..., S14. So length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,4) and eat, new positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), ..., up to (3,4), which was tail, now second last, and tail is still (3,4)? No.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: (4,3), 1: (3,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (1,3), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (2,6), 8: (3,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (5,6), 11: (5,5), 12: (4,5), 13: (3,5), 14: (3,4)\n\nAfter moving to (4,4) and eating: new head at (4,4), then the previous head (4,3) becomes segment 1, then (3,3) segment 2, ..., up to (3,4) segment 15, and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, so tail becomes (3,4) or new position? No, the positions shift: new segment 0: (4,4), segment 1: (4,3), segment 2: (3,3), ..., segment 14: (3,4), and segment 15: new tail at (3,4)? That can't be; the tail position stays the same only if we don't eat; if we eat, tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail, and we add a segment.\n\nStandard: after eating, the snake moves, head to new cell, body follows, but the last segment (tail) does not move; it stays, so the new snake has all previous segments plus the new head, so length +1.\n\nSo positions: new head at food, then all previous positions from head to tail. So previous head becomes body, etc., tail remains tail.\n\nIn list: after eating at (4,4), new positions: [ (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]\n\nSo now 16 segments, tail at (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, if no eat, move to (5,3), new positions: [ (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), ..., (3,5) ], and (3,4) is gone, so tail is (3,5)? Let's not confuse.\n\nFor now, back to decision.\n\nOptions for turn 85:\n\n- Move U to (4,4): eat food, grow to 16, score +1. But (4,4) is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (3,4), which is adjacent to (4,4)? (3,4) and (4,4) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut is this a danger? The rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, the tail cell (3,4) does not have food; food is at (4,4), which is head moving to.\n\nThe danger is when the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has food, and you eat that food, then after eating, the head is on the food, and the tail grows back to where it was, causing immediate collision.\n\nBut here, tail is at (3,4), no food on it. Food is at (4,4), which is empty cell.\n\nSo moving to (4,4) should be fine, no tail danger.\n\n(4,4) is not the tail cell; tail cell is (3,4).\n\nSo moving U to (4,4) seems safe and gets food.\n\nBut let's see the grid; are there walls? (4,4) is not wall, not occupied except by food.\n\nNow, other options: move D to (4,2) or R to (5,3).\n\n(4,2) is empty, no food.\n\n(5,3) is empty, no food.\n\nIf I move U, I get food immediately, but I need to think long-term.\n\nFood at (4,5) is under the body at (4,5), which is segment 12 in original, but after move, it will shift.\n\nIf I move U to (4,4), new head (4,4), body (4,3), (3,3), etc., and (4,5) is still occupied by the snake? In new positions, segment 13 is (4,5)? New positions: head (4,4), then (4,3) index1, (3,3) index2, ..., (4,5) is index 13? Let's list indices:\n\nAfter move U to (4,4) and eat: positions: 0:(4,4), 1:(4,3), 2:(3,3), 3:(2,3), 4:(1,3), 5:(1,4), 6:(1,5), 7:(2,5), 8:(2,6), 9:(3,6), 10:(4,6), 11:(5,6), 12:(5,5), 13:(4,5), 14:(3,5), 15:(3,4)\n\nSo (4,5) is at index 13, occupied.\n\nFood at (4,5) is still under snake body.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move away and come back later.\n\nBut life span is 4, so I have until turn 88.\n\nOther food: (1,6) and (2,1).\n\n(1,6) is at top-left, y=6, x=1.\n\n(2,1) at x=2,y=1, bottom-left area.\n\nNow, head at (4,4) after move.\n\nDirection: after moving U, new head direction is U, so I can move U, D, L, R except reverse, which would be D, so cannot move D next turn.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D or R now, different.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider not eating the food at (4,4) now, to save it or something, but it has short life, only 2 turns left, so if I don't eat it now or next turn, it disappears.\n\nTurn 85: if I don't move to (4,4), after this turn, life span decreases to 1, then on turn 86 I can eat it if I move there, but after turn 86 it disappears.\n\nBut on turn 86, I might not be able to reach it.\n\nCurrently at (4,3), I can go to (4,4) now.\n\nIf I go elsewhere, say to (5,3), then on turn 86, from (5,3), I can go to (5,4), (5,2), (6,3), or (4,3) but (4,3) is now body? After moving to (5,3), new positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (3,3), etc., tail (3,5) or something.\n\nAfter move R to (5,3) no eat: positions: [ (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] and (3,4) is gone, so tail is (3,5).\n\nNow from (5,3), to reach (4,4), I need to move up to (5,4) or left to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, occupied, so I can only move to (5,4), (5,2), (6,3), or (4,3) but occupied, so not possible. (4,3) is adjacent but occupied, so I cannot move there. Only free cells.\n\n(5,4) : is it free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake? Snake has (5,5), (5,6), but (5,4) not in positions, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) free, (6,3) free.\n\nBut to reach (4,4) from (5,3), I can move to (5,4) on turn 86, then from there to (4,4) on turn 87, but on turn 86 after move, (4,4) food life span was 1 at turn 86 start, after turn 86 it decreases to 0, so if I move to (4,4) on turn 86, I can eat it before it disappears.\n\nAfter turn 85, (4,4) food life span 1.\n\nOn turn 86, if I move to (4,4), I eat it, and after that, life span decreases, but since I ate it, it's gone anyway.\n\nBut on turn 86, from (5,3), I can go to (5,4), but not directly to (4,4) because not adjacent; from (5,3) to (4,4) is diagonal, not adjacent, only orthogonal moves.\n\nSo to go from (5,3) to (4,4), I need two moves: first to (5,4) or to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied, so only to (5,4), then to (4,4).\n\nOn turn 86, if I move to (5,4), I don't eat (4,4) yet.\n\nThen on turn 87, from (5,4) to (4,4), but by then, after turn 86, (4,4) food life span was 1, after turn 86 it becomes 0, so on turn 87 it's gone, I can't eat it.\n\nLife span: at turn 85, food (4,4) life span 2.\n\nAfter turn 85 (after action), life span decreases to 1.\n\nAt turn 86, life span 1, if I move to (4,4) on turn 86, I eat it, and after that, it decreases to 0, but eaten so removed.\n\nIf I don't move to it on turn 86, after turn 86 action, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSo to eat (4,4), I must be on that cell on turn 85 or 86.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBack to turn 85: if I don't move to (4,4) now, and I go to (5,3), then on turn 86, from (5,3), I can move to (5,4) or other, but not to (4,4) directly, so I can't eat it on turn 86 from there. Only if I am at (4,3) or (4,4) or (3,4) or (5,4), but (4,3) is body after move, (3,4) is tail, not adjacent directly to (4,4)? (3,4) and (4,4) are adjacent, but (3,4) is tail, and after move to (5,3), tail is at (3,5)? Let's not confuse.\n\nAfter move to (5,3) on turn 85: positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)  -- 15 segments, tail (3,5)\n\n(4,4) is empty, food.\n\nFrom head (5,3), adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,2), (6,3), (4,3) but (4,3) occupied by body, so only (5,4), (5,2), (6,3) possible.\n\n(5,4) is free, no food mentioned, so empty.\n\nIf I move to (5,4) on turn 86, then from (5,4), I can move to (4,4) on turn 87, but by turn 87, (4,4) food is gone, so I can't eat it.\n\nTherefore, if I don't eat (4,4) on turn 85, and I move away, I won't be able to eat it at all because on turn 86 I can't reach it from the new position.\n\nUnless on turn 85 I move to (4,4), which I can.\n\nOr on turn 85 I move to (4,2) or (5,3), then on turn 86 I can't reach (4,4) to eat it.\n\nSo the only way to eat (4,4) is on turn 85 by moving up.\n\nOtherwise, it will disappear uneaten.\n\nSimilarly, for other short-life food.\n\nNow, (4,5) has life span 4, so more time.\n\nBut (4,5) is under body, so I need to free it first.\n\nCurrently, (4,5) is occupied by snake body.\n\nAfter any move, it might shift.\n\nBut to eat it, I need the head to be on it when it's free.\n\nNow, let's think about the tail danger for other food.\n\nFor example, food at (1,6), but not near tail now.\n\nTail is at (3,4).\n\nNow, back to turn 85 action.\n\nIf I move U to (4,4), I get the food, grow to 16.\n\nThen new head at (4,4), direction U.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U to (4,5), but (4,5) has food but is currently occupied by body? After move to (4,4) and eat, positions include (4,5) at index 13, occupied.\n\nSo (4,5) is body, I cannot move there; it's occupied.\n\nOther moves: from (4,4), after moving U, direction U.\n\nCan move U, D, L, R except reverse D.\n\nSo possible: U to (4,5) but occupied, so invalid.\n\nD to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied, invalid.\n\nL to (3,4), which is tail? In new positions, (3,4) is index 15, tail.\n\nBut (3,4) is adjacent, and it's the tail cell.\n\nNow, (3,4) does not have food; food is at (4,5) or elsewhere, but not on (3,4).\n\nSo moving to (3,4) should be possible, since it's the tail, and after move, the tail will move away, so no collision.\n\nRule: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n\nSo it's safe, as long as no other body collision.\n\nFrom (4,4), after eating, positions: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), ..., (3,5), (3,4)\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- U: (4,5) occupied by body (index 13), invalid\n\n- D: (4,3) occupied by body (index 1), invalid\n\n- L: (3,4) occupied by tail (index 15), but since it's tail, I can move there, and it will be safe.\n\n- R: (5,4) which is free, I think.\n\n(5,4): not border, not internal obstacle (internal: (6,4) is wall, but (5,4) not), not snake, so free.\n\nAlso, food? No food at (5,4) mentioned.\n\nSo from (4,4), after moving U, I can move L to (3,4) or R to (5,4).\n\nMoving to (3,4) is possible since it's tail.\n\nThen, after moving to (3,4), the tail was there, but since I moved to it, and no eat, the tail moves away to the next segment.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAfter turn 85 move U to (4,4) eat: positions: H (4,4), B (4,3), B (3,3), B (2,3), B (1,3), B (1,4), B (1,5), B (2,5), B (2,6), B (3,6), B (4,6), B (5,6), B (5,5), B (4,5), B (3,5), T (3,4)\n\nNow on turn 86, I need to move.\n\nFrom H (4,4), direction U.\n\nOptions:\n\n- U to (4,5): but (4,5) is occupied by body (index 13), so invalid, collision.\n\n- D to (4,3): occupied by body (index 1), invalid.\n\n- L to (3,4): occupied by tail (index 15), but since tail, I can move there. After move, head to (3,4), then the body: (4,4) becomes new segment 1, then (4,3), (3,3), ..., up to (3,5), and tail (3,4) moves to where? When head moves to (3,4), which was tail, so the cell is freed, and the new tail is the previous segment 14, which is (3,5)? Positions: new head (3,4), then previous head (4,4) to index 1, then (4,3) index 2, (3,3) index 3, ..., (4,5) index 13, (3,5) index 14, and tail was (3,4) but moved from, so (3,5) becomes new tail, and (3,4) is now head.\n\nSince no eat, the last segment (tail) is removed, so new positions: [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ] and (3,5) is gone? Let's list: after moving L to (3,4): new head (3,4), then previous segments 0 to 14 except tail is removed? Segments: previous segments were 0:(4,4), 1:(4,3), 2:(3,3), 3:(2,3), 4:(1,3), 5:(1,4), 6:(1,5), 7:(2,5), 8:(2,6), 9:(3,6), 10:(4,6), 11:(5,6), 12:(5,5), 13:(4,5), 14:(3,5), 15:(3,4)\n\nWhen moving to (3,4) which was index 15, no eat, so new positions: head to (3,4), then segment 0 becomes 1, segment 1 becomes 2, ..., segment 14 becomes 15, and segment 15 is removed? No.\n\nStandard: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo new head at new position, new segment 1 at old head position, new segment 2 at old segment 1 position, ..., new segment k at old segment k-1 position, and old tail position is free.\n\nSo in this case, new head at (3,4), new segment 1 at old head (4,4), new segment 2 at old segment 1 (4,3), new segment 3 at old segment 2 (3,3), ..., new segment 15 at old segment 14 (3,5), and old segment 15 (3,4) was tail, but head moved there, so it's covered, and tail is new segment 15 at (3,5).\n\nPositions: new [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ] 15 segments, tail at (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is now tail, and it has food? But food is at (4,5), but when we moved, we didn't eat, so the food is still there, under the tail.\n\nBut for now, head at (3,4), direction L (since moved left from (4,4)).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut let's not get too deep yet.\n\nAnother option from (4,4) on turn 86 is to move R to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is free.\n\nThen new head at (5,4), direction R.\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut I have other food to consider.\n\nNow, food at (4,5) is at position (4,5), which is currently body, and after turn 85, if I move U, it is still body, but in the positions, it will be freed eventually when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if I move to (3,4) on turn 86, then (4,5) becomes tail, as above.\n\nThen on later turns, when tail moves, (4,5) will be free, and food is there, so I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut life span of (4,5) is 4 at turn 85, so after turn 85, 3; turn 86,2; turn 87,1; turn 88,0 gone. So can be eaten on turns 85 to 88.\n\nBut on turn 85 and 86, it might be occupied, so only possible on turn 87 or 88 if freed.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nNow, back to turn 85 decision.\n\nIf I move U to (4,4), I get the food now, which is good, and I can then plan to get other food.\n\nIf I move to (4,2) or (5,3), I miss the (4,4) food, and it disappears.\n\n(4,4) is +1, so missing it is a loss.\n\nMoreover, moving to (4,2) or (5,3) doesn't give immediate reward.\n\nSo it seems better to take the food at (4,4) now.\n\nBut let's see the risks.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4), I am at (4,4), and I have to move to (3,4) or (5,4) on next turn.\n\n(3,4) is tail, moving there is safe.\n\n(5,4) is free.\n\nNow, the grid has walls and obstacles.\n\nLet's list all blocked cells for clarity.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 all cells.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo blocked cells: all (0,y), (7,y) for y=0 to7; all (x,0), (x,7) for x=0 to7; and (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow, snake is occupying its positions.\n\nFor long-term, I need to access other food, like (1,6), (2,1), and (4,5) when free.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is near border.\n\nSince x=0 and y=7 are walls, (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, so adjacent to wall but not wall itself.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) at x=2,y=1.\n\nThe snake is currently in the center-right area.\n\nHead at (4,3), after U to (4,4), at (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,4), if I move L to (3,4), then to (3,3) or (3,5), etc.\n\nIf I move R to (5,4), then to (5,5) or (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,5) has food? Food at (4,5) and (5,5) not food, but (4,5) is food under body.\n\n(5,5) is currently occupied; in the snake, (5,5) is segment 11 in original, but after moves, it changes.\n\nBut let's think about the tail danger for (1,6) or other.\n\nFor example, food at (1,6): when I go to eat it, I need to ensure that the head is not adjacent to tail at that time, or if it is, the tail cell doesn't have food, but since I'm eating at (1,6), the tail cell might be elsewhere.\n\nThe danger is only if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has food, then eating that food causes collision because the tail grows back.\n\nBut for (1,6), it's not near tail now.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is far.\n\nBut (4,5) might be an issue if I eat it when tail is adjacent.\n\nBut let's first decide turn 85.\n\nI think moving U to (4,4) is the best to get the food before it disappears.\n\nThen, after that, I can go for other food.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid eating now to have more space, but since the food will be lost, it's better to eat it.\n\nMoreover, the snake is long, 15, growing to 16, but the grid is 8x8 with obstacles, so space might be tight, but there are free cells.\n\nFree cells: total cells 64, walls: borders: top and bottom rows 8+8=16, left and right columns but corners counted twice, so 4*8 - 4 = 32-4=28 border cells? No.\n\nGrid 8x8=64 cells.\n\nBorder walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\nNumber: for x=0, all y=0 to7: 8 cells\n\nx=7, all y=0 to7: 8 cells\n\ny=0, all x=1 to6 (since corners already counted): 6 cells\n\ny=7, all x=1 to6: 6 cells\n\nSo total border walls: 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 cells.\n\nInternal obstacles: 5 cells: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo total blocked: 28 + 5 = 33 cells.\n\nBut some internal might be on border? (1,2): x=1 not 0 or7, y=2 not 0 or7, so not border. Similarly others, all internal.\n\n(6,1): x=6, y=1, not border.\n\nSo blocked: 33 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 15 cells, so free cells: 64 - 33 - 15 = 16 free cells? 64 - 33 = 31, minus 15 snake, 16 free, but food on some free cells.\n\nFood at (4,4), (4,5), (1,6), (2,1)\n\n(4,4) is free, (4,5) occupied, (1,6) free, (2,1) free.\n\nSo free cells include these.\n\nAfter eating (4,4), snake 16, free cells 15, but (4,4) was free, now occupied.\n\nBut anyway, space is limited, but I can still move.\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to plan a path to eat other food without dying.\n\nAlso, food at (4,5) is under body, life span 4, so I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life 7, (2,1) life 10.\n\nNow, let's consider moving to (4,4) on turn 85.\n\nSo action turn 85: U\n\nThen on turn 86, from (4,4), I need to move.\n\nAs before, I can move L to (3,4) or R to (5,4).\n\nIf I move L to (3,4), which was tail, safe.\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nFrom there, I can move U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), or R to (4,4) but (4,4) is now body, occupied.\n\n(3,5) : is it free? After move to (3,4), positions: as above, head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) -- tail at (4,5)\n\n(3,5) is not in positions, so free? But (3,5) was segment before, but in new positions, after moving to (3,4), the positions are [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ], so (3,5) is not occupied; it was old position, now free.\n\nAnd (3,5) is not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is occupied, body.\n\n(2,4): not occupied, free.\n\n(4,4) occupied.\n\nSo from (3,4), can move U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but occupied, invalid, L to (2,4), R to (4,4) occupied invalid.\n\nSo only U to (3,5) or L to (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is an internal obstacle! (2,4) is in the internal obstacles list: (2,4) is wall.\n\nInternal obstacles include (2,4), so (2,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo from (3,4), only possible move U to (3,5), since D and R occupied, L wall.\n\n(3,5) is free, no food.\n\nSo must move U to (3,5).\n\nThen on turn 87, head at (3,5), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen from (3,5), adjacent cells: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\n(3,6): is it free? Snake has (2,6), (3,6) in positions? Current positions after turn 86: head (3,4) moved to (3,5) on turn 87? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 85: move U to (4,4), eat, positions: H(4,4), B(4,3), B(3,3), ..., B(4,5), T(3,4)\n\nTurn 86: move L to (3,4), no eat, new positions: H(3,4), B(4,4), B(4,3), B(3,3), ..., B(5,5), B(4,5) -- tail at (4,5)\n\nFrom (3,4), move U to (3,5) on turn 87.\n\n(3,5) is free, no snake or wall.\n\nSo new head (3,5), then body: (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), ..., (5,5), (4,5) but (4,5) is tail, so new positions: H(3,5), B(3,4), B(4,4), B(4,3), B(3,3), B(2,3), B(1,3), B(1,4), B(1,5), B(2,5), B(2,6), B(3,6), B(4,6), B(5,6), B(5,5) and tail (4,5) removed? Since no eat, tail moves.\n\nNew head at (3,5), then new segment 1 at old head (3,4), new segment 2 at old segment 1 (4,4), new segment 3 at old segment 2 (4,3), new segment 4 at old segment 3 (3,3), ..., up to new segment 14 at old segment 13 (5,5), and old segment 14 (4,5) is tail, removed, so new tail at (5,5).\n\nPositions: [ (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] 15 segments, tail at (5,5).\n\nNow, (4,5) is free, and it has food! But we didn't eat it, just moved away.\n\nFood at (4,5) is still there, and now the cell is free.\n\nLife span: at turn 85, life span 4.\n\nAfter turn 85, decreases to 3.\n\nAfter turn 86, decreases to 2.\n\nAfter turn 87, decreases to 1.\n\nOn turn 87, we are at (3,5), and (4,5) is adjacent, right.\n\nSo on turn 87, from (3,5), we can move R to (4,5) to eat the food.\n\nIf we do that, we eat (4,5), grow to 16.\n\nBut is there tail danger?\n\nHead at (3,5), moving to (4,5), which has food.\n\nIs head adjacent to tail? Tail is at (5,5), which is not adjacent to (3,5); (3,5) and (5,5) are not adjacent; distance 2 in x, same y.\n\nAdjacent cells: (3,5) adjacent to (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5)\n\nTail at (5,5), not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue, can eat safely.\n\nThen new head at (4,5), and snake grows.\n\nBut in this path, on turn 85 U, turn 86 L to (3,4), turn 87 U to (3,5), then turn 88 move R to (4,5) to eat.\n\nOn turn 88, from (3,5) to (4,5).\n\nBut after turn 87, food at (4,5) life span was 1? Let's track.\n\nFood (4,5) at turn 85: life span 4\n\nAfter turn 85: decreases to 3\n\nAfter turn 86: decreases to 2\n\nAfter turn 87: decreases to 1\n\nOn turn 88, before action, life span 1, if I move to (4,5), I eat it, then after, it decreases to 0, gone.\n\nIf I don't, after turn 88 action, it decreases to 0, gone.\n\nSo on turn 88, I can eat it.\n\nIn this sequence, I can eat both (4,4) and (4,5).\n\nTurn 85: U to (4,4) eat\n\nTurn 86: L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 87: U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 88: R to (4,5) eat\n\nAll good.\n\nBut on turn 86, I had to move L to (3,4), no choice, as other moves invalid.\n\nSimilarly, turn 87 U to (3,5).\n\nNow, after that, I have other food to eat.\n\n(1,6) and (2,1).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is near the snake body.\n\nCurrent positions after turn 88: after eating (4,5), head at (4,5), body includes (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), etc.\n\nBut let's not detail yet.\n\nI could have moved differently on turn 86.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) on turn 86, instead of L to (3,4), I could move R to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is free.\n\nThen head at (5,4), direction R.\n\nThen from there, I can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\n(6,4) is wall, so cannot.\n\nU to (5,5): (5,5) is occupied by body? After turn 85, positions have (5,5) as segment 12 or something.\n\nAfter turn 85: H(4,4), B(4,3), B(3,3), ..., B(5,5), B(4,5), T(3,4)\n\n(5,5) is occupied.\n\nFrom (5,4), adjacent: U to (5,5) occupied, invalid; D to (5,3) which might be free or not; L to (4,4) occupied; R to (6,4) wall.\n\nSo only possible D to (5,3).\n\n(5,3): after turn 85, is it free? Snake has (4,3), (5,3) not in positions, so free.\n\nMove D to (5,3).\n\nThen on turn 87, from (5,3), etc., but then I might not be able to eat (4,5) easily, and it has less time.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), to reach (4,5), I need to go via (5,4) or something.\n\nBut (5,4) might be occupied later.\n\nIn the first path, by moving L then U, I can eat (4,5) on turn 88.\n\nIf I go right, I might miss it or have less flexibility.\n\nMoreover, (4,5) life span short, so better to eat it soon.\n\nNow, for other food, (1,6) at (1,6), which is currently occupied? Snake has (1,5), (2,6), (1,6) not in positions, so free with food.\n\nBut (1,6) is adjacent to (1,5) and (2,6), which are body segments.\n\nIn current positions, (1,5) is segment 5, (2,6) is segment 7.\n\nTo eat (1,6), I need to move head there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) at (2,1), which is near (1,2) obstacle, but free.\n\nNow, after eating both (4,4) and (4,5), I can go towards (1,6) or (2,1).\n\n(1,6) has life span 7, after turn 85:6, 86:5, 87:4, 88:3, etc., so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life 10, more time.\n\nNow, the snake after eating (4,5) on turn 88 will be longer, 16 or 17.\n\nTurn 85 eat (4,4), length 16.\n\nTurn 88 eat (4,5), length 17.\n\nThen I need to navigate to (1,6).\n\nCurrent positions after turn 88: head at (4,5), after moving from (3,5) to (4,5) eat.\n\nBefore move, on turn 87, positions: after turn 86 and 87, let's list.\n\nAfter turn 85: positions [ (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ] tail (3,4)\n\nTurn 86: move L to (3,4), no eat: new H(3,4), B(4,4), B(4,3), B(3,3), B(2,3), B(1,3), B(1,4), B(1,5), B(2,5), B(2,6), B(3,6), B(4,6), B(5,6), B(5,5), B(4,5) tail (4,5)\n\nTurn 87: move U to (3,5), no eat: new H(3,5), B(3,4), B(4,4), B(4,3), B(3,3), B(2,3), B(1,3), B(1,4), B(1,5), B(2,5), B(2,6), B(3,6), B(4,6), B(5,6), B(5,5) tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 88: move R to (4,5), eat: since (4,5) has food, eat, so new positions: H(4,5), then previous head (3,5) to B, then B(3,4), B(4,4), ..., up to B(5,5), and add new segment at tail, so tail remains (5,5)? New positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] 16 segments, tail at (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is tail, and it has no food mentioned, so ok.\n\nNow head at (4,5), direction R (since moved right from (3,5)).\n\nFrom here, I need to go to (1,6) or (2,1).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is adjacent to (1,5), (2,6), (1,7) but y=7 wall, so (1,6) has neighbors (1,5), (1,7) invalid, (0,6) wall, (2,6).\n\n(1,5) and (2,6) are body segments.\n\nTo eat (1,6), I need to move the head there when it's accessible.\n\nOne way is to move the snake such that (1,6) is freed or head moves to it.\n\nSince the snake is long, I can navigate around.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6), but (4,6) is body? In positions, (4,6) is segment 13, occupied.\n\nD to (4,4) occupied.\n\nL to (3,5) occupied.\n\nR to (5,5) occupied, since tail.\n\n(5,5) is tail, I can move to it.\n\nMove R to (5,5), which is tail, safe.\n\nThen head to (5,5), direction R.\n\nThen new positions: H(5,5), B(4,5), B(3,5), B(3,4), B(4,4), etc., tail moves.\n\nBut then I can continue.\n\nTo reach (1,6), I need to go left and up.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (2,4), wall.\n\nThe area around (1,6) has walls and obstacles.\n\n(1,2) obstacle, (2,4) obstacle.\n\nPossible path: for example, from current, move to (5,5), then to (5,6) or (6,5) but (6,5) may be free or not.\n\n(6,5): not border, not obstacle except (6,4) wall, (6,5) not, so free.\n\nBut let's not plan all turns, since I need only for a few turns, but the answer should be actions for turn 85 and possibly next, but the format is to provide actions starting from turn 85 for multiple turns? The answer format says: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence for about 5 turns.\n\nBut in the boxed answer, I need to list actions.\n\nFor turn 85, I think U is best.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, based on the path.\n\nSince on turn 86 I have to move L to (3,4), then turn 87 U to (3,5), then turn 88 R to (4,5) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 89, from (4,5), after eating, head at (4,5), direction R.\n\nThen I can move, say, U to (4,6) but occupied? Positions: after turn 88 eat, positions [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] so (4,6) occupied, (5,5) occupied, (3,5) occupied.\n\nAdjacent: U (4,6) occupied, D (4,4) occupied, L (3,5) occupied, R (5,5) occupied, but (5,5) is tail, I can move to it.\n\nSo move R to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 89: move R to (5,5), no eat? (5,5) has no food, so no eat.\n\nNew positions: H(5,5), B(4,5), B(3,5), B(3,4), B(4,4), B(4,3), B(3,3), B(2,3), B(1,3), B(1,4), B(1,5), B(2,5), B(2,6), B(3,6), B(4,6) and tail (5,6)? Old tail was (5,5), but head moved to it, so new tail is previous segment 15, which is (5,6) in the list.\n\nPositions: new H(5,5), then B(4,5), B(3,5), ..., B(4,6), and B(5,6) but (5,6) was segment 14, now segment 15, and tail.\n\n[ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ] tail at (5,6)\n\nThen from (5,5), direction R.\n\nCan move U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5) occupied, R to (6,5) or (6,5) if possible.\n\n(6,5): not border, not obstacle, free.\n\nMove to (6,5)? But (6,5) is free.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go left.\n\nThe snake is coiled, so I can uncoil or something.\n\nSince (1,6) is near, I could go directly after eating (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 88, instead of moving to (5,5), I could move down or left, but all other cells occupied except tail.\n\nIn that position, only move to tail (5,5).\n\nSo must move to (5,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move to (6,5) or (5,6) or (5,4).\n\n(5,6) is occupied, body.\n\n(5,4) free.\n\n(6,5) free.\n\nSay move to (5,4) or (6,5).\n\nThen gradually move towards (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) has time, so possible.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1).\n\nBut for the immediate actions, I think for turn 85, moving U to get the food is best.\n\nIf I don't move U, say move R to (5,3).\n\nThen no eat, positions: H(5,3), B(4,3), B(3,3), ..., B(3,5), B(3,4) tail? After move R no eat: [ (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] tail (3,5)\n\n(4,4) food still there, life span after turn 85:1, so on turn 86, I can try to eat it.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move to (5,4), (5,2), (6,3).\n\nNot to (4,4) directly.\n\nIf move to (5,4), then from (5,4) to (4,4) on turn 87, but by then (4,4) gone.\n\nSo cannot eat (4,4), miss the food.\n\nSimilarly, if move to (4,2), same issue.\n\nSo moving away misses the food.\n\nTherefore, best to move U on turn 85 to eat (4,4).\n\nThen for turn 86, as before, must move L to (3,4) since other moves invalid.\n\nThen turn 87, move U to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 88, move R to (4,5) to eat.\n\nNow for turn 89, from (4,5), must move R to (5,5) as only option.\n\nThen turn 90, from (5,5), I can move to (5,4), (6,5), or (5,6) but (5,6) occupied.\n\n(5,6) is body, so can move to (5,4) or (6,5).\n\nTo go towards (1,6), moving left is better, so move to (5,4) or (6,5), then down or left.\n\nBut since I need to provide actions, and thinking 5 turns ahead, I can provide up to turn 89 or 90.\n\nBut the sequence might be fixed for first few turns.\n\nAnother thing: food at (1,6) and (2,1) to consider.\n\nBut for now, let's output the actions.\n\nSo for turn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: L (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 87: U (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 88: R (to (4,5) eat)\n\nThen for turn 89: R (to (5,5))\n\nNow, for turn 90, from (5,5), as above.\n\nBut I can stop here or add one more.\n\nSince the answer format, I can list from turn 85 to, say, turn 89.\n\nBut turn 85 to 89 is 5 actions.\n\nt1=85, t1 to t1+4.\n\nNow, to confirm, are there risks?\n\nIn this path, on turn 88, when I move to (4,5), the tail was at (5,5), not adjacent, so no tail danger.\n\nSimilarly, all moves seem safe.\n\nIf I had moved differently on turn 86, but I had no choice.\n\nSo I think this is a good start.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: L\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: R\n\nTurn 89: R\n\nFor turn 89, moving to (5,5), which is fine.\n\nThen after that, I can plan to go to (1,6) or (2,1).\n\nBut for the answer, this should be sufficient.\n\nSo in the boxed format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for turns 85 to 89, considering the current state and thinking 5+ turns ahead. The key priorities are:\n- Eat the positive food at (4,4) on turn 85 to avoid missing it (it disappears after turn 86).\n- Position the snake to eat the food at (4,5) on turn 88, as it is under the body initially and will be freed by snake movement.\n- Avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and the body.\n- After eating both foods, navigate towards other foods like (1,6) and (2,1) in subsequent turns (beyond turn 89), leveraging their longer life spans (7 and 10, respectively).\n\n### Analysis of the Plan:\n- **Turn 85 (Current State)**:\n  - Head at (4,3), direction Right. Valid moves: Up (to (4,4)), Down (to (4,2)), Right (to (5,3)). \n  - Moving Up to (4,4) eats the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 16) and avoids losing it (life span 2 decreases to 1 after turn 85; only turn 85 or 86 can eat it, but moving away makes it inaccessible on turn 86).\n  - Moving Down or Right misses the food and provides no immediate reward.\n- **Turn 86**:\n  - After moving Up, head is at (4,4), direction Up. Valid moves: Left (to (3,4), tail cell), Right (to (5,4)).\n    - Up to (4,5) and Down to (4,3) are invalid (body collisions).\n  - Moving Left to (3,4) is safe (tail cell; tail moves away after move). This sets up a path to free (4,5) for eating.\n- **Turn 87**:\n  - After moving Left, head is at (3,4), direction Left. Valid moves: Up (to (3,5)), Down (to (3,3) invalid), Left (to (2,4) invalid, wall), Right (to (4,4) invalid).\n  - Only move is Up to (3,5), which is safe and positions the head adjacent to (4,5) for the next turn.\n- **Turn 88**:\n  - After moving Up, head is at (3,5), direction Up. Valid moves: Right (to (4,5)), Up (to (3,6)), Down (to (3,4)), Left (to (2,5)).\n  - Moving Right to (4,5) eats the food (life span decreases to 1 after turn 87; eaten just before disappearance). No tail danger (tail at (5,5) is not adjacent).\n- **Turn 89**:\n  - After moving Right and eating, head is at (4,5), direction Right. Valid moves: Right (to (5,5), tail cell), as other directions (Up, Down, Left) are invalid (body collisions).\n  - Moving Right to (5,5) is safe (tail cell; tail moves away).\n\n### Long-Term Considerations (Beyond Turn 89):\n- **Food at (1,6) and (2,1)**: Both have sufficient life span (eaten by turns 92 and 95, respectively). After turn 89, navigate left/down towards (1,6) first (e.g., via (5,4) or (6,5) on turn 90), avoiding obstacles like (1,2) and (2,4).\n- **Survival**: The grid has limited space (16 free cells initially), but the snake can maneuver by coiling/uncoiling. Monitor tail proximity when eating future food to avoid Tail Reward Danger.\n- **Risks Avoided**: The plan avoids:\n  - Missing (4,4) and (4,5) due to short life spans.\n  - Collisions (all moves are valid and safe in the sequence).\n  - Dead ends by not trapping the snake (e.g., moving towards open areas after eating).\n\n### Answer Format:\nThe actions for turns 85 to 89 are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 85: U \\\\\nTurn 86: L \\\\\nTurn 87: U \\\\\nTurn 88: R \\\\\nTurn 89: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 86. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: the head is at (4,4), and the body segments follow: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). Let me list these to visualize:\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n\n- Then: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\nThe snake has 16 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (4,4) from below, so previous position was (4,3) or something, but since head is at (4,4) and direction is U, it came from (4,3).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (4,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,6) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake occupies: from the list above.\n\nFood at: (4,5), (1,6), (2,1)\n\nHead at (4,4), direction Up. So possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n\nSince direction is Up, I cannot move Down next turn because of no instant reverse. So Down is not allowed.\n\nPossible actions: U (up), L (left), R (right). D is invalid.\n\nNow, current position: head at (4,4).\n\nIf I move U (up), to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is a food position? Food is at (4,5), yes, with value 1, life span 3.\n\nBut is (4,5) occupied? Snake positions include (4,5)? Let's check snake positions: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\n(4,5) is in the snake positions! It's the 14th segment or something. Specifically, (4,5) is part of the body.\n\nNow, food is at (4,5), but since the snake is on it, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nCurrently, the head is at (4,4), and if I move Up to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied by the snake's body segment. According to the rules, if I move head to a cell occupied by body, it's a collision, death.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail, because the tail moves.\n\nNow, what is the tail? Snake positions: list is from head to tail. Head is (4,4), then body, tail is the last one.\n\nPositions: index 0: (4,4) head, 1: (4,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (2,3), 4: (1,3), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,6), 9: (3,6), 10: (4,6), 11: (5,6), 12: (5,5), 13: (4,5), 14: (3,5), 15: (3,4) tail? Let's count.\n\nPositions: 16 segments, so indices 0 to 15.\n\nIndex 0: (4,4) head\n\nIndex 1: (4,3)\n\nIndex 2: (3,3)\n\nIndex 3: (2,3)\n\nIndex 4: (1,3)\n\nIndex 5: (1,4)\n\nIndex 6: (1,5)\n\nIndex 7: (2,5)\n\nIndex 8: (2,6)\n\nIndex 9: (3,6)\n\nIndex 10: (4,6)\n\nIndex 11: (5,6)\n\nIndex 12: (5,5)\n\nIndex 13: (4,5)\n\nIndex 14: (3,5)\n\nIndex 15: (3,4)  // this should be the tail\n\n(3,4) is the last position, so tail is at (3,4).\n\nNow, (4,5) is index 13, which is a body segment, not tail.\n\nIf I move head to (4,5), which is occupied by index 13, that would be a body collision, death.\n\nTherefore, moving Up to (4,5) is impossible; it's suicide.\n\nSimilarly, moving Down: but Down is invalid because current direction is Up, no instant reverse. So Down not possible anyway.\n\nPossible moves: Left, Right, or Up? Up is to (4,5), which is occupied, so invalid.\n\nLeft: to (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is the tail position? Tail is at (3,4), index 15.\n\nAccording to rule, moving to tail is allowed because tail will move away.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a new cell, and it's not food, then tail moves away, so if head moves to tail position, since tail moves, it should be safe.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (3,4) should be safe because it's the tail.\n\nNow, (3,4) is a valid cell? No walls or obstacles?\n\nWalls: borders are walls, but (3,4) is within 1 to 6 in x and y? x=3, y=4, grid from 0 to 7, so x=3 not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7, so not border wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is an obstacle? (2,4) is in obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n\nSo (2,4) is an obstacle, but (3,4) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\n(3,4) is occupied by tail, but we can move there.\n\nRight: to (5,4)\n\n(5,4): is it occupied? Snake positions: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), etc. No (5,4) in list, so not occupied.\n\nWalls: x=5,y=4, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (6,4) but (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\nDown: invalid, cannot.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,4) with head U:\n\n- Left (L) to (3,4) - tail position, safe\n\n- Right (R) to (5,4) - free cell\n\n- Up (U) to (4,5) - occupied by body, collision, invalid\n\nTherefore, only two options: Left to (3,4) or Right to (5,4)\n\nNow, food considerations.\n\nFood at (4,5) is on the body, but we can't eat it now because moving there kills us.\n\nFood at (1,6) and (2,1)\n\nLife spans: (4,5) life span 3, so it will disappear in 3 turns, including current? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nCurrent turn t=86, so at turn 86, life span decreases.\n\nFood: (4,5) life span 3, so after turn 86, it will have life span 2, then turn 87:1, turn 88:0, gone? \"Disappears after N turns\", so if life span is L, it disappears after L turns, meaning at the end of turn when life span reaches 0.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life span 6, (2,1) life span 9.\n\nNow, head at (4,4), if I move left to (3,4), that's the tail.\n\nAfter move, head to (3,4), tail moves away. Current tail is at (3,4), so if head moves to (3,4), since it's the tail, no collision, and after move, the segment that was tail is removed, and a new tail is the second last, etc.\n\nBut is there food at (3,4)? No, food is at (4,5), (1,6), (2,1), not at (3,4).\n\nSo moving to (3,4) doesn't eat food, snake doesn't grow, tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (5,4), no food there, so same.\n\nBut we need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,4), head is at (4,4), adjacent? (4,4) and (3,4) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nHead is at (4,4), tail at (3,4), so yes, adjacent.\n\nBut tail has food? Is there food at tail position? Food is at (4,5), (1,6), (2,1), not at (3,4). So no food at tail, so no danger.\n\nNow, let's plan.\n\nFirst, I need to output actions for turn 86, then 87,88, etc., at least 5 turns.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nSince moving to (4,5) is impossible now, but food there might be eatable later if body moves.\n\nCurrent snake position: let's sketch the grid.\n\nI should draw a grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, x horizontal, y vertical? Usually in such games, but not specified, but from positions, let's assume x from left to right, y from bottom to top? Or top to bottom? Snake positions: head (4,4), then (4,3) which is down, so if y increases up, then (4,4) to (4,3) is down, so y=3 is below y=4? Typically in coordinates, y=0 is bottom or top? In the context, walls y=0 and y=7, and snake positions, for example, from (4,4) to (4,3), which is down, so if y=0 is bottom, then y=3 is below y=4, so decreasing y is down.\n\nIn the direction, head direction U, which is up, so to (x,y+1), so y increases up, y decreases down.\n\nSo y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nNow, snake: head (4,4)\n\nThen (4,3)  // down\n\n(3,3)  // left\n\n(2,3)  // left\n\n(1,3)  // left\n\n(1,4)  // up\n\n(1,5)  // up\n\n(2,5)  // right\n\n(2,6)  // up\n\n(3,6)  // right\n\n(4,6)  // right\n\n(5,6)  // right\n\n(5,5)  // down\n\n(4,5)  // left? from (5,5) to (4,5) is left\n\n(3,5)  // left\n\n(3,4)  // down, tail\n\nSo the snake is coiled around.\n\nNow, food at (4,5), which is occupied by the snake body at index 13.\n\nAlso food at (1,6) and (2,1).\n\n(1,6): x=1,y=6, which is top-left area.\n\n(2,1): x=2,y=1, bottom-left.\n\nNow, life spans: (4,5) has life 3, so it will disappear after turn 88? Let's see.\n\nCurrent turn 86.\n\nFood life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 86, before action, life span is as given: (4,5) life 3.\n\nAfter turn 86 action, life decreases for all food.\n\nSo after turn 86, (4,5) life becomes 2.\n\nThen turn 87: life 1\n\nTurn 88: life 0, disappears after turn 88? \"Disappears after N turns\", and countdown each turn.\n\nI think it means that at the start of turn, if life span >0, it exists, and after the turn, life span decreases, and if it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nBut for eating, when head moves to food cell during the turn.\n\nStandard: at turn t, snake moves, if it moves to food, it eats, then food is consumed, and new food may spawn or existing decrement.\n\nBut here, food has life span, so at each turn, after movement, life span decreases.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"Disappears after N turns\"\n\nSo for food with life span N, at turn t, it has life span N, after turn t, it becomes N-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears.\n\nIn this case, for (4,5) at turn 86, life span 3, so it will be present on turn 86, 87, 88, and disappear after turn 88 or at turn 89? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now, it disappears.\n\nBut \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, before action, life span is L, after the turn, it becomes L-1.\n\nIf L-1 =0, it disappears after that turn.\n\nFor (4,5), turn 86: life 3, after turn 86, life 2.\n\nTurn 87: life 2, after turn, life 1.\n\nTurn 88: life 1, after turn, life 0, disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turn 86, 87, or 88.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life 6, so until turn 91 or so.\n\n(2,1) life 9, longer.\n\nBut (4,5) is on the body, so to eat it, we need to move the body away and then head to it.\n\nCurrently, the body at (4,5) will move only if the snake moves.\n\nFor example, when the snake moves, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n\nSo the segment at (4,5) is index 13, which was previously occupied by index 12, (5,5).\n\nLet's see the positions after movement.\n\nFirst, for turn 86, we have to choose action.\n\nOptions: L to (3,4) or R to (5,4)\n\nIf I move L to (3,4):\n\n- Head moves to (3,4), which is current tail.\n\n- Since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the new snake: head at (3,4), then the old body segments move: index 1 (4,3) to where? After move, the new position: head at (3,4), then the first body segment is old head (4,4), then old index 1 (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) and the tail was (3,4) but head moved there, so tail is removed, so the new tail is (3,5), which was index 14.\n\nOld positions: 0:(4,4), 1:(4,3), 2:(3,3), 3:(2,3), 4:(1,3), 5:(1,4), 6:(1,5), 7:(2,5), 8:(2,6), 9:(3,6), 10:(4,6), 11:(5,6), 12:(5,5), 13:(4,5), 14:(3,5), 15:(3,4)\n\nAfter moving left to (3,4):\n\n- New head: (3,4)\n\n- Then body: old positions from 0 to 14, but since no growth, the last segment is removed, so body: old 0: (4,4), then old 1: (4,3), old 2: (3,3), ..., up to old 14: (3,5)\n\nSo new positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) and old 15 is gone, so (3,5) is now the tail.\n\nNew tail at (3,5)\n\nNow, food at (4,5) is still there, but now occupied by the snake? In new positions, (4,5) is occupied by the body segment, which was old index 13, now it's the second last or something.\n\nNew positions: index 0: head (3,4), index 1: (4,4), index 2: (4,3), index 3: (3,3), ..., let's list:\n\n- 0: (3,4) head\n\n- 1: (4,4)  // old head\n\n- 2: (4,3)  // old index 1\n\n- 3: (3,3)  // old index 2\n\n- 4: (2,3)  // old index 3\n\n- 5: (1,3)  // old index 4\n\n- 6: (1,4)  // old index 5\n\n- 7: (1,5)  // old index 6\n\n- 8: (2,5)  // old index 7\n\n- 9: (2,6)  // old index 8\n\n- 10: (3,6)  // old index 9\n\n- 11: (4,6)  // old index 10\n\n- 12: (5,6)  // old index 11\n\n- 13: (5,5)  // old index 12\n\n- 14: (4,5)  // old index 13\n\n- 15: (3,5)  // old index 14, now tail\n\nSo (4,5) is now index 14, a body segment, still occupied.\n\nFood at (4,5) is under the body, so not eatable yet.\n\nIf I move right to (5,4) at turn 86.\n\nHead to (5,4), no food, so new head (5,4), body: old positions 0 to 14, tail removed.\n\nOld 0: (4,4), old 1: (4,3), etc. up to old 14: (3,5), and old tail (3,4) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) and tail at (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is tail.\n\n(4,5) still occupied.\n\nNow, to eat the food at (4,5), we need the body to move away, meaning that the segment at (4,5) moves to another position, so that the cell is free, then head can move to it.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (4,5) is part of the body, and it moves when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in such a way that the segment that was at (4,5) moves to a different cell, then (4,5) becomes free, and if head moves to it, it can eat the food.\n\nBut when it moves, the food might still be there or not.\n\nAlso, the life span is decreasing.\n\nSince (4,5) has short life, only 3 turns including current, so we have to act soon if we want to eat it.\n\nBut moving directly to it now is death.\n\nSo we need to free up (4,5) first.\n\nHow can we do that?\n\nThe current position at (4,5) is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment will move to the position of the previous segment it was following.\n\nIn the current configuration, the segment at (4,5) is following (5,5), so when the snake moves, it will move to where (5,5) was, but (5,5) will move to where (5,6) was, and so on.\n\nLet's see the path.\n\nFrom the positions, the snake is like a loop.\n\nTo free (4,5), we need the segment that is at (4,5) to move away, so that no snake part is there.\n\nFor example, if we move the snake such that the head doesn't cause the body to stay.\n\nSince the food is on the body, we need to move the body off that cell.\n\nThe cell (4,5) will be free only if the segment that was there moves and no other segment moves to it.\n\nIn the movement, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front.\n\nSo for the segment at position P, it moves to the position that was occupied by the segment it was following.\n\nFor example, segment at index 13 (4,5) is following index 12 (5,5), so when snake moves, it will move to (5,5), but (5,5) will move to where index 11 was, (5,6), and so on.\n\nSo after any move, the cell (4,5) might be occupied by a different segment or not.\n\nIn the case where we moved left to (3,4), new positions had (4,5) at index 14, still occupied.\n\nIf we move right to (5,4), new positions have (4,5) at index 14 or something, still occupied.\n\nLet's simulate one move.\n\nAfter move left to (3,4) at turn 86:\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nBody: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) tail at (3,5)\n\nSo (4,5) is occupied.\n\nNow, for turn 87, head at (3,4), direction? Previous head moved from (4,4) to (3,4), so direction is Left.\n\nSo head direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (3,5)), D (down to (3,3)), R (right to (4,4)), but no instant reverse, so since direction L, cannot move R (opposite), so only U, D, L? L to (2,4), but (2,4) is an obstacle.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nAlso walls.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,4) with direction L:\n\n- U to (3,5)\n\n- D to (3,3)\n\n- R to (4,4) but reverse, not allowed, so invalid.\n\n- L to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\n(3,5) is the current tail position.\n\nTail is at (3,5), so moving to (3,5) is allowed, since tail will move.\n\n(3,3) is a body segment, occupied, so moving there would be collision.\n\nCurrent positions: head (3,4), body includes (3,3) at index 2 or something, in new positions, index 2 is (4,3)? List: positions after turn 86 move:\n\n0: (3,4) head\n\n1: (4,4)\n\n2: (4,3)\n\n3: (3,3)  // this is (3,3)\n\n4: (2,3)\n\netc.\n\nSo (3,3) is index 3, body segment.\n\nMoving D to (3,3) would be moving to a body segment, collision.\n\nMoving U to (3,5): (3,5) is the tail, so safe.\n\nSo only possible move from here is U to (3,5).\n\nIf we had moved right at turn 86 to (5,4), let's see.\n\nTurn 86 move R to (5,4):\n\nNew head: (5,4)\n\nBody: old 0 to 14: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) and tail at (3,5)\n\nPositions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) tail.\n\nDirection: moved from (4,4) to (5,4), so direction R.\n\nTurn 87, head at (5,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\nBut no instant reverse, so cannot move L (opposite to R).\n\nAlso, (6,4) is internal obstacle, so invalid.\n\n(5,5) is body segment, index 13 in new positions? Positions: 0: (5,4) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), ..., 13: (5,5)? Let's index:\n\n0: head (5,4)\n\n1: (4,4)\n\n2: (4,3)\n\n3: (3,3)\n\n4: (2,3)\n\n5: (1,3)\n\n6: (1,4)\n\n7: (1,5)\n\n8: (2,5)\n\n9: (2,6)\n\n10: (3,6)\n\n11: (4,6)\n\n12: (5,6)\n\n13: (5,5)  // this is (5,5)\n\n14: (4,5)\n\n15: (3,5) tail\n\nSo (5,5) is index 13, body segment.\n\nMoving U to (5,5) would be collision.\n\nD to (5,3): is (5,3) free? Not in positions, not wall or obstacle? x=5,y=3, not border, obstacles: (5,1) but y=3, not, so free.\n\nL to (4,4): but reverse, invalid.\n\nR to (6,4): (6,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) might be free, but let's see.\n\nIn both cases, after turn 86, we have only one choice for turn 87, essentially.\n\nIf we go left at 86, then at 87 only up to (3,5).\n\nIf we go right at 86, then at 87 only down to (5,3).\n\nThen we can continue.\n\nBut we need to plan to eat food.\n\nFirst, the food at (4,5) has short life.\n\nAfter turn 86, life span of (4,5) becomes 2.\n\nIf we can free (4,5) and move head there on turn 87 or 88.\n\nBut in the left path, after moving to (3,4) at 86, then to (3,5) at 87.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5) at turn 87:\n\nHead from (3,4) to (3,5), direction U.\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nBody: the previous positions except tail removed, but in this case, moving to tail.\n\nPrevious positions before move: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) tail at (3,5)\n\nHead moves to (3,5), which is tail, so no collision.\n\nSince no food, tail is removed, so new positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) and the old tail (3,5) is gone, so (4,5) is now the tail? Old positions: after turn 86, we have up to (3,5) as tail.\n\nWhen head moves to (3,5), the new body is the old head and body except the last.\n\nOld: 0:(3,4), 1:(4,4), 2:(4,3), 3:(3,3), 4:(2,3), 5:(1,3), 6:(1,4), 7:(1,5), 8:(2,5), 9:(2,6), 10:(3,6), 11:(4,6), 12:(5,6), 13:(5,5), 14:(4,5), 15:(3,5)\n\nMove head to (3,5), so new head: (3,5)\n\nThen body: old 0: (3,4), old 1: (4,4), old 2: (4,3), ..., up to old 14: (4,5), and old 15 removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nSo now (4,5) is the tail.\n\nAnd there is food at (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is now the tail cell.\n\nNow, head is at (3,5), which is adjacent to tail (4,5)? (3,5) and (4,5) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, the tail grows to the food cell, but head is there, collision.\n\nHere, head at (3,5), tail at (4,5), adjacent, and tail has food (since food at (4,5)), so if we eat it, it would be deadly.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to (4,5) to eat the food.\n\nBut moving to (4,5) from (3,5) is possible, but since tail is at (4,5) and has food, eating it would cause the snake to grow, so the tail doesn't move, but head moves to tail position, which is now occupied by the new tail, collision.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, at turn 87, after move, head at (3,5), tail at (4,5) with food, so they are adjacent.\n\nIf on turn 88, we move to (4,5), we would eat the food, but since head was adjacent to tail and tail had food, it would kill us.\n\nTherefore, we should not do that.\n\nOther moves from (3,5).\n\nFirst, direction: moved from (3,4) to (3,5), so direction U.\n\nTurn 88, head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\nNo instant reverse, so cannot move D (opposite to U).\n\n(3,4) is body segment, in new positions, (3,4) is index 1, body, so moving D to (3,4) collision.\n\nU to (3,6): (3,6) is in body? Positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), ..., (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) tail. (3,6) is index 10 or something? List: 0:(3,5), 1:(3,4), 2:(4,4), 3:(4,3), 4:(3,3), 5:(2,3), 6:(1,3), 7:(1,4), 8:(1,5), 9:(2,5), 10:(2,6), 11:(3,6), 12:(4,6), 13:(5,6), 14:(5,5), 15:(4,5) tail\n\nSo (3,6) is index 11, body segment.\n\nMoving U to (3,6) collision.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) is index 9, body segment, collision.\n\nR to (4,5): (4,5) is tail, with food.\n\nBut if we move to (4,5), we eat the food, but since head was adjacent to tail and tail had food, it should cause death.\n\nSo all moves seem deadly? U, D, L all to body, R to tail with food danger.\n\nD is invalid because reverse, but even if, to (3,4) body.\n\nSo from (3,5), no safe move? That can't be right.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nPositions: head at (3,5), possible cells: U (3,6): occupied by index 11 (3,6)\n\nD (3,4): occupied by index 1 (3,4)\n\nL (2,5): occupied by index 9 (2,5)\n\nR (4,5): occupied by tail, with food, and head adjacent, so eating kills.\n\nBut (4,5) is tail, so moving to tail is normally safe, but because of the food and adjacency, it's dangerous.\n\nRule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But that's when not eating food.\n\nWhen eating food, the tail doesn't move, it grows.\n\nIn this case, if we move to (4,5), we eat the food, so the tail doesn't move; instead, the snake grows, so the new tail is at the old tail position, but head is moving there, so collision.\n\nYes, so it's deadly.\n\nTherefore, from this position, there is no safe move; all adjacent cells are occupied or deadly.\n\nBut that means if we went left at turn 86, we get stuck at turn 88.\n\nAt turn 87, we moved to (3,5), which is safe, but at turn 88, no safe move.\n\nSo this path leads to death in 2 turns.\n\nTherefore, moving left at turn 86 is very bad.\n\nNow, the other option: at turn 86, move right to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 87, only move down to (5,3), as we saw earlier.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 86: move R to (5,4)\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) tail at (3,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 87: head at (5,4), move D to (5,3) (since only option)\n\nNew head: (5,3)\n\nBody: old 0 to 14: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) and tail removed, so new tail at (4,5)\n\nPositions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) tail.\n\n(4,5) is tail, with food? Food at (4,5) is still there.\n\nHead at (5,3), tail at (4,5), not adjacent, since (5,3) and (4,5) are not adjacent; different x and y.\n\nDirection: moved from (5,4) to (5,3), so direction D.\n\nTurn 88, head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\nNo instant reverse, so cannot move U (opposite to D).\n\n(5,4) is body segment, index 1 in positions, so moving U to (5,4) collision.\n\nD to (5,2): free? Not occupied, not wall or obstacle? x=5,y=2, not border, obstacles: (5,1) but y=2, so free.\n\nL to (4,3): (4,3) is body, index 3, occupied.\n\nR to (6,3): (6,3) not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), (6,3) not listed, so free, but x=6,y=3, border walls x=7, not x=6, so not wall, so free.\n\nPossible moves: D to (5,2) or R to (6,3).\n\nBoth seem possible.\n\nNow, food at (4,5) is tail, but head not adjacent, so no immediate danger.\n\nLife span of (4,5): after turn 86, life 2, after turn 87, life 1, so on turn 88, life 1, can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut (4,5) is tail, so to eat it, head needs to move to (4,5).\n\nFrom (5,3), moving to (4,5) is not adjacent; possible moves are to adjacent cells only.\n\nFrom (5,3), can go to (5,2), (5,4) invalid, (4,3) occupied, (6,3), or diagonally not, so only (5,2) or (6,3).\n\n(4,5) is not reachable directly.\n\nThe tail at (4,5) will move when the snake moves, unless food eaten.\n\nIf we don't eat food, on next move, tail moves away.\n\nFor example, on turn 88, if we move to (5,2) or (6,3), then head moves, no food eaten, so tail moves from (4,5) to where? In the movement, the segment that was at tail position moves to the position of the previous segment it was following, but since it's tail, it is removed.\n\nAfter move, new tail is the second last.\n\nIn current positions before turn 88: head (5,3), body (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), ..., (5,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nIf we move head to, say, (5,2), no food, so new head (5,2), body: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) and tail at (5,5), since (4,5) removed.\n\n(4,5) is free now, but food might be there or not.\n\nAfter turn 87, life span of (4,5) was 1 (after turn 86 it was 2, after 87 it becomes 1), then after turn 88, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nBut during turn 88, before move, life span is 1, so food is present.\n\nIf on turn 88, we move head to a different place, then after move, the cell (4,5) is free, but food is still there until after the turn.\n\nBut head is not there to eat it.\n\nThen on turn 89, food disappears.\n\nSo to eat (4,5), we need to be able to move to it on turn 88.\n\nBut from current position at turn 88 head (5,3), we cannot move to (4,5) directly; it's not adjacent.\n\nThe only way is to be adjacent on turn 88.\n\nBut head at (5,3), (4,5) is at distance, not adjacent.\n\nSo we cannot eat (4,5) from here on turn 88.\n\nSimilarly, if we had other choices.\n\nBut in this path, we might not be able to eat (4,5).\n\nNow, back to turn 86 decision.\n\nIf we move right at turn 86 to (5,4), then down to (5,3) at 87, then at 88 we have choices.\n\nBut (4,5) food will be gone after turn 88.\n\nSince we can't eat it, we should focus on other food.\n\nOther food: (1,6) and (2,1)\n\n(1,6) is at top-left, life span 6, so after turn 86, life 5, etc.\n\n(2,1) at bottom-left, life 9.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,3) after turn 87 in this path.\n\nWe need to think long-term survival.\n\nPerhaps we should avoid the left move since it leads to death.\n\nSo at turn 86, moving right is better.\n\nLet's go with that.\n\nTurn 86: move R to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 87: move D to (5,3)  // only choice\n\nNow turn 88: head at (5,3), direction D, so possible moves: D to (5,2), R to (6,3) (since U invalid, L to (4,3) occupied)\n\n(4,3) is body, yes.\n\nAlso, (5,2) and (6,3) are free.\n\nNow, let's see the grid for long-term.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nWalls at borders.\n\nFood at (1,6) and (2,1)\n\nSnake is currently at (5,3) head, with body extending.\n\nTo maximize score, we should go towards other food.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is near the top-left, but there are obstacles.\n\nFrom (5,3), we can move to (5,2) or (6,3).\n\n(5,2) is closer to (2,1)? (2,1) is bottom-left.\n\n(5,3) to (2,1) is distance, but we can plan a path.\n\nSince we need to think 5 turns ahead, let's list the actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 86: we must move R to (5,4) to avoid death.\n\nTurn 87: move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 88: now at (5,3), direction D.\n\nWe can choose D to (5,2) or R to (6,3)\n\nIf we move D to (5,2):\n\nNew head (5,2), no food, so body: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), etc., tail at (5,5) or something.\n\nPrevious positions: before turn 88, head (5,3), body (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nMove to (5,2), no food, so new head (5,2), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) tail at (5,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow (4,5) is free, but food life span 0 after turn 88, gone.\n\nIf we move R to (6,3) at turn 88:\n\nHead to (6,3), no food, new head (6,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), etc., up to (5,5), (4,5) removed, tail at (5,5)\n\nPositions: head (6,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) tail.\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, from here, we can go to (1,6) or (2,1).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is occupied by the snake? In positions, (1,6) not listed, food at (1,6), but snake has (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), so (1,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) free.\n\nBut obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, so (2,1) might be accessible.\n\nTo reach (1,6) from (6,3), it's far, and the snake body is in the way.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1).\n\nBut we need to ensure survival first.\n\nAlso, after moving, the snake has a long body, so we need to avoid trapping ourselves.\n\nFor example, from (6,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,4), but (6,4) is internal obstacle, invalid.\n\nD to (6,2), free? x=6,y=2, not border, obstacles: (6,1), (6,4), not (6,2), so free.\n\nL to (5,3), but reverse, invalid since direction R, cannot move L.\n\nR to (7,3), but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, if at (5,2), after moving D from (5,3), head at (5,2), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: D to (5,1), but (5,1) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nU to (5,3), reverse, invalid.\n\nL to (4,2), free? Not occupied, not wall or obstacle.\n\nR to (6,2), free.\n\nSo choices.\n\nBut let's focus on turn 86 action first.\n\nSince moving left at turn 86 leads to death, we must move right at turn 86.\n\nSo turn 86: R\n\nThen turn 87: D (only choice)\n\nThen for turn 88, we have choices, but we need to output actions starting from turn 86.\n\nThe answer should be for turns 86,87,88,... at least 5 turns.\n\nBut for turn 88, we can choose.\n\nTo maximize score, we should head towards other food.\n\n(1,6) has life span 6, after turn 86, life 5, so 5 turns left including current? Let's calculate life.\n\nAt turn 86, food life: (4,5) life 3, (1,6) life 6, (2,1) life 9.\n\nAfter turn 86 action, life decrease: (4,5) life 2, (1,6) life 5, (2,1) life 8.\n\nAfter turn 87, (4,5) life 1, (1,6) life 4, (2,1) life 7.\n\nAfter turn 88, (4,5) life 0, gone; (1,6) life 3, (2,1) life 6.\n\netc.\n\n(1,6) can be eaten until turn 91 or so.\n\n(2,1) longer.\n\nFrom current position after turn 87, head at (5,3), we can go towards (1,6) or (2,1).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), (2,1) at (2,1).\n\nThe area around (1,6) has snake body: for example, (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), etc., so it might be tight.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is near obstacles.\n\nBut let's see a path.\n\nSince we need to output actions, and for turn 86, we must move R.\n\nTurn 87 must move D.\n\nThen for turn 88, let's choose to move D to (5,2) or R to (6,3).\n\nMoving to (6,3) might be better to go right, but there is obstacle at (6,4), and wall.\n\nFrom (6,3), we can only move D to (6,2), then from (6,2), can move D to (6,1) but (6,1) obstacle, or L to (5,2), or R to (7,2) wall, or U to (6,3) reverse or invalid.\n\nAfter (6,3), move D to (6,2), direction D.\n\nThen at (6,2), moves: D to (6,1) obstacle invalid, U to (6,3) reverse invalid, L to (5,2) free, R to (7,2) wall invalid, so only L to (5,2).\n\nThen from (5,2), etc.\n\nBut this might lead to dead end.\n\nFrom (5,3), moving D to (5,2) might be better.\n\nHead at (5,3), move D to (5,2).\n\nThen at (5,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (5,1) obstacle invalid, U to (5,3) reverse invalid, L to (4,2) free, R to (6,2) free.\n\nSo can go L or R.\n\n(4,2) is free, then to (3,2), etc., towards left.\n\nOr to (6,2) then as before.\n\nTo reach (2,1), from (5,2), we can go left and down.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,2), then to (3,2), (2,2), but (2,2) may be free, then to (2,1), but (2,1) is food, and no obstacle at (2,2)? Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, so (2,2) should be free.\n\n(2,2) not in obstacles.\n\nThen from (2,2) to (2,1) down.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,6), from (5,2) it's up and left, but snake body is there.\n\nFor long-term, (2,1) might be easier to reach.\n\nBut we have time.\n\nSince the snake is long, we need to be careful not to trap.\n\nBut for now, at turn 86, we must move right.\n\nSo action for turn 86: R\n\nThen turn 87: D\n\nThen for turn 88, let's choose to move D to (5,2) to go down towards (2,1).\n\nThen from there, we can continue.\n\nBut we need to output multiple turns.\n\nSince the food at (4,5) cannot be eaten safely, we ignore it.\n\nFor the answer, we can output:\n\nTurn 86: R\n\nTurn 87: D\n\nTurn 88: D  // to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 89: from (5,2), direction D, move L to (4,2) or R to (6,2)\n\nSay L to (4,2) to go left.\n\nThen turn 90: from (4,2), direction L (since from (5,2) to (4,2), direction L), then can move L to (3,2), D to (4,1), U to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut we don't have to specify all, but at least 5 turns.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions for turn 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, etc.\n\nBut for turn 88 and later, we have choices, so I need to commit to a path.\n\nPerhaps for survival, moving right at 86 is crucial.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 86, when we move right to (5,4), the food at (4,5) is still there, but we don't eat it.\n\nThen at turn 87, we move down to (5,3), and (4,5) becomes tail with food, but head not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nThen at turn 88, if we could move to (4,5), but from (5,3), it's not adjacent, so impossible.\n\nSo we miss that food.\n\nBut it's only +1, and we have other food.\n\nSo not critical.\n\nNow for the answer, I think:\n\nTurn 86: R (right)\n\nTurn 87: D (down)  // only choice\n\nTurn 88: let's say D to (5,2)  // to head down\n\nThen turn 89: from (5,2), direction D, so possible moves: L to (4,2), R to (6,2), U invalid, D invalid.\n\nSay L to (4,2) to go left towards (2,1)\n\nThen turn 90: from (4,2), moved from (5,2) to (4,2), so direction L.\n\nThen can move L to (3,2), D to (4,1), U to (4,3), but (4,3) may be occupied or not.\n\nAfter previous moves, let's not simulate too far.\n\nSince we need to think ahead for survival, this path seems safe for now.\n\nIf at turn 88 we move R to (6,3), then turn 89 only D to (6,2), then turn 90 only L to (5,2), etc., which is similar.\n\nBut going left might be better to reach (2,1).\n\n(2,1) life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life shorter but still 4 after turn 87.\n\nBut (1,6) is near the body, so might be risky.\n\nFor example, to reach (1,6), from (5,3), we need to go up and left, but positions like (1,5), (2,5) are occupied, so (1,6) might be accessible if we approach carefully.\n\nBut with the body, it might be tight.\n\n(2,1) is easier.\n\nSo I think moving towards (2,1) is better.\n\nThus, for turn 86: R\n\nTurn 87: D\n\nTurn 88: D  // to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 89: from (5,2), move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 90: from (4,2), move L to (3,2)\n\nThen from (3,2), can move to (2,2), then (2,1), etc.\n\nBut we need to check if cells are free.\n\nFor example, (4,2) should be free, (3,2) free, (2,2) free, (2,1) food.\n\nNo obstacles in between except (1,2) but not on path.\n\n(2,2) to (2,1) down.\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, but not affecting.\n\nSo this seems a plan.\n\nFor the food at (1,6), we might get it later if possible, but not necessary.\n\nSo for the answer, we can output actions for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 86 to 90.\n\nBut turn 87 is fixed, turn 88 we choose D, then 89 L, 90 L.\n\nBut at turn 90, from (4,2), after moving L from (5,2) to (4,2), direction L.\n\nThen at (4,2), moves: L to (3,2), D to (4,1), U to (4,3), R to (5,2) but reverse invalid.\n\n(4,3) may be occupied; in the snake body.\n\nAfter turn 89: let's assume turn 88: move D to (5,2) from (5,3)\n\nPositions after turn 88: head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) tail\n\nThen turn 89: move L to (4,2)\n\nNew head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) tail at (5,6)? Old positions up to (5,5), but tail was (5,5), removed, so new tail (5,6)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 90: head at (4,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,2), D to (4,1), U to (4,3), R to (5,2) reverse invalid.\n\n(4,3) is body, index 5 in new positions? Positions: 0: (4,2) head, 1: (5,2), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,3), etc. So (4,3) is index 5, body, so U to (4,3) collision.\n\nD to (4,1): free? Not occupied, not wall or obstacle. Obstacles: (5,1), (1,2), (2,4), etc., (4,1) not, so free.\n\nL to (3,2): free.\n\nR invalid.\n\nSo can move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nTo go to (2,1), moving L to (3,2) is better.\n\nThen from (3,2), can move to (2,2), then (2,1).\n\n(2,2) should be free.\n\nSo for turn 90, move L to (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 86: R\n\nTurn 87: D\n\nTurn 88: D\n\nTurn 89: L\n\nTurn 90: L\n\nThen we can continue, but for the answer, at least from turn 86.\n\nThe format should be boxed.\n\nAlso, for the food, we might not eat soon, but survival is priority.\n\nIn the beginning, moving left was deadly, so right is necessary.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I have analyzed the current state and planned moves at least 5 turns ahead (turns 86 to 91). The key considerations are:\n\n- **Immediate Risk Avoidance**: At turn 86, moving left (L) to (3,4) leads to a dead end by turn 88 due to no safe moves (all adjacent cells are occupied or deadly). Moving right (R) to (5,4) is the only safe choice.\n- **Food Prioritization**: The food at (4,5) has a short lifespan (disappears after turn 88) and cannot be eaten safely due to body occupation and tail reward danger. Thus, focus shifts to other food: (1,6) (lifespan 6) and (2,1) (lifespan 9). Moving toward (2,1) is prioritized as it is easier to reach with fewer risks.\n- **Movement Constraints**: No instant reverse is allowed, and collisions with walls, obstacles, or body segments (except the tail) must be avoided. The path chosen avoids known obstacles and body segments.\n- **Long-term Survival**: The snake is steered toward open areas to prevent trapping, with moves planned to access (2,1) safely. After turn 90, the snake can continue toward (2,1) or (1,6) based on the state.\n\n### Move Plan (Turns 86 to 91)\n- **Turn 86**: Move R (right) to (5,4). This avoids the deadly left move and positions the snake for safer exploration. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 87**: Move D (down) to (5,3). This is the only valid move (U and R lead to collisions, L is invalid due to reverse). Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 88**: Move D (down) to (5,2). This heads toward (2,1) and avoids the right move to (6,3), which leads to a dead end. Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 89**: Move L (left) to (4,2). This continues the path toward (2,1). Direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 90**: Move L (left) to (3,2). This approaches (2,1) safely. Direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 91**: Move L (left) to (2,2). This sets up for eating (2,1) on the next turn. Direction becomes L.\n\n### Reasoning for 5+ Turns Ahead\n- **Turn 86 (R)**: Moving right is critical for survival. Left leads to certain death by turn 88, and up is invalid (collision with body at (4,5)).\n- **Turn 87 (D)**: Only valid move (down) avoids collisions and keeps options open.\n- **Turn 88 (D)**: Moving down to (5,2) allows progression toward (2,1). The alternative (R to (6,3)) forces a dead end (only down to (6,2) then left to (5,2), wasting turns).\n- **Turn 89 (L)**: Moving left to (4,2) avoids the body at (4,3) and heads directly toward (2,1).\n- **Turn 90 (L)**: Moving left to (3,2) is safe and efficient for reaching (2,1). Down to (4,1) is possible but less direct.\n- **Turn 91 (L)**: Moving left to (2,2) positions the head adjacent to (2,1), allowing it to be eaten on turn 92 if not consumed earlier. This path avoids obstacles (e.g., (1,2) and (2,4)) and body segments.\n\n### Food and Risk Analysis\n- **(4,5) Food**: Cannot be eaten safely (occupation by body and tail reward danger if adjacent). It disappears after turn 88, so it is abandoned.\n- **(1,6) Food**: Accessible after navigating the body; lifespan allows until turn 92. Can be targeted after (2,1) or if the path changes.\n- **(2,1) Food**: High-value target with long lifespan; the chosen path minimizes risk and distance.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not triggered in this sequence (tail not adjacent to head with food).\n- **Survival Priority**: The plan avoids all collisions and dead ends, with the snake entering open areas for flexibility.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 86: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 87: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 88: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 89: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 90: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 91: L (left)\n}",

        "step": 87,
        "score": 15,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 87.\n\n**Walls**: The border cells are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so the grid is 8x8, with walls on the borders. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So I should avoid these cells.\n\n**Snake Positions**: The snake is a list of positions, starting from the head. Head is at (5,4), then body segments: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). That's 16 segments. So the snake is quite long.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently, the head is moving Right (R), which means towards increasing x.\n\n**Food**: There are three food items:\n\n1. At (4,5) with value 1 and life span 2. So it disappears after 2 turns, including this one. Since current turn is 87, it will disappear after turn 88, meaning it can be eaten on turn 87 or 88.\n\n2. At (1,6) with value 1 and life span 5. So it can be eaten from turn 87 to 91.\n\n3. At (2,1) with value 1 and life span 8. Value is 1, so all are positive food; no negative food here. Life span from turn 87 to 94.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (5,4), moving right. So from (5,4), possible moves are: Up (U) to (5,5), Down (D) to (5,3), Left (L) to (4,4), or Right (R) to (6,4).\n\nBut I need to check for collisions and valid moves.\n\nFirst, current direction is R, so I cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) because that would be opposite direction. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So from Right, I cannot move Left immediately.\n\nAlso, walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So moving to x=6,y=4: (6,4) is an internal obstacle? Let's see the obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Yes, (6,4) is an obstacle, so I cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, moving Down to (5,3): is that a wall? y=3, not border, and not listed as obstacle? Obstacles are only those points, so (5,3) should be free unless occupied by snake.\n\nMoving Left to (4,4): but (4,4) is the first body segment. Let's see snake positions: head (5,4), then (4,4) is the next segment. If I move left to (4,4), that's where the body is. But the rule says: I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment only if the tail moves away. Here, tail is at (3,5), I think. Snake positions: index 0: (5,4) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), ..., up to 15: (3,5) tail? Let's list positions with indices:\n\n0: (5,4) head\n\n1: (4,4)\n\n2: (4,3)\n\n3: (3,3)\n\n4: (2,3)\n\n5: (1,3)\n\n6: (1,4)\n\n7: (1,5)\n\n8: (2,5)\n\n9: (2,6)\n\n10: (3,6)\n\n11: (4,6)\n\n12: (5,6)\n\n13: (5,5)\n\n14: (4,5)\n\n15: (3,5)  // tail? But positions have 16 elements, so index 15 is the last segment, which is (3,5).\n\nNow, if head moves to (4,4), which is currently occupied by segment 1. But segment 1 is not the tail; tail is (3,5). So moving to (4,4) would collide with body, since the body segment there doesn't move away immediately? Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nHere, (4,4) is not the tail; it's the second segment. When head moves, the snake moves: head goes to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So if head moves to a new cell, the body follows.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it's a collision unless it's the tail cell and we're eating food, but even then, it might be dangerous.\n\nGeneral rule: if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, it's a collision. But when the snake moves, the tail moves away only if no food is eaten. If food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows.\n\nBut in this case, for collision: before moving, if the cell head is moving to is occupied by a body segment, and it's not the tail, then after move, that body segment might still be there or not.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt turn start, positions: head at P0, body at P1 to P15.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell N:\n\n- If N is not food, then the snake moves: new head at N, new body: P0 becomes segment 1, P1 becomes segment 2, ..., P14 becomes segment 15, P15 (tail) is removed. So the cell P15 is vacated.\n\n- If N is food, then snake grows: new head at N, new body: P0, P1, ..., P15, so the tail stays, length increases.\n\nCollision occurs if:\n\n- Head moves to a wall.\n\n- Head moves to a body segment, except if it's moving to the tail position and no food is eaten there, because the tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, and that segment is not the tail, then after move, that segment will still be there (since segments shift), so collision.\n\nIf head moves to the tail cell, and no food is eaten, then tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIf head moves to the tail cell and eats food there, then tail doesn't move away, so head and tail collide immediately after growing.\n\nThe rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nBut in general, for movement.\n\nBack to possible moves from (5,4):\n\n- Up (U) to (5,5): what is at (5,5)? Snake positions: (5,5) is segment 13? Positions: 12: (5,6), 13: (5,5), 14: (4,5), 15: (3,5). So (5,5) is segment 13, not tail. Tail is (3,5). So (5,5) is a body segment, moving there would cause collision because after move, segment 13 will be at (5,5) or shifted? Let's simulate.\n\nCurrent positions: head (5,4), then body: (4,4), (4,3), etc.\n\nIf head moves Up to (5,5):\n\n- (5,5) is currently occupied by segment 13.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head at (5,5)\n\n- Since (5,5) has food? Food is at (4,5), not (5,5). Food positions: (4,5), (1,6), (2,1). So (5,5) is not food.\n\nTherefore, no food eaten, so snake moves: tail is removed.\n\nNew positions: head at (5,5), then body: previous head (5,4) becomes segment 1, (4,4) becomes segment 2, ..., up to segment 14: (4,5)? Current segment 14 is (4,5), which will become the new segment 15 or something.\n\nAfter move, the segment that was at (5,5) is now... let's index:\n\nBefore move:\n\nIndex: 0: (5,4) head\n\n1: (4,4)\n\n2: (4,3)\n\n...\n\n12: (5,6)\n\n13: (5,5)\n\n14: (4,5)\n\n15: (3,5) tail\n\nHead moves to (5,5), which is currently occupied by segment 13.\n\nSince no food, snake shrinks: new head at (5,5), new segment 1: (5,4) (previous head), segment 2: (4,4) (previous seg1), ..., segment 15: (4,5) (previous seg14), and tail (previous seg15) at (3,5) is removed.\n\nBut the cell (5,5) was occupied by seg13, which is now... after move, seg13 is no longer there; it shifts.\n\nThe key point: when head moves to (5,5), which was occupied by seg13, but after the move, seg13 is not at (5,5) anymore because the positions shift. New head is at (5,5), and the old head (5,4) is now seg1, so (5,5) is only occupied by head now, and seg13 is now at the position of old seg12 or something.\n\nSpecifically, after move to (5,5) with no food:\n\n- Cell (5,5) now has new head.\n\n- The body segment that was at (5,5) (seg13) moves to the position of seg12? No.\n\nThe snake shifts: the segment that was at index i moves to the position of index i-1 for i>=1, but head is new.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New position 0: (5,5)\n\n- New position 1: old position 0 = (5,4)\n\n- New position 2: old position 1 = (4,4)\n\n- New position 3: old position 2 = (4,3)\n\n- ...\n\n- New position 13: old position 12 = (5,6)\n\n- New position 14: old position 13 = (5,5) — but (5,5) is now the head, so this is inconsistent.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail is removed, and each body segment moves forward.\n\nSo the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated.\n\nFor a body cell, when head moves, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead of it.\n\nSpecifically, for any cell that was occupied by a body segment, after move, it will be occupied by the next segment or vacated if it was tail.\n\nBut for the cell head is moving to:\n\nIf that cell was occupied by a body segment, after move, since head is now there, and that body segment will move to a different position, so the cell is not occupied by that segment anymore. However, if it was not the tail, some other segment might be there, but in this case, since positions are unique, the cell was occupied by one segment, and after move, that segment has moved to a new position, so the cell is now free or occupied by head.\n\nBut when head moves to a cell that had a body segment, after move, head is there, and that body segment has shifted to where the previous segment was.\n\nCrucially, for collision: if the cell head is moving to is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it is a collision because after the move, that body segment would still be adjacent or something? No.\n\nThe rule is: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).\"\n\nBut after the move, the head is at the new position, and the body positions are updated.\n\nCollision is checked after the move or during?\n\nTypically, collision is checked when the head enters the cell. If the cell is occupied by a body segment at that time, it's a collision, except if it's the tail and no food is eaten.\n\nLet's read the rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a tail cell is allowed only if no food is eaten there, because tail moves away.\n\nMoving to a non-tail body cell is always a collision.\n\nIn this case, for (5,5): it is currently occupied by segment 13, which is not the tail (tail is 15 at (3,5)), so moving to (5,5) would be a collision with body, since it's not the tail.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (4,4) which is segment 1, not tail, collision.\n\nMoving to (6,4) is wall/obstacle, invalid.\n\nMoving Down to (5,3): what is at (5,3)? Snake positions: let's see, (5,4) head, then (4,4), (4,3), so (4,3) is segment 2, at (4,3). (5,3) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nBut is it within bounds? x=5, y=3, grid from 0 to 7, so yes, not wall. Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (5,3) not there, so free.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,4) with direction R:\n\n- U to (5,5): but (5,5) is body segment 13, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\n- D to (5,3): free, no collision.\n\n- L to (4,4): (4,4) is body segment 1, not tail, so collision.\n\n- R to (6,4): wall/obstacle, invalid.\n\nAlso, cannot move L because it's opposite to current direction R.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so moving L is instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is Down to (5,3).\n\nIs that right? U, D, L, R.\n\nU: (5,5) - body, collision\n\nD: (5,3) - free\n\nL: (4,4) - body, collision, and also instant reverse? Current direction R, moving L is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nR: (6,4) - obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only possible action is Down (D) to (5,3).\n\nBut that seems too constrained. Let me double-check the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nSo (5,5) is in the list, position 13.\n\n(4,4) position 1.\n\n(5,3) is not in the list, so empty.\n\nAlso, food at (4,5), which is position 14 in the snake? (4,5) is segment 14, but that's a body segment, not food. Food is separate; it can be on a body cell but can only be eaten when head moves there after the body moves away.\n\nCurrently, food at (4,5), and (4,5) is occupied by snake segment 14.\n\nBut for eating, the food can be there, but to eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (4,5), then head moves to it.\n\nBut for now, from head at (5,4), moving to (5,3) is the only option.\n\nThen, after moving down, new head at (5,3), and tail at (3,5) is removed since no food eaten.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), then body: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) — (3,5) removed, so length 15 now.\n\nOld positions: 0:(5,4), 1:(4,4), 2:(4,3), 3:(3,3), 4:(2,3), 5:(1,3), 6:(1,4), 7:(1,5), 8:(2,5), 9:(2,6), 10:(3,6), 11:(4,6), 12:(5,6), 13:(5,5), 14:(4,5), 15:(3,5)\n\nAfter move down to (5,3), no food there, so new head at (5,3), new body: old 0 (5,4) at index 1, old 1 (4,4) at index 2, old 2 (4,3) at index 3, ..., up to old 14 (4,5) at index 15? Old indices: new index 1: old 0 (5,4), new index 2: old 1 (4,4), new index 3: old 2 (4,3), ..., new index 15: old 14 (4,5). And old 15 (3,5) removed.\n\nSo new snake: head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) — 16 segments? Head + 15 body, but we removed tail, so should be 15 segments.\n\nOld had 16 positions, so length 16. After move no food, length 15.\n\nNew positions: 0: (5,3) head\n\n1: (5,4)  // old head\n\n2: (4,4)  // old seg1\n\n3: (4,3)  // old seg2\n\n4: (3,3)  // old seg3\n\n5: (2,3)  // old seg4\n\n6: (1,3)  // old seg5\n\n7: (1,4)  // old seg6\n\n8: (1,5)  // old seg7\n\n9: (2,5)  // old seg8\n\n10: (2,6)  // old seg9\n\n11: (3,6)  // old seg10\n\n12: (4,6)  // old seg11\n\n13: (5,6)  // old seg12\n\n14: (5,5)  // old seg13\n\n15: (4,5)  // old seg14  // this is the new tail\n\nOld seg15 (3,5) removed.\n\nSo new tail is (4,5).\n\nNow, head direction: moved down, so new direction is D.\n\nCurrent turn is 87, so for turn 87, I must move D.\n\nBut the answer should think 5+ turns ahead, so I need to plan beyond.\n\nFor turn 87, only possible move is D, so action is D.\n\nThen for future turns, I need to plan.\n\nAlso, food at (4,5) has life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns from now? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 87, life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 87 or 88. After that, gone.\n\nBut at turn 87, (4,5) is occupied by snake body, so cannot be eaten now. On turn 88, if the snake moves so that head can go to (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nFirst, for turn 87: only move is D to (5,3), so action D.\n\nThen turn 88: head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: from (5,3), direction D.\n\nCan move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move U (up, opposite to down).\n\nAlso, check cells:\n\n- U to (5,4): what is there? In new positions, (5,4) is segment 1, which is body, not tail (tail is (4,5)).\n\nMoving to (5,4) would be collision with body.\n\n- D to (5,2): is it free? y=2, not wall. Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (5,2) not listed, so free? Snake positions: (5,3) head, (5,4) seg1, (4,4) seg2, etc., (5,2) not occupied, so free.\n\n- L to (4,3): (4,3) is segment 3 in new positions? New: seg2 is (4,4), seg3 is (4,3), so (4,3) is body, not tail.\n\nMoving to (4,3) collision.\n\n- R to (6,3): (6,3) is within bounds? x=6,y=3, not border wall, but obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, (6,1) is obstacle, (6,3) not listed, so should be free, no snake there.\n\nBut (6,4) is obstacle, (6,3) is different.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (5,2) or R to (6,3), since U and L are invalid or collision.\n\nU is opposite direction and also body, L is body.\n\nSo can move D or R.\n\nNow, need to think ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (4,5): life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 88. After turn 88, it disappears. Turn 87 current, life span 2, so on turn 87 and 88 it exists, after turn 88 it's gone. Since we're at turn 87, after move, it's turn 88? Let's clarify.\n\nCurrent turn t=87, we take action for t=87.\n\nAfter action, turn increments, but food life span decreases at the start of turn or end?\n\nRule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (4,5) with life span 2 at turn 87.\n\nAt turn 87, life span 2.\n\nAfter turn 87, life span decreases to 1? Or at the beginning?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think \"including current\" means that on the turn it is spawned, it decreases, so after that turn, it has one less.\n\nAssume: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it can be eaten during turn t. After turn t, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1. When life span 0, it disappears.\n\nFor this food: at turn 87, life span 2, so it exists and can be eaten on turn 87. After turn 87, if not eaten, life span 1, exists on turn 88. After turn 88, if not eaten, life span 0, disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, at turn 87, we move to (5,3), and (4,5) is not eaten, so on turn 88, it still exists with life span 1.\n\n(4,5) is currently occupied by snake tail? After turn 87 move, the new tail is at (4,5), and food is at (4,5), but since it's occupied by tail, head cannot eat it unless tail moves away.\n\nTo eat food at (4,5), which is the tail position, we need to move so that the tail moves away, then head moves to it.\n\nBut life span is 1 on turn 88, so only turn 88 to eat it.\n\nOn turn 88, head at (5,3), tail at (4,5).\n\nIf we move such that tail moves away from (4,5), then head can move to (4,5) to eat, but (4,5) is adjacent? Head at (5,3), (4,5) is not adjacent; it's two cells away.\n\nAdjacent cells: from (5,3), adjacent are (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3).\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to (5,3); it's up-left, not direct adjacent.\n\nSo on turn 88, head at (5,3), cannot move directly to (4,5) in one move; it would take multiple moves.\n\nBut life span only for turn 88, after that it disappears. So impossible to eat (4,5) on turn 88 from (5,3) since not reachable in one move. Therefore, (4,5) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after turn 88.\n\nSo we don't need to worry about that food.\n\nNow other food: (1,6) with life span 5, so exists until turn 91 (since turn 87: L=5, turn 88: L=4, ..., turn 91: L=1, after turn 91 L=0 gone).\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) with life span 8, exists until turn 94.\n\nNow back to turn 88, head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (5,2) or R to (6,3).\n\nNow, need to think about the board.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls for x,y in 0-7? No.\n\n\"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" so all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. But internal cells are free except obstacles.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,1) is wall, (1,0) wall, (7,6) wall, etc.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake after turn 87: head (5,3), body: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nSo let's list occupied cells: (5,3)H, (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nFree cells: for example, (3,4), (3,5), (4,2), (5,2), (6,3), (6,2), (6,5), etc., but need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nFood: (1,6) at (1,6), but (1,6) is within bounds? x=1,y=6, not border? y=6, not 0 or 7, so not wall. But internal, and not obstacle listed. Obstacles are (6,4), etc., not (1,6). But snake is at (2,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), so (1,6) is adjacent? Let's see if occupied.\n\n(1,6): not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle, so free, and food there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) food.\n\nNow for turn 88, from (5,3), move D to (5,2) or R to (6,3).\n\n(5,2): is it free? Not wall, not obstacle (obstacles (5,1) but (5,2) not), not snake, so free.\n\n(6,3): not wall (x=6<7, y=3>0), not obstacle (obstacles (6,4) and (6,1), not (6,3)), not snake, so free.\n\nNow, if move D to (5,2), then new head (5,2), direction D.\n\nIf move R to (6,3), new head (6,3), direction R.\n\nNeed to think about accessing food and long-term.\n\nAlso, there is a risk with the tail: the head is near the body, so need to be careful.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), if move D to (5,2), then positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), etc., tail at (4,5) still? After move, if no food, tail moves.\n\nBut (5,2) has no food, so new tail would be old seg14 or something.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, food at (1,6) and (2,1).\n\n(1,6) is close to the snake body, but head is at (5,3), far.\n\n(2,1) is also far.\n\nBut life span long.\n\nPerhaps I should head towards the food.\n\nFirst, let's see the path.\n\nAlso, need to avoid dead ends.\n\nSince snake is long, space might be limited.\n\nLet's list all free cells to see available space.\n\nGrid: rows y=0 to 7, cols x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake occupies: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo occupied: let's list by coordinates:\n\nx=1: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nx=2: (2,3), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nx=3: (3,3), (3,6)\n\nx=4: (4,4), (4,3), (4,6), (4,5)\n\nx=5: (5,3)H, (5,4), (5,6), (5,5)\n\n(5,3) head, (5,4) body, (5,5) body, (5,6) body\n\nFree cells: for example:\n\n(3,4), (3,5), (4,2), (5,2), (6,3), (6,2), (6,5), (6,6)? (6,6) not wall, not obstacle, not snake.\n\n(6,6) free.\n\n(3,2), (3,1), but (3,1): y=1, not wall, obstacles: (2,4), (6,4), etc., not (3,1), so free.\n\n(2,2): but (1,2) obstacle, (2,2) not listed, so free? (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,2) is different cell.\n\nObstacles are specific points, not areas.\n\nSo (2,2) free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is obstacle, so (2,4) blocked.\n\n(2,1) has food, but (2,1) is not snake, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), (1,2), (2,4), (6,4) — (2,1) not listed, so free, and food there.\n\n(1,6) food, free.\n\nNow, head at (5,3), to reach (1,6) or (2,1).\n\n(1,6) is at top-left, (2,1) at bottom-left.\n\nSince head is at (5,3), it might be easier to go to (2,1) or (1,6), but (1,6) is closer in terms of y, but x is different.\n\nDistance: to (1,6), |dx|=4, |dy|=3, so at least 7 moves, but with obstacles.\n\nSimilarly to (2,1), |dx=3|, |dy=2|, 5 moves.\n\nBut snake body might block.\n\nFor turn 88, I need to choose between D and R.\n\nIf I go down to (5,2), then I can continue down or left, but (5,1) is obstacle, so from (5,2), I can go L to (4,2), or R to (6,2), or U back to (5,3), but (5,3) will be body.\n\nSimilarly, if I go right to (6,3), then from there I can go U to (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, D to (6,2), L to (5,3) body, or R to (7,3) but x=7 wall, so only D to (6,2).\n\n(6,3) to (6,2) or (6,4) but (6,4) obstacle, (7,3) wall, (5,3) body, so only down to (6,2) if I move to (6,3).\n\nFrom (6,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,4): obstacle, invalid\n\n- D to (6,2): free\n\n- L to (5,3): body, collision\n\n- R to (7,3): x=7 wall, invalid\n\nSo only D to (6,2).\n\nThen from (6,2), I can go L to (5,2), U to (6,3) body, D to (6,1) obstacle, R to (7,2) wall, so only L to (5,2).\n\nThen from (5,2), etc.\n\nThis seems like a dead end area.\n\nLet's list the area around (5,3).\n\nSouth: (5,2) free, (5,1) obstacle, so from (5,2) can go to (4,2) or (6,2)\n\nEast: (6,3) free, but then only to (6,2)\n\nWest: (4,3) is body, occupied.\n\nNorth: (5,4) body, occupied.\n\nSo from (5,3), only south or east, but east leads to a corner.\n\nSpecifically, if go to (6,3), then must go to (6,2), then from (6,2) must go to (5,2) or (6,1) but (6,1) obstacle, (7,2) wall, (6,3) body, so only to (5,2).\n\nThen from (5,2), can go to (4,2) or (6,2) but (6,2) is previous, body if we came from there.\n\nAfter sequence.\n\nIf at turn 88 move R to (6,3):\n\nThen head (6,3), direction R.\n\nThen only move D to (6,2) (since U obstacle, L body, R wall).\n\nNew head (6,2), direction D.\n\nThen from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3) body, D to (6,1) obstacle, L to (5,2), R to (7,2) wall. So only L to (5,2).\n\nNew head (5,2), direction L? From (6,2) to (5,2) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3) body, D to (5,1) obstacle, L to (4,2), R to (6,2) body. So only L to (4,2).\n\nNew head (4,2), direction L.\n\nThen from (4,2), can go U to (4,3) body, D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2) body.\n\n(4,3) is body, (5,2) body, so U and R invalid.\n\nD to (4,1): is it free? (4,1) not wall, not obstacle (obstacles (5,1), (6,1), etc., not (4,1)), not snake, so free.\n\nL to (3,2): free? (3,2) not occupied.\n\nSo from (4,2), can go D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nBut this is getting far, and we are moving away from food.\n\nIf at turn 88 from (5,3) move D to (5,2):\n\nHead (5,2), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (5,3) body, D to (5,1) obstacle, L to (4,2), R to (6,2).\n\nU is opposite direction and body, invalid.\n\nD obstacle.\n\nL to (4,2) free.\n\nR to (6,2) free.\n\nSo can go L or R.\n\nThen if go L to (4,2), or R to (6,2).\n\nNow, to reach food, (2,1) is below, so going down might be better.\n\n(2,1) at (2,1), head at (5,2) after move.\n\n|dx=3|, |dy=1|, so can go left and down.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) at (1,6), which is up-left, but snake body is there, so need to go around.\n\nBut life span for (1,6) is 5 turns, so until turn 91, we have time.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1), life span 8.\n\nBut (1,6) might be easier to reach first.\n\nLet's see if we can eat (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is food, and it's not occupied now? After turn 87, snake at (2,6), (1,5), etc., but (1,6) is free.\n\nTo eat (1,6), head needs to move to it when it's free.\n\nCurrently head at (5,3), after turn 87.\n\nOn turn 88, head at (5,3), move to (5,2) or (6,3).\n\nFrom (5,2), it's farther from (1,6).\n\nFrom (6,3) even farther.\n\nSo not closer.\n\nPerhaps we need to move towards the left.\n\nBut from (5,3), we can only go down or right, both not left.\n\nAfter moving down to (5,2), then we can go left to (4,2), then to (3,2), etc.\n\nLet's plan a path to (1,6) or (2,1).\n\nFirst, (2,1) is closer.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (2,1): delta x -3, delta y -2.\n\nSo need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (5,2) after move down, then to (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), then to (2,1), but (2,1) has food, and (2,2) to (2,1) down.\n\nBut (2,2) is free? Yes.\n\nHowever, there is obstacle at (1,2) and (2,4), but (2,2) should be ok.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (2,2) to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is food, and if we move to it, we eat and grow.\n\nBut need to check if possible.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,6), from head position, it's harder.\n\nBut let's think about turn 87 first.\n\nFor turn 87, only possible move is D, so action is D.\n\nThen for turn 88, from (5,3), we have choices.\n\nI should think about the tail position.\n\nTail is at (4,5), which has food on it? Food at (4,5), and tail is at (4,5), so the food is under the tail.\n\nTo eat it, we need the tail to move away, but life span only for turn 88, and head is at (5,3), not adjacent, so impossible. So forget about that food.\n\nFor turn 88, from (5,3), move D to (5,2) or R to (6,3).\n\nIf move R to (6,3), we get stuck in the corner as I thought earlier, and we have to go to (6,2), then to (5,2), wasting moves.\n\nIf move D to (5,2), then we can go left to (4,2), then to (3,2), etc., towards (2,1).\n\nFrom (5,2), after moving D, head at (5,2), direction D.\n\nThen move L to (4,2).\n\nNew head (4,2), direction L.\n\nThen from (4,2), can move L to (3,2), or D to (4,1), or U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, so collision.\n\nU to (4,3): (4,3) is segment in snake, after previous moves.\n\nAfter turn 87: snake at (5,3)H, (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), ... \n\nAfter turn 88 move D to (5,2): new head (5,2), body: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), ..., tail (4,5)\n\n(4,3) is still there.\n\nFrom (4,2), U to (4,3) is body, so collision.\n\nD to (4,1) free.\n\nL to (3,2) free.\n\nR to (5,2) body, collision.\n\nSo from (4,2), can go L to (3,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nTo reach (2,1), going to (3,2) then (2,2) then (2,1) is good.\n\n(2,2) free, (2,1) free.\n\nFrom (3,2), move L to (2,2), then D to (2,1).\n\nAt (2,1), if we move to it, we eat food and grow.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to (1,6) but it's farther.\n\nNow, life span: (2,1) life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\n(1,6) life span 5, so we can reach it after (2,1).\n\nBut let's estimate moves.\n\nAfter turn 87: head (5,3)\n\nTurn 88: move D to (5,2)  // head (5,2)\n\nTurn 89: move L to (4,2)  // head (4,2)\n\nTurn 90: move L to (3,2)  // head (3,2)\n\nTurn 91: move L to (2,2)  // head (2,2)\n\nTurn 92: move D to (2,1)  // eat food at (2,1), grow.\n\nLife span of (2,1) at turn 87: L=8, turn 88: L=7, ..., turn 92: L=3, so yes, still there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) at turn 87 L=5, turn 88 L=4, turn 89 L=3, turn 90 L=2, turn 91 L=1, turn 92 L=0 gone, so if we go to (2,1) on turn 92, (1,6) disappears after turn 91, so we miss it.\n\nBut (1,6) is at (1,6), which is near the snake body.\n\nFrom head position, to reach (1,6) faster.\n\nFrom (5,3), turn 88 move to (5,2) or (6,3), both not towards (1,6).\n\nAfter (5,2), to (4,2), then to (4,3)? But (4,3) is body.\n\nThe body is moving, so on later turns, positions change.\n\nFor example, after turn 88 move to (5,2), snake: head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), tail (4,5)? Let's list.\n\nAfter turn 88: head (5,2), body: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), and (4,5) is tail? No, after move no food, tail removed.\n\nAfter turn 87 move: head (5,3), body as before but tail removed, so positions: (5,3)H, (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) tail — 16 positions? After turn 87 move no food, length 15, so 15 positions: head and 14 body.\n\nOld after turn 87 move: head (5,3), body: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), and tail (4,5) — that's 1 head + 14 body + tail? Indices: 0:head, 1 to 14: body, 15:tail? Better to think of list with 15 segments.\n\nPositions: 0: (5,3) head\n\n1: (5,4)  // old head\n\n2: (4,4)  // old seg1\n\n3: (4,3)  // old seg2\n\n4: (3,3)  // old seg3\n\n5: (2,3)  // old seg4\n\n6: (1,3)  // old seg5\n\n7: (1,4)  // old seg6\n\n8: (1,5)  // old seg7\n\n9: (2,5)  // old seg8\n\n10: (2,6)  // old seg9\n\n11: (3,6)  // old seg10\n\n12: (4,6)  // old seg11\n\n13: (5,6)  // old seg12\n\n14: (5,5)  // old seg13\n\n15: (4,5)  // old seg14, tail\n\nLength 16? 0 to 15 is 16 positions. After no food, it should be 15.\n\nMistake.\n\nAt turn 87 start, snake had 16 positions.\n\nAfter move to (5,3) no food, new snake: the tail is removed, so only 15 positions.\n\nNew head at (5,3)\n\nNew body: the first body segment is at old head position (5,4)\n\nThen old body1 at (4,4) becomes new body2\n\n...\n\nUp to old body14 at (4,5) becomes new body14? Let's index properly.\n\nOld positions at turn 87 before move: 0:(5,4) head, 1:(4,4), 2:(4,3), 3:(3,3), 4:(2,3), 5:(1,3), 6:(1,4), 7:(1,5), 8:(2,5), 9:(2,6), 10:(3,6), 11:(4,6), 12:(5,6), 13:(5,5), 14:(4,5), 15:(3,5) tail\n\nAfter move down to (5,3) no food:\n\nNew head: (5,3)\n\nNew body0: old head (5,4)\n\nNew body1: old body1 (4,4)\n\nNew body2: old body2 (4,3)\n\nNew body3: old body3 (3,3)\n\nNew body4: old body4 (2,3)\n\nNew body5: old body5 (1,3)\n\nNew body6: old body6 (1,4)\n\nNew body7: old body7 (1,5)\n\nNew body8: old body8 (2,5)\n\nNew body9: old body9 (2,6)\n\nNew body10: old body10 (3,6)\n\nNew body11: old body11 (4,6)\n\nNew body12: old body12 (5,6)\n\nNew body13: old body13 (5,5)\n\nNew body14: old body14 (4,5)  // this is the new tail, since old tail (3,5) removed.\n\nOld body14 is (4,5), which becomes new tail.\n\nPositions: head (5,3), then body segments: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nSo 15 positions.\n\nFor turn 88, head at (5,3), move to (5,2) or (6,3).\n\nSay we move D to (5,2).\n\nThen new head (5,2), no food, so new body: old head (5,3), old body0 (5,4), ..., up to old body13 (5,5), and old tail (4,5) removed? After move, new positions:\n\nNew head: (5,2)\n\nNew body0: old head (5,3)\n\nNew body1: old body0 (5,4)\n\nNew body2: old body1 (4,4)\n\nNew body3: old body2 (4,3)\n\nNew body4: old body3 (3,3)\n\nNew body5: old body4 (2,3)\n\nNew body6: old body5 (1,3)\n\nNew body7: old body6 (1,4)\n\nNew body8: old body7 (1,5)\n\nNew body9: old body8 (2,5)\n\nNew body10: old body9 (2,6)\n\nNew body11: old body10 (3,6)\n\nNew body12: old body11 (4,6)\n\nNew body13: old body12 (5,6)  // new tail\n\nOld body13 was (5,5), old body14 was (4,5) tail, removed.\n\nNew tail at (5,6).\n\nThen head at (5,2), direction D.\n\nThen move L to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n\nSay move L to (4,2).\n\nNew head (4,2), no food, new body: old head (5,2), old body0 (5,3), old body1 (5,4), ..., up to old body12 (5,6), new tail at old body12 position.\n\nOld body12 was (5,6), so new tail (5,6).\n\nHead (4,2), body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) tail.\n\n(4,3) is body, etc.\n\nFrom (4,2), can move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1), since U to (4,3) body, R to (5,2) body.\n\nMove L to (3,2).\n\nNew head (3,2), etc.\n\nThen to (2,2), then to (2,1) for food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) can be reached from (2,6) or something, but let's focus.\n\nFor turn 87, action must be D.\n\nFor turn 88, from (5,3), moving D to (5,2) is better than R to (6,3) because it doesn't lead to a dead end.\n\nThen for turn 89, from (5,2), move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 90, from (4,2), move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 91, from (3,2), move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 92, from (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nBut at turn 91, (1,6) life span 1, so if we can eat it on turn 91.\n\nBut on turn 91, head at (2,2), (1,6) is at (1,6), not adjacent, so cannot eat in one move. Distance |dx=1|, |dy=4|, too far, so (1,6) will disappear after turn 91.\n\nWe can try to eat (1,6) earlier.\n\nFor example, from current position, but head at (5,3), not possible directly.\n\nAfter turn 88 at (5,2), instead of left, we can go up or something, but U to (5,3) is body.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can move in a way to free up space.\n\nBut with the long snake, it's tight.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (1,6) is near the tail or body.\n\nFor example, on turn 88, tail is at (5,6) or something.\n\nAfter turn 87, tail at (4,5)\n\nAfter turn 88 move to (5,2), tail at (5,6) as above.\n\n(1,6) is free, so to eat it, head needs to go to (1,6).\n\nFrom (5,2) to (1,6): |dx=4|, |dy=4|, at least 8 moves, but life span only 4 turns left (at turn 88, L=4 for (1,6)), so by turn 91, L=1, turn 92 gone.\n\nIn 4 turns, from (5,2) to (1,6) is possible if direct path, but with body blocking.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), move L to (4,2), then U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body on turn 89.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 88: head at (5,2) after move from (5,3) with D.\n\nPositions as above.\n\nTurn 89: from (5,2), move L to (4,2)\n\nNew head (4,2), no food, new body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) tail.\n\n(4,3) is body, so from (4,2), cannot move U to (4,3).\n\nCan move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nSay move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 90: head at (3,2), body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) tail? New tail.\n\nFrom (3,2), can move U to (3,3) body, D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) body.\n\nU and R invalid, so D or L.\n\nMove L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 91: head at (2,2), body: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) tail.\n\nFrom (2,2), can move U to (2,3) body, D to (2,1), L to (1,2) obstacle, R to (3,2) body.\n\nU, L, R invalid, so only D to (2,1), which has food.\n\nOn turn 91, move to (2,1), eat food, snake grows.\n\nBut (1,6) on turn 91 has life span 1, so it exists, but head at (2,1), not adjacent to (1,6), so cannot eat. After turn 91, it disappears.\n\nSo we miss (1,6).\n\nTo eat (1,6), we need to be closer earlier.\n\nFor example, from turn 88 at (5,3), if we move R to (6,3), it's worse.\n\nOr from (5,2), on turn 89, instead of L, but only L or R.\n\nAfter turn 88 at (5,2), move R to (6,2).\n\nThen head (6,2), direction R? From (5,2) to (6,2) is right.\n\nThen from (6,2), can move U to (6,3) body if we came from there, or D to (6,1) obstacle, L to (5,2) body, so only down but obstacle, stuck.\n\nIf we came to (6,2) from (6,3), but from (5,2) to (6,2), then from (6,2), only possible move is L back to (5,2), but (5,2) is body, collision.\n\nSo moving to (6,3) or (6,2) is dead end, should avoid.\n\nTherefore, for turn 88, only safe choice is to move D to (5,2), then L to (4,2), etc., as before, and eat (2,1) on turn 91 or 92.\n\nOn turn 92, as above.\n\nThen after eating (2,1), we can look for other food or explore.\n\nBut for now, let's outline the actions.\n\nTurn 87: must move D\n\nTurn 88: from (5,3), move D to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 89: from (5,2), move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 90: from (4,2), move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 91: from (3,2), move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 92: from (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nBut at turn 91, from (3,2), we can move D to (3,1) instead, but (3,1) is free, then to (2,1), but (2,1) from (3,1) is left, not down.\n\n(3,1) to (2,1) is left.\n\nBut from (3,2), moving D to (3,1), then turn 92 move L to (2,1), same as above.\n\nBut moving directly to (2,2) then D to (2,1) is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for turn 87 to at least 5 turns ahead, so to turn 92.\n\nTurn 87 to 92 is 6 turns, but since turn 87 is given, actions from t=87 to t=91 or something.\n\nAnswer format: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so for t=87 to t=87+5=92, or how many.\n\nIt says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the next turns.\n\nTypically, output for a few turns, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions.\n\nBut in the format, it might be for the immediate turns.\n\nLet's see the instruction: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nAnd \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan and output actions for t1 to t1+5 or more.\n\nt1=87, so actions for turn 87 to 92.\n\nFor turn 87: D\n\nTurn 88: D (to (5,2))\n\nBut on turn 88, from (5,3), I have to choose action.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 88: move D to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 89: move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 90: move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 91: move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 92: move D to (2,1)\n\nBut on turn 92, when moving to (2,1), we eat the food, good.\n\nBut is (2,2) free? On turn 91, when head at (3,2), positions depend on previous.\n\nLet's verify if there are collisions.\n\nStart from turn 87:\n\nTurn 87: move D to (5,3) — head to (5,3), as only choice.\n\nAfter move, head (5,3), body as above.\n\nTurn 88: move D to (5,2) — new head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), etc., tail (5,6)\n\nNo collision, (5,2) free.\n\nTurn 89: move L to (4,2) — from (5,2) to (4,2), left.\n\nNew head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) tail\n\n(4,2) free, no issue.\n\nTurn 90: move L to (3,2) — from (4,2) to (3,2), left.\n\nNew head (3,2), body (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) tail\n\n(3,2) free.\n\nTurn 91: move L to (2,2) — from (3,2) to (2,2), left.\n\nNew head (2,2), body (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) tail\n\n(2,2) free, no problem.\n\nTurn 92: move D to (2,1) — down to (2,1), which has food, so eat, grow, no collision.\n\nAll good.\n\nWe could go to (1,6) but not possible in time.\n\nSo this seems a plan.\n\nFor the answer, output actions from turn 87 to 92.\n\nBut turn 92 is t1+5=92.\n\nt1=87, t1+5=92.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nBut the action for turn 87 is D, as must.\n\nThen turn 88: D to (5,2)\n\nIn terms of direction, from head position.\n\nIn the answer, it's the action: U, D, L, R.\n\nSo for turn 87: D\n\nTurn 88: D (since moving down from (5,3) to (5,2))\n\nThen turn 89: L (from (5,2) to (4,2) left)\n\nTurn 90: L (from (4,2) to (3,2) left)\n\nTurn 91: L (from (3,2) to (2,2) left)\n\nTurn 92: D (from (2,2) to (2,1) down)\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the best.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 87):**\n- **Snake Head**: At (5,4), moving right (R).\n- **Snake Body**: Positions form a long path (16 segments), with the tail at (3,5).\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,5): Value +1, life span 2 (exists until turn 88).\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 5 (exists until turn 91).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 8 (exists until turn 94).\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n- **Constraints**:\n  - From (5,4) with direction R, possible moves are limited:\n    - Up (U) to (5,5): Occupied by body segment (not tail), collision.\n    - Down (D) to (5,3): Free (no wall, obstacle, or snake).\n    - Left (L) to (4,4): Occupied by body segment (not tail), collision, and instant reverse (from R to L) is invalid.\n    - Right (R) to (6,4): Wall/obstacle, invalid.\n  - Only valid move on turn 87 is **Down (D)** to (5,3).\n- **Food at (4,5)**: Occupied by snake body (segment at (4,5)). Cannot be eaten on turn 87. Life span 2 means it expires after turn 88. Head is too far to reach it by turn 88, so this food is unattainable and ignored.\n- **Long-Term Goals**:\n  - Maximize score by eating (1,6) or (2,1), prioritizing survival.\n  - (1,6) is closer to the snake's current body but has shorter life span (until turn 91). Reaching it requires ~7 moves, but with body blocking and limited time, it is risky and likely unattainable.\n  - (2,1) has longer life span (until turn 94) and is safer to reach (~5 moves). Path: (5,3) → (5,2) → (4,2) → (3,2) → (2,2) → (2,1).\n  - Moving right to (6,3) leads to a dead end (only (6,2) is possible, then trapped). Thus, avoid right moves.\n  - Plan: Move down to (5,2) on turn 88, then left repeatedly to reach (2,1) by turn 92, eating it safely.\n\n**5-Turn Plan (Turns 87 to 92):**\n1. **Turn 87 (Current)**: Only possible move is **Down (D)** to (5,3). Head now at (5,3), direction D.\n2. **Turn 88**: From (5,3), direction D. Possible moves:\n   - Down (D) to (5,2): Free and safe.\n   - Right (R) to (6,3): Free but leads to dead end (only (6,2) next, then trapped).\n   - **Choose Down (D)** to (5,2) for path to (2,1). Head at (5,2), direction D.\n3. **Turn 89**: From (5,2), direction D. Possible moves:\n   - Left (L) to (4,2): Free and towards (2,1).\n   - Right (R) to (6,2): Free but dead end (only back to (5,2), collision).\n   - **Choose Left (L)** to (4,2). Head at (4,2), direction L.\n4. **Turn 90**: From (4,2), direction L. Possible moves:\n   - Left (L) to (3,2): Free and towards (2,1).\n   - Down (D) to (4,1): Free but away from food.\n   - **Choose Left (L)** to (3,2). Head at (3,2), direction L.\n5. **Turn 91**: From (3,2), direction L. Possible moves:\n   - Left (L) to (2,2): Free and towards (2,1).\n   - Down (D) to (3,1): Free but not optimal.\n   - **Choose Left (L)** to (2,2). Head at (2,2), direction L.\n6. **Turn 92**: From (2,2), direction L. Possible moves:\n   - Down (D) to (2,1): Food present, eat to grow (+1 score, length +1).\n   - **Choose Down (D)** to (2,1) to eat food safely.\n\n**Risk Assessment**:\n- All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n- Eating (2,1) on turn 92 is safe: no adjacent tail risk, and food life span sufficient (L=3 at turn 92).\n- (1,6) expires after turn 91; head at (2,2) on turn 91 cannot reach it in one move, so it is ignored.\n- Path ensures long-term survival by opening space and avoiding dead ends.\n\n**Output Actions**:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 87: D\nTurn 88: D\nTurn 89: L\nTurn 90: L\nTurn 91: L\nTurn 92: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 88. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n\nThe grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x and y in range. Also, specific internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,3), then body segments: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5). The head is at (5,3) and the tail is at (4,5). Let me list all positions in order:\n\n1. Head: (5,3)\n\n2. (5,4)\n\n3. (4,4)\n\n4. (4,3)\n\n5. (3,3)\n\n6. (2,3)\n\n7. (1,3)\n\n8. (1,4)\n\n9. (1,5)\n\n10. (2,5)\n\n11. (2,6)\n\n12. (3,6)\n\n13. (4,6)\n\n14. (5,6)\n\n15. (5,5)\n\n16. Tail: (4,5)\n\nThe snake has 16 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning towards decreasing y, I assume? In coordinates, down might mean decreasing y if y increases upwards. Let's confirm the movement directions.\n\nU: (x, y+1) — up, y increases\n\nD: (x, y-1) — down, y decreases\n\nL: (x-1, y) — left, x decreases\n\nR: (x+1, y) — right, x increases\n\nAnd head direction is D, so currently moving down.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (4,5) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (4,6) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value 1, so all are positive food, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: (4,5) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 88, it has life span 1, so if not eaten now, it will disappear after this turn.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) has life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 88 + 4 - 1? Let's think carefully.\n\nLife span N means it disappears after N turns from now, and countdown decreases each turn including current. So for food with life span L at turn t, it will be gone at turn t + L - 1? No.\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, with life span N:\n\n- At the start of turn t, life span is N\n\n- After the turn, if not eaten, life span becomes N-1\n\n- When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nTypically in such games, the food is present for N full turns including the current one.\n\nLet's read: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd in the context, it's given at turn t with life span.\n\nI think it's better to interpret as: the food will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something. To avoid confusion, let's assume that at turn t, life span L means it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears before turn t+L.\n\nFor example, if L=1 at turn t, it can only be eaten on turn t, and disappears before turn t+1.\n\nIf L=2, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, disappears before turn t+2.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nFor (4,5) at turn 88, life span 1: only available on turn 88, disappears after.\n\n(1,6) life span 4: available turns 88,89,90,91, disappears before 92.\n\n(2,1) life span 7: available turns 88 to 94.\n\n(4,6) life span 10: available turns 88 to 97.\n\nNow, snake head is at (5,3), moving down, so next position if continue down would be (5,2), but is that valid?\n\nFirst, I need to find possible moves from current position.\n\nHead at (5,3), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot instant reverse, so since current direction is D, cannot go U (up), because up is opposite to down.\n\nOpposite pairs: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n\nSo from D, cannot go U next. Can go D, L, or R.\n\nNow, check for collisions or walls.\n\nFirst, moving down: to (5,2)\n\nIs (5,2) a wall? Walls: border or internal.\n\ny=0 is wall, but (5,2) is y=2, not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,1) is an obstacle, but (5,2) is not listed, so not an obstacle. Also, border walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (5,2) is fine.\n\nNow, is (5,2) occupied by snake body? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nFrom positions: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo (5,2) is not in this list, so it's empty. But there might be food, but food doesn't block movement, only if eaten.\n\nMoving to (5,2) should be safe for now.\n\nBut when we move, the snake moves, so after moving, the tail moves, etc.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves from (5,3) with direction D.\n\nCannot go U, as instant reverse forbidden.\n\nCan go D, L, or R.\n\nGo D: to (5,2)\n\n- Check if wall: no, as above.\n\n- Check if body: not in positions, so ok.\n\n- Then after move, head at (5,2), tail at? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, so tail moves away from (4,5), and new segment added only if food eaten.\n\nBut for collision check, when head moves to a cell, it must not be body except possibly the tail, because tail moves.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that is currently tail, it's ok, because tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, if it moves to a cell that is body but not tail, collision.\n\nAlso, if it moves to a cell with wall, collision.\n\nNow, for (5,2): not wall, not body, so safe.\n\nGo L: left to (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is a body segment? Snake positions: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), ... so (4,3) is the fourth segment, which is body, not tail. Tail is (4,5).\n\nSo (4,3) is occupied by body, and it's not the tail, so if head moves there, collision, death.\n\nTherefore, cannot go L to (4,3).\n\nGo R: right to (6,3)\n\n(6,3): is it wall? x=6, y=3.\n\nBorder walls: x=0 or x=7, so x=6 is not border unless specified.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,3) is not listed, so no internal obstacle there.\n\nIs it body? Snake positions: no (6,3), so empty.\n\nSo can go R to (6,3).\n\nNow, also, there might be food at (6,3)? Food positions: (4,5), (1,6), (2,1), (4,6). No (6,3), so no food there.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (5,2) or R to (6,3). L is invalid due to body.\n\nBut there is food at (4,5), which is the tail position? (4,5) is the tail, and there is food there.\n\nRule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, is head adjacent to tail?\n\nHead at (5,3), tail at (4,5). Are they adjacent?\n\nAdjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(5,3) and (4,5): difference in x is 1, y is 2, so not adjacent; it's diagonal, which is not adjacent. Adjacent is only horizontal or vertical neighbor.\n\nSo (5,3) neighbors: (5,2) down, (5,4) up, (4,3) left, (6,3) right.\n\nTail at (4,5), which is not a neighbor of (5,3). (4,5) neighbors: (4,4), (4,6), (3,5), (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is part of snake, (4,4) is part of snake, (4,6) is part of snake? Snake has (4,6) and (5,6), etc., but (4,5) is tail, so its neighbors are (4,4), (4,6), (3,5), (5,5).\n\n(4,4) is body, (4,6) is body, (5,5) is body, (3,5) not occupied? (3,5) is not in snake positions: positions are up to (4,5) tail, so (3,5) is empty.\n\nBut head is at (5,3), not adjacent to tail.\n\nTherefore, no immediate danger from tail food.\n\nBut there is food at (4,5), which is the tail. If head moves to (4,5), it would eat the food, but since it's the tail, and tail moves, is it safe?\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAnd \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, head is not adjacent to tail, so if head moves to tail position, it should be ok, and it eats the food, snake grows.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, for current turn, I need to choose an action.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,5) has life span 1, so only available this turn. If not eaten now, it disappears.\n\nNow, current possible actions:\n\n- D to (5,2)\n\n- R to (6,3)\n\n- L to (4,3) is invalid, collision.\n\n- U to (5,4) is invalid because instant reverse and also body? (5,4) is the second segment, body, so even without reverse rule, it would be collision.\n\nBut reverse rule forbids U anyway.\n\nSo only D or R.\n\nNow, if I go D to (5,2), no food there.\n\nIf I go R to (6,3), no food.\n\nBut there is food at (4,5), which is the tail. How can I eat it?\n\n(4,5) is at tail, and head is at (5,3). To eat it, I need to move head to (4,5).\n\nBut from (5,3), to go to (4,5), that's not adjacent; it's two steps away.\n\n(5,3) to (4,5) requires moving left and up or something, but not directly adjacent.\n\n(4,5) is not adjacent to (5,3), so I cannot move there directly.\n\nThe only way to eat the food at (4,5) is if the snake moves such that head moves onto it when it's accessible.\n\nBut currently, (4,5) is occupied by tail, so I can move to it only if I go to that cell when it's free or something.\n\nRule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nHere, the food is under the tail segment at (4,5).\n\nTo eat it, the body (tail) must move away, and then head must move onto it.\n\nBut the tail moves when the snake moves.\n\nAt turn 88, tail is at (4,5) with food.\n\nIf the snake moves in a way that the tail moves away from (4,5), then (4,5) becomes empty with food, and then if head moves to it later, it can be eaten.\n\nBut the food has life span 1, so only this turn.\n\nAfter the snake moves, the tail moves, so if the snake moves now, tail moves from (4,5) to the next position, so (4,5) is no longer occupied, and the food is there.\n\nThen, if head can move to (4,5) this turn, it can eat it.\n\nBut head is at (5,3), and (4,5) is not adjacent to (5,3). Distance is |dx|=1, |dy|=2, so not adjacent; it's a knight move away, not possible in one step.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (4,5) this turn because head cannot reach it in one move from current position.\n\nSince life span 1, it will disappear after this turn.\n\nSo I should not worry about it; it's gone.\n\nNow, other food: (1,6) with life span 4, (2,1) with life span 7, (4,6) with life span 10.\n\n(4,6) has food, but (4,6) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (4,6) is the 13th segment, body, so food is under body, but to eat it, body must move away and head move there.\n\n(4,6) is occupied, so similarly, cannot eat immediately.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) has food, but (1,6) is not in snake positions? Snake has (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,6). (1,6) is a cell, is it occupied?\n\nSnake positions: from list, (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), then (2,5), so (1,6) is not occupied, so food is there, free to eat if head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) not occupied, free.\n\n(4,6) is occupied, as per snake positions.\n\nLet me list all cells with food:\n\n- (4,5): occupied by tail, food under\n\n- (1,6): empty, food\n\n- (2,1): empty, food\n\n- (4,6): occupied by body (13th segment), food under\n\nFor (4,5) and (4,6), food under body, so to eat, need body to move away first.\n\nSince (4,5) has life span 1, it disappears after this turn, so no point.\n\n(4,6) has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nNow back to current move.\n\nFrom head (5,3), possible moves: D to (5,2) or R to (6,3).\n\nIf I go D to (5,2), head to (5,2), then snake moves: new head (5,2), body: (5,3) becomes first body, then (5,4), (4,4), etc., and tail (4,5) moves to where? When snake moves without eating, tail is removed, so the segment that was at (5,5) moves to (4,5)? Let's think.\n\nAfter move down: head moves to (5,2), so new positions: head (5,2), then previous head (5,3) is now first body, then (5,4) second body, (4,4) third, (4,3) fourth, (3,3) fifth, (2,3) sixth, (1,3) seventh, (1,4) eighth, (1,5) ninth, (2,5) tenth, (2,6) eleventh, (3,6) twelfth, (4,6) thirteenth, (5,6) fourteenth, (5,5) fifteenth, and tail was (4,5), but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the new tail is what was (5,5)? Positions: the last segment is removed.\n\nSnake positions: before move: [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nAfter moving down without eating: head moves to (5,2), so new head (5,2), then the body segments: the first body is the previous head (5,3), then (5,4), then (4,4), and so on, up to the second last segment which was (5,5), and the tail (4,5) is removed. So the new positions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n\nNow tail is at (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, if go right to (6,3): head to (6,3), new positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] and tail (4,5) removed, so tail at (5,5).\n\nNow, after move, the food at (4,5) is now exposed since tail moved, but since life span 1, after this turn it disappears, so even if exposed, no one can eat it because next turn it's gone.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple moves ahead to maximize score, avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to see positions.\n\nGrid 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: head (5,3), body as listed.\n\nFood: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6) - (4,5) will be gone.\n\n(4,6) has food under it, but occupied, so not accessible yet.\n\nAvailable food: (1,6) and (2,1)\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6\n\n(2,1) at x=2,y=1\n\n(4,6) at x=4,y=6, but occupied.\n\nAlso, after moving, if I go down or right, the snake changes.\n\nI need to think about path to food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nSince I must think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider sequences.\n\nBut 5 turns is a lot, maybe I can simulate a few options.\n\nFirst, option A: move down to (5,2) at turn 88.\n\nThen head at (5,2), direction was D, but after move, direction is down, so for next move, direction is D.\n\nFrom (5,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot instant reverse, which would be U, since last move was D, so cannot go U (up).\n\nCan go D, L, R.\n\nGo D: to (5,1), but (5,1) is an internal obstacle, wall, so collision, death. Cannot.\n\nGo L: to (4,2)\n\n(4,2): not wall? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,2) not listed, so no. Not body? After move, positions: as above, [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), ... (5,5) ] so (4,2) not occupied, so ok.\n\nGo R: to (6,2)\n\n(6,2): not border, internal obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), not (6,2), so no. Not body, so ok.\n\nSo from (5,2), can go L to (4,2) or R to (6,2), D invalid.\n\nNow, if go L to (4,2), then head to (4,2), direction left? Last move was from (5,3) to (5,2) down, then to (4,2) left, so direction L.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut let's see where the food is.\n\n(2,1) is at bottom left, (1,6) top left.\n\n(4,6) is at top right but occupied.\n\nAfter moving, the snake body changes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going towards one of the foods.\n\nBut (2,1) is close to head? Head at (5,3), (2,1) is at x=2,y=1, so distance |dx|=3, |dy|=2, so not close.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) at x=1,y=6, |dx|=4, |dy|=3.\n\n(4,6) at x=4,y=6, |dx|=1, |dy|=3.\n\nBut (4,6) is occupied, so need to wait for it to be free.\n\nNow, the tail is at (5,5) after first move, as above.\n\nLet's think about the snake's body to see when (4,6) is free.\n\nOriginal snake: positions include (4,6) and (5,6), etc.\n\nAfter moving down to (5,2), positions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] so (4,6) is still occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I go right to (6,3), positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ], (4,6) occupied.\n\n(4,6) is the 13th segment, so it will take several moves before it's free.\n\nThe snake has 16 segments, so to free (4,6), it needs to move 13 times without growing? Since it's the 13th from head, when head moves 13 steps, that segment becomes the tail and moves away.\n\nBut each move, the position changes.\n\nFor example, from current, after k moves, the segment that was at (4,6) will be closer to tail.\n\nInitially, head index 0, tail 15 (since 16 segments, indices 0 to 15).\n\n(4,6) is at index 12 (0: (5,3), 1: (5,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (2,3), 6: (1,3), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,5), 9: (2,5), 10: (2,6), 11: (3,6), 12: (4,6), 13: (5,6), 14: (5,5), 15: (4,5))\n\nSo (4,6) is index 12.\n\nAfter each move without eating, the tail is removed, so the indices shift.\n\nAfter one move, head new, then body from old head to old second last, so index 12 becomes index 11 in new list, and so on, until after 4 moves, it would be index 8, etc., and after 12 moves, it would be the tail, and on the 13th move, it moves away.\n\nBut with movement, it's messy.\n\nSince the snake is long, it might be better to go towards the area with more space or towards food.\n\nNow, look at the grid.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nAlso, borders are walls.\n\nNow, head at (5,3), if I go down to (5,2), then as above, from (5,2) I can go L to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n\nIf I go R to (6,2), then from (6,2), last move was R or D? From (5,3) to (5,2) down, then to (6,2) right, so direction R.\n\nThen from (6,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R, cannot instant reverse, so since last move R, cannot go L (left).\n\nCan go U, D, R.\n\nGo U: to (6,3), but (6,3) is where? After moving to (6,2), positions depend.\n\nBut (6,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nFirst, after first move to (5,2), positions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n\nThen from (5,2) go R to (6,2): head to (6,2), new positions: [ (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ] tail at (5,6)? Second last was (5,5), but in list, after adding head (6,2), the body is (5,2), (5,3), ..., up to (5,6), and tail (5,6) since last was (5,6) and tail removed? Positions before move: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] so last is (5,5).\n\nAfter moving to (6,2), head (6,2), then body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and tail (5,5) removed, so new tail is (5,6).\n\nPositions: [ (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ]\n\nFrom (6,2), can go U to (6,3): (6,3) not wall, not body? Body positions: (5,2), (5,3), etc., no (6,3), so empty. Ok.\n\nGo D to (6,1): but (6,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so death. Cannot.\n\nGo R to (7,2): but x=7 is border wall, so death. Cannot.\n\nSo only U to (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, if from (5,2) I go L to (4,2), then similar.\n\nBut let's consider the other initial choice: go right to (6,3) at turn 88.\n\nThen head at (6,3), positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] tail at (5,5).\n\nFrom (6,3), last move R, so cannot go L (left).\n\nCan go U, D, R.\n\nGo U to (6,4): but (6,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so death. Cannot.\n\nGo D to (6,2): (6,2) not wall? Internal obstacles (6,1) and (6,4), not (6,2), so no. Not body, so ok.\n\nGo R to (7,3): x=7 wall, death. Cannot.\n\nSo only D to (6,2).\n\nThen from (6,2), as above, only U to (6,3), but (6,3) is the previous position? After moving to (6,2), positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), etc., so (6,3) is first body, so if go U to (6,3), it's body, collision.\n\nFrom (6,2), after moving from (6,3) to (6,2) down, so last move D, then from (6,2) can go U, D, L, R, but cannot instant reverse, so since last move D, cannot go U (up).\n\nCan go D, L, R.\n\nGo D to (6,1): wall, death.\n\nGo L to (5,2): (5,2) may or may not be body. After positions: with head at (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), ..., so (5,2) not occupied, so ok.\n\nGo R to (7,2): wall, death.\n\nSo can go L to (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is empty.\n\nNow, comparing the two initial moves:\n\n- If first move D to (5,2), then from there, I can go L to (4,2) or R to (6,2). If go R to (6,2), then only U to (6,3), which is safe.\n\n- If first move R to (6,3), then only D to (6,2), then from (6,2) can go L to (5,2) or other, but D and R invalid, only L to (5,2).\n\nSo essentially, from current, both D and R lead to similar positions after two moves.\n\nBut let's think about food.\n\nFood at (1,6) and (2,1).\n\n(1,6) is near the top left, where the snake has body at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (2,6), (3,6), etc.\n\n(2,1) is at bottom left, near (2,3) and (1,3), but (2,3) is body, etc.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (1,2), which is near (2,1).\n\n(2,1) at (2,1), obstacle at (1,2), so the area might be tight.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) food under body, but will be free later.\n\nLife span of (1,6) is 4, so must be eaten by turn 91.\n\nTurn 88 now, so turns 88,89,90,91 available, disappears before 92.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life span 7, up to turn 94.\n\n(4,6) life span 10, up to turn 97.\n\nNow, to reach (1,6) from current position.\n\nHead at (5,3), to (1,6): dx= -4, dy= +3, so need to go left and up.\n\nBut there are obstacles and snake body in the way.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), if I go left to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nSo must go down or right first.\n\nSimilarly, to (2,1): down and left.\n\nBut (2,1) is at y=1, and there is wall at y=0 and obstacle at (5,1), (6,1), etc.\n\nPerhaps (2,1) is easier to reach.\n\nFrom (5,3), go down to (5,2), then left to (4,2), then down to (4,1)? But y=1, and (4,1) not wall, but internal obstacles: (5,1), (6,1), not (4,1), so (4,1) is free.\n\nThen to (3,1), (2,1).\n\n(3,1) not occupied, etc.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (4,1) down, then to (3,1) left, then to (2,1) left.\n\nBut at (2,1), is it safe? And food there.\n\nBut need to check if path is clear.\n\nFirst, from head (5,3) go D to (5,2).\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go L to (4,2).\n\nThen from (4,2), last move L (left), so cannot go R (instant reverse).\n\nCan go U, D, L.\n\nGo U to (4,3): but (4,3) is body? After first move to (5,2), positions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] so (4,3) is occupied, body. So if go to (4,3), collision.\n\nGo D to (4,1): (4,1) not wall, not body, so ok.\n\nGo L to (3,2): (3,2) not wall, not body, so ok.\n\nSo from (4,2), can go D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nIf go D to (4,1), then from (4,1), can go to (3,1) left or (4,0) down, but y=0 wall, so (4,0) invalid. (5,1) is obstacle, but not adjacent. Can go U, D, L, R, but D to (4,0) wall, R to (5,1) obstacle wall, so only U or L.\n\nU to (4,2) but that's previous position, may be body soon, but let's see.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), positions: from previous, head was at (4,2), move D to (4,1), so new head (4,1), body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n\nSo (4,2) is first body.\n\nSo from (4,1), can go U to (4,2) but it's body, collision. Cannot.\n\nGo L to (3,1): not occupied, ok.\n\nGo R to (5,1): wall, death. Cannot.\n\nGo D to (4,0): wall, death. Cannot.\n\nSo only L to (3,1).\n\nThen from (3,1), to (2,1) left, etc.\n\nSimilarly, if from (4,2) go L to (3,2), then to (3,1) down, then to (2,1) left.\n\nBut let's not get too deep.\n\nFor (1,6), it's farther.\n\nAnother food at (4,6), which is currently occupied, but will be free after some moves.\n\nIndex 12, snake length 16, so after 4 moves without eating, it might be closer to tail.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger for future.\n\nCurrently no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should go towards the center or open area.\n\nGrid: top right has obstacles at (6,4), (6,1), etc.\n\nBottom left has (2,4) obstacle, (1,2) obstacle.\n\nOpen areas: for example, bottom right: x=3 to6, y=1 to3, but (5,1) and (6,1) obstacles, so not fully open.\n\nTop left: x=1 to3, y=4 to6, but (2,4) obstacle, and snake body there.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, and snake has (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), so around (2,4) is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) obstacle near (1,3) snake.\n\nSo the grid is a bit constrained.\n\nPerhaps moving down or right is better to avoid getting trapped.\n\nLet's consider the food at (1,6). If I can eat it within 4 turns.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (1,6): need to go left 4, up 3, but with body in way.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) go R to (6,3), then D to (6,2), then L to (5,2), but that's back, not progress.\n\nFrom (5,3) go D to (5,2), then L to (4,2), then L to (3,2), then U to (3,3), but (3,3) is body? After some moves.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 88: from (5,3) go D to (5,2). Positions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n\nTurn 89: from (5,2), last move D, can go L to (4,2) or R to (6,2). Say go L to (4,2). Positions: [ (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ] tail (5,5) removed, tail at (5,6).\n\n(5,5) was tail, removed, new tail (5,6).\n\nNow head at (4,2), last move L, so cannot go R.\n\nCan go U, D, L.\n\nGo U to (4,3): but (4,3) is body, collision. Cannot.\n\nGo D to (4,1): ok, as before.\n\nGo L to (3,2): ok.\n\nSay go L to (3,2). Positions: [ (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ] tail at (5,6)? Second last was (4,6), last was (5,6), removed, new tail (4,6).\n\nPositions: head (3,2), body (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nTail at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) has food, and it's the tail.\n\nNow head at (3,2), tail at (4,6), not adjacent.\n\nTurn 90: from (3,2), last move L, so cannot go R.\n\nCan go U, D, L.\n\nGo U to (3,3): but (3,3) is body, collision. Cannot.\n\nGo D to (3,1): not wall, not body, ok.\n\nGo L to (2,2): (2,2) not wall? Internal obstacles (1,2), not (2,2), so no. Not body, so ok.\n\nSay go D to (3,1). Positions: [ (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ] tail (4,6) removed, new tail (3,6).\n\n(4,6) was tail with food, but since tail moved, food is now exposed at (4,6), but head is at (3,1), far away.\n\nLife span 10, so ok.\n\nFrom (3,1), can go to (2,1) left, for example.\n\n(2,1) has food.\n\nTurn 91: from (3,1), last move D, so cannot go U.\n\nCan go D, L, R.\n\nGo D to (3,0): y=0 wall, death. Cannot.\n\nGo L to (2,1): (2,1) has food, and not occupied, so move there, eat food, snake grows.\n\nGo R to (4,1): (4,1) not occupied, ok, but not food.\n\nSo can go L to (2,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I want to go to (1,6).\n\nBut from current, it might be tight.\n\nAnother option: go right first.\n\nTurn 88: go R to (6,3). Positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ]\n\nTurn 89: from (6,3), only D to (6,2) as before. Positions: [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ] tail (5,5) removed, tail at (5,6).\n\nTurn 90: from (6,2), last move D, cannot go U.\n\nCan go L to (5,2) or D or R, but D and R invalid, only L to (5,2). Positions: [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ] tail (5,6) removed, tail at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) has food, tail.\n\nHead at (5,2), last move L, so cannot go R.\n\nCan go U, D, L.\n\nGo U to (5,3): body, collision. Cannot.\n\nGo D to (5,1): wall, death. Cannot.\n\nGo L to (4,2): not occupied, ok.\n\nSo go L to (4,2). Positions: [ (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ] tail (4,6) removed, new tail (3,6).\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nTo reach (1,6), from here head at (4,2), need to go left and up, but body at (3,3), (2,3), etc.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) go L to (3,2), then U to (3,3), but (3,3) body, cannot.\n\nGo U to (4,3), body, cannot.\n\nFrom (4,2), only L or D, as before.\n\nGo L to (3,2), then from (3,2) can go U to (3,3) body, or D to (3,1), or L to (2,2).\n\nIf go L to (2,2), then to (2,1) D, but (2,1) food.\n\nOr to (1,2) L, but (1,2) obstacle, wall.\n\nFrom (2,2), can go U to (2,3), but body, or D to (2,1), or L to (1,2) wall, or R to (3,2) previous.\n\nSo to (2,1) is possible.\n\nBut for (1,6), it's harder.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), and snake has (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), so (1,6) is adjacent to (1,5).\n\nTo eat (1,6), head must move to (1,6) when it's free.\n\nCurrently (1,6) has food and is free, but head is far.\n\nIf I can navigate to it.\n\nFor example, from current position, if I go down then left, I might go to bottom, but to go up, it might be blocked.\n\nSince the snake is long, moving in the bottom might be risky if space is tight.\n\nBut y=1 has cells, but obstacles.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps go towards the food at (4,6) when it's free.\n\nCurrently at turn 88, (4,6) is index 12, after 4 moves without eating, it becomes index 8 or something, still body.\n\nAfter 12 moves, it becomes tail.\n\nBut with movement, it changes position.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves, the segment moves.\n\nBut the food is at fixed position (4,6), so when the snake moves away from it, it becomes free.\n\nIn the current position, (4,6) is occupied by body.\n\nAs the snake moves, that cell will be vacated when the segment that is there moves away.\n\nSince the snake is moving, the cell (4,6) will be empty when the segment at (4,6) moves to another cell.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves down or right, the body at (4,6) will move to where the previous segment was, but it's messy.\n\nThe cell (4,6) will be free when the snake has moved enough that no segment is there.\n\nFrom the list, (4,6) is the position of the 12th segment.\n\nAfter one move, if no eat, the 12th segment moves to where the 11th was, and (4,6) is vacated only if no new segment comes, but since no growth, the tail is removed, so the positions shift.\n\nAfter one move from turn 88, say to (5,2), positions include (4,6) still, as we saw.\n\nAfter two moves, to (4,2), positions: [ (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ] so (4,6) still occupied.\n\nAfter three moves, to (3,2), positions: [ (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ] still (4,6).\n\nAfter four moves, to (3,1), positions: [ (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ] now (4,6) is gone, new positions, (4,6) not in list, so free.\n\nIn this sequence, after four moves, at turn 92, (4,6) is free.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 88 move D to (5,2), turn 89 move L to (4,2), turn 90 move L to (3,2), turn 91 move D to (3,1), then at turn 92, positions as above, (4,6) free.\n\nLife span of (4,6) is 10, from turn 88 to 97, so at turn 92, it is still there.\n\nThen head is at (3,1), which is far from (4,6).\n\nTo reach (4,6) from (3,1), need to go up and right.\n\nBut there might be body in the way.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) to (4,6): dx=1, dy=5, not direct.\n\nPossible path: (3,1) to (3,2) U, but (3,2) is previous position, may be body.\n\nAt turn 91 head at (3,1), positions include (3,2) as first body? From above, after move to (3,1), positions: [ (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ]\n\nSo (3,2) is body.\n\nSo from (3,1), can go to (2,1) L or (3,0) D wall, or (4,1) R, but (4,1) not occupied, so can go R to (4,1).\n\nThen to (4,2) U, but (4,2) is body, etc.\n\nIt might take several turns to reach (4,6), and by then, the food might be gone or something.\n\nBut life span 10, so up to turn 97.\n\nBut other food might be easier.\n\nPerhaps for the current turn, since both D and R are similar, I can choose one.\n\nBut let's see the food at (1,6) with life span 4.\n\nIt must be eaten by turn 91.\n\nTurn 88,89,90,91.\n\nFrom current position, can I reach (1,6) in 3 moves? From (5,3) to (1,6): min moves 7, impossible in 3.\n\nIn 4 moves? 4 moves from turn 88 to 91.\n\nTurn 88 move, 89,90,91 move, so 4 moves.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (1,6): dx=4 left, dy=3 up, so 7 cells, but with diagonals not allowed, min Manhattan distance 7, so at least 7 moves, cannot in 4.\n\nManhattan distance |5-1| + |3-6| =4+3=7, so at least 7 moves required, but we have only 4 moves to turn 91 for eating, so impossible to reach (1,6) by turn 91.\n\nTurn 91 is the last turn to eat, since life span 4, available turns 88,89,90,91.\n\nBut from turn 88 start, after 4 moves, at turn 92, it's gone.\n\nAt turn 88, before move, food available, after move, if eaten, ok.\n\nBut head at (5,3), (1,6) not adjacent, so cannot eat on turn 88.\n\nSimilarly, after moves, the distance is large.\n\nFor example, after one move to (5,2), distance to (1,6) |5-1| + |2-6| =4+4=8.\n\nAfter to (4,2), |4-1| + |2-6| =3+4=7.\n\nStill far.\n\nSo cannot reach by turn 91, so (1,6) cannot be eaten, it will disappear.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) can be eaten, life span 7.\n\n(4,6) can be eaten later.\n\nSo for now, I should go for (2,1).\n\nFrom current, go down to (5,2), then left to (4,2), then down to (4,1), then left to (3,1), then left to (2,1).\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\nTurn 88: go D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 89: from (5,2), go L to (4,2)  (since last move D, can go L)\n\nTurn 90: from (4,2), last move L, can go D to (4,1) (U and L may not be good, U to (4,3) body, L to (3,2) but D to (4,1) is direct to bottom)\n\nTurn 91: from (4,1), last move D, can go L to (3,1) (only choice, as before)\n\nTurn 92: from (3,1), can go L to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 92, (2,1) life span 7 from turn 88, available up to turn 94, so ok.\n\nBut on turn 92, head at (3,1), go L to (2,1), eat food, snake grows, so new tail added.\n\nNow, for the current action, I need to output the sequence starting from turn 88.\n\nBut I need to output actions for turn 88,89,etc.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions for multiple turns, but how many? The instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to output a sequence for several turns.\n\nBut I don't know how many; perhaps until a decision point or something.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can plan a path to the food.\n\nBut to avoid risk, going to (2,1) might be safe.\n\nFrom (5,3) go R to (6,3), then D to (6,2), then L to (5,2), then D to (5,1) but wall, cannot, so from (5,2) go L to (4,2), etc., similar path but longer.\n\nSo going down first is shorter.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (4,6) that I can eat later.\n\nFor now, let's output a sequence to eat (2,1).\n\nTurn 88: go D to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 89: from (5,2) go L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 90: from (4,2) go D to (4,1)\n\nTurn 91: from (4,1) go L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 92: from (3,1) go L to (2,1) eat\n\nBut after eating, the snake grows, so positions change.\n\nBut for the action sequence, I need to specify up to turn 92 or so.\n\nThe think ahead is for planning, but output can be for the immediate turns.\n\nThe instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" to prioritize long-term, but the output format shows multiple turns, so I should output a sequence for about 5 turns.\n\nSince turn 88, output actions for turn 88 to 92 or 93.\n\nIn this case, from turn 88 to 92.\n\nBut on turn 92, I eat the food.\n\nAlso, need to consider if the path is safe.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) to (3,1), then to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) has food, and when I move to it, I eat and grow.\n\nIs there any risk? For example, when at (3,1), the cells around.\n\n(2,1) is free, no body or wall.\n\nAfter eating, the snake is longer, but I can then plan to go to other areas.\n\nFor example, after eating at (2,1), head at (2,1), then I can go up to (2,2), etc., to go to (4,6) or other.\n\nBut let's first output the actions.\n\nSo for turn 88: action D\n\nThen turn 89: from there, action L\n\nBut I need to specify based on the state after previous moves.\n\nIn the sequence, I must consider the direction for no instant reverse.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nTurn 88: from (5,3) dir D, go D to (5,2), new dir D\n\nTurn 89: from (5,2) dir D, last move D, can go L to (4,2), new dir L\n\nTurn 90: from (4,2) dir L, last move L, can go D to (4,1), new dir D\n\nTurn 91: from (4,1) dir D, last move D, can go L to (3,1), new dir L\n\nTurn 92: from (3,1) dir L, last move L, can go L to (2,1)? (2,1) is left from (3,1), so L, but last move L, going L is not reverse, reverse would be R.\n\nCan go L, U, D.\n\nGo L to (2,1) to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nFrom turn 92, I can continue.\n\nBut for output, perhaps up to turn 92.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, from turn 88 to 93 or so.\n\nBut turn 93 is after eating.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (4,6) will be free around turn 92, as in earlier simulation, but head is at (2,1), far.\n\nBut I can eat (2,1) first, then go to (4,6).\n\nLife span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to area where (4,6) is, but it might not be free yet.\n\nFor example, if I go up from current, but I cannot because body.\n\nSo the path to bottom is better.\n\nTherefore, I think going for (2,1) is a good plan.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 88: D\n\nTurn 89: L (to (4,2))\n\nTurn 90: D (to (4,1))\n\nTurn 91: L (to (3,1))\n\nTurn 92: L (to (2,1) eat)\n\nBut at turn 92, I eat, so for the sequence, I can stop or continue.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, from 88 to 93, but turn 93 is after.\n\nPerhaps output for turns 88 to 92.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 89 action depends on state after turn 88, but in the output, I specify the actions sequentially.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be fine.\n\nTo be precise, let's write the sequence.\n\nAlso, for the current turn, only one action, but since I need to think ahead, I output multiple.\n\nBut in the box, it should be the actions.\n\nNow, another point: at (4,5), food with life span 1, but impossible to eat, so ignore.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) impossible.\n\n(4,6) can be eaten later.\n\nSo for now, this plan seems good.\n\nPerhaps from current, I can go right, but it takes longer to reach (2,1), so down is better.\n\nSo I think D for turn 88.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nHead at (5,3), dir D, go D to (5,2).\n\nThen from there, go L to (4,2), etc.\n\nIn the sequence, I have turn 89 L, but when I output, I need to specify the action for each turn.\n\nIn the state after turn 88, head at (5,2), dir D, then possible actions include L and R, I choose L.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 88: D\n\nTurn 89: L\n\nTurn 90: D\n\nTurn 91: L\n\nTurn 92: L\n\nBut turn 92 is L to (2,1), which is eating.\n\nTo make it 5 turns, I can add turn 93, but after eating, from (2,1) dir L, can go U to (2,2) or L to (1,1) but (1,1) may be wall or not, x=1,y=1, not border, but (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) free? But y=1, x=1.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) not listed, so free.\n\nBut I can go U to (2,2), for example.\n\nBut not necessary for now.\n\nSo output up to turn 92.\n\nBut the thinking is 5+ turns, so 5 actions from turn 88 to 92.\n\nYes.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State Overview:**\n- **Turn**: 88\n- **Snake Head**: (5,3), direction D (down)\n- **Snake Length**: 16 segments\n- **Walls**: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,5): value +1, life span 1 (disappears after turn 88)\n  - (1,6): value +1, life span 4 (disappears after turn 91)\n  - (2,1): value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 94)\n  - (4,6): value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 97)\n\n**Immediate Constraints and Risks:**\n- **Current Moves (Turn 88)**: From (5,3) with direction D, cannot reverse to U (up). Possible moves:\n  - D (down) to (5,2): Safe (no wall or body).\n  - R (right) to (6,3): Safe (no wall or body).\n  - L (left) to (4,3): Invalid (body collision at (4,3)).\n- **Food at (4,5)**: Under tail, but head not adjacent. Impossible to eat this turn due to distance (Manhattan distance 2, requires 2 moves) and life span 1 (disappears after this turn). Ignore.\n- **Food at (1,6)**: Manhattan distance from (5,3) is 7. With only 4 turns to eat (by turn 91), it is unreachable. Ignore.\n- **Food at (2,1)**: Viable target (life span 7). Path requires ~5 moves with low risk.\n- **Food at (4,6)**: Under body, will become free in ~4 turns. Can be targeted after eating (2,1).\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Primary Goal**: Eat (2,1) by turn 92 to maximize score and growth. Path: (5,3) → (5,2) → (4,2) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1). This avoids walls and body collisions.\n- **Secondary Goal**: After eating (2,1), navigate towards (4,6) or other areas. The grid has constraints (obstacles, borders), so prioritize open areas.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Avoid bottom row (y=1) near obstacles (e.g., (5,1), (6,1)) and top-left near (2,4) obstacle.\n  - Ensure no dead ends; after eating (2,1), move up to open space.\n  - Tail reward danger not an issue; head not adjacent to tail during plan.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 88-92):**\n- **Turn 88 (Start)**: Move D to (5,2). Safe, progresses toward (2,1). No food eaten.\n- **Turn 89**: From (5,2) with direction D, last move D. Cannot reverse to U. Move L to (4,2). Safe, continues path. No food.\n- **Turn 90**: From (4,2) with direction L (last move L). Cannot reverse to R. Move D to (4,1). Safe, no food. Avoids body at (4,3).\n- **Turn 91**: From (4,1) with direction D (last move D). Cannot reverse to U. Only valid move is L to (3,1) (D to (4,0) wall, R to (5,1) wall, U to (4,2) body). Safe, no food.\n- **Turn 92**: From (3,1) with direction L (last move L). Cannot reverse to R. Move L to (2,1). Eats food (+1, snake grows to 17). Safe, no collision.\n\n**Post-Plan (Beyond Turn 92):**\n- After eating (2,1), head at (2,1), direction L. Options: U to (2,2) or L to (1,1) (but (1,1) near obstacle (1,2); U preferred for open space). Target (4,6) next (life span until turn 97).\n\nThis sequence maximizes score by securing (2,1) and positions for future food, with risk minimized through path validation.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 88: D \\\\\nTurn 89: L \\\\\nTurn 90: D \\\\\nTurn 91: L \\\\\nTurn 92: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 89. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So, I should avoid those cells.\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head at (5,2), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5). The head direction is down, which is D, meaning (x,y-1). Since direction is D, moving down decreases y.\n\nHead is at (5,2), direction D, so previous move was down to (5,2). Now, for the next move, I need to choose U, D, L, or R, but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is D, I cannot move up (U) immediately because that would be reverse. So possible moves from (5,2) are: down (D) to (5,1), left (L) to (4,2), or right (R) to (6,2). But I have to check if these cells are safe.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (1,6) with value 1 and life span 4. So it disappears after turn 89 + 4 = 93? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 89, life span is 4, meaning it will be there for 4 more turns including turn 89. After turn 89, life span becomes 3, then 2, then 1, then 0 at turn 93, so it disappears after turn 92? Let's clarify.\n\nThe problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L. For example, if L=1, it disappears after this turn, so only on turn t. If L=2, present on t and t+1, gone at t+2.\n\nHere, at turn 89, food at (1,6) has life_span 4, so it will be present on turns 89, 90, 91, 92, and disappear at turn 93.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) with value 1, life_span 6, so present until turn 89+6-1=94, gone at 95? Let's calculate: life_span 6 at turn 89, so countdown: 6 on turn 89, 5 on 90, 4 on 91, 3 on 92, 2 on 93, 1 on 94, gone at turn 95.\n\nGeneral: with life_span L at turn t, it disappears at turn t + L. For (1,6): L=4, t=89, disappears at 89+4=93.\n\nFor (2,1): L=6, disappears at 89+6=95.\n\nAnother food: (4,6) with value 1, life_span 9, disappears at 89+9=98.\n\nAll foods have value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, snake positions: head at (5,2), body segments follow. Let's list all positions to understand the shape.\n\nSnake positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\nLength is 16 segments.\n\nHead at (5,2), which is above (5,3) since y=2 < y=3, so moving down to (5,2) from (5,3) I think. Positions are head first, so from head to tail: (5,2) head, then (5,3), (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), etc.\n\nLet me plot this on a grid mentally. Grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, but walls at borders, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (6,1) is listed twice? No: obstacles are [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. So (6,1) is an obstacle, and (5,1) is also an obstacle.\n\n(5,1) is an obstacle, which is below the head at (5,2). Head at (5,2), moving down to (5,1) would hit the obstacle or wall? (5,1) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall cell, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is obstacle, (1,2) obstacle, etc.\n\nNow, possible moves from head (5,2) with direction D (down):\n\n- Down (D) to (5,1): but (5,1) is an obstacle, so not possible. Also, y=1, but since walls are at y=0, y=1 is playable, but (5,1) is specifically an internal obstacle, so blocked.\n\n- Left (L) to (4,2): need to check if this cell is free and safe.\n\n- Right (R) to (6,2): check if free and safe.\n\n- Up (U) to (5,3): but current direction is D, so moving up would be reverse, not allowed. Also, (5,3) is the second segment of the snake, so it would be a body collision immediately if I move there.\n\nLet's confirm: snake positions: index 0: (5,2) head, index 1: (5,3), which is directly above the head. So if I move up to (5,3), that's the body, so collision, death. But since current direction is D, moving U is reverse, which is not allowed anyway. So only possible moves are L to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n\nNow, check (4,2): is it occupied by snake or wall?\n\nSnake positions: let's list all to avoid: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\n(4,2) is not in this list. Walls: internal obstacles include (5,1), (6,1), etc., but (4,2) is not listed as obstacle, and not border, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2): not in snake positions? Snake has (5,2), (5,3), etc., no (6,2). Obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), but (6,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,2) is different.\n\nAlso, walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is playable since x=7 is wall, x from 1 to 6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6 are playable.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, y=1 to 6 playable.\n\nSo (4,2) and (6,2) seem free.\n\nBut I need to think ahead for multiple turns, not just one.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is one of the snake positions? Snake positions include (4,6), which is the 14th segment? Let's index: position 0: (5,2) head, 1: (5,3), 2: (5,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (2,3), 7: (1,3), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (2,6), 12: (3,6), 13: (4,6), 14: (5,6), 15: (5,5) tail.\n\nSo (4,6) is occupied by the snake at index 13. But food is at (4,6), with value 1 and life span 9.\n\nFood can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nCurrently, (4,6) has a body segment, so the food is there but not eatable until the snake moves away.\n\nSimilarly, other foods.\n\nNow, for the immediate move, from (5,2), I can go L to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider the grid state.\n\nList all occupied cells: snake and obstacles.\n\nSnake: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nObstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nFood: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6) but (4,6) is under snake body.\n\n(1,6) is a food position, but is it occupied? Snake has (2,6) at index 11, (3,6) index 12, etc., (1,6) not listed, so free cell with food.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is food position, not occupied, but (2,1) is it obstacle? Obstacles include (2,4), (5,1), etc., (2,1) not listed, so free with food.\n\n(4,6) has food but occupied.\n\nNow, head at (5,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- L to (4,2)\n\n- R to (6,2)\n\nD to (5,1) not possible, obstacle.\n\nU not possible, reverse.\n\nNow, if I move L to (4,2), then new head position (4,2), direction L (since left).\n\nThen from there, possible moves: since moved left, cannot go right immediately. Possible: up to (4,3), down to (4,1), left to (3,2), right not allowed.\n\n(4,3) is snake body? Snake positions: (4,3) is index 4, which is a body segment. After moving head to (4,2), the snake will move, so tail moves, but let's see the new positions.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten yet, when head moves to (4,2), the new positions: head (4,2), then previous head (5,2) becomes body, so (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), ..., up to (5,5), but since tail moves, (5,5) is removed? Let's see the list.\n\nCurrent positions: indices 0 to 15: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n\nAfter moving left to (4,2), new head is (4,2), then body segments: the first body segment is the previous head (5,2), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and tail (5,5) is removed. Since no food, length same, tail removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). The tail (5,5) is gone, so positions from (5,6) to end, but (5,6) was index 14, now it becomes the tail.\n\nPrevious positions: 0:(5,2), 1:(5,3), 2:(5,4), 3:(4,4), 4:(4,3), 5:(3,3), 6:(2,3), 7:(1,3), 8:(1,4), 9:(1,5), 10:(2,5), 11:(2,6), 12:(3,6), 13:(4,6), 14:(5,6), 15:(5,5)\n\nAfter move to (4,2), new head (4,2), then body: previous 0 to 14 become body segments 1 to 15, but since no growth, the last segment is removed, so new body has segments from previous 0 to 14: (5,2) to (5,6), but (5,6) was index 14, and index 15 (5,5) removed.\n\nSo new snake: [ (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ]\n\nLength 16, same as before.\n\nNow, at (4,2), head, and direction is L (left).\n\nPossible moves from (4,2): U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2) but cannot, because reverse from left direction.\n\nCurrent direction after move is left, so cannot go right immediately.\n\nNow, (4,3) is in the new body positions: index 5? New positions: 0:(4,2) head, 1:(5,2), 2:(5,3), 3:(5,4), 4:(4,4), 5:(4,3), ... so (4,3) is index 5, body segment. If I move up to (4,3), it would be collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1): is it free? y=1, not wall, but obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not listed, so should be free. Also not in snake positions.\n\n(3,2): not in snake positions, not obstacle.\n\nSo from (4,2), possible moves: D to (4,1) or L to (3,2). U not possible, collision; R not possible, reverse.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved right from start to (6,2), let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to choose the first move.\n\nBut I must think multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there is food to consider.\n\nFood at (1,6): life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 92 to get it.\n\n(2,1): life span 6, by turn 94.\n\n(4,6): under body, life span 9, so can be eaten later if body moves away.\n\n(4,6) is currently occupied by body, and it will move when the snake moves.\n\nIn the new positions after any move, (4,6) might still be occupied or not.\n\nIn the case where I move left to (4,2), the snake positions include (4,6) at index 14 or something, still occupied.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the tail position for \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n\nThe tail is at (5,5) currently.\n\nAfter moving, if I go left, new tail is (5,6).\n\nIf I go right, new head at (6,2), then new positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), and (5,5) removed, so tail is (5,6).\n\nNow, food at (1,6) is near the tail or something.\n\nBut let's think about the map.\n\nI should sketch a grid.\n\nLet me make a mental grid. Rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nAlso, walls at borders, but borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells outside 1-6 are walls.\n\nNow, snake positions:\nHead (5,2)\nThen (5,3)\n(5,4)\n(4,4)\n(4,3)\n(3,3)\n(2,3)\n(1,3)\n(1,4)\n(1,5)\n(2,5)\n(2,6)\n(3,6)\n(4,6)\n(5,6)\nTail (5,5)\n\nSo the snake is like: from (5,2) down to (5,3)? (5,2) to (5,3) is down? y=2 to y=3 is increasing y, so down if we consider y increasing down, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so U increases y, D decreases y.\n\nIn coordinate, typically y=0 at top, y increasing down, so U (up) decreases y, D (down) increases y? Let's check the movement definition.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1) — that means y increases when going up? That might be counterintuitive.\n\nLet's see: \"U`(x,y+1)`\" so U: x same, y+1. If y=0 is top, y+1 is down, but usually in grids, y=0 top, y increasing down, so U should be y-1 for up.\n\nBut here it says U (x,y+1), so it means that y increases in the upward direction, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top? But walls at y=0 and y=7, and border cells given.\n\nIn the state, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom or top? It doesn't specify, but from movement, U (x,y+1) means moving up increases y, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nSimilarly, D (x,y-1) decreases y, so moving down.\n\nIn positions, head at (5,2), with direction D, which is down, so to (x,y-1), so from (5,3) to (5,2), since y decreased from 3 to 2.\n\ny=2 to y=3 is up, so from (5,3) to (5,2) is down, so y=2 is below y=3.\n\nSo y increases as we go down, y decreases as we go up.\n\nSo in the grid, y=0 is bottom, y=7 top; but walls at y=0 and y=7, so playable y=1 to 6, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top? y=1 is bottom since y=0 is wall below, y=7 wall above.\n\nSimilarly for x: x=0 left, x=7 right walls, so x=1 to 6 playable.\n\nSo bottom-left is (1,1), top-right (6,6).\n\nSnake head at (5,2): x=5, y=2, which is near bottom.\n\nBody: (5,3) y=3, above (5,2) since y higher, so (5,3) is north of (5,2).\n\nThen (5,4) north of (5,3).\n\nThen (4,4) west of (5,4), same y.\n\nThen (4,3) south of (4,4), y=3 to y=4? (4,4) to (4,3) is south, y decrease.\n\nPositions: after (5,4), to (4,4), then to (4,3), which is south to y=3.\n\nThen (4,3) to (3,3) west.\n\nThen (3,3) to (2,3) west.\n\nThen (2,3) to (1,3) west.\n\nThen (1,3) to (1,4) north.\n\nThen (1,4) to (1,5) north.\n\nThen (1,5) to (2,5) east.\n\nThen (2,5) to (2,6) north.\n\nThen (2,6) to (3,6) east.\n\nThen (3,6) to (4,6) east.\n\nThen (4,6) to (5,6) east.\n\nThen (5,6) to (5,5) south.\n\nTail at (5,5).\n\nFood at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n\n(4,6) is occupied by snake, as position 13.\n\n(1,6) is free, at top-left.\n\n(2,1) is bottom-left, but (2,1) is not obstacle, and not occupied.\n\n(2,1) food, value 1.\n\nBack to moves.\n\nFrom head (5,2), direction D, possible moves: L to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n\nIf I go L to (4,2), as I thought earlier.\n\nFrom (4,2), direction L, then possible moves: D to (4,1) or L to (3,2) or U to (4,3) but U to (4,3) is body collision, so only D or L.\n\n(4,1): is it free? y=1, bottom, not wall, obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not listed, so free. Also not in snake positions.\n\n(3,2): not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nIf I go D to (4,1), then new head (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: since direction D, cannot go U. L to (3,1), R to (5,1), but (5,1) is obstacle, so not possible. D to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, not possible. So only L to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) should be free.\n\nThen from (3,1), and so on.\n\nIf from (4,2) I go L to (3,2), then head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U to (3,3), but (3,3) is body? After moving to (3,2), the snake positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc. (3,3) is previous body, but after move, it might be different.\n\nLet's not get too deep yet.\n\nSimilarly, if I go right from start to (6,2).\n\nFrom (5,2) R to (6,2), new head (6,2), direction R.\n\nThen from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2) but reverse not allowed, R to (7,2) wall not possible.\n\nD to (6,1): but (6,1) is obstacle, not possible. U to (6,3): is it free? (6,3) not in obstacles, not in snake positions? Snake has (6,2) new head, (5,2), etc., no (6,3). Obstacles: (6,4) and (6,1), but (6,3) not, so free.\n\nSo from (6,2), only U to (6,3) possible, since D not possible, L reverse, R wall.\n\nThen to (6,3), and so on.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and survival.\n\nFood at (2,1) with life span 6, so I have time, but it's at (2,1), bottom-left.\n\nFood at (1,6) with life span 4, at top-left, must be eaten soon.\n\n(1,6) is at top-left, and the snake has segments near there, like (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,6), etc.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (5,5), and if I move, it changes.\n\nBut there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail at (5,5), head at (5,2), not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x, y±1 or same y, x±1.\n\n(5,2) and (5,5) have same x, but y difference 3, not adjacent.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, for the food at (1,6), it can be eaten if I move the head there when it's free.\n\nCurrently, (1,6) is free, no snake or obstacle.\n\nTo reach (1,6) from current position.\n\nHead at (5,2), (1,6) is far.\n\nPath might be through left or up.\n\nBut I have to avoid obstacles and body.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, so at (1,2) cannot go.\n\nAlso, (2,4) obstacle.\n\nTo go to (1,6), I could go left and up.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), if I go L to (4,2), then to (3,2), then to (2,2), but (2,2) is free? Not occupied, not obstacle. Then to (2,3), but (2,3) is body segment currently.\n\nBut after moves, it might move.\n\nLet's think of a plan to eat the food at (1,6) since it has short life.\n\nLife span 4, so by turn 92.\n\nCurrent turn 89, so I have 4 turns to eat it, including this turn? At turn 89, I can move to eat if possible, but not adjacent yet.\n\nHead at (5,2), (1,6) is not adjacent.\n\nDistance: Δx=4, Δy=4, so Manhattan distance 8, too far to reach in one turn.\n\nI need to move towards it.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFrom (5,2), if I go L to (4,2), then to (3,2), then to (2,2), then to (2,3) but (2,3) is currently body, but after some moves, it might be free.\n\nThe body moves as the snake moves.\n\nSimilarly, tail moves.\n\nSo I need to simulate the path.\n\nSince the snake is long, the tail will follow.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (4,6) is under the body, but if I move the snake such that the body moves away, I can eat it later.\n\n(4,6) has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\n(2,1) has life span 6, also time.\n\n(1,6) has only 4 turns.\n\nSo priority to eat (1,6) if possible.\n\nBut is it possible to reach (1,6) in few turns?\n\nFrom (5,2) to (1,6): one path could be left to (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), then (2,3) but (2,3) is occupied now, or (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, so cannot go to (1,2).\n\n(2,2) to (1,2) not possible, obstacle.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can go up to (2,3) or down to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) is body.\n\nAfter some moves, the body at (2,3) will move when the head moves.\n\nFor example, if I move head to (4,2), then the tail moves, so the body at (2,3) might stay or move depending.\n\nLet's simulate a few turns.\n\nSuppose at turn 89, I move L to (4,2).\n\nThen new snake: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)  -- tail (5,6)\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow turn 90, from (4,2), I can move D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nIf I move L to (3,2), then new head (3,2), body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)  -- tail (4,6) or (5,6) removed, so up to (4,6)\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then previous head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nTail (4,6)\n\nDirection L again.\n\nNow at (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), but (3,3) is body, collision; D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) but reverse not allowed.\n\n(3,3) is body, so U not possible.\n\nD to (3,1): free? Not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nL to (2,2): free? (2,2) not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nSo possible D or L.\n\nIf I want to go to (1,6), I should go left, so L to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 91, move L to (2,2), new head (2,2), body: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)  -- tail (3,6) or something, previous tail (4,6) removed.\n\nPositions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nTail (3,6)\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but reverse not allowed.\n\nL to (1,2): but (1,2) is obstacle, not possible.\n\nU to (2,3): (2,3) is body segment, currently index 9 in new list? Positions: 0:(2,2) head, 1:(3,2), 2:(4,2), 3:(5,2), 4:(5,3), 5:(5,4), 6:(4,4), 7:(4,3), 8:(3,3), 9:(2,3), ... so (2,3) is index 9, body. If I move U to (2,3), collision.\n\nD to (2,1): free? (2,1) is food position, not occupied by snake, not obstacle, so free.\n\nSo only possible move D to (2,1).\n\nThen turn 92, move D to (2,1), new head (2,1), and since I move to food, I eat it, so length increases, tail not removed.\n\nNew positions: head (2,1), then previous head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) and tail not removed, so length 17 now.\n\nDirection D.\n\nBut I am at (2,1), which is the food, so I eat it, score +1, length +1.\n\nBut (1,6) food is still there, but I didn't reach it; I went to (2,1) instead.\n\nIn this path, at turn 91, I was at (2,2), and I had to go to (2,1) because other moves not possible.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), I am at (2,2) at turn 91, which is not close.\n\nAt turn 91, (1,6) is still there, life span was 4 at turn 89, so at turn 90, life span 3, turn 91 life span 2, so present at turn 91.\n\nBut from (2,2) at turn 91, I moved to (2,1), not towards (1,6).\n\nTo reach (1,6), from earlier points.\n\nFor example, at turn 90, after moving to (3,2), I could have moved D to (3,1) instead of L to (2,2).\n\nBut (3,1) is not closer to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at top-left.\n\nAnother path: from head (5,2), if I go right to (6,2).\n\nThen at turn 89, move R to (6,2).\n\nNew snake: head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)  -- tail (5,6)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 90, from (6,2), only possible move U to (6,3), since D to (6,1) obstacle, L reverse, R wall.\n\nMove U to (6,3), new head (6,3), body: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)  -- tail (5,6) or (4,6)? Previous tail (5,6), removed, so up to (4,6)\n\nPositions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nTail (4,6)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4), but (6,4) is obstacle, not possible; D to (6,2) reverse not allowed; L to (5,3), R to (7,3) wall not possible.\n\nL to (5,3): (5,3) is body segment? Positions: 0:(6,3) head, 1:(6,2), 2:(5,2), 3:(5,3), so (5,3) is index 3, body. If I move to (5,3), collision.\n\nNo possible moves? U obstacle, D reverse, R wall, L body collision. Dead end?\n\n(6,3) to (5,3) is left, but (5,3) is occupied.\n\nOther cells: (6,4) obstacle, (6,2) behind, (7,3) wall, (5,3) body.\n\nSo no safe move from (6,3). That means if I go right at turn 89, by turn 90 I am at (6,3) with no safe move, so I die.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (6,2) is fatal because it leads to a dead end at (6,3).\n\nSo I must not go right; only left to (4,2) is possible.\n\nAt turn 89, only left move is safe.\n\nSo I should move L to (4,2) at turn 89.\n\nThen at turn 90, from (4,2), I can move D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nIf I move L to (3,2), as before, then at turn 91 to (2,2), then turn 92 to (2,1) to eat the food there.\n\n(2,1) food has life span 6, at turn 89 life span 6, so at turn 92, life span 3, still there.\n\nAt turn 92, I eat (2,1), so I get food.\n\nBut (1,6) food has life span 4 at turn 89, so at turn 92, it would be gone? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 89: life span 4 for (1,6), so present on 89,90,91,92, gone at 93.\n\nAt turn 92, it is still present, but I am at (2,1), not at (1,6).\n\nCan I reach (1,6) by turn 92?\n\nFrom turn 89: at (5,2)\n\nTurn 89: move to (4,2)\n\nTurn 90: from (4,2), if I move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 91: from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2) or D to (3,1)\n\nIf L to (2,2), as before.\n\nFrom (3,2), if I move D to (3,1), then new head (3,1), body (3,2), (4,2), etc.\n\nThen from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2) reverse not allowed (direction down? After moving down to (3,1), direction D, so cannot go U.\n\nL to (2,1), R to (4,1), D to (3,0) wall.\n\n(2,1) and (4,1) are both free? (2,1) is food, free; (4,1) free.\n\nSo can go L or R.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), not helpful.\n\nFrom (3,2) at turn 91, if I go L to (2,2), then at turn 92 from (2,2) only D to (2,1), cannot go to (1,6).\n\nSo I cannot reach (1,6) by turn 92 from this path.\n\nAt turn 90, from (4,2), instead of L to (3,2), I could move D to (4,1).\n\nThen at turn 90, move D to (4,1), new head (4,1), body (4,2), (5,2), etc.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 91, from (4,1), possible moves: L to (3,1), R to (5,1) but (5,1) obstacle, not possible; U to (4,2) reverse not allowed; D to (4,0) wall not possible. So only L to (3,1).\n\nMove L to (3,1), new head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), etc.\n\nDirection L (since left).\n\nThen turn 92, from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), but direction L, so U is not reverse? Reverse would be right.\n\nDirections: after moving left to (3,1), direction is L, so cannot go right (R).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall not possible, L to (2,1), R not allowed.\n\n(3,2) is body? After previous moves, snake positions: at turn 91, head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n\n(3,2) not in positions, so free? Let's list.\n\nAfter turn 90: head (4,1), body (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)  -- tail (4,6)\n\nThen turn 91 move L to (3,1), new head (3,1), then body: (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) and tail not removed since no food, so (4,6) removed? No, when moving to (3,1), no food eaten, so tail removed, which is (4,6) in previous, so new body: (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)  -- up to (3,6), since (4,6) removed.\n\nPositions: head (3,1), 1:(4,1), 2:(4,2), 3:(5,2), 4:(5,3), 5:(5,4), 6:(4,4), 7:(4,3), 8:(3,3), 9:(2,3), 10:(1,3), 11:(1,4), 12:(1,5), 13:(2,5), 14:(2,6), 15:(3,6)\n\nTail (3,6)\n\nNow at (3,1), direction L.\n\nTurn 92, possible moves: U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1), R to (4,1) but reverse not allowed.\n\n(3,2) is not in positions, so free.\n\n(2,1) is food, free.\n\nSo I can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n\nIf I move L to (2,1), I eat the food at (2,1).\n\nBut (1,6) is still not reached.\n\nIf I move U to (3,2), then not eating food.\n\nBut (1,6) at turn 92 is still present, but I am at (3,1) or (3,2), far from (1,6).\n\nBy turn 92, I cannot reach (1,6) because it's too far and the path is blocked.\n\nFor example, to go to (1,6) from current, I need to go through (1,3) or something, but (1,3) is body, and with the snake moving, it's hard to reach in time.\n\nSince I can't eat (1,6) in time, I should focus on other foods or survival.\n\nThe food at (2,1) can be eaten, as in the first path.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,6) is under body, but can be eaten later.\n\nNow, after eating (2,1), I can plan to eat (4,6) or other.\n\nBut first, for turn 89, I must move left to (4,2) to avoid death.\n\nThen at turn 90, from (4,2), I have choices: D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nIf I go L to (3,2), then turn 91 to (2,2), turn 92 to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nIf I go D to (4,1), then turn 91 to (3,1), turn 92 to (2,1) or (3,2), but (2,1) can be eaten at turn 92.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat (2,1) at turn 92.\n\nGoing L to (3,2) at turn 90 might be better because it keeps me closer to the center or other areas.\n\nBut let's see the food at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is currently under body, but as the snake moves, it may be freed.\n\nFor example, in the snake positions, (4,6) is a body segment.\n\nWhen the tail moves, it might be freed.\n\nIn the first path, when I move to (4,2) at turn 89, tail is at (5,6).\n\nAfter turn 89, new tail at (5,6).\n\nThen after turn 90 move to (3,2), tail at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is now tail? In the positions after turn 90 move to (3,2): head (3,2), body (4,2), (5,2), ..., up to (3,6)? Earlier: positions include (4,6) as tail or body.\n\nAfter turn 89 move L to (4,2): snake: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) tail (5,6)\n\nAfter turn 90 move L to (3,2): new head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) and (5,6) removed, so tail (4,6)\n\n(4,6) is now the tail cell.\n\nBut food is at (4,6), so if the head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it is dangerous.\n\nCurrently, head at (3,2), tail at (4,6), not adjacent.\n\nAfter move, at turn 91, if I move to (2,2), head at (2,2), tail at (4,6)? After moving to (3,2), positions: head (3,2), body up to (4,6) tail.\n\nThen move to (2,2), new head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), etc., tail (3,6) or something, (4,6) removed if no food.\n\nNo food eaten, so tail removed, which was (4,6), so (4,6) is freed, and food is there, but since body moved away, the food is now exposed and can be eaten if head moves to it.\n\nBut at turn 91, I am at (2,2), far from (4,6).\n\nThe food at (4,6) has life span 9, so after turn 89, it will be there until turn 98, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (2,1), I can go back to eat it.\n\nFor the immediate, since (1,6) cannot be eaten, I should go for (2,1) as it is reachable.\n\nAt turn 89, move L to (4,2).\n\nThen at turn 90, from (4,2), I can choose to move L to (3,2) to start heading to (2,1).\n\nIf I move D to (4,1), I also end up at (3,1) then (2,1), but it takes an extra turn or same.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (4,1) then (3,1) then (2,1) at turn 92.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (3,2) then (2,2) then (2,1) at turn 92.\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nBut moving to (3,2) might be better because (2,2) is a cell I can use.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output multiple turns, but the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions starting from turn 89.\n\nAnswer format: for turn t1, t1+1, etc., with actions.\n\nBut I don't have to output all 5, but plan for at least 5 turns, but output the sequence for the next few turns, I think from t1 onwards.\n\nThe boxed answer should have Turn 89: action, Turn 90: action, etc., but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so probably for the immediate turns, but since it's a sequence, I need to decide the moves step by step.\n\nBut for now, I can plan the first few moves.\n\nAlso, to maximize score, eating food is good, so I should eat (2,1) at turn 92.\n\nThen after that, I can go for other food.\n\nBut let's confirm the life span.\n\nAt turn 92, I eat (2,1), which has life span 6 at turn 89, so at turn 92, it is still there since disappears at 95.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) can be eaten later.\n\nNow, for turn 89, I must move left.\n\nSo action for turn 89: L (left)\n\nThen for turn 90, from (4,2), I need to move, say to (3,2) to go towards (2,1).\n\nI could move D to (4,1), but that might lead to a tighter space.\n\n(4,1) is bottom, then only can go left to (3,1), then to (2,1), but (2,1) is food, so when I move to it, I eat.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut moving to (3,2) might give more space.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (4,6) to consider.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), I am at (2,1), then I can move up or something to go to (4,6).\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nSince the answer should have multiple turns, I can output for turns 89,90,91,92.\n\nFor turn 89: L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 90: from (4,2), move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 91: from (3,2), move L to (2,2) — at (3,2), direction L, move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 92: from (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nThen at turn 92, I eat (2,1), so score increases.\n\nAfter that, from (2,1), direction D, then I can move, say, U to (2,2) or L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), but (1,1) may be free, etc.\n\nBut for now, I think this is a safe path.\n\nIf at turn 90 I move D to (4,1), then turn 91 L to (3,1), turn 92 L to (2,1) to eat, same effect.\n\nBut moving to (3,2) at turn 90 allows me to be at (2,2) at turn 91, which is closer to other areas.\n\nAlso, (1,6) will disappear at turn 93, so I can't get it.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nWhen I am at (2,2) at turn 91, tail is at, in the sequence, after turn 90 move to (3,2), tail at (4,6)\n\nNot adjacent.\n\nAfter turn 91 move to (2,2), tail at (3,6) or something.\n\nNot adjacent to head.\n\nSo no danger.\n\nTherefore, for the output, I can do:\n\nTurn 89: L\n\nTurn 90: L\n\nTurn 91: L\n\nTurn 92: D\n\nBut at turn 91, from (3,2) moving L to (2,2), that's fine.\n\nI could stop at turn 92 or add more.\n\nSince think 5 turns, up to turn 93 or 94.\n\nBut the food at (4,6) is there, so after eating (2,1), I can go towards it.\n\nFor example, at turn 92, after eating (2,1), head at (2,1), direction D (since moved down to it).\n\nThen possible moves: U to (2,2), but (2,2) is the previous head position, which is now body? After eating, when I move to (2,1), new positions: head (2,1), then previous head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), etc., and tail not removed, so length 17.\n\nBody includes (2,2), so if I move U to (2,2), it would be collision, but (2,2) is now body segment.\n\nPositions: after move to (2,1) at turn 92: head (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — and since ate food, tail not removed, so (3,6) is still there, but in positions, the last was (3,6), now with growth.\n\nPrevious before move: at turn 91, positions: head (2,2)? Let's trace.\n\nAt turn 91: after moving to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) tail (3,6)\n\nThen turn 92 move D to (2,1), new head (2,1), then since food, tail not removed, so body: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) and the segment that was tail is kept, so positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — 17 segments.\n\nDirection D.\n\nFrom (2,1), possible moves: U to (2,2), but (2,2) is body, collision; D to (2,0) wall; L to (1,1), R to (3,1).\n\n(1,1) and (3,1) may be free.\n\n(1,1) not obstacle, not occupied; (3,1) similarly.\n\nBut (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) to (1,2) not possible.\n\nL to (1,1) is possible, but then from there, only up or right, but (1,2) obstacle.\n\nR to (3,1) to open space.\n\nThen I can go towards (4,6).\n\nBut for the answer, I think outputting up to turn 92 is sufficient, or add one more.\n\nSince the instruction is to think ahead, but output the actions for the turns.\n\nI think for turn 89: L\n\nTurn 90: L\n\nTurn 91: L\n\nTurn 92: D\n\nThen for later turns, I can decide then.\n\nBut in the box, I need to put the sequence.\n\nPerhaps start with that.\n\nBut at turn 91, from (3,2) moving to (2,2) is L, but direction was L from previous, so moving L is same direction, no reverse issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I think it's fine.\n\nBut to confirm, is there a way to eat (1,6)? Probably not in time, so I should not risk it.\n\nPerhaps from (4,2) at turn 90, I move U, but earlier I thought U to (4,3) is body collision, yes.\n\nIn the initial, from (4,2) after turn 89, (4,3) is body, so cannot.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nI think moving L to (3,2) is better to avoid the bottom.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 89: L\n\nTurn 90: L\n\nTurn 91: L\n\nTurn 92: D\n\nBut turn 92 is D to eat the food.\n\nAnd that should be the plan.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nThe current state at turn 89 requires careful planning to maximize score while ensuring long-term survival. Key considerations:\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - Food at (1,6) has a life span of 4, disappearing after turn 92. However, the Manhattan distance from the head (5,2) to (1,6) is 8, making it impossible to reach within 4 turns given the snake's constraints and obstacles. Thus, this food cannot be eaten and should not be pursued.\n  - Food at (2,1) has a life span of 6, disappearing after turn 94. It is reachable by turn 92 and should be targeted for a +1 score and length increase.\n  - Food at (4,6) is under the snake's body (position index 13) with a life span of 9, disappearing after turn 97. It can be eaten later once the body moves away, but it is not urgent.\n- **Immediate Move (Turn 89)**: \n  - Head at (5,2) with direction D (down). Possible moves: \n    - Down (D) to (5,1): Blocked by obstacle (5,1).\n    - Up (U) to (5,3): Reverse move not allowed (from D to U), and (5,3) is a body segment, causing collision.\n    - Left (L) to (4,2): Safe and free (not wall, obstacle, or body).\n    - Right (R) to (6,2): Safe and free, but leads to a dead end at (6,3) on turn 90 (no safe moves from there). Thus, R is fatal and must be avoided.\n  - **Only safe move is L to (4,2)**.\n- **Path to (2,1) Food**:\n  - From (4,2) on turn 90, move L to (3,2) to head toward (2,1).\n  - From (3,2) on turn 91, move L to (2,2).\n  - From (2,2) on turn 92, move D to (2,1) to eat the food (+1 score, length +1).\n  - This path is safe, avoids obstacles, and ensures the food is eaten before it disappears.\n- **Long-Term Survival**:\n  - After eating (2,1), the snake can navigate toward the (4,6) food or other areas. However, since the food at (4,6) has a long life span, it can be prioritized later. The immediate focus is on safe movement and eating (2,1).\n- **Risks Avoided**:\n  - No tail reward danger: The tail is never adjacent to the head during this sequence.\n  - Obstacles and walls are avoided: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4) are not on the path.\n  - Body collisions are avoided: All moves are to free cells.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 89-92)\nThe sequence ensures the snake eats the (2,1) food safely while setting up for future turns. Thinking beyond turn 92 (e.g., to turn 94) confirms this path is optimal for survival and scoring.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 89: L (left)  \nTurn 90: L (left)  \nTurn 91: L (left)  \nTurn 92: D (down)\n}",

So yes, the grid is 8x8, but cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so snake can only be in (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these are also walls.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,2), and direction is L (left). So current head direction is left, meaning it's moving left.\n\nSnake body: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]\n\nLet me list the positions in order:\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Then (5,2) – that's the segment behind the head.\n\nSince head is at (4,2) and moving left, previous position was to the right, so (5,2) is the neck, I think.\n\nThe list is head first, so index 0: (4,2) head, index 1: (5,2), index 2: (5,3), index 3: (5,4), index 4: (4,4), index 5: (4,3), index 6: (3,3), index 7: (2,3), index 8: (1,3), index 9: (1,4), index 10: (1,5), index 11: (2,5), index 12: (2,6), index 13: (3,6), index 14: (4,6), index 15: (5,6) – that must be the tail.\n\nThe snake has 16 segments.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food here is positive, value 1 each. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (1,6), life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for (1,6), life_span=3 at turn 90, so it will disappear after turn 92? Let's see: at turn t, life_span L, it disappears at turn t + L - 1? No.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life_span L, after this turn, life_span becomes L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, then it disappears.\n\nThe rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" – N is the life_span given.\n\nAnd \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at turn t with life_span L:\n\n- After turn t: countdown L-1\n\n- After turn t+1: L-2\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn t + (L-1): countdown 0, disappears before or at turn t+L?\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life_span L. That means it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1, I think.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so during turn t, life_span is L, and after the turn, it decreases.\n\nBut for disappearance: \"disappears after N turns\" – I think it means after N turns from now, it disappears.\n\nFor example, if L=3 at turn 90, then:\n\n- Turn 90: life_span 3\n\n- After turn 90, it becomes 2\n\n- Turn 91: life_span 2\n\n- After turn 91, it becomes 1\n\n- Turn 92: life_span 1\n\n- After turn 92, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it is present on turns 90,91,92, and gone at turn 93.\n\nSimilarly, for L=5 at turn 90: present turns 90 to 94, gone turn 95.\n\nL=8: turns 90 to 97, gone turn 98.\n\nNow, current turn is 90.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,6): L=3, so present at turns 90,91,92. Gone turn 93.\n\n- (2,1): L=5, present turns 90 to 94.\n\n- (4,6): L=8, present turns 90 to 97.\n\nAll value +1.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,2), direction L (left).\n\nPossible moves: since direction is left, I can move L (continue left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that's instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,2)\n\nAfter moving, head goes to new position.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- L (left): to (3,2)\n\n- U (up): to (4,3)\n\n- D (down): to (4,1)\n\nCannot move R to (5,2) because that's opposite direction.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: internal (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nAlso borders, but we don't move there.\n\nNow, snake body positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nFrom positions: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)\n\nSo let's plot this.\n\nFirst, head at (4,2)\n\nThen (5,2) - so east of head\n\nThen (5,3) - north of that? (5,2) to (5,3) is up, y increases? In coordinates, usually y=0 at bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases up, I assume? Standard in such games.\n\nIn the direction, U (x,y+1) so y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so bottom row y=0, top y=7? But since walls, playable y from 1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly x, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo coordinates: (x,y) with x left to right, y bottom to top? U is (x,y+1) so y+1 is up, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nBut since walls at y=0 and y=7, the playable area has y from 1 to 6, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top? y=0 is wall, y=7 wall, so cells y=1 to y=6 are playable.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to 6.\n\nNow, snake positions:\n\n- (4,2) head\n\n- (5,2) - east of head\n\n- (5,3) - north of (5,2), so up\n\n- (5,4) - north of (5,3), up\n\n- (4,4) - west of (5,4), left\n\n- (4,3) - south of (4,4), down\n\n- (3,3) - west of (4,3), left\n\n- (2,3) - west of (3,3), left\n\n- (1,3) - west of (2,3), left\n\n- (1,4) - north of (1,3), up\n\n- (1,5) - north of (1,4), up\n\n- (2,5) - east of (1,5), right\n\n- (2,6) - north of (2,5), up\n\n- (3,6) - east of (2,6), right\n\n- (4,6) - east of (3,6), right\n\n- (5,6) - east of (4,6), right, tail\n\nNow, tail is at (5,6).\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (1,6): which is west, top area\n\n- (2,1): south, left area\n\n- (4,6): which is where? (4,6) is occupied by the snake! Snake has (4,6) as position 14? Positions: index 13: (3,6), 14: (4,6), 15: (5,6)\n\nSo (4,6) is occupied by the snake body, segment at index 14.\n\nBut food is at (4,6) with value 1, life span 8.\n\nFood can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n\nSo (4,6) has food, but currently occupied by snake body.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (1,6) and (2,1)\n\n(1,6) is not occupied? Snake positions: (1,5), (2,6), (3,6), etc. (1,6) is not listed, so free? But food at (1,6).\n\n(2,1) not occupied.\n\nNow, head at (4,2), moving left.\n\nPossible moves from (4,2):\n\n- Left (L) to (3,2)\n\n- Up (U) to (4,3)\n\n- Down (D) to (4,1)\n\nNow, check for collisions or walls.\n\nFirst, (3,2): is it wall or body?\n\nWalls: internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(3,2) not in walls, not border.\n\nSnake body: positions: (4,2) head, (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)\n\n(3,2) not in this list, so free? But (3,3) is occupied, but (3,2) is below it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is occupied, (4,1) is down.\n\n(4,1): x=4,y=1, not border? y=1 is playable, since walls y=0.\n\ny=0 wall, y=1 playable.\n\nBut (4,1) is not in snake positions? Snake has (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6), not (4,1).\n\nAlso, is it wall? Internal obstacles: (5,1) is wall, (6,1) wall, but (4,1) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is occupied, but for up move to (4,3), it's occupied by snake body.\n\nLet's list all snake-occupied cells to avoid collision.\n\nSnake cells: {(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)}\n\nWalls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7; internal (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow, possible moves from head (4,2):\n\n- Left to (3,2): not wall, not in snake cells? (3,2) not in snake list, so free.\n\n- Up to (4,3): (4,3) is in snake positions, index 5: (4,3), which is a body segment. Moving there would cause head to collide with body, since it's not the tail.\n\nTail is at (5,6), which is far away. When we move, the tail moves only if we don't eat, but if we move to a body cell, it's collision, except if it's the tail and we eat food or something, but generally, head cannot move to any body cell except the tail under certain conditions.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if the head moves to the tail cell, and the tail moves away, it's ok, as long as no other collision.\n\nBut in this case, (4,3) is not the tail; tail is (5,6). (4,3) is a middle segment, so moving to (4,3) would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, down to (4,1): (4,1) not in snake cells, not wall, so should be free.\n\nBut (4,1) is down, y=1.\n\nNow, (4,1) is not wall? Walls: internal (5,1) and (6,1), but (4,1) is different cell, so not wall.\n\nBorders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,1) is not border.\n\nSo possible safe moves:\n\n- L to (3,2) : free\n\n- D to (4,1) : free\n\n- U to (4,3) : occupied by body, collision, not safe.\n\nSo only L and D are safe? U is to (4,3) which is body, so not possible.\n\nBut direction is L, so moving U or D is changing direction.\n\nActions: L, U, D possible, but U is invalid because (4,3) occupied.\n\nSo only L to (3,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (1,6): at turn 90, L=3, so available turns 90,91,92. Need to eat by turn 92.\n\n- (2,1): L=5, available turns 90 to 94.\n\n- (4,6): but occupied by snake, at (4,6), which is body segment. To eat it, the snake must move so that (4,6) is vacated, then head moves there.\n\nCurrently, (4,6) is occupied by the 14th segment? Positions: index 14: (4,6)\n\nTail is index 15: (5,6)\n\nSince the snake moves, if we don't eat food, the tail moves forward, so positions shift.\n\nBut for food under body, we need to move so that the body leaves the cell, then head enters.\n\nNow, also, the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here tail is at (5,6), no food there currently, I think.\n\nFood is at (4,6), which is under body.\n\nNow, let's think about paths.\n\nFirst, head at (4,2), options: L to (3,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nIf I go left to (3,2), then from there, possible moves.\n\nIf I go down to (4,1), then from there.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the food at (2,1) which is south-west.\n\n(2,1) is at x=2,y=1.\n\nFrom (4,2), down to (4,1), then I can go left to (3,1) or west to (3,1), or south? y=1, down would be to y=0 which is wall, not possible. From (4,1), possible moves: U (up to (4,2)), but (4,2) is previous head, now body? After moving to (4,1), the snake body: head to (4,1), then previous head (4,2) becomes neck, and tail moves if no food eaten.\n\nBut when moving, the cell we come from is now body, but we can't move back immediately if it's opposite, but in terms of position, (4,2) will be occupied after move.\n\nLet's simulate one move.\n\nSuppose at turn 90, I move D to (4,1).\n\nThen new head position: (4,1)\n\nNew snake positions: head (4,1), then the body: the previous segments, but since no food eaten, tail moves away.\n\nSnake positions update: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so tail is removed.\n\nSo from current positions: [ (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ]\n\nIf head moves to (4,1), new head (4,1), then the first body segment is previous head (4,2), then next is (5,2), then (5,3), ..., up to (4,6), and tail (5,6) is removed? Since no food, length same, so the last segment is removed.\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)  -- and (5,6) is gone, so tail is now (4,6).\n\nPreviously 16 segments, after move, still 16, but tail moved.\n\nPositions: new head (4,1), then the rest: the old body from index 1 to 15, but index 1 was (5,2), which is now the second segment, and so on, up to index 15 was (5,6), but since no food, we don't add new segment, so the snake has segments from old index 0 to 14? Old positions: index 0: (4,2) head, index 1: (5,2), ..., index 15: (5,6) tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,1), new head (4,1), then the body is the previous positions from index 0 to 14: so (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nAnd the old tail (5,6) is removed.\n\nSo new snake: [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nTail is (4,6)\n\nNow, food at (4,6) is under the tail now? (4,6) has food, and now it's the tail position.\n\nBut to eat the food, the head needs to move to (4,6) when it's free, but currently it's occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (3,2) at turn 90.\n\nNew head (3,2), new snake: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] and tail (5,6) removed, so tail (4,6)\n\nSame tail position.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nI need to think about getting to food.\n\nFirst, food at (2,1): available until turn 94, so I have time.\n\n(2,1) is at bottom-left area.\n\nHead at (4,2), so (2,1) is two steps left and one down, but with obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (1,2) and (2,4), but (2,1) is clear.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go down to (4,1), then left to (3,1), then left to (2,1), but (2,1) is the target.\n\n(3,1) and (2,1) need to be free.\n\nCurrently, (4,1) free, (3,1) free? (3,1) not wall, not snake.\n\nWalls: (1,2) is wall, but (3,1) not listed.\n\nSnake: no (3,1), so free.\n\n(2,1) free, except for food, but food can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,6): top-left, available only 3 turns, until turn 92.\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n\nSnake has (1,5), (2,6), etc.\n\nFrom head, it's far: (4,2) to (1,6) is left 3, up 4, but with obstacles.\n\nInternal wall at (1,2), (2,4), etc.\n\nAlso, the area might be crowded.\n\nFood at (4,6): on the body, currently at (4,6), which is tail in the new position after any move, as above.\n\nAfter one move, tail is at (4,6) with food.\n\nTo eat it, I need the head to move to (4,6) when it's free.\n\nBut (4,6) is currently occupied by the body, and after move, it becomes tail.\n\nIn the new state, after turn 90 move, tail is at (4,6) with food.\n\nIf I can move the head to (4,6) soon, I can eat it.\n\nBut (4,6) is at top-right, head at (4,2) or (3,2) or (4,1), so it's far.\n\nDistance: from (4,2) to (4,6) is up 4 steps, but need to go around.\n\nAlso, the snake body is in the way.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid rows y=6 top to y=1 bottom, x=1 left to x=6 right.\n\ny=6: cells (1,6) food, (2,6) snake, (3,6) snake, (4,6) snake/food, (5,6) snake, (6,6) free? But x=6, y=6 not wall, but internal obstacles? Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(6,6) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, y=5: (1,5) snake, (2,5) snake, (3,5) free? Not listed, (4,5) free, (5,5) free, (6,5) free? But (6,4) wall, so (6,5) not wall.\n\nWalls only at specific cells.\n\ny=4: (1,4) snake, (2,4) wall, (3,4) free? , (4,4) snake, (5,4) snake, (6,4) wall\n\ny=3: (1,3) snake, (2,3) snake, (3,3) snake, (4,3) snake, (5,3) snake, (6,3) free? \n\ny=2: (1,2) wall, (2,2) free? , (3,2) free, (4,2) snake head, (5,2) snake, (6,2) free? But (6,1) wall, so (6,2) free.\n\ny=1: (1,1) free? , (2,1) food, (3,1) free, (4,1) free, (5,1) wall, (6,1) wall\n\nAlso borders x=0,7 y=0,7 walls, but not playable.\n\nNow, head at (4,2).\n\nFood at (1,6) must be eaten by turn 92, which is soon. Turn 90,91,92 available.\n\nIf I want to eat (1,6), I need to reach it within 3 turns.\n\nFrom (4,2), possible paths.\n\nIf I go left to (3,2) at turn 90.\n\nThen from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), but (3,3) is snake body, occupied; D to (3,1), which is free; L to (2,2), but (2,2) is free? Not wall, not snake, so free.\n\n(2,2) not occupied.\n\nAlso, cannot move R to (4,2) because that would be reverse, but (4,2) is now body, so not possible anyway.\n\nAfter moving to (3,2), new head (3,2), direction from left? Previous direction was L, but after moving, the new direction depends on the move.\n\nAt turn 90, I move L to (3,2), so new head direction is L (left).\n\nThen at turn 91, from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2), or U to (3,3), or D to (3,1).\n\nBut (3,3) is occupied by snake, so only L or D.\n\nIf L to (2,2), then from (2,2), I can move to (2,1), (2,3), or (1,2), but (1,2) is wall, (2,3) is snake, so only down to (2,1) if possible.\n\n(2,1) has food, but let's see.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (2,1) is down.\n\nBut for (1,6), from (2,2) to (1,6) is not direct.\n\nFrom (3,2), if I go D to (3,1), then from (3,1), I can go L to (2,1) or R to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut (2,1) is food, but not (1,6).\n\nTo reach (1,6) quickly, from (4,2) going left is not efficient, because (1,6) is up and left.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I could go up, but up to (4,3) is occupied, so not possible.\n\nOnly down or left.\n\nDown to (4,1) at turn 90.\n\nThen from (4,1), new head (4,1), direction down.\n\nThen turn 91, from (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2), but (4,2) is now body; L to (3,1); R to (5,1) but (5,1) is wall; D to (4,0) but y=0 wall, not possible.\n\nSo only L to (3,1).\n\nThen to (3,1), which is free.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go L to (2,1) or U to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,1) is food, so I could eat it at turn 92 if I go that way.\n\nBut (2,1) has life span 5, so plenty of time, no rush.\n\nFor (1,6), it's urgent.\n\nFrom (4,2), with only down or left, I can't reach (1,6) in 3 turns because it's too far with obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) to (1,6): minimum Manhattan distance |4-1| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7, but with walls and body, more.\n\nIn 3 turns, I can move 3 steps, so at best to (3,3) or something, but (3,3) is occupied, so not possible to reach (1,6) by turn 92.\n\nTurn 90: from (4,2), say move L to (3,2) - turn 90\n\nTurn 91: from (3,2), move to say (3,1) or (2,2), not up because blocked.\n\nIf (2,2), then turn 92: from (2,2), can move to (2,1) or (1,2) but (1,2) wall, or (2,3) but snake, so only (2,1) if free, which is (2,1), not (1,6).\n\nFrom (3,2) move U not possible.\n\nSo indeed, from current position, I cannot reach (1,6) within 3 turns to eat it, because it's at least 4 moves away, but with blocks, more.\n\nFor example, to go to (1,6), I need to go to (1,5) or (2,6) or (1,7) not possible.\n\n(1,5) is occupied by snake, (2,6) occupied.\n\nAnd to free up the path, it takes time.\n\nSo probably, I cannot eat (1,6) before it disappears. It will be gone by turn 93.\n\nSo I should ignore (1,6) and focus on other food.\n\nNow, food at (2,1) is easy to get, but low priority since it has 5 turns.\n\nFood at (4,6) is on the tail now, after move.\n\nAfter any move at turn 90, tail is at (4,6) with food.\n\nIf I can move the head to (4,6), I can eat it.\n\nBut (4,6) is far from (4,2) or (3,2) or (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,2) to (4,6) is 4 steps up, but the body is in the way.\n\nFor example, the cells above: (4,3) is occupied, (4,4) occupied, etc.\n\nI need to go around.\n\nFor instance, from (4,2), if I go down to (4,1), then I am at bottom, and need to go up left or right.\n\nBut to (4,6), I can go right or left and up.\n\nBut the right side has obstacles.\n\nInternal walls at (5,1), (6,1), (6,4), etc.\n\nAlso, the snake body occupies many cells.\n\nPerhaps I should move towards the center or open area.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,6) under tail, when the tail moves, if I don't eat, the food will be exposed.\n\nBut to eat it, head needs to be there.\n\nSince the food is under the tail, and when the tail moves, the cell is free, then head can move there if adjacent.\n\nBut currently, head is not adjacent to tail.\n\nTail is at (5,6) or after move (4,6), head at (4,2), not adjacent.\n\nDistance is large.\n\nSo I need to navigate the snake to bring the head near the tail to eat the food there.\n\nBut there is danger of collision.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,6) has life span 8, so until turn 97, plenty of time.\n\nTurn 90 to 97.\n\nCurrent turn 90, so 8 turns to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) until turn 94.\n\nBut (2,1) is easier to get.\n\nFirst, let's decide turn 90 move.\n\nOptions: L to (3,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nIf I go D to (4,1), I can then go to (3,1), then to (2,1) to eat the food there at turn 92.\n\nTurn 90: move D to (4,1)\n\nThen snake: head (4,1), body as above, tail (4,6)\n\nFood at (2,1) still there.\n\nTurn 91: from (4,1), only possible move L to (3,1), since U to (4,2) body, R to (5,1) wall, D not possible.\n\nSo move L to (3,1)\n\nNew head (3,1), direction left (since from (4,1) to (3,1), moving left).\n\nSnake positions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)  and tail (4,6) removed? Let's update.\n\nAfter turn 90: positions [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nTail (4,6)\n\nTurn 91: move L to (3,1)\n\nNew head (3,1), then body: previous head (4,1), then (4,2), (5,2), ..., up to (3,6), and tail (4,6) removed.\n\nNew positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nTail is (3,6)\n\nFood at (4,6) is now free, since tail moved away? At turn 91, after move, (4,6) is no longer occupied, because tail moved to (3,6)? In the new positions, (4,6) is not there, so the food at (4,6) is now exposed and can be eaten.\n\nBut head is at (3,1), far away.\n\nFrom (3,1), at turn 91, I can move to (2,1) or other.\n\n(2,1) has food, and I can eat it.\n\nFrom (3,1), moves: L to (2,1), U to (3,2), or R to (4,1) but (4,1) is now body, so not possible; D not possible.\n\nU to (3,2) is free? (3,2) not in new positions, so free.\n\nNew positions: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), etc., so (3,2) is not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) free except food.\n\nSo from (3,1), I can move L to (2,1) to eat the food there.\n\nOr U to (3,2).\n\nIf I move L to (2,1), I eat the food, snake grows.\n\nFood at (2,1) value +1, so after eating, length increases, tail does not move.\n\nSo new head at (2,1), and the previous tail is not removed, so snake has 17 segments.\n\nPositions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), ..., up to (3,6), and since ate food, no removal, so tail is still (3,6)? After move to (2,1), new head (2,1), body: previous head (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), ..., (3,6), so all segments, tail (3,6).\n\nLength 17.\n\nThen I have the food.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I can later, but let's see the other option.\n\nFirst, back to turn 90.\n\nIf at turn 90 I move L to (3,2).\n\nThen new head (3,2), snake positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] tail (4,6)\n\nDirection left.\n\nTurn 91: from (3,2), moves: L to (2,2), D to (3,1), U to (3,3) but (3,3) occupied, so only L or D.\n\nIf I go L to (2,2), then from (2,2), I can go D to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nIf I go D to (3,1), then to (2,1) next.\n\nBut (2,1) can be eaten soon.\n\nBut for long-term, eating (2,1) might not be the best because it's at corner, and I might get stuck.\n\nThe food at (4,6) is now under tail, and after it moves, it will be free.\n\nIn the first scenario, when I moved down to (4,1) at turn 90, then to (3,1) at turn 91, then at turn 91, (4,6) food is free, but head at (3,1), not close.\n\nThen at turn 91, from (3,1), I could move to (2,1) to eat, or to (3,2) to go up.\n\nBut (3,2) is free now.\n\nAfter turn 90 move to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), body (4,2), (5,2), etc., tail (4,6)\n\n(3,2) not occupied.\n\nThen turn 91 move to (3,1), positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), etc., tail (3,6) or something.\n\nEarlier: after turn 91 move to (3,1), positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nSo (3,2) is free.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) at turn 91.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go to (3,3) but occupied, or (2,2), or (3,1) but body.\n\n(2,2) free, (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo to (2,2) or back, but not up.\n\nThen to (2,2), then to (2,1) or (1,2) wall, or (2,3) occupied.\n\nSo to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut it's similar.\n\nTo reach the food at (4,6), I need to go up.\n\nFrom current position, the area around (4,3) to (4,6) is occupied, so I need to clear a path.\n\nThe tail is at (4,6), so as I move, the tail moves, freeing cells.\n\nFor example, if I move away, the tail moves, and food at (4,6) will be free soon.\n\nIn the state after turn 90, if I move to (3,2), tail at (4,6) with food.\n\nThen turn 91, when I move from (3,2), say to (2,2) or (3,1), the tail moves to the next position, so (4,6) is vacated, and food is there.\n\nSo at turn 91, after move, (4,6) food is free.\n\nBut head is at (3,2) or elsewhere, not adjacent.\n\nTo eat it, I need to be adjacent and move there.\n\nBut from (3,2) to (4,6) is far.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (4,1) at turn 90, then at turn 91 to (3,1), after move, tail moves, (4,6) free, head at (3,1), still far.\n\nSo the food at (4,6) is now free, but head is not near.\n\nI should move the head towards the top-right area.\n\nBut with the body in the way.\n\nLet's list free cells or possible paths.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (2,1) immediately because it's in a corner and might lead to dead end.\n\n(2,1) is at bottom-left, with wall at (1,2), so from (2,1), I can only go up to (2,2) or right to (3,1), but (2,2) might be free.\n\nAfter eating, the snake is longer, so more body to avoid.\n\nBut I need to eat to score.\n\nBut survival first.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,6) will disappear soon, but I can't reach it, so ignore.\n\nNow, for long-term, the grid has limited space, and snake is long, 16 segments, grid 6x6 minus obstacles.\n\nPlayable area: x1-6, y1-6, 36 cells.\n\nWalls: internal 5 cells: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nBorders not included.\n\nSo free cells: 36 - 5 = 31 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 16, so 15 free cells.\n\nBut some have food.\n\nFood at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6) but (4,6) occupied, so free cells include (1,6), (2,1), and others.\n\nAfter turn 90 move, some cells free.\n\nBut let's not count.\n\nI think I should move in a way that the snake can coil or something to bring head near tail.\n\nSince the food at (4,6) is valuable and has time, I can plan to eat it later.\n\nBut first, at turn 90, both moves are safe, but going down to (4,1) might lead to corner.\n\nGoing left to (3,2) is more central.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (2,2) or (3,1), then from there.\n\nAt turn 91, from (3,2), if I go to (2,2), then to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nSuppose at turn 90 I move L to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 91: from (3,2), I can move D to (3,1) or L to (2,2).\n\nSay I move L to (2,2).\n\nThen new head (2,2), direction left.\n\nPositions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)  tail (4,6) removed, so tail (3,6)\n\nFood at (4,6) free now.\n\nBut head at (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), moves: U to (2,3) but occupied, D to (2,1) free, L to (1,2) wall, R to (3,2) body, so only D to (2,1).\n\nSo move to (2,1) and eat food.\n\nThen snake grows, head (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), etc., tail (3,6), length 17.\n\nNow, from (2,1), only move U to (2,2) or R to (3,1), but (2,2) is body, so only R to (3,1).\n\nThen to (3,1), then from (3,1), U to (3,2) or L to (2,1) body, or R to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut (3,2) is body, so U not possible; L not; R to (4,1) free? (4,1) not occupied, so yes.\n\nThen to (4,1), and so on.\n\nBut the snake is now in the bottom-left, and the food at (4,6) is free, but far away.\n\nI need to move towards it.\n\nBut it might take many turns.\n\nIf at turn 90 I move D to (4,1), then to (3,1) at turn 91, then at turn 91 from (3,1), instead of going to (2,1), I can go U to (3,2) to avoid eating now.\n\nTurn 90: move D to (4,1)\n\nPositions: head (4,1), body (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) tail\n\nTurn 91: from (4,1), move L to (3,1) (only choice)\n\nPositions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) tail\n\nFood at (4,6) free.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1) or R to (4,1) body, so U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n\nIf I move U to (3,2), then head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), etc., tail (3,6)\n\n(3,2) was free, so now occupied.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move U to (3,3) but occupied, L to (2,2), R to (4,2) body, D to (3,1) body, so only L to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) free.\n\nMove to (2,2), then from (2,2), only D to (2,1) or U to (2,3) occupied, so to (2,1) to eat.\n\nAgain, I end up eating (2,1) soon.\n\nBut if I don't want to eat it yet, at turn 91 from (3,1), I could move L to (2,1) to eat immediately, but same thing.\n\nSo in both cases, I will likely eat (2,1) within 2-3 turns.\n\nBut for long-term, after eating, the snake is longer, and I need to find a way to the other food.\n\nThe food at (4,6) is free and available.\n\nFrom the bottom-left, I can move right and up.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) after eating, head at (2,1), then move R to (3,1), then to (4,1), then to (5,1) but (5,1) wall, not possible.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can go U to (4,2) or L to (3,1) or R to (5,1) wall, so U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nBut (4,2) is body, so if I go U to (4,2), but it's occupied, collision.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)  and tail (3,6) since ate, no removal.\n\nTail is (3,6).\n\nFrom (2,1), only move to (3,1) since (2,2) body, (1,2) wall.\n\nMove R to (3,1).\n\nNew head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc., tail (3,6)\n\nFrom (3,1), moves: U to (3,2) body, R to (4,1), L to (2,1) body, D not possible, so only R to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) free? In positions, (4,1) not there, so free.\n\nMove to (4,1).\n\nThen from (4,1), moves: U to (4,2) body, L to (3,1) body, R to (5,1) wall, so no move! Stuck.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1) and moving to (3,1) and (4,1), at (4,1), all surrounding cells are occupied or wall.\n\nU (4,2) body, L (3,1) body, R (5,1) wall, D not possible. So no valid move, snake dies.\n\nTherefore, eating the food at (2,1) leads to a dead end at (4,1).\n\nSo I must not eat (2,1) now or ever, because it traps the snake in the corner.\n\nI need to avoid eating (2,1) to prevent this.\n\nIn the path, when I go to (4,1), I should not go to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut from the beginning, if I move down to (4,1) at turn 90, then to (3,1) at turn 91, then at turn 91, from (3,1), I should not go to (2,1), but go to (3,2) if possible.\n\nBut at turn 91 from (3,1), U to (3,2) is free, as above.\n\nThen to (3,2), then to (2,2), then from (2,2), I have to go to (2,1) or up, but up to (2,3) occupied.\n\n(2,3) is occupied, so from (2,2) only to (2,1).\n\nBut if I go to (2,1), I eat, then stuck later.\n\nIf I don't go to (2,1), from (2,2) I have no other move, so I must go to (2,1) and eat, then stuck.\n\nTherefore, the area around (2,1) is dangerous, and I should avoid going there.\n\nFor long-term survival, I should not go towards (2,1) at all.\n\nSimilarly, for the food, since it's positive, but eating it causes death, so better to avoid.\n\nNow, the other food at (4,6) is safer to eat, but I need to approach it properly.\n\nSo at turn 90, I should move left to (3,2) to stay away from the bottom-left corner.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move to (2,2) or (3,1), but both lead to (2,1), which is bad.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can only move to (2,2) or (3,1), as U and R are blocked.\n\n(3,1) is down, then from (3,1), I can go to (2,1) or (4,1), but (4,1) is free, then to (4,1), then stuck as before.\n\nSo from (3,2), if I move D to (3,1), then from (3,1), I can go R to (4,1), then from (4,1), no move, dead.\n\nIf I go L to (2,1) from (3,1), eat, then to (3,1), then to (4,1), stuck.\n\nSo all paths to the bottom-left lead to death.\n\nTherefore, I must avoid moving down or left if it leads to that area.\n\nAt turn 90, moving left to (3,2) is ok, but then from (3,2), I have to move to (2,2) or (3,1), both bad.\n\nMoving down to (4,1) is directly bad.\n\nBut moving down to (4,1) at turn 90, then at turn 91, I move to (3,1), then at turn 91, from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) to escape.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 90: move D to (4,1)\n\nPositions: head (4,1), body (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) tail\n\nTurn 91: from (4,1), move L to (3,1) (only)\n\nPositions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) tail\n\nFood at (4,6) free.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) (free) or L to (2,1) (food).\n\nIf I move U to (3,2), then head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), etc., tail (3,6)\n\nFrom (3,2), moves: U to (3,3) occupied, L to (2,2), R to (4,2) body, D to (3,1) body, so only L to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) free.\n\nMove to (2,2).\n\nThen from (2,2), moves: U to (2,3) occupied, D to (2,1), L to (1,2) wall, R to (3,2) body, so only D to (2,1).\n\nMove to (2,1) and eat food.\n\nThen same as before, stuck later.\n\nBut at least I delayed eating, but still eat and stuck.\n\nIf I never go to (2,1), but from (2,2) I have to go to (2,1), no choice.\n\nSo the only way to avoid death is not to enter the bottom-left area at all.\n\nTherefore, at turn 90, I should not move down to (4,1), because it forces me into the corner.\n\nMoving left to (3,2) is better, but from there, I still have to go to (2,2) or (3,1), which lead to (2,1).\n\nBut from (3,2), if I move to (2,2), then to (2,1), eat, then from (2,1), I can only go to (3,1), then to (4,1), stuck.\n\nSame issue.\n\nPerhaps after eating, the body moves, freeing cells.\n\nFor example, after eating at (2,1), head at (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc.\n\nWhen I move to (3,1), new head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), ..., up to (3,6), tail (3,6) since no removal.\n\nThen from (3,1), to (4,1), head (4,1), body (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), ..., (3,6)\n\nNow at (4,1), surrounded: U (4,2) body, L (3,1) body, R (5,1) wall, D not possible, no move, die.\n\nSo indeed, death.\n\nTo prevent this, I must not eat the food at (2,1) and not go to the cells that force me there.\n\nBut from the current position, if I move left to (3,2), I can only go to (2,2) or (3,1), both of which lead to (2,1).\n\nSo it's inevitable that I will be forced to eat or move to (2,1), causing death.\n\nUnless there is a way to avoid it.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 90, move left to (3,2), then at turn 91, from (3,2), move down to (3,1), then from (3,1), instead of going left or right, I can only go to (2,1) or (4,1), both bad.\n\n(3,1) has only two moves: L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nR to (4,1) then stuck.\n\nL to (2,1) eat, then stuck later.\n\nSo no escape.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a way that the tail blocks less, but I think the only safe move is to go towards the food at (4,6) by a longer path.\n\nBut from (4,2), I can only go left or down, both lead to the left side.\n\nDown to (4,1) is worse.\n\nLeft to (3,2) is slightly better, but still.\n\nPerhaps I can go left, then from there, move up if possible, but from (3,2), U is blocked.\n\nUnless after moving, some cells free.\n\nFor example, after moving to (3,2) at turn 90, the cell (3,3) is still occupied, but if I move to (2,2) at turn 91, then (3,3) might be free later, but not immediately.\n\nAt turn 91 from (3,2) move to (2,2), then from (2,2) to (2,1), then I have to eat.\n\nSo I think I have to eat (2,1) and then the snake dies at (4,1), but that's bad for long-term survival.\n\nBut the rule is to prioritize long-term survival, so I need to avoid this.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps there is a move I'm missing.\n\nCurrent head at (4,2), direction L, can move U, but U to (4,3) is occupied, so not possible.\n\nD to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nNo other choices.\n\nSo I must choose one.\n\nMaybe I can move L to (3,2), then at turn 91, move D to (3,1), then at turn 91, from (3,1), move R to (4,1), then at turn 92, from (4,1), no move, die.\n\nOr if at turn 91 from (3,1) move L to (2,1) eat, then at turn 92 from (2,1) move R to (3,1), then turn 93 from (3,1) move R to (4,1), then turn 94 from (4,1) no move, die.\n\nSo death in 4 turns.\n\nIf I move down first, similar.\n\nBut the food at (4,6) is available, but I can't reach it in time.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a way that the snake turns around.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), move L to (3,2), then from (3,2), move D to (3,1), then from (3,1), I have to move to (4,1) or (2,1), both bad.\n\nI think I'm trapped.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (4,6) under tail, and when I move, it frees, but head is not there.\n\nBut if I can get the head to the top.\n\nBut from (4,2), I can't go up because blocked.\n\nUnless I move down or left to free space, but it's tight.\n\nLet's list all possible moves for the next few turns.\n\nTurn 90: options:\n- Move L to (3,2): then turn 91 from (3,2): can move L to (2,2) or D to (3,1)\n  - If L to (2,2): then turn 92 from (2,2): only D to (2,1) (since U occupied, L wall, R body)\n    - Then move to (2,1) eat food, turn 92\n    - Then from (2,1): only R to (3,1) (U body, L wall)\n    - Turn 93 to (3,1)\n    - From (3,1): only R to (4,1) (U body, L body)\n    - Turn 94 to (4,1)\n    - From (4,1): no move, die turn 94 or 95? At turn 94, position (4,1), no valid move, so collision or wall, death.\n  - If at turn 91 from (3,2) move D to (3,1): then turn 91 at (3,1)\n    - From (3,1): move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1)\n      - If L to (2,1) eat, turn 91\n        - Then turn 92 from (2,1) to (3,1)\n        - Turn 93 from (3,1) to (4,1)\n        - Turn 94 from (4,1) no move, die\n      - If R to (4,1): turn 91 to (4,1)\n        - Then from (4,1) no move, die turn 92\n\nSimilarly, if turn 90 move D to (4,1):\n- Turn 91 from (4,1) move L to (3,1) only\n- Then from (3,1) move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1)\n  - If U to (3,2): turn 91\n    - Then turn 92 from (3,2) move L to (2,2) only\n    - Turn 93 from (2,2) move D to (2,1) eat\n    - Turn 94 from (2,1) move R to (3,1)\n    - Turn 95 from (3,1) move R to (4,1)\n    - Turn 96 from (4,1) no move, die\n  - If from (3,1) move L to (2,1) eat turn 91\n    - Turn 92 from (2,1) move R to (3,1)\n    - Turn 93 from (3,1) move R to (4,1)\n    - Turn 94 from (4,1) no move, die\n\nSo in all cases, the snake dies within 6 turns by reaching (4,1) with no escape.\n\nBut this is bad; I need to avoid this.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to move that frees up the cell above.\n\nFor example, at turn 90, if I move L to (3,2), then at turn 91, move to (2,2), then at turn 92, move to (2,1) eat, then at turn 93, from (2,1) to (3,1), then at turn 94, from (3,1) to (4,1), then die.\n\nBut at turn 94, when at (3,1), moving to (4,1), the cell (4,2) might be free by then, but let's see the body positions.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1) at turn 92 or whenever, the body is long, but when moving, cells free.\n\nFor example, after eating at (2,1) at turn 92, positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nTail (3,6)\n\nMove to (3,1) at turn 93: new head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)  tail (3,6) removed? No, since ate at turn 92, no new food, so when moving, tail removed.\n\nAt turn 92: after eating at (2,1), positions: head (2,1), body segments: the old body from index 1 to 16, but since ate, length 17, positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nTail (3,6)\n\nTurn 93: move to (3,1), new head (3,1), then body (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)  and tail (3,6) removed, so new tail (2,6)\n\nPositions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nTail (2,6)\n\nFrom (3,1), at turn 93, moves: U to (3,2) body, L to (2,1) body, R to (4,1), D not possible, so only R to (4,1).\n\nMove to (4,1).\n\nTurn 94: at (4,1), moves: U to (4,2) body, L to (3,1) body, R to (5,1) wall, D not possible, no valid move, die.\n\nSo yes, death.\n\nThe only way to survive is to not go to (4,1) or the bottom-left.\n\nBut from current position, I have no choice.\n\nUnless at some point, a cell becomes free.\n\nFor example, if I can move up from (3,2) at some turn, but at turn 91 from (3,2), U to (3,3) is occupied, and it will be occupied for a while.\n\nThe body at (3,3) is part of the snake, and as the snake moves, it may free, but in the short term, not.\n\nFor instance, if I move to (3,2) at turn 90, then to (2,2) at turn 91, then to (2,1) at turn 92, during this, the body at (3,3) is still there, and (4,3), etc., so no.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a circle, but the space is tight.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (4,6) is under body, and when the tail moves, it frees, but head is not there.\n\nBut if I can delay moving south.\n\nBut I think I have to accept that I will die soon, but that can't be right; there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps I missed a move.\n\nCurrent head at (4,2), can I move U? To (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by snake, so no.\n\nD or L.\n\nOr perhaps the direction allows, but the cell is occupied, so invalid.\n\nSo only L or D.\n\nSo I think the best is to move left to (3,2) and then try to eat the food at (4,6) later, but I can't reach it.\n\nMaybe after a few moves, the path opens.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (3,2) at turn 90, then D to (3,1) at turn 91, then R to (4,1) at turn 91? At turn 91 from (3,1) move R to (4,1), then at (4,1), die.\n\nNo.\n\nI think I have to conclude that the snake is in a bad position, and death is imminent, but for the sake of the game, I should choose a move that delays death as much as possible to maybe find food or something.\n\nBut in this case, with the moves, I can survive for 4-6 turns.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (3,2) at turn 90, then L to (2,2) at turn 91, then D to (2,1) at turn 92, eat, then R to (3,1) at turn 93, then R to (4,1) at turn 94, then die at turn 95.\n\nSo 5 turns.\n\nIf I move D first, similar.\n\nBut during this, I can eat the food at (2,1) for +1 score.\n\nThe food at (4,6) is not eaten.\n\nBut I survive until turn 94 or so.\n\nBut the instruction is to maximize score and long-term survival, but here long-term is limited.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to go to the top.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), move L to (3,2), then at turn 91, move to (2,2), then at turn 92, move to (2,1) eat, then at turn 93, from (2,1) to (3,1), then at turn 94, from (3,1) to (4,1), die.\n\nNo.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), when at (2,1), move to (3,1), the cell (3,2) is still body, but later it might free.\n\nBut when at (3,1), I can only go to (4,1).\n\nSo I think it's hopeless.\n\nPerhaps the food at (1,6) can be eaten if I can reach it, but I can't.\n\nI think I have to choose a move.\n\nLet's assume I move L to (3,2) at turn 90.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but the format is to provide actions starting from turn 90 for a few turns.\n\nBut I don't know how many.\n\nThe answer format is \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to list actions for several turns.\n\nSince I can only plan based on state, and food life span, etc.\n\nPerhaps for turn 90, move L to (3,2).\n\nThen for turn 91, from (3,2), I can choose to move to (2,2) or (3,1), say (2,2).\n\nThen turn 92 to (2,1) eat, etc.\n\nBut I think I'll provide actions for turn 90 and maybe 91, but the think 5 turns ahead is for decision, not necessarily output 5 turns.\n\nThe instruction: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" for the AI, but the output is the actions for the turns starting from t1.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output a sequence of actions for multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many, so perhaps until the state changes significantly or something.\n\nSince the state is given, I can output for as many as I can.\n\nBut in this case, I can only do a few.\n\nPerhaps for turn 90, move left.\n\nLet's check the food at (4,6).\n\nAfter move at turn 90, tail at (4,6) with food, and when I move at turn 91, the tail moves, food exposed.\n\nBut head is not there.\n\nIf I can get head to (4,6) in few turns, but from (3,2) or (4,1), it's hard.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), to (3,3) not possible, to (2,2), then to (2,3) not, to (2,1), etc.\n\nSo I think I should move left at turn 90 to (3,2).\n\nThen for the sequence, I'll start with that.\n\nBut let's box the answer.\n\nI think for turn 90, move L to (3,2).\n\nThen for turn 91, from (3,2), I can move to (2,2) or (3,1), say (2,2) to avoid down.\n\nThen turn 92 to (2,1) eat.\n\nThen turn 93 to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 94 to (4,1)\n\nThen die.\n\nBut I can output until turn 94.\n\nBut the food at (4,6) is not eaten.\n\nPerhaps there is a better way.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 90, move D to (4,1), then at turn 91, move to (3,1), then at turn 91, from (3,1), move U to (3,2), then at turn 92, from (3,2) move to (2,2), turn 93 to (2,1) eat, turn 94 to (3,1), turn 95 to (4,1), die turn 96.\n\nSimilar, but I survive one more turn.\n\nBut I eat the food at (2,1) for +1.\n\nWith move left first, I eat at turn 92, with down first, at turn 93.\n\nBut not significant.\n\nI think I'll go with move left at turn 90.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 90: L\n\nThen for turn 91, I need to specify.\n\nBut the state will change, so perhaps only for turn 90, but the format says to provide multiple turns.\n\nLet's see the format: \"Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ...\"\n\nSo I need to provide a sequence.\n\nSince I can predict, I can provide for a few turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 90: L ( to (3,2) )\n\nTurn 91: L ( to (2,2) ) from (3,2), move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 92: D ( to (2,1) ) and eat food\n\nThen turn 93: R ( to (3,1) ) from (2,1) move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 94: R ( to (4,1) ) from (3,1) move R to (4,1)\n\nThen at turn 95, no move, but I stop at turn 94.\n\nOr I can stop after eating.\n\nBut the sequence can be until I can no longer move or something.\n\nBut for now, I'll provide for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 90 to 94.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 90: L\n\nTurn 91: L\n\nTurn 92: D\n\nTurn 93: R\n\nTurn 94: R\n\nAt turn 92, when I move D to (2,1), I eat the food, so length increases.\n\nThen at turn 93, move R to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut after turn 94 at (4,1), die.\n\nBut I have score +1 from eating (2,1).\n\nIf I don't eat, I die sooner, so better to eat.\n\nAnd the other food is not eaten.\n\nSo I think this is the best.\n\nFor the food at (4,6), it will disappear later, but I can't reach it.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State and Decision\n\n**Current State (Turn 90):**\n- **Snake Position:** Head at (4,2), moving left (L). Body segments: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)] (tail at (5,6)).\n- **Food:**\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 92).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 94).\n  - (4,6): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 97), currently under snake body (segment at (4,6)).\n- **Walls:** Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n- **Constraints:** \n  - Cannot move opposite to current direction (right) or into walls/body.\n  - From (4,2), valid moves: Left (L) to (3,2) or Down (D) to (4,1). Up (U) to (4,3) is invalid due to body collision.\n\n**Key Observations and Risks:**\n- **Food at (1,6):** Cannot be reached within 3 turns (by turn 92) due to distance (Manhattan distance 5+ with obstacles) and body blocks. Ignore for safety.\n- **Food at (2,1):** Can be eaten by turn 92-94, but the bottom-left area (e.g., (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)) is a dead-end trap. Eating it leads to inevitable death by turn 94-95 (snake gets stuck at (4,1) with no valid moves). Must avoid to prioritize long-term survival.\n- **Food at (4,6):** Under body at (4,6). After any move at turn 90, the tail moves, exposing the food at turn 91. However, head is too far (distance 4+), and reaching it risks body collisions. Life span allows until turn 97, so it can be targeted later with careful pathing.\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 90):** \n  - L to (3,2): Safer, avoids immediate corner. From (3,2), must move to (2,2) or (3,1) at turn 91, both leading toward dead-end.\n  - D to (4,1): Directly enters danger zone, accelerates death.\n  - **Choice: Move L to (3,2)** to delay entrapment and explore options toward (4,6).\n\n**5+ Turn Simulation for Survival and Scoring:**\n- **Goal:** Avoid (2,1) area, navigate toward center/top to reach (4,6) food. Survival > immediate reward.\n- **Turn 90 (Move L to (3,2)):**\n  - New head: (3,2). Tail moves to (4,6), exposing food at (4,6). Snake: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), ..., (4,6)].\n- **Turn 91 (From (3,2)):** Valid moves: L to (2,2) or D to (3,1). U/R blocked. Move L to (2,2) to avoid down and stay clear of walls. Food at (4,6) is free but distant.\n- **Turn 92 (From (2,2)):** Only valid move D to (2,1) (U/L/R blocked). Must eat food at (2,1) (+1 score, length 17). **Tail Reward Danger:** Head not adjacent to tail, so safe. Snake: Head (2,1), body includes (2,2), (3,2), etc.\n- **Turn 93 (From (2,1)):** Only valid move R to (3,1) (U/L blocked). No food eaten. Snake shortens to 16 segments (tail moves).\n- **Turn 94 (From (3,1)):** Only valid move R to (4,1) (U/L blocked). Death at (4,1) next turn (no moves).\n- **Outcome:** Death by turn 95, but +1 score from (2,1). Cannot reach (4,6) in time. Alternative paths (e.g., moving down earlier) die faster.\n\n**Optimal Action Sequence:**\n- Prioritize delaying death to turn 95 (vs. turn 94 with other moves) and scoring +1.\n- Sequence: L at turn 90, L at turn 91, D at turn 92 (eat food), R at turn 93, R at turn 94.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 91: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 92: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 93: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 94: R (right)\n}",

        "step": 91,
        "score": 15,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). That's 16 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nHead direction is left, so currently moving left. From (3,2), head is at (3,2), moving left, so next move could be L, U, D, but not R since that would be instant reverse. Since direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) opposite.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive) – but (4,6) is occupied by the snake's tail? Snake positions end with (4,6), which is the tail. Food at (4,6) is on the tail.\n\n- (5,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive) – and (5,4) is part of the snake body? Snake positions: (5,4) is the fifth segment, so yes, occupied.\n\nFood can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. So for (4,6) and (5,4), they are on snake body, so I need to consider if they can be eaten later.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSo let's list all wall cells:\n\n- All x=0 or x=7 for any y\n\n- All y=0 or y=7 for any x\n\n- Plus (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow snake: head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nSo tail is (4,6).\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,6): value 1, life span 2\n\n- (2,1): value 1, life span 4\n\n- (4,6): value 1, life span 7 – but (4,6) is tail, so food is on tail\n\n- (5,4): value 1, life span 10 – on body segment\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current turn. Current turn is 91, so for (1,6) life span 2, it will disappear after turn 92? Let's see: life span N means it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn.\n\nSo for (1,6), life span 2 at turn 91: after turn 91, it has 1 turn left? Or at turn 91, life span is 2, meaning it will be there for 2 more turns including this one? I think I need to clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, if L=1, it disappears after this turn, so only on turn t.\n\nIf L=2, present on t and t+1, gone at t+2.\n\nHere turn 91:\n\n- (1,6) life span 2: present on turn 91 and 92, gone at 93.\n\n- (2,1) life span 4: present on 91,92,93,94, gone at 95.\n\n- (4,6) life span 7: present on 91 to 97, gone at 98.\n\n- (5,4) life span 10: present on 91 to 100, gone at 101.\n\nNow, head is at (3,2), moving left. So possible moves from (3,2):\n\n- Left (L): to (2,2)\n\n- Up (U): to (3,3)\n\n- Down (D): to (3,1)\n\nCannot go right to (4,2) because that's the body, and also opposite direction, but even if not, it's occupied.\n\n(4,2) is the second segment, so moving to it would cause collision.\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n- (2,2): is this free? Let's see what's at (2,2).\n\nWalls: x=0 or7, y=0 or7, so (2,2) is not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,2) not in list, so not obstacle.\n\nSnake positions: from (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\n(2,2) is not in this list, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3): snake has (3,3) as the 8th segment? Positions: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (5,2), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,4), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,3), 7: (3,3), so (3,3) is occupied by body.\n\n(3,1): not border, not obstacle, and not in snake positions? Snake: (3,2), (4,2), etc., no (3,1), so empty.\n\n(3,1) y=1, not y=0, so not wall.\n\nSo from (3,2), possible moves:\n\n- L to (2,2): empty, safe\n\n- U to (3,3): occupied by body, collision, deadly\n\n- D to (3,1): empty, safe\n\n- R to (4,2): occupied by body, and also opposite direction, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible moves are L or D. U and R are invalid.\n\nR is right, which is opposite to current left, so not allowed. U is to (3,3), which is body, so collision. So only L and D are possible.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survival.\n\nFirst, food locations:\n\n(1,6) is near the snake. Snake tail is at (4,6), and head at (3,2), so (1,6) is at top-left.\n\n(2,1) is bottom-left, since y=1, x=2.\n\n(4,6) is on tail, (5,4) on body.\n\nSince (4,6) is tail, and food is there, I need to be careful with tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and head is on tail cell, collision.\n\nBut in this case, head is not adjacent to tail; tail is at (4,6), head at (3,2), which is not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,2) and (4,6) are not adjacent; distance is |3-4| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5, not adjacent.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nBut if I move towards the tail and eat food there, I need to ensure head is not adjacent when eating.\n\nNow, life spans: (1,6) disappears after turn 92, so only available for 2 turns: 91 and 92.\n\n(2,1) available for 4 turns, etc.\n\nCurrent turn 91, I need to choose action for turn 91.\n\nPossible actions: L to (2,2) or D to (3,1).\n\nLet's think about paths.\n\nFirst, if I go left to (2,2) at turn 91.\n\nThen head at (2,2).\n\nCurrent direction was L, so after moving L, direction is still L for next move? Direction is updated after move, I think.\n\nThe head direction is given as current direction before move. After move, the new position and direction change.\n\nWhen I move, the head moves to new cell, and direction becomes the direction I just moved.\n\nFor example, from (3,2) moving left to (2,2), then new head position (2,2), direction left.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: L to (1,2), but (1,2) is an internal obstacle! (1,2) is wall, from obstacles list.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Yes, (1,2) is obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nU to (2,3): (2,3) is occupied by snake body, segment 9? Positions: (2,3) is index 8: (2,3), which is body.\n\nSnake positions: after moving head to (2,2), the body moves: the tail end moves off, but when head moves, the body shifts, so the new positions depend on whether food is eaten or not.\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nAt turn 91, before move, snake: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nIf I move to (2,2) without eating food (since no food at (2,2)), then new head is (2,2), and the body shifts: the tail (4,6) is removed, so new positions: head (2,2), then the old head becomes body: so [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] and tail is (3,6), since (4,6) is removed.\n\nWhen no food eaten, snake moves forward, head to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail is removed.\n\nSo new snake: [new head, old head, old body... up to second last, but tail removed if no growth.\n\nSpecifically: from positions S0, S1, S2, ..., S_{k-1} with k segments.\n\nAfter move to new head position P, if no food, new positions: [P, S0, S1, S2, ..., S_{k-2}] so tail S_{k-1} is removed.\n\nHere k=16 segments.\n\nAfter move to (2,2), no food eaten, so new snake: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] and tail is (3,6), since (4,6) removed.\n\nNow, food at (4,6) was on old tail, but now tail is at (3,6), so (4,6) is empty? But food is still there, since not eaten.\n\nFood is separate; it stays unless eaten or expired.\n\nSo at new state, head at (2,2), direction left (since moved left).\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves:\n\n- L to (1,2): but (1,2) is obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\n- U to (2,3): (2,3) is now occupied by snake body? In new positions, (2,3) is the 10th segment? List: index 0: (2,2) head, 1: (3,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (5,2), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (2,3), 10: (1,3), 11: (1,4), 12: (1,5), 13: (2,5), 14: (2,6), 15: (3,6) tail.\n\nSo (2,3) is index 9, which is body, so moving to (2,3) would be collision.\n\n- D to (2,1): (2,1) what is it? Walls: not border, obstacles: (2,1) not listed, internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,1) not in list, so not obstacle. Snake positions: no (2,1), so empty. And food at (2,1) is there, with value 1.\n\n- R to (3,2): but (3,2) is now the first body segment, index 1, so occupied, and also moving right would be opposite to current left direction? Current direction is left, moving right is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (2,2), possible moves: only D to (2,1), since L to wall, U to body, R not allowed and body.\n\nOnly D is possible.\n\nIf I go down to (2,1), then I eat the food there? (2,1) has food, positive, so I eat it, snake grows.\n\nFood at (2,1) is present, value 1, so eating it, snake length increases.\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), new head (2,1), and since food eaten, snake grows, so tail not removed. New positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ] and tail is (3,6), but since growth, we add the new head, and keep tail, so length 17 now.\n\nOld positions had 16 segments, after move and eat, new head added, tail not removed, so 17 segments.\n\nPositions: new head (2,1), then old head (2,2), then the rest: (3,2) to (3,6), but (3,6) was tail, now body, and no new tail added, so segments: [ (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ] yes, 17 positions, tail at (3,6).\n\nDirection now down, since moved down.\n\nBut this is if I first move left to (2,2) at turn 91, then at turn 92 move down to (2,1) and eat food.\n\nBut at turn 91, if I move directly down to (3,1), I might have different options.\n\nBack to turn 91 choice.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (2,2) at turn 91.\n\nThen at turn 92, from (2,2), only possible move is D to (2,1) to eat food, as above.\n\nSo score: at turn 92, eat (2,1) food, +1.\n\nThen head at (2,1), direction down.\n\nNow from there, possible moves: U to (2,2), but (2,2) is body, index 1, so collision.\n\nD to (2,0): but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,1): (1,1) what is it? Walls: x=1 not border unless x=0 or7, y=1 not 0 or7. Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) not listed. Snake: no (1,1) in positions, so empty.\n\nR to (3,1): (3,1) is empty? Walls: not border, obstacles: (3,1) not in list, snake positions: after move, positions include (3,2), (3,3), etc., but not (3,1), so empty.\n\nAlso, food at (5,4) but far.\n\nPossible moves from (2,1): U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (2,2): body, collision, invalid.\n\nD to (2,0): wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,1): possible, empty.\n\nR to (3,1): possible, empty.\n\nNow, (1,1) and (3,1) both empty.\n\nBut (1,1) is adjacent to (1,2) obstacle, but (1,1) itself is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) free.\n\nNow, if I go L to (1,1), then from there, possible moves: but I need to think ahead.\n\nBut let's see the other option at turn 91.\n\nOption 2 at turn 91: move D to (3,1).\n\nThen at turn 91, move down to (3,1), no food there, so no eat, snake moves, new head (3,1), old positions shift, tail removed.\n\nOld tail was (4,6), removed.\n\nNew snake: head (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) and tail (3,6)? After move to (3,1), no eat, so new positions: [ (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ] and (4,6) removed, so tail is (3,6).\n\nDirection down.\n\nFrom (3,1), possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,2): but (3,2) is now body, index 1, collision, invalid.\n\n- D to (3,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- L to (2,1): (2,1) has food, and it's empty? In this state, (2,1) is not occupied by snake, and no wall, so I can move there.\n\n- R to (4,1): (4,1) what is it? Walls: not border. Obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not listed. Snake: no (4,1), so empty.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nIf I go L to (2,1), I eat the food there, since (2,1) has food.\n\nThen new head (2,1), grow, snake longer.\n\nIf R to (4,1), no food, just move.\n\nBut (2,1) food has life span 4, so it will be there for a while.\n\nNow, comparing the two options at turn 91:\n\n- If I go L to (2,2) at t91, then at t92 I must go D to (2,1) to eat food, and I get +1 at t92.\n\n- If I go D to (3,1) at t91, then at t92 I can go to (2,1) to eat food, or to (4,1).\n\nIn both cases, I can eat (2,1) food soon.\n\nBut in first case, I eat at t92, in second case, I could eat at t92 if I choose to from (3,1).\n\nBut also, there is food at (1,6) with short life span, only until turn 92.\n\nAt turn 91, (1,6) is present, life span 2, so on turn 91 and 92.\n\nIf I don't go towards it, I might miss it.\n\nCurrently, head at (3,2), (1,6) is at distance |3-1| + |2-6| = 2+4=6, not close.\n\nWith one move, to (2,2) or (3,1), still far.\n\nTo reach (1,6) in one turn, impossible; minimum two turns, but from (3,2), to (2,2) then to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, not possible, or to (1,2) but wall.\n\nFrom (3,2), if I could go up, but (3,3) is body, blocked.\n\nSo from current position, I cannot reach (1,6) directly because paths are blocked.\n\nFor example, to go to (1,6), I need to go to (2,2) then to (2,3)? (2,3) is body, occupied.\n\nOr from (3,2) down to (3,1), then to (2,1) or (4,1), not towards (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at top, head at bottom.\n\ny=6 is top, y=0 bottom? y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Walls y=0 and y=7, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nIn grid, usually y increases up, but in coordinates, it might be arbitrary, but here walls y=0 and y=7, so let's assume y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSnake head at (3,2), which is low y, (1,6) is high y, so far.\n\nTo go to (1,6), I need to move up and left.\n\nBut from (3,2), moving up to (3,3) is body, blocked.\n\nMoving left to (2,2), then from (2,2), I can only go down to (2,1) as we saw, which is down, away from (1,6).\n\nIf I go down to (3,1) at t91, then to (2,1) or (4,1), both low y.\n\nSo I cannot reach (1,6) in time; it disappears after turn 92, and by turn 92, I can be at (2,1) or (4,1), not near (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is near the tail area; tail is at (4,6) or after move (3,6).\n\nBut from head, no direct path without colliding or hitting walls.\n\nFor example, to go to (1,6), I need to go through (1,5) or (2,6), but (1,5) is body, (2,6) is body.\n\nIn current snake, (1,5) is index 11, (2,6) is index 13, both occupied.\n\nAfter moves, they might move, but to reach (1,6) by turn 92, I need to be there at t92 or before.\n\nAt t91, from (3,2), I can go to (2,2) or (3,1), neither is (1,6).\n\nAt t92, if at (2,2), I go to (2,1), which is farther.\n\nIf at (3,1), I can go to (2,1) or (4,1).\n\n(1,6) is not reachable in one step from these.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to eat (1,6) food; it will expire without being eaten. So I should ignore it and focus on other food.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,6) is on tail, and tail is moving.\n\nIn the state, food at (4,6) is present, but tail is at (4,6), so when tail moves, if head doesn't move there immediately, it might be eatable later.\n\nBut life span is 7, long.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) on body.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nAt turn 91, I have two choices: L to (2,2) or D to (3,1).\n\nIf I choose L to (2,2) at t91:\n\n- Then at t92, I must go D to (2,1) to eat food, +1 score.\n\n- New head (2,1), direction down.\n\n- Then from (2,1), I can go L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nIf I choose D to (3,1) at t91:\n\n- Then at t92, I can go L to (2,1) to eat food, +1, or R to (4,1).\n\nIf I go to (2,1) to eat, I get the food same as above, but one turn later? At t91 if I go D, I don't eat yet; at t92 I eat.\n\nIn first case, at t91 go L, no eat; t92 go D, eat.\n\nIn second case, t91 go D, no eat; t92 go L to (2,1), eat.\n\nSo in both, I eat (2,1) at t92 or t92, same time.\n\nBut in first path, when I go to (2,2) at t91, I have no choice at t92; I must go D to (2,1).\n\nIn second path, at t91 go to (3,1), then at t92 I can choose to go to (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nIf I go to (2,1), I eat, same as first.\n\nIf I go to (4,1), I avoid eating now, but I can eat later, but (2,1) has life span 4, so I can eat it later, but why wait?\n\nEating sooner is better, as I might die later.\n\nBut also, there is risk.\n\nMoreover, by eating, I grow longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut in this case, since grid has obstacles, longer snake might be riskier.\n\nBut let's think about the area.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), I am at (2,1) with a long snake.\n\nThen I need to move to open space.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), after eating, head at (2,1), direction down? In both cases, when I move to (2,1), I am moving down to it, so direction down.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can go L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nNow, (1,1) is left, (3,1) right.\n\nIf I go to (1,1), then head at (1,1), direction left.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U to (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nD to (1,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (0,1): x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,1): but (2,1) is body, since just left it, collision.\n\nSo from (1,1), no possible moves! All directions invalid.\n\nThat's a dead end.\n\nIf at (2,1) I go to (1,1), I die immediately on next turn.\n\nTherefore, from (2,1), I must not go to (1,1); I must go to (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (3,1) from (2,1), then head at (3,1), direction right (since moved right from (2,1)? From (2,1) to (3,1), that's moving right, so direction right.\n\nThen from (3,1), possible moves:\n\nU to (3,2): likely body\n\nD to (3,0): wall\n\nL to (2,1): body\n\nR to (4,1): which might be empty\n\nNow, in the state after eating (2,1) and moving to (3,1), let's see positions.\n\nAssume at t92, I ate (2,1), so snake positions: head (2,1), then after move to (3,1), no food, so new head (3,1), and body shifts.\n\nFirst, after eating at (2,1), positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ] 17 segments.\n\nThen from (2,1) move to (3,1), no food at (3,1), so new head (3,1), and tail removed, so new positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] and (3,6) removed, tail at (2,6).\n\nDirection right.\n\nFrom (3,1), possible moves:\n\nU to (3,2): (3,2) is index 3 in new positions? Index 0: (3,1) head, 1: (2,1), 2: (2,2), 3: (3,2), so (3,2) is body, collision.\n\nD to (3,0): wall, invalid.\n\nL to (2,1): (2,1) is index 1, body, collision.\n\nR to (4,1): (4,1) not wall, not obstacle, and not in positions, so empty.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (4,1).\n\nThen to (4,1), no food, etc.\n\nBut this is getting messy.\n\nBack to turn 91.\n\nIf at turn 91 I choose to go down to (3,1), then at turn 92 I have a choice: go left to (2,1) to eat food, or go right to (4,1).\n\nIf I go to (2,1) at t92, I eat, +1, then at (2,1), I must go to (3,1) as above, since (1,1) is dead end.\n\nFrom (2,1) after eating, I can go to (3,1) only, as (1,1) is suicide.\n\nThen to (3,1), then only to (4,1).\n\nIf at t92 from (3,1) I go directly to (4,1) without eating (2,1) yet.\n\nAt t91: move D to (3,1), no eat, positions: head (3,1), body: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) tail.\n\nDirection down.\n\nAt t92, I can move to (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nIf I move to (2,1): there is food, so I eat it, grow. New head (2,1), positions: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ] 17 segments, direction left (since moved left from (3,1)? From (3,1) to (2,1) is left, so direction left.\n\nThen from (2,1), possible moves: U to (2,2): (2,2) not in positions? Positions have (3,2), but not (2,2). New positions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), etc. So (2,2) is not occupied, and not wall.\n\n(2,2) is empty? Walls: no, obstacles: no, snake: not in list, so empty.\n\nD to (2,0): wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,1): empty, as before.\n\nR to (3,1): body, index 1, collision.\n\nSo from (2,1), I can go U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\nBut if I go L to (1,1), as before, dead end, no moves.\n\nSo I must go U to (2,2).\n\nThen to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut let's avoid that for now.\n\nIf at t92 from (3,1) I go to (4,1) instead of eating.\n\nMove R to (4,1), no food, so new head (4,1), body shifts, tail removed.\n\nNew positions: [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] tail at (2,6), since (3,6) removed.\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen from (4,1), possible moves:\n\nU to (4,2): (4,2) is index 3, body, collision.\n\nD to (4,0): wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,1): (3,1) is index 1, body, collision.\n\nR to (5,1): (5,1) is obstacle! Internal obstacle (5,1), so wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (4,1), no possible moves! Dead end.\n\nTherefore, if I go to (4,1) at t92, I die.\n\nSo from (3,1) at t92, I cannot go to (4,1); I must go to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nIn both cases, I end up eating (2,1) at some point.\n\nBut to maximize long-term, I need to consider other food.\n\nThere is food at (4,6) on tail, and (5,4) on body.\n\n(4,6) is tail, and after moves, tail moves.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat, tail moves to (3,6) or something.\n\nAlso, (5,4) is on body, so when the snake moves, that cell might be freed.\n\nBut let's think about the grid and available space.\n\nThe snake is long and in a crowded area with obstacles.\n\nI need to find a path to open space or to other food.\n\nFood at (4,6) is at the tail, which is currently at (4,6) but will move.\n\nSince I am eating (2,1) soon, the snake will grow, making it longer and harder to move.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (2,1) immediately to keep the snake shorter, but (2,1) will disappear after turn 94, so I can eat it later, but with risk.\n\nBut from above, if I don't eat it, I might be forced to eat or die.\n\nIn the path where I go to (3,1) at t91, then at t92 I must go to (2,1) to eat, because going to (4,1) is death.\n\nSimilarly, in the other path, I also eat at t92.\n\nSo in both cases, I will eat (2,1) at turn 92.\n\nThen after that, I am at (2,1) with a long snake, and I must go to (2,2) or (3,1), but (3,1) might be occupied.\n\nLet's assume I am at (2,1) after eating at t92, head at (2,1), direction down.\n\nThen I must go to (3,1) because (1,1) is dead end.\n\nGo R to (3,1).\n\nThen at (3,1), as before, only move to (4,1), but (4,1) is not dead end only if I can go somewhere.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1) from (2,1), positions: head (3,1), body: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), etc., as before.\n\nFrom (3,1), only move to (4,1), but (4,1) is empty, but after moving to (4,1), then from (4,1), as before, all moves invalid because U to (4,2) body, D wall, L body, R obstacle.\n\nSo death.\n\nUnless there is food or something, but no.\n\nSo if I eat (2,1), I end up in a dead end soon.\n\nTherefore, eating (2,1) leads to death.\n\nI need to avoid eating (2,1) or find a way out.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, I should not go towards (2,1).\n\nAt turn 91, if I go down to (3,1), then at t92, I can go to (4,1), but we saw that from (4,1) no moves.\n\nBut (4,1) is not necessarily dead if the snake has moved.\n\nAt t91, if I go to (3,1), positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nAt t92, if I move to (4,1), new head (4,1), then new positions: [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] tail at (2,6)\n\nThen from (4,1), as before, U to (4,2) body, D wall, L to (3,1) body, R to (5,1) obstacle, all invalid, so death on next turn.\n\nIf I move to (2,1) at t92, I eat, grow, then at (2,1), I can go U to (2,2) or L to (1,1), but L to (1,1) dead end, so U to (2,2).\n\nGo U to (2,2), no food, so new head (2,2), body shifts, tail removed.\n\nPositions after move: from [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ] after moving head to (2,2), no eat, so new positions: [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] tail at (2,6), (3,6) removed.\n\nDirection up (since moved up from (2,1)).\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (2,3): (2,3) is index 11 in positions? Index 0: (2,2) head, 1: (2,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (3,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (5,2), 6: (5,3), 7: (5,4), 8: (4,4), 9: (4,3), 10: (3,3), 11: (2,3), 12: (1,3), 13: (1,4), 14: (1,5), 15: (2,5), 16: (2,6) tail.\n\nSo (2,3) is index 11, body, so moving to (2,3) collision.\n\nD to (2,1): (2,1) is index 1, body, collision.\n\nL to (1,2): obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (3,2): (3,2) is index 3, body, collision.\n\nSo all moves invalid! Death at turn 93.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, if I eat (2,1), I die soon after because the snake is trapped.\n\nI must avoid eating (2,1) or going to that area.\n\nAt turn 91, I should not go down or left if it forces me to eat (2,1).\n\nBut from (3,2), I have only L or D, both lead to (2,1) area.\n\nIf I go L to (2,2), at t92 I must go D to (2,1), eat, then die.\n\nIf I go D to (3,1), at t92 I must go to (2,1) or (4,1), both bad: (2,1) eat then die, or (4,1) die immediately.\n\nSo I have a problem.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (2,2) at t91, then at t92 instead of going D to (2,1), but I have no choice; from (2,2) only D to (2,1) is possible, as U and L and R are invalid.\n\nL to (1,2) wall, U to (2,3) body, R to (3,2) body or not allowed, so only D.\n\nSo I am forced to go to (2,1) and eat, then die.\n\nSimilarly for the other path.\n\nBut this can't be right; there must be a way to survive.\n\nPerhaps I missed a move.\n\nCurrent head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,2) or D to (3,1).\n\nBut U to (3,3) is body, blocked.\n\nD to (3,1) is possible.\n\nBut both lead to death.\n\nUnless I can avoid going to (2,1).\n\nBut from (2,2), I have to go to (2,1).\n\nUnless at (2,2) I can do something, but no.\n\nAnother idea: food on body can be eaten later.\n\nFor example, food at (5,4) or (4,6).\n\nBut I need to free those cells.\n\nFor instance, if I move the snake, the body at (5,4) might move away.\n\nBut with the current path, I'm going to die before that.\n\nPerhaps at turn 91, I should go D to (3,1), then at t92, I go to (2,1) but don't eat? No, (2,1) has food, but I can choose not to move there, but if I move there, I eat it.\n\nAt t92 from (3,1), I can only go to (2,1) or (4,1), both bad, but (4,1) is immediate death, (2,1) I eat then die later.\n\nBut I need to survive longer.\n\nPerhaps there is another food or way.\n\nLet's list all free cells.\n\nGrid 8x8, but walls and obstacles.\n\nWall cells: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo total blocked cells: borders and these.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,3) but (1,3) is snake, etc.\n\nBut snake occupies many cells.\n\nCurrently, snake has 16 cells, grid has 64 cells, walls: top and bottom rows, left and right columns, so 8*2 + 8*2 - 4 corners = 16+16-4=28 walls, plus 5 internal obstacles, so 33 blocked, free cells 64-33=31, snake 16, so 15 free cells.\n\nFree cells include food positions and empty.\n\nFood at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6), (5,4), but (4,6) and (5,4) are occupied by snake, so not free; food is on snake, so the cell is occupied, but food is there for future eating.\n\nFor movement, the cells are occupied, so not free for head to move to.\n\nFree cells are those not wall, not obstacle, not snake.\n\nSo at turn 91, free cells are: for example, (1,1), (1,6) but (1,6) is food, but cell is free? No, (1,6) has food, but it's not occupied by snake, so it is free for head to move to, unless occupied.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nCells not wall, not obstacle, not snake position.\n\nWalls: all with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\nObstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSnake positions: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n\nSo free cells: for x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles and snake.\n\nFor example:\n\n(1,1): not wall, not obstacle ( (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) not), not snake, so free.\n\n(1,6): not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions? Snake has (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,6), so free, with food.\n\n(2,1): not wall, not obstacle ( (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,1) not), not snake, free with food.\n\n(2,2): not wall, not obstacle, not snake, free.\n\n(3,1): not wall, not obstacle, not snake, free.\n\n(3,4): not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions? Snake has (3,2), (3,3), (3,6), not (3,4), so free.\n\n(3,5): similarly, not snake, free.\n\n(4,1): not wall, not obstacle, not snake, free.\n\n(4,5): not snake, free.\n\n(4,6): occupied by snake tail, so not free.\n\n(5,4) occupied.\n\n(5,5): not wall, not obstacle, not snake, free.\n\n(5,6): not wall, not obstacle, not snake, free.\n\n(6,2): not wall, not obstacle ( (6,1) and (6,4) are obstacles, but (6,2) not), not snake, free.\n\n(6,3): similarly free.\n\n(6,5): free.\n\n(6,6): free, but y=6, not y=7, so not wall, free.\n\nx=6, y=6 is within 1-6, so free.\n\nAlso (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), etc.\n\nBut the point is, there are free cells, but the snake is coiled, and from head position, I can only go to (2,2) or (3,1), both of which lead to the death trap at (2,1).\n\nPerhaps I can go to (2,2) then somehow avoid (2,1), but I can't.\n\nUnless at (2,2) I can go somewhere else, but I can't.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (4,6) on tail, if I move the tail, the food can be eaten later.\n\nFor example, if I don't go down, but I have to.\n\nPerhaps at turn 91, I go D to (3,1), then at t92, I go to (2,1) but since I eat, I grow, but then from (2,1) I can go U to (2,2), which is free after move.\n\nIn the case where I go to (3,1) at t91, then to (2,1) at t92, eat, then at (2,1), I can go U to (2,2), as I said earlier.\n\nThen at (2,2), as before, all moves invalid.\n\nBut let's see the positions after that.\n\nAt t92: after eating at (2,1), positions: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ]\n\nDirection left (since moved left from (3,1) to (2,1)).\n\nThen at t93, move U to (2,2), no food at (2,2), so new head (2,2), body shifts, tail removed.\n\nTail was (3,6), removed.\n\nNew positions: [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] tail at (2,6).\n\nDirection up (moved up).\n\nFrom (2,2), as before, all moves invalid: U to (2,3) body, D to (2,1) body, L to (1,2) obstacle, R to (3,2) body.\n\nSo death.\n\nTherefore, it seems I am trapped, and I will die soon.\n\nBut this can't be; perhaps I missed a move at the beginning.\n\nCurrent head at (3,2), can I go up? U to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, occupied, so no.\n\nOr down to (3,1), or left to (2,2).\n\nNo other choices.\n\nPerhaps the head direction allows me to move in a way that the body moves and frees space.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (3,1), then the tail moves from (4,6) to (3,6), freeing (4,6), which has food, but (4,6) is far, and I can't reach it soon.\n\nAt turn 91, if I go to (3,1), positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (4,2), ..., tail (3,6)\n\nThen at turn 92, if I could go to a cell that frees space, but from (3,1), I can only go to (2,1) or (4,1), both problematic.\n\n(4,1) is free, but after moving to (4,1), I die because no exit.\n\nUnless there is a way from there.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), if I could go to (4,2), but (4,2) is body, occupied.\n\nAfter move to (4,1), positions have (4,2) as body, so I can't go there.\n\nSo I think I have to accept that going to (2,1) is inevitable and I will die, but that can't be the case for the game.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (2,2) at t91, then at t92 to (2,1), eat, then from (2,1) go to (3,1), then to (4,1), but from (4,1) death.\n\nSame thing.\n\nOr from (2,1) go to (1,1), but (1,1) is dead end.\n\nSo I think the only way is to not eat the food at (2,1), but if I go to (2,1), I eat it automatically.\n\nSo I must avoid moving to (2,1).\n\nBut from the current position, if I go to (3,1), then at t92, I can choose not to go to (2,1), but I have to go to (4,1), which is death.\n\nSo both choices lead to death in a few turns.\n\nBut the food at (1,6) is available for 2 turns, but I can't reach it.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, I should go towards the tail area where there might be space.\n\nFor example, the snake tail is at (4,6), and there is food at (4,6) on tail, so if I move the snake, the tail moves, and I can eat it later.\n\nBut to do that, I need to go up.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can't go up directly.\n\nIf I go down to (3,1), then I'm going away.\n\nIf I go left to (2,2), then down to (2,1), even worse.\n\nSo I think I have no good move, but I must choose.\n\nPerhaps at turn 91, I go D to (3,1), then at t92, I go to (4,1), even though it dies, but I get one more turn.\n\nBut I don't score.\n\nOr go to (2,1), eat, score+1, then die later.\n\nSo better to eat and score.\n\nBut the instruction is to maximize score and survival, so perhaps I should avoid death.\n\nBut in this case, I can't.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (5,4) on body, if I move, it might be freed.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,1) at t91, then body moves, the segment at (5,4) moves to (5,3) or something.\n\nAt t91, after move to (3,1), positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nSo (5,4) is still occupied.\n\nAt t92, if I go to (2,1) or (4,1), not helping.\n\nIf I go to (2,1), eat, then positions include (5,4) still.\n\nBut I'm far.\n\nPerhaps I need to move in a circle or something.\n\nLet's list the snake positions to see the shape.\n\nHead (3,2), then right to (4,2), (5,2), then up to (5,3), (5,4), then left to (4,4), then down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then up? (3,3) to (2,3) left, then down to (1,3)? (1,3) to (1,4) up, (1,5) up, then right to (2,5), then up to (2,6), then right to (3,6), then right to (4,6).\n\nSo the snake is like a mess in the left-bottom, with tail at top-right.\n\nFrom head at (3,2), I can only move left or down, both lead to trapped area.\n\nPerhaps for long-term survival, I should go down to (3,1), then to (4,1), even though it dies, but it might not if the body moves.\n\nBut from (4,1), after moving, the body is at (3,1), (3,2), etc., so (4,2) is body, so I can't go up.\n\nSimilarly, other directions blocked.\n\nSo I think I have to choose to go left or down and accept death soon.\n\nBut let's assume I go down to (3,1) at turn 91.\n\nThen at turn 92, I go to (2,1) to eat, score+1.\n\nThen at turn 93, from (2,1) I go U to (2,2), as only choice.\n\nThen at (2,2), all moves invalid, so I die at turn 93 or 94.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left first, same thing.\n\nSo to maximize, I should go to (3,1) at t91, then to (2,1) at t92, eat, then to (2,2) at t93, die.\n\nScore +1.\n\nIf I go left to (2,2) at t91, then to (2,1) at t92, eat, then to (3,1) at t93, then to (4,1) at t94, die, but at (4,1) I might have a move? No, from (4,1) no move, so die at t94.\n\nBut in this case, I have one more turn.\n\nIn the first case, when I go D to (3,1) at t91, then to (2,1) at t92, eat, then to (2,2) at t93, die at t93.\n\nPositions at t93 after move to (2,2): all moves invalid, so on turn t93, when I try to move, no valid move, so I die, no move made.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIf I go to (2,2) at t91, then to (2,1) at t92, eat, then to (3,1) at t93, then at t93 from (2,1) to (3,1), no eat, so positions: head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), etc.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can go to (4,1) at t94.\n\nThen at (4,1), no moves, die at t94.\n\nSo I survive until turn 94, with one score.\n\nIf I go D first, I die at t93 with score.\n\nSo better to go L first to (2,2) at t91, then D to (2,1) at t92, eat, then R to (3,1) at t93, then R to (4,1) at t94, die.\n\nScore +1 at t92.\n\nBut at t94 I die.\n\nNow, there is food at (4,6) with life span 7, so I can try to go there.\n\nBut with current path, I can't.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), I am at (2,1), and I go to (3,1), but instead of going to (4,1), I have no choice.\n\nFrom (3,1) only to (4,1).\n\nSo I think that's the best.\n\nPerhaps at turn 91, I go D to (3,1), then at t92, I go to (4,1), then at (4,1) I die, no score.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo I should go to (2,1) to score.\n\nSo for turn 91, I should go left to (2,2) or down to (3,1), but to survive longer, go left first.\n\nLet's see the head direction.\n\nCurrent direction L, if I go L, it's consistent, if I go D, it's turn.\n\nBut not important.\n\nSo I think for turn 91, move L to (2,2).\n\nThen for turn 92, move D to (2,1) and eat.\n\nThen for turn 93, from (2,1) move R to (3,1) (since U to (2,2) may not be possible, but after eating, at (2,1), direction down, then move to (3,1) is right, so direction right.\n\nThen for turn 94, move R to (4,1), then die.\n\nBut at (4,1), I might be able to go somewhere if the body moved, but no, as before.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 91: L\n\nTurn 92: D\n\nTurn 93: R ( to (3,1) )\n\nTurn 94: R ( to (4,1) )\n\nThen die.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead, so for turn 91 to 95.\n\nTurn 95, I might be dead.\n\nBut let's see if there is a way to get to other food.\n\nFood at (4,6) is on tail, and after moves, tail moves to (3,6) at t91 if I move, etc.\n\nBut I am going to (4,1), far away.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (3,1) at t91, then at t92 go to (4,1), then die, no score, worse.\n\nSo better to eat the food.\n\nSo I think for turn 91, move L to (2,2).\n\nThen the rest as above.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but since I don't know the future, I need to plan a sequence.\n\nBut with the constraints, I can only plan a few turns.\n\nPerhaps at turn 93, from (2,1) after eating, I go U to (2,2), but at (2,2) I die immediately.\n\nWorse than going to (3,1).\n\nGoing to (3,1) allows me to move to (4,1), one more turn.\n\nSo better.\n\nSo for now, I'll go with that.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 91: L\n\nTurn 92: D\n\nTurn 93: R  (from (2,1) to (3,1))\n\nTurn 94: R  (from (3,1) to (4,1))\n\nThen at turn 95, from (4,1) no move, so die, but I don't output turn 95 action.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output for the current turn and a few ahead, but since the state changes, I should output for t91 only, or multiple?\n\nThe format says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for the current turn and subsequent.\n\nBut in the box, it should be the actions for the turns.\n\nFor example, for turn 91, action; turn 92, action; etc.\n\nBut since after turn 94 I die, I can output up to turn 94.\n\nOr perhaps only for as long as I can.\n\nBut let's see the food at (4,6).\n\nAt turn 91, if I move, tail moves to (3,6), freeing (4,6), so food at (4,6) is now on a free cell, but life span 7, so available for several turns.\n\nBut I am at (2,2) or (3,1), far from (4,6).\n\nTo reach (4,6), from (3,2) to (4,6) is |3-4| + |2-6| =1+4=5, min 5 moves, but with obstacles and snake, it may take more.\n\nFor example, from (3,2) to (3,1) then (4,1) but (4,1) is not good, or from (2,2) to (2,1) etc., all leading away.\n\nSo I can't reach it in time with the current path.\n\nPerhaps I should not go to (2,1) and instead go towards the center.\n\nBut I can't from the current position.\n\nI think I have to accept the path.\n\nSo for turn 91, move L to (2,2).\n\nThen for turn 92, move D to (2,1).\n\nThen for turn 93, move R to (3,1).\n\nThen for turn 94, move R to (4,1).\n\nThen stop.\n\nBut at turn 94, after moving to (4,1), I may be able to move on turn 95, but no, as no valid moves.\n\nSo for the answer, I can output up to turn 94.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5 turns ahead, from turn 91, turns 91 to 96.\n\nBut I can only do 4 turns.\n\nPerhaps I can include turn 95, but no move.\n\nSo I'll output for 4 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn 91: from (3,2) move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 92: from (2,2) move D to (2,1), eat food (2,1), score +1\n\nTurn 93: from (2,1) move R to (3,1)  (direction now right)\n\nTurn 94: from (3,1) move R to (4,1)  (direction right, move right)\n\nThen at turn 95, from (4,1), no possible move, so game over.\n\nBut I have output for 4 turns.\n\nPerhaps at turn 93, from (2,1) I can go U to (2,2), but then at (2,2) I die immediately on turn 94, so I survive less.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the above is better.\n\nFor the food at (4,6), it will be there, but I can't eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) on body, may be freed later, but I die before.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nSo the actions are:\n\nTurn 91: L\n\nTurn 92: D\n\nTurn 93: R\n\nTurn 94: R\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to box it.\n\nAlso, for turn 91, action on turn t1.\n\nSo \\boxed{ Turn 91: L \\n Turn 92: D \\n Turn 93: R \\n Turn 94: R }\n\nBut I should think if there is a way to get to the other food.\n\nSuppose at turn 91, I go D to (3,1).\n\nThen at turn 92, I go to (4,1), but then I die at turn 93, no score.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr at turn 92, go to (2,1), eat, then as before.\n\nSo same as above.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (3,1) at t91, then at t92 go to (2,1), eat, then at t93 from (2,1) go to (2,2), then at (2,2) die, so only 3 turns with score.\n\nWorse than 4 turns with score.\n\nSo the sequence with going L first is better.\n\nSo I think that's the best.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and simulated possible moves 5+ turns ahead. The snake is in a constrained area with limited safe moves due to walls, obstacles, and its own body. The food at (2,1) is the most accessible positive food, but eating it leads to a dead end shortly after due to the snake's length and the grid layout. However, avoiding it results in immediate death with no score. Therefore, the optimal path is to eat the food at (2,1) to gain +1 score and extend survival by one turn, while accepting that the snake will die by turn 95. Other foods (e.g., (1,6), (4,6), (5,4)) are inaccessible within their life spans due to distance and obstacles.\n\n### Key Reasoning:\n- **Turn 91 (Current State)**: Head at (3,2), direction left. Possible moves: Left (L) to (2,2) or Down (D) to (3,1). Up and Right are invalid (Up to body, Right is reverse and to body). Moving Left to (2,2) is chosen to set up access to (2,1) food.\n- **Turn 92**: From (2,2), only Down to (2,1) is valid (Left to wall, Up to body, Right invalid). Moving to (2,1) eats the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to 17 segments).\n- **Turn 93**: From (2,1), direction down after move. Possible moves: Left to (1,1) (dead end), Up to (2,2) (body), Down to wall. Only Right to (3,1) is valid.\n- **Turn 94**: From (3,1), direction right after move. Possible moves: Up to body, Down to wall, Left to body. Only Right to (4,1) is valid.\n- **Turn 95 and Beyond**: From (4,1), all moves are invalid (Up to body, Down to wall, Left to body, Right to obstacle). Snake dies at turn 95 with no further moves.\n- **Food Considerations**:\n  - (1,6): Life span 2, disappears after turn 92. Inaccessible from current path due to distance and body/wall blocks.\n  - (2,1): Eaten at turn 92 for +1 score.\n  - (4,6): On tail, life span 7. Freed after tail moves but inaccessible due to path constraints.\n  - (5,4): On body, life span 10. Not freed in time; snake dies before reaching it.\n- **Survival Priority**: Eating (2,1) scores +1 and extends survival to turn 94. Avoiding it leads to death by turn 93 with no score. The sequence prioritizes the immediate score and maximizes turns survived.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 91: Move Left (L) to (2,2) — Sets up access to (2,1) food.\n- Turn 92: Move Down (D) to (2,1) — Eats positive food (+1 score).\n- Turn 93: Move Right (R) to (3,1) — Only valid move to extend survival.\n- Turn 94: Move Right (R) to (4,1) — Final valid move before death.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 91: L \\\\\nTurn 92: D \\\\\nTurn 93: R \\\\\nTurn 94: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 92. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). I should list all wall cells to avoid.\n\nSnake positions: the head is at (2,2), and the body segments follow: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]. So the snake has 16 segments. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it's moving left, which from (2,2) would be towards (1,2), but (1,2) is an internal obstacle, so it can't move there. Head is at (2,2) and direction is left, so next move if it continues left would be to (1,2), but (1,2) is a wall, so that would be a collision. But the snake can change direction each turn, as long as it doesn't reverse instantly.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 3 (disappears in 3 turns)\n\n- (4,6) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (5,4) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (2,2), moving left. But (1,2) is a wall, so it must change direction to avoid death. Possible moves from (2,2): up, down, left, right, but left is to (1,2) which is wall, so invalid. Up to (2,3), down to (2,1), right to (3,2). But (3,2) is the second segment, which is the body, so moving there would cause collision since the body is there and won't move until the snake moves.\n\nLet's think carefully. The snake moves one cell per turn. When the head moves, the body follows, and the tail moves away. So, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by the body except the tail, it collides. But if it moves to the tail's current position, it's ok because the tail will move, so that cell becomes free.\n\nCurrent snake positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). So tail is at (3,6).\n\nFrom head (2,2), possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (2,3). (2,3) is occupied by the 10th segment? Let's index: position 0: (2,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (5,2), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (2,3), 10: (1,3), etc. (2,3) is index 9, which is body, not tail. Tail is (3,6) index 15. So (2,3) is occupied and not the tail, so moving up to (2,3) would cause collision.\n\n- Down: to (2,1). (2,1) is not in the snake positions? Snake positions: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). No (2,1), so (2,1) might be free? But is it a wall? Walls: border x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (2,1) is not border, and internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is an obstacle? (2,4) is listed, but in snake positions, (2,5) and (2,6) are there, but (2,4) is not in snake, it's an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4), so (2,4) is a wall cell.\n\nBut (2,1) is not listed as obstacle, so it should be free, but let's check if it's within bounds. x=2, y=1, grid from 0 to 7, so y=1 is not border, and not in internal obstacles list: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,1) is obstacle, but (2,1) is not, so (2,1) should be free.\n\nAlso, food at (2,1) is present, with value 1.\n\n- Right: to (3,2). (3,2) is the second segment, index 1, which is body, not tail, so collision.\n\n- Left: to (1,2), but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nSo from (2,2), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (2,3): occupied by body at index 9, collision\n\n- Down to (2,1): seems free, and has food? (2,1) has food with value 1.\n\n- Right to (3,2): occupied by body, collision\n\n- Left to (1,2): wall, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is down to (2,1)? But down from (2,2) is (2,1), yes.\n\nBut head direction is L (left), so if I move down, that's not reverse, since reverse would be right (opposite of left). Current direction left, so possible moves: up, down, left, but left invalid, so up or down.\n\nUp to (2,3) is body, collision, so only down to (2,1) is possible without immediate death?\n\nBut (2,1) has food, and it's positive, so eating it would increase length by 1.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls:\n\n- Borders: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7), but since it's cells, all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\n- Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo forbidden cells: walls and obstacles.\n\nNow, snake positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nHead: (2,2)\n\nBody: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nTail: (3,6)\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (1,6): value 1, life span 1, so after this turn, if not eaten, it disappears. Current turn 92, so on turn 92, if not eaten, life span decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\n- (2,1): value 1, life span 3\n\n- (4,6): value 1, life span 6\n\n- (5,4): value 1, life span 9. But (5,4) is currently occupied by the snake? Snake positions: (5,4) is index 5, which is body. Food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there later.\n\nSpecial case: food under body can be eaten only if the body moves away and then head moves there.\n\nBut for now, (5,4) has food, but it's under the snake body, so not accessible immediately.\n\nSimilarly, other foods: (1,6) is not in snake positions, (2,1) not, (4,6) not.\n\n(1,6): let's see if occupied: snake has (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,6), so free.\n\n(2,1) free.\n\n(4,6) free.\n\n(5,4) occupied by snake body.\n\nBack to possible moves from (2,2):\n\n- Up: (2,3) is occupied by snake body at index 9, and it's not the tail, so moving there would collide with body.\n\n- Down: (2,1) is not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: (2,1) not listed, walls: (2,1) not wall, so free. And food there.\n\n- Right: (3,2) occupied by index 1, body, collision.\n\n- Left: (1,2) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only down to (2,1) is possible.\n\nBut is that safe? Moving to (2,1) would eat the food, so snake grows to 17 segments. New head at (2,1), and tail remains, so the body segments shift.\n\nAfter moving down to (2,1), new positions: head at (2,1), then the previous head (2,2) becomes body, so new snake: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] tail at (3,6).\n\nFood at (2,1) is eaten, so removed.\n\nNow, life span of other food: (1,6) has life span 1, so after turn 92, if not eaten, it disappears. Similarly, others decrease life span.\n\nBut on turn 92, I move to (2,1), so that's the action for turn 92.\n\nThe answer should be for multiple turns: from t1=92 onwards.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 92, only possible action is D (down) to (2,1).\n\nIs that true? Let's double-check.\n\nCould I move up? To (2,3), but (2,3) is occupied by the snake body, specifically (2,3) is in positions, index 9, which is not tail, so yes, collision.\n\nUnless it's the tail, but tail is (3,6), not (2,3).\n\nSo only down is possible.\n\nBut head direction is L, and I move down, which is allowed, not reverse.\n\nReverse would be R, right, but I'm not moving right.\n\nSo for turn 92, action must be D.\n\nThen after that, I need to plan for future turns.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nTurn 92: action D to (2,1)\n\nNew head position: (2,1)\n\nNew direction: down, since I moved down.\n\nNow, food eaten: (2,1) was food, so score +1, length 17.\n\nFood (2,1) removed.\n\nLife span of other food: (1,6) life span 1, so after turn 92, it decreases to 0 and disappears, since not eaten.\n\n(2,1) was eaten on turn 92, so it's gone.\n\n(1,6) had life span 1 at turn 92, meaning it will disappear after turn 92 if not eaten during turn 92. Since not eaten, it vanishes.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) life span 6, decreases to 5 after turn 92.\n\n(5,4) life span 9, decreases to 8.\n\nBut (5,4) is under snake body, so not accessible yet.\n\nNow, on turn 93, head at (2,1), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: from (2,1), can move U (up to (2,2)), D (down to (2,0)), but y=0 is border wall, so (2,0) wall, invalid. L (left to (1,1)), R (right to (3,1)).\n\nNow, (1,1): is it wall or free? Walls: border x=0 etc, (1,1) x=1,y=1, not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) not listed, so should be free.\n\n(3,1): not border, not internal obstacle, internal are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,1) is obstacle, but (3,1) not, so free.\n\nAlso, snake positions: after move, head at (2,1), body: (2,2), (3,2), etc. down to tail (3,6).\n\nSo cells occupied: (2,1) head, (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nSo (1,1) not occupied, (3,1) not occupied.\n\nNow, (2,0) is wall, invalid.\n\nUp to (2,2): (2,2) is now the second segment, body, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\nDown invalid.\n\nLeft to (1,1): free, no food.\n\nRight to (3,1): free, no food.\n\nAlso, direction: current direction down, so moving up would be reverse? Reverse of down is up, so if I move up, it might be instant reverse? Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is down (since I moved down on turn 92), so on turn 93, I cannot move up, because up is opposite to down.\n\nSimilarly, I can move left or right, or down, but down is invalid.\n\nDown to (2,0) wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: left to (1,1) or right to (3,1), both seem safe, no immediate collision.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFood available: after turn 92, (1,6) gone, (2,1) eaten, so only (4,6) with life span 5 (after decrease), and (5,4) with life span 8, under body.\n\n(5,4) is under snake body, so I need to move the body away to access it later.\n\nBut life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, (4,6) at (4,6), life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 more turns if not eaten.\n\nCurrent turn after 92 is 93.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 17 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nI should consider the map.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, cells (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls: borders and internal.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions: head (2,1) after turn 92.\n\nBody: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nTail (3,6)\n\nNow, on turn 93, from (2,1), I can go left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\nIf I go left to (1,1), then head at (1,1), direction left.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: up to (1,2), but (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid. Down to (1,0), y=0 wall, invalid. Right to (2,1), but (2,1) is now body (since head moved, (2,1) becomes body after move), so collision. Left to (0,1), x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nFrom (1,1):\n\n- Up to (1,2): wall, invalid\n\n- Down to (1,0): wall, invalid\n\n- Left to (0,1): wall, invalid\n\n- Right to (2,1): which is occupied by the body, since after moving head to (1,1), the previous position (2,1) is now the second segment, body, not tail. So moving right to (2,1) would collide.\n\nTherefore, if I move to (1,1) on turn 93, I would be trapped and die on next turn, because no valid moves.\n\n(1,1) has no exits; all adjacent cells are wall or body.\n\nSpecifically: up (1,2) wall, down (1,0) wall, left (0,1) wall, right (2,1) body.\n\nAfter moving to (1,1), the snake body includes (2,1), which is adjacent and occupied.\n\nSo indeed, moving left to (1,1) is suicidal; I must not do that.\n\nTherefore, on turn 93, I cannot move left; I must move right to (3,1).\n\nSo action for turn 93: R (right) to (3,1)\n\nThen new head at (3,1), direction right.\n\nNow, food: no food at (3,1), so no eat, length 17.\n\nSnake positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) tail at (3,6).\n\n(2,1) is now second segment.\n\nNow turn 94, head at (3,1), direction right.\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (3,2)), D (down to (3,0) wall invalid), L (left to (2,1)), R (right to (4,1)).\n\n(2,1) is body, occupied, not tail, so moving left to (2,1) collision.\n\n(3,2) is also occupied? Snake positions: (3,2) is index 3? After positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), ... yes (3,2) is the fourth segment, body, occupied.\n\n(4,1): let's see, is it free? Not wall: x=4,y=1, not border, internal obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) not listed, so free. Not occupied by snake? Snake positions no (4,1), so free.\n\nR to (4,1) free.\n\nU to (3,2) occupied, collision.\n\nD invalid.\n\nL to (2,1) occupied, collision.\n\nSo only possible move: R to (4,1)\n\nAction turn 94: R to (4,1)\n\nNew head (4,1), direction right.\n\nNow turn 95, head at (4,1), direction right.\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (4,2)), D (down to (4,0) wall invalid), L (left to (3,1)), R (right to (5,1)).\n\n(3,1) is now body (second segment), occupied, not tail, so moving left collision.\n\n(4,2) is occupied? Snake positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), ... (4,2) is the sixth segment? Positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), etc. Yes, (4,2) is sixth segment, body.\n\n(5,1): is it free? (5,1) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nR to (5,1) wall.\n\nU to (4,2) occupied, collision.\n\nD invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) occupied, collision.\n\nNo valid moves? But that can't be.\n\n(4,1) has adjacent cells: up (4,2), down (4,0) invalid, left (3,1), right (5,1).\n\n(4,2) occupied by body, (3,1) occupied by body, (5,1) wall.\n\nAll invalid? But I need to move.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in positions.\n\nAfter turn 94: head at (4,1)\n\nBody: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nTail (3,6)\n\nSo from (4,1):\n\n- Up to (4,2): (4,2) is fifth segment? Head (4,1), then (3,1) first body, (2,1) second, (2,2) third, (3,2) fourth, (4,2) fifth, yes occupied.\n\n- Down to (4,0) wall\n\n- Left to (3,1): (3,1) is first body segment, occupied\n\n- Right to (5,1): (5,1) is internal obstacle, wall\n\nIndeed, no valid moves. Snake is trapped and will die on turn 95.\n\nBut that can't be right; I must have gone wrong earlier.\n\nLet's go back to turn 93.\n\nOn turn 93, from (2,1), I moved right to (3,1), but that led to trap.\n\nOn turn 93, I had to move right because left was worse.\n\nBut on turn 92, I moved down to (2,1), which was the only choice.\n\nPerhaps I missed something on turn 92.\n\nAt turn 92, head at (2,2), direction L.\n\nOnly possible move down to (2,1).\n\nBut after that, on turn 93, from (2,1), I had to move right to (3,1), then to (4,1) on turn 94, then trapped.\n\nBut at (4,1), it's surrounded.\n\nBut let's list the free cells or something.\n\nPerhaps the food at (4,6) can be targeted.\n\nBut in this path, I didn't go there.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 93, when at (2,1), I moved right to (3,1), but is there another option? No, only right or left, left was suicide.\n\nBut right led to trap later.\n\nUnless I can move differently earlier.\n\nBut on turn 92, only down was possible.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the tail or something.\n\nAnother idea: the head is at (2,2), and the tail is at (3,6), so if I can move in a way to free up space.\n\nBut from (2,2), only down to (2,1) is possible.\n\nThen from (2,1), only right to (3,1).\n\nThen from (3,1), only right to (4,1), since up to (3,2) is body, down invalid, left to (2,1) body.\n\nThen from (4,1), no moves.\n\nBut (4,1) is at (4,1), and (4,2) is body, (3,1) body, (5,1) wall, (4,0) wall.\n\nSo yes, trapped.\n\nBut this means the snake dies on turn 95, which is bad.\n\nBut I need to survive long-term.\n\nPerhaps at some point, the body moves, freeing cells.\n\nFor example, when the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells can become free.\n\nIn this case, when I move from (4,1) on turn 95, if I could move, but I can't.\n\nLet's list the grid with snake and walls.\n\nI should make a grid representation.\n\nGrid rows y=7 to y=0, columns x=0 to x=7.\n\ny=7: row 7: cells (0,7) to (7,7), all border walls except where internal? No, border walls are all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so the entire outer layer is wall.\n\nThen internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nNow, snake after turn 92: head (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nSo let's map for turn 93.\n\nAt turn 93, head at (2,1) after move? Turn 93 I move from (2,1).\n\nBefore move, positions are as above.\n\nBut for move options, from (2,1), adjacent cells:\n\n- North (y+1): (2,2) occupied by body\n\n- South (y-1): (2,0) wall\n\n- West (x-1): (1,1) free? Not wall, not occupied\n\n- East (x+1): (3,1) free? Not wall, not occupied\n\nAs I had.\n\n(1,1) is free, but moving there leads to death next turn.\n\n(3,1) free, but then to (4,1) which is free at that time, but then stuck.\n\nFrom (3,1) on turn 93, after moving there, positions: head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nTail (3,6)\n\nFrom (3,1), adjacent:\n\n- N to (3,2): occupied by body ( (3,2) is fourth segment? Head (3,1), then (2,1) first body, (2,2) second, (3,2) third, yes occupied)\n\n- S to (3,0) wall\n\n- W to (2,1): occupied by first body segment\n\n- E to (4,1): free, not wall, not occupied\n\nSo only E to (4,1)\n\nThen at (4,1), adjacent:\n\n- N to (4,2): occupied by body ( after move to (4,1), body includes (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), so (4,2) is fifth segment, occupied)\n\n- S to (4,0) wall\n\n- W to (3,1): occupied by first body segment\n\n- E to (5,1): wall (internal obstacle)\n\nSo no moves.\n\nThe only way out is if (4,2) or (3,1) were not occupied, but they are.\n\nWhen the tail moves, cells free up.\n\nFor example, on turn 94, when I move to (4,1), the tail is at (3,6), which moves when the snake moves.\n\nOn each move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed, so one cell is freed, but only if no growth.\n\nSince no food eaten on turn 93 or 94, length same, so tail moves.\n\nOn turn 93, when I move to (3,1), I eat no food, so tail at (3,6) is removed, new tail is (2,6)? Let's see positions.\n\nBefore turn 93 move, snake: head (2,1), body (2,2) to (3,6) 16 body segments.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1), new head (3,1), new body: (2,1), then the previous body from (2,2) to (3,6), but since no growth, the tail (3,6) is removed, so new body is (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) and tail is (2,6)? Positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) and that's 17 segments, but length is 17, so tail is (2,6), since (3,6) removed.\n\nPrevious positions: 16 segments before move? Turn 92 after eating, length 17: positions from (2,1) to (3,6) 17 cells.\n\nWhen moving on turn 93 to (3,1), new head (3,1), and the body is the first 16 cells of the previous positions, so from (2,1) to (2,6), and tail is (2,6).\n\nList:\n\nPrevious: index 0: (2,1) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (5,2), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,4), 7: (4,4), 8: (4,3), 9: (3,3), 10: (2,3), 11: (1,3), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,5), 14: (2,5), 15: (2,6), 16: (3,6) tail\n\nAfter move to (3,1): new head (3,1), then the body is previous positions 0 to 15: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) and tail is (2,6), since (3,6) is removed.\n\n(2,6) is now the tail.\n\nOn turn 94, from (3,1), I move to (4,1), new head (4,1), body: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) and tail (2,5)? Previous body was (2,1) to (2,6), 16 cells.\n\nAfter move to (4,1): head (4,1), body previous positions 0 to 15: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail (2,5).\n\nNow at (4,1), adjacent cells:\n\n- N (4,2): in body, (4,2) is fifth segment? Head (4,1), body: (3,1) first, (2,1) second, (2,2) third, (3,2) fourth, (4,2) fifth, occupied\n\n- S (4,0) wall\n\n- W (3,1) occupied, first body segment\n\n- E (5,1) wall\n\nNo free cells, so no move possible, collision or wall, snake dies.\n\nBut this is only after two moves from turn 92.\n\nAt turn 92, head at (2,2), only move down to (2,1), but that leads to death in two turns.\n\nThat can't be the intended state; perhaps I misread the snake positions or something.\n\nLet's double-check the initial snake positions.\n\nInitial at turn 92: snake positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nHead (2,2), tail (3,6)\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down to (2,1) is possible, as (2,1) is free and not wall.\n\nBut then at (2,1), moving left to (1,1) is possible but leads to immediate death next turn, or right to (3,1) which leads to death in two turns.\n\nSo either way, snake dies soon.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense for the game; perhaps I need to consider that on turn 92, there might be another way, but from (2,2), only down is possible.\n\nUnless I can move to the tail or something.\n\n(2,3) is adjacent, but (2,3) is body, not tail; tail is (3,6), far away.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to a cell that will be freed, but for immediate move, only (2,1) is free.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (5,4) is under the body, but I can't eat it now.\n\nOr (1,6) with life span 1, but at (1,6), which is far, and I can't reach it in one turn.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (1,6) is not adjacent.\n\nSo for turn 92, only move is down to (2,1), and then the snake is doomed.\n\nBut let's confirm the state.\n\nCurrent turn 92, head at (2,2), direction L.\n\nFood at (1,6) life span 1, so if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears.\n\nBut I can't eat it from (2,2).\n\nPerhaps on previous turns, but I have to start from here.\n\nMaybe the snake can survive by moving in a circle or something, but the body blocks.\n\nLet's list all free cells.\n\nGrid cells: for x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 except walls and snake.\n\nWalls: borders, so free cells only from (1,1) to (6,6) except internal obstacles and snake positions.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\n(1,2), (2,4), (5,1), (6,1), (6,4)\n\nSnake positions at turn 92: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nSo occupied cells: snake and walls.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,6) but (1,6) is food, (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), but (4,1) not occupied, (3,1), (4,1), (6,2), etc.\n\nBut from (2,2), only (2,1) is free adjacent.\n\n(3,1) is free, but not adjacent to (2,2); adjacent are (2,3), (2,1), (1,2), (3,2)\n\n(2,3) body, (2,1) free, (1,2) wall, (3,2) body.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps the direction constraint: current direction L, so I can move U, D, or L, but L to (1,2) wall, U to (2,3) body, D to (2,1) free.\n\nSo D is only choice.\n\nBut then death.\n\nUnless on turn 93, from (2,1), if I could move down, but down is (2,0) wall.\n\nOr up, but up is (2,2) body and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo I think the snake is in a bad position.\n\nBut let's assume that for turn 92, I must move D, and then for turn 93, I move R to (3,1), then turn 94 to (4,1), then on turn 95, no move, so I die.\n\nBut the game might continue if I can eat food or something, but in this case, no.\n\nPerhaps at (4,1), if I could move, but I can't.\n\nAnother thought: the tail is at (2,5) or something, but when I move, the tail moves, freeing cells.\n\nFor example, on turn 94, when I move to (4,1), the tail (2,5) is removed, so (2,5) is freed, but that doesn't help (4,1) directly.\n\nFrom (4,1), no adjacent free cells.\n\nSo I think the snake will die on turn 95.\n\nBut perhaps for the answer, I can only do what I can.\n\nFor turn 92, action D.\n\nThen turn 93, action R.\n\nThen turn 94, action R.\n\nThen turn 95, no move, so I can't specify an action.\n\nBut the answer format requires actions for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I need to plan to avoid this.\n\nBut from the state, it seems inevitable.\n\nLet's look at the food: (4,6) is free, at (4,6), which is not occupied.\n\nIf I can reach it.\n\nFrom current position at turn 92, head at (2,2), I go to (2,1), then to (3,1), then to (4,1), then stuck, can't reach (4,6).\n\nIf on turn 93 from (2,1), I could go up, but up to (2,2) is body and reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps the initial direction or something.\n\nAnother idea: the head direction is L, but when I move down, direction changes.\n\nBut I think I have to accept that for turn 92, only D is possible, and then the snake will die soon.\n\nBut let's see the food at (5,4) under body; if I can move the body away.\n\nFor example, if I can make the tail move to free (5,4), but with life span 9, there is time, but in this path, I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps from turn 92, if I don't eat the food at (2,1), but I have to move there, and it has food, so I eat it, growing.\n\nIf I could avoid eating, but in Snake, when you move to a food cell, you eat it automatically; you can't avoid eating if you move there.\n\nSo I have to eat it.\n\nUnless the food is under body, but (2,1) is free.\n\nSo I think for the purpose of this, I should provide the actions until I can't.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to think 5 turns ahead, but here I can only do 2 or 3 turns.\n\nPerhaps on turn 93, from (2,1), I move right to (3,1), then on turn 94, from (3,1), I can move up or something, but up to (3,2) is body, and current direction right, so up is not reverse, but (3,2) is occupied.\n\n(3,2) is body, so I can't move there.\n\nUnless it's the tail, but tail is far.\n\nSo no.\n\nLet's list the position after turn 92: head (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nNow, the cell (3,3) is occupied, but if the snake moves, the tail moves.\n\nFor example, if I can move to (3,1), then to (4,1), then on turn 95, from (4,1), no move, but at that time, the body might have moved.\n\nBut from (4,1), all adjacent are occupied or wall.\n\n(4,2) is body, (3,1) body, (5,1) wall, (4,0) wall.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can move to a different direction earlier.\n\nAt turn 92, only one choice.\n\nI think I have to proceed with D for turn 92.\n\nThen for turn 93, R to (3,1).\n\nThen for turn 94, R to (4,1).\n\nThen for turn 95, no possible action, so I can't include it.\n\nBut the answer should have actions for t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nPerhaps for turn 95, I can choose a move, but all are invalid, so snake dies.\n\nBut in the format, I need to output actions for as long as I can.\n\nSince the snake dies on turn 95, I can only output up to turn 94.\n\nBut let's see the food at (4,6).\n\nIf I could go there, but I can't from this path.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 92, head at (2,2), direction L, but perhaps I can move up or down, but up is to (2,3) which is body, and down to (2,1) free.\n\nBut (2,3) is body, so collision.\n\nUnless the body is the tail, but it's not; tail is (3,6).\n\nSo I think it's hopeless.\n\nPerhaps the special case for tail: if head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, but here no.\n\nI think I must accept that for turn 92, action is D.\n\nThen for turn 93, action is R.\n\nThen for turn 94, action is R.\n\nThen for turn 95, no action possible.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 94.\n\nBut let's see if on turn 95, there is a way, but no.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, I can plan to go towards (4,6).\n\nBut from (2,2), I can only go to (2,1), then to (3,1), etc.\n\nI think I have to go with that.\n\nSo for turn 92: D\n\nTurn 93: R\n\nTurn 94: R\n\nThen for turn 95, I can't move, so I stop at turn 94.\n\nBut the food at (4,6) has life span 6, so after turn 92, it has 5 turns left, but I can't reach it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) under body.\n\nBut in this case, I ate one food at (2,1).\n\nSo score increased by 1.\n\nBut snake dies soon.\n\nFor long-term survival, but here it's not possible.\n\nPerhaps on turn 93, from (2,1), if I move left to (1,1), then on turn 94, from (1,1), I die immediately, so worse.\n\nSo better to move right and live one more turn.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 92: D\n\nTurn 93: R\n\nTurn 94: R\n\nThen no more.\n\nBut for the answer format, I need to output for multiple turns, but I can do these three.\n\nOr perhaps think of turn 95, but no move.\n\nLet's assume that on turn 95, I can move, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps after moving to (4,1), on turn 95, the tail has moved, freeing (2,5) or something, but from (4,1), no adjacent free cells.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nSo for the boxed answer, I'll put:\n\nTurn 92: D\n\nTurn 93: R\n\nTurn 94: R\n\nAnd that's all I can do.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but here I can only do 3 turns including current.\n\nTurn 92,93,94 are three actions.\n\nTurn 92 is the current turn.\n\nSo for t1=92, actions for 92,93,94.\n\nThen for 95, no action.\n\nSo I'll output that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 92):**\n- **Snake Head**: (2,2) with direction Left (L).\n- **Snake Body**: 16 segments (positions listed), tail at (3,6).\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8 (cells from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n- **Walls**:\n  - Borders: All cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7.\n  - Internal Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 1 (disappears after turn 92 if not eaten).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 3.\n  - (4,6): Value +1, life span 6.\n  - (5,4): Value +1, life span 9 (currently under snake body; can only be eaten if body moves away and head later moves there).\n- **Immediate Constraints**:\n  - From head position (2,2), moving left to (1,2) is invalid (wall).\n  - Moving up to (2,3) is invalid (occupied by body segment; collision).\n  - Moving right to (3,2) is invalid (occupied by body segment; collision).\n  - Moving down to (2,1) is the only valid move (free cell with food; no collision or wall).\n- **Movement Rules**:\n  - No instant reverse: Current direction is L, so reverse (R) is not allowed next turn, but D is valid.\n  - Eating the food at (2,1) increases snake length to 17.\n  - Food at (1,6) disappears after this turn due to life span 1 (not eaten).\n\n**Turn 92 Action (Only Valid Move):**\n- Move down (D) to (2,1) to eat food (+1 score, length 17) and avoid death. This is the only safe option.\n\n**State After Turn 92:**\n- **New Head Position**: (2,1) with direction Down (D).\n- **New Snake Positions**: Head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) (tail).\n- **Food Update**:\n  - (1,6) disappears (life span expired).\n  - (2,1) eaten and removed.\n  - (4,6): Life span decreases to 5.\n  - (5,4): Life span decreases to 8 (still under body).\n- **Grid Changes**: Cell (3,6) is freed (tail moved).\n\n**Turn 93 Analysis:**\n- **Head at (2,1), Direction D**.\n- **Possible Moves**:\n  - Up (U) to (2,2): Invalid (occupied by body; collision and reverse not allowed since current direction is D, and U is opposite).\n  - Down (D) to (2,0): Invalid (y=0 border wall).\n  - Left (L) to (1,1): Valid (free cell, no food), but leads to trap (all adjacent cells are walls or body next turn; death on turn 94).\n  - Right (R) to (3,1): Valid (free cell, no food; no collision).\n- **Decision**: Move right (R) to (3,1) to avoid immediate trap and preserve options. Moving left (L) is suicidal, so R is the only safe choice for survival.\n\n**State After Turn 93:**\n- **New Head Position**: (3,1) with direction Right (R).\n- **New Snake Positions**: Head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) (tail).\n- **Food Update**: Life spans decrease; (4,6) life span 4, (5,4) life span 7.\n- **Grid Changes**: Cell (2,6) is freed (tail moved).\n\n**Turn 94 Analysis:**\n- **Head at (3,1), Direction R**.\n- **Possible Moves**:\n  - Up (U) to (3,2): Invalid (occupied by body segment; collision).\n  - Down (D) to (3,0): Invalid (y=0 border wall).\n  - Left (L) to (2,1): Invalid (occupied by body segment; collision and reverse not allowed since current direction is R, and L is opposite).\n  - Right (R) to (4,1): Valid (free cell, no food; no collision).\n- **Decision**: Move right (R) to (4,1) as the only safe option. This extends survival but risks future traps.\n\n**State After Turn 94:**\n- **New Head Position**: (4,1) with direction Right (R).\n- **New Snake Positions**: Head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) (tail).\n- **Food Update**: Life spans decrease; (4,6) life span 3, (5,4) life span 6.\n- **Grid Changes**: Cell (2,5) is freed (tail moved).\n\n**Turn 95 Analysis and Beyond (No Valid Moves):**\n- **Head at (4,1), Direction R**.\n- **Adjacent Cells**:\n  - Up (U) to (4,2): Occupied by body segment (collision).\n  - Down (D) to (4,0): Invalid (y=0 wall).\n  - Left (L) to (3,1): Occupied by body segment (collision and reverse not allowed).\n  - Right (R) to (5,1): Invalid (internal obstacle wall).\n- **Outcome**: No valid moves; snake will collide on turn 95. Planning beyond turn 94 is impossible due to imminent death.\n\n**Long-Term Survival Assessment:**\n- The snake is in a high-risk position from turn 92 onward due to body blocks and walls. Moving to (2,1) on turn 92 was necessary but led to limited mobility.\n- Food at (4,6) is reachable in theory (e.g., via path like (4,1) → (4,2) → ...), but body blocks and direction constraints prevent access.\n- Food at (5,4) under the body requires moving the snake to free the cell, but the snake cannot reach safe areas to facilitate this.\n- **Conclusion**: With only 3 safe moves possible (turns 92-94), the snake maximizes survival by eating one food and avoiding immediate death. Beyond turn 94, no actions are possible.\n\n**Final Actions (Turns 92-94):**\n- Turn 92: D (down) to (2,1) – eats food, avoids death.\n- Turn 93: R (right) to (3,1) – avoids trap from moving left.\n- Turn 94: R (right) to (4,1) – only safe move; prepares for potential future options (though none exist).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 92: D \\\\\nTurn 93: R \\\\\nTurn 94: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 93, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and also internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (2,1), and it's moving down, so direction is D. The full snake body is: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]. Let me list these to understand the shape.\n\nStarting from head: (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (4,2) → (5,2) → (5,3) → (5,4) → (4,4) → (4,3) → (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (1,5) → (2,5) → (2,6) → (3,6). Tail is at (3,6).\n\nFood: There are two food items:\n\n- (4,6) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,4) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive, so eating them increases length by 1. But I need to be careful with the tail reward danger.\n\nCurrent head direction is down, so from (2,1), moving down would go to (2,0). But y=0 is a wall, so I can't move down. That's a problem.\n\ny=0 is the bottom wall, so moving down from (2,1) to (2,0) would hit the wall. Therefore, I cannot move down. Since I can't move down, I need to choose another direction.\n\nPossible moves: Since head is at (2,1), and direction is down, but I can't move down, so I can move left, right, or up? But no instant reverse: since I was moving down, I cannot move up immediately because up is opposite to down.\n\nDirections: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nCurrent direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). Therefore, I cannot move up on the next turn because of no instant reverse.\n\nSo, from (2,1), with direction D, possible moves are L or R, since D is blocked and U is reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nL: left to (1,1)\n\nR: right to (3,1)\n\nNow, check if these are valid. Are there walls or obstacles?\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1) is an obstacle, but (1,1) and (3,1) are not listed as obstacles, so they should be free, unless they are borders.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are borders, y=0 and y=7 are borders.\n\n(1,1): x=1, y=1, not border, not in obstacle list, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1): x=3, y=1, free.\n\nBut I need to make sure I don't collide with my own body.\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nHead: (2,1)\n\nBody: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nSo, (1,1) is not in this list, so it's empty.\n\n(3,1) is not in list, empty.\n\nAlso, (2,0) is wall, so invalid.\n\n(2,1) is head, so moving to (1,1) or (3,1) should be ok, as long as not body.\n\n(1,1) is free, (3,1) is free.\n\nBut (5,1) is obstacle, but that's not relevant here.\n\nSo possible actions: L or R.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (4,6) with life span 6, value 1\n\n- (5,4) with life span 8, value 1\n\nBut (5,4) is currently occupied by the snake body? Snake has (5,4) in its body, position 6 in the list: (5,4) is the 7th segment? Let's index.\n\nPositions: index 0: (2,1) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (5,2), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,4), 7: (4,4), etc.\n\nSo (5,4) is occupied by the snake body.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is not occupied, I think. (4,6) is a food position.\n\nNow, about food under body: it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nFor (5,4), since it's under the body, and food is there, but to eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (5,4), then head moves to it.\n\nBut currently, head is at (2,1), far away.\n\nAlso, life span: (5,4) has life span 8, meaning it disappears after 8 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nCurrent turn is 93, life span 8, so it will disappear at turn 93 + 8 - 1? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 93, life span is 8, meaning it has 8 turns left including turn 93. After turn 93, it has 7 left, and so on, until after turn 100 it disappears? Better to think in terms of expiration.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so at turn t + N, it's gone.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life span L. After turn t, it has L-1 left, and so on. It disappears when countdown reaches 0. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, countdown is L, after turn t, countdown is L-1, ..., after turn t + L - 1, countdown is 0, so it disappears before turn t + L? I think it's better to say it disappears at the start of turn t + L or something.\n\nThe rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor example, if at turn t, life span N, then on turn t, countdown is N. After turn t, countdown N-1. After turn t+1, countdown N-2, ..., after turn t + N - 1, countdown 0, and it disappears. So it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and gone at turn t + N.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,6): life span 6 at turn 93, so present from turn 93 to 98, gone at turn 99.\n\nTurn 93: life span 6, so after this turn, it will have 5 left, so disappears after 6 turns, meaning at turn 99 it is gone.\n\nTurn 93: available\n\nTurn 94: available if life span >1, etc.\n\nSince countdown decreases every turn, at turn t, with life span L, it is available for L turns: turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1.\n\nGone at turn t+L.\n\nFor (4,6): turn 93, L=6, available turns 93 to 98, gone at 99.\n\nFor (5,4): turn 93, L=8, available turns 93 to 100, gone at 101.\n\nNow, back to movement.\n\nFrom head at (2,1), direction down, but down is wall, so must move L or R.\n\nIf I move left to (1,1), or right to (3,1).\n\nI need to think about future moves.\n\nAlso, the grid has obstacles, so I should map the grid.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,1)\n\nBody: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nTail: (3,6)\n\nFood: (4,6) and (5,4)\n\nBut (5,4) is occupied by snake body, so food is there but can't be eaten until the body moves away.\n\n(4,6) is free.\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,1):\n\n- Left to (1,1): is (1,1) safe? Not wall, not obstacle, not body? Body has (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,1) or (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) is free.\n\n(1,2) is obstacle, so (1,1) is adjacent, but not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is free.\n\nAfter moving, the snake will move, so tail will move if not eating food.\n\nSince no food eaten, when I move, the head goes to new position, and the tail end is removed.\n\nSo from turn 93 to 94, if I move to (1,1), new head (1,1), then body: (2,1) becomes segment, and tail (3,6) is removed? Let's see the movement.\n\nSnake positions: after moving, the head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo if head moves to new position, the segment that was at position 1 moves to where head was, and so on, last segment is removed.\n\nSo for example, if I move left to (1,1) at turn 93.\n\nTurn 93: head at (2,1), move to (1,1)\n\nThen turn 94: head at (1,1), body: the first body segment (2,2) moves to where head was, (2,1), but since head was at (2,1), and it moved, so position 1: (2,1) becomes the new segment after head? Let's list indices.\n\nLet positions be P0, P1, P2, ..., P16 for 17 segments? Count positions: from (2,1) to (3,6), let's list all:\n\n0: (2,1) head\n\n1: (2,2)\n\n2: (3,2)\n\n3: (4,2)\n\n4: (5,2)\n\n5: (5,3)\n\n6: (5,4)  // food here, but occupied\n\n7: (4,4)\n\n8: (4,3)\n\n9: (3,3)\n\n10: (2,3)\n\n11: (1,3)\n\n12: (1,4)\n\n13: (1,5)\n\n14: (2,5)\n\n15: (2,6)\n\n16: (3,6) tail\n\n17 positions, so length 17.\n\nAfter move, if head moves to (1,1), then new head at (1,1), and the body segments shift: the segment that was at index 1 moves to index 0's old position (2,1), index 2 moves to index 1's old position (2,2), and so on, up to index 16 moves to index 15's old position (2,6), and the tail at index 16 is removed, so new tail is what was index 15, at (2,6), but now at (3,6)? After shift, index 15 moves to index 14's position, etc.\n\nGeneral: after move without eating, new positions: new head at new position, then P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1} for the body, but P0 old is now at new head, P1 old is at P0 old, P2 old at P1 old, ..., P_{n-1} old at P_{n-2} old, and P_{n-1} is removed.\n\nSo for n segments, after move to new cell, new head at new cell, then segments 1 to n-1 are at the old positions of segments 0 to n-2.\n\nThen segment n-1 (tail) is removed.\n\nIn terms of positions, new position 0: new head\n\nNew position 1: old position 0\n\nNew position 2: old position 1\n\n...\n\nNew position k: old position k-1 for k from 1 to n-1\n\nThen the last one, old position n-1 is vacated.\n\nFor this case, n=17 positions.\n\nAfter moving to (1,1):\n\nNew head: (1,1)\n\nNew position 1: old P0 = (2,1)\n\nNew position 2: old P1 = (2,2)\n\nNew position 3: old P2 = (3,2)\n\n...\n\nNew position 16: old P15 = (2,6)\n\nAnd old P16 = (3,6) is removed, so tail gone.\n\nThe cell (5,4) is still occupied by the body, since old P6 is now at new position 7, which is old P6 = (5,4), and it moves to new position 7: old P6 = (5,4), but since the snake moves, the body segment that was at (5,4) will move to where it was supposed to.\n\nIn the shift, the segment that was at (5,4) (P6) will move to the position of P5 old, which is (5,3), because P5 was (5,3), and it moves to where P4 was? Let's not confuse.\n\nAfter move, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nThe segment that was at index i moves to the position that was occupied by index i-1, but since positions shift, it's better to think the new position for each index.\n\nAfter moving head to new cell, the new body segments are: for i from 1 to 16, new position i is old position i-1.\n\nSo new pos 1: old pos 0 = (2,1)\n\nNew pos 2: old pos 1 = (2,2)\n\nNew pos 3: old pos 2 = (3,2)\n\nNew pos 4: old pos 3 = (4,2)\n\nNew pos 5: old pos 4 = (5,2)\n\nNew pos 6: old pos 5 = (5,3)\n\nNew pos 7: old pos 6 = (5,4)  // still occupied, but the segment is here\n\nNew pos 8: old pos 7 = (4,4)\n\netc.\n\nAnd old pos 16 is removed.\n\nSo (5,4) is still occupied by the body segment that was there, but it's the same cell, so the food is still under the body? The cell (5,4) has food, and after the move, a body segment is still there, so the food is not accessible yet.\n\nTo eat the food at (5,4), the body must move away, meaning that no segment is on that cell, then head can move to it.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nNow back to current choice.\n\nAt turn 93, from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), then new head at (1,1), direction now L (since I moved left).\n\nThen from there, I can move L, U, or D? But (1,1), x=1,y=1.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,2), but (1,2) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (1,2), so cannot move up.\n\nD to (1,0), but y=0 is wall, cannot.\n\nL to (0,1), but x=0 is wall, cannot.\n\nR to (2,1), but (2,1) is now occupied by the body? After move, (2,1) is new position 1, so it has a body segment, so moving right to (2,1) would collide with body.\n\nLet's see: from new head (1,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: (1,2) - obstacle, invalid\n\n- D: (1,0) - wall, invalid\n\n- L: (0,1) - wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,1) - now has a body segment, so collision, invalid\n\nAll moves are invalid! If I move to (1,1), I die immediately on the next turn because no valid moves.\n\nThat's a dead end.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (1,1) is suicide. I must not do that.\n\nSo only option is to move right to (3,1).\n\nMove R to (3,1).\n\nThen new head at (3,1), direction now R (right).\n\nNow, from (3,1), what can I do?\n\nFirst, possible moves from (3,1):\n\n- U to (3,2)\n\n- D to (3,0) - but y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L to (2,1)\n\n- R to (4,1)\n\nNow, (3,2): after move, (3,2) is now occupied by a body segment? After moving to (3,1), new positions:\n\nNew head: (3,1)\n\nNew pos 1: old pos 0 = (2,1)\n\nNew pos 2: old pos 1 = (2,2)\n\nNew pos 3: old pos 2 = (3,2)  // so (3,2) has a body segment now\n\nLet's list:\n\nOld positions before move: head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), etc.\n\nAfter move R to (3,1):\n\nNew head: (3,1)\n\nNew body:\n\nPos 1: old head (2,1)\n\nPos 2: old pos1 (2,2)\n\nPos 3: old pos2 (3,2)  // so (3,2) is now pos3, occupied\n\nPos 4: old pos3 (4,2)\n\n...\n\nSo (3,2) is occupied by body.\n\nTherefore, from new head (3,1):\n\n- U to (3,2): body collision, invalid\n\n- D to (3,0): wall, invalid\n\n- L to (2,1): now, (2,1) is new pos1, which is body, so collision, invalid\n\n- R to (4,1): what is (4,1)? Is it free?\n\n(4,1): not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (5,1) is obstacle, but (4,1) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nAlso, not in snake body: body positions after move: head (3,1), pos1 (2,1), pos2 (2,2), pos3 (3,2), pos4 (4,2), etc. No (4,1), so free.\n\nTherefore, only possible move from (3,1) is R to (4,1).\n\nI have to move right to (4,1).\n\nNow, at turn 93, I move R to (3,1), then at turn 94, I must move R to (4,1).\n\nAfter that, head at (4,1), direction R.\n\nNow from (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,2)\n\n- D to (4,0) wall invalid\n\n- L to (3,1)\n\n- R to (5,1)\n\nNow, (4,2): after previous move, let's see positions.\n\nAt turn 94: after moving to (4,1), but I need to step by step.\n\nFirst, turn 93: start positions, move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 94: head at (3,1), and I move R to (4,1) as above.\n\nAfter that, new positions:\n\nNew head: (4,1)\n\nNew pos1: old head (3,1)  // which was at (3,1)\n\nNew pos2: old pos1 (2,1)  // from turn 94 head was (3,1), which was new head after turn 93 move.\n\nBetter to track sequentially.\n\nTurn 93 start: positions as given.\n\nAfter turn 93 move: move R to (3,1), so new positions:\n\nHead: (3,1)\n\nBody: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nTail was (3,6) removed, so body up to (2,6), which is now the last segment.\n\nPositions after turn 93 move:\n\n- Head: (3,1)\n\n- Body: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)  // 16 body segments? Original 17 positions, after move, head moved, tail removed, so 16 positions? Head and 15 body segments, total 16.\n\nOriginal: 17 positions, after move, new head and 16 body segments? No.\n\nOriginal positions: 17 cells occupied.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new cell, so one new cell occupied, and tail cell vacated, so still 17 cells, but the segments are renumbered.\n\nNew head at new position, then the first body segment at old head position, second body at old first body, ..., last body at old second last position, and old last position vacated.\n\nSo number of segments remains the same, only the positions shift.\n\nOriginal: 17 segments.\n\nAfter move: new head at (3,1), new body segment at old head (2,1), new body at old pos1 (2,2), new body at old pos2 (3,2), and so on, up to new body at old pos15 (2,6), and old pos16 (3,6) vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nTail at (2,6).\n\nNow turn 94: from head (3,1), move R to (4,1) as only choice.\n\nAfter move to (4,1):\n\nNew head: (4,1)\n\nNew body segments:\n\nFirst: old head (3,1)\n\nSecond: old body1 (2,1)\n\nThird: old body2 (2,2)\n\nFourth: old body3 (3,2)\n\nFifth: old body4 (4,2)\n\nSixth: old body5 (5,2)\n\nSeventh: old body6 (5,3)\n\nEighth: old body7 (5,4)\n\nNinth: old body8 (4,4)\n\nTenth: old body9 (4,3)\n\nEleventh: old body10 (3,3)\n\nTwelfth: old body11 (2,3)\n\nThirteenth: old body12 (1,3)\n\nFourteenth: old body13 (1,4)\n\nFifteenth: old body14 (1,5)\n\nSixteenth: old body15 (2,5)\n\nAnd old body16 (2,6) vacated.\n\nTail now at (2,5)? New last segment is at old body15 (2,5).\n\nPositions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nNow head at (4,1), direction R.\n\nFrom here, possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,2)\n\n- D to (4,0) wall invalid\n\n- L to (3,1)  // now occupied by body, since it's the first body segment\n\n- R to (5,1)\n\n(5,1) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (5,1), so cannot move right.\n\nL to (3,1): but (3,1) is occupied by body, collision.\n\nD invalid.\n\nU to (4,2): what is (4,2)? After move, (4,2) is occupied by the fifth body segment? Positions: head (4,1), body: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), ... so (4,2) is the sixth position? List: pos0: (4,1) head, pos1: (3,1), pos2: (2,1), pos3: (2,2), pos4: (3,2), pos5: (4,2), so (4,2) is pos5, body segment, so occupied.\n\nTherefore, U to (4,2) is body collision.\n\nAll possible moves:\n\nU: (4,2) occupied, invalid\n\nD: (4,0) wall, invalid\n\nL: (3,1) occupied, invalid\n\nR: (5,1) obstacle, invalid\n\nNo valid moves! Dead end.\n\nBut this is after moving to (4,1) at turn 94.\n\nBut at turn 93, if I move right to (3,1), then at turn 94 I must move to (4,1), then stuck.\n\nBut I have to move at turn 93.\n\nOnly choice was left or right, left to (1,1) is dead immediately, right to (3,1) leads to dead in two turns.\n\nBut that can't be right; there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAt turn 93, from (2,1), direction down, but down is wall, so I have to turn, but no instant reverse, so cannot move up, only left or right.\n\nLeft to (1,1) leads to no move next turn.\n\nRight to (3,1) leads to no move after that.\n\nBut the snake must be able to move; perhaps I can eat food or something.\n\nBut no food near.\n\nAnother thing: the head direction is given as D, but at turn 93, I can choose to move L or R, which changes direction.\n\nBut in both cases, I get stuck.\n\nPerhaps the grid has space.\n\nLet's list all free cells or something.\n\nGrid size 8x8, borders walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake positions as above.\n\nHead at (2,1).\n\nCells around: (2,0) wall, (2,2) body, (1,1) free but leads to dead end, (3,1) free but leads to dead end.\n\n(1,1) is free, but after moving there, no escape.\n\nSimilarly for (3,1).\n\nBut is there a way to go up? But I cannot move up because of no instant reverse; current direction is down, so moving up is reverse, not allowed.\n\nThe rule is: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo at this turn, I cannot move up.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nBoth lead to death.\n\nBut that means the snake is trapped? But there must be a mistake.\n\nPerhaps at (2,1), I can move left or right, but let's see if the body blocks.\n\nAnother thought: when I move, the tail moves, so some cells are freed.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (1,1), then at turn 94, head at (1,1), and the body has (2,1), (2,2), etc., and tail was (3,6) removed, so (3,6) is free now, but that doesn't help near head.\n\nFrom (1,1), as I said, all moves invalid: U to (1,2) obstacle, D to (1,0) wall, L to (0,1) wall, R to (2,1) body, all invalid, so snake dies.\n\nSimilarly for right move.\n\nBut perhaps the food can be eaten, but no food at (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nOr (5,4) food is under body.\n\nI think the snake is in a dead end.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions.\n\nMaybe I misread the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nSo from (2,1), it was moving down to (2,2)? Head at (2,1), direction D, so previous move was to (2,1) from above? Direction D means last move was down, so from (2,2) to (2,1), so coming from above.\n\nBut at (2,1), moving D would be to (2,0), wall.\n\nCannot move U because reverse.\n\nL to (1,1), R to (3,1).\n\nNow, (1,1): is it accessible? No walls or obstacles except (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,1) is not obstacle.\n\nSimilarly (3,1) not obstacle.\n\nBut after moving to (1,1), the cell (1,2) is obstacle, so cannot go up, etc.\n\nSimilarly for (3,1).\n\nPerhaps the snake can go to (3,1) and then to (4,1), but (5,1) is obstacle, so (4,1) to (5,1) invalid, and (4,1) to (4,2) is body, etc.\n\nI think it's trapped.\n\nBut let's check if (4,1) is free before moving.\n\nAt turn 93, before move, cells: (4,1) is not occupied by snake or obstacle, so free.\n\nBut after moving to (3,1) and then to (4,1), it becomes head, then from there, no way out.\n\nUnless I can move to (4,2) but it's occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), (4,2) is body, so no.\n\nPerhaps later the body moves, but at that point, from (4,1), no move.\n\nSo I think the only choice is to move left or right, both lead to death in 1 or 2 turns.\n\nBut that can't be; perhaps I should look for food.\n\nFood at (4,6) and (5,4), but far away.\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, x=4.\n\nHead at (2,1), so far.\n\nLife span: (4,6) has life span 6, so available until turn 98.\n\n(5,4) has life span 8, until turn 100.\n\nBut I need to survive first.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to go up, but I can't because of no instant reverse.\n\nUnless at turn 93, I move left or right, but as above, it dies.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can move to a cell that is the tail, but tail is at (3,6), far away.\n\nOr the tail reward danger, but not relevant.\n\nI think I have to accept that from turn 93, moving left or right both lead to death, but since moving left dies at turn 94, moving right dies at turn 95, so moving right gives one more turn, but I need to output the action for turn 93.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for multiple turns, but I need to start from turn 93.\n\nBut if I move right, I can survive to turn 94, then move to (4,1), then die.\n\nBut at turn 94, when I move to (4,1), if there is food, but no food there.\n\nOr perhaps the food at (5,4) can be eaten if I reach it, but I can't from here.\n\nMaybe the snake can turn around.\n\nLet's list the free cells around the head.\n\nAt (2,1): adjacent cells:\n\n- North (2,2): occupied by body (index 1)\n\n- South (2,0): wall\n\n- West (1,1): free\n\n- East (3,1): free\n\nSo only west and east.\n\nWest to (1,1): then from there, no move.\n\nEast to (3,1): then from (3,1), adjacent:\n\n- North (3,2): occupied by body (after move, it will be occupied)\n\n- South (3,0): wall\n\n- West (2,1): occupied by body\n\n- East (4,1): free\n\nSo only east to (4,1)\n\nThen from (4,1), adjacent:\n\n- North (4,2): occupied by body\n\n- South (4,0): wall\n\n- West (3,1): occupied by body\n\n- East (5,1): obstacle\n\nNo free cells, so stuck.\n\nSo indeed, the snake is trapped and will die in at most 2 turns.\n\nBut for the sake of the game, I should move to the one that lasts longer, so move right to (3,1) at turn 93, then to (4,1) at turn 94, then no move at turn 95.\n\nBut at turn 95, when I try to move, no valid action, so snake dies.\n\nBut in the output, I need to provide actions for multiple turns ahead, but since it dies soon, I can only provide for the possible turns.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but if I can't, I have to do what I can.\n\nPerhaps I missed a food or something.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (5,4) is under the body, but if I can move the body away, then eat it, but with current position, I can't reach it.\n\nFor example, the segment at (5,4) will move when the snake moves, but it will move to (5,3) or something, so the cell (5,4) might be free later if no segment is there.\n\nBut in this case, when I move, the segment at (5,4) moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nFor example, after turn 93 move to (3,1), the segment that was at (5,4) is now at old position, but in new positions, it's still occupied.\n\nAfter turn 93 move to (3,1), (5,4) is still occupied by the body segment that was there.\n\nSimilarly after turn 94 move to (4,1), (5,4) is still occupied.\n\nAs the snake moves, the body moves, but (5,4) might be occupied until the segment leaves it.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a way that the segment on (5,4) moves away.\n\nBut with current path, I'm going east, so the body is moving west or something.\n\nLet's see the body movement.\n\nAt turn 93 move to (3,1), then the segment at (5,4) is still there, at new position 7 or something.\n\nAfter turn 94 move to (4,1), the segment that was at (5,4) moves to where (5,3) was, which is still on the grid, so (5,4) is vacated? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 94 move to (4,1), from previous positions.\n\nAfter turn 93 move: head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), etc.\n\nThen move to (4,1) at turn 94: new head (4,1), new body (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)? New positions:\n\nHead (4,1)\n\nBody: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nSo (5,4) is still occupied by body.\n\nThe segment that was at (5,4) is now at (5,4), but it's the same cell.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the segment that was at (5,4) moves to the position that was previously occupied by the segment before it in the chain.\n\nIn this case, the segment that was at (5,4) in turn 93 positions is now at new position, but it moved to where the previous segment was, which was (5,3), so it should be at (5,3) after move.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIn the position list, after move, each body segment takes the position of the previous segment in the previous state.\n\nFor example, for the segment that was at index i, after move, it is at the position that was index i-1.\n\nSo for the cell (5,4), it was occupied by index 6 in turn 93 start positions.\n\nAfter move to (3,1), the segment that was index 6 is now at new position 7, which is old position 6, so still at (5,4)? No.\n\nAfter move, new position k is old position k-1 for k>=1.\n\nSo new position 1: old position 0\n\nNew position 2: old position 1\n\n...\n\nNew position 6: old position 5 = (5,3)\n\nNew position 7: old position 6 = (5,4)\n\nSo (5,4) is still occupied by new position 7.\n\nSimilarly, after next move to (4,1), new position 8: old position 7 = (5,4) from previous, so still occupied.\n\nSo (5,4) remains occupied until the snake moves in a way that the segment moves away.\n\nBut with current path, I can't, and I'm stuck.\n\nSo for turn 93, I have to choose an action, so I'll move right to (3,1), then for turn 94, move right to (4,1), then at turn 95, no move, so I can only output for two turns.\n\nBut let's see the food at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is free, and I can try to reach it.\n\nBut from current position, I can't move there directly.\n\nFor example, if I could go up, but I can't because of no instant reverse.\n\nSo I think I have to accept the situation.\n\nPerhaps at turn 93, I move left to (1,1), and die immediately, but that's worse than moving right.\n\nSo better to move right.\n\nThen for the output, I can say:\n\nTurn 93: R\n\nTurn 94: R\n\nAnd that's all.\n\nBut the format says to think 5+ turns ahead, but I can't.\n\nMaybe I misread the snake direction.\n\nSnake head direction is D, down.\n\nBut in the positions, head at (2,1), and (2,2) is the next segment, so it was moving down to (2,1), so direction is down.\n\nPerhaps the no instant reverse means that I can move perpendicular, but not opposite, which I did.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the head can move to the tail position if it's adjacent, but tail is at (3,6), not adjacent.\n\nOr in general, moving to the tail cell is allowed because the tail will move, so no collision.\n\nBut in this case, from (2,1), tail is far.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think I have to go with moving right.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nPerhaps (2,1) can move up if I ignore the no instant reverse, but the rule says cannot, so I must obey.\n\nSo for turn 93, action R to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 94, action R to (4,1)\n\nThen at turn 95, no valid action, snake dies.\n\nSo for the answer, I can output:\n\nTurn 93: R\n\nTurn 94: R\n\nAnd for turn 95, no action, but I need to output actions only for possible turns.\n\nThe format says to output for turns t1, t1+1, etc., as many as I can.\n\nBut since it dies at turn 95, no action for turn 95.\n\nBut in the box, I can put those two.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to survive by eating food, but I can't reach any food in time.\n\nFor example, (4,6) at (4,6), head at (2,1), Manhattan distance |4-2| + |6-1| = 2+5=7, and life span 6, so if I could go directly, it might be possible, but with obstacles and body, and no direct path, and I'm stuck.\n\nLife span 6, from turn 93, available until turn 98, so 6 turns to reach, distance 7, so impossible to reach in 6 turns, since each move one cell, minimum 7 moves.\n\nManhattan distance 7, so at least 7 turns, but life span 6, so only 6 turns to move, so cannot reach (4,6) in time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is closer, |5-2| + |4-1| = 3+3=6, life span 8, so possible in 6 turns, but (5,4) is occupied, and I need to have the head there when it's free.\n\nBut with current position, I can't even move, so no.\n\nSo I think the snake is doomed.\n\nTherefore, for turn 93, move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 94, move R to (4,1)\n\nThen end.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 93: R\nTurn 94: R\n}\n\nBut let's write it in the format.\n\nAlso, for the tail reward danger, not relevant here.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe snake is currently at position (2,1) with direction down (D). Moving down to (2,0) is invalid due to the wall at y=0. Moving up is impossible due to the \"no instant reverse\" rule (opposite to current direction D). Thus, only left (L) or right (R) moves are possible.\n\n- Moving left to (1,1) leads to immediate death on turn 94, as no valid moves exist from (1,1) (up to obstacle (1,2), down to wall (1,0), left to wall (0,1), right to body-occupied (2,1)).\n- Moving right to (3,1) allows survival to turn 94, but from (3,1), only moving right to (4,1) is valid. From (4,1), no valid moves exist on turn 95 (up to body-occupied (4,2), down to wall (4,0), left to body-occupied (3,1), right to obstacle (5,1)), resulting in death.\n\nSince moving right provides one additional turn of survival, it is the better choice. No food can be reached within their life spans due to distance and obstacles:\n- Food at (4,6) has Manhattan distance 7 from (2,1) but only 6 turns left (life span 6, disappears after turn 98). It cannot be reached in time.\n- Food at (5,4) is under the body and cannot be eaten immediately; the Manhattan distance is 6, but with 8 turns left, reaching it is theoretically possible. However, the snake's trapped position and movement constraints make it unachievable.\n\nThus, the actions prioritize maximizing survival turns, with moves only possible for turns 93 and 94.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 93: R  \nTurn 94: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 94, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (3,1), and the body segments follow down to the tail at (2,6). The head direction is right (R), so it's moving to the right.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (4,6) with life span 5 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,4) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (6,6) with life span 10 and value 1 (positive food)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, so I need to consider how many turns they have left.\n\nNow, I need to plan at least 5 turns ahead. The answer should include actions for turn 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and so on, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead,\" I should plan for several turns.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls:\n\n- Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n\n- Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo, cells that are blocked: all border cells and these internal ones.\n\nSnake positions: list them in order:\n\nHead: (3,1)\n\nThen: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) tail.\n\nThe head is at (3,1), direction right. Since it's moving right, from (3,1), possible moves are: up, down, left, right. But it can't move left because that's opposite to current direction? No, the rule is \"no instant reverse,\" meaning it cannot move opposite on the next turn. Since current direction is right, it cannot move left immediately.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so for turn 94, the next move cannot be left (L), because that would be reverse.\n\nAllowed moves: U, D, R. Not L.\n\nNow, let's see where the snake is. Plot this on a grid mentally.\n\nY-axis from 0 to 7 bottom to top? Usually in grids, y=0 is bottom, but in coordinates, it might be top or bottom. I should assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? In programming, often (0,0) is top-left, y increasing down, but here it might be different. I need to be careful.\n\nThe coordinates: snake positions: (3,1), (2,1), etc. Let's list y-values: from head, y=1, then (2,1) y=1, (2,2) y=2, (3,2) y=2, (4,2) y=2, (5,2) y=2, (5,3) y=3, (5,4) y=4, (4,4) y=4, (4,3) y=3, (3,3) y=3, (2,3) y=3, (1,3) y=3, (1,4) y=4, (1,5) y=5, (2,5) y=5, (2,6) y=6.\n\nAnd borders y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom or top? Since y=6 is tail and y=7 is top wall, probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Similarly x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nIn standard, x horizontal, y vertical, with (0,0) bottom-left or top-left? But walls include y=0 and y=7, and snake has points from y=1 to y=6, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, I think. Similarly x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\n(5,1) is occupied by the snake? Snake has (5,2), (5,3), etc., but (5,1) is an obstacle, not part of snake. Snake positions: (5,2) is a body part, but (5,1) is a wall obstacle, separate.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is wall, (1,2) wall.\n\nNow food: (4,6), (5,4), (6,6)\n\n(5,4) is food, but snake has a segment at (5,4)? Snake positions: (5,4) is listed: after (5,3) is (5,4), which is part of the body.\n\nSnake: indices: 0: (3,1) head, 1: (2,1), 2: (2,2), 3: (3,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (5,2), 6: (5,3), 7: (5,4), 8: (4,4), 9: (4,3), 10: (3,3), 11: (2,3), 12: (1,3), 13: (1,4), 14: (1,5), 15: (2,5), 16: (2,6) tail.\n\nSo (5,4) is the 7th segment, body part.\n\nBut food at (5,4) with life span 7 and value 1.\n\nBut (5,4) is currently occupied by the snake body, so it can't be eaten now. As per rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten when body moves away and head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (4,6) and (6,6), which are not occupied by snake now.\n\nFirst, let's find free cells or possible moves.\n\nHead at (3,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves from (3,1):\n\n- Up: (3,2) but (3,2) is occupied by snake body (index 3)\n\n- Down: (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid\n\n- Left: (2,1) but (2,1) is occupied by snake body (index 1), and also, moving left is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed due to no instant reverse.\n\n- Right: (4,1)? What is at (4,1)? Is it free?\n\n(4,1): not listed in snake positions, not a wall? Walls: internal obstacles include (5,1), (6,1), but not (4,1). Borders: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,1) should be free unless obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). No (4,1), so (4,1) is free.\n\nBut (4,1) is adjacent, let's see coordinates: from (3,1) right to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) y=1, x=4.\n\nNow, is it empty? Snake positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), etc. No (4,1), so free.\n\nAlso, up: (3,2) is occupied, down: (3,0) wall, left: (2,1) occupied and reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is right to (4,1)? But direction: from (3,1) moving right to (4,1).\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n(3,1): x=3,y=1\n\nRight: (4,1)\n\nUp: (3,2) - occupied by snake (index 3: (3,2))\n\nDown: (3,0) - y=0 wall\n\nLeft: (2,1) - occupied by snake (index 1: (2,1)) and reverse direction.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is right to (4,1).\n\nIs that right? But (4,1) might be a wall? Internal obstacles: (5,1) is wall, (6,1) wall, but (4,1) not listed, so free.\n\nAlso, no food there.\n\nSo for turn 94, I must move right to (4,1), no choice.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so moving right is fine, not reverse.\n\nMoving up to (3,2) is occupied, so collision.\n\nDown to (3,0) wall.\n\nLeft not allowed and occupied.\n\nSo only R to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is empty, so yes.\n\nThen, after moving, the snake will have new head at (4,1), and the tail will move, so the segment at (2,6) will be removed? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail end is removed, unless it eats food.\n\nSince no food eaten, length same, tail moves away.\n\nSo after move to (4,1), new positions: head (4,1), then the body: previous head was (3,1), which becomes first body segment, so snake becomes: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)] and tail was (2,6), but since no growth, tail is removed, so (2,5) becomes new tail? Let's index.\n\nPrevious positions: indices 0 to 16, 17 segments? Count: positions list has 17 elements: from (3,1) to (2,6), that's 17 positions.\n\nLength 17.\n\nAfter moving without eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed.\n\nSo new head at (4,1), then the rest: position 0 was (3,1), now body, position 1 (2,1), ..., up to position 15 (2,5), and position 16 (2,6) is removed.\n\nNew snake: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n\nTail is now (2,5).\n\nAnd head at (4,1), direction was R, but after move, new direction depends on the move. Since I moved right, new head direction is R.\n\nNow, turn 95.\n\nHead at (4,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse, so no left.\n\nReverse would be L, since current direction R.\n\nSo allowed: U, D, R.\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n- Up: (4,2) - is it free? (4,2) is in snake positions, index 5? New snake: positions: 0: (4,1) head, 1: (3,1), 2: (2,1), 3: (2,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (5,2), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,4), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,3), 11: (3,3), 12: (2,3), 13: (1,3), 14: (1,4), 15: (1,5), 16: (2,5) tail.\n\n(4,2) is index 5, body segment, so occupied, cannot move there.\n\n- Down: (4,0) - y=0, wall, invalid.\n\n- Right: (5,1) - what is (5,1)? Internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\n- Left: (3,1) - but (3,1) is index 1, body segment, and also reverse direction, not allowed.\n\n(3,1) is directly left from (4,1).\n\nBut moving left is reverse, and it's occupied.\n\nBut in terms of moves, from (4,1), up is (4,2) occupied, down (4,0) wall, right (5,1) wall, left (3,1) occupied and reverse.\n\nNo possible moves? That can't be right.\n\nHead at (4,1), surrounded?\n\nUp: (4,2) is body, occupied.\n\nDown: (4,0) wall.\n\nRight: (5,1) is wall, since internal obstacle (5,1) listed.\n\nLeft: (3,1) is body, and reverse direction.\n\nSo indeed, no safe move? But the snake must be able to move.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake.\n\nCurrent state before turn 94: head at (3,1), direction R, moved to (4,1) on turn 94.\n\nThen for turn 95, head at (4,1).\n\nBut after moving to (4,1), the body segment at (4,2) is still there, but (4,2) is at y=2, not adjacent to head at (4,1)? Head at (4,1), (4,2) is above, so moving up to (4,2) would collide with body.\n\nSimilarly, other directions blocked.\n\nBut (4,1) is not a dead end, but in this position, it seems trapped.\n\nPerhaps the snake can move to cells that will be vacated by tail, but in this case, tail is at (2,5), far away.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells after turn 94 move.\n\nNew snake positions: as above, (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nCells occupied: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nHead at (4,1), so adjacent cells:\n\n- North: (4,2) - occupied\n\n- South: (4,0) - wall\n\n- East: (5,1) - wall (internal obstacle)\n\n- West: (3,1) - occupied\n\nNo free adjacent cells. Snake is trapped, but that can't be, because on turn 94 we moved to (4,1), which was free, but now from there, no escape.\n\nPerhaps the tail movement allows some path, but when moving, the head moves first, and if it collides, it dies.\n\nIn this case, from (4,1), all adjacent cells are either wall or body, so no possible move, snake must collide.\n\nBut that seems like a problem with the state.\n\nPerhaps I misread the snake positions.\n\nOriginal snake positions before any move: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nHead (3,1), direction R.\n\nAfter moving right to (4,1), new head (4,1), then the body: the previous head (3,1) becomes the new first body segment, so the new positions are: head (4,1), then (3,1), then the rest of the body except the tail is removed? No.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head at new position, then the first body segment is the previous head position, second body is the previous first body position, and so on, up to the tail, which is the previous second-to-last or something.\n\nLet's think: positions are a list, head at index 0.\n\nAfter moving to a new cell, new head at that cell, and the body segments shift: the segment that was at index i is now at index i+1 for i from 0 to len-2, and the last segment (tail) is removed if no growth.\n\nSo for positions list S of length L.\n\nAfter move to new cell C, new positions: [C] + S[0:-1]  // in Python terms, new head C, then S[0] to S[L-2]\n\nS[0] is old head, which becomes new body segment 1.\n\nS[1] becomes new body segment 2, ..., S[L-2] becomes new body segment L-1, and S[L-1] is removed.\n\nIn this case, L=17 positions.\n\nBefore move: S = [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6) ]\n\nAfter move to (4,1): new head (4,1)\n\nThen new body: old S[0] = (3,1) becomes new segment 1\n\nS[1] = (2,1) becomes new segment 2\n\nS[2] = (2,2) becomes new segment 3\n\nS[3] = (3,2) becomes new segment 4\n\nS[4] = (4,2) becomes new segment 5\n\nS[5] = (5,2) becomes new segment 6\n\nS[6] = (5,3) becomes new segment 7\n\nS[7] = (5,4) becomes new segment 8\n\nS[8] = (4,4) becomes new segment 9\n\nS[9] = (4,3) becomes new segment 10\n\nS[10] = (3,3) becomes new segment 11\n\nS[11] = (2,3) becomes new segment 12\n\nS[12] = (1,3) becomes new segment 13\n\nS[13] = (1,4) becomes new segment 14\n\nS[14] = (1,5) becomes new segment 15\n\nS[15] = (2,5) becomes new segment 16 (tail)\n\nS[16] = (2,6) is removed.\n\nSo new snake: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nNow head at (4,1), adjacent cells:\n\n- (4,2) directly above: that's the position at index 5, (4,2), which is body, occupied.\n\n- (4,0) below: y=0, wall.\n\n- (5,1) right: x=5,y=1, which is internal obstacle, wall.\n\n- (3,1) left: that's index 1, (3,1), body, occupied.\n\nSo all four directions are blocked, snake cannot move without colliding. On turn 95, whatever move I choose, I hit wall or body, so game over.\n\nBut that can't be the intention, or perhaps it is, but I need to see if there's a way.\n\nFor turn 94, I have to move right, as I thought, but then it dies on turn 95.\n\nBut let's confirm if on turn 94, moving right is the only choice, and it leads to death.\n\nPerhaps the head direction affects what moves are possible.\n\nCurrent head direction R, so for turn 94, I can move U, D, R, but not L.\n\nU to (3,2): (3,2) is in body, index 3, so moving there causes collision with body.\n\nD to (3,0): wall, collision.\n\nL to (2,1): body, index 1, and reverse, not allowed.\n\nR to (4,1): free, so only possible move is R to (4,1), but then on next turn, trapped.\n\nSo the snake is doomed to die on turn 95, no matter what.\n\nBut that seems odd. Perhaps I misread the food or something.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,4) is on a body segment, so it might be eaten later.\n\nBut for now, on turn 94, I have to move to (4,1), then on turn 95, no move, die.\n\nBut the state says turn 94, so I need to output for turn 94.\n\nBut for turn 94, the only action is R.\n\nThen for turn 95, it dies, so no action.\n\nBut the answer format should include actions for multiple turns, but if it dies, I can't.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the state.\n\nLet's list all wall cells.\n\nBorders: all x=0, all x=7, all y=0, all y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo (5,1) is wall, (6,1) wall, etc.\n\nSnake at (4,1), (4,2) is body, (3,1) body, (5,1) wall.\n\nNo other cells.\n\nSo yes, trapped.\n\nPerhaps the snake can move to the tail cell if the tail moves, but in this case, the tail is at (2,5), far, and when moving, the head moves first, so if head moves to a cell that was tail, but the tail moves at the same time, so if the head moves to the current tail position, it is allowed, because the tail will move away, so no collision.\n\nI forgot that rule.\n\nFrom the rules: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nYes, important point.\n\nIn general, moving to a body segment causes collision, except for the tail, because when the head moves to the tail cell, the tail moves away, so no problem, and if it eats food, it grows, but here no food.\n\nIn this case, for turn 95, head at (4,1), the adjacent cells include (3,1) which is body but not tail, and (4,2) body not tail, so moving to them would collide.\n\nThe tail is at (2,5), not adjacent.\n\nSo no, no tail adjacent.\n\nFor example, distance from (4,1) to (2,5) is |4-2| + |1-5| = 2+4=6, not adjacent.\n\nSo no, snake is trapped.\n\nPerhaps on turn 94, is there another move?\n\nBut on turn 94, from (3,1), only R to (4,1) is possible, as U, D, L are invalid or occupied.\n\nU to (3,2) is occupied, so collision if I move there.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo for turn 94, I must move R, and then on turn 95, the snake dies because no possible move.\n\nBut that can't be right for the problem, or perhaps it is.\n\nMaybe the food at (5,4) can be eaten, but it's under the body, so only when the body moves away.\n\nBut for now, on turn 94, I have to move.\n\nPerhaps for turn 94, the only action is R.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, if it dies, I can't plan.\n\nBut let's assume that for turn 94, I output R, and that's it, but the format requires multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I should output for turn 94 only, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format: turn t1: action, turn t1+1: action, etc.\"\n\nBut if it dies on t95, I can only output for t94.\n\nBut let's see the food life span.\n\nFood at (4,6) life span 5, so from turn 94, it will disappear after 5 turns, including current, so on turn 98 it disappears? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 94, life span 5, so it will be there for turns 94,95,96,97, and disappear after turn 97, so on turn 98 it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) life span 7, so on turns 94 to 100, disappear after turn 100.\n\n(6,6) life span 10, turns 94 to 103.\n\nBut since snake dies on 95, not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I misread the snake positions.\n\nAnother idea: the head direction might allow moving to cells that are not immediately adjacent in a way, but no, only adjacent cells.\n\nOr perhaps the internal obstacles are not walls, but the description says \"Cells occupied by walls\" and \"the wall takes up the whole row or column\" but for internal, it's specific cells, so (5,1) is a wall cell, etc.\n\nI think the snake is indeed trapped after moving to (4,1).\n\nBut let's list the grid at turn 94 before move.\n\nGrid at turn 94:\n\nWalls: all border cells and (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSnake: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nFood: (4,6), (5,4), (6,6) but (5,4) is occupied by snake, so food is there but under body.\n\nHead at (3,1), direction R.\n\nPossible actions for turn 94:\n\n- U: to (3,2) - occupied by snake (3,2), so if move, head collides with body, death.\n\n- D: to (3,0) - wall, death.\n\n- L: to (2,1) - occupied by snake (2,1), and reverse direction, not allowed, and if move, collision.\n\n- R: to (4,1) - free, not occupied, not wall, so safe move.\n\nSo only R is possible, move to (4,1).\n\nThen on turn 95, head at (4,1), direction R (since moved right).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,2) - occupied by snake body (4,2) in new positions, so collision.\n\n- D: to (4,0) - wall, collision.\n\n- L: to (3,1) - occupied by snake body (3,1), and reverse direction, not allowed.\n\n- R: to (5,1) - wall, collision.\n\nAll moves lead to death, so snake dies on turn 95.\n\nTherefore, for turn 94, the only action is R, and then game over.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output for turn 94 only, or as per format, I can output for turn 94: R, and for turn 95, it's dead, so no action, but the format says \"turn t1: action, turn t1+1: action, etc.\" so perhaps I should output only for turn 94.\n\nBut that seems short.\n\nPerhaps I can assume that the snake can survive, but logically, it can't.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (5,4) is on the body, so when the snake moves, if the head moves to (5,4) after the body moves away, but currently, from (4,1), it's not possible to reach it directly.\n\nFor example, if on turn 95, I could move, but I can't.\n\nSo I think for this state, the snake must move R on turn 94 and then die.\n\nBut let's check the tail reward danger, but not applicable.\n\nPerhaps for turn 94, since moving to (4,1) is the only choice, I do that.\n\nThen for the answer, I output only for turn 94.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but if I can't, I can't.\n\nMaybe I miscalculated the new positions.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), the body segment that was at (4,2) is still at (4,2), but in the new positions, (4,2) is occupied, so moving up from (4,1) to (4,2) would collide with the body segment there.\n\nUnless the tail is at (4,2), but it's not, tail is at (2,5).\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps the grid has a mistake, or I need to consider that the snake can move to the cell where the tail was, but for adjacent, only if it's the tail.\n\nHere, no tail adjacent.\n\nSo I think it's hopeless.\n\nPerhaps on turn 94, I can move to a different direction, but I can't, because U, D, L are invalid.\n\nU to (3,2): (3,2) is occupied, so if I move there, head collides with body, death.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo only R is possible, and it leads to death next turn.\n\nSo for the answer, I should output:\n\nTurn 94: R\n\nAnd that's it, but for the format, perhaps I need to write multiple, but I can't.\n\nMaybe the life span of food or something, but not relevant.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (5,4) has value 1, but it's under the body, so when the snake moves, if the head can reach it later.\n\nBut from the trapped position, no.\n\nPerhaps for turn 94, moving R is the only choice, so I do that.\n\nThen for the answer, I'll output only for turn 94.\n\nBut let's see the food positions: (4,6) is at y=6, x=4, which might be reachable if the snake were free, but it's not.\n\n(6,6) similarly.\n\nBut with the current situation, no.\n\nSo I think I have to accept that.\n\nFor the answer, I'll say:\n\nTurn 94: R\n\nAnd since it dies, no further actions.\n\nBut to comply with format, perhaps I can write only one turn.\n\nMaybe the internal obstacle (5,1) is not a wall for movement, but the description says cells occupied by walls, so (5,1) is wall.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) etc.\n\nI think I have to proceed.\n\nSo for turn 94, action is R.\n\nThen for turn 95, it dies, so no action.\n\nBut in the answer format, I can write only for turns where action is possible.\n\nPerhaps the snake can survive by eating food or something, but not here.\n\nLet's assume that on turn 94, I move R.\n\nThen for the plan, since it dies, I can't plan ahead.\n\nBut for the sake of the exercise, perhaps I should consider if there was a choice.\n\nAnother thought: the head direction is R, but when I move, the new direction is set.\n\nBut no choice.\n\nI think I should output for turn 94 only.\n\nBut let's look at the food life span to see if I can reach them, but with death, no.\n\nPerhaps the snake is not trapped if I consider the tail moving, but from (4,1), no adjacent cell is tail or free.\n\nSo I think it's over.\n\nI'll go with that.\n\nSo for turn 94, action: R\n\nThen for turn 95, death.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 94: R (right)\n}\n\nAnd that's it, but the format has multiple turns, so perhaps I need to write only one.\n\nMaybe I misread the snake positions.\n\nLet's list the coordinates again.\n\nSnake positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nSo from (3,1), moving U to (3,2): (3,2) is the fourth position, body.\n\nMoving D to (3,0): wall.\n\nMoving L to (2,1): second position, body.\n\nMoving R to (4,1): not occupied, not wall, so only possible.\n\nAfter move, head at (4,1), body includes (3,1), (2,1), etc., and (4,2) is body.\n\nSo (4,1) has no free adjacent cells.\n\nPerhaps (4,1) is not a wall, but it's surrounded.\n\nI think I have to accept it.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll output R for turn 94.\n\nThen for the box.\n\nBut the user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so perhaps in this case, I can't, but for other states, I could.\n\nMaybe for this state, there is a way to avoid death, but I don't see it.\n\nAnother idea: the rule \"no instant reverse\" means that I cannot move opposite to the current direction, but after moving, the direction changes.\n\nBut here, no.\n\nPerhaps on turn 94, I can move U, but to (3,2), which is body, so collision, immediate death.\n\nSimilarly, moving R delays death by one turn.\n\nBut still, I have to move R.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nI'll proceed with that.\n</think>\nThe current state at turn 94 shows the snake head at (3,1) with direction right (R). The only possible move that avoids immediate collision or wall impact is right (R) to (4,1), as other moves are invalid:\n- Up (U) to (3,2) is occupied by the snake's body.\n- Down (D) to (3,0) is a wall (y=0 border).\n- Left (L) to (2,1) is occupied by the snake's body and is a reverse move, which is not allowed.\n\nMoving right to (4,1) is safe for turn 94. However, after this move, the snake will be at (4,1) for turn 95. At that position:\n- Up to (4,2) is occupied by the snake's body.\n- Down to (4,0) is a wall.\n- Left to (3,1) is occupied by the snake's body and is a reverse move.\n- Right to (5,1) is a wall (internal obstacle).\n\nAll possible moves from (4,1) on turn 95 lead to collision or wall impact, resulting in game over. Therefore, no actions are possible beyond turn 94.\n\nThe food items are not reachable due to the impending collision:\n- (4,6) has a life span of 5, disappearing after turn 98.\n- (5,4) has a life span of 7, disappearing after turn 100, but is currently under the snake's body and cannot be eaten from the trapped position.\n- (6,6) has a life span of 10, disappearing after turn 103.\n\nSince the snake cannot survive beyond turn 95, only the action for turn 94 is provided.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 94: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 95, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head is at (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5). So the head is at (4,1) and the tail is at (2,5). The snake has 17 segments.\n\nThe head direction is R, which means right, so it's moving east.\n\nFood positions with life span and value:\n\n- (4,6) with life span 4, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,4) with life span 6, value +1? Wait, it says (5,4,6,1), which I think is (x,y, life_span, value). So for (5,4), life span 6, value 1. But (5,4) is also a position in the snake body. Let me check.\n\nSnake positions: (5,4) is in the list, it's the 9th segment: positions are indexed from 0, so (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), ... So (5,4) is occupied by the snake body.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,4) is listed, but it's under the snake body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n\nAlso, there's food at (4,6) with life span 4, value 1, and (6,6) with life span 9, value 1.\n\nNow, the grid size: from walls, x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, similarly y, so 8x8 grid.\n\nBut walls are at borders, so cells (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0) and (x,7) for all x, but since it's borders, x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n\nNow, snake head at (4,1), direction right.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because that would be instant reverse. Current direction R, so opposite is L, so cannot move L next turn. So possible actions: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n\nNow, coordinates: let's list the grid.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nHead at (4,1), which is x=4, y=1.\n\nMoving right would be to (5,1), but is (5,1) available?\n\n(5,1) is an internal obstacle! Walls include internal obstacles: (5,1) is listed, so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is also an internal obstacle.\n\nLet me list all obstacles:\n\nBorder walls: all (0,y), (7,y) for y=0 to 7; all (x,0), (x,7) for x=0 to 7.\n\nBut since internal obstacles are given separately, I think the borders are only the edges, and internal are additional.\n\nBut (5,1) and (6,1) are internal obstacles, so they are walls.\n\nAlso (6,4), (2,4), (1,2) are walls.\n\n(1,2) is wall.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,1).\n\nPossible moves from (4,1):\n\n- Up (U): to (4,2)\n\n- Down (D): to (4,0), but y=0 is border wall, so (4,0) is wall, cannot move there.\n\n- Right (R): to (5,1), but (5,1) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move there.\n\n- Left (L): but cannot because of no instant reverse, and direction is R, so L is opposite, not allowed.\n\nBut if I can't move D or R because walls, and L not allowed, only U is possible?\n\nLet's confirm:\n\nPosition (4,1):\n\n- U: (4,1) to (4,2) — what is at (4,2)? Snake positions: (4,2) is in the list, it's the 5th segment: indices: 0:(4,1), 1:(3,1), 2:(2,1), 3:(2,2), 4:(3,2), 5:(4,2), ... so (4,2) is occupied by the snake body.\n\nBut when I move, if I go to (4,2), that is currently occupied by a body segment, but in snake game, moving into a body segment is only deadly if it's not the tail, because the tail moves.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if I move to a cell that is occupied by the body, it's collision, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, (4,2) is not the tail; tail is at (2,5). (4,2) is part of the body, so if I move to (4,2), head will collide with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\nAvailable adjacent cells from (4,1):\n\n- North: (4,2) — occupied by snake body (segment at index 5)\n\n- South: (4,0) — y=0, border wall\n\n- East: (5,1) — internal obstacle, wall\n\n- West: (3,1) — occupied by snake body (segment at index 1)\n\n(3,1) is the second segment.\n\nAll adjacent cells are either walls or occupied by body, except possibly, but (4,2) and (3,1) are body, (5,1) wall, (4,0) wall.\n\nBut I have to move somewhere. Is there no safe move?\n\nLet's list the snake positions again: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n\nSo head at (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), etc.\n\nAdjacent cells to head (4,1):\n\n- Left: (3,1) - occupied by body\n\n- Right: (5,1) - wall (internal obstacle)\n\n- Up: (4,2) - occupied by body (since (4,2) is in positions)\n\n- Down: (4,0) - wall\n\nAll directions are blocked? But that can't be, because the snake must have a way to move or it would have died already.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to (4,1) from previous? Turn 95, state given for turn 95, head at (4,1), direction R.\n\nPrevious position: since direction R, it came from west, so from (3,1) to (4,1). (3,1) is now the second segment.\n\nBut at turn 95, head is at (4,1), and we need to choose action for turn 95.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves U, D, L, R but with constraints.\n\nL is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed.\n\nR to (5,1) is wall.\n\nD to (4,0) is wall.\n\nU to (4,2) is occupied by snake body.\n\nSo all possible moves are invalid? That means the snake is trapped and will die on this turn unless I can move to the tail or something.\n\nBut the tail is at (2,5), not adjacent.\n\n(4,2) is occupied, and it's not the tail.\n\nPerhaps I misidentified the positions.\n\nLet's plot the grid.\n\nMake a grid for y from 0 to 7, x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo mark those as walls.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (4,1)\n\nThen: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nTail: (2,5)\n\nNow, from (4,1):\n\n- Up: (4,2) - has snake body (the segment at (4,2))\n\n- Down: (4,0) - wall\n\n- Left: (3,1) - has snake body\n\n- Right: (5,1) - wall (internal obstacle)\n\nNo empty cells adjacent. But the snake has to move, so it must be that one of these is the tail or something, but (4,2) is not the tail; tail is far away.\n\nAccording to the rules, moving into a body segment is fatal unless it is the tail and the tail moves away.\n\nHere, (4,2) is the position of a body segment, and it's not the tail, so moving to (4,2) would cause collision with body.\n\nSimilarly for (3,1).\n\nSo no safe move? But that can't be right for this state; perhaps I have a mistake.\n\nHead direction is R, so it was moving right to (4,1). From where? If it was at (3,1) at turn 94, and moved right to (4,1) at turn 95.\n\nAt turn 95, head is at (4,1), and we choose action for this turn to move to next position.\n\nBut all adjacent cells are occupied or walls.\n\nPerhaps the food under body can be eaten, but for that, the body must move away first, but at this turn, head is not on food.\n\nFood is at (4,6), (5,4), (6,6), but (5,4) is under snake body.\n\nBut for head to eat, it needs to move to that cell after body moves away.\n\nBut here, from current position, no move is possible.\n\nUnless... is (5,1) not a wall? Let's check the internal obstacles: (5,1) is listed, so it is a wall.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is wall.\n\n(4,0) is border wall.\n\n(4,2) is snake body.\n\n(3,1) is snake body.\n\nSo indeed, no safe move from (4,1). That means the snake is trapped and will die on this turn if it moves anywhere.\n\nBut that can't be the case; perhaps I misread the positions.\n\nAnother possibility: when the snake moves, the tail moves, so the cell that was occupied by tail might become free.\n\nBut at the moment of move, for the head to move to a cell, it must be free or the tail.\n\nIn this case, for turn 95, when we move the head, the tail will move only after the head moves and we add a new segment if food eaten, but in general, when head moves, the tail moves at the same time, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n\nBut for the head to move to a cell, that cell must be empty or the tail cell.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if the head moves to the tail's current position, it is safe because the tail will move away.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (2,5), which is not adjacent to head (4,1), so not possible.\n\nAdjacent cells are only (4,2), (3,1), (5,1), (4,0), all of which are occupied or walls, and none is the tail.\n\n(3,1) is the second segment, not tail.\n\nSo the only possible move is to (4,2) or (3,1), but both are body segments, not tail, so collision.\n\nPerhaps for (4,2), since it is occupied, but when the snake moves, if head moves to (4,2), and (4,2) is a body segment, but after move, that segment might move, but in standard snake, moving to a body cell is death unless it is the tail.\n\nThe rule says: \"head touches any body segment\" is deadly, but exception for tail.\n\nHere, (4,2) is not the tail, so it should be death.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is not tail.\n\nSo no valid move, snake dies.\n\nBut that can't be right for the problem; perhaps I have a mistake in the position list.\n\nLet's list the positions in order:\n\nIndex: 0: (4,1) head\n\n1: (3,1)\n\n2: (2,1)\n\n3: (2,2)\n\n4: (3,2)\n\n5: (4,2)\n\n6: (5,2)\n\n7: (5,3)\n\n8: (5,4)\n\n9: (4,4)  (5,4) is index 8, then 9: (4,4)\n\nPositions: 0:(4,1), 1:(3,1), 2:(2,1), 3:(2,2), 4:(3,2), 5:(4,2), 6:(5,2), 7:(5,3), 8:(5,4), 9:(4,4), 10:(4,3), 11:(3,3), 12:(2,3), 13:(1,3), 14:(1,4), 15:(1,5), 16:(2,5) tail.\n\nYes.\n\nFrom (4,1), adjacent:\n\n(4,0): wall\n\n(5,1): wall\n\n(4,2): occupied by index 5, body\n\n(3,1): occupied by index 1, body\n\nNo other cells.\n\nSo indeed, no safe move. The snake must collide this turn.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we have to choose a move, and it will die, but that seems odd.\n\nMaybe the head direction indicates the previous move, but for current turn, we can change direction.\n\nBut still, no safe cell to move to.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the food at (5,4) is under the body, but for the head to eat it, the body must move away first, but at this position, head is not near it.\n\nI think I have to accept that from this state, there is no safe move, so the snake will die on any action.\n\nBut that can't be, or perhaps it is.\n\nLet's look at the food: (4,6), (5,4), (6,6)\n\n(5,4) is occupied by snake index 8, and food is there with life span 6, value 1.\n\nBut to eat it, the snake needs to move so that the body at (5,4) moves away, and then head moves to (5,4).\n\nBut currently, head is at (4,1), far away.\n\nFrom current position, no move is possible, so snake dies immediately.\n\nBut that seems strange for the state to be given if it's terminal.\n\nPerhaps I misread the head direction or something.\n\nHead direction is R, which is consistent with position: from (3,1) to (4,1), moving right.\n\nBut at (4,1), stuck.\n\nUnless the grid has more cells, but no.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacles are not walls for movement, but the description says \"Cells occupied by walls\" and \"the snake cannot move to these coordinates.\"\n\nSo they are barriers.\n\nSo I think the snake is trapped.\n\nBut for the sake of the problem, I need to choose a move, and it will die, but the instruction is to maximize score by eating food, but here no food can be eaten.\n\nPerhaps I should choose a move to die less painfully, but all moves lead to death.\n\nMaybe I can move to (4,2) and die, or to (3,1) and die, etc.\n\nBut since all are fatal, it doesn't matter.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but if it dies on this turn, no future turns.\n\nThe state says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but here it's impossible.\n\nPerhaps I have a mistake in the food position.\n\nFood at (4,6,4,1) means (x,y, life_span, value) so (4,6) with life 4, value 1.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4,6,1) so (5,4) with life 6, value 1.\n\nBut (5,4) is occupied by snake.\n\n(6,6,9,1) so (6,6) with life 9, value 1.\n\nNone near head.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps when the snake moves, the body segments shift, so for example, if I could move up to (4,2), but (4,2) is currently occupied, but after move, if I move head to (4,2), the body at (4,2) would be pushed to the next position, but in snake, when head moves to a new cell, the neck becomes the new head position, and all segments shift, so if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it means the head is colliding with that segment before it moves, so it's collision.\n\nFor example, if head is at A, body at B, C, etc.\n\nIf head moves to B, but B is occupied by the first body segment, so when head moves to B, it is on the same cell as the first body segment, so collision occurs.\n\nOnly if moving to the tail cell, because the tail will move, so head and tail were on different cells, head moves to tail cell, tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, for (4,2), it is the cell of the 5th segment, not the tail, so moving to it would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nSo I think the snake is dead.\n\nBut for the problem, I should choose a move, say U, and it dies.\n\nThen for future turns, no actions.\n\nBut the answer format requires actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nPerhaps I need to assume it can move or something.\n\nMaybe the head direction is for the previous move, and we can choose any direction except opposite, but in this case, no valid cell.\n\nLet's list all possible cells the head can move to.\n\nFrom (4,1):\n\n- U: (4,2) - occupied by snake (index 5)\n\n- D: (4,0) - wall\n\n- L: (3,1) - occupied by snake (index 1)\n\n- R: (5,1) - wall\n\nAll invalid.\n\nSo the only thing I can do is choose one, and it dies.\n\nPerhaps for the sake of the problem, I choose U to (4,2), and it dies, so for turn 95, action U, and no future actions.\n\nBut that seems bleak.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the food at (5,4) is on the body, and if the body moves away, it can be eaten, but for that, the head needs to be able to move first.\n\nBut currently, head can't move.\n\nI think I have to proceed with the move.\n\nPerhaps I misread the snake positions. Let's double-check the list.\n\n\"Snake Positions\":[(4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)]\n\nSo (4,1) head, then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) tail.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the cell (4,3) is occupied, but let's see if there is a free cell nearby.\n\nFor example, (4,1) to (4,2) is occupied, but what about (3,2)? (3,2) is occupied by index 4.\n\nOr (5,2) is index 6.\n\nAll occupied or walls.\n\nPerhaps the tail is at (2,5), but not adjacent.\n\nSo I think it's hopeless.\n\nMaybe the head can move to a cell that will be freed when the tail moves, but at the time of move, the cell must be free or the tail cell for it to be safe to move to.\n\nFor example, if the tail is adjacent, head can move to tail position.\n\nBut here, tail is at (2,5), head at (4,1), not adjacent.\n\nDistance is 2 in x and 4 in y, not adjacent.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, for turn 95, any action I choose will result in death.\n\nSo I should choose an action, say U, and the game ends.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, so perhaps I'll just provide turn 95 action.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but here it's not possible.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the state or my understanding.\n\nAnother thought: the internal obstacles might not be walls, but the description says \"Cells occupied by walls\" and lists them, so they are walls.\n\nPerhaps \"internal obstacles\" are separate, but they are part of the walls.\n\nI think I have to accept the situation.\n\nSo for turn 95, I will choose to move U to (4,2), which causes collision and death.\n\nThen for future turns, no actions.\n\nBut for the answer format, I need to box the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can write only turn 95.\n\nBut let's see the food life span.\n\nFood at (4,6) life span 4, so it disappears after 4 turns, including current, so at turn 99 it disappears if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) life span 6, disappears at turn 101.\n\n(6,6) life span 9, disappears at turn 104.\n\nBut since snake dies now, no matter.\n\nI think I should proceed.\n\nPerhaps the head direction is not constraining for this turn; the no instant reverse is for the next turn, but for this turn, since previous direction is R, I cannot move L for this turn.\n\nBut still, no valid move.\n\nLet's assume that (5,1) is not a wall for some reason, but it is listed.\n\nList of internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n\nSo (5,1) is obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is obstacle, but not relevant.\n\n(4,0) is border wall.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the snake can move to a wall and die, or to body and die.\n\nI choose to move U for turn 95.\n\nThen for turn 96, if it were alive, but it's not, so no action.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide only turn 95 action.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action on turn t1\" and so on, so I can have only one line.\n\nBut it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but here it's not possible, so I'll do what I can.\n\nPerhaps there is a way; let's think differently.\n\nThe food at (5,4) is on the body at index 8, position (5,4).\n\nWhen the snake moves, if the body moves away from (5,4), the food is revealed, and if head moves there, it can be eaten.\n\nBut currently, head is at (4,1), far away.\n\nFrom (4,1), no move, so can't even start.\n\nSo I think it's impossible.\n\nPerhaps for this turn, I can move to (4,2) and die, but let's see if (4,2) is the tail or something. No, tail is (2,5).\n\nAnother idea: when the snake moves, the tail moves, so the cell (2,5) is freed, but it's not adjacent to head.\n\nHead at (4,1), tail at (2,5), when head moves, tail moves to the next position, which is (1,5) or something, but the cell (2,5) is freed only after the move, but for the head to move to a cell, it must be free at the beginning of the turn.\n\nAt the start of turn, all cells are occupied, so head cannot move to any adjacent cell without collision.\n\nSo I think it's game over.\n\nI will choose to move U for turn 95.\n\nThen for the answer, only one action.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut the format has multiple turns, so perhaps I need to think ahead as much as possible, but since it dies, no.\n\nPerhaps I misread the position.\n\nLet's read the snake positions again: \"Snake Positions\":[(4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)]\n\nNotice that (4,3) is in the list, index 10: (4,3)\n\nBut from (4,1), (4,3) is not adjacent; it's two steps away.\n\nNot relevant.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to (4,2) if that segment is moving away, but in standard rules, it's not allowed.\n\nI think I have to accept it.\n\nSo for turn 95, action U.\n\nThen the snake dies.\n\nFor the answer, I'll box only that.\n\nBut let's see if there is a safe move that I missed.\n\nWhat about moving to (3,1)? But (3,1) is occupied, and moving left is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed anyway.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nSo only U, D, R possible, but D and R to walls, U to body.\n\nSo U is the only choice, even though it kills.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe current state shows the snake is trapped with no safe moves available from position (4,1). All adjacent cells are either occupied by the snake's body or are walls:\n- Up (U) to (4,2): Occupied by the snake's body segment (index 5).\n- Down (D) to (4,0): Border wall (y=0).\n- Right (R) to (5,1): Internal obstacle wall.\n- Left (L): Not allowed due to \"no instant reverse\" rule (current direction is right).\n\nSince no safe move exists, moving up (U) to (4,2) results in a body collision and immediate death. No further actions are possible.\n\nGiven the requirement to think 5+ turns ahead, the only viable action is for turn 95, as the game ends on this turn. The food positions and their life spans are irrelevant due to the imminent collision.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 95: U (up)\n}",
