        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0. Cars move left or right at constant speeds, and I collide if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y where a car's span includes x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that collision happens only if I'm on the freeway at the exact turn when a car is at x=0. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I don't collide on the turn I arrive, only on subsequent turns if I stay or move away.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=0 and need to reach y=9, and y can only change by -1, 0, or +1 per turn, the minimum number of turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9 turns if I only move up, but I might need to wait or avoid cars, so it could take more.\n\nBut in this case, I need to minimize H, so probably I should go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn t1 = 0.\n\nThe car data is given for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nFor each freeway, there are one or more cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so head and tail: for right-moving cars, the head is the front, so if moving right, head should be greater than tail? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, τ] becomes [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says span(t1) = [τ, h] with τ and h, but in the table, for example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nSo for right-moving, span is given as (head, tail), but in the update, it's [τ, h] for right-moving? There might be inconsistency.\n\nLook: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the car state table, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nNow, if direction is right, and span is [τ, h], but here head is -48, tail is -59? -48 is greater than -59, so if moving right, the head should be the right end, so for right-moving, head > tail, I think.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: [τ, h] with τ + sΔT, h + sΔT, so if moving right, τ is the left end, h is the right end? I'm confused.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\nFor car on freeway i, at turn t1, head at h, tail at τ.\n\nThen for left-moving: span [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn left-moving, span is [h, τ], so h is the head, which for left-moving should be the left end? If moving left, the head is the front, so if moving left, head should be less than tail? Let's think.\n\nTypically, for a car moving left, the head is the leftmost point, tail is rightmost? No.\n\nIf a car is moving left, its front is going left, so the head is the left end, and tail is the right end. So span [head, tail] with head < tail for left-moving? But in the update, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if moving left, h decreases, τ decreases, so h should be left, τ right, so h < τ.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, if moving right, head is right end, tail is left end? In the update, for right-moving, span [τ, h] with τ + sΔT, h + sΔT, so if moving right, τ is left end, h is right end, so τ < h.\n\nBut in the car state, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail), so head should be the right end for right-moving, tail left end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head left end, tail right end.\n\nNow in the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nSince right-moving, head should be right end, so head = -48, tail = -59, so -48 > -59, so right end is -48, left end is -59? Positions: x-axis, I assume negative is left, positive right.\n\nSo x=0 is the point we care about.\n\nFor freeway 1, car: head = -48, tail = -59, direction right, speed 4.\n\nSince right-moving, at time t, the span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But in the notation, it says for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], but in the car state, it's listed as (head, tail), so for this car, head = -48, tail = -59, so τ = tail = -59, h = head = -48.\n\nSo span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span is [ -59 + 4(T-t1), -48 + 4(T-t1) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow collision occurs if at turn T, for the freeway y_T that I'm on, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThat is, for some car on that freeway, min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span) at turn T.\n\nSince span is an interval.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not on it until the next turn, so for example, if at turn T I am at y_T, and I move to y_{T+1} = y_T + 1, then at turn T, I am on y_T, so I could collide with cars on y_T at turn T. At turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, so I could collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1, but not at turn T because I wasn't on y_{T+1} yet.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nSo, only on the freeway I'm currently on at that turn.\n\nNow, I start at turn t1=0, position (0,0). But y=0 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0 or y=9, no cars, I think. y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nI start at (0,0), which is safe, and need to reach (0,9), safe.\n\nAt each turn, when I am at some y between 1 and 8, I need to ensure that no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince I can stay, move up, or move down, I can choose to wait if necessary.\n\nBut I want to minimize turns, so I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the cars.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway, when cars are at x=0.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, find the times when 0 is in its span.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, for each car, we can find the time interval when it covers x=0.\n\nThen, for each freeway, the times when it is blocked, i.e., some car at x=0.\n\nThen, for my path, when I am on freeway y at turn t, it must not be blocked at that turn.\n\nNow, time is in turns, discrete.\n\nSet t1=0.\n\nFor each freeway, list the cars and their span over time.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nSince right-moving, span at time t: [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] = [-59 + 4t, -48 + 4t]\n\nt1=0.\n\nSo span(t) = [-59 + 4t, -48 + 4t]\n\n0 in span when min ≤ 0 ≤ max, so -59 + 4t ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 4t\n\nSo from -59 + 4t ≤ 0 => 4t ≤ 59 => t ≤ 59/4 = 14.75, so t <= 14 since integer? Turns are integers, I assume.\n\nt is turn number, integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 4t => 48 <= 4t => t >= 12\n\nAnd -59 + 4t <= 0 <= -48 + 4t\n\nLeft inequality: -59 + 4t <= 0 => 4t <= 59 => t <= 14.75, so since t integer, t <= 14\n\nRight inequality: 0 <= -48 + 4t => 48 <= 4t => t >= 12\n\nSo for t from 12 to 14 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nt=12,13,14.\n\nCheck: t=12: span = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0] , 0 included.\n\nt=13: [-59+52, -48+52] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nt=14: [-59+56, -48+56] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nt=15: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nt=11: [-59+44, -48+44] = [-15,-4], 0 not in\n\nSo freeway 1 blocked at t=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4) so same, blocked t=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars: (48, 37, right, 4) and (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (head=48, tail=37, right, speed=4)\n\nSince right-moving, head is right end, tail left end? head=48, tail=37, but 48>37, so tail=37, head=48, so τ=tail=37, h=head=48\n\nSpan at t: [37 + 4t, 48 + 4t]\n\n0 in span when 37+4t <= 0 <= 48+4t? But 37+4t <=0? 4t <= -37? t negative? Since t>=0, 37+4t >=37>0, so min=37+4t >0 for t>=0, so 0 never in span, since left end is at least 37.\n\nSimilarly, max=48+4t >0.\n\nSo this car never at x=0.\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nhead=0, tail=-11, right, speed=4\n\nτ=tail=-11, h=head=0\n\nSpan at t: [-11 + 4t, 0 + 4t] = [-11+4t, 4t]\n\n0 in span when min <=0<=max, so -11+4t <=0 <=4t\n\nLeft: -11+4t <=0 => 4t<=11 => t<=2.75, t<=2\n\nRight: 0<=4t => t>=0\n\nBut at t=0, min=-11, max=0, 0 included.\n\nt=1: [-11+4, 4] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nt=2: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nt=3: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nt=0: [-11,0], 0 included\n\nSo for second car, blocked at t=0,1,2.\n\nNow, freeway 3 has two cars, but first one never at 0, so only second car matters, blocked at t=0,1,2.\n\nt=0,1,2.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nSimilarly, first car never at 0, second car at t=0,1,2.\n\nSo blocked t=0,1,2.\n\nFreeway 5: same, (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), blocked t=0,1,2.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nhead=48, tail=83? For left-moving, head should be left end, tail right end? But head=48, tail=83, 48<83, so head=48 (left), tail=83 (right)\n\nSpan at t: [48 - 36t, 83 - 36t]\n\n0 in span when min <=0<=max, so 48-36t <=0 <=83-36t\n\nLeft: 48-36t <=0 => 48<=36t => t>=48/36=4/3≈1.333, so t>=2 since t integer? t>=2\n\nt>= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3)=2? 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so t>=2\n\nRight: 0<=83-36t => 36t<=83 => t<=83/36≈2.305, so t<=2\n\nt<= floor(83/36)= floor(2.305)=2\n\nAnd left: t>= ceil(48/36)= ceil(1.333)=2\n\nSo only at t=2: min=48-72= -24? t=2, span: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], 0 in.\n\nt=1: [48-36,83-36] = [12,47], min=12>0, 0 not in\n\nt=3: [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25], max<0, 0 not in\n\nSo only blocked at t=2.\n\nFreeway 6 blocked only at t=2.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) as before, never at 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) head=12, tail=1, right, speed=4\n\nτ=tail=1, h=head=12\n\nSpan at t: [1 + 4t, 12 + 4t]\n\n0 in span: 1+4t <=0 <=12+4t? But 1+4t >=1>0 for t>=0, so min>0, never <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) head=-24, tail=-35? head=-24, tail=-35, since right, head right end, tail left end, so τ=tail=-35, h=head=-24\n\nSpan at t: [-35 + 4t, -24 + 4t]\n\n0 in span: -35+4t <=0 <= -24+4t\n\nLeft: -35+4t <=0 => 4t<=35 => t<=8.75, t<=8\n\nRight: 0<= -24+4t => 24<=4t => t>=6\n\nSo t from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nt=6: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nt=7: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nt=8: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nt=9: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 7, first car never, second car never, third car blocked at t=6,7,8.\n\nBut are there multiple cars? Only third car causes blockage at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4) same as freeway 1 and 2, so blocked t=12,13,14.\n\nSummarize for each freeway, the turns when it is blocked (i.e., unsafe to be on):\n\ny=1: blocked t=12,13,14\n\ny=2: same, t=12,13,14\n\ny=3: blocked t=0,1,2\n\ny=4: blocked t=0,1,2\n\ny=5: blocked t=0,1,2\n\ny=6: blocked only t=2\n\ny=7: blocked t=6,7,8\n\ny=8: blocked t=12,13,14\n\nNow, I start at t=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some turn H.\n\nSince I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 turns, but with obstacles.\n\nThe path is a sequence of actions: U, D, S, with y changing accordingly.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at turn t=H-1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn t= t1 + t for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nSet t1=0.\n\nAt turn 0, I am at y=0.\n\nI perform action a_0, which affects y at turn 1.\n\nThe position: at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, then I choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nI start at turn 0, y_0 = 0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, I am at y_H.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y_H = 9.\n\nSince I start at y_0=0, and after H actions, y_H = something.\n\nThe number of turns: from turn 0 to turn H, there are H+1 positions, but the actions are from turn 0 to turn H-1, I think.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI choose action a_t.\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAnd so on, until I reach y_t = 9 for some t.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to t=H-1, and after H actions, at turn H, y_H = 9.\n\nBut at turn H, I am at y_H=9, which is safe.\n\nThe minimal H such that I can achieve y_H=9.\n\nSince I start at y_0=0, and each action changes y by -1,0,1, the minimum H to reach y=9 is 9, if I always go up.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway y when it is blocked at that turn.\n\nNow, let's find a path.\n\nFirst, note that at t=0, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI need to go up to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are blocked at certain times.\n\nSince y=3,4,5 are blocked at t=0,1,2, I cannot be on y=3,4,5 during t=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 blocked only at t=2, so at t=2, I should not be on y=6.\n\ny=7 blocked at t=6,7,8.\n\ny=1,2,8 blocked at t=12,13,14, but since I want to go fast, I probably won't reach there late, so maybe not an issue if I go quickly.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can reach in 9 turns.\n\nSuppose I always go up: actions U,U,U,... so y_t = t for t from 0 to 9.\n\nAt turn t, y_t = t.\n\nNow, collision if at some t, y_t is between 1 and 8, and freeway y_t is blocked at turn t.\n\nCheck for each t:\n\nt=0: y_0=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nt=1: y_1=1, freeway 1, blocked at t=12,13,14, not at t=1, so safe? Blocked times: y=1 blocked only at t=12,13,14, so at t=1, not blocked, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=2: y_2=2, freeway 2, blocked t=12,13,14, not t=2, safe.\n\nt=3: y_3=3, freeway 3, blocked at t=0,1,2, not at t=3? Blocked t=0,1,2, so at t=3, not blocked, so should be safe.\n\nBut at t=3, y=3, freeway 3 blocked only at t=0,1,2, so at t=3, no car at 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=4: y=4, freeway 4 blocked t=0,1,2, not t=4, safe.\n\nt=5: y=5, freeway 5 blocked t=0,1,2, not t=5, safe.\n\nt=6: y=6, freeway 6 blocked at t=2, not t=6, so safe? Blocked only t=2, yes.\n\nt=7: y=7, freeway 7 blocked at t=6,7,8. At t=7, blocked! Oh, collision.\n\ny_7=7, and at turn t=7, freeway 7 is blocked, so collision.\n\nSo cannot be at y=7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, t=8: y=8, freeway 8 blocked at t=12,13,14, not t=8, so safe.\n\nt=9: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=7, collision.\n\nSo need to avoid being on y=7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nIn this path, at t=7, y=7, blocked.\n\nAlso, at t=6, if I were on y=7, but in this path at t=6, y=6.\n\nBut at t=7, problem.\n\nTo avoid, I could stay or move down or up at some point to delay.\n\nBut since I want minimal H, probably not much delay.\n\ny=7 blocked only at t=6,7,8, so I need not to be on y=7 during those turns.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=7 before t=6 or after t=8.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the direct up path, I reach y=7 at t=7, which is blocked.\n\nI could reach y=7 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, if I go up faster? But I start at t=0, y=0, the earliest I can be at y=7 is t=7, by going up every turn.\n\ny_t = t, so y=7 at t=7.\n\nI cannot be earlier.\n\nLater: I can be later, but that might increase H.\n\nSince y=6 is only blocked at t=2, which is early, and in the path, at t=2, I am at y=2, not y=6.\n\ny=6 blocked at t=2, but at t=2, if I were on y=6, but in min time, I am at y=2 at t=2.\n\nNow, for y=7, blocked t=6,7,8.\n\nI need to not be on y=7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nSince I can be at y=7 at t=5 or t=9 or later.\n\nt=5: if I go up faster, but from y=0 to y=7 in 7 turns, y_7=7, but that's t=7.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn t, I need to have taken actions to increase y to 7 in t turns.\n\nThe earliest is t=7, y_7=7.\n\nI can be at y=7 later, say t=8 or t=9, but then to reach y=9, it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point.\n\nBut let's see if I can skip y=7 during the bad times.\n\nAnother idea: go up but at t=6, instead of going to y=7, I stay at y=6 or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nList the times when each freeway is safe or not.\n\nI need to plan the path.\n\nSince y=3,4,5 are only blocked at t=0,1,2, which are early, and I start at y=0, by t=3 I can be at y=3, which is safe after t=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 blocked only at t=2, so avoid y=6 at t=2.\n\ny=7 blocked t=6,7,8.\n\ny=8 is safe except late, but I can be there early.\n\ny=1 and 2 safe except late.\n\nSo for y=7, the critical one.\n\nI need to be on y=7 at some turn when it is not blocked, i.e., not t=6,7,8.\n\nSo possible at t<=5 or t>=9.\n\nBut t<=5: at t=5, y=5 max if I go up, y_5=5, cannot be y=7 at t=5.\n\nEarliest y=7 is t=7.\n\nSo only possibility is t>=9 to be on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be on y=8 at some point, which is blocked only at t=12,13,14, so if I go early, safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo to be on y=7 at t>=9.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be on other freeways at safe times.\n\nNow, let's find a path with H=10, for example.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by turn H.\n\nSet H=10, so actions from t=0 to t=9, position at t=10 should be y=9? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn 0: position y_0=0\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{k}, y_{k+1} = ...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, y_H.\n\nI need y_H =9.\n\nNumber of actions: H.\n\nFrom y_0=0 to y_H=9, the net displacement is +9, each action contributes +1,0,-1 to displacement.\n\nThe minimal number of actions is 9, all U.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be more.\n\nIn this case, since I need to be at y=7 at t>=9, let's see.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=6, then wait or something.\n\nBut y=6 is safe except at t=2.\n\nNow, at what turn can I be at y=6.\n\nI start at y=0, can reach y=6 at t=6 by going up: y_t=t.\n\nAt t=6, y=6, freeway 6, which is safe at t=6, since blocked only at t=2.\n\nThen at t=6, I am at y=6.\n\nNow, I want to go to y=7, but at t=6, if I go up, y_7=7, but at t=7, y=7, which is blocked if at t=7.\n\nBut freeway 7 blocked at t=6,7,8.\n\nAt turn t, when I am on y_t.\n\nIf at t=6, I am at y=6, safe.\n\nIf I choose a_6 = U, then y_7 =7.\n\nAt turn t=7, I am at y=7, and freeway 7 blocked at t=7, so collision.\n\nIf I choose a_6 = S, then y_7=6, still on y=6 at t=7.\n\ny=6 safe at t=7? Freeway 6 blocked only at t=2, so at t=7, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I can choose.\n\nBut I need to go to y=7 eventually.\n\nBut freeway 7 blocked until t=8, so at t=8, if I go to y=7, at t=8 I am on y=7, blocked.\n\nProblem.\n\nFreeway 7 blocked at t=6,7,8, so at turn t=6,7,8, if I am on y=7, collision.\n\nI need to be on y=7 at t<=5 or t>=9.\n\nBut t<=5 impossible, so must be at t>=9.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be on y=8 at some point, which can be at t<=11 or t>=15, but since I want fast, t<=11.\n\ny=8 blocked at t=12,13,14, so safe at t<=11 or t>=15.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should be at y=7 at t=9, for example.\n\nThen at t=9, y=7.\n\nThen I can go to y=8 at t=10, then y=9 at t=11.\n\nH=11 actions? Let's see the turns.\n\nSet t=0: y=0\n\nt=1: y=1, safe\n\nt=2: y=2, safe\n\nt=3: y=3, safe (since not blocked)\n\nt=4: y=4, safe\n\nt=5: y=5, safe\n\nt=6: y=6, safe\n\nNow at t=6, y=6.\n\nIf I go up at t=6, y_7=7 at t=7, but t=7 blocked for y=7.\n\nSo I should not go up yet.\n\nI need to stay or move down to delay.\n\nBut moving down might not help.\n\nAt t=6, I can stay: a_6 = S, so y_7 =6 (still y=6)\n\nAt t=7, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, if I go up, y_8=7 at t=8, but t=8 blocked for y=7.\n\nStill problem.\n\nIf I stay again at t=7, a_7=S, y_8=6\n\nThen at t=8, y=6, safe.\n\nNow at t=8, I can go up, but if a_8=U, y_9=7 at t=9.\n\nt=9, y=7, is it safe? Freeway 7 blocked at t=6,7,8, not at t=9, so should be safe.\n\nYes! t=9 >=9, not blocked.\n\nThen at t=9, y=7, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=8 at t=10: a_9=U, y_10=8\n\nAt t=10, y=8, freeway 8 blocked at t=12,13,14, not t=10, safe.\n\nThen to y=9: a_10=U, y_11=9 at t=11.\n\nNow, I started at t=0, y=0, after 11 actions, at t=11, y=11? y_11=9? Let's list:\n\nt=0: y=0\n\na_0=U, y1=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\na4=U, y5=5\n\na5=U, y6=6\n\nNow at t=6, y=6\n\na6: I need to stay or something.\n\nIn the above, at t=6, y=6, I set a6=S, so y7=6\n\nt=7, y=6\n\na7=S, y8=6? No\n\nAt t=7, y=6, a7=S, then y8 = y7 +0 =6? y8=6\n\nt=8, y=6\n\nThen a8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9, y=7\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\nt=10, y=8\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nt=11, y=9\n\nSo reached at turn 11, with 11 actions from t=0 to t=10.\n\nActions: a0 to a10, 11 actions.\n\nBut at t=9, y=7, which is safe, as blocked only up to t=8.\n\nt=10, y=8 safe.\n\nNow, what about the stay actions? I stayed at y=6 for two extra turns: from t=6 to t=7 and t=8, but at t=6, I was at y=6, then stayed, so at t=7 and t=8 still y=6.\n\nBut y=6 is safe at those times.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=6, y=6; t=7, y=6; t=8, y=6; then t=9, y=7.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path?\n\nH=11 actions to reach at t=11.\n\nBut minimal possible is 9, but we saw it collides at t=7.\n\nCan I reach in 10 actions?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\ny_10=9.\n\nThen I must have y_t for t=0 to 10.\n\ny_0=0, y_10=9, so net +9 in 10 steps, so I must have one stay or one down, but since I need to go up, probably one stay or delay.\n\nThe position sequence.\n\nI need to be at y=7 at some t not 6,7,8.\n\nPossible t=5, but cannot, or t=9.\n\nt=9: at t=9, y=9? But I need to be at y=7 before.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=9.\n\nThen from start, I need to reach y=7 at t=9.\n\nEarliest to reach y=7 is t=7, but that is blocked.\n\nNext, t=8: to be at y=7 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, if y=7, blocked, since freeway 7 blocked at t=8.\n\nt=8 is blocked.\n\nt=9: can be at y=7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=9.\n\nThen y_9=7.\n\nThen to go to y=8 at t=10: y_10=8, then to y=9 at t=11, but that would be later.\n\nIf I want y_10=9, then from y_9=7, I need y_10=9, which requires two up in one step? No, each action changes by at most 1.\n\nSo from y_9 to y_10, Δy <=1, so if y_9=7, y_10<=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_9=8, y_10=9.\n\nOr if y_9=9, y_10=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=10, y_10=9.\n\nThen y_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_9=9, then at t=9, y=9, safe, and y_10=9 with a9=S or something.\n\nBut let's see the path to y_10=9.\n\ny_10=9, so at some point I must be at y=7.\n\nSuppose I am at y=7 at turn t.\n\nt must not be 6,7,8, so t=5,9,10,... but t=5 impossible, t=10: if y_10=9, not 7.\n\ny_7 at t=7 is required if I go directly, but I can be later.\n\nThe times I am on y=7.\n\nFor example, to have y_10=9, I must have passed y=7 at some turn.\n\nSuppose I reach y=7 at t=9.\n\nThen y_9=7.\n\nThen to have y_10=9, impossible, since from y=7 to y=9 in one step not possible.\n\ny_10=9, so the position at t=9 must be y_9 such that y_10 = y_9 + Δy_9, so if Δy_9=U, y_10 = y_9 +1, so y_9=8.\n\nSimilarly, if S, y_10=y_9, so y_9=9.\n\nOr D, y_10=y_9-1=8 if y_9=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9, y_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_9=8, then a9=U, y10=9.\n\nIf y_9=9, a9=S or D, but D would go down, not good.\n\nSo best is y_9=8, a9=U, y10=9.\n\nNow, y_9=8.\n\nSimilarly, y_8 must be 7,8,9 to reach y_9=8.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, I need y_9=8.\n\ny_9=8, at turn t=9, freeway 8 is safe? Blocked only at t=12,13,14, so at t=9, safe.\n\nNow, to have y_9=8, I need to be at y=8 at t=9.\n\nBut I also need to be at y=7 at some point.\n\ny_9=8, so at t=9, y=8.\n\nThe turn I am at y=7 could be before.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=7 at t=7, but blocked.\n\nOr at t=8: if y_8=7, then at t=8, y=7, but blocked.\n\nNot possible.\n\nt=9: y_9=8, not 7.\n\nSo when am I at y=7?\n\nFor example, if y_8=7, then at t=8, y=7, blocked.\n\nIf y_8=6, and a8=U, y9=7, but at t=9, y=7, which is safe only if t=9 not blocked, which it is not, but y_9=7, but we need y_9=8.\n\nContradiction.\n\ny_9 must be 8 to reach y10=9 with up.\n\nSo y_9=8.\n\nThen at t=9, y=8.\n\nNow, I was at y=7 at some earlier turn.\n\nFor example, suppose y_8=7, then at t=8, y=7, but freeway 7 blocked at t=8, collision.\n\nIf y_8=8, then a8=S, y9=8, but then to reach y=9, need a9=U, y10=9.\n\nBut at t=8, y=8, freeway 8 safe at t=8? Blocked only t=12-14, yes safe.\n\nBut when was I at y=7?\n\nIf y_8=8, then y_7 must be 7,8,9.\n\nIf y_7=7, then at t=7, y=7, blocked.\n\nIf y_7=8, then a7=S or something.\n\ny_7=8, at t=7, y=8, safe.\n\nThen to have y_8=8, a7=S, y8=8.\n\nThen y_9=8 with a8=S, but we need y9=8 for y10=9.\n\ny9=8.\n\nBut how did I reach y=7?\n\nI must have been at y=7 before t=7 or after.\n\nAfter, but now at t=7, y=8>7.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y_6 could be 6 or 7.\n\nIf y_6=7, at t=6, y=7, blocked.\n\nIf y_6=6, then a6=U, y7=7, but at t=7, blocked.\n\nNo way to be on y=7 without being at t=6,7, or 8, all blocked for the purpose of reaching y=9 at t=10.\n\nSpecifically, to reach y_10=9, I need to pass through y=7.\n\nThe possible turns to be at y=7 are t=7,8,9,... but t=7 and 8 are blocked, t=9 is possible, but at t=9, if y_9=7, then to y10=8 or 9, not directly to 9 if I want y10=9.\n\nIf at t=9, y_9=7, then y10=8 with U, then I need another action to y11=9.\n\nBut that would be H=11.\n\nIf I can be at y=7 at t=9, then y10=8, y11=9.\n\nBut with H=10, y10=9, I cannot be at y=7 at t=9 because y9 must be 8.\n\nAnd I cannot be at y=7 at t=7 or 8 because blocked.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at turn 10 without being on y=7 at a blocked turn.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nWith H=11, as I had: reach at turn 11.\n\nNow, in the sequence I thought: stay at y=6 for two turns.\n\nBut let's confirm all steps.\n\nPath:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\na0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, freeway1, safe since not blocked at t=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, freeway2, safe (blocked only t=12-14)\n\nBut at t=2, freeway 6 is blocked, but I am not on y=6, I am on y=2, so no issue.\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, freeway3, blocked only t=0,1,2, so at t=3, safe.\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\nt=4: y=4, freeway4, safe\n\na4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5: y=5, freeway5, safe\n\na5=U, y6=6\n\nt=6: y=6, freeway6, safe (blocked only t=2)\n\nNow, instead of going up, I stay: a6=S, so y7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway6, safe\n\na7=S, y8=6? a7=S, so y8=y7 +0=6\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway6, safe\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway7, blocked at t=6,7,8, not t=9, so safe.\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway8, blocked only t=12-14, not t=10, safe.\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nt=11: y=9, safe.\n\nSo reached in 11 turns.\n\nBut H is the number of actions? In the problem, H is the minimal number of turns, and sequence of actions from t=t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to Turn t1 + H -1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd after H actions, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t1=0, actions from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions.\n\nAt turn t=11, position (0,9).\n\nNow, is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose I go up faster to some point, but I start at y=0, cannot be faster.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 at t=9 directly, but to be at y=7 at t=9, I need to have taken actions to increase y by 7 in 9 turns, so I must have stayed twice or gone down, which would make me slower to reach higher y.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point, I might reach y=7 later.\n\nBut with H=10, y10=9, I must have y increasing most of the time.\n\nThe only way to avoid y=7 at bad times is to be there at t=9, but then I cannot reach y=9 at t=10.\n\nTherefore, impossible with H=10.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nBut in my sequence, I stayed at y=6 for two turns, but I could have stayed less or elsewhere.\n\nFor example, at t=5, I am at y=5.\n\nIf I stay at y=5 for one turn: a5=S, then y6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway5, safe (blocked only t=0,1,2)\n\nThen a6=U, y7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, safe\n\nThen a7=U, y8=7 but at t=8, y=7, blocked! t=8 blocked.\n\nIf I stay at t=6: after y7=6 at t=7, a7=S, y8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, then a8=U, y9=7 at t=9, safe.\n\nThen same as before, need to go to y=10? y9=7, a9=U, y10=8, a10=U, y11=9.\n\nStill 11 actions.\n\nIf at t=5, I go up to y=6 at t=6, same as before.\n\nPerhaps I can go down briefly to avoid, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=5, instead of going up, go down? But then I have to come back, more turns.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo probably 11 is minimal.\n\nNow, another thing: in freeway 7, there are multiple cars, but I think I covered, only the third car blocks at t=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have actions.\n\nt1=0.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: U (to y1=1)\n\nTurn 1: U (y2=2)\n\nTurn 2: U (y3=3)\n\nTurn 3: U (y4=4)\n\nTurn 4: U (y5=5)\n\nTurn 5: U (y6=6)  // at t=6, y=6\n\nNow, to avoid going to y=7 at t=7, I need to stay at y=6.\n\nIn my earlier, I stayed twice: at turn 6 and turn 7.\n\nTurn 6: action at turn 6: if a6=S, then at turn 7, position y7=6\n\nSimilarly, a7=S, y8=6\n\nThen a8=U, y9=7\n\nBut I can stay only once if possible.\n\nSuppose at t=6, y=6, I stay: a6=S, so y7=6\n\nThen at t=7, y=6, I can go up? If a7=U, y8=7 at t=8, but t=8 blocked.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf at t=6, I go down? a6=D, y7=5\n\nt=7: y=5, freeway5, safe\n\nThen a7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, safe\n\na8=U, y9=7 at t=9, safe.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=8\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nSame number of actions, but I went down and up, which is worse than staying.\n\nStaying is better.\n\nIn the stay case, I stayed at y=6 for two turns: turns 6 and 7 actions are S.\n\nThen at turn 8, U to y9=7.\n\nIn terms of actions: from turn 0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nSequence: a0=U, a1=U, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=S, a7=S, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U\n\nAfter a10, y11=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as turns.\n\nt1=0.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nBut is there a way to do with one stay?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=7 at t=9, but reach y=9 at t=10, not possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 earlier.\n\nBut to be at y=8, earliest t=8, y8=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=8, freeway8 safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9, but I have to go through y=7 or directly.\n\nFrom y=8 to y=9, but I was at y=7 before.\n\nAt t=8, y=8, then a8=U, y9=9, so at t=9, y=9.\n\nBut how did I get to y=8 at t=8?\n\ny8=8, so I must have been at y=7 at t=7 or earlier.\n\nIf at t=7, y=7, but blocked.\n\nIf at t=6, y=7, but at t=6, y=7, freeway7 blocked at t=6.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo cannot reach y=8 at t=8 without being on y=7 at a blocked turn.\n\nTherefore, must delay.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, I have two S, but I could have the stay earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=3, I stay: but that might not help.\n\nSuppose at t=2, after y2=2, I stay: a2=S, y3=2\n\nt=3: y=2, safe\n\nThen a3=U, y4=3\n\nBut y=3 is safe at t=3, etc.\n\nBut I still need to reach y=6, and then delay for y=7.\n\nAt t=6, if I go to y=6, same as before.\n\nIf I am slower, I might reach y=6 later, but then I can go to y=7 at t=9 directly.\n\nFor example, suppose I stay at y=2 for one turn.\n\nt=0: y=0, a0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, a2=S, y3=2\n\nt=3: y=2, a3=U, y4=3\n\nt=4: y=3, a4=U, y5=4\n\nt=5: y=4, a5=U, y6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, a6=U, y7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, a7=U, y8=7 but at t=8, y=7, blocked? t=8, y=7, freeway7 blocked at t=8.\n\nStill problem.\n\nThen I need to stay at y=6 or something.\n\nIn this case, at t=7, y=6, I can stay: a7=S, y8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, a8=U, y9=7 at t=9, safe.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=8\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nSame as before, 11 actions, but I stayed at y=2 and at y=6, two stays, whereas in first sequence I stayed twice at y=6, but same number.\n\nIn first sequence, I went directly to y=6 at t=6, then stayed twice.\n\nHere I stayed at y=2, then later at y=6 once, but still 11 actions.\n\nNo savings.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, back to the car states, I think I covered all.\n\nFreeway 6 blocked only at t=2, which I avoided.\n\nOthers.\n\nIn the sequence, when I am at y=6 at t=6,7,8, freeway 6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo the action sequence should be as above.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be for turns starting from t1=0.\n\nAlso, H=11.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 6 and 7 are S, which means I stay at y=6 for turns 6,7,8? Positions:\n\nAfter turn 5 action: at turn 6, y=6\n\nThen action turn 6: S, so at turn 7, y=6\n\nAction turn 7: S, at turn 8, y=6\n\nAction turn 8: U, at turn 9, y=7\n\nEtc.\n\nYes.\n\nTo have only one stay, but I don't think possible.\n\nSuppose at t=5, y=5, I go down: a5=D, y6=4\n\nt=6: y=4, safe\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7: y=5, safe\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, safe\n\na8=U, y9=7 at t=9, safe\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nStill 11 actions, but I did extra down and up.\n\nWorse in terms of path, but same H.\n\nBut with stay, it's simpler.\n\nIn the first sequence, with two stays at y=6, it's fine.\n\nNow, I think that's the minimal.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway when it is blocked at \\(x = 0\\) for that turn.\n\nThe blocking times for each freeway are:\n- Freeway 1: blocked at turns 12, 13, 14\n- Freeway 2: blocked at turns 12, 13, 14\n- Freeway 3: blocked at turns 0, 1, 2\n- Freeway 4: blocked at turns 0, 1, 2\n- Freeway 5: blocked at turns 0, 1, 2\n- Freeway 6: blocked at turn 2\n- Freeway 7: blocked at turns 6, 7, 8\n- Freeway 8: blocked at turns 12, 13, 14\n\nThe player starts at \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 0, which is safe. The actions are chosen to move up as quickly as possible but with two stay actions at \\(y = 6\\) (turns 6 and 7) to avoid being on freeway 7 during its blocked turns (6, 7, 8). Specifically:\n- From turn 0 to turn 5, the player moves up each turn to reach \\(y = 6\\) by turn 6.\n- At turns 6 and 7, the player stays at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 is safe except at turn 2).\n- At turn 8, the player moves up to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 is safe at turn 9).\n- At turn 9, the player moves up to \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 is safe at turn 10).\n- At turn 10, the player moves up to \\(y = 9\\), reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collision:\n- At turn 0: \\(y = 0\\), safe (no freeway).\n- Turn 1: \\(y = 1\\), freeway 1 not blocked.\n- Turn 2: \\(y = 2\\), freeway 2 not blocked.\n- Turn 3: \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3 not blocked (blocked only at turns 0-2).\n- Turn 4: \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4 not blocked.\n- Turn 5: \\(y = 5\\), freeway 5 not blocked.\n- Turn 6: \\(y = 6\\), freeway 6 not blocked (blocked only at turn 2).\n- Turn 7: \\(y = 6\\), freeway 6 not blocked.\n- Turn 8: \\(y = 6\\), freeway 6 not blocked (action: stay, so \\(y\\) remains 6).\n- Turn 9: \\(y = 7\\), freeway 7 not blocked (blocked only at turns 6-8).\n- Turn 10: \\(y = 8\\), freeway 8 not blocked.\n- Turn 11: \\(y = 9\\), safe (no freeway).\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: S \\\\\nTurn 7: S \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 1, and the player is at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). The player moves vertically (U: up, D: down, S: stay) and the cars move horizontally on their respective freeways.\n\nImportant note about collision: \n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and the car (on that freeway) has its span covering 0 at turn T.\n- When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} (different row) at turn T, the player is considered to be on row y_T at turn T (so only cars on row y_T matter) and then moves to row y_{T+1} for the next state. Therefore, at the moment of moving (turn T), the player is still on the starting row.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (turn 1) until the turn when the player reaches row 9.\n\nPlan:\n1. We'll simulate the movement of the cars over time. Since the cars move at constant speeds and we know their initial state at turn t1 (which is turn 1), we can compute their span at any future turn T (relative to turn 1: T = t1 + t, where t>=0).\n\n2. We need to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions. We can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) but note that the turn can be large? However, the grid is small (only 10 rows) and the goal is row 9. The minimal H in terms of moves without cars would be 8 moves (if we go up 8 times). But we have to avoid cars.\n\nHowever, note that the cars are moving and we have to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers the x=0 position at that exact turn.\n\n3. We note that the cars are on fixed freeways (rows 1 to 8). The player starts at row 1 and must go to row 9. Therefore, we must pass through rows 2,3,...,8 and then to 9. We can skip rows by moving multiple steps? But note: we can only move one row at a time? Actually, the movement is one step per turn: up, down, or stay. So we must go through each row in between.\n\nBut note: we can also stay in the same row for multiple turns? Or even move down? But we want minimal turns, so we would prefer to go up as much as possible, unless we have to wait to avoid a car.\n\n4. Since the goal is row 9 and we start at row 1, we must go up at least 8 times. The minimal H would be at least 8. But we might have to wait (use S or even D) to avoid collisions, so H might be more.\n\n5. We can model the state as (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t1=1, then 2,3,...) and y is the row (0 to 9). We want to go from (1,1) to (T,9) for some T>=9.\n\n6. However, the car positions depend on the turn. We need to check for each state (t,y) whether at turn t, on row y, there is a car that covers x=0.\n\n7. How to check for a car on row y at turn t?\n   - Look at the car state for freeway k=y (if y is between 1 and 8). For each car on that freeway, we compute its span at turn t (relative to turn 1: so the time elapsed is (t-1) because at turn 1 we have the initial state).\n\n   Note: the update for a car from turn 1 to turn t (so time passed = t - 1):\n   - For a right-moving car: \n        initial head h, tail tau (with h>=tau) -> at turn t: head = h + s*(t-1), tail = tau + s*(t-1)\n        and the span is [tau + s*(t-1), h + s*(t-1)] (since it's moving right, the head is the right end and tail is the left? Actually the table says for right: initial span [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)])\n\n   But note: the table gives for a car on freeway i:\n      For left-moving: initial span [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n      For right-moving: initial span [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n   However, in the input, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). We must interpret the span accordingly.\n\n   How to interpret the head and tail?\n   - For a right-moving car, the head is the front (right end) and tail is the rear (left end). So the initial span is [tail, head]? Actually the table says for right: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So the representation in the input is (head, tail) but the span is [tail, head]? \n\n   Let me see the example: \n        On freeway 3: (52,41,right,4) -> this car's initial span at turn1 is [41,52]? But wait, the table says for right: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\". So if the input gives (head, tail) then we have to use tau = the second number and h = the first? \n\n   The input says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\n   So for a right-moving car: the initial span is [tau, h] (so tau is the left end and h is the right end). \n\n   Similarly, for a left-moving car: the initial span is [h, tau]? But note: the table says for left: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\". So if the input gives (head, tail) then for left-moving, we have to use h as the left end? But typically head is the front? For left-moving, the front would be the leftmost? \n\n   Actually, the update for left: \n        [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n        So if the car is moving left, then the entire car shifts left. So the head (front) is the leftmost? Then the span is from h (left) to tau (right) but that would be increasing? But then subtracting s*(T-t1) moves the whole car to the left.\n\n   However, the representation [h, tau] implies that h is the left and tau is the right? But then if h>tau, then the interval [h, tau] would be empty? \n\n   Let me check the input: \n        On freeway 6: (12,47,left,36) -> this is a left-moving car. Then the initial span is [12,47]? But that would be an interval from 12 to 47? Then as time passes, the entire car moves left: at turn T, [12 - 36*(T-1), 47 - 36*(T-1)].\n\n   But note: the car is moving left, so the entire car moves left. So the head (which is the front) is the leftmost? Then the head should be 12? and the tail (the rear) is 47? That would mean the car is from 12 to 47 (a long car). \n\n   So in summary, we use:\n      For a car (h, tau, d, s):\n        if d == 'right': initial span = [tau, h]   (so tau <= h)\n        if d == 'left': initial span = [h, tau]   (so h <= tau)   ??? But in the input for freeway6: (12,47,left,36) -> then h=12, tau=47, so h<tau -> so the span is [12,47]. \n\n   However, note that the update for left: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-1), tau - s*(T-1)]. Since the car is moving left, the entire car shifts left by s per turn.\n\n   Similarly, for right: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)].\n\n8. Collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is between 1 and 8), then we must check every car on that freeway: if 0 is in the span [a,b] (for the car) at turn T? That is, a <= 0 <= b.\n\n9. We can precompute for each freeway (row) and for each turn T (starting from 1 and going up to a certain limit) whether the freeway is safe (no car covers 0 at turn T).\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously and we are only concerned with the integer turns. We are given the state at turn1, then we compute for turn T = 1,2,3,... the car positions.\n\nHow far in time do we need to go? The minimal H is at least 8. But we might have to wait, so let's set a limit: say H_max = 20? But let's see the car speeds: the fastest car is 36 (on freeway6) which is very fast. But we are only concerned when the car covers 0. \n\nWe can compute for each freeway the times when it is unsafe. However, note that multiple cars per freeway.\n\nBut note: the problem is that we can also choose to wait (S) or even go down (D) to avoid a car. So we might have to simulate until we find a path.\n\nGiven that the grid is small (only 10 rows) and the minimal H is 8, but we might have to wait a few turns, we can set a time limit: say up to 20 turns? \n\nWe'll do a BFS (or Dijkstra since all steps cost 1) over states (t, y) where t is the current turn and y is the current row. The initial state: (1,1). We want to reach (T,9) for any T.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. But note: if we are at row 0, we cannot go down (because y in [0,9]). Similarly at row 9, we cannot go up? Actually we can, but we are done when we reach row 9? Actually the goal is to be at (0,9). So when we first reach row 9, we stop. But note: we can overshoot? The rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and we clamp to [0,9]. So if we are at row9 and do U, we stay at 9. Similarly at 0 and D.\n\nBut we want minimal turns. So we can stop as soon as we reach row9.\n\nSteps:\n  Let Q be a queue: (turn, y, path) \n  We start at (1,1, [])\n  We mark visited states: (turn, y) to avoid cycles? But note: we might need to revisit the same row at a later turn? Because the car positions change. So we cannot simply mark (turn,y) because the same (turn,y) is the same state? Actually the state is (turn,y). But we are going to consider increasing turns. Also, we are doing BFS by turn (each step we go to next turn). \n\nHowever, note that we can also move down, so we might loop? But we want minimal turns, so we can break when we reach row9. Also, if we are going to use BFS by the number of turns (so we are expanding by increasing turn), then the first time we reach row9 we have the minimal turns.\n\nBut we must avoid states that we have visited at the same turn and same row? Actually, at a given turn, if we are at the same row, we don't need to visit it again because the path to get there might be different, but the future from that state is the same. So we can mark (turn, y) as visited.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n  Let dist[t][y] = minimal turns to reach (t,y) (but we are building the path) OR we can use a visited set for (t,y).\n\n  Steps:\n      Initialize: \n          Q = deque()\n          Q.append((t1, y_initial, []))   # [actions] so far, but note we haven't taken any action at the current state? Actually we start at turn1, and we are about to take an action at turn1.\n\n      But note: at turn1, we are at (0,1). Then we choose an action a_1, then we move to the next state at turn2? \n\n      Actually, the update: \n          At turn t, we are at row y_t. Then we choose an action a_t. Then we compute y_{t+1} = clamp(y_t + Delta, [0,9]).\n          And then we check: at turn t (the current turn), we are on row y_t. So we must check the car on row y_t at turn t.\n\n      However, note: at the very start (turn1), we are at (0,1). Do we need to check for collision at turn1? The problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways\". So at the beginning of turn1, we are on row1. We have not taken any action yet. So we must check row1 at turn1.\n\n      But the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, you are on row y_T. Therefore, we must check the current row at the current turn.\n\n      So at state (turn, y), we must check: if y is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on row y at turn t. If there is a car that covers 0 at turn t, then this state is invalid.\n\n      Therefore, the initial state (turn1, y=1): we have to check row1 at turn1.\n\n      How to check row1 at turn1? \n          Freeway1: one car: (-44,-55,right,4)\n          For a right-moving car: initial span = [tau, h] = [-55, -44] (because tau=-55, h=-44). \n          Is 0 in [-55,-44]? No. So safe.\n\n      Then we choose an action at turn1: which leads to the next state at turn2.\n\n      But note: after taking the action at turn1, we move to y2, and then at turn2 we will be at row y2, and we have to check row y2 at turn2.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". So at each turn T, we check the row we are currently on (y_T) at that turn T.\n\n      Therefore, in the state (t, y), we are at turn t and row y. Then we must check row y at turn t for collision. If it is safe, then we can choose an action for this turn.\n\n      Then we compute the next row: y_next = clamp(y + Delta, [0,9]) and the next turn is t+1.\n\n      Then the next state is (t+1, y_next). But then at state (t+1, y_next), we will check row y_next at turn t+1.\n\n      So the algorithm:\n\n        Let Q be a queue of (t, y, path) where path is the list of actions taken so far (from turn1 to turn t-1). Then at state (t,y), we are about to choose the action for turn t.\n\n        However, note: we have to check the current state (t,y) for collision? Actually, the state (t,y) is the state at the beginning of turn t. Then we choose an action a_t, which leads to the next row at the next turn. But the problem says that at turn t, we are on row y. And we must not collide at turn t. So we must check (t,y) for collision.\n\n        Therefore, when we dequeue a state (t,y), we first check if (t,y) is safe? If not, skip. If safe, then we can take actions.\n\n        Then for each action in [U, D, S]:\n            y_next = y + Delta (then clamp to [0,9])\n            Then the next state is (t+1, y_next).\n\n        Then we enqueue (t+1, y_next, path + [action]) if we haven't visited (t+1, y_next) before.\n\n        We stop when we reach y_next = 9 (and then we output the actions: the path so far plus the last action that got us to 9? But note: when we are at (t,y) and we choose an action that leads to y_next=9, then the action we just took is the last one. And we are done.\n\n        However, note: when we reach (t+1, 9), we have to check that at turn t+1, being on row9: but row9 has no cars (because cars are only on rows 1-8). So row9 is always safe. Therefore, we can stop.\n\n        But wait: the state (t+1,9): we are at the beginning of turn t+1 on row9. Then we would check row9 at turn t+1? Since row9 has no cars, it's safe. Then we can stop.\n\n        Actually, we are done when we are at row9? The goal is to reach (0,9). The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" meaning the position. But note: the grid is (0,9) meaning x=0 and y=9? But the x-coordinate is always 0? The player moves vertically? Actually, the player is always at x=0? The problem says: \"the initial position (0, y_{t1})\", and the cars are on freeways (rows) and they move horizontally. So the player is always at x=0. \n\n        Therefore, when the player is at row9, that is the goal.\n\n        So the algorithm:\n\n          Let visited be a set of (t,y) to avoid duplicates.\n\n          Q = deque()\n          Start: (t=1, y=1, path=[])\n\n          while Q is not empty:\n             pop state (t, y, path)\n\n             if (t,y) is already visited, skip. Else mark visited.\n\n             Check row y at turn t: if y is in [1,8] then check all cars on row y at turn t. If any car covers 0, then skip (this state is unsafe). If y is 0 or 9, then no cars? So safe.\n\n             If this state is safe and y==9: then we output the path (which has the actions for turns 1 to t-1) and stop.\n\n             If safe and not at goal, then for each action in [U, D, S]:\n                 y_next = y + dy[action] (clamped to [0,9])\n                 Then next state: (t+1, y_next, path + [action])\n\n                 And if (t+1, y_next) is not visited, enqueue.\n\n          If we don't find, we may extend the turn limit.\n\nBut note: we are doing BFS by increasing t, so the first time we reach row9 we have the minimal H.\n\nHowever, the state space: t can be large? But we set a limit. Since minimal H is 8, and we are going to try until we find a solution, and the grid is small, we can set a max_turn, say 20.\n\nBut let's see: the cars move and we might have to wait. The worst-case: we might have to wait for a car to pass? The cars are moving at speed 4 or 36. The car on row6 is moving at 36: it moves 36 units per turn. So if we are on row6 at the wrong time, we have to wait until the car passes. How long? The car on row6: (12,47,left,36) at turn1: span [12,47] -> at turn1: [12,47] -> 0 is not in [12,47]. Then at turn2: [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11] -> now 0 is in [-24,11]? -> unsafe at turn2? \n        At turn2: [-24,11] -> 0 is in [-24,11]? yes, because -24<=0<=11.\n\n        Then at turn3: [12-36*2, 47-36*2] = [-60, -25] -> 0 not in there.\n\n        So row6 is unsafe at turn2? \n\n        Similarly, we must avoid being on row6 at turn2.\n\n        But note: we start at turn1 at row1. We can only get to row6 at the earliest at turn? \n            turn1: row1 -> if we go up: turn2: row2, turn3: row3, ... turn6: row6. So at turn6 we would be at row6. \n\n        But at turn6, the car on row6: \n            time passed = 6-1 = 5 -> [12-36*5, 47-36*5] = [12-180, 47-180] = [-168, -133] -> safe.\n\n        So if we go straight up from row1 to row6 in 5 moves (so at turn6 we are at row6) -> safe.\n\n        But if we were to be at row6 at turn2? That would require going from row1 to row6 in one turn? That's impossible because we can only move one row per turn.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal path without waiting: 8 moves (8 turns: from turn1 to turn8, then at turn9 we are at row9). \n\n        But we must check each row we step on at the turn we are on.\n\n        Let's simulate the straight up path:\n\n          turn1: at row1 -> safe? \n                row1: car: (-44,-55,right,4) -> at turn1: [-55, -44] -> safe.\n\n          turn2: at row2 -> \n                row2: same car? row2: car: (-44,-55,right,4) -> at turn2: [-55+4, -44+4] = [-51,-40] -> safe.\n\n          turn3: row3 -> \n                row3: two cars: (52,41,right,4) and (4,-7,right,4)\n                For (52,41,right,4): at turn3: [41+4*(3-1), 52+4*(3-1)] = [41+8,52+8] = [49,60] -> safe (0 not in [49,60])\n                For (4,-7,right,4): [ -7+8, 4+8] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe? but 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n          turn4: row4 -> same two cars? \n                (52,41,right,4): [41+4*3, 52+4*3] = [41+12,52+12]=[53,64] -> safe.\n                (4,-7,right,4): [-7+12,4+12]=[5,16] -> safe.\n\n          turn5: row5 -> same two cars? \n                [41+16,52+16]=[57,68] -> safe.\n                [-7+16,4+16]=[9,20] -> safe.\n\n          turn6: row6 -> \n                car: (12,47,left,36) -> at turn6: [12-36*5, 47-36*5] = [12-180,47-180]=[-168,-133] -> safe.\n\n          turn7: row7 -> \n                row7: three cars: (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (-20,-31,right,4)\n                For (52,41,right,4): [41+4*6,52+4*6]=[41+24,52+24]=[65,76] -> safe.\n                (16,5,right,4): [5+24,16+24]=[29,40] -> safe.\n                (-20,-31,right,4): [-31+24, -20+24]=[-7,4] -> 0 in [-7,4]? yes: -7<=0<=4 -> unsafe! \n\n          So at turn7, if we are at row7, we collide.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot be at row7 at turn7.\n\n          How to avoid? We can wait at row6 for one turn? Then at turn7 we are still at row6? Then at turn7: row6 is safe? \n                row6 at turn7: [12-36*6,47-36*6]=[12-216,47-216]=[-204,-169] -> safe.\n\n          Then at turn8: we move to row7. Then we are at row7 at turn8.\n                row7 at turn8: \n                  (52,41,right,4): [41+4*7,52+4*7]=[41+28,52+28]=[69,80] -> safe.\n                  (16,5,right,4): [5+28,16+28]=[33,44] -> safe.\n                  (-20,-31,right,4): [-31+28, -20+28]=[-3,8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\n          Still unsafe at turn8.\n\n          Then we wait again at row6 for another turn? Then at turn8: row6: safe (as above). Then at turn9: move to row7.\n                row7 at turn9: \n                  (52,41): [41+32,52+32]=[73,84] -> safe.\n                  (16,5): [5+32,16+32]=[37,48] -> safe.\n                  (-20,-31): [-31+32, -20+32]=[1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n          Then we can go: \n                turn9: at row7 -> safe.\n                Then we can go to row8 at turn10: \n                    row8 at turn10: \n                       car: (-44,-55,right,4) -> at turn10: [-55+4*9, -44+4*9]=[-55+36,-44+36]=[-19,-8] -> 0 not in there? -> safe? \n                       Actually, -19<=0<=-8? no, because 0 is not <= -8. -> safe.\n\n                Then turn11: go to row9: safe.\n\n          Total turns: from turn1 to turn11 -> 11 actions? \n\n          But the actions: \n                turn1: U -> row2 at turn2\n                turn2: U -> row3 at turn3\n                turn3: U -> row4 at turn4\n                turn4: U -> row5 at turn5\n                turn5: U -> row6 at turn6\n                turn6: S -> row6 at turn7\n                turn7: S -> row6 at turn8\n                turn8: S -> row6 at turn9? \n                But we said at turn9 we are at row7? \n\n          Actually, we need to be careful: \n                At turn6: we are at row6 -> we choose S -> so at turn7 we are still at row6.\n                Then at turn7: we choose S -> at turn8 we are still at row6.\n                Then at turn8: we choose U -> then at turn9 we are at row7.\n\n          Then:\n                turn9: at row7 -> safe? yes (as above) -> then we choose U: to row8 at turn10.\n                turn10: at row8 -> safe? yes -> then choose U: to row9 at turn11.\n\n          So the actions: \n                turn1: U\n                turn2: U\n                turn3: U\n                turn4: U\n                turn5: U\n                turn6: S\n                turn7: S\n                turn8: U\n                turn9: U\n                turn10: U\n\n          Then at turn11 we are at row9? But wait: from row6 to row7: one step. Then row7 to row8: one step. Then row8 to row9: one step. So we need 3 moves from row6 to row9. And we had 5 moves to get to row6 (at turn6). Then we waited two turns (at turn6 and turn7) so that at turn8 we moved to row7? Actually:\n\n                turn1: start at row1 -> after action U: at turn2 at row2.\n                turn2: U -> turn3: row3\n                turn3: U -> turn4: row4\n                turn4: U -> turn5: row5\n                turn5: U -> turn6: row6   (so at the beginning of turn6 we are at row6)\n                turn6: choose S -> then at turn7 we are still at row6.\n                turn7: choose S -> at turn8: row6.\n                turn8: choose U -> at turn9: row7.\n                turn9: choose U -> at turn10: row8.\n                turn10: choose U -> at turn11: row9.\n\n          So we have 10 actions? from turn1 to turn10? \n\n          But note: the goal is to be at row9. We are at row9 at the beginning of turn11? But we don't need to take an action at turn11? \n\n          Actually, the problem: we need to output the actions from turn1 to the last action that gets us to row9. The last action is at turn10: U that gets us from row8 to row9. Then at the beginning of turn11, we are at row9. \n\n          So the sequence of actions is for turns: 1,2,...,10. So H=10.\n\n          But is there a shorter path? \n\n          Alternatively, we might avoid row7 at the critical times by taking a detour? For example, when we are at row6, we could go down to row5? But that would cost extra moves. \n\n          Let me check: is row7 safe at turn10? \n                turn10: row7: \n                   (52,41): [41+4*9,52+4*9]=[41+36,52+36]=[77,88] -> safe.\n                   (16,5): [5+36,16+36]=[41,52] -> safe.\n                   (-20,-31): [-31+36, -20+36]=[5,16] -> safe.\n\n          So if we can be at row7 at turn10, that would be safe.\n\n          How? \n                We need to be at row7 at turn10. \n                We start at row1 at turn1.\n                We can spend 9 moves? \n\n                We can go to row6 at turn6 (5 moves: 5 U's). Then we wait at row6 for 4 turns? Then at turn10 we are at row6? Then we can't be at row7 at turn10.\n\n          Alternatively, we can slow down earlier? \n\n          How about: \n                We go to row5 at turn5 (as before). Then at turn5 we are at row5. \n                Then at turn5: row5: safe? \n                    row5: two cars: (52,41,right,4) and (4,-7,right,4)\n                    at turn5: \n                         (52,41): [41+4*4,52+4*4]=[57,68] -> safe.\n                         (4,-7): [-7+16,4+16]=[9,20] -> safe.\n\n                Then at turn6: we could choose to stay at row5? \n                    row5 at turn6: \n                         (52,41): [41+20,52+20]=[61,72] -> safe.\n                         (4,-7): [-7+20,4+20]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\n                Then at turn7: stay at row5? \n                    row5 at turn7: \n                         [41+24,52+24]=[65,76] -> safe.\n                         [ -7+24, 4+24]=[17,28] -> safe.\n\n                Then at turn8: move to row6? \n                    row6 at turn8: \n                         [12-36*7,47-36*7]=[12-252,47-252]=[-240,-205] -> safe.\n\n                Then at turn9: move to row7? \n                    row7 at turn9: \n                         (52,41): [41+32,52+32]=[73,84] -> safe.\n                         (16,5): [5+32,16+32]=[37,48] -> safe.\n                         (-20,-31): [-31+32, -20+32]=[1,12] -> safe? 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n                Then at turn10: move to row8? \n                    row8 at turn10: \n                         (-44,-55,right,4): [-55+4*9, -44+4*9]=[-55+36,-44+36]=[-19,-8] -> safe.\n\n                Then at turn11: move to row9.\n\n                So actions: \n                    turn1: U\n                    turn2: U\n                    turn3: U\n                    turn4: U\n                    turn5: S   (stay at row5)\n                    turn6: S   (stay at row5)\n                    turn7: S   (stay at row5)   [so we stayed 3 turns at row5?]\n                    turn8: U   -> to row6\n                    turn9: U   -> to row7\n                    turn10: U  -> to row8\n                    turn11: U  -> to row9\n\n                Then we have 11 actions? H=11.\n\n          Alternatively, we can leave earlier: \n                Instead of staying at row5 for 3 turns, we stay for 2 turns? \n                Then at turn7: we move to row6? \n                    row6 at turn7: [12-36*6,47-36*6]=[12-216,47-216]=[-204,-169] -> safe.\n                Then at turn8: move to row7? \n                    row7 at turn8: \n                         (52,41): [41+28,52+28]=[69,80] -> safe.\n                         (16,5): [5+28,16+28]=[33,44] -> safe.\n                         (-20,-31): [-31+28, -20+28]=[-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\n          So we have to avoid row7 at turn8.\n\n          Therefore, the first solution we found (with 10 actions) is better.\n\n          But wait: we found a solution with 10 actions? \n                Actions: \n                  turn1: U -> row2 at turn2\n                  turn2: U -> row3 at turn3\n                  turn3: U -> row4 at turn4\n                  turn4: U -> row5 at turn5\n                  turn5: U -> row6 at turn6\n                  turn6: S -> row6 at turn7\n                  turn7: S -> row6 at turn8\n                  turn8: U -> row7 at turn9   -> safe? \n                  turn9: U -> row8 at turn10   -> safe?\n                  turn10: U -> row9 at turn11.\n\n          But then we have 10 actions, and we reach row9 at turn11. \n\n          However, the problem asks for the minimal H. \n\n          Is there a solution with 9 actions? Then we would be at row9 at turn10? \n\n          How? \n                We start at row1 at turn1. We need to get to row9 in 9 moves? That requires 8 moves up and possibly one wait? \n\n          We must be at row9 at the beginning of turn10? \n\n          We must avoid being on row7 at turn7 and turn8? But we can be at row7 at turn9? \n\n          How to get to row9 at turn10? \n                turn1: row1 -> safe\n                turn2: row2 -> safe\n                turn3: row3 -> safe\n                turn4: row4 -> safe\n                turn5: row5 -> safe\n                turn6: row6 -> safe\n                turn7: row7 -> unsafe? because at turn7: row7 has the car [-7,4] -> unsafe. \n                turn8: row8 -> safe? \n                turn9: row9 -> safe\n\n          But we cannot skip row7. We must pass through row7. \n\n          So we cannot be at row7 at turn7?

Then we do U at turn8 -> then at turn9 we are at row7? \n                But we have to check row7 at turn9: safe? yes.\n\n          Then at turn9: we do U -> row8 at turn10: safe? \n                row8 at turn10: [-55+36, -44+36] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\n          Then at turn10: we do U -> row9 at turn11.\n\n          But note: the problem says to output the actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... until the last action. \n          We have 10 actions: for turn1 to turn10.\n\n          However, we must verify the entire path:\n\n          State at turn1: (1,1) -> safe? row1: [-55,-44] -> safe -> then we choose U -> so next state: turn2, row2.\n\n          turn2: (2,2) -> safe? row2: [-55+4, -44+4] = [-51,-40] -> safe -> choose U -> turn3, row3.\n\n          turn3: (3,3) -> safe? row3: \n                car1: [41+4*(3-1), 52+4*(3-1)] = [49,60] -> safe.\n                car2: [-7+8, 4+8] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe?

So t from 0 to 9: \n              a_{1+0} = a1 = U\n              a_{1+1} = a2 = U\n              ...\n              a_{1+9} = a10 = U\n\n          So we output:\n\n          Turn 1: U\n          Turn 2: U\n          Turn 3: U\n          Turn 4: U\n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: S\n          Turn 7: S\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n\n          However, note: the problem says the current turn is t1, and we start at turn1. \n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n          \\boxed{\n          Turn 1: U\n          Turn 2: U\n          Turn 3: U\n          Turn 4: U\n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: S\n          Turn 7: S\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n          }\n\n          But is there a solution with H=9? We thought no, but let me double-check.\n\n          Suppose we try to be at row7 at turn9 (as above) and then at turn9 we are at row7, and then we go to row8 at turn10 and row9 at turn11? That would be 10 moves. \n\n          Alternatively, can we be at row8 at turn9? Then we could go to row9 at turn10? \n                Then we need to get to row8 at turn9: \n                    We start at row1 at turn1. \n                    We must have taken 7 moves to get to row8? \n                    So we would have to be at row8 at turn8? \n\n                But row8 at turn8: \n                    car: (-44,-55,right,4) -> at turn8: [-55+4*7, -44+4*7]=[-55+28,-44+28]=[-27,-16] -> safe? 0 not in [-27,-16] -> safe.\n\n                Then at turn8: we are at row8? \n                Then we can go to row9 at turn9? \n\n                How to get to row8 at turn8? \n                    We must have been at row7 at turn7? \n                    But row7 at turn7: unsafe (because of the car [-7,4])? \n\n                So we cannot be at row7 at turn7. \n\n                Then we have to avoid row7 at turn7? We can be at row7 at turn9? But then we are at row8 at turn10? \n\n          So we cannot avoid the two waits? \n\n          Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n          We'll output the sequence.\n\n          However, note: we must check if there is a solution with H=10 that doesn't require two waits? \n          But we found one with two waits at row6.\n\n          Alternatively, we can wait at a different row? But we showed that row7 is unsafe at turn7 and turn8, and becomes safe at turn9. So we have to avoid row7 until turn9. \n\n          Therefore, we must be at row6 for turns 6,7,8? Then move to row7 at turn9? \n\n          But we start at row1 at turn1. We can get to row6 at turn6 (by moving up 5 times). Then we wait at row6 for two turns (turns6 and 7: so actions at turn6 and turn7 are S). Then at turn8 we move to row7? But that would be at turn9 we are at row7? \n                Actually: \n                    turn6: at row6 -> then we do S: so at turn7 we are at row6.\n                    turn7: at row6 -> then we do U: so at turn8 we are at row7? \n                Then we are at row7 at turn8? -> unsafe? \n\n          Therefore, we must wait one more turn? So we wait at turn7: S -> then at turn8 we are still at row6. Then at turn8: U -> then at turn9 we are at row7 (safe). \n\n          So we have to wait at row6 for two turns (turn6 and turn7: both S) and then at turn8: U to row7. Then we can do U at turn9 to row8 and U at turn10 to row9.\n\n          So the sequence is fixed.\n\n          We'll code the BFS to confirm, but we have a candidate.\n\n          However, we might have missed a solution that goes through row0? \n          The player can go down to row0? \n          But row0 has no cars? So it's safe. \n          But then we have to go up from row0 to row1, etc. That would take more moves. \n\n          Similarly, we can avoid row7 by going down? But that would require going down from row6 to row5, then wait, then go back? That would be more moves.\n\n          So we are confident.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          \\boxed{\n          Turn 1: U\n          Turn 2: U\n          Turn 3: U\n          Turn 4: U\n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: S\n          Turn 7: S\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n          }\n\n          But note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. And t1=1.\n\n          We output for turn1 to turn10.\n\n          We have 10 actions? and the player reaches row9 at the beginning of turn11? But the goal is to reach (0,9). The problem doesn't say we have to stop at the same turn we reach? We just need to be there at some turn. And we are there at turn11. The actions are for turns 1 to 10.\n\n          This is acceptable.\n\n          However, let me check the definition: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" to reach (0,9). So H is the number of actions. After H actions, we are at (0,9). \n\n          How many turns have passed? \n                We start at turn1. \n                After the first action (at turn1) we are at turn2? \n                After the last action (at turn10) we are at turn11? \n\n          And at the beginning of turn11, we are at row9? \n\n          So it meets the requirement.\n\n          Therefore, we output the above.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer format we output the sequence. The minimal H is 10.\n\n          We are done.\n\n          However, to be thorough, we can write a BFS to confirm.\n\n          We'll write a BFS for states (t, y) for t from 1 to 20.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            safe(t, y): \n                if y==0 or y==9: return True   (because no cars)\n                else:\n                  for each car on row y:\n                    (h, tau, d, s) = car\n                    if d == 'right':\n                       time_elapsed = t - 1   # because from turn1 to turn t\n                       tail_new = tau + s * time_elapsed\n                       head_new = h + s * time_elapsed\n                       span = [tail_new, head_new]   # note: tail_new <= head_new\n                    else: # left\n                       time_elapsed = t - 1\n                       head_new = h - s * time_elapsed\n                       tail_new = tau - s * time_elapsed\n                       span = [head_new, tail_new]   # but note: for left, head_new is the left end? and tail_new the right? and head_new <= tail_new? \n                       Actually, the update: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(t-1), tau - s*(t-1)]. \n                       And we represent the span as [min, max]? But the condition: if 0 is in the interval? We need to know the min and max of the span.\n\n                    Actually, regardless of direction, we can represent the span as [left, right] where left = min(span[0], span[1]) and right = max(span[0], span[1])? \n                    But wait: for a right-moving car, the span is [tau+s*(t-1), h+s*(t-1)] and since tau<=h, then left = tau+s*(t-1), right = h+s*(t-1).\n                    For a left-moving car: the span is [h-s*(t-1), tau-s*(t-1)] and since h<=tau? In the input for left: h=12, tau=47 -> h<tau, so after subtraction, we have [12-36*(t-1), 47-36*(t-1)] and since 12-36*(t-1) < 47-36*(t-1), so we can represent as [low, high] = [min, max] = [12-36*(t-1), 47-36*(t-1)].\n\n                    But actually, the update for left: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(t-1), tau - s*(t-1)]. And if h<=tau, then the first number is the left and the second the right? \n\n                    However, if we have a car that is left-moving and h>tau? Then the initial span [h, tau] would be decreasing? But that doesn't make sense. \n\n                    The input: for left, we have (12,47) which is (head=12, tail=47) and the span is [12,47] meaning from 12 to 47? So we can always represent the car's current span as [min, max] = [min(head_new, tail_new), max(head_new, tail_new)]? \n\n                    But note: the update for left: \n                         [h, tau] -> [h - s*(t-1), tau - s*(t-1)]\n                    and we don't know if h<=tau? \n\n                    In the input: \n                         freeway6: (12,47,left,36) -> so h=12, tau=47 -> h<tau. \n                    But what if we had (47,12,left,36)? Then the update: [47-36*(t-1), 12-36*(t-1)] -> and then the span would be [12-36*(t-1), 47-36*(t-1)]? But that would be the same as above? \n\n                    Actually, the problem says for left: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" and then becomes [h-s*(T-t1), tau-s*(T-t1)]. So if we have h>tau, then the span at T would be [h-s*(T-t1), tau-s*(T-t1)] and then if h-s*(T-t1) > tau-s*(T-t1), then the interval is [tau-s*(T-t1), h-s*(T-t1)]? But that's not what the problem says. \n\n                    The problem says: the span at T is [h-s*(T-t1), tau-s*(T-t1)] without swapping. \n\n                    So to check if 0 is in the interval, we can do:\n\n                         if d == 'right':\n                            left = tau + s*(t-1)\n                            right = h + s*(t-1)\n                         else: # left\n                            left = h - s*(t-1)\n                            right = tau - s*(t-1)\n\n                         But then if left <= right, then the interval is [left, right]. \n                         If left > right, then the interval is [right, left]? \n\n                    Actually, the problem does not specify that h and tau are given in any particular order? \n\n                    However, the input: \n                         For freeway1: (-44,-55,right,4) -> here h=-44, tau=-55 -> so tau=-55, h=-44 -> so tau<=h? \n                         For freeway6: (12,47,left,36) -> h=12, tau=47 -> so h<=tau? \n\n                    So it appears that for right-moving: tau <= h? and for left-moving: h<=tau? \n\n                    Therefore, we can assume:\n                         right: [tau, h] -> then after time: [tau + s*(t-1), h + s*(t-1)] -> and tau<=h so left=tau+s*(t-1) <= h+s*(t-1)=right.\n                         left: [h, tau] -> then after time: [h-s*(t-1), tau-s*(t-1)] -> and h<=tau so left=h-s*(t-1) <= tau-s*(t-1)=right.\n\n                    Therefore, the span is always [left, right] with left<=right.\n\n                    Then to check: if left <= 0 <= right.\n\n            Then we do BFS:\n\n              visited = set() # (t,y)\n              queue = deque([(1,1,[])])   # (turn, y, actions)\n\n              while queue:\n                 (t, y, path) = queue.popleft()\n\n                 if (t,y) in visited: continue\n                 visited.add((t,y))\n\n                 if not safe(t,y): continue   # if the current state is unsafe, skip\n\n                 if y == 9:\n                    return path   # the list of actions that led to this state? \n                    But note: the path we have built so far is the actions taken from turn1 to turn t-1. \n                    However, in our state (t,y), we are at the beginning of turn t. We have not taken an action at turn t. \n                    And we have not taken an action at turn t, so we haven't reached the next state. \n                    But we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t? \n                    Then we don't need to take any more actions? \n\n                    How did we get to (t,9)? \n                         We got to (t,9) by the actions in `path` (which are for turns 1 to t-1). \n                    But then we are done? \n\n                    However, note: we must check that we are at row9? and we are. \n\n                    Therefore, we output the path.\n\n                    But the problem requires a sequence of actions for H turns. Here, the number of actions is the length of path, which is t-1? \n                         Because we started at turn1 and we are at the beginning of turn t, and we have taken t-1 actions.\n\n                    But we haven't taken an action at turn t? and we are at row9. So we don't need to take an action at turn t.\n\n                    Therefore, H = t-1? \n\n                    However, the problem: we are to output actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1. \n\n                    We have taken actions: \n                         turn1: path[0]\n                         turn2: path[1]\n                         ...\n                         turn(t-1): path[t-2]\n\n                    Then we are at the beginning of turn t at row9.\n\n                    So the sequence of actions is path, which has length t-1.\n\n                    Therefore, H = t-1.\n\n                    But note: we started at turn1 at row1. After H actions, we are at row9 at turn (1 + H). \n\n                    So in this state (t,9), we have H = t-1.\n\n                    We want minimal H.\n\n                    So we return the path.\n\n              How do we expand?\n                 If we are at (t,y) and it's safe and not goal, then for each action in [U, D, S]:\n                     y_next = y + dy[action]\n                     Clamp to [0,9] (so if y_next<0 -> 0, if y_next>9->9)\n                     Then next state: (t+1, y_next, path + [action])\n\n              Then we enqueue that.\n\n          We run this BFS and we should get a path of length 10? meaning H=10? and the state (11,9) is reached? \n          Then the path has 10 actions? \n\n          But wait: \n              We start at (1,1, [])\n              Then we expand to (2,2, ['U']), (2,0,['D']), (2,1,['S']) \n              ...\n\n          We are looking for the first time we reach a state (t,9) that is safe. \n\n          We know that (11,9) is safe? yes. \n\n          And we should get the path: \n              actions: \n                0: U -> (2,2)\n                1: U -> (3,3)\n                2: U -> (4,4)\n                3: U -> (5,5)\n                4: U -> (6,6)\n                5: S -> (7,6)\n                6: S -> (8,6)\n                7: U -> (9,7)\n                8: U -> (10,8)\n                9: U -> (11,9)\n\n          Then the path has 10 actions: indices 0 to 9 -> H=10.\n\n          We output the actions for turn1 to turn10.\n\n          Therefore, we are confident.\n\n          We'll run the BFS to confirm.\n\n          But since we are doing it by hand, we already did.\n\n          Final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 1, the player is at \\((0, 1)\\).

Freeway 3 has two right-moving cars. The first car has span \\([49, 60]\\), and the second has span \\([1, 12]\\) at turn 3. Neither covers \\(x = 0\\). Moving up to row 4 is safe.\n- At turn 4, the player is at \\((0, 4)\\). Freeway 4 has two right-moving cars. The first car has span \\([53, 64]\\), and the second has span \\([5, 16]\\) at turn 4. Neither covers \\(x = 0\\). Moving up to row 5 is safe.\n- At turn 5, the player is at \\((0, 5)\\). Freeway 5 has two right-moving cars. The first car has span \\([57, 68]\\), and the second has span \\([9, 20]\\) at turn 5. Neither covers \\(x = 0\\). Moving up to row 6 is safe.\n- At turn 6, the player is at \\((0, 6)\\). Freeway 6 has a left-moving car with span \\([-168, -133]\\) at turn 6, which does not cover \\(x = 0\\). Staying at row 6 is safe.\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\((0, 6)\\). Freeway 6 has a left-moving car with span \\([-204, -169]\\) at turn 7, which does not cover \\(x = 0\\). Staying at row 6 is safe.\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\((0, 6)\\). Freeway 6 has a left-moving car with span \\([-240, -205]\\) at turn 8, which does not cover \\(x = 0\\). Moving up to row 7 is safe.\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\((0, 7)\\). Freeway 7 has three right-moving cars. The first car has span \\([73, 84]\\), the second has span \\([37, 48]\\), and the third has span \\([1, 12]\\) at turn 9. None cover \\(x = 0\\). Moving up to row 8 is safe.\n- At turn 10, the player is at \\((0, 8)\\). Freeway 8 has a right-moving car with span \\([-19, -8]\\) at turn 10, which does not cover \\(x = 0\\).

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 2, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe car update rules: \n- For a left-moving car (d='left'), the car moves leftward. The span at time T (>=t1) is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n  Note: the head and tail are given at t1. In the left-moving car, the head is at h and tail at tau, and since it moves left, the entire segment moves left.\n- For a right-moving car (d='right'), the span at time T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the representation for right-moving cars: the given (head, tail) for right-moving is (h, tau) and h>tau? Actually, in the example for right-moving, the span is given as [tau, h] meaning the head is at the right and tail at left. So when moving right, the entire segment moves right.\n\nHowever, in the input, we have:\n  For freeway 3: (56,45,right,4) and (8,-3,right,4). \n  For a right-moving car, the head is the larger number? Actually, in the span for right-moving: [tau, h] and then it moves to [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So if at t1, the car is from tau to h (with tau < h). But in the input, the first car on freeway 3 is (56,45,right,4). So 56 is the head? and 45 is the tail? Then the span at t1 is [45,56]? But wait the representation says: for right-moving, the car span at t1 is [tau, h] meaning that the car occupies from the tail (left end) to the head (right end). So the car on freeway 3: (56,45,right,4) doesn't make sense because 56>45, so the head is 56 and tail is 45? Then the car is from 45 to 56? That would be 12 units long? But note: the car length is |head - tail| + 1? Actually, the car is a contiguous segment.\n\nBut the problem says: for a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [tau, h] and then at T becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So if at t1 we have tau and h, then the car at t1 is from tau to h (inclusive). So the car (56,45,right,4) at t1 is from 45 to 56? That's 12 units? But then the car (8,-3,right,4) is from -3 to 8? That's 12 units as well? That seems consistent.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the car (-24,11,left,36) at freeway6: the span at t1 is [h, tau] = [-24,11]? But then that car would be 36 units long? Actually, the representation says: for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau, and the span is [h, tau]? But note: the update rule says: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So the initial span is [h, tau] and then it moves left. However, the problem states: \"head is at h, tail is at tau\", and for left-moving, the head is the leftmost? Actually, no: the problem doesn't specify which is the front. But the update rule for left-moving: the entire segment moves left, so the head (which is the front) is at h and the tail at tau, and then both decrease. But in the example, if the car is left-moving, then the head should be the leftmost? But in the input, we have (-24,11,left,36): if the car is moving left, then the head is at -24 and the tail at 11? That would mean the car is from -24 to 11? That's 36 units? And the speed is 36? Then at the next turn, the car would be at [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25]. But note: we are at turn t1=2.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway y_T that at turn T has a span that contains 0? Then collision.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is on y_T and then moves to y_{T+1} at the next turn. So at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T. Therefore, we check the cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions (U, D, S) from turn t1 (which is 2) to turn t1+H-1, such that at the last turn (turn t1+H-1) the player is at y=9.\n\nWe start at (0,2) at turn 2.\n\nWe can plan a path that avoids the cars. Since we can only move up, down, or stay, and we are constrained to y in [0,9], we want to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves without any cars would be 7 moves (each U) to go from 2 to 9 (2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 7 moves). But we have to avoid the cars on the freeways we step on at each turn.\n\nWe must check for each turn T (starting from T=2) and for the freeway we are on at that turn, whether the cars on that freeway at time T cover the x=0.\n\nWe note that the cars are moving. We have to compute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on that freeway, the position at time T (relative to t1=2, so dt = T-2).\n\nWe are going to simulate from T=2 onwards. We are at y=2 at T=2.\n\nBut note: at T=2, we are on freeway 2? Actually, the freeways are y=1 to y=8. The player is at y=2, so freeway 2? But note: the freeway index is the y-coordinate? Actually, the problem says: \"freeways y = 1, ..., 8\". And the player is on the freeway corresponding to his y-coordinate? But note: the player is at (0,y). So at a given turn, if the player is at (0,y), then we check the freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8). If y=0 or y=9, there are no freeways? But the problem says to avoid collisions on freeways y=1..8. So at y=0 or y=9, there is no car to collide.\n\nTherefore, we only need to worry when we are on a freeway (y from 1 to 8).\n\nWe start at y=2 (which is freeway 2) at turn 2.\n\nWe are going to try to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe can use BFS (state: (turn, y)) but note the turn is increasing and we want minimal H. The state is (time, y). The time starts at t1=2 and increases. The goal is to have y=9 at any time.\n\nBut note: we can also go down? But we are at 2 and want to go to 9, so going down might not be helpful? However, sometimes we might need to wait (by going down and then up) to avoid a car. But note: we can also use S (stay) to wait.\n\nWe are going to simulate the cars' movements and see when they cover x=0.\n\nLet me first compute the positions of the cars at different times (relative to t1=2). We'll let dt = T-2.\n\nFreeway 1: car (-40, -51, right, 4)\n  Right-moving: at time T, span = [ -51 + 4*(T-2), -40 + 4*(T-2) ]\n\nFreeway 2: car (-40, -51, right, 4) -> same as freeway1: [ -51 + 4*(T-2), -40 + 4*(T-2) ]\n\nFreeway 3: two cars:\n  Car1: (56,45,right,4) -> [45+4*(T-2), 56+4*(T-2)]\n  Car2: (8,-3,right,4) -> [-3+4*(T-2), 8+4*(T-2)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway3? \n  (56,45,right,4) and (8,-3,right,4) -> same as above.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-24,11,left,36)\n  Left-moving: [ -24 - 36*(T-2), 11 - 36*(T-2) ]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars:\n  Car1: (56,45,right,4) -> [45+4*(T-2), 56+4*(T-2)]\n  Car2: (20,9,right,4) -> [9+4*(T-2), 20+4*(T-2)]\n  Car3: (-16,-27,right,4) -> [-27+4*(T-2), -16+4*(T-2)]\n\nFreeway 8: (-40,-51,right,4) -> same as freeway1 and 2: [ -51+4*(T-2), -40+4*(T-2) ]\n\nWe are at turn T=2 (dt=0) at y=2.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway y (1..8) at time T if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the span of that car at time T.\n\nWe want to go from y=2 to y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nWe can try to go straight up: 7 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\nCheck each step:\n\nTurn T=2: at y=2. Check freeway2: car [ -51+4*0, -40+4*0] = [-51,-40]. 0 is not in [-51,-40] -> safe. Then we move up: so next y=3.\n\nTurn T=3: at y=3. Check freeway3: two cars.\n  Car1: [45+4*(1), 56+4*1] = [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60]\n  Car2: [-3+4*1, 8+4*1] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n  Then we move up: y=4.\n\nTurn T=4: at y=4. Check freeway4: same as freeway3 at T=4? Actually, we are at T=4 (dt=2).\n  Car1: [45+4*2, 56+4*2] = [45+8,56+8] = [53,64] -> 0 not in.\n  Car2: [-3+8, 8+8] = [5,16] -> 0 not in -> safe. Then move up: y=5.\n\nTurn T=5: at y=5. Check freeway5: same cars as freeway3? \n  Car1: [45+4*3,56+4*3] = [45+12,56+12]=[57,68] -> safe.\n  Car2: [-3+12,8+12]=[9,20] -> safe. Then move up: y=6.\n\nTurn T=6: at y=6. Check freeway6: car [ -24 -36*(6-2), 11-36*(4) ]? dt=4: [ -24-144, 11-144] = [-168, -133] -> 0 not in -> safe. Then move up: y=7.\n\nTurn T=7: at y=7. Check freeway7: three cars.\n  dt = 7-2 = 5.\n  Car1: [45+4*5, 56+4*5] = [45+20,56+20]=[65,76] -> safe.\n  Car2: [9+20,20+20]=[29,40] -> safe.\n  Car3: [-27+20, -16+20]=[-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4]? Yes, 0 is in [-7,4]. So collision.\n\nSo at T=7, if we are at y=7, we collide with the third car on freeway7.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go straight up without getting hit at T=7.\n\nWe must avoid freeway7 at T=7? Or at least when the car is covering 0.\n\nWe have options:\n- Wait at some point so that we arrive at freeway7 at a different time when the car is not at 0.\n- Take a detour? But note we can only move up/down by 1 per turn. So we might go down to avoid, but we are at y=6 at T=6. Instead of going up to y=7 at T=7, we might stay at y=6 for an extra turn? or go up to y=7 at a different time? \n\nLet me check the car on freeway7 that causes the problem: the third car: (-16,-27,right,4). At time T, the span is [-27+4*(T-2), -16+4*(T-2)].\n\nWe are at T=7: [-27+4*5, -16+4*5] = [-27+20, -16+20] = [-7,4] -> contains 0.\n\nWhen is this car not covering 0? We solve: \n  0 in [-27+4*dt, -16+4*dt] \n  => -27+4*dt <= 0 <= -16+4*dt\n  => 27/4 <= dt <= 16/4 -> 6.75 <= dt <= 4 -> which is impossible? \n\nWait, let me check: \n  The condition: \n    -27 + 4*dt <= 0   => 4*dt <= 27 -> dt <= 6.75\n    and 0 <= -16 + 4*dt => 4*dt >= 16 => dt>=4.\n\nSo actually, the car covers 0 for dt from 4 to 6.75? Since dt is integer, dt=4,5,6.\n\nAt T = 2+4 = 6: [-27+16, -16+16] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? (because the span is [a,b] inclusive? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\" and the span is an interval. We assume inclusive? Yes, because the car is a contiguous block.\n\nAt T=6: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes.\nAt T=7: [-7,4] -> 0 is included? Yes.\nAt T=8: [-27+4*6, -16+4*6] = [-27+24, -16+24] = [-3,8] -> 0 is included? Yes.\nAt T=9: [-27+28, -16+28] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo the car on freeway7 (third car) covers 0 at dt=4 (T=6), dt=5 (T=7), dt=6 (T=8). Then at T=9 (dt=7) it is at [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nTherefore, if we are at freeway7 at T=6,7,8, we collide. We must avoid freeway7 at these times.\n\nWe can be at freeway7 only at T not in {6,7,8}. \n\nNow, what about the other cars on freeway7? \nAt T=6 (dt=4):\n  Car1: [45+4*4,56+4*4] = [45+16,56+16]=[61,72] -> safe.\n  Car2: [9+16,20+16]=[25,36] -> safe.\n  Car3: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nAt T=7: Car3: [-7,4] -> unsafe.\nAt T=8: Car3: [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\nAt T=9 (dt=7):\n  Car1: [45+28,56+28]=[73,84] -> safe.\n  Car2: [9+28,20+28]=[37,48] -> safe.\n  Car3: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway7 is safe only at T>=9? But also we must check for T<6? \n\nAt T=5 (dt=3):\n  Car1: [45+12,56+12]=[57,68] -> safe.\n  Car2: [9+12,20+12]=[21,32] -> safe.\n  Car3: [-27+12, -16+12]=[-15,-4] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo freeway7 is safe at T=5 and T>=9.\n\nNow, we are at T=6 at y=6. We cannot go to y=7 at T=7 because that would put us at freeway7 at T=7 -> unsafe.\n\nWe have options at T=6 (y=6):\n- We can stay at y=6 for one or more turns? But then we are at freeway6 at T=6,7,...?\n\nCheck freeway6: \n  Car: left-moving: [-24 -36*(T-2), 11-36*(T-2)]\nAt T=6: dt=4 -> [-24-144, 11-144] = [-168,-133] -> safe.\nAt T=7: dt=5 -> [-24-180, 11-180] = [-204,-169] -> safe.\n\nSo staying at y=6 is safe.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at T=6. We can stay at T=6: then at T=7 we are still at y=6. Then at T=7, we can move up to y=7? But at T=7, freeway7 is unsafe. Alternatively, we can wait at y=6 until T=8? Then at T=8, we move up to y=7? But at T=8, freeway7 is unsafe. We have to wait until T=9? Then at T=9, we move to y=7? \n\nBut note: at T=9, we move to y=7: so at turn T=9, we are at y=7? Then we check freeway7 at T=9: which is safe. So that works.\n\nSo plan:\n  T=2: at y=2 -> safe -> move U to y=3.\n  T=3: at y=3 -> safe -> move U to y=4.\n  T=4: at y=4 -> safe -> move U to y=5.\n  T=5: at y=5 -> safe -> move U to y=6.\n  T=6: at y=6 -> safe -> we cannot go up to y=7 at T=7 (because at T=7 we'd be at y=7 and unsafe). So we must wait at y=6 for 3 turns? until T=8? Then at T=8 we are at y=6, and then at T=8 we move to y=7? But at T=8, we are at y=6 (so freeway6: safe) and then we move to y=7 at T=9? \n\nActually, the movement: \n  At T=6: we are at y=6. We can choose to stay (S) at T=6: then at T=7 we are still at y=6.\n  At T=7: we are at y=6 -> safe. Then we can stay again at T=7: then at T=8 we are at y=6.\n  At T=8: we are at y=6 -> safe. Then we move up at T=8: then at T=9 we are at y=7.\n\nBut wait: at T=8, we are at y=6 and we move to y=7 at the next turn (T=9). So at T=9, we are at y=7. Then we check freeway7 at T=9: safe.\n\nThen from y=7 we can move up to y=8 at T=10, and then to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut is there a problem at freeway8? We have to check.\n\nFreeway8: car (-40,-51,right,4): at time T, [ -51+4*(T-2), -40+4*(T-2) ]\n\nWe are at freeway8 at T=10 (if we go from y=7 to y=8 at T=9->T=10: at T=10 we are at y=8) and T=11 (if we go to y=9 at T=11, then we are at y=8 at T=10 and then at T=11 we are at y=9, which is safe).\n\nAt T=10: dt=8: [ -51+4*8, -40+4*8] = [-51+32, -40+32] = [-19,-8] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo that works. Total turns: from T=2 to T=11: 10 turns? But H is the number of turns in the sequence? We start at T=2 (the current turn) and we take actions at T=2, T=3, ... T=10? (because we take H actions and the last action at T=2+H-1 leads to y=9 at that turn).\n\nWe are at T=2: we take 9 actions: \n  T=2: U -> y=3\n  T=3: U -> y=4\n  T=4: U -> y=5\n  T=5: U -> y=6\n  T=6: S -> y=6\n  T=7: S -> y=6\n  T=8: S -> y=6? But we need to move up at T=8? Actually, we have to move up at T=8 to get to y=7 at T=9. \n\nWait: \n  At T=2: action U -> at T=3: y=3\n  T=3: U -> T=4: y=4\n  T=4: U -> T=5: y=5\n  T=5: U -> T=6: y=6\n  T=6: S -> T=7: y=6\n  T=7: S -> T=8: y=6\n  T=8: U -> T=9: y=7\n  T=9: U -> T=10: y=8\n  T=10: U -> T=11: y=9\n\nSo we take 9 actions (from T=2 to T=10). Then at T=11 we are at y=9. So H=9.\n\nBut we started at T=2 and the last action is at T=10 (which is t1+8, since t1=2, so 2+8=10). And the player reaches y=9 at T=11? But the problem says: we are to find a sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1 such that at turn t1+H-1 the player is at (0,9). \n\nIn our sequence, at T=10 (which is t1+8) we take the last action (U) and then at the next state (T=11) we are at y=9. But we are not at y=9 at T=10? \n\nThe problem: the player update: at turn t, we take action a_t, then the next state y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nSo at the last action (at turn t_final = t1+H-1), we set a_{t_final} such that then y_{t_final+1} = 9? But the problem says: we must have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and \"at turn t1+H-1 the player is at (0,9)\".\n\nBut note: the actions are taken at turns: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}. Then the state at the end of these actions is at turn t1+H? \n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn t1 is (0,y_{t1}). Then we take action a_{t1} and then at turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1}. Then we take a_{t1+1} and at turn t1+2 we are at y_{t1+2}, and so on. After taking the last action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we get to state at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H}. But we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\nThe problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1 the player is at (0,9)\".\n\nBut in our simulation, the state is defined at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the problem states: \n  \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\nSo at the start of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} at the start of the next turn.\n\nTherefore, we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9? But then we don't take an action at that turn? \n\nThe problem: the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. So we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then after taking the last action (at turn t1+H-1), the next state is at turn t1+H. But we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut that would mean that we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action? But we don't want to move? We can take an action that leaves us at 9? \n\nBut note: we can take action S (stay) at turn t1+H-1 to remain at 9. But we are already at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1? Then we take an action at that turn to stay? \n\nAlternatively, we might be at 8 at the start of turn t1+H-1 and then take U to get to 9 at turn t1+H. But then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 8, not 9.\n\nThe problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1 the player is at (0,9)\". \n\nSo we must be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn? But we are already at 9, so we can take S. But the action at that turn is still taken? \n\nSo the minimal H would be the number of actions to get to 9 at the start of a turn.\n\nIn our plan, we are at y=9 at the start of turn T=11. So we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 2+H-1 = 11? Then 2+H-1=11 -> H=10.\n\nBut we only took 9 actions? \n\nWait, the sequence: \n  We take an action at turn 2: then state at turn3 is set.\n  We take an action at turn3: state at turn4.\n  ...\n  We take an action at turn10: state at turn11.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn11, we take actions at turns 2 to 10 (9 actions). Then H=9? But the turn at which we are at 9 is turn11 = t1+9. And the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So 2+H-1=11? -> H=10.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then \"at turn t1+H-1 the player is at (0,9)\".\n\nSo the sequence has H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1 (inclusive). The state after taking the entire sequence is at turn t1+H? But the problem says we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we take the last action of the sequence at that turn? \n\nBut note: the sequence includes an action for turn t1+H-1. Then after taking that action, we get a new state at turn t1+H. So to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we must have gotten there without the last action? \n\nThis suggests that the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, but we are already at (0,9) at the start of that turn? Then we take an action? and then we move? But we don't want to move away? \n\nThe problem says \"at turn t1+H-1 the player is at (0,9)\". So we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action? The action we take at that turn can be S to stay. \n\nBut then the sequence includes that S. \n\nSo we need to plan to be at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we take S at that turn? \n\nAlternatively, we can be at 8 at the start of turn t1+H-1 and then take U to get to 9 at the next turn? But then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 8, not 9.\n\nTherefore, we must be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn our example, we want to be at 9 at the start of turn 11. So t1+H-1 = 11 -> 2+H-1=11 -> H=10.\n\nThen we take 10 actions: at turns 2 to 11? But the last action is at turn 11? and then the state after that action is at turn12? But we are at 9 at the start of turn11? \n\nSo at the start of turn11, we are at 9. Then we take an action (S) at turn11 to remain at 9? \n\nBut then the sequence has 10 actions: \n  T=2: ... \n  ...\n  T=10: action to get to 9 at turn11? But wait, we are at 9 at the start of turn11, so we must have been at 9 at the start of turn11 without the action at turn11? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me define:\n\n- At the beginning of turn t, the player is at y_t.\n- Then we choose action a_t.\n- Then the player moves to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, which is the state at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nWe are given that at the beginning of turn t1 (which is 2) we are at y_2=2.\n\nWe take actions a_2, a_3, ..., a_{t1+H-1} = a_{2+H-1} = a_{1+H}? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: so a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nThen the state at the beginning of turn t1+H is set by the last action.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we take action a_{t1+H-1} at that turn? and then we go to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta? \n\nBut we don't care about after? \n\nHowever, the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nTherefore, we must have that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nHow do we achieve that? \n\nThe actions we take are at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nBut the last action we take is at turn t1+H-2? That leads to y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThen the sequence of actions has H-1 actions? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: that's H actions.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nand then \"at turn t1+H-1 the player is at (0,9)\".\n\nSo we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But then after that action, we are at y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta. \n\nBut we want at turn t1+H-1 (before taking the action) to be at (0,9)? \n\nThe problem does not specify if the state is before or after the action for the same turn.\n\nBut the update rule says: at turn t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set. So the state at turn t is the starting state for that turn.\n\nTherefore, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take action a_{t1+H-1} and then we go to y_{t1+H}.\n\nTo have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must have gotten to 9 by the action taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\nSo the sequence: \n  a_{t1} (at turn t1) -> moves to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-2} at turn t1+H-2 -> moves to y_{t1+H-1}=9 at turn t1+H-1\n  then we take a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1 -> but then we move to y_{t1+H} which might be 9 or 10 (if we go up) or 8 (if we go down) or 9 (if we stay).\n\nBut the problem only requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). It doesn't care about after. \n\nSo we must take an action at turn t1+H-1? But we are already at 9, so we can take S to stay? \n\nSo the sequence has H actions, and the first H-1 actions are to get to 9 at turn t1+H-1, and the last action (the H-th action) is taken at turn t1+H-1 and can be arbitrary? But we are at 9 and we want to stay? \n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and then stop? But the sequence includes H actions. \n\nIn our earlier plan, we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn 11. So to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1=11, then 2+H-1=11 -> H=10.\n\nThen the sequence has 10 actions: from turn2 to turn11.\n\nThe first 9 actions (turns2 to 10) get us to y=9 at turn11? But how? \n\nAt turn10, we take an action that moves us to y11 at turn11. We want y11=9. So at turn10, we are at y10 and we take U (if y10=8) or S (if y10=9). \n\nSo we must be at 8 or 9 at turn10.\n\nBut in our simulation, at turn10 we are at y=8? Then we take U to go to 9 at turn11. Then at turn11 we are at 9. \n\nBut the problem requires that at turn11 (which is t1+H-1 = 2+10-1=11) we are at 9. \n\nSo that matches.\n\nBut then we also take an action at turn11? The sequence includes an action at turn11. Then after that action, we move to turn12. But the problem doesn't care about after turn11. \n\nSo we can take any action at turn11? But we are at 9: we can take S to stay at 9. \n\nSo the full sequence for H=10:\n\n  Turn2: U -> from y=2 to y=3 at turn3\n  Turn3: U -> to y=4 at turn4\n  Turn4: U -> to y=5 at turn5\n  Turn5: U -> to y=6 at turn6\n  Turn6: S -> to y=6 at turn7\n  Turn7: S -> to y=6 at turn8\n  Turn8: S -> to y=6 at turn9? No, we want to move up at turn8? \n\nActually, we need to adjust: we want to be at y=8 at turn10 and then at turn10 take U to go to 9 at turn11.\n\nBut currently we have:\n\n  T2: U -> y3 at T3\n  T3: U -> y4 at T4\n  T4: U -> y5 at T5\n  T5: U -> y6 at T6\n  T6: S -> y6 at T7\n  T7: S -> y6 at T8\n  T8: U -> y7 at T9\n  T9: U -> y8 at T10\n  T10: U -> y9 at T11\n\nBut then at T8 we move to y7 at T9, and then at T9 we move to y8 at T10, and then at T10 we move to y9 at T11.\n\nNow, we must check freeway7 at T9: we are at y7 at T9? \n  T9: dt=7 -> freeway7: \n      Car1: [45+4*7,56+4*7]=[45+28,56+28]=[73,84] -> safe\n      Car2: [9+28,20+28]=[37,48] -> safe\n      Car3: [-27+28, -16+28]=[1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen freeway8 at T10: \n  [ -51+4*(10-2), -40+4*8] = [-51+32, -40+32] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nSo that works.\n\nBut we have 9 actions: from T2 to T10? That's 9 actions. But we need 10 actions? \n\nThe sequence must have H=10 actions? Then we have to include an action at T11.\n\nAt T11, we are at y9. Then we take S to stay.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  Turn2: U\n  Turn3: U\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: U\n  Turn6: S\n  Turn7: S\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: S   [this action doesn't change the fact that we are at 9 at T11? But at T11 we are already at 9? And then we take S to remain at 9 for T12? But the requirement is only at T11 we are at 9, and we take an action at T11 which is included.\n\nBut note: the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 11. We are at 9 at the beginning of turn11. Then we take the action at turn11 (which is S) to stay at 9 for turn12.\n\nSo the sequence has 10 actions: turns 2 to 11.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? \n\nWe have to avoid freeway7 at T6, T7, T8. \n\nWe were at T6 at y6. We waited two extra turns (T6 and T7) at y6? But we could have waited only one extra turn? \n\nIf we leave y6 at T7 (by moving up at T7) then we would be at y7 at T8. But at T8, freeway7 is unsafe (because the car is at [-3,8] which includes 0). So we must avoid.\n\nTherefore, we must wait at y6 until T8, and then move up at T8 to be at y7 at T9 (which is safe). \n\nSo the waiting is two turns (T6 and T7) and then move up at T8.\n\nTotal actions: 10.\n\nBut can we avoid by going down? \n\nFor example, at T6 we are at y6. Instead of staying, we could go down to y5 at T7? Then at T7 we are at y5. Then we can move up to y6 at T8, and then to y7 at T9? \n\nBut then we have to check freeway5 at T7? \n  Freeway5: cars at T7 (dt=5): \n      Car1: [45+4*5,56+4*5]=[65,76] -> safe.\n      Car2: [-3+20,8+20]=[17,28] -> safe.\n\nThen at T8: we are at y6? \n  Freeway6: car at T8 (dt=6): [-24-36*6, 11-36*6] = [-24-216, 11-216] = [-240,-205] -> safe.\n\nThen at T9: we move to y7 -> safe (as above).\n\nThen:\n  T2: U (y3)\n  T3: U (y4)\n  T4: U (y5)\n  T5: U (y6)\n  T6: D (y5 at T7)\n  T7: U (y6 at T8)\n  T8: U (y7 at T9)\n  T9: U (y8 at T10)\n  T10: U (y9 at T11)\n\nThen we have 9 actions (T2 to T10) and we are at y9 at T11. But then we need to be at y9 at T11, which is t1+H-1 = 2+H-1 = 11 -> H=10. So we still need a 10th action at T11: S.\n\nSo the sequence would be 10 actions: the above 9 plus an S at T11.\n\nBut this is also 10 actions.\n\nIs this valid? \n  At T6: we are at y6. We take D -> then at T7 we are at y5. \n  Check freeway6 at T6: safe (as before).\n  At T7: we are at y5 -> freeway5: safe (as above).\n\nThen at T7: we take U -> to y6 at T8: safe (freeway5 at T7: we are leaving freeway5 at T7? Actually, at T7 we are at freeway5? Then we move to y6 at T8. At T7, we are at freeway5: safe. Then at T8 we are at freeway6: safe.\n\nThen at T8: we take U -> to y7 at T9: freeway7 at T9: safe.\n\nThen at T9: U -> y8 at T10: freeway8 at T10: [-19,-8] -> safe.\nAt T10: U -> y9 at T11: safe (since y9 is not a freeway).\n\nThen at T11: we are at y9. We take S to remain at y9.\n\nSo that is also 10 actions.\n\nBut we did one more move (down then up) so the total moves are the same? Actually, in terms of time, we still reach y9 at T11.\n\nBut note: we used a down move, which might be less desirable? But the minimal H is 10 in both.\n\nBut we want the minimal H. Is there a way with H=9? \n\nWe want to be at y9 at turn t1+H-1 = 2+H-1 = 10? So at turn10 we are at y9.\n\nThen we must get from y2 to y9 in 8 actions? \n\nWe start at y2 at T2. After 8 actions (T2 to T9), we are at y? at T10. We want y10=9.\n\nSo we need to move up 7 steps (because 2+7=9) in 8 actions? So we can have one S or one D and then compensate? \n\nBut we have to avoid the car at freeway7 at T6, T7, T8.\n\nWe are at T2: y2\nT3: y3\nT4: y4\nT5: y5\nT6: y6\nT7: ? \nT8: ?\nT9: ?\nT10: y9\n\nAt T7, T8: we must avoid freeway7? \n\nBut we have to go through freeway7 at some point. The only safe times at freeway7 are T5 and T>=9. \n\nT5: dt=3 -> freeway7 is safe? \n  But at T5 we are at y5? We can be at freeway7 only if we are at y7 at T5? \n\nSo we need to be at y7 at T5? \n\nBut from T2 to T5: 3 actions. We start at y2. We need to go to y7: 5 steps up? Impossible in 3 actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway7 at T5.\n\nThe next safe time is T9: we can be at y7 at T9? Then we go to y8 at T10 and y9 at T11? But we want to be at y9 at T10.\n\nTo be at y9 at T10, we must be at y8 at T9? Then at T9 we take U to go to y9 at T10.\n\nBut at T9, we are at freeway8? \n  Freeway8: at T9 (dt=7): [ -51+4*7, -40+4*7] = [-51+28, -40+28] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nSo we can be at freeway8 at T9? \n\nBut we must go through freeway7 at some turn. The safe times for freeway7 are T5 and T>=9. \n\nAt T9: we are at freeway8? So we are not on freeway7 at T9. \n\nWhen are we on freeway7? Only when we are at y7. We must be at y7 at some turn between T2 and T10. \n\nThe safe turns for freeway7 are T5 (dt=3) and T9 (dt=7) and beyond.\n\nWe can be at y7 at T9? Then we move to y8 at T10? But we want to be at y9 at T10? \n\nIf we are at y7 at T9, then we take U at T9 to go to y8 at T10. But we want to be at y9 at T10, so we would need two moves at T9? Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, we are at y7 at T5? Then we have to get to y9 by T10: \n  T5: y7\n  T6: y8\n  T7: y9 -> but at T7 we are at y9? Then we are done? But we are at y9 at T7? But we started at T2. \n\nHow? \n  T2: y2 -> U to y3 at T3\n  T3: y3 -> U to y4 at T4\n  T4: y4 -> U to y5 at T5\n  T5: y5 -> we want to be at y7 at T5? We are at y5 at T5. We need to get to y7 in one move? We can only move by 1. \n\nImpossible.\n\nSo the only safe option for freeway7 is T9 or later. \n\nBut at T9, we can be at y7. Then:\n  T9: y7 -> then we can go to y8 at T10, and then to y9 at T11.\n\nBut we want to be at y9 at T10? That would require being at y8 at T9 and then one U at T9 to y9 at T10.\n\nBut then we are at freeway8 at T9? Which is safe. And we avoid freeway7? We were at y7 at T8? \n\nAt T8: we are at y7? Then we are on freeway7 at T8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y7 at T8.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach y9 by T10 without being on freeway7 at an unsafe time? \n\nThe only safe times for freeway7 are T5 and T9. \n  T5: we are at y5 at T5, so we can't be at y7 at T5.\n  T9: we can be at y7 at T9, but then we can only be at y8 at T10 and y9 at T11.\n\nSo the minimal time to reach y9 safely is T11.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nWe have two plans:\n\nPlan A (with only stays at y6):\n  T2: U (to y3)\n  T3: U (to y4)\n  T4: U (to y5)\n  T5: U (to y6)\n  T6: S (stay at y6)\n  T7: S (stay at y6)\n  T8: U (to y7)\n  T9: U (to y8)\n  T10: U (to y9)\n  T11: S (stay at y9)   [but we are at y9 at T11, and we take S to stay]\n\nBut note: we want to be at y9 at T11? Then we take an action at T11. But the problem only requires that at T11 we are at 9. The action at T11 is taken and then we move to T12. But the goal is achieved at T11.\n\nPlan B (with a down move):\n  T2: U\n  T3: U\n  T4: U\n  T5: U\n  T6: D (to y5)\n  T7: U (to y6)\n  T8: U (to y7) -> but at T8 we are at y7? Then we are on freeway7 at T8 -> unsafe! \n\nSo that plan is invalid.\n\nIn plan B, I moved to y7 at T9? \n\nCorrection:\n  T6: D -> to y5 at T7\n  T7: U -> to y6 at T8\n  T8: U -> to y7 at T9\n  T9: U -> to y8 at T10\n  T10: U -> to y9 at T11\n  T11: S\n\nBut then at T8, we are at y6: freeway6 at T8: safe.\nAt T9: we are at y7: freeway7 at T9: safe.\n\nSo that works.\n\nBut we have the same number of moves.\n\nWe can also do:\n\n  T6: D to y5 at T7\n  T7: D to y4 at T8? Then we avoid freeway7 until later? But that would take more moves.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nWe'll output one of the valid sequences.\n\nLet me choose plan A:\n\n  Turn 2: U\n  Turn 3: U\n  Turn 4: U\n  Turn 5: U\n  Turn 6: S\n  Turn 7: S\n  Turn 8: U\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: S\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence for turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1 = 2 to 11 (10 actions). \n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut note: the last action at turn11: we are at y9 at the start of turn11, and then we take S to stay at y9. \n\nWe must ensure that at turn11 we are at y9: and we are. \n\nBut is there a sequence with H=10 that avoids the down move? We have one.\n\nAlternatively, we could have:\n\n  Turn 2: U\n  Turn 3: U\n  Turn 4: U\n  Turn 5: U\n  Turn 6: S\n  Turn 7: S\n  Turn 8: U\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: S\n\nBut we need to check freeway7 at turn9: we are at y7 at turn9? \n  At turn9: we are at y7? Actually, at the start of turn9, we are at y7? \n\nHow did we get there?\n  At turn8: we take U -> so from y6 (at turn8) we move to y7 at turn9.\n\nSo at the start of turn9, we are at y7. Then we take U at turn9 to go to y8 at turn10.\n\nSo freeway7 at turn9: safe as computed.\n\nAnd freeway8 at turn10: safe.\n\nSo it is valid.\n\nBut note: at turn6 and turn7 we did S at y6. \n\nWe must check freeway6 at turn6 and turn7: safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is valid.\n\nBut we have to write the actions for turns 2 to 11.\n\nSo the answer.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=10.\n\nWe output the sequence.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=9? We argued not.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut note: at turn11 we take S. We could take any action? But S is safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the last S? But the sequence must have 10 actions.\n\nSo we must include an action for turn11.\n\nTherefore, this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must account for the car movements and the collision conditions. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10, as it is not possible to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 10 (i.e., \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 2 + 10 - 1 = 11\\)) in fewer turns due to the unsafe conditions on freeway 7 at turns 6, 7, and 8.\n\nThe car on freeway 7 with parameters \\((-16, -27, \\text{right}, 4)\\) covers position \\(x = 0\\) at turns 6, 7, and 8 (i.e., \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\)). Specifically:\n- At \\(T = 6\\): span is \\([-27 + 4 \\times (6-2), -16 + 4 \\times (6-2)] = [-27 + 16, -16 + 16] = [-11, 0]\\), containing 0.\n- At \\(T = 7\\): span is \\([-27 + 20, -16 + 20] = [-7, 4]\\), containing 0.\n- At \\(T = 8\\): span is \\([-27 + 24, -16 + 24] = [-3, 8]\\), containing 0.\nFreeway 7 is safe only at \\(T = 5\\) and \\(T \\geq 9\\). However, being at \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 5\\) is not feasible from the starting position in 3 actions, as it requires moving up 5 units in 3 turns, which is impossible. Thus, the earliest safe turn to be at \\(y = 7\\) is \\(T = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence is designed to:\n- Move up directly from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\) in turns 2 to 5 (actions U, U, U, U).\n- Wait at \\(y = 6\\) for turns 6 and 7 (actions S, S) to avoid freeway 7 during unsafe turns.\n- Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9 (action U at turn 8), which is safe at \\(T = 9\\).\n- Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10 (action U at turn 9) and to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 (action U at turn 10).\n- At turn 11, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), and the action S is taken to remain at \\(y = 9\\) for turn 12, satisfying the requirement to be at \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 11 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11\\)).\n\nAll freeways encountered during the sequence are safe:\n- At \\(T = 2\\), \\(y = 2\\): freeway 2 car span \\([-51, -40]\\) does not contain 0.\n- At \\(T = 3\\), \\(y = 3\\): freeway 3 cars spans \\([49, 60]\\) and \\([1, 12]\\) do not contain 0.\n- At \\(T = 4\\), \\(y = 4\\): freeway 4 cars spans \\([53, 64]\\) and \\([5, 16]\\) do not contain 0.\n- At \\(T = 5\\), \\(y = 5\\): freeway 5 cars spans \\([57, 68]\\) and \\([9, 20]\\) do not contain 0.\n- At \\(T = 6\\), \\(y = 6\\): freeway 6 car span \\([-168, -133]\\) does not contain 0.\n- At \\(T = 7\\), \\(y = 6\\): freeway 6 car span \\([-204, -169]\\) does not contain 0.\n- At \\(T = 8\\), \\(y = 6\\): freeway 6 car span \\([-240, -205]\\) does not contain 0.\n- At \\(T = 9\\), \\(y = 7\\): freeway 7 cars spans \\([73, 84]\\), \\([37, 48]\\), and \\([1, 12]\\) do not contain 0.\n- At \\(T = 10\\), \\(y = 8\\): freeway 8 car span \\([-19, -8]\\) does not contain 0.\n- At \\(T = 11\\), \\(y = 9\\): no freeway to check.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 2 to 11 is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 3, and I'm given the positions of cars on each freeway at this turn.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), or S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t_1=3. The direction tells me if it's left-moving or right-moving.\n\nCollision happens if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 (the x-position of the player) is within the car's span at that turn T.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new freeway, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T you are on y_T and you move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you won't be collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at turn T+1 if you're still there or arrive.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=3. For any future turn T, I can compute the car's span based on the time elapsed, which is T - t_1 = T - 3.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - 3, so at turn T, time elapsed is Δt.\n\nFor a car:\n\n- If direction is right: span at T is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] because head is at h, tail at τ, and since it's moving right, head is to the right, so as time increases, both head and tail increase.\n\nIn the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T, [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]. Since it's left-moving, decreasing x.\n\nIn the input, for left-moving, head and tail might be given, but direction specifies.\n\nIn the car state table, it gives (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 4)\n\nHead is -36, tail is -47, but direction is right. Since it's moving right, head should be greater than tail? -36 > -47, yes, -36 is larger than -47, so head is at x=-36, tail at x=-47, so the car spans from x=-47 to x=-36? But typically for right-moving, we think head is front, so if moving right, head should be at higher x.\n\nx increases to the right, I assume.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] -> span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\n[h, τ] with h and τ, but if it's left-moving, h should be the left end or right end? It says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", but in the span, for left-moving, it's [h, τ], which might imply h < τ or something.\n\nLet's see an example.\n\nFreeway 6: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so at t_1, span is [h, τ] = [-60, -25]. Since left-moving, at T, span is [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-60 - 36 Δt, -25 - 36 Δt]\n\nNow, the car is from x=-60 to x=-25 at t_1, and since moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, so at t_1, span should be [τ, h]? According to the rule:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] -> Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIn the table, it says (head h, tail τ, ...)\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -36, tail τ = -47, direction right.\n\nBut in the span for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nBecause τ = -47, h = -36, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36], which is from left to right, tail to head.\n\nThen at T, [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-47 + 4 Δt, -36 + 4 Δt]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the car state, head and tail are given, and for the span, it's defined based on direction.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, if the player is on freeway y, then for that y, if there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nPlayer position at turn T is (0, y_T), so x=0 always.\n\nI need to move from y=3 to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1, 0, or +1.\n\nSince I start at y=3 and need to go to y=9, I need to increase y by 6, so at least 6 turns if I always go up, but I might need to wait or avoid, so it could be more.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway at t_1=3.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-36, tail=-47, dir=right, speed=4 → span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 4) → span [ -47, -36 ]\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=60, tail=49, dir=right, speed=4 → span [49,60] at t_1\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, dir=right, speed=4 → span [1,12] at t_1\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4) → spans [49,60] and [1,12]\n\nFreeway 5: same: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4) → [49,60] and [1,12]\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-60,-25,left,36) → dir left, span [h,τ] = [-60,-25] at t_1\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (60,49,right,4), (24,13,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nFirst: head=60,tail=49,right,speed=4 → span [49,60]\n\nSecond: head=24,tail=13,right,speed=4 → span [13,24]\n\nThird: head=-12,tail=-23,right,speed=4 → span [-23,-12]\n\nFreeway 8: (-36,-47,right,4) → span [-47,-36]\n\nNow, player starts at (0,3) at turn t=3.\n\nI need to reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nSince I need to go up, and there might be times when going up to a certain row is dangerous, I need to check for each freeway when x=0 is occupied.\n\nx=0 is occupied if for a car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nFor a given freeway and time, I can compute if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThen, at turn T, if I am on freeway y, and for that y, at T, x=0 is covered, collision.\n\nBut I need to consider the player's path.\n\nAlso, since the player moves at each turn, I need to simulate turn by turn.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when x=0 is occupied.\n\nLet Δt = T - 3, the time since t_1.\n\nFor each car, the span at T depends on Δt.\n\nx=0 is in span if min_span <= 0 <= max_span for the car.\n\nSince span is an interval.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: car with span [ -47 + 4 Δt, -36 + 4 Δt ]\n\n0 in this if -47 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 4 Δt\n\nSo -47 + 4 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -36 + 4 Δt\n\nFirst: -47 + 4 Δt <= 0 => 4 Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/4 = 11.75\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 + 4 Δt => 4 Δt >= 36 => Δt >= 9\n\nSo for Δt between 9 and 11.75, inclusive? Since it's <= and >=, and since x are integers? The positions are integers, I think, from the values.\n\nh and τ are integers, so positions are discrete, but time is in turns, so Δt integer.\n\nΔt is integer since turns are discrete.\n\nSo Δt >=0.\n\nFor freeway 1: occupied when 9 <= Δt <= 11\n\nBecause Δt min: 4 Δt >=36, Δt >=9\n\nΔt max: 4 Δt <=47, Δt <=11.75, so since Δt integer, Δt <=11\n\nSo Δt =9,10,11\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same as freeway 1, so occupied at Δt=9,10,11\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: span [49 + 4 Δt, 60 + 4 Δt]  (since right-moving, [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [49 + 4 Δt, 60 + 4 Δt])\n\n0 in this? 49 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= 60 + 4 Δt\n\nBut 49 + 4 Δt <=0? 4 Δt <= -49, impossible since Δt >=0. So never occupied by first car.\n\nSecond car: [1 + 4 Δt, 12 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in this: 1 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 4 Δt\n\nFirst: 1 + 4 Δt <=0 => 4 Δt <= -1, impossible.\n\nSecond: 0 <= 12 + 4 Δt, always true for Δt>=0.\n\nBut both conditions not satisfied, so 0 not in [1+4Δt,12+4Δt] since min is at least 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, for first car min is 49>0, so both cars on freeway 3 have positive min, so x=0 never occupied for freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 and 5 same as 3, so never occupied.\n\nFreeway 6: left-moving, span [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-60 - 36 Δt, -25 - 36 Δt]\n\n0 in this: -60 -36 Δt <= 0 <= -25 -36 Δt\n\nFirst: -60 -36 Δt <=0 => -36 Δt <=60 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36 Δt >= -60, always true since Δt>=0.\n\nSecond: 0 <= -25 -36 Δt => 25 + 36 Δt <=0, impossible.\n\nSo never occupied.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: [49 + 4 Δt, 60 + 4 Δt], min 49>0, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: [13 + 4 Δt, 24 + 4 Δt], min 13>0, never.\n\nThird car: head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=4 → span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-23 + 4 Δt, -12 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in this: -23 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= -12 + 4 Δt\n\nSo -23 + 4 Δt <=0 => 4 Δt <=23 => Δt <= 5.75, so Δt <=5\n\nAnd 0 <= -12 + 4 Δt => 4 Δt >=12 => Δt >=3\n\nSo for Δt=3,4,5\n\nAt Δt=3: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=4: -23+16= -7, -12+16=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=5: -23+20= -3, -12+20=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=6: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo occupied at Δt=3,4,5\n\nΔt = T - 3, so at turns T=6,7,8\n\nT = t_1 + Δt = 3 + Δt\n\nAt Δt=3, T=6; Δt=4, T=7; Δt=5, T=8\n\nSo freeway 7 occupied at turns 6,7,8\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 1: (-36,-47,right,4) → span [-47 +4 Δt, -36 +4 Δt]\n\n0 in: -47 +4 Δt <=0 <= -36 +4 Δt\n\nAs before, Δt >=9 and Δt <=11, so T=12,13,14\n\nΔt=9, T=12; Δt=10,T=13; Δt=11,T=14\n\nNow freeway 1 and 2 also occupied at T=12,13,14, but since different freeways, we care per freeway.\n\nSummarize for each freeway, when x=0 is occupied (collision if player on that freeway at that turn):\n\nFreeway 1: occupied at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: same, T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3: never occupied\n\nFreeway 4: never\n\nFreeway 5: never\n\nFreeway 6: never\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at T=6,7,8\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at T=12,13,14\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at turn T=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times are when I might be on freeways 1,2,7,8 at the occupied turns.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- On freeway 7 at T=6,7,8: collision\n\n- On freeway 1 or 2 at T=12,13,14: collision\n\n- On freeway 8 at T=12,13,14: collision\n\nFreeways 3,4,5,6 are always safe, since never occupied at x=0.\n\nFreeway 6 is y=6, which is safe.\n\ny from 1 to 8, freeway k is y=k.\n\nPlayer at (0,y), so on freeway y.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at T=3.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3, which is safe, since never occupied.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is above, no cars, so safe.\n\nThe path is from y=3 to y=9, moving up.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut since I need to go up, D might not be useful, but I might need to stay or even go down to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at a bad time.\n\nBut in this case, since the dangerous freeways are only at specific times, and I need to go up, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on y=7 at T=6,7,8 or on y=1,2,8 at T=12,13,14.\n\nBut T=12,13,14 are later, so if I go up fast, I might reach y=9 before T=12, so I might not be affected by that.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7 at T=6,7,8, which is sooner.\n\nLet me see the minimal time to reach y=9 from y=3.\n\nIf I go up every turn, y increases by 1 each turn.\n\nStart T=3, y=3\n\nT=4, y=4\n\nT=5, y=5\n\nT=6, y=6\n\nT=7, y=7\n\nT=8, y=8\n\nT=9, y=9\n\nAt T=9, y=9, which is the goal, so I reach at turn T=9.\n\nNow, check if any collision during the path.\n\nAt each turn, position and freeway:\n\nT=3: y=3, freeway 3, safe (never occupied)\n\nT=4: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nT=5: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nT=6: y=6, freeway 6, which is safe, never occupied.\n\nFreeway 6 is y=6, which we said never occupied.\n\nT=7: y=7, freeway 7, but at T=7, freeway 7 is occupied! T=7 is one of the occupied times: 6,7,8.\n\nAt T=7, if I am on y=7, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn this path, at T=7, y=7, and freeway 7 occupied at T=7, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay or something, but I need to avoid being on y=7 at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=6,7,8 freeway 7 occupied.\n\nIn this direct path, at T=7 I am on y=7, collision.\n\nI need to adjust.\n\nPossible ways:\n\n- Delay arriving at y=7 so that I am not on y=7 during T=6,7,8.\n\n- Or, be on y=7 before or after, but T=6,7,8 are consecutive, so I need to be on y=7 at T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nT=5: Δt=2, T=5, freeway 7 at T=5: Δt=2, T=5, earlier we had freeway 7 occupied at Δt=3,4,5 which is T=6,7,8.\n\nAt T=5, Δt=2, for freeway 7 third car: at Δt=2, span [-23 +8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], 0 not in, so safe at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, Δt=6, span [-23+24, -12+24]= [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo freeway 7 safe at T=5 and T=9.\n\nOnly dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, T=12,13,14 are later.\n\nSince I can reach by T=9, I don't care about later times.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nIf I go directly up, I hit y=7 at T=7, which is bad.\n\nI need to not be on y=7 at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=6,7,8 are turns.\n\nAt T=6, if I am on y=6 or y=7 or y=8? Freeway occupied is for y=7 only at those times.\n\nCollision only if on the specific freeway at that turn.\n\nAt T=6, if I am on y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly at T=7, on y=7, collision.\n\nAt T=8, on y=7, collision.\n\nBut I could be on other y.\n\nTo avoid, I should not be on y=7 during turns 6,7,8.\n\nSo, I can either:\n\n- Be on y=7 before T=6, i.e., at T=5 or earlier.\n\n- Or after T=8, at T=9 or later.\n\nBut since I start at T=3, y=3, I need to go up, so being on y=7 at T=5 might be possible.\n\nT=5 is only 2 turns from now.\n\nCurrent T=3, y=3.\n\nIf I go up each turn:\n\nT=3: y=3\n\nT=4: y=4 (action U at T=3? Let's define actions.\n\nAt turn T, I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nGiven: at turn t_1=3, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,3), so y_3=3.\n\nThen at turn t=3, I choose a_3, which sets y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, choose a_4, set y_5, and so on.\n\nThe sequence of actions starts from a_{t_1} = a_3.\n\nI need actions for t from 3 to some H-1, such that y_{t_1 + H} = y_{3+H} =9? Let's see.\n\ny_{t+1} is set at turn t.\n\nStart: at turn 3, y_3=3.\n\nAfter action at turn 3, y_4 is set.\n\nAfter action at turn 4, y_5, and so on.\n\nI want y_T =9 for some T, and minimal turns to reach.\n\nThe position after H actions: after H actions, I have y_{t_1 + H}, I think.\n\nt_1 + H, but let's index properly.\n\nSet t_start = t_1 =3.\n\nAt time t, y_t is position.\n\nChoose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nI want y_{t_start + H} =9 for some H, meaning after H actions, at turn t_start + H, y is 9.\n\nTurn at which I reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if I go up every turn from t=3:\n\nt=3: y_3=3, choose a_3=U, then y_4=4\n\nt=4: y_4=4, choose a_4=U, y_5=5\n\nt=5: y_5=5, choose a_5=U, y_6=6\n\nt=6: y_6=6, choose a_6=U, y_7=7\n\nt=7: y_7=7, choose a_7=U, y_8=8\n\nt=8: y_8=8, choose a_8=U, y_9=9\n\nSo at t=9, y_9=9, reached.\n\nBut at t=7, y_7=7, which is on freeway 7 at turn 7, and occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I were at y=7 at t=6 or t=8, same issue.\n\nTo avoid, I need to not be at y=7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nPossible strategies:\n\n1. Reach y=7 earlier, before t=6.\n\nFor example, at t=5, be at y=7.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=3 to y=7 at t=5.\n\nThat would require moving up twice in two turns.\n\nt=3: y_3=3, a_3=U, y_4=4\n\nt=4: y_4=4, a_4=U, y_5=5\n\nThen at t=5, y_5=5, not 7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=5, I need y_5=7.\n\ny_5 depends on previous actions.\n\ny_3=3\n\nAfter a_3, y_4\n\nAfter a_4, y_5\n\nSo from t=3 to t=5, two actions: a_3 and a_4.\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4 = (y_3 + Δy_3) + Δy_4\n\nΔy can be +1 (U), 0 (S), or -1 (D)\n\nMax increase: both U, y_5 = 3 +1 +1 =5\n\nMin: both D, y_5=1, etc.\n\nSo y_5 can be at most 5, since from y=3, after two ups, y=5.\n\nCannot be y=7 at t=5; only possible to be y=5 at t=5 with two ups.\n\ny=7 at t=5 is impossible from y=3 at t=3 in two turns.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to reach y=7: start y_3=3, after 4 ups: t=3: U, y4=4; t=4: U, y5=5; t=5: U, y6=6; t=6: U, y7=7. So at t=7, y7=7.\n\nBut t=7 is dangerous.\n\nIf I go slower, I reach later.\n\nBut I can be at y=7 after t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=9, y=7 or something.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother way: skip y=7 during the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, at t=6,7,8, I should not be on y=7.\n\nI can be on y=6 or y=8, which are safe.\n\nFreeway 6 is y=6, never occupied, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 is y=8, but occupied only at T=12,13,14, which is later, so at t=6,7,8, freeway 8 is safe, since t=8 <12.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5,4, etc. all safe except y=7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nSo at t=6,7,8, I can be on y=6 or y=8, for example.\n\nThen go to y=9 after.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nStart t=3, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to choose actions.\n\nOption: go up to y=6 by t=6, but at t=6, if I am on y=6, it is safe (freeway 6 safe).\n\nThen at t=6, I can stay or move.\n\nBut I need to avoid y=7 at t=7, etc.\n\nSince at t=6,7,8, freeway 7 is dangerous, I should not move to y=7 during those turns.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t, when I choose action, if I choose to go to y=7 at turn t, that means at turn t, I am on y_t, and I choose a_t such that y_{t+1} = y_t +1 =7, so I arrive at y=7 at turn t+1.\n\nBut the collision is based on the position at the turn.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, which is set at the beginning of the turn, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at position (0, y_T) at the start of the turn.\n\nThen I choose action a_T, which determines the movement, and y_{T+1} is for the next turn.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T, based on y_T and the car positions at T.\n\nAs per: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, when moving, \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", meaning that at turn T, you are on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo, for example, if at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose to go up, then at turn T, I am on y_T, and at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1} = y_T +1.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and cars at T.\n\nIn the path above, at turn t=7, y_t=7, and freeway 7 occupied at t=7, collision.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=6,7,8 on y=7, I must not have y_t=7 for t=6,7,8.\n\nThat is, at no turn t=6,7,8 should I be on position y=7.\n\nSo y_t ≠ 7 for t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, I start at t=3, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{3+H} =9.\n\nWith H actions from t=3 to t=3+H-1, setting y_4 to y_{3+H}.\n\ny_{3+H} =9.\n\nFor example, with H=6 actions: t=3 to 8, y_4 to y_9=9.\n\nBut in direct path, y_7=7 at t=7, which is bad.\n\nI need to arrange so that at t=6,7,8, y_t ≠7.\n\nSince I need to increase y from 3 to 9, difference 6, so I need at least 6 actions to go up 6 times, but I can have stays or downs, which would increase H.\n\nBut I want minimal H, so I should minimize the number of actions, meaning I should go up as much as possible, but with waits to avoid the bad times.\n\nSpecifically, I can stay at safe positions during the dangerous times.\n\nNow, dangerous turns for y=7 are t=6,7,8.\n\nAt those turns, I should be on y≠7.\n\nSafe positions: y=3,4,5,6,8,9 but y=9 is goal.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, safe; y=8 is freeway 8, but at t=6,7,8, freeway 8 is safe because occupied only at t=12,13,14, which are later.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,4, etc. all safe.\n\ny=8 is safe at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, let's find a path.\n\nStart t=3, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some turn.\n\nEarliest possible: if no obstacles, t=9 as above.\n\nBut with obstacle, I might need to delay.\n\nI can, for example, at t=6, be on y=6, then at t=6, instead of going up to y=7 at t=7, I can stay or go down, but going down is counterproductive.\n\nSince y=8 is safe, I could go directly to y=8 by t=7 or something.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\nt=3: y=3, must choose a_3. Since I need to go up, probably U.\n\nAssume I go up when possible.\n\nt=3: a_3=U, then y_4=4\n\nt=4: a_4=U, y_5=5\n\nt=5: a_5=U, y_6=6  // now at t=5, y=6, safe\n\nt=6: now at turn t=6, y_6=6\n\nI need to choose a_6.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_7=7, but at turn t=7, y_7=7, which is bad since t=7 is dangerous.\n\nIf I choose S, then y_7=6, still on y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut then I am at y=6 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I can choose to go up or stay.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nIf at t=6, I choose S, then y_7=6\n\nt=7: y_7=6, now I choose a_7.\n\nIf I choose U, y_8=7, but at turn t=8, y_8=7, which is also dangerous (t=8 occupied).\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I choose S at t=7, y_8=6, then still at y=6.\n\nBut then delayed.\n\nAt t=8, if y_8=6, I choose U, y_9=7, but t=9 is safe for y=7? t=9, Δt=6, freeway 7 safe, as we saw.\n\nBut y_9=7, not 9.\n\nThen need to go further.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 at t=6,7,8, I can be on y=6 during t=6,7,8, then go up after.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nSince y=8 is safe at t=6,7,8, I could go to y=8 quickly.\n\nFor example, from y=6 at t=6, if I go up to y=7 at t=7, but t=7 y=7 bad.\n\nCannot go directly.\n\nAnother idea: reach y=5 earlier, then jump or something, but I can only move one step.\n\nPerhaps at t=5, I am at y=5.\n\nThen at t=5, if I go up, y_6=6\n\nThen as before.\n\nI need to be at y=6 or y=8 at the critical turns.\n\nSpecifically, at t=6, I can be at y=6 or y=8.\n\nBut from y=3, at t=6, where can I be?\n\nt=3: y=3\n\nAfter a_3, y_4\n\nAfter a_4, y_5\n\nAfter a_5, y_6\n\nSo three actions to go from t=3 to t=6.\n\ny_6 = y_3 + Δy_3 + Δy_4 + Δy_5\n\nSince y_3=3, and Δy <=1, y_6 <= 3+1+1+1=6\n\ny_6 >= 3-1-1-1=0\n\nSo at t=6, possible y_6 from 0 to 6, but since I want to go up, probably y_6=4,5,6.\n\nNow, y_6=6 is possible with three ups.\n\nSimilarly, y_6=5 with two ups and one stay, etc.\n\nBut y_6=6 is safe.\n\nThen at t=6, y_6=6.\n\nNow for t=7, I need y_7 ≠7, since t=7 dangerous for y=7.\n\ny_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\nIf I choose a_6=U, y_7=7, bad.\n\nIf I choose a_6=S, y_7=6\n\nIf I choose a_6=D, y_7=5, but going down not good.\n\nSo better to choose S, y_7=6.\n\nThen at t=7, y_7=6, safe.\n\nNow at t=7, I choose a_7.\n\ny_7=6.\n\nIf I choose U, y_8=7, but at t=8, y_8=7, which is dangerous (t=8 occupied for y=7).\n\nIf I choose S, y_8=6.\n\nThen at t=8, y_8=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I choose a_8, say U, y_9=7.\n\nBut at t=9, y_9=7, which is safe, since freeway 7 not occupied at t=9.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9.\n\ny_9=7, then a_9=U, y_10=8\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nSo reach at t=11, y_11=9.\n\nBut this took many turns: from t=3 to t=11, 8 actions? Let's count turns.\n\nt=3: start y=3\n\na_3=U, y_4=4\n\na_4=U, y_5=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=6\n\na_6=S, y_7=6  (stay at t=6)\n\na_7=S, y_8=6  (stay at t=7)\n\na_8=U, y_9=7  (now t=9 safe)\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nSo at t=11, y=9, reached.\n\nBut H=8 actions? From t=3 to t=10, actions a_3 to a_10, 8 actions, reaching at t=11.\n\nt_1 + H, I think H is the number of turns from start.\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAnd after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t_1=3, after H actions, at turn 3+H, y_{3+H}=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions from a_3 to a_10, that's t from 3 to 10, which is 8 actions (t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), so H=8, then at turn 3+8=11, y_11=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? Probably not, since I stayed twice.\n\nI could reach earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=6, instead of staying, I could go to y=8 directly, but I can't, only one step.\n\nSince y=8 is safe at t=6,7,8, I could be at y=8 at those times.\n\nBut from y=3, to be at y=8 at t=6.\n\ny_6=8.\n\nBut from y_3=3, to y_6=8, in three actions, max increase 3, so y_6<=6, cannot be 8.\n\nImpossible.\n\nEarliest to be at y=8 is t=8: y_3=3, a3=U,y4=4; a4=U,y5=5; a5=U,y6=6; a6=U,y7=7; but y7=7 at t=7 bad; or if I go slower.\n\nAt t=6, y_6=6 as before.\n\nAt t=6, I could choose to go down, but worse.\n\nAnother idea: at t=5, I am at y=5.\n\nThen at t=5, I choose to stay, so y_6=5.\n\nThen at t=6, y_6=5, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y_7=6 at t=7? y_7=6.\n\nAt t=7, y_7=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I choose a_7, if U, y_8=7, but t=8 y=7 bad.\n\nSo stay, y_8=6.\n\nThen U at t=8, y_9=7 safe.\n\nThen U to y10=8, U to y11=9.\n\nSame as before, or worse.\n\nAt t=7, if I go up to y8=7, but t=8 dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=8 at t=8.\n\ny_8=8.\n\nFrom y_3=3, in 5 actions: a3 to a7, y4 to y8.\n\ny8 = y3 + sum Δy from t=3 to7.\n\nMax y8=3+5=8 with five ups.\n\nBut to have y8=8, need all U from t=3 to7.\n\nt=3: U, y4=4\n\nt=4: U, y5=5\n\nt=5: U, y6=6\n\nt=6: U, y7=7\n\nt=7: U, y8=8\n\nBut at t=6, y6=6 safe, but at t=7, y7=7, which is turn t=7, on y=7, occupied, collision.\n\nSo again, problem at t=7.\n\nIf at t=6, I choose not to go up, but stay or down, then y7<7, so y8<8.\n\nThen I need more turns.\n\nSo to avoid, I must not be on y=7 at t=7.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=7, y7=7 is bad.\n\nSo I need to have at t=7, y7 ≠7.\n\nSimilarly for t=6 and t=8.\n\nBut for t=6, y=6 is safe, t=8 y=8 is safe.\n\nSo at t=7, I must not be on y=7.\n\nPossible positions at t=7: y7.\n\nFrom start, with 4 actions: a3 to a6, setting y4 to y7.\n\ny7 = y3 + Δy3 + Δy4 + Δy5 + Δy6\n\ny3=3, so y7 = 3 + sum_{t=3 to6} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y7 between -1 and 7, but y in [0,9], so 0 to 7.\n\nI need y7 ≠7 to avoid collision at t=7.\n\nBut to reach y=9 fast, I want y7 as high as possible, but not 7.\n\nSo y7 <=6.\n\nMax y7=6.\n\nThen at t=7, y7=6.\n\nThen I can go up from there.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, y6 should be such that I can reach.\n\nLet's set y7=6.\n\nThen from y3=3, to y7=6 in 4 actions (a3 to a6), which means net +3, so I need three U and one S, or other combinations, but with S, I can have three U and one S.\n\nFor example: all U except one stay.\n\nNow, when to stay.\n\nAlso, at t=6, if y6=6, safe.\n\nt=7, y7=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I choose a7.\n\nIf U, y8=7, but at t=8, y8=7, which is dangerous if t=8.\n\nt=8 is also dangerous for y=7.\n\nAt t=8, if y8=7, collision.\n\nSo I need y8 ≠7 as well.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, I must not be on y=7.\n\nSo y8 ≠7.\n\nNow, at t=7, y7=6.\n\nIf I choose a7=U, y8=7, bad.\n\nIf a7=S, y8=6.\n\nThen at t=8, y8=6, safe.\n\nThen I can choose a8=U, y9=7.\n\nAt t=9, y9=7, which is safe (t=9 not dangerous).\n\nThen a9=U, y10=8\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nReach at t=11.\n\nIf at t=7, I choose a7=S, y8=6, same as above.\n\nBut I could go down, but worse.\n\nAnother option: at t=7, y7=6, I could go down to y8=5, but then I need to go up more, worse.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTo reach earlier, I need to be at higher y at t=8 or something.\n\nSince at t=8, I can be on y=8, which is safe.\n\ny8=8.\n\nThen from there to y9=9 in one action.\n\nBut to have y8=8 from y3=3.\n\ny8 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to7} Δy_t\n\n5 actions, max y8=3+5=8.\n\nBut to have y8=8, must have all U from t=3 to7.\n\nBut as before, at t=7, y7=7, which is bad.\n\nAnd y7=7 is set before choosing a7, so at turn t=7, position is y7=7, collision.\n\nSo I cannot have y7=7.\n\nTherefore, to have y8=8, I need y7=7 and a7=U, but y7=7 causes collision at t=7.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at t=8 without being at y=7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at any turn, I must have been at y=7 at previous turn or something.\n\nBut specifically, at t=7, if I am not at y=7, then y7 <=6, so y8 <=7, so at t=8, y8<=7, cannot be 8 if y7<=6.\n\ny8 = y7 + Δy7 <= 6 +1 =7 if y7<=6.\n\nSo y8 <=7.\n\nThus, to have y8=8, must have y7=7 and a7=U.\n\nBut y7=7 causes collision at t=7.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=8 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, for t=7, cannot be at y=7.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=8 is t=9 or later.\n\nFor example, at t=8, y8<=7, as above.\n\nThen at t=8, if y8=7, but t=8 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf y8=6, then a8=U, y9=7, which is safe at t=9.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=8, a10=U, y11=9.\n\nReach at t=11.\n\nIf at t=8, y8=7, but cannot because if y8=7, then at t=8, collision since occupied.\n\nSo y8 cannot be 7 at t=8.\n\nTherefore, at t=8, y8 <=6 or y8=8, but y8=8 impossible as above.\n\ny8 <=7, but if y8=7, collision, so y8 <=6 or y8=8 impossible, so y8 <=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, y7 <=6 to avoid collision.\n\nNow, at t=6, y6 can be up to 6, safe.\n\nSo let's aim to have y6=6, y7=6, y8=6, then go up.\n\nBut that takes time.\n\nI can have y7=5 or something, but slower.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible except when forced to wait.\n\nThe only danger is being on y=7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=6,7,8 are three consecutive turns.\n\nI need to be not on y=7 during these turns.\n\nSince I start at t=3, y=3, and go up, I will reach y=7 at some point.\n\nThe fastest is to reach y=7 at t=9 or later, but t=9 is safe.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=7, with no obstacles, takes 4 actions: to y7=7 at t=7.\n\nBut here, I need to delay reaching y=7 until after t=8.\n\nSo reach y=7 at t=9 or later.\n\nt=9 is possible.\n\nFor example, from y=3 to y=6 at t=6, as before.\n\nThen at t=6, stay, y7=6\n\nt=7, stay, y8=6\n\nt=8, U, y9=7 (safe)\n\nt=9, U, y10=8\n\nt=10, U, y11=9\n\nReach at t=11 with H=8 actions.\n\nBut can I do with less?\n\nSuppose at t=5, I am at y=5.\n\nThen at t=5, I can stay, so y6=5.\n\nThen at t=6, y6=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, U, y7=6\n\nAt t=7, y7=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, U, y8=7, but at t=8, y8=7, dangerous! t=8 occupied.\n\nIf at t=7, I stay, y8=6, then U at t=8, y9=7 safe, then to y10=8, y11=9, same as before.\n\nIf from t=6, y6=5, I go up to y7=6, then at t=7, I go up to y8=7, but y8=7 at t=8 bad.\n\nSo I must not go to y8=7 at t=8.\n\nTherefore, at t=7, I cannot choose U if that would put y8=7 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=7, if I am at y7=6, and I choose U, y8=7, which is bad at t=8.\n\nSo I should choose S or D at t=7.\n\nBut S is better.\n\nThen y8=6.\n\nThen U at t=8, y9=7 safe.\n\nEtc.\n\nNo savings.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=8 directly after the danger.\n\nBut y=8 is safe.\n\nFor example, from y=6 at t=6, instead of staying, I could go down to y=5 or something, but worse.\n\nOr, since freeway 5,6 are safe, I can stay there.\n\nBut to minimize time, I need to minimize the number of stays.\n\nThe minimal H must be greater than 6.\n\nWith 6 actions, I can reach y9=9 at t=9, but in that path, I am at y=7 at t=7, which is bad.\n\nWith 6 actions, is there a way to reach y=9 without being on y=7 at t=6,7,8?\n\nSuppose I have 6 actions: a3 to a8, setting y4 to y9.\n\ny9 = y3 + sum_{t=3 to8} Δy_t = 3 + sum of 6 Δy\n\nTo have y9=9, sum Δy =6, so all U, no S or D.\n\nThen y4=4, y5=5, y6=6, y7=7, y8=8, y9=9.\n\nAt t=7, y7=7, collision.\n\nIf I have one S, then sum Δy=5, y9=8<9, not reach.\n\nSimilarly, with 6 actions, if I have all U, I reach y9=9 but with collision; if not all U, I don't reach y=9.\n\nSo impossible with 6 actions.\n\nWith 7 actions: a3 to a9, y4 to y10.\n\ny10 =3 + sum_{t=3 to9} Δy_t\n\n7 actions, to have y10=9, sum Δy=6, so six U and one S, or other but net +6.\n\nFor example, six U and one S.\n\nNow, I need to place the stay so that I avoid being on y=7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=6,7,8 are turns.\n\nAt which turn I stay.\n\nThe position at each turn.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point, y increases slower.\n\nSuppose I stay at t=6.\n\nThen sequence:\n\nt=3: a3=U, y4=4\n\nt=4: a4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5: a5=U, y6=6\n\nt=6: a6=S, y7=6  (stay, so y7=6)\n\nt=7: a7=U, y8=7\n\nBut at t=8, y8=7, which is turn t=8, on y=7, occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I stay at t=7:\n\nt=3: U, y4=4\n\nt=4: U, y5=5\n\nt=5: U, y6=6\n\nt=6: U, y7=7  // but at t=7, y7=7, collision immediately.\n\nWorse.\n\nStay at t=5:\n\nt=3: U, y4=4\n\nt=4: U, y5=5\n\nt=5: a5=S, y6=5  (stay)\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=6\n\nt=7: a7=U, y8=7  // at t=8, y8=7, collision\n\nSame issue.\n\nStay at t=4:\n\nt=3: U, y4=4\n\nt=4: a4=S, y5=4\n\nt=5: a5=U, y6=5\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=6\n\nt=7: a7=U, y8=7 // t=8 y=7 bad\n\nStill.\n\nWith 7 actions, to have y10=9, I need sum of 7 Δy =6, so six U and one S.\n\nThe S must be at a turn where I don't go up, so at that turn, y stays.\n\nBut in all cases, when I go up, I hit y=7 at some point, and if it's at t=7 or t=8, it's bad.\n\nFor example, if I stay at t=6, then at t=7, y7=6, then a7=U, y8=7, bad at t=8.\n\nIf I stay earlier, say at t=3, a3=S, y4=3\n\nThen a4=U, y5=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\na7=U, y8=7 // t=8 y=7 bad\n\na8=U, y9=8\n\na9=U, y10=9\n\nBut at t=8, collision.\n\nTo avoid y=7 at t=8, I need to not be at y=7 at t=8.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=8, y8=7.\n\nIf I have the stay later, but with 7 actions, I have to reach y10=9, so I must go up 6 times in 7 turns.\n\nThe position when I reach y=7.\n\nSince I start from y=3, I reach y=7 after 4 ups, at turn t=3+4=7 if no delay.\n\nWith one stay, I reach y=7 later.\n\nFor example, if I stay at t=k, then I reach y=7 at turn t=7 +1 if the stay is before, or later.\n\nSuppose I reach y=7 at turn T.\n\nThen T must not be 6,7,8.\n\nSo T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nT<=5 impossible, as earlier.\n\nT>=9.\n\nSo reach y=7 at t=9 or later.\n\nThen with 7 actions, I can have y10=9, which requires y9=8 or something.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\nTo have y10=9, need y9=8 and a9=U, or y9=9 and a9=S, but better U.\n\nMinimal to have y9=8.\n\nThen from y3=3 to y9=8 in 6 actions (a3 to a8), net +5, so five U and one S.\n\nThen a9=U to y10=9.\n\nNow, with five U and one S in a3 to a8, y9=8.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that during t=6,7,8, I am not on y=7.\n\nAt t=9, y9=8, safe.\n\nBut at t=6,7,8, I need y_t !=7.\n\nNow, with the actions, let's see possible sequences.\n\nFor example, stay at t=6:\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\na4=U, y5=5\n\na5=U, y6=6\n\na6=S, y7=6  (stay)\n\na7=U, y8=7  // y8=7 at t=8, bad\n\nCollision at t=8.\n\nIf stay at t=7:\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\na4=U, y5=5\n\na5=U, y6=6\n\na6=U, y7=7  // at t=7, y7=7, collision immediately\n\nWorse.\n\nStay at t=5:\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\na4=U, y5=5\n\na5=S, y6=5  (stay)\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\na7=U, y8=7  // t=8 y=7 bad\n\nSame.\n\nStay at t=4:\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\na4=S, y5=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\na7=U, y8=7 // t=8 bad\n\na8=U, y9=8\n\nThen a9=U, y10=9\n\nBut at t=8, collision.\n\nTo avoid y=7 at t=8, I need that at t=8, y8 !=7.\n\nIn the sequences above, when I have a7=U, y8=7 if y7=6.\n\nBut if at t=7, I am not at y=6, or I choose not to go up.\n\nBut in the path, to have y9=8, with net +5 in 6 actions, so y8 must be 7 or 8, but if y8=8, then a8=S or something, but to have y8=8, from y3=3, need 5 ups, so y8=8 only if all U, but then y7=7 at t=7 collision.\n\nIf not all U, y8<=7.\n\nIf y8=7, then at t=8 collision.\n\nSo either way, with the actions to reach y9=8 for the 7-action case, I have a point where I am on y=7 at dangerous time.\n\nSpecifically, to reach high y fast, I must pass through y=7 early, but that causes collision.\n\nTherefore, with 7 actions, I cannot avoid the collision because to reach y10=9, I need to have y9=8 or 9, but to have y9=8, I need to be at y=7 at some point between t=7 and t=8, but t=7 and t=8 are dangerous.\n\nFor example, to have y9=8, with a3 to a8.\n\ny9 = y8 + Δy8\n\nBut y8 depends.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=8 is t=8, but impossible as before.\n\nAt t=8, y8<=6 to avoid collision, as established.\n\nThen from y8=6, I can go to y9=7 at t=9, safe, then to y10=8, y11=9 with additional actions.\n\nBut with 7 actions, I can only reach up to y10.\n\ny10 =3 + sum of 7 Δy.\n\nMax 10, but to reach 9, with one stay, y10=9 if six U and one S.\n\nBut in that case, as above, I hit y=7 at t=7 or t=8 with collision.\n\nFor instance, if the stay is at t=3, y4=3 (after S), then y5=4 (U), y6=5 (U), y7=6 (U), y8=7 (U), but at t=8, y8=7 collision if t=8 dangerous, which it is.\n\nIf stay at t=8, but a8=S, then y9= y8, but to have y9=8 for later, but in this case for y10=9, if a8=S, y9=y8, then a9=U, y10=y9+1.\n\nBut y8 could be 7, but if y8=7 at t=8 collision.\n\nIf y8=6, then y9=6 if S, then y10=7, but at t=10, y10=7, which is safe, but y10=7 not 9.\n\nThen need more actions.\n\nI think it's impossible to reach by t=10 with 7 actions without collision.\n\nSimilarly, with 8 actions, I can reach by t=11 as earlier.\n\nAnd I can avoid collision.\n\nFor example, with 8 actions: a3 to a10, y11=9.\n\nSequence:\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\na4=U, y5=5\n\na5=U, y6=6\n\na6=S, y7=6  // stay at t=6, so at t=7, y=6\n\na7=S, y8=6  // stay at t=7, at t=8, y=6\n\na8=U, y9=7  // at t=9, y=7, safe\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nAt t=6: y6=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nt=7: y7=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nt=8: y8=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nt=9: y9=7, freeway 7, at t=9, not occupied, safe\n\nt=10: y10=8, freeway 8, at t=10, Δt=7, freeway 8 occupied at T=12,13,14, t=10<12, safe\n\nt=11: y11=9, goal.\n\nAnd actions: a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=S, a7=S, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U\n\nH=8 actions.\n\nBut I used two stays, at t=6 and t=7.\n\nI could use only one stay by being smarter.\n\nFor example, after y6=6 at t=6, instead of staying twice, I could go to y=8 faster, but I can't.\n\nAt t=6, y6=6, I could go down to y=5, but then slower.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: at t=5, I am at y=5.\n\nThen at t=5, I go up, y6=6\n\nt=6, I go up, but y7=7 at t=7 bad, so I must not.\n\nSo I have to stay or something.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=6 earlier.\n\nBut I start at y=3, to y=6 in three actions: a3U y4=4, a4U y5=5, a5U y6=6 at t=6.\n\nThen I have to wait at y=6 for turns t=6 and t=7, so actions at t=6 and t=7 are S.\n\nThen at t=8, U to y9=7, etc.\n\nI think two waits are necessary to skip the three dangerous turns for y=7.\n\nSince the dangerous period is three turns, and I need to be at y=6 or below or y=8 or above, but y=8 not reachable, so at y=6.\n\nAnd I need to be there for three turns if I stay, but I can be at different positions, but y=6 is safe, so staying there is fine.\n\nTo minimize time, with one less action.\n\nBut with 7 actions, I reach y10, but as above, I cannot reach y=9 without hitting y=7 at bad time or not reaching.\n\nSuppose I go to y=4 at t=4, then stay or something.\n\nBut let's calculate the minimal possible.\n\nThe player must be at y <=6 for t=6,7,8 to avoid y=7.\n\nAt t=8, y <=6.\n\nThen at t=8, y<=6.\n\nThen to reach y=9, from y<=6 at t=8, need at least 3 more actions: to y9, y10, y11.\n\nSo reach at t=11 at earliest.\n\nt=8 y<=6, then after a8, y9 <=7, a9, y10<=8, a10, y11=9.\n\nSo yes, earliest at t=11.\n\nWith actions from t=3 to t=10, H=8 actions.\n\nAnd in the sequence, I can have y6=6, y7=6, y8=6, then y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nAs above.\n\nI could have different paths, but this seems minimal.\n\nNow, about the cars on other freeways, but since I am on y=6 during t=6,7,8, freeway 6 is always safe, no issue.\n\nAt t=9, y=7, safe; t=10, y=8, freeway 8 at t=10: Δt=7, T=10, freeway 8 occupied at T=12,13,14, so at t=10, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=3.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a3\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nSo t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t}\n\nFor t=0, a_{t_1 +0} = a3\n\nt=1, a4, etc.\n\nNow, H=8.\n\nSo actions: for t=0 to 7: a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10\n\nIn terms of the turn:\n\nTurn 3: action\n\nTurn 4: action\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 10: action\n\nThen at turn 11, position (0,9)\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nAs above:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U  // now at turn 6, y=6\n\nTurn 6: S  // stay, so at turn 7, y=6\n\nTurn 7: S  // stay, at turn 8, y=6\n\nTurn 8: U  // to y=7 at turn 9\n\nTurn 9: U  // to y=8 at turn 10\n\nTurn 10: U // to y=9 at turn 11\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the output, it should be the actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn this case, t_1=3, H=8, so actions from turn 3 to turn 3+7=10.\n\na3 to a10.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith H=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nIs there a way with H=7? I think not, as reasoned.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=5 at some point, but would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go slower initially, but then I might reach later.\n\nNo, with H=7, y10=9, but as before, I cannot avoid collision.\n\nSuppose I have a sequence where I go up to y=4, then stay, but still.\n\nFor instance:\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\na4=S, y5=4  // stay at t=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\na7=U, y8=7  // but at t=8, y8=7, collision\n\na8=U, y9=8\n\nBut collision at t=8.\n\nIf a7=S, y8=6, then y9=7 with a8=U, but y10=8, not 9, so need a9=U, y11=9, but with 7 actions only up to a9? H=7 actions, a3 to a9, y4 to y10.\n\nTo have y10=9, with 7 actions, need six U and one S.\n\nIf a7=S, then y8=y7, and y7 could be 6, then y8=6, then a8=U, y9=7, a9=U, y10=8 <9, not reach.\n\nIf earlier actions, still, when I go to y=7, it might be at bad time.\n\nI think impossible with H=7.\n\nThus minimal H=8.\n\nAnd the sequence as above.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 6 and 7, I stay, which is fine.\n\nNow, to confirm, let's list the position at each turn.\n\nTurn t | y_t | freeway | occupied? | safe?\n\nt=3: y=3, freeway 3, never occupied, safe\n\nt=4: y=4, freeway 4, never, safe\n\nt=5: y=5, freeway 5, never, safe\n\nt=6: y=6, freeway 6, never, safe\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6, never, safe\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway 6, never, safe\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway 7, at t=9, not occupied (since occupied at 6,7,8), safe\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway 8, at t=10, Δt=7, T=10, freeway 8 occupied at T=12,13,14, so not at t=10, safe\n\nt=11: y=9, goal, no freeway, safe\n\nActions: from t=3 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at each turn.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions for the turns.\n\nAlso, for freeway 7, we have three cars, but only the third one was dangerous, but we avoided.\n\nSimilarly, others fine.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can have only one stay if I time differently, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, if at t=5, I stay, y6=5, then t=6, U, y7=6, t=7, U, but y8=7 at t=8 bad, so I have to stay at t=7 or something.\n\nThen y8=6, then U at t=8 to y9=7, etc., same as before.\n\nNo savings.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nNow, the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8. This requires a sequence of 8 actions starting from turn 3 to turn 10, resulting in the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 11.\n\nThe sequence ensures that the player is not on freeway \\(y = 7\\) during turns 6, 7, and 8, when cars on freeway 7 occupy position \\(x = 0\\) (as determined from the car states and update rules). Specifically:\n- At turns 6, 7, and 8, the player remains at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6), which is always safe since no cars on freeway 6 cover \\(x = 0\\) at any turn.\n- At turn 9, the player moves to \\(y = 7\\), which is safe because freeway 7 is not occupied at \\(x = 0\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 10, the player moves to \\(y = 8\\), which is safe because freeway 8 is occupied at \\(x = 0\\) only at turns 12, 13, and 14, not at turn 10.\n- At turn 11, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), the goal.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 3**: U (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 4)  \n- **Turn 4**: U (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 5)  \n- **Turn 5**: U (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 6)  \n- **Turn 6**: S (stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 7)  \n- **Turn 7**: S (stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 8)  \n- **Turn 8**: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9)  \n- **Turn 9**: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10)  \n- **Turn 10**: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11)  \n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal number of turns while avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 3\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10\\text{: } U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 5, but since we're starting at turn 5, and we need to find actions from t=5 onwards, I think t_1 is 5.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y_{t_1}) which is (0,5). I need to reach (0,9), so I have to move up 4 units in the y-direction.\n\nThe actions are U (up, +1 in y), D (down, -1 in y), or S (stay, no change). Since I need to go up, I should mostly use U, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nCollision occurs only if at the turn T when I'm on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nAlso, importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn. So if I move at turn T to y_{T+1}, I'm on y_T at turn T, and on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, I care about the car on y_T at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nFirst, all cars are moving right or left with given speeds. The direction is given as \"right\" or \"left\", and speed is constant.\n\nFor left-moving cars, span is [h, τ] at t_1, and at T, it's [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t_1, I think? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, head is h, tail is τ, but it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might imply that τ is the left end and h is the right end, so for right-moving, the car is moving to the right, so head is on the right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head on left.\n\nIn the collision condition, we care about whether 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nAlso, since we're at x=0, we only care about if the car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nNow, t_1 = 5, so T - t_1 is the offset.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so at time T, Δt = T - 5.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know for which Δt, the car spans include 0.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, for each turn, when I'm on a certain y, I need to ensure that at that turn, for that y, no car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, the freeways are y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer starts at y=5.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is above, so I need to increase y.\n\ny=0 to 9, so y=9 is the top.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I think. y=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top, both should be safe, no cars on them.\n\nThe game says \"freeways y=1,...,8\", so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe.\n\nSo starting at (0,5), and ending at (0,9), both are safe positions.\n\nBut during the path, when I'm on y=1 to 8, I need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-28, -39, right, 4)\n\nSince right-moving, span at t_1=5 is [τ, h] = [-39, -28]? Head h=-28, tail τ=-39.\n\nDirection right, so head is on the right, I think. Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-39, -28], meaning from x=-39 to x=-28.\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-39 + 4 Δt, -28 + 4 Δt]\n\nWe care when 0 is in [ -39 + 4 Δt, -28 + 4 Δt ]\n\nSo -39 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -28 + 4 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -39 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 => 4 Δt ≤ 39 => Δt ≤ 39/4 = 9.75, so Δt ≤ 9 since integer? Δt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn, so Δt = T - 5, integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -28 + 4 Δt => 4 Δt ≥ 28 => Δt ≥ 7\n\nSo for Δt from 7 to 9 inclusive, 0 is in the span.\n\nΔt=7: [ -39 + 28, -28 + 28] = [-11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nΔt=8: [ -39 + 32, -28 + 32] = [-7, 4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=9: [ -39 + 36, -28 + 36] = [-3, 8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=10: [ -39+40, -28+40] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=6: [ -39+24, -28+24] = [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at Δt=7,8,9.\n\nThat is, turns T=5+7=12, T=13, T=14.\n\nT=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-28, -39, right, 4)\n\nSo identical to freeway 1, collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: first (-44, -55, right, 4) and second (20, 9, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: right, head h=-44? Head is given as -44, tail τ=-55.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-55, -44]\n\nAt T: [-55 + 4 Δt, -44 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span: -55 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -44 + 4 Δt\n\nFirst: -55 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 => 4 Δt ≤ 55 => Δt ≤ 13.75, so Δt ≤ 13\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -44 + 4 Δt => 4 Δt ≥ 44 => Δt ≥ 11\n\nSo Δt from 11 to 13 inclusive.\n\nT=16,17,18? Δt=11,12,13 → T=5+11=16, 17,18.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (20, 9, right, 4)\n\nHead h=20, tail τ=9, direction right, so span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [9,20]\n\nAt T: [9 + 4 Δt, 20 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span: 9 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 20 + 4 Δt\n\nBut 9 + 4 Δt ≥ 9 >0 for Δt≥0, so lower bound is positive, never ≤0, so 0 never in span. Since min x is 9 + 4 Δt ≥9 >0, so always to the right of 0. So no collision from this car.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways with similar cars.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3: (-44,-55,right,4) and (20,9,right,4)\n\nFirst car same as above, collision at T=16,17,18.\n\nSecond car no collision.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4, so first car collision at T=16,17,18, second no.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (12,47,left,36)\n\nDirection left, head h=12, tail τ=47? Head and tail.\n\nFor left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [12,47], but if head is left, tail right, so from x=12 to x=47.\n\nAt T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [12 - 36 Δt, 47 - 36 Δt]\n\n0 in span: 12 - 36 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 47 - 36 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36 Δt ≤ 0 => -36 Δt ≤ -12 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36 Δt ≥ 12 => Δt ≥ 12/36 = 1/3, so since Δt≥0 integer, always true for Δt≥1? Δt≥0.\n\n12 - 36 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 ≤ 36 Δt => Δt ≥ 12/36 = 1/3, so for Δt ≥ 1, since Δt integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 47 - 36 Δt => 36 Δt ≤ 47 => Δt ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so Δt ≤ 1.\n\nSo both: Δt ≥1 and Δt ≤1, so only Δt=1.\n\nThus collision at Δt=1, T=5+1=6.\n\nSo on freeway 6, at turn T=6, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars: (-44,-55,right,4), (32,21,right,4), and (-4,-15,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (-44,-55,right,4), same as before, collision at Δt=11,12,13 → T=16,17,18.\n\nSecond car: (32,21,right,4). Head h=32, tail τ=21, direction right.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [21,32]\n\nAt T: [21 + 4 Δt, 32 + 4 Δt]\n\nAll positive and increasing, min at Δt=0 is 21>0, so 0 never in span. No collision.\n\nThird car: (-4,-15,right,4). Head h=-4, tail τ=-15.\n\nSpan(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-15, -4]\n\nAt T: [-15 + 4 Δt, -4 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span: -15 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -4 + 4 Δt\n\nFirst: -15 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 => 4 Δt ≤ 15 => Δt ≤ 15/4 = 3.75, so Δt ≤ 3\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -4 + 4 Δt => 4 Δt ≥ 4 => Δt ≥ 1\n\nSo Δt from 1 to 3 inclusive: Δt=1,2,3 → T=6,7,8.\n\nThus on freeway 7, collisions from third car at T=6,7,8.\n\nFirst car at T=16,17,18, but we might not care if we're not there yet.\n\nFreeway 8: (-28,-39,right,4), same as freeway 1 and 2.\n\nCollision at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway and turn when collision happens if player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFreeway 1: collision at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: same, T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3: from first car, T=16,17,18; second car no collision\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3, T=16,17,18\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=16,17,18\n\nFreeway 6: collision only at T=6\n\nFreeway 7: from third car, T=6,7,8; from first car T=16,17,18\n\nFreeway 8: T=12,13,14\n\nPlayer starts at y=5 at turn t=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must stay in [0,9], but since we start at 5 and go to 9, and freeways 1-8, probably no need to go below 0 or above 9, but y=0 and 9 are safe.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=5 to y=9 with only U actions would be 4 turns: U,U,U,U to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on certain y at certain times when there is collision.\n\nI might need to wait or detour if necessary.\n\nFirst, let's see the constraints.\n\nAt turn T=5, player is at y=5.\n\nIs y=5 safe at T=5?\n\nFreeway 5: cars at T=5, Δt=0.\n\nFreeway 5 has cars: first (-44,-55,right,4), at Δt=0, span [-55,-44], 0 not in, since negative.\n\nSecond car (20,9,right,4), span [9,20], 0 not in. So no collision at T=5 on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not relevant.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut let's see the immediate issue.\n\nFreeway 6 has collision at T=6, so if I am on y=6 at turn T=6, collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 has collision at T=6,7,8 from the third car.\n\nBut at T=6, if I am on y=6, collision from freeway 6 car.\n\nIf on y=7, collision from freeway 7 car at T=6.\n\nFreeway 7 collision at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, at turn T=5, I am at y=5.\n\nI can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U, at turn T=6, I will be at y=6.\n\nBut at T=6, on y=6, there is collision from freeway 6 car.\n\nIf I go S, stay at y=5 at T=6.\n\nIs y=5 safe at T=6?\n\nFreeway 5: at T=6, Δt=1.\n\nFirst car: [-55 +4(1), -44 +4(1)] = [-51,-40], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [9+4,20+4]=[13,24], 0 not in. So safe.\n\nIf I go D, to y=4 at T=6, but y=4 is freeway 4, which at T=6, Δt=1.\n\nFreeway 4: cars same as freeway 3, etc.\n\nFirst car: [-55+4(1), -44+4(1)] = [-51,-40], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [9+4,20+4]=[13,24], 0 not in. So safe, but going down might not be efficient.\n\nNow, back to T=5 action.\n\nIf I go U to y=6 at T=6, but collision, so not possible.\n\nIf I go S, stay at y=5 at T=6, safe.\n\nIf I go D to y=4, safe but counterproductive.\n\nSo probably at T=5, I should do S or D, but D is worse, so S to stay.\n\nThen at T=6, I am at y=5.\n\nNow, at T=6, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go U to y=6 at T=7? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, when I take action a_t, I move to y_{t+1} at time t+1.\n\nAt time t, I am on y_t, and I take action, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at time t, collision depends on y_t and cars on y_t at time t.\n\nAt time t+1, I am on y_{t+1}, and collision depends on that.\n\nAt T=6, I am on y=5 (if I stayed at T=5).\n\nNow, at T=6, on y=5: as above, no collision, since freeway 5 cars not at 0.\n\nNow, I can choose: U, to y=6 at T=7.\n\nD to y=4 at T=7.\n\nS to y=5 at T=7.\n\nNow, if I go to y=6 at T=7, what about T=7?\n\nFirst, at T=7, if I am on y=6, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 6: car at T=7, Δt=2.\n\nCar: left-moving, (12,47,left,36)\n\nAt Δt=2, span: [12 - 36*2, 47 - 36*2] = [12-72, 47-72] = [-60, -25], all negative, 0 not in. So no collision at T=7 on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 has collision at T=6,7,8, but that's for y=7, not y=6.\n\nAt T=7, on y=6, only freeway 6 matters, which is safe.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at T=7, then freeway 7 at T=7 has collision, from third car.\n\nFreeway 7 third car at T=7: Δt=2, span [-15+4*2, -4+4*2] = [-15+8, -4+8] = [-7,4], 0 is in, so collision.\n\nSo if I am on y=7 at T=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, if on y=7, collision.\n\nBut at T=7, if I go to y=7, collision.\n\nNow back to T=6, I am at y=5.\n\nIf I go U, to y=6 at T=7, which is safe as above.\n\nIf I go S, stay at y=5 at T=7.\n\nOr D to y=4.\n\nGoing U seems good.\n\nThen at T=7, I am at y=6.\n\nNow at T=7, I can go U to y=7 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, if I am on y=7, freeway 7 at T=8: Δt=3, third car span [-15+12, -4+12] = [-3,8], 0 in, collision.\n\nSo if I go to y=7 at T=8, collision.\n\nIf I go S at T=7, stay at y=6 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, on y=6: freeway 6 car at Δt=3, [12-108,47-108]=[-96,-61], no 0, safe.\n\nOr if I go D to y=5 at T=8.\n\nBut let's plan.\n\nSince going to y=7 at T=8 causes collision, I need to avoid that.\n\nAt T=7, I am at y=6.\n\nI could go S to stay at y=6 for T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=8, I can go U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, on y=7: freeway 7 at T=9, Δt=4.\n\nThird car: span [-15+16, -4+16] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAlso, first car on freeway 7 is at T=16,17,18, not now.\n\nSo at T=9, y=7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I could go directly to y=7 at a later time.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nFirst, from start.\n\nAt t=5 (T=5), position y=5.\n\nAction: if I do U, to y=6 at t=6, but at t=6, on y=6, collision, so cannot.\n\nSo must not be on y=6 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, if I do nothing, S at t=5, to y=5 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, on y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, I can do U to y=6 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, on y=6, safe as above.\n\nThen at t=7, I can do U to y=7 at t=8, but at t=8, on y=7, collision (freeway 7 car).\n\nCannot.\n\nDo S at t=7, to y=6 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, do U to y=7 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, on y=7, safe as above.\n\nThen from y=7, I need to go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nNow, what about y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nBut T=9 is earlier, so should be safe for now.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nAt t=9, on y=7, safe.\n\nI can do U to y=8 at t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, on y=8.\n\nIs it safe?\n\nFreeway 8: car (-28,-39,right,4)\n\nAt t=10, Δt=5.\n\nSpan: [-39 +4*5, -28 +4*5] = [-39+20, -28+20] = [-19,-8], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no other cars on y=8.\n\nThen I can do U again to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, on y=9, but y=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\ny=9 is the top, no freeway, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nSo from t=9, y=7, I can go U to y=8 at t=10.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, I reach y=9, which is the goal.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nStart: t=5, y=5\n\nAction at t=5: since going U immediately causes problem, we did S.\n\nt=5: S, so at t=6, y=5\n\nt=6: U, to y=6 at t=7\n\nt=7: cannot go U directly to y=7 at t=8 because collision, so we did S to stay at y=6 for t=8.\n\nt=7: S, so at t=8, y=6\n\nt=8: U, to y=7 at t=9\n\nt=9: U, to y=8 at t=10\n\nt=10: U, to y=9 at t=11\n\nAt t=11, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns? From t=5 to t=11, that's 6 actions: from t=5 to t=10 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=5 to t=10, that's 6 actions, and at t=11, we are at y=9 after the action at t=10.\n\nt=5: action, after which at t=6 position.\n\nGenerally, at turn t, after action, position for t+1.\n\nBut the position is given for turn t before action? I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nThe state is given at turn t_1=5: position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,5)\n\nThen we choose action a_{t_1} = a_5, which determines y_{t_1 +1} = y_6\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1 =6, we are at (0, y_6), and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T means when we are at position (0, y_T) at turn T, we check if for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in span at T.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt t=5: start, y=5\n\nAction a_5: S, so y_6 = y_5 + 0 = 5\n\nAt t=6: position (0,5), no collision as before.\n\nAction a_6: U, so y_7 = 6\n\nAt t=7: position (0,6), no collision as before.\n\nAction a_7: S, so y_8 = 6 (since S, no change)\n\nAt t=8: position (0,6), no collision.\n\nAction a_8: U, so y_9 = 7\n\nAt t=9: position (0,7), no collision (as Δt=4 for freeway 7)\n\nAction a_9: U, so y_10 = 8\n\nAt t=10: position (0,8), freeway 8, at Δt=5 (T=10, t_1=5, Δt=5), span [-39+20, -28+20]=[-19,-8], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_10: U, so y_11 = 9\n\nAt t=11: position (0,9), which is goal, and no freeway, safe.\n\nSo we reached at turn t=11.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=5 to t=10, that's 6 actions.\n\nBut minimal? We used one S at t=5 and one S at t=7, so two waits, total 4 U and 2 S, 6 turns to go from y=5 to y=9, which normally takes 4 moves.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWithout waiting, from y=5 to y=9 in 4 moves, but we have to avoid the collision times.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=6 is unsafe.\n\nBut if I could be at a different y at t=6.\n\nAt t=5, instead of S, if I go D to y=4 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, on y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 at t=6: Δt=1.\n\nCars: first (-44,-55,right,4), span [-55+4, -44+4]=[-51,-40], no 0.\n\nSecond (20,9,right,4), [9+4,20+4]=[13,24], no 0. Safe.\n\nThen at t=6, I can go U to y=5 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, on y=5: freeway 5, Δt=2.\n\nFirst car [-55+8, -44+8]=[-47,-36], no 0.\n\nSecond [9+8,20+8]=[17,28], no 0. Safe.\n\nThen I can go U to y=6 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, on y=6: freeway 6, Δt=3, [12-108,47-108]=[-96,-61], no 0, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, on y=7, Δt=4, freeway 7 third car [ -15+16, -4+16]=[1,12], no 0, safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, on y=8, as before, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSame as before, but I went down first, so one extra move: D at t=5, then U at t=6 to y=5, then U to y=6 at t=8? Let's list:\n\nt=5: D, to y_6=4\n\nt=6: position (0,4), action U, to y_7=5\n\nt=7: position (0,5), action U, to y_8=6\n\nt=8: position (0,6), action U, to y_9=7\n\nt=9: position (0,7), action U, to y_10=8\n\nt=10: position (0,8), action U, to y_11=9\n\nt=11: position (0,9)\n\nSame number of actions: from t=5 to t=10, 6 actions, but I used D and then U, so net same as S but moved down and up, inefficient.\n\nWorse than staying.\n\nAt t=5, I could go S, then at t=6 go directly to y=7? But at t=6, if I go U from y=5 to y=6 at t=7, but to go to y=7, I need to go U twice, but actions per turn.\n\nAt t=6, I can only do one action: U, D, or S.\n\nFrom y=5, if I do U, go to y=6 at next turn.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nSo to go to y=7, it takes two U actions from y=5.\n\nBut at t=6, if I am at y=5, and I do U, to y=6 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I can do U to y=7 at t=8, but at t=8, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nUnless I go at a different time.\n\nIs there a time when y=7 is safe earlier?\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nSo at t=9, it is safe, as we had.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 is unsafe only at t=6, safe at t=7 and later, except for other constraints.\n\nBut in this case, no other issues until later times.\n\nNow, back to minimal H.\n\nThe direct path: to go up in 4 turns, but need to avoid t=6 for y=6 and t=8 for y=7? t=8 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nThe unsafe times:\n\ny=6: unsafe only at t=6 (from freeway 6)\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=6,7,8 (from freeway 7 third car)\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=12,13,14, but t=12 is later, we can be before or after.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nTo go from y=5 to y=9, I need to be at y=6,7,8 at some points.\n\nI can be at y=6 at times other than t=6.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, avoid t=6,7,8.\n\nEarliest I can be at y=6 is t=7, as we did.\n\nThen at y=7, I can be at t=9 or later.\n\nt=9 is ok.\n\nThen y=8 at t=10 or later.\n\ny=9 at t=11.\n\nSo sequence: start t=5, y=5.\n\nThen go to y=6 at t=7: so actions: at t=5, S (or something), to be at y=5 t=6, then U to y=6 at t=7.\n\nThen from y=6 at t=7, to go to y=7, but if I go U at t=7, to y=7 at t=8, but t=8 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo I must wait at y=6 for t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, U to y=7 at t=9.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=10, U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAs before.\n\nCan I go directly from y=5 to y=7 faster?\n\nFor example, at t=5, if I go U, but cannot because t=6 y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf I go S at t=5, to y=5 t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, if I go U to y=6 at t=7.\n\nBut to go to y=7, I need another action.\n\nNo way to skip.\n\nUnless I go down, but that takes more time.\n\nSo I think 6 turns is the minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=8, y=7 is indeed unsafe.\n\nt=8, freeway 7, third car: at Δt=3, T=8, span [-15 + 4*3, -4 + 4*3] = [-15+12, -4+12] = [-3,8], which includes 0, so yes, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, Δt=4, [-15+16, -4+16]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nNow, what about y=8? We have it at t=10, which is before t=12, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no other constraints.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=10, we go to y=8, then t=11 to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is reached at t=11.\n\nNow, the actions: from t=5 to t=10, 6 actions.\n\nBut the turn we reach y=9 is t=11, after action at t=10.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nSet t_1 = 5.\n\nActions: a_5, a_6, ..., up to a_{5 + H - 1}\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is after last action.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}, position y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe position after H actions should be at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the turn when we are at (0,9) is turn T, and y_T =9.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, which is after the action at T-1.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, before any action, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we are at position y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1 +1.\n\nGenerally, at turn t, position y_t, then action a_t, then at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to have y_T =9 at some turn T.\n\nThen, we start at t_1 with y_{t_1}=5.\n\nWe apply actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{T-1} such that after a_{T-1}, y_T =9.\n\nThe number of actions is from t_1 to T-1, which is (T - t_1) actions.\n\nSet H as the number of turns for actions.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 + 0 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nThen after these H actions, at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nBecause after last action a_{t_1 + H -1}, position is at t_1 + H.\n\nAnd we reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"? Let's see.\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nInconsistency.\n\nLook: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nNow, the index: with t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1 + H -1}, the position is y_{t_1 + H}, I think.\n\nBut it says y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1}, and after action a_{t_1 + H -1}, we go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut the condition is that at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means we reach the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAnd we apply actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -2? Messy.\n\nSet k = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen at turn k, y_k =9.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1}=5.\n\nWe need to go from turn t_1 to turn k, with y_k=9.\n\nThe number of actions is from turn t_1 to turn k-1, since at each turn from t_1 to k-1, we apply an action to change to next position.\n\nThe turns when actions are applied: turns t_1 to k-1.\n\nNumber of actions: (k - t_1)\n\nSince we reach at turn k, and k = t_1 + H -1, so H-1 = k - t_1, so number of actions is H-1.\n\nBut H is called \"minimal number of turns\", but it's confusing.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so H actions.\n\nThen after these, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H} =9? But the problem says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in indexing.\n\nAssume t_1 is fixed.\n\nWe are at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nWe apply actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2, ..., up to some turn.\n\nAfter applying action at turn T, we have position at turn T+1.\n\nWe want for some T, y_{T} =9, where T >= t_1.\n\nThe turn when we reach is T.\n\nThe actions applied are from turn t_1 to turn T-1, so number of actions is (T - t_1).\n\nThen, in the sequence, the actions are a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{T-1}.\n\nThe number of actions is N = T - t_1.\n\nThen the sequence is for t=0 to N-1, a_{t_1 + t}, and y_{t_1 + N} = y_T =9.\n\nBut the problem says: y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 = T, so H -1 = T - t_1, so H = (T - t_1) + 1.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to reach, including the start or not.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's use the example.\n\nIn our case, we reach at t=11, y=9.\n\nt_1=5, so T=11.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=5 to t=10, 6 actions.\n\nT - t_1 = 11-5=6.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + (T - t_1)} = y_T =9.\n\nNow, the sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, with H such that y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nProblem: y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet k = t_1 + H -1, so y_k=9.\n\nThen H-1 = k - t_1.\n\nNumber of actions is k - t_1 = H-1.\n\nFor example, k=11, t_1=5, H-1=6, so H=7.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to H-1=6, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 +6}, but t_1+6=11, but actions at turns, position at turns.\n\nAt turn k=11, y=9.\n\nActions applied at turns t=5 to t=10, which are 6 actions, at times t_1 to t_1+5.\n\nThen in the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}, so for t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} should be 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor this to be 9, and actions applied from t_1 to t_1 + H -2? Let's see.\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1 + H -2}, position at t_1 + H -1.\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is applied at turn t_1 + H -1, to go to position at t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at t_1 + H -1 to be 9, so we don't need action at t_1 + H -1 if we are already at 9.\n\nI think it's inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the actions are to be applied until we reach.\n\nStandard way: we start at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nThen we apply actions a_t for t = t_1, t_1+1, ..., until we reach.\n\nThe turn when we reach y_T=9 for some T.\n\nThe actions applied are for t = t_1 to T-1.\n\nNumber of actions: T - t_1.\n\nThen in the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so H actions, from t=0 to H-1, so t_1 +0 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen after these H actions, position at turn (t_1 + H).\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo it wants the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nThat means we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen the actions applied are from t_1 to (t_1 + H -1) -1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}, which includes up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, but if we reach at turn t_1 + H -1, we don't apply action at that turn.\n\nI think there is a mismatch.\n\nTo resolve, in the context, since we start at t_1, and we need to specify actions to move, but if we are already at goal, no action, but here we are not.\n\nIn this case, at t_1=5, y=5, not 9, so we need actions.\n\nAssume that we apply actions until we reach.\n\nBut the problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn T, then T = t_1 + H -1, so H-1 = T - t_1, so H = (T - t_1) +1.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to reach, inclusive or something.\n\nNumber of actions is T - t_1.\n\nBut H is called \"minimal number of turns\", so perhaps H includes the starting turn or not.\n\nLet's not worry and just use the position.\n\nIn our sequence, we reach at t=11.\n\nt_1=5, so T=11.\n\nThen y_{11} =9.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1, so 11 = 5 + H -1, so 11 = 4 + H, thus H=7.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 6, a_{5} to a_{11}, but a_{11} would be at turn 11, but at turn 11 we are already at y=9, so no action needed.\n\nThe sequence should be a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} for H-1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1 for a_{t_1 + t}, so for H=7, t from 0 to 6, a_{5} to a_{11}, but a_{11} is at turn 11, which is after we are at y=9 at turn 11.\n\nSo that action a_{11} would change from y=9, but we are already at goal.\n\nI think it's a confusion in the problem statement.\n\nPerhaps \"turns\" refer to action turns.\n\nI think for practical purposes, in this case, with 6 actions we reach at t=11.\n\nIn the answer format, we list the actions from t_1 onwards until the last action before reaching.\n\nBut the problem says to output the sequence for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nTo avoid, let's compute H.\n\nIn our path, from t=5 to t=10, 6 actions, reach at t=11.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{5 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 5 + H -1 =11, so 4 + H =11? 5 + H -1 =11, so H -1 =6, H=7.\n\nThen for H=7, y_{5+7-1}=y_{11}=9.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to 6 for a_{5+t}, so a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11? But a_11 at turn 11, not needed.\n\nThe sequence should have H actions, but the last action is applied at turn t_1 + H -1, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, position, but we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nIf y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, then at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at 9, so we don't apply action at that turn. So the actions are from t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nBut the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}, which would include a_{t_1 + H -1} if t=H-1.\n\nBut if we are at 9 at turn t_1 + H -1, we don't need to apply action.\n\nSo for the sequence, when we reach, we stop actions.\n\nBut in the indexing, for H, it might include the starting point.\n\nTo simplify, let's list the actions as per our path.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 6.\n\nFor the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{5} for t from 0 to 5, H-1=5, so H=6.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{5+6-1} = y_{10} =? In our case, at turn 10, position is y=8, not 9.\n\nAfter action at turn 10, U, to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nSo at turn 10, y=8.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need to be at 9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn our case, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 =11, t_1=5, so 5 + H -1=11, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen for H=7, y_{5+7-1}=y_{11}=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to 6: a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11.\n\nBut at turn 11, if we are at y=9, we don't apply action, or if we do, it might move away.\n\nThe action at turn t_1 + H -1 =11 is not needed.\n\nPerhaps the sequence should be only until we reach.\n\nBut the problem specifies the sequence for t=0 to H-1.\n\nI think for this problem, since we need to output the actions, we can list the actions from t_1 to the turn before reaching.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps in this context, \"turns\" means action turns.\n\nI think I should proceed with the sequence.\n\nIn our path, with 6 actions, we reach.\n\nAnd in the sequence, we have 6 actions: a5 to a10.\n\nThen for the output, H=6, and actions from t=0 to 5: a5 to a10.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H} = y_{5+6} = y_{11} =9, but the problem wants y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{11} vs y_{10}, in this case y_{10}=8, not 9.\n\nSo mismatch.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need to be at 9 at that turn.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn T, then T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nActions applied from t_1 to T-1 = t_1 to (t_1 + H -1) -1 = t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nNumber of actions: (H-1).\n\nThen the sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} has H actions, but we only apply H-1 actions.\n\nI think it's a problem in the problem statement.\n\nPerhaps for this, we can assume that when we reach, we stop, but the sequence length is variable.\n\nBut the format specifies fixed H.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the actions include the action to stay or something, but let's look for a different path where we reach earlier.\n\nCan we reach before t=11?\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=5.\n\nIf I could be at y=6 at t=7.\n\nThen at y=7 at t=9.\n\nBut from y=6 to y=7, it takes one action, at turn 7 to go to y=7 at t=8, but t=8 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo must wait.\n\nIf at t=7, I am at y=6, and I go U to y=7 at t=8, collision.\n\nSo I have to wait at y=6 for t=8, then at t=8 go U to y=7 at t=9.\n\nNo earlier.\n\nAt t=5, go S to y=5 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, instead of U, go S to y=5 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, go U to y=6 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, go U to y=7 at t=9, safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=10, U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSame as before, but I waited at y=5 for two turns, so slower: actions: t=5 S, t=6 S, t=7 U, t=8 U, t=9 U, t=10 U, reach at t=11, but 7 actions? t=5 to t=10 actions, 6 actions, reach t=11.\n\nt=5 S, t=6 S, t=7 U, t=8 U, t=9 U, t=10 U, same number, but I have an extra S at t=6, so it takes longer to start moving.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the first path is better.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 directly or something, but no.\n\nAnother point: at t=6, y=6 unsafe, but y=7 also unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nBut y=8 at t=6: freeway 8, at Δt=1, T=6, span [-39+4, -28+4]=[-35,-24], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4, etc.\n\nBut from y=5, to go to y=8, I need three U actions.\n\nFor example, at t=5, if I could go U, but cannot to y=6 at t=6 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=5, S, to y=5 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, go U to y=6 at t=7, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, if I go U to y=7 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nBut if I go U at t=7, to y=7 at t=8, collision.\n\nNo way to skip y=7.\n\nUnless I go down, but that takes more time.\n\nSo I think 6 actions to reach at t=11 is minimal.\n\nH=6 for actions, but for the position, let's accept the sequence.\n\nIn the output, for the answer, I'll list the actions from turn 5 to turn 10.\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nBut for the box, I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps H is 6.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{5+6-1}=y_{10}, which is 8, not 9, but we want 9.\n\nProblem.\n\nUnless in the sequence, the last action brings us to 9 at the next turn.\n\nBut the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is before the last action or after.\n\nI think I should just provide the sequence as per the first way.\n\nPerhaps for this case, since we start at 5, and need to be at 9, with actions.\n\nLet's list the turns and positions.\n\nTurn 5: position y=5, action a5\n\nAfter a5, position at turn 6: y6\n\nTurn 6: position y6, action a6, position at turn 7: y7\n\n...\n\nWe want for some turn K, yK =9.\n\nThen actions a5 to a_{K-1}.\n\nNumber of actions: K-5.\n\nThen in sequence, for t=0 to M-1, a_{5+t}, with M=K-5 actions.\n\nThen y_{5+M} = y_K =9.\n\nBut the problem wants y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 with H the number.\n\nSet t_1 + H -1 = K, so H-1 = K - t_1, H = K - t_1 +1.\n\nFor K=11, t_1=5, H=7.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 6: a5 to a10, but a10 is at turn 10, to go to y11=9.\n\nThen at turn 11, position y11=9, but the action a10 is included.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{5+7-1} =y11=9, correct.\n\nAnd the sequence has H=7 actions: a5 to a11? t from 0 to 6, a_{5+0} to a_{5+6} = a5 to a11.\n\na11 at turn 11, but at turn 11 we are at y=9, and if we apply action, it might move, but in this case, after reaching, we don't care, but for the sequence, we include it, but the action at turn 11 is not necessary.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t=6, a_{11}, which is at turn 11.\n\nBut at turn 11, position is already 9, so action a11 could be S or something, but it's redundant.\n\nIn the collision avoidance, at turn 11, y=9, no issue.\n\nBut for efficiency, we can set a11 to S, but it's extra.\n\nIn our case, with 6 actions, we have a5 to a10.\n\nFor H=7, we need one more action.\n\nBut we can add a S at turn 11, but it's not needed.\n\nI think for the purpose, we'll use the sequence with 6 actions.\n\nAnd in the output, list from turn 5 to turn 10.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nAnd for freeway, at turn 10, y=8, which is safe as before.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t=0 to 5, a5 to a10.\n\nH=6.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H} = y_{11} =9, but the problem wants y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is y_{10}=8, not 9.\n\nSo it doesn't satisfy.\n\nTo satisfy, we can reach at turn 10.\n\nBut can we be at y=9 at turn 10?\n\nFrom y=5 at turn 5, to y=9 at turn 10, that would be 5 actions: for example, U,U,U,U but with waits.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, y=6 unsafe, so cannot be at y=6 at t=6.\n\nEarliest at y=6 is t=7.\n\nThen at y=7 at t=9 (since t=8 unsafe for y=7).\n\nThen at y=8 at t=10.\n\nThen at y=9 at t=11.\n\nCannot be at y=9 at t=10.\n\nIf at t=10, y=9, then at t=9, we must be at y=8 and do U.\n\nBut at t=10, y=9, safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=9.\n\ny=8 at t=9: freeway 8, Δt=4, T=9, span [-39+16, -28+16]=[-23,-12], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=9, we need to come from y=7 at t=8 or y=9, but from below.\n\nAt t=8, if we are at y=7, but at t=8, y=7 unsafe, so cannot be at y=7 at t=8.\n\nSo must be at y=8 at t=9 from y=7 at t=8, but t=8 y=7 unsafe, so impossible to be at y=7 at t=8.\n\nThus, cannot be at y=8 at t=9, because to get there, at t=8 we must be at y=7 or y=8 or y=9, but y=9 not yet, y=8 at t=8: let's check.\n\nAt t=8, y=8: freeway 8, Δt=3, T=8, span [-39+12, -28+12]=[-27,-16], no 0, safe.\n\nSo at t=8, y=8 is safe.\n\nThen from y=8 at t=8, do U to y=9 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=9, safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=8.\n\nHow to get to y=8 at t=8.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=5.\n\nPath: for example, at t=5, S to y=5 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, U to y=6 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, U to y=7 at t=8, but at t=8, y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt t=5, U to y=6 at t=6, but t=6 y=6 unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot start with U.\n\nAt t=5, D to y=4 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, U to y=5 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, U to y=6 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, U to y=7 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, y=7 safe, as before.\n\nThen at t=9, U to y=8 at t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=8.\n\nFrom t=5, y=5.\n\nIf I go U at t=5 to y=6 at t=6, collision.\n\nGo S to y=5 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, go U to y=6 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, go U to y=7 at t=8, collision.\n\nGo S at t=6 to y=5 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, U to y=6 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, U to y=7 at t=9.\n\nNot to y=8.\n\nTo reach y=8 faster, I need more U actions.\n\nFor example, at t=5, if I could do U, but cannot.\n\nNo, so I think it's impossible to reach before t=11.\n\nThus, the minimal is to reach at t=11 with 6 actions.\n\nFor the answer, I'll use H=6, and actions from t=0 to 5: a5 to a10.\n\nThen for the position, y_{11}=9, but the problem wants y_{10}=9, which is not possible, so perhaps accept y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nI think for this, I'll proceed.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nWith H=6.\n\nBut in the format, for the box.\n\nPerhaps list the actions.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there a way with H smaller?\n\nH=5 actions.\n\nThen with 5 actions, from t=5 to t=9, positions from y6 to y10.\n\nWe want y10=9.\n\nSo from y5=5 to y10=9 in 5 actions, so net +4, so must be 4 U and 1 S or something.\n\nBut we need to be at certain positions.\n\nFor example, actions: suppose at t=5: U, but to y6 at t=6, but y6 at t=6 collision, impossible.\n\nAt t=5: S, to y6=5 at t=6.\n\nThen t=6: U, to y7=6 at t=7.\n\nt=7: U, to y8=7 at t=8, but at t=8, y8=7, but position at turn 8 is y8, on freeway 7, which is unsafe at t=8, collision.\n\nIf t=7: S, to y8=6 at t=8.\n\nThen t=8: U, to y9=7 at t=9.\n\nt=9: U, to y10=8 at t=10.\n\nThen y10=8, not 9.\n\nThen need another action to go to 9.\n\nIf at t=9: U, to y10=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y10=9, at t=9, we must be at y9=8 and do U.\n\nBut y9=8 at t=9.\n\nHow to be at y8 at t=9.\n\nAs before, difficult.\n\nAt t=8, be at y8=8, do U to y9=9 at t=9.\n\nBut to be at y8=8 at t=8.\n\nFrom y5=5 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5: S, to y6=5 at t=6.\n\nt=6: U, to y7=6 at t=7.\n\nt=7: U, to y8=7 at t=8, collision at t=8 on y7.\n\nCannot.\n\nt=5: U, impossible.\n\nt=5: D, to y6=4 at t=6.\n\nt=6: U, to y7=5 at t=7.\n\nt=7: U, to y8=6 at t=8.\n\nt=8: U, to y9=7 at t=9.\n\nt=9: U, to y10=8 at t=10, not 9.\n\nStill not.\n\nTo go faster, but blocked.\n\nSo impossible to reach before t=11.\n\nThus minimal H=6 actions.\n\nFor the

a_{t_1 +5} = U\n\nWith t_1=5.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut to write.\n\nSince t_1 is given, we use relative.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for this case.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn t_1+2=7, we have S, which is stay.\n\nAnd we reach at turn 11.\n\nNow, I think it's fine.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H is 6.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut in the output, since t_1=5, we write:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 5: S \\\\ Turn 6: U \\\\ Turn 7: S \\\\ Turn 8: U \\\\ Turn 9: U \\\\ Turn 10: U }\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nBut H is to be determined.\n\nIn the box, probably just the sequence with turns.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nBut in the answer format, it shows the sequence with turns, so H is implied or something.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 6. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) based on the given car states and update rules.\n\n### Collision Analysis Summary:\n- **Freeway 6**: Collision at turn \\(T = 6\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta t = 1\\)).\n- **Freeway 7**: Collisions at turns \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\) (from the third car).\n- Other freeways have collisions at later turns (e.g., \\(T = 12-14\\) for freeways 1, 2, 8; \\(T = 16-18\\) for freeways 3, 4, 5, 7), which do not affect the minimal path since the goal is reached earlier.\n\n### Path to Reach \\((0, 9)\\):\n- Start at turn 5, position \\((0, 5)\\).\n- Action at turn 5: Stay (S), moving to position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 6. This avoids being on freeway 6 at turn 6 (collision time).\n- Action at turn 6: Up (U), moving to position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 7. Freeway 6 is safe at turn 7 (\\(\\Delta t = 2\\), span \\([-60, -25]\\), 0 not in span).\n- Action at turn 7: Stay (S), moving to position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 8. This avoids being on freeway 7 at turn 8 (collision time for \\(y = 7\\)).\n- Action at turn 8: Up (U), moving to position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 9. Freeway 7 is safe at turn 9 (\\(\\Delta t = 4\\), span \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in span).\n- Action at turn 9: Up (U), moving to position \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 10. Freeway 8 is safe at turn 10 (\\(\\Delta t = 5\\), span \\([-19, -8]\\), 0 not in span).\n- Action at turn 10: Up (U), moving to position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 11. Position \\((0, 9)\\) is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nThis sequence uses 6 actions (turns 5 to 10) and reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 11. It is minimal because:\n- Moving up immediately at turn 5 causes a collision at turn 6 on freeway 6.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 7 or 8 causes a collision on freeway 7 at turn 8.\n- No shorter path exists that avoids all collisions and reaches \\(y = 9\\) by turn 10 or earlier.\n\n### Answer:\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 6\\). The sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right at their speeds, and a collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportant point: if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn, so at turn T, I'm still on the previous y for collision purposes. Let me read that again.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThe way it's phrased is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.\n\nAt turn T, when I take action a_T, that determines y_{T+1}. So at the beginning of turn T, I am at y_T. I take action a_T, and then at the beginning of turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision condition is: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, so at the time of turn T, I am on y_T, and I check if 0 is in the car span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf I move to a different y at turn T, meaning I take an action that changes y, so y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, but at turn T, I am still on y_T, so the collision check is for y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't care about cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at turn T+1 and later.\n\nBut for the current turn T, you care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nAlso, the car spans are given at turn t_1=6, and for future turns, we compute based on the movement.\n\nt_1 is the current turn, which is 6.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,5) at turn 6.\n\nI need to reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H, the number of turns, including turn t_1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, where t is relative to t_1? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, meaning actions at time t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, the position is y_{t_1 + H}, and we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? Let's see.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so after action at time t, position is updated to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at time t_1 with position given, y_{t_1} = 5.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen a_{t_1 +1} determines y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, up to a_{t_1 + H -1} which determines y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd we need to minimize H, the number of actions.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions, and after H actions, at time t_1 + H, we are at position 9.\n\nThe time at which we reach position 9 is t_1 + H.\n\nWe need to find min H and the actions.\n\nNow, the grid has freeways y=1 to 8, each with cars moving left or right at constant speed.\n\nCars are given at turn t_1=6 with their positions (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor future turns, we compute the span based on the movement.\n\nLeft-moving cars: span [h, τ] moves left, so at time T, span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving cars: span [τ, h] moves right, so [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, it's given as (h, τ, left, s), and for right-moving, (h, τ, right, s), but in the span, for left, it's [h, τ] with h and τ, and it moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nDirection is right, so it's moving right, so the span at t_1=6 is given as (head, tail) = (-24, -35)? But for right-moving, it says span is [τ, h], so tail to head, with τ < h since moving right.\n\nLet's check the car update rules.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nSo head h = -24, tail τ = -35\n\nSince direction right, span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at t_1=6.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 6: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11] at t_1=6.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, I assume, since player is at (0, y).\n\nSo for each freeway, we need to know when a car covers x=0.\n\nSince the cars are moving, we can find for each freeway, the times when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nThen, when the player is on that freeway at that time, collision.\n\nBut the player moves vertically, so we need to plan the path to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their car hazards.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny=1: one car, (-24, -35, right, 4), so at t=6, span [-35, -24]\n\nSince moving right at speed 4, the span at time T is [-35 + 4(T-6), -24 + 4(T-6)]\n\nx=0 is covered when -35 + 4(T-6) <= 0 <= -24 + 4(T-6)\n\nSet L(T) = -35 + 4(T-6)\n\nU(T) = -24 + 4(T-6)\n\n0 in [L(T), U(T)] if L(T) <= 0 <= U(T)\n\nL(T) <= 0: -35 + 4(T-6) <= 0 => 4(T-6) <= 35 => T-6 <= 35/4 = 8.75, so T <= 14.75\n\nSince T integer, T <= 14\n\nU(T) >= 0: -24 + 4(T-6) >=0 => 4(T-6) >=24 => T-6 >=6 => T >=12\n\nSo 0 covered for T from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nT=12,13,14.\n\nT=12: L= -35 +4(6) = -35+24= -11 <=0, U= -24+24=0 >=0, so yes, 0 in [-11,0]? L(T)= -35+4(T-6)\n\nT=12: L= -35 +4(6) = -35+24= -11, U= -24+24=0, so span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=13: L= -35+4(7)= -35+28= -7, U= -24+28=4, span [-7,4], 0 in\n\nT=14: L= -35+4(8)= -35+32= -3, U= -24+32=8, span [-3,8], 0 in\n\nT=15: L= -35+4(9)= -35+36=1, U= -24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, since 0<1\n\nSo for y=1, hazard at T=12,13,14.\n\nBut T is absolute turn, starting from t_1=6.\n\nNow freeway y=2: same as y=1, (-24, -35, right, 4), so same hazard at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway y=3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-40, -51, right, 4) so at t=6, span [τ, h] = [-51, -40] since right? head h=-40, tail τ=-51, direction right, so span [τ, h] = [-51, -40]\n\nMoving right at 4, span at T: [-51 +4(T-6), -40 +4(T-6)]\n\n0 in when L(T) <=0 <= U(T)\n\nL(T) <=0: -51+4(T-6) <=0 => 4(T-6) <=51 => T-6 <=12.75, T<=18.75, T<=18\n\nU(T) >=0: -40+4(T-6) >=0 => 4(T-6) >=40 => T-6 >=10, T>=16\n\nSo T=16,17,18\n\nT=16: L= -51+4(10)= -51+40= -11 <=0, U= -40+40=0 >=0, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=17: L= -51+4(11)= -51+44= -7, U= -40+44=4, span [-7,4], 0 in\n\nT=18: L= -51+4(12)= -51+48= -3, U= -40+48=8, span [-3,8], 0 in\n\nT=19: L= -51+4(13)= -51+52=1, U= -40+52=12, span [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car on y=3: (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nHead h=24, tail τ=13, direction right, so span [τ, h] = [13,24] at t=6\n\nMoving right at 4, span at T: [13 +4(T-6), 24 +4(T-6)]\n\n0 in when 13 +4(T-6) <=0 <=24 +4(T-6)\n\nBut 13 +4(T-6) >=13 >0 for T>=6, so lower bound >=13>0, so 0 <= lower bound is false, so 0 never in [lower, upper] since lower >=13>0. So this car never covers x=0. It starts at 13 and moves right, so x=0 is always left of it. So no hazard from this car.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nSo for y=3, only hazard from first car at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway y=4: same as y=3, two cars: (-40,-51,right,4) and (24,13,right,4)\n\nFirst car same as above, hazard T=16,17,18\n\nSecond car (24,13,right,4), same, never covers 0.\n\nSo hazard only T=16,17,18.\n\ny=5: same, (-40,-51,right,4) and (24,13,right,4), hazard T=16,17,18 from first car.\n\ny=6: one car, (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so span [h, τ] = [-24, 11] at t=6? Head h=-24, tail τ=11, direction left, so span [h, τ] = [-24, 11], since moving left, positions decrease.\n\nAt time T, span [ -24 -36(T-6) , 11 -36(T-6) ]\n\nMoving left at speed 36, so positions decrease.\n\nx=0 covered when -24 -36(T-6) <= 0 <= 11 -36(T-6)\n\nSet L(T) = -24 -36(T-6)\n\nU(T) = 11 -36(T-6)\n\n0 in [L(T), U(T)] if L(T) <= 0 <= U(T)\n\nFirst, U(T) >=0: 11 -36(T-6) >=0 => 11 >=36(T-6) => T-6 <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so T-6 <=0 since T integer, so T<=6\n\nL(T) <=0: -24 -36(T-6) <=0 => -24 <=36(T-6) => since 36(T-6) >=0 for T>=6, this is true for T>=6.\n\nBut U(T) >=0 only for T<=6.\n\nAt T=6, U(T)=11 -36(0)=11 >=0, L(T)= -24 <=0, so 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nFor T>6, U(T) =11 -36(T-6) <11 -0=11, but decreasing, T=7: U=11-36= -25 <0, L= -24 -36= -60 <=0, but 0 <= U(T)= -25? 0 <= -25 false, so 0 not in [L,U] since U<0 and L<0.\n\nSimilarly, for T<6, but we start at T=6, so only at T=6, hazard for y=6.\n\nT=6: U=11>=0, L=-24<=0, so yes.\n\nFor T>6, U(T) decreases, so U(T) <0 for T>=7, so 0 > U(T), not in span.\n\nSo for y=6, hazard only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway y=7: three cars.\n\nFirst: (-40, -51, right, 4) same as before, hazard at T=16,17,18? Let's compute.\n\nCar: (-40, -51, right, 4), span at T: [-51 +4(T-6), -40 +4(T-6)]\n\n0 covered T=16,17,18 as before.\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 4) head h=36, tail τ=25, direction right, span [τ, h] = [25,36] at t=6\n\nMoving right, span at T: [25 +4(T-6), 36 +4(T-6)]\n\n25 +4(T-6) >=25>0, so never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (0, -11, right, 4) head h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, span [-11,0], so x=0 is covered, since 0 is included.\n\nNow at time T, span [ -11 +4(T-6), 0 +4(T-6) ] = [ -11 +4(T-6), 4(T-6) ]\n\n0 in this span when L(T) <=0 <= U(T)\n\nL(T) = -11 +4(T-6) <=0: -11 +4(T-6) <=0 => 4(T-6) <=11 => T-6 <=11/4=2.75, T<=8.75, so T<=8\n\nU(T) = 4(T-6) >=0, always true for T>=6.\n\nSo for T=6: L= -11 <=0, U=0 >=0, 0 in\n\nT=7: L= -11+4= -7 <=0, U=4 >=0, 0 in\n\nT=8: L= -11+8= -3 <=0, U=8 >=0, 0 in? U=4*(2)=8 for T-6=2, yes.\n\nT=9: L= -11+12=1 >0, U=12>0, 0 not in since L>0.\n\nSo hazard for this car at T=6,7,8.\n\nBut y=7 has multiple cars, so if any car covers 0, it's hazard.\n\nFirst car: hazard at T=16,17,18\n\nSecond car: never\n\nThird car: hazard at T=6,7,8\n\nSo for y=7, hazard when either third car or first car covers 0, so T=6,7,8 and T=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway y=8: (-24, -35, right, 4) same as y=1, hazard at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow, also freeway y=0 and y=9, but player starts at y=5, ends at y=9. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars. The vertical axis y=0 to 9, but cars only on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nCollision only on y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, player starts at t=6, y=5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is safe.\n\nThe minimal H: since we start at y=5, need to go up to y=9, so at least 4 up moves, but we can stay or go down, but to minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nThe freeways between y=5 and y=9 are y=6,7,8.\n\ny=5 to y=9, we need to pass through y=6,7,8 or go directly, but since we move one step at a time, we have to be on each y at some point.\n\nWe can be on y=5, then move to y=6, then to y=7, etc., or stay, or even go down, but that would take more turns, so for minimal H, we should avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nSince we start at y=5 and end at y=9, we need to increase y by 4, so minimal actions: if we do U every turn, we reach in 4 turns: after 4 actions, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check if we can do that without collision.\n\nNow, at which turns are we on which y.\n\nStart at t=6, y=5.\n\nTake action a_{t} at time t, determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at time t, we are at y_t.\n\nFor collision at time t, we are on y_t, and check if 0 covered on y_t at time t.\n\nWe need to ensure that for each time t, when we are on y_t, which is between 1 and 8, it is not a hazard time for that freeway.\n\ny_t could be 0 or 9, safe.\n\nNow, let's list the hazard times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: hazard at t=12,13,14\n\ny=2: same, t=12,13,14\n\ny=3: hazard at t=16,17,18\n\ny=4: same, t=16,17,18\n\ny=5: hazard at t=16,17,18 (from the first car, as above)\n\ny=6: hazard only at t=6\n\ny=7: hazard at t=6,7,8 (from third car) and t=16,17,18 (from first car)\n\ny=8: hazard at t=12,13,14\n\nAlso, for y=6, hazard only at t=6.\n\nNow, player starts at t=6, y=5.\n\nAt t=6, we are on y=5.\n\nIs y=5 hazardous at t=6? y=5 has hazard only at t=16,17,18, not at t=6. So at t=6, on y=5, safe.\n\nNow, we want to go up.\n\nSuppose we take action at t=6: U, then y_{7} =6\n\nBut at time t=7, we are on y=6? Let's see.\n\nAt time t=6, position y=5.\n\nTake action a_6: if U, then y_{7} =6.\n\nNow, at time t=7, we are at y=7? No.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if on y_t and hazard on y_t at time t.\n\nAt turn t=6: we are at y_6=5, which is safe as above.\n\nAfter action a_6, we go to y_7.\n\nIf we go to y_7 at time t=7.\n\nAt turn t=7, we are at y_7.\n\nIf we took U at t=6, y_7=6.\n\nThen at turn t=7, we are on y=6.\n\ny=6 has hazard only at t=6, not at t=7. So at t=7, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen we can take U again at t=7, to y_8=7.\n\nAt turn t=8, we are on y=7.\n\ny=7 has hazard at t=6,7,8 from the third car.\n\nt=8 is hazardous for y=7.\n\nAt t=8, if we are on y=7, and hazard, collision.\n\nIf we take U at t=7, y_8=7, so at t=8, on y=7, which is hazardous, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nWe could stay or something.\n\nSince we start at t=6, y=5, safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nOne way: go up to y=6 at some point.\n\nBut y=6 is hazardous only at t=6, so for t>6, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 hazardous at t=6,7,8 and t=16,17,18.\n\nSince we are at t=6, we care about early times.\n\nt=16 is far, so for now, t=6,7,8 are critical.\n\nWe are at y=5 at t=6, safe.\n\nIf we take action S at t=6, then y_7=5, still on y=5 at t=7? At turn t=7, we are at y_7.\n\nIf a_6=S, y_7=5, so at t=7, on y=5, which is safe, since hazard only at t=16-18.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, if still on y=5, safe.\n\nBut we need to move up eventually.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 at t=8, since hazard.\n\nt=8 is hazard for y=7.\n\nAlso, at t=7, y=7 is hazard? y=7 hazard at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=6,7,8 all hazardous for y=7.\n\nAt t=6, we are on y=5, not y=7.\n\nIf we go to y=7 at some point, we need to avoid times t=6,7,8 and t=16,17,18.\n\nSince t=16 is later, we can ignore for now if we go early.\n\nBut we start at t=6.\n\nAnother idea: go down first? But y=4 and below might have hazards, but y=4 hazard at t=16,17,18, late.\n\ny=3 same, y=2 same as y=1, hazard at t=12,13,14.\n\nBut going down might delay, not good for min time.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, we can go U,U,U,U in 4 turns: from t=6 to t=10, y=9.\n\nBut with cars, we need to avoid.\n\nLet's list the positions over time.\n\nTime t | y_t (after action, but y_t is position at time t)\n\nDefine: at time t, position y_t.\n\nt=6: y_6=5\n\nWe take action a_t at time t, to set y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at time t if y_t in 1-8 and hazard on y_t at t.\n\nWe want y_t for t=6,7,8,... until we reach y=9 at some t.\n\ny_{t} =9 at some t, and we stop when we first reach, I assume.\n\nSince we can stay, but for min H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nThe time to reach y=9.\n\nStart at t=6, y=5.\n\nAfter k up moves, y=5+k.\n\nSet 5+k=9, k=4, so at least t=10, y_10=9 if we do U at t=6,7,8,9.\n\ny_{10}=9.\n\nt=6: y=5\n\na6: U, y7=6\n\na7: U, y8=7\n\na8: U, y9=8\n\na9: U, y10=9\n\nNow, check collision:\n\nAt t=6: y=5, which is safe (hazard only at t=16-18)\n\nAt t=7: y=6, which is safe (hazard only at t=6)\n\nAt t=8: y=7, which is hazardous at t=8 (since y=7 hazard t=6,7,8)\n\nCollision at t=8.\n\nNot good.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at t=8.\n\nPerhaps stay at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=6, instead of U, we stay: a6=S, then y7=5\n\nAt t=7: y=5, safe\n\nThen a7: U, to y8=6\n\nAt t=8: y=6, safe (since y=6 hazard only t=6)\n\nThen a8: U, to y9=7\n\nAt t=9: y=7\n\nNow, y=7 hazard at t=6,7,8 and t=16,17,18.\n\nt=9 is not hazardous? Earlier for y=7, from third car, hazard t=6,7,8; from first car t=16,17,18.\n\nSo at t=9, no hazard, safe.\n\nThen a9: U, to y10=8\n\nAt t=10: y=8\n\ny=8 hazard at t=12,13,14, not at t=10, safe.\n\nThen a10: U, to y11=9\n\nAt t=11: y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nBut we reached at t=11, y=9.\n\ny_{11}=9.\n\nH = number of actions: from t=6 to t=10, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10? Let's see.\n\nStart at t=6, position.\n\nAfter action at t=6, y7\n\nAfter action at t=7, y8\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t=10, y11=9\n\nSo actions at t=6,7,8,9,10, that's 5 actions, H=5, reaching at time t=11.\n\nBut we can do better? Minimal is 4 actions to reach in 4 steps.\n\nBut with 4 actions, we reach at t=10, but in the previous attempt, at t=8 we had problem.\n\nWith actions: suppose we want to be on y=7 not at t=8.\n\ny=7 hazardous at t=6,7,8.\n\nSo we need to be on y=7 at t<=5 or t>=9, but t=6 is start, t=5 is past, not possible. So earliest to be on y=7 is t=9 or later.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 hazardous at t=12,13,14, so we can be on y=8 at t=6 to 11 or t=15+, etc.\n\ny=6 hazardous only at t=6, so we can be on y=6 at t=7 or later.\n\ny=5 safe except t=16,17,18.\n\nWe start at t=6, y=5.\n\nIf we go directly, we need to go through y=6,7,8.\n\nWe can be on y=6 at t=7 or later, safe.\n\nOn y=7 at t=9 or later, safe (since hazard only t=6,7,8 and t=16,17,18)\n\nt=9 to 15 safe for y=7.\n\nOn y=8 at t=6 to11 or t=15+, safe.\n\nNow, to minimize time to reach y=9.\n\nEarliest: at t=6, we can stay or move.\n\nIf we move up to y=6 at t=7, which is safe.\n\nThen from y=6, we can go to y=7 at t=8? But at t=8, if we are on y=7, hazardous.\n\nSo cannot be on y=7 at t=8.\n\nTherefore, from y=6 at t=7, we cannot go to y=7 immediately because then at t=8 we are on y=7 hazardous.\n\nWe need to delay going to y=7 until t=9.\n\nSo at t=7, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nWe can take action: if we take S, then y8=6, so at t=8, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we can take U to y9=7.\n\nAt t=9, we are on y=7, which is safe (since t=9 not hazard).\n\nThen we can take U to y10=8.\n\nAt t=10, on y=8, safe (t=10<12).\n\nThen U to y11=9.\n\nReach at t=11, with actions: t=6:U? Start at t=6 y=5.\n\na6: U, so y7=6\n\nAt t=7, on y=6\n\na7: S, so y8=6 (stay)\n\nAt t=8, on y=6\n\na8: U, so y9=7\n\nAt t=9, on y=7\n\na9: U, so y10=8\n\nAt t=10, on y=8\n\na10: U, so y11=9\n\nReach at t=11.\n\nBut earlier I thought with stay, but now 5 actions.\n\nFrom above, after a6:U, we go to y7=6 at t=7.\n\nThen instead of stay, we could go down? But y=5 is below, not useful.\n\nOr, at t=6, we take S first.\n\na6: S, then y7=5\n\nAt t=7, on y=5\n\na7: U, to y8=6\n\nAt t=8, on y=6\n\na8: U, to y9=7\n\nAt t=9, on y=7\n\na9: U, to y10=8\n\nAt t=10, on y=8\n\na10: U, to y11=9\n\nSame as before, 5 actions, reach t=11.\n\nBut we skipped the stay at y=6, but still 5 actions.\n\nTo reach faster, we need to be on y=7 earlier, but we cannot before t=9.\n\nEarliest to be on y=7 is t=9.\n\nThen on y=8 at t=10, on y=9 at t=11.\n\nSo minimum reach time is t=11 with y=9.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=7 at t=9 with fewer steps?\n\nFrom start: t=6 y=5\n\nIf we go U at t=6, to y7=6 at t=7\n\nThen at t=7, on y=6, we must not go to y=7 because if a7:U, y8=7, at t=8 on y=7 hazardous.\n\nSo we must stay or go down.\n\nIf stay at t=7, a7:S, y8=6, at t=8 on y=6\n\nThen a8:U, y9=7 at t=9\n\nThen proceed.\n\nIf we go down at t=7, a7:D, y8=5, then at t=8 on y=5, then a8:U to y9=6, etc., takes more time.\n\nSo staying is better.\n\nThus, minimal to reach y=7 at t=9.\n\nThen y=8 at t=10, y=9 at t=11.\n\nWith 5 actions: a6 to a10.\n\nH=5.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1 =6: action a6\n\nThen a7, a8, a9, a10.\n\nAfter a10, y11=9.\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nt=6: y=5, safe\n\na6: suppose we do U, then y7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, safe (hazard only t=6)\n\na7: S, then y8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, safe\n\na8: U, then y9=7\n\nt=9: y=7, now check hazard: y=7 at t=9, no hazard (hazard at t=6,7,8 and later), so safe.\n\na9: U, then y10=8\n\nt=10: y=8, hazard at t=12,13,14, not t=10, safe.\n\na10: U, then y11=9\n\nt=11: y=9, safe.\n\nReached at t=11.\n\nWith a6=S, similar, but we start at y=5, if a6=S, y7=5, same position, then later move, same time.\n\nBut doing U at t=6 gets us to y=6 earlier, but we have to wait later, same reach time.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go to y=8 directly or something, but we have to go through y=6 and y=7.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=9 via other paths, but only vertical move.\n\nOr, perhaps at t=6, go down to y=4, but y=4 has hazard at t=16-18, not now, but going down then up takes more turns.\n\nFor example, a6:D, to y7=4, at t=7 on y=4, safe, but y=4 is between 1-8, but hazard only late, so safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up to y=9, which takes 5 up moves, from y=4 to y=9, delta 5, so at least 5 actions, reach at t=11 or later, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to other y, not better.\n\nSo minimal seems to be reach at t=11 with 5 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, actions from t=6 to t=10, 5 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be actions starting from t_1=6.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=5, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10.\n\nAnd the position after last action is y_{11}=9.\n\nNow, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the above, we have a6: U, a7: S, a8: U, a9: U, a10: U\n\na10: U to y11=9.\n\nBut at t=10, we are on y=8, and we take U to go to y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions: turn 6: U, turn 7: S, turn 8: U, turn 9: U, turn 10: U\n\nBut turn 10 is t_1 + 4? t_1=6, so turns: 6,7,8,9,10 which is t_1 to t_1+4.\n\nH=5 actions.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9, and we start at y=5, we must have at least 4 up moves, but here we have 4 up and one stay, so 5 actions.\n\nIs there a sequence with 4 actions? Only if we can avoid the hazard.\n\nFor example, if we go U at t=6 to y7=6\n\nThen at t=7, on y=6, if we go U to y8=7, but at t=8 on y=7 hazardous.\n\nUnless we can be on y=7 at a safe time, but t=8 is not safe.\n\nPerhaps go to y=8 directly, but we have to go to y=7 first.\n\nAnother thought: at t=6, we are at y=5, take U to y7=6 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, take D? to y8=5, then at t=8 on y=5, safe, but then we need to go up again, takes more actions.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 without being on y=7 at critical time, but y=7 must be traversed.\n\nUnless we skip it, but we move one step, so we must be on each y at some point.\n\nFor example, from y=6, we go directly to y=8? No, only to adjacent y.\n\nSo we must be on y=7 at some turn.\n\nAnd the safe times for y=7 are t<=5 or t>=9, but t=5 not possible, so t>=9.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, safe times t<=11 or t>=15, etc.\n\nSo earliest to be on y=7 is t=9, then y=8 at t=10, y=9 at t=11.\n\nThus minimal reach time is t=11.\n\nWith 5 actions.\n\nNow, in the actions, we have one stay.\n\nWe could have different sequence.\n\nFor example, at t=6, take S: a6=S, y7=5\n\nt=7: y=5\n\na7:U, y8=6\n\nt=8: y=6\n\na8:U, y9=7\n\nt=9: y=7\n\na9:U, y10=8\n\nt=10: y=8\n\na10:U, y11=9\n\nSame as before, but a6=S instead of U.\n\nIn this case, at t=6, we are on y=5, take S, stay, so y7=5, then at t=7 still on y=5.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut in terms of time, same.\n\nThe first sequence has us at y=6 from t=7 to t=8, while this has us at y=5 at t=6 and t=7, then y=6 at t=8.\n\nBut reach time same.\n\nNow, we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the output, it should be the actions.\n\nNow, in the first sequence: a6=U, a7=S, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U\n\nIn second: a6=S, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U\n\nBoth work.\n\nBut in the first, we used a stay at t=7, in second at t=6.\n\nSince we start at t=6, and we need to wait until t=9 to be on y=7, we can stay at y=5 or y=6.\n\nBut staying at y=5 might be slightly better because y=5 has no hazard except late, but both safe.\n\nIn terms of the action sequence, both have H=5.\n\nNow, but we need to make sure that at t=9, when we are on y=7, it is safe, which it is.\n\nSimilarly, no other hazards.\n\nBut what about y=8? We are on y=8 at t=10, which is before t=12, safe.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for y=7, there is a car at (0,-11,right,4) which at t=6,7,8 covers x=0, but at t=9, it has moved, span at t=9: for that car, [ -11 +4(9-6), 4(9-6) ] = [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], not cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have to specify the actions.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be for turns starting from t_1=6.\n\nAlso, H=5.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=4.\n\nSuppose we do: a6:U, to y7=6\n\na7:U, to y8=7 → but at t=8, y=7 hazardous, collision.\n\na6:U, a7:D? to y8=5, then at t=8 y=5, safe, but then we need to go up, a8:U to y9=6, a9:U to y10=7, a10:U to y11=8, a11:U to y12=9, reach at t=12, worse.\n\na6:S, a7:U to y8=6, a8:U to y9=7, a9:U to y10=8, a10:U to y11=9, same as before, 5 actions.\n\nNo way with 4 actions.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I think either is fine.\n\nBut in the first sequence with a6:U and a7:S, we have a stay at y=6, which is fine.\n\nTo make it consistent, let's use the sequence with no unnecessary down moves.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 6: U  (to go to y=6)\n\nTurn 7: S  (stay at y=6 to avoid moving to y=7 too early)\n\nTurn 8: U  (to y=7)\n\nTurn 9: U  (to y=8)\n\nTurn 10: U (to y=9)\n\nIn terms of turn: after action at turn 10, y11=9.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions: for turn t_1=6: U, turn 7: S, turn 8: U, turn 9: U, turn 10: U.\n\nBut turn 10 is t_1 +4.\n\nt_1=6, so turns: 6,7,8,9,10.\n\nH=5.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut we need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, is there any other hazard I missed?\n\nFor example, y=6 has only hazard at t=6, which we avoided.\n\ny=7 at t=9 is safe.\n\ny=8 at t=10 is safe.\n\nWhat about when we are on y=5 at t=6, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can reach without the stay, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother idea: since y=9 is safe, and we can go there directly if possible, but we start at y=5.\n\nPerhaps at t=6, go U to y=6 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, go U to y=7 at t=8, but at t=8 collision.\n\nUnless the car doesn't cover, but it does.\n\nPerhaps for y=7, the car at (0,-11,right,4) at t=8, span [ -11+4(2), 4(2) ] = [ -11+8, 8] = [-3,8], covers 0, yes.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sequence with one stay is necessary.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=5.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nThe actions: from turn 6 to turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence: turn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = S\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1 +2} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +3: a_{t_1 +3} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +4: a_{t_1 +4} = U\n\nH=5.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it clearly.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 6 has a car, but we are on it only at t=7 and t=8, both safe.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=9, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=10, safe.\n\ny=9 no freeway.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different sequence, like stay at y=5 first.\n\nBut same H.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player must increase their y-position from 5 to 9, requiring at least 4 \"U\" (up) actions.\n- Freeway \\(y = 7\\) has a hazard at turns 6, 7, and 8 due to the car at (0, -11, right, 4), which covers x=0 during these turns.\n- To avoid collision on \\(y = 7\\), the player must not be on this freeway at turns 6, 7, or 8. The earliest safe turn to be on \\(y = 7\\) is turn 9.\n- Starting at turn 6 on \\(y = 5\\) (safe), the player can move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 7 (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) has a hazard only at turn 6).\n- However, moving directly to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 8 would result in a collision at turn 8. Therefore, the player must stay on \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8 by using an \"S\" (stay) action at turn 7.\n- At turn 8, the player is on \\(y = 6\\) (safe), then moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9 (safe, as turn 9 is not hazardous for \\(y = 7\\)).\n- From there, the player moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10 (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) hazards occur at turns 12–14) and finally to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nThis sequence requires 5 actions (turns 6 to 10) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. No sequence with fewer actions (e.g., 4 actions) is possible without causing a collision on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 8.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 6: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 7, safe)\n- Turn 7: S (stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 8, safe)\n- Turn 8: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9, safe)\n- Turn 9: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10, safe)\n- Turn 10: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, safe)\n\n### Verification:\n- Turn 6: Position \\(y = 5\\), no hazard (hazard only at turns 16–18).\n- Turn 7: Position \\(y = 6\\), no hazard (hazard only at turn 6).\n- Turn 8: Position \\(y = 6\\), no hazard (hazard only at turn 6).\n- Turn 9: Position \\(y = 7\\), no hazard (hazards at turns 6–8 and 16–18; turn 9 safe).\n- Turn 10: Position \\(y = 8\\), no hazard (hazards at turns 12–14; turn 10 safe).\n- Turn 11: Position \\(y = 9\\), no freeway, safe.\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns \\(H = 5\\), and the sequence reaches (0, 9) at turn 11.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} }",

The cars are moving left or right with given speeds, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car's span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nThe player position is updated based on actions: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe goal is y=9, which is above the freeways, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe since there are no cars there.

But I have to check if there are cars on the freeways I might be on when moving.\n\nSince I move one y per turn, when I go from y to y+1, I spend one turn at each y level. For example, to go from y=6 to y=7, I need to be at y=7 for some turn, and so on.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car whose span includes 0.\n\nThe note says: if I move to a different y at turn T, I am not considered on that new y until the next turn. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let me parse this.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nI choose an action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, so I check for collision on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAfter moving, at turn T+1, I am on freeway y_{T+1}, so I check for collision on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note is saying that when I am at turn T and I choose to move to a different y, say from y to y', at that turn T, I am still on y, so I only care about cars on y at turn T. Then at turn T+1, I am on y', so I care about cars on y' at turn T+1.\n\nThe span is defined for each turn, so for each turn, I need to know where I am and what the car spans are on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, for the car spans, they move linearly with time based on their speed and direction.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway, as given.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -20, tail -31, direction right, speed 4.\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at turn t_1=7 is [τ, h] = [-31, -20], because head and tail, for right-moving, head is greater, I think.\n\nLet's see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) = (-20, -31, right, 4)\n\nFor right-moving, at initial turn, span is [τ, h] = [-31, -20]\n\nThen at turn T, span = [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)] = [-31 + 4(T-7), -20 + 4(T-7)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-20, -31, right, 4) so same car configuration.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: first (-36, -47, right, 4) and second (28, 17, right, 4)\n\nFor right-moving, first car: τ = -47, h = -36? Head and tail.\n\nIn the notation, it's (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I assume.\n\nIn freeway 3, first car: head = -36, tail = -47? -36 > -47, yes, since -36 is to the right of -47 on a number line.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=28, tail=17, both right.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t=7: [τ, h] for each.\n\nFirst car: τ=-47, h=-36, so span [ -47, -36 ]\n\nAt T, [ -47 + 4(T-7), -36 + 4(T-7) ]\n\nSecond car: τ=17, h=28, span [17,28] at t=7\n\nAt T, [17 + 4(T-7), 28 + 4(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,4) and (28,17,right,4)\n\n28 and 17, but head=28, tail=17, so yes.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: different: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at t=7: [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? Head and tail.\n\nFor left-moving, head is left, so smaller number, tail larger? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t) = [h, τ] and moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nIn this case, head=-60, tail=-25, and since left-moving, head should be the left end, tail right end? But on a grid, left is smaller x, right is larger x.\n\nx=0 is the point we care about.\n\nFor left-moving car, head is the front, which is left, so smaller x, tail is right, larger x.\n\nIn the span, [h, τ] with h < τ for left-moving.\n\nHere, head=-60, tail=-25, so h=-60, τ=-25, so span at t=7: [h, τ] = [-60, -25]\n\nThen at T, [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)] = [-60 -36(T-7), -25 -36(T-7)]\n\ns=36.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-36,-47,right,4), (40,29,right,4), and (4,-7,right,4)\n\nFirst: head=-36, tail=-47, right, so span at t=7: [τ,h] = [-47,-36]? [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nτ is tail, h is head.\n\nFor right-moving, tail left, head right, so span [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nAt t=7: [-47, -36] for first car.\n\nSecond car: head=40, tail=29, right, span [29,40] at t=7.\n\nThird car: head=4, tail=-7, right, so τ=-7, h=4, span [-7,4] at t=7.\n\nAt T, each moves with speed 4 right.\n\nFreeway 8: (-20,-31,right,4) same as freeway 1 and 2.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=6 at turn 7.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to be at y=7, then y=8, then y=9.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, once I reach, I don't need to do anything.\n\ny=0 is also safe, but I'm not going there.\n\nNow, the minimal H is at least 3, so I should check if I can go up directly in 3 turns: from turn 7 to 8 to 9 to 10.\n\nAt turn 7, I am at y=6.\n\nI choose action for turn 7, which affects y for turn 8.\n\nLet's define the turn and position.\n\nAt the start of turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nI choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, so I check collision on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, check on that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nFor example, at turn 7, I am at y=6, so I need to check freeway 6 at turn 7 for collision.\n\nThen, after action, at turn 8, I am at y_8, which depends on a_7.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFirst, let's check for each freeway and each turn around now, when 0 is in the span for some car.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, I need to find for each freeway, at which turns 0 is covered by a car.\n\nCollision if at turn T, on freeway k, there exists a car such that 0 is in [left, right] of its span at T.\n\nFor each freeway, I can find the time intervals when a car covers x=0.\n\nThen, for the player, when on that freeway at that turn, collision.\n\nNow, t_1 = 7 is current turn.\n\nI need to consider turns from 7 onwards.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, right-moving, span at T: [ -31 + 4(T-7), -20 + 4(T-7) ]\n\nSet left = -31 + 4(T-7), right = -20 + 4(T-7)\n\n0 in span when left <= 0 <= right, so -31 + 4(T-7) <= 0 and 0 <= -20 + 4(T-7)\n\nFirst inequality: -31 + 4(T-7) <= 0 => 4(T-7) <= 31 => T-7 <= 31/4 = 7.75, so T <= 14.75, since T integer, T <= 14\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -20 + 4(T-7) => 20 <= 4(T-7) => 5 <= T-7 => T >= 12\n\nSo for T from 12 to 14 inclusive, 0 is covered.\n\nT >= 12 and T <=14, so T=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, so also covered at T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: span at T: [ -47 + 4(T-7), -36 + 4(T-7) ]\n\nSet left = -47 + 4(T-7), right = -36 + 4(T-7)\n\n0 in span: left <= 0 <= right\n\n-47 + 4(T-7) <= 0 => 4(T-7) <= 47 => T-7 <= 47/4 = 11.75, T <= 18.75, T<=18\n\n0 <= -36 + 4(T-7) => 36 <= 4(T-7) => 9 <= T-7 => T >= 16\n\nT >=16 and T<=18, but T<=18 from first, T>=16 from second.\n\nFirst inequality: left <=0 => T-7 <= 11.75, T<=18 since T integer? T-7 <= 11.75, since 47/4=11.75, so T-7 <= 11.75, T <= 18.75, so for integer T, T <= 18.\n\nSecond: 0 <= right => 0 <= -36 +4(T-7) => 4(T-7) >=36 => T-7 >=9 => T>=16\n\nSo T=16,17,18.\n\nBut is 0 covered? For T=16: left = -47 +4(9) = -47+36= -11, right= -36+36=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included, since right=0.\n\nSimilarly T=17: left=-47+40= -7? T-7=10, 4*10=40, left=-47+40=-7, right=-36+40=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=18: left=-47+44=-3, right=-36+44=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=19: left=-47+48=1, right=-36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=15: left=-47+32= -15? T-7=8, 4*8=32, left=-47+32=-15, right=-36+32=-4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo only T=16,17,18 for first car.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: span at T: [17 +4(T-7), 28 +4(T-7)]\n\nleft=17+4(T-7), right=28+4(T-7)\n\n0 in span: left <=0 <= right\n\nBut left=17+4(T-7) >=17 >0 for T>=7, so left >=17>0, so 0 <= left is false, so 0 cannot be <= left when left>0, so 0 not in span for any T, since left >=17 always.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways with similar cars.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only the first car covers 0 at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, so covered at T=16,17,18 by first car.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: left-moving car: head=-60, tail=-25, left, speed 36.\n\nSpan at T: [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)] = [-60 -36(T-7), -25 -36(T-7)]\n\ns=36.\n\nSet left_end = -60 -36(T-7), right_end = -25 -36(T-7)\n\nFor left-moving, the span is [h -s dt, τ -s dt], with h=-60, τ=-25.\n\n0 in span if left_end <= 0 <= right_end\n\nSince the car is moving left, left_end decreases, right_end decreases.\n\nleft_end = -60 -36(T-7)\n\nright_end = -25 -36(T-7)\n\n0 <= right_end => 0 <= -25 -36(T-7) => 36(T-7) <= -25? Wait, negative.\n\n0 <= -25 -36(T-7) implies -36(T-7) >= 25, since -25 negative, but inequality.\n\n0 <= -25 -36(T-7)\n\nAdd 36(T-7) to both sides: 36(T-7) <= -25\n\nBut left side, for T>7, is positive, right side negative, so 36(T-7) <= -25 is impossible since left positive, right negative.\n\nSimilarly, left_end <=0: -60 -36(T-7) <=0 => -36(T-7) <= 60 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36(T-7) >= -60\n\nSince T-7 >=0, 36(T-7) >=0 > -60, so always true for all T.\n\nBut from above, 0 <= right_end is never true because right_end = -25 -36(T-7) <0 for all T, since -25 - something non-negative.\n\nAt T=7, right_end = -25 -36(0) = -25 <0\n\nAs T increases, it decreases further, so always negative.\n\nThus 0 <= right_end is false for all T, so 0 is never in the span for freeway 6.\n\nIs that right?\n\nThe span is [left_end, right_end] = [ -60 -36dt, -25 -36dt ], both ends decreasing.\n\nSince both are negative and decreasing, the whole span is negative of x, so x=0 is never covered.\n\nYes, so freeway 6 is always safe, no car covers x=0.\n\nGood.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: similar to before, (-36,-47,right,4), so span at T: [ -47 +4(T-7), -36 +4(T-7) ]\n\nAs before, 0 covered when T=16,17,18.\n\nSecond car: (40,29,right,4), head=40, tail=29, so span [29 +4(T-7), 40 +4(T-7)]\n\nleft=29+4dt >=29>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nThird car: (4,-7,right,4), head=4, tail=-7, so τ=-7, h=4, span at t=7: [-7,4]\n\nAt T: [ -7 +4(T-7), 4 +4(T-7) ]\n\n0 in span: left <=0 <= right\n\nleft = -7 +4(T-7) <=0 => 4(T-7) <=7 => T-7 <= 7/4=1.75 => T <= 8.75, so T<=8\n\nright = 4 +4(T-7) >=0, always since min at T=7 is 4>0? At T=7, right=4, at T=8, right=8, etc.\n\n0 <= right: 0 <= 4 +4(T-7), always true for T>=7.\n\nleft <=0: -7 +4(T-7) <=0 => 4(T-7) <=7 => T-7 <=1.75 => T<=8.75, so T<=8 for integer.\n\nT from 7 to 8.\n\nAt T=7: left=-7, right=4, so [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=8: left=-7+4= -3? T-7=1, 4*1=4, left=-7+4=-3, right=4+4=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=9: left=-7+8=1, right=4+8=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for third car, 0 covered at T=7 and T=8.\n\nNow for freeway 7, at T=7 and T=8, third car covers 0, and at T=16,17,18 first car covers, but T=7 and 8 are immediate.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 1, covered at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when 0 is covered:\n\nFreeway 1: T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3: T=16,17,18 (from first car)\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=16,17,18\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=16,17,18\n\nFreeway 6: never\n\nFreeway 7: at T=7,8 (from third car), and T=16,17,18 (from first car)\n\nFreeway 8: T=12,13,14\n\nNow, player starts at turn 7, y=6.\n\nAt turn 7, I am on freeway 6, which is always safe, as we saw, no car covers x=0 ever. So at turn 7, no collision on y=6.\n\nNow, I need to choose action for turn 7.\n\nI want to go up to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut I have to be careful when on y=7 or y=8.\n\nFirst, let's see freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7 has danger at T=7 and T=8, but at T=7, I am not on y=7, I am on y=6.\n\nAt turn 7, I am on y=6.\n\nAfter action, at turn 8, I will be on y_8.\n\nIf I choose U at turn 7, then y_8 = 7.\n\nThen at turn 8, I am on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 at turn 8 has a car covering 0, so collision if I am on y=7 at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose S, y_8=6, still on y=6, safe.\n\nD, down to y=5, but y=5 might have issues, but I want to go up, so probably not down.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose U at turn 7, go to y=7 at turn 8, but at turn 8, on y=7, collision because freeway 7 has car at T=8.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go up immediately at turn 7 to y=7 at turn 8, because turn 8 has collision on y=7.\n\nIf I stay, y_8=6, safe.\n\nThen at turn 8, I choose action.\n\nNow, at turn 8, if I am on y=6, safe.\n\nIf I choose U, go to y=7 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, on y=7.\n\nNow, freeway 7 at turn 9: is there car covering 0?\n\nFrom above, freeway 7: at T=7 and 8, covered, but at T=9, not covered by third car. First car covers later, but T=9 is safe for freeway 7.\n\nAt T=9, for third car: as above, span [1,12] or something, 0 not in.\n\nFirst car at T=9: earlier, for first car on freeway 7, similar to freeway 3, at T=16,17,18, so T=9 safe.\n\nSo at turn 9, freeway 7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=7 at turn 9, safe.\n\nBut I need to go further.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nI want minimal turns, so ideally go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid the dangerous turns on each freeway.\n\nSince I start at y=6, turn 7.\n\ny=6 is always safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to pass through y=7 and y=8, each for at least one turn.\n\nBut I can stay or move down, but that might increase turns.\n\nMinimal is 3 turns if no obstacles, but here there might be delays.\n\nNow, let's see the dangers:\n\nFor y=7: freeway 7 has danger at T=7 and T=8, but T=7 is past, I was on y=6 at T=7.\n\nAt T=8, danger on y=7.\n\nT=9 safe, T=10,11,... until T=16,17,18 danger again, but that might be later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8: freeway 8 has danger at T=12,13,14.\n\nBut T=12 is turn 12, current is turn 7, so 5 turns away, but I might reach before that.\n\nFirst, from turn 7, I cannot go to y=7 immediately at turn 8 because of danger at T=8 on y=7.\n\nSo I need to wait at least until turn 9 to be on y=7.\n\nAt turn 7, I can choose S or D or U, but U leads to collision at turn 8, so I should not choose U.\n\nIf I choose S, stay at y=6 for turn 8.\n\nIf I choose D, go down to y=5 at turn 8.\n\nBut y=5 might be safe or not, but I want to go up, so going down might not help, and could take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, for now, I should stay or something.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, I can stay for a turn.\n\nSo at turn 7, action S: stay, so at turn 8, still y=6.\n\nThen at turn 8, I can choose to go up to y=7 at turn 9.\n\nAs above, at turn 9, y=7 is safe.\n\nSo action at turn 8: U, to y=7 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I am on y=7, and freeway 7 is safe at T=9.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=8.\n\nBut at turn 9, I am on y=7.\n\nI choose action for turn 9.\n\nIf I choose U, go to y=8 at turn 10.\n\nThen at turn 10, on y=8.\n\nNow, freeway 8 at turn 10: is there danger?\n\nFreeway 8: similar to freeway 1, covered at T=12,13,14.\n\nAt T=10, not covered, since T=10 <12.\n\nSimilarly, T=11, not covered.\n\nSo at turn 10, y=8 is safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=9.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFrom turn 9, y=7, I choose U, to y=8 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, on y=8, safe.\n\nThen at turn 10, I choose U, to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, on y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nAnd I reached y=9 at turn 11.\n\nNow, turns: start turn 7, y=6.\n\nTurn 7: action S, so at turn 8, y=6.\n\nTurn 8: action U, to y=7 at turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: action U, to y=8 at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: action U, to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, y=9, done.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 7 to turn 10, actions at t=7,8,9,10, and at turn 11, position is y=9, so I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn this case, after action at turn 10, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: turn 7: S, turn 8: U, turn 9: U, turn 10: U.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1, so t_1=7, actions from t=7 to t=10, that's 4 actions, H=4, reaching at turn t_1 + H -1 =7+4-1=10? Let's see.\n\nThe position after H turns: start at turn t_1, after 0 actions, position at t_1.\n\nAfter first action, at t_1 +1, position y_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions {a_t for t=t_1 to t_1 + H-1}, and after last action, at turn t_1 + H, position is set, but the position at turn t_1 + H should be 9? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", meaning that after H actions, we are at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the turn when position is 9 is turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn the answer format, it says y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9, let's check.\n\nThe task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nSo the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nAnd actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have set positions from t_1 to t_1 + H.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t_1, position before any action.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 +1, y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, which is set by the action at turn t_1 + H -2? Let's index.\n\nSet t = t_1 for simplicity.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nWe need that at some turn T, y_T =9, with T = t + H -1? From above.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThis position is determined by the action at turn t_1 + H -2, or initial if H-1=0.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =9, so must start at 9, but here not.\n\nIn general, actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} affect positions from y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I have:\n\nTurn 7 (t_1): y=6\n\nAction a_7: S, so y_8=6\n\nThen a_8: U, so y_9=7\n\na_9: U, so y_10=8\n\na_10: U, so y_11=9\n\nNow, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7 + H -1} should be 9.\n\nAt turn 11, y=9, which is turn t_1 +4, since t_1=7, 7+4=11.\n\nSo y_{t_1 +4} =9.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so y_{7 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{6 + H} =9? 7 + H -1 =6 + H.\n\nSet equal to 11, so 6 + H =11, H=5.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=7 to t=7+H-1.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nHere y_{7 + H -1} =9.\n\nBut in the sequence, y_11=9, so 7 + H -1 =11, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nActions: a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11? No.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions a_{t_1}, and y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =9.\n\nIf H=2, actions a_{t_1} and a_{t_1 +1}, and y_{t_1 +2-1} = y_{t_1 +1} =9.\n\nIn general, after actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, position at turn t_1 + H is set, but we care about position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the case where we reach at turn T, y_T=9, then T = t_1 + H -1, so H = T - t_1 +1.\n\nIn my plan, I reach y_11=9 at turn 11, t_1=7, so T=11, H=11-7+1=5.\n\nActions from t=7 to t=7+5-1=11? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =7 to 11? 7 to 11 is 5 actions: t=7,8,9,10,11.\n\nBut at turn 11, after action a_11, y_12 is set, but we don't care, since we only need y_11=9.\n\nIn the sequence, when we perform action a_t, it affects y_{t+1}.\n\nBut at turn t, before action, y_t is the position.\n\nAfter all actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position, which should be 9.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAt turn 7: y_7=6\n\na_7: S, so y_8=6\n\na_8: U, so y_9=7\n\na_9: U, so y_10=8\n\na_10: U, so y_11=9\n\nNow, y_11=9, which is at turn 11 = t_1 +4, since 7+4=11.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =11, so 7 + H -1 =11, H-1=4, H=5.\n\nBut with 4 actions: a_7 to a_10, we have y_11=9.\n\ny_11 is set by a_10.\n\nNow, for y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7 + H -1} to be 9.\n\nSet 7 + H -1 =11, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nThen the actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_7 to a_{11}.\n\nBut a_11 would affect y_12, which is not needed.\n\nPerhaps I need to include action up to when position is 9 at that turn.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9 means that at the turn when position is 9, it is turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, at turn 11, y=9, so t_1 + H -1 =11, H=5.\n\nActions: a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, and a_11.\n\nBut a_11 is not necessary, since we are already at y=9, we can choose S or something, but the position at turn 11 is already 9, so we don't need to move, but we might need to specify an action for turn 11 to make it part of the sequence.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, including the turn when we reach.\n\nFor example, if we start at y=9, then H=1, action a_{t_1}, and y_{t_1} =9, so at turn t_1, position is 9, and we might do nothing, but we need an action, probably S.\n\nBut here, we start at y=6.\n\nIn my sequence, with actions a_7 to a_10, we have y_11=9, so at turn 11, we are at 9.\n\nBut turn 11 is t_1 +4, so for y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 to hold, if y_{11}=9, then t_1 + H -1 =11, 7 + H -1=11, H=5.\n\nThen we need actions for t=7,8,9,10,11.\n\nAt turn 11, we are at y=9, so we can choose S for a_11, but it doesn't change position.\n\nThe minimal H should be as small as possible.\n\nIn this case, with H=5, we reach at turn 11.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nCurrently, with the actions, I reached at turn 11 with 4 actions but H=5? I'm confused.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nI need to have y_T =9 for T= t_1 + H -1.\n\nStart at turn 7, y=6.\n\nI want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest possible: if I go up directly, but I couldn't at first because of danger.\n\nAt turn 7, if I go U, y_8=7, but at turn 8, on y=7, collision because freeway 7 at T=8 has car.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nIf I go S at turn 7, y_8=6.\n\nThen at turn 8, I can go U, y_9=7.\n\nAt turn 9, on y=7, safe.\n\nThen from turn 9, I can go U to y_10=8.\n\nAt turn 10, on y=8, safe, since freeway 8 danger only at T=12,13,14.\n\nThen go U to y_11=9.\n\nSo at turn 11, y=9.\n\nIf I want to reach at turn 10, for example.\n\ny_10=9.\n\nThat means at turn 10, position is 9.\n\ny_10 is determined by action at turn 9.\n\ny_10 = y_9 + Δy_9.\n\nSo to have y_10=9, we need to be at y_9=8 or 9 or 10, but y=10 not possible, so y_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_9=8, then a_9=U to y_10=9.\n\nIf y_9=9, then a_9=S or D, but y_10=9 or 8, not 9 if D, so to have y_10=9, if y_9=9, a_9=S, y_10=9; if y_9=8, a_9=U, y_10=9.\n\nSimilarly, earlier.\n\nNow, to have y_10=9, we need to be at y_9=8 or 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, y_9 must be set.\n\nFrom start, at turn 7, y=6.\n\nAfter a_7, y_8.\n\nThen after a_8, y_9.\n\nThen a_9 determines y_10.\n\nTo have y_10=9, as above.\n\nWhat is the earliest y_9 can be 8 or 9.\n\ny_9=8: for example, if we go up fast.\n\nBut from turn 7.\n\nIf a_7=U, y_8=7, but at turn 8, collision on y=7, so not possible.\n\nThus, a_7 cannot be U.\n\na_7 must be S or D.\n\nIf a_7=S, y_8=6.\n\nThen at turn 8, a_8=U, y_9=7.\n\nThen at turn 9, y_9=7.\n\nNow, to have y_10=9, from y_9=7, I need to go up twice, but in one action, I can only change by 1, so from y_9=7, I can go to y_10=8 with U, or y_10=7 with S, or y_10=6 with D, but not directly to 9.\n\nSo y_10 cannot be 9 if y_9=7.\n\nIf I could be at y_9=8, but how?\n\nFrom y_8, if y_8=8, but at turn 8, y_8 is position.\n\nAt turn 7, y=6, after a_7, y_8.\n\ny_8 can be 5,6,7.\n\nBut y_8=7 not possible due to collision.\n\ny_8=6 if S or D from 6, but D to 5.\n\ny_8=6 or 5 or 7, but 7 invalid.\n\nSo y_8 <=6.\n\nThen after a_8, y_9.\n\nIf y_8=6, a_8=U, y_9=7.\n\nIf y_8=5, a_8=U, y_9=6, etc.\n\nSo from y_8<=6, y_9 <=7.\n\nThus at turn 9, y_9 <=7, so y_9 cannot be 8 or 9.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have y_10=9.\n\nSimilarly, y_11=9 is the earliest possible.\n\nIn my sequence, I have y_11=9.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1}=9.\n\nt_1=7, y_11=9, so 11 = 7 + H -1, so 11 = 6 + H, H=5.\n\nThen actions from t=7 to t=7+5-1=11, so a_7 to a_11.\n\nNow, at turn 11, we are at y=9, so for a_11, we can choose S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions for t=7 to t=11.\n\nBut with a_7 to a_10, we reach y_11=9, and a_11 can be S.\n\nSince we need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{11} =9, and with H=5, actions at t=7,8,9,10,11.\n\nBut action at t=11 doesn't affect the position at t=11, since position is before action.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, we specify action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut the position at turn t is y_t, before action.\n\nSo for turn t_1 + H -1, position y_{t_1 + H -1} is already set by previous actions, and we may perform an action, but it doesn't change that position.\n\nIn this case, to have y_{11}=9, we need that after actions up to a_10, y_11=9.\n\nThen for a_11, it can be anything, but we need to include it in the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we can have H smaller if we reach earlier, but we can't.\n\nAnother way: if I go down first, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nFor example, go down to y=5, but y=5 might have dangers, but in this case, freeway 5 has danger at T=16,17,18, not now, so safe, but going down and up takes more turns, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, staying or going up later.\n\nSo minimal H should be 5, reaching at turn 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn 7: position y=6, choose a_7. Since going up immediately causes collision at turn 8, we choose S or D, but S is better.\n\nChoose S, so y_8=6.\n\nAt turn 8: position y=6, choose U, so y_9=7.\n\nAt turn 9: position y=7, choose U, so y_10=8.\n\nAt turn 10: position y=8, choose U, so y_11=9.\n\nNow, at turn 11, y=9, we need to specify action for turn 11, but since we are at y=9, we can choose S.\n\nNow, for the sequence, with H=5, actions at t=7,8,9,10,11.\n\nBut action at t=11 is for the position at turn 12, but we don't care.\n\nIn the output, we need to list actions for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=5, turns: turn 7,8,9,10,11.\n\nActions: a_7=S, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=S (say)\n\nBut a_11=S, y_12=9, but we only care that at turn 11, y=9.\n\nWe can choose a_11 to be S.\n\nNow, but is there a way with H=4?\n\nIf H=4, then y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7+4-1} = y_{10} =9.\n\nSo need y_10=9.\n\nBut as above, to have y_10=9, we need y_9=8 or 9.\n\nBut y_9 cannot be 8 or 9 because from start, earliest y_9=7, as above.\n\ny_9=7 at turn 9.\n\nThen from y_9=7, y_10 can be 6,7,8, not 9.\n\nSo y_10 cannot be 9, impossible.\n\nThus minimal H is 5.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have to avoid collisions at all turns.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTurn 7: at y=6, freeway 6, no collision, safe.\n\nAction a_7=S, so y_8=6.\n\nTurn 8: at y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nAction a_8=U, so y_9=7.\n\nTurn 9: at y=7, freeway 7. At turn 9, freeway 7 safe, as we saw.\n\nAction a_9=U, so y_10=8.\n\nTurn 10: at y=8, freeway 8. At turn 10, freeway 8 safe, since danger only at T=12,13,14.\n\nAction a_10=U, so y_11=9.\n\nTurn 11: at y=9, safe. Action a_11=S, so y_12=9, but not needed.\n\nIn the output, for turn 11, we need to specify an action, say S.\n\nBut the position at turn 11 is 9, which is required.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, when I am at turn 9, y=7, I go to y=8 at turn 10.\n\nIs there any issue with freeway 8 at turn 10? No.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 7 at other times, but not relevant.\n\nNow, but in freeway 7, there is a car that covers at T=7 and T=8, but I am not on y=7 at those turns.\n\nAt turn 9, I am on y=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's confirm freeway 7 at turn 9.\n\nFreeway 7 cars:\n\nFirst car: at T=9, span: [ -47 +4(9-7), -36 +4(9-7) ] = [ -47 +8, -36+8] = [-39, -28], not include 0.\n\nSecond car: [29+4(2), 40+4(2)] = [29+8,40+8]=[37,48], not.\n\nThird car: [ -7 +4(2), 4+4(2) ] = [ -7+8, 4+8] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 10: similar to freeway 1, at T=10, span [ -31 +4(10-7), -20 +4(10-7) ] = [ -31+12, -20+12] = [-19,-8], not include 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S  (since we are at 9)\n\nBut in the answer, we need to list for each turn.\n\nSince we reach at turn 11, and action at turn 11 is not necessary, but we have to include it for the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we can have the last action such that we reach at that turn.\n\nFor example, if at turn 10, I am at y=8, and I choose U, then at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut turn 11 is when position is 9.\n\nIf I could be at y=9 at turn 10, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: what if I go up faster by skipping a freeway or something, but I can only change by 1 each turn, so I have to visit each y level.\n\nUnless I start from lower, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 directly from y=6, but impossible, since only ±1 or 0.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 5.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=7 to t=11.\n\nBut t=11 is turn t_1 + 4, since 7 to 11 is 5 turns? Turns: turn 7,8,9,10,11, that's 5 actions.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=5, t_1 + H -1 =7+4=11, yes.\n\nNow, but in the output, we need to write the actions.\n\nBut for turn 11, since I am at y=9, I must choose S, because if I choose U, y_12=10, but y=10 not allowed, so y must be in [0,9], so I cannot go above 9.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose D, y_12=8, but I want to stay at 9, but the position at turn 11 is already 9, so action doesn't affect that.\n\nBut to stay at 9, I should choose S.\n\nSimilarly, in action choices.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, for turn 11, action S.\n\nNow, but let's see if I can have H=4 with different path.\n\nSuppose at turn 7, I choose D, go to y=5 at turn 8.\n\nThen at turn 8, on y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 at turn 8: danger? Freeway 5 has cars, covered at T=16,17,18, so at T=8, safe.\n\nThen at turn 8, I can choose U, to y=6 at turn 9.\n\nThen at turn 9, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen choose U to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, on y=7, freeway 7 at T=10: safe, as before.\n\nThen choose U to y=8 at turn 11.\n\nThen at turn 11, on y=8, need to go to y=9.\n\nBut y_11=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need another action.\n\nFor example, at turn 11, choose U, to y_12=9.\n\nBut then at turn 12, y=9, which is later.\n\nAnd H would be larger.\n\nFor example, actions: t7: D, y8=5; t8: U, y9=6; t9: U, y10=7; t10: U, y11=8; then t11: U, y12=9.\n\nThen y12=9, so for y_{t1 + H -1}=9, t1=7, y12=9, so 12=7+H-1, H-1=5, H=6, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt turn 10, from y=7, if I go U, y11=8, still not 9.\n\nNo way to reach earlier.\n\nSo minimal H=5.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have to output for each turn.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the actions.\n\nNow, but I think I missed something.\n\nFreeway 7 has another danger at T=16,17,18, but since I am on y=7 at turn 9, which is before 16, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, danger at T=12,13,14, I am on at turn 10, before 12, safe.\n\nBut what if I stay longer, but I don't need to.\n\nIn my sequence, I move up each time after turn 8.\n\nBut at turn 9, I am on y=7, and I go up immediately.\n\nCould there be a problem if I stay on y=7 or y=8 during danger times, but I don't.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at turn 10 if I start from different position, but I start from y=6.\n\nAnother thought: since y=9 is safe, and I need to be there at some turn.\n\nBut in terms of turns, minimal is 3 actions to go from 6 to 9, but with obstacles, I have to wait one turn, so 4 actions but 5 turns including start.\n\nI think H=5 is correct.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut for turn 11, since we are at y=9, and we choose S to stay, but the position at turn 11 is already 9, so it's fine.\n\nIn the sequence, action at turn 11 is performed, but it doesn't change the position for that turn.\n\nPerhaps we can omit the last action if not needed, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nNow, but in the box.\n\nFirst, let's write the car states to confirm.\n\nThe problem has freeway 6 with a left-moving car, but we saw it never covers 0.\n\nIn freeway 7, at turn 7 and 8, covered, but I avoided.\n\nIn the player position, at turn 7, I am at y=6, which is freeway 6, safe.\n\nThen I stay, so at turn 8, still y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nThen go to y=7 at turn 9, safe.\n\nEtc.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 at turn 9, but what about freeway 8.\n\nNo issue.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 3,4,5, there are cars, but they cover later, not now.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H is 5.\n\nSequence: actions at turn 7: S, turn 8: U, turn 9: U, turn 10: U, turn 11: S\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\n}\n\nBut let's write the actions properly.\n\nSince the turn is given as t_1=7, but in the output, it should be with the turn numbers.\n\nIn the box, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so we use the actual turn.\n\nt_1=7.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 11 is turn t_1 + 4.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =11, H=5, t_1 + H -1 =7+5-1=11, yes.\n\nActions from t=7 to t=11.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nBut just to be sure, is there a way to reach at turn 10?\n\nSuppose at turn 7, I choose S, y8=6.\n\nThen at turn 8, instead of U, I choose something else, but I need to go up.\n\nIf I choose U at turn 8, y9=7.\n\nThen at turn 9, I choose U, y10=8.\n\nThen y10=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y10=9, I need to be at y9=9 or 8, but y9=7, not 8 or 9.\n\nIf at turn 7, I choose D, y8=5.\n\nThen at turn 8, choose U, y9=6.\n\nThen at turn 9, choose U, y10=7.\n\nStill y10=7.\n\nNot 9.\n\nNo way.\n\nThus, y10 cannot be 9.\n\nEarliest is y11=9.\n\nHence, H=5.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn 7. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Safe Turns\n- **Freeway 1**: Cars cover x=0 at turns 12, 13, 14.\n- **Freeway 2**: Cars cover x=0 at turns 12, 13, 14.\n- **Freeway 3**: Cars cover x=0 at turns 16, 17, 18.\n- **Freeway 4**: Cars cover x=0 at turns 16, 17, 18.\n- **Freeway 5**: Cars cover x=0 at turns 16, 17, 18.\n- **Freeway 6**: No car covers x=0 at any turn (always safe).\n- **Freeway 7**: Cars cover x=0 at turns 7, 8 (from one car) and 16, 17, 18 (from another car).\n- **Freeway 8**: Cars cover x=0 at turns 12, 13, 14.\n\nAt turn 7, the player is at y=6 (freeway 6), which is safe. Moving up immediately to y=7 at turn 8 would cause a collision on freeway 7 (covered at turn 8). Therefore, the player must wait at y=6 for one turn to avoid the danger on y=7 at turn 8.\n\n### Minimal Path to y=9\n- **Turn 7 (position y=6)**: Choose action S (stay) to remain at y=6 for turn 8. Freeway 6 is safe at turn 7.\n- **Turn 8 (position y=6)**: Choose action U (up) to move to y=7 at turn 9. Freeway 6 is safe at turn 8.\n- **Turn 9 (position y=7)**: Choose action U (up) to move to y=8 at turn 10. Freeway 7 is safe at turn 9 (not covered at turn 9).\n- **Turn 10 (position y=8)**: Choose action U (up) to move to y=9 at turn 11. Freeway 8 is safe at turn 10 (not covered at turn 10).\n- **Turn 11 (position y=9)**: Choose action S (stay) to remain at y=9. Position y=9 is safe (no cars).\n\nThis sequence reaches y=9 at turn 11 with H=5 turns (actions from turn 7 to turn 11). It is impossible to reach y=9 earlier (e.g., at turn 10) due to the collision risk on y=7 at turn 8 and the constraint of moving only one unit per turn.\n\n### Output Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns 7 to 11 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: S \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 8, and the player is at (0,6). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The player updates vertically at each turn.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and at that same turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nNote: The player is only on a freeway at turn T if the player's y-coordinate at turn T is that freeway. And when moving, at turn T the player is at y_T, and then after the action, at turn T+1 the player is at y_{T+1}. So at the moment of turn T, the player is on freeway y_T.\n\nWe are starting at turn 8 at y=6. We want to get to y=9. Since 9 is the top (and note that y=9 is not a freeway, because freeways are y=1..8), so once we are at y=9 we are safe. But we must avoid the freeways at the moment we are on them (y=1..8) if a car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (turn 8) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe note that the player can only change by -1, 0, or +1 per turn, and must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nWe start at y=6. We need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 3 moves (UUU). But we must avoid the cars on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe are going to simulate the future turns. We are at turn 8, and we are going to compute the car positions at future turns relative to turn 8.\n\nFor each freeway k (from 1 to 8), we have a list of cars. Each car is given by (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 8.\n\nWe note the direction: \n- If direction is 'right', then the car moves to the right (positive x direction). The span at turn T (relative to turn 8) for a right-moving car is:\n    [tail + s*(T-8), head + s*(T-8)]   (because at turn 8, the span was [tail, head] and then it moves right by s*(T-8) units per turn? Actually, the update rule says: for right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So at turn T, the span is [tau + s*(T-8), h + s*(T-8)].\n\nBut note the example: \n  At turn 8: for a right-moving car, we have (h, tau) given? Actually, the table says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\". And for right-moving, the initial span at turn 8 is [tau, h]? \n\nWait, the update rule says:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving: Span(t1)=[tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for each car we have (head, tail, direction, speed). How is the span defined? The update rule for right-moving says the initial span is [tau, h]. So the head is the larger coordinate? \n\nLooking at the example for freeway 1: (-16, -27, right, 4). \n  Since it's right-moving, the span at turn 8 is [tau, h] = [-27, -16]. Then at a future turn T, it becomes [-27 + 4*(T-8), -16 + 4*(T-8)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, like on freeway 6: (48,83,left,36). \n  The span at turn 8 is [h, tau] = [48,83] (but wait, that would be increasing? but left-moving so it moves left). Then at turn T, it becomes [48 - 36*(T-8), 83 - 36*(T-8)].\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that at turn T, the player is at freeway k (so y_T = k) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe must compute for each freeway k and each turn T (>=8) the set of positions that the cars on k cover at turn T. Then, if the player is at freeway k at turn T, we must avoid having 0 in the span of any car on k at that same turn T.\n\nWe note that the freeway k has multiple cars? For example, freeway 3 has two cars. We must avoid if at least one car has 0 in its span at turn T when the player is at y=k.\n\nPlan:\n- We are going to compute the minimal H and the sequence of actions that take the player from (0,6) at turn 8 to (0,9) as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nWe can use BFS in state space: state = (turn, y) \nBut note: the turn index matters because the car positions change with time.\n\nThe turn index starts at 8 and we are going to simulate forward. The state is (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 8) and y is the current vertical position (0..9).\n\nWe want to reach (t, 9) for any t (but we want minimal H, meaning minimal number of steps from turn 8). Note: H is the number of turns including the starting turn? Actually, the sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1, and we have H actions? But the problem says: \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we start at t1 (t=0 relative to t1) and go until t1+H-1 (so H actions, and we end at turn t1+H-1).\n\nAt turn t1 (turn 8) we are at y=6. Then we take an action at turn 8 to move to turn 9, and so on.\n\nWe must check at each state (t, y) whether we are at a freeway (y between 1 and 8) and if so, check if there is a car on freeway y that has 0 in its span at turn t.\n\nIf we are at y=0 or y=9, we don't check (since no freeway at those y's).\n\nWe are going to simulate from t=8 onward. We stop when we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll use BFS (since we want minimal H) but note that the state (t,y) can have t increasing without bound? However, we know that we can reach y=9 in at most 9 steps (if we go from 6 to 9 in 3 steps, but if we have to detour, maybe more). Also, note that the car positions are periodic? But the speeds are integers and the spans are linear. However, the grid for the car positions is infinite? But the collision only matters at x=0. So we only care about when the span covers 0.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k, the times at which it covers x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k (at turn t) we have:\n\nFor a right-moving car: span at turn t is [tau + s*(t-8), h + s*(t-8)]\nWe need 0 in [tau + s*(t-8), h + s*(t-8)] \n=> tau + s*(t-8) <= 0 <= h + s*(t-8)\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: [h - s*(t-8), tau - s*(t-8)] must cover 0:\n=> h - s*(t-8) <= 0 <= tau - s*(t-8)\n\nBut note: for a left-moving car, the span is [h, tau] at turn 8? Actually, the update rule says: left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(t-8), tau - s*(t-8)]. And the problem states: for a left-moving car, the initial span is [h, tau] and then moves left. But note: in the freeway 6 example: (48,83,left,36) -> at turn 8, the span is [48,83]. Then at turn t, it is [48-36*(t-8), 83-36*(t-8)]. \n\nNow, we need to check when 0 is in [48-36*(t-8), 83-36*(t-8)]? \nBut note: 48-36*(t-8) is decreasing and 83-36*(t-8) is also decreasing. And 48-36*(t-8) <= 83-36*(t-8) because 48<83.\n\nSo we require:\n  48 - 36*(t-8) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(t-8)\n\nWe can solve for t:\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36*(t-8) <= 0  => 48 <= 36*(t-8) => t-8 >= 48/36 = 4/3 => t>= 8 + 4/3 => t>=9.333 -> so t>=10 (since t integer) for the first inequality to hold? Actually, we have to be careful: the inequality is <=0, and 48-36*(t-8) is decreasing.\n\nBut actually, we have two conditions:\n\nCondition 1: 48 - 36*(t-8) <= 0  -> t-8 >= 48/36 = 4/3 -> t>=8+4/3 -> t>=10 (since t integer, next integer after 9.333 is 10)\n\nCondition 2: 0 <= 83 - 36*(t-8) -> 36*(t-8) <=83 -> t-8 <=83/36≈2.305 -> t<=8+2.305=10.305 -> so t<=10.\n\nSo for t=10, we have:\n  48 - 36*(10-8) = 48-72 = -24 <=0, and 83-72=11>=0 -> so 0 is in [-24,11]? Actually, the span at turn 10 is [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11] which does contain 0.\n\nBut wait, the condition for the left-moving car: \n  0 is in [h - s*(t-8), tau - s*(t-8)] = [48-36*(t-8), 83-36*(t-8)].\n\nSo for t=10: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11] -> yes, 0 is in this interval.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute for every car and every freeway the set of turns t (>=8) at which the car covers x=0.\n\nThen, for a freeway k, we have a set of dangerous turns: any turn at which at least one car on k has 0 in its span.\n\nThen, we can avoid being on freeway k at a dangerous turn.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) the set of dangerous turns.\n\nNote: the freeways have multiple cars? Yes, for example freeway 3 has two cars. So we must take the union of dangerous times for each car on that freeway.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Precomputation for each freeway k and each car on k: compute the set of turns t (integer, t>=8) for which the car covers x=0.\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n   (tau + s*(t-8) <= 0 <= h + s*(t-8))\n\nWe can write:\n   tau + s*(t-8) <= 0  => t <= 8 - tau/s\n   h + s*(t-8) >=0 => t >= 8 - h/s\n\nBut note: since the car moves right, tau and h are negative at turn8? Actually, for the right-moving car on freeway1: tau=-27, h=-16, s=4.\n   Then: \n      -27 + 4*(t-8) <= 0 -> 4*(t-8) <=27 -> t-8<=27/4=6.75 -> t<=14.75 -> t<=14\n      -16 + 4*(t-8) >=0 -> 4*(t-8)>=16 -> t-8>=4 -> t>=12\n\nSo dangerous for t in [12,14] (integers).\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: \n   [h - s*(t-8), tau - s*(t-8)] contains 0\n   => h - s*(t-8) <= 0 and tau - s*(t-8) >=0\n   => h <= s*(t-8) and tau >= s*(t-8)\n   => (h/s) <= t-8 <= (tau/s)\n\nBut note: h and tau are given. For freeway6: h=48, tau=83, s=36 -> \n   t-8 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333 -> t>=9.333 -> so t>=10\n   t-8 <= 83/36 ≈2.305 -> t<=10.305 -> so t<=10\n   So only t=10.\n\n2. After precomputation, we build a set for each freeway k: D_k = set of dangerous turns.\n\n3. Now, we do BFS:\n\n   We start at state: (t=8, y=6). \n   We consider actions: U, D, S.\n\n   We simulate one step: \n        a = U: then next state: t=9, y=7\n        a = D: then next state: t=9, y=5\n        a = S: then next state: t=9, y=6\n\n   But we must check the state (t, y) for collision? Actually, we check the state at the current turn: when we are at (t, y) we check if we are on a freeway (y between 1 and 8) and if t is in D_y, then we cannot be there.\n\n   However, note: the starting state (t=8, y=6) is at turn 8. We must check if at turn 8, freeway 6 has a car that covers 0? \n\n   Let's compute for freeway 6: \n        freeway6 has one car: (48,83,left,36). \n        At turn 8: the span is [48,83] -> 0 is not in [48,83] -> safe.\n\n   But what about freeway 7? We are not on freeway 7 at turn8.\n\n   So we only check the freeway that we are currently on.\n\n   Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n        Let state = (t, y) \n        For the next action, we compute the next y' and next turn = t+1.\n        Then we check the state (t, y) for collision? Actually, the collision is checked at the moment we are on that freeway at that turn.\n\n        However, note: when we are at turn t, we are at position y. Then we take an action at turn t to go to y' at turn t+1.\n\n        The problem states: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\". So we check at the turn T when we are at y_T.\n\n        Therefore, we must check the state (t, y) when we are at that state.\n\n        But note: the starting state: at turn 8 we are at (0,6). We must check freeway 6 at turn8? -> we just did: safe.\n\n        Then we take an action at turn8, and then at turn9 we are at the new y.\n\n        So we check the state at the time we enter it? Actually, we are at (t, y) at the beginning of turn t? \n\n        The game dynamics: \n          - At turn t, the player is at (0, y_t). Then we choose an action a_t, which updates the player to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n          - The car positions are updated for turn t? The update rule is given for T>t1, meaning that at turn T, the car span is computed as above.\n\n        The collision condition is checked at the moment of turn T: if the player is on a freeway k at turn T, and if a car on k at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\n        Therefore, we must check the state (t, y) when we are at that state.\n\n        So in BFS, when we are at state (t, y), we check:\n            if y is between 1 and 8 (inclusive) and if t is in the dangerous set for freeway y, then this state is invalid.\n\n        Then, if we are at (t, y) and it's safe, we then take an action to go to (t+1, y') and then check that new state.\n\n        We start at (8,6) and we check it (safe). Then we expand to (9,7), (9,5), (9,6) and check each of these at turn9.\n\n   Goal: when we reach (t,9) for any t, we stop. And we want the minimal H, where H is the number of actions? \n\n   But note: the sequence of actions starts at turn t1 (turn8) and we do H actions, so we end at turn t1+H-1? \n\n   Example: if we do nothing and we are already at 9? But we start at 6. \n\n   We start at turn8 at y=6. Then we do H actions: \n        turn8: action0 -> then at turn9 we are at y1\n        ...\n        turn8+H-1: we are at y_H.\n\n   We want y_H to be 9.\n\n   So the number of actions H is the number of steps. And the state at turn8 is the starting state (which we already have) and we are going to simulate H actions.\n\n   Therefore, in our BFS, we are counting the number of steps (which is the number of actions) and we want minimal H.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        Let queue be a queue of (t, y, path_actions) \n        Start: (8, 6, []) -> but we are going to take actions at turn8, so we need to generate the next states.\n\n        Actually, we are at state (t, y) and we are going to choose an action for this turn.\n\n        We can structure:\n\n            We start at (8,6) and then we have three actions: U, D, S -> leading to (9,7), (9,5), (9,6). Then from each of those, we check if they are safe (at turn9) and then expand.\n\n        We mark visited states? But note: we can revisit the same y at a later turn? and it might be safe then? So we have state (t,y). But t increases and we can have cycles? However, we are moving upward and we have a goal at 9, and we can also go down? But we are starting at 6 and want to get to 9, so we should avoid going too far down? \n\n        We'll use a visited set: (t,y). But note that the dangerous sets are periodic? Actually, the cars move at constant speed, so the dangerous times for a freeway might repeat? But the dangerous set we precomputed for each freeway k is a set of integer times? \n\n        However, for the right-moving car on freeway1: we computed [12,14] (for t>=8). What about t=12,13,14? and then beyond? \n\n        For t=16: \n            freeway1: right-moving car: \n                span = [-27+4*(16-8), -16+4*(16-8)] = [-27+32, -16+32] = [5,16] -> does not contain 0? \n            so it's safe at t=16.\n\n        But note: the car moves continuously? Actually, the car spans are linear and the dangerous times are contiguous intervals? \n\n        Actually, the dangerous times for a single car form an interval? \n\n        For a right-moving car: \n            t_min = ceil( (8 - h/s) )? Actually, we had: \n                t >= 8 + ceil( ( -h ) / s )? \n\n        But we computed: \n            t_min = ceil(8 + ( -h ) / s) ? \n\n        Actually, from the inequalities:\n\n            t >= 8 + ceil( ( -h ) / s )   ? \n\n        For the freeway1 car: h=-16, s=4 -> (-(-16))/4 = 16/4=4 -> t_min = 8+4 = 12? \n\n        t_max = 8 + floor( ( -tau ) / s )? \n            tau=-27 -> -tau=27, 27/4=6.75 -> floor=6 -> t_max=14? \n\n        So the dangerous interval for a car is [t_min, t_max] inclusive? \n\n        Similarly, for a left-moving car: \n            t_min = 8 + ceil( h / s ) \n            t_max = 8 + floor( tau / s )\n\n        But for freeway6: \n            h=48, s=36 -> 48/36=4/3≈1.333 -> ceil(1.333)=2 -> t_min=8+2=10\n            tau=83, 83/36≈2.305 -> floor=2 -> t_max=8+2=10? \n            So [10,10] -> only turn10.\n\n        Therefore, we can precompute for each freeway k the dangerous intervals? Actually, we can precompute the entire set of dangerous turns for each freeway k by taking the union of the intervals from each car.\n\n        Then, for each freeway k, we have a set D_k = { t in Z, t>=8 such that at turn t, freeway k has a car that covers 0 }\n\n        Now, we can do BFS:\n\n            We start at (t=8, y=6). We check: for freeway6 at t=8? we computed that it's safe (because 0 not in [48,83]). So we mark (8,6) as safe.\n\n            Then, we consider the three actions: \n                U -> (9,7)\n                D -> (9,5)\n                S -> (9,6)\n\n            Then we check state (9,7): freeway7 at t=9? \n            We need to compute D_7: the dangerous turns for freeway7.\n\n            Freeway7 has three cars: \n                car1: (-32, -43, right, 4) -> right-moving: \n                    t_min = 8 + ceil( (32)/4 )? Wait, no: \n                    Actually, for right-moving: \n                        t_min = 8 + ceil( (-h) / s ) = 8 + ceil(32/4)=8+ceil(8)=8+8=16? \n                    But wait: the car is given as (head, tail) = (-32, -43) -> so h=-32, tau=-43? \n                    Then: \n                        We require: \n                            tau + s*(t-8) <= 0 <= h + s*(t-8)\n                            => -43 + 4*(t-8) <= 0 <= -32 + 4*(t-8)\n                        Solve:\n                            -43+4*(t-8)<=0 -> 4*(t-8)>=43 -> t-8>=43/4=10.75 -> t>=18.75 -> t_min=19\n                            -32+4*(t-8)>=0 -> 4*(t-8)>=32 -> t-8>=8 -> t>=16 -> but the first condition requires t>=19? \n                        Actually, both must hold: \n                            We have: \n                                -43 + 4*(t-8) <= 0  -> t>= ceil(8+43/4)=ceil(8+10.75)=ceil(18.75)=19\n                                -32+4*(t-8)>=0 -> t>=8+8=16\n                        So the dangerous interval is t>=19 and t<=? \n                            The second part: 0<= h+s*(t-8) -> we have that for any t>=16, but we also require the first part? \n                        Actually, we must have both:\n                            tau + s*(t-8) <= 0 -> t>= ceil(8 + (-tau)/s) = ceil(8+43/4)=ceil(18.75)=19\n                            h + s*(t-8) >=0 -> t>= ceil(8 + (-h)/s) = ceil(8+32/4)=ceil(8+8)=16\n                        So the dangerous interval is [max(19,16), ...? \n                        And the upper bound? \n                            The condition tau+s*(t-8)<=0 and h+s*(t-8)>=0 must hold simultaneously. \n                            The second condition is always true for t>=16, but the first condition only for t>=19.\n                            For the upper bound, note that the span moves to the right, so eventually the entire car passes 0? \n                            Actually, the condition h+s*(t-8)>=0 is always true for t>=16. \n                            But the condition tau+s*(t-8)<=0 is true for t>=19. \n                            However, we also need 0 to be in the entire interval? Actually, the condition is that the entire interval [tau+s*(t-8), h+s*(t-8)] must cover 0. \n                            But note: since the car is moving right and the tail is behind, we have tau+s*(t-8) <= h+s*(t-8) (because tau<=h) and the condition is that 0 is between them. \n                            So we require:\n                                tau+s*(t-8) <= 0 <= h+s*(t-8)\n                            So the upper bound: \n                                0 <= h+s*(t-8) -> already satisfied for t>=16\n                                and \n                                tau+s*(t-8) <= 0 -> which is the same as t>=19, but there is no upper bound? \n                            Actually, when the entire car passes 0, the tail becomes positive? \n                                When tau+s*(t-8) >0, then 0 is not in the interval? \n                            So: \n                                tau+s*(t-8) <=0  -> t <= floor(8 + (-tau)/s) ? \n                                Actually: \n                                    tau+s*(t-8) <=0 -> s*(t-8) <= -tau -> t-8 <= (-tau)/s -> t<=8+floor((-tau)/s) ? \n                            But note: (-tau) is positive? because tau is negative? \n                                tau=-43, so -tau=43 -> t-8 <=43/4=10.75 -> t<=18.75 -> so t<=18? \n\n                            Therefore, the dangerous interval for this car is [19,18]? That is empty? \n\n            Let me recast:\n\n                We have: \n                    -43 + 4*(t-8) <= 0   => 4*(t-8) <=43  => t-8 <=43/4=10.75 => t<=18.75 -> so t<=18 (since integer)\n                and \n                    -32 + 4*(t-8) >=0   => 4*(t-8)>=32 => t-8>=8 => t>=16\n\n                So the dangerous times: t>=16 and t<=18? \n\n                Then we check t=16: \n                    tail: -43+4*(16-8)= -43+32 = -11 <=0 -> true\n                    head: -32+32=0>=0 -> true -> so 0 is in [-11,0]? -> yes, 0 is the head? \n                So dangerous at t=16,17,18.\n\n                How did I get t_min=19? I did ceil(8+43/4)=ceil(18.75)=19 -> that's for the lower bound of the tail condition? But actually, the condition for the tail is an upper bound on t? \n\n            Correction: \n\n                The condition: \n                    tau + s*(t-8) <= 0   => t <= 8 - tau/s   (because tau is negative, so -tau/s is positive) \n                and \n                    h + s*(t-8) >=0   => t>= 8 - h/s\n\n                For this car: \n                    tau=-43, s=4 -> -tau/s =43/4=10.75 -> so t<=8+10.75=18.75 -> so t<=18 (since integer)\n                    h=-32, s=4 -> -h/s=32/4=8 -> t>=8+8=16\n\n                So dangerous for t in [16,18]? \n\n            Therefore, the dangerous set for this car is t=16,17,18.\n\n            Similarly, for the other cars on freeway7:\n\n                car2: (44,33,right,4) -> wait, the head and tail: head=44, tail=33? and direction right? \n                But the update rule for right-moving: initial span is [tau, h] = [33,44]? \n                Then at turn t, [33+4*(t-8), 44+4*(t-8)]\n                We need 0 in [33+4*(t-8), 44+4*(t-8)]?\n                But 33+4*(t-8) is at least 33 (at t=8) and increasing. So 0 is never in this interval? \n\n                Why? because 33>0? so the entire car is to the right of 0? \n\n                So this car is never dangerous.\n\n                car3: (8,-3,right,4) -> head=8, tail=-3? \n                Then initial span: [tau, h] = [-3,8] -> which at turn8: [ -3, 8] already contains 0? \n                Then at turn t: [-3+4*(t-8), 8+4*(t-8)]\n                We need 0 in that interval? \n                    -3+4*(t-8) <=0 -> 4*(t-8)<=3 -> t-8<=0.75 -> t<=8.75 -> t<=8\n                    and 8+4*(t-8)>=0 -> 4*(t-8)>=-8 -> t-8>=-2 -> t>=6 -> but we start at t>=8.\n\n                So at t=8: \n                    -3<=0<=8 -> yes, so dangerous at t=8.\n\n                But wait, at turn8 we are at freeway6, not freeway7? so we are not on freeway7 at t=8.\n\n                However, for freeway7 at t=8, we have this car. So if we were on freeway7 at t=8, it would be dangerous. But we are not.\n\n                Now, for t>8: \n                    t=9: [-3+4,8+4]=[1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe? \n                Actually, the condition: \n                    -3+4*(t-8) <=0 -> t-8<=0.75 -> t<=8.75 -> so only t=8.\n\n            Therefore, for freeway7, the dangerous times are:\n                car1: [16,18]\n                car2: never\n                car3: [8]   (only turn8)\n\n            So D_7 = {8, 16,17,18}\n\n            Therefore, at t=9: freeway7 is safe? because 9 is not in D_7.\n\n            So the state (9,7) is safe.\n\n            Similarly, we need to compute for all freeways.\n\n        This precomputation is crucial.\n\n        We'll do it for each freeway:\n\n        Freeway1: one car: (-16,-27,right,4)\n            car1: \n                t_min = ceil(8 + (16)/4) = ceil(8+4)=12? \n                But wait: we have the formula: \n                    t_min = 8 + ceil( ( - h ) / s ) = 8 + ceil(16/4)=8+4=12\n                    t_max = 8 + floor( ( - tau ) / s ) = 8 + floor(27/4)=8+6=14?  (because 27/4=6.75 -> floor=6)\n                So [12,14]\n\n            D_1 = {12,13,14}\n\n        Freeway2: same as freeway1: (-16,-27,right,4) -> D_2 = {12,13,14}\n\n        Freeway3: two cars: \n            car1: (-32,-43,right,4) -> same as freeway7 car1: [16,18] \n            car2: (32,21,right,4) -> head=32, tail=21 -> right-moving: [21,32] at turn8 -> then [21+4*(t-8),32+4*(t-8)] -> always positive? so never dangerous.\n            So D_3 = {16,17,18}\n\n        Freeway4: same as freeway3: two cars: \n            car1: (-32,-43,right,4) -> [16,18]\n            car2: (32,21,right,4) -> not dangerous.\n            D_4 = {16,17,18}\n\n        Freeway5: same as freeway3: D_5 = {16,17,18}\n\n        Freeway6: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n            For left-moving: \n                t_min = 8 + ceil( h / s ) = 8 + ceil(48/36)=8+ceil(1.333)=8+2=10\n                t_max = 8 + floor( tau / s ) = 8+floor(83/36)=8+2=10\n            So D_6 = {10}\n\n        Freeway7: as above: {8,16,17,18} (from car1: [16,18] and car3: [8])\n\n        Freeway8: (-16,-27,right,4) -> same as freeway1: {12,13,14}\n\n        Now, we summarize:\n\n        Freeway1: {12,13,14}\n        Freeway2: {12,13,14}\n        Freeway3: {16,17,18}\n        Freeway4: {16,17,18}\n        Freeway5: {16,17,18}\n        Freeway6: {10}\n        Freeway7: {8,16,17,18}\n        Freeway8: {12,13,14}\n\n        Note: at turn8, freeway7 is dangerous. But we start at freeway6 at turn8 -> safe.\n\n        Now, we do BFS:\n\n            Level0 (turn8): state (8,6) -> safe? freeway6: D_6={10} -> 8 not in D_6 -> safe.\n\n            Now, we consider actions at turn8:\n\n                U: -> (9,7) -> check: freeway7 at t=9 -> D_7={8,16,17,18} -> 9 not in -> safe.\n                D: -> (9,5) -> freeway5 at t=9: D_5={16,17,18} -> 9 not in -> safe.\n                S: -> (9,6) -> freeway6 at t=9: D_6={10} -> 9 not in -> safe.\n\n            So we have three states at turn9.\n\n            Level1: H=1 (we've taken one action) but we are not at 9.\n\n            Then from each:\n\n                From (9,7): \n                    U: (10,8) -> freeway8 at t=10: D_8={12,13,14} -> 10 not in -> safe.\n                    D: (10,6) -> freeway6 at t=10: D_6={10} -> 10 is in! -> collision -> skip.\n                    S: (10,7) -> freeway7 at t=10: D_7={8,16,17,18} -> 10 not in -> safe.\n\n                From (9,5):\n                    U: (10,6) -> freeway6 at t=10 -> collision -> skip.\n                    D: (10,4) -> freeway4 at t=10: D_4={16,17,18} -> 10 not in -> safe.\n                    S: (10,5) -> freeway5 at t=10: safe? D_5={16,17,18} -> safe.\n\n                From (9,6):\n                    U: (10,7) -> freeway7 at t=10: safe (as above)\n                    D: (10,5) -> freeway5 at t=10: safe (as above)\n                    S: (10,6) -> collision.\n\n            Level2: states at turn10: \n                (10,8), (10,7) [from (9,7) and (9,6)], (10,4) [from (9,5)], (10,5) [from (9,5) and (9,6)]\n\n            Now, check goal: none is 9.\n\n            Then we expand:\n\n                (10,8): \n                    U: (11,9) -> goal! and y=9 -> safe (not a freeway) -> we are done? \n                    But we must check the state (10,8): freeway8 at t=10: safe (as above). \n                    Then we take action U at turn10 -> next state (11,9): goal.\n\n                So we have a path: \n                    turn8: action? we need to backtrack.\n\n                How we got to (10,8): \n                    (10,8) came from (9,7) by U at turn9? \n                    (9,7) came from (8,6) by U at turn8.\n\n                So the sequence: \n                    turn8: U\n                    turn9: U\n                    turn10: U -> then at turn11 we are at 9.\n\n                But wait: at turn10 we are at (10,8) -> then we do U at turn10 to go to (11,9). So the last action is at turn10.\n\n                Total actions: 3.\n\n                But let's check: \n                    turn8: start at 6 -> do U -> at turn9: 7 -> safe? at turn9 freeway7: safe (9 not in {8,16,17,18})\n                    turn9: do U -> at turn10: 8 -> safe? at turn10 freeway8: {12,13,14} -> 10 not in -> safe.\n                    turn10: do U -> at turn11: 9 -> goal.\n\n                So H=3.\n\n            But is there a shorter path? H=3 is minimal? because we need to go from 6 to 9: 3 steps.\n\n            However, we must check if there is a path with H=2? \n\n            How? \n                At turn8: we start at 6. \n                We must be at 9 at turn10 (since we do two actions: turn8 and turn9, and then at turn10 we are at the state).\n\n                Possibilities:\n\n                    Option1: UU -> \n                        turn8: U -> 7\n                        turn9: U -> 8 -> at turn9: we are at 8? but then at turn10 we are at 8? wait, no: \n                        Actually: \n                            turn8: action U: from 6 to 7 (at turn9)\n                            turn9: action U: from 7 to 8 (at turn10) -> but we need to be at 9 at turn10? \n\n                To be at 9 at turn10, we must be at 8 at turn9 and then U at turn9 -> then at turn10 we are at 9.\n\n                So the state at turn9 must be 8? \n\n                But from turn8 to turn9: we can go from 6 to 7 (U), 5 (D), 6 (S). Then from 7, we can go to 8 (U) -> then at turn10 we are at 8? \n\n                Actually, to be at 9 at turn10, we must be at 8 at turn9 and then do U at turn9 -> then at turn10 we are at 9.\n\n                But we start at 6. How to get to 8 at turn9? \n                    We need to go from 6 to 8 in one action? That's not possible (max one step per turn).\n\n                Therefore, minimal H is 3.\n\n            However, we found a path: \n                turn8: U -> to 7 at turn9\n                turn9: U -> to 8 at turn10\n                turn10: U -> to 9 at turn11\n\n            But the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 8+3-1=10? \n\n            Actually, the sequence is for t1 to t1+H-1: \n                a_{t1} = a_8\n                a_{t1+1}=a_9\n                a_{t1+2}=a_10\n\n            Then the last action is at turn10, and the player arrives at 9 at turn11? \n\n            But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\n            How does the update work? \n                At turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\n            So after H actions, we have taken actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and the last state is at turn t1+H.\n\n            We require that at turn t1+H-1 (the last action) we are at (0,9)? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n            But note: \n                After the action at turn t1+H-1, the position becomes y_{t1+H} = ... \n            But the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\n            Let me read: \n                \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\n            And in the update: \n                y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\n            So if we do an action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\n            Therefore, at the moment of the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are updating from y_{t1+H-1} to y_{t1+H}. We require y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\n            But the goal condition: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\n            So we are at (0,9) at the turn t1+H-1.\n\n            How does that work? \n\n                We start at turn t1 (turn8) at y=6.\n\n                After H actions, we have taken H actions: at turns 8,9,...,8+H-1.\n\n                And then at turn 8+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\n            Therefore, the update: \n                turn8: action a8 -> then at turn9: y9 = y8 + Delta a8\n                ...\n                turn8+H-1: action a_{8+H-1} -> then at turn8+H: y_{8+H} = y_{8+H-1} + Delta a_{8+H-1}\n\n            But we require that at turn8+H-1, we are at 9. So we do not require that the action at turn8+H-1 changes to 9? \n\n            Actually, we require the state at turn8+H-1 is (0,9). \n\n            How can we be at 9 at turn8+H-1? \n\n                We must have reached 9 at turn8+H-1 by the previous actions.\n\n            Example: \n                H=1: \n                    We do an action at turn8: then at turn9 we are at y9. But we require at turn8 we are at 9? but we start at 6. \n                H=2: \n                    At turn8: we do an action -> then at turn9 we are at some y9. Then at turn9 we do an action -> then at turn10 we are at y10. \n                    But we require at turn9 (which is t1+2-1 = 8+1) we are at 9? \n\n            So the state at turn9 must be 9.\n\n            Therefore, in our BFS, we require the state (t, y) to be at y=9 at the time we are at that state.\n\n            So we stop when we are at (t,9) for some t.\n\n            In our path: \n                We had a path that ends at (11,9) -> but that is turn11, which is t1+3 (since t1=8, 8+3=11). \n                We require the state at turn t1+H-1=8+H-1=11? Then 8+H-1=11 -> H=4? \n\n            This is confusing.\n\n            Let me define:\n\n                Let t_start = t1 = 8.\n\n                We take actions at turns: t_start, t_start+1, ..., t_start+H-1.\n\n                The state at the beginning of turn t_start is (0,y0) = (0,6).\n\n                After taking action at turn t_start, we are at the beginning of turn t_start+1 at y1.\n\n                ...\n\n                After taking action at turn t_start+H-1, we are at the beginning of turn t_start+H at y_H.\n\n                We require that at the beginning of turn t_start+H-1, we are at (0,9)? \n\n                But the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\n                This notation: y_{t} is the position at the beginning of turn t? \n\n                Actually, the game dynamics: \n                    \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\n                So at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then we are at y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\n                Therefore, we require at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n            How many actions have been taken? \n                We start at turn8: y8=6.\n                After 0 actions: we are at turn8, y8=6 -> not 9.\n                After 1 action: we are at turn9, y9 = ... -> we require y9=9? \n                After 2 actions: we are at turn10, y10=9? \n                After 3 actions: we are at turn11, y11=9.\n\n            So we require that at turn8+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n            Therefore, we want to reach (turn = 8+H-1, y=9).\n\n            The minimal H is the minimal number of actions such that at the beginning of turn8+H-1 we are at 9.\n\n            And we take H actions: from turn8 to turn8+H-1.\n\n            So if we can get to 9 at turn9 (H=2), that would be minimal. But we start at 6 at turn8. How to get to 9 at turn9? \n                We need y9=9. \n                y9 = y8 + Delta a8 -> so we need 6 + Delta a8 = 9 -> Delta a8=3 -> but the actions only give -1,0,1 -> impossible.\n\n            Next: H=3: we require y10=9. \n                y10 = y9 + Delta a9\n                y9 = y8 + Delta a8\n\n                So we need: \n                    y8 + Delta a8 + Delta a9 = 9\n                    6 + (Delta a8 + Delta a9) = 9\n                    Delta a8 + Delta a9 = 3.\n\n                Possibilities: UU -> +1+1=2 -> 8, not enough.\n                             U and then U again: 6->7->8 -> then at turn10 we are at 8, not 9.\n                Actually, to be at 9 at turn10, we need to be at 8 at turn9 and then do U at turn9? -> then y10=9.\n\n                But at turn9 we are at 8? then we do U -> then at turn10 we are at 9.\n\n                How to get from 6 at turn8 to 8 at turn9? \n                    We need y9=8 -> 6 + Delta a8 = 8 -> Delta a8=2 -> impossible.\n\n            H=4: we require y11=9.\n                y11 = y10 + Delta a10\n                y10 = y9 + Delta a9\n                y9 = y8 + Delta a8\n\n                So: 6 + (Delta a8 + Delta a9 + Delta a10) = 9 -> we need total +3.\n\n                Minimal: 3 ups: UUU -> 3 steps.\n\n            Therefore, minimal H is 3? but we require 3 actions? and then at turn8+3-1=10 we are at 9? \n\n            Actually: \n                H=3 actions: at turn8,9,10.\n                Then we are at turn11: y11 = ... \n                But we require y_{8+3-1}=y10=9.\n\n            How do we get y10=9? \n                We must be at y10=9 at the beginning of turn10.\n\n            How do we get to y10? \n                y10 = y9 + Delta a9\n                y9 = y8 + Delta a8\n\n                So to have y10=9, we must have y9=8 and then a9=U? \n                But then we do the third action at turn10: a10? but then we update to y11? \n\n            But we only take H=3 actions: at turns8,9,10. Then at turn10, we take the last action, and then we update to y11. \n            But the state at the beginning of turn10 is y10. How did we get y10? \n\n            We get y10 from the action at turn9: \n                turn9: we are at y9, we do a9 -> then we get y10 = y9 + Delta a9.\n\n            Then at turn10, we do a10 -> and then we get y11.\n\n            But we require that at the beginning of turn10 (before taking a10) we are at y10=9? \n\n            So we require y10=9 at the beginning of turn10. Then we take a10? but then we move away? \n\n            The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and then we are done? \n\n            Actually, the problem does not say we have to stay there. It just says to reach (0,9). \n\n            But note: the goal is: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", meaning at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 (which is turn10) we are at 9.\n\n            So we do not care what happens after the action at turn10? \n\n            However, we must avoid collision at turn10: \n                If we are at freeway9? no, freeways are 1..8. So at y=9, no freeway -> safe.\n\n            Therefore, we can stop as soon as we are at y=9 at the beginning of a turn.\n\n            So our BFS should check at the state (t,y): if y==9, then we stop.\n\n            In our earlier simulation, we found a path that at turn11 we are at 9. But we want at turn10 to be at 9? \n\n            How?\n\n            We need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn10.\n\n            How to get to 9 at turn10? \n                We start at turn8: y8=6.\n                Then at turn9: y9 = 6 + Delta a8.\n                Then at turn10: y10 = y9 + Delta a9.\n\n                We require y10=9.\n\n                So: 6 + Delta a8 + Delta a9 = 9 -> Delta a8 + Delta a9 = 3.\n\n                Possibilities: \n                    UU: +1+1=2 -> 6+2=8 -> not 9.\n                    U and then U: same.\n                There is no way to get +3 in two actions? \n\n            Therefore, minimal H is 4? because:\n\n                H=4: we require y_{8+4-1}=y11=9.\n\n                Then: \n                    y11 = y10 + Delta a10\n                    y10 = y9 + Delta a9\n                    y9 = y8 + Delta a8\n\n                    So: 6 + (a8+a9+a10) = 9 -> we need three +1's.\n\n                Then we can do: \n                    turn8: U -> y9=7\n                    turn9: U -> y10=8\n                    turn10: U -> y11=9\n\n                Then at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9.\n\n                And we have taken 3 actions: at turns8,9,10.\n\n                But wait: H=4? then the last action is at turn8+4-1=11? \n\n                Actually, the actions are at turns: 8,9,10,11? \n\n                But we only did 3 actions. \n\n            Let me map:\n\n                H: number of actions (the length of the sequence) = 3.\n                The turns at which actions are taken: t1, t1+1, t1+2 -> turns8,9,10.\n                Then we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = 8+3-1=10, we are at 9? \n\n                But in this path, at the beginning of turn10, we are at y10=8, not 9.\n\n                Then we take an action at turn10: U -> then at turn11 we are at 9.\n\n                But the requirement is at the beginning of turn10 to be at 9? \n\n                We are not there.\n\n            How can we be at 9 at the beginning of turn10? \n                We need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn10 without having taken an action at turn10? \n\n                But then we would have taken actions at turn8 and turn9 only (H=2) -> which is impossible.\n\n            The confusion is: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". \n\n            And then the goal: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\n            So for H=3: \n                we require y_{8+3-1}=y10=9.\n\n            We need to achieve y10=9.\n\n            How? \n                y10 = y9 + a9\n                y9 = y8 + a8\n\n                So we need: \n                    y8 + a8 + a9 = 9\n                    6 + a8 + a9 = 9 -> a8+a9=3.\n\n            But the maximum per action is +1, so we need three actions? \n\n            However, note: we have three actions: \n                a8, a9, a10? \n            But for H=3, we only take actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2 -> turns8,9,10.\n\n            Then a8 is at turn8, a9 at turn9, a10 at turn10.\n\n            Then y10 is computed as: y10 = y9 + a9, but not involving a10? \n            But then how is a10 used? \n\n            Actually, the state at the beginning of turn10 is y10. Then we take a10 to get y11.\n\n            But the goal is y10=9.\n\n            So if we can achieve y10=9 with two actions (a8 and a9), then we don't need a10? \n\n            But the sequence must have H=3 actions? \n\n            This is a conflict.\n\n            Let me read the problem: \n                \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n                and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\n            So the sequence has H actions, taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n            And then at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n            How can we be at y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\n                That means we haven't taken the action at turn t1+H-1 yet. \n\n            But then how did we get to y_{t1+H-1}? \n\n                It is determined by the previous actions.\n\n            Specifically, \n                y_{t1} = given (6)\n                y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + a_{t1}\n                ...\n                y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+H-2} + a_{t1+H-2}\n\n            So the last action that affects y_{t1+H-1} is a_{t1+H-2}, taken at turn t1+H-2.\n\n            Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9, and we are about to take the last action a_{t1+H-1} (which is the H-th action), but we don't care about what happens after? \n\n            The problem doesn't require us to stay, but only to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\n            However, the collision avoidance is only required for the turns we are on freeway. Since at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9 (not a freeway), we are safe.\n\n            Therefore, we do not need to simulate the last action.\n\n            But note: we must avoid collision on the way. We only care about the states from turn8 to turn8+H-1.\n\n            For a path of H actions, we only care about the states at turns: 8,9,...,8+H-1.\n\n            Specifically, the state at turn8: (8,6)\n            turn9: (9,y9)\n            ...\n            turn8+H-1: (8+H-1, 9)\n\n            And we must avoid collision at each of these turns if the y is between 1 and 8.\n\n            The actions are taken at turns8 to 8+H-1, but the action at turn8+H-1 doesn't affect our position at turn8+H-1? \n\n            The action at turn8+H-1 will only affect the next state (turn8+H), but we don't care.\n\n            Therefore, in our BFS, we want to reach (t,9) for some t, and then we output the actions from turn8 to turn t-1? \n\n            But note: the state at turn8+H-1 is (8+H-1,9). The actions we took are from turn8 to turn8+H-2? because the last state turn8+H-1 is the goal and we don't need to take an action to change it? \n\n            However, the problem requires a sequence of H actions. \n\n            And the last action is taken at turn8+H-1. \n\n            What should that last action be? \n\n            It can be anything? because it doesn't affect our position at turn8+H-1. \n\n            But the problem doesn't specify that we stop after reaching. It only says we must reach at turn8+H-1. \n\n            And the action at turn8+H-1 might cause us to leave the safe haven? \n\n            However, since we only care about the state at turn8+H-1, and not beyond, and the collision condition is only checked at the turn we are on, then at turn8+H-1 we are at y=9 (safe) and then we take an action (whatever) and then at turn8+H we might be at 8 or 10? but we don't care.\n\n            Therefore, for the last action, we can choose any action that doesn't cause us to go out of bounds? but the bounds are [0,9]. \n\n            If we are at 9 and we do U, then we try to go to 10 -> not allowed, so we stay at 9? \n            Or the update rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, but clamped to [0,9]. \n\n            So if we do U at 9, we stay at 9.\n\n            Similarly, D: to 8, S: stay.\n\n            So it doesn't matter.\n\n            Therefore, in our BFS, we stop when we reach a state (t,9) for some t, and then we output the actions for turns8 to turn t-1? \n\n            But the sequence must have H = t - 8 + 1? \n\n            Let me see: \n                turn8: state (8,6) -> we take an action a8 to go to (9,y9)\n                ...\n                turn t-1: we take an action a_{t-1} to go to (t,y_t)\n\n                We require that at the beginning of turn t, we are at 9.\n\n                So the number of actions is (t-1) - 8 + 1 = t - 8.\n\n                But the problem says the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1, and H = number of actions.\n\n                So H = t - 8.\n\n                And we require that at turn8+H-1 = 8+(t-8)-1 = t-1, we are at 9? \n                But we are at 9 at turn t, not at turn t-1.\n\n            This is not matching.\n\n            Let me try with the path we had initially: \n                We want to be at 9 at turn10: that is, at the beginning of turn10, y10=9.\n                How many actions have we taken? \n                    actions at turn8 and turn9: 2 actions.\n                Then H=2.\n                turn8+H-1 = 8+2-1=9, but we require y9=9? \n                In this scenario, at turn9 we are at y9=8 (because we did U at turn8: 6->7? wait, then at turn9 we are at 7, then U at turn9: 7->8 at turn10) -> so at turn9 we are at 7, not 9.\n\n            How to achieve y9=9? \n                We need to go from 6 at turn8 to 9 at turn9 with one action? -> impossible.\n\n            How to achieve y10=9? \n                We need two actions: \n                    a8 and a9 such that 6 + a8 + a9 = 9.\n                But a8 and a9 are in { -1,0,1 } -> maximum +2.\n\n            Therefore, it takes three actions to achieve y11=9.\n\n            Then H=3.\n            And we require y_{8+3-1}=y10=9? -> no, we have y11=9.\n\n            But the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n            So for H=3, we require y10=9.\n\n            We have a contradiction.\n\n            Let me read the problem again: \n                \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n                and then in the game dynamics: \n                    y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\n                and then the goal: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\n            This means: at the beginning of turn (t1+H-1), we are at 9.\n\n            But our simulation shows that to get to 9, we need three actions and we arrive at turn11.\n\n            So then we would require:\n                y_{8+H-1}=9.\n\n                and we arrive at turn11=8+3, so 8+H-1=11 -> H=4.\n\n            Then the sequence would be actions at turns8,9,10,11? but then at the beginning of turn11, we are at y11=9.\n\n            But how did we get to y11? \n                y11 = y10 + a10_{}\n                and we require y_{11}=9.\n\n            So the action at turn11 is not used to get to 9? because we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn11.\n\n            This is even more confusing.\n\n            After re-thinking, I think there is a misunderstanding in the indexing.\n\n            Let the initial turn be t1 = turn8.\n            We take actions at turns: turn8, turn9, ... up to turn8+H-1.\n            The state at turn8 is given.\n            After action at turn8, we are at state (turn9, y9).\n            ...\n            After action at turn8+H-1, we are at state (turn8+H, y_{8+H}).\n\n            But the problem requires that at turn8+H-1, we are at 9. \n                This must be the state before taking the action at turn8+H-1.\n\n            So how can that be? \n                We are at turn8+H-1, and the state is (8+H-1, y_{8+H-1})= (8+H-1,9).\n            Then we take an action a_{8+H-1} to go to (8+H, y_{8+H} = 9 + Delta a_{8+H-1}).\n\n            So the condition is that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn8+H-1.\n\n            Therefore, we do not need the action at turn8+H-1 to be a particular one to stay at 9? because the goal is already met at the beginning of that turn.\n\n            But then why do we take the action? \n\n            The problem requires a sequence of H actions. So we must take an action at turn8+H-1, even though we are already at the goal.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal H is the minimal number of actions such that at the beginning of turn8+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n            How many actions have been taken to get to 9 at the beginning of turn8+H-1? \n                actions taken: from turn8 to turn8+H-2 -> that's H-1 actions.\n\n            Example: \n                H=1: \n                    turn8: at the beginning, we are at 6. We require at the beginning of turn8 ( before any action) to be at 9? -> no.\n                H=2: \n                    require at beginning of turn9 to be at 9.\n                    actions taken: only one action (at turn8) -> can we get from 6 to 9 in one action? no.\n                H=3: \n                    require at beginning of turn10 to be at 9.\n                    actions: two actions (at turn8 and turn9) -> 6 + a8 + a9 = 9 -> a8+a9=3 -> impossible.\n                H=4: \n                    require at beginning of turn11 to be at 9.\n                    actions: three actions (at turn8,9,10) -> 6+a8+a9+a10=9 -> a8+a9+a10=3 -> possible with UUU.\n\n            Therefore, minimal H=4.\n\n            Then the sequence has 4 actions: at turns8,9,10,11.\n\n            And at the beginning of turn11 (8+4-1=11), we are at 9.\n\n            In our BFS, we should therefore aim to be at (11,9) and we have taken actions at turns8,9,10,11.\n\n            But the last action (at turn11) can be chosen arbitrarily (as long as it doesn't cause out of bounds, but at y=9, we can choose U and then stay at 9, or choose S, or choose D to go to 8).\n\n            However, we must avoid collision at turn11: \n                at turn11, we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\n            Therefore, the last action doesn't introduce any collision risk.\n\n            So we can choose, for example, S for the last action.\n\n            Now, let's do BFS with the goal being (t,9) for any t>=8.\n\n            We want the minimal H such that we are at (8+H-1,9) and we have a sequence of H actions.\n\n            But note: the number of actions is H, and the turn at which we achieve 9 is t = 8+H-1.\n\n            So we are doing BFS on state (t,y) and we want to minimize H = t - 8 + 1.\n\n            Since we want minimal H, we want minimal t - 8 + 1, i.e., minimal t.\n\n            We do BFS and we stop at the first time we hit y=9.\n\n            In our earlier BFS, we found (11,9) with actions: \n                turn8: U\n                turn9: U\n                turn10: U\n                turn11: ? (S, for example)\n\n            Then H=4.\n\n            Is there a path that achieves y=9 at an earlier turn? \n\n                We need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11 -> so the earliest turn we can be at 9 is turn11? because with three actions we only can get to 6+3=9, but that would be at turn11 (because: \n                    turn8: action0 -> turn9: state7\n                    turn9: action1 -> turn10: state8\n                    turn10: action2 -> turn11: state9\n                ).\n\n            Therefore, the minimal turn to be at 9 is turn11, so minimal H=4.\n\n            Now, we must avoid collisions on the way.\n\n            The path: \n                state0: (8,6) -> safe (freeway6: dangerous at 10; 8 not in)\n                action0: U\n                state1: (9,7) -> freeway7 at turn9: D_7={8,16,17,18} -> 9 not in -> safe.\n                action1: U\n                state2: (10,8) -> freeway8 at turn10: D_8={12,13,14} -> 10 not in -> safe.\n                action2: U\n                state3: (11,9) -> goal.\n\n            Then we need one more action (action3) for H=4. We can choose any action, say S.\n\n            So the sequence: \n                turn8: U\n                turn9: U\n                turn10: U\n                turn11: S\n\n            But is this valid? \n                At turn11, we are at (0,9) -> safe.\n                Then we do S -> then at turn12 we are still at 9? \n                But we don't care.\n\n            However, note: the problem only requires to output the actions until we reach at turn11, but the last action is at turn11.\n\n            So we output:\n\n                Turn 8: U\n                Turn 9: U\n                Turn 10: U\n                Turn 11: S\n\n            But is there a shorter path in terms of the number of actions? \n                We cannot, because we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11, and it takes three actions (UUU) to go from 6 to 9.\n\n            However, are there other paths that avoid collisions and also achieve 9 at turn11? \n\n            For example, could we do a detour? \n                We might go down initially to avoid a future collision.\n\n            But in this case, the only collision risk on the direct path is at freeway6 at turn10, but we are not there at turn10: at turn10 we are at freeway8, which is safe.\n\n            So the direct path is safe.\n\n            Therefore, the answer is:\n\n                Turn 8: U\n                Turn 9: U\n                Turn 10: U\n                Turn 11: S   (or U or D, but U might be clamped, so S is fine)\n\n            But wait, at turn10 we are at freeway8: we did U from 7 to 8 at turn9, so at turn10 we are at 8. Then we do U at turn10: which is at state (10,8) and then we update to (11,9). \n\n            And then at turn11: we do S.\n\n            This is safe.\n\n            However, note that at turn10, when we are at freeway8, we are safe because 10 is not in {12,13,14}. \n\n            But is there a risk at turn11? \n                We are at y=9, not a freeway, so safe.\n\n            Therefore, the above path is valid.\n\n        However, let's double-check the collision at freeway7 at turn9: \n            freeway7 at turn9: \n                D_7 = {8,16,17,18} -> 9 is not in, so safe.\n\n        freeway8 at turn10: safe.\n\n        But what about freeway6 at turn10? \n            We are not on freeway6 at turn10, so we don't care.\n\n        One more: could we do a path with more turns but still H=4? \n            For example, could we do: \n                turn8: U -> (9,7) safe.\n                turn9: S -> (10,7) -> freeway7 at turn10: dangerous?

We can choose any action. \n        We choose S.\n\n        Final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\n        But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=4.\n\n        However, the user might expect the sequence without the last action? \n\n        But the problem requires a sequence of H actions.\n\n        And H=4.\n\n        Therefore, we include the last action.\n\n        We can also choose to output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\n        or \n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: D\n}\n\n        but that would go to 8 at turn12, which is not required.\n\n        Since the problem does not require to stay at 9, any action is acceptable.\n\n        We'll choose S.\n\n        Let me write the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,8) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0. The x-coordinate is always 0, so we're only moving vertically between y=0 to y=9, but we have to avoid cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8 when we're on those rows.\n\nThe collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway row y_T, and for that row, there's a car whose span includes x=0 at that exact turn. The note says that when you move to a new row, you're not considered on that row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. Since we start at y=8, and 9 is the target, we might be able to go directly to 9 if it's safe.\n\nBut let's see the car states. The cars are on freeways 1 to 8, each with some cars defined by head, tail, direction, and speed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move over time.\n\nThe direction: right-moving means the span is given as [tail, head] I think? Let me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t1 is [h, τ], and at T, it becomes [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car state table, for each car, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nBut in the direction, for left-moving, h and τ are such that h is head, τ is tail? But in the span, for left-moving, it's [h, τ], which might imply h < τ or something? Let's clarify.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet me look at an example. For freeway 1: (-8, -19, right, 4)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving, span at t1 is given as (τ, h) or what?\n\nThe table says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -8, tail τ = -19, direction right, speed 4.\n\nNow, for right-moving, the span is [τ, h] because it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving? No.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the span notation, [a,b] probably means from a to b, and for movement, if direction is right, the car is moving to increasing x, so tail is left, head is right, so τ < h, and span is [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly for left, moving to decreasing x, head is left, tail is right, so h < τ, span [h, τ].\n\nBut in the coordinates, x decreases to the left, I assume.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: head = -8, tail = -19, direction right.\n\n-8 is greater than -19, so if direction right, head should be on the right, so at higher x, so head h = -8, tail τ = -19, since -8 > -19, so τ < h, which is consistent with right-moving: span [τ, h] = [-19, -8]\n\nAt turn T, for right-moving, span becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-19 + 4(T-t1), -8 + 4(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head and tail are such that h < τ.\n\nFor example, freeway 6: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nHead h = -24, tail τ = 11, direction left, so since left-moving, head is left, tail is right, so h < τ, -24 < 11, yes.\n\nSpan at t1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nAt T: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-24 - 36(T-t1), 11 - 36(T-t1)]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nPlayer position at turn T is (0, y_T), and we need 0 to be in the span of some car on row y_T at turn T for collision.\n\nBut only if y_T is between 1 and 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nWe start at turn t1=10, position (0,8).\n\nWe need to reach (0,9).\n\nSince we're at y=8, and we want to go to y=9, we can move up to y=9 if possible.\n\nBut at turn t1=10, we are on y=8, so we need to check if at turn 10, on freeway 8, is there a car that has 0 in its span?\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: let's see the table.\n\nFreeway 8: (-8, -19, right, 4)\n\nOnly one car: head -8, tail -19, direction right, speed 4.\n\nAt turn t1=10, span: since right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-19, -8] at t1.\n\n0 is not in [-19, -8] since -19 to -8, all negative, 0 is not included.\n\nSo at turn 10, on freeway 8, no collision.\n\nNow, if we move up at turn 10, action U, then at turn 11, we would be at y=9.\n\nBut when we move, at turn 10, we perform action, which affects y at turn 11.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t, we are at position (0, y_t), then we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision at turn t if we are on y_t, and for freeway y_t, there is a car with 0 in span at turn t.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1=10, we are at y=8.\n\nWe choose a_t for t from t1 onwards.\n\nt starts from t1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H turns, we are at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nWe start at turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter first action at t1, at turn t1+1, we are at new position.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSince we start at turn t1, after 0 actions, at turn t1, we are at initial position.\n\nAfter 1 action (H=1), at turn t1 +1 -1 = t1, we are at y_t1, but we start at y=8, not 9.\n\nH is the number of actions, so after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nSet t = t1 for initial turn.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nWe choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want y_{t_f} =9 for some turn t_f.\n\nThe sequence of actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, we are at y_{t1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, if we do nothing, at turn t1, y=8, not 9.\n\nIf we move up at t1, then at turn t1+1, y=9.\n\nSo H=1 action, and at turn t1+1, we are at (0,9).\n\nSimilarly, if we stay, y stays, but we need to reach 9.\n\nIn this case, since we start at 8, we can reach 9 in one move if possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid collision during the moves.\n\nNow, in this case, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn, and since y=9 has no cars, it's safe as long as we don't collide while moving to it or something, but collision only happens on freeways 1-8.\n\nSo if we are on y=9, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, back to our situation.\n\nAt turn t1=10, we are at y=8.\n\nIf we choose a_{10} = U, then y_{11} = 8 + 1 =9.\n\nNow, we need to check for collision during the process.\n\nAt turn 10, we are on y=8, which has cars.\n\nFreeway 8: one car, span at t1=10: for right-moving, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] but T=t1=10, so (T-t1)=0, span is [τ, h] = [-19, -8], 0 not in it, so safe.\n\nThen at turn 11, we are on y=9, which is safe.\n\nSo we can reach in one move with action U at turn 10.\n\nBut is that correct?\n\nThe player position at turn 11 is (0,9), and at turn 10, we were on y=8, no collision.\n\nAnd no other turns involved.\n\nSo H=1, action: Turn 10: U\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-8, -19, right, 4)\n\nAt turn 10, span: [-19, -8], 0 not in, yes.\n\nAnd since we move at turn 10, at turn 11 we are on 9.\n\nBut is there any issue with the move?\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you won't be collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut in this case, when we move from y=8 to y=9 at turn 10, at turn 10 we are on y=8, and at turn 11 on y=9.\n\nWe don't care about y=9 cars at turn 10 because we are not on that row.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8 at turn 11, but we are not on it at turn 11.\n\nSo only need to check the row we are on at each turn.\n\nIn this move, only turn 10 we are on y=8, which is safe, and turn 11 on y=9, safe.\n\nSo it seems we can do it in one move.\n\nBut why are there other freeways? Maybe for other positions, but here we start at 8, close to 9.\n\nBut let me check if freeway 8 has cars that might be at 0 at some turn.\n\nAt turn 10, it's not at 0.\n\nThe car on freeway 8: span at T: [-19 + 4(T-10), -8 + 4(T-10)]\n\nSet equal to 0: -19 +4(dt) =0? 4dt=19, dt=19/4=4.75, not integer.\n\n-8 +4dt=0, 4dt=8, dt=2.\n\nAt dt=2, T=12, span [-19+8, -8+8] = [-11,0], so 0 is included? [ -11, 0], 0 is included if it's inclusive.\n\nThe span [a,b], does it include endpoints?\n\nThe collision: if 0 in Span(T), which probably means 0 is between min and max inclusive.\n\nIn this case, at T=12, span [-11,0], so 0 is included, so if player is on freeway 8 at turn 12, collision.\n\nBut we are not at turn 12, we are moving at turn 10.\n\nFor our action, at turn 10, we are on y=8, span [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nThen we move to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, we are on y=9, not 8.\n\nAt turn 11, for freeway 8, span: T=11, dt=1, [-19+4, -8+4] = [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways don't matter since we are only on y=8 at turn 10.\n\nBut in this case, with one move U at t=10, we reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason we cannot.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that we might be forced to go through other rows, but here direct move seems possible.\n\nBut let me check the other cars, maybe on the way, but we don't go through other rows.\n\nStart at y=8, go to y=9 directly.\n\nBut y=9 is the target, no cars.\n\nPerhaps the initial position is on freeway? y=8 is freeway, but at turn 10 it's safe.\n\nAnother thing: the player update, when we move, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y must be in [0,9], so if at y=8, U is ok to 9, D to 7, S stay 8.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, D is invalid? y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if y_t=0, a_t=D would make y_{t+1}= -1, which is not in [0,9], so probably not allowed, or we assume actions are chosen such that y stays within bounds.\n\nSimilarly for y=9, U to 10 not allowed.\n\nBut here we are at 8, U to 9 is fine.\n\nSo for this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut why are there multiple cars listed? For example, freeway 7 has three cars, etc.\n\nPerhaps for this starting position, it's easy, but let me verify if at turn 10, on y=8, it is indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 8: car (-8, -19, right, 4)\n\nAt t=10, span: [-19, -8], min -19, max -8, both negative, 0 not in, yes.\n\nNow, but we start at turn t1=10, and we need to output the action at t1.\n\nSo action: Turn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, position (0,9), done.\n\nH=1.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and sequence.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t1=10.\n\nBut in the task, it says \"current turn is t1\", and here t1=10.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, there is a left-moving car with high speed.\n\nBut since we don't go to other rows, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to wait or something, but no need.\n\nAnother thought: to reach y=9, we need to be on y=9, but we start at y=8, so moving up is the way.\n\nBut let me confirm the vertical axis: y=0 to y=9, player starts at (0,8), want (0,9).\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=8 is freeway.\n\nAt turn 10, on y=8, no car at 0.\n\nSo action U at t=10, go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut the sequence is for turns starting from t1.\n\nAnswer should be Turn 10: U\n\nBut H=1, and sequence has one action.\n\nBut let me see the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nFor this, it should be Turn 10: U\n\nBut I feel like it might be too straightforward, and perhaps I misread the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-8, -19, right, 4)\n\nAt t=10, span [-19,-8], not including 0.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the span includes the endpoints, but 0 not in.\n\nAt what turn does it include 0?\n\nAs I calculated, at T=12, span [-19+8, -8+8] = [-11,0], and 0 is included if [a,b] includes b.\n\nTypically, span [a,b] means a to b inclusive, so yes, at T=12, if player on y=8, collision.\n\nBut we are not at T=12.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nBut for turn 10, no.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 9, but no freeway 9, y=9 is safe.\n\nAnother thing: when we are at y=8 and move to y=9, at the moment of move, but the note says we are not on the new row until next turn.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 10, on other freeways, but we are only on y=8 at that turn.\n\nSo I think H=1 with U is possible.\n\nBut perhaps I should look at the other freeways to see if there is a reason we cannot, but I don't see.\n\nMaybe the player needs to avoid future collisions, but since we reach the goal immediately, no future.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but it's safe.\n\nAnother point: the target is (0,9), and we reach it at turn 11.\n\nThe minimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 6, for example, but we don't care.\n\nPerhaps I misread the initial position.\n\n\"Player Position: (0, 8)\" at turn 10.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me list all cars to be thorough.\n\nFreeway 1: (-8, -19, right, 4) span at t=10: [-19,-8]\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1, (-8,-19,right,4) span [-19,-8]\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: (-24,-35,right,4) and (40,29,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head -24, tail -35? Tail -35, head -24, direction right, so τ=-35, h=-24, so span [ -35, -24] at t=10.\n\n-35 to -24, all negative.\n\nSecond car: (40,29,right,4), head 40, tail 29, so τ=29, h=40, span [29,40], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3, (-24,-35,right,4) and (40,29,right,4), spans [-35,-24] and [29,40], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nDirection left, head h=-24, tail τ=11, so span at t=10: [h, τ] = [-24,11]\n\nAt T, [ -24 -36(dt), 11-36(dt)] where dt=T-10.\n\n0 in span if min <=0<= max.\n\nMin: -24-36dt, max: 11-36dt\n\nSet -24-36dt <= 0 <= 11-36dt\n\nFirst, 0 <= 11-36dt => 36dt <=11, dt <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so dt=0, T=10\n\nAt dt=0, min=-24, max=11, 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nAt T=10, span [-24,11], which includes 0.\n\nBut freeway 6 is y=6.\n\nAt turn 10, if player is on y=6, collision.\n\nBut we are on y=8 at turn 10, not y=6.\n\nSo for us, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (-24,-35,right,4), (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4)\n\nFirst: head -24, tail -35, right, span [-35,-24]\n\nSecond: head 52, tail 41, right, span [41,52]\n\nThird: head 16, tail 5, right, span [5,16]\n\nAll, 0 not in any at t=10.\n\nFreeway 8: (-8,-19,right,4), span [-19,-8]\n\nNone have 0 at t=10 except freeway 6, but we are not on it.\n\nSo for starting at y=8, move up to 9.\n\nThus, action at turn 10: U.\n\nSequence: only one action.\n\nBut the answer format should be for the sequence.\n\nPerhaps H=1, and action a_{t1} = U.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=10.\n\nAt turn 10, we choose action a_{10}.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nWe are done.\n\nMinimal H=1.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that we need to reach exactly at turn t1+H-1 or something, but from the text: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t1 + t.\n\nThen after these actions, at turn (t1 + (H-1)) +1 = t1 + H, position is set.\n\nAfter action a_{t}, at turn t+1, position is updated.\n\nStart: at turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, at turn t1+2, position y_{t1+2}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, then at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nFor example, with H=1, action a_{t1} = U, then at turn t1+1, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we do no action, H=0, but at turn t1, y=8 ≠9, so not reached.\n\nSo H=1 is minimal.\n\nAnd for this, it works.\n\nBut I think I might be missing something because of the complexity of the car states.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, at turn 10, it is safe, but if we stay, it might not be safe later, but we don't stay, we move.\n\nAnother thing: when we move to y=9, is there any car on y=9? No, y=9 is not a freeway, no cars.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the player can only move to adjacent y, but here we do.\n\nOr perhaps we need to consider that to be on y=9, but it's fine.\n\nI think I should proceed.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be: \\boxed{ Turn 10: U }\n\nSince only one action.\n\nBut in the sequence, it might be written as lines.\n\nPerhaps for other positions it's different, but here.\n\nAnother thought: the initial position is (0,8), and we want to reach (0,9), which is adjacent, so if no car on y=8 at that turn, we can move up.\n\nAnd here, no car at x=0 on y=8 at t=10.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 car at other turns to be sure.\n\nCar on y=8: span at T: [-19 +4(T-10), -8 +4(T-10)]\n\nFor T=10: [-19,-8]\n\nT=11: [-15,-4]\n\nT=12: [-11,0]\n\nT=13: [-7,4] etc.\n\nOnly at T=12, it includes 0.\n\nBut we are not on y=8 at T=12.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have cars, but we don't visit them.\n\nFor example, freeway 6 at T=10 has 0 in span, but we are not on y=6.\n\nSo for the player starting at y=8 at t=10, moving up immediately is safe.\n\nThus, minimal H=1, action U at turn 10.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 10: U }\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nIn the text: \"minimal number of turns H\" but it says \"turns\", but in context, H is the number of actions in the sequence.\n\n\"the minimal number of turns H\" and \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so H is the length of the sequence, number of actions.\n\nAnd each action corresponds to a turn.\n\nSo for H=1, one action at turn t1.\n\nThen position at turn t1+1.\n\nReached at turn t1+1.\n\nBut the position is reached after H actions.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps \"turns\" refers to the time steps, but I think H is defined as the number of actions.\n\nTo be precise, let's read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\" — it might be ambiguous.\n\nIn the context: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"turns\" might mean the actions or the time points.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's indexed by t from 0 to H-1 for the actions.\n\nAnd after that, we reach.\n\nFor example, with no action, we are at start, not reached.\n\nWith one action, we reach at next turn.\n\nSo H=1.\n\nI think it's correct for this case.\n\nPerhaps for this specific setup, since we start at 8, and 8 has no car at 0 at t=10, we can go directly.\n\nBut let me see if there is a car on y=8 at t=10.\n\nFreeway 8: only one car, span [-19,-8], not include 0.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the tail and head, for right-moving, [τ, h], and τ and h, with τ < h.\n\nHere τ=-19, h=-8, so min τ, max h.\n\n0 not between.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nI should output the answer.\n\nBut the problem has many cars listed, and for other freeways, but since we don't use them, ok.\n\nPerhaps the player needs to go down or something, but no, to reach 9 from 8, up is direct.\n\nStaying or down would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal is one up.\n\nThus, for this, action U at turn 10.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 10, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 has a span at turn 10 given by the car state \\((-8, -19, \\text{right}, 4)\\). For a right-moving car, the span at turn \\(T\\) is \\([\\tau + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\\), where \\(t_1 = 10\\), \\(\\tau = -19\\), \\(h = -8\\), and \\(s = 4\\). At \\(T = 10\\):\n- Span = \\([-19 + 4(10 - 10), -8 + 4(10 - 10)] = [-19, -8]\\).\n- Since 0 is not in the interval \\([-19, -8]\\), there is no collision at turn 10.\n\nBy choosing action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 10:\n- \\(y_{11} = y_{10} + \\Delta y_{10} = 8 + 1 = 9\\).\n- At turn 11, the player is at (0, 9), which is not a freeway (no cars), so it is safe.\n\nThe sequence involves only one action (\\(H = 1\\)), and the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 11.\n\nNo other sequence can achieve the goal in fewer turns, as \\(H = 0\\) would leave the player at (0, 8), which is not the target. Moving down or staying would increase the number of turns required.\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 1, with the action sequence:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 10: U }",
