Valid moves are:\n1. **D (Down)**: (4,3) \n   - Check: (4,3) is not a wall or occupied by the body. Safe.\n2. **L (Left)**: (3,4)\n   - Check: (3,4) is not a wall or occupied by the body. Safe.\n3. **R (Right)**: (5,4)\n   - Check: (5,4) is not a wall or occupied by the body. Safe.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- (2,1): Cannot be reached in one move (distance too far). Will disappear after this turn, so ignore.\n- (4,1) and (4,2): Both are positive and reachable in future turns. (4,1) has a shorter life span (must be eaten by Turn 16).\n\n### Immediate Goals:\n1. Avoid collisions and traps.\n2. Position the snake to eat (4,1) and (4,2) safely.\n\n### Move Analysis:\n1. **D to (4,3)**:\n   - Next turn, can move D to (4,2) to eat (4,2), then D to (4,1) to eat (4,1). However, this leads to a potential trap at (4,1) where the only escape is left to (3,1), limiting future movement.\n   - Risk: After eating both foods, the snake is long (length 6) and may get trapped in the bottom-left corner.\n\n2. **L to (3,4)**:\n   - Opens up space to maneuver around the left side of the grid.\n   - Next moves could be D to (3,3), then R to (4,3), etc., allowing more flexibility to approach food later.\n   - Safer for long-term survival but delays eating food.\n\n3. **R to (5,4)**:\n   - Moves toward the right side, avoiding immediate food but exploring more space.\n   - Less risky but may miss the opportunity to eat (4,1) before it disappears.\n\n### Optimal Move:\n- **D to (4,3)** is the most aggressive but allows eating both foods quickly. While it risks trapping the snake later, the AI's task is to maximize the immediate score, and this move sets up eating both (4,2) and (4,1) in the next two turns.\n- The alternative moves (L or R) are safer but do not maximize the score as effectively.\n\n### Final Decision:\nGiven the need to maximize score by eating food and the time constraints on (4,1), the best immediate action is to move down to (4,3), setting up to eat (4,2) and (4,1) in subsequent turns.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Cannot move here (collision).\n2. **Down (D)**: (6, 1) \n   - Occupied by an internal wall (6, 1). Cannot move here.\n3. **Left (L)**: (5, 2) \n   - Not occupied by snake or walls. Free to move.\n4. **Right (R)**: (7, 2) \n   - Border wall (x=7). Cannot move here.\n\n### Additional Constraints:\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Current direction is D, so cannot move U (opposite direction).\n- **Valid Moves**: Only L to (5, 2) is possible without immediate death.\n\n### Verification:\n- Moving L to (5, 2) is safe:\n  - (5, 2) is not occupied by the snake or any obstacle.\n  - No walls or borders block this move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only possible move at Turn 32 is **Left (L)** to (5, 2). This avoids collisions and keeps the snake alive. \n\n### Next Steps (for context):\nAfter moving to (5, 2), the snake's head will be at (5, 2), and the body will shift accordingly. The next moves can then be planned to target the food at (3, 1), which is urgent (must be eaten by Turn 34).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",

The food at (3,1) cannot be eaten this turn (not adjacent to head), and moving D leads to a dead end.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{L}",

The snake must move such that the body moves away from (4, 3), making it free.\n2. Then, the head must move onto (4, 3).\n\nFrom the previous thinking model, moving Right at Turn 40 is more efficient to eventually reach the food. Here's the reasoning:\n- Moving Right at Turn 40 to (2, 5) allows the snake to progress toward the food's column (x=4) while also moving the body away from (4, 3) over subsequent turns.\n- Moving Up at Turn 40 to (1, 6) would take longer to reach the food and might not be as efficient.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nAt Turn 40, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (2, 5).

Total length = 13.\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,3): value = +1, life_span = 7\n  - (6,3): value = +1, life_span = 10\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (4,5), Direction R\n\nFrom the current head position (4,5) moving right, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,6)\n   - Check: (4,6) is within bounds, not a wall, not occupied by snake or obstacle.\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,4)\n   - Check: (4,4) is within bounds, not a wall, not occupied by snake or obstacle.\n3. **Right (R)**: (5,5)\n   - Check: (5,5) is within bounds, not a wall, not occupied by snake or obstacle.\n4. **Left (L)**: (3,5)\n   - Invalid: Opposite of current direction (R), and (3,5) is occupied by the snake's body.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (4,6)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves towards the top, away from immediate dangers.\n  - Keeps options open for future moves.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Moves away from both food items.\n  - May lead to being cornered later with limited space to maneuver.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (4,4)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves closer to the food at (4,3).\n  - Can potentially eat (4,3) on the next move.\n- **Cons**:\n  - After eating, the snake grows, which may limit future movements.\n  - Risk of getting trapped if not careful with subsequent moves.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5,5)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves towards the center, providing more space to maneuver.\n  - Can set up a path to reach either food item later.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Doesn't immediately approach any food, delaying potential score increase.\n\n### Considering Food Consumption\n\n- **Food at (4,3)**:\n  - Life span: 7 turns (from turn 43 to 49).\n  - Can be eaten directly if the head moves onto it after the body moves away (but currently not under body).\n- **Food at (6,3)**:\n  - Life span: 10 turns (from turn 43 to 52).\n  - Currently under the tail. To eat, the tail must move away first, then the head can move onto it.\n\n### Potential Sequences\n\n#### Sequence 1: Move D to (4,4), then D to (4,3) to eat\n- Turn 43: D to (4,4)\n- Turn 44: D to (4,3) to eat (4,3)\n  - Snake grows to length 14.\n  - Next moves from (4,3) could be L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n- Risks:\n  - After eating, limited movement options from (4,3).\n  - May lead to being trapped if not careful.\n\n#### Sequence 2: Move R to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then D to (5,3), then R to (6,3) to eat\n- Turn 43: R to (5,5)\n- Turn 44: D to (5,4)\n- Turn 45: D to (5,3)\n- Turn 46: R to (6,3) to eat (6,3)\n- Risks:\n  - After eating (6,3), the only move is D to (6,2), then possibly stuck as (5,2) is occupied.\n\n#### Sequence 3: Move U to (4,6), then L to (3,6), then D to (3,5) (but (3,5) is body)\n- This sequence seems less optimal as it moves away from food and may not lead to scoring.\n\n### Optimal Immediate Move\n\nGiven the risks associated with immediately moving towards food and the potential to get trapped, the safest immediate move is to **move Right (R) to (5,5)**. This move:\n\n- Keeps the snake in a more central position with more options for future moves.\n- Avoids immediate risks of getting trapped after eating.\n- Allows for a more flexible path to approach either food item in subsequent turns.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating the options, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (5,5).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Following this plan, the next action should be **U (up to (5,6))**, as it aligns with the long-term strategy of moving to safer areas and deferring food consumption.\n\n### Immediate Action:\n\\boxed{U}",

Let's examine this carefully:\n\nIf we move D to (1,5):\n- New head position: (1,5)\n- The segment that was at (1,5) (index 9) would move to (1,4)\n- The segment that was at (1,4) (index 10) would move to (1,3)\n- The segment that was at (1,3) (index 11) would move to (2,3)\n- The tail at (2,3) would be removed (since no food is eaten)\n\nThis would result in the head and segment 10 both trying to occupy (1,5) simultaneously, which would be a collision. Therefore, this move is not valid.\n\nSince all possible moves lead to collisions or walls, the only possible conclusion is that the snake has no valid moves in this state and will collide regardless of the chosen action.\n\nHowever, since we must choose an action, and considering that in some snake implementations moving into your own body in this way is allowed (with the body shifting simultaneously), we'll choose the least harmful option:\n\n\\boxed{D}",
