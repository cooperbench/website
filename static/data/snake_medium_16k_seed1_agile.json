Also, there are internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: only one segment, which is the head at (3,3). Head direction is left, so current direction is L. That means the snake is facing left, so it can move left, up, or down, but not right instantly because of no instant reverse. Since it's only one segment, moving left would be fine, but I need to be careful not to hit walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> All food is positive since value is 1, and life span is 10 for all, meaning they disappear after 10 turns, including the current turn, so countdown starts now.\n> \n> Since the snake is only one segment, eating food will increase its length. But I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Current position: head at (3,3), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (left to (2,3)), U (up to (3,4)), or D (down to (3,2)). I cannot move R because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Now, I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are out of bounds. So playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's clarify the grid.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0 and x=7, meaning that if I try to move to x=0 or x=7, it's a wall collision. Similarly for y=0 and y=7. So the valid coordinates are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n> \n> x=0 is a wall, so x=1 is the leftmost playable column? Let's think.\n> \n> Coordinates: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 cannot be moved to. Similarly for y=0 and y=7. So the playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? For example, (1,1) to (6,6) should be playable, but let's confirm.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> (6,1) is at x=6, y=1, which might be on the border? x=6 is playable since x=7 is wall, similarly y=1 is playable. Walls are only at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6 are playable except where there are obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — these are cells that are blocked.\n> \n> So, from above, (5,1) and (6,1) are at y=1, which is not y=0, so not border wall, but obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) x=1 not 0.\n> \n> So playable area: all (x,y) with 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6, except the obstacle cells.\n> \n> Now, snake at (3,3), which is playable.\n> \n> Food at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n> \n> (1,6): x=1,y=6\n> \n> (2,1): x=2,y=1\n> \n> (4,6): x=4,y=6\n> \n> All within bounds.\n> \n> Now, since snake is only one segment, there is no body to collide with, except walls and obstacles.

Check obstacles: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,3) is not in obstacles, and x=2 between 1-6, y=3 between 1-6, so yes.\n> \n> - Up (U) to (3,4): (3,4) — obstacles: (2,4) is an obstacle, but (3,4) is not listed, so should be free. y=4, x=3, not in obstacle list.\n> \n> - Down (D) to (3,2): (3,2) — obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Also, cannot move right (R) to (4,3) because current direction is L, and R is opposite, instant reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So possible actions: L, U, or D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food positions.\n> \n> Food at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n> \n> (1,6) is top-left? y=6 is high, since y=0 is bottom? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top wall. So y=6 is near top.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 is left, x=6 right.\n> \n> So (1,6) is top-left corner, but since x=1 and y=6, not wall, but close to walls.\n> \n> (2,1) is bottom-left area, y=1 near bottom.\n> \n> (4,6) is top-right area, x=4, y=6.\n> \n> Current position (3,3) is center.\n> \n> Now, life span 10, so all food disappears after turn 10, but since current turn is 0, they last until after turn 9? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, life span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning at the start of turn t+N, it might be gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L, at turn t, it has L turns left including this turn. After L turns, it disappears. So if life span is 10 at turn 0, it will be there for turns 0 to 9, and disappear at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, at turn 1, life span becomes 9, etc.\n> \n> But for planning, since we're at turn 0, all food has 10 turns left.\n> \n> Now, snake is short, only head, so I can move freely.\n> \n> But I need to grow the snake to increase score, but also avoid future collisions.\n> \n> Since snake is alone, no self-collision yet.\n> \n> First, let's evaluate the moves.\n> \n> If I move left to (2,3), then from there I can go to various places.\n> \n> Similarly for U or D.\n> \n> But I need to get to food.\n> \n> Also, the grid has obstacles, so I need to navigate around them.\n> \n> List all obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> (2,4) is an obstacle, which is above (2,3).\n> \n> From (2,3), I can go left to (1,3), up to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot, down to (2,2), or right to (3,3), but (3,3) is where I came from, but since no body, it's empty now, so I can go there, but it might not be useful.\n> \n> Similarly, other points.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,6), which is above and left.\n> \n> (1,6) from (3,3) is left and up, but not directly.\n> \n> Distance: from (3,3) to (1,6): delta x = -2, delta y = +3, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly to (2,1): delta x = -1, delta y = -2\n> \n> To (4,6): delta x = +1, delta y = +3\n> \n> All are a few moves away.\n> \n> Since I need to think ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake grows, so I need to consider the body.\n> \n> But now, body is empty, so after eating first food, snake becomes two segments: head and tail.\n> \n> Then movement, etc.\n> \n> Let's consider going for (2,1) first, since it's closer in x, but y is lower.\n> \n> From (3,3), to (2,1): one way is down to (3,2), then left to (2,2), then down to (2,1)? (2,1) is food, but is it safe?\n> \n> (2,1) is not an obstacle, and not wall, so yes.\n> \n> But let's see the path.\n> \n> First, possible moves:\n> \n> Option 1: Move Down (D) to (3,2) at turn 0.\n> \n> Then from (3,2), I can go to (2,1) directly if I move left, but (2,1) is food, so I can eat it.\n> \n> From (3,2), moving left to (2,2) or (2,1)? (2,1) is adjacent? Positions: (3,2) to (2,1) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are same x or y, differ by 1.\n> \n> So from (3,2), adjacent cells: left (2,2), right (4,2), up (3,3), down (3,1)\n> \n> (3,1) is y=1, which is playable, but let's check obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (3,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (2,1) is not adjacent to (3,2); (3,2) to (2,1) is diagonal, not directly reachable in one move. I need to move to (2,2) first or (3,1), but (2,2) is closer to (2,1).\n> \n> So to reach (2,1) from (3,3):\n> \n> One path: D to (3,2), then L to (2,2), then D to (2,1). That's three moves to eat the food at (2,1).\n> \n> At turn 0: move D to (3,2)\n> \n> Turn 1: from (3,2), move L to (2,2)\n> \n> Turn 2: move D to (2,1) and eat food. Snake grows to two segments: head at (2,1), tail at (2,2)? After eating, when head moves to food, snake grows, so new head at (2,1), and tail is added, but since it was one segment, after eating, positions: head was at (2,2) before moving to (2,1)? Let's clarify snake growth.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows: the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the snake gets longer.\n> \n> But initially, only head at (3,3). If I move to (3,2) at turn 0, no food, so snake moves, head to (3,2), no tail, so positions: [(3,2)]\n> \n> Then turn 1, move to (2,2), no food there, so positions: [(2,2)] still only head.\n> \n> Then turn 2, move to (2,1), which has food, so eat it, head to (2,1), and since there was a tail? But before moving, snake was only at (2,2), so after eating, positions become: head at (2,1), and tail at (2,2). So now snake has two segments.\n> \n> Similarly, if I eat earlier.\n> \n> Now, from (3,3), I could go directly towards other food.\n> \n> But (2,1) is close.\n> \n> Another option: go for (1,6).\n> \n> From (3,3) to (1,6): need to go left and up.\n> \n> For example, move L to (2,3) at turn 0.\n> \n> Then from (2,3), I can go U to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle! Cannot. So blocked.\n> \n> (2,4) is obstacle, so from (2,3), I cannot go up.\n> \n> From (2,3), possible moves: L to (1,3), D to (2,2), or R to (3,3), but (3,3) is empty now.\n> \n> L to (1,3) or D to (2,2).\n> \n> (1,3) is playable, not obstacle.\n> \n> Then from (1,3), I can go U to (1,4), then (1,5), then (1,6), but (1,4), (1,5) should be free, no obstacles listed for x=1 except (1,2), so (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) should be free except (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,2) is at y=2, so (1,3) y=3, etc., all free.\n> \n> So path to (1,6): from (3,3) L to (2,3), then L to (1,3), then U to (1,4), U to (1,5), U to (1,6). That's 4 moves to eat, at turn 4.\n> \n> Similarly, to (4,6): from (3,3) I can go U to (3,4), then R to (4,4), then U to (4,5), U to (4,6), but (4,5) and (4,6) are free? Obstacles: (6,4) but not (4,4), etc. So (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) should be free.\n> \n> (4,6) is food.\n> \n> But from (3,3), since direction is L, I can go U to (3,4).\n> \n> Then from (3,4), I can go R to (4,4), then U to (4,5), then U to (4,6). Or from (3,4) I can go U to (3,5), but (3,5) to (4,6) not direct, so better to go to (4,4) first.\n> \n> So path: turn 0 U to (3,4), turn 1 R to (4,4), turn 2 U to (4,5), turn 3 U to (4,6) eat. 4 moves.\n> \n> Now, to (2,1): as before, turn 0 D to (3,2), turn 1 L to (2,2), turn 2 D to (2,1) eat. 3 moves, faster.\n> \n> But after eating (2,1), snake has two segments, head at (2,1), tail at (2,2).\n> \n> Then I need to go to other food.\n> \n> (2,1) is near bottom-left.\n> \n> Food left: (1,6) and (4,6)\n> \n> (1,6) is top-left, (4,6) top-right.\n> \n> From (2,1), I can move to other places.\n> \n> But there might be risks.\n> \n> Since all food has life span 10, and I have time, but I should eat quickly to score and grow, but with growth comes collision risk.\n> \n> But now, with two segments, it's still small.\n> \n> Another thing: internal obstacles, so I need to avoid them.\n> \n> For example, near (2,1), there is obstacle at (1,2) and (2,4) etc.\n> \n> From (2,1), after eating, head at (2,1), tail at (2,2).\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,1): since I moved D to get there, last direction was D, so I can move L, R, or D, but not U (reverse).\n> \n> Last move was D to (2,1), so direction into (2,1) is down, so from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1), R to (3,1), or D to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, cannot. So only L or R.\n> \n> (1,1) or (3,1).\n> \n> (1,1) is playable? x=1,y=1, not wall, not obstacle listed. Obstacles: (1,2) is at y=2, so (1,1) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) not obstacle.\n> \n> If I go L to (1,1), then from there I can go U to (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle! Cannot. So from (1,1), I can only go U? (1,1) adjacent: left? x=0 wall, cannot; right to (2,1) but that's body? Positions: head at (2,1), tail at (2,2), so (2,1) is head, (2,2) is tail.\n> \n> From (1,1), if I go to (1,1), cells: (1,1) is empty, (2,1) is head, (2,2) is tail.\n> \n> So from (2,1), if I move L to (1,1), head to (1,1), tail moves to (2,1)? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, so tail follows.\n> \n> After turn 2: head at (2,1), tail at (2,2)\n> \n> If I move left to (1,1), then new head at (1,1), tail moves to (2,1), so positions: [(1,1), (2,1)]\n> \n> Then from (1,1), I can move: last direction was L, so can move L, U, D, but L to (0,1) wall, cannot; U to (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, cannot; D to (1,0) wall, cannot. Only possible move is R to (2,1), but (2,1) is now the body segment! So moving to (2,1) would be body collision, death.\n> \n> After moving to (1,1), positions are [(1,1), (2,1)], so (2,1) is body.\n> \n> If I try to move from (1,1) to (2,1), it's occupied by body, so collision.\n> \n> And no other moves, so I would be trapped and die if I go to (1,1).\n> \n> Therefore, from (2,1), I cannot move left to (1,1) because it leads to a dead end.\n> \n> Similarly, moving right to (3,1) from (2,1).\n> \n> (3,1) is playable.\n> \n> Then from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2), R to (4,1), or D to (3,0) wall, cannot, so U or R.\n> \n> (3,2) is empty, or (4,1) empty.\n> \n> Then I can go to other areas.\n> \n> But (2,1) is risky because it's near corner with obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go to (1,6), it might be similar, corner.\n> \n> (4,6) is near top, but less cornered.\n> \n> But let's think long term.\n> \n> Another food: (4,6) is also near top, but x=4, not corner.\n> \n> Perhaps I should avoid going to corners early.\n> \n> Since the snake is short, I can go to (2,1) but be careful not to go to (1,1).\n> \n> From (2,1), after eating, I should move right to (3,1) to avoid the dead end.\n> \n> Then from there, I can explore.\n> \n> But let's consider the grid with obstacles.\n> \n> List the grid for visualization.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6.\n> \n> Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So at (1,2): obstacle\n> \n> (2,4): obstacle\n> \n> (5,1): obstacle\n> \n> (6,1): obstacle\n> \n> (6,4): obstacle\n> \n> Free cells except these.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,6), (2,1), (4,6)\n> \n> (2,1) is food, but near obstacles.\n> \n> At turn 0, from (3,3), if I move D to (3,2), then L to (2,2), then D to (2,1) to eat at turn 2.\n> \n> But after that, at (2,1), with tail at (2,2), I must move to (3,1) to avoid dead end.\n> \n> Move to (3,1) at turn 3.\n> \n> Then from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2) or R to (4,1).\n> \n> (3,2) is free, but was tail?

So when it eats food, it will grow.\n> \n> Snake head direction: R, so moving right.\n> \n> Current position: (4,4)\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So let's map the grid.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — these are obstacles, so snake cannot move there.\n> \n> Food at: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6), (5,4)\n> \n> (5,4) is a food, but snake is at (4,4), head direction R, so if it moves right to (5,4), it would eat the food.\n> \n> But (5,4) is also a food position, but is it under the snake? Snake is only at (4,4), so (5,4) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Snake positions are given, so only (4,4) is occupied by snake, so (5,4) has food, not under snake.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells are free except obstacles.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action sequence for turn 2, turn 3, etc., thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (4,4) with direction R.\n> \n> Can move U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But no instant reverse, so since current direction is R, cannot move L (left) because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, R (not L).\n> \n> Now, check if they are valid:\n> \n> - R: to (5,4). What is at (5,4)? It has food with value +1, life_span 9. Also, is it a wall? No, walls are at (6,4) etc., but (5,4) is not listed as wall or obstacle. Obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (5,4) is free. So moving R to (5,4) is possible, and it has food.\n> \n> - U: to (4,5). Is that valid? (4,5) is within bounds, x=4 y=5, between 1-6, and not an obstacle. No food mentioned, so empty.\n> \n> - D: to (4,3). Similarly, should be empty and valid.\n> \n> Now, if I move R to (5,4), I eat the food. Since snake has only head, eating food will make the snake grow to length 2. After moving to (5,4), the head is there, and since it ate, a new segment is added, so positions become [(5,4), (4,4)] or something? When snake moves, head moves to new position, and if it eats, tail doesn't move, so new segment added at tail.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, so the tail stays, and snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Here, snake is only head, so after eating, it will have head and one body segment.\n> \n> Sequence: on turn 2, move to new cell; if that cell has food, eat it, then snake grows: the new head position, and the previous position becomes body.\n> \n> So if move R to (5,4), which has food, so eat it, reward +1, snake now has positions: head at (5,4), and body at (4,4). Length 2.\n> \n> Then next turn, direction is now R? Head direction after move is the direction moved, I assume.\n> \n> The state gives current head direction, which is R at turn 2.\n> \n> After moving, for next turn, the head direction is set to the move direction.\n> \n> In the rules, it says \"Snake Head Direction\" for the current state, so after each move, it updates.\n> \n> Now, if I move R, I eat immediately, but is there any danger? Tail reward danger: but since snake has no tail yet, only head, so no issue. Tail reward danger is when head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here no tail, so safe.\n> \n> But after eating, the body is at (4,4), head at (5,4).\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list all food and their positions:\n> \n> - Food at (1,6): value +1, life_span 8 (from turn 2)\n> \n> - (2,1): +1, life_span 8\n> \n> - (4,6): +1, life_span 8\n> \n> - (5,4): +1, life_span 9\n> \n> (5,4) is close, at (5,4), which is adjacent right to current position.\n> \n> Also, (4,6) is above, (1,6) top-left, (2,1) bottom-left.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> (2,4) is obstacle, which is left of current? Current (4,4), (2,4) is at x=2,y=4, so west, but not adjacent.\n> \n> (6,4) is east, (5,1) south, etc.\n> \n> Now, since I need to maximize score, I should eat food, but avoid risks.\n> \n> Thinking long-term.\n> \n> If I eat (5,4) now, I get +1, snake grows to length 2.\n> \n> Then from there, I need to move.\n> \n> But let's see the grid to plan a path.\n> \n> Sketch a grid mentally:\n> \n> Rows y=6 to y=1, columns x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> y=6: top, y=1 bottom, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> Current: (4,4)\n> \n> Food: (1,6) top-left, (2,1) bottom-left, (4,6) top-middle, (5,4) right-middle\n> \n> Obstacles: (6,4) right, same y as current, x=6,y=4\n> \n> (5,1) bottom-right, x=5,y=1\n> \n> (2,4) left, x=2,y=4\n> \n> (6,1) bottom-right, x=6,y=1\n> \n> (1,2) top-left, x=1,y=2\n> \n> Also borders are walls.\n> \n> Now, from (4,4), if I move R to (5,4), I eat food, snake to [(5,4), (4,4)], head at (5,4) direction R.\n> \n> Then next turn, from (5,4), possible moves: U (to (5,5)), D (to (5,3)), L (to (4,4), but (4,4) is now body, so if I move L, head to (4,4) which is body, collision, die. So cannot move L.\n> \n> R: to (6,4), but (6,4) is an obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> So from (5,4), after eating, moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,5)\n> \n> - D: to (5,3)\n> \n> - R: invalid, obstacle\n> \n> - L: invalid, body\n> \n> So only U or D.\n> \n> If I go U to (5,5), empty? No food, so move, no eat, snake moves, head to (5,5), tail moves to head old position? When not eating, head moves, tail moves forward, so body segments follow.\n> \n> After eating at turn 2: snake positions [(5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> Turn 3, move U to (5,5): not food, so head to (5,5), and tail moves from (4,4) to? The last segment is removed, so positions: head (5,5), and body? Since only one body segment, it was at (4,4), but when head moves to (5,5), the body should be at (5,4), I think.\n> \n> Standard: snake moves, head to new cell, if not eat, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So positions: new head (5,5), and the body segment that was behind moves to where head was?

Since it decreases every turn including current, at turn t, if life span is L, it will last until turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is L, then after this turn (turn t), life span becomes L-1. So it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., up to when life span is 1, and after that turn, it disappears. So with L=7 at turn 3, it can be eaten on turns 3 to 9, and disappears after turn 9? Turn t: life span L, after turn, L-1 for next turn.\n> \n> At the start of turn t, food has life span L. After the turn, if not eaten, life span decreases to L-1 for the next turn. So it can be eaten during turn t when life span is L, and it will have life span L-1 for turn t+1 if not eaten, and so on, until life span 1, eaten or not, after that turn it disappears. So for L=7 at turn 3, it can be eaten on turns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9? Turns: turn 3: life span 7, after turn if not eaten, turn 4: life span 6, ..., turn 9: life span 1, after turn 9, it disappears.

Original body was at (4,4), but when head moves to (5,5), the segment that was at (4,4) moves to where head was, (5,4)? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves in a direction, the head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.

After move: head to (3,6), body segments move: the segment that was at (4,5) moves to (4,6), and tail was (5,5) but since no eat, tail moves: the last segment moves to where the previous segment was, so positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]?

New head (1,6), body segments: (2,6), (3,6), and tail doesn't move, so now snake: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] length 4? Original was 3, after eat, length 4: head at (1,6), and previous segments: (2,6), (3,6), and since tail didn't move, the last segment (4,6) is no longer, but when eating, tail stays, so positions: head (1,6), segment 2 (2,6), segment 3 (3,6), and segment 4 is the new one, but since tail didn't move, the position that was tail is still there, so snake: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] and the previous tail (4,6) is now part of body? No.\n> \n> When snake eats, the head moves to new cell, body remains, tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> Before move: snake at [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] with head (2,6)\n> \n> Move head to (1,6), which has food, so eat: head now (1,6), the body segments remain at (2,6) and (3,6), and since tail didn't move, the tail segment stays at (4,6), but it was at (4,6), and a new segment is added? No, the tail position doesn't change, so the snake now has head at (1,6), then the next segment is (2,6), then (3,6), then tail at (4,6). So positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] length 4.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, from (1,6), I can consider other food, like (2,1).\n> \n> But (2,1) is far, and life span 7, at turn 3, so by turn 8, life span left?

Also, there are internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,5), and the body is at (5,4). Since there's only one body segment, the snake is of length 2. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to reach (5,5) from (5,4) below it.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 10? Wait, the format says (x,y, life_span, value), but in the input it's written as (1,6,6,1) which might be (x,y, life_span, value).

(5,6) has no food, so no eat, snake moves: head to (5,6), tail was (5,4) moves to where? Since no eat, tail moves off (5,4), so new positions: head (5,6), body (5,5)? Original: head (5,5), body (5,4). After move U, head to (5,6), and since no eat, tail moves from (5,4) to... when moving, the body follows, so new head (5,6), and the body segment that was at (5,5) is now the neck, and tail was (5,4), which is abandoned, so new body is just (5,5), since length 2. Snake positions become [(5,6), (5,5)].\n> \n> Similarly, if move L to (4,5): head to (4,5), body to (5,5), so positions [(4,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Or R to (6,5): [(6,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Now, after this move, I need to plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,6) is close, which is up-left from current, or (6,6) up-right.\n> \n> (4,6) is at x=4,y=6, (6,6) at x=6,y=6.\n> \n> Current head (5,5), so to reach (4,6), I could go left then up, or up then left, etc.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,6).\n> \n> But (4,6) and (6,6) are both at y=6, which is one row below wall y=7.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so cells with y=6 are just below wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls.\n> \n> Now, obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, which is below (6,5), etc.\n> \n> I should map the grid.\n> \n> Let me sketch a grid mentally.\n> \n> Rows y from 0 to 7, bottom to top? Usually in grids, y=0 bottom, y=7 top, but in movement, U is y+1, so assuming y increases up.\n> \n> In the movement: U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Similarly, x increases right.\n> \n> So walls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake: head (5,5), body (5,4) — so at row 5, col 5 and 4.\n> \n> Food: (1,6) — x=1,y=6, near top-left\n> \n> (2,1) — x=2,y=1, near bottom-left\n> \n> (4,6) — x=4,y=6, top, between left and center\n> \n> (6,6) — x=6,y=6, top-right\n> \n> All at y=6 or y=1.\n> \n> y=6 is top row below wall, y=1 is above bottom wall.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I want to eat as much food as possible, but avoid dying.\n> \n> Since snake is short, length 2, eating food grows it, which might increase risk of self-collision later.\n> \n> But for now, it's short.\n> \n> Life spans: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6) disappear after turn 9, (6,6) after turn 13.\n> \n> Turn 4 now, so I have about 5 turns to reach them before some disappear.\n> \n> But (6,6) lasts longer.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Let's consider the three possible moves.\n> \n> First, move U to (5,6).\n> \n> Then positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), direction U.\n> \n> From (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7), but y=7 is wall, so (5,7) invalid, collision.\n> \n> L to (4,6), or R to (6,6), or D to (5,5), but (5,5) is body, and it's not tail? Tail is at (5,5), which is the body segment.\n> \n> After move to (5,6), positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), so tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> If I move D to (5,5), that is where tail is, so since it's tail, I can move there because tail will move away if no eat.\n> \n> But at (5,6), is there food? (5,6) has no food, food are at (1,6) etc., not (5,6).\n> \n> So if I move to (5,6), no eat, so when I move, if I go to (5,5), it's the tail cell, and since no eat, tail moves off, so head can move to (5,5) safely? Let's see.\n> \n> Before move, tail at (5,5).\n> \n> If I move head to (5,5), which is current tail position.\n> \n> After move, head is at (5,5), and since no food eaten, the tail moves forward. But in this case, the body was [(5,6), (5,5)] before move? No.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> Start: positions [(5,5), (5,4)] head at (5,5), tail at (5,4)\n> \n> Move U: head to (5,6), no eat, so tail moves from (5,4) to? The snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the next position. So body segment at (5,4) moves to where the head was, which is (5,5)? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,6), the body segment at (5,4) moves to the previous head position (5,5), so new positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), so tail at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, from here, possible moves: U to (5,7) — wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (5,5) — (5,5) is current tail position. Since it's tail, and if I move there, and no food, then after move, head moves to (5,5), but (5,5) was tail, and tail will move to where? When I move head to (5,5), which is the current position of tail, but after the move, the tail will be updated.\n> \n> If I choose to move D from (5,6) to (5,5), that is the cell of the tail.\n> \n> After moving, head is at (5,5), and since no food eaten (assuming), the tail (which was at (5,5)) moves off to the next position, but since the body was only one segment, the tail moves to where the neck was, but in this case, the neck is the head position before move? Let's think.\n> \n> Before move: positions [(5,6), (5,5)] head at (5,6), tail at (5,5)\n> \n> Move D: head to (5,5), which is the tail cell.\n> \n> After moving, the head is now at (5,5), and the body segment (which was at (5,5)) needs to move, but since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the new tail is the segment that was at (5,5), but it moves to follow, but in this case, moving to (5,5) which is now occupied by head, it's messy.\n> \n> Rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So it should be safe, as long as after the move, the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, moving to tail cell is ok because tail moves off.\n> \n> But in terms of position, after moving head to (5,5), which was tail, and since no eat, the tail is removed, so the new snake is just head at (5,5)? No, the body segment was at (5,5), which is now head, so the snake shortens? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is left, and that cell is freed.\n> \n> So in this case, from [(5,6), (5,5)] with head (5,6), tail (5,5)\n> \n> If move D to (5,5), head moves to (5,5), but (5,5) is currently occupied by tail. After move, the head is at (5,5), and the body segment that was at (5,5) is no longer there because it was the tail and not eaten, so it disappears. So new snake is only head at (5,5), but that can't be, because the body segment should move to where the head was, but the head was at (5,6), so the body moves to (5,6)? I think I have it.\n> \n> Positions: let's list the segments.\n> \n> Before move: segment 0: head at (5,6), segment 1: body at (5,5)\n> \n> When moving, new head position: (5,5) for move D.\n> \n> Then, the body segments follow: segment 1 moves to the previous position of segment 0, which is (5,6).\n> \n> But segment 1 was at (5,5), and it moves to (5,6), so new positions: head at (5,5), body at (5,6)? That means the snake reversed.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, the head is moving to (5,5), which was the position of segment 1. But segment 1 is moving to (5,6), so at the time of move, (5,5) is occupied by segment 1, but after move, head is at (5,5), and segment 1 is at (5,6), so no collision, it's safe.\n> \n> The cell is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, in general, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away simultaneously.\n> \n> So from (5,6), moving D to (5,5) is possible and safe.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (4,6) or R to (6,6).\n> \n> (4,6) has food! (4,6) is a food position with value 1.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) has food.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,6) first, from (5,5).\n> \n> At (5,6), no food, so no eat.\n> \n> Then from there, I can move L to (4,6) or R to (6,6), both have food.\n> \n> Or D to (5,5), but (5,5) is where the body is, but after move, it's safe as above.\n> \n> But moving to (4,6) or (6,6) would eat food.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move directly to (4,6) or (6,6) from current position? From (5,5), I can move L to (4,5), then next turn to (4,6), or move U to (5,6), then to (4,6) or (6,6).\n> \n> But moving U to (5,6) first might not be efficient if I want to eat food.\n> \n> Let's list all possible actions for the next few turns.\n> \n> First, I need to choose a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n> \n> Since the food at (4,6) and (6,6) are close, I should try to eat one of them soon.\n> \n> Also, there is (1,6) and (2,1), but they are farther and have shorter life, but still 6 turns left, so I can reach them later.\n> \n> (2,1) is at bottom, might be harder.\n> \n> But let's focus on near food.\n> \n> Option 1: Move L to (4,5) on turn 4.\n> \n> Then at (4,5), no food, so snake moves to [(4,5), (5,5)] head at (4,5), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Then on turn 5, from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6), which has food.\n> \n> Moving to (4,6) eats the food, so snake grows: head to (4,6), and tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (4,6), body (4,5), and the previous body (5,5) becomes part, so segments: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]? After eating, the tail stays, so when head moves to food cell, it eats, so new head at (4,6), and the body is the old head and body, so from [(4,5), (5,5)] before move, move U to (4,6), eat food, so new head (4,6), and body segments: the previous head (4,5) and the previous body (5,5), so positions [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)].\n> \n> Length 3 now.\n> \n> Then from there, I can move to other places.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R first to (6,5), then to (6,6) to eat.\n> \n> Or move U to (5,6), then to (4,6) or (6,6).\n> \n> But moving directly towards food might be faster.\n> \n> Now, also, after eating, the snake is longer, so more body to avoid.\n> \n> But for now, let's think about risks.\n> \n> Another thing: internal obstacles.\n> \n> For example, (6,4) is obstacle, which is below (6,5) and (6,6).\n> \n> If I go to (6,6), I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is near left, with obstacle at (2,4) and (1,2), but not immediate.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: but only if food on tail and head adjacent, not the case now.\n> \n> Now, to think 5 turns ahead, I need to simulate a sequence.\n> \n> Let's assume I go for (4,6) first.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> Turn 4: move L to (4,5)\n> \n> After move: head at (4,5), body at (5,5), direction L.\n> \n> Turn 5: move U to (4,6) — eats food, since (4,6) has food.

After moving head to (3,6), no eat, so the body: segment that was at (4,6) moves to new head position? Standard: new head (3,6), then the first body segment moves to previous head position (4,6), second body segment moves to previous first body position (4,5), and tail was at (5,5), which moves to (4,5)? Let's list.\n> \n> Previous positions: index 0: (4,6) head, index 1: (4,5), index 2: (5,5) tail\n> \n> Move head to (3,6), no eat.\n> \n> New head: (3,6)\n> \n> Then body segment 1 moves to where head was, (4,6)\n> \n> Body segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (4,5)\n> \n> But segment 2 was at (5,5), so it moves to (4,5), but (4,5) is now occupied by segment 1 after move? No: positions update simultaneously.\n> \n> After move, positions: head (3,6), then the body segments are: segment 1 at previous head position (4,6), segment 2 at previous segment 1 position (4,5). But segment 2 was at (5,5), so it moves to (4,5). But (4,5) is the position of segment 1 before move, which is now moving to (4,6)? I think I'm messing up the indices.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake moves, head to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So from positions: S0 = (4,6), S1 = (4,5), S2 = (5,5)\n> \n> After moving head to new position, say P.\n> \n> Then S1 moves to S0's position, S2 moves to S1's position, and so on.\n> \n> So if new head at (3,6), then S1 moves to S0 = (4,6), S2 moves to S1 = (4,5)\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,6), S1 at (4,6), S2 at (4,5)\n> \n> Tail at (4,5)\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (5,6), new head (5,6), S1 at (4,6), S2 at (4,5)\n> \n> Now, back to turn 6.\n> \n> From (4,6), after eating, positions [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Move L to (3,6): new positions head (3,6), body (4,6), body (4,5) — tail at (4,5)\n> \n> Or move R to (5,6): head (5,6), body (4,6), body (4,5) — tail at (4,5)\n> \n> Now, from here, I need to go to other food, like (6,6) or (1,6) or (2,1).\n> \n> (6,6) is at (6,6), which is to the right.\n> \n> If I moved R to (5,6), I am closer to (6,6).\n> \n> Similarly, if I moved L, I am going left.\n> \n> (1,6) is at (1,6), which is left, but there is obstacle at (1,2) and (2,4), but not blocking directly.\n> \n> Also, (2,1) at bottom.\n> \n> But let's consider the life spans.

It's turn 4, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning we can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,5), and the body is at (5,4). Since there's only one body segment, the snake is of length 2. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to reach (5,5) from (5,4) below it.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 10? Wait, the format says (x,y, life_span, value), but in the input it's written as (1,6,6,1) which might be (x,y, life_span, value). Let me confirm.\n> \n> It says: (1, 6, 6, 1) – I think this is (x=1, y=6, life_span=6, value=1)\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1,6,1) is (2,1) with life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> (4,6,6,1) is (4,6) with life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> (6,6,10,1) is (6,6) with life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they are all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: For (1,6), life_span=6, and it's turn 4, so it will disappear after turn 4 + 6 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So if life_span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts until turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if a food has life_span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life_span L, after one turn (turn t+1), life_span becomes L-1, and when life_span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, after turn t, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until L=0, then it disappears. So the food is present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, inclusive? Let's see.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life_span is L. After turn t is executed, life_span decreases by 1 to L-1. If L-1 >0, it remains; if L-1=0, it disappears after turn t.\n> \n> Similarly, on turn t+1, if life_span was L-1, after turn t+1, it decreases to L-2, etc.\n> \n> So for a food with life_span L at turn t, it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears after turn t + L - 1, meaning not available on turn t + L.\n> \n> But for movement planning, we need to know when it will be gone.\n> \n> In this case, turn t=4.\n> \n> Food at (1,6): life_span=6, so it will be present until turn 4 + 6 - 1 = 9? Let's calculate:\n> \n> At turn 4, life_span=6\n> \n> After turn 4, life_span becomes 5 (still present)\n> \n> After turn 5, life_span=4\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 9, life_span=0, disappears, so not available on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1): life_span=6, same as above, disappears after turn 9.\n> \n> (4,6): life_span=6, disappears after turn 9.\n> \n> (6,6): life_span=10, so at turn 4, life_span=10, disappears after turn 13 (since 4+10-1=13? After turn t, life_span decreases.\n> \n> Turn 4: life_span=10, present\n> \n> After turn 4: life_span=9\n> \n> After turn 5: life_span=8\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 13: life_span=0, disappears, so available until turn 13 inclusive? After turn 13, it disappears, so on turn 14, it's gone.\n> \n> But for eating, we care about when we can move to it.\n> \n> Now, snake: head at (5,5), body at (5,4), so tail is at (5,4). Head direction is U, so it came from below, moving up.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is U, so cannot move D (down) on this turn. So possible moves: U, L, R. D is invalid because it would be reverse.\n> \n> Grid: walls at borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - All (0,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (7,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,0) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,7) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> But since it's borders, cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So snake cannot move to these cells.\n> \n> Current snake position: head (5,5), body (5,4). Since body is at (5,4), and it's the tail, if the snake moves, the tail will move, so (5,4) might be free after move, but only if the snake doesn't eat food.\n> \n> If snake eats food, it grows, so tail stays, else tail moves.\n> \n> But for movement, when we move the head, if we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the new position is added, and tail remains. If no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves off the old tail cell.\n> \n> In terms of collision, after moving, the head should not collide with any body segment except the tail, because when moving, if head moves to a cell that was tail, and if tail moves away, it's ok, but only if it's the current tail position before move.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, head can move to tail cell only if after move, the tail moves, so no collision.\n> \n> If head moves to a body cell that is not tail, it collides and dies.\n> \n> Also, if head moves to wall or obstacle, dies.\n> \n> Now, food: all food is positive, value +1, so eating increases length by 1.\n> \n> But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,4). Head at (5,5), so adjacent cells to tail: tail at (5,4), adjacent are (5,5) head, (5,3), (4,4), (6,4). But (6,4) is an obstacle, so not available. (5,3) might be free, (4,4) might be free.\n> \n> But the danger is if the tail cell has food, which it doesn't now. Food is at other places.\n> \n> No food on tail cell, so no issue now.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (5,5), direction U.\n> \n> Can move: U, L, R (not D, reverse invalid)\n> \n> Move U: to (5,6)\n> \n> Is (5,6) valid? y=6, not wall (y=7 is wall, but (5,6) is inside, y=6<7, x=5 between 1 and 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=5 is fine, y=6 is fine, not wall. Obstacles: internal, (5,6) is not in obstacle list: obstacles are (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2), so (5,6) clear. But is it body? Body is at (5,4), not (5,6). So (5,6) is empty, I assume, since no food or obstacle.\n> \n> Grid has cells not mentioned are free, I think.\n> \n> So move U to (5,6) is possible.\n> \n> Move L: left to (4,5)\n> \n> (4,5): x=4,y=5, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2), (4,5) not there, not body, so free.\n> \n> Move R: right to (6,5)\n> \n> (6,5): x=6,y=5, not border, obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, but (6,5) is different, not in list. List has (6,4), not (6,5). So (6,5) should be free.\n> \n> But (6,4) is obstacle, so (6,5) is adjacent, but not obstacle itself.\n> \n> Similarly, no body there.\n> \n> So all three moves possible: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, food locations: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6), (6,6)\n> \n> (1,6) is top-left, (2,1) bottom-left, (4,6) top-middle, (6,6) top-right.\n> \n> Snake at (5,5), so (4,6) is close, (6,6) close, (1,6) far, (2,1) far.\n> \n> Life spans: all except (6,6) have life_span 6, so disappear after turn 9. (6,6) has life_span 10, disappear after turn 13.\n> \n> Since we need to think ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n> \n> But first, let's consider immediate moves.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,6), what happens? (5,6) has no food, so no eat, snake moves: head to (5,6), tail was (5,4) moves to where? Since no eat, tail moves off (5,4), so new positions: head (5,6), body (5,5)? Original: head (5,5), body (5,4). After move U, head to (5,6), and since no eat, tail moves from (5,4) to... when moving, the body follows, so new head (5,6), and the body segment that was at (5,5) is now the neck, and tail was (5,4), which is abandoned, so new body is just (5,5), since length 2. Snake positions become [(5,6), (5,5)].\n> \n> Similarly, if move L to (4,5): head to (4,5), body to (5,5), so positions [(4,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Or R to (6,5): [(6,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Now, after this move, I need to plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,6) is close, which is up-left from current, or (6,6) up-right.\n> \n> (4,6) is at x=4,y=6, (6,6) at x=6,y=6.\n> \n> Current head (5,5), so to reach (4,6), I could go left then up, or up then left, etc.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,6).\n> \n> But (4,6) and (6,6) are both at y=6, which is one row below wall y=7.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so cells with y=6 are just below wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls.\n> \n> Now, obstacles: (6,4) is obstacle, which is below (6,5), etc.\n> \n> I should map the grid.\n> \n> Let me sketch a grid mentally.\n> \n> Rows y from 0 to 7, bottom to top? Usually in grids, y=0 bottom, y=7 top, but in movement, U is y+1, so assuming y increases up.\n> \n> In the movement: U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Similarly, x increases right.\n> \n> So walls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake: head (5,5), body (5,4) — so at row 5, col 5 and 4.\n> \n> Food: (1,6) — x=1,y=6, near top-left\n> \n> (2,1) — x=2,y=1, near bottom-left\n> \n> (4,6) — x=4,y=6, top, between left and center\n> \n> (6,6) — x=6,y=6, top-right\n> \n> All at y=6 or y=1.\n> \n> y=6 is top row below wall, y=1 is above bottom wall.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I want to eat as much food as possible, but avoid dying.\n> \n> Since snake is short, length 2, eating food grows it, which might increase risk of self-collision later.\n> \n> But for now, it's short.\n> \n> Life spans: (1,6), (2,1), (4,6) disappear after turn 9, (6,6) after turn 13.\n> \n> Turn 4 now, so I have about 5 turns to reach them before some disappear.\n> \n> But (6,6) lasts longer.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Let's consider the three possible moves.\n> \n> First, move U to (5,6).\n> \n> Then positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), direction U.\n> \n> From (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7), but y=7 is wall, so (5,7) invalid, collision.\n> \n> L to (4,6), or R to (6,6), or D to (5,5), but (5,5) is body, and it's not tail?

(5,6) has no food, food are at (1,6) etc., not (5,6).\n> \n> So if I move to (5,6), no eat, so when I move, if I go to (5,5), it's the tail cell, and since no eat, tail moves off, so head can move to (5,5) safely? Let's see.\n> \n> Before move, tail at (5,5).\n> \n> If I move head to (5,5), which is current tail position.\n> \n> After move, head is at (5,5), and since no food eaten, the tail moves forward. But in this case, the body was [(5,6), (5,5)] before move? No.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> Start: positions [(5,5), (5,4)] head at (5,5), tail at (5,4)\n> \n> Move U: head to (5,6), no eat, so tail moves from (5,4) to? The snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the next position. So body segment at (5,4) moves to where the head was, which is (5,5)? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,6), the body segment at (5,4) moves to the previous head position (5,5), so new positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), so tail at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, from here, possible moves: U to (5,7) — wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (5,5) — (5,5) is current tail position. Since it's tail, and if I move there, and no food, then after move, head moves to (5,5), but (5,5) was tail, and tail will move to where? When I move head to (5,5), which is the current position of tail, but after the move, the tail will be updated.\n> \n> If I choose to move D from (5,6) to (5,5), that is the cell of the tail.\n> \n> After moving, head is at (5,5), and since no food eaten (assuming), the tail (which was at (5,5)) moves off to the next position, but since the body was only one segment, the tail moves to where the neck was, but in this case, the neck is the head position before move? Let's think.\n> \n> Before move: positions [(5,6), (5,5)] head at (5,6), tail at (5,5)\n> \n> Move D: head to (5,5), which is the tail cell.\n> \n> After moving, the head is now at (5,5), and the body segment (which was at (5,5)) needs to move, but since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the new tail is the segment that was at (5,5), but it moves to follow, but in this case, moving to (5,5) which is now occupied by head, it's messy.\n> \n> Rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So it should be safe, as long as after the move, the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, moving to tail cell is ok because tail moves off.\n> \n> But in terms of position, after moving head to (5,5), which was tail, and since no eat, the tail is removed, so the new snake is just head at (5,5)? No, the body segment was at (5,5), which is now head, so the snake shortens? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is left, and that cell is freed.\n> \n> So in this case, from [(5,6), (5,5)] with head (5,6), tail (5,5)\n> \n> If move D to (5,5), head moves to (5,5), but (5,5) is currently occupied by tail. After move, the head is at (5,5), and the body segment that was at (5,5) is no longer there because it was the tail and not eaten, so it disappears. So new snake is only head at (5,5), but that can't be, because the body segment should move to where the head was, but the head was at (5,6), so the body moves to (5,6)? I think I have it.\n> \n> Positions: let's list the segments.\n> \n> Before move: segment 0: head at (5,6), segment 1: body at (5,5)\n> \n> When moving, new head position: (5,5) for move D.\n> \n> Then, the body segments follow: segment 1 moves to the previous position of segment 0, which is (5,6).\n> \n> But segment 1 was at (5,5), and it moves to (5,6), so new positions: head at (5,5), body at (5,6)? That means the snake reversed.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, the head is moving to (5,5), which was the position of segment 1. But segment 1 is moving to (5,6), so at the time of move, (5,5) is occupied by segment 1, but after move, head is at (5,5), and segment 1 is at (5,6), so no collision, it's safe.\n> \n> The cell is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, in general, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away simultaneously.\n> \n> So from (5,6), moving D to (5,5) is possible and safe.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (4,6) or R to (6,6).\n> \n> (4,6) has food!

After eating, the tail stays, so when head moves to food cell, it eats, so new head at (4,6), and the body is the old head and body, so from [(4,5), (5,5)] before move, move U to (4,6), eat food, so new head (4,6), and body segments: the previous head (4,5) and the previous body (5,5), so positions [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)].\n> \n> Length 3 now.\n> \n> Then from there, I can move to other places.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R first to (6,5), then to (6,6) to eat.\n> \n> Or move U to (5,6), then to (4,6) or (6,6).\n> \n> But moving directly towards food might be faster.\n> \n> Now, also, after eating, the snake is longer, so more body to avoid.\n> \n> But for now, let's think about risks.\n> \n> Another thing: internal obstacles.\n> \n> For example, (6,4) is obstacle, which is below (6,5) and (6,6).\n> \n> If I go to (6,6), I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is near left, with obstacle at (2,4) and (1,2), but not immediate.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: but only if food on tail and head adjacent, not the case now.\n> \n> Now, to think 5 turns ahead, I need to simulate a sequence.\n> \n> Let's assume I go for (4,6) first.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> Turn 4: move L to (4,5)\n> \n> After move: head at (4,5), body at (5,5), direction L.\n> \n> Turn 5: move U to (4,6) — eats food, since (4,6) has food.

After moving head to (3,6), no eat, so the body: segment that was at (4,6) moves to new head position?

So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,6), then body at (6,5), and tail at (5,5). So the snake has 3 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved up to (6,6) from (6,5), I assume. Direction U means it's facing upwards.\n> \n> Food positions with value and life span:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> All food is positive since value is +1. Life span is 4 for each, meaning they disappear after 4 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 6, life span is 4, so they'll be gone by turn 9? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including the current one. So at turn t, a food with life span N will disappear after N turns, meaning it lasts from turn t to turn t + N - 1? Let's see:\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so:\n> \n> - Turn t: life span N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: life span N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + N - 1: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: gone\n> \n> Since it decreases on the current turn, at turn t, it has N turns left including t. After N turns, it's gone. So for turn 6, life span 4, it will be there until turn 9? Turn 6: life span 4, turn 7: life span 3, turn 8: life span 2, turn 9: life span 1, then turn 10 it disappears. But life span decreases every turn including current, so:\n> \n> - Start of turn t: life span L\n> \n> - After turn t, life span decreases to L-1 for next turn.\n> \n> But for eating, we consider when the head moves onto it.\n> \n> In this case, turn 6, food has life span 4, so it will be present for 4 more turns: turns 6,7,8,9.

But current direction is U, so I cannot instantly reverse to D. So next move cannot be D.\n> \n> So from head at (6,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.

So (6,5) is the second segment, which is the body. Moving to (6,5) would cause collision because head touches body, except for the tail under certain conditions.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail if it moves away or something. But generally, moving to a cell occupied by body is deadly, but when moving to the tail, since tail moves, it might be safe if the tail is leaving that cell.\n> \n> Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment other than the tail is collision.

No negative food mentioned here. Life spans: the first three have life span 3, meaning they'll disappear after 3 turns including this one, so after turn 9 or 10? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn. So at turn t, life span N; turn t+1, N-1; ... turn t + (N-1), life span 1; then at turn t + N, it disappears.

Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,5) should be free unless it's an obstacle. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (5,5) is not an obstacle. So D to (5,5) is possible.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (4,6). (4,6) has food, and it's not occupied by snake body? Snake body is at (6,6) and (6,5), so (4,6) is free except for the food. But food can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (6,6). But (6,6) is the body segment. Moving into body segment causes collision. Also, since direction is L, R is reverse, which is not allowed anyway. So R is invalid for two reasons.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (5,5) or L to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, L to (4,6) would eat the food since (4,6) has positive food. Eating it would increase length by 1.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Current tail is at (6,5). Head is at (5,6), which is adjacent? (5,6) and (6,5) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (5,6) and (6,5) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. So not adjacent.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,5), head at (5,6). Possible adjacent cells to tail: left (5,5)? (6,5) left is (5,5), down (6,4) but (6,4) is obstacle, right (7,5) but x=7 wall, up (6,6) but (6,6) is body, not tail. Tail is at (6,5), so adjacent cells: (6,6) above, which is body; (6,4) below, obstacle; (5,5) left; (7,5) right, wall. So only possible adjacent free cell might be (5,5), but head is at (5,6), not at (5,5). So head is not adjacent to tail currently.\n> \n> Therefore, no immediate tail reward danger.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (4,6), I eat the food, length becomes 4. Then the new segment will be added, but where? When you eat food, the snake grows, so after moving to (4,6), head is there, body segments follow. Current snake: positions [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]. After moving head to (4,6), the body will move: the segment that was at (5,6) moves to where head was? Standard snake: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So from [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5)], head moves to (4,6), so new positions: head (4,6), then the first body segment moves to old head position (5,6), second body segment moves to old first body position (6,6), and tail stays? No: the tail (6,5) will move to where the second body was, which is (6,6). But since we ate food, we add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move, and we add a new segment at the end.\n> \n> Sequence: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail moves away.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food, new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays, and body segments adjust.\n> \n> In this case: current positions: index 0: head (5,6), 1: body (6,6), 2: tail (6,5).\n> \n> Move head to (4,6). Since we eat food, we add a new segment. So new head: (4,6). Then body: segment 1 moves to where head was, (5,6). Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (6,6). And new segment is added at the previous tail position, so (6,5) now has a new segment, and tail is still (6,5)? No.\n> \n> Typically, the new segment is added at the position where the tail was before moving, but since the tail would have moved if not eating, but when eating, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> After move: head at (4,6), body segments: the segment that was at index 1 moves to (5,6), segment that was at index 2 moves to (6,6), and a new segment is added at (6,5), so positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)].\n> \n> (6,5) is the new tail.\n> \n> Before move, tail was (6,5). After eating, new tail is (6,5) with the new segment? (6,5) was tail, now it's part of body, and new tail is added at (6,5)? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when not eating, head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) leaves its position.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food, each segment moves as above, but instead of the tail leaving, a new segment is placed where the tail was, so the tail position stays occupied, and the snake grows.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - Before move: positions A: (5,6), B: (6,6), C: (6,5) with C tail.\n> \n> - After moving left to (4,6) and eating:\n> \n> - New head: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment B moves to A's position: (5,6)\n> \n> - Segment C moves to B's position: (6,6)\n> \n> - New segment added at C's old position: (6,5)\n> \n> So new positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) with (6,5) as tail.\n> \n> (6,5) is the tail, and it's occupied.\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> From (5,6), I can move to (4,6) and eat food, or move down to (5,5).\n> \n> If I move to (4,6), I get +1 score, length 4.\n> \n> Then from there, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> I also need to consider other food and their life spans.\n> \n> Food at (1,6) with life span 3, so available turns 7,8,9.\n> \n> (2,1) life span 3, turns 7,8,9.\n> \n> (4,6) life span 3, turns 7,8,9.

Head direction is L, which is left, so it's moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 2 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 2 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Current turn is t=8.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead.

These are like walls; I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake: head at (4,6), body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). So the tail is at (6,5).\n> \n> Head direction is L, so last move was left to (4,6) from (5,6)? Positions: head (4,6), next is (5,6), so it came from right, moving left to (4,6). Since head direction is L, it's facing left.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But I cannot do an instant reverse. Since head direction is L, I cannot move R immediately because that would be opposite. So possible moves from current position: U, D, L. R is not allowed because it's opposite to current direction L.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,6)\n> \n> Possible next positions:\n> \n> - U: (4,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: (4,5) – is this valid? Let's check walls and body.\n> \n> - L: (3,6) – left, x decreases.\n> \n> - R: (5,6) but (5,6) is body segment, and also R is opposite to L, so not allowed.\n> \n> First, movement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction L, so cannot move R.\n> \n> Now, check each direction:\n> \n> - U: (4,7) – y=7 is border wall, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (4,5) – what is this cell? Not a wall? Borders: x=0,7 y=0,7 are walls. (4,5) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) – none at (4,5). Snake positions: (4,6) head, (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) – so (4,5) is not occupied by body. So (4,5) seems free.\n> \n> - L: (3,6) – similar, not wall, not body. Body: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) – (3,6) not there. Internal obstacles not at (3,6). So free.\n> \n> - R: (5,6) – but (5,6) is a body segment, and moving there would cause collision. Also, R is opposite to L, so double invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves from current: D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n> \n> I need to think about the food.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (1,6) life span 2, value 1\n> \n> - (2,1) life span 2, value 1\n> \n> - (4,1) life span 9, value 1\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 8, life span 2 means it will disappear after 2 more turns? Life span is given at current state.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,6), life span 2 at turn 8, meaning after turn 8, it will have life span 1, and after turn 9, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 8 or 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) life span 2, same, disappears after turn 9.\n> \n> (4,1) life span 9, so it will last a long time.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan moves to eat food safely.\n> \n> Also, consider Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (6,5). Is there food on tail? Food positions are (1,6), (2,1), (4,1) – none on (6,5), so no issue now. But I should be careful if food spawns under tail.\n> \n> Now, let's think about paths.\n> \n> Current head at (4,6). Possible moves: D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n> \n> If I go L to (3,6), that's moving left.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go to (2,6), (3,7), (3,5), etc., but need to avoid walls.\n> \n> (3,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> (3,5): down, or (2,6) left, or (4,6) right but (4,6) is now body? After moving to (3,6), the snake will be: head (3,6), body (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), and tail (6,5) will move to (6,6)? When snake moves, the tail moves forward only if not eating, but when it eats, tail doesn't move, it grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so tail stays; when you don't eat, tail moves with head.\n> \n> In this case, if I don't eat food, the tail moves.\n> \n> In movement: if head moves to a cell without food, the tail moves one step, so the snake shifts.\n> \n> If head moves to food, tail doesn't move, snake grows by one.\n> \n> Now, no food at (4,5) or (3,6), so if I move to either, no eating, so tail will move.\n> \n> Current positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]\n> \n> If I move to (4,5), new head (4,5), then body: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), and tail (6,5) moves?

Walls: internal obstacles at (2,4), but (2,6) is not listed, so should be free.

Turn 9: if eaten, fine; turn 10: life span 7, etc., until turn 16: life span 1, eaten or disappears after turn 16.\n> \n> Since it disappears after N turns, meaning at the end of N turns, so for turn 9, with life span 8, it will be present for turns 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, and disappear after turn 16.

Similarly for (2,1), too far. So I cannot eat the life span 1 foods this turn; they will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Therefore, the only food available for later is (4,1) with life span 8.\n> \n> But are there other foods?

Valid moves are:\n1. **D (Down)**: (4,3) \n   - Check: (4,3) is not a wall or occupied by the body. Safe.\n2. **L (Left)**: (3,4)\n   - Check: (3,4) is not a wall or occupied by the body. Safe.\n3. **R (Right)**: (5,4)\n   - Check: (5,4) is not a wall or occupied by the body. Safe.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- (2,1): Cannot be reached in one move (distance too far). Will disappear after this turn, so ignore.\n- (4,1) and (4,2): Both are positive and reachable in future turns. (4,1) has a shorter life span (must be eaten by Turn 16).\n\n### Immediate Goals:\n1. Avoid collisions and traps.\n2. Position the snake to eat (4,1) and (4,2) safely.\n\n### Move Analysis:\n1. **D to (4,3)**:\n   - Next turn, can move D to (4,2) to eat (4,2), then D to (4,1) to eat (4,1). However, this leads to a potential trap at (4,1) where the only escape is left to (3,1), limiting future movement.\n   - Risk: After eating both foods, the snake is long (length 6) and may get trapped in the bottom-left corner.\n\n2. **L to (3,4)**:\n   - Opens up space to maneuver around the left side of the grid.\n   - Next moves could be D to (3,3), then R to (4,3), etc., allowing more flexibility to approach food later.\n   - Safer for long-term survival but delays eating food.\n\n3. **R to (5,4)**:\n   - Moves toward the right side, avoiding immediate food but exploring more space.\n   - Less risky but may miss the opportunity to eat (4,1) before it disappears.\n\n### Optimal Move:\n- **D to (4,3)** is the most aggressive but allows eating both foods quickly. While it risks trapping the snake later, the AI's task is to maximize the immediate score, and this move sets up eating both (4,2) and (4,1) in the next two turns.\n- The alternative moves (L or R) are safer but do not maximize the score as effectively.\n\n### Final Decision:\nGiven the need to maximize score by eating food and the time constraints on (4,1), the best immediate action is to move down to (4,3), setting up to eat (4,2) and (4,1) in subsequent turns.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 10, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So, cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for any x or y are walls. Playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. These are also walls, so snake can't go there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6). So the snake is: head (4,4), body (4,5), (4,6), tail (5,6). Head direction is D, which is down, so moving downward. But since head is at (4,4) and direction is D, that means it was moving down to (4,4) from above? Let's see the positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]. If head is at (4,4) and direction is D, that suggests it just moved down to (4,4). But (4,5) is above (4,4), since y increases up or down? Typically in grids, y=0 is top or bottom?\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upward or downward? Let's see the definition.\n> \n> \"U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`, L`(x-1,y)`, R`(x+1,y)`\"\n> \n> It doesn't specify if y=0 is top or bottom, but since D is (x,y-1), that likely means y decreases downward, so y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom? But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is top wall, y=7 is bottom wall.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6). If y=0 is top, then (4,5) has higher y, so it's below (4,4)? Let's think:\n> \n> If U is (x,y+1), that means increasing y moves upward, so y=0 is bottom? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Standard in many games: U (up) decreases y, D (down) increases y, but here it's defined as U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1). That would mean y increases as you go up? But in coordinates, usually (0,0) is top-left, with x right, y down.\n> \n> But in this definition: U: (x,y+1) — if (0,0) is top-left, U would go to (0,1), which is down, but that should be D. I think there's inconsistency.\n> \n> Let me read carefully: \"U`(x,y+1)`\" — so for example, from (x,y), U to (x,y+1). If (0,0) is top-left, (x,y+1) is down, so U would be down, which is confusing.\n> \n> Perhaps the grid has y increasing downward? In that case, U (up) should be (x,y-1), but it's defined as U (x,y+1), which would be down.\n> \n> I think there might be a mistake in my assumption. Let me look at the movement constraints.\n> \n> \"In each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in following directions: U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`, L`(x-1,y)`, R`(x+1,y)`\"\n> \n> And walls: y=0 and y=7.\n> \n> Also, snake positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (4,6), tail (5,6).\n> \n> If head is at (4,4) and direction is D, which is down, meaning it moved to (4,4) from above. But above would be lower y if y increases down.\n> \n> Assume that (0,0) is top-left corner, so y increases downward, x increases right.\n> \n> Then U: (x,y+1) would be (x, y+1), which is down, but that should be D. But here U is defined as (x,y+1), which from (x,y) to (x,y+1) is down if y+1 > y.\n> \n> But U is labeled \"U\" for up, which is confusing.\n> \n> Perhaps the coordinate system has y=0 at bottom. But let's see the walls: y=0 is a wall, y=7 is a wall. And snake at y=4,5,6 which are between 0 and 7.\n> \n> In the food: (2,1), (4,1), (4,2), so y=1 and y=2.\n> \n> If y=0 is top, y=7 bottom, then y=1 is row 1, close to top.\n> \n> But direction: head at (4,4), direction D (down), which should be to (4,5) if down increases y.\n> \n> But in positions, after head (4,4), it's (4,5), which has higher y, so if y increases down, (4,5) is below (4,4), so if head is at (4,4) and moving D to (4,5), but the position list has head at (4,4), then (4,5), so (4,5) is the first body segment, meaning the head was at (4,5) previous turn? Let's think of the sequence.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] with head direction D.\n> \n> Direction D means the head is moving downward. Since it's at (4,4), and moving D, it would go to (4,3) if D is (x,y-1), but D is defined as (x,y-1), so from (4,4) D to (4,3).\n> \n> But the body segments: (4,5) is above (4,4) if y increases down, so previous position was head at (4,5), moved D to (4,4), so now head at (4,4), body at previous head position (4,5), then (4,6), which is above that, and tail at (5,6).\n> \n> (4,6) to (5,6) is right, so the snake was moving down from (4,6) to (4,5)? Let's trace:\n> \n> Previous turn: head at (4,5), direction D, moved to (4,4) (since D (x,y-1) from (4,5) to (4,4)? D is (x,y-1), so from (4,5) to (4,4) if y-1=4.\n> \n> But positions: current head (4,4), which was just moved to, so previous head was at (4,5), moved D to (4,4). Then the body segments: (4,5) is now the first body, which was previous head, then (4,6) is next, which was previous first body, and (5,6) was tail or previous position.\n> \n> (4,6) to (5,6): before moving, the snake was [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] with head at (4,5). Then it moved D to (4,4), so new positions: head (4,4), then the previous head becomes body (4,5), then previous body (4,6), then tail (5,6). But (5,6) was tail, and it was at (5,6) before, after move, the tail moves? No, in Snake, when the snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail end is removed if no food eaten, but if food eaten, tail not removed, length increases.\n> \n> But here, no food eaten in this move, I assume, since positions show four segments.\n> \n> Initial positions: before move, snake at [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] with head at (4,5), moving D to (4,4), so new head at (4,4), and tail at (5,6) is removed? But in the list, after move, positions are [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)], so (5,6) is still there, but it should be removed if no food.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> The position list is the current state after the move. So at turn 10, snake is at [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] with head at (4,4).\n> \n> The head direction is D, meaning it just moved downward to reach (4,4), so from (4,5) to (4,4) with D.\n> \n> Since D is (x,y-1), and from (4,5) to (4,4), y decreased from 5 to 4, so if y decreases downward, that means (4,4) is below (4,5), so y=4 is below y=5, so y increases upward? That can't be.\n> \n> Let's define the coordinate system.\n> \n> From movement: U: (x,y+1) — if this is up, then y+1 means higher y is up.\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) — y-1 means lower y is down.\n> \n> So, for example, from (x,y), U to (x,y+1) is up, so y increases as you go up.\n> \n> D to (x,y-1) is down, y decreases as you go down.\n> \n> Then walls at y=0 and y=7. If y increases up, y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Then border walls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> In snake positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (4,6), tail (5,6).\n> \n> If y increases up, (4,4) is at y=4, (4,5) is at y=5 which is above (4,4), (4,6) at y=6 above that, and (5,6) at x=5,y=6.\n> \n> Head direction D, down, so it was moving down from (4,5) to (4,4)? From (4,5) to (4,4) with D (x,y-1), y from 5 to 4, decrease, so moving down to lower y.\n> \n> But (4,5) to (4,4) is from higher y to lower y, so from up to down.\n> \n> In positions, head at (4,4), which is below (4,5), so the snake was previously at [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] with head (4,5), moved D to (4,4), so new head (4,4), and the body segments: (4,5) is now first body (previous head), (4,6) second body, (5,6) tail. But (5,6) was at (5,6) before and after, so when snake moves, the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment or something.\n> \n> Standard Snake movement: when snake moves forward, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail end is left, unless food eaten, tail stays.\n> \n> In this case, before move: positions [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] with head (4,5), tail (5,6).\n> \n> Move D to (4,4): new head (4,4), then body segments move to previous positions: first body to (4,5), second body to (4,6), and tail was (5,6), but since no food, the tail is removed, so new positions should be [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6)] with tail at (4,6).\n> \n> But in the state, it's [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)], so there are four segments, meaning that either food was eaten or the snake has length 4.\n> \n> Length is 4, so tail is (5,6), which was not removed because it moved to the position, but in the list, (5,6) is still there, but it should be the new position of the tail.\n> \n> After move to (4,4), the segments are: head (4,4), then the first body is now at the old head position (4,5), the second body at old first body position (4,6), and the tail at old second body position (5,6). So positions: new head (4,4), then body (4,5) which was old head, body (4,6) which was old first body, and tail (5,6) which was old tail, but old tail was at (5,6), and it moved to where? In Snake, the tail moves to the position of the segment that was before it.\n> \n> Let's index the segments.\n> \n> Before move: segment 0: head (4,5), segment 1: body (4,6), segment 2: tail (5,6)\n> \n> After move: head moves to new position (4,4), so segment 0 new: (4,4)\n> \n> Then segment 1 (first body) moves to where segment 0 was, (4,5)\n> \n> Segment 2 (tail) moves to where segment 1 was, (4,6)\n> \n> But in the state, it's [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)], but (5,6) is still there, which means there is a fourth segment, so the snake has 4 segments.\n> \n> Positions list has 4 elements: indices 0,1,2,3: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> So before move, it must have had 4 segments: say head at (4,5), body at (4,6), body at (5,6), tail at some (x,y), but it's not given, or the tail was at (5,6) and after move, it moved.\n> \n> Before move at turn 9, positions: head (4,5), then body segments, let's say body1 (4,6), body2 (5,6), and tail (5,5) or something. But not given.\n> \n> From the list, after move at turn 10, positions [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)], so the last segment is (5,6), which means before move, the tail was at (5,6) and after move, it is still at (5,6) only if it didn't move, but it should move to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> I think I have it: when the snake moves, the head goes to new cell, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list. So for a snake of length L, there are L segments.\n> \n> Before move: segments S0, S1, S2, S3 at positions P0, P1, P2, P3.\n> \n> After moving in direction D, new head position P0_new = adjacent in D.\n> \n> Then new position of S1 is old P0\n> \n> New position of S2 is old P1\n> \n> New position of S3 is old P2\n> \n> So the tail S3 moves to old position of S2.\n> \n> In this case, before move, let's say at turn 9: positions [ (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] or something, but we don't have turn 9 state.\n> \n> From turn 10 state: positions [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]\n> \n> This means that new head is (4,4)\n> \n> New first body is old head position, so old head was at (4,5)\n> \n> New second body is old first body position, so old first body was at (4,6)\n> \n> New tail is old second body position, so old second body was at (5,6)\n> \n> Then the old tail was at some position, say (x,y), but it's not in the new list, so it was left.\n> \n> For example, if before move, positions were [ (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) ] with head (4,5), tail (5,5)\n> \n> After move D to (4,4): new head (4,4), new body1 (4,5), new body2 (4,6), new tail (5,6)  // old body2 position\n> \n> And old tail (5,5) is removed.\n> \n> But in the state, the positions are given as (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), so (5,6) is the tail, which was the position of the old body2.\n> \n> Similarly, for the food, we can proceed.\n> \n> I think for the current state, we have:\n> \n> Head at (4,4), direction D (down, which is (x,y-1) since D: (x,y-1))\n> \n> Body at (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food have value 1, so positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,1) life span 1, so it disappears after this turn or next? \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span), Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> At turn 10, life span 1, so after turn 10, countdown to 0, so it disappears at the end of turn 10 or beginning of turn 11? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 10, life span 1, after turn 10, it becomes 0, and since it disappears after N turns, probably at the end of turn when countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So (2,1) will disappear after this turn, so if not eaten on turn 10, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) life span 7, so at turn 10, it has 7 turns left, including turn 10, so it will disappear after turn 16 or something.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn, starting from life_span at spawn.\n> \n> For (2,1), at turn 10, life span 1, so after turn 10, countdown 0, disappears.\n> \n> For (4,1), life span 7 at turn 10, so after 7 turns, on turn 17, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life span 10, disappears after turn 20.\n> \n> All value 1, positive.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,4), direction D, so possible moves: since just moved D, cannot instant reverse to U, so cannot move U (up).\n> \n> Possible moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) from (4,4) to (4,3)\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) to (3,4)\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) to (5,4)\n> \n> But need to check for walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7; y=0,7; internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Also, body collision, but since tail might move, only if head hits a body segment that won't move away.\n> \n> Current body positions: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> If head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies, except if it's the tail and the tail moves, but only if moving into the tail cell when the tail is about to move.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

Positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), so (5,4) is not occupied. Walls: border x=5 is not border since x=0 and x=7 are borders, x=5 is between 1 and 6, so ok.

It's turn 11. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with those obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). So it's a vertical snake going down, since head direction is D (down). The body segments are directly below: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). So the snake is 4 segments long.\n> \n> Food: two pieces. First, at (4,1) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive food). Second, at (4,2) with life span 9 and value 1 (also positive). Both are on the same column as the snake, x=4.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,3) and moving down. But y increases upwards? Let me confirm the movement directions. U is (x,y+1), which typically means y increases upwards, but in grids, sometimes y increases downwards. I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> From the movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that means y=0 is at the bottom, and y increases upwards. But in the snake positions, head at (4,3), body at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Since head is at y=3 and body at y=4,5,6, and head direction is D (down), which is (x,y-1), so moving to lower y. So y=3 is above y=4? That would imply y decreases upwards, which is inconsistent.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"U(x,y+1), D(x,y-1)\". And snake positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)] with head direction D.\n> \n> If head is at (4,3) and moving D to (x,y-1), that would be to (4,2), but the body is at (4,4), which has higher y, so if head is at y=3 and moving down to lower y, that means lower y is downwards. So y=3 is above y=4? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Perhaps the coordinate system has y=0 at the top. So U (x,y+1) would decrease y if y=0 is top, but the notation says U(x,y+1), which increases y.\n> \n> Standard grid: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The walls are given with x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, so it's a grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Movement: U (x,y+1) — so if y+1, that means y increases upwards, so (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right.\n> \n> But in snake positions: head at (4,3), body at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Since head direction is D (down, to y-1), so from (4,3) moving down to (4,2) would be decreasing y, so y=3 is above y=4? That can't be.\n> \n> If U is (x,y+1) and that's up, then y increases as you go up. So position (4,3) has y=3, (4,4) has y=4, which is above y=3? No: if y increases upwards, then (4,3) is below (4,4), because higher y is higher up.\n> \n> For example, (4,3) at height 3, (4,4) at height 4, so (4,4) is above (4,3). Head at (4,3), moving down to (x,y-1) = (4,2), which is below (4,3). But the body is at (4,4), which is above (4,3), so the snake is going downwards from (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2)? Positions are given head first: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)].\n> \n> Head is at (4,3), next segment at (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6). So if y increases upwards, (4,3) is below (4,4), so the head is at a lower y than the first body segment, meaning the snake is moving downwards. Yes: from (4,4) to (4,3) is down, so head at (4,3) moving D to (4,2) makes sense.\n> \n> Similarly, the food is at (4,1) and (4,2). (4,2) is below (4,3), and (4,1) below that.\n> \n> So grid: y=0 bottom, y=7 top. x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> Food: (4,1) value 1, life span 7; (4,2) value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> Current turn t=11. Food life span decreases each turn, including current, so after turn 11, life span of (4,1) becomes 6, (4,2) becomes 8, and so on.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is D (down), I can move L, R, or D, but not U (because no instant reverse). So directions: Left (x-1,y), Right (x+1,y), Down (x,y-1).\n> \n> Current head position: (4,3)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Down (D) to (4,2)\n> \n> - Left (L) to (3,3)\n> \n> - Right (R) to (5,3)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or safety.\n> \n> First, (4,2): is it a wall? Borders: x=0,7 y=0,7. (4,2) is within 0-7, not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,2) not in list, so safe? But is it occupied by snake body?\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,3) head, (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (4,2) is not in these, so it's empty. Also, food at (4,2), which is positive.\n> \n> If I move to (4,2), I eat the food, since head moves onto it. Value +1, length increases by 1.\n> \n> But I need to consider the future.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,3): not wall, not obstacle, not snake body? Snake: (4,3), (4,4), etc., all x=4 except head is at (4,3), but moving to (3,3), which is different. Snake body at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), so (3,3) is free. No food there.\n> \n> (5,3): similarly, free, no food.\n> \n> Food is only at (4,1) and (4,2).\n> \n> Now, life span: (4,2) has life span 9, (4,1) has 7. After turn 11, if I don't eat, (4,2) life 8, (4,1) life 6.\n> \n> But if I move down to (4,2), I eat it now.\n> \n> But there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Current tail is at (4,6). Head at (4,3), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing edge, so (4,3) and (4,6) are 3 cells apart, not adjacent. After moving to (4,2), head at (4,2), tail still at (4,6), not adjacent. When I eat, the tail grows, but since I eat at (4,2), the new tail will be added after moving, but the collision is checked after the move.\n> \n> Rule: after moving head to new cell, if it's food, eat it, then if positive, add new segment at tail, so snake grows.\n> \n> Then check for collisions: if head collides with body or wall.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (4,2): it has food, so eat, value +1, length becomes 5. New tail added, but since I move to (4,2), which was empty, and after eating, the new segment is added at the end, so positions: new head at (4,2), then (4,3) which was head, now body, then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), and new tail? When you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move, head moves to new cell, if food, it's eaten and tail doesn't move, so length increases. If no food, tail moves forward, length same.\n> \n> Here: when head moves to a cell with food, it is eaten, and if positive, length increases by one, meaning tail stays in place; if negative, length unchanged, tail moves.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: after move, head is at new position. If food eaten and positive, the tail remains, so the new segment is where the tail was? No.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Move head to new cell.\n> \n> - If new cell has food, remove food, and if positive, do not remove the tail segment (so tail stays, length increases). If negative, remove the tail segment (tail moves, length same).\n> \n> - Then check for collisions with body or wall.\n> \n> Body includes all segments except the head, I think.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,2): move head to (4,2), which has food (positive), so eat it, value +1, and since positive, tail does not move, so new positions: head (4,2), then previous head (4,3) now body, (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) tail. So snake now: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)] length 5.\n> \n> Now, check collisions: head at (4,2), body segments at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Head at (4,2), not touching any body, since (4,3) is adjacent but not colliding? Collision is if head is on the same cell as body. Head at (4,2), body at (4,3), different cells, so no collision. Walls fine.\n> \n> Similarly, for other moves.\n> \n> But Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,6), head at (4,2) after move, not adjacent. Tail cell: the cell where tail is, (4,6), has no food, so no issue.\n> \n> The food is at (4,1) and (4,2), not at tail.\n> \n> So moving to (4,2) seems safe and gets +1.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.

It's turn 12, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. x and y from 1 to 6 inclusive? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So the grid has x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, but walls are at the borders, meaning cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. So playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). Yes.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)] – these are walls too, I assume, since they're listed under obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). So the snake is vertical, head at (4,2), which is near the bottom, and tail at (4,6). Since head direction is D (down), and positions are (4,2), (4,3), etc., moving down would be increasing y? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So if U increases y, that might imply y=0 is bottom, y increasing upwards. But in the snake positions: head at (4,2), and if moving down, D, to (x,y-1), so from (4,2) to (4,1) would be down.\n> \n> But let's list the positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Head at (4,2), next is (4,3), which is higher y, so if y increases upwards, (4,2) to (4,3) is up, but head direction is D, down? Contradiction.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, meaning the last move was down. But positions: from head to tail: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). If (4,2) is head, and (4,3) is the next segment, that means the head is at (4,2) and the body is at (4,3), which has higher y. So if y increases upwards, moving from (4,3) to (4,2) would be down? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> The snake moves, and the head moves first. Head direction D means it moved down to the current position. So before moving, head was at some position, and it moved down to (4,2).\n> \n> Since positions are listed head first, (4,2) is current head, (4,3) is the segment that was head before, and so on. So before the move, head was at (4,1) or something? Let's infer.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 11, head was at some position, say P, and it moved down to (4,2). Then the new head is (4,2), and the old head becomes body, so (4,3) was the head at turn 11? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail leaves its cell, unless it eats food.\n> \n> Positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)] with head direction D.\n> \n> Since head direction is D, that means the head moved down to reach (4,2). So before moving to (4,2), the head was at (4,3) at turn 11? Let's see the y-coordinates.\n> \n> If moving down decreases y, then from (x,y) to (x,y-1) is down.\n> \n> At turn 11, head was at (4,3), and it moved down to (4,2), so new head is (4,2), and the segment at (4,3) is now the first body part. Then (4,4) was previous body, etc., up to tail at (4,6).\n> \n> But in the list, positions are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), so (4,2) head, (4,3) body, (4,4) body, etc. So from (4,3) to (4,2) is decreasing y, so down direction. Yes, that makes sense if down is decreasing y.\n> \n> So coordinate system: y decreases as we go down, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), which is near the bottom since y=2, and y=1 is above the bottom wall? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the first row, y=6 is top row? y=7 is top wall, so y=6 is highest playable, y=1 lowest playable? Let's clarify.\n> \n> y=0 is wall (bottom), y=7 wall (top). So y-coordinates: y=0 bottom wall, y=1,2,3,4,5,6 playable, y=7 top wall. Similarly x=0 left wall, x=1 to 6 playable, x=7 right wall.\n> \n> In positions, head at (4,2), which is x=4, y=2. Since y=1 is above y=0, so y=1 is the bottom row, y=6 is the top row. So (4,2) is second row from bottom.\n> \n> Food: only one food given: (4,1,6,1) – this is (x,y, life_span, value) I think. Format: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) so here (4,1), value 1, life_span 6.\n> \n> Value 1 means positive food, since +1.\n> \n> Life span 6, so it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn t1=12, so at turn 12, life_span=6, so it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning on turn 18 it might be gone? Let's see: life_span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 12, life_span=6, after turn 12, it becomes 5, then 4, etc., so when life_span reaches 0, it disappears. So after 6 turns, at turn 18, life_span=0, so it disappears before turn 18? Turn numbering.\n> \n> Turn t: at the start of turn t, we have state, then we move, then after move, if head eats food, etc.\n> \n> Life_span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at the beginning of turn when food is present, life_span is the number of turns it will remain, including this turn. After this turn, it decreases.\n> \n> For example, at turn 12, food at (4,1) has life_span 6, meaning after turn 12 is processed, life_span becomes 5; after turn 13, 4; ... after turn 17, it becomes 0, and disappears before turn 18. So it can be eaten from turn 12 to 17 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), direction D (down). Moving down would be to (4,1), which is exactly where the food is.\n> \n> (4,1) is a cell, and food is there.\n> \n> But is (4,1) a valid cell? y=1 is playable, since walls are y=0 and y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)] – these are walls, so cannot move there.\n> \n> (5,1) and (6,1) are obstacles, but (4,1) is not listed, so it should be free, except for the food.\n> \n> (4,1) has food, so it's occupied by food, but snake can move there to eat it.\n> \n> Now, if I move down to (4,1), I eat the food.\n> \n> But there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, what is the tail? Snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)] so tail is at (4,6).\n> \n> Head at (4,2), tail at (4,6). Are they adjacent? Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (4,2) and (4,6) are not adjacent; they are 4 cells apart vertically. So not adjacent.\n> \n> Therefore, no immediate danger from that rule.\n> \n> But when I eat the food, the snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so new segments are added.\n> \n> If I move to (4,1), I eat the food, since it's positive, value +1, length increases by 1.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows: new head at (4,1), and the tail stays, so positions become: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) — so length 6 now.\n> \n> But the tail is still at (4,6).\n> \n> Now, are there any other foods?

It's turn 13. The grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2). Snake positions are from head to tail: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). So the snake is vertical, head at (4,1) going down. Head direction is D, which is down.\n> \n> Food: only one food mentioned at (3,5) with value 1 and life span 10. Life span 10 means it will disappear after 10 turns, including this one, so it has 10 turns left starting from turn 13.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards. Since there's only one food right now, I should think about how to get to it safely, but also avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) – so it's occupying y from 1 to 6 at x=4.\n> \n> Head at (4,1), direction down, so moving down.\n> \n> Food at (3,5), value +1.\n> \n> Since the snake is going down, from (4,1), possible moves: up, down, left, right. But head direction is down, so I can't instantly reverse to up. Reverse would be up, since down is current direction.\n> \n> Rule: no instant reverse. So cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is down, so opposite is up. Therefore, I cannot move up on this turn (turn 13).\n> \n> Possible actions: down, left, right. Not up.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move does.\n> \n> If I move down: from (4,1) to (4,0). But y=0 is a border wall, so (4,0) is a wall cell. Moving to (4,0) would cause a wall collision and death. So moving down is not possible; it's deadly.\n> \n> Confirm: walls include y=0, so (4,0) is out of bounds or wall, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, down is invalid.\n> \n> Now, left: from (4,1) to (3,1). Is (3,1) safe? Need to check if it's a wall or body.\n> \n> Walls: internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (5,1) is a wall, (6,1) is a wall, but (3,1) is not listed, so no internal obstacle there. Borders: x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7. (3,1) has x=3, y=1, both within bounds, not on border walls, and not an internal obstacle. Now, body: snake is at (4,1), (4,2), etc. (3,1) is not part of snake body currently. Head is at (4,1), so (3,1) is empty.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). So (3,1) is free.\n> \n> But when I move, the head moves to (3,1), and the body follows, so the tail moves from (4,6) to where? After moving, the new positions would be head at (3,1), then body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). The segment that was at (4,1) becomes the first body part, and tail is (4,5), since (4,6) is left.\n> \n> General snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> In this case, no food eaten yet, so length remains the same.\n> \n> So after move left to (3,1), new positions: head (3,1), then body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Now, (3,1) is safe to move to.\n> \n> Similarly, right: from (4,1) to (5,1). Now (5,1) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,1) is listed, yes, (5,1) is a wall. So moving to (5,1) would cause collision with wall. Invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: left to (3,1) or... up is not possible because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> Down to (4,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Right to (5,1) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Left to (3,1) seems possible.\n> \n> But is there another option?

Moving left changes direction to left.\n> \n> Moving down: invalid, wall.\n> \n> Moving right: invalid, wall.\n> \n> Moving up: invalid, reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So only left is possible? But that seems too constrained.\n> \n> Perhaps I can move in other directions, but up is the only reverse, so down, left, right should be possible except for collisions.\n> \n> Down and right have collisions, so only left is safe.\n> \n> But let's list all adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (4,2) but moving up would be to (4,2), which is currently occupied by the body? (4,2) is the second segment of the snake.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0: head (4,1), index 1: (4,2), index 2: (4,3), etc.\n> \n> So (4,2) is a body segment. If I move up to (4,2), that's a body collision, which is deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (4,0) is wall, deadly.\n> \n> Moving left to (3,1): not wall, not body, should be ok.\n> \n> Moving right to (5,1): (5,1) is an internal obstacle wall, deadly.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is left to (3,1).\n> \n> But is (3,1) free? Let's see: walls, no. Snake body, no. So yes.\n> \n> Also, food is at (3,5), not here, so no food eaten.\n> \n> So on turn 13, I must move left.\n> \n> Then head direction becomes left.\n> \n> Now, for future turns, I need to plan sequence for at least 5 turns: turn 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.\n> \n> Turn 13: action, which must be L.\n> \n> Then turn 14: from (3,1), head now at (3,1), direction left.\n> \n> Possible moves: left, right, up, down. But no instant reverse, so since direction is left, cannot move right (opposite).\n> \n> So possible: left to (2,1), up to (3,2), down to (3,0).\n> \n> Down to (3,0): y=0 is wall, deadly, invalid.\n> \n> Up to (3,2): what is (3,2)? Walls: internal obstacles, (1,2) is wall, but (3,2) not listed, so should be free. Snake: after turn 13, snake positions: head (3,1), body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Tail was (4,6), which moved off, so positions: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (3,2) is not occupied, so should be safe.\n> \n> Left to (2,1): (2,1) not wall, not body, should be safe.\n> \n> Right to (4,1): but (4,1) is now a body segment, since after move, (4,1) is the first body part. Moving right to (4,1) would be body collision, deadly. Also, since direction left, moving right is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So on turn 14, from (3,1), direction left, can move left to (2,1) or up to (3,2).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting to the food at (3,5).\n> \n> Food at (3,5), which is on the same x=3, but y=5.\n> \n> Currently head at (3,1) after turn 13 move.\n> \n> y=1 to y=5, so need to go up.\n> \n> But I need to avoid obstacles and plan.\n> \n> Also, the snake body is at (4,1) to (4,5), so x=4, y=1 to 5.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Food at (3,5), life span 10, so from turn 13, it will disappear after 10 turns, meaning on turn 23 it might be gone, but since it decreases each turn including current, at turn 13, life span 10, so after turn 13, it has 9 turns left, and so on, until turn 22 it has 1 turn left, and after turn 22 it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 22.\n> \n> But we're planning only 5 turns for now, to turn 17 or 18.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> For the sequence, I need actions for turn 13 to at least turn 17.\n> \n> Turn 13: must be L to (3,1)\n> \n> Then turn 14: from (3,1), I can go left to (2,1) or up to (3,2)\n> \n> If I go up to (3,2), then head to (3,2), direction up.\n> \n> Then from there, I can continue up or left/right, but need to get to (3,5).\n> \n> (3,2) to (3,5) is three steps up, but there might be obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (2,4) is a wall, but (3,4) should be free?

Direction was L, moving U, not reverse, so ok.\n> \n> Turn 15: from (3,2) move U to (3,3). Direction now U, moving U, same direction, ok.\n> \n> Turn 16: from (3,3) move U to (3,4). Still U, ok.\n> \n> Turn 17: from (3,4) move U to (3,5). Eat food, ok.\n> \n> Now, is there any risk on the way? For example, when moving to (3,4) on turn 16, is there a body part? At that time, body is (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), so (3,4) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) is food.\n> \n> But what about the tail?

So it's a bit clustered, but head at (3,5), I need to move away, probably not down or right immediately, but that's beyond the sequence.\n> \n> For now, this seems the best to eat the food quickly.\n> \n> But is there a negative food? No, only one food, positive at (3,5).\n> \n> In the state, only one food listed.\n> \n> So I think this is fine.\n> \n> But let's think about long-term survival. After eating, the snake is longer, and I need to navigate without hitting walls or body.\n> \n> For example, from (3,5), possible moves: up to (3,6), but y=7 is border, (3,6) is within, y=7 is wall, so (3,6) is ok? Grid y from 0 to 7, so y=7 is wall, cells y=0 and y=7 are walls, so (3,6) is y=6, which is not wall, should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, left to (2,5), right to (4,5), down to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, cannot.\n> \n> After eating at (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), etc.\n> \n> So moving down to (3,4) would be body collision, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, left to (2,5), if free, or right to (4,5), or up to (3,6).\n> \n> (2,5) not wall, should be free.\n> \n> (4,5): but internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> But (4,5) was part of the body earlier, but now it's free.\n> \n> After turn 17, the body is from (3,4) to (4,2), so (4,5) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) should be free.\n> \n> But (3,6) is close to top, y=6, and y=7 is wall.\n> \n> Now, to avoid getting trapped, but since we're only planning 5 turns, and this sequence gets the food, it should be ok.\n> \n> Perhaps I should consider not eating the food if it's risky, but in this case, it seems safe.\n> \n> Another thing: the food is under the snake? No, food at (3,5), which is not under snake; snake is at x=4, y=1-6 initially, so (3,5) is adjacent but not under.\n> \n> The rule about food under body: but in this case, it's not under, so can be eaten directly.\n> \n> In my plan, I eat it when head moves to it.\n> \n> So I think it's fine.\n> \n> Therefore, action sequence:\n> \n> Turn 13: L\n> \n> Turn 14: U\n> \n> Turn 15: U\n> \n> Turn 16: U\n> \n> Turn 17: U\n> \n> Now, for the thinking conclusion: I prioritized reaching the positive food quickly and safely by moving left to avoid the wall and then moving up directly towards the food, ensuring no collisions and considering the life span.\n> \n> But let's write the sequence properly.\n> \n> Also, for the answer format, it should be boxed.\n> \n> And thinking conclusion one or two sentences.\n> \n> Perhaps I should include a bit more.\n> \n> Since the food is at (3,5), and I start at (4,1), moving left first is necessary to avoid walls, then up is direct.\n> \n> Another path: could I go down or something, but down is invalid, only left possible.\n> \n> So no choice on turn 13.\n> \n> On turn 14, I could go left, but that would delay eating, so not better.\n> \n> So this seems optimal for short term.\n> \n> Long term, after eating, I might need to go right or up to explore, but for now, sequence is fine.\n> \n> So I think that's it.\n> </think>\n> ### Action Sequence\n> \\boxed{\n> Turn 13: L\n> Turn 14: U\n> Turn 15: U\n> Turn 16: U\n> Turn 17: U\n> }\n> \n> ### Main Thinking Conclusion\n> I prioritized immediate survival on turn 13 by moving left (L) to avoid wall collisions, then directly navigated upward (U) for turns 14-17 to reach the positive food at (3,5) efficiently while ensuring no body or wall collisions, maximizing score with minimal risk over the 5-turn horizon.\n",

It's turn 14, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid seems to be from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid.\n> \n> Walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Additionally, there are internal obstacles at: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked and I can't move into them.\n> \n> Snake positions: the head is at (3,1), then body segments at (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So the snake is 6 segments long. Head direction is Left, since it's moving left to (3,1) from (4,1)? Let's see the positions: head at (3,1), previous was (4,1), so yes, it was moving left to (3,1).\n> \n> Food: there's only one food listed: (3,5) with value 1 and life span 9. But it says (3,5,9,1), which I think means position (3,5), life span 9, value 1. So positive food.\n> \n> Life span 9 means it disappears after 9 turns, including the current turn. Since current turn is 14, it will disappear after turn 14 + 8 = turn 22? Let's calculate: life span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 14, life span is 9; after turn 14, it becomes 8; after turn 15, it becomes 7, and so on, until turn 22, when it would be 1 before disappearing, or after turn 22 it's gone? Better to think: if life span is N at turn t, it exists until turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N. Since it decreases each turn, starting from N at turn t, at turn t it has N, turn t+1 has N-1, ..., turn t + N - 1 has 1, and then at turn t + N it disappears. So for food at turn 14 with life span 9, it will disappear after turn 22 (since 14 + 8 = 22 has life span 1, then gone on turn 23).\n> \n> But since we're at turn 14, and we need to plan actions, we have time.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,1), direction Left. Possible moves: since head direction is Left, I cannot move Right instantly, because no instant reverse. So I can move Up, Down, or Left? Directions are U, D, L, R.\n> \n> Current head direction L, so I can move U, D, or L, but not R. Because moving right would be opposite to left.\n> \n> The rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So from L, I can go U, D, or continue L, but not R.\n> \n> Now, the grid: let me sketch this mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

Snake has a segment at (4,5), which is right next to (3,5)? (4,5) and (3,5) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> (3,5) is food, but snake body is at (4,5), which is adjacent to (3,5). But (3,5) is not occupied by snake; it's food. Snake positions are only the body parts.\n> \n> Now, food can spawn under snake body, but in this case, (3,5) is not under snake; it's empty, I think. Let's see: snake is at (4,5), which is different from (3,5). So (3,5) is free, with food.\n> \n> But there's a special rule: if the head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, where is the tail? Snake positions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Food is at (3,5). (3,5) is adjacent to tail (4,5)? Yes, horizontally adjacent.\n> \n> But the food is at (3,5), not on the tail cell. The tail is at (4,5), food at (3,5), so it's not on the tail cell.\n> \n> The special case is when food is on the tail cell, but here it's not. So that might not apply directly.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake...\"\n> \n> But here, the tail cell is (4,5), and there is no food on it; food is at (3,5). So this doesn't apply.\n> \n> Moreover, to eat the food at (3,5), I need to move head to (3,5).\n> \n> Currently, head at (3,1). I need to get to (3,5).\n> \n> But there might be obstacles or body in the way.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (3,1), direction L (left).\n> \n> Possible moves: Up (U) to (3,2), Down (D) to (3,0), Left (L) to (2,1), Right (R) but cannot because reverse, so not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - Up to (3,2): is (3,2) occupied? Snake positions: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), etc. (3,2) not listed, so not occupied by body. Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, but (3,2) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) is not listed, so should be free. Obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). None at (3,2). So (3,2) should be free.\n> \n> - Down to (3,0): y=0 is wall border, so cannot move there; it's a wall cell.\n> \n> - Left to (2,1): (2,1) – walls: x=0 and x=7 borders, but (2,1) x=2 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (2,1) is different. Also, snake: head at (3,1), body at (4,1), (4,2), etc., (2,1) not occupied. So should be free.\n> \n> - Right to (4,1): but (4,1) is the second segment of the snake, body part, so moving there would cause collision with body. Also, cannot move right because reverse direction not allowed.\n> \n> So from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), L to (2,1), or D but D to (3,0) is wall, so invalid. So only U or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about eating the food at (3,5). Value +1, so it's good to eat, but I need to get there safely.\n> \n> Also, since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a path.\n> \n> First, let's find a path to (3,5) from (3,1).\n> \n> Current head (3,1). (3,5) is at same x, different y.\n> \n> But between them, what cells are occupied?\n> \n> Snake body: from (3,1) to (4,1) to (4,2) to (4,3) to (4,4) to (4,5). So the cells from x=4, y=1 to y=5 are occupied.\n> \n> But (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) might be free? Let's see.\n> \n> (3,2): not occupied by snake or obstacles.\n> \n> (3,3): similarly, not listed as occupied or obstacle.\n> \n> (3,4): same.\n> \n> (3,5) is food.\n> \n> But (3,5) is adjacent to snake body at (4,5).\n> \n> Now, to go to (3,5), I could move up multiple times: from (3,1) to (3,2), then (3,3), then (3,4), then (3,5).\n> \n> But I need to consider if moving to (3,2) is safe now, and then proceed.\n> \n> After moving, the snake body moves, so the tail will move away.\n> \n> Currently, snake is: positions [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n> \n> If I move up to (3,2), new head is (3,2), then the body follows: the segment that was at (3,1) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So after moving head to (3,2), the new positions become: head (3,2), then the first body segment is now at (3,1) (which was head position), then (4,1) moves to where? Let's list:\n> \n> Original: index 0: head (3,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4), 5: tail (4,5)\n> \n> After move U to (3,2): new head is (3,2). Then segment 1 (which was at (4,1)) moves to the old head position (3,1). Segment 2 (was (4,2)) moves to (4,1)? No.\n> \n> The body segments shift: the segment that was behind the head moves to the head's previous position.\n> \n> So after head moves to (3,2), the new body starts from the old head position (3,1), then the next segment moves to where the first body was? Let's think of the positions.\n> \n> The new snake will be: head at new position (3,2), then the first body segment at previous head position (3,1), then the second body segment at previous first body position (4,1), and so on, up to the tail.\n> \n> Previous positions: [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ]\n> \n> After moving head to (3,2): the new positions are: head (3,2), then body segments: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). The tail (4,5) is no longer part of the snake because it moved forward; the segment that was at (4,4) is now at (4,4)? Let's index.\n> \n> Better: the new position list is: [ new head, old head, old body1, old body2, old body3, old body4 ]\n> \n> Old body1 is (4,1), old body2 is (4,2), etc.\n> \n> So: new head: (3,2)\n> \n> Then: old head becomes body: (3,1)\n> \n> Then old body1: (4,1)\n> \n> Then old body2: (4,2)\n> \n> Then old body3: (4,3)\n> \n> Then old body4: (4,4)  // this was the second last, now last body segment\n> \n> The tail (4,5) is gone because the snake didn't eat, so length same, tail moves away.\n> \n> So new positions: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]\n> \n> Length still 6.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move left to (2,1), new head (2,1), then body: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), and tail (4,5) gone.\n> \n> Now, back to getting to (3,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is food.

Current turn 14, so I have 8 more turns to eat it, including turn 14? Life span decreases each turn, so at turn 14, it has 9 turns left? Life span is given as 9 at turn 14, meaning it will last 9 turns from now, so I have until turn 22 to eat it.\n> \n> Turn 14 to turn 22 is 9 turns: turn 14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22.

It's turn 15, and I have to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> **Grid Setup:**\n> - Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and borders are deadly.\n> - Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). These are also deadly to touch.\n> \n> **Snake:**\n> - Positions: Head at (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So the snake has 6 segments.\n> - Head direction: Currently moving Up (U), since from (3,1) to (3,2) is up, but let's confirm the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]. Head is at (3,2), and it came from (3,1), which is below, so moving Up to (3,2). Yes, direction U.\n> \n> **Food:**\n> - Only one food item: (3,5) with value 1 and life span 8. Since it's turn 15, and life span decreases each turn, including current, so after turn 15, it will have 7 turns left? Life span starts at 8 on turn 15.\n> \n> Food info: (3,5,8,1) – I think this means (x,y, life_span, value). So position (3,5), life span 8, value +1 (positive food).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turns 15, 16, 17, etc., at least 5 turns ahead, but probably more since the food is at (3,5) which is above the head.\n> \n> Current head at (3,2), food at (3,5). So directly above, 3 cells up: (3,2) to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). But there might be obstacles or body in the way.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to see free cells.\n> \n> **Grid Visualization (8x8):**\n> \n> - Rows y=0 to y=7, columns x=0 to x=7.\n> - Walls: Borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n> - Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> - (3,2) - head\n> - (3,1) - body\n> - (4,1) - body\n> - (4,2) - body\n> - (4,3) - body\n> - (4,4) - body? (4,4) is listed, but y=4, x=4.\n> \n> Let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - Snake: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n> - Walls: borders and (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Food at (3,5), which is not occupied yet.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,2), moving Up. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since current direction is U, reverse is D, so cannot go D immediately. So possible: U, L, R.\n> \n> Current direction U, so cannot go D (down) next turn.\n> \n> Options for turn 15:\n> - U: to (3,3)\n> - L: to (2,2)\n> - R: to (4,2)\n> \n> But (4,2) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (4,2) is a body segment. Is it safe to move there?\n> \n> Collision rules: Moving into a body segment is deadly, except for the tail. The tail is at (4,4), since positions are head first, so tail is last element, (4,4).\n> \n> When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the tail moves away, so the cell that was tail becomes free.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: When head moves to a new cell, if it's food, tail stays, snake grows; if not, tail moves, so the cell is freed.\n> \n> In terms of collision: Head cannot move to any body segment except that it can move to the current tail cell because the tail will move away.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But only if that tail cell is not occupied after the move.\n> \n> Specifically: When moving, if head moves to a cell that is not food, then the tail moves off its cell, so that cell becomes empty. So head can move to the current tail position safely, because after move, tail is gone from there.\n> \n> If head moves to a food, tail doesn't move, so head cannot move to tail if food is there, but food on tail is a special case.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 15, possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,3): what is (3,3)? Not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. Free?\n> - L to (2,2): (2,2) is not in snake, not wall? Walls: internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,2) is not listed, so should be free.\n> - R to (4,2): (4,2) is in snake positions; it's the fourth segment? Positions: index 0: head (3,2), index 1: (3,1), index 2: (4,1), index 3: (4,2), index 4: (4,3), index 5: tail (4,4).\n> \n> So (4,2) is a body segment, not tail. Tail is (4,4). Therefore, moving to (4,2) would be a body collision, deadly. Cannot go R.\n> \n> Similarly, D is not possible because reverse is disallowed.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U or L.\n> \n> Now, U to (3,3): is (3,3) free? Let's list all blocked cells.\n> \n> Blocked cells:\n> - Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; plus internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> - Snake: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n> \n> (3,3) is not in any of these, so free.\n> \n> (2,2) is not in walls or obstacles, not in snake, so free.\n> \n> (3,1) is snake body, but we're not moving there.\n> \n> So for turn 15, can go U or L.\n> \n> Now, food is at (3,5), which is above. If I go U, I get closer to food.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, life span of food is 8, starting turn 15, so it will disappear after 8 turns, meaning on turn 23 it will be gone? Life span decreases each turn, including current, so on turn 15, life_span=8, after turn 15 it becomes 7, then 6, ..., down to 0 on turn 22? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn 15: food present with life_span 8.\n> \n> After turn 15, life_span decreases by 1, so on turn 16, life_span=7.\n> \n> Similarly, after each turn, decreases.\n> \n> It disappears when life_span reaches 0? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> After turn t, when life_span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> At turn 15, life_span=8, so:\n> \n> - After turn 15: life_span=7\n> \n> - After turn 16: life_span=6\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 22: life_span=0, disappears.\n> \n> So food is available from turn 15 to 22 inclusive? Turn 15 to turn 22 it exists, and on turn 23 it's gone.\n> \n> Since countdown decreases after each turn, including current, so at the start of turn 15, life_span=8, and it decreases to 7 after the turn, meaning during the turn it's still there.\n> \n> The food can be eaten on any turn when it's present, before life_span reaches 0.\n> \n> On turn t, if head moves to food cell, it is eaten, and life_span is for that turn.\n> \n> After eating, food is removed.\n> \n> In this case, food at (3,5) can be eaten from turn 15 to 22.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,2), food at (3,5), so vertical distance 3 in y-direction.\n> \n> If I go directly up, I can reach it in 3 moves: turn 15 U to (3,3), turn 16 U to (3,4), turn 17 U to (3,5) and eat.\n> \n> But I need to check if the path is clear.\n> \n> (3,3): free, as we saw.\n> \n> (3,4): what is (3,4)? Not in snake positions, not in walls or obstacles. Walls: internal (2,4) is at x=2,y=4, so (3,4) is different. Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,4) should be free.\n> \n> Then (3,5): food, also not occupied otherwise.\n> \n> But after eating, snake grows, so length becomes 7.\n> \n> But there might be risks.\n> \n> First, if I go U now, to (3,3), then next turn, from there.\n> \n> But I need to think about the tail and possible dangers.\n> \n> Another option is to go L to (2,2), which might be safer or allow other paths.\n> \n> But food is at (3,5), so going left might take me away.\n> \n> Prioritize long-term survival, but eating positive food is good.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the area around.\n> \n> After moving U to (3,3), on turn 15.\n> \n> Then snake positions: head to (3,3), then body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and tail (4,4) moves? When head moves to new cell, if not food, tail moves off.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is not eaten yet, so if head moves to (3,3) which is not food, then snake moves: head to (3,3), then body segments follow: the segment that was at (3,2) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So positions update: new head position, then the old head becomes new second segment, and so on, and the tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - Start: positions [H, B1, B2, B3, B4, T] = [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]\n> \n> If move U to (3,3), not food, so:\n> \n> - New head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Then new body: H becomes B1: (3,2) -> becomes second segment\n> \n> - B1: (3,1) -> becomes third segment\n> \n> - B2: (4,1) -> becomes fourth segment\n> \n> - B3: (4,2) -> becomes fifth segment\n> \n> - B4: (4,3) -> becomes tail?

No, in general, moving to tail cell is safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> But if I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so I grow.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,3), which is the tail, but there's no food there, so if I move to (4,3), since it's the tail, and I don't eat food, the tail moves away, so head goes to (4,3), tail leaves, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to a cell with food, I eat it and grow, so tail stays.\n> \n> Here, (4,3) is tail, and no food mentioned there, so moving to (4,3) should be safe.\n> \n> But let's confirm the food positions: food at (3,5) and (5,6), not at (4,3).\n> \n> So from (3,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,4): what's there? Is it wall or body? (3,4) is within grid, not border wall. y=4, x=3, borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (3,4) is free? But need to check obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (3,4) not among them, so should be free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). So (3,4) not occupied, so empty.\n> \n> - L to (2,3): x=2,y=3. Not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,3) not there, so free. Snake? Not occupied, so empty.\n> \n> - R to (4,3): which is occupied by tail, but since it's tail, moving there is safe as tail moves away.\n> \n> Cannot move D to (3,2) because it's body and reverse direction.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) with life span 7. Current turn 16, so it will disappear after 7 turns, meaning it lasts until turn 16 + 7 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Life span 7 at turn 16, so after turn 16, life span becomes 6 on turn 17, and so on, until life span 0, which might be after turn 16+7=23? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, meaning it exists for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Or turn t + L?\n> \n> Example: suppose turn t, life span L. After turn t, L decreases to L-1. After turn t+1, L-2, ..., after turn t+L-1, L=1, then after that turn, it disappears? I think it's better to think when it disappears.\n> \n> Rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, countdown is N. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1. After turn t+1, N-2, ..., when countdown reaches 0, after that turn, it disappears? But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it is present for N full turns.\n> \n> Perhaps: at the start of turn t, food is present with life span N. After the turn, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, after the decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (3,5), life span 7 at turn 16. So:\n> \n> - Turn 16: life span 7, present\n> \n> - Turn 17: life span 6, present\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 22: life span 1, present\n> \n> - Turn 23: life span 0, disappears before turn 23? After turn 22, when life span decreases to 0, it disappears, so not present on turn 23.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,6) life span 10, from turn 16 to turn 25? Turn 16:10, 17:9, ..., 25:1, 26:0 disappear, so present until turn 25.\n> \n> Turn 16: L=10\n> \n> After turn 16, L=9 for turn 17? Let's clarify.\n> \n> I think \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" means at the end of the turn, it decreases, or during?\n> \n> But for planning, we need to know when it can be eaten.\n> \n> Typically in such games, at the beginning of turn, food is present with life span, and after the snake moves and possibly eats, the life span decreases, and if it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> Perhaps at turn t, with life span L, it can be eaten during turn t, and after turn t, L decreases to L-1, and if L-1=0, it disappears before next turn.\n> \n> So for (3,5) at turn 16, L=7, can be eaten on turn 16,17,18,19,20,21,22. On turn 23, it would have L=0, but since it decreases after turn 22 to 0, it disappears, so not present on turn 23.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,6), L=10, can be eaten turn 16 to 25.\n> \n> Now back to current position.\n> \n> Head at (3,3), direction U.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 16.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R.\n> \n> - U: to (3,4)\n> \n> - L: to (2,3)\n> \n> - R: to (4,3)\n> \n> Now, from there, I need to consider paths to food or safe areas.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is directly above at (3,5), which is 2 steps up from (3,3): (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5).\n> \n> But (3,4) might be safe?

(2,4) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4)? Let's check: internal obstacles are [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)] – yes, (2,4) is an obstacle! So (2,4) is a wall, I cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are cells occupied by walls, so (2,4) is a wall, so moving Left to (2,4) is impossible, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, Right: to (4,4) – is (4,4) free? Snake positions: (3,4) head, (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). None at (4,4), and no obstacles listed at (4,4), so (4,4) should be free.\n> \n> Down: not possible, opposite direction.\n> \n> So only possible moves: Up to (3,5) or Right to (4,4).\n> \n> Now, (3,5) has food. If I move Up, I go to (3,5), which has food, so I eat it, length increases by 1, and I get +1 score.\n> \n> But I need to check for tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,2). Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (3,4), tail at (4,2). Distance: |3-4| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so neighbors: up, down, left, right.\n> \n> From (3,4), adjacent cells: (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4). Tail is at (4,2), which is not adjacent; it's two steps away vertically and one horizontally, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Therefore, no tail reward danger here. Eating the food at (3,5) should be safe.\n> \n> Life span: food at (3,5) has life span 6. Current turn 17, so it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning it will be gone on turn 17 + 6 = 23? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,5), life span 6 on turn 17. After this turn (turn 17), if not eaten, life span becomes 5 on turn 18, and so on, until turn 22 it has life span 1, and on turn 23 it disappears? But \"disappears after N turns\" – I think after N turns from when it was spawned, but here it's given with current life span.\n> \n> It says \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on the turn it is present, life span decreases that turn.\n> \n> Assume that on turn t when food is present, life_span is given, and at the end of turn t, if not eaten, life_span decreases by 1, and so on, until life_span reaches 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> For (3,5), life_span=6 at turn 17. So after turn 17, if not eaten, life_span=5 on turn 18, ..., after turn 22, life_span=0, so it disappears before turn 23? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means that on the turn when it has life_span k, it will disappear after k more turns.\n> \n> For example, on turn 17, life_span=6, so it will be available for 6 more turns, including turn 17. So it can be eaten on turns 17,18,19,20,21,22, and disappears on turn 23.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,6), life_span=9, available until turn 17+9-1? Let's not overcomplicate; since we're at turn 17, and life_span decreases each turn, it will be gone after 6 turns from now, meaning last chance to eat is on turn 22 if not eaten earlier.\n> \n> But for now, since I'm at turn 17, I can eat it.\n> \n> Back to actions: from (3,4), I can move U to (3,5) or R to (4,4).\n> \n> If I move U to (3,5), I eat the food, snake grows to 7 segments. New head at (3,5), and the tail stays where it is? No, when you eat, the tail doesn't move immediately; the snake grows, so when you move to a food cell, you eat it, and on the next move, the tail doesn't advance, so the snake gets longer.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when head moves to food, it eats, and on that move, the head occupies the food cell, and the body doesn't move, so the snake gains a segment. Then on subsequent moves, the tail moves as usual.\n> \n> So if I move to (3,5) on turn 17, I eat the food, so new positions: head at (3,5), then the body: since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so positions become: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)] – now 7 segments.\n> \n> Then head direction becomes Up.\n> \n> If I move Right to (4,4), no food there, so head moves to (4,4), tail moves to next, so positions: head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) – and tail (4,2) moves off? Since no growth, the last segment is removed, so snake becomes [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] – 6 segments still.\n> \n> Current snake: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)] – so after moving right to (4,4), new head (4,4), then the body: previous head (3,4) becomes first body, so [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] and the tail (4,2) is gone since no growth. So positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] – now tail is (4,1).\n> \n> (4,1) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (5,1) and (6,1), but (4,1) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> But (4,1) was part of the snake body before, but after move, it's the tail.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving Up to eat the food at (3,5).\n> \n> After eating, head at (3,5), body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) – tail at (4,2).\n> \n> Grid: (3,5) is y=5, x=3. Borders: y=7 is top, y=0 bottom, so (3,5) is safe.\n> \n> From (3,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,6)\n> \n> - D: to (3,4) – but (3,4) is the first body segment, so if I move down, head to (3,4), which is occupied by body? But (3,4) is the segment right behind head, so when I move, the body should move, but let's see.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So from positions after eating: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n> \n> If I move Up to (3,6), new head (3,6), then body: (3,5) from head, (3,4) from first body, etc., down to (3,1) and (4,1), and tail (4,2) moves to where? The segment at (4,2) was the tail, but since no growth, it should be removed? I think I confused.\n> \n> After eating on turn 17, positions: head (3,5), and segments (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) — so 7 segments.\n> \n> On turn 18, if I move U to (3,6), new head (3,6), then the first body segment moves to the old head position (3,5), second to (3,4), and so on, and the tail segment at (4,2) moves to the position of the previous tail segment? No.\n> \n> The body segments follow: the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1 of the previous turn.\n> \n> After turn 17: positions index 0: head (3,5), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,2), 4: (3,1), 5: (4,1), 6: tail (4,2)\n> \n> On turn 18, move head to (3,6). Then new positions: head (3,6), then body: segment 1 moves to old head pos (3,5), segment 2 moves to old pos of segment 1 which is (3,4), segment 3 to (3,3), segment 4 to (3,2), segment 5 to (3,1), segment 6 to (4,1). And the tail (4,2) is gone since no growth; we have only the segments from 0 to 6, but since head moved, the tail advances, so the cell (4,2) is vacated, and the new tail is at (4,1).\n> \n> New positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] — tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move Down from (3,5) to (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied by body segment 1. After head moves to (3,4), which was segment 1, but segment 1 will move to head's old position (3,5), so (3,4) becomes head, then segment 1 moves to (3,5), segment 2 to (3,4) old? It's messy, but essentially, moving to a body cell causes collision, except for the tail under certain conditions.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, from (3,5), moving Down to (3,4): (3,4) is the first body segment, not the tail. The tail is at (4,2). So moving to (3,4) would cause collision with body, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving Left or Right from (3,5): Left to (2,5), Right to (4,5).\n> \n> (2,5) : is it free? Internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed, so should be free. Walls are specific cells, not whole rows/columns except borders. Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, internal at given points.\n> \n> (2,5): x=2,y=5, not in obstacles list, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5): free.\n> \n> Also, (3,6) up, free.\n> \n> So from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).

No, when no eat, the snake moves forward, tail moves, so length same, but the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> After move to (4,4), positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Now, from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4) but (3,4) is now body segment, so collision if move left?

Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So that means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) for the playable area. Internal obstacles are given: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. So these cells are also blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). So the snake has 7 segments. Head is at (3,5), and direction is U, which is up.

It depends on the move.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn 18, positions: index 0: head (3,5), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,2), 4: (3,1), 5: (4,1), 6: tail (4,2).\n> \n> If I move to a new position, say to cell P.\n> \n> Then the new positions: head at P, then body: previous head (3,5) becomes segment 1, (3,4) becomes segment 2, ..., up to (4,1) becomes segment 5? Let's list:\n> \n> After move, new head at P, then the body segments are: old position of segment 0 (which was head), then old segment 1, old segment 2, ..., old segment 5, and tail old segment 6 is gone? No.\n> \n> The snake moves: the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail segment moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, for a snake of length L, after move, the new positions are: [new_head, old_head, old_segment1, ..., old_segment_{L-2}], so the last segment, tail, is removed from its position.\n> \n> Therefore, the cell that was occupied by the tail is now free, unless we eat food.\n> \n> If we eat food, we grow, so tail doesn't move, we add a segment.\n> \n> But for collision: when moving, the head moves to a new cell. If that cell is occupied by a body segment, it's collision, except if it is the current tail position, because after the move, the tail leaves that cell, so it's not occupied anymore.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is at (4,2).\n> \n> So, from head (3,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,6) - what is here?

Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the right to reach (4,5) from previous position.

Let's confirm:\n> \n> - Border walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is a wall and can't be moved to.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are also blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), body at (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So the snake is currently forming a sort of L-shape or something. From (4,1) to (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5) to head at (4,5). So body goes down from (3,1) to (3,5), then head at (4,5) which is to the right.\n> \n> Head direction is R, so it just moved right to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from current position: head at (4,5), direction R.

So possible moves: Up (U) to (4,6), Down (D) to (4,4), Right (R) to (5,5), but not Left.\n> \n> Also, need to check for collisions.\n> \n> First, check adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (4,6) - is this valid? y=6, but y=7 is wall, so y=6 is within 1 to 6, I think. y from 1 to 6 is playable? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are free, similarly x=1 to 6.\n> \n> - (4,6): y=6, which is not y=7, so not border wall. Check if obstacle: internal obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). None is (4,6), so clear. Also, snake body: snake is at (3,5), (3,4), etc., not at (4,6), so should be safe to move to, but after moving, the tail will move, so we need to consider where the head moves relative to the body after the move.\n> \n> General rule: when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body except the tail, it collides. But if it's the tail, and tail moves away, it's ok, as long as head doesn't collide with other body parts.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 19 move:\n> \n> Head at (4,5), moving to a direction.\n> \n> If I move Up to (4,6), what is at (4,6)?

Snake positions: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), etc. So (4,4) is not listed, so empty.\n> \n> If I move Right to (5,5), (5,5) is not occupied, no obstacle.\n> \n> Now, also, food locations: (5,6) and (1,5).\n> \n> (5,6) is above and right of head? Head at (4,5), so (5,6) is northeast, but since we move one step at a time, to reach (5,6), I need to go right then up or up then right, but not directly.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) is left, but since I can't move left immediately because of no reverse.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. Also, consider the food life spans.\n> \n> Food at (5,6) life span 7, so disappears at turn 26. Current turn 19, so it has from turn 20 to 25 to be eaten? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 19, life span 7, meaning after 7 turns it disappears. So if not eaten by turn 25, it's gone at turn 26. Similarly, for (1,5), life span 10, disappears at turn 29.\n> \n> But we need to eat it before it disappears.\n> \n> Now, also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, what is the tail? Snake positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1). So tail is at (4,1).\n> \n> Is there food at tail? Food is at (5,6) and (1,5), not at (4,1), so no food on tail currently.\n> \n> But after moving, if we eat food, tail grows, so the last segment stays or something? When we eat positive food, length increases by one, so after eating, the tail doesn't move for that turn, I think. Standard snake rules: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so you grow.\n> \n> In this case, for movement: each turn, head moves to new cell, if that cell has food, you eat it, and if positive, length increases, so tail doesn't move; if negative, no growth, tail moves as usual. If no food, tail moves.\n> \n> But in this state, no food at head position now.\n> \n> Also, for tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (4,1), head at (4,5), not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x or y, diff by 1.\n> \n> (4,5) and (4,1) have diff y=4, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, so for head, adjacent are (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5).\n> \n> Tail at (4,1), adjacent are (4,2), (4,0) but y=0 wall, (3,1), (5,1) but (5,1) is obstacle? Internal obstacle (5,1), so (5,1) is blocked.\n> \n> (3,1) is body segment, not tail. Tail is (4,1), so adjacent: (4,0) wall, (4,2) which is body? Snake has (3,1) and (4,1), (3,1) is second last, (4,1) tail. So (4,2) is not occupied, I think. Positions: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) — (3,2) is before (3,1), so cells: (3,2) at y=2, (3,1) y=1, (4,1) x=4,y=1. So (4,2) is empty, (5,1) obstacle, (4,0) wall, (3,1) occupied.

Snake positions: new head (5,6), body: previous head (5,5) becomes first body, then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), and tail (4,1) stays because growth.\n> \n> When you eat, tail doesn't move, so segments: after move to (5,6), head is (5,6), then previous positions except tail is not removed, so body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), and tail (4,1) remains.\n> \n> Snake positions before turn 19 move: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1)\n> \n> After turn 19 move R to (5,5): head moves to (5,5), so new positions: head (5,5), then (4,5) becomes first body, then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), and tail (4,1) moves?

(4,1) was tail, removed. New tail is (3,1)? Let's list:\n> \n> Previous positions: index 0: head (4,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (3,4), 3: (3,3), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,1), 6: tail (4,1)\n> \n> After move R to (5,5), new head (5,5). The body segments: the first body is the previous head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). The tail (4,1) is removed since no food eaten. So new positions: head (5,5), body: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and tail (3,1). (3,1) is now tail.\n> \n> Length still 7.\n> \n> Then on turn 20, I move U to (5,6). Now (5,6) has food, so I eat it. After move, head at (5,6), and since food eaten, tail doesn't move. So positions: head (5,6), body: previous head (5,5) becomes first body, then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), and tail (3,1) stays? No.\n> \n> After move to (5,6), new head (5,6). Body: the previous head (5,5) is added as first body segment. Then the existing body segments: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and tail (3,1). But since food eaten, tail is not removed, so all segments remain, with new head. So positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and tail (3,1).

        "thinking": "Let's analyze the current state and possible moves step-by-step to determine the best immediate action for Turn 20.\n\n### Current State (Turn 20):\n- **Snake Positions**: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] (head at (5,5), moving right)\n- **Head Direction**: R (cannot move left next turn due to no instant reverse)\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,6): value +1, life span 6 (disappears after Turn 25)\n  - (1,5): value +1, life span 9 (disappears after Turn 28)\n\n### Possible Moves from (5,5):\n1. **U (Up) to (5,6)**:\n   - (5,6) has positive food (+1 score, length +1).\n   - Check safety:\n     - Not a wall or body collision (current body is at y ≤ 5).\n     - No tail reward danger (tail is at (3,1), not adjacent to head).\n   - Outcome: Eat food, grow to length 8, head at (5,6), direction U.\n   - Next moves: From (5,6), can go L to (4,6) or R to (6,6) (U is wall, D is body/reverse).\n\n2. **D (Down) to (5,4)**:\n   - (5,4) is free (no wall, no body, no food).\n   - Outcome: No score, length remains 7, head at (5,4), direction D.\n   - Next moves: From (5,4), can go D to (5,3) or L to (4,4) (U is body, R is wall at (6,4)).\n\n3. **R (Right) to (6,5)**:\n   - (6,5) is free (no wall, no body, no food).\n   - Outcome: No score, length remains 7, head at (6,5), direction R.\n   - Next moves: From (6,5), only U to (6,6) is valid (D is wall at (6,4), L is body/reverse, R is wall at (7,5)).\n\n### Evaluation:\n- **Eating (5,6) (Move U)**:\n  - Immediate reward (+1 score, length +1).\n  - Risk: After eating, the snake is longer, and future moves may lead to dead ends (e.g., forced to eat (1,5) and die).\n  - However, (5,6) disappears soon (Turn 25), so delaying may miss the opportunity.\n\n- **Avoiding (5,6) (Move D or R)**:\n  - Move D: Leads to less risky area but away from food.\n  - Move R: Traps the snake near walls, limiting future options.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate action is to **eat the food at (5,6)** to maximize score, as avoiding it may lead to missing the opportunity (short life span). While future moves may be constrained, the snake can attempt to maneuver carefully afterward.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{U}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 20 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(6, 4), (5, 1), (2, 4), (6, 1), (1, 2)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (5, 6, 6, 1)\n\t- (1, 5, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 20 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game.\n> \n> - Current turn: t = 20\n> \n> - Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls. Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these are also walls; I must avoid them.\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head at (5,5), then body segments at (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So the snake is moving right, since head direction is R, and from (4,5) to (5,5) is right, so current direction is right.\n> \n> - Food:\n> - (5,6) with value 1 and life span 6\n> - (1,5) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> Both foods are positive, since value is +1. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: For (5,6), life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including the current turn, so it will be gone by turn 26 if not eaten. Similarly, (1,5) has life span 9, so it disappears after turn 29.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,5), moving right. So possible moves from here: Since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L (opposite direction) because of no instant reverse. Current direction is R, so I cannot move left immediately. Possible actions: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n> \n> Let's list the possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,6) – but (5,6) has food? Yes, (5,6) is a food position with value 1.\n> \n> - D: to (5,4) – is this valid? Let's check walls and body.\n> \n> - R: to (6,5) – but (6,5) might be wall? Walls are x=7 is border, so (6,5) should be ok, but internal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, (6,1) is wall, but (6,5) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (6,5) is not an obstacle, so it should be free.\n> \n> Now, body positions: Snake positions are (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So (5,4) is not occupied, (6,5) not occupied, (5,6) has food but might be eaten if I move there.\n> \n> (5,6) has food, but I need to move to it to eat it.\n> \n> Now, about the food under body: (5,6) is not under body; body is at (5,5) and below, but (5,6) is above, so not under. Similarly, (1,5) is far away.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: Head is at (5,5), tail is at (3,1). Is head adjacent to tail? Tail is at (3,1), head at (5,5), distance is |5-3| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. (5,5) to (3,1) is not adjacent; neighbors would be (5,6), (5,4), (4,5), (6,5). Tail is at (3,1), which is not adjacent, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls at borders and internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (5,5), body: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So the snake has a long body going left to (3,5), then down to (3,1).\n> \n> Food at (5,6) and (1,5).\n> \n> (1,5) has life span 9, so it will be there until turn 29, since current turn 20, life span 9 means it disappears after 9 turns from now, so available on turns 20 to 28? Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so at turn t+N it is gone. Turn t: life span N, after turn t it becomes N-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So for (5,6), life span 6 at turn 20, so:\n> \n> - Turn 20: life span 6\n> \n> - Turn 21: 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 25: 1\n> \n> - Turn 26: 0, disappears, so not available on turn 26.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life span 9:\n> \n> - Turn 20: 9\n> \n> - Turn 21: 8\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 28: 1\n> \n> - Turn 29: 0, disappears.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action for turn 20, then sequence for future turns, but the sequence should be for immediate actions, but I need to think ahead.\n> \n> The answer format says: Action Sequence for turns t1, t1+1, etc., up to some point, but it doesn't specify how many; it says \"in order\" but probably for the next few turns, as part of planning.\n> \n> It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"Action Sequence\" for multiple turns.\n> \n> But in practice, I need to output a sequence starting from turn 20.\n> \n> Also, since the state might change after each turn, I need to simulate.\n> \n> But I don't know future food, so I have to base on current knowledge.\n> \n> For now, only these two foods are present.\n> \n> I should consider paths to eat food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, from current position (5,5), head direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,6): this is food, so eating it would increase length by 1 and score +1.

Also, not occupied by body, as body is at lower y.\n> \n> But if I move to (5,6), I eat the food, so new head at (5,6), and tail grows, so the body segments: previous head was (5,5), which becomes body, and tail doesn't move because we ate, so snake becomes: head (5,6), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So length increases by one.\n> \n> Now, is this move safe?

Let's see.\n> \n> (4,6): not border, not internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,6) not listed, so should be free. Also, not occupied by snake body? Body: after move, positions: (5,6) head, (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So (4,6) is not occupied.\n> \n> R to (6,6): similarly, not wall, not obstacle? (6,6): x=6, y=6, borders x=7,y=7 exist, but (6,6) is not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, but (6,6) is different, so should be free. Not occupied.\n> \n> D to (5,5): but (5,5) is now body, so if I move down, I collide with body.

When moving without eating, tail moves, so from 8 segments, head moves to new position, tail is removed, so 7 segments? Let's clarify.\n> \n> When you move to a cell without food, the snake moves: head to new cell, each body segment to previous position, tail is removed, so length same.\n> \n> When you eat food, head moves to food, body segments follow, tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Turn 20: move to (5,6) with food, so eat: head to (5,6), body: previous head (5,5) becomes new neck, etc., tail (3,1) remains, so snake has 8 segments: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1).\n> \n> Turn 21: move to (6,6), no food there, so move without eating: head to (6,6), then (5,6) becomes body, (5,5) body, (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — and tail (3,1) is removed, so positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]? Length should be 8, but when moving without eating, tail is removed, so from 8 segments, after moving to empty cell, head new position, body shifts, tail cell is free, so new length 7 segments.\n> \n> Initial snake before turn 20: 7 segments.\n> \n> Turn 20: eat food at (5,6), so length becomes 8.\n> \n> Turn 21: move to (6,6) no food, so snake moves: head to (6,6), body: (5,6) to where head was, (5,5) to where (5,6) was, (4,5) to (5,5), (3,5) to (4,5), (3,4) to (3,5), (3,3) to (3,4), (3,2) to (3,3), and (3,1) is left, not part of snake anymore. So new positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), and (3,2) is the last? Segments: index 0 head (6,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,3), 7: (3,2). So 8 segments, but (3,2) is the tail, and (3,1) is gone. Length still 8? No: when you move to empty cell, tail is removed, so length decreases to 7.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, length increases; when you move without eating, length stays the same, but the tail moves.\n> \n> Start with length L.\n> \n> After eating, length L+1.\n> \n> After moving without eating, length L (same as before).\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Before turn 20: length 7.\n> \n> Turn 20: eat at (5,6), so after move, length 8.\n> \n> Turn 21: move to (6,6) no food, so after move, length 8, but the snake shifts: head new position, body follows, tail is at the old second-last position, so the last segment is removed? No.\n> \n> Positions: let's say at turn t, positions P_t = [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n> \n> Move to new cell C:\n> \n> - If C has food, new positions: [C, head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail] length L+1\n> \n> - If no food, new positions: [C, head, seg1, seg2, ..., seg_{L-2}] and tail position is abandoned, so length L, but the segments are C, head, seg1, ..., up to the previous tail minus one? No.\n> \n> For example, initial: positions [A,B,C,D] length 4.\n> \n> Move to E with food: [E,A,B,C,D] length 5.\n> \n> Move to F no food: [F,E,A,B,C] length 5, D is gone.\n> \n> In the no food case, it's [new_head, old_head, old_seg1, ..., old_seg_{L-2}], and old_tail is removed.\n> \n> So for turn 21: after eating on 20, positions [ (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ] length 8.\n> \n> Move to (6,6) no food: new positions [ (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) ] and (3,1) gone.

Turn t: life span N, after turn t it becomes N-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So for (5,6), life span 6 at turn 20, so:\n> \n> - Turn 20: life span 6\n> \n> - Turn 21: 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 25: 1\n> \n> - Turn 26: 0, disappears, so not available on turn 26.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) life span 9:\n> \n> - Turn 20: 9\n> \n> - Turn 21: 8\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 28: 1\n> \n> - Turn 29: 0, disappears.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action for turn 20, then sequence for future turns, but the sequence should be for immediate actions, but I need to think ahead.\n> \n> The answer format says: Action Sequence for turns t1, t1+1, etc., up to some point, but it doesn't specify how many; it says \"in order\" but probably for the next few turns, as part of planning.\n> \n> It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"Action Sequence\" for multiple turns.\n> \n> But in practice, I need to output a sequence starting from turn 20.\n> \n> Also, since the state might change after each turn, I need to simulate.\n> \n> But I don't know future food, so I have to base on current knowledge.\n> \n> For now, only these two foods are present.\n> \n> I should consider paths to eat food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, from current position (5,5), head direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,6): this is food, so eating it would increase length by 1 and score +1. But I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> (5,6): is it a wall? Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,6) y=6<7, x=5 between 0 and 7, not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), etc., not (5,6), so free. Also, not occupied by body, as body is at lower y.\n> \n> But if I move to (5,6), I eat the food, so new head at (5,6), and tail grows, so the body segments: previous head was (5,5), which becomes body, and tail doesn't move because we ate, so snake becomes: head (5,6), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So length increases by one.\n> \n> Now, is this move safe? After moving to (5,6), what are the next moves?\n> \n> Head at (5,6), direction U (since moved up).\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,6): U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move down (opposite of up), so can move U, L, R.\n> \n> U to (5,7): but y=7 is border wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> L to (4,6): is this free? Let's see.\n> \n> (4,6): not border, not internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (4,6) not listed, so should be free. Also, not occupied by snake body? Body: after move, positions: (5,6) head, (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). So (4,6) is not occupied.\n> \n> R to (6,6): similarly, not wall, not obstacle? (6,6): x=6, y=6, borders x=7,y=7 exist, but (6,6) is not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4) is wall, but (6,6) is different, so should be free. Not occupied.\n> \n> D to (5,5): but (5,5) is now body, so if I move down, I collide with body. Also, cannot move down because it would be instant reverse if I just moved up.\n> \n> From (5,6), after moving U to it, direction is U, so possible moves: U (to (5,7) wall, invalid), D (to (5,5) body, invalid and also reverse), L (to (4,6)), R (to (6,6)).\n> \n> So only L or R are possible.\n> \n> If I go L to (4,6), or R to (6,6).\n> \n> But (6,6) might be near obstacles. (6,4) is wall, but (6,6) is above.\n> \n> Now, the other food at (1,5) is far, with life span 9, so I have time.\n> \n> But if I eat (5,6) now, I might be trapped or something.\n> \n> After eating (5,6), head at (5,6), I can go left to (4,6) or right to (6,6).\n> \n> Suppose I go left to (4,6).\n> \n> Then head at (4,6), direction L (since left from (5,6)).\n> \n> Then from (4,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse, so cannot move right (opposite of left), so U to (4,7), D to (4,5), L to (3,6).\n> \n> (4,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> (4,5): is (4,5) occupied? Current body after eating: head (4,6), then previous (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)? Positions: after moving to (4,6), body: head (4,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)? Let's sequence.\n> \n> Turn 20: move U to (5,6), eat food. Snake: head (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). Length 8 now.\n> \n> Then turn 21: move L to (4,6). Now head (4,6), then body: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). (4,5) is body, but (4,5) is at position.\n> \n> From (4,6), moving to (4,5) is down? (4,6) to (4,5) is down, but direction: I moved left to (4,6), so direction is L. Moving down to (4,5) is not reverse; reverse would be right to (5,6). Down is perpendicular, so allowed.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,6):\n> \n> - U to (4,7): y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D to (4,5): (4,5) is a body segment? In current positions, (4,5) is the fourth segment? List: head (4,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), ... so (4,5) is occupied by body, so moving to (4,5) would collide.\n> \n> - L to (3,6): not wall, not obstacle? (3,6): x=3,y=6, not border, internal obstacles not there, and not occupied? Body positions: (4,6) head, (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), etc., so (3,6) not occupied.\n> \n> - R to (5,6): but (5,6) is the previous head, now body, so occupied, and also reverse direction, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (3,6).\n> \n> Then head at (3,6), direction L.\n> \n> Then from (3,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> No reverse: direction L, so cannot move R.\n> \n> U to (3,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (3,5): (3,5) is body?

So free.\n> \n> If I move D to (5,4), no food there, so no eat, snake moves, tail moves, so head (5,4), then body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and tail (3,1) moves away, so snake: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] length same.\n> \n> Then from (5,4), direction D, so possible moves U, D, L, R but no reverse, cannot move up to (5,5) body.\n> \n> U to (5,5): body, invalid.\n> \n> D to (5,3): not wall, not obstacle, not occupied?

After moving to (6,6), body: head (6,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), etc. (6,5) not in body, it was the previous position but tail moved? When I moved to (6,6) on turn 21, body: head (6,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) and (3,1) gone? After eating on turn 20, snake is length 8: positions (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1).\n> \n> Turn 20: move U to (5,6), eat, snake: head (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — 8 segments.\n> \n> Turn 21: move R to (6,6), no food, so snake moves: head (6,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,1) gone, length 8? When moving without eating, tail moves, so from 8 segments, head moves to new position, tail is removed, so 7 segments? Let's clarify.\n> \n> When you move to a cell without food, the snake moves: head to new cell, each body segment to previous position, tail is removed, so length same.\n> \n> When you eat food, head moves to food, body segments follow, tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Turn 20: move to (5,6) with food, so eat: head to (5,6), body: previous head (5,5) becomes new neck, etc., tail (3,1) remains, so snake has 8 segments: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1).\n> \n> Turn 21: move to (6,6), no food there, so move without eating: head to (6,6), then (5,6) becomes body, (5,5) body, (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — and tail (3,1) is removed, so positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]? Length should be 8, but when moving without eating, tail is removed, so from 8 segments, after moving to empty cell, head new position, body shifts, tail cell is free, so new length 7 segments.\n> \n> Initial snake before turn 20: 7 segments.\n> \n> Turn 20: eat food at (5,6), so length becomes 8.\n> \n> Turn 21: move to (6,6) no food, so snake moves: head to (6,6), body: (5,6) to where head was, (5,5) to where (5,6) was, (4,5) to (5,5), (3,5) to (4,5), (3,4) to (3,5), (3,3) to (3,4), (3,2) to (3,3), and (3,1) is left, not part of snake anymore. So new positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), and (3,2) is the last? Segments: index 0 head (6,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,3), 7: (3,2). So 8 segments, but (3,2) is the tail, and (3,1) is gone. Length still 8? No: when you move to empty cell, tail is removed, so length decreases to 7.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, length increases; when you move without eating, length stays the same, but the tail moves.\n> \n> Start with length L.\n> \n> After eating, length L+1.\n> \n> After moving without eating, length L (same as before).\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Before turn 20: length 7.\n> \n> Turn 20: eat at (5,6), so after move, length 8.\n> \n> Turn 21: move to (6,6) no food, so after move, length 8, but the snake shifts: head new position, body follows, tail is at the old second-last position, so the last segment is removed? No.\n> \n> Positions: let's say at turn t, positions P_t = [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n> \n> Move to new cell C:\n> \n> - If C has food, new positions: [C, head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail] length L+1\n> \n> - If no food, new positions: [C, head, seg1, seg2, ..., seg_{L-2}] and tail position is abandoned, so length L, but the segments are C, head, seg1, ..., up to the previous tail minus one? No.\n> \n> For example, initial: positions [A,B,C,D] length 4.\n> \n> Move to E with food: [E,A,B,C,D] length 5.\n> \n> Move to F no food: [F,E,A,B,C] length 5, D is gone.\n> \n> In the no food case, it's [new_head, old_head, old_seg1, ..., old_seg_{L-2}], and old_tail is removed.\n> \n> So for turn 21: after eating on 20, positions [ (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ] length 8.\n> \n> Move to (6,6) no food: new positions [ (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) ] and (3,1) gone.

Let's see.\n> \n> Standard: when head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, effectively growing.\n> \n> So after moving to (1,5) and eating:\n> \n> - Head: (1,5)\n> \n> - New body: the previous head (1,6) becomes first body segment\n> \n> - Then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)  // and since we eat, we add a new segment at the old tail position, which was (3,5), but (3,5) is now part of the body, it's messy.\n> \n> Positions before move: head (1,6), body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (1,5) and eating:\n> \n> - Head moves to (1,5)\n> \n> - The body segments remain in place, but since head moved, the neck moves to where head was, etc., but when eating, the tail doesn't advance.\n> \n> So new positions: head (1,5), then the previous positions of the body are kept, and a new segment is added at the tail end.\n> \n> So: head (1,5), then body segments: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), and the tail (3,5) remains, but now there is an additional segment where the tail was, so the new tail is still at (3,5), but it's the same cell? No.\n> \n> The body segments: after head moves to (1,5), the first body segment is at (1,6), which was the previous head position.\n> \n> Then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), and the last body segment is at (3,5), which was the tail. Since we eat, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, so there is a new segment at (3,5), but (3,5) was already occupied? Confusion.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, when head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment at the tail position. The body segments between head and tail remain the same.\n> \n> So in terms of positions: the new head is at the food cell, and the tail stays where it is, so the length increases by one, with the new segment at the tail position.\n> \n> But the tail position might be occupied by the old tail, but it's the same cell.\n> \n> For example, before eat: positions: H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T\n> \n> After eating at new cell F: new head at F, then the body is H (previous head), B1, B2, ..., Bk, and T (tail), so positions: F, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T\n> \n> The tail T remains, and it's not moved, so the new segment is added at T, but since T is already there, it's just that the tail doesn't advance, so the new tail is T, and there is an additional segment Bk or something.\n> \n> In list form: suppose positions [H, B1, B2, B3, T] for length 5.\n> \n> After moving to a non-food cell: new positions [new H, H, B1, B2] and T removed, so [new H, H, B1, B2] for length 4 if no eat, but with eat.\n> \n> After moving to food cell: head moves to F, then positions are [F, H, B1, B2, T] for length 5, but now with new segment, it should be length 6, so [F, H, B1, B2, T, new T?] I think I have it.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell with food, the head occupies the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the body segments remain in place, but the head has moved, so the new positions are: the new head at F, then the previous head becomes the first body segment, the previous body segments follow, and the tail remains, so the list has one more segment.\n> \n> For example: before: [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> After eating at F: [F, H, B1, B2, T]  // T is the tail, and B2 was before, but now B2 is still there, and T is added as new segment? [F, H, B1, B2, T] means positions F, then H, then B1, then B2, then T, so the tail is at T, and the segment at B2 is still there.\n> \n> In terms of cells: the cell F is new head, cell H is now body, cell B1 is body, cell B2 is body, cell T is tail, so the snake occupies F, H, B1, B2, T, which is 5 cells, but originally it was 4 cells: H, B1, B2, T, so after eating, it should be 5 cells: F, H, B1, B2, and T is still there, but T is not moved, so the new tail is T, and no new cell is added except F, but F is the new head position.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that the tail position remains occupied, and the head moves to F, so the snake grows by one cell at the head end, effectively.\n> \n> In position list: new list is [F] + old list, so for old list [H, B1, B2, T], new list [F, H, B1, B2, T], but T is the same as before, so the tail is at T, and the new length is old length +1.\n> \n> In this case, the cell T is still occupied, but it's the tail.\n> \n> In our case, at turn 24, before moving to (1,5), positions are head (1,6), body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n> \n> After moving to (1,5) and eating food there:\n> \n> New positions: head at (1,5), then previous head (1,6), then body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), and tail (3,5) remains, so new tail at (3,5).\n> \n> The positions are: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)  // so 9 segments, tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, check for Tail Reward Danger: is head adjacent to tail when eating?\n> \n> Head at (1,5), tail at (3,5), not adjacent; (1,5) and (3,5) are two steps apart, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (1,5) is adjacent to (1,6), (1,4), (0,5), (2,5), but not to (3,5).\n> \n> So no danger, eating is safe.\n> \n> Then snake grows to 9 segments.\n> \n> But at turn 24, we are at (1,6), and moving to (1,5) to eat.\n> \n> But first, for turn 23, we must move left to (2,6), as only choice.\n> \n> Then at turn 24, from (2,6), we can choose to go left to (1,6) or down to (2,5).\n> \n> If we go left to (1,6), then at turn 25, we must go down to (1,5) to eat the food, as only move.\n> \n> Then we grow.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead, so what after that.\n> \n> After eating at (1,5), head at (1,5), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Then from (1,5), possible moves: left to (0,5) wall, invalid; up to (1,6) but (1,6) is body segment, and moving up is opposite to current direction D?

Borders are walls, but (2,5) is within bounds, x=2 between 0 and7, y=5 between 0 and7, not border, and not in internal obstacles: internal are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).

After turn 24, it becomes 4, and so on. After turn 28, it becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 29. So it can be eaten from turn 24 to 28 inclusive? Turn 24: if eaten on turn 24, life_span was 5, eaten. Turn 25: life_span=4, can be eaten, up to turn 28: life_span=1, eaten, then after that, gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life_span=8, so it will last until turn 31 or something.\n> \n> But since we're planning for 5+ turns, turn 24 to 29 or so.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves.\n> \n> From (2,6), I can go down to (2,5) or left to (1,6).\n> \n> If I go down to (2,5), what happens?\n> \n> (2,5) is free, I move there. Then the snake head is at (2,5), and the body follows: the tail (3,4) moves away, but since I moved down, the new head is (2,5), then the body: previous head (2,6) becomes body, so positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail was (3,4), but since I moved, the tail moves to the next position, but I didn't eat food, so length same, tail moves away from (3,4).\n> \n> When I move to a new cell without food, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed.

It's turn 25. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Snake positions: head at (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). Head direction is D, which is down. But since the head is at (2,5) and moving down, that would be to (2,4), but (2,4) is an obstacle? Let me check.\n> \n> Internal obstacles include (2,4), so moving down to (2,4) is impossible because it's a wall. Head direction is D, but since (2,4) is blocked, I can't move down. But the snake must move in one of the possible directions: U, D, L, R, but D is blocked by wall at (2,4).\n> \n> Snake head is at (2,5), direction is D, but (2,4) is a wall, so I need to choose a different direction for this turn. The head direction given is the current direction, but I can change it as long as it's not an instant reverse. Since direction is D, I can't go U immediately, but I can go L or R.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - Up (U) to (2,6): but (2,6) is the second segment of the snake, so it's the body. Moving there would cause collision, except if it's the tail? Let's see the snake positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> So (2,6) is the first body segment. If I move up to (2,6), head touches body, which is deadly, unless it's the tail and tail moves, but here (2,6) is not the tail; the tail is at (3,5). So moving to (2,6) would collide with body segment.\n> \n> - Down (D) to (2,4): but (2,4) is an internal obstacle, wall, so can't move there.\n> \n> - Left (L) to (1,5): is that possible? x=1, y=5. Check walls: border walls are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,5) is not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is one, but (1,5) not listed, so should be free. But is there food or something? I need to see if it's occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,5) is not in the list, so it should be empty. But there is food at (1,5,4,1) which means (1,5) with value 1 and life span 4.\n> \n> Food positions: (1,5,4,1), (6,2,7,1), (3,1,10,1). So (1,5) has food.\n> \n> But when I move to (1,5), I might eat it if it's accessible.\n> \n> - Right (R) to (3,5): (3,5) is the last segment, the tail. Snake positions end with (3,5), so (3,5) is the tail.\n> \n> If I move right to (3,5), since it's the tail, and tail will move, so it should be safe, as long as after moving, the head is on the tail position, and tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> General rule: moving into the tail cell is safe because the tail moves forward, so the head takes the tail position, and tail is no longer there.\n> \n> Similarly, body collision only if it's not the tail.\n> \n> So from (2,5):\n> \n> - U to (2,6): occupied by body segment (index 1), not tail, so collision, death.\n> \n> - D to (2,4): wall, death.\n> \n> - L to (1,5): empty? Snake positions don't have (1,5), and walls: border not an issue, internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,5) not listed, so free.

Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So cells like (0,y) or (7,y) or (x,0) or (x,7) are walls, cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).

Usually in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? In the context, it might not matter, but let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, for visualization, but actually for movement, it's just coordinates.\n> \n> Head at (2,5), direction down, but since down is blocked, we have to choose L or R.\n> \n> Food: (1,5) with value 1, life span 4. Life span 4 means it disappears after 4 turns, including this turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Turn t1=25, so food at (1,5) has life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 28? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn 25, life span 4, so after turn 25, it has 3 left? Or at the start of turn 25, it has 4, and after the turn, it decreases.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the beginning of turn t, if food has life span L, then during turn t, it is present, and at the end of turn t, life span decreases to L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears, so not available on next turn.\n> \n> For example, life span 4 at turn 25: on turn 25, it is present. After turn 25, life span becomes 3. On turn 26, it is present, life span 3, after turn 26, becomes 2, and so on. After turn 28, life span becomes 0, so on turn 29, it is gone.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,2) life span 7, so will last until turn 31? Turn 25: life span 7, after turn 25:6, turn 26:5, ..., after turn 31:0, gone on turn 32.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) life span 10, lasts longer.\n> \n> Now, back to choices: at turn 25, from (2,5), I can go L to (1,5) or R to (3,5).\n> \n> If I go L to (1,5): that cell has positive food, value 1. So I eat it, snake length increases by 1, so new head at (1,5), and a new segment added, so tail doesn't move? When you eat food, you grow, so the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail stays in place.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food, so when eaten, head moves to food, new segment added at the end, tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Similarly, for negative food, length unchanged, head moves, tail moves.\n> \n> But here, positive food.\n> \n> So if I move to (1,5), I eat the food, so head is now at (1,5), and since I ate, I grow, so the new snake positions: head (1,5), then previous head (2,5) becomes second segment, but (2,5) was head, now body, and then (2,6), (3,6), etc., up to tail (3,5), but since I grew, a new segment is added, so tail remains (3,5), and positions are: (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail is still (3,5)? No.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (2,5) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (5,6), 5: (5,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving left to (1,5) and eating food: head moves to (1,5), and since food is eaten, a new segment is added at the tail end, so the tail doesn't move. So new positions: head at (1,5), then the previous segments: (2,5) becomes segment 1, (2,6) segment 2, ..., up to (3,5) segment 7, and since we add a new segment, it should be at the tail position? No.\n> \n> When snake grows: the head moves to the new cell, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail position stays, but now it's part of the body, and the segment before tail becomes the new tail? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is created at the previous tail position, extending the snake.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move: positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., P_k] where P0 head, P_k tail.\n> \n> After moving to a cell without eating: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail moves away from P_k.\n> \n> After moving to food and eating: head moves to food, each segment moves to the next position, but the tail stays at P_k, and a new segment is added at P_k, so the snake becomes [new_head, P0, P1, ..., P_k] with new_head being the food cell.\n> \n> In this case: before: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n> \n> After moving left to (1,5) and eating: new head at (1,5), then previous head (2,5) becomes first body segment, then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), and tail (3,5) stays, but since we add a new segment, the new tail is still (3,5)? Positions: [ (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] so now there are 9 segments, tail at (3,5).\n> \n> The cell (3,5) was tail before, now it's the second last, and (4,5) was before tail, now it's the new tail?

It's turn 26. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), then body segments: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving to the right to reach (3,5) from previous position? Let me trace the movement.\n> \n> The positions are listed from head to tail: (3,5) is head, then (2,5), which is left of head, so it came from left? Head direction is given as R, which should be the current direction it's facing or just moved. Since it moved to (3,5) with direction R, that means it was at (2,5) before and moved right to (3,5). But (2,5) is the second segment, so the previous head position was (2,5), and it moved right to (3,5). Then the tail is at (4,5), and after that, when it moves, the tail will move to the next position.\n> \n> In the list: index 0: (3,5) head, index 1: (2,5), index 2: (2,6), index 3: (3,6), index 4: (4,6), index 5: (5,6), index 6: (5,5), index 7: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (1,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including current turn, so at turn 26, for (1,5) it has 3 turns left, meaning it disappears after turn 28 or something? Life span N: it appears and counts down each turn, so if life span is 3 at turn 26, it will be gone after turn 28? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after (t + L - 1) or something? For example, at turn t, life span N, after this turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears before the next turn or after? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it exists for N turns, including the current one if it's present.\n> \n> Perhaps: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it will be there for this turn, and then life span becomes L-1 for next turn. If L=1, it disappears after this turn.\n> \n> So for (1,5): life span 3 at turn 26, so it will be available on turns 26, 27, 28? After turn 28, it disappears, so it can be eaten on turn 28 if head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): life span 6, available until turn 31? Turn 26 + 5 = 31? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 26: life span 3 for (1,5), so it can be eaten on turn 26,27,28. After turn 28, gone.\n> \n> - (6,2): life span 6, can be eaten on turn 26 to 31? Turn 26: L=6, after turn, L=5 for turn 27, ..., turn 31: L=1, after turn, disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 31.\n> \n> Turn t with life span L: it exists on turn t, and for L-1 more turns? So it can be eaten from turn t to t + L - 1.\n> \n> For (1,5): L=3 at t=26, can be eaten on turn 26,27,28. Disappears after turn 28.\n> \n> For (6,2): L=6 at t=26, can be eaten on turn 26 to 31 (since 26+5=31, turn 31 has L=1).\n> \n> Turn 26: L=6\n> \n> Turn 27: L=5\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 31: L=1\n> \n> Then after turn 31, L=0, disappears, so eaten only up to turn 31.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): L=9 at t=26, can be eaten up to turn 34.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,5), direction R. Current possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L (because L is opposite of R, and no instant reverse). So possible actions: U, D, R. L is not allowed because it would be opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So since current direction is R, I cannot move L on this turn.\n> \n> So actions for turn 26: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So avoid these.\n> \n> Snake body: positions as above.\n> \n> Food: (1,5), (6,2), (3,1)\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the current position.\n> \n> Head at (3,5). Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,6) but (3,6) is occupied by the snake body, segment index 3? Positions: (3,5) head, (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), ... so (3,6) is a body segment. If I move up to (3,6), it's a body collision, which is deadly. So cannot move U.\n> \n> Current position: (3,5)\n> \n> Move U: (3,5+1) = (3,6) — this is occupied by the snake body (segment 3 in the list, but in the list, index 3 is (3,6), yes. So moving there would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Move D: (3,5-1) = (3,4) — is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> So (3,4) is not in this list, so it might be free, but need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so (3,4) is within 0-7, not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) — (3,4) not there, so (3,4) should be free.\n> \n> But is (3,4) a food? Foods are at (1,5), (6,2), (3,1), so no, (3,4) is empty.\n> \n> Move R: (3+1,5) = (4,5) — but (4,5) is occupied by the tail? Positions: tail is (4,5), segment index 7.\n> \n> If I move to (4,5), which is the current tail, but when I move, the tail will also move, so it might be safe? Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail is allowed because after move, tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, head moves to (4,5), and since the snake moves, the tail at (4,5) will move to the next position, but the tail is at (4,5), and it will move to where? The snake body: when head moves, each segment moves to the next position, but the tail will be left, so the cell (4,5) is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to a new cell, the body follows, so the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment, etc.\n> \n> But in terms of collision: moving to the current tail position is safe because the tail moves away simultaneously.\n> \n> So here, (4,5) is tail, so moving to (4,5) is safe.\n> \n> Now, what about other options.\n> \n> Move L: but L is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed. So only U, D, R possible, but U to (3,6) is body, so not possible. So only D and R possible for turn 26.\n> \n> D: to (3,4)\n> \n> R: to (4,5)\n> \n> Now, (4,5) is currently tail, so moving there is safe.\n> \n> Also, (3,4) is empty.\n> \n> Now, let's see the food.\n> \n> Food at (1,5) which is left, but (1,5) is not directly accessible from (3,5) since I can't move L directly, and (2,5) is body, so I need to go around.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is down-right, (3,1) is down.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence for 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider the consequences of each move on turn 26.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (3,4)\n> \n> Then head at (3,4), and snake positions: new head (3,4), then body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) — and tail (4,5) is gone? Original positions: after move, head moves to (3,4), then the first body segment moves to old head (3,5), second to (2,5), and so on, up to (5,6) moves to (5,5)?

It's turn 27, and I have to plan at least 5 turns ahead, from turn 27 to turn 32.\n> \n> The grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from x=0 to 7 and y=0 to 7, meaning it's an 8x8 grid (since 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells). But x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, let's see: border cells are occupied by walls, so if x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, that's a wall. So for movement, I can't go to those cells. Also, internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,4), then body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5). So the snake has 8 segments. Head is at (3,4), and direction is down. Direction D means moving down, so y decreases? Let's confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but in this context, U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upwards or downwards? U is (x,y+1) – if U is up, then y+1 should be higher y, meaning y increases upwards. But in many games, y=0 is top, but here it says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down. And walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom? No, it says y=0 is a wall, so probably y=0 is the bottom row or top? Let's not assume; I need to be careful.\n> \n> The walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is one edge, y=7 is the opposite edge. Since U is (x,y+1), that might mean moving to higher y, so if y=7 is the top, U increases y towards top. Similarly, D decreases y. But in the grid, cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the playable y are from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive, similarly x from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7 are walls, so for x, 0 and 7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are playable. Similarly y=1 to 6 playable. But internal obstacles also block cells.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (3,4), direction D, down. Down is (x,y-1), so decreasing y.\n> \n> Current head position (3,4), direction D, so last move was down to (3,4). From the positions, before head was at (3,5), I think? Positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), ...] so head is (3,4), then next segment is (3,5), which is above it, so since head is at (3,4) and previous was (3,5), that means it moved down from (3,5) to (3,4), so direction D is consistent.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,5) with life span 2, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 5, value 1\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 8, value 1\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive, no negative food here. Life span: for (1,5) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current, so if not eaten by turn 28, it might disappear? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 27, life span 2, so after turn 27, it decreases to 1, and after turn 28, to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 27 or 28.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 5, so disappears after 5 turns, meaning from turn 27 to 31? Let's see: turn 27, life span 5; after turn 27, it becomes 4; after turn 28, 3; ... after turn 31, it becomes 0 and disappears. So can be eaten until turn 31.\n> \n> Turn 27: food with life span N, it decreases after each turn, so at start of turn, if life span is N, it can be eaten during the turn, and after the turn, life span decreases by 1. So for (1,5) life span 2 at turn 27: eaten on turn 27, life span 2; if not eaten, after turn 27, life span=1; eaten on turn 28, life span=1; after turn 28, if not eaten, life span=0, disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for turns 27 to at least 32, but since food life spans are short, I should consider eating them.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders, so playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n> \n> - Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Now snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,4)\n> \n> Body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n> \n> Tail is at (5,5)\n> \n> Food: (1,5), (6,2), (3,1)\n> \n> Current head direction is D, down.\n> \n> I need to choose actions: U, D, L, R, but cannot instantly reverse, so since current direction is D, I cannot move U (up) on the next turn, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Reverse of D is U, so on turn 27, I can move L, R, or D, but not U.\n> \n> Now, let's see possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - U: (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied by the snake body, so collision if I move there.\n> \n> - D: (3,3) – is this free?

Positions: [ (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) ] but (5,6) was there, and (5,5) removed, so from 8 segments, head moves, tail removed, so 7 segments: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and (5,6) is now the last body segment? Let's index.\n> \n> Original: index 0: (3,4) head, 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (4,6), 6: (5,6), 7: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> After move head to (3,3): new head (3,3), then segment 0 becomes body at (3,4), segment 1 at (3,5), segment 2 at (2,5), segment 3 at (2,6), segment 4 at (3,6), segment 5 at (4,6), segment 6 at (5,6), and segment 7 (tail) is removed. So new positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)] so still 8 segments? No, when not eating, length doesn't increase, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Original length 8, head moves to new cell, if no food, tail cell is vacated, so snake has one less segment temporarily? No: the snake moves: head to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the last segment (tail) is left, and since no food, that cell is free now.\n> \n> So new snake: head at new position, then the first body segment is at old head position, second at old first body, etc., up to the second last segment, and tail is removed.\n> \n> So from 8 segments, after move without eating, 7 segments.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (3,3), then body at (3,4) (old head), then (3,5) (old seg1), (2,5) (old seg2), (2,6) (old seg3), (3,6) (old seg4), (4,6) (old seg5), (5,6) (old seg6), and old tail (5,5) is removed, not part of snake.\n> \n> So new snake: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)] but that's 8 positions? No: (5,6) was old seg6, which is now the last body segment, and there is no tail from old seg7. Original had 8 segments, indices 0 to 7.\n> \n> After move: new segment 0: (3,3) new head\n> \n> Segment 1: old seg0 at (3,4)\n> \n> Segment 2: old seg1 at (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 3: old seg2 at (2,5)\n> \n> Segment 4: old seg3 at (2,6)\n> \n> Segment 5: old seg4 at (3,6)\n> \n> Segment 6: old seg5 at (4,6)\n> \n> Segment 7: old seg6 at (5,6)  // old seg6 was at (5,6), now it is the last segment\n> \n> Old seg7 at (5,5) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake has 7 segments: positions (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) and (5,6)? (5,6) is included, so segments from (3,3) to (5,6), that's 8 cells? Let's count: from (3,3) to (5,6): (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) — that's 8 positions, but we removed the tail, so it should be 7.\n> \n> I think I double-counted. Original positions: 8 cells.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,3): the new position is added at head, and the tail position (5,5) is removed, so the body segments shift: the cell that was head is now the first body, and so on, down to the cell that was second last becomes the new tail.\n> \n> Original: seg0: (3,4) head, seg1: (3,5), seg2: (2,5), seg3: (2,6), seg4: (3,6), seg5: (4,6), seg6: (5,6), seg7: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> After move to (3,3): new seg0: (3,3) new head\n> \n> New seg1: old seg0 position (3,4)  // first body\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1 position (3,5)  // second body\n> \n> New seg3: old seg2 position (2,5)\n> \n> New seg4: old seg3 position (2,6)\n> \n> New seg5: old seg4 position (3,6)\n> \n> New seg6: old seg5 position (4,6)  // new tail, since old seg6 and seg7 are gone?

Body: (4,6) is there, but (4,3) not occupied, so free.\n> \n> All three moves seem possible initially.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (1,5) value 1, life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 28, if not eaten, it will be gone after turn 28, meaning we can only eat it on turn 28.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for (1,5) with life span 1, it will disappear after this turn, so only available on turn 28.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 4, so available for 4 more turns including this one? Countdown decreases, so if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will be present until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L. Countdown starts at L and decreases by 1 each turn.\n> \n> At turn t=28, for (1,5): life span 1, so countdown=1, after this turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So must be eaten on turn 28 to get it.\n> \n> (6,2): life span 4, so available for turns 28,29,30,31, disappears after turn 31.\n> \n> (3,1): life span 7, available turns 28 to 34.\n> \n> (1,4): life span 10, available turns 28 to 37.\n> \n> Now, (1,5) is critical because it will disappear after this turn. But can we reach it?\n> \n> Head at (3,3), food at (1,5). Distance: Δx=2 left, Δy=2 up. But we can only move one step per turn. From (3,3), to (1,5), we need to move left twice and up twice, but in different sequence.\n> \n> But we cannot move up directly because head direction is down, and moving up would be reverse, not allowed. So from (3,3), possible moves are down, left, right.\n> \n> If we move left to (2,3), then from there, direction would be left (if we moved left), so we could move left again to (1,3), or up to (2,4), or down to (2,2).\n> \n> Then from (1,3), we could move up to (1,4), but (1,4) has food, but we need to get to (1,5).\n> \n> (1,5) is the target.\n> \n> From (1,3), to (1,4) up, then to (1,5) up again.\n> \n> But from (3,3), if we go left to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,4), then to (1,5). That's three moves: turn 28 to (2,3), turn 29 to (1,3), turn 30 to (1,4), turn 31 to (1,5). But (1,5) disappears after this turn (t=28), so we can't reach it by turn 30; it will be gone.\n> \n> Life span 1 at t=28, so only on turn 28 can we eat it. If we don't eat it on this turn, it's gone.\n> \n> But head is at (3,3), food at (1,5), which is not adjacent; it's two cells away. So impossible to eat it this turn, since we can only move one cell per turn. Therefore, (1,5) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after this turn. So we should ignore it, as it's not reachable.\n> \n> Now, other foods: (6,2), (3,1), (1,4).\n> \n> (1,4) is also at (1,4), which might be reachable.\n> \n> But let's think about the snake's position and possible paths.\n> \n> First, head at (3,3), direction down.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Down to (3,2)\n> \n> - Left to (2,3)\n> \n> - Right to (4,3)\n> \n> Now, we need to think ahead for survival and food collection.\n> \n> Also, note the tail: tail is at (5,6). When we eat food, we grow, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> But all food is positive, so eating increases length.\n> \n> Now, risks: body collisions or walls.\n> \n> Also, special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But in this case, the tail is at (5,6), and head is at (3,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,3) and (5,6) are not adjacent; distance is |dx|=2, |dy|=3, so not adjacent. So no issue now.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the grid with obstacles.\n> \n> List all blocked cells:\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for y=0 to7, (7,y) for y=0 to7, (x,0) for x=0 to7, (x,7) for x=0 to7. But since internal, the borders are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So blocked cells: all border cells plus these five.\n> \n> Now, free cells: need to find where snake can move.\n> \n> Snake body occupies: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> So those are occupied.\n> \n> Food at (1,5), but it will disappear, so not relevant.\n> \n> (6,2), (3,1), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) is a cell, is it occupied? Snake has (2,5), (2,6), etc., not (1,4). But (1,4) might be under body or free?\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,3) to (5,6), no (1,4), so it should be free unless obstacle.\n> \n> Obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,4) not listed, so free. Walls: x=1, y=4 is not border, since borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (1,4) is inside, free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): x=6,y=2, not border, obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), not (6,2), so free.\n> \n> (3,1): x=3,y=1, not border, obstacles: (5,1), (2,4), etc., not (3,1), so free.\n> \n> Now, back to moves from (3,3).\n> \n> Option 1: Move down to (3,2)\n> \n> Then head at (3,2), direction down.\n> \n> From there, can move down to (3,1), but (3,1) has food! Value 1, life span 7.\n> \n> Or left to (2,2), or right to (4,2), or up? But direction is down, so if we move down to (3,2), direction becomes down, so can move down, left, right, not up.\n> \n> (3,1) is food, and we can reach it in one move if we go to (3,2) first? From (3,3) down to (3,2) on turn 28, then from (3,2) down to (3,1) on turn 29.\n> \n> (3,1) has life span 7, so available until turn 34, so turn 29 is fine.\n> \n> But we need to think about risks.\n> \n> After moving to (3,2), the snake body: head moves to (3,2), tail is at (5,6), which will move to (4,6)? When we move, the tail moves forward unless we eat food.\n> \n> Currently, no food eaten, so when we move from (3,3) to (3,2), the tail at (5,6) will move to the next segment, which is (4,6)? Positions: indices: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), tail (5,6).\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so tail moves off the last cell.\n> \n> So after move down to (3,2): new positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). Tail was (5,6), now gone, and (4,6) is now the tail?

It's turn 30, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so grid from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n> \n> Walls:\n> - Border: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, meaning cells from x=1 to x=6 are playable, similarly y=1 to y=6. But let's list the coordinates: min x is 0, max x is 7, but walls occupy x=0 and x=7, so valid x: 1 to 6. Similarly for y: 1 to 6.\n> \n> Also internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,3), then body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). So the snake has 8 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is right (R), meaning the snake was moving right to get to (5,3) from (4,3).\n> \n> Food:\n> - (6,2) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> - (3,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> - (1,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.

But walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so snake can only be on cells with x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> - Head: (5,3)\n> - Body: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> So let's sketch the grid:\n> \n> y=6: ... (2,6) and (3,6) are snake body, (2,6) is the second last, (3,6) is last? Positions: index 0: head (5,3), 1: (4,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (2,6), 7: (3,6). So tail is (3,6).\n> \n> Now, current head position (5,3), moving right. So from (4,3) to (5,3), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,3): since head direction is R, I can move Up (U), Down (D), or Right (R), but not Left (L) because that would be reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move L. I can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> Now, check adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (5,4) – what is here? y+1 from (5,3) is (5,4)\n> \n> - Down: (5,2) – y-1\n> \n> - Right: (6,3) – x+1\n> \n> But need to check for walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, walls: borders are walls, so (5,4): x=5, y=4, x from 1-6, y from 1-6, so (5,4) is within bounds, y=4 <=6, >=1? y=1 to 6, so y=4 is fine. Similarly (5,2) y=2, (6,3) x=6.\n> \n> But internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> (6,4) is obstacle, (5,1) obstacle, etc.\n> \n> For (5,4): not in obstacle list? Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So (5,4) is free?

Similarly, (5,2): not in snake, not obstacle (obstacles include (5,1) but that's different), (6,3): not in snake, but is it obstacle? Obstacles: (6,4), (6,1), but (6,3) not listed.\n> \n> (6,3) is not in obstacles, so should be free.\n> \n> But (6,3) is at x=6, which is border? Walls: border cells x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is not border wall, it's playable.

Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 30, so food at (6,2) has life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 32? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Example: if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on turn t. If L=2, available at t and t+1, gone after t+1.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,2), life span 3 at turn 30. So:\n> \n> - Turn 30: available, countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 31: available, countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 32: available, countdown 1\n> \n> - After turn 32, gone, so last chance to eat is turn 32.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): life span 5 at turn 30, so available turns 30 to 34, gone after turn 34.\n> \n> (1,4): life span 8, available turns 30 to 37.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for at least 5 turns, but since food has life, I should consider which to go for.\n> \n> Also, Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, what is tail? Snake tail is (3,6). Adjacent cells to tail: up (3,7) but y=7 is wall, not playable; down (3,5) but (3,5) is part of snake body, not tail; left (2,6) is also body; right (4,6) but x=4,y=6.\n> \n> (3,6) adjacent: north (3,7) wall, south (3,5) which is snake body (segment 4), west (2,6) snake body (segment 6), east (4,6) – is this free? x=4,y=6.\n> \n> (4,6) not in snake positions, not in obstacles? Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (4,6) free? But is it within bounds? x=4, y=6, both in 1-6, so yes.\n> \n> But tail is at (3,6), and head is at (5,3), not adjacent. Head adjacent cells are (5,4), (5,2), (6,3), none of which are tail. So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about eating food. But must avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (6,2), which has short life, only 3 turns left, so I might want to eat it soon.\n> \n> (6,2) is at x=6,y=2.\n> \n> Current head at (5,3).\n> \n> To reach (6,2), I can go right to (6,3), then down to (6,2), but from (6,3) to (6,2) is down.\n> \n> But let's see possible paths.\n> \n> Also, (6,3) might be a move option.\n> \n> But (6,3) is adjacent to obstacle (6,4), but (6,4) is obstacle, so (6,3) is free but has wall or obstacle nearby.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is at x=6,y=2, which is corner? Borders, but x=6 is not wall, walls at x=0 and x=7.\n> \n> x=6 is playable, y=2 playable.\n> \n> Internal obstacle (6,1) is below, but (6,2) is fine.\n> \n> Now, life span: (6,2) must be eaten by turn 32 at latest.\n> \n> Turn 30 now.\n> \n> If I move right to (6,3) on turn 30, then from there, I can move down to (6,2) on turn 31.\n> \n> Then I can eat it on turn 31.\n> \n> Turn 30: move to (6,3), but (6,3) has no food, so not eating yet.\n> \n> Then turn 31: move down to (6,2), now head at (6,2), which has food, so I eat it, snake grows to length 9, new tail is where? When you eat, length increases, so the tail doesn't move that turn? Rule: when eating, length +1, so the head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so tail stays in place? Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, new segment added at head, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> But in terms of position, after eating, the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> But for movement, when head moves to food, it eats, and the body follows, but since tail doesn't move, the new position includes the head on food and body as is, but with growth.\n> \n> In this case, if I go to (6,2) on turn 31, I eat the food, so snake grows, positions: new head at (6,2), body: previous head (6,3) becomes first body, then (5,3), (4,3), etc., and tail (3,6) still there, but since I ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]? No: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> Standard: snake moves, head to new position, each segment moves to where the previous one was.\n> \n> When no eat: head new, body follows, tail moves away.\n> \n> When eat: head new, body follows, but tail stays, so new segment added at the end? After moving, if ate, add a segment at the tail position or something.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eat positive food.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats, so the snake grows, meaning that after the move, the tail does not move; it stays, so the new position list has the new head, then the previous head, then the rest, and the tail is the same as before for that turn.\n> \n> For example, before move: positions [A, B, C, ..., T] where A head, T tail.\n> \n> Move to new cell: if no food, new positions [new, A, B, ..., C] and T is removed? Positions: new head at new cell, then A becomes body, B becomes next, ..., up to the second last, and tail moves to where the second last was? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake has a list of segments. When it moves to a new cell without food, the head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed from that position.\n> \n> With food: head moves to new cell with food, eats, so the tail does not move; the new segment is added at the tail position? No, when you eat, the tail stays where it is, so the snake gains a segment.\n> \n> After move and eat: new head position, then the previous positions of all segments including tail remain, but tail doesn't advance, so the segment that was tail is still there, and a new segment is added at head? Standard: positions become [new_head, old_head, old_body1, ..., old_bodyN, old_tail] but that would be longer.\n> \n> Simpler: when snake moves without eating, positions: new head, then all but tail of previous positions.\n> \n> With eating: new head, then all previous positions including tail.\n> \n> So length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (6,2) on turn 31 and eat, new positions: head (6,2), then previous head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — so now 9 segments, tail is (3,6) still? No: previous positions were 8 segments: index 0 to 7: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> After move to (6,2) with eat: new head (6,2), then all previous: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — so tail is (3,6), same as before.\n> \n> Then next move, tail will move.\n> \n> But for now, back to planning.\n> \n> So to eat (6,2) soon, I can go right to (6,3) on turn 30, then down to (6,2) on turn 31 to eat.\n> \n> But is (6,3) safe to move to?\n> \n> (6,3): not wall, not obstacle, not occupied by snake.\n> \n> But after moving, what about the body? When I move to (6,3), since no food, snake moves: head to (6,3), body to (5,3), (4,3), etc., tail (3,6) moves to (2,6)? Let's see positions after turn 30 move.\n> \n> Current positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n> \n> If I move right to (6,3), no food there, so new positions: head (6,3), then previous head (5,3) becomes body, (4,3) becomes body, ..., up to (2,6) becomes body, and tail (3,6) is removed? Positions: new head (6,3), then segments: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — and (3,6) is gone, so tail is now (2,6).\n> \n> Length 8 to 8, no growth.\n> \n> Then turn 31, move down to (6,2), which has food, so eat: new head (6,2), then all previous positions: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — so now 9 segments, tail (2,6).\n> \n> And food eaten.\n> \n> Now, is there any risk? (6,2) is at the edge, x=6, which is close to wall but not wall. y=2, below is (6,1) which is obstacle, so I can only move left, up, or down, but down is (6,1) obstacle, so from (6,2), possible moves: left to (5,2), up to (6,3), or right, but x=7 is wall, so cannot right.

After head moves to (5,3), segment 1 will move to the old head position (6,3), so (5,3) is now the head, and the body segment is no longer there? No.\n> \n> At the moment the head moves to (5,3), the cell (5,3) was occupied by segment 1, so when head moves in, it collides with the body segment that is still there. Then, after collision check, if no collision, segments move.\n> \n> The rule says: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" for eating, but for collision, it should be similar.\n> \n> I think the standard way is: before moving, check if the new head position is a wall or a body segment (except if it's the tail and tail will move).\n> \n> Specifically: if new head position is the tail position, and no food is eaten there, then tail moves away, so it's safe.\n> \n> But if it's a body segment that is not tail, it doesn't move away, so collision.\n> \n> In this case, (5,3) is segment 1, not tail, so moving to (5,3) should cause collision.\n> \n> Moreover, the head direction is R, and moving left would be opposite direction, but the rule says \"no instant reverse\", meaning I cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. But current direction is R, so I cannot move L directly? No.\n> \n> \"**No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> The current direction is the direction the snake is facing now, before moving. So if current direction is R, I cannot move L for the next turn.

Segments: new head (5,2), then (6,2) becomes segment 1, (6,3) segment 2, (5,3) segment 3, etc., and tail (2,6) is removed since no food eaten.\n> \n> After moving to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) — and (2,6) is gone. Length decreased? No, since no food eaten, tail is removed, so length same as before eating, but we ate on turn 31, so after growth, length was 9, now after moving without eating, length should be 8? Let's track.\n> \n> Before turn 31: snake length 8 positions.\n> \n> Turn 31: move to (6,2) with food, eat, so grow: head to (6,2), add new segment, so positions: 9 cells.\n> \n> Turn 32: move to (5,2), no food, so head to (5,2), and tail (2,6) is removed, so positions: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) — 9 positions? Head (5,2), then body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5). That's 9 segments? (2,5) is the last body, but tail should be (2,5) now.\n> \n> Original after eat: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n> \n> After move to (5,2): head to (5,2), then the body: segment 1 (6,2) moves to where?

Cannot move here (collision).\n2. **Down (D)**: (6, 1) \n   - Occupied by an internal wall (6, 1). Cannot move here.\n3. **Left (L)**: (5, 2) \n   - Not occupied by snake or walls. Free to move.\n4. **Right (R)**: (7, 2) \n   - Border wall (x=7). Cannot move here.\n\n### Additional Constraints:\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Current direction is D, so cannot move U (opposite direction).\n- **Valid Moves**: Only L to (5, 2) is possible without immediate death.\n\n### Verification:\n- Moving L to (5, 2) is safe:\n  - (5, 2) is not occupied by the snake or any obstacle.\n  - No walls or borders block this move.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only possible move at Turn 32 is **Left (L)** to (5, 2). This avoids collisions and keeps the snake alive. \n\n### Next Steps (for context):\nAfter moving to (5, 2), the snake's head will be at (5, 2), and the body will shift accordingly. The next moves can then be planned to target the food at (3, 1), which is urgent (must be eaten by Turn 34).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",

Head direction is down, which is decreasing y, since down is (x,y-1). In standard coordinates, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement says D is (x,y-1), so let's assume y increases upwards. But in grid terms, often y=0 is top, but here walls are at y=0 and y=7, so I need to be consistent.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) – so y increases up, D (x,y-1) – y decreases down. So if y=0 is the bottom wall, then U moves up to higher y, D moves down to lower y. But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is likely the bottom, y=7 top, so U to higher y, D to lower y.\n> \n> Snake head at (6,2), direction D, so it just moved down to (6,2), meaning it was at (6,3) before? Let's see the positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), so if head is at (6,2) and next segment at (6,3), which has higher y, so if y increases up, (6,3) is above (6,2), so moving down from (6,3) to (6,2) makes sense with direction D.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,4) with life span 6, value 1\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 9, value 1\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive, no negative food mentioned.

So it can be eaten on turn 32, 33, or 34.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) life span 6, disappears after turn 37.\n> \n> (2,2) life span 9, disappears after turn 40.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since food has different life spans, I should think about which ones to target.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but with obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n> \n> So let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - Snake: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n> \n> - Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> Walls at borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,2), direction D (down, so y decreasing).

Moving there would cause collision, since it's a body segment.\n> \n> - D: (6,1) – but (6,1) is an obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - L: (5,2) – let's check if free. What is at (5,2)? Not in snake positions, not in obstacles. Snake: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), etc. (5,2) not listed. Obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2) – so (5,2) is not an obstacle. And not wall border, since x=5 between 1-6, y=2 between 1-6. So (5,2) should be free.\n> \n> - R: (7,2) – but x=7 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves: only L to (5,2)?

When snake moves, the head goes to new position, and tail shifts, so last segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten at (5,2), the snake length remains the same, tail moves away.\n> \n> Current snake positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n> \n> If head moves to (5,2), new head at (5,2), then the body segments follow: the old head (6,2) becomes part of body, so new positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), but (6,3) was second, now third, and so on, up to (2,5), and tail (2,6) is removed since no food eaten.\n> \n> Let's list new positions:\n> \n> - New head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Then previous head (6,2) becomes first body segment\n> \n> - Then (6,3) second body\n> \n> - (5,3) third\n> \n> - (4,3) fourth\n> \n> - (3,3) fifth\n> \n> - (3,4) sixth\n> \n> - (3,5) seventh\n> \n> - (2,5) eighth, and tail was (2,6), but since no growth, tail moves to the position of the second last? Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So positions shift: new head at (5,2), then body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) — and (2,6) is gone. So snake now has 8 segments? Original 9 segments, head moves, tail removed, so 8 segments.\n> \n> Original: 9 positions. After move: head new position, and 8 body segments from the previous positions except tail removed.\n> \n> Previous positions: index 0: head (6,2), 1: (6,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,6) tail.\n> \n> After move to (5,2):\n> \n> - New head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Body: position 0 becomes segment 1: (6,2)\n> \n> - Position 1 becomes segment 2: (6,3)\n> \n> - Position 2 becomes segment 3: (5,3)\n> \n> - Position 3 becomes segment 4: (4,3)\n> \n> - Position 4 becomes segment 5: (3,3)\n> \n> - Position 5 becomes segment 6: (3,4)\n> \n> - Position 6 becomes segment 7: (3,5)\n> \n> - Position 7 becomes segment 8: (2,5) — and position 8 (2,6) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake positions: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]? That's 9 positions, but we removed tail, so should be 8.\n> \n> I think I confused. When snake moves without eating, the head moves to new cell, and each subsequent segment moves to the cell of the previous segment. So the first body segment moves to where head was, second body to where first body was, and so on, so the last segment (tail) is vacated.\n> \n> So in this case:\n> \n> - Head moves to (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment that was at (6,2) (old head) is now the neck, but it moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> The positions: the new head is at (5,2). The segment that was at index 1, (6,3), moves to the position of index 0, which was (6,2). Similarly, segment at index 2, (5,3), moves to position of index 1, which was (6,3), and so on.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Body segment 1: moves to old head position (6,2)\n> \n> - Body segment 2: moves to old body segment 1 position (6,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 3: moves to old body segment 2 position (5,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 4: moves to old body segment 3 position (4,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 5: moves to old body segment 4 position (3,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 6: moves to old body segment 5 position (3,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 7: moves to old body segment 6 position (3,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 8: moves to old body segment 7 position (2,5)\n> \n> And old tail at (2,6) is removed; no one moves there.\n> \n> So new positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)\n> \n> (2,5) is now the tail, which was previously at (2,5) but it was segment 7, now it's the last.\n> \n> List of positions: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> Yes, 9 segments? Original had 9, we didn't eat, so length should be same, but we removed the tail, so it should be 8 segments.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Original positions: 9 cells. When snake moves, head to new cell, and the tail cell is abandoned. So the new snake occupies 8 cells if no growth, but the segments shift.\n> \n> Number of segments remains the same unless food eaten.\n> \n> Original snake has 9 segments. After moving without eating, it still has 9 segments, but the positions change: the head is at new position, and each body segment is at the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> So from above: new head at (5,2), then the segment that was at position 0 (head) is now at (6,2), but it's body now.

These are walls that I can't move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (6,2), then body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is down, which is decreasing y, since down is (x,y-1). In standard coordinates, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement says D is (x,y-1), so let's assume y increases upwards. But in grid terms, often y=0 is top, but here walls are at y=0 and y=7, so I need to be consistent.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) – so y increases up, D (x,y-1) – y decreases down. So if y=0 is the bottom wall, then U moves up to higher y, D moves down to lower y. But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is likely the bottom, y=7 top, so U to higher y, D to lower y.\n> \n> Snake head at (6,2), direction D, so it just moved down to (6,2), meaning it was at (6,3) before? Let's see the positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), so if head is at (6,2) and next segment at (6,3), which has higher y, so if y increases up, (6,3) is above (6,2), so moving down from (6,3) to (6,2) makes sense with direction D.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,4) with life span 6, value 1\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 9, value 1\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive, no negative food mentioned.

Countdown decreases every turn, so on turn 32, life span 3, meaning it has 3 turns left including turn 32. After turn 32, it has 2 turns left, after turn 33, 1 turn, after turn 34 it disappears.

When snake moves, the head goes to new position, and tail shifts, so last segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten at (5,2), the snake length remains the same, tail moves away.\n> \n> Current snake positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n> \n> If head moves to (5,2), new head at (5,2), then the body segments follow: the old head (6,2) becomes part of body, so new positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), but (6,3) was second, now third, and so on, up to (2,5), and tail (2,6) is removed since no food eaten.\n> \n> Let's list new positions:\n> \n> - New head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Then previous head (6,2) becomes first body segment\n> \n> - Then (6,3) second body\n> \n> - (5,3) third\n> \n> - (4,3) fourth\n> \n> - (3,3) fifth\n> \n> - (3,4) sixth\n> \n> - (3,5) seventh\n> \n> - (2,5) eighth, and tail was (2,6), but since no growth, tail moves to the position of the second last? Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So positions shift: new head at (5,2), then body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) — and (2,6) is gone. So snake now has 8 segments? Original 9 segments, head moves, tail removed, so 8 segments.\n> \n> Original: 9 positions. After move: head new position, and 8 body segments from the previous positions except tail removed.\n> \n> Previous positions: index 0: head (6,2), 1: (6,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,6) tail.\n> \n> After move to (5,2):\n> \n> - New head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Body: position 0 becomes segment 1: (6,2)\n> \n> - Position 1 becomes segment 2: (6,3)\n> \n> - Position 2 becomes segment 3: (5,3)\n> \n> - Position 3 becomes segment 4: (4,3)\n> \n> - Position 4 becomes segment 5: (3,3)\n> \n> - Position 5 becomes segment 6: (3,4)\n> \n> - Position 6 becomes segment 7: (3,5)\n> \n> - Position 7 becomes segment 8: (2,5) — and position 8 (2,6) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake positions: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]? That's 9 positions, but we removed tail, so should be 8.\n> \n> I think I confused. When snake moves without eating, the head moves to new cell, and each subsequent segment moves to the cell of the previous segment. So the first body segment moves to where head was, second body to where first body was, and so on, so the last segment (tail) is vacated.\n> \n> So in this case:\n> \n> - Head moves to (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment that was at (6,2) (old head) is now the neck, but it moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> The positions: the new head is at (5,2). The segment that was at index 1, (6,3), moves to the position of index 0, which was (6,2). Similarly, segment at index 2, (5,3), moves to position of index 1, which was (6,3), and so on.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Body segment 1: moves to old head position (6,2)\n> \n> - Body segment 2: moves to old body segment 1 position (6,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 3: moves to old body segment 2 position (5,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 4: moves to old body segment 3 position (4,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 5: moves to old body segment 4 position (3,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 6: moves to old body segment 5 position (3,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 7: moves to old body segment 6 position (3,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 8: moves to old body segment 7 position (2,5)\n> \n> And old tail at (2,6) is removed; no one moves there.\n> \n> So new positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)\n> \n> (2,5) is now the tail, which was previously at (2,5) but it was segment 7, now it's the last.\n> \n> List of positions: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n> \n> Yes, 9 segments? Original had 9, we didn't eat, so length should be same, but we removed the tail, so it should be 8 segments.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Original positions: 9 cells. When snake moves, head to new cell, and the tail cell is abandoned. So the new snake occupies 8 cells if no growth, but the segments shift.\n> \n> Number of segments remains the same unless food eaten.\n> \n> Original snake has 9 segments.

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell occupied by a body segment other than the tail causes collision. Only if it's the tail, and tail moves away, it's ok.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,3), which is currently occupied by index 5, not the tail. Tail is (3,5). So (4,3) is a body segment, not tail, so moving there would cause collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (3,2): what is at (3,2)? Not in snake positions: positions are (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So (3,2) is not occupied, free.\n> \n> (4,1): not occupied, free.\n> \n> (3,2) is free? x=3,y=2, not in positions, yes.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,1), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3)\n> \n> (3,1) is close, but life span 1, must eat now or never.\n> \n> But (3,1) is at x=3,y=1.\n> \n> From head (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (4,3): but (4,3) is body segment, collision, invalid.\n> \n> - D to (4,1): free cell, no wall, no body.\n> \n> - L to (3,2): free cell.\n> \n> So only two valid moves: D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (4,1), that's one step towards (3,1), since (3,1) is at (3,1), which is left and down from (4,2)? From (4,2) to (3,1) is not adjacent; (3,1) is down-left, but moves are only orthogonal, not diagonal.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: (4,2) to (3,2) left, or (4,1) down, or (4,3) up, or (5,2) right but invalid.\n> \n> (3,1) is at (3,1), which is adjacent to (3,2) or (4,1), etc.\n> \n> So if I move to (4,1), I can then move to (3,1) next turn if I go left, but (3,1) has life span 1, only available this turn, turn 34.\n> \n> If I move to (4,1) now, I can eat (3,1) only if I move to (3,1) on turn 35, but turn 35 is too late, because (3,1) disappears after turn 34.\n> \n> On turn 34, I need to eat it now.\n> \n> But from (4,2), I can't move directly to (3,1) because not adjacent orthogonally; (3,1) is not a direct neighbor of (4,2).

But I'm at (4,2), not adjacent to (3,1). So I can't eat it this turn; it's impossible to eat (3,1) because I can't reach it in one move.\n> \n> (4,2) to (3,1) is not a valid move; it's diagonal, not allowed. Only U,D,L,R.\n> \n> So (3,1) cannot be eaten this turn, and since life span 1, it will disappear after this turn.

And the tail was (3,5), which moves to where segment 7 was, (3,4).\n> \n> Positions after move: head: (3,2)\n> \n> Then: (4,2) from old head\n> \n> (5,2) from index 1\n> \n> (6,2) from index 2\n> \n> (6,3) from index 3\n> \n> (5,3) from index 4\n> \n> (4,3) from index 5\n> \n> (3,3) from index 6\n> \n> (3,4) from index 7\n> \n> And tail: (3,4) but index 8 was (3,5), moved to where index 7 was, which is (3,4), but (3,4) is now occupied by segment 7? Let's clarify.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to the new cell. Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So:\n> \n> - New position 0: head at (3,2)\n> \n> - Position 1: old position 0: (4,2)\n> \n> - Position 2: old position 1: (5,2)\n> \n> - Position 3: old position 2: (6,2)\n> \n> - Position 4: old position 3: (6,3)\n> \n> - Position 5: old position 4: (5,3)\n> \n> - Position 6: old position 5: (4,3)\n> \n> - Position 7: old position 6: (3,3)\n> \n> - Position 8: old position 7: (3,4)\n> \n> Old position 7 was (3,4), and position 8 was (3,5), but when moving, position 8 (tail) moves to where position 7 was, which is (3,4). But position 7 is now at (3,3), so position 8 moves to (3,4).\n> \n> And the old tail cell (3,5) is vacated.\n> \n> So new snake: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n> \n> Tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Now, if I move to (4,1) down from (4,2).\n> \n> Then new head at (4,1)\n> \n> Body: (4,2) from old head, then (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) moved to (3,4)\n> \n> New positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n> \n> Tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available: (2,2) at (2,2) with life span 7, so can be eaten until turn 34+6=40? Life span 7 on turn 34: available turns 34 to 34+6=40, disappear after turn 40.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) life span 10, available turns 34 to 43.\n> \n> (1,4) life span 4, available turns 34 to 37.\n> \n> Also, (3,1) is gone after this turn.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2).

Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so after moving to food, the tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when head moves to a food cell, it consumes the food, and the body doesn't move the tail, so the new tail is the old tail, not moved.\n> \n> Otherwise, if no food, tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,2) on turn 35, and (2,2) has food, I eat it, so head at (2,2), and the body segments move, but tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> After eating, positions: head (2,2), then body: the previous positions except tail stays.\n> \n> But let's not get into details yet.\n> \n> First, is it safe to go to (2,2) from (3,2)?\n> \n> From (3,2), move L to (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is free?

It's turn 34. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls. Internal obstacles are at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), and (1,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,2), then body segments: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).

Borders are lines, like x=0 or x=7, so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are specific cells: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So (4,1): x=4, y=1, not border (y=1 not 0 or 7, x=4 not 0 or 7), and not in internal obstacles list, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2): x=3, y=2, not border, not in obstacles.\n> \n> (4,3): x=4,y=3, not border, not obstacle.\n> \n> Now, body segments: snake positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> If I move to (4,3), is that occupied? (4,3) is part of the body, it's the 6th segment?

If I move to (4,3), head would be at (4,3), but that cell is currently occupied by index 5. After move, the body moves, so tail moves away, but when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body, it might cause collision, except for the tail.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell occupied by a body segment other than the tail causes collision. Only if it's the tail, and tail moves away, it's ok.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,3), which is currently occupied by index 5, not the tail. Tail is (3,5). So (4,3) is a body segment, not tail, so moving there would cause collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (3,2): what is at (3,2)? Not in snake positions: positions are (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).

It's turn 36, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so I can only move within x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, meaning those cells are blocked, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> The walls are: Border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. That means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the grid is 8x8, but cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), and (0,7) to (7,7) are walls. Playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]. So these cells are blocked too.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). So the snake has 10 segments. Head at (2,2), tail at (3,4). The positions are listed from head to tail: index 0 is head (2,2), index 1 is (3,2), index 2 (4,2), index 3 (5,2), index 4 (6,2), index 5 (6,3), index 6 (5,3), index 7 (4,3), index 8 (3,3), index 9 (3,4). So tail is (3,4).\n> \n> Head direction is L, which means left. So the snake was moving left to reach (2,2) from previous position. Since head is at (2,2) and direction is L, that means it came from the right, so previous head was at (3,2) or something? Let's see the positions: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the body follows. But direction is given as current head direction, which is L, so from (2,2), moving left would go to (1,2), but (1,2) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (1,2), so (1,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Food: there are two food items.\n> \n> - (1,4) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,3) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1 each.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,4), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 36, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 38? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at the start of turn t, if a food has life span L, it will be there for this turn, and after L turns, it disappears. After countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, if life span is N at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+N.\n> \n> Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life span N, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> So for (1,4): life span 3 at turn 36. So:\n> \n> - Turn 36: life span 3, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 37: life span 2, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 38: life span 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 39: life span 0, disappears, not available.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3): life span 8 at turn 36, so it will last until turn 43 (since 36+8-1=43, disappears at turn 44).\n> \n> Turn 36: life span 8, eaten in turn 36 to 43, disappears at turn 44.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,2), direction L (left).\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, to (2,3)), D (down, to (2,1)), L (left, to (1,2)), R (right, to (3,2)).\n> \n> But we have constraints:\n> \n> - Cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R (right). So cannot move right to (3,2) because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Also, collisions:\n> \n> - Wall collision: moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 or internal obstacles.\n> \n> - Body collision, but with tail exception: can move to tail position only if tail moves away.\n> \n> First, check possible moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - U: to (2,3). Is this safe?\n> \n> (2,3) is a food position? Food is at (2,3), but let's see if it's occupied or not.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n> \n> So (2,3) is not in the snake body? List all occupied cells: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). So (2,3) is free? y=3, x=2: not in the list, so it's empty except for food.\n> \n> (2,3) has food, but we need to check if moving there causes collision.\n> \n> Moving to (2,3): is it a wall? Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7. (2,3) is within 1-6, so not border. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is an obstacle, but (2,3) is not listed, so no obstacle.\n> \n> Body collision: (2,3) is not in the snake body positions, so moving there is safe for now. But when we move, the snake grows only if we eat food.\n> \n> Similarly, D: down to (2,1). (2,1): is it wall or obstacle? Borders: x=2,y=1, not border. Internal obstacles: (5,1) is obstacle, but (2,1) not listed, so should be free. Snake body? Not in positions, so safe.\n> \n> L: left to (1,2). But (1,2) is an internal obstacle! Internal obstacles include (1,2), so (1,2) is blocked, cannot move there.\n> \n> R: right to (3,2). But (3,2) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: (3,2) is the second segment. But we cannot move there because it's a body segment, and it's not the tail? Tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail segment and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (3,2) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,4). So (3,2) is a body segment, moving to it would cause collision and death.\n> \n> Moreover, even if it were tail, but in this case, it's not.\n> \n> Also, we cannot move right because it's opposite to current direction L. Current direction is L, so moving R is instant reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - U: to (2,3) - possible, and has food? (2,3) is a food position.\n> \n> - D: to (2,1) - possible, no food?\n> \n> - L: to (1,2) - but (1,2) is obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> - R: to (3,2) - but (3,2) is body segment and not tail, so collision, and also instant reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible moves are U or D.\n> \n> Now, U to (2,3): (2,3) has positive food with value 1, life span 8. If we move there, we eat it, snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> D to (2,1): no food there, so no growth, just move.\n> \n> But we need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is another food at (1,4) with life span 3, so it will disappear soon.\n> \n> Current turn 36, food at (1,4) life span 3: can be eaten turn 36,37,38.\n> \n> Food at (2,3) life span 8: can be eaten turn 36 to 43.\n> \n> Now, if we move U to (2,3) this turn, we eat it immediately.\n> \n> But let's see what happens after that.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving U to (2,3) on turn 36.\n> \n> Turn 36: move U to (2,3), eat food. Snake grows: new head at (2,3), and body: the previous head (2,2) becomes second segment, and tail stays, but since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so snake length becomes 11.\n> \n> Snake positions after move: when head moves to new cell, if no food, tail moves forward, so length same. If food, tail stays, so new head position, and all body segments shift, with tail not moving.\n> \n> Original positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving U to (2,3) and eating food: new head at (2,3), then previous head (2,2) becomes segment 1, then (3,2) segment 2, (4,2) segment 3, (5,2) segment 4, (6,2) segment 5, (6,3) segment 6, (5,3) segment 7, (4,3) segment 8, (3,3) segment 9, and tail (3,4) doesn't move, so it becomes segment 10? Since we ate, the tail doesn't advance, so the last segment stays.\n> \n> Positions: new head (2,3), then body: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), and (3,4) still there as new tail? Since we ate, the snake grows, so the tail remains, and a new segment is added at head, effectively the tail stays put.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to food, and the tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions: head at (2,3), then the first body segment is the previous head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), and tail (3,4) remains.\n> \n> So snake positions: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)] with head at (2,3).\n> \n> Now, head direction: we moved U, so new head direction is U.\n> \n> Now, food: (1,4) is still there, life span decreases to 2 at turn 37? Turn 36 we ate (2,3), so that food is gone. (1,4) still there, life span was 3 at turn 36, after turn 36, at turn 37, life span 2.\n> \n> Now, from (2,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> Current direction U, so cannot move D (down), instant reverse.\n> \n> Possible: U to (2,4), D not allowed, L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, check cells:\n> \n> (2,4): is it wall or obstacle? Borders: not. Internal obstacles: (2,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacles include (2,4), so blocked. Cannot move there.\n> \n> (1,3): is it wall? x=1,y=3, not border (borders x=0,7,y=0,7). Internal obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed, so should be free. Snake body: after move, positions include (2,2), (3,2), etc., (1,3) not occupied, so should be safe.\n> \n> (3,3): is it snake body? After positions, (3,3) is segment 10? Positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). So (3,3) is the second last segment, and (3,4) is tail. Moving to (3,3) would be moving to a body segment that is not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Moreover, (3,3) is occupied by body, not tail, so deadly.\n> \n> So from (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,4) but obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> - D: down to (2,2), but (2,2) is now a body segment (second segment), and not tail, so collision. Also, current direction U, moving D is instant reverse, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> - L: to (1,3) - possible, no food? Food at (1,4), not (1,3).\n> \n> - R: to (3,3) - body segment, collision.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (1,3).\n> \n> So if we go to (2,3) on turn 36, then on turn 37 we must move L to (1,3).\n> \n> Now, turn 37: move L to (1,3). No food there, so snake moves, tail moves. Head to (1,3), then body: previous head (2,3) becomes segment 1, (2,2) segment 2, etc., and tail (3,4) moves? Since no food eaten, tail moves forward.\n> \n> After turn 36: positions [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n> \n> After moving to (1,3) without eating: head to (1,3), then body shifts: segment 1 to (2,3), segment 2 to (2,2), ..., segment 10 to (3,3), and tail (3,4) is removed? Since no growth, the last cell is vacated.\n> \n> Positions: new head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). Tail was (3,4), but since tail moves, (3,4) is no longer part of snake, and (3,3) becomes the new tail? Let's index.\n> \n> After turn 36: positions: 0: (2,3) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (5,2), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (3,3), 10: (3,4) tail.\n> \n> Move to (1,3): head to (1,3), then body: segment 1 is previous head (2,3), segment 2 is previous segment 1 (2,2), segment 3 previous segment 2 (3,2), and so on, up to segment 10 previous segment 9 (3,3), and the tail previous segment 10 (3,4) is not included, so positions: head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). So tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Now, head at (1,3), direction L (since we moved left).\n> \n> Food: (1,4) is at (1,4), life span now 2 at turn 37? Turn 36 life span 3, turn 37 it decreases to 2, so still available.\n> \n> (1,4) is adjacent to head (1,3), up one cell.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,3): U, D, L, R.\n> \n> Current direction L, so cannot move R (right) instant reverse.\n> \n> Possible: U to (1,4), D to (1,2), L to (0,3) but x=0 is wall, blocked.\n> \n> R to (2,3), but (2,3) is now a body segment (second segment), and not tail? Positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), etc. (2,3) is segment 1, which is body, not tail. Tail is at (3,3). So moving to (2,3) would be collision.\n> \n> D to (1,2): but (1,2) is internal obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> U to (1,4): has food, and (1,4) is not occupied by snake?

Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (1,3) and (3,3) are not adjacent; (1,3) to (1,4) U, (1,2) D, (0,3) L, (2,3) R. (3,3) is at distance, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Move U to (1,4) turn 37.\n> \n> Then snake grows: head to (1,4), body: previous head (1,3) becomes segment 1, then (2,3), (2,2), etc., and tail (3,3) remains, so new positions: head (1,4), then (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) tail?

It's turn 37. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). Snake positions: head at (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). That's 11 segments. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food: two items. (1,4) with life span 2 and value 1 (positive), and (1,3) with life span 10 and value 1 (also positive). Both are positive food, so eating either gives +1 score and increases length by one. But I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,4), life span 2 means it disappears after 2 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 37, life span is 2, so it will be gone by turn 39. Similarly, (1,3) has life span 10, so it lasts longer.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,3) moving up. Possible moves: since head direction is U, I can go U (up), L (left), or R (right), but not D (down) because that would be instant reverse. From (2,3), moving:\n> \n> - U to (2,4)\n> \n> - L to (1,3)\n> \n> - R to (3,3)\n> \n> But I have to check for collisions and walls.\n> \n> First, walls: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,3) is within bounds, no wall there. Internal obstacles: (1,2) is an obstacle, but (1,3) is not listed, so it should be free. Similarly, (2,4) and (3,3) need checking.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). (2,4) is an obstacle! So I cannot move to (2,4) because there's a wall there. (2,4) is listed, so it's blocked.\n> \n> Also, (3,3) is part of the snake body? Snake positions: (2,3) head, then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). So (3,3) is the second to last segment, and (3,4) is the tail. (3,3) is occupied by the snake body, so moving to (3,3) would cause a body collision because it's not the tail; the tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> The rule is: head touches any body segment except the tail. But when moving, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok. But in this case, if I move to (3,3), that cell is currently occupied by a body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Let's list all occupied cells by snake: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). So (3,3) is occupied, and it's not the tail; tail is (3,4). So if head moves to (3,3), it would collide with the body at (3,3) before the tail moves.\n> \n> After moving, the tail moves forward, so the cell (3,3) will be vacated only if the snake moves in a way that the tail leaves it. But at the moment of movement, the head is moving to a cell, and if that cell is occupied by any body part except the tail, it collides. Only if it's the tail cell and the tail moves away, it might be ok, but there's a special case.\n> \n> From the rules: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" and for body, \"head touches any body segment\" but with the exception for tail when it moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if the head moves to the current tail position, it should be safe because the tail moves away, and a new segment is added at the head.\n> \n> But in this case, the tail is at (3,4), so moving to (3,4) would be safe only if it's not a collision.\n> \n> For (3,3), it's not the tail; it's a body segment, so moving there should cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, for possible moves from (2,3):\n> \n> - U to (2,4): but (2,4) is a wall (internal obstacle), so cannot move there.\n> \n> - D: but head direction is U, moving down is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> - L to (1,3): (1,3) has food, and it's not occupied by body? Let's see if (1,3) is occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,3) is not in the list. Food is at (1,3), so it should be free, but there might be food under snake? Food can spawn under body, but only eaten when head moves there after body moves away.\n> \n> Currently, (1,3) has food, and it's not occupied by snake? Snake positions are all listed, (1,3) not there, so it should be accessible.\n> \n> - R to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by snake body, specifically the 10th segment (index 9 or something), not the tail, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,4) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: reverse, invalid.\n> \n> - L: (1,3) is free? Coordinates: from (2,3) left to (1,3). x decreases. (1,3) is within bounds? x=1, y=3. Borders x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is ok, y=3 ok.

No: when you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and a new segment is added at the head position after moving.\n> \n> Standard snake: head moves to new cell, if food, tail doesn't move, so length increases; if no food, tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (1,3) has food, so head moves to (1,3), new segment added there, so the snake positions become: head at (1,3), then previous head (2,3) becomes second segment, and so on, up to tail (3,4) still there, but since new segment added, the tail doesn't move, so positions: new head (1,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), ..., up to (3,4) and now an additional segment, so tail is still (3,4), but since length increased, the segment before tail is now part of body.\n> \n> After eating, the snake has one more segment; tail position remains until next move without eating.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, after moving to (1,3) and eating:\n> \n> - New head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Then: (2,3)  // previous head\n> \n> - Then: (2,2)\n> \n> - (3,2)\n> \n> - (4,2)\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (6,2)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> - (5,3)\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (3,3)  // this was the 10th segment\n> \n> - (3,4)  // tail, still there\n> \n> But since we added a segment, the tail doesn't move, so (3,4) remains, and (3,3) is now the 11th segment or something.

Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision because the body is there.\n> \n> U to (1,4): (1,4) has food, and let's see if it's occupied.\n> \n> Currently, after turn 37, snake occupies: (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). (1,4) is not occupied, and has food.\n> \n> So from (1,3), moving up to (1,4) should be possible.\n> \n> But head direction is L, so moving U is perpendicular, allowed.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (1,4) on turn 38, I eat that food too, since life span 2, on turn 37 it was life span 2, so after turn 37, life span decreases to 1, then on turn 38, if I move there, it should be eaten before disappearing? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so on turn 37, for (1,4), life span was 2, so after turn 37, it becomes 1, still present. On turn 38, if not eaten, after turn it becomes 0 and disappears. So on turn 38, it can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> But there's a danger: tail reward danger.\n> \n> If I eat at (1,4), and the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail has food, but here the food is at head position, not tail.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, when I eat at (1,4), the food is at head position, not tail.

I need to avoid these as well as the walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (1,3), and the body segments follow: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). So the snake is 12 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is L, meaning left. So the snake is moving left, and from the positions, head at (1,3), next segment (2,3), which is to the right, so yes, moving left means decreasing x.\n> \n> Food: Only one food item given: (1,4) with value 1 and life span 1. Life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten, because life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Food life span: It says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span 1, on turn t, it will disappear after turn t, meaning if not eaten on turn t, it's gone.\n> \n> In this case, turn 38, food at (1,4) with life span 1.

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail is safe because the tail moves away when you move forward.\n> \n> In this case, from (1,3), moving to (2,3): (2,3) is the second segment, not the tail. Snake positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n> \n> So the tail is (3,4), which is the last one.\n> \n> (2,3) is the second position, so it's part of the body, not the tail.

Let's see positions.\n> \n> After move, if head moves to new cell, the body shifts: new position 0: (x,y) head, position 1: old position 0, position 2: old position 1, ..., position k: old position k-1 for k from 1 to 11, and tail position 11: old position 10.\n> \n> Old position 11 (tail) is left empty.\n> \n> So, for collision: if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any of the old positions except the tail position, it's a collision because that segment will still be there or move there? No.\n> \n> At the moment of move, before shifting, if the new head position is the same as any body segment position except the tail position, it's a collision only if it's not the tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, during the move, if head moves to a cell that has a body segment, it collides unless that cell is the current tail position, because after the move, the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,3), it is occupied by segment 1, which is not the tail. If I move head to (2,3), that cell has segment 1, so head would be moving into a body segment that is not the tail, so collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (1,2): is (1,2) occupied? Snake positions: (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), etc. (1,2) is not in the list, so it should be free, but let's check obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles include (1,2), oh! (1,2) is an internal obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)]\n> \n> Yes, (1,2) is an obstacle, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, (1,4) is the food position, which is not occupied by snake or obstacle, I think.\n> \n> Food positions: (1,4) with value 1.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (1,3):\n> \n> - Up: to (1,4) – this has food, and it's not a wall or obstacle.\n> \n> - Down: to (1,2) – but (1,2) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Left: to (0,3) – x=0 is border wall, cannot move.\n> \n> - Right: to (2,3) – but (2,3) is occupied by snake body segment (index 1), not tail, so collision if I move there.\n> \n> Therefore, the only possible move is Up to (1,4).\n> \n> But (1,4) has food, positive food with value 1.\n> \n> Now, if I move up to (1,4), I eat the food, so my length increases by 1, and I get +1 score.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,4). Head is at (1,3), moving to (1,4).\n> \n> Is head adjacent to tail? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (1,4) and (3,4): x differs by 2, y same, so not adjacent; they are two cells apart.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: (1,4) is adjacent to (1,3), (1,5), (2,4), (0,4) but (0,4) wall.\n> \n> (3,4) is adjacent to (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4).\n> \n> So (1,4) and (3,4) are not adjacent; they are separated by (2,4).\n> \n> (2,4) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), yes! (2,4) is an obstacle, so the cells are not connected directly, but in terms of adjacency for the danger rule, it's about the positions.\n> \n> The rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\"\n> \n> Here, head is at (1,3), tail at (3,4). Are they adjacent? Distance: |dx|=2, |dy|=1, so not adjacent; min distance is 2 cells.\n> \n> For example, (1,3) and (3,4) are not sharing an edge; they are diagonal or separate.\n> \n> Adjacent means north, south, east, west, so (1,3) adjacent to (1,4), (1,2), (0,3), (2,3). None of which is (3,4).\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) adjacent to (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4). (2,4) is obstacle, but position-wise, (1,3) not adjacent to (3,4).\n> \n> So no, head is not adjacent to tail. Therefore, no tail reward danger.\n> \n> Moreover, after eating, the snake grows, so new tail will be added, but since I'm moving to (1,4), which is food, after eating, the head is at (1,4), and the tail doesn't move? No.\n> \n> When you eat food, the tail doesn't move; instead, a new segment is added at the tail, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays, and the snake length increases by one.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: before move, positions: head (1,3), then body, tail (3,4)\n> \n> After moving head to (1,4) and eating food, since it's positive food, length increases, so new positions: head at (1,4), then the previous head (1,3) becomes segment 1, then (2,3) segment 2, ..., up to tail (3,4) becomes the second last, and a new tail is added at (3,4)? No.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail is removed. If food eaten, tail is not removed; a new segment is added.\n> \n> Sequence: head moves to new position. If that cell has food, then the snake grows, so the tail does not move; instead, the body segments all shift, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically in snake: when head moves to a cell:\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed, and the new tail is the one that was second last.\n> \n> - If food is eaten, head moves to new cell (which has food), food is consumed, and the tail does not move; that is, the last segment stays, so the snake grows by one, with the new segment at the old tail position.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, after the move, the head is at new position, and body positions are updated.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (1,4), which has food, then after move:\n> \n> - New head: (1,4)\n> \n> - Then the previous positions: segment 1: old head (1,3), segment 2: old segment 1 (2,3), segment 3: old segment 2 (2,2), ..., segment 11: old segment 10 (3,3), and since food eaten, we add a new segment at old tail position (3,4), so segment 12: (3,4)\n> \n> Old tail was (3,4), and since food eaten, it stays, and new tail is (3,4), but the position was (3,4), so it remains.\n> \n> Positions: old segments: indices 0 to 11.\n> \n> After move with food eaten: new head at food cell, then new segment 1 at old position 0, new segment 2 at old position 1, ..., new segment 11 at old position 10, and new segment 12 at old position 11 (which was tail).\n> \n> So the tail position is still (3,4), but now it's segment 12, and segment 11 is at (3,3) or something.\n> \n> From above: new segment k at old position k-1 for k=1 to 12, with new head at (1,4).\n> \n> So new position 0: (1,4)\n> \n> Position 1: old pos 0 = (1,3)\n> \n> Position 2: old pos 1 = (2,3)\n> \n> Position 3: old pos 2 = (2,2)\n> \n> Position 4: old pos 3 = (3,2)\n> \n> Position 5: old pos 4 = (4,2)\n> \n> Position 6: old pos 5 = (5,2)\n> \n> Position 7: old pos 6 = (6,2)\n> \n> Position 8: old pos 7 = (6,3)\n> \n> Position 9: old pos 8 = (5,3)\n> \n> Position 10: old pos 9 = (4,3)\n> \n> Position 11: old pos 10 = (3,3)\n> \n> Position 12: old pos 11 = (3,4)  // new tail\n> \n> And since food eaten, length increased.\n> \n> Now, in this case, no collision because (1,4) was free, and we moved there.\n> \n> But back to the immediate move: on turn 38, I must move, and the only possible move is Up to (1,4) to eat the food, since other directions are invalid: down to obstacle, left to wall, right to body collision.\n> \n> So I have to move Up to (1,4).\n> \n> Now, the food has life span 1, so if I don't eat it now, it disappears, and I might be stuck, but since I can move up, I should eat it.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> After this move, head is at (1,4), and direction is now Up, since I moved up.\n> \n> Current direction was L, but after moving up, new head direction is U.\n> \n> Now, what about future moves?\n> \n> First, let's confirm the state after turn 38.\n> \n> Turn 38: move to (1,4), eat food, snake grows to length 13.\n> \n> New positions: head (1,4), then (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) as above.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Now, food: only one was at (1,4), which is eaten, so no food left?

Valid.\n- **Down (D)**: (1, 4) \n  - Check: (1, 4) is occupied by the snake (body segment). Also, moving down is the reverse of the current direction (U), which is not allowed. Invalid.\n- **Left (L)**: (0, 5) \n  - Check: (0, 5) is a wall (x=0). Invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: (2, 5) \n  - Check: (2, 5) is not a wall or obstacle, and not occupied by the snake. Valid.\n\n### Valid Moves:\n- Up (U) to (1, 6)\n- Right (R) to (2, 5)\n\n### Food Consideration:\nThe food is at (4, 3), which is currently under the snake's body (segment (4, 3)). To eat it:\n1. The snake must move such that the body moves away from (4, 3), making it free.\n2. Then, the head must move onto (4, 3).\n\nFrom the previous thinking model, moving Right at Turn 40 is more efficient to eventually reach the food. Here's the reasoning:\n- Moving Right at Turn 40 to (2, 5) allows the snake to progress toward the food's column (x=4) while also moving the body away from (4, 3) over subsequent turns.\n- Moving Up at Turn 40 to (1, 6) would take longer to reach the food and might not be as efficient.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nAt Turn 40, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (2, 5). This sets up the snake to eventually reach the food at (4, 3) in the fewest turns while avoiding collisions.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 40, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells go from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but since x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, the snake can only be on cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6. Internal obstacles are given: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these are also walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). So the snake has 13 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to get to (1,5) from previous position. Since head is at (1,5) and direction is U, that means it came from (1,4) below it? Positions are given with head first: [(1,5), (1,4), ...] so the head is at (1,5), and the segment behind it is (1,4), so since it's moving Up, from (1,4) to (1,5), so direction U means it moved up to the current position.\n> \n> Now, food: only one food item: (4,3) with value 1 and life span 10. But (4,3) is also a position in the snake body. Snake positions include (4,3), which is the 12th segment or so? Let's list snake positions with indices:\n> \n> 0: (1,5) head\n> \n> 1: (1,4)\n> \n> 2: (1,3)\n> \n> 3: (2,3)\n> \n> 4: (2,2)\n> \n> 5: (3,2)\n> \n> 6: (4,2)\n> \n> 7: (5,2)\n> \n> 8: (6,2)\n> \n> 9: (6,3)\n> \n> 10: (5,3)\n> \n> 11: (4,3)  <-- here is the food position\n> \n> 12: (3,3)\n> \n> And food is at (4,3) with value 1 and life span 10. But (4,3) is occupied by the snake body, segment 11 in this list (index 11).\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, the head is at (1,5), and the food is at (4,3), which is under the body.\n> \n> Life span is 10, meaning it will disappear after 10 turns, including the current turn. So from turn 40, it has 10 turns to be eaten, or it disappears at turn 50? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 40, life_span=10, after turn 40, it becomes 9, then 8, and so on, until 0, then it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 40 to 49, and disappears at turn 50 if not eaten.\n> \n> But since it's under the body, we need the body to move away so that the cell is free, then head can move to it.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls on borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, except internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> (6,1) and (5,1) are both obstacles? (5,1) is given, and (6,1) is also given.\n> \n> List obstacles:\n> \n> - Border walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n> \n> - Internal: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So cells to avoid: walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Snake body is also occupied, so cannot move there except the tail which will move.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,5), direction U. Since it moved up to (1,5), from (1,4), so current direction is U, meaning it can't move down instantly because of no instant reverse. So possible moves from (1,5): Up, Left, Right. But not Down.\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells to head (1,5):\n> \n> - Up: (1,6) - y=6, which is within 1-6? y=6 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, but let's check if obstacle or body.\n> \n> (1,6): x=1,y=6, no internal obstacle listed, and not border wall, so should be free, but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), etc., no (1,6), so (1,6) is free.\n> \n> - Down: (1,4) - but this is the snake body segment, so if I move down, head would go to (1,4), which is occupied by body, so collision. Also, instant reverse is not allowed since current direction is U, so Down is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> - Left: (0,5) - x=0 is wall, so cannot move left.\n> \n> - Right: (2,5) - x=2,y=5, no wall, no obstacle listed, not in snake positions? Snake has (1,5), (1,4), etc., no (2,5), so should be free.\n> \n> (2,5) is not in snake positions or obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). No (2,5), so free.\n> \n> Also, (1,6) is free.\n> \n> Now, what about (0,5) wall, (1,4) body.\n> \n> So from (1,5), possible moves: Up to (1,6), or Right to (2,5). Cannot Down or Left.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food at (4,3). It's currently under the body at position (4,3) which is segment 11. When the snake moves, the tail will move, but since the snake moves one step, the tail segment at (3,3) will move to the next position, depending on the movement.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So the tail end will be cut off if no food eaten, or if food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> But in this case, since food is at (4,3), which is part of the body, we need the body to move away so that (4,3) becomes free.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 40, snake is on (4,3). When the snake moves, if no food is eaten, the tail will move away from (3,3), but (4,3) will still be occupied until the segment moves.\n> \n> Let's think about the body segments.\n> \n> The segment at (4,3) is position 11. When head moves, say to (1,6) or (2,5), then the new head position, and each body segment shifts: segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on, down to segment 12 (tail) moving to where segment 11 was.\n> \n> Positions: let's index from 0 to 12.\n> \n> After one move, if head moves to new position, say P, then:\n> \n> - New head: P\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head position (1,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old segment 1 position (1,4)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Segment 11: old segment 10 position (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 12: old segment 11 position (4,3)\n> \n> - But segment 12 is the tail, so it moves to (4,3), which was where the food is, but since the tail is moving to it, the cell (4,3) is now occupied by the tail, but the food is there? No, the food is on the cell, but when the snake moves, if the tail moves to a food cell, it might eat it or not, but according to rules, food can only be eaten when head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically, for food under body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> So when the tail moves away from a cell, that cell becomes free, and if food is there, it can be eaten later if head moves to it.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 40, (4,3) has food and is occupied by body segment.\n> \n> When the snake moves at turn 40, the tail segment (3,3) will move to the next position.

It's turn 42. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So the snake has 13 segments. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the right to reach (3,5).\n> \n> Food: only one piece at (4,3) with value 1 and life span 8. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 42, it has 8 turns left? Let me read: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 42, life_span is 8, meaning it will disappear after 8 more turns? No.\n> \n> The description says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life_span N, it will disappear at turn t + N. For example, if N=8 at turn 42, it will be gone after turn 49 (since it decreases each turn, including 42, so after 8 decreases, at turn 50 it might be gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If at turn t, life_span is N, then after turn t, it decreases to N-1. After turn t+1, to N-2, and so on, until after turn t+N-1, it becomes 0, and then it disappears. So it is present from turn t to turn t+N-1 inclusive, and gone at turn t+N.\n> \n> In this case, turn t=42, life_span=8, so it will be present from turn 42 to turn 49 (42 to 49 is 8 turns: 42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49), and disappear at turn 50.\n> \n> But we're at turn 42, so we have until turn 49 to eat it.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (3,5), moving right, so from (3,5), possible moves: up, down, left, right. But since head direction is R, and we have the no instant reverse rule, we cannot move left (opposite of right) on the next turn. So possible moves from (3,5) are U, D, R. L is not allowed because it would be reverse.\n> \n> Head direction is the direction the head is facing, which was the direction it moved to get to current position. So from (3,5), it came from left, so it was moving right to get to (3,5). Therefore, next move cannot be left, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> So available moves: U (up to (3,6)), D (down to (3,4)), R (right to (4,5)).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> The food is at (4,3), which is one cell down and one right from head? Head at (3,5), food at (4,3), so relative position: delta x = +1, delta y = -2, so it's down-right, but not adjacent; it's two cells away vertically and one horizontally.\n> \n> (3,5) to (4,3): x increases by 1, y decreases by 2, so it's not adjacent; adjacent cells would be same x or same y with difference 1.\n> \n> From (3,5), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (3,6)\n> \n> - Down: (3,4)\n> \n> - Right: (4,5)\n> \n> - Left: (2,5) but left is occupied by body? Snake positions: head (3,5), then (2,5) is the next segment, so (2,5) is the neck, so moving left to (2,5) would cause collision because the body is there, but (2,5) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> So cells occupied:\n> \n> - (3,5) head\n> \n> - (2,5) body\n> \n> - (1,5) body\n> \n> - (1,4) body\n> \n> - (1,3) body\n> \n> - (2,3) body\n> \n> - (2,2) body\n> \n> - (3,2) body\n> \n> - (4,2) body\n> \n> - (5,2) body\n> \n> - (6,2) body\n> \n> - (6,3) body\n> \n> - (5,3) body\n> \n> Also, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game:\n\n- **Grid Size**: 7x7 (playable area from (1,1) to (6,6)), with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n- **Snake Positions**: Head at (4,5), moving right (R), followed by body segments ending with tail at (6,3). Total length = 13.\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,3): value = +1, life_span = 7\n  - (6,3): value = +1, life_span = 10\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (4,5), Direction R\n\nFrom the current head position (4,5) moving right, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,6)\n   - Check: (4,6) is within bounds, not a wall, not occupied by snake or obstacle.\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,4)\n   - Check: (4,4) is within bounds, not a wall, not occupied by snake or obstacle.\n3. **Right (R)**: (5,5)\n   - Check: (5,5) is within bounds, not a wall, not occupied by snake or obstacle.\n4. **Left (L)**: (3,5)\n   - Invalid: Opposite of current direction (R), and (3,5) is occupied by the snake's body.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (4,6)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves towards the top, away from immediate dangers.\n  - Keeps options open for future moves.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Moves away from both food items.\n  - May lead to being cornered later with limited space to maneuver.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (4,4)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves closer to the food at (4,3).\n  - Can potentially eat (4,3) on the next move.\n- **Cons**:\n  - After eating, the snake grows, which may limit future movements.\n  - Risk of getting trapped if not careful with subsequent moves.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5,5)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves towards the center, providing more space to maneuver.\n  - Can set up a path to reach either food item later.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Doesn't immediately approach any food, delaying potential score increase.\n\n### Considering Food Consumption\n\n- **Food at (4,3)**:\n  - Life span: 7 turns (from turn 43 to 49).\n  - Can be eaten directly if the head moves onto it after the body moves away (but currently not under body).\n- **Food at (6,3)**:\n  - Life span: 10 turns (from turn 43 to 52).\n  - Currently under the tail. To eat, the tail must move away first, then the head can move onto it.\n\n### Potential Sequences\n\n#### Sequence 1: Move D to (4,4), then D to (4,3) to eat\n- Turn 43: D to (4,4)\n- Turn 44: D to (4,3) to eat (4,3)\n  - Snake grows to length 14.\n  - Next moves from (4,3) could be L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n- Risks:\n  - After eating, limited movement options from (4,3).\n  - May lead to being trapped if not careful.\n\n#### Sequence 2: Move R to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then D to (5,3), then R to (6,3) to eat\n- Turn 43: R to (5,5)\n- Turn 44: D to (5,4)\n- Turn 45: D to (5,3)\n- Turn 46: R to (6,3) to eat (6,3)\n- Risks:\n  - After eating (6,3), the only move is D to (6,2), then possibly stuck as (5,2) is occupied.\n\n#### Sequence 3: Move U to (4,6), then L to (3,6), then D to (3,5) (but (3,5) is body)\n- This sequence seems less optimal as it moves away from food and may not lead to scoring.\n\n### Optimal Immediate Move\n\nGiven the risks associated with immediately moving towards food and the potential to get trapped, the safest immediate move is to **move Right (R) to (5,5)**. This move:\n\n- Keeps the snake in a more central position with more options for future moves.\n- Avoids immediate risks of getting trapped after eating.\n- Allows for a more flexible path to approach either food item in subsequent turns.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating the options, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (5,5).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 43, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), inclusive. But there are internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked and cannot be moved into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,5), and it's moving right (direction R). The body segments are: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). That's 13 segments, so the snake length is 13.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 7\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,3), it disappears after 7 turns, including the current turn, so it will be gone by turn 43 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify life span. \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for a food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's present from turn T to T+L-1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The state says \"Current Turn: t1=43\", and food has life span, say for (4,3), life span 7. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn 43, life span is 7, so it decreases to 6 on turn 44, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears after that. \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means after N turns from now, it will be gone. For example, if life span is N, it disappears at the end of turn t1 + N - 1 or something? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: if at turn t, life span is L, then after L turns, it disappears. So it is present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L. But since the countdown decreases every turn, at turn t, life span is L, meaning it has L turns left including current, so it will be gone after turn t+L-1. I think it's easier to think that at the beginning of each turn, we check the food; if life span is 1, it can be eaten this turn, then it disappears. After being eaten or when life span reaches 0, it's gone.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". So for food with life span N at turn t, at turn t, countdown is N, decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, ..., to 0 at turn t+N, and when countdown is 0, it disappears before the next turn or something. But for eating, as long as it's present, it can be eaten.\n> \n> I think for simplicity, I can consider that food is available until its life span expires. For (4,3), life span 7 at turn 43, so it will be available until turn 43 + 7 - 1 = 49? Let's not overcomplicate; I can just use the life span value to know how many turns it has left.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,3), life span 10, so it has 10 turns left including turn 43.\n> \n> But in terms of planning, I need to think about when it might disappear.\n> \n> Now, my goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So blocked cells:\n> \n> - (6,4)\n> \n> - (5,1)\n> \n> - (2,4)\n> \n> - (6,1)\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> Also, borders are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are out of bounds.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them to see where the body is.\n> \n> Head: (4,5) direction R (right, so increasing x)\n> \n> Body: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)\n> \n> Tail is (6,3)\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3) and (6,3)\n> \n> (6,3) is the tail position? Snake positions include (6,3), which is the tail, and food is also at (6,3). That means food is under the tail.\n> \n> According to the rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, food at (6,3) is under the tail. The head is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to (6,3). Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> Distance: from (4,5) to (6,3), that's |4-6| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4, not adjacent. Adjacent cells would be (4,5) to (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5) but (5,5) is not occupied, etc.\n> \n> (4,5) adjacent: (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5)\n> \n> (6,3) is not adjacent to (4,5). So it's fine for now.\n> \n> But if I move the head to (6,3), I need the tail to move away first so that the cell is free when head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 43, tail is at (6,3), and food is there, so to eat it, the tail must move away, and then head move to (6,3).\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,3), there might be body or not.\n> \n> Let's see what cells are occupied by snake.\n> \n> Snake: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)\n> \n> So cells occupied: all these points.\n> \n> Food at (4,3): is (4,3) occupied? Looking at the list, (4,3) is not in the snake positions. Snake has (4,5), (4,2), but not (4,3). Similarly, (4,4) not occupied, etc.\n> \n> (4,3) is free? Let's list all snake positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: (4,5) head\n> \n> 1: (3,5)\n> \n> 2: (2,5)\n> \n> 3: (1,5)\n> \n> 4: (1,4)\n> \n> 5: (1,3)\n> \n> 6: (2,3)\n> \n> 7: (2,2)\n> \n> 8: (3,2)\n> \n> 9: (4,2)\n> \n> 10: (5,2)\n> \n> 11: (6,2)\n> \n> 12: (6,3) tail\n> \n> So (4,3) is not in this list, so it should be free to move to, unless there's an obstacle, but obstacles are (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2), so (4,3) is clear.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is occupied by tail, but has food.\n> \n> Now, current head direction is R, so at (4,5) moving right. Possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L (left) because that would be opposite and no instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is R, so opposite is L (left), so I cannot move L on this turn.

Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within 1 to 6, so it's playable. But is it occupied?

If life span N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so at turn t+N it's gone. But countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> At turn 43, life span 7, so after 7 turns, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 43 to turn 49? Let's define.\n> \n> Suppose at turn T, food has life span L. It can be eaten on any turn from T to T+L-1, and at turn T+L, it is gone before the turn starts.\n> \n> Similarly here, turn 43, L=7, so can be eaten turns 43 to 49, gone at turn 50.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,3) L=10, can be eaten turns 43 to 52, gone at turn 53.\n> \n> But (6,3) is currently occupied by tail, so I can only eat it if tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, the snake will move, so tail will move when the snake advances.\n> \n> To eat the food under tail, I need to move the head to that cell after the tail has moved.\n> \n> Currently tail at (6,3). When the snake moves, if I don't eat food, the tail moves away, so after one move, tail is no longer at (6,3), and if no food eaten, the cell is empty, but food is there, so it should still be there unless life span expires.\n> \n> The food is on the cell, and when the snake moves, if head doesn't eat it, and body moves, if the body was on it, it moves away, food remains until eaten or expired.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (6,3), it is under tail now. When the snake moves, tail will move to the next position, so the cell (6,3) will be free, and food is still there (since not eaten), so then it can be eaten by moving head to it.\n> \n> Similarly, for any body segment, if food is under, when that segment moves, the food is exposed.\n> \n> But in this case, (6,3) is tail, so when snake moves without eating, tail moves away, exposing the food.\n> \n> Now, let's see the snake movement.\n> \n> Current head at (4,5), direction R.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for several turns.\n> \n> But the answer format requires an action sequence starting from turn 43, but I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Perhaps I should simulate possible paths.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid rows y=1 to 6, bottom to top?

        "thinking": "Based on the current state at Turn \\( t_0 = 44 \\), the snake's head is at (5,5) moving right (direction R). The guidance from the previous thinking model suggests a sequence starting from Turn 43, but we are now at Turn 44. The planned action for Turn 44 was R (to (5,6)), but the snake's current position is (5,5), so we need to adjust the action based on the current state.\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n- **Snake Positions**: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)]\n- **Head Direction**: R (right)\n- **Possible Moves**: \n  - U (up to (5,6)): Valid, no wall or body collision.\n  - D (down to (5,4)): Valid, no wall or body collision.\n  - R (right to (6,5)): Valid, no wall or body collision.\n  - L (left to (4,5)): Invalid (opposite direction and body collision).\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- (4,3): Life span 6 (will disappear after Turn 49), value +1.\n- (6,3): Life span 9 (will disappear after Turn 52), value +1.\n- (6,3) is currently under the tail at (6,2), so it can only be eaten if the tail moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\n### Action Decision:\nThe previous plan aimed to move to open space at the top-right (e.g., (5,6)) to avoid immediate risks. Following this plan, the next action should be **U (up to (5,6))**, as it aligns with the long-term strategy of moving to safer areas and deferring food consumption.\n\n### Immediate Action:\n\\boxed{U}",

It's turn 43, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), inclusive. But there are internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). So these cells are blocked and cannot be moved into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,5), and it's moving right (direction R). The body segments are: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3). That's 13 segments, so the snake length is 13.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 7\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,3), it disappears after 7 turns, including the current turn, so it will be gone by turn 43 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify life span. \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for a food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's present from turn T to T+L-1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The state says \"Current Turn: t1=43\", and food has life span, say for (4,3), life span 7. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn 43, life span is 7, so it decreases to 6 on turn 44, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears after that. \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means after N turns from now, it will be gone. For example, if life span is N, it disappears at the end of turn t1 + N - 1 or something? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: if at turn t, life span is L, then after L turns, it disappears. So it is present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L. But since the countdown decreases every turn, at turn t, life span is L, meaning it has L turns left including current, so it will be gone after turn t+L-1. I think it's easier to think that at the beginning of each turn, we check the food; if life span is 1, it can be eaten this turn, then it disappears. After being eaten or when life span reaches 0, it's gone.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". So for food with life span N at turn t, at turn t, countdown is N, decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, ..., to 0 at turn t+N, and when countdown is 0, it disappears before the next turn or something. But for eating, as long as it's present, it can be eaten.\n> \n> I think for simplicity, I can consider that food is available until its life span expires. For (4,3), life span 7 at turn 43, so it will be available until turn 43 + 7 - 1 = 49? Let's not overcomplicate; I can just use the life span value to know how many turns it has left.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,3), life span 10, so it has 10 turns left including turn 43.\n> \n> But in terms of planning, I need to think about when it might disappear.\n> \n> Now, my goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2)\n> \n> So blocked cells:\n> \n> - (6,4)\n> \n> - (5,1)\n> \n> - (2,4)\n> \n> - (6,1)\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> Also, borders are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are out of bounds.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them to see where the body is.\n> \n> Head: (4,5) direction R (right, so increasing x)\n> \n> Body: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)\n> \n> Tail is (6,3)\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3) and (6,3)\n> \n> (6,3) is the tail position?

The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, food at (6,3) is under the tail. The head is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to (6,3). Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> Distance: from (4,5) to (6,3), that's |4-6| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4, not adjacent.

It's turn 45. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7).

So the snake is 13 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (5,6) from (5,5) since it was moving up.\n> \n> Food: two pieces. First is at (4,3) with value 1 and life span 5. Second at (6,3) with value 1 and life span 8. Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead. The action sequence should be for turns starting from t=45 to at least t=50 or more, but I should think ahead and then list the sequence for immediate turns.\n> \n> Since I'm thinking 5+ turns ahead, I need to simulate possible moves and their consequences.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid mentally. I'll sketch a grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls.

Border walls are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,6) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (6,4), (5,1), (2,4), (6,1), (1,2). None at (4,6). Snake body: positions are all below y=6 except head. Head is (5,6), body is at y=5,4,3,2. (5,5), (4,5), etc., all y<=6. (4,6) is not occupied by any body segment. So (4,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6): not a wall, not an obstacle, not in snake body. Obstacles are (6,4), (6,1), but (6,6) is different. Snake body has (5,2), (4,2), etc., no (6,6). So (6,6) is free.\n> \n> Both Left and Right seem possible for the next move.\n> \n> But I need to think about food and long-term survival.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) and (6,3). Both have positive value, life span 5 and 8 respectively.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn? The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 45, food at (4,3) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, so if not eaten by turn 50, it's gone. Similarly, (6,3) with life span 8, disappears after turn 53.\n> \n> I need to plan to eat them if possible, but avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, where is the tail? Snake positions: last one is (5,2), that's the tail.\n> \n> Head is at (5,6), tail at (5,2). Not adjacent; they are far apart.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (5,6) and (5,2) are 4 apart in y, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, for turn 45, I can move Left to (4,6) or Right to (6,6).\n> \n> I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the snake grows only if it eats food; otherwise, it moves forward, tail moves, so length stays same.\n> \n> If no food eaten, snake moves, head to new position, tail removed.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, no food at (4,6) or (6,6), so if I move there, no growth.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the food positions.\n> \n> (4,3) is below and left of head.

Let's see: snake has (1,3), (2,3), but not (4,3). (4,3) is free, except for the food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is free.\n> \n> But to reach (4,3), I need to go to y=3, x=4.\n> \n> Currently at (5,6), so I need to decrease y by 3 and x by 1.\n> \n> But moving down might be restricted if direction was up, but after turn 45, direction changes.\n> \n> After I move, the head direction updates.\n> \n> For example, if I move left to (4,6), then head direction becomes L.\n> \n> Then from there, I can move left, down, or right?

The last segment (5,2) is gone.\n> \n> Length is now 12? Original 13 segments, after move without eating, length same, but since tail removed, positions from 0 to 11 for 12 cells? Head and 11 body segments, total 12.\n> \n> Original: 13 positions, head + 12 body segments? No: positions list has head and all body segments, so for length L, there are L positions.\n> \n> Start: head (5,6), and 12 body segments, total 13 cells.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new cell, say (4,6), then the body: the segment that was at index 1 moves to where head was, but in terms of list, we remove the tail and add new head.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving to a new cell without food, the head moves to the new cell, and the tail is removed from the list. So the new list has the same length, but shifted.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (4,6), then the first body segment is the old head (5,6), then the rest: (5,5), (4,5), ..., up to (4,2), but the last one (5,2) is removed.\n> \n> Old positions: [0]:(5,6) head, [1]:(5,5), [2]:(4,5), [3]:(3,5), [4]:(2,5), [5]:(1,5), [6]:(1,4), [7]:(1,3), [8]:(2,3), [9]:(2,2), [10]:(3,2), [11]:(4,2), [12]:(5,2) tail.\n> \n> After move to (4,6): new head at (4,6). Then the body segments: the old [0] becomes the new [1] at (5,6), old [1] becomes new [2] at (5,5), old [2] becomes new [3] at (4,5), and so on, up to old [11] becomes new [12] at (4,2), and old [12] (tail) is removed. So new positions: [0]:(4,6) head, [1]:(5,6), [2]:(5,5), [3]:(4,5), [4]:(3,5), [5]:(2,5), [6]:(1,5), [7]:(1,4), [8]:(1,3), [9]:(2,3), [10]:(2,2), [11]:(3,2), [12]:(4,2). So 13 segments? No: from [0] to [12] is 13 positions, but we removed the tail, so it should be 12 positions.\n> \n> I think I confused the indexing.\n> \n> Typically, the positions list has L elements for a snake of length L.\n> \n> When moving without eating: head moves to new cell, that becomes new head. The tail cell is vacated, so the new list is: new head, then the old head, then old body except the last one.\n> \n> For example, old: positions [0,1,2,...,L-1] with 0=head, L-1=tail.\n> \n> New: after move to new cell, new head at new cell, then old [0], old [1], ..., old [L-2]. So new positions: new head, old [0], old [1], ..., old [L-2]. So length is still L, but the tail is now old [L-2], and old [L-1] is removed.\n> \n> In this case, L=13, old positions: 0:(5,6), 1:(5,5), 2:(4,5), 3:(3,5), 4:(2,5), 5:(1,5), 6:(1,4), 7:(1,3), 8:(2,3), 9:(2,2), 10:(3,2), 11:(4,2), 12:(5,2)\n> \n> After move to (4,6): new head at (4,6), then old 0 at (5,6), old 1 at (5,5), old 2 at (4,5), old 3 at (3,5), old 4 at (2,5), old 5 at (1,5), old 6 at (1,4), old 7 at (1,3), old 8 at (2,3), old 9 at (2,2), old 10 at (3,2), old 11 at (4,2). Old 12 is removed. So new positions: (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). That's 13 positions? From 0 to 12, but we have 13 cells, but tail was removed, so it should be 12.\n> \n> List: new [0]: (4,6) head, new [1]: (5,6) which was old head, new [2]: (5,5) old [1], new [3]: (4,5) old [2], new [4]: (3,5) old [3], new [5]: (2,5) old [4], new [6]: (1,5) old [5], new [7]: (1,4) old [6], new [8]: (1,3) old [7], new [9]: (2,3) old [8], new [10]: (2,2) old [9], new [11]: (3,2) old [10], new [12]: (4,2) old [11]. But old [11] was (4,2), and old [12] was (5,2) removed. So new positions have 13 elements, but the last one is new [12] = (4,2), and the tail is at (4,2). Length is still 13? No, the snake didn't eat, so length should be the same, 13. But we removed one cell and added one, so length same. Yes, it's correct. New tail is at (4,2).\n> \n> Similarly, for right move.\n> \n> But for planning, I don't need the full list, just the head and potential collisions.\n> \n> Back to turn 45 choices.\n> \n> Option 1: Move Left to (4,6)\n> \n> Then at (4,6), direction L.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: since direction L, cannot move Right (reverse).

Standard snake movement.\n> \n> After move L to (3,6):\n> \n> - New head: (3,6)\n> \n> - Then the previous head (4,6) becomes segment 1\n> \n> - Then segment 1 was (5,6) becomes segment 2\n> \n> - Segment 2 was (5,5) becomes segment 3\n> \n> - Segment 3 was (4,5) becomes segment 4\n> \n> - And so on, down to segment 12 was (4,2), but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so new tail is the previous segment 11 or what?\n> \n> Positions: after move, head to (3,6), then the body segments: the first body segment is the old head (4,6), then old segment 1: (5,6), then old segment 2: (5,5), old segment 3: (4,5), old segment 4: (3,5), old segment 5: (2,5), old segment 6: (1,5), old segment 7: (1,4), old segment 8: (1,3), old segment 9: (2,3), old segment 10: (2,2), old segment 11: (3,2), and old segment 12: (4,2) is removed since no grow.\n> \n> So new snake positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)]\n> \n> Length 13, same as before.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,6), direction was L, but after move, new direction is L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead for action sequence.\n> \n> Current turn t1=46, I need to output action sequence for turn 46, 47, 48, etc., but how many turns? It says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but the sequence might not be fixed, but I need to provide a sequence for some turns.\n> \n> Answer format: Action sequence for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many. Probably for a few turns, say 5 or so.\n> \n> But I need to prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, from turn 46, only possible move is L to (3,6), as we saw.\n> \n> So for turn 46, action must be L.\n> \n> Then at turn 47, head at (3,6), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Now possible moves: from (3,6), can move U, D, L, but not R (reverse).\n> \n> U: (3,7) - y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (3,5) - but (3,5) is in the body? New positions: after move, snake has (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), ... so (3,5) is segment 5 or something. Positions: head (3,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (3,5), yes (3,5) is segment 5, body, not tail. Tail is (3,2).\n> \n> So moving D to (3,5) would collide with body.\n> \n> L: to (2,6) - let's see if free.\n> \n> (2,6): not in snake positions, not wall (y=6<7), not obstacle: obstacles are (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2) - no (2,6), so free.\n> \n> R: to (4,6) but (4,6) is now segment 1, body, so moving R would collide, and also reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So from (3,6), possible moves: L to (2,6) or D to (3,5) but D to (3,5) is body, collision, so only possible is L to (2,6).\n> \n> Similarly, U invalid.\n> \n> So turn 47 must be L to (2,6).\n> \n> Then at turn 48, head at (2,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: from (2,6)\n> \n> U: (2,7) wall, invalid\n> \n> D: (2,5) - (2,5) is in snake? Positions: after previous, head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), ... so (2,5) is segment 7 or something? Let's list positions after turn 47.\n> \n> After turn 46: moved to (3,6), snake: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)]\n> \n> After turn 47: move L to (2,6), so head to (2,6), then body: old head (3,6) becomes seg1, then (4,6) seg2, (5,6) seg3, (5,5) seg4, (4,5) seg5, (3,5) seg6, (2,5) seg7, (1,5) seg8, (1,4) seg9, (1,3) seg10, (2,3) seg11, (2,2) seg12, and tail (3,2) removed?

Positions: head (2,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (4,6), seg3 (5,6), seg4 (5,5), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (3,5), seg7 (2,5), so (2,5) is segment 7, body, not tail. Moving there causes collision.\n> \n> L: to (1,6) - is it free? (1,6): x=1,y=6. Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 is playable. Not obstacle: obstacles (6,4),(5,1),(2,4),(6,1),(1,2) - (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,6) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> R: to (3,6) but (3,6) is segment 1, body, collision, and reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (1,6).\n> \n> Then turn 49, head at (1,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> U: (1,7) wall, invalid\n> \n> D: (1,5) - (1,5) is segment 8?

(1,6) is free.\n> \n> - Right: (x+1,y) = (3,6) — (3,6) is body segment, and also reverse direction not allowed.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is Left to (1,6).\n> \n> But let me confirm the grid.\n> \n> y=7 is top, y=0 bottom? Usually in grids, y increases up, but in this notation, it might be different. The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, so y=7 is top row, y=0 bottom.\n> \n> Similarly, x increases right.\n> \n> So (2,6): up to (2,7) y=7 wall; down to (2,5) body at (2,5); left to (1,6) free; right to (3,6) body and reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So only move is L to (1,6).\n> \n> But the snake head direction is L, so moving L is fine.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (1,6), what happens?\n> \n> Turn 48: move L to (1,6)\n> \n> Now, the snake moves: head to (1,6), and the tail moves? When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since we didn't eat food, length remains same, so tail moves away from (2,2).\n> \n> After move, new positions: head at (1,6), then the previous head (2,6) becomes body, so positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3)] and tail was (2,2) is removed? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (2,6) head, 1: (3,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (5,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (3,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (1,5), 9: (1,4), 10: (1,3), 11: (2,3), 12: (2,2) tail.\n> \n> After moving left to (1,6): new head at (1,6), then body segments: the first body segment is the old head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), and the tail (2,2) is removed, so it's not part of snake anymore. The new tail is what was index 11, (2,3)? After move, positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) ] so tail is at (2,3) now? Index 0: new head (1,6), 1: old head (2,6), 2: (3,6), ..., up to 12: (2,3), which was previously index 11. Previously there were 13 segments, after move without eating, still 13 segments, but the positions shift.\n> \n> Original: 13 positions. After move: new head at (1,6), then the first 12 positions of the old body become positions 1 to 12 of the new snake. So old positions 0 to 12: when head moves, new position 0: new head cell, position 1: old position 0, position 2: old position 1, ..., position 12: old position 11. Old position 12 is removed.\n> \n> So here: new snake: [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) ] and (2,2) is removed, free now.\n> \n> Tail is now (2,3).\n> \n> Direction: head was moving left to (1,6), so new direction is L.\n> \n> Now, turn 49.\n> \n> But I need to plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, at turn 48, only possible move is L, so I must move left to (1,6).\n> \n> Then for turn 49, head at (1,6), direction L.\n> \n> Now possible moves.\n> \n> First, life span of food: food at (4,3) had life span 2 at turn 48. After turn 48, it decreases, so at turn 49, life span is 1. It can be eaten on turn 49 or disappear after turn 49.\n> \n> Similarly, others.\n> \n> But now, from (1,6), possible moves.\n> \n> Direction left, so cannot move right (reverse).\n> \n> Possible: U, D, L.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) = (1,7) — y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (x,y-1) = (1,5) — (1,5) is in snake body? New positions: (1,6) head, (2,6), (3,6), ..., (1,5) is position 9? Index: 0:(1,6), 1:(2,6), 2:(3,6), 3:(4,6), 4:(5,6), 5:(5,5), 6:(4,5), 7:(3,5), 8:(2,5), 9:(1,5), 10:(1,4), 11:(1,3), 12:(2,3)\n> \n> So (1,5) is index 9, occupied.\n> \n> D to (1,5) is down, which is body, collision.\n> \n> L: left to (0,6) — x=0 is border wall, invalid.\n> \n> R: right to (2,6) — (2,6) is index 1, body, and also reverse direction not allowed.\n> \n> So all moves seem invalid? That can't be right.\n> \n> U: (1,7) wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (1,5) body, invalid.\n> \n> L: (0,6) wall, invalid.\n> \n> R: (2,6) body and reverse, invalid.\n> \n> But the snake must be able to move; I think I made a mistake.\n> \n> At turn 48, after moving to (1,6), the position (1,5) is still occupied, but when I move down from (1,6) to (1,5), it would be moving to a body cell, which is not allowed unless it's the tail and moving into it is ok, but in this case, (1,5) is not the tail; tail is (2,3).\n> \n> Moving to any body cell except the tail is collision. Here, (1,5) is a body segment, not tail, so moving there causes collision.\n> \n> Similarly, all other directions blocked.\n> \n> But that means at turn 49, from (1,6), there are no valid moves? That can't be, unless the snake is trapped.\n> \n> But let's list free cells around (1,6):\n> \n> - North: (1,7) wall\n> \n> - South: (1,5) body\n> \n> - West: (0,6) wall\n> \n> - East: (2,6) body\n> \n> All adjacent cells are either wall or body, so indeed, no possible move.

Let's examine this carefully:\n\nIf we move D to (1,5):\n- New head position: (1,5)\n- The segment that was at (1,5) (index 9) would move to (1,4)\n- The segment that was at (1,4) (index 10) would move to (1,3)\n- The segment that was at (1,3) (index 11) would move to (2,3)\n- The tail at (2,3) would be removed (since no food is eaten)\n\nThis would result in the head and segment 10 both trying to occupy (1,5) simultaneously, which would be a collision. Therefore, this move is not valid.\n\nSince all possible moves lead to collisions or walls, the only possible conclusion is that the snake has no valid moves in this state and will collide regardless of the chosen action.\n\nHowever, since we must choose an action, and considering that in some snake implementations moving into your own body in this way is allowed (with the body shifting simultaneously), we'll choose the least harmful option:\n\n\\boxed{D}",
