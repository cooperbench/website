        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to understand the current state of the Snake game.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. This means the snake cannot move outside the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are additional walls at specific coordinates: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6). These are like barriers within the grid that the snake must avoid.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake currently consists of only its head at (3, 3). There are no body segments since the length is 1.\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving to the Left (\"L\").\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three pieces of food on the grid:\n     - (5, 6): value = 1, life_span = 10\n     - (5, 1): value = 1, life_span = 10\n     - (4, 3): value = 1, life_span = 10\n   - All food is positive (value = +1), and none is negative in this scenario.\n   - The life_span indicates how many turns the food will remain before disappearing. Here, all have a life_span of 10, meaning they'll disappear after 10 turns if not eaten.\n\n### Current Snake Position and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 3), moving Left (\"L\"). \n\nFrom any position (x, y), the possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (x, y+1)\n- Down (D): (x, y-1)\n- Left (L): (x-1, y)\n- Right (R): (x+1, y)\n\nHowever, there are constraints:\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left, the snake cannot move Right in the next move because that would be the opposite direction.\n   - Allowed moves from Left: Up, Down, Left\n   - Disallowed move: Right\n\n2. **Wall Collisions**: The snake cannot move into a cell that is a wall.\n   - Let's check each possible move:\n     - **Left (L)**: (3-1, 3) = (2, 3)\n       - Check if (2, 3) is a wall:\n         - Border walls: x=0 or 7, y=0 or 7 → No\n         - Internal obstacles: (2,3) is not in the list → Not a wall\n       - Valid move.\n     - **Up (U)**: (3, 3+1) = (3, 4)\n       - Check if (3, 4) is a wall:\n         - Internal obstacles: (3,4) is in the list → Wall\n       - Invalid move.\n     - **Down (D)**: (3, 3-1) = (3, 2)\n       - Check if (3, 2) is a wall:\n         - Not in border or internal obstacles → Valid move.\n     - **Right (R)**: Opposite direction → Disallowed.\n\nSo, valid moves from current state: Left, Down.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see where the food is and how we can reach it:\n\n1. **Food at (4, 3)**:\n   - Current head at (3, 3).\n   - To reach (4, 3), need to move Right (R).\n   - But Right is opposite to current direction (Left) → Disallowed.\n   - Cannot reach this food in the next move.\n\n2. **Food at (5, 6)**:\n   - From (3,3), how to reach (5,6)?\n   - Need to move Right twice and Up three times, or some combination.\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\n3. **Food at (5, 1)**:\n   - From (3,3), need to move Right twice and Down twice.\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\nSo, none of the food is directly reachable in the next move. Therefore, the immediate goal is to move towards the nearest food while avoiding walls and not reversing direction.\n\n### Determining the Best Move\n\nGiven that no food is immediately reachable, we should choose a move that:\n- Doesn't collide with walls.\n- Doesn't reverse direction.\n- Moves us closer to one of the food items.\n\nLet's assess the two valid moves:\n\n1. **Left (L) to (2, 3)**:\n   - Distance to foods from (2,3):\n     - (5,6): Manhattan distance = |5-2| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6\n     - (5,1): |5-2| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n     - (4,3): |4-2| + |3-3| = 2 + 0 = 2\n   - Closest is (4,3) with distance 2.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (3, 2)**:\n   - Distance to foods from (3,2):\n     - (5,6): |5-3| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6\n     - (5,1): |5-3| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\n     - (4,3): |4-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n   - Closest is (4,3) with distance 2.\n\nBoth moves bring us equally closer to (4,3) in terms of Manhattan distance. However, moving Left keeps us aligned horizontally with (4,3), while moving Down moves us away vertically.\n\nBut since (4,3) is to our Right (which we can't move to directly), moving Left might not be the best because it takes us away from the food's x-coordinate. Moving Down keeps our x-coordinate the same, and we can potentially move Right in the future to reach (4,3).\n\nHowever, moving Down to (3,2) is also not directly helpful since (4,3) is at x=4, y=3, and we're at x=3, y=2. Next move could be Right to (4,2), then Up to (4,3), but that's two moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving Left to (2,3), then Right to (3,3), then Right to (4,3) is three moves.\n\nBetween the two, moving Down seems slightly better because after Down to (3,2), Right to (4,2), then Up to (4,3) is a path, whereas Left takes longer.\n\nBut also, moving Left to (2,3) might open up other paths, but given the internal obstacles, let's see:\n\nFrom (2,3):\n- Possible moves (assuming direction is now Left):\n  - Cannot move Right (reverse)\n  - Up: (2,4) - is a wall (internal obstacle at (2,4))\n  - Down: (2,2) - is a wall (internal obstacle at (2,2))\n  - Left: (1,3) - not a wall\nSo only Left is possible next, leading to (1,3), which is not helpful.\n\nFrom (3,2):\n- Possible moves (assuming direction is Down):\n  - Cannot move Up (reverse)\n  - Left: (2,2) - wall\n  - Right: (4,2) - not a wall\n  - Down: (3,1) - wall (internal obstacle at (3,1))\nSo only Right is possible next, to (4,2), then can go Up to (4,3).\n\nThus, moving Down seems to keep more options open.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nSince the snake is length 1, there's no body to collide with. Also, no food is under the snake's head or tail (since there is no tail yet). So no immediate dangers in either move.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Left and Down:\n- Left leads to (2,3), with limited next moves (only Left again).\n- Down leads to (3,2), allowing Right next to (4,2), then Up to (4,3).\n\nDown seems more promising for reaching the food at (4,3) in fewer moves.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter evaluating the possible moves and their implications, the best immediate action is to move Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm just starting to understand the rules and the current state, so bear with me as I work through it.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the given information:\n\n- **Current Turn (t₀):** 1\n- **Walls:**\n  - **Border Cells:** x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n  - **Internal Obstacles:** \n    - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n- **Snake Positions:** \n  - Just the head at [(3, 2)]\n  - Since there's only one segment, the snake's length is 1.\n- **Snake Head Direction:** Down (D)\n- **Food Items:**\n  1. (5, 6), value=9, life_span=1\n  2. (5, 1), value=9, life_span=1\n  3. (4, 3), value=9, life_span=1\n  4. (4, 6), value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Visualizing the Grid\n\nTo better understand, let's sketch a simple representation of the grid with the snake and food positions.\n\n```\ny=7 -------------------\ny=6 |   *   *   *   * | * is food, numbers are x coordinates\ny=5 |                 |\ny=4 |   *   *   *   * |\ny=3 |       *         |\ny=2 |     S           | S is snake head at (3,2)\ny=1 |   *   *         |\ny=0 -------------------\n    x=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n```\n\nInternal obstacles are at:\n- (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Down (D), we cannot instantly reverse to Up (U) next turn. So, possible moves are D, L, R.\n\nBut let's check each:\n\n1. **Down (D):** From (3,2) to (3,1)\n   - (3,1) is an internal obstacle (wall) → collision → invalid\n2. **Left (L):** From (3,2) to (2,2)\n   - (2,2) is an internal obstacle → collision → invalid\n3. **Right (R):** From (3,2) to (4,2)\n   - (4,2): \n     - Not a wall (border is x=7, y=7 etc., and no internal obstacle here)\n     - No body segments to collide with (snake length is 1)\n     - Valid move\n\nUp (U) is not allowed because it's the reverse of current direction D.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Right (R) to (4,2) helps in getting food:\n\n- Current food positions:\n  - (5,6), (5,1), (4,3), (4,6)\n  \nMoving to (4,2) doesn't land on any food. But let's see adjacent cells after moving to (4,2):\n\nFrom (4,2), next moves could be towards nearby food:\n\n- (4,3) is food (value=9, life_span=1)\n  - To reach (4,3) from (4,2), need to move Up (U)\n  \nBut since we're moving Right now, next turn's direction would be R, and then we can consider moving U if allowed (no instant reverse rule would apply based on next direction).\n\nHowever, since we're only deciding the immediate action at t₀=1, and the only valid move is R, we don't have other options.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger:** Not applicable here since snake length is 1 (no tail).\n- **Food under body:** Not applicable since snake is only head.\n- **Life Span of Food:** All foods have life_span=1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten. But since we can't reach any this turn, they'll disappear next turn regardless.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid and safe move at turn t₀=1 is Right (R). Other moves lead to collisions with walls or obstacles.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The head is facing Right (R).\n3. **Walls**: There are border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at specific coordinates.\n4. **Food**: There are four pieces of food with their positions, life spans, and values. All have a value of +1 (positive food).\n\n### Objective\n\nThe goal is to decide the next immediate action (U, D, L, R) for the snake to maximize the score by eating positive food while avoiding risks like collisions with walls, body, or negative food (though all food here is positive).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nGiven the snake's current position (4, 2) and direction R, the possible moves are:\n- **Right (R)**: (5, 2)\n- **Up (U)**: (4, 3)\n- **Down (D)**: (4, 1)\n\n**Left (L)** is not possible because it's the opposite of the current direction (R), and the snake cannot reverse direction instantly.\n\n#### Checking Each Move:\n\n1. **Right (R) to (5, 2)**:\n   - Check for walls: x=7 is a border, but (5, 2) is within bounds.\n   - Internal obstacles: (5, 2) is not listed as an obstacle.\n   - Food: No food at (5, 2).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (4, 3)**:\n   - Check for walls: y=7 is the upper border, but (4, 3) is within bounds.\n   - Internal obstacles: (4, 3) is not listed as an obstacle.\n   - Food: There's food at (4, 3) with value +1.\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: Since the snake has only one segment, there's no tail to worry about.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move with immediate reward.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (4, 1)**:\n   - Check for walls: y=0 is the lower border, but (4, 1) is within bounds.\n   - Internal obstacles: (4, 1) is not listed as an obstacle.\n   - Food: No food at (4, 1).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\n- **Up (U)** leads to a food cell (4, 3) with a positive reward. Since the snake is only one segment long, there's no risk of collision with the body or tail.\n- **Right (R)** and **Down (D)** are safe but don't provide any immediate benefit.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Food under the body**: Not applicable here since the snake has only one segment.\n- **Wall collision**: All potential moves are within the grid and not blocked by internal obstacles.\n- **Tail collision**: Not applicable as the snake has no tail yet.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to (4, 3) to eat the positive food there, increasing the snake's length and score.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **New Position**: (4, 3) is valid.\n- **Food Consumption**: The food at (4, 3) will be eaten, increasing the snake's length to 2.\n- **No Collision**: No walls or body segments to collide with.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**: \n   - Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles at specific coordinates: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6).\n3. **Snake**: \n   - Current positions: Head at (4,3), body segment at (4,2).\n   - Current direction: Up (U).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Three pieces of food:\n     - (5,6) with value=1 and life_span=7.\n     - (5,1) with value=1 and life_span=7.\n     - (4,6) with value=1 and life_span=8.\n\n### Snake Movement Constraints\n\n- **Current Direction**: Up (U). This means the snake was moving upwards in the previous turn.\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is U, the snake cannot move D (down) in the next turn. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\n### Possible Actions\n\nGiven the current direction is U, the possible actions are:\n1. **Continue Up (U)**: Move to (4,4).\n2. **Turn Left (L)**: Move to (3,3).\n3. **Turn Right (R)**: Move to (5,3).\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (4,4)\n- **New Head Position**: (4,4).\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (4,4) is within bounds (x=4, y=4 is not a border wall).\n  - **Internal Obstacles**: Check if (4,4) is in the list: No.\n  - **Body Collision**: The body is at (4,2). The new head is at (4,4), which doesn't overlap with the body.\n- **Food Check**: \n  - No food at (4,4).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (3,3)\n- **New Head Position**: (3,3).\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (3,3) is within bounds.\n  - **Internal Obstacles**: Check if (3,3) is in the list: No.\n  - **Body Collision**: Body is at (4,2). New head at (3,3) doesn't overlap.\n- **Food Check**: \n  - No food at (3,3).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5,3)\n- **New Head Position**: (5,3).\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (5,3) is within bounds.\n  - **Internal Obstacles**: Check if (5,3) is in the list: No.\n  - **Body Collision**: Body is at (4,2). New head at (5,3) doesn't overlap.\n- **Food Check**: \n  - No food at (5,3).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Future Moves and Food\n\nSince none of the immediate moves lead to food, we need to consider which move positions the snake better to reach food in the future.\n\n- **Food Locations**:\n  - (5,6): Requires moving right and then up.\n  - (5,1): Requires moving right and then down.\n  - (4,6): Requires moving up.\n\n**Option U (Up)**:\n- Moves towards (4,6), which is directly above the current head at (4,3).\n- Next possible moves from (4,4): U, L, R (can't go D).\n  - U to (4,5): Still towards (4,6).\n  - L to (3,4): Not directly helpful.\n  - R to (5,4): Not directly helpful.\n\n**Option L (Left)**:\n- Moves to (3,3).\n- Next possible moves: U, L, D (can't go R, since current direction would be L).\n  - U to (3,4): Towards (4,6) but not direct.\n  - L to (2,3): Away from food.\n  - D to (3,2): Towards (5,1) but not direct.\n\n**Option R (Right)**:\n- Moves to (5,3).\n- Next possible moves: U, R, D (can't go L).\n  - U to (5,4): Towards (5,6).\n  - R to (6,3): Towards right wall, not helpful.\n  - D to (5,2): Towards (5,1).\n\n### Evaluating Paths to Food\n\n1. **Path to (4,6)**:\n   - Current head at (4,3).\n   - Need to move U three times: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n   - Check for obstacles:\n     - (4,4): Clear.\n     - (4,5): Check internal obstacles: Not listed.\n     - (4,6): Check internal obstacles: (3,6) is nearby but (4,6) is clear.\n   - However, (4,6) is an internal obstacle? Wait, no: internal obstacles are (3,6), not (4,6). So (4,6) is clear.\n\n2. **Path to (5,6)**:\n   - Current head at (4,3).\n   - Move R to (5,3), then U three times: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n   - Check obstacles:\n     - (5,3): Clear.\n     - (5,4): Internal obstacle at (6,4), but (5,4) is clear.\n     - (5,5): Clear.\n     - (5,6): Clear.\n\n3. **Path to (5,1)**:\n   - Current head at (4,3).\n   - Move R to (5,3), then D two times: (5,2), (5,1).\n   - Check obstacles:\n     - (5,3): Clear.\n     - (5,2): Clear.\n     - (5,1): Clear.\n\n### Comparing Paths\n\n- **Path to (4,6)**: 3 moves (U, U, U).\n- **Path to (5,6)**: 4 moves (R, U, U, U).\n- **Path to (5,1)**: 3 moves (R, D, D).\n\nHowever, moving D is not possible after the first move U because of the no instant reverse rule. But in this case, the first move is R, then D is allowed since the current direction would be R, and D is not opposite to R.\n\nBut the initial direction is U, and we're considering R as the first move. After R, the direction is R, and then D is allowed (since D is not opposite to R).\n\n### Immediate Decision\n\nSince all immediate moves are safe but don't lead to food, we need to choose the move that sets up the best path to food.\n\n- **Option U**: Starts the path to (4,6).\n- **Option R**: Starts the path to either (5,6) or (5,1).\n\nLooking at the distances:\n- (4,6) is 3 steps away.\n- (5,6) is 4 steps away.\n- (5,1) is 3 steps away.\n\nBoth (4,6) and (5,1) are equally distant, but (5,1) might be more straightforward since it involves moving R then D, whereas (4,6) is straight up but requires three consecutive U moves, which might limit future flexibility.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Danger\n\nWe also need to ensure that moving doesn't lead to immediate danger in the next steps.\n\n- **Option U**: After (4,4), next possible moves are U, L, R.\n  - U to (4,5): Safe.\n  - Then U to (4,6): Safe.\n- **Option R**: After (5,3), next possible moves are U, R, D.\n  - D to (5,2): Safe.\n  - Then D to (5,1): Safe.\n\nBoth options seem safe.\n\n### Considering Food Life Span\n\nAll foods have high life spans (7 and 8), so they won't disappear soon. Thus, life span isn't a deciding factor here.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince both U and R lead to food in 3-4 steps, but R offers two potential food paths (to (5,6) and (5,1)), while U only leads to (4,6), choosing R might be more flexible.\n\nHowever, (4,6) is directly above and requires fewer turns (all U), whereas (5,1) requires a turn (R then D). \n\nGiven that, moving U seems more straightforward to reach (4,6), but moving R offers more options.\n\n**Final Decision**: Since the snake is currently at (4,3) and moving U to (4,4) starts a direct path to (4,6), which is the closest food, this seems optimal.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 4  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n\n**Snake**:\n- Positions: Head at (4,4), body at (4,3)\n- Current direction: Up (U)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (5,6) - value: 1, life span: 6\n2. (5,1) - value: 1, life span: 6\n3. (4,6) - value: 1, life span: 7\n4. (5,2) - value: 1, life span: 10\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,4) and direction Up (U), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (4,5)\n- **Left (L)**: (3,4)\n- **Right (R)**: (5,4)\n\nCannot move Down (D) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (U), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (4,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,5) is not a wall (border walls are at y=7, so y=5 is safe; no internal walls at (4,5))\n  - Body: Snake's body is at (4,3), so no collision.\n- Check for food:\n  - No food at (4,5).\n- After moving, the new snake positions would be [(4,5), (4,4)].\n\nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (3,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (3,4) is listed as an internal obstacle → collision! This is deadly.\n  \nThis move is not safe.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,4) is not a border wall (x=7 is border, x=5 is fine; y=4 is fine). Check internal obstacles: (6,4) is an obstacle, but (5,4) is not listed → safe.\n  - Body: Snake's body is at (4,3), no collision.\n- Check for food:\n  - No food at (5,4).\n- After moving, the new snake positions would be [(5,4), (4,4)].\n\nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Comparing Safe Moves\n\nBoth Up and Right are safe moves that don't lead to immediate collisions. Neither move lands on food directly. \n\nNow, let's think about future possibilities to decide which move is better strategically.\n\n**Current Food Positions**:\n1. (5,6) - To reach this, moving right first might be better.\n2. (5,1) - Far away, not immediately relevant.\n3. (4,6) - Moving up could help reach this eventually.\n4. (5,2) - Also somewhat reachable from right.\n\n**Potential Paths**:\n- If we move Right to (5,4):\n  - Next could go Up to (5,5), then Right to (6,5), but (6,4) is a wall, so careful.\n  - Or Up to (5,5), then Up to (5,6) to eat the food there.\n  \n- If we move Up to (4,5):\n  - Next could go Right to (5,5), then Up to (5,6) to eat food.\n  - Or continue Up to (4,6) to eat the food there.\n\nBoth paths seem viable, but moving Right first might give more options since (5,4) is more central.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Eats\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately by moving onto it? Currently, no food is at (4,5), (3,4), or (5,4). \n\nHowever, there's a food at (4,6). If we move Up twice:\n- Turn 4: Up to (4,5)\n- Turn 5: Up to (4,6) → eats food there.\n\nBut we're only deciding for the immediate turn (Turn 4).\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that could be dangerous?\n- Snake's body is at (4,3). Is there food there? No, food is at (5,6), (5,1), (4,6), (5,2). So no danger from this.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth Up and Right are safe. Moving Right might give slightly more flexibility for future moves towards multiple foods. Moving Up could lead towards (4,6) food in two steps.\n\nGiven that, and since both are equally safe now, I'll choose to move Right to (5,4) to keep options open.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (cannot move beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacles: \n     - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (5,4), body at (4,4).\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5,6): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (5,1): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (4,6): value=1, life_span=6\n   - (5,2): value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,4) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (5,3)\n- **Left (L)**: (4,4) — but this is the body segment, and since the tail will move, this is technically allowed unless it causes a collision.\n- **Right (R)**: (6,4)\n\nHowever, we cannot instantly reverse the direction. Current direction is R, so we cannot move Left (L) next. So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\nLet's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (5,5)**:\n   - Check for walls: (5,5) is not in the internal obstacles list, and y=5 is within borders.\n   - Check for body: Snake body is at (4,4), so no collision.\n   - Food: No food at (5,5).\n   - Next steps: From (5,5), possible future moves could aim towards food at (5,6) or (4,6).\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (5,3)**:\n   - Check for walls: (5,3) is not in internal obstacles, and y=3 is within borders.\n   - Check for body: No collision.\n   - Food: No food at (5,3).\n   - Next steps: From (5,3), could aim towards food at (5,2) or (5,1).\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (6,4)**:\n   - Check for walls: (6,4) is an internal obstacle! Cannot move here.\n   - So, this move is invalid.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nNow, let's see if any food is immediately accessible:\n\n- Food at (5,6): To reach this, need to move up twice: (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (5,6).\n- Food at (5,1): Need to move down three times: (5,4) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1).\n- Food at (4,6): Need to move left then up: (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (4,6). But moving left is reverse of current direction (R), which is not allowed next.\n- Food at (5,2): Need to move down twice: (5,4) -> (5,3) -> (5,2).\n\nNone of the food is immediately adjacent to the head, so no immediate eating in the next move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if any food is on the tail (which is at (4,4)):\n- No food is listed at (4,4), so no danger from this.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nBetween U and D:\n- Moving U to (5,5) gets closer to food at (5,6) and (4,6).\n- Moving D to (5,3) gets closer to food at (5,2) and (5,1).\n\nBoth moves are safe. Let's see which food is more urgent based on life_span:\n- (5,6): life_span=5 (current turn is 5, so disappears after this turn if not eaten now, but it's not adjacent).\n- (5,1): life_span=5 (same).\n- (4,6): life_span=6.\n- (5,2): life_span=9.\n\nThe foods at (5,6) and (5,1) are about to disappear after this turn, but we can't reach them in one move. So, no immediate urgency.\n\nBetween U and D, both are equally safe and neither leads directly to food. Maybe prefer moving up to stay away from the wall at y=0 (though not immediately a concern).\n\nAlternatively, moving down towards (5,2) which has a longer life_span, but not urgent.\n\nGiven that, both moves are fine. Maybe slightly prefer up to explore more space.\n\nBut looking at the internal obstacles, moving down to (5,3) is safe, then next could go to (5,2) to eat food there.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,5), then next could go to (5,6) to eat that food (but it disappears after this turn, so next turn it's gone).\n\nWait, life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 5, food with life_span 5 will disappear after this turn, meaning it's still there at turn 5, gone at turn 6.\n\nSo at turn 5, can still eat food with life_span 5, but need to be adjacent to eat next turn.\n\nBut since we can't reach (5,6) or (5,1) in one move, they'll be gone next turn regardless.\n\nSo no immediate benefit to prioritize them.\n\nBetween moving up or down, both are safe. Maybe moving down to (5,3) is better because next move can go to (5,2) to eat that food (life_span 9, so plenty of time).\n\nMoving up to (5,5), next could go to (5,6) but it's gone, or (4,5) then (4,6), but that's two moves away.\n\nSo moving down seems slightly better to aim for (5,2).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest and most promising immediate move is **Down (D)** to (5,3), setting up to potentially eat the food at (5,2) in the next move.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacles: \n     - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (5,3), body at (5,4).\n   - Current direction: Down (D) — meaning the snake was moving downward in the previous turn.\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5,6): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (5,1): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (4,6): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (5,2): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,3), the snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, we must consider:\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is D (Down), the opposite is U (Up). So, we cannot move Up next.\n  \nThus, possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (5,2)\n- New head position: (5,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,2) is not a wall (no internal obstacle at (5,2), and y=2 is not a border wall.\n  - Body: The body is at (5,4). After moving, the tail moves from (5,4) to (5,3), so the new body is [(5,3)]. Head at (5,2) does not collide with body at (5,3).\n- Food at (5,2): Yes, there's food here with value=1, life_span=8.\n  - Eating this food: \n    - Reward: +1\n    - Length increases by 1: new body becomes [(5,3), (5,4)] (head at (5,2)).\n    - Check for Tail Reward Danger: \n      - After eating, new tail is at (5,4). \n      - Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (5,2), tail at (5,4): they are two cells apart vertically (not adjacent), so no danger.\n- Other considerations:\n  - Moving down from (5,3) to (5,2) is valid, no immediate collision.\n  - Eating positive food is good.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (4,3)\n- New head position: (4,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,3) is not a wall (no internal obstacle listed here).\n  - Body: Current body is at (5,4). After moving, tail moves to (5,3), so body is [(5,3)]. Head at (4,3) does not collide with (5,3).\n- Food: No food at (4,3).\n- Next steps:\n  - No reward, just moving safely.\n  - Not as beneficial as moving to food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6,3)\n- New head position: (6,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (6,3) is not a wall (internal obstacle at (6,4), but not (6,3)).\n  - Body: After moving, body is [(5,3)]. Head at (6,3) does not collide.\n- Food: No food at (6,3).\n- Next steps:\n  - Safe move, but no immediate benefit.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Down (D)**: Leads to eating positive food at (5,2), increasing length and score. No immediate danger.\n- **Left (L)** and **Right (R)**: Safe but no immediate gain.\n\n### Potential Risks with Down (D)\n\nIs there any risk in moving Down to (5,2)?\n\n- After eating, the snake grows to length 3: head at (5,2), body at (5,3), tail at (5,4).\n- Next possible moves from (5,2):\n  - Can't move Up (reverse of Down).\n  - Possible: Down to (5,1) — but (5,1) is food with value=1, but let's see:\n    - Moving to (5,1): \n      - New head at (5,1), body at [(5,2), (5,3)], tail at (5,4).\n      - Eating food at (5,1): \n        - New length: head at (5,1), body at [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4)].\n        - Then, tail is at (5,4), head at (5,1): distance is 3, no adjacency.\n    - But after that, moving further down is not possible (y=0 is wall).\n    - Alternatively, could move left or right from (5,1):\n      - Left to (4,1): \n        - (4,1): is it a wall? Internal obstacles include (3,1), not (4,1), so safe.\n      - Right to (6,1): \n        - (6,1): no wall, safe.\n  - So, moving Down now seems to lead to a path where we can continue to eat food safely.\n\n### Checking Other Foods\n\nIs there a better food to target?\n\n- (5,6): To reach this, need to go Up, but current direction is D, so can't reverse to U.\n- (4,6): Could plan to go Left then Up, but current move can't be U.\n- (5,1): Can reach by going Down twice, which seems possible as above.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Down (D)** to (5,2), eating the positive food there, which increases the score and length safely without any immediate or foreseeable dangers in the next steps.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

(5,1) is not in body.\n   - Check for food: (5,1) has food with value 3.\n     - If we eat this, snake length increases by 1 (from 3 to 4), and score +3.\n     - But we need to check \"Tail Reward Danger\": \n       - Current tail is at (5,4). Adjacent cells to tail are (4,4), (6,4), (5,3), (5,5). Head is moving to (5,1), which is not adjacent to tail, so no danger.\n   - So, moving D is safe and gets us +3.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**: New head position would be (4,2)\n   - Walls: (4,2) is not a border or internal obstacle.\n   - Body: Not in [(5,3), (5,4)].\n   - Food: No food at (4,2).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**: New head position would be (6,2)\n   - Walls: (6,2) is not a border or internal obstacle.\n   - Body: Not in body segments.\n   - Food: No food at (6,2).\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- D: +3 score, safe.\n- L: safe, no score.\n- R: safe, no score.\n\nMoving Down seems the best as it gives us +3 immediately. \n\nBut let's check if there's any immediate danger after eating the food at (5,1):\nAfter eating, snake becomes [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)]. Next move, tail moves from (5,4) to (5,3), so no collision issues.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,1) has life_span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. So it's now or never for that +3.\n\nOther foods:\n- (5,6): life_span 1, but we're at (5,2), can't reach in one move.\n- (4,6): life_span 1, can't reach.\n- (6,5): life_span 1, can't reach.\n\nSo, no other food is reachable this turn except (5,1).\n\n### Verifying No Better Options\n\nIs there a better long-term move? Maybe moving towards higher value food next turn? But all other foods have life_span 1, so they'll disappear next turn anyway. So no benefit in moving towards them now.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nIs there any risk in moving Down to (5,1)?\n- Next turn, snake is at [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)].\n- Possible moves from there:\n  - Current direction is D, so can't move U.\n  - Can move D to (5,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n  - Can move L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n    - (4,1): walls - (3,1) is wall, but (4,1) is not listed as wall, so safe.\n    - (6,1): not a wall, safe.\n  - So next turn we'd have options, no immediate dead end.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBest immediate action is to move Down to eat the +3 food at (5,1), as it's safe and provides the highest immediate reward with no better alternatives.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are several internal walls at specific coordinates: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is at [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)].\n     - Head is at (5,1).\n     - The body segments follow: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving \"D\" (Down). This means the last move was from (5,2) to (5,1) (since moving down decreases the y-coordinate).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three pieces of food:\n     1. (5,6): value = 2, life_span = 1.\n     2. (4,6): value = 3, life_span = 1.\n     3. (6,5): value = 9, life_span = 1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Down (D), the snake cannot immediately move Up (U) next.\n   - **Allowed Moves**: D, L, R.\n   - **Disallowed Move**: U.\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**: The snake cannot move into a cell that is a wall or an internal obstacle.\n   - Current head position: (5,1).\n   - Possible moves from (5,1):\n     - D: (5,0) → y=0 is a border wall → **Invalid**.\n     - L: (4,1) → Check if (4,1) is a wall or obstacle.\n       - Internal obstacles include (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6).\n       - (4,1) is not in this list → **Valid**.\n     - R: (6,1) → Check if (6,1) is a wall or obstacle.\n       - (6,4) is an obstacle, but (6,1) is not listed → **Valid**.\n\n3. **Body Collision**: The snake cannot move into a cell occupied by its own body, except the tail which will move away.\n   - Current body segments: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4).\n   - Possible moves:\n     - L to (4,1): Not occupied by body → **Valid**.\n     - R to (6,1): Not occupied by body → **Valid**.\n     - D to (5,0): Already invalid due to wall.\n\nSo, the possible valid moves are Left (L) and Right (R).\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions and their values to decide which move might be beneficial:\n\n1. **Food at (5,6)**:\n   - Value: +2.\n   - Distance from head (5,1):\n     - Manhattan distance: |5-5| + |6-1| = 5.\n   - Life_span: 1. This means it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn, including current).\n   - To reach (5,6) in one move is impossible (distance is 5).\n   - Not immediately accessible.\n\n2. **Food at (4,6)**:\n   - Value: +3.\n   - Distance: |4-5| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6.\n   - Life_span: 1 → disappears after this turn.\n   - Not immediately accessible.\n\n3. **Food at (6,5)**:\n   - Value: +9.\n   - Distance: |6-5| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n   - Life_span: 1 → disappears after this turn.\n   - Not immediately accessible.\n\nNone of the food can be eaten in the immediate next move because they are all too far away and will disappear after this turn. Therefore, the immediate goal is to avoid collisions and position the snake for future food collection.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nSince we can't eat any food this turn, we need to ensure that the next move doesn't lead to a dead end or immediate danger in the future.\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (4,1)**:\n   - New head position: (4,1).\n   - Body will follow: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)] → tail (5,4) is removed.\n   - Next possible moves from (4,1):\n     - Current direction is L (since we moved left).\n     - Cannot move R (reverse).\n     - Possible moves: L, U, D.\n       - L: (3,1) → internal obstacle → **Invalid**.\n       - U: (4,2) → check walls/obstacles:\n         - Not a wall or obstacle → **Valid**.\n       - D: (4,0) → y=0 is wall → **Invalid**.\n     - So, only U is possible next move.\n   - After moving U to (4,2), possible moves:\n     - Current direction U.\n     - Cannot move D.\n     - Possible: U, L, R.\n       - U: (4,3) → check:\n         - Not a wall or obstacle → **Valid**.\n       - L: (3,2) → check:\n         - (3,1) is obstacle, but (3,2) is not listed → **Valid**.\n       - R: (5,2) → check:\n         - (5,2) is part of the body in the next state after initial move, but in the state after moving U to (4,2), the body is [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2)].\n         - Moving to (5,2) would collide with the body segment (5,2) which is not the tail (tail is (5,1)) → **Invalid**.\n     - So, next possible moves after U: U or L.\n\n   - This path seems somewhat limiting but not immediately deadly.\n\n2. **Move Right (R) to (6,1)**:\n   - New head position: (6,1).\n   - Body: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)] → tail (5,4) removed.\n   - Next possible moves from (6,1):\n     - Current direction R.\n     - Cannot move L.\n     - Possible moves: R, U, D.\n       - R: (7,1) → x=7 is wall → **Invalid**.\n       - U: (6,2) → check:\n         - Not a wall or obstacle → **Valid**.\n       - D: (6,0) → y=0 is wall → **Invalid**.\n     - So, only U is possible next move.\n   - After moving U to (6,2), possible moves:\n     - Current direction U.\n     - Cannot move D.\n     - Possible: U, L, R.\n       - U: (6,3) → check:\n         - Not a wall or obstacle → **Valid**.\n       - L: (5,2) → check:\n         - Body is [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2)].\n         - (5,2) is the tail (since tail was (5,1) before, now it's (5,2)) → **Valid** (can move to tail).\n       - R: (7,2) → x=7 is wall → **Invalid**.\n     - So, next possible moves after U: U or L.\n\n   - Similar to moving left, moving right also leads to a somewhat constrained path but not immediately deadly.\n\n### Comparing Left and Right Moves\n\nBoth left and right moves lead to similar immediate constraints where the next move is forced to be Up. However, let's see if one offers better future options:\n\n- **Left to (4,1)**:\n  - Next move must be U to (4,2).\n  - Then can move U to (4,3) or L to (3,2).\n    - (3,2): next to obstacle at (3,1), but not directly blocked.\n    - (4,3): open path upwards.\n\n- **Right to (6,1)**:\n  - Next move must be U to (6,2).\n  - Then can move U to (6,3) or L to (5,2).\n    - (5,2): moving towards the body's previous position, but since tail moves, it's safe.\n    - (6,3): open path upwards.\n\nNeither seems significantly better than the other in terms of immediate future moves. However, moving right might be slightly better because:\n\n- After moving right to (6,1) and then up to (6,2), the next move to (5,2) is towards the center of the grid, which might offer more flexibility in future moves compared to moving left towards the edge (x=4 is closer to the left wall x=0).\n\n### Checking for Food Accessibility After Moves\n\nEven though current food will disappear, let's see if moving in one direction makes future food more accessible:\n\n- Current food is at (5,6), (4,6), (6,5), all disappearing next turn.\n- New food may spawn next turn, but we can't predict that.\n- Moving right to (6,1) then up to (6,2) brings the head closer to (6,5), but that food will be gone.\n- Moving left to (4,1) then up to (4,2) doesn't particularly help with any current food.\n\nGiven that, both moves are similarly neutral in terms of food access.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to ensure that we're not moving into a position where the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail has positive food that could be eaten in a way that causes a collision. \n\n- Current tail is at (5,4).\n- Adjacent to tail: (4,4), (6,4), (5,3), (5,5).\n  - (6,4) is an internal obstacle.\n  - (5,3) is body.\n  - (5,5) is open.\n  - (4,4) is open.\n- Current head is at (5,1), not adjacent to tail.\n- After moving left to (4,1), new tail is (5,3).\n  - Adjacent to (5,3): (4,3), (6,3), (5,2), (5,4).\n    - None have food currently.\n- After moving right to (6,1), new tail is (5,3) same as above.\n- No immediate danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n\n1. Both left and right moves are valid.\n2. Neither leads to immediate food.\n3. Both have similar future move constraints.\n4. Moving right might keep the snake slightly more centered, offering marginally better future flexibility.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Here's a rough sketch focusing on relevant areas:\n\n```\ny=7 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\ny=6 |   | X |   | X |   | F |   |   |\ny=5 |   |   |   |   |   |   | F |   |\ny=4 |   | X | X | X |   |   | X |   |\ny=3 |   |   |   |   |   | B |   |   |\ny=2 |   | X |   |   |   | B |   |   |\ny=1 |   | X |   |   |   | B | H |   |\ny=0 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n     x=0 x=1 x=2 x=3 x=4 x=5 x=6 x=7\n```\n- H: Head at (6,1)\n- B: Body segments at (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n- F: Food at (5,6), (4,6), (6,5)\n- X: Internal obstacles\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Right (R). The possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) = (6,2)\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) = (6,0)\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) = (5,1)\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) = (7,1)\n\nBut we must consider:\n1. **No instant reverse**: Cannot move Left (L) because that would reverse the current Right (R) direction.\n2. **Wall collisions**:\n   - Right (R) to (7,1): x=7 is a border wall → invalid.\n   - Up (U) to (6,2): Check for obstacles. (6,2) is not listed as an obstacle → valid.\n   - Down (D) to (6,0): y=0 is a border wall → invalid.\n   \nSo, the only valid move is **Up (U)** to (6,2).\n\nBut wait, let's check if (6,2) is occupied by the snake's body:\n- Snake body positions: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n- (6,2) is not in the body → safe.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Up (U) to (6,2) can lead to eating food in the next steps.\n\nCurrent food:\n1. (5,6): value=1, life=1\n   - After this turn (t=9), life becomes 0 → disappears. So, not reachable in one move.\n2. (4,6): value=2, life=1\n   - Same as above, disappears after this turn.\n3. (6,5): value=8, life=1\n   - Disappears after this turn.\n\nSo, none of the current food items can be eaten in this move because they will disappear after this turn, and the snake can't reach them in one move from (6,1).\n\n### Future Considerations\n\nSince all current food disappears after this turn, the immediate move doesn't aim to eat food but to position the snake for future food that may appear.\n\nMoving Up (U) to (6,2):\n- New head position: (6,2)\n- New body: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2)] (tail (5,3) is removed unless we eat food, which we're not)\n\nThis seems safe as:\n- No body collision at (6,2).\n- Not moving into a wall.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if moving to (6,2) could lead to a situation where the head is adjacent to the tail with positive food on the tail cell in the next move.\n\nAfter moving to (6,2):\n- Snake: [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2)]\n- Tail is at (5,2).\n- Adjacent to tail from (6,2): \n  - Left to (5,2) - tail itself.\n  - Down to (6,1) - body segment.\n  - Up to (6,3) - empty.\n  - Right to (7,2) - wall.\n\nNo immediate danger from tail reward in the next move.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any other move that could be better? \n\nOnly valid move is Up (U). Down and Right are invalid due to walls, and Left is invalid due to instant reverse.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and valid move is **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacles: \n     - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (5,2) (tail).\n   - Current direction: Up (U).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (4,6): value=2, life_span=1\n   - (6,5): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (2,1): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,2) and direction U (up, which is increasing y), the possible moves are U, L, R (can't go D because that's opposite of current direction U).\n\nLet's check each:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,2) → (6,3)\n   - Check for walls: (6,3) is not in the wall list.\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - Snake body segments are at (6,1), (5,1), (5,2). (6,3) is not in these.\n   - Valid move.\n   - Is there food at (6,3)? No.\n   \n2. **Left (L)**: (6,2) → (5,2)\n   - Check walls: (5,2) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: (5,2) is the tail. \n     - Normally, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move forward, but we need to check if the tail has positive food that could cause a collision after growing.\n     - Tail is at (5,2). Is there food at (5,2)? No food is listed there.\n     - So, safe to move here.\n   - Is there food at (5,2)? No.\n   \n3. **Right (R)**: (6,2) → (7,2)\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a border wall. So, can't go here.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\nCurrent options: U or L.\n\n**Move Up (U) to (6,3)**:\n- No immediate food.\n- Next moves from (6,3): possible directions would be U, L, R.\n  \n**Move Left (L) to (5,2)**:\n- Moving onto the tail at (5,2).\n- After this move:\n  - New head at (5,2), body segments: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1).\n  - Tail was at (5,2), which moves away, so no collision.\n- No food eaten, so length remains the same.\n  \nBetween U and L, both are safe, but neither gets food immediately. \n\nIs there a strategic advantage to one over the other?\n\nLooking at food positions:\n- (4,6): far away, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn).\n- (6,5): life_span=7, so will stay for a while.\n- (2,1): life_span=10, will stay.\n\nFrom (6,2):\n- Moving U to (6,3) gets us closer to (6,5) which is at (6,5).\n  - From (6,3), next move could be U to (6,4), but (6,4) is a wall, so can't.\n  - So from (6,3), could go L to (5,3) or R to (7,3) (but x=7 is wall), so only L to (5,3).\n  - Then from (5,3), could go towards (6,5) via (5,4), but (6,4) is a wall, so would have to go around.\n\nAlternatively, moving L to (5,2):\n- From (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1) (but current direction was U, so can't go D), L to (4,2), R to (6,2).\n  - R to (6,2) is body at (6,2), but it's the segment that was just behind the head, so after move, it would have moved to (6,1), so (6,2) is empty. But tail was at (5,2), which moves to (5,1), so (6,2) is safe.\n  - But seems convoluted to go back.\n\nMaybe moving U is better to start heading towards (6,5).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs any food adjacent to head (6,2)?\n- (4,6): distance is |6-4| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6\n- (6,5): |6-6| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- (2,1): |6-2| + |2-1| = 4 + 1 = 5\nClosest is (6,5) at distance 3.\n\nFrom (6,2), to reach (6,5), need to go up thrice, but (6,4) is a wall, so can't go directly. Need to go around.\n\nAlternative path:\n- (6,2) → (6,3) → (5,3) → (5,4) → (5,5) → (6,5)\nBut (6,4) is wall, so can't go (5,4) to (6,4).\n\nAnother path:\n- (6,2) → (6,3) → (5,3) → (5,4) → (4,4) → (4,5) → (5,5) → (6,5)\nThis seems possible but long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go left first:\n- (6,2) → (5,2) → (5,3) → (5,4) → (5,5) → (6,5)\nStill same issue at (5,4) to (6,5) blocked by (6,4).\n\nSeems like (6,5) is hard to reach immediately. Maybe better to go towards (2,1) or (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at distance 6, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn), so not worth.\n(2,1) is at distance 5, life_span=10, so can aim for that.\n\nPath to (2,1):\nFrom (6,2):\n- Left moves: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\nBut (2,2) is a wall, so can't go there.\nAlternative:\n- (6,2) → (5,2) → (5,1) → (4,1) → (3,1) is wall, so stuck.\nNot straightforward.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe safest is to move Up to (6,3) to avoid getting stuck and explore more options next turn.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to tail with positive food on tail?\nTail is at (5,2). Adjacent to head (6,2) are:\n- (6,1), (5,2), (7,2) (but x=7 is wall).\n(5,2) is tail. Is there positive food at (5,2)? No food listed there.\nSo no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth U and L are safe, but U seems to open up more options for future moves towards food (6,5), even though it's not directly reachable now. Moving L to (5,2) might lead to being boxed in.\n\n**Action**: Move Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

(4,6): value=1, life_span=1\n2. (6,5): value=6, life_span=1\n3. (2,1): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's sketch a small part of the grid around the snake:\n\n```\ny=7: ... (border wall)\ny=6: ... (food at (4,6)), internal walls at (1,6), (3,6)\ny=5: ... (food at (6,5)), internal wall at (6,4)\ny=4: ... internal walls at (2,4), (3,4)\ny=3: ... snake head at (6,3)\ny=2: ... snake body at (6,2), internal wall at (2,2)\ny=1: ... snake body at (6,1), tail at (5,1), internal walls at (1,1), (3,1), food at (2,1)\ny=0: ...

To reach (6,5), need to move Up twice.\n  - Next move from (6,3) would be to (6,4), but (6,4) is a wall → cannot reach (6,5).\n\n- **Food at (4,6)**:\n  - From (6,3), path would involve moving Left to (5,3), then possibly Up to (5,4), etc., but seems distant and life_span is 1 (will disappear next turn).\n\n- **Food at (2,1)**:\n  - From (6,3), moving Left to (5,3), then Down to (5,2), Left to (4,2), Down to (4,1), Left to (3,1) (wall), so cannot reach (2,1) directly.\n  - Also, life_span is 1 → will disappear next turn.\n\nGiven that all foods have life_span=1, they will disappear after this turn, so we cannot reach any food this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous?\n- Tail is at (5,1). Is there food at (5,1)?\n  - Food positions: (4,6), (6,5), (2,1) → no food at (5,1).\n- So, no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid and safe move is **Left (L)** to (5,3). There are no immediate food opportunities to consider, and no risks associated with this move.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Grid Layout**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7). There are border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at specific coordinates.\n\n2. **Snake State**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list of coordinates. The head is at (5, 3), followed by segments at (6, 3), (6, 2), and (6, 1).\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving left (L).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - At (6, 5): value = 6, life_span = 1\n   - At (2, 1): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current head direction is left (L), the possible moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: Continue in the same direction.\n- **Up (U)** or **Down (D)**: Since the snake is moving left, it can turn up or down (no instant reverse, so right (R) is not allowed).\n\n#### Possible New Head Positions:\n1. **Left (L)**: (5, 3) → (4, 3)\n2. **Up (U)**: (5, 3) → (5, 4)\n3. **Down (D)**: (5, 3) → (5, 2)\n\n### Checking for Collisions and Validity\n\n**1. Left (L) - (4, 3)**\n- **Wall Check**: x=4 is within 0-7, y=3 is within 0-7 → No border wall.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: Check if (4, 3) is in the list of internal obstacles → No.\n- **Body Collision**: Check if (4, 3) is in the snake's body segments [(6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1)] → No.\n\n**2. Up (U) - (5, 4)**\n- **Wall Check**: x=5 is within 0-7, y=4 is within 0-7 → No border wall.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: Check if (5, 4) is in the list → No.\n- **Body Collision**: Check against snake's body → No.\n\n**3. Down (D) - (5, 2)**\n- **Wall Check**: Valid.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: Check → No.\n- **Body Collision**: Check → No.\n\nAll three moves are valid in terms of collisions.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's consider the food items:\n\n1. **Food at (6, 5)**:\n   - Value: +6 (positive food).\n   - Life Span: 1 → It will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n   - Distance from head (5, 3) → Manhattan distance is |6-5| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n   - To reach (6,5) in one move, we need to move to (6,3) first, but (6,3) is already occupied by the snake's body.\n   - **Conclusion**: Not reachable in one move.\n\n2. **Food at (2, 1)**:\n   - Value: +8 (positive food).\n   - Life Span: 1 → Will disappear after this turn.\n   - Distance from head (5, 3) → |2-5| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\n**Immediate Food Consumption**: None of the food items can be eaten in the next move because they are too far away.\n\n### Considering Future Moves and Tail Behavior\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, the goal is to position the snake for future opportunities while avoiding dead ends or traps.\n\n- **Left (L)**: Moves the head to (4, 3).\n  - Opens up the possibility to move towards the center or other areas.\n  - The tail is at (6,1), and the body is at (6,3), (6,2). Moving left doesn't immediately create a collision risk.\n\n- **Up (U)**: Moves the head to (5,4).\n  - The snake's body is to the left and below. Moving up might be safe but doesn't provide any immediate advantage.\n\n- **Down (D)**: Moves the head to (5,2).\n  - The snake's body is to the left and above. Moving down might be safe but doesn't provide any immediate advantage.\n\n### Evaluating the Best Move\n\nSince none of the food items can be eaten in the next move, the priority is to keep the snake safe and avoid collisions.\n\n- **Left (L)**: Continues the current trajectory. The snake is moving away from the tail and body, reducing the risk of immediate collision.\n- **Up (U) or Down (D)**: Changes the direction but doesn't offer any immediate benefit.\n\nGiven that the snake is already moving left and there's no immediate threat or reward, continuing in the same direction seems reasonable.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\n- **Current Tail**: (6,1).\n- **Adjacent to Head (5,3)**: No, because the Manhattan distance is |6-5| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3 > 1.\n- **Food at Tail**: There's no food mentioned at (6,1).\n\nThus, this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest move is to continue left (L). It maintains the current trajectory and avoids any immediate risks.\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's double-check:\n- **New Head Position**: (4,3).\n- **Body Segments**: The tail (6,1) will move away, and the body will shift to [(6,3), (6,2)].\n- **Collision Check**: New head at (4,3) doesn't overlap with any body segment or wall.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the best immediate action is to continue moving left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: \n     - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (4,4), then (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) (tail).\n   - Current direction: Up (U).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,5): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (2,1): value=1, life_span=6\n   - (3,5): value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Up, the snake cannot immediately reverse to Down (no instant reverse rule).\n\nSo, possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (4,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,5) is not a wall (x=4 is not border, y=5 is not border, and (4,5) is not in internal obstacles).\n  - Body: Snake body is at (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). (4,5) is not in these.\n- Food at (4,5)? No food listed there.\n- Safe to move? Yes.\n- Outcome: Just moves forward without eating.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (3,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (3,4) is an internal obstacle! Can't move there.\n- Outcome: Illegal move (wall collision).\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,4) is not a wall (not border, not in internal obstacles).\n  - Body: Snake body is at (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). (5,4) is not in these.\n- Food at (5,4)? No food listed there.\n- Safe to move? Yes.\n- Outcome: Just moves forward without eating.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, the snake isn't adjacent to any food. The closest foods are:\n- (6,5): distance from head (4,4) is |6-4| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n- (2,1): distance is |2-4| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- (3,5): distance is |3-4| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThe closest is (3,5), distance 2. Currently, moving Up or Right doesn't directly get us closer to any food, but let's see:\n\nAfter moving Up to (4,5):\n- Distance to (3,5): |3-4| + |5-5| = 1\n- Distance to (6,5): |6-4| + |5-5| = 2\nNext move could be Left to (3,5) to eat the food.\n\nAfter moving Right to (5,4):\n- Distance to (6,5): |6-5| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2\nNext move could be Up to (5,5), then Right to (6,5).\n\nMoving Up seems slightly better because it reduces the distance to (3,5) to 1, and (3,5) is the closest food.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis is when the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has positive food. Currently:\n- Tail is at (6,3).\n- Adjacent to head (4,4)? |6-4| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\nSo no danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Up and Right, both are safe, but Up gets us closer to the nearest food (3,5). Moving Left is invalid due to the wall.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 15.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) are at: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3)].\n     - Head: (4,5)\n     - Body segments: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3) (tail)\n   - Current head direction: Up (U).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (6,5): value=1, life_span=3\n   - (2,1): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (3,5): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,5) and direction Up (U), the possible moves are Up, Left, or Right (cannot reverse Down immediately from Up).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (x,y) -> (4,6)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is a border, but y=6 is not a wall (internal walls at y=6 are at (1,6) and (3,6), not (4,6)).\n     - Body: Snake segments are at (4,4), (4,3), (5,3). (4,6) is not in these.\n   - Food at (4,6)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (x,y) -> (3,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: Internal walls include (3,1), (3,4), (3,6). (3,5) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (3,5) is not in [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3)].\n   - Food at (3,5)? Yes, value=1, life_span=8.\n     - Eating this food would increase length by 1.\n     - Check Tail Reward Danger: Tail is at (5,3). Adjacent to head (4,5)? \n       - Adjacent means sharing an edge (up, down, left, right). (5,3) is not adjacent to (4,5) (distance is sqrt(1^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(5), not 1.\n       - So no danger from tail food.\n   - Safe and rewarding move.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (x,y) -> (5,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: No walls at (5,5).\n     - Body: (5,5) is not in body segments.\n   - Food at (5,5)? No.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nLet's look at the food positions relative to the head (4,5):\n\n1. (6,5): distance is |6-4| + |5-5| = 2 (right twice).\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n2. (2,1): distance is |2-4| + |1-5| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n   - Far away.\n3. (3,5): distance is |3-4| + |5-5| = 1 (left once).\n   - Directly adjacent to the left.\n\n### Decision\n\n- **Left (L)**: Move to (3,5) to eat the positive food there.\n  - Benefits:\n    - Immediate +1 score.\n    - Increases snake length by 1.\n    - No risk of collision with tail food (tail is not adjacent).\n  - Risks:\n    - None apparent; no immediate collision risks.\n  \nOther moves (Up or Right) are safe but don't provide immediate rewards. Since the goal is to maximize score, eating the food at (3,5) is the best immediate action.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm the tail reward danger isn't present:\n- After eating at (3,5), the snake will grow by 1, so new tail will be where the current tail is (5,3).\n- New head at (3,5), new tail at (5,3). Are they adjacent?\n  - Distance is |3-5| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4, not adjacent.\n- Also, the food is at (3,5), not under the tail, so no issue.\n\n### Checking for Other Dangers\n\nAre there any other dangers in moving left?\n- Next turn, if we're at (3,5), direction is L, possible moves would be U, L, D (no R to reverse).\n- Need to ensure future moves are safe, but for immediate action, left seems safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left to (3,5) to eat the positive food there.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 16  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3)]  \n- Head is at (3,5), direction is Left (L).\n- Body segments: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3) (tail)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (6,5): value=2, life_span=1\n2. (2,1): value=4, life_span=1\n3. (1,3): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is Left (L). From the rules, we cannot make an instant reverse, so we cannot go Right (opposite of Left). Therefore, possible moves are:\n- Up (U)\n- Down (D)\n- Left (L) (continuing in the same direction)\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (2,5)\n- New head position: (2,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but we're at x=2, so no wall collision.\n  - Internal obstacles: Check if (2,5) is an obstacle. The given obstacles are (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6). (2,5) is not in this list.\n  - Body collision: Snake body is at (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3). (2,5) is not in these positions.\n- Food at (2,5)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,6)\n- New head position: (3,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is a wall, we're at y=6, so no.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is an obstacle! So this move would collide with an obstacle.\n- Outcome: Deadly collision, cannot move here.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,4)\n- New head position: (3,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, we're at y=4, so no.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,4) is an obstacle! So this move would collide.\n- Outcome: Deadly collision, cannot move here.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nFrom the possible safe move (Left to (2,5)), let's see if there's any food we can aim for in future moves.\n\nCurrent food:\n1. (6,5): value=2, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn)\n   - Distance from current head (3,5): |6-3| + |5-5| = 3. Cannot reach in one move.\n2. (2,1): value=4, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |2-3| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5. Too far.\n3. (1,3): value=10, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |1-3| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4. Too far.\n\nAll food will disappear next turn (since life_span=1 and countdown decreases this turn), so we can't reach any food this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe should also check if moving left to (2,5) would put us adjacent to the tail with positive food on the tail cell, which could be dangerous.\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,3). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (4,3), (6,3), (5,2), (5,4)\n(2,5) is not adjacent to (5,3), so no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is Left (L) to (2,5). Moving Up or Down leads to collisions with obstacles. There's no reachable food this turn, so the priority is to stay safe.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(2,6) is not in these.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (2,4)\n   - Check for walls: y=4 is not a border wall.\n   - Check for internal obstacles: (2,4) is an internal obstacle.\n   - Invalid move (would hit an obstacle).\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (1,5)\n   - Check for walls: x=1 is not a border wall.\n   - Check for internal obstacles: (1,5) is not listed.\n   - Check for body collision: (1,5) is not in the body.\n   - Valid move.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (3,5)\n   - Cannot reverse direction immediately from Left to Right.\n   - Invalid move.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: Up (U) or Left (L).\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if moving towards any food is beneficial:\n\n1. **Food at (6,5)**:\n   - Value: +1\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Distance from head (2,5): Manhattan distance = |6-2| + |5-5| = 4\n   - To reach in one move: impossible (distance is 4).\n   - Not immediately accessible.\n\n2. **Food at (2,1)**:\n   - Value: +3\n   - Life span: 1\n   - Distance: |2-2| + |1-5| = 4\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n   - Path blocked by obstacles (e.g., (2,2) is an obstacle).\n\n3. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Value: +9\n   - Life span: 1\n   - Distance: |1-2| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n   - Possible path: Left then Down twice, but life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Cannot reach in time.\n\nNone of the food can be eaten in the immediate next move because their life spans are 1, and they're more than one move away.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in the next move?\n\n- **Moving Up (U) to (2,6)**:\n  - Next to tail: The tail is at (4,3). Distance is |2-4| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5. Not adjacent.\n  - No food at (2,6).\n  - Safe move.\n\n- **Moving Left (L) to (1,5)**:\n  - Next to tail: Distance to (4,3) is |1-4| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5. Not adjacent.\n  - No food at (1,5).\n  - Safe move.\n\nBoth moves are safe in terms of not causing immediate collisions.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, we should choose a move that keeps options open for future turns.\n\n- **Moving Up (U) to (2,6)**:\n  - Next possible moves: Left (1,6) - but (1,6) is an obstacle.\n    - So, from (2,6), possible moves: Up (2,7) - wall; Down (2,5) - body (3,5) is moving away, but (2,5) was just left by the head, so body is at (3,5), (4,5), etc., so (2,5) is empty now.\n    - Wait, after moving to (2,6), the body will be [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)], tail at (4,3) will move to (4,4), so (4,3) is free.\n    - So from (2,6), possible moves: Left (1,6) - obstacle; Right (3,6) - obstacle; Down (2,5) - safe; Up (2,7) - wall.\n    - Only Down is safe, which is reversing direction, but not allowed (from U to D is reverse).\n    - So moving Up would leave only Down as an option next turn, which is a reverse and thus illegal.\n    - Hence, moving Up would lead to being stuck next turn.\n\n- **Moving Left (L) to (1,5)**:\n  - Next possible moves: From (1,5), current direction is Left.\n    - Cannot move Right (reverse).\n    - Possible: Up (1,6) - obstacle; Down (1,4) - check: not a wall or obstacle.\n      - (1,4) is not in walls or obstacles.\n      - Body after moving to (1,5): [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)], tail was at (4,3), so new tail is at (4,4).\n      - (1,4) is not in body.\n      - So Down is valid.\n    - Left (0,5) - wall.\n    - So possible next moves: Down.\n    - Not ideal, but better than being stuck like in Up move.\n\nBetween Up and Left, moving Left seems slightly better because at least we have one legal move next turn (Down), whereas moving Up leaves no legal moves next turn.\n\n### Checking for Food Under Snake\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that could be eaten by moving away?\n\nCurrent snake occupies:\n- (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)\n\nFood positions:\n- (6,5), (2,1), (1,3) - none are under the snake's body.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail with positive food at the tail?\n\nTail is at (4,3). Head is at (2,5). Distance is |2-4| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4. Not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1).\n\nNo danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n\n1. No food is immediately accessible.\n2. Moving Up would lead to being stuck next turn.\n3. Moving Left allows at least one legal move next turn (Down).\n\nThe safer choice is to move Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n#### Grid Dimensions and Walls:\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: \n  - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n\n#### Snake:\n- **Positions**: \n  - Head: (1,5)\n  - Body: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]\n  - So, the snake's length is 5.\n- **Current Direction**: Left (L). This means the snake was moving left in the previous turn.\n\n#### Food:\n1. At (2,1):\n   - Value: +1 (positive food)\n   - Life Span: 3 turns (including the current turn, so it will disappear after 3 more counts)\n2. At (1,3):\n   - Value: +1 (positive food)\n   - Life Span: 8 turns\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot move Right (R) in the next move.\n   - Allowed moves: U, D, L\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**: The snake cannot move into a cell that is a wall or an internal obstacle.\n   - Current head position: (1,5)\n   - Possible moves from (1,5):\n     - U: (1,6) → Check if this is a wall or obstacle.\n       - y=6 is not a border wall (border is y=7).\n       - Internal obstacles include (1,6) → So, (1,6) is an obstacle. Cannot move Up.\n     - D: (1,4) → \n       - y=4 is not a border wall.\n       - Internal obstacles: Check if (1,4) is in the list. No. So, it's free.\n     - L: (0,5) → \n       - x=0 is a border wall. Cannot move Left.\n     - R: (2,5) → \n       - Normally allowed, but instant reverse is not allowed (current direction is L, opposite is R). So, cannot move Right.\n\nFrom the above, the only possible move is **Down (D)** to (1,4).\n\nBut let's double-check if moving Down is safe.\n\n### Checking Down Move to (1,4)\n\n- New head position: (1,4)\n- Current body segments: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]\n  - After moving, the tail (last segment) moves forward, so the new body will be:\n    - Head: (1,4)\n    - Body: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n    - The tail (4,4) is removed, and a new segment is added at the head if food is eaten.\n  \n- Is (1,4) occupied by any body segment?\n  - Current body segments: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)\n  - (1,4) is not in this list. So, no body collision.\n  \n- Is there food at (1,4)?\n  - Food is at (2,1) and (1,3). Not at (1,4). So, no food eaten.\n  \n- Is (1,4) a wall or obstacle?\n  - Not a border wall (x=1, y=4 is within bounds).\n  - Not in internal obstacles list. So, safe.\n\n### Are There Better Moves?\n\nCurrently, the only allowed move is Down (D). But let's see if there's any food that can be targeted in future moves to plan ahead.\n\n#### Food at (2,1):\n- Position: (2,1)\n- Life Span: 3 turns (including current turn 18, so disappears after turn 20).\n- To reach (2,1) from (1,5):\n  - Need to move right and down.\n  - But currently, cannot move right (instant reverse).\n  - Even if we could, it's multiple moves away, and the food will disappear soon.\n\n#### Food at (1,3):\n- Position: (1,3)\n- Life Span: 8 turns (disappears after turn 25).\n- From (1,5), to reach (1,3):\n  - Need to move down twice: (1,5) → (1,4) → (1,3).\n  - First move is Down to (1,4), then next move can be Down again to (1,3).\n  - But need to ensure that after first move, the path is clear.\n    - After first move to (1,4), next move to (1,3):\n      - (1,3) is not a wall or obstacle.\n      - Current body after first move: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n      - Next move to (1,3): body will be [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)], tail (4,5) removed.\n      - (1,3) is not in the body segments at that time.\n      - Also, no instant reverse issue since direction would be Down both times.\n  \n- Eating (1,3):\n  - It's positive food (+1, length increases by 1).\n  - Need to check \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n    - When head is at (1,4), is the tail adjacent and has positive food?\n      - Tail is at (4,5).\n      - Adjacent cells to (1,4): (0,4), (2,4), (1,3), (1,5).\n      - (4,5) is not adjacent to (1,4). So, no danger.\n    - When head moves to (1,3), tail is at (3,5).\n      - Adjacent to (1,3): (0,3), (2,3), (1,2), (1,4).\n      - (3,5) is not adjacent. So, no danger.\n  \nSo, moving Down now is safe and aligns with a plan to eat the food at (1,3) next turn.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Better Options\n\nIs there any immediate food to eat in the current move? \n\n- Current head at (1,5). Adjacent cells:\n  - Left: (0,5) - wall.\n  - Right: (2,5) - body segment (cannot move there due to instant reverse).\n  - Up: (1,6) - obstacle.\n  - Down: (1,4) - no food.\n  \nSo, no immediate food to eat in the current move.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nMoving Down to (1,4):\n- Next turn, if we move Down to (1,3), we eat the food.\n- After that, the snake's length increases, and the body will be longer, which may limit future moves.\n- However, currently, this seems the best path to gain score.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only possible move at turn 18 is Down (D) to (1,4), which is safe and aligns with a plan to eat the positive food at (1,3) in the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacles are at: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)].\n     - Head is at (1,4).\n     - Tail is at (4,5).\n   - Current head direction: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous move (from (1,5) to (1,4)).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (2,1): value=2, life_span=1.\n   - (1,3): value=7, life_span=1.\n   - (6,6): value=10, life_span=1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (1,4) and direction D, the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (1,4) → (1,5). But this is the opposite of the current direction (D), so it's not allowed (no instant reverse).\n- **Down (D)**: (1,4) → (1,3).\n- **Left (L)**: (1,4) → (0,4). But x=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: (1,4) → (2,4). Check if (2,4) is occupied:\n  - Internal obstacles include (2,4), so this is a wall. Invalid.\n\nSo, the only possible move is **Down (D) to (1,3)**.\n\n### Checking the Down Move to (1,3)\n\n1. **Is (1,3) a valid position?**\n   - Not a wall: \n     - Borders: y=3 is not a border wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (1,3) is not listed as an obstacle.\n   - Not part of the snake's body (excluding tail which moves away):\n     - Current body segments: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). (1,3) is not in these.\n   - Tail is at (4,5), which is far, so no immediate collision risk from tail.\n\n2. **Is there food at (1,3)?**\n   - Yes: (1,3,7,1) is present with value=7 (positive food), life_span=1.\n   - Eating this food would:\n     - Increase score by +7.\n     - Increase snake length by 1.\n     - The food will disappear after this turn (life_span decreases to 0).\n\n3. **Tail Reward Danger Check**:\n   - Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food at the tail?\n     - Head is at (1,4), tail is at (4,5). They are not adjacent (distance is more than 1).\n     - So no danger from this.\n\n4. **After Moving to (1,3)**:\n   - New head: (1,3).\n   - Body segments: [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)] (tail (4,5) is removed, new segment added at head).\n   - No collision with body or walls.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- **Other Food Items**:\n  - (2,1): Not reachable in one move from (1,4).\n  - (6,6): Far away, not reachable now.\n  \n- **Life Span of Food**:\n  - All foods have life_span=1, so they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Moving down to (1,3) is safe and allows eating high-value food (+7).\n- No other moves are possible due to walls and reverse direction restriction.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid and optimal move is **Down (D)** to (1,3), eating the positive food there for a +7 score.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 20  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: \n  - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n\n**Snake Positions** (head first, then body):\n- Head: (1, 3)\n- Body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\nSo the snake is 6 segments long.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)  \nThis means the snake was moving Down in the previous move. The \"no instant reverse\" rule means we can't move Up next (since that would be opposite to Down).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (2,1): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 1\n2. (6,6): value = 9 (positive), life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (1,3)\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves are:\n- U (Up): (1,4) — but (1,4) is part of the snake's body (second segment), so this would cause a collision. **Invalid**.\n- D (Down): (1,2) — need to check if this is within bounds and not a wall or body.\n- L (Left): (0,3) — x=0 is a border wall. **Invalid**.\n- R (Right): (2,3) — need to check.\n\nSo possible valid moves are Down to (1,2) or Right to (2,3).\n\n### Checking Move Down to (1,2)\n\n- New head position: (1,2)\n- Is (1,2) valid?\n  - Not a wall: borders are x=0,7; y=0,7. (1,2) is within bounds.\n  - Not an internal obstacle: internal obstacles are listed, (1,2) is not among them.\n  - Not part of the snake's body: snake is at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). (1,2) is not in this list.\n- Food at (1,2)? No food listed there.\n- So moving Down is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Checking Move Right to (2,3)\n\n- New head position: (2,3)\n- Is (2,3) valid?\n  - Not a wall: within bounds.\n  - Not an internal obstacle: not in the list.\n  - Not part of the snake's body: not in the list.\n- Food at (2,3)? No food listed there.\n- So moving Right is also safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nWe have two foods:\n1. (2,1): value=1, life=1\n   - Distance from head (1,3):\n     - Manhattan distance: |2-1| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n     - To reach (2,1) from (1,3):\n       - One move Right to (2,3), then two moves Down to (2,1)\n       - But food's life is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Can't reach it in time.\n2. (6,6): value=9, life=1\n   - Distance from (1,3):\n     - |6-1| + |6-3| = 5 + 3 = 8\n   - Life is 1, can't reach it in time.\n\nSo both foods will disappear after this turn, and we can't reach either in this move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (4,5). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n- Head is at (1,3), tail at (4,5).\n- Adjacent means distance of 1 in one direction (same x or y and other coordinate differs by 1).\n- Distance is |4-1| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5, not adjacent.\n- Also, tail is at (4,5), no food is listed there, so no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- No negative food in this scenario.\n- Both foods are positive but will disappear after this turn, so no immediate benefit.\n- Moving Down or Right both seem safe with no immediate reward.\n\n### Choosing Between Down and Right\n\nBoth moves are safe. Let's see which one might set us up better for future moves.\n\n- If we move Down to (1,2):\n  - Next moves from (1,2):\n    - Can't go Up (reverse of Down).\n    - Left to (0,2) is wall.\n    - Right to (2,2) — is (2,2) valid?\n      - (2,2) is an internal obstacle. So can't go Right.\n    - Down to (1,1) — is (1,1) valid?\n      - (1,1) is an internal obstacle. Can't go Down.\n    - So from (1,2), only possible move is Right to (2,2), but that's blocked. So moving Down leads to a dead end next turn.\n\n- If we move Right to (2,3):\n  - Next moves from (2,3):\n    - Can't go Left (reverse of Right).\n    - Up to (2,4):\n      - (2,4) is an internal obstacle. Can't go Up.\n    - Down to (2,2):\n      - (2,2) is an internal obstacle. Can't go Down.\n    - Right to (3,3):\n      - Is (3,3) valid?\n        - Not a wall, not an obstacle, not part of snake's body (snake is at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)).\n      - So Right to (3,3) is possible.\n    - So moving Right gives us at least one option next turn (Right again).\n\nBetween the two, moving Right seems better because it doesn't immediately lead to a dead end next turn.\n\n### Verifying Snake Movement\n\nWhen we move the head to (2,3), the tail moves from (4,5) to (3,5) (since the second-to-last segment was (3,5)), but actually, the tail is the last segment, which is (4,5), and the segment before it is (3,5). When the head moves, the tail segment is removed, and a new head is added at (2,3). So the new snake positions would be:\n- New head: (2,3)\n- Then: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)\nSo the tail is now at (3,5), which was previously the second-to-last segment.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween Down and Right, Right is the better choice because:\n- Both are safe in the immediate move.\n- Moving Down leads to a dead end next turn.\n- Moving Right allows for at least one valid move next turn (Right again to (3,3)).\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Game State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n#### Grid Dimensions and Walls:\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: The following cells are also walls:\n  - (3, 1), (2, 4), (1, 1), (1, 6), (6, 4), (3, 4), (2, 2), (3, 6)\n\n#### Snake:\n- **Positions (head first)**: [(2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)]\n  - Head: (2, 3)\n  - Body segments: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)\n  - Tail: (3, 5)\n- **Current Direction**: R (Right, meaning the snake was moving to the right in the previous move)\n\n#### Food:\n- Only one food item is present:\n  - Position: (6, 6)\n  - Value: 1 (positive food)\n  - Life Span: 9 turns (including the current turn)\n\n### Possible Moves:\nFrom the current head position (2, 3), the snake can move in four possible directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, we must consider:\n1. **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is R, the opposite direction (L) is not allowed unless the snake's length is 1 (which it's not here).\n2. **Wall collisions**: Cannot move into a wall.\n3. **Body collisions**: Cannot move into a body segment unless it's the tail (and even then, must ensure that after moving, the new head position doesn't collide with the new tail position after growth).\n\n#### Evaluating Each Possible Move:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: Move to (3, 3)\n   - Check walls: (3, 3) is not listed as a wall.\n   - Check body: The body segments are at (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). (3,3) is not in this list.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move to (2, 4)\n   - Check walls: (2, 4) is listed as an internal obstacle (wall).\n   - Invalid move (would collide with wall).\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (2, 2)\n   - Check walls: (2, 2) is listed as an internal obstacle (wall).\n   - Invalid move (would collide with wall).\n\n4. **Left (L)**: Move to (1, 3)\n   - Current direction is R, so L is the opposite. Snake length > 1, so instant reverse is not allowed.\n   - Invalid move.\n\nSo, the only valid move is **Right (R)** to (3, 3).\n\n#### Checking for Food:\nThe food is at (6, 6). Moving to (3, 3) does not eat the food, so no need to consider food consumption in this move.\n\n#### Tail Reward Danger:\nEven though we're not eating food now, it's good to note that the tail is at (3, 5). If in the future the head moves adjacent to the tail and there's positive food at the tail's position, eating it would be dangerous because the head and newly grown tail would collide. But this isn't relevant for the current move.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Collisions:\nAfter moving right to (3, 3):\n- New head position: (3, 3)\n- The tail (currently at (3, 5)) will move forward as the snake moves, so the new body will be [(3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)].\n- No collision with the new body segments.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only valid and safe move is to go **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 22 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Layout:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- Internal obstacles (walls) at:\n  - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n  - Head at (3,3), direction is Right (R).\n  - Body segments follow: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), tail at (2,5).\n  \n**3. Food:**\n- Two food items:\n  - (6,6): value = 8, life_span = 1\n  - (1,5): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,3) with direction Right (R), the possible moves are:\n- **Right (R)**: (4,3)\n- **Up (U)**: (3,4)\n- **Down (D)**: (3,2)\n  \nCannot move Left (L) because that's the opposite of the current direction (Right), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (4,3)\n- Check if (4,3) is valid:\n  - Walls: x=7 is border, but x=4 is not a wall. No internal walls at (4,3).\n  - Snake body: Check if (4,3) is in body segments.\n    - Body segments: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — (4,3) is not here.\n  - So, (4,3) is free.\n  \n- Food at (4,3)? No, the foods are at (6,6) and (1,5).\n  \n- Outcome: Just move without eating, snake moves forward, tail moves forward (last segment (2,5) is removed).\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,4)\n- Check (3,4):\n  - Walls: Internal wall at (3,4) — cannot move here.\n  \n- Outcome: Invalid move.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,2)\n- Check (3,2):\n  - Walls: No walls at (3,2).\n  - Snake body: Is (3,2) in body? No.\n  \n- Food at (3,2)? No.\n  \n- Outcome: Just move without eating.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n1. (6,6): value=8, life=1\n   - Distance from head (3,3): |6-3| + |6-3| = 6 steps away. Not reachable in one move.\n   \n2. (1,5): value=10, life=1\n   - Currently under snake's body segment (1,5) (which is the 4th segment from head).\n   - To eat this:\n     - The body must move away from (1,5), and then head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, tail is at (2,5), next is (1,5). If we move such that tail moves away from (1,5), then next turn head can move to (1,5).\n     - But life_span is 1, so next turn it disappears. So cannot eat it now or next turn.\n     - Also, even if it had more life, moving to eat it would require the head to be adjacent to tail with positive food, which is dangerous (Tail Reward Danger).\n   \n   - So, cannot eat (1,5) safely now.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nLooking at the tail at (2,5):\n- Adjacent to head (3,3)? Let's see:\n  - (2,5) is left and up from (3,3): not adjacent (distance is |2-3| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3).\n  - Adjacent means distance of 1 (up, down, left, right).\n  - So no immediate danger from tail food.\n\nBut (1,5) is under body, not tail, so no direct danger unless head moves to tail's position with food, which isn't the case here.\n\n### Best Move\n\nFrom the valid moves:\n- Right to (4,3): safe, no food.\n- Down to (3,2): safe, no food.\n\nBoth are safe, but which is better?\n- Moving Right continues the current direction.\n- Moving Down changes direction, which might be useful for future flexibility.\n\nBut since both are safe and no immediate food to grab, either is fine. Typically, continuing straight (Right) is a safe default unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nHowever, let's think ahead:\n- After moving Right to (4,3), next moves could be Right to (5,3), etc., heading towards (6,6) food, but it's far.\n- Moving Down to (3,2) might open up more space to maneuver later.\n\nGiven that both are safe and no immediate food benefit, choosing Right maintains the current path.\n\nBut looking at the snake's body shape, moving Right might be slightly better as it moves away from the convoluted body path.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nWait, is there any food that can be eaten now?\n- (1,5) is under body, cannot eat now.\n- (6,6) is too far.\n\nSo no immediate food to eat.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth Right and Down are safe. Since Right is the current direction and no immediate benefit to turning, choosing Right seems reasonable.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are specific cells that are also walls: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is at [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)].\n     - Head is at (4,3).\n     - Tail is at (1,5).\n   - **Current Direction**: The snake is moving Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,6): Value = 7, Life Span = 1.\n   - (1,5): Value = 9, Life Span = 1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the snake is currently moving Right (R), it cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) in the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (5,3)\n- **New Head Position**: (5,3).\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - x=5, y=3: Not a border wall (x≠0,7; y≠0,7).\n  - Not in internal obstacles list.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - Snake body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5).\n  - (5,3) is not in the body.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - No food at (5,3).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4,4)\n- **New Head Position**: (4,4).\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - x=4, y=4: Not a border wall.\n  - Not in internal obstacles list.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - (4,4) is not in the body.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - No food at (4,4).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4,2)\n- **New Head Position**: (4,2).\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - x=4, y=2: Not a border wall.\n  - Not in internal obstacles list.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - (4,2) is not in the body.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - No food at (4,2).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nThere are two food items:\n\n1. **(6,6)**: Value = +7, Life Span = 1.\n   - Distance from head (4,3): |6-4| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n   - It's far and will disappear next turn (life_span=1).\n   - Not reachable in this move.\n\n2. **(1,5)**: Value = +9, Life Span = 1.\n   - Currently under the tail (tail is at (1,5)).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The tail must move away (which it will if the snake moves forward).\n     - Then, the head must move onto (1,5).\n   - However, moving the head to (1,5) now is impossible in one move from (4,3).\n   - Also, even if we could, the tail is at (1,5), and eating it would make the head and new tail collide (since the snake would grow by 1, making the new tail at the old tail's position, which is where the head would be).\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: Eating food under the tail when head is adjacent to tail is deadly.\n   - Currently, head is at (4,3), tail at (1,5): distance is |4-1| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5, not adjacent.\n   - But to eat (1,5), we'd have to move the head there, which is not possible in one move.\n   - So, cannot eat this food now.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nAll three possible moves (U, D, R) are safe with no immediate food to eat. We should choose a move that:\n- Doesn't lead to a dead end.\n- Potentially moves towards areas with more food in future turns.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n- Moving Right (R) to (5,3) is towards the center and away from walls.\n- Moving Up (U) to (4,4) is also safe but doesn't seem advantageous.\n- Moving Down (D) to (4,2) is safe but may limit future options.\n\nGiven that, moving Right seems the most open path.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\nAfter moving Right to (5,3):\n- Next possible moves would be U, D, R (cannot go Left, opposite of Right).\n- Let's see possible next moves from (5,3):\n  - U to (5,4): Check walls and body.\n    - Not a wall, not in body (current body after move would be [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)]).\n    - Safe.\n  - D to (5,2): \n    - Not a wall, not in body.\n    - Safe.\n  - R to (6,3):\n    - x=6 is not a border wall (x=7 is).\n    - Check internal obstacles: (6,4) is a wall, but (6,3) is not listed.\n    - Not in body.\n    - Safe.\n\nSo, moving Right doesn't immediately trap the snake.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince all immediate moves are safe and no food is immediately accessible without danger, the best choice is to continue moving Right to keep options open for future turns.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 24.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)].\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,6): value=6, life_span=1.\n   - (1,5): value=8, life_span=1.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's plot the snake and food positions to better understand the scenario.\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head: (5,3)\n  - Body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)\n  \n  The snake is moving right (R), so its head is at (5,3), and the body extends left to (4,3), then down to (1,3), and makes a turn up to (1,4).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,6): Positive food (value=6), life_span=1 (will disappear next turn).\n  - (1,5): Positive food (value=8), life_span=1 (will disappear next turn).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current direction (Right), the possible moves are:\n\n- **Right (R)**: (6,3)\n- **Up (U)**: (5,4)\n- **Down (D)**: (5,2)\n\nCannot move Left (L) because that's the opposite of current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential rewards.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (6,3)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, but (6,3) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: Check if (6,3) is in the internal obstacles list. It's not.\n  - Body collision: The snake's body segments are at (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4). (6,3) is not in this list.\n  \n  So, moving right is safe in terms of collisions.\n\n- Food at (6,3)? No, the foods are at (6,6) and (1,5).\n\n- After moving right:\n  - New head: (6,3)\n  - Tail moves forward: The last segment (1,4) is removed, and the new tail is (1,3).\n  - New body: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)].\n\n  No food is eaten, so length remains the same.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,4)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper wall, (5,4) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,4) is not in the list.\n  - Body collision: Check if (5,4) is in body segments. Current body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4). (5,4) is not here.\n  \n  Moving up is safe.\n\n- Food at (5,4)? No.\n\n- After moving up:\n  - New head: (5,4)\n  - Tail moves: remove (1,4), new tail is (1,3).\n  - New body: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)].\n\n  No food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,2)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is the lower wall, (5,2) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,2) is not in the list.\n  - Body collision: Check if (5,2) is in body segments. Current body doesn't include (5,2).\n  \n  Moving down is safe.\n\n- Food at (5,2)? No.\n\n- After moving down:\n  - New head: (5,2)\n  - Tail moves: remove (1,4), new tail is (1,3).\n  - New body: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)].\n\n  No food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nBoth foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn. So, if we don't eat them now, they'll be gone.\n\n1. **Food at (6,6)**:\n   - Current head: (5,3)\n   - To reach (6,6) from (5,3):\n     - Need to move right to (6,3), then up to (6,4), then up to (6,5), then up to (6,6). That's 3 moves, but food disappears next turn, so impossible to reach in time.\n   \n   So, cannot eat (6,6).\n\n2. **Food at (1,5)**:\n   - Current head: (5,3)\n   - Snake body goes up to (1,4).\n   - To reach (1,5):\n     - From (5,3), moving left to (4,3), then (3,3), then (2,3), then (1,3), then up to (1,4), then up to (1,5). That's 5 moves, but food disappears next turn, so impossible to reach in time.\n   \n   Wait, but the snake's tail is at (1,4). If we can move the head to (1,5) in one move, but currently the head is at (5,3), which is not adjacent to (1,5). So, cannot reach (1,5) in one move.\n\nHmm, seems like both foods are unreachable in this turn. So, no food can be eaten this turn regardless of the move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\n- Current tail: (1,4)\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (0,4) [left, but x=0 is wall], (2,4) [right, but (2,4) is an internal obstacle], (1,3) [down], (1,5) [up].\n  \n  - (1,3) is part of the body (second last segment), so not empty.\n  - (1,5) has food, but head is at (5,3), not adjacent to (1,5).\n  \nSo, no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nSince no food can be eaten this turn, the priority is to move safely to a position that might set up future opportunities.\n\nCurrent head: (5,3), direction: R.\n\nPossible safe moves: R, U, D.\n\nLet's consider future moves:\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (6,3)**:\n   - Next moves from (6,3):\n     - Can't go left (opposite of R).\n     - Can go up to (6,4) or down to (6,2).\n     - (6,4): Check if it's an obstacle. Internal obstacles include (6,4)? Yes, (6,4) is an internal obstacle.\n     - (6,2): Not an obstacle.\n     - So, from (6,3), can go down to (6,2) or up to (6,4) but (6,4) is blocked, so only down.\n     - Not very flexible.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (5,4)**:\n   - Next moves from (5,4):\n     - Current direction is U, so can't go D.\n     - Can go L to (4,4), R to (6,4), or continue U to (5,5).\n     - (6,4) is obstacle, so can go L or U.\n     - More options here.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (5,2)**:\n   - Next moves from (5,2):\n     - Can't go U (opposite of D).\n     - Can go L to (4,2), R to (6,2), or D to (5,1).\n     - (6,2) is not an obstacle.\n     - (5,1): Check if it's an obstacle. Internal obstacles include (3,1), (1,1), but not (5,1).\n     - So, can go L, R, or D.\n     - Also flexible.\n\nBetween U and D, both offer flexibility for next moves. \n\nLooking at the snake's body after moving:\n\n- After U: body goes up to (5,4), then back to (5,3), etc.\n- After D: body goes down to (5,2), then back to (5,3), etc.\n\nNeither seems to box us in immediately. \n\nLooking at the food positions, both will disappear next turn, so no immediate gain, but moving towards areas with more open space might be better.\n\nMoving Up to (5,4) seems slightly better because it moves the head away from the long body stretch along y=3, opening more space.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest and most flexible move is to go **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the snake's position, the food available, and the obstacles present.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. This means the snake cannot move outside the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are several internal walls at specific coordinates:\n     - (3, 1), (2, 4), (1, 1), (1, 6), (6, 4), (3, 4), (2, 2), (3, 6)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body segments are at:\n     - Head: (5, 4)\n     - Body: (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3)\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving \"Up\" (U), meaning its head is at (5,4) and was moving towards increasing y (from (5,3) to (5,4)).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6, 6): value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - (1, 5): value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - (3, 2): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction immediately. Since the current direction is U, the opposite direction is D, which is not allowed next. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move from (5,4) to (5,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (5,5) is not a wall (x=5 is not border, y=5 is not border, and it's not in the internal obstacles list).\n     - Body: The snake's body segments are at (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3). (5,5) is not in these, so no collision.\n   - Food at (5,5)? No food is listed at (5,5).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move from (5,4) to (4,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,4) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (4,4) is not in the body segments.\n   - Food at (4,4)? No food there.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move from (5,4) to (6,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (6,4) is listed as an internal obstacle. Cannot move here.\n   - Outcome: Illegal move.\n\nSo, possible legal moves are U and L.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if moving towards any food is possible and beneficial.\n\n1. **Food at (6,6)**:\n   - Current head at (5,4). To reach (6,6):\n     - One path: Right to (6,4) -> but (6,4) is a wall, so cannot go right first.\n     - Alternative: Up to (5,5), then right to (6,5), then up to (6,6).\n       - But food's life_span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So cannot reach it in time.\n   - Cannot eat this food.\n\n2. **Food at (1,5)**:\n   - Current head at (5,4). To reach (1,5):\n     - Need to go left multiple times, but food's life_span is 1, cannot reach in time.\n   - Cannot eat this food.\n\n3. **Food at (3,2)**:\n   - Current head at (5,4). To reach (3,2):\n     - Path: Left to (4,4), then left to (3,4) -> but (3,4) is an internal wall.\n     - Alternative: Down to (5,3) (but current direction is U, cannot go D immediately), or other paths are too long.\n   - Life_span is 10, but cannot reach in one move.\n   - Cannot eat this food immediately.\n\n### Checking for Food Under Snake's Body\n\nThe rules mention that food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n- Food positions: (6,6), (1,5), (3,2)\nNone of these are under the snake's body currently.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food:\n- Tail is at (1,3).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (0,3) [wall], (2,3) [body], (1,2), (1,4)\n- Head is at (5,4), not adjacent to tail (1,3).\n- No food at tail cell (1,3).\nNo danger here.\n\n### Decision Between U and L\n\nBoth U and L are safe moves with no immediate food to eat. We need to choose the move that keeps options open for future moves.\n\n- **Up (U) to (5,5)**:\n  - Next moves from (5,5): Cannot go D (reverse), so U, L, R.\n    - U to (5,6): Check (5,6) - not a wall, not body (body will have moved to (5,4), (5,3), etc.)\n    - L to (4,5): Not a wall, not body.\n    - R to (6,5): Not a wall, not body.\n  - Seems safe, keeps options open.\n\n- **Left (L) to (4,4)**:\n  - Next moves from (4,4): Cannot go R (reverse), so U, D, L.\n    - U to (4,5): Safe.\n    - D to (4,3): Currently body is at (5,3), (4,3), etc. After move, body will be (4,4), (5,3), etc., so (4,3) is not body (tail is at (1,3) moving to (2,3)). Wait, let's see:\n      - Current body: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n      - After L to (4,4), new body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) - tail (1,3) is gone.\n      - So (4,3) is now part of the body (from previous (4,3) moves to (3,3)), but (4,3) is now where the segment after (5,3) is, which is (4,3) is now the third segment.\n      - Wait, no: after moving head to (4,4), the body is:\n        - head: (4,4)\n        - then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n      - So (4,3) is part of the body, cannot move D to (4,3).\n    - L to (3,4): (3,4) is an internal wall.\n  - So from (4,4), possible next moves are U to (4,5) or D to (4,3) [but D is invalid as (4,3) is body], so only U.\n  - Less flexible.\n\nThus, moving U seems better as it keeps more options open for the next move.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food\n\nAll foods have life_span 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn. So even if we could reach them in multiple moves, they won't be there. Hence, no immediate food to eat.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween U and L, U is better as it allows more flexibility in the next move.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 26  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) excluding walls)\n- Internal obstacles: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)]  \nThis means:\n- Head at (5,5)\n- Body segments at (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n- Tail at (2,3)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: U (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (6,6) - value: 1, life_span: 4\n2. (1,5) - value: 1, life_span: 6\n3. (3,2) - value: 1, life_span: 9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,5) with direction U (Up), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5,6)\n- **Left (L)**: (4,5)\n- **Right (R)**: (6,5)\n\nWe cannot move Down (D) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (U), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (5,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is a wall, but (5,6) is not a wall (since y=7 is the border, y=6 is within bounds).\n  - Internal obstacles: Check if (5,6) is in the internal obstacles list. It's not.\n  - Body collision: The snake's body is at [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)]. (5,6) is not in this list.\n- Food at (5,6)? No, the foods are at (6,6), (1,5), (3,2).\n- So, moving Up is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (4,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (4,5) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (4,5) is not in the list.\n  - Body collision: (4,5) is not in the body segments.\n- Food at (4,5)? No.\n- Safe move, no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, (6,5) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (6,5) is not in the list (internal obstacles include (6,4), but not (6,5)).\n  - Body collision: (6,5) is not in the body segments.\n- Food at (6,5)? No, but there's food at (6,6), which is adjacent. Moving to (6,5) could set up to go to (6,6) next turn.\n- Safe move, no immediate food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nLet's look at the foods and see if any are reachable or beneficial to aim for:\n\n1. (6,6):\n   - Current head at (5,5). To reach (6,6), path could be Right to (6,5), then Up to (6,6).\n   - Life_span: 4 turns left. After this move (turn 26), it will be 3 turns left.\n   - Value: +1.\n\n2. (1,5):\n   - Far from current position (5,5). Would take several moves to reach.\n   - Life_span: 6 turns left.\n   - Value: +1.\n\n3. (3,2):\n   - Current head at (5,5). Path could be Left to (4,5), then Down to (4,4), then Left to (3,4) (but (3,4) is an obstacle), so need another path.\n   - Life_span: 9 turns left.\n   - Value: +1.\n\nThe most promising seems to be (6,6), as it's only two moves away and has enough life_span left.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis is a special case where if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (2,3). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\nAdjacent means one cell apart in any direction (including diagonally? The rules mention U/D/L/R moves, so likely Manhattan adjacency, i.e., up, down, left, right).\n\nHead at (5,5), tail at (2,3):\n- Distance in x: 5-2=3\n- Distance in y: 5-3=2\nTotal Manhattan distance is 5, which is more than 1, so not adjacent.\n\nThus, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven that moving Right to (6,5) sets us up to potentially eat (6,6) next turn, and both moves are safe, this seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternative is to move Up to (5,6), but then next move would have to be Left or Right to approach (6,6), which is less direct.\n\nMoving Left to (4,5) doesn't seem to lead directly to any food soon.\n\n### Verifying Safety of Moving Right to (6,5)\n\nLet's ensure that after moving to (6,5), the next move to (6,6) is safe:\n- Next head position after Right: (6,5)\n- Then move Up to (6,6):\n  - Check if (6,6) is safe:\n    - Not a wall.\n    - Not an internal obstacle.\n    - Body segments after moving Right to (6,5):\n      - New head: (6,5)\n      - Body: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n      - Tail was (2,3), which moves to (3,3) as the body shifts.\n    - (6,6) is not in [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)].\n    - Food at (6,6) is positive (+1), and eating it will grow the snake:\n      - New tail will be where the current tail is, which is (3,3), so new body will include (3,3).\n      - New head at (6,6), body: (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3).\n      - No immediate collision after eating.\n\nThus, moving Right now is safe and sets up for eating (6,6) next turn.\n\n### Checking Other Foods\n\nIs there a better immediate food to go for?\n\n(3,2):\n- To reach (3,2), need to go Left and Down, but there are obstacles in the way.\n- Path might be Left to (4,5), Down to (4,4), Left to (3,4) - but (3,4) is an obstacle.\n- Alternative path is longer and not straightforward.\n\n(1,5):\n- Far away, not immediately reachable without many moves.\n\nSo, (6,6) is the most accessible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right to (6,5), setting up to eat the positive food at (6,6) on the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the given information:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: It's an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these coordinates).\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: \n     - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions (head first)**: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]\n     - Head at (6,5), tail at (3,3).\n   - **Current Direction**: R (right, which is increasing x).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,6): value=3, life_span=1\n   - (1,5): value=5, life_span=1\n   - (3,2): value=8, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is R, the snake cannot instantly reverse to L (no instant reverse rule). So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (7,5)\n- New head position: (7,5)\n- Check walls:\n  - x=7 is a border wall → collision! This move is invalid.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (6,6)\n- New head position: (6,6)\n- Check walls:\n  - (6,6) is not a wall.\n- Check body collision:\n  - Snake body segments: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n  - (6,6) is not in the body → no collision.\n- Check food:\n  - (6,6) has food with value=3.\n  - Eating this food:\n    - Reward: +3\n    - Length increases by 1.\n    - New snake: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]\n    - Check Tail Reward Danger:\n      - Tail is at (3,3), next to head (6,6)? \n      - Adjacent means sharing an edge (up, down, left, right). \n      - Distance between (6,6) and (3,3) is |6-3| + |6-3| = 6, which is more than 1 → not adjacent.\n      - So, no danger from tail.\n- This move is valid and beneficial.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (6,4)\n- New head position: (6,4)\n- Check walls:\n  - Internal obstacle at (6,4) → collision! This move is invalid.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nAre there other foods to consider?\n\n- (1,5): value=5, but it's at (1,5). Current head is at (6,5). To reach (1,5), the snake would need to move left multiple times, but currently, moving left is not allowed (current direction is R, and instant reverse is not allowed). So, not immediately reachable.\n  \n- (3,2): value=8, at (3,2). Current head at (6,5). Distance is significant, not immediately reachable in one move.\n\n### Decision\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- R: invalid (wall)\n- D: invalid (wall)\n- U: valid, eats positive food (+3), no danger.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger Again\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm the tail reward danger when moving U to (6,6):\n- Current tail is at (3,3).\n- After eating, new tail is at (3,3) (since length increases by 1, the last segment stays).\n- Head moves to (6,6), which is not adjacent to (3,3).\n- So, no collision risk from tail.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U) to eat the positive food at (6,6).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   \n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. This means the snake cannot move outside the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are additional walls at the following coordinates:\n     - (3, 1), (2, 4), (1, 1), (1, 6), (6, 4), (3, 4), (2, 2), (3, 6)\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body segments are at:\n     - Head: (6, 6)\n     - Body: (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving \"Up\" (U), meaning its last move was in the positive y-direction.\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three food items on the grid:\n     1. (1, 5): value = 1, life_span = 4\n     2. (3, 2): value = 1, life_span = 7\n     3. (5, 5): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the snake is currently moving Up (U), it cannot move Down (D) in the next turn.\n   - Allowed moves: U, L, R\n\n2. **Wall Collisions**: The snake cannot move into a cell occupied by a wall.\n   - Current head position: (6, 6)\n   - Possible moves from (6, 6):\n     - U: (6, 7) → y=7 is a border wall → Invalid\n     - D: (6, 5) → But D is reverse direction → Already invalid due to no instant reverse\n     - L: (5, 6) → Need to check if this is a wall\n       - (5,6) is not listed as a wall (internal or border) → Valid\n     - R: (7, 6) → x=7 is a border wall → Invalid\n\n   So, from the initial possible moves (U, L, R), only L is valid after considering walls and no reverse.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the walls:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n- Internal walls: The given list does not include (5,6), so L to (5,6) is valid.\n\nBut wait, the snake's body is at (6,5), (5,5), etc. Moving left to (5,6) would not collide with the body immediately, but we need to check if this move would lead to a collision with the body in the next steps.\n\n### Checking for Body Collisions\n\nAfter moving left to (5,6), the new head position is (5,6). The current body segments are:\n- (6,6) → will become the first body segment\n- (6,5)\n- (5,5)\n- (5,4)\n- (5,3)\n- (4,3)\n- (3,3)\n\nThe tail (last segment) is at (3,3), which will move forward to (4,3) (since the segment before it is (4,3), but actually, the tail movement is such that the entire body follows the head, so the new body would be:\n- Head: (5,6)\n- Body: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)\n\n(3,3) is no longer part of the snake after the move.\n\nIs (5,6) in the new body? No, the body segments after moving are (6,6), (6,5), etc., not (5,6). So no immediate collision.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving left to (5,6) leads to eating any food:\n- Food positions:\n  - (1,5): far away\n  - (3,2): far away\n  - (5,5): currently under the snake's body at (5,5)\n\nCan we eat (5,5)? The rules state:\n- Food under the body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away, and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, (5,5) is occupied by the snake's body. If we move left to (5,6), the body at (5,5) will move to (6,5), so (5,5) is no longer occupied by the snake. Then, to eat (5,5), the head would need to move onto it in the next turn. But currently, moving left doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Alternative Moves\n\nWait a minute, initially I thought only Left is possible, but let's re-examine the possible moves from (6,6):\n\nCurrent direction: U\nCannot move D (reverse)\nCan move U, L, R\n\nU: (6,7) → y=7 is wall → invalid\nL: (5,6) → valid\nR: (7,6) → x=7 is wall → invalid\n\nSo only L is valid. But is there any other possibility?\n\nIs the snake allowed to stay in place? The rules say \"move 1 cell/turn\", so staying is not an option.\n\nThus, the only possible move is Left to (5,6).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could be dangerous?\n\nTail is at (3,3). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), (4,3)\n\nFood at (3,2) is adjacent to tail. It's positive (value=1). If the head were adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it would kill the snake because the head and newly grown tail would collide.\n\nBut currently, the head is at (6,6), tail at (3,3), not adjacent. So this isn't a concern now.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities:\n\n- Only valid move is Left (L) to (5,6).\n- This move doesn't lead to any immediate collisions.\n- It doesn't eat any food this turn.\n- There are no immediate dangers from tail reward.\n\nTherefore, the immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 29  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: \n  - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \n- Head: (5,6)\n- Body: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)]\n  \nSo, the snake's body segments are in order from head to tail.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nThis means the snake was moving left in the previous turn, so it cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) in the next move.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (1,5): value=3, life_span=1\n2. (3,2): value=6, life_span=1\n3. (5,5): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (5,6), the possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (5,7)\n- Down (D): (5,5)\n- Left (L): (4,6)\n- Right (R): (6,6)\n\nBut since the current direction is Left (L), we cannot move Right (R) next (no instant reverse). So possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's check each:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (5,7)**:\n   - Check walls: y=7 is a border wall, so (5,7) is a wall. Can't move there.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (5,5)**:\n   - Check walls: (5,5) is not a wall.\n   - Check snake body: The snake's body segments are [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)].\n     - (5,5) is the 4th segment (counting from head as 0: head is (5,6), then (6,6)=1, (6,5)=2, (5,5)=3).\n     - Normally, moving into a body segment is deadly, but there's an exception: if it's the tail segment, and the tail moves away, it's safe.\n     - The tail is at (4,3), so (5,5) is not the tail. It's the segment before the tail's path.\n     - Actually, let's see the body sequence: head at (5,6), next is (6,6), then (6,5), then (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3).\n     - Moving to (5,5) would mean the head goes to where the 3rd body segment is, and that's not the tail. So this would cause a collision.\n   - Also, there's food at (5,5) with value=9.\n     - But eating it would mean the snake grows, and the new tail would be where the current tail is (since length increases by 1).\n     - The current tail is at (4,3), and the segment before is (5,3). After moving to (5,5), the new body would be [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)].\n     - Wait, no: original body is [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)].\n     - Moving to (5,5) without eating: head to (5,5), then body shifts: [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] - tail (4,3) is gone.\n     - But if we eat at (5,5), length increases by 1, so tail stays at (4,3), and new body is [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)].\n     - Now, the head is at (5,5), and the segment after is (5,6), which is where the head was. The next segment is (6,6), etc.\n     - The issue is that after moving to (5,5), the next segment is (5,6), which is adjacent to the head's new position (5,5). So the head is adjacent to the body segment (5,6), which is not the tail.\n     - But the rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\" says: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n     - Here, the tail is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to (5,5). So this rule doesn't apply.\n     - However, moving to (5,5) would place the head where the body segment (5,5) was, which is not the tail, so it's a collision.\n   - **Conclusion**: Moving to (5,5) causes a collision with the body, even if we eat the food. So it's deadly.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n3. **Left (L) to (4,6)**:\n   - Check walls: (4,6) is not listed as a wall.\n     - Border walls are x=0,7 and y=0,7. (4,6) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is a wall, but (4,6) is not listed.\n   - Check snake body: Is (4,6) in the body?\n     - Body segments: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3). (4,6) is not in the body.\n   - Check food: Is there food at (4,6)? No, food is at (1,5), (3,2), (5,5).\n   - So moving left is safe.\n   - **Valid move**.\n\n4. **Right (R) to (6,6)**:\n   - But current direction is Left (L), so cannot move Right (R) next (no instant reverse).\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n### Available Valid Moves\n\nFrom the above, the only valid move is Left (L) to (4,6).\n\n### Checking for Better Options\n\nIs there any other consideration? Maybe the food is tempting, but moving to (5,5) is deadly as we saw. The other foods are at (1,5) and (3,2), which are far and not reachable immediately. \n\nThe food at (5,5) is high value (9), but eating it is deadly as it causes a collision. The other foods have lower values (3 and 6), but they are not adjacent, so we can't reach them in this move.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe only safe move is Left (L) to (4,6). \n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers After Move\n\nAfter moving to (4,6):\n- New head: (4,6)\n- New body: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n   - (The tail (4,3) is removed since length doesn't increase unless we eat food, and we're not eating here.)\n- Check for adjacent dangers:\n   - Adjacent to (4,6): (4,7), (4,5), (3,6), (5,6)\n     - (4,7): y=7 is wall.\n     - (4,5): not in body.\n     - (3,6): is a wall (internal obstacle).\n     - (5,6): is the next body segment.\n   - So in the next move, we'd have to avoid moving into (5,6) (body) or (3,6) (wall), and y=7 is wall. So possible moves would be Down to (4,5) or Left to (3,6) (but that's a wall), so only Down is possible next. But that's for future planning.\n\nFor now, Left is safe.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "score": 5,
        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n#### Grid Dimensions and Walls\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- **Border walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n- **Internal obstacles**: \n  - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n\n#### Snake\n- **Positions (head first)**: \n  - Head: (4,6)\n  - Body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)\n- **Current direction**: L (Left, meaning the head is moving towards decreasing x)\n\n#### Food Items\nEach food item is represented as (x, y, life_span, value):\n1. (1, 5, 2, 1) - Positive food at (1,5), life span 2, value +1\n2. (3, 2, 5, 1) - Positive food at (3,2), life span 5, value +1\n3. (5, 5, 8, 1) - Positive food at (5,5), life span 8, value +1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot immediately move Right (R) on the next turn.\n  \nSo, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\n#### Current Head Position: (4,6)\nPossible moves from (4,6):\n1. **Left (L)**: (3,6)\n   - Check if (3,6) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=3 is not a border wall, and (3,6) is not listed as an internal obstacle.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: The body segments are at (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3). (3,6) is not in this list.\n     - So, (3,6) is a valid move.\n2. **Up (U)**: (4,7)\n   - Check if (4,7) is valid:\n     - y=7 is a border wall → Invalid (wall collision).\n3. **Down (D)**: (4,5)\n   - Check if (4,5) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: y=5 is not a border wall, and (4,5) is not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: (4,5) is not in the body list.\n     - So, (4,5) is a valid move.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: L to (3,6) or D to (4,5).\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the current head position (4,6):\n\nAdjacent cells to (4,6):\n- Left (L): (3,6) - No food here (checking food positions: (1,5), (3,2), (5,5))\n- Down (D): (4,5) - No food here\n- Up (U): (4,7) - Wall, no food\n- Right (R): (5,6) - Part of the snake's body (second segment), but no food here\n\nNone of the immediate adjacent cells have food. However, there is food at:\n1. (1,5): Distance from (4,6) is |4-1| + |6-5| = 3 + 1 = 4\n2. (3,2): Distance from (4,6) is |4-3| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5\n3. (5,5): Distance from (4,6) is |4-5| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThe closest food is at (5,5), which is 2 units away. \n\nBut (5,5) is currently under the snake's body (it's the 4th segment in the body list: (5,5)). \n\n**Special Case for Food Under Body**:\n- Food under the body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away from that cell, and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, the food at (5,5) is under the snake's body. To eat it:\n- The body must move away from (5,5), meaning the tail must move forward.\n- Then, the head must move to (5,5).\n\nBut currently, the head is at (4,6). To reach (5,5) from (4,6):\n- Possible path: Right (R) to (5,6), then Down (D) to (5,5).\nBut we cannot move Right (R) now because the current direction is Left (L), and instant reverse is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, another path could be Down (D) to (4,5), then Right (R) to (5,5). But this would take two moves, and by then the body may or may not have moved away from (5,5).\n\nGiven that the tail is at (5,3), and the body is [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)], the next move will:\n- Move head to new position.\n- The tail (5,3) will move forward, meaning the segment before it (5,4) will become the new tail, and (5,3) will be removed.\n\nBut (5,5) is part of the body, and the segment after it is (5,4). So, unless the tail is at (5,5), the body won't immediately move away from (5,5) in one move.\n\nGiven that, it's not immediately possible to eat the food at (5,5) in the next move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a rule about **Tail Reward Danger**:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,3). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (4,3), (6,3), (5,2), (5,4)\nHead is at (4,6), which is not adjacent to (5,3). So, no immediate danger here.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,6) or D to (4,5).\n\nLet's evaluate both:\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (3,6)**:\n   - New head position: (3,6)\n   - New body: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4)] (tail (5,3) is removed)\n   - Check for food at (3,6): No.\n   - Next possible moves from (3,6): \n     - Current direction would be L, so cannot move R.\n     - Possible: U, D, L.\n     - U to (3,7): y=7 is wall → invalid.\n     - D to (3,5): Check if valid:\n       - Not a wall: (3,5) is not a border or internal obstacle.\n       - Not in new body: (3,5) is not in [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4)] → valid.\n     - L to (2,6): Check if valid:\n       - Not a wall: (2,6) is not a border or internal obstacle.\n       - Not in new body → valid.\n   - This move doesn't lead to immediate food but keeps options open.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (4,5)**:\n   - New head position: (4,5)\n   - New body: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4)] (tail (5,3) is removed)\n   - Check for food at (4,5): No.\n   - Next possible moves from (4,5):\n     - Current direction would be D, so cannot move U.\n     - Possible: D, L, R.\n     - D to (4,4): Check if valid:\n       - Not a wall: (4,4) is not a border or internal obstacle.\n       - Not in new body: (4,4) is not in [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4)] → valid.\n     - L to (3,5): Valid.\n     - R to (5,5): \n       - (5,5) is in the new body (last segment is (5,4), but (5,5) is the 6th segment in new body) → collision with body → invalid.\n   - This move also doesn't lead to immediate food but positions the snake differently.\n\nBetween these two, moving Left seems slightly better because it moves the snake towards the left side where there's food at (3,2) and (1,5), albeit not immediately accessible. Moving Down keeps the snake in a more central position but doesn't provide a clear advantage.\n\n### Considering Food Life Spans\n\nFood life spans:\n1. (1,5): life_span = 2 (will disappear after 2 more turns, including current)\n2. (3,2): life_span = 5\n3. (5,5): life_span = 8\n\nThe food at (1,5) is about to disappear soon (in 2 turns), so it's less likely we can reach it in time from (4,6) in just 2 moves.\n\nThe food at (3,2) has a longer life span, and moving Left could be a step towards reaching it in future moves.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nWe should also ensure that the move doesn't lead the snake into a position where it might get trapped.\n\nAfter moving Left to (3,6):\n- Next possible moves: D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n- (3,5) is safe, and (2,6) is also safe (no immediate walls or obstacles).\n\nAfter moving Down to (4,5):\n- Next possible moves: D to (4,4) or L to (3,5).\n- Both seem safe, but moving Down might limit future options more than moving Left.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis, moving Left seems the better option as it:\n- Keeps more future options open.\n- Moves towards food with longer life spans.\n- Doesn't immediately risk collision or trapping.\n\n\\boxed{L}",
