        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t1=0, and I need to get to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical position y ranges from 0 to 9, so I need to move up from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe player moves each turn: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), or S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay within 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars with positions given at turn t1=0. Cars move left or right with a certain speed.\n\nFor collision: if at turn T, the player is at some y-coordinate, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at turn T, then collision occurs. Importantly, when you move, you are not on the new freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T, you are on freeway y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, at turn T you are still on y_T, so you only check cars on y_T for collision at turn T. When you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, for the player's y_T, if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at that turn T.\n\nThe span is given for each car at turn t1, and then for future turns, it moves based on direction and speed.\n\nLet me list all the cars at turn t=0.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, the span at t=0 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? No.\n\nThe notation: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h].\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nh = -48, τ = -59, d = right, s = 3\n\nSince right-moving, span at t1=0 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt turn T, span is [τ + s(T-0), h + s(T-0)] = [-59 + 3T, -48 + 3T]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, player is at y_T, and for that freeway, if 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\n0 is the x-coordinate where the player is; the player is always at x=0, I think, since it's (0, y), so we care about when cars cover x=0.\n\nSo for a car, at turn T, if min_span <= 0 <= max_span, then collision if player is on that freeway.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: car span at T: [-59 + 3T, -48 + 3T]\n\n0 is in this if -59 + 3T <= 0 <= -48 + 3T\n\nBut -59 + 3T <= 0 implies 3T <= 59, T <= 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so T <= 19\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 + 3T implies 48 <= 3T, T >= 16\n\nSo for T from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 is in the span for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-48, -59, right, 3), so same span, collision at T=16 to 19.\n\nFreeway 3: also same, (-48, -59, right, 3), collision T=16 to 19.\n\nNow freeway 4: has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nRight-moving, span at T: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-59 + 4T, -48 + 4T]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 4T <= 0 <= -48 + 4T\n\n-59 + 4T <= 0 => 4T <= 59 => T <= 14.75, so T <= 14\n\n0 <= -48 + 4T => 48 <= 4T => T >= 12\n\nSo T from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (-12, -23, right, 4)\n\nh=-12, τ=-23, right, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [-23 + 4T, -12 + 4T]\n\n0 in: -23 + 4T <= 0 <= -12 + 4T\n\n-23 + 4T <= 0 => 4T <= 23 => T <= 5.75, T <= 5\n\n0 <= -12 + 4T => 12 <= 4T => T >= 3\n\nSo T=3,4,5\n\nThird car on freeway 4: (24, 13, right, 4)? Head h=24, tail τ=13? That seems odd, because if right-moving, span should be [τ, h], but τ=13, h=24, so [13,24] at t=0.\n\nDirection right, so span at T: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [13 + 4T, 24 + 4T]\n\nSince s=4.\n\nNow, 0 in [13+4T, 24+4T]? 13+4T <= 0 <= 24+4T\n\nBut 13+4T <=0 only if T negative, since T>=0, 13+4T >=13>0, so 0 is never <= 13+4T when T>=0. Similarly, 24+4T >0 always. So min is 13+4T >=13>0, so 0 is never in this span. So this car never covers x=0.\n\nSo for freeway 4, collisions possible from first car T=12,13,14 and second car T=3,4,5.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSpan at T: [-59 + 12T, -48 + 12T]\n\n0 in: -59 + 12T <= 0 <= -48 + 12T\n\n-59 + 12T <=0 => 12T <=59 => T <= 59/12 ≈4.916, T<=4\n\n0 <= -48 +12T => 48 <=12T => T>=4\n\nSo T=4 only? T>=4 and T<=4, so T=4.\n\n-59+12T <=0 for T<=4.916, so T<=4 since T integer? T is turn, integer.\n\nT<= floor(59/12)=4 since 12*4=48<59, 12*5=60>59? -59+12T <=0 when 12T <=59, T<=59/12=4.916, so T<=4 for integer T? Let's compute:\n\nT=4: -59 + 12*4 = -59+48= -11 <=0? Yes, -11<=0\n\n0 <= -48 + 48 = 0, yes 0<=0, so 0 is included.\n\nT=5: -59 +60=1 >0? -59+60=1, which is >0, so min span is 1>0, so 0 not <= min, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 +12T, T=4: -48+48=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nT=3: -48+36=-12<0, 0 <= -12? False, so not >= min? Condition is min <=0<= max.\n\nFor T=4: min=-59+48=-11 <=0, max=-48+48=0, so -11<=0<=0 true.\n\nT=5: min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, 1<=0? 1<=0 false, so 0 not >= min, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly, T<4: T=3, min=-59+36=-23 <=0, max=-48+36=-12, 0 <= -12? False, since -12<0.\n\nSo only T=4 for first car.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nh=0, τ=-11, right, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-11 + 12T, 0 + 12T] = [-11 + 12T, 12T]\n\n0 in span: min <=0<= max\n\nmin = -11+12T <=0, which is true for T>=1 since -11+12=1>0? T=0: min=-11+0=-11<=0, max=0, so -11<=0<=0 true? At T=0, min=-11, max=0, so -11<=0<=0 true, 0 is included.\n\nBut we are at turn T, and player position is at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, for freeway y, if player is on it.\n\nBut at turn t1=0, we are starting, and cars are given at t1=0.\n\nFor this car, at T=0, span is [-11, 0], so min=-11, max=0, so 0 is in [min,max], since min<=0 and 0<=max.\n\nSimilarly, for T=1: span [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nT=0: min=-11<=0, max=0, 0<=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nT=1: min=1, max=12, 1<=0 false, 0 not in.\n\nT=2: min=13, etc, all larger.\n\nSo for second car on freeway 5, at T=0, 0 is in span.\n\nBut at turn t1=0, player is at y=0, which is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 is the bottom, I think no cars, and y=9 is top, no cars.\n\nThe player starts at (0,0), which is y=0, and needs to reach (0,9).\n\nFreeways with cars are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision there.\n\nAt turn T, if player is at y_T, and y_T is between 1 and 8, then we need to check if there is a car on that freeway at turn T with 0 in span.\n\nIf y_T =0 or 9, no cars, so always safe.\n\nNow back to freeway 5.\n\nFirst car: only collision at T=4.\n\nSecond car: at T=0, 0 in span.\n\nBut at turn T, we care when player is on freeway 5.\n\nNow for freeway 6,7,8: same as freeway 5? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48, -59, right, 12), same as freeway 5 first car? And (0, -11, right, 12), same as second car.\n\nFreeway 6: \"(-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\" same as freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7 and 8 same.\n\nIn the table:\n\nFreeway 5: (-48, -59, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nAll freeways 5,6,7,8 have identical cars: one with large negative, speed 12, collision only at T=4 for that one, and one with (0,-11,right,12), which at T=0 has 0 in span.\n\nNow for the (0,-11,right,12) car, at T=0, span is [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nBut for freeway, when is it dangerous.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at turn 0.\n\nI need to move to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nSince y must be integer, and we start at 0, end at 9, minimum turns if we go straight up is 9 turns: U,U,U,...U, 9 times, to y=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions when on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAlso, we can stay or move down, but that might take more turns, so we want minimal H, so probably go up as much as possible, but avoid the times when cars are at x=0.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway, the turns when it is dangerous, i.e., when there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, cars: only one, collision at T=16,17,18,19\n\nFrom earlier: T=16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2: same, T=16-19\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=16-19\n\nFreeway 4: y=4\n\nCars:\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) collision at T=12,13,14\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4) collision at T=3,4,5\n\nThird car: no collision\n\nSo dangerous turns: T=3,4,5 from second car, and T=12,13,14 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 5: y=5\n\nCars:\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) collision at T=4 only\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) at T=0, but T=0 is now, and at T=0, player is at y=0, not on freeway 5, so for freeway 5, collision when player is on y=5 at a turn when 0 in span.\n\nFor second car, at T=0, span has 0, but if player is on freeway 5 at T=0, but player is at y=0 at T=0, not on y=5, so no issue. The dangerous turns are when player is on the freeway at that turn.\n\nFor freeway 5, second car: at T=0, 0 in span, but if player were on y=5 at T=0, collision, but player is not, so for future, when is 0 in span for this car?\n\nAt T=0, min=-11, max=0, 0 in.\n\nT=1: min=1, max=12, min=1>0, so 0 not <= min? min=1, 0<1, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, only at T=0 it has 0, but T=0 is past? We start from T=0, but at T=0, player position is given, and we begin actions from turn t1=0.\n\nThe sequence of actions starts from t=0.\n\nAt turn T, before action or after? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action a_t.\n\nAt turn t, we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut for collision, it says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at position (0, y_T), and we check if on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8), if there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThe action a_t is chosen at turn t, affecting y_{t+1}.\n\nFor turn T, we have y_T defined, and we check collision based on that.\n\nAt the start, turn t1=0, player is at (0,0), y_0=0.\n\nWe choose action a_0, then y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0, and so on.\n\nFor collision at turn T: when we are at y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, 0 in some car's span at T.\n\nFor freeway 5, second car, at T=0, 0 in span, but at T=0, y_0=0, not on freeway 5, so no collision. At other turns, for T>0, the span is [ -11 +12T, 12T ], which for T>=1, min >=1>0, so 0 not in span, so this car never causes collision for T>=1.\n\nSimilarly, for first car on freeway 5, only at T=4, 0 in span.\n\nSo for freeway 5, dangerous only at T=4.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8, same cars, so dangerous at T=4.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as 5, dangerous at T=4.\n\nSimilarly 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 4: dangerous at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14.\n\nBut T=12-14 might be late, since we want minimal turns, probably we finish before that.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1,2,3 dangerous at T=16-19, which is even later.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0, turn 0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach U move increases y by 1, so minimum 9 moves if all U.\n\nBut we have to go through y=1 to 8, each at some turn.\n\nLet T_y be the turn when player is at y-coordinate y.\n\nSince we start at y=0, T=0.\n\nThen after actions, we reach y=1 at some turn, etc.\n\nThe time to go from y to y+1 can be more than one turn if we stay or move down, but to minimize time, we should go up as fast as possible, except when we need to avoid collision.\n\nSo let's find for each y from 1 to 8, when it is safe to be there.\n\nThat is, for each freeway y, the turns when it is not dangerous.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): dangerous T=16,17,18,19. So safe for T not in {16,17,18,19}, but since we start from T=0 and go to small T, probably T<16 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 same.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): dangerous T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14. So safe for T not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, e.g., T<=2 or T=6 to 11 or T>=15, but again, we want small T.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): dangerous only at T=4. So safe for T !=4.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): same, dangerous T=4, safe T!=4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7 and 8: dangerous T=4, safe T!=4.\n\nNow, since freeways 5,6,7,8 all have danger only at T=4, so we must not be on any of y=5,6,7,8 at turn T=4.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4, dangerous at T=3,4,5.\n\nBut T=4 is dangerous for y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 from y=0 in min turns.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0.\n\nAfter first action, at T=1, y could be 0 or 1, depending on a_0.\n\nIf a_0=U, y_1=1; if S, y_1=0; if D, y_1=-1, but y must be >=0, so D not possible from y=0, since y_{t+1} >=0.\n\nSimilarly, from y=9, cannot go up.\n\nBut here start from 0.\n\nSo possible actions: from y=0, a_t can be U or S, not D.\n\nSimilarly, to y=9, we can use S or D to stay or decrease, but since we want min time, probably only U until 9.\n\nBut we may need to wait or something.\n\nNow, the critical point is T=4, which is dangerous for y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe must not be on these y at T=4.\n\nSince we start at T=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe turns are small, let's think about the sequence.\n\nSuppose we go up as fast as possible: a_t = U for t=0 to 8, then at T=0, y=0; T=1, y=1; T=2, y=2; T=3, y=3; T=4, y=4; T=5, y=5; T=6, y=6; T=7, y=7; T=8, y=8; T=9, y=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt T=1, y=1, freeway 1. Is it dangerous? Freeway 1 dangerous at T=16-19, T=1<16, so safe.\n\nSimilarly T=2, y=2, freeway 2, safe since T=2<16.\n\nT=3, y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nT=4, y=4, freeway 4. Now freeway 4 dangerous at T=3,4,5. T=4 is dangerous! Because at T=4, for freeway 4, second car is dangerous? Freeway 4 has danger at T=3,4,5 from the cars.\n\nAt T=4, first car: for y=4, freeway 4, at T=4.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) at T=4, span [-59+16, -48+16] = [-43, -32]? s=4, T=4, [-59 + 4*4, -48 + 4*4] = [-59+16, -48+16] = [-43, -32], min=-43, max=-32, both negative, 0 not in between since -43<=0<=-32 false because 0 > -32? 0 <= -32? No, -32 <0, so min=-43<=0 true, but max=-32 <0, so 0 <= max false, 0 not <= -32, so not in span. min <=0 and 0<= max both must hold.\n\nmin <=0 is true, but 0 <= max: max=-32, 0 <= -32? False, so 0 not in [-43,-32].\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4) at T=4, span [-23 +16, -12+16] = [-7, 4]? -23+16=-7, -12+16=4, so [-7,4], min=-7<=0<=4 true, so 0 in span, yes dangerous.\n\nThird car no.\n\nSo at T=4, freeway 4 has car with 0 in span, so if player on y=4 at T=4, collision.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=4, y=4, so collision.\n\nAlso, at T=5, y=5, freeway 5. Freeway 5 dangerous at T=4, but T=5 is not T=4, so for T=5, freeway 5: first car at T=5, span [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in. Second car at T=5, span [-11+60, 60]=[49,60], min=49>0, 0 not in. So safe at T=5 for y=5? But at T=4, y=5 not present.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=5, y=5, freeway 5, no car at T=5 has 0 in span, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=6, y=6, freeway 6, dangerous only at T=4, T=6!=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly T=7,8,9 all safe since y=7,8,9: y=9 no freeway, y=7 and 8 dangerous only at T=4, not here.\n\nBut problem at T=4, y=4 collision.\n\nSo need to avoid being on y=4 at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=5,6,7,8 at T=4.\n\nIn the direct path, at T=4 we are on y=4, which is bad.\n\nWe need to be at a different y at T=4.\n\nPossible y at T=4: since we start at T=0 y=0.\n\nAfter 4 actions, y_4 can be from 0 to 4, since we can only increase slowly.\n\ny_0=0\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0, Δy in {-1,0,1}, but y_0=0, so Δy_0 can be 0 or 1, not -1, so y_1 =0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, from y_1, y_2 can be y_1-1, y_1, or y_1+1, but y>=0.\n\nSo after t turns, y_t can be from 0 to t.\n\nAt T=4, y_4 can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, we must not be on y=4,5,6,7,8 at T=4, but y=5,6,7,8 cannot be reached at T=4 since max y=4 at T=4, so only possible to be on y=0,1,2,3,4 at T=4.\n\nBut y=4 is dangerous because of freeway 4 at T=4.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 not possible at T=4.\n\nSo we must not be on y=4 at T=4.\n\nTherefore, at T=4, we must be on y<=3 or y=0,1,2,3.\n\ny=0,1,2,3 are safe at T=4.\n\ny=0: no freeway, safe.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, dangerous only at T=16-19, T=4<16, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2 and y=3 safe.\n\ny=4 dangerous at T=4.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nIn the direct path, we are at y=4 at T=4, which is bad.\n\nSo we need to delay or something.\n\nFor example, we can stay at some point.\n\nSince freeway 4 is also dangerous at T=3 and T=5, but at T=3 and T=5, if we are on y=4, also dangerous.\n\nBut we might not be on y=4 at those times.\n\nAt T=4, we must be below y=4, say y=3.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nLet me define the turn when we reach each y.\n\nSince min time, we want to go up as fast as possible except when we hit danger.\n\nThe danger zone is around T=4 for multiple y.\n\nSpecifically, at T=4, we need to avoid y=4.\n\nAlso, for y=5,6,7,8, we must avoid being there at T=4, but since we can't be there at T=4, it's automatic.\n\nNow, freeway 4 is also dangerous at T=3 and T=5.\n\nIn the sequence, if we are on y=4 at T=3 or T=5, it might be dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have dangers at other times, but far away.\n\nNow, let's plan a path.\n\nStart T=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to choose actions.\n\nSuppose at T=0, we do S, stay, so y_1=0 at T=1? No.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at T=0, we are at y_0=0.\n\nChoose a_0:\n\nIf a_0 = S, then y_1 = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nIf a_0 = U, y_1 = 0 +1 =1\n\nNow, similarly.\n\nWe want to not be at y=4 at T=4.\n\nT=4 is after 4 actions? Let's clarify timing.\n\nTurn: at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nFor T from 0 to H-1, actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn H, y_H.\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn T for T=0 to H-1.\n\nAt each turn, we have y_T.\n\nFor collision at that turn.\n\nIn the min path, H=9, but we have problem at T=4.\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nOne way is to be at lower y at T=4.\n\nFor example, at T=4, be at y=3.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut we need to see if we can reach y=3 by T=4 without issue.\n\nFrom start:\n\nT=0, y=0\n\nSuppose we go up slowly.\n\nFor example:\n\na_0 = U, then y_1 =1 at T=1\n\nAt T=1, y=1, freeway 1, safe since T=1<16.\n\na_1 = U, y_2=2 at T=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\na_2 = U, y_3=3 at T=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nNow at T=3, y=3.\n\nNow, if we do a_3 = U, y_4=4 at T=4, but at T=4, y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo we cannot do U at T=3.\n\nInstead, we can do S or D.\n\nIf a_3 = S, then y_4=3 at T=4.\n\nNow at T=4, y=4? y_4=3, so position at turn T=4 is y=3.\n\nFreeway 3, which is safe at T=4, since danger only at T=16-19.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut at T=3, we are at y=3, which is safe.\n\nNow, after that, we need to go to y=4, but freeway 4 is dangerous at T=3,4,5.\n\nAt T=3, if we were on y=4, dangerous, but we are on y=3.\n\nAt T=4, we are on y=3.\n\nNow, at T=4, we choose action a_4.\n\nIf we go up, a_4=U, then y_5=4 at T=5.\n\nNow at T=5, y=5? y_5=4, position at turn T=5 is y=4.\n\nNow, freeway 4 at T=5: is it dangerous?\n\nFreeway 4 dangerous at T=3,4,5.\n\nAt T=5: first car, s=4, span [-59+20, -48+20]? T=5, [-59 + 4*5, -48 +4*5] = [-59+20, -48+20] = [-39, -28], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,4) at T=5, span [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8], min=-3<=0<=8 true, so 0 in span, dangerous.\n\nSo at T=5, if on y=4, collision.\n\nTherefore, if we go to y=4 at T=5, we have collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf we stay at y=3 longer.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother idea: go up faster at beginning or slower.\n\nSince freeway 4 is dangerous at T=3,4,5, we need to be on y=4 at a different time.\n\nFor example, be on y=4 at T=2 or T=6, etc.\n\nBut at T=2, can we be on y=4? y_2, after two actions from y=0.\n\ny_0=0, after a_0 and a_1, y_2 = y_0 + Δy_0 + Δy_1.\n\nSince y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0, then y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1.\n\nMax y_2: if a_0=U, y_1=1; a_1=U, y_2=2.\n\nCannot be y=4 at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, min y_2=0 if both S or one U one D but from y=0, cannot D, so y_2 >=0, at most 2.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, we can be at y=6 or higher.\n\nBut let's list possible (turn, y) when we can be.\n\nSince we start at T=0 y=0, and we move, the earliest to reach y=k is at turn k, by all U.\n\nLatest, but we want min time.\n\nBut to avoid danger, we might need to take more turns.\n\nNow, for freeway 4, to be safe, we need to be on y=4 at T not in {3,4,5}, so T<=2 or T>=6.\n\nBut at T<=2, max y=2, so cannot be on y=4 at T<=2.\n\nTherefore, only possibility is to be on y=4 at T>=6.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but they have less restriction.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 dangerous only at T=4, so as long as not on y=5 at T=4, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nWe need to reach y=4 at some T>=6.\n\nSince we start from y=0, we need to get to y=4 late.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should go up to y=3 quickly, then wait, then go to y=4 after T=5.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nSimilarly for higher y.\n\nNow, let's plan.\n\nStart T=0, y=0.\n\na_0 = U, to y_1=1 at T=1 (safe, freeway 1 ok)\n\na_1 = U, to y_2=2 at T=2 (safe)\n\nNow at T=2, y=2.\n\nWe want to delay going to y=3, because if we go to y=3 at T=3, then from y=3 we can go to y=4 only at T=4 or later, but T=4 and T=5 are dangerous for y=4.\n\nIf we go to y=3 at T=2? At T=2, y=2.\n\nIf a_2 = U, to y_3=3 at T=3.\n\nBut at T=3, if we stay or something.\n\nFrom T=2, y=2, we can do S or D or U.\n\nIf a_2 = S, then y_3=2 at T=3.\n\nThen at T=3, y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nThen we can go up later.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTo reach y=4 at T>=6.\n\nFirst, go to y=3 as fast as possible, but not too fast.\n\nEarliest to y=3 is T=3 with all U.\n\nBut if we are at y=3 at T=3, we can stay there for some turns to avoid going to y=4 during danger.\n\nDanger for y=4 is T=3,4,5, so we need to be on y=4 at T<=2 or T>=6, but T<=2 impossible, so T>=6.\n\nSo we should not leave y=3 until after T=5, so that we reach y=4 at T=6 or later.\n\nSimilarly, for higher y, since freeway 5,6,7,8 dangerous only at T=4, if we are not on them at T=4, it's fine.\n\nNow, min time: we need to be at y=3 for some turns.\n\nStart:\n\nT=0, y=0\n\na_0 = U: y_1 =1 at T=1\n\na_1 = U: y_2 =2 at T=2\n\nNow at T=2, y=2\n\nWe need to go to y=3.\n\nIf a_2 = U, y_3=3 at T=3\n\nNow at T=3, y=3, safe.\n\nWe must not go to y=4 until after T=5.\n\nSo at T=3, we can do S or D.\n\nIf a_3 = S, then y_4=3 at T=4\n\nAt T=4, y=3, freeway 3, safe (T=4<16)\n\nThen at T=4, we can still not go up, because if we go up at T=4, y_5=4 at T=5, but T=5 is dangerous for y=4.\n\nSo we need to stay at y=3 longer.\n\nAt T=4, y=3, we do S again: a_4 = S, then y_5=3 at T=5\n\nAt T=5, y=3, safe.\n\nNow danger for y=4 at T=5, but we are not on y=4 yet.\n\nAt T=5, we can go up: a_5 = U, then y_6=4 at T=6\n\nNow at T=6, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nIs it safe? T=6, not in {3,4,5}, so should be safe.\n\nCheck: freeway 4 at T=6.\n\nFirst car: s=4, span [-59 + 4*6, -48 + 4*6] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24], both neg, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-23 +24, -12+24] = [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [13+24, 24+24]=[37,48], no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow we are at y=4 at T=6.\n\nFrom here, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut freeways 5,6,7,8 have danger only at T=4, which is past, so no issue.\n\nWe can go up directly.\n\na_6 = U, y_7=5 at T=7\n\nAt T=7, y=5, freeway 5, dangerous only at T=4, T=7!=4, safe.\n\na_7 = U, y_8=6 at T=8, freeway 6, safe.\n\na_8 = U, y_9=7 at T=9, freeway 7, safe.\n\na_9 = U, y_10=8 at T=10, freeway 8, safe.\n\na_10 = U, y_11=9 at T=11.\n\nNow at T=11, y=9, which is the target, and no freeway, so done.\n\nH=11 turns? From t=0 to t=10, actions, then at turn 11, y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_t for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn H, y_H=9.\n\nHere H=11 actions: t=0 to 10.\n\nNow, let's list the actions and positions.\n\nTurn t | action a_t | y_{t+1} ? Better to list y at each turn.\n\nTurn 0: y=0, choose a_0\n\nAfter a_0, y_1\n\nIn terms of collision, at each turn T, we have y_T.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T is before action or after? From the collision: \"at turn T\", and \"y_T\", so y_T is the position at the start of turn T, I think.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAnd collision is checked based on y_T and the cars at turn T.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nT=0: y=0, no collision (not on freeway)\n\nAction a_0 = U\n\nThen y_1 =1\n\nT=1: y=1, on freeway 1, check: cars on freeway 1 at T=1. Span: for the car, at T=1, [-59 +3*1, -48+3*1] = [-56,-45], min=-56<=0, max=-45<0, 0 <= max false, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nAction a_1 = U\n\ny_2=2\n\nT=2: y=2, freeway 2, similarly, car span at T=2: [-59+6, -48+6]=[-53,-42], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_2 = U\n\ny_3=3\n\nT=3: y=3, freeway 3, span at T=3: [-59+9, -48+9]=[-50,-39], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_3 = S  (stay, so not go to y=4)\n\ny_4 = y_3 + 0 = 3\n\nT=4: y=3, freeway 3, span at T=4: [-59+12, -48+12]=[-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_4 = S (stay again)\n\ny_5 =3\n\nT=5: y=3, freeway 3, span at T=5: [-59+15, -48+15]=[-44,-33], safe.\n\nAction a_5 = U\n\ny_6=4\n\nT=6: y=4, freeway 4, as above, at T=6, no car has 0 in span, safe.\n\nAction a_6 = U\n\ny_7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, freeway 5, cars: first car span at T=7: [-59+84, -48+84]=[25,36]? s=12, T=7, [-59 +12*7, -48 +12*7] = [-59+84, -48+84] = [25,36], min=25>0, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-11 +84, 84] = [73,84], no. So safe.\n\nAction a_7 = U\n\ny_8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, freeway 6, similarly, at T=8, both cars have positive min span, safe.\n\nAction a_8 = U\n\ny_9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nAction a_9 = U\n\ny_10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nAction a_10 = U\n\ny_11=9\n\nT=11: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nWe reached y=9 at turn 11.\n\nH=11 actions: from t=0 to t=10.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nWe used two extra stays at T=3 and T=4, so from min 9 to 11.\n\nPerhaps we can save one turn.\n\nFor example, instead of staying twice, maybe stay once or go down.\n\nBut going down might take more time.\n\nAnother idea: at T=2, when y=2, instead of going up to y=3 at T=3, we can stay at y=2 for one turn.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=0: y=0, a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nT=1: y=1, a_1=U, y_2=2\n\nT=2: y=2, now instead of U, do S: a_2=S, y_3=2\n\nT=3: y=2, freeway 2, safe (as before)\n\nThen at T=3, we can go up: a_3=U, y_4=3 at T=4\n\nT=4: y=3, safe (freeway 3)\n\nBut now we are at y=3 at T=4.\n\nThen to go to y=4, if we go up at T=4, y_5=4 at T=5, but T=5 y=4 dangerous for freeway 4.\n\nIf we stay at T=4: a_4=S, y_5=3 at T=5\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=4 at T=6, same as before, then up to y=9 at T=11.\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nFrom T=4 y=3, if we go up immediately, we hit T=5 y=4 which is dangerous.\n\nSo we must stay at least one more turn.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=3 earlier.\n\nEarliest y=3 at T=3.\n\nThen we need to stay at y=3 until T=5, so from T=3 to T=5, we are at y=3 for three turns: T=3,4,5.\n\nThen at T=5, go up to y_6=4 at T=6.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut in this case, from T=3 to T=5, we have two stay actions or something.\n\nIn the sequence: after reaching y=3 at T=3, we do a_3=S, so y_4=3 at T=4; a_4=S, y_5=3 at T=5; then a_5=U, y_6=4 at T=6.\n\nSame as before with stays at T=3 and T=4 actions? Let's index.\n\nActions: a_t at turn t.\n\nAfter a_t, y_{t+1}.\n\nPosition at turn T: y_T.\n\ny_0=0\n\na_0: action at t=0, to y_1\n\n...\n\nTo be at y=3 at turn T=3, we need y_3=3.\n\nThen to stay, a_3=S, so y_4=3 (at turn T=4)\n\na_4=S, y_5=3 (at turn T=5)\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=4 (at turn T=6)\n\nThen a_6=U, y_7=5, etc to a_10=U, y_11=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nCan we reach y=4 at T=6 with fewer actions?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y earlier, but we have to avoid T=4 for y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8 at T=4 not possible, so only y=4 issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly to y=5 or something, but not from start.\n\nAnother point: at T=4, freeway 5 is dangerous, but if we are not on it, ok.\n\nBut we can't be on y=5 at T=4 anyway.\n\nNow, what about going down to avoid, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, from y=2 at T=2, instead of going up, go down to y=1, but that seems worse.\n\na_2=D, but from y=2, D to y_3=1 at T=3.\n\nThen T=3 y=1, safe.\n\nThen go up, but slower.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo minimal H might be 11.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do H=10.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\nThen we need y_10=9.\n\nWith 10 actions from t=0 to t=9.\n\ny_10=9.\n\nThe position sequence: we start y_0=0, after 10 actions, y_10=9.\n\nSince each U increases y by 1, to go from 0 to 9, we need exactly 9 U actions and possibly some S or D, but D would decrease, so to net increase by 9, we must have exactly 9 U and possibly S, no D, because D would require more U to compensate.\n\nIf we use D, y decreases, so to reach y=9 from y=0, we must have net +9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9, and S can be used.\n\nBut each D adds an extra turn without progress, so to minimize turns, we should not use D, only U and S.\n\nWith U and S, to go from y=0 to y=9, we need exactly 9 U actions and some S actions.\n\nThe number of S actions adds to the total turns.\n\nMinimal H is 9, with 9 U and no S.\n\nBut we have to add S to avoid collision, so H>9.\n\nWith H=10, we have 9 U and 1 S.\n\nWith H=11, 9 U and 2 S.\n\nNow, for H=10, possible.\n\nWe need to place the S action somewhere to avoid the collision.\n\nIn the direct path, collision at T=4 y=4.\n\nWe need to not be at y=4 at T=4.\n\nWith one S, we can delay one step.\n\nFor example, start: a_0=U, y_1=1\n\na_1=U, y_2=2\n\na_2=U, y_3=3\n\nNow at T=3, y=3.\n\nIf we do a_3=S, then y_4=3 at T=4 (safe)\n\nThen at T=4, y=3.\n\nNow, if we do a_4=U, y_5=4 at T=5.\n\nBut at T=5, y=4, which is dangerous for freeway 4, as before.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf from T=4 y=3, we do U, but we go to y=4 at T=5, dangerous.\n\nWe need to be at y=4 only after T=5.\n\nBut with only one S, we have to use it.\n\nSuppose we stay earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=0, do S: a_0=S, y_1=0 at T=1\n\nThen a_1=U, y_2=1\n\na_2=U, y_3=2\n\na_3=U, y_4=3 at T=4\n\nThen at T=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a_4=U, y_5=4 at T=5, but T=5 y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nSame issue.\n\nIf we go up faster but cannot.\n\nSuppose at T=2, y=2, we do S: a_2=S, y_3=2 at T=3\n\nThen a_3=U, y_4=3 at T=4 (safe)\n\nThen a_4=U, y_5=4 at T=5, again dangerous.\n\nAlways when we go to y=4 at T=5, it is dangerous.\n\nThe only safe times for y=4 are T=6 or later, or T<=2 but impossible.\n\nWith H=10, we need to reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\ny_10=9.\n\nSince we start at y_0=0, and y_10=9, with 10 actions, net +9, so 9 U and 1 S.\n\nThe S action must be used, and we need to be at y=4 at some T>=6.\n\nBut to reach y=4 at T=6, for example.\n\nFrom start, to y=4 at T=6.\n\ny_6=4.\n\nWith actions from t=0 to t=5, we reach y_6.\n\ny_0=0\n\nAfter 6 actions, y_6=4.\n\nSince net +4 in 6 actions, with 4 U and 2 S? But we have only one S for H=10, inconsistency.\n\nFor the whole to y_10=9.\n\nBut for y_6=4.\n\nThe number of U to reach y_6=4 from y_0=0 is at least 4, with 4 U and possibly S or D, but D bad.\n\nMin turns to y=4 is 4, with all U.\n\nBut we need to be at y=4 at T=6, so we must have taken 6 turns to go from y=0 to y=4, meaning we used 4 U and 2 S actions to stay at some points.\n\nThen from there to y=9, we need 5 more U, with additional turns.\n\nBut total actions to reach y_10=9.\n\nSuppose we reach y_4 at some turn later.\n\nFor example, to have y_6=4.\n\nThen from y_6=4, go to y_9=9? y_6=4, then after actions a_6 to a_?, to y_10=9.\n\ny_10 = y_6 + net from a_6 to a_9? Actions a_t for t=6 to 9, 4 actions.\n\ny_{10} = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nTo reach y_10=9, y_6=4, so need net +5 in 4 actions, so at least 5 U, but only 4 actions, impossible.\n\ny_10 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nEach Δy <=1, so max y_10 = y_6 +4\n\nIf y_6=4, y_10 <=8 <9, cannot reach y=9.\n\nTherefore, to reach y_10=9, we need y_6 >=5.\n\nSimilarly, in general.\n\nWith H=10, y_10=9.\n\ny_6 must be at least 5, because from y_6, in 4 actions (t=6,7,8,9), y_10 <= y_6 +4, so y_10=9 implies y_6 >=5.\n\nSimilarly, y_6 <=6, since min to reach y=6 is turn 6.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=4 at some T>=6, but y=4 is not necessary, we just need to pass through it safely.\n\nBut for freeway 4, we must be on it at some turn when safe, i.e., T>=6.\n\nSimilarly, with H=10, y_10=9.\n\ny_6 must be between 5 and 6.\n\nIf y_6=5, then to y_10=9, need net +4 in 4 actions, so possible with 4 U, or 3U and 1S, etc., but min 4U.\n\nSimilarly, if y_6=6, need net +3 in 4 actions, possible with 3U and 1S.\n\nBut we have one S in total for H=10.\n\nNow, back to the danger.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=4 at T=3,4,5.\n\nWith H=10, it might be tight.\n\nSuppose y_6=5.\n\nThen we must have reached y=4 at some turn before.\n\nFor example, to be on y=4 at T=6? But at T=6, y_6=5, not 4.\n\ny_6 is the position at turn 6.\n\nIf y_6=5, then at turn 6, we are on y=5, not y=4.\n\nWe might have been on y=4 at an earlier turn, say T=5 or less.\n\nBut T=5 is dangerous for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, T=4 dangerous, T=3 dangerous.\n\nSo possible safe turns for y=4: T=6 or later.\n\nBut at T=6, if y_6=5, we are not on y=4.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=4 at T=7, for example.\n\nBut with H=10, y_10=9, if we are at y=4 at T=7, then we need to go to y=9 by T=10, which requires 5 steps in 3 turns? From y_7=4 to y_10=9, need net +5 in 3 actions, impossible since max +3.\n\ny_10 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 <= y_7 +3\n\nSo if y_7=4, y_10 <=7<9, impossible.\n\nTherefore, to have y_10=9, we need y_7 >=6.\n\nSimilarly, y_7 <=7.\n\nNow, for y=4, we need to be on it at some T with T>=6.\n\nBut if y_7 >=6, and T=7, y_7>=6, not 4.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, y_6 must be 5 or 6.\n\nIf y_6=5, we might have been on y=4 at T=5 or earlier, but T=5 dangerous.\n\nT=4 dangerous, T=3 dangerous.\n\nT=2: y_2 <=2, cannot be y=4.\n\nT=1: y_1<=1\n\nT=0: y=0\n\nSo the only possible safe turns for y=4 are T=6 or later.\n\nBut at T=6, if y_6=5, we are not on y=4.\n\nAt T=7, y_7>=6, not 4.\n\nSimilarly, later turns, y higher, not 4.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, it is impossible to be on y=4 at a safe turn, because the only safe turns T>=6, but at those turns, with y_10=9, y_t for t>=6 is at least 5 or more, so we never visit y=4 after T=5.\n\nBut we have to visit y=4 to go from y=3 to y=5, for example.\n\nUnless we skip it, but we must pass through y=4.\n\nThe player moves one step at a time, so to go from y=3 to y=5, we must be at y=4 at some turn.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot skip levels.\n\nTherefore, we must be on y=4 at some turn, and that turn must be >=6 to be safe.\n\nBut with H=10 and y_10=9, the position at turn T for T>=6 is at least y_6 >=5, so y_6 >=5, y_7 >=6, etc., so we are at y=4 only at turns T<=5, which are all dangerous for y=4 (T=3,4,5).\n\nT=3,4,5 are all dangerous for freeway 4.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, we must be on y=4 at one of T=3,4, or 5, all of which are dangerous, so collision inevitable.\n\nTherefore, H=10 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for H=9, we must be on y=4 at T=4, which is dangerous.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nIn H=11, we have y_4=3, y_5=3, y_6=4, etc., and y_11=9.\n\nAnd we avoided the danger times.\n\nNow, about other freeways: freeway 5,6,7,8 dangerous at T=4, but at T=4, we are at y=3, not on them, so safe.\n\nAnd at other times, no issue.\n\nAlso, freeways 1,2,3 danger at T=16-19, too late.\n\nSo the sequence is as I had.\n\nNow, to write the actions.\n\nFrom turn t=0 to t=10, 11 actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn t=0: action U, to y=1\n\nt=1: action U, to y=2\n\nt=2: action U, to y=3\n\nt=3: action S, stay at y=3\n\nt=4: action S, stay at y=3\n\nt=5: action U, to y=4\n\nt=6: action U, to y=5\n\nt=7: action U, to y=6\n\nt=8: action U, to y=7\n\nt=9: action U, to y=8\n\nt=10: action U, to y=9\n\nAt turn t=11, y=9.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list actions from turn t1=0.\n\nAnswer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nSo for t1=0.\n\nThus:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nH=11 turns of actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, at the end, after a_{10}, we are at y_{11}=9.\n\nNow, to confirm, the player reaches (0,9) at turn 11.\n\nBut the minimal number of turns H is 11, I think.\n\nPerhaps we can start with S or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we do S at t=0, then later, but we need to reach y=9, so it would take at least as many turns.\n\nSo H=11 should be minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=5, we go to y=4 at T=6, which is safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, in the car states, for freeway 5,6,7,8, there is a car (0,-11,right,12) which at T=0 has 0 in span, but since at T=0, player not on those freeways, and for T>0, not, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on freeway \\(y = 4\\) during turns \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\) (when it is dangerous due to car spans covering \\(x = 0\\)) and not on freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) at turn \\(T = 4\\) (also dangerous). Specifically, the player stays at \\(y = 3\\) during turns \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\) to avoid the danger on \\(y = 4\\), and reaches \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 6\\), which is safe. The subsequent moves to \\(y = 9\\) are collision-free as the danger times for other freeways (e.g., \\(T = 16-19\\) for \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\)) occur after the player has passed.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 0, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turn 1, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 2, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 3\\).\n- At turn 3, action \\(S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 3\\) to avoid moving to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 4\\).\n- At turn 4, action \\(S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 3\\) to avoid the danger at \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 5\\) on \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 5, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 6\\), which is safe.\n- At turn 6, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 7, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 8, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 9, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 10, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nAfter 11 actions (turns 0 to 10), the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 11.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0,1) at turn t1 = 1. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns H, by moving up (U), down (D), or staying (S), while avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The player is only on the freeway at turn T if they are moving to it or staying, but according to the note: if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not considered on that new y until the next turn. Let me read that carefully.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T. If they choose an action to move to y_{T+1}, they are still on y_T during turn T, and only move to y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1. So, for collision check at turn T, it's based on y_T and the cars on that row at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, when they arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, they check for collision on that row at turn T+1.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at turn t1=1, and we need to compute their positions at future turns.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head -45, tail -56, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving, head is larger than tail? Let's see: in the update, for right-moving, span becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], so if head h and tail τ, and it's right-moving, then at t1, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 4, it has (-44, -55, right, 4), so tail -55, head -44, so τ = -55, h = -44, so τ < h, meaning the car extends from left to right.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: (-36, -47, right, 12), so τ = -47, h = -36, τ < h.\n\nAnd (12, 1, right, 12), tail 1, head 12, so from 1 to 12.\n\nAlso, for left-moving, it would be opposite, but here all cars seem to be right-moving from the data.\n\nLet me confirm: all directions are \"right\" in the given state.\n\nFreeway 1: (-45, -56, right, 3) — tail -56, head -45? But it says head h, tail τ, and direction right.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nt1=1.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at turn t1=1.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, and there are cars on y=1 to y=8, so we need to move up to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars mentioned, and it's not a freeway with cars, so once we reach y=9, no collision possible, I assume.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, but we start at (0,1), which is on freeway y=1, and end at (0,9), which might be above the freeways or on y=9? The vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so safe.\n\nBut the player position is (0,y), so at y=0 or y=9, no collision risk.\n\nNow, at turn T, if player is on y_T between 1 and 8, we need to ensure that for that y, no car has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in Span(T).\n\nOtherwise, no collision.\n\nIf y_T = 0 or 9, no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=1 to y=9, so we need to move up.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S keeps same, but y must be in [0,9], so we can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nStart at y=1, we want to reach y=9, so we need to increase y by 8, so minimum 8 moves if we only go up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 8.\n\nBut we need minimal H, so we should go up as much as possible without colliding.\n\nNow, let's compute the car positions for each freeway at different turns.\n\nFirst, define t1=1.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s, at time T (turn number), the span is:\n\nSince all d=right, span at T: [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)]  because T-t1 = T-1.\n\nt1=1, so T-t1 = T-1.\n\nSo Span(T) = [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] for right-moving cars.\n\nNow, collision at turn T on freeway k if y_T = k and 0 is in [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] for some car on that freeway.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: τ = -56, h = -45, s=3\n\nSo Span(T) = [-56 + 3(T-1), -45 + 3(T-1)] = [-56 -3 + 3T, -45 -3 + 3T] = [-59 + 3T, -48 + 3T]\n\nSimplify: Span(T) = [3T - 59, 3T - 48]\n\n0 in span if 3T - 59 <= 0 <= 3T - 48, so 3T - 59 <= 0 and 0 <= 3T - 48? No.\n\n0 in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nSo low <= 0 and 0 <= high.\n\nSo 3T - 59 <= 0 and 3T - 48 >= 0? 0 <= high means high >=0.\n\nSo:\n\n3T - 59 <= 0 => T <= 59/3 = 19.666, so T <= 19 since T integer\n\n3T - 48 >= 0 => T >= 48/3 = 16\n\nSo for T from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 is in span, so collision if on freeway 1 at those turns.\n\nT=16: low = 3*16 -59 = 48-59= -11, high=48-48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nT=17: low=51-59=-8, high=51-48=3, [ -8,3], 0 in.\n\nT=18: 54-59=-5, 54-48=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=19: 57-59=-2, 57-48=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nT=20: low=60-59=1, high=60-48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nT=15: low=45-59=-14, high=45-48=-3, [-14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 dangerous at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1?

T=1: [13+4(1-1)? T-1=0 when T=1.\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)] = [17 + 4(T-1), 28 + 4(T-1)]\n\nT=1: [17,28], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nT=2: [17+4,28+4]=[21,32], etc., always >0, so 0 never in span for this car. So safe, no issue.\n\nSo for freeway 4, dangerous only from the first two cars:\n\nFirst car dangerous T=12,13,14\n\nSecond car dangerous T=3,4,5\n\nThird car never dangerous.\n\nSo overall, freeway 4 dangerous at T=3,4,5 (from second car) and T=12,13,14 (from first car)\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12) τ=-47, h=-36, s=12\n\nSpan(T) = [-47 +12(T-1), -36 +12(T-1)] = [-47-12+12T, -36-12+12T] = [-59+12T, -48+12T]\n\n0 in span if -59+12T <=0 and -48+12T >=0\n\n12T <=59 => T<=59/12=4.916, T<=4\n\n12T >=48 => T>=4\n\nSo T=4 only? Let's see:\n\nT=4: low=-59+48= -11, high=-48+48=0, [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nT=5: low=-59+60=1, high=-48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nT=3: low=-59+36= -23, high=-48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nSo only dangerous at T=4.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (12,1,right,12) τ=1, h=12, s=12\n\nSpan(T) = [1 +12(T-1), 12 +12(T-1)] = [1-12+12T, 12-12+12T] = [-11+12T, 0+12T] = [12T-11, 12T]\n\n0 in span if 12T-11 <=0 and 12T >=0\n\n12T >=0 always for T>=1\n\n12T-11 <=0 => T <=11/12 <1, so never true for T>=1. So 0 not in span for any T. Safe.\n\nSo freeway 5 dangerous only at T=4 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (-36,-47,right,12) and (12,1,right,12), same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 6: (-36,-47,right,12), (12,1,right,12) — identical to freeway 5.\n\nSo dangerous only at T=4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, (-36,-47,right,12), (12,1,right,12), dangerous at T=4.\n\nFreeway 8: same, (-36,-47,right,12), (12,1,right,12), dangerous at T=4.\n\nFreeway 8 has the same cars as 5,6,7.\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous T=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=2: same, T=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=3: same, T=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=4: dangerous at T=3,4,5 (from second car) and T=12,13,14 (from first car)\n\n- y=5: dangerous at T=4\n\n- y=6: dangerous at T=4\n\n- y=7: dangerous at T=4\n\n- y=8: dangerous at T=4\n\nFor y=4, T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14.\n\nBut at T=4, multiple freeways are dangerous.\n\nPlayer starts at turn t1=1, position y=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, so we need to move up 8 times.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times.\n\nSince the dangerous times are early for some and late for others, we might need to delay or hurry.\n\nFirst, at turn 1, player is at y=1.\n\ny=1 is dangerous only at T=16-19, which are later turns, so at turn 1, is it safe?\n\nFor y=1 at turn T=1: we need to check if 0 in span for freeway 1 at T=1.\n\nFrom earlier, for y=1, Span(T=1) = [3*1 -59, 3*1 -48] = [-56, -45]? Earlier calculation.\n\nAt T=1, for freeway 1: τ + s(1-1) = τ = -56, h + s(0) = h = -45, so span [-56,-45], which is negative, 0 not in, so safe at T=1 on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at T=1, let's not compute all, but since player is only on y=1 at T=1, we only care about that.\n\nSo at turn 1, position y=1, safe.\n\nNow, we need to choose action a1.\n\nWe can go up to y=2, down to y=0, or stay at y=1.\n\nGoing down to y=0 might not be efficient, since we need to go up eventually.\n\nSimilarly, staying might waste time.\n\nBut y=2 is also dangerous only at T=16-19, so at early turns, it should be safe.\n\nAt turn T=2, if we go to y=2 at turn 2, we need to check freeway 2 at T=2.\n\nFreeway 2 at T=2: span [3*2 -59, 3*2 -48] = [6-59,6-48] = [-53,-42], negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=3: [9-59,9-48]=[-50,-39], safe.\n\n...\n\nUp to T=15: [45-59,45-48]=[-14,-3], safe.\n\nT=16: [48-59,48-48]=[-11,0], 0 in, dangerous.\n\nSo for y=2, safe for T<=15.\n\nSimilarly for y=1 and y=3.\n\ny=3 same as y=1 and 2.\n\nNow for y=4, dangerous at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nAt T=1 and T=2, is y=4 safe?\n\nAt T=1, freeway 4: for first car, span [-59+4(1-1)? T=1: τ + s(0) for first car: τ=-55, h=-44, span [-55,-44], negative, safe.\n\nSecond car: τ=-19, h=-8, span [-19,-8], negative, safe.\n\nThird car positive, safe.\n\nSo at T=1, y=4 safe.\n\nT=2: first car span [-59+4(2-1)? T=2: τ + s(1) = -55 +4(1) = -51? Span(T) = [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)]\n\nT=2: [ -55 +4(1), -44 +4(1)] = [-55+4, -44+4] = [-51,-40], negative.\n\nSecond car: [ -19 +4(1), -8 +4(1)] = [-15,-4], negative.\n\nSafe.\n\nT=3: first car: [ -55 +4(2), -44+4(2)] = [-55+8, -44+8] = [-47,-36], negative? -47 to -36, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nBut earlier for second car at T=3: [ -23+4T? For second car: τ=-19, s=4, T=3: τ + s(T-1) = -19 +4(2) = -19+8= -11? Let's compute properly.\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s(T-1), h + s(T-1)]\n\nFor second car on y=4: τ=-19, h=-8, s=4\n\nT=3: [ -19 + 4*(3-1), -8 + 4*(3-1) ] = [ -19 + 4*2, -8 + 8 ] = [ -19+8, -8+8 ] = [ -11, 0 ], which includes 0, dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, first car at T=3: [ -55 +4*2, -44 +8] = [-55+8, -44+8] = [-47,-36], negative, safe.\n\nSo at T=3, y=4 dangerous because of second car.\n\nSimilarly, T=4: first car: [ -55 +4(3), -44 +12] = [-55+12, -44+12] = [-43,-32], negative? T=4: T-1=3, s=4, so -55 +4*3 = -55+12= -43, h + s(T-1) = -44 +12= -32, [-43,-32], negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -19 +4*3, -8 +12] = [-19+12, -8+12] = [-7,4], includes 0.\n\nAlso first car of y=4 dangerous only from T=12, as earlier.\n\nAt T=4, also freeway 5,6,7,8 dangerous.\n\nBut for y=4 at T=4, dangerous from second car.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nStart at turn 1, y=1, safe.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we should go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times:\n\n- For y=1,2,3: dangerous at T=16,17,18,19\n\n- For y=4: dangerous at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\n- For y=5,6,7,8: dangerous only at T=4\n\ny=5 to 8 dangerous only at T=4.\n\nNow, since we start at y=1, and need to reach y=9.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is if we go up every turn: from turn 1 to 9, but turns: at turn 1, y=1.\n\nAfter action at turn 1, y2 = y1 + Δy.\n\nAfter turn t, position for turn t+1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, player is at position (0, y_t), then chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nThen at turn t+1, player is at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T means when player is at y_T, and if 1<= y_T <=8, and for freeway k=y_T, 0 is in some car's span at turn T.\n\nNow, for the player, at turn 1, y=1, safe as we saw.\n\nWe can choose a1: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up, at turn 2, y=2.\n\nAt turn 2, y=2, which is safe for T=2, as span [-53,-42] for y=2, negative.\n\nThen at turn 2, choose action, if U, to y=3 at turn 3.\n\nAt turn 3, y=3.\n\ny=3 is dangerous only at T=16-19, so at T=3, should be safe.\n\nCheck: freeway 3 at T=3: span [3*3 -59, 3*3 -48] = [9-59,9-48] = [-50,-39], negative, safe.\n\nIf we go to y=4 at turn 4? From turn 3 y=3, if we go U, to y=4 at turn 4.\n\nBut at turn 4, y=4 is dangerous because of second car on y=4 at T=4.\n\ny=4 at T=4: from above, second car span [-7,4], includes 0, so collision if on y=4 at turn 4.\n\nAlso, y=5,6,7,8 are dangerous at T=4, but we are on y=4.\n\nSo if we are on y=4 at turn 4, collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=4 at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 3, if we are on y=4, dangerous because T=3 y=4 dangerous.\n\nAt turn 3, y=4: T=3, second car span [-11,0], includes 0, collision.\n\nAt turn 5, y=4: T=5, second car? At T=5, second car span: [ -23+4*5? T=5: τ + s(4) = -19 +4*4 = -19+16= -3, h + s(4) = -8+16=8, so [-3,8], includes 0, dangerous.\n\nFirst car not dangerous until T=12.\n\nSo y=4 dangerous at T=3,4,5.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nIf we go straight up from turn 1:\n\nTurn 1: at y=1, choose U, so y2=2\n\nTurn 2: at y=2, choose U, so y3=3\n\nTurn 3: at y=3, now if we choose U, y4=4, but at turn 4, y=4, which is dangerous (T=4).\n\nIf we choose S at turn 3, y4=3, then at turn 4, y=3, which is safe since T=4<16.\n\nThen at turn 4, we can choose U to y=5, but at turn 5, y=5.\n\ny=5 dangerous only at T=4, so at T=5, should be safe.\n\nCheck: freeway 5 at T=5: for first car, span [-59+12*4, -48+48]? T=5: [ -59 +12(5-1), -48 +12(4) ] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0]? T=5: T-1=4, s=12, τ + s(4) = -47 +12*4 = -47+48=1, h + s(4) = -36 +48=12, so [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, second car always safe.\n\nSo at T=5, y=5 safe.\n\nBut we need to go through y=4 or avoid.\n\nIn this sequence: turn 3 at y=3, if we stay, y4=3 at turn 4, safe.\n\nThen turn 4 at y=3, choose U, so y5=4 at turn 5.\n\nBut at turn 5, y=4, which is dangerous because T=5, y=4 dangerous (from second car, [-3,8] includes 0).\n\nCollision.\n\nIf from turn 4 y=3, we go U to y4? At turn 4, position y=3, choose action to set y5.\n\nIf choose U, y5=4.\n\nThen at turn 5, position y=4, which is T=5, dangerous.\n\nIf choose S, y5=3, still at y=3.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nTo avoid y=4 during T=3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 are dangerous only at T=4, so if we are not on them at T=4, safe.\n\nNow, the critical point is around turn 4.\n\nAlso, later for y=4, dangerous at T=12-14, but since we want minimal H, we might not reach that late if we go fast.\n\nMinimal H: if no obstacles, H=8 turns to go from y=1 to y=9.\n\nStart turn 1, after 8 actions, at turn 9, y=1+8=9.\n\nTurn 1: y=1\n\nAfter a1, y2\n\nAfter a2, y3\n\n...\n\nAfter a8, y9\n\nIf all U, y2=2, y3=3, y4=4, y5=5, y6=6, y7=7, y8=8, y9=9.\n\nNow, check for each turn if collision.\n\nTurn 1: y=1, safe\n\nTurn 2: y=2, safe\n\nTurn 3: y=3, safe (as above)\n\nTurn 4: y=4, dangerous! T=4, y=4 collision.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=4 at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 3, if we were on y=4, also dangerous, but in this sequence we are on y=3 at turn 3.\n\nAt turn 4, we are on y=4.\n\nTo avoid, we can stay at y=3 at turn 4 or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nAt turn 3, we are at y=3, instead of going U to y=4 for turn 4, we can stay S, so at turn 4, y=3.\n\ny=3 at turn 4 is safe, since dangerous only at T=16-19.\n\nThen at turn 4, we are at y=3, choose action.\n\nIf we go U, to y=4 at turn 5.\n\nBut turn 5, y=4, dangerous (T=5).\n\nIf go D, to y=2 at turn 5, but then we are lower, not efficient.\n\nGo S again, but waste time.\n\nWe need to skip y=4 during the dangerous period T=3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5 to 8, dangerous only at T=4, so we should not be on y=5,6,7,8 at turn 4.\n\nSince T=4 is only one turn, we can avoid being on those rows at that exact turn.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous turns for each y:\n\n- y=4: T=3,4,5\n\n- y=5: T=4\n\n- y=6: T=4\n\n- y=7: T=4\n\n- y=8: T=4\n\n- y=1,2,3: T=16-19 (but late, we might not care if we go fast)\n\nSince we start early, and T=16-19 are late, if we reach y=9 before turn 16, we don't encounter y=1,2,3 dangerous times.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4, T=12-14 also late.\n\nMinimal H=8 would finish at turn 9, which is before 12, so we only need to worry about early dangerous times: around T=4 for y=4,5,6,7,8 and T=3,5 for y=4.\n\nSpecifically, to reach y=9 quickly, we need to pass through y=4 to y=8, but avoid being on them at bad times.\n\nSince y=5-8 are only dangerous at T=4, we should not be on y=5,6,7,8 at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly for y=4, avoid at T=3,4,5.\n\nNow, turn 4 is key.\n\nPlayer at turn 1: y=1\n\nTurn 2: can be y=2 or y=1 or y=0, but y=0 safe but not progress.\n\nAssume we go up when possible.\n\nTurn 1: start y=1, choose U, so y2=2\n\nTurn 2: at y=2, choose U, so y3=3\n\nNow turn 3: at y=3\n\nIf we choose U, y4=4, but at turn 4, y=4 dangerous.\n\nIf we choose S, y4=3, then at turn 4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at turn 4, we are at y=3.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=4, but at turn 5, if we go to y=4, it is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 6, y=4 might be safe? y=4 dangerous only at T=3,4,5, so at T=6, should be safe.\n\nCheck: freeway 4 at T=6.\n\nFirst car: span [-59+4*5, -48+20]? T=6: [τ + s(5), h + s(5)] = for first car τ=-55, s=4, T-1=5, so -55 +4*5 = -55+20= -35, h=-44+20= -24, [-35,-24], negative, safe.\n\nSecond car: τ=-19, s=4, T-1=5, -19+20=1, h=-8+20=12, [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo at T=6, y=4 safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=7,8,... all safe until T=12.\n\nSo if we can be on y=4 at T=6 or later, safe from early danger.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5-8, dangerous only at T=4, so at other times safe.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nAt turn 4, we are at y=3 (if we stayed at turn 3).\n\nThen at turn 4, we can choose action.\n\nIf we go U, y5=4, but at turn 5, y=4, T=5 dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf we go D, to y=2 at turn 5, but then we go down, worse.\n\nIf we go S, stay at y=3 for turn 5, still not progress.\n\nSo we need to do something else.\n\nPerhaps at turn 3, instead of staying, we go down? But that seems inefficient.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=3, then instead of going to y=4, we go down to y=2 or something to wait.\n\nBut let's think about the timing.\n\nTurn 4 is dangerous for many rows.\n\nWe need to be on a safe row at turn 4.\n\nWhat is safe at turn 4?\n\ny=0 or y=9, but not reachable yet.\n\ny=1: at T=4, freeway 1 span [3*4-59, 3*4-48] = [12-59,12-48] = [-47,-36], negative, safe.\n\ny=2: similarly, [-53,-42]? T=4: [3*4-59,3*4-48]= [12-59,12-48]=[-47,-36], safe.\n\ny=3: same, safe.\n\ny=4: dangerous\n\ny=5: dangerous at T=4\n\ny=6: dangerous\n\ny=7: dangerous\n\ny=8: dangerous\n\ny=9: safe, but not reachable.\n\nSo at turn 4, only y=1,2,3 are safe.\n\nSince we start from y=1, we can be at y=3 at turn 4 by staying or adjusting.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 3, we are at y=3, if we stay S, then at turn 4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at turn 4, we need to choose action for turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, we can be at y=4, but T=5, y=4 dangerous.\n\ny=2 if go down, or y=3 if stay.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nSince y=4 is dangerous at T=5, we cannot go to y=4 until T=6.\n\nAt turn 4, we can go up to y=4 for turn 5? No, if at turn 4 we choose U, then y5=4, so at turn 5, y=4, dangerous.\n\nIf we choose S, y5=3, or D, y5=2.\n\nThen at turn 5, we are at y=3 or y=2.\n\nThen at turn 5, we can go U to y=4 for turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6, y=4, which is safe as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, then we can go up.\n\nLet's outline:\n\n- Turn 1: at y=1, choose U, so y2=2\n\n- Turn 2: at y=2, choose U, so y3=3\n\n- Turn 3: at y=3, choose S (stay), so y4=3\n\n- Turn 4: at y=3, choose U, so y5=4? But y5=4 at turn 5, dangerous.\n\nMistake.\n\nAt turn 4, position y=3, choose action to set y5.\n\nIf choose U, y5=4.\n\nThen at turn 5, position y=4, which is T=5, dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo at turn 4, we should not choose U; instead, choose S or D.\n\nIf choose S, y5=3, then at turn 5, position y=3.\n\nThen at turn 5, we can choose U, so y6=4.\n\nThen at turn 6, position y=4, T=6, which is safe for y=4.\n\nThen we can go up to y=5,6,etc.\n\nNow, check y=5 to 8.\n\nAt turn 6, y=4 safe.\n\nThen we can go U to y=5 at turn 7.\n\nAt turn 7, y=5.\n\ny=5 dangerous only at T=4, so at T=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly, go U to y=6 at turn 8, y=6 at T=8 safe.\n\nU to y=7 at turn 9, y=7 at T=9 safe.\n\nU to y=8 at turn 10, y=8 at T=10 safe.\n\nU to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so at turn 11, y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, H is the number of actions, from turn t1=1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nStart at turn 1, after H actions, we reach turn 1+H.\n\nPosition after H actions is y_{1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{1+H} =9.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\n- Action at turn 1: U, to y2=2\n\n- Action at turn 2: U, to y3=3\n\n- Action at turn 3: S, to y4=3? Action at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn 1, action a1 determines y2.\n\nAt turn 2, a2 determines y3.\n\n...\n\nAt turn t, a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nWe want for some H, after H actions, y_{1+H} =9.\n\nThat is, after actions from turn 1 to turn H, we have y_{H+1} =9.\n\nNumber of turns from 1 to H, actions, we reach position at turn H+1.\n\nStart: turn 1, position y1=1.\n\nAfter first action (turn 1), position at turn 2 is y2.\n\nAfter second action (turn 2), position at turn 3 is y3.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn k+1.\n\nTo have position at turn T be 9, we need y_T =9.\n\nAnd T = t1 + H, since start turn t1=1, after H actions, at turn 1+H.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn 1: a1=U, so y2=2\n\nTurn 2: a2=U, so y3=3\n\nTurn 3: a3=S, so y4=3  (since S, Δy=0)\n\nTurn 4: a4=S, so y5=3  (if we choose S)\n\nThen turn 5: a5=U, so y6=4\n\nThen turn 6: a6=U, so y7=5\n\nTurn 7: a7=U, so y8=6\n\nTurn 8: a8=U, so y9=7\n\nTurn 9: a9=U, so y10=8\n\nTurn 10: a10=U, so y11=9\n\nSo at turn 11, y=9.\n\nH=10 actions? Let's count the actions.\n\nActions from turn 1 to turn 10: 10 actions, reach y11=9.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nIn this, we stayed at y=3 for two extra turns (turn 4 and turn 5 position y=3? Let's list positions:\n\nTurn 1: y1=1\n\nAfter a1=U: y2=2\n\nAfter a2=U: y3=3\n\nAfter a3=S: y4=3\n\nAfter a4=S: y5=3\n\nAfter a5=U: y6=4\n\nAfter a6=U: y7=5\n\nAfter a7=U: y8=6\n\nAfter a8=U: y9=7\n\nAfter a9=U: y10=8\n\nAfter a10=U: y11=9\n\nSo y11=9, with 10 actions.\n\nBut we started at turn 1, so to reach turn 11, H=10 turns? The number of turns H means the sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, but here t1=1.\n\nThe problem says: determine minimal H and sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=1, so actions a1, a2, ..., a_{1+H-1} = a_H.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn (1 + H).\n\nWe want y_{1+H} =9.\n\nIn above, with H=10, y11=9.\n\nBut we can have smaller H.\n\nMinimal without obstacles is H=8, with y9=9.\n\nBut with obstacles, we need to avoid.\n\nIn the above sequence, we have two S actions, which waste time.\n\nWe can reduce.\n\nAt turn 3, instead of staying, we can go down briefly to avoid.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 1 or 2, we stay to delay.\n\nBut let's think.\n\nWe need to be not on y=4 at T=4 and T=5.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=5-8 at T=4.\n\nNow, since y=5-8 are only dangerous at T=4, if we pass through them at other times, safe.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=5 at T=5 or later, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for y=4, we need to avoid T=3,4,5.\n\nSo we should aim to be on y=4 at T=6 or later.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, at T=5 or later, but T=5 is fine since dangerous only at T=4 for y=5.\n\ny=5 dangerous at T=4 only.\n\nAt T=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo let's try to go up but with one wait.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 1: at y=1, choose U, so y2=2\n\nTurn 2: at y=2, choose U, so y3=3\n\nNow at turn 3, we need to not go to y=4 immediately.\n\nIf we choose S at turn 3, y4=3\n\nThen at turn 4, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nNow at turn 4, we cannot go to y=4 because if we go U, y5=4, turn 5 y=4 dangerous.\n\nBut if at turn 4, we go directly to y=5? No, we can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nActions U,D,S change y by +1,-1,0.\n\nSo from y=3, we can go to y=4 or y=2 or y=3.\n\nNot directly to y=5.\n\nSo we must pass through y=4.\n\nBut at turn 4, if we go U to y=4 for turn 5, dangerous.\n\nSo we have to wait until turn 5 to go to y=4 for turn 6.\n\nAt turn 4, position y=3, we choose S, so y5=3\n\nThen at turn 5, position y=3, choose U, so y6=4\n\nThen at turn 6, y=4, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut we lost two turns: one at turn 3 (S) and one at turn 4 (S), so we have two waits.\n\nBut we can have only one wait if we time it differently.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, instead of going up, we stay.\n\nTurn 1: U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: at y=2, choose S, so y3=2\n\nThen turn 3: at y=2, choose U, so y4=3\n\nThen turn 4: at y=3, choose U, so y5=4\n\nBut at turn 5, y=4, T=5 dangerous.\n\nSame problem.\n\nTurn 1: S, stay at y=1, so y2=1\n\nThen turn 2: U, y3=2\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=3\n\nTurn 4: at y=3, choose S, so y5=3\n\nThen turn 5: U, y6=4\n\nTurn 6: U, y7=5\n\netc., same as before.\n\nWe still have a delay.\n\nBut at turn 4, we are at y=3, which is safe, but we cannot go to y=4 immediately because turn 5 y=4 dangerous.\n\nUnless we go to y=4 at a time when it is safe, like turn 6.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at turn 6, we need to have y5 such that after action at turn 5, y6=4.\n\nFor example, at turn 5, position y5, if y5=3, choose U, y6=4.\n\nOr y5=4, but if y5=4, turn 5 dangerous, so we want y5=3.\n\nSimilarly, to have y5=3, at turn 4, position y4, choose action to set y5.\n\nIf y4=3, choose S, y5=3.\n\nIf y4=2, choose U, y5=3.\n\nEtc.\n\nBut in all cases, we need to be at y=3 at turn 4 or something.\n\nLet's list the positions over turns.\n\nWe want to minimize the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nStart turn 1 y=1.\n\nIf no cars, fastest: a1=U, y2=2; a2=U, y3=3; a3=U, y4=4; a4=U, y5=5; a5=U, y6=6; a6=U, y7=7; a7=U, y8=8; a8=U, y9=9. So at turn 9, y=9, H=8 actions.\n\nBut with cars, at turn 4, y=4 dangerous; also if we are on y=5 at turn 4, dangerous, but in this sequence at turn 4 y=4.\n\nWe need to avoid y=4 at turn 4, and also avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at turn 4.\n\nIn the fast sequence, at turn 4, we are on y=4, which is bad.\n\nAlso, if we could be on y=3 at turn 4, safe, but then at turn 5 we need to go to y=4, which is bad at turn 5.\n\nSo we must have a turn where we stay or move down to skip the dangerous time.\n\nSince y=4 is dangerous for three turns, we need to spend at least one extra turn below y=4.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5-8, since dangerous only at one turn, we can avoid by timing, but since we have to go through, and the dangerous turn is the same, we can pass through them after T=4.\n\nBut because of y=4 being dangerous from T=3 to T=5, we are forced to delay.\n\nMinimal H might be 9 or 10.\n\nWith H=9 actions, we can reach y10=9.\n\nFor example, start from y=1.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need 8 net up moves, but with some stays or downs.\n\nEach S or D adds a turn without progress.\n\nWith one extra turn, we can have one stay.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 1: U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: S, y4=3  (wait at y=3)\n\nThen turn 4: U, but if U, y5=4, turn 5 y=4 dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nTurn 1: U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: S, y3=2  (wait at y=2)\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=3\n\nTurn 4: U, y5=4  turn 5 y=4 dangerous.\n\nSame.\n\nTurn 1: S, y2=1\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=2\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=3\n\nTurn 4: S, y5=3  (wait at y=3)\n\nThen turn 5: U, y6=4  (turn 6 y=4 safe)\n\nThen turn 6: U, y7=5\n\nTurn 7: U, y8=6\n\nTurn 8: U, y9=7\n\nTurn 9: U, y10=8\n\nWe need to reach y=9, so y10=8, not 9.\n\nAfter turn 9 action, y10=8, then turn 10: U, y11=9.\n\nSo still H=10.\n\nWith one stay, we can reach up to y=8 at turn 10, then to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nBut we can go faster by going down and up, but that might not save time.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, go down to y=2, then up.\n\nTurn 1: U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: D, y4=2  (go down to y=2)\n\nThen turn 4: at y=2, choose U, y5=3\n\nTurn 5: at y=3, choose U, y6=4  (turn 6 y=4 safe)\n\nThen turn 6: U, y7=5\n\nTurn 7: U, y8=6\n\nTurn 8: U, y9=7\n\nTurn 9: U, y10=8\n\nTurn 10: U, y11=9\n\nStill H=10, same as staying.\n\nAnd we used a D, which is worse than S.\n\nSo not better.\n\nAt turn 4, we can go to a safe row, but all safe rows are low.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 4, only y=1,2,3 safe, and we are coming from above, we can be at y=3.\n\nBut then to go up, we need to wait.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 at some point, but that might not help.\n\ny=0 is safe, but we need to go up to 9.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, go down to y=2, then at turn 4, at y=2, safe, then go up.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nI think we cannot avoid at least one extra turn.\n\nWith H=9 actions, we can have y10=9 only if we have 8 up and one something, but if we have a down, we need an extra up, so net same.\n\nFor example, if we go down once and up once, it cancels, so to go from 1 to 9, net +8, so number of U minus number of D must be 8, and S add turns.\n\nMinimal actions with no S or D is 8.\n\nWith S, we add turns.\n\nWith D, we need extra U, so more actions.\n\nSo minimal H is at least 8, but with obstacles, we need at least one S or equivalent.\n\nWith one S, we can have 8 U and one S, but 9 actions, reach y10=9? Let's see.\n\nWith 8 U and one S, we can be at y=9 at turn 10.\n\nFor example: actions: U,U,U,S,U,U,U,U,U but 9 actions.\n\nStart y1=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=S, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\nBut y5=4 at turn 5 dangerous.\n\nIf we place S earlier.\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\na2=S, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4  dangerous.\n\na1=S, y2=1\n\na2=U, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\na4=S, y5=3\n\na5=U, y6=4 safe (turn 6)\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\nNow y10=8, not 9.\n\nThen need a10=U, y11=9.\n\nSo to reach y=9, we need the 8th up move.\n\nIn this sequence, at a5=U, y6=4, which is the 4th up move? Let's count net up.\n\nFrom y1=1 to y10=8, we have 7 net up moves? y1=1, y10=8, so increased by 7, so 7 net up, with one S and one something.\n\nActions: a1=S (no change), a2=U (+1), a3=U (+1), a4=S (no), a5=U (+1), a6=U (+1), a7=U (+1), a8=U (+1), a9=U (+1), so from y1=1, after a9, y10=1 +1+1+0+1+1+1+1+1 = let's calculate: start 1, after a2 U:2, a3 U:3, a4 S:3, a5 U:4, a6 U:5, a7 U:6, a8 U:7, a9 U:8, so y10=8.\n\nTo get to 9, need another U, a10=U, y11=9.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nWith 8 U and one S, we can have y_{1+H} =1 + number of U minus number of D + number of S*0.\n\nSince number of U minus number of D =8, and number of S = s, then total actions H = number of U + number of D + number of S.\n\nBut number of U = 8 + number of D, so H = (8 + d) + d + s = 8 + 2d + s.\n\nTo minimize H, we want d=0 and s small, but with d=0, H=8 + s.\n\nWith s=0, H=8, but not possible due to collision.\n\nWith s=1, H=9, but with s=1 and d=0, H=9 actions, but with 8 U and 1 S, we reach y10 =1 +8 =9, because net +8 from start.\n\ny1=1, after 8 U and 1 S, the position depends on when the S is.\n\nFor example, if we do 7 U and 1 S, we might be at y=8 or less.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=1, we need exactly 8 net up moves.\n\nSo with actions including S or D, if we have s stays and d down moves, then number of U moves must be 8 + d.\n\nTotal actions H = u + d + s = (8 + d) + d + s = 8 + 2d + s.\n\nH is minimized when d and s are small.\n\nMinimal H when d=0, s=0, H=8, but not possible.\n\nNext, d=0, s=1, H=9.\n\nIs it possible with H=9?\n\nThat is, 8 U and 1 S, reach y10=9.\n\nThe S must be at a point where we don't lose progress, but we need to avoid the collision.\n\nSuppose we have 8 U and 1 S.\n\nThe S can be at some turn.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, S at y=3.\n\nThen sequence:\n\nTurn 1: U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: S, y4=3\n\nTurn 4: U, y5=4  but turn 5 y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf S at turn 4:\n\nTurn 1: U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=4  turn 4 y=4 dangerous! At turn 4, position y=4, which is T=4, dangerous, collision immediately.\n\nIn this case, at turn 4, when we are on y=4, it is turn T=4, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=4 at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=5 at turn 4, also dangerous.\n\nBut in the fast sequence, at turn 4 we are on y=4.\n\nSo with S at turn 4 not possible because we would be on y=4 at turn 4.\n\nIf S at turn 1:\n\nTurn 1: S, y2=1\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=2\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=3\n\nTurn 4: U, y5=4  turn 5 y=4 dangerous.\n\nSame issue.\n\nIf S at turn 2:\n\nTurn 1: U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: S, y3=2\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=3\n\nTurn 4: U, y5=4 dangerous.\n\nAll cases, when we go to y=4 at turn 5, it is dangerous.\n\nBecause to reach y=4 by turn 5, in the sequence, it happens at a dangerous time.\n\nWith one S, we cannot avoid being on y=4 at turn 5 if we go up continuously with one delay.\n\nFor example, if we delay earlier, we reach y=4 later, but with one S, we reach y=4 at turn 5 or 6.\n\nIf we S at turn 3, we reach y=4 at turn 5 (y5=4).\n\nIf we S at turn 1, we reach y=4 at turn 5 (y5=4).\n\nIf we S at turn 2, same.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=4 safely is turn 6.\n\nTo be at y=4 at turn 6, we need y6=4.\n\nThat means after action at turn 5, y6=4.\n\nSo at turn 5, position y5, and a5=U, so y5 must be 3.\n\nThen at turn 5, y5=3, which is safe.\n\nTo have y5=3, we can have different paths.\n\nFor example, from start, with no delay, at turn 4 y4=4, but that is dangerous and early.\n\nWith one S, say at turn 3 S, then y4=3, then turn 4 U, y5=4, but turn 5 y=4 dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf we have the S later, but we need to reach y=4 by turn 6.\n\nWith H=9, we have actions from turn 1 to 9, position at turn 10.\n\nWe want y10=9.\n\nTo reach y10=9, we need to have y9 such that a9=U to y10=9, so y9=8.\n\nSimilarly, y10=9.\n\nBut with 8 U and 1 S, we can have y10=9 only if the S is not at the end, but since we go to 9, it's fine.\n\nBut the issue is the intermediate steps.\n\nSuppose we do the S at a low row.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 1: U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: U, but if U, y4=4, turn 4 collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nTurn 1: U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: S, y4=3\n\nTurn 4: S, but we have only one S, with H=9, we have 8 U and 1 S, so we can have only one S.\n\nTurn 4 must be U or D or S, but if S, we have two S, but we only have one S for H=9 with 8U 1S.\n\nAssume d=0, s=1, u=8.\n\nActions: eight U and one S.\n\nSequence must include one S.\n\nBut wherever we put the S, when we go from y=3 to y=4, it will be at a turn where y=4 is dangerous or we are forced to be there at T=4 or5.\n\nSpecifically, the turn when we first reach y=4.\n\nWith no S, we reach y=4 at turn 4 (y4=4).\n\nWith one S, if we S before reaching y=3, we reach y=4 at turn 5.\n\nFor example, S at turn 1: y2=1, y3=2, y4=3, y5=4\n\nS at turn 2: y2=2, y3=2 (S), y4=3, y5=4\n\nS at turn 3: y2=2, y3=3, y4=3 (S), y5=4\n\nIn all cases, y5=4 at turn 5, which is dangerous.\n\nIf we S after, but we need to reach y=4.\n\nSo with one S, we always reach y=4 at turn 5, which is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible with H=9; we must have at least two extra actions or something.\n\nWith s=1, we reach y=4 at turn 5, dangerous.\n\nTo reach y=4 at turn 6 safely, we need to have y5=3 and a5=U.\n\ny5=3 can be at turn 5, which is safe.\n\nTo have y5=3, from start, with no delay, y5=5 if all U, but with delays.\n\nFor example, to have y5=3, we can have actions with one S or D.\n\nWith one S: for example, a1=U, y2=2; a2=U, y3=3; a3=S, y4=3; a4=U, y5=4? Not 3.\n\nTo have y5=3, we need to be at y=3 at turn 5.\n\nSo at turn 4, position y4, and a4 determines y5.\n\nIf a4=S, y5=y4, so y4 must be 3.\n\nIf a4=D, y5=y4-1, so y4 must be 4, etc.\n\nEasier to have y4=3 and a4=S.\n\nThen y5=3.\n\nThen a5=U, y6=4.\n\nThen y6=4 at turn 6 safe.\n\nTo have y4=3, with minimal actions.\n\nFrom y1=1, to y4=3, we need net +2 in 3 actions.\n\nWith u up, d down, s stay, u - d =2, u+d+s=3.\n\nPossible: u=2, d=0, s=1: for example, U,S,U or U,U,S etc., but y4=3.\n\nOr u=3,d=1,s=0: U,U,D but y4=2, not 3.\n\nSo only with s=1, u=2, d=0.\n\nFor example: a1=U, y2=2; a2=S, y3=2; a3=U, y4=3\n\nOr a1=U, y2=2; a2=U, y3=3; a3=S, y4=3\n\nOr a1=S, y2=1; a2=U, y3=2; a3=U, y4=3\n\nAll have y4=3.\n\nThen a4=S, y5=3 (if we choose S at turn 4)\n\nThen a5=U, y6=4\n\nThen from there, we can go up: a6=U, y7=5; a7=U, y8=6; a8=U, y9=7; a9=U, y10=8; a10=U, y11=9\n\nH=10.\n\nIf at turn 4, we are at y4=3, we can go U to y5=4, but turn 5 y=4 dangerous, so we must not.\n\nSo we have to stay or something.\n\nWith y4=3, a4=S, y5=3\n\na5=U, y6=4\n\netc.\n\nH=10.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, from y6=4, we go up to y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9, so 5 more actions from turn 6 to 10, but turn 6 action a6, to y7, etc., up to a10 for y11.\n\nFrom turn 5 action to turn 10 action for y11.\n\nBut let's count from start.\n\nActions: turn 1 to 10 for y11.\n\nMinimal H is 10.\n\nPerhaps we can reach higher earlier.\n\nFor example, after y6=4, we go up continuously, but we need to pass through y=5 to 8.\n\ny=5 to 8 are dangerous only at T=4, which is past, so no problem.\n\nBut we are at turn 6, T=6>4, so safe.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 1: U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: S, y4=3  (wait)\n\nTurn 4: S, y5=3  (wait again, but we have only one S for H=9, but here we have two S or one S and one something.\n\nIn this, we have two S: turn 3 S and turn 4 S.\n\nThen with 6 U: turn 1 U, turn 2 U, turn 5 U, turn 6 U, turn 7 U, turn 8 U, turn 9 U, turn 10 U? Let's list.\n\nActions:\na1=U (y2=2)\na2=U (y3=3)\na3=S (y4=3)\na4=S (y5=3)  // two S\na5=U (y6=4)\na6=U (y7=5)\na7=U (y8=6)\na8=U (y9=7)\na9=U (y10=8)\na10=U (y11=9)  // 10 actions, 8 U and 2 S.\n\nH=10.\n\nWith one S and one D, but worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can have the first wait later.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach with H=9.\n\nSuppose we go to y=3 and stay, but then go to y=4 at turn 6.\n\nWith H=9, actions turn 1 to 9, y10 position.\n\nTo have y10=9, we need to be at y=8 at turn 9 or something.\n\nBut to reach y=4 by turn 6, with 5 actions: from turn 1 to 5, position y6.\n\ny6=4.\n\nWith 5 actions, from y1=1 to y6=4, net +3.\n\nWith u up, d down, s stay, u-d=3, u+d+s=5.\n\nMinimal s and d, u=3, d=0, s=2: for example U,U,U,S,S but y6=4? a1=U y2=2, a2=U y3=3, a3=U y4=4, but y4=4 at turn 4 dangerous, collision.\n\nU,U,S,U,S: a1=U y2=2, a2=U y3=3, a3=S y4=3, a4=U y5=4, turn 5 dangerous.\n\nU,S,U,U,S: a1=U y2=2, a2=S y3=2, a3=U y4=3, a4=U y5=4 dangerous.\n\nAll have y5=4 at turn 5 dangerous.\n\nIf we have d=1, u=4, s=0: U,U,U,D,U but y6=4? a1=U y2=2, a2=U y3=3, a3=U y4=4, a4=D y5=3, a5=U y6=4, turn 6 y=4 safe, but at turn 4, when we were on y=4, turn 4 dangerous, collision at turn 4.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=4 at turn 4 or 5 with the actions.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=4 before turn 6 without collision, so minimal turn to be at y=4 safely is turn 6.\n\nThen from there, 5 up moves to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nThus minimal H=10 actions.\n\nSequence for example:\n\nTurn 1: U (to y2=2)\n\nTurn 2: U (to y3=3)\n\nTurn 3: S (to y4=3)\n\nTurn 4: S (to y5=3)  // wait at y=3 for two turns\n\nTurn 5: U (to y6=4)  // turn 6 y=4 safe\n\nTurn 6: U (to y7=5)\n\nTurn 7: U (to y8=6)\n\nTurn 8: U (to y9=7)\n\nTurn 9: U (to y10=8)\n\nTurn 10: U (to y11=9)\n\nH=10, reach at turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S, but we can have only one S if we do something else, but not possible as above.\n\nSince at turn 4, we can be at y=2 or something, but still need to go up.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 1: U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: D, y4=2  // go down\n\nTurn 4: at y=2, choose U, y5=3\n\nTurn 5: U, y6=4  // turn 6 y=4 safe\n\nThen same as before, turn 6 to 10 U to y11=9.\n\nH=10, with one D, which is worse than S.\n\nSo the first sequence with two S is fine, but we can reduce the wait by one if we start later, but no.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 1, we stay, but then we start later.\n\nTurn 1: S, y2=1\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=2\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=3\n\nTurn 4: S, y5=3\n\nTurn 5: U, y6=4\n\nThen turn 6 U y7=5, turn 7 U y8=6, turn 8 U y9=7, turn 9 U y10=8, turn 10 U y11=9, same H=10.\n\nOr, from turn 5 y6=4, but we need to reach y=9.\n\nI think H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to avoid the late dangerous times, but since we reach turn 11, which is before T=12, and T=16, no problem.\n\nT=12 is for y=4 later, but we are at y=4 at turn 6, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 6, y=4, safe; turn 7 y=5, safe since T=7>4; similarly.\n\nNow, but in the action sequence, for turn 4, we have S, but let's write the actions from turn 1.\n\nAlso, the player position at turn 1 is given, so actions start from turn 1.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: a_{t1} etc.\n\nt1=1.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nWith this, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut we can have a shorter sequence if we go down to y=0 or something, but not helpful.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster through higher rows, but we have to pass y=4.\n\nAnother thought: what about going to y=0 at some point?\n\nFor example, at turn 3, go D to y=2, then turn 4 go D to y=1, but then we are lower, need more moves.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 4 at T=12-14, but we are not there, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at T=16-19, but we are past.\n\nSo the sequence should work.\n\nTo have only one wait, but not possible.\n\nPerhaps at turn 4, we are at y=3, and we go directly to y=5? No, cannot.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the output, we need the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 3 and turn 4, we stay at y=3.\n\nBut we can choose to go down and up, but no benefit.\n\nSo let's go with that.\n\nBut in the action, for turn 4, we have S, but let's see if we can move to another row.\n\nAt turn 4, position y=3, we can go U to y=4, but dangerous at turn 5.\n\nOr go D to y=2, then turn 5 go U to y=3, turn 6 U to y=4, same as staying.\n\nNo better.\n\nSo the sequence with two S is acceptable.\n\nNow, write the actions.\n\nH=10, sequence from turn 1 to turn 10.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nWith positions:\n\nt1: y=1\n\nAfter a1=U, t2: y=2\n\na2=U, t3: y=3\n\na3=S, t4: y=3\n\na4=S, t5: y=3\n\na5=U, t6: y=4\n\na6=U, t7: y=5\n\na7=U, t8: y=6\n\na8=U, t9: y=7\n\na9=U, t10: y=8\n\na10=U, t11: y=9\n\nAll safe.\n\nAt t6: y=4, T=6, safe as computed.\n\nt7: y=5, T=7, freeway 5: at T=7, span first car [ -59+12*6, -48+72]? T=7, T-1=6, s=12, τ + s(6) = -47 +72=25, h + s(6)= -36+72=36, [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [12*7-11,84]? [12T-11,12T], T=7, [84-11,84]=[73,84], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nt8: y=6, T=8, safe.\n\netc.\n\nNo collision.\n\nAnd H=10.\n\nPerhaps we can start by staying at turn 1.\n\nBut same H.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut the problem asks for minimal H and the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S, but we can have the first action as S or something, but H same.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have only one S if we go down once, but with D and U, it takes two actions for no progress, same as two S.\n\nFor example, turn 3: D, y4=2; turn 4: U, y5=3; then turn 5: U, y6=4, same as before.\n\nThen from there, same.\n\nSo no better.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 10.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 5 to 10, all U, but we need to specify.\n\nFor the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions for each turn.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 10. This requires a sequence of actions that delays progression to avoid dangerous times on certain freeways.\n\n### Dangerous Turns Analysis\n- Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\) are dangerous at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 4\\) is dangerous at turns \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\) (from the second car) and \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\) (from the first car).\n- Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are dangerous only at turn \\(T = 4\\).\n\nSince the goal is to reach \\(y = 9\\) quickly and the dangerous times for \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\) at \\(T = 16-19\\) and \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 12-14\\) occur after the minimal achievable arrival time, only the early dangerous times (around \\(T = 4\\)) need to be avoided. Specifically:\n- Being on \\(y = 4\\) at turns \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\) causes collision.\n- Being on \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) at turn \\(T = 4\\) causes collision.\n\nThe earliest safe turn to be on \\(y = 4\\) is \\(T = 6\\), as the car spans do not include 0 at that turn. From \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 6\\), moving up to \\(y = 9\\) is safe, as \\(y = 5-8\\) are only dangerous at \\(T = 4\\) (which has passed) and \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n\n### Minimal Path with \\(H = 10\\)\nTo avoid collisions:\n- Stay at \\(y = 3\\) for turns \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 5\\) (safe row) to skip the dangerous period for \\(y = 4\\) (\\(T = 3, 4, 5\\)) and for \\(y = 5-8\\) (\\(T = 4\\)).\n- Reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(T = 6\\) (safe).\n- Then move up directly to \\(y = 9\\) by turn \\(T = 11\\).\n\nThe action sequence is:\n- **Turn 1**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as \\(y = 1\\) at \\(T = 1\\) has span \\([-56, -45]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 2**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as \\(y = 2\\) at \\(T = 2\\) has span \\([-53, -42]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 3**: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 3\\) has span \\([-50, -39]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 4**: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 4\\) has span \\([-47, -36]\\), no 0; avoids \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 4\\) and \\(y = 5-8\\) at \\(T = 4\\)).\n- **Turn 5**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 4\\) for turn 6 (safe, as \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 6\\): first car span \\([-35, -24]\\), second car span \\([1, 12]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 6**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 6\\): first car span \\([-11, 0]\\) but \\(T = 6 > 4\\), actual span at \\(T = 6\\) is \\([25, 36]\\), no 0; second car span \\([61, 72]\\), no 0).\n- **Turn 7**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 7\\): spans similar to \\(y = 5\\), no 0 at \\(T = 7\\)).\n- **Turn 8**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 8\\): no danger at \\(T = 8\\)).\n- **Turn 9**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 9\\): no danger at \\(T = 9\\)).\n- **Turn 10**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 9\\) (safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\nAfter 10 actions, at turn 11, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\). This sequence achieves the goal with minimal \\(H = 10\\), as \\(H = 8\\) is impossible due to collisions at \\(y = 4\\) or \\(y = 5-8\\) around turn 4, and \\(H = 9\\) is also impossible as it forces being on \\(y = 4\\) at a dangerous turn (e.g., turn 5).\n\n### Action Sequence\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: S \\\\\nTurn 4: S \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁=2, and I have to find a sequence of actions—up (U), down (D), or stay (S)—that moves the player vertically without getting hit by any car when the player is on a freeway row.\n\nFirst, understand the car movements. Cars move left or right at constant speeds. For collision, it only happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, the car's span includes 0 at that exact turn. Importantly, when you move to a new row, you're not considered on that row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at T+1 you're on y+1. So you only check for collision on the row you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=2 at turn 2. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. But y=9 is the goal, so we need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\ny=0 might be a safe spot, but we start at y=2, so we might need to go down or up.\n\nThe actions: U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays. y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, look at the car states.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, head -42, tail -53, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t₁), h + s(t - t₁)]? Let's see the update.\n\nThe update is given for T > t₁.\n\nAt turn t₁, for a right-moving car, span is [τ, h] with τ < h I assume? No, in the notation, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" and then Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] and Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, I think, so for right-moving, h > τ, and span is [τ, h], so as time increases, both increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is front, so h > τ, but moving left, so span [h, τ] with h decreasing? Let's see.\n\nIn left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ], which might be from high to low, but it's a set, so order might not matter, but for interval, we need min and max.\n\nProbably, the span is defined with min and max.\n\nFor collision, we care if 0 is in the interval, so we need the car's position at time T.\n\nLet me define for each car, the position of the head and tail at time T.\n\nSet t=0 as t₁=2 for simplicity, so let τ = T - t₁, time elapsed.\n\nAt τ = 0 (turn t₁), for each car.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, h = -42, τ = -53, d = right, s = 3. Since right-moving, at time τ, position: head at h + sτ, tail at τ + sτ? Tail is τ, so at τ=0, tail is -53, head is -42.\n\nAfter time τ, since moving right, tail new = τ + sτ, head new = h + sτ.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all seem right-moving except for freeway 4 which has multiple cars.\n\nList all cars.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: head -42, tail -53, right, speed 3. So at time τ, tail position: -53 + 3τ, head position: -42 + 3τ. Span: [min(-53+3τ, -42+3τ), max] but since -53+3τ < -42+3τ, so [-53+3τ, -42+3τ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-42, -53, right, 3) same as freeway 1. Probably identical.\n\nFreeway 2: (-42, -53, right, 3) same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: \n\nFirst: (-40, -51, right, 4) so at τ, [-51 + 4τ, -40 + 4τ]\n\nSecond: (-4, -15, right, 4) so [-15 + 4τ, -4 + 4τ]\n\nThird: (32, 21, right, 4) head 32, tail 21? That can't be, if tail is 21 and head 32, but moving right, head should be larger, yes 32>21, so [21 + 4τ, 32 + 4τ]\n\nBut at τ=0, [21,32], which is fine.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars\n\nFirst: (-24, -35, right, 12) tail -35, head -24, so at τ, [-35 + 12τ, -24 + 12τ]\n\nSecond: (24, 13, right, 12) tail 13, head 24, so [13 + 12τ, 24 + 12τ]\n\n13 to 24, yes.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? (-24,-35,right,12) and (24,13,right,12) same.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nSo freeways 1,2,3 each have one car identical, starting at [-53,-42] moving right at speed 3.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars: [-51,-40], [-15,-4], [21,32] all moving right at speed 4.\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 each have two cars: [-35,-24] and [13,24] moving right at speed 12.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at τ=0 (turn t₁=2).\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be 7 turns, since from y=2 to y=9, difference is 7, so if I go up every turn, I can reach in 7 turns, but I need to avoid cars on rows y=3 to y=8 during the turns.\n\ny=2 is freeway? Freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 no cars.\n\nPlayer at (0,2) at turn 2, so on row y=2, which is freeway k=2? Freeways are indexed by k, but k is the row, I think. Freeway k means row y=k.\n\nIn the table, freeway k, so for y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on row y, and y between 1 and 8, then we check if any car on that freeway has span containing 0 at turn T.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, which is safe.\n\nSince we move one row per turn at most, min turns is 7: U,U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 2 to 9.\n\nBut we might have to wait or go down if there is a car at 0 when we are on a row.\n\nSo I need to check for each row and each turn if it is safe to be there.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the times when 0 is covered change.\n\nLet me find for each freeway, the times when a car is at position 0.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway, at time τ, if there is a car with min ≤ 0 ≤ max.\n\nThen at that τ, if player is on that row, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nτ is time since t₁=2, so at turn T, τ = T - 2.\n\nTurn T corresponds to τ = T - 2.\n\nAt turn T, player position is updated, then collision checked based on that position.\n\nTurn sequence: at turn T, we are at position y_T, we choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, then for turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at the beginning of the turn, I think, before action? Let's see the game dynamics.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at (0, y_T), then we choose a_T, which determines y_{T+1}, but during turn T, we are at y_T, so collision depends on y_T at that turn.\n\nThen after action, we move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nIn the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1)\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you might move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nCollision only based on y_T at turn T.\n\nFor the path, I need that for each turn from start to end, when on a freeway row, no car covers 0 at that turn.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, no issue.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at turn 2 (τ=0).\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn H, with y_H =9.\n\nMinimal H is 7, from turn 2 to turn 8, for example, with y increasing from 2 to 9.\n\nBut let's see if that is possible.\n\nFirst, find for each row the dangerous times.\n\nStart with row y=2: freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 has one car: at τ=0, span [-53, -42]? Earlier: for freeway 2, car: head -42, tail -53, right, speed 3.\n\nSo at time τ, span: tail at -53 + 3τ, head at -42 + 3τ.\n\nSo min = -53 + 3τ, max = -42 + 3τ.\n\n0 is covered if min ≤ 0 ≤ max, so -53 + 3τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -42 + 3τ? No.\n\n0 in [min, max] iff min ≤ 0 and max ≥ 0.\n\nSo -53 + 3τ ≤ 0 and -42 + 3τ ≥ 0.\n\nSo 3τ ≤ 53 and 3τ ≥ 42, so τ ≤ 53/3 = 17.666, τ ≥ 42/3 = 14.\n\nSo τ between 14 and 17.666, so turns τ=14,15,16,17 since τ integer? τ is time elapsed, turns are discrete, so τ integer, I think.\n\nTurns are discrete, T integer, τ = T - t₁ integer.\n\nt₁=2, T integer, τ integer.\n\nSo for freeway 2, car covers 0 when τ=14,15,16,17.\n\nAt τ=14: min = -53 + 42 = -11? -53 + 3*14 = -53 + 42 = -11, max = -42 + 42 = 0.\n\n-42 + 3*14 = -42 + 42 =0, so min=-11, max=0, so 0 is included, since max=0.\n\nSimilarly τ=15: min=-53+45= -8, max=-42+45=3, 0 in [-8,3]\n\nτ=16: min=-53+48= -5, max=-42+48=6\n\nτ=17: min=-53+51= -2, max=-42+51=9, 0 in [-2,9]\n\nτ=18: min=-53+54=1, max=-42+54=12, min=1>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly τ=13: min=-53+39= -14, max=-42+39= -3, both negative, max=-3<0, not cover.\n\nSo dangerous at τ=14,15,16,17.\n\nNow, at τ=0, which is turn T=2, player is on y=2.\n\nBut at τ=0, is it dangerous? τ=0, min=-53, max=-42, both negative, not cover 0, so safe at turn 2.\n\nNow, we are at turn 2, y=2, safe.\n\nWe can choose action.\n\nIf we go up immediately, to y=3 at turn 3.\n\nFirst, for row y=3, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3: similar to 2, car (-42,-53,right,3) same as y=2? Freeway 3 has same car: (-42,-53,right,3), so same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: | 3 | (-42, -53, right, 3) | so identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo for y=3, dangerous at same τ=14,15,16,17.\n\nBut at early times, safe.\n\nNow, row y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-40,-51,right,4) so at τ, min= -51 +4τ, max= -40 +4τ\n\n0 covered if -51+4τ ≤0 and -40+4τ ≥0, so 4τ≤51, τ≤12.75, and 4τ≥40, τ≥10.\n\nSo τ=10,11,12.\n\nτ=10: min=-51+40= -11, max=-40+40=0, 0 covered.\n\nτ=11: min=-51+44= -7, max=-40+44=4\n\nτ=12: min=-51+48= -3, max=-40+48=8\n\nτ=13: min=-51+52=1>0, not cover.\n\nSecond car: (-4,-15,right,4) min= -15+4τ, max= -4+4τ\n\n0 covered if -15+4τ ≤0 and -4+4τ ≥0\n\n4τ≤15? τ≤15/4=3.75, and 4τ≥4, τ≥1.\n\nSo τ=1,2,3,4? τ≥1 and τ≤3.75, so τ=1,2,3.\n\nτ=1: min=-15+4= -11, max=-4+4=0, covered.\n\nτ=2: min=-15+8= -7, max=-4+8=4\n\nτ=3: min=-15+12= -3, max=-4+12=8\n\nτ=4: min=-15+16=1>0, not cover.\n\nThird car: (32,21,right,4) min=21+4τ, max=32+4τ, both positive for τ≥0, min=21>0, so never covers 0. Always positive, moving right.\n\nSo for freeway 4, dangerous when first car at τ=10,11,12 or second car at τ=1,2,3.\n\nSo combined, dangerous at τ=1,2,3,10,11,12.\n\nNow, row y=5, freeway 5.\n\nCars: first (-24,-35,right,12) min=-35+12τ, max=-24+12τ\n\n0 covered if -35+12τ ≤0 and -24+12τ ≥0\n\n12τ≤35, τ≤35/12≈2.916, and 12τ≥24, τ≥2.\n\nSo τ=2.\n\nτ=2: min=-35+24= -11, max=-24+24=0, covered.\n\nτ=3: min=-35+36=1>0, not cover.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) min=13+12τ, max=24+12τ, both positive, min=13>0, never cover 0.\n\nSo only dangerous at τ=2 for freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, for row y=6, freeway 6: same as y=5, cars (-24,-35,right,12) and (24,13,right,12), so only dangerous at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly y=7: same, dangerous at τ=2.\n\ny=8: same, dangerous at τ=2.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, similar to y=2 and y=3.\n\nFreeway 1: (-42,-53,right,3) so dangerous at τ=14,15,16,17.\n\nNow, summary of dangerous times for each row:\n\n- y=1: dangerous at τ=14,15,16,17\n\n- y=2: dangerous at τ=14,15,16,17\n\n- y=3: dangerous at τ=14,15,16,17\n\n- y=4: dangerous at τ=1,2,3,10,11,12\n\n- y=5: dangerous at τ=2\n\n- y=6: dangerous at τ=2\n\n- y=7: dangerous at τ=2\n\n- y=8: dangerous at τ=2\n\nτ=0 is safe for all, since player at y=2, τ=0.\n\nWe need to go from y=2 at τ=0 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe minimal path: directly up, but let's see if we can go up without being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nSince from τ=0, we start.\n\nIf we go up immediately:\n\nTurn T=2 (τ=0): at y=2, safe. Action U, so to y=3 at next turn.\n\nTurn T=3 (τ=1): at y=3. Is y=3 safe at τ=1?\n\ny=3 dangerous only at τ=14-17, τ=1 is safe. So safe. Action U, to y=4.\n\nTurn T=4 (τ=2): at y=4. Now y=4 dangerous at τ=1,2,3,10,11,12. τ=2 is dangerous for y=4.\n\nSo at τ=2, on y=4, collision!\n\nBecause at τ=2, for freeway 4, second car covers 0: min=-15+4*2= -15+8= -7, max=-4+8=4, 0 in there.\n\nAlso first car not yet, but second car does.\n\nSo collision at turn T=4 if we are on y=4.\n\nSo cannot be on y=4 at τ=2.\n\nTherefore, going straight up causes collision at turn 4.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps wait at y=2 or y=3.\n\nOr go down to y=0 or something.\n\ny=0 is safe, but it might take more turns.\n\nSince min turns is 7, but with waiting, H might be larger.\n\nBut we need minimal H, so we want to go as fast as possible, avoiding the dangerous times.\n\nNow, the dangerous spots are:\n\n- For rows 5,6,7,8: only dangerous at τ=2, which is turn T=4 (since τ=T-2, τ=2, T=4)\n\n- For row 4: dangerous at τ=1,2,3,10,11,12\n\n- For rows 1,2,3: dangerous at τ=14-17, which is later.\n\nSince we start at τ=0, and τ=2 is soon, for rows 5-8, only τ=2 is dangerous, so if we are not on them at τ=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly for row 4, multiple dangerous times.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to pass through rows 3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut we start at y=2, so we need to go to y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAt τ=2 (turn 4), if we are on y=4,5,6,7, or 8, it might be dangerous.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If on y=4 at τ=2, dangerous\n\n- If on y=5 at τ=2, dangerous\n\n- Similarly y=6,7,8 at τ=2 dangerous.\n\nBut y=3 at τ=2 is safe, since dangerous only later.\n\ny=2 at τ=2 safe.\n\nNow, at τ=2, which is turn 4, we need to not be on rows 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nRows 4 to 8 are dangerous at τ=2.\n\nBut we need to be on those rows eventually.\n\nSince only τ=2 is dangerous for rows 5-8, and for row 4, τ=2 is dangerous but also other times.\n\nTo minimize time, we can delay going to higher rows until after τ=2.\n\nτ=2 is turn 4.\n\nCurrent turn 2, τ=0.\n\nTurn 2: at y=2, safe.\n\nWe can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf we stay at y=2 for one turn.\n\nTurn 2 (τ=0): at y=2, safe. Action S, so stay at y=2 for next turn? Action S means y_{t+1} = y_t, so position same.\n\nAfter action, position updates for next turn.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T+1, position y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nSo turn 2 (τ=0): y=2, safe. Suppose we do S, then y_3 = y_2 + 0 = 2.\n\nTurn 3 (τ=1): at y=2, safe? y=2 dangerous only at τ=14-17, τ=1 safe. Action, say U, then y_4 =3.\n\nTurn 4 (τ=2): at y=3? y=3 at τ=2, is it safe? y=3 dangerous only at τ=14-17, τ=2 safe. So can be there.\n\nThen action U to y=4.\n\nBut at turn 4 (τ=2), if we go to y=4, but at turn 4, we are at y_4.\n\nIf at turn 4, we are at y=4, then τ=2, dangerous for y=4.\n\nIf we are at y=3 at turn 4 (τ=2), and we go to y=4, at turn 4 we are still on y=3, so no collision for y=4.\n\nThen at turn 5 (τ=3), we are at y=4.\n\nNow τ=3, for y=4, dangerous at τ=1,2,3,10,11,12. τ=3 is dangerous.\n\nBecause at τ=3, second car: min=-15+12= -3, max=-4+12=8, 0 covered.\n\nFirst car: min=-51+12= -39, max=-40+12= -28? τ=3, 4τ=12, min=-51+12= -39, max=-40+12= -28, both negative, not cover. But second car covers.\n\nSo at τ=3, y=4 dangerous.\n\nSo if at turn 5 (τ=3), on y=4, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAfter turn 4 at y=3, if we stay at y=3.\n\nTurn 4 (τ=2): at y=3, safe. Action S, then y_5 =3.\n\nTurn 5 (τ=3): at y=3, safe (τ=3 not dangerous for y=3). Then action U to y=4.\n\nTurn 6 (τ=4): at y=4.\n\nNow τ=4, for y=4, dangerous times τ=1,2,3,10,11,12. τ=4 not dangerous.\n\nFirst car: min=-51+16= -35? 4τ=16, min=-51+16= -35, max=-40+16= -24, both neg.\n\nSecond car: min=-15+16=1>0, max=-4+16=12, min=1>0, not cover.\n\nThird car min=21+16=37>0, safe.\n\nSo at τ=4, y=4 safe.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=5.\n\ny=5 dangerous only at τ=2.\n\nτ=4 is safe for y=5.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo let's plan a path.\n\nStart: turn 2 (τ=0): at y=2, safe. Action S (stay), so y_3 =2.\n\nTurn 3 (τ=1): at y=2, safe. Action S (stay again), y_4 =2.\n\nTurn 4 (τ=2): at y=2, safe (τ=2 not dangerous for y=2). Action U, to y=3.\n\nTurn 5 (τ=3): at y=3, safe. Action U, to y=4.\n\nTurn 6 (τ=4): at y=4, safe as above. Action U, to y=5.\n\nTurn 7 (τ=5): at y=5. y=5 dangerous only at τ=2, τ=5 safe. Action U, to y=6.\n\nTurn 8 (τ=6): at y=6. y=6 dangerous only at τ=2, τ=6 safe. Action U, to y=7.\n\nTurn 9 (τ=7): at y=7, safe. Action U, to y=8.\n\nTurn 10 (τ=8): at y=8, safe (dangerous only τ=2). Action U, to y=9.\n\nTurn 11 (τ=9): at y=9, which is goal, safe.\n\nBut at turn 11, y=9, we reached.\n\nH is number of turns? From turn t1=2 to turn when y=9.\n\nWe reached at turn 11, so H=10? Turns from t1 to t1+H-1, I think.\n\nDefine: we start at turn t1, position at turn t1.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t1 + H -1, position should be 9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t to t+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt turn t1, y_{t1} given.\n\nAction a_{t1} taken, then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1}, action a_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1+k, position y_{t1+k}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\"at turn t1 + H -1, y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), meaning that at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9)\"\n\nAlso, in answer format: actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo, for example, at turn t1, we have position, we take action a_{t1}, which affects next position.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, we have new position, take action, and so on, until turn t1 + H -1, we take action, and after that, at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nThe position is updated before the turn? Let's see the dynamics.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, we choose a_t, which sets Δy_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t for the next turn.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn t based on y_t.\n\nTo have position at turn T be (0,9), we need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe turn when we reach is T = t1 + H -1.\n\nAt that turn, we don't necessarily take an action if it's the last turn, but we do take actions up to that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, we take actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, inclusive, H actions.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}, but we want y_{t1+H-1} =9, so at turn t1+H-1, position is 9, so we don't move after that, I think, or we can, but since we reached, we stop.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9, and we might take an action, but since y=9, if we go up, y=10 invalid, but y in [0,9], so probably we should not go beyond, so action should be S or D, but since we reached, we can take S.\n\nBut in the sequence, we take action at that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, if y_T=9, we can take a_T=S to stay.\n\nIn our path, we need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I had:\n\nTurn 2 (τ=0): y=2, action S, so y3=2\n\nTurn 3 (τ=1): y=2, action S, y4=2\n\nTurn 4 (τ=2): y=2, action U, y5=3\n\nTurn 5 (τ=3): y=3, action U, y6=4\n\nBut at turn 6 (τ=4), y=4, safe, as τ=4 not dangerous for y=4.\n\nThen turn 6 (τ=4): at y=4, action U, y7=5\n\nTurn 7 (τ=5): at y=5, safe, action U, y8=6\n\nTurn 8 (τ=6): at y=6, safe, action U, y9=7\n\nTurn 9 (τ=7): at y=7, safe, action U, y10=8\n\nTurn 10 (τ=8): at y=8, safe, action U, y11=9\n\nNow at turn 11, y=9, which is the position at turn 11.\n\nWe want at turn t1 + H -1 = 2 + H -1 = H+1 to be 9.\n\nSet T = t1 + H -1 = 2 + H -1 = H+1\n\ny_T =9.\n\nHere T=11, y11=9, so H+1=11, H=10.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? From t1 to t1+H-1, that's H turns.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=2+H-1, so H actions.\n\nReach at turn 2+H-1.\n\nIn this case, reached at turn 11, so 2 + H -1 =11, thus H=10.\n\nBut is this minimal? We started by waiting two turns, so took 10 turns from start.\n\nBut we might go faster.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid waiting or go down.\n\nAnother idea: since row y=4 is dangerous at τ=1,2,3, but safe after until τ=10.\n\nSimilarly, rows 5-8 only dangerous at τ=2.\n\nSo if we can be at y=3 at τ=2, then after τ=2, we can go up quickly.\n\nAt τ=2, turn 4.\n\nIf at turn 4, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=4 at turn 5, τ=3.\n\nBut τ=3, y=4 dangerous, as we saw.\n\nCannot go to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nGo at τ=4.\n\nSo from y=3 at τ=2, if we stay at y=3 for one more turn.\n\nTurn 4 (τ=2): at y=3, action S, y5=3\n\nTurn 5 (τ=3): at y=3, safe, action U to y=4? But at turn 5 (τ=3), if we go to y=4, but at turn 5, position is y5, if y5=3, we are on y=3, safe. Then after action U, y6=4.\n\nThen turn 6 (τ=4): at y=4, which is safe.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at turn 4 (τ=2), at y=3, instead of staying, go up to y=4 immediately? But at turn 4, if we are at y=3, and action U, then y5=4, so at turn 5 (τ=3), we are at y=4, which is dangerous.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo must not be on y=4 at τ=3.\n\nTherefore, need to be at y=4 only at τ >=4 or τ=0, but τ=0 not for y=4 since we start at y=2.\n\nτ=0,1,2,3 dangerous for y=4 except τ=0 and τ=1 might be ok but τ=1,2,3 dangerous.\n\nτ=1: for y=4, dangerous.\n\nAt τ=1, turn 3, if on y=4, dangerous.\n\nIn our sequence, we avoid being on y=4 during τ=1,2,3.\n\nIn the first plan, we are on y=4 at τ=4, safe.\n\nNow, can we reach faster?\n\nSuppose we go up immediately to y=3.\n\nTurn 2 (τ=0): y=2, action U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3 (τ=1): at y=3, safe. Now, if we go to y=4, at turn 4 (τ=2), y=4 dangerous.\n\nIf we stay at y=3.\n\nTurn 3 (τ=1): at y=3, action S, y4=3\n\nTurn 4 (τ=2): at y=3, safe. Then action U to y=4 at turn 5 (τ=3), but turn 5 at y=4 dangerous.\n\nAction S again at turn 4: y5=3\n\nThen turn 5 (τ=3): at y=3, action U, y6=4 at turn 6 (τ=4), same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nGo down to y=1 or y=0.\n\nBut y=1 has cars, dangerous at τ=14-17, but early safe.\n\ny=0 no cars, safe.\n\nBut going down might take more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 2 (τ=0): y=2, action D, to y=1\n\nTurn 3 (τ=1): at y=1, which is freeway 1, dangerous only τ=14-17, τ=1 safe. Then we can stay or go down.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to go up eventually, so it might take more turns.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps from y=3 at τ=1, we can go to y=2 or something, but not helpful.\n\nSo the earlier plan with two waits at start seems necessary to avoid being on row 4-8 at τ=2.\n\nBut rows 5-8 only dangerous at τ=2, so if we can be on them before or after.\n\nBut before: at τ=0 or τ=1.\n\nτ=0: turn 2, we are at y=2.\n\nIf we could be at y=5 at τ=0, but we start at y=2, cannot.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, turn 3.\n\nAt turn 3, we could be at y=5, but from y=2, to y=5 in one turn? Impossible, max move one per turn.\n\nSo cannot be on rows 5-8 before τ=2.\n\nAfter τ=2, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly for row 4, dangerous at τ=1,2,3, so at τ=0,4,5,... safe except later dangerous times.\n\nBut later τ=10,11,12 dangerous for y=4.\n\nBut τ=10 is turn 12, which is late, so if we go early, we can avoid.\n\nIn our path, we go to y=4 at τ=4, which is before τ=10.\n\nNow, back to minimal H.\n\nIn the sequence I had, we reach at turn 11 with y=9.\n\nt1=2, at turn 11, which is t1 + 9, since 2+9=11.\n\nTurn t1 + H -1 =11, so 2 + H -1 =11, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from turn 2 to turn 11? Turn t1 to t1+H-1=11.\n\nt1=2, t1+H-1=11, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 2 to turn 11 inclusive, that's 10 turns: turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nAt turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut we can reach earlier?\n\nMinimal possible: from y=2 to y=9, need 7 moves up, but with constraints.\n\nSuppose we go up as much as possible.\n\nTurn 2 (τ=0): y=2, action U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3 (τ=1): y=3, action S (stay), y4=3\n\nTurn 4 (τ=2): y=3, action U, but to y=4? Action U would make y5=4, but at turn 4, position y4=3, safe.\n\nAfter action U, y5=4.\n\nThen turn 5 (τ=3): y=4, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf at turn 4, action S, y5=3\n\nThen turn 5 (τ=3): y=3, action U, y6=4\n\nTurn 6 (τ=4): y=4, safe, as before.\n\nThen from here, go up each turn: turn 6 action U, y7=5 at τ=5\n\nTurn 7 action U, y8=6 τ=6\n\nTurn 8 action U, y9=7 τ=7\n\nTurn 9 action U, y10=8 τ=8\n\nTurn 10 action U, y11=9 τ=9\n\nSame as before, reach at turn 11.\n\nFrom turn 6 (τ=4) y=4, we go to y=5,6,7,8,9 in 5 turns: turn 6 to 10 actions, y from 4 to 9 in 5 moves, so at turn 11 y=9.\n\nBut we started from turn 2, with delays.\n\nIs there a way to be at higher row earlier?\n\nSuppose at turn 2, we go up to y=3.\n\nThen at turn 3, y=3, we cannot go to y=4 because at turn 4 if y=4 it is dangerous, but at turn 3, we are at y=3, if we go down to y=2, then at turn 4 we are at y=2, safe, but we wasted turns.\n\nThen similar.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=4 at τ=0 or something, impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 5-8 are only dangerous at τ=2, if we can be on them at τ=2 but not on the row, but we have to be on the row if we are there.\n\nUnless we skip them or something, but we have to pass through.\n\nBut at τ=2, if we are not on rows 4-8, we are fine.\n\nIn the beginning, we can only be on y=2 or y=3 at τ=2.\n\ny=1 also, but lower.\n\nIn my first plan, I had two S at start to stay at y=2 until τ=2, then go up.\n\nBut at τ=2, turn 4, we go to y=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, turn 5, we are at y=3, and we go to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut between τ=3 and τ=4, we have a turn where we stay or something.\n\nIn the sequence: after turn 4 at y=3, we go to y=4 at turn 6 (τ=4).\n\nBut at turn 5 (τ=3), we are at y=3.\n\nNow, from y=3 to y=4, we need to move at some point.\n\nIf at turn 5 (τ=3), we are at y=3, and we do U, then at turn 6 (τ=4) y=4, safe.\n\nBut at turn 5, if we do U, y6=4, turn 6 at y=4.\n\nBut at turn 5, we are at y=3, which is fine.\n\nIn this case, with only one wait.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTurn 2 (τ=0): y=2, action U, so y3=3\n\nTurn 3 (τ=1): y=3, action S (stay), so y4=3\n\nTurn 4 (τ=2): y=3, action U, so y5=4? Action U at turn 4, y5 = y4 +1 =3+1=4\n\nThen turn 5 (τ=3): at y=4, but τ=3, dangerous for y=4, collision.\n\nIf at turn 4, action S, y5=3\n\nTurn 5 (τ=3): y=3, action U, y6=4\n\nTurn 6 (τ=4): y=4, safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo we need to stay at y=3 for one turn to avoid being on y=4 at τ=3.\n\nIn the sequence with no down, we need to wait at y=2 or y=3 for a couple of turns to delay.\n\nIn the first sequence with two S at start, we have:\n\n- Turn 2: S, y=2\n\n- Turn 3: S, y=2\n\n- Turn 4: U, y=3\n\n- Turn 5: U, y=4 but at turn 5 τ=3 y=4 dangerous? No\n\nIn that sequence:\n\nAfter turn 4: at turn 4, y=2? Let's list positions and actions clearly.\n\nDenote:\n\nTurn T | τ | y_T | action a_T | then y_{T+1}\n\nStart: Turn 2: τ=0, y=2, choose a_2\n\nSuppose a_2 = S, then y3=2\n\nTurn 3: τ=1, y=2, choose a_3\n\na_3 = S, then y4=2\n\nTurn 4: τ=2, y=2, choose a_4\n\na_4 = U, then y5=3\n\nTurn 5: τ=3, y=3, choose a_5\n\na_5 = U, then y6=4\n\nTurn 6: τ=4, y=4, choose a_6\n\na_6 = U, then y7=5\n\nTurn 7: τ=5, y=5, choose a_7\n\na_7 = U, then y8=6\n\nTurn 8: τ=6, y=6, choose a_8\n\na_8 = U, then y9=7\n\nTurn 9: τ=7, y=7, choose a_9\n\na_9 = U, then y10=8\n\nTurn 10: τ=8, y=8, choose a_10\n\na_10 = U, then y11=9\n\nNow at turn 11: y=9, which should be the position at turn t1 + H -1 = 2 + H -1 = H+1\n\nSet H+1 =11, H=10.\n\nActions from turn 2 to turn 11? t1 to t1+H-1=11, so turns 2 to 11 inclusive.\n\nNumber of actions: 10 actions.\n\nAt turn 11, y=9, reached.\n\nBut we can reduce H?\n\nSuppose we go up faster to y=3.\n\nTurn 2: y=2, action U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: τ=1, y=3, action S, y4=3\n\nNow turn 4: τ=2, y=3, action S (not U), so y5=3\n\nTurn 5: τ=3, y=3, action U, y6=4\n\nTurn 6: τ=4, y=4, action U, y7=5\n\n...\n\nThen turn 10: τ=8, y=8, action U, y11=9\n\nSame turn 11 reach.\n\nIf at turn 4, we do U, but cannot because y5=4 at τ=3 dangerous.\n\nPerhaps go to y=4 at τ=4 directly from y=3.\n\nBut we need to move at some turn.\n\nAnother point: from y=4 to y=9, 5 moves, from τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=4, then after 5 ups, at turn when y=9.\n\ny=4 at turn 6 (τ=4), then turn 6: U to y=5 at turn 7\n\nTurn 7: U to y=6 turn 8\n\nTurn 8: U to y=7 turn 9\n\nTurn 9: U to y=8 turn 10\n\nTurn 10: U to y=9 turn 11\n\nReach at turn 11.\n\nTo reach earlier, we need to be at y=4 earlier than turn 6.\n\nBut we cannot be at y=4 before τ=4 without being at dangerous τ.\n\nτ=0: turn 2, y=2\n\nτ=1: turn 3, if we were at y=4, but from y=2 to y=4 in one turn? Impossible.\n\nAt τ=1, turn 3, we can be at y=3 max.\n\nAt τ=2, turn 4, we can be at y=4 if we move, but dangerous.\n\nSo earliest to be at y=4 safely is τ=4, turn 6.\n\nThen reach y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut turn 6 to turn 11 is 6 turns? From turn 6 to turn 11, positions: turn 6 y=4, then after actions, turn 7 y=5, ..., turn 11 y=9.\n\nSo at turn 11, y=9.\n\nWe started at turn 2.\n\nNumber of turns from start: from turn 2 to turn 11, 10 turns.\n\nMinimal H=10.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose reach at turn t1 + H -1 = 2 + H -1 = H+1 =9? Set H+1=9, H=8.\n\nThen at turn 10? t1 + H -1 = 2 + 8 -1 =9, so at turn 9, y=9.\n\nNow, from turn 2 to turn 9, 8 actions.\n\nStart at y=2 turn 2.\n\nAfter 7 actions, at turn 9, y=9.\n\nNeed to go from y=2 to y=9 in 7 moves, but with constraints.\n\nSequence of 7 ups: but we have to avoid the collision points.\n\nFor example, if we do all U from turn 2:\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=4 but at turn 4 (τ=2) y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: S, y4=3\n\nThen turn 4: U, y5=4 at turn 5 τ=3, dangerous.\n\nTurn 4: S, y5=3\n\nTurn 5: U, y6=4 at τ=4 safe.\n\nThen from turn 6: U to y7=5 τ=5\n\nTurn 7: U to y8=6 τ=6\n\nTurn 8: U to y9=7 τ=7\n\nAt turn 9: y=7, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 9, we need y9=9.\n\nFrom y=2, in 7 moves: actions from turn 2 to turn 8, 7 actions, to have y9=9.\n\nAfter 7 actions, y9 = y2 + sum of 7 Δy.\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,1.\n\nTo increase by 7, need all U, but cannot due to collision.\n\nIf we have some S or D, but then net increase less, so y9 <9 if not all U.\n\nMinimal moves: to go from 2 to 9, need exactly 7 U, and no net D, but we can have S, but S doesn't change, so to increase by 7 in k turns, we need at least 7 U and k-7 S, so k >=7.\n\nWith k=7, must be 7 U, no S or D.\n\nBut with 7 U, we go: turn 2 U to y3=3\n\nTurn 3 U to y4=4 at τ=2 dangerous, impossible.\n\nWith k=8 actions: from turn 2 to turn 9, 8 actions, to have y9=9.\n\nThen net +7, so 7 U and 1 S, for example.\n\nNow, where to put the S.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=4 at τ=2 or τ=3, etc.\n\nτ=2 is turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4, if we are on y=4, dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 5, τ=3, if on y=4, dangerous.\n\nSo we need at turn 4 not on y=4, and at turn 5 not on y=4.\n\nBut since we are moving, let's list the turns and possible y.\n\nTurn 2: τ=0, y=2, must take action, say A\n\nTurn 3: τ=1, y depends on A\n\nTurn 4: τ=2, y\n\nTurn 5: τ=3, y\n\netc.\n\nWe want y9=9.\n\nWith 8 actions, net +7, so one stay and seven ups.\n\nThe stay can be at some turn.\n\nSuppose we stay at turn 2: a2=S, y3=2\n\nThen turn 3: a3=U, y4=3\n\nTurn 4: now τ=2, if a4=U, y5=4 at turn 5 τ=3 dangerous if y=4.\n\nIf a4=S, y5=3\n\nThen turn 5: a5=U, y6=4 at turn 6 τ=4 safe.\n\nThen turn 6: a6=U, y7=5\n\nTurn 7: a7=U, y8=6\n\nTurn 8: a8=U, y9=7? y9=7, not 9.\n\ny9=7, need to go to 9, but no more actions.\n\nAfter turn 8, y9=7, but we need y9=9, so with actions up to turn 8, y9 is set.\n\nTo have y9=9, with actions from turn 2 to turn 8 (7 actions?).\n\nActions from t=2 to t= t1+H-1.\n\nt1+H-1=9 for y9=9.\n\nThen actions from turn 2 to turn 9? t=2 to t=9 inclusive? t1 to t1+H-1=9.\n\nt1=2, so t=2 to 9, that's 8 actions (turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).\n\nAfter 8 actions, y10 is set, but we care about position at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, position y9.\n\ny9 depends on previous actions.\n\nStart: y2=2\n\nAfter a2, y3 = y2 + Δa2\n\nAfter a3, y4 = y3 + Δa3\n\n...\n\nAfter a8, y9 = y8 + Δa8\n\ny9 = 2 + sum_{i=2 to 8} Δa_i\n\nEach Δa_i = -1,0,1.\n\nWe want y9=9, so sum_{i=2 to 8} Δa_i =7\n\nSince 7 increases, and one no change, or 8 increases but one decrease, but decrease not good, so better 7 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, which action is S.\n\nWe need to avoid collision at each turn.\n\nFor turn 4 (τ=2): cannot be on y=4,5,6,7,8\n\nSimilarly turn 5 (τ=3): cannot be on y=4\n\nAlso, for other rows, but at early τ, only these dangerous.\n\nNow, at turn 4 (τ=2), possible safe y: y=0,1,2,3\n\ny=0,1,2,3 are safe at τ=2.\n\ny=1: dangerous only later, similarly y=2,3.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nAt turn 5 (τ=3): cannot be on y=4, dangerous.\n\ny=4 dangerous at τ=3.\n\nOther rows safe at τ=3.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence.\n\nSuppose we have a S at some point.\n\nCase 1: S at turn 2: a2=S, then y3=2\n\nThen a3=U, y4=3\n\nNow turn 4 (τ=2), y=3, safe. Action a4.\n\nIf a4=U, y5=4, but turn 5 (τ=3) y=4 dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo a4 must be S or D.\n\nIf a4=S, y5=3\n\nThen a5=U, y6=4\n\nNow turn 6 (τ=4) y=4 safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 at turn 9.\n\ny6=4, turn 6.\n\nThen from turn 6 to turn 9, we have actions a6,a7,a8 to set y7,y8,y9.\n\ny9 = y6 + Δa6 + Δa7 + Δa8 = 4 + sum\n\nWant y9=9, so sum Δ =5, so need 5 U in three actions? Impossible, max increase 3.\n\ny6=4 at turn 6, after a6, y7= y6 + Δa6 <=5\n\nAfter a7, y8<=6\n\nAfter a8, y9<=7 <9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 from y=4 in three moves.\n\ny6=4, to y9=9, need 5 moves, but only three actions, so y9 <=7.\n\nThus impossible if we have S at turn 2 or early.\n\nSuppose S at turn 3.\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\nThen a3=S, y4=3\n\nNow turn 4 (τ=2) y=3, safe.\n\nAction a4.\n\nIf a4=U, y5=4 at turn 5 τ=3 dangerous.\n\nIf a4=S, y5=3\n\nThen a5=U, y6=4\n\nThen as before, y6=4, to y9=9 impossible with three actions.\n\nIf at a4 we do D, y5=2, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nS at turn 4.\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=U, but y4=4 at turn 4 τ=2 dangerous, collision immediately at turn 4.\n\nNot possible.\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=S, y4=3\n\nThen a4=S, y5=3\n\na5=U, y6=4\n\nThen y6=4, same as before.\n\nS at turn 5.\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=U, but cannot, because if a3=U, y4=4 at turn 4 dangerous.\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=S, y4=3\n\nThen a4=U, but y5=4 at turn 5 τ=3 dangerous.\n\nIf a4=S, y5=3\n\nThen a5=S, y6=3? But we need to move.\n\na5=S, y6=3\n\nThen a6=U, y7=4 at turn 7 τ=5\n\nThen y7=4, to y9=9 need +5 in two moves, impossible.\n\nThus, with H=8, we cannot reach y=9 at turn 9, because to avoid the dangerous times, we are forced to be at low y at turn 6, and cannot reach y=9 by turn 9.\n\nFor example, earliest safe at y=4 is turn 6 (τ=4), y=4.\n\nThen from turn 6 to turn 9, we can reach y=7 max (three ups), but y=9 requires five more, so need at least turn 11 for y=9.\n\ny=4 at turn 6, after one U, turn 7 y=5, turn 8 y=6, turn 9 y=7, turn 10 y=8, turn 11 y=9.\n\nSo indeed, minimal to reach is turn 11.\n\nThus H=10, with actions as before.\n\nIn the sequence, we can write the actions.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we had two S at start.\n\nWe can have the stay later, but same time.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are safe after τ=2, we could go faster to them, but we are delayed at lower rows.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 to wait, but y=0 is safe, but then we need to come up, more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 2: D to y=1\n\nTurn 3: D to y=0\n\nThen stay at y=0 for some turns, but then need more ups to reach y=9.\n\nFor instance, from y=0 to y=9, need 9 ups, but with waiting, H larger.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1=11.\n\nt1=2, to turn 11.\n\nActions: as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, at some points we can choose different, but the actions must avoid collision.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U? But at turn 11, if we do U, y12=10, invalid, but y must be in 0-9, so probably we should not go beyond.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 11, we are at y=9, and we take action, but since we reached, we can take S.\n\nIn the action list, for turn 11, a_{11}, since we are at y=9, to stay, a_{11}=S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence above, at turn 10, y=8, we do U to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9, we do S to stay.\n\nIn my earlier list:\n\nAt turn 10: y=8, action U, y11=9\n\nThen turn 11: y=9, action, say S, to stay y12=9, but since we reach at turn 11, we don't care after, but for the action at turn 11, we need to specify.\n\nIn the answer, actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn 2 to 11.\n\nAt turn 11, we are at y=9, so we can take S or whatever, but to be safe, take S.\n\nNow, for the sequence: we have multiple S, but in the beginning.\n\nWe can have the S later, but not necessary.\n\nFor example, instead of two S at start, we can have one S at y=3.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTurn 2: U, to y3=3\n\nTurn 3: S, to y4=3 (stay)\n\nTurn 4: S, to y5=3? Action at turn 4.\n\nTurn 4 (τ=2): y=3, action S, y5=3\n\nTurn 5 (τ=3): y=3, action U, y6=4\n\nTurn 6: y=4, action U, y7=5\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 10: y=8, action U, y11=9\n\nThen turn 11: y=9, action S\n\nBut we need y9 at turn 9? No, we reach at turn 11.\n\nIn this case, same turns.\n\nTurn 2 to turn 11 actions.\n\nWith actions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U  (y10=8? Let's list y)\n\nTurn 2: a2=U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: a3=S, y4=3\n\nTurn 4: a4=S, y5=3\n\nTurn 5: a5=U, y6=4\n\nTurn 6: a6=U, y7=5\n\nTurn 7: a7=U, y8=6\n\nTurn 8: a8=U, y9=7\n\nTurn 9: a9=U, y10=8\n\nTurn 10: a10=U, y11=9\n\nTurn 11: a11=S, y12=9\n\nBut at turn 11, y=9, reached.\n\nSame as before, but with S at turn 3 and 4 instead of turn 2 and 3.\n\nIn terms of H, same.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we had S at turn 2 and 3.\n\nEither is fine.\n\nBut in the first one, we stayed at y=2, which might be safer, but y=2 is safe at those times.\n\nNow, about the cars: for row y=4, later dangerous at τ=10,11,12, but τ=10 is turn 12, which is after we passed, since at τ=4 we are on y=4, and we leave quickly.\n\nSimilarly, rows 1,2,3 dangerous at τ=14-17, turn 16-19, late.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, minimal H=10.\n\nNow, sequence of actions.\n\nI think we can write:\n\nTurn t1: S  (turn 2)\n\nTurn t1+1: S  (turn 3)\n\nTurn t1+2: U  (turn 4)\n\nTurn t1+3: U  (turn 5) to y=4? At turn 5, in first sequence, y=3, action U to y=4 at turn 6.\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\nTurn 2: S  // y stays 2\n\nTurn 3: S  // y stays 2\n\nTurn 4: U  // y to 3\n\nTurn 5: U  // y to 4\n\nBut at turn 5, after action, y6=4, but at turn 5, position is y5, which is 3, safe.\n\nThen turn 6: U // y to 5\n\n...\n\nIn the action list, we need to specify the action at each turn.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- Turn 2: action S\n\n- Turn 3: action S\n\n- Turn 4: action U\n\n- Turn 5: action U  // since from y=3 to y=4\n\n- Turn 6: action U  // to y=5\n\n- Turn 7: action U  // to y=6\n\n- Turn 8: action U  // to y=7\n\n- Turn 9: action U  // to y=8\n\n- Turn 10: action U  // to y=9\n\nThen at turn 10, action U, y11=9, so at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut turn t1+H-1=11, and we have actions up to turn 10? t1 to t1+H-1=11.\n\nH=10, t1=2, t1+H-1=2+10-1=11.\n\nActions from turn 2 to turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, we need an action.\n\nIn this, at turn 10, we do U to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9, we can do S.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nIn this, turn 5 action U: at turn 5, position y5=3 (since turn 4 U to y=3 at turn 5? Let's list positions:\n\n- Turn 2: y=2, a=S, so y3=2\n\n- Turn 3: y=2, a=S, y4=2\n\n- Turn 4: y=2, a=U, y5=3\n\n- Turn 5: y=3, a=U, y6=4\n\n- Turn 6: y=4, a=U, y7=5\n\n- Turn 7: y=5, a=U, y8=6\n\n- Turn 8: y=6, a=U, y9=7\n\n- Turn 9: y=7, a=U, y10=8\n\n- Turn 10: y=8, a=U, y11=9\n\n- Turn 11: y=9, a=S, y12=9\n\nAnd at turn 11, position is 9.\n\nAll safe: turn 4: y=2, τ=2 safe\n\nTurn 5: y=3, τ=3 safe\n\nTurn 6: y=4, τ=4 safe\n\nEtc.\n\nGood.\n\nTo save one action, but we can't.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nH=10.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1: S  (turn 2)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: S  (turn 3)\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U  (turn 4)\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U  (turn 5)\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U  (turn 6)\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U  (turn 7)\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U  (turn 8)\n\nTurn t_1 + 7: U  (turn 9)\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: U  (turn 10)\n\nTurn t_1 + 9: S  (turn 11)  // since at y=9\n\nIn the sequence, turn t_1 + 9 is turn 11.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the action at turn 11, we put S.\n\nWe could put nothing, but we need to specify.\n\nNow, I think this is fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 10. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 2\\) for two turns to avoid the dangerous times on higher freeways, particularly around \\(\\tau = 2\\) (where \\(\\tau = T - t_1\\) and \\(T\\) is the turn number).\n\n- At \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 4), freeways \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are dangerous due to car positions covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- By staying at \\(y = 2\\) for turns 2 and 3 (\\(\\tau = 0\\) and \\(\\tau = 1\\)), the player avoids being on dangerous freeways at \\(\\tau = 2\\).\n- After \\(\\tau = 2\\), the player moves up one row per turn, reaching \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turn 6), which is safe for freeway \\(y = 4\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are only dangerous at \\(\\tau = 2\\), so moving up after \\(\\tau = 2\\) is safe.\n- The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 (\\(t_1 + 9\\)), and the action at turn 11 is \"S\" to stay at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- Turn \\(t_1\\) (turn 2): Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\), which is safe at \\(\\tau = 0\\).\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\) (turn 3): Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\), which is safe at \\(\\tau = 1\\).\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 2\\) (turn 4): Up (U) to move to \\(y = 3\\), safe at \\(\\tau = 2\\).\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 3\\) (turn 5): Up (U) to move to \\(y = 4\\), safe at \\(\\tau = 3\\) (since \\(y = 4\\) is only dangerous at \\(\\tau = 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12\\), but \\(\\tau = 3\\) is dangerous; however, at turn 5, the position is \\(y = 3\\) before the action, and after the action, \\(y = 4\\) is for turn 6 at \\(\\tau = 4\\), which is safe).\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 4\\) (turn 6): Up (U) to move to \\(y = 5\\), safe at \\(\\tau = 4\\) (since \\(y = 5\\) is only dangerous at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 5\\) (turn 7): Up (U) to move to \\(y = 6\\), safe at \\(\\tau = 5\\) (since \\(y = 6\\) is only dangerous at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 6\\) (turn 8): Up (U) to move to \\(y = 7\\), safe at \\(\\tau = 6\\) (since \\(y = 7\\) is only dangerous at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 7\\) (turn 9): Up (U) to move to \\(y = 8\\), safe at \\(\\tau = 7\\) (since \\(y = 8\\) is only dangerous at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 8\\) (turn 10): Up (U) to move to \\(y = 9\\), reaching the goal at turn 11.\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 9\\) (turn 11): Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), as the goal is reached.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is never on a freeway row when a car covers \\(x = 0\\) at that turn, and it achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 10\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_1: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 9: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,2) at turn 3 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when moving to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you don't collide with cars on the new row during the move turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, based on the data. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)], where at t1, the span is [τ, h]. Since they're moving right, h is the head, so h > τ, I assume.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 4, it has three cars: (-36,-47,right,4), (0,-11,right,4), (36,25,right,4). But -47 to -36? That seems backwards. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], but in the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For example, freeway 4: (-36, -47, right, 4). Head is -36, tail is -47. Since it's right-moving, and head is greater than tail? -36 > -47, yes, so span is from tail to head, so [-47, -36] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, (0, -11, right, 4): head 0, tail -11, so span [-11, 0] at t1.\n\n(36, 25, right, 4): head 36, tail 25? 36 > 25, so span [25,36] at t1.\n\nBut tail should be less than head for right-moving, I think. In the span, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn this case, for (36,25,right,4), tail=25, head=36, so at t1, span [25,36].\n\nSimilarly, (0,-11,right,4), tail=-11, head=0, span [-11,0].\n\nAnd (-36,-47,right,4), tail=-47, head=-36, span [-47,-36].\n\nNow, at time T, since right-moving, span becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nt1 is 3, current turn.\n\nPlayer is at y=2 at turn 3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from 1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars? The problem says cars on freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars to collide with.\n\nCollision only on y=1 to 8 when on that row at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, you're not on the new row until next turn.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9, so I need to move up 7 times, but I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, but moving down might not help since I need to go up, and y=0 is safe but I start from y=2, going down to y=0 might waste turns.\n\nSince I need to minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions over time.\n\nDefine t = 0 as the turn offset from t1. So at turn t1 + t, for t=0,1,2,... where t=0 is current turn, player at y=2.\n\nI need to find actions for t from 0 to H-1, such that at some t, y_t =9, and minimal H.\n\ny_t is position at turn t1 + t.\n\nSet τ = T - t1, so τ is the number of turns after t1.\n\nAt time τ (relative to t1), for a car on freeway k, the span is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s * τ, h + s * τ] where τ is tail at t1, h is head at t1.\n\ns is speed.\n\nτ here is time offset, confusing with tail τ.\n\nUse different variable.\n\nSet Δt = T - t1, time elapsed since t1.\n\nAt time t1 + Δt, for a car:\n\nIf right-moving, span = [tail + s * Δt, head + s * Δt]\n\nSimilarly, all cars here are right-moving, based on the data.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -39, tail -50, direction right, speed 3. So at t1=3, span [-50, -39]?

Let's clarify.\n\nTurn sequence:\n\nAt turn t1 (current turn), player is at position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,2)\n\nThen, player chooses action a_{t1}\n\nThen, at turn t1+1, position updates to y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy, with Δy based on a_{t1}\n\nSimilarly, at turn t1+2, and so on.\n\nIn terms of Δt, at time Δt (after Δt turns from t1), position is at turn t1 + Δt.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it's when position is on y at that turn.\n\nSo for turn T, position y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, and freeway y_T has car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nNow, for the player path, I need y_{t1 + k} for k=0,1,2,... until reach 9.\n\nSet k from 0: at k=0, turn t1, y=2\n\nk=1, turn t1+1, y depends on action at k=0\n\netc.\n\nReach when for some k, y_{t1+k} =9.\n\nk from 0 to H-1, with y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nH is number of turns including actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nStart k=0, position at turn t1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}, but we need to reach at turn t1+H-1, I think.\n\nLet's read the task.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAt turn t1, position is given, before action? No.\n\nTypically, at turn t, position is current, then action a_t is chosen, then position updates for turn t+1.\n\nBut here, at turn t1, position is (0,2), and we choose action for turn t1, then turn t1+1, etc.\n\nAnd we need that at some turn, say turn t1 + m, position is (0,9), and m should be minimal, so H-1 = m? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nAfter H actions, we have taken H steps from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nStart: at turn t1, position y_{t1} =2\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H-2}, at turn t1 + H -1, y_{t1 + H -1} = ?\n\nThen we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd we choose a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-2} for the moves to reach that position.\n\nFor the last action, it is a_{t1 + H-1}, but the position after that would be at turn t1 + H, which is beyond if we reach at t1+H-1.\n\nI think I have a off-by-one confusion.\n\nDefine: at turn T, position y_T is given.\n\nFor turn T, we choose action a_T.\n\nThen, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy based on a_T.\n\nThe game starts at turn t1 with y_{t1} given.\n\nWe choose a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to some a_{t1 + K-1} such that after applying, at turn t1 + K, y_{t1+K} =9.\n\nThen the number of actions is K, and we reach at turn t1+K.\n\nBut the task says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nReach at turn t1 + H -1, so position at that turn is 9.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1+0} to a_{t1 + H-1}.\n\nFor example, with H actions.\n\nAt turn t1, we choose a_{t1}, then y_{t1+1} is set based on a_{t1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, we choose a_{t1+1}, and so on, up to a_{t1 + H-1}, and at turn t1 + H, y_{t1+H} is set based on a_{t1 + H-1}, but we need y at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nTurn t1 + H -1 is when we have position before action a_{t1 + H-1} is chosen? I'm messing up.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t1: (0, y_{t1})\n\nThen, for each turn, we choose action, and position updates for the next turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter choosing a_{t1 + H -1}, the position at turn t1 + H is updated.\n\nBut we need the position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, the position is already set from previous actions, and we choose a_{t1 + H -1} at that turn, but the position for that turn is fixed when we arrive.\n\nStandard way: at the beginning of turn T, position y_T is known. Then we choose a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on freeway y_T covering x=0 at turn T.\n\nThen, for turn T, we choose action a_T to move to y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t1 with y_t1 given.\n\nWe choose a_t1, which affects y_{t1+1}\n\nChoose a_{t1+1}, affects y_{t1+2}, and so on.\n\nWe need that for some turn, say turn t1 + M, y_{t1+M} =9.\n\nThen the actions are from t1 to t1 + M -1, so M actions, and we reach at turn t1 + M.\n\nThe number of turns from start to reach is M.\n\nBut the task says: minimal number of turns H, and reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo if we reach at turn t1 + K, then H-1 = K, so H = K+1.\n\nFor example, if we reach immediately at turn t1, no action needed, but here y=2 not 9, so need actions.\n\nSuppose we want to reach at turn t1, but y=2≠9, so impossible.\n\nFirst action at t1 affects y at t1+1.\n\nTo have y at turn t1 equal to 9, it must be given, but it's 2, so we need to move.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is turn t1+7, if we go up every turn.\n\nAt turn t1+7, y=9.\n\nThen actions from t1 to t1+6, 7 actions, H=7, reach at turn t1+7-1? Let's see the turn index.\n\nTurn when position is 9: let's say at turn T = t1 + M, for some M.\n\nThen actions taken at turns t1 to t1 + M -1, so M actions.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to M-1}\n\nAnd reach at turn t1 + M.\n\nBut the task says reach at turn t1 + H -1, so t1 + H -1 = t1 + M, thus H-1 = M, so H = M+1.\n\nAnd actions for t=0 to H-1, which is t=0 to M, but t from 0 to H-1, H actions? t=0 to H-1 is H values.\n\nFor example, if M=0, reach at t1, but not, so M>=1.\n\nH = M+1, number of actions is M, but in the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, which is 0 to M, that's M+1 actions? Inconsistency.\n\nLet's solve.\n\nSuppose we reach at turn T = t1 + K for some K>=0.\n\nAt K=0, turn t1, y=2≠9.\n\nK=1, turn t1+1, y could be 1,2,3 depending on action at t1.\n\nWe need y_{t1+K} =9 for some K.\n\nThe actions taken are at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+K-1, so K actions.\n\nThe sequence is a_{t1} to a_{t1+K-1}, which is for t=0 to K-1, so H=K actions, and reach at turn t1 + K.\n\nBut the task says reach at turn t1 + H -1, so t1 + H -1 = t1 + K, thus H-1 = K, so H = K+1.\n\nAnd actions for t=0 to H-1, which is t=0 to K, that's K+1 actions, but we only have K actions, contradiction.\n\nFor example, suppose K=7, reach at turn t1+7 with y=9.\n\nThen actions taken at t1 to t1+6, 7 actions.\n\nH should be such that t1 + H -1 = t1+7, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen actions for t=0 to H-1 = t=0 to 7, that's 8 actions, but we only have 7 actions for turns t1 to t1+6.\n\nMistake.\n\nThe actions are from turn t1 to turn t1 + H-1, and after these H actions, the position at turn t1 + H is set, but we need position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, we choose action a_{t1 + H-1}, which affects y at t1 + H.\n\nBut position at turn t1 + H -1 is determined by previous actions.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need to choose actions from t1 to t1 + H-2 such that after a_{t1 + H-2}, y at t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, we choose a_{t1 + H-1}, but it doesn't affect the position at that turn, only the next.\n\nSo for reaching, we don't need the last action if we are already at 9, but we have to specify the action for that turn? The sequence includes a_{t1 + H-1}, but if we are at 9, we can choose S or something.\n\nBut in this case, for reaching at turn t1 + H -1, we need the actions from t1 to t1 + H-2 to move to y=9 at turn t1 + H -1, and then a_{t1 + H-1} can be chosen, but it's part of the sequence.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn, we care about position at that turn when choosing action.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to think the position at turn t1 + i for i=0,1,2,... and for each i, y_i must be safe if between 1 and 8.\n\nAnd we start with i=0, y0=2.\n\nActions a_{t1 + i} for i=0 to H-1, and after H actions, position at turn t1 + H is set, but we need position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9, so for i=H-1, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen for i from 0 to H-2, we have positions y_{t1+i}, and actions affect the next position.\n\nAt turn t1 + i, position y_{t1+i}, then we choose a_{t1+i}, which sets y_{t1+i+1} = y_{t1+i} + Δy.\n\nThen for collision, at turn t1+i, if y_{t1+i} in 1-8, must not have car on that freeway covering 0 at that turn.\n\nThen we need for some i, y_{t1+i} =9.\n\nLet i be the index from start, i=0 at turn t1.\n\nPosition y_i at turn t1+i.\n\nWe need y_m =9 for some m.\n\nActions a_i for i=0 to m-1 to reach y_m=9.\n\nNumber of actions m.\n\nThen in the sequence, actions from t=0 to m-1 for relative t.\n\nBut the task has H such that reach at turn t1 + H -1, so t1 + H -1 = t1 + m, so H-1 = m, H = m+1.\n\nActions for t=0 to H-1, which is t=0 to m, that's m+1 actions, but we only have m actions, so the last action a_m is for turn t1+m, but at turn t1+m, if we are at y_m=9, we choose a_m, which might move us away, but we need to be at 9 at that turn, so we should choose S or something to stay.\n\nBut the position is at the turn before action.\n\nI think there's a misunderstanding.\n\nTo simplify, I'll define the position at time k relative to t1.\n\nSet k = 0: turn t1, position y=2\n\nThen at turn k, position y_k.\n\nChoose action a_k, which determines y_{k+1} = y_k + delta, with delta based on a_k.\n\nFor collision, at turn k, if y_k in 1-8, must be safe, i.e., no car on freeway y_k covering 0 at turn k.\n\nWe need y_k =9 for some k.\n\nLet the first k where y_k=9 be the arrival turn.\n\nThen actions from a_0 to a_{k-1} are chosen to reach that.\n\nNumber of actions: k.\n\nThen in the sequence, for the task, we have actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and position at turn t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nSo turn t1 + H -1 = t1 + k, so H-1 = k, thus H = k+1.\n\nActions for t=0 to H-1, which is from a_{t1+0} to a_{t1 + H-1} = a_{t1} to a_{t1 + k}, since H-1 = k, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+k}.\n\nBut we only have actions up to a_{t1+k-1} for reaching at k, so a_{t1+k} is extra.\n\nFor example, if we reach at k=7, turn t1+7, position 9.\n\nThen actions taken: a_{t1} to a_{t1+6} to move from y0=2 to y7=9.\n\n7 actions.\n\nThen H-1 =7, H=8.\n\nActions for t=0 to 7: a_{t1} to a_{t1+7}, 8 actions.\n\nBut a_{t1+7} is chosen at turn t1+7 when position is 9, so we can choose S to stay, but it's not necessary for reaching, but the sequence includes it.\n\nSimilarly, in the collision check, at turn t1+7, if y=9, no collision since not on freeway.\n\nSo it's fine.\n\nFor the path, we need to specify actions until we reach, including the action at the reach turn if we stay.\n\nBut in this case, for the reaching turn, we are already at 9, so action can be S or U or D, but to stay, S.\n\nBut the position at that turn is 9 before action.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll compute the path to reach y=9 as soon as possible, and the actions to get there.\n\nThen for the sequence, since we need to include action at the arrival turn, we can set it to S.\n\nBut let's first find the minimal H such that we can be at 9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nStart with k=0, y=2.\n\nTo be at y=9 at k=7, for example.\n\nNow, back to the car occupancy.\n\nPlayer at y=2 at k=0 (turn t1)\n\nFreeway y=2 occupied at k=13,14,15,16, not at k=0, so safe.\n\nIf I go up at each step, from k=0 to k=6, actions U, then at k=7, y=9.\n\nNow, I need to check for each k from 0 to 6, the position y_k, and if in 1-8, is it safe at that k.\n\nAt k=0, y=2, freeway 2, occupied at k=13-16, not at 0, so safe.\n\nAction a0 = U, then at k=1, y=3\n\nAt k=1, y=3, freeway 3, occupied at k=13-16, not at 1, so safe.\n\nAction a1 = U, k=2, y=4\n\nAt k=2, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at k=0,1,2,9,10,11.\n\nAt k=2, occupied, so if on y=4 at k=2, collision.\n\nYes, so at turn k=2, if y=4, collision because freeway 4 occupied at Δt=2.\n\nΔt is k, relative to t1.\n\nSo at k=2, y=4 not safe.\n\nTherefore, cannot be on y=4 at k=2.\n\nIn the direct path, at k=2, we are at y=4 if we went up twice, but it's occupied.\n\nSo collision.\n\nNeed to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps go up slower or down.\n\nBut we need to reach fast.\n\nMinimum 7 turns to reach, but may take more.\n\nFirst, let's list the occupancy per freeway per k.\n\nk from 0 up.\n\nFreeway y=1: occ at k=13,14,15,16\n\ny=2: occ at k=13,14,15,16\n\ny=3: occ at k=13,14,15,16\n\ny=4: occ at k=0,1,2,9,10,11\n\ny=5: occ at k=1\n\ny=6: occ at k=1\n\ny=7: occ at k=1\n\ny=8: occ at k=1\n\nNow, player path: start at k=0, y=2, safe.\n\nNow, at k=0, choose action to go to y at k=1.\n\nOptions: U to y=3, D to y=1, S to y=2.\n\ny=1 at k=1: freeway 1 occupied at k=13-16, not at 1, so safe.\n\ny=2 at k=1: freeway 2, occ only at k=13-16, not 1, safe.\n\ny=3 at k=1: similarly safe.\n\nBut we want to go up.\n\nNow at k=2, we need to be not on y=4, because occupied.\n\nSo at k=2, y must not be 4.\n\nPossible positions at k=2: from previous.\n\nIf at k=1, y=3, then action at k=1: U to y=4, D to y=2, S to y=3.\n\nBut at k=2, y=4 not allowed.\n\nSo from y=3 at k=1, cannot go U, because y=4 at k=2 collision.\n\nCan go D to y=2, or S to y=3.\n\nSimilarly, if at k=1 y=2, can go U to y=3, D to y=1, S to y=2.\n\nIf at k=1 y=1, can go U to y=2, D to y=0, S to y=1.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nAt k=2, we need to avoid y=4.\n\nAlso, later at k=1, for y=5,6,7,8 occupied, but at k=1, if on y=5,6,7,8, collision.\n\nFor example, at k=1, if player is on y=5, freeway 5 occupied at k=1, so collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8 at k=1.\n\nSo at k=1, player cannot be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, at k=0, player is at y=2, not 5-8.\n\nAt k=1, y must not be 5,6,7,8.\n\nPossible y at k=1: from start y=2, action U to y=3, D to y=1, S to y=2.\n\nNone of 5-8, so all possible, but we need to consider future.\n\nNow, back to k=2.\n\nAt k=2, y cannot be 4 because occupied.\n\nAlso, cannot be on y=5,6,7,8 if occupied, but y=5-8 occupied only at k=1, not at k=2, so at k=2, y=5,6,7,8 are safe, except that we may not be able to reach them yet.\n\nAt k=2, from start, y could be from 0 to 4, but not 4, so 0,1,2,3.\n\ny=0,1,2,3 possible at k=2.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 fast, we should aim high.\n\nBut at k=2, we can be at y=3, for example.\n\nThen from there.\n\nAlso, at k=9,10,11, y=4 occupied, so we need to avoid y=4 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3 occupied at k=13-16.\n\nBut k=13-16 might be later, if we can reach before, no problem.\n\nFirst, can we reach by k=7?\n\nAt k=7, y=9, safe.\n\nBut to be there, we need to be at y=8 at k=6, or something.\n\nLet's list positions over time.\n\nStart k=0, y=2\n\nAt k=1, y can be 1,2,3 (since from 2, U:3, D:1, S:2)\n\nBut at k=1, if y=5,6,7,8 collision, but we can't be there from y=2 in one step, so ok.\n\nNow at k=1, suppose we go to y=3 (U from start).\n\nThen at k=1, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at k=1, action: cannot go U to y=4 at k=2, because occupied.\n\nSo must go D or S.\n\nGo D to y=2 at k=2, or S to y=3 at k=2.\n\nIf go S, y=3 at k=2.\n\ny=3 at k=2: freeway 3 occupied only at k=13-16, not 2, so safe.\n\nThen at k=2, y=3.\n\nAction at k=2: can go U to y=4, but at k=3, what is y=4 occupied?\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at k=0,1,2,9,10,11.\n\nAt k=3, not occupied, since k=3 not in {0,1,2,9,10,11}, so at k=3, y=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, k=4 to 8, y=4 should be safe, except later k=9,10,11.\n\nBut at k=3, not occupied.\n\nSo from y=3 at k=2, can go U to y=4 at k=3.\n\ny=4 at k=3 should be safe.\n\nConfirm: freeway 4 at k=3 (Δt=3), not in occupied times, so safe.\n\nThen at k=3, y=4, safe.\n\nNow, action at k=3: can go U to y=5.\n\ny=5 at k=4? k=4, position.\n\nAt turn k=3, y=4, choose action.\n\nIf U, y_{k=4} =5\n\nAt k=4, y=5, freeway 5 occupied only at k=1, not at k=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, can go to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 at k=4? From y=4, one U to y=5 at k=4.\n\nNeed to reach y=9.\n\nFrom k=3, y=4, go U to y=5 at k=4.\n\nThen at k=4, y=5, safe.\n\nAction U to y=6 at k=5.\n\nAt k=5, y=6, freeway 6 occupied only at k=1, not 5, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at k=6.\n\nAt k=6, y=7, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at k=7.\n\nAt k=7, y=8, freeway 8 occupied only at k=1, not 7, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at k=8.\n\nAt k=8, y=9, safe.\n\nBut we reach at k=8, which is turn t1+8.\n\nEarlier we wanted k=7.\n\nk=8 is later.\n\nFrom start, we wasted some time.\n\nk=0: y=2\n\nk=1: y=3 (after U)\n\nk=2: y=3 (after S, since we couldn't go U)\n\nIn this path: k=0: y=2\n\na0=U, y1=3\n\nAt k=1, y=3, a1=S, y2=3\n\nThen a2=U, y3=4\n\na3=U, y4=5\n\na4=U, y5=6\n\na5=U, y6=7\n\na6=U, y7=8\n\na7=U, y8=9\n\nSo reached at k=8.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAt k=1, instead of S, we could go D to y=2.\n\nk=0: y=2, a0=U, y1=3\n\nThen at k=1, a1=D, y2=2\n\nAt k=2, y=2, safe (not occupied)\n\nThen action at k=2: can go U to y=3 at k=3.\n\ny=3 at k=3: freeway 3, occ at k=13-16, not 3, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at k=4.\n\ny=4 at k=4: not occupied (occ at 0,1,2,9,10,11, k=4 not), safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at k=5, etc., same as before, reach y9 at k=8 or later.\n\nNo gain.\n\nFrom k=0, go D to y=1 at k=1.\n\ny=1 at k=1: freeway 1, occ at k=13-16, not 1, safe.\n\nThen at k=1, action: can go U to y=2 at k=2.\n\nAt k=2, y=2, safe.\n\nThen U to y=3 at k=3, safe.\n\nU to y=4 at k=4, safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at k=5, etc., again to y9 at k=8 or k=9 if start from lower.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo with direct up, we had problem at k=2 y=4.\n\nBut if we can be at different y at k=2.\n\nFor example, at k=0, go S, so y=2 at k=1.\n\nThen at k=1, y=2, action: can go U to y=3 at k=2.\n\nAt k=2, y=3, safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nOr go S to y=2 at k=2, then U to y=3 at k=3, then U to y=4 at k=4, etc., reach later.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo to reach faster, we need to be higher earlier, but at k=2 we cannot be at y=4, so maximum at k=2 is y=3.\n\nFrom y=2 at k=0, after two actions, at k=2, y can be: if U then U, y=4 but occupied; U then D, y=2; U then S, y=3; D then U, y=2 (from y=2, D to y=1 at k=1, then U to y=2 at k=2); S then U, y=3; etc. So possible y at k=2: 1,2,3.\n\nMax y=3 at k=2.\n\nThen at k=3, from y=3, can go U to y=4 at k=3, which is safe as above.\n\nThen from y=4 at k=3, to y=5 at k=4, y=6 at k=5, y=7 at k=6, y=8 at k=7, y=9 at k=8.\n\nSo earliest reach at k=8.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=4 earlier? At k=2 not possible because occupied.\n\nAt k=1, y=4? From start, at k=0 y=2, cannot reach y=4 in one step, max y=3.\n\nSo y=4 not possible at k=1.\n\nThus, cannot be at y=4 before k=3.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9, from y=4 at k=3, need 5 more steps: to y5 k4, y6 k5, y7 k6, y8 k7, y9 k8.\n\nMinimum k=8 to reach.\n\nBut perhaps we can skip some or go faster later, but no, each step changes by 1, so from y=4 to y=9, 5 steps, at k=8.\n\ny at k=3 min is 4 if we go up, but we can be lower, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal to reach at k=8.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be at y=5 at some point.\n\nAt k=1, y=5 impossible from start.\n\nAt k=2, from start, max y=3 or 4 but 4 not safe, so y=3.\n\nThen at k=3, y=4.\n\nAt k=4, y=5, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the occupancy at later times? For example, when going up, at k=4, y=5, but freeway 5 occupied only at k=1, not at k=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt k=9,10,11, y=4 occupied, but if we are on y=4 at those times, collision, but in this path, at k=3 we are on y=4, k=3 not 9, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1,2,3 at k=13-16, but we are at higher y earlier, so no issue.\n\nSo with 8 steps, we can reach.\n\nBut H: reach at k=8, so turn t1+8.\n\nIn terms of H, reach at turn t1 + H -1 = t1+8, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1=8, 9 actions.\n\nk from 0 to 8, position at k=8 is 9.\n\nActions at k=0 to 7 to get there.\n\nIn sequence: actions for turn t1 to t1+7, 8 actions, then position at t1+8 is 9.\n\nThen for the task, reach at turn t1 + H -1 = t1+8, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to 8, for turns t1 to t1+8.\n\nAt turn t1+8, we need to specify action, but position at t1+8 is after action? Position at turn t1+8 is set by previous action, and we choose action at t1+8.\n\nBut since we are at y=9, we can choose S.\n\nBut in the path above, we reach position at turn t1+8.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I go down first or something, but unlikely.\n\nAnother idea: since at k=1, y=5,6,7,8 are dangerous, but we are not there.\n\nBut for example, if I could be at y=4 at k=1, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps use the fact that when moving, you are not on the new row until next turn.\n\nBut in this case, not helpful.\n\nAnother point: at k=0, if I go U to y=3 at k=1.\n\nThen at k=1, if I go U, I would go to y=4 at k=2, but at k=2, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go D to y=2 at k=2.\n\nThen at k=2, y=2.\n\nThen I can go U to y=3 at k=3.\n\nThen to y=4 at k=4, etc., same as before, reach at k=8.\n\nAt k=1, y=3, I go S to y=3 at k=2.\n\nThen at k=2, y=3, go U to y=4 at k=3, same.\n\nSo I think k=8 is minimum.\n\nBut let's list the actions for a path.\n\nPath: start k=0, y=2\n\nAction a0 = U, to y=3 at k=1\n\nAt k=1, y=3, action a1 = S, to y=3 at k=2? Action at turn k=1 affects y at k=2.\n\nAt turn k=1, position y=3, choose action.\n\nIf choose S, then y_{k=2} = y_{k=1} + 0 = 3\n\nIf U, y_{k=2} =4, but not safe.\n\nSo choose S, so y_{k=2} =3\n\nThen at turn k=2, position y=3, choose action U, so y_{k=3} =4\n\nAt k=3, y=4, choose U, y_{k=4} =5\n\nAt k=4, y=5, choose U, y_{k=5} =6\n\nAt k=5, y=6, choose U, y_{k=6} =7\n\nAt k=6, y=7, choose U, y_{k=7} =8\n\nAt k=7, y=8, choose U, y_{k=8} =9\n\nReach at k=8.\n\nActions: at turn t1: U (a0)\n\nTurn t1+1: S (a1)\n\nTurn t1+2: U (a2)\n\nTurn t1+3: U (a3)\n\nTurn t1+4: U (a4)\n\nTurn t1+5: U (a5)\n\nTurn t1+6: U (a6)\n\nTurn t1+7: U (a7)\n\nPosition at turn t1+8 is 9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to reach at turn t1 + H -1 = t1+8, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to 8, which is turns t1 to t1+8.\n\nBut at turn t1+8, we are at position 9, and we choose action, say S.\n\nBut the position at turn t1+8 is already 9, so we don't need to move, but we specify action for that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 9 actions.\n\nThe minimal H is 9.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go down first.\n\nAt k=0, y=2, go D to y=1 at k=1.\n\nAt k=1, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at k=1, go U to y=2 at k=2.\n\nAt k=2, y=2, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=3 at k=3.\n\nU to y=4 at k=4.\n\netc., same as before, but now at k=2 y=2, then to y=3 at k=3, y=4 at k=4, y=5 at k=5, ..., y=9 at k=9, worse, reach at k=9.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt k=1, from y=1, go U to y=2 at k=2, same as above.\n\nOr go S to y=1 at k=2, then later, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=4 at k=3, but as before.\n\nAnother idea: since at k=1, for freeways y=5,6,7,8 are occupied, but if we are on y=4 at k=1, but we cannot, min y at k=1 is 1, max 3.\n\ny=4 not reachable.\n\nPerhaps we can move to a row when it is safe.\n\nFor example, at k=0, y=2 safe.\n\nAt k=1, if we go to y=4, impossible.\n\nOr, at k=3, y=4 is safe, as we have.\n\nBut we need to go through y=5 to 8.\n\nAt k=4, y=5 safe, etc.\n\nBut at k=1, y=5 is occupied, but we are not there.\n\nI think 8 steps is minimum.\n\nBut let's check if we can reach at k=7.\n\nTo be at y=9 at k=7, need to be at y=8 at k=6 or something.\n\nAt k=6, position y must be 8 or 9, but from start, in 6 steps, max y=2+6=8.\n\nSo at k=6, y=8 possible if all U.\n\nThen at k=7, y=9.\n\nNow, check positions.\n\nAt k=0, y=2 safe.\n\nAction U, to y=3 at k=1.\n\nAt k=1, y=3 safe (not occupied).\n\nThen action U, to y=4 at k=2.\n\nBut at k=2, y=4 occupied! Collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf at k=1, we don't go U, but S or D, then at k=2, y<=3, then at k=2, go U to y=4 at k=3? At k=3, y=4 safe, but at k=3, y=4, then need to go to y=8 at k=6? From y=4 at k=3 to y=8 at k=6, in 3 steps, possible: U,U,U to y=7 at k=6? Let's see.\n\nk=3: y=4\n\nAction U, to y=5 at k=4\n\nU to y=6 at k=5\n\nU to y=7 at k=6\n\nThen at k=6, y=7, action U to y=8 at k=7\n\nThen at k=7, y=8, need to go to y=9 at k=8, but we want at k=7 y=9.\n\nAt k=6, y=7, to y=8 at k=7, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at k=7, need at k=6 y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf y=8 at k=6, then U to y=9 at k=7.\n\nBut from start to k=6, y=8.\n\nPath: all U from k=0 to k=5, but at k=2, y=4 occupied.\n\nk=0: U to y=3 at k=1\n\nk=1: U to y=4 at k=2 → collision at k=2.\n\nIf at k=1, go S to y=3 at k=2, then at k=2 y=3, U to y=4 at k=3.\n\nThen k=3 y=4, U to y=5 at k=4, U to y=6 at k=5, U to y=7 at k=6, then U to y=8 at k=7, U to y=9 at k=8. Reach at k=8.\n\nTo have y=8 at k=6, need from k=0 to k=5, 6 actions, to y=8.\n\nBut from y=2, in 5 actions, max y=2+5=7, at k=5? Positions: after 0 actions, k=0 y=2\n\nAfter 1 action, k=1 y=3 (if U)\n\nAfter 2 actions, k=2 y=4\n\nBut cannot.\n\nAfter 3 actions, max y=5 at k=3? k=0: start, after a0, at k=1 y=3; after a1, at k=2 y=4; after a2, at k=3 y=5.\n\nBut at k=2, y=4 occupied if we go directly.\n\nBut we cannot avoid that in direct path.\n\nAfter 4 actions, at k=4 y=6 possible? From start: a0 U, k1 y3; a1 U, k2 y4 (but collision); or a1 S, k2 y3; a2 U, k3 y4; a3 U, k4 y5; then after 4 actions, at k=4 y=5.\n\nTo y=6 at k=4? Need to be at y=5 at k=3, then U.\n\nBut at k=3, max y=4 if we go up, y=4 at k=3.\n\nThen U to y=5 at k=4.\n\nSo at k=4, y=5.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be higher earlier.\n\nThus, impossible to be at y=8 before k=6, but at k=6, if y=8, then at k=7 y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at k=6: after 6 actions, at k=6.\n\nAfter 0 actions, k=0 y=2\n\nAfter 1, k=1 y= up to 3\n\nAfter 2, k=2 y= up to 3 or 4 but 4 not safe, so 3\n\nAfter 3, k=3 y=4\n\nAfter 4, k=4 y=5\n\nAfter 5, k=5 y=6\n\nAfter 6, k=6 y=7\n\nThen U to y=8 at k=7, U to y=9 at k=8.\n\nTo have y=8 at k=6, need after 6 actions y=8, but from above, after 6 actions, y<=7, since at k=2 y<=3, then +4 steps to y=7 at k=6.\n\nCannot reach y=8 at k=6.\n\nThus, cannot reach before k=8.\n\nSo minimal to reach at k=8.\n\nThus H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions for turns t1 to t1+8.\n\nIn the path, actions from turn t1 to t1+7 to reach position at t1+8=9.\n\nThen at turn t1+8, we need action, say S.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t1: U (to go to y=3)\n\nTurn t1+1: S (to stay at y=3 for k=2? Let's list turn by turn with actions.\n\nTurn: at turn t1, position given y=2.\n\nChoose action a_{t1}\n\nThen position at turn t1+1: y=3 if a_{t1}=U\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position y=3, choose a_{t1+1}\n\nIf a_{t1+1}=S, then position at turn t1+2: y=3\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn terms of collision: at each turn, when we are at position, check collision.\n\nFor example, at turn t1 (k=0), position y=2, freeway 2, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_{t1} = U\n\nThen at turn t1+1 (k=1), position y=3, freeway 3, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+1} = S\n\nThen at turn t1+2 (k=2), position y=3, freeway 3, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+2} = U\n\nThen at turn t1+3 (k=3), position y=4, freeway 4, at Δt=3, not occupied (since occ at 0,1,2,9,10,11), safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+3} = U\n\nThen at turn t1+4 (k=4), position y=5, freeway 5, occupied only at Δt=1, not at 4, safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+4} = U\n\nThen at turn t1+5 (k=5), position y=6, freeway 6, occupied only at Δt=1, not at 5, safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+5} = U\n\nThen at turn t1+6 (k=6), position y=7, freeway 7, occupied only at Δt=1, not at 6, safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+6} = U\n\nThen at turn t1+7 (k=7), position y=8, freeway 8, occupied only at Δt=1, not at 7, safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+7} = U\n\nThen at turn t1+8 (k=8), position y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nWe are at y=9 at turn t1+8.\n\nFor the sequence, we need to reach at turn t1 + H -1 = t1+8, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to 8: a_{t1} to a_{t1+8}\n\nIn the above, we have actions up to a_{t1+7}, which sets position at t1+8.\n\nAt turn t1+8, position is 9, we need to specify action for that turn, but since we are already at 9, we can choose S.\n\nSo add a_{t1+8} = S\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions for 9 turns.\n\nBut minimal H is 9.\n\nIn the answer format, we need to list the actions.\n\nt1=3.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S  (turn t1+1)\n\nTurn 5: U  (t1+2)\n\nTurn 6: U  (t1+3)\n\nTurn 7: U  (t1+4)\n\nTurn 8: U  (t1+5)\n\nTurn 9: U  (t1+6)\n\nTurn 10: U  (t1+7)\n\nTurn 11: S  (t1+8)\n\nPosition at turn 11 is 9.\n\nReach at turn t1 + H -1 = 3 + 9 -1 = 11, yes.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut is there a path with fewer actions?\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the S at k=1.\n\nFor example, at k=0, go U to y=3 at k=1.\n\nThen at k=1, instead of S, go D to y=2 at k=2.\n\nThen at k=2, y=2, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=3 at k=3.\n\nThen U to y=4 at k=4.\n\n...\n\nThen at k=4 y=4? k=3 y=3, U to y=4 at k=4.\n\nThen U to y=5 at k=5, ..., to y=8 at k=8, U to y=9 at k=9.\n\nReach at k=9, worse.\n\nFrom y=2 at k=2, go U to y=3 at k=3, same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nAt k=1, go to y=1, then up, slower.\n\nSo the first path with S at turn 4 (t1+1) is better.\n\nBut in that path, we have a S which costs a turn.\n\nCan we go directly without staying?\n\nFor example, at k=0, go S to y=2 at k=1.\n\nThen at k=1, y=2, go U to y=3 at k=2.\n\nAt k=2, y=3, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=4 at k=3, safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut we reached y=3 at k=2, same as when we went U then S.\n\nIn U then S: at k=1 y=3, k=2 y=3.\n\nIn S then U: at k=1 y=2, k=2 y=3.\n\nSo at k=2, same position.\n\nThen from there same.\n\nBut in S then U, we used two actions to go from k=0 to k=2 with y=3, same as U then S.\n\nBut in U then S, at k=1 we are at y=3, which is higher than in S then U where at k=1 y=2.\n\nBut since we stay at k=2 y=3 same.\n\nNo difference.\n\nThus, minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, with t1=3.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S  (since at turn 4, position is y=3, we choose S to stay? In the action, at turn 4, position y=3, we choose action to set next position.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 4 (t1+1), we chose S, so position at turn 5 is still 3.\n\nThen at turn 5, choose U, position at turn 6 is 4, and so on.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list for each turn the action.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 4 has a car at (0,-11,right,4) which at Δt=0 covers 0, but at turn t1, Δt=0, freeway y=4 is occupied, but player is on y=2, not affected.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think the path is fine.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn t1+8, we have action S.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nTurn t1: U\n\nTurn t1+1: S\n\nTurn t1+2: U\n\nTurn t1+3: U\n\nTurn t1+4: U\n\nTurn t1+5: U\n\nTurn t1+6: U\n\nTurn t1+7: U\n\nTurn t1+8: S\n\nWith t1=3.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut at turn 11, action S, position at turn 12 is still 9, but we reach at turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence, since we specify actions up to turn t1+8, and position at turn t1+8 is 9, which is turn 11.\n\nIn the action at turn 11, we choose S, but it doesn't affect the reaching at turn 11.\n\nThe sequence is correct.\n\nTo save the last action, but we have to include it since H=9 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can not have the last action, but according to the task, we need to specify actions until the reaching turn or including.\n\nIn the path, with 8 actions, we reach at turn 11 with position 9, and the 8 actions are for turns 3 to 10.\n\nThen at turn 11, position is 9, we don't need to act, but the sequence must include action for that turn? The task says sequence for t=0 to H-1 to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, with 8 actions, reach at turn t1+8.\n\nSet: actions a3 to a10 (8 actions), position at turn 11 is 9.\n\nThen reach at turn 11 = t1+8.\n\nThen H-1=8, so H=9? t1+H-1=3+H-1=11, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 8, which includes a3 to a11? t=0: a_{t1+0}=a3, t=1: a4, ..., t=8: a_{t1+8}=a11.\n\nBut a11 is for turn 11, when position is already 9.\n\nSo we must include it.\n\nSimilarly in the sequence.\n\nSo it's fine.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=8.\n\nIf H=8, reach at turn t1+7.\n\nt1+7=10.\n\nCan we be at y=9 at turn 10?\n\nThat means position at turn 10 is 9.\n\nThen from start, in 7 steps? From turn 3 to turn 10, 7 actions? Turns: actions at turn 3 to turn 9 (7 actions), position at turn 10 is 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 10.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn 3, to y=9 at turn 10, in 7 steps.\n\nBut as before, at turn 5 (k=2), if y=4, occupied, cannot.\n\nIf we avoid, at turn 5, y cannot be 4.\n\nBut at turn 5, k=2 relative? Turn t1 + Δt, at turn 5, Δt=2 since t1=3.\n\nTurn 3: Δt=0, turn 4: Δt=1, turn 5: Δt=2, etc.\n\nAt Δt=2, turn 5, if on y=4, collision.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 10, which is Δt=7.\n\nAt Δt=7, y=9.\n\nBut from Δt=0 y=2, in 7 steps to y=9, must go up 7 times, no down or stay.\n\nBut at Δt=2, turn 5, position must be y=4 if all up, but occupied, collision.\n\nIf we go slower, we cannot reach y=9 by Δt=7.\n\nFor example, at Δt=2, y=3, then at Δt=3 y=4, Δt=4 y=5, ..., Δt=7 y=8, not 9.\n\nAt Δt=7 y=8, then to y=9 at Δt=8.\n\nCannot be at y=9 at Δt=7.\n\nThus, impossible with H=8.\n\nH=9 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal \\(H\\) is 9, meaning the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 3 + 9 - 1 = 11\\).\n\nThe actions are chosen to avoid collisions based on the car positions and movements:\n- At turn 3 (current turn), the player is at (0, 2). Freeway 2 is not occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 3\\)), so moving up to \\(y = 3\\) is safe.\n- At turn 4, the player is at (0, 3). Freeway 3 is not occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\), but moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) would cause a collision (freeway 4 is occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\)). Therefore, staying at \\(y = 3\\) avoids the collision.\n- At turn 5, the player is at (0, 3). Freeway 4 is not occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) (since \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) corresponds to turn 5, and freeway 4 is occupied only at \\(\\Delta t = 0, 1, 2, 9, 10, 11\\); at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\), it is occupied, but the player is on \\(y = 3\\), not \\(y = 4\\), so no collision). Moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\) is safe (freeway 4 not occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\)).\n- From turns 6 to 10, moving up each turn is safe because:\n  - At turn 6, \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\): freeway 4 not occupied.\n  - At turn 7, \\(y = 5\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\): freeway 5 occupied only at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\), not at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\).\n  - At turn 8, \\(y = 6\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 5\\): freeway 6 occupied only at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\), not at \\(\\Delta t = 5\\).\n  - At turn 9, \\(y = 7\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 6\\): freeway 7 occupied only at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\), not at \\(\\Delta t = 6\\).\n  - At turn 10, \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 7\\): freeway 8 occupied only at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\), not at \\(\\Delta t = 7\\).\n- At turn 11, the player is at (0, 9). Since \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway, it is always safe. The action is \"S\" (stay) to remain at (0, 9), but any action could be chosen as the goal is reached.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 3 to 11 (i.e., \\(a_{t_1 + t}\\) for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(8\\)) is:\n\n- Turn 3: U (move up to \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 4: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\) to avoid collision at \\(y = 4\\) on turn 5)\n- Turn 5: U (move up to \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 6: U (move up to \\(y = 5\\))\n- Turn 7: U (move up to \\(y = 6\\))\n- Turn 8: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\))\n- Turn 9: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 10: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\))\n- Turn 11: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\), though not necessary)\n\nThis path achieves the goal in \\(H = 9\\) turns, with the position (0, 9) reached at turn 11. No shorter path is possible due to the collision at \\(y = 4\\) on turn 5 (which must be avoided by delaying the move to \\(y = 4\\) until turn 6) and the need for 7 net upward moves from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 4, and I start at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car positions and how they move. The cars are given for each freeway k (which corresponds to y=k, I assume). For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). The direction is either left or right, but in the car state, it's given as \"right\" for all, meaning they're moving to the right? Let me check the update rules.\n\nThe update rules say:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]? That seems messy. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1, it's (-36, -47, right, 3). But direction is right, so it should be moving right.\n\nThere's inconsistency in notation. Let's see the right-moving update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nBut for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so tail and head, but which is which? In this case, for freeway 1, head is -36, tail is -47? But -36 is greater than -47, so if it's right-moving, the head should be on the right, I think.\n\nI need to clarify the head and tail.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and then Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving right, τ should be the left end, and h the right end? But in the notation, it says \"head\" and \"tail\", which might be confusing.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed). For freeway 1: head = -36, tail = -47, direction = right, speed = 3.\n\nSince direction is right, and head is -36, tail is -47, which is less than head? -47 < -36, so tail is left of head if we think of increasing x.\n\nBut in the span, for right-moving, it should be [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nFrom the update rule: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] and then moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, ...), so for right-moving, head should be the right end, tail the left end.\n\nIn freeway 1: head = -36, tail = -47, so since -36 > -47, head is right, tail is left, so for right-moving, Span = [tail, head] = [-47, -36]? But in the update, it says [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the car state, it's (head, tail), so h = head, τ = tail.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [tail, head]\n\nThen Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [tail + sΔT, head + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, so let's focus on that.\n\nFor freeway 1: tail = -47, head = -36, direction right, speed 3.\n\nAt turn t_1=4, Span = [ -47, -36 ]\n\nAs T increases, the car moves right, so the span shifts right.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on that freeway at turn T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer position: at each turn, y_t, and at turn T, if y_T = k, and for freeway k, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn, then collision.\n\nAlso, note the important point: when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}. But at turn T, you are on y_T, so you can be collided only by cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so at turn T, you are still on y_T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you won't be collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only on y_T at turn T.\n\nFor example, if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move up to y_{T+1} = y_T +1, then at turn T, you are on y_T, so collision check on freeway y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so collision check on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSimilarly for down or stay.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at turn 4.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is above, so I probably want to move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid cars on y=4 to y=8.\n\ny=9 is the target, and there are no cars on y=9, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, player starts at (0,3), target (0,9), so y=9 is safe.\n\nCars are on y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway at turn t_1=4.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: head = -36, tail = -47, dir right, speed 3. So span at t=4: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nSince it's moving right at speed 3, at time T, span is [-47 + 3(T-4), -36 + 3(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-36, -47, right, 3) so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: also (-36, -47, right, 3) same.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-32, -43, right, 4), (4, -7, right, 4), (40, 29, right, 4)\n\nFor each car, we need to handle separately.\n\nFirst car: tail=-43, head=-32, speed 4, so span at t=4: [-43, -32]\n\nAt T, [-43 + 4(T-4), -32 + 4(T-4)]\n\nSecond car: head=4, tail=-7? Tail=-7, head=4, so span at t=4: [ -7, 4 ]\n\nAt T, [ -7 + 4(T-4), 4 + 4(T-4) ]\n\nThird car: head=40, tail=29? Tail=29, head=40, span [29,40] at t=4, at T [29 + 4(T-4), 40 + 4(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (0, -11, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, so span at t=4: [ -11, 0 ]  // since tail=-11, head=0\n\nAt T, [ -11 + 12(T-4), 0 + 12(T-4) ]\n\nSecond car: head=48, tail=37, span [37,48] at t=4, at T [37 + 12(T-4), 48 + 12(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: (0, -11, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is in the span for each freeway at different turns.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for freeway k, if player is on y_T = k, and 0 is in some car's span on k at T.\n\nSince I start at y=3 at t=4, and I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=3: at t=4, I am on y=3, so I need to check if there is a car on freeway 3 with 0 in span at t=4.\n\nFreeway 3 has one car: span at t=4: [-47, -36], 0 is not between -47 and -36? -36 > 0? -36 is negative, 0 is positive, so -36 < 0, and -47 < 0, so 0 is not in [-47,-36], since -36 < 0. So no collision at t=4 on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but I'm not on them yet.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions: U, D, S to move up to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I could go up directly, but I have to avoid cars.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the minimum turns to go from y=3 to y=9 is 6 turns if I go up every time.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see the cars on the freeways I need to cross: y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=3 I'm starting, y=9 is target, so I need to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nAt each position and time, I need to be safe.\n\nLet me denote time starting from t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=3, safe as above.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T, so at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nSince actions start at t=4, and I can take actions at t=4 to t=4+H-1, and after H actions, I am at turn t=4+H, position y_{4+H}.\n\nLet’s say at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter H turns, I am at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nt_1=4, so at turn 4+H, y_{4+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, I need to go from y=3 to y=9 in one action, but I can only change by +1, so impossible. Min H is 6.\n\nBut I need to check if I can go up each turn without collision.\n\nStart at t=4, y=3.\n\nAction a_4: I can go U to y=4, or S stay y=3, or D down to y=2, but y=2 is freeway with cars? y=2 has cars, but I might not need to go there, since I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but let's see.\n\nFirst, try to go up directly if possible.\n\nSo, at t=4, y=3, I take a_4 = U, so y_5 = 4 at turn t=5? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nTurn t: I am at position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn t, I am on y_t, so collision depends on cars at turn t on freeway y_t.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=4, I am on y=3, safe.\n\nI take action a_4, which sets y_5.\n\nThen at turn t=5, I am on y_5, and so on.\n\nSo, after taking action at t, I move to new position at t+1.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, let say at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nT must be at least 4+6=10, since from y=3 to y=9, min 6 moves up, so T=10 if I go up each turn from t=4 to t=9, so actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9, y at t=5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nAt t=4: y=3\n\na_4: U, then y_5=4\n\na_5: U, y_6=5\n\na_6: U, y_7=6\n\na_7: U, y_8=7\n\na_8: U, y_9=8\n\na_9: U, y_10=9\n\nSo at turn t=10, y=9.\n\nNow, I need to be safe at each turn from t=4 to t=10, but at t=10, y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAt t=4, y=3, safe.\n\nNow, at t=5, y=5? No, at t=5, if I took U at t=4, y_5=4, so I am on y=4 at turn t=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, y=5, and so on.\n\nSo for each turn, when I am on a freeway, I need to check if 0 is in any car span on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, at t=5, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars.\n\nAt turn T, for freeway 4.\n\nt_1=4, so ΔT = T - 4.\n\nFor each car, span at T.\n\nFirst car: tail=-43, head=-32, speed 4, so span at T: [ -43 + 4(ΔT), -32 + 4(ΔT) ] where ΔT = T-4\n\nSecond car: tail=-7, head=4, speed 4, span [ -7 + 4(ΔT), 4 + 4(ΔT) ]\n\nThird car: tail=29, head=40, speed 4, span [29 + 4(ΔT), 40 + 4(ΔT)]\n\nNow, at turn T, collision if 0 in any of these spans.\n\nFirst, for T=5, ΔT=1\n\nCar1: [ -43 +4(1), -32 +4(1) ] = [-39, -28], 0 not in, since both negative.\n\nCar2: [ -7 +4(1), 4 +4(1) ] = [-3, 8], 0 is between -3 and 8? -3 < 0 < 8, yes, so 0 in [-3,8], so collision if I am on y=4 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=4, so collision!\n\nSo if I go directly to y=4 at t=5, I collide with the second car on freeway 4.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=4 at t=5.\n\nTherefore, I need to either not be on y=4 at t=5, or if I am, but 0 not in span, but it is, so I must avoid being on y=4 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, if I don't move up, I could stay on y=3 or go down, but let's see.\n\nAt t=4, I could take S or D instead of U.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince I cannot be on y=4 at t=5, I should not take U at t=4.\n\nSo at t=4, take S or D.\n\nIf S, stay at y=3 at t=5.\n\nOr D, go to y=2 at t=5.\n\nBut y=2 has cars, let's see if safe at t=5 on y=3 or y=2.\n\nFirst, freeway 3 at t=5.\n\nFreeway 3: one car, tail=-47, head=-36, speed 3.\n\nAt T=5, ΔT=1, span [ -47 + 3(1), -36 + 3(1) ] = [-44, -33], both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 at t=5: same as freeway 1 and 3, car with span at t=4 [-47,-36], at t=5 [-44,-33], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut I'm not on y=2 yet.\n\nAt t=5, if I stay on y=3, safe, as above.\n\nIf I go down to y=2, at t=5, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 car: at t=5, span [-44,-33], 0 not in, so safe, but I don't want to go down, it might be inefficient.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at t=5: freeway 1, same car, span [-44,-33], safe.\n\nBut again, down.\n\nSo probably better to stay or move up later.\n\nNow, I need to see when I can go to y=4 safely.\n\nThat is, when on freeway 4, 0 not in any car span.\n\nFor freeway 4, cars:\n\nCar2: span at T: [ -7 + 4(ΔT), 4 + 4(ΔT) ] = [4ΔT -7, 4ΔT +4]\n\n0 in span if 4ΔT -7 <= 0 <= 4ΔT +4\n\nWhich is true when 4ΔT -7 <= 0 and 0 <= 4ΔT +4, which since 4ΔT +4 >0 for ΔT >=0, so only need 4ΔT -7 <=0, so 4ΔT <=7, ΔT <= 1.75, so for ΔT <=1, since integer, ΔT=0,1\n\nΔT = T-4, so at T=4 and T=5.\n\nAt T=4, ΔT=0, car2 span [ -7, 4], 0 in [-7,4], yes.\n\nAt T=5, ΔT=1, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nAt T=6, ΔT=2, [ -7+8,4+8] = [1,12], 0 not in since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nCar1: [ -43 +4ΔT, -32 +4ΔT], min -32+4ΔT, at ΔT=0, -32, at ΔT=8, 0? -32 +4ΔT <=0 when ΔT<=8, but since head is -32+4ΔT, when -32+4ΔT <0, 0 not in span, which is when ΔT <8, since at ΔT=8, head= -32+32=0, so 0 is included if head=0.\n\nSpan [a,b], 0 in if a<=0<=b.\n\nFor car1, a= -43+4ΔT, b= -32+4ΔT\n\nb <=0 when -32+4ΔT <=0, ΔT <=8\n\na <=0 when -43+4ΔT <=0, ΔT <=10.75\n\nBut for 0 in [a,b], need a<=0 and b>=0.\n\nSo b>=0 when -32+4ΔT >=0, ΔT >=8\n\na<=0 when -43+4ΔT <=0, ΔT <=10.75\n\nSo for ΔT=8, b= -32+32=0, a= -43+32= -11, so [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔT=9, b= -32+36=4>0, a= -43+36= -7<0, so [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔT=10, b= -32+40=8>0, a= -43+40= -3<0, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔT=11, b= -32+44=12>0, a= -43+44=1>0? a=1, b=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, a<=0 until ΔT=10, b>=0 from ΔT=8.\n\nSo 0 in car1 span for ΔT=8,9,10.\n\nBut at T=4+8=12, etc.\n\nBut for now, at T=5, car1 not issue.\n\nCar3: tail=29, head=40, speed4, span [29+4ΔT, 40+4ΔT], both positive for ΔT>=0, min 29>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 4, the dangerous car is car2 at T=4 and T=5, and car1 at later times but not now.\n\nAt T=4, car2 span [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=5, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=6, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, car1 only dangerous later.\n\nSo for freeway 4, 0 in car span at T=4 and T=5, not at T=6.\n\nAt T=4, but at t=4, I am on y=3, not y=4, so no collision at t=4 on y=4.\n\nOnly when I am on the freeway.\n\nSo to be on y=4 safely, I need to be there at T>=6, when ΔT>=2, car2 span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not issue.\n\nSo earliest to be on y=4 is at t=6.\n\nt=6 corresponds to ΔT=2.\n\nAt t=6, on y=4, car2 span [ -7+4*2, 4+4*2] = [-7+8,4+8] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, if on y=4, unsafe.\n\nNow, similarly for other freeways.\n\nBut I need to go through all.\n\nFirst, I have to be on y=4 at some point.\n\nEarliest is t=6.\n\nNow, at t=4, I am at y=3.\n\nI need to get to y=4 by t=6 at least.\n\nI can be at y=4 at t=6 or later.\n\nBut to minimize H, I want to go as fast as possible.\n\nNow, at t=4, if I take U, I go to y=4 at t=5, but unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot take U at t=4.\n\nI can take S or D.\n\nIf S, stay y=3 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, I am on y=3, which is safe, as freeway 3 car span at t=5 is [-44,-33], 0 not in.\n\nThen at t=5, I can take action to go to y=4 or other.\n\nIf at t=5 I take U, then y_6=4 at turn t=6.\n\nAt t=6, on y=4, as above, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=5.\n\nNow, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, speed 12, direction right.\n\nAt t_1=4, span [τ, h] = [ -11, 0 ] since tail=-11, head=0.\n\nAt T, span [ -11 + 12(ΔT), 0 + 12(ΔT) ] = [12ΔT -11, 12ΔT]\n\nSecond car: head=48, tail=37, span [37 +12ΔT, 48+12ΔT]\n\nNow, collision on freeway 5 if 0 in first car span or second, but second car min 37>0, so 0 never in, only first car.\n\nFirst car span [12ΔT -11, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 12ΔT -11 <= 0 <= 12ΔT\n\nSince 12ΔT >=0, always 0 <= 12ΔT for ΔT>=0, so need 12ΔT -11 <=0, so 12ΔT <=11, ΔT <= 11/12 <1, so only at ΔT=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=4, span [ -11, 0], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=5, span [12-11, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for higher, [13,24] etc, 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 5, 0 in car span only at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, if on y=5, but at t=4, I am not on y=5.\n\nSo for T>=5, on freeway 5, 0 not in any car span, so always safe to be on y=5 for T>=5.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8, same cars as 5, so same situation.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 have same cars: (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12), so identical to freeway 5.\n\nThus for y=5,6,7,8, it is safe to be on at any turn T>=5, since at T=4 only dangerous, but T=4 is past.\n\nt_1=4, so T=4 is current, but at T=4, if on y=5, unsafe, but I am not.\n\nSo for future turns, T>4, on y=5 to 8, safe.\n\ny=5 to 8 all safe for T>=5.\n\nNow, back to y=4.\n\nWe need to be on y=4 at T>=6 to be safe.\n\nNow, y=3: freeway 3, car span at T: for ΔT=T-4, span [ -47 +3ΔT, -36 +3ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -47+3ΔT <=0 <= -36+3ΔT\n\nNow, -36+3ΔT >=0 when ΔT >=12, since -36+36=0.\n\n-47+3ΔT <=0 when ΔT <=47/3≈15.666\n\nBut for 0 in, need both.\n\n-36+3ΔT >=0 when ΔT >=12\n\n-47+3ΔT <=0 when ΔT <=15.666, so ΔT=12 to 15 inclusive.\n\nFor example, ΔT=12: b= -36+36=0, a= -47+36= -11, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔT=13: b= -36+39=3>0, a= -47+39= -8<0, [-8,3], 0 in.\n\n...\nUp to ΔT=15: b= -36+45=9>0, a= -47+45= -2<0, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nΔT=16: b= -36+48=12>0, a= -47+48=1>0, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 3, dangerous when T=4+12=16 to 4+15=19, etc.\n\nBut for early turns, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 1 same.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=3, I need to reach y=4 at some safe time, then to y=5, etc.\n\nBut y=5 to 8 are safe for T>=5, so I can go directly once I am on y=4 at T>=6.\n\nNow, at t=4, I am at y=3.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Take U at t=4: go to y=4 at t=5, but t=5 on y=4 unsafe, collision.\n\n- Take S at t=4: stay y=3 at t=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, I can take U to go to y=4 at t=6, which is safe.\n\n- Or take D to y=2 at t=5, but not necessary.\n\nSo best: at t=4, take S, stay at y=3 for t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, take U, go to y=4 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, on y=4, safe as we saw.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=6, I can go up to y=5 at t=7, and so on.\n\ny=5 is safe for t>=5, t=7>5, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 all safe.\n\nGo to y=5 at t=7, y=6 at t=8, y=7 at t=9, y=8 at t=10, y=9 at t=11.\n\nActions:\n\nt=4: S (since we stay)\n\nt=5: U (to y=4 at t=6)\n\nt=6: U (to y=5 at t=7)\n\nt=7: U (to y=6 at t=8)\n\nt=8: U (to y=7 at t=9)\n\nt=9: U (to y=8 at t=10)\n\nt=10: U (to y=9 at t=11)\n\nAt t=11, y=9, reached.\n\nH=7 turns? From t=4 to t=10, that's 7 actions.\n\nt=4 action, t=5, t=6, t=7, t=8, t=9, t=10: 7 actions.\n\nAfter 7 actions, at turn t=4+7=11, y=9.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nMinimal without waiting is 6 actions to go from y=3 to y=9, but we had to wait one turn.\n\nCan I avoid waiting?\n\nAt t=4, instead of staying, I could go down to y=2, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, at t=4, take D, go to y=2 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, on y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 car at t=5: ΔT=1, span [-47+3(1), -36+3(1)] = [-44,-33], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, I could go up to y=3 at t=6, or directly to y=4? From y=2, if take U, go to y=3 at t=6.\n\nBut then at t=6, on y=3.\n\nThen I need to go to y=4 later.\n\nBut at t=6, on y=3, which is safe, since ΔT=2, span [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30], 0 not in.\n\nThen I can go to y=4 at t=7, for example.\n\nBut t=7 on y=4, ΔT=3, freeway 4 car2 span [4*3 -7, 4*3 +4] = [12-7,12+4]=[5,16], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=8, etc., up to y=9 at t=12, which is worse than before.\n\nAt t=5 on y=2, I could take U to y=3 at t=6, then U to y=4 at t=7, same as above.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nCan I go directly to y=4 at a different time?\n\nThe only time unsafe on y=4 is t=5 (since t=4 not relevant as I'm not on it).\n\nt=5 unsafe, t=6 safe.\n\nSo I must be on y=4 at t=6 or later.\n\nIn the first plan, I am on y=4 at t=6.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=7, etc.\n\nBut y=5 to 8 are safe, so I can go up each turn.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=4 earlier? t=5 is unsafe, so no, must be at least t=6.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=4 later, but that would delay.\n\nAnother idea: maybe I can go to y=5 directly or something, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nFrom y=3, I need to pass through y=4.\n\nUnless I go down, but that seems worse.\n\nPerhaps at t=4, I take S, stay at y=3 for t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, instead of going to y=4, I could go to y=4 later, but I need to move.\n\nAt t=5, I am on y=3, I can take U to go to y=4 at t=6, as before.\n\nOr take S again, stay at y=3 for t=6.\n\nBut at t=6, on y=3, still safe? Freeway 3 at t=6, ΔT=2, span [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut if I stay, I waste time.\n\nThen I can go to y=4 at t=7, for example.\n\nBut at t=7 on y=4, safe, but then to y=5 at t=8, etc., reach y=9 later, say at t=12, worse.\n\nSo better to go to y=4 as soon as safe, at t=6.\n\nNow, what about higher freeways? y=5 to 8 are safe, but let me confirm freeway 8, for example.\n\nFreeway 8: cars same as 5, (0,-11,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: at T, span [12ΔT -11, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in only at ΔT=0, T=4.\n\nFor T>4, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut in the sequence, when I go to y=8 at t=10, for example, ΔT = t-4 =6, freeway 8 car1 span [12*6 -11, 12*6] = [72-11,72]=[61,72], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a problem with other freeways? For example, when I am on y=4 at t=6, we have car1 on freeway 4, which might be dangerous later, but at t=6, car1 span [ -43 +4*2, -32 +4*2] = [-43+8, -32+8]=[-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nAnd I am only there at t=6, not later, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the first plan, with 7 actions, I reach at t=11.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think H is the number of actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t=4+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, H=7, actions at t=4 to t=10, position at t=11 y=9.\n\nBut can I do with H=6?\n\nThat would require reaching y=9 at t=10.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=4, to y=9 at t=10, that requires 6 moves up in 6 turns.\n\nBut to have y_10=9, with actions from t=4 to t=9, 6 actions.\n\ny_t: t=4:3\n\nAfter a_4, y_5\n\na_5, y_6\n\n...\n\na_9, y_10\n\nIf all U, y_5=4, y_6=5, y_7=6, y_8=7, y_9=8, y_10=9.\n\nBut at t=5, y=4, which is unsafe, as we saw.\n\nIf I skip or something, but I have to be on each y.\n\nFor example, if at t=4 I take S, y_5=3\n\nThen at t=5, take U, y_6=4\n\nBut then at t=6, y=4, now to go to y=5 at t=7, y=6 at t=8, y=7 at t=9, y=8 at t=10, y_10=8, not 9.\n\ny_10=8, then I need another action to go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSo with one wait, I reach at t=11.\n\nIf I take U at t=4, I go to y=4 at t=5, but unsafe.\n\nPerhaps I can go down and then up faster, but unlikely.\n\nAnother idea: maybe for y=4, I can be there at t=6, but go to y=5 faster? No.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid y=4 at some point, but I have to cross it.\n\nUnless I go to y=2 or something, but that takes more time.\n\nFor example, at t=4, take D to y=2 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, take U to y=3 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, take U to y=4 at t=7.\n\nThen U to y=5 at t=8, etc., to y=9 at t=12, worse.\n\nAt t=5 on y=2, I could take U twice? No, one action per turn.\n\nEach turn one action.\n\nSo min to go up from y=2 to y=9 is 7 actions, plus the down, even worse.\n\nSo best is to stay at y=3 for one turn, then go up.\n\nBut in that case, with H=7.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeways above.\n\ny=5 to 8 are safe, but what about y=1,2,3? But I don't need to be there except starting.\n\nIn the sequence, I only care when I am on them.\n\nIn the plan: at t=4, y=3, safe.\n\nt=5, y=3 (if S at t=4), safe.\n\nt=6, y=4, safe as ΔT=2.\n\nt=7, y=5, now freeway 5, at t=7, ΔT=3, car1 span [12*3 -11, 12*3] = [36-11,36]=[25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=8, y=6, freeway 6, similar, span for first car [12*4 -11,48]=[48-11,48]=[37,48]? ΔT=4, [12*4 -11, 12*4] = [48-11,48]=[37,48], 0 not in.\n\nt=9, y=7, freeway 7, ΔT=5, [12*5-11,60]=[60-11,60]=[49,60], safe.\n\nt=10, y=8, freeway 8, ΔT=6, [72-11,72]=[61,72], safe.\n\nt=11, y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nBut at t=10, y=8, and at t=11, y=9.\n\nNow, the actions are from t=4 to t=10, 7 actions.\n\nt=4: S\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nAfter a_10, y_11=9.\n\nNow, but at t=6, y=4, we have freeway 4 car2, which at ΔT=2, span [1,12], 0 not in, good.\n\nBut is there any other car? For example, car1 on freeway 4 at t=6: [-35,-24], not issue.\n\nNow, but I think I missed something: the cars on other freeways, but since I am not on them, no collision.\n\nIn the sequence, when I am on y=4 at t=6, only freeway 4 matters.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let me check freeway 5 at t=6, but I am not on it.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster if I go to y=5 directly or something, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at t=4, I take U, go to y=4 at t=5, but unsafe, so I must not.\n\nUnless I can be on y=4 at t=5 but not at position 0? But collision is based on position x=0, and the car span at x=0.\n\nThe player is always at x=0, I assume, since it's a vertical move, and cars are on the freeway moving horizontally.\n\nThe player position is (0, y_t), so x=0 always.\n\nCollision if at turn T, y_T = k, and for freeway k, 0 in some car span at T.\n\nSo position fixed at x=0.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if I can be on y=4 at t=6 with fewer actions.\n\nFrom t=4 to t=6, I need to be at y=4 at t=6.\n\nAt t=4, y=3.\n\nIf I take U at t=4, y_5=4 at t=5, but unsafe.\n\nIf I take S, y_5=3 at t=5, then U at t=5, y_6=4 at t=6.\n\nIf I take D at t=4, y_5=2 at t=5, then U at t=5, y_6=3 at t=6, then need another to y=4.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo only way is to stay at t=4 or go down, but stay is better.\n\nSo must have one stay.\n\nThus minimal H=7.\n\nNow, the sequence: actions from t=4 to t=10.\n\nt=4: S\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nIn the sequence, at t=5, I take U, so from y=3 at t=5 to y=4 at t=6.\n\nIn terms of the action list.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = S (since t_1=4)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1\n\nH=7, so t=4 to t=10, which is t_1 to t_1 +6.\n\nt_1=4, actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nThat is t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, H=7, t=0 to 6.\n\nt=0: t_1 +0 =4, a_4\n\nt=1: t_1+1=5, a_5\n\n...\n\nt=6: t_1+6=10, a_10\n\nThen position at t_1 + H =4+7=11, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 4, there is a third car, but we saw it's not an issue.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5,6,7,8, all safe after t=4.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if at any point I might be on a freeway when dangerous.\n\nFor example, when on y=5 at t=7, freeway 5, ΔT=3, car1 span [12*3 -11, 36] = [36-11,36]=[25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\ny=6 at t=8, freeway 6, ΔT=4, [48-11,48]=[37,48], 0 not in.\n\ny=7 at t=9, ΔT=5, [60-11,60]=[49,60], 0 not in.\n\ny=8 at t=10, ΔT=6, [72-11,72]=[61,72], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, what about the starting freeway y=3? I was on it at t=4 and t=5, both safe.\n\nt=4: ΔT=0, span [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nt=5: ΔT=1, [-44,-33], 0 not in.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have seven actions, but the player reaches at turn 11.\n\nThe problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"a sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1\".\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nIn the box, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut let me see if I can do better.\n\nSuppose at t=4, I take S, stay y=3 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, instead of U, I take S again, but then I waste more time.\n\nOr, can I go to y=4 at t=6, but then to y=5 at t=7, etc., same as before.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=5 or something, but I can't, since only one step.\n\nAnother idea: maybe for freeway 4, I can be on it at t=6, but if I could reach y=5 faster, but no.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to go through all, but I have to.\n\nOr, at t=4, I take U to y=4 at t=5, but since at t=5 on y=4, 0 is in car2 span, collision, so I die, not good.\n\nUnless the car span doesn't cover, but it does.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 4, the car at (4,-7,right,4), at t=5, span [-3,8], includes 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's necessary to wait.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: S\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U\n\nTurn t_1 +3: U\n\nTurn t_1 +4: U\n\nTurn t_1 +5: U\n\nTurn t_1 +6: U\n\nWith t_1=4.\n\nIn the list: Turn 4: S, Turn 5: U, Turn 6: U, Turn 7: U, Turn 8: U, Turn 9: U, Turn 10: U\n\nBut in the box, it should be written as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so with the variable.\n\nSince t_1 is given, I think it's fine to use numbers.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so I can write with t_1.\n\nBut in the box, I think it's clear.\n\nPerhaps write in terms of t_1.\n\nBut since t_1=4, it's fine.\n\nNow, but let me double-check freeway 4 at t=6.\n\nt=6, ΔT=2, car2: [4*2 -7, 4*2 +4] = [8-7,8+4]=[1,12], 0 not in, yes.\n\ncar1: [4*2 -43, 4*2 -32]? Earlier: [ -43 +4*2, -32 +4*2] = [-43+8, -32+8]=[-35,-24], not 0.\n\ncar3: [29+8,40+8]=[37,48], not 0.\n\nGood.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nI think that's the plan.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 3\\) for one turn to avoid the unsafe condition on \\(y = 4\\) at turn 5.\n\n- At turn 4, staying at \\(y = 3\\) is safe because the car on freeway 3 (span \\([-47, -36]\\) at turn 4) does not include 0.\n- At turn 5, staying at \\(y = 3\\) is safe (span \\([-44, -33]\\) at turn 5, 0 not included).\n- Moving to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6 is safe because the car on freeway 4 that would cause a collision at turn 5 (span \\([-3, 8]\\)) has moved, and at turn 6, the critical car has span \\([1, 12]\\) (0 not included).\n- Freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are safe for all turns \\(T \\geq 5\\) because the only dangerous car on each (span \\([12\\Delta T - 11, 12\\Delta T]\\) where \\(\\Delta T = T - 4\\)) has 0 in its span only at \\(T = 4\\), which is in the past. Thus, moving up from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\) sequentially from turn 6 to turn 10 is collision-free.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 4: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) and avoid collision on \\(y = 4\\) at turn 5.\n- Turn 5: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6.\n- Turn 6: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7.\n- Turn 7: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8.\n- Turn 8: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9.\n- Turn 9: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n- Turn 10: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nAfter 7 actions, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 11.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 5, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (which correspond to y=1 to y=8).\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0) but must stay within y in [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the freeway at the same y-coordinate as the player at turn T) and if the car's span at that turn T includes the x-coordinate 0 (since the player is at (0, y_T)).\n\nImportant: when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on freeway y_T. At turn T, the player is on the freeway corresponding to the current y (y_T). Only at the next turn (T+1) does the player move to the next freeway.\n\nSo, we must avoid having the player at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway whose span at turn T includes 0.\n\nGiven the car update rules:\n\nFor a car on a freeway (which we note is fixed per freeway, so freeway k has cars that move independently and we are only concerned when the player is on that freeway at a particular turn).\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1 = 5.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the span at any future turn T (relative to t1: T = 5, 6, 7, ...).\n\nNote: The player starts at turn 5 at y=3. We are to plan actions for turns 5, 6, 7, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nGoal: minimal H (number of turns including the starting turn? but note: we are to provide actions from turn t1 to the turn before the last when we reach 9? Actually, we need to reach at turn t1+H-1 being 9. So we start at turn t1 (turn 5) and we have H turns: from t=5 to t=5+H-1, so the player moves H-1 times? Actually, the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that the first action is at t1 (t=0 relative to t1) and the last at t1+H-1 (relative t=H-1). Then the position after H actions (and H turns) is at (0,9). So we start at turn t1 and take H actions (so H turns) to be at 9.\n\nWe are at turn 5: y5 = 3.\n\nWe are to compute the car positions at future turns (starting from turn 5) for each freeway.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 5.\n\nFor a car given at turn t0=5 with (h, tau, d, s):\n\nIf the car is right-moving (d='right'), then at turn T (>=5), the car's span is:\n  [tau + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)]\n\nIf the car is left-moving (d='left'), then at turn T (>=5), the car's span is:\n  [h - s*(T-5), tau - s*(T-5)]\n\nBut note: the problem states for left-moving: initially at t1: [h, tau] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nand for right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nActually, the initial representation for right-moving is given as (head, tail) but the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, h] (which is [tail, head] and head>tail). Similarly, for left-moving: [h, tau] with h>tau? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: span(t1)=[h, tau] and then moves to [h-s*(T-t1), tau-s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut looking at the input, we have:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-33, -44, right, 3) -> but note: if it's right-moving, the span at t1=5 should be [tail, head] = [-44, -33]? But the problem representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nWait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning the tail is the leftmost and head is the rightmost. But in the table, it is written as (head, tail) for the car? \n\nLet me check the example for freeway 4: \n  (-28, -39, right, 4) -> so head=-28, tail=-39? Then the span at t1=5 is [tau, h] = [-39, -28]? But that would be from -39 to -28? Then the next car (8, -3, right, 4): head=8, tail=-3 -> then the span is [tail, head] = [-3,8]. But that doesn't make sense because -3 is less than 8? \n\nWait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the initial span is [tau, h] meaning that the car extends from tau to h? But if tau < h, then the car is from tau to h. However, in the example for freeway 4: first car: (-28, -39, right, 4) -> if we take tau=-39 and h=-28, then the car spans from -39 to -28? That is correct because -39 < -28. Similarly, the second car: (8, -3, right, 4) -> if we take tau=-3 and h=8, then the car spans from -3 to 8? But note: -3 is less than 8? Yes. So the representation (head, tail) for a right-moving car: head is the rightmost point and tail is the leftmost? But the problem says for right-moving: \"head\" and \"tail\" and then the span is [tail, head]. So tail must be <= head.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the span is [h, tau] and h is the leftmost? and tau the rightmost? because then when moving left, the entire car moves left. But note: the problem says for left-moving: [h, tau] -> [h-s*(T-t1), tau-s*(T-t1)]. So if h < tau, then the car is from h to tau? But then moving left, both h and tau decrease.\n\nHowever, in the given data, all cars are right-moving. So we don't have left-moving.\n\nSo for a right-moving car given as (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, tau, 'right', s), the span at turn t0=5 is [tau, h] (with tau <= h). Then at turn T (>=5), the span is [tau + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: (12,1,right,12) -> at turn 5: [1,12]. Then at T: [1+12*(T-5), 12+12*(T-5)].\n\nNow, we are concerned with whether 0 is in the span at a particular turn T. That is, for a car on freeway k, we care at turn T if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and if 0 is in [tau + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)] for that car.\n\nBut note: a freeway might have multiple cars. So if at turn T the player is on freeway k, then we must check every car on freeway k: if any car has 0 in its span at turn T, then collision.\n\nWe are to avoid such collisions.\n\nWe start at y=3 at turn 5. We must not be on freeway 3 at turn 5 if there is a car on freeway 3 that has 0 in its span at turn 5? But wait, we are at turn 5 and the player is at (0,3). So we are on freeway 3 at turn 5. We must check freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3: Cars: (-33, -44, right, 3) -> so at turn 5: [tau, h] = [-44, -33]. The span is [-44, -33]. Does 0 fall in this? No. So we are safe at turn 5.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay. But note: we are at y=3, and we want to go to y=9, so we need to go up 6 steps. But we can also move down? But that would be counterproductive. However, sometimes we might have to wait (stay) to avoid a car.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns. The minimal without obstacles would be 6 turns: always up. But we must check if that is safe.\n\nWe plan a sequence of moves and check for collisions at each turn.\n\nWe'll simulate from turn 5 onward, and at each turn, we choose an action (U, D, S) that leads to a state that is safe and gets us to 9 as fast as possible.\n\nBut note: we must avoid freeways 1-8 when they are dangerous. The freeways 0 and 9 are safe? Actually, the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So when the player is on freeway 0 (y=0) or freeway 9 (y=9), there are no cars? So we are safe. But note: at the end we must be at (0,9). And we start at (0,3). \n\nWe are at turn 5: y=3 -> safe as we checked.\n\nNow, if we go up at turn 5: then at turn 6, we are at y=4.\n\nBut we must check at each turn the freeway we are on.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k and for each car on k, the span at every future turn.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving at constant speed. We can precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k, the set of turns T (>=5) for which 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nAlternatively, we can simulate turn by turn and check the required freeway.\n\nLet me precompute the dangerous turns for each freeway.\n\nFor a car on freeway k with parameters (h, tau, d, s) (all d='right' in this case), the span at T is [tau + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)].\n\n0 is in [A, B] (with A<=B) if and only if A <= 0 <= B.\n\nSo: \n   tau + s*(T-5) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-5)\n\nWe can solve for T:\n\n   tau + s*(T-5) <= 0  => T-5 <= -tau/s\n   and 0 <= h + s*(T-5) => T-5 >= -h/s\n\nBut note: since the car is moving to the right, the span is shifting to the right. Also, note that tau and h are integers? The problem doesn't specify, but we assume integers? Actually, the given numbers are integers. And T is integer.\n\nBut note: the span is continuous? Actually, the problem says \"span\" and the collision condition is if 0 is in the span. So we are to consider real numbers? But the positions are integers? Actually, the car positions are given as integers, but when moving, they become real? However, the update is linear: s*(T-5) which may be fractional if s is not integer? But the speeds are integers: 3,4,12.\n\nSo at integer T, the endpoints are integers? Because s*(T-5) is integer.\n\nSo we can compute the interval [A, B] at integer T.\n\nCondition: \n   A = tau + s*(T-5) <= 0 <= B = h + s*(T-5)\n\nSo we need:\n   tau + s*(T-5) <= 0   and   h + s*(T-5) >= 0\n\nRearranged:\n\n   T-5 <= -tau / s\n   T-5 >= -h / s\n\nBut note: since the car moves to the right, the entire car is moving to the right. So the dangerous period is when the car is passing 0.\n\nBut note: because the car is a continuous segment, we can compute:\n\n   Let L = tau + s*(T-5)\n   Let R = h + s*(T-5)\n\n   We require L <= 0 <= R.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n   T >= ceil( (-h) / s ) + 5?   Actually, from 0 <= h + s*(T-5) -> T-5 >= ceil(-h/s)? Not exactly: we are dealing with integers.\n\nActually, we can write:\n\n   T-5 must be at least ceil( (-h) / s )? But note: if (-h) is negative, then we require T-5 >= a negative number? That's always true? \n\nWait: h is the head (rightmost) at T=5. For example, freeway 3: h=-33, so -h=33, which is positive. Similarly, tau=-44, so -tau=44.\n\nSo condition:\n\n   T-5 >= ceil( (-h) / s )   [because we need h + s*(T-5) >= 0 -> s*(T-5) >= -h -> T-5 >= ceil(-h/s) if we are using real numbers? But note: since s and h are integers, we can use integer division?]\n\nActually, we can solve:\n\n   s*(T-5) >= -h   => T-5 >= ceil(-h / s)   [if we use real division and then ceil?]\n\nBut note: because T-5 is integer, we can write:\n\n   T-5 >= ceil( (-h) / s )\n\nSimilarly for the other inequality:\n\n   s*(T-5) <= -tau   => T-5 <= floor( (-tau) / s )\n\nBut let me check:\n\n   We have: tau + s*(T-5) <= 0   => s*(T-5) <= -tau\n\n   So T-5 <= floor( (-tau) / s )   ? Actually, because we require the inequality to hold and T-5 integer.\n\nBut note: if (-tau) is divisible by s, then T-5 can be exactly (-tau)/s. Otherwise, the maximum integer T-5 such that s*(T-5) <= -tau is floor( (-tau)/s ).\n\nSimilarly, for the lower bound: s*(T-5) >= -h -> T-5 >= ceil( (-h)/s )? Actually, the smallest integer T-5 that satisfies s*(T-5) >= -h is ceil( (-h)/s ).\n\nBut note: if (-h)/s is integer, then ceil( (-h)/s ) = (-h)/s.\n\nSo the dangerous turns T for this car are:\n\n   T_min = 5 + ceil( (-h) / s )\n   T_max = 5 + floor( (-tau) / s )\n\nAnd then T must be in [T_min, T_max] (inclusive).\n\nBut note: we require both inequalities to hold simultaneously. So T must be at least T_min and at most T_max.\n\nBut wait: for freeway 3: car (-33, -44, right, 3)\n   h = -33, tau = -44, s=3.\n\n   (-h) = 33 -> ceil(33/3)=ceil(11)=11 -> T_min = 5+11=16\n   (-tau)=44 -> floor(44/3)=floor(14.666)=14 -> T_max = 5+14=19\n\nSo dangerous turns: T=16,17,18,19? Let me check:\n\nAt T=15: \n   L = -44 + 3*(15-5) = -44+30 = -14 -> not <=0? Actually, we require L<=0 and R>=0.\n   R = -33+30 = -3 -> not >=0 -> safe.\n\nAt T=16:\n   L = -44+3*11 = -44+33 = -11 <=0\n   R = -33+33=0>=0 -> dangerous.\n\nAt T=17: L=-44+36=-8, R=-33+36=3 -> dangerous.\nAt T=18: L=-44+39=-5, R=6 -> dangerous.\nAt T=19: L=-44+42=-2, R=9 -> dangerous.\nAt T=20: L=-44+45=1>0 -> not dangerous.\n\nSo indeed, T from 16 to 19.\n\nBut wait, at T=16: R=0, which is included? The problem says \"if 0 in the span\", and 0 is the right endpoint? So included.\n\nSimilarly, at T=19: L=-2<=0<=9 -> included.\n\nSo the formula: T_min = 5 + ceil( (-h)/s ) = 5 + ceil(33/3)=5+11=16\nT_max = 5 + floor( (-tau)/s ) = 5 + floor(44/3)=5+14=19.\n\nBut note: ceil(33/3)=11, floor(44/3)=14.666->14? Actually, 44/3=14.666, floor=14.\n\nBut wait: the condition for the upper bound is s*(T-5) <= -tau -> 3*(T-5) <= 44 -> T-5 <= 44/3 ≈14.666 -> so maximum integer T-5=14 -> so T=19.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me do another example: freeway 4, first car: (-28,-39,right,4)\n   h=-28, tau=-39, s=4.\n\n   (-h)=28 -> ceil(28/4)=ceil(7)=7 -> T_min=5+7=12\n   (-tau)=39 -> floor(39/4)=floor(9.75)=9 -> T_max=5+9=14\n\nSo dangerous: T=12,13,14.\n\nCheck T=11: L=-39+4*6=-39+24=-15<=0, R=-28+24=-4<0 -> not dangerous? Actually R=-4<0 -> 0 not in [L,R]? because 0 is greater than R? so no.\nT=12: L=-39+4*7=-39+28=-11<=0, R=-28+28=0 -> dangerous.\nT=13: L=-39+32=-7, R=-28+32=4 -> dangerous.\nT=14: L=-39+36=-3, R=-28+36=8 -> dangerous.\nT=15: L=-39+40=1>0 -> safe.\n\nNow the second car on freeway4: (8,-3,right,4)\n   h=8, tau=-3, s=4.\n\n   (-h) = -8 -> ceil(-8/4)=ceil(-2)=-2 -> T_min=5-2=3 -> but T>=5, so we take max(5, 3) but our T>=5, so T_min=5? Actually, the formula T_min=5+ceil( (-h)/s ) = 5+ceil(-8/4)=5+ceil(-2)=5-2=3 -> but then we are only considering T>=5? So the dangerous period starts at T=5? \n\nCheck: at T=5: \n   L = tau + s*(0) = -3\n   R = 8\n   so [-3,8] -> 0 is in it? yes. So dangerous at T=5.\n\nBut we are at T=5 and we are on freeway 3, not freeway4. So we don't care about freeway4 at T=5.\n\nFor this car: \n   T_min = 5 + ceil( (-8)/4 ) = 5 + ceil(-2) = 5-2=3 -> but we start at T=5, so the dangerous turns for this car are from T=3 to T= ... \n   T_max = 5 + floor( -(-3)/4 ) = 5 + floor(3/4)=5+0=5? \n\nLet me compute: \n   Condition: \n      L = -3 + 4*(T-5) <= 0 -> 4*(T-5) <= 3 -> T-5 <= 0.75 -> so T-5 <=0 -> T<=5.\n      R = 8 + 4*(T-5) >=0 -> 4*(T-5) >= -8 -> T-5>=-2 -> T>=3.\n\nSo dangerous for T in [3,5]. But we are only concerned with T>=5? So T=5 is dangerous.\n\nBut note: the car is on freeway4. At turn T, if the player is on freeway4, then it is dangerous at T=5? But the player at T=5 is on freeway3. So safe.\n\nNow, what about T=6? \n   L = -3+4=1>0 -> not dangerous.\n\nSo for freeway4, the first car is dangerous at T=12,13,14 and the second car is dangerous at T=3,4,5 (but we only care about T>=5: T=5) and the third car? freeway4 has three cars: (44,33,right,4) -> wait, the table says: \n   (44,33,right,4) -> head=44, tail=33? Then at T=5: [33,44] -> 0 is not in [33,44]. \n\nBut compute: \n   h=44, tau=33, s=4.\n   (-h)= -44 -> ceil(-44/4)=ceil(-11)=-11 -> T_min=5-11=-6 -> which is before 5, so we take T>=5: then T_min=5? \n   But condition: \n        L = 33+4*(T-5) <=0 -> 4*(T-5)<=-33 -> T-5<=-33/4=-8.25 -> T<=5-8.25 -> T<=-3.25 -> which is impossible for T>=5. \n   So not dangerous at any T>=5.\n\nSo freeway4: dangerous at T=5 (from the second car) and T=12,13,14 (from the first car). But note: the second car is only dangerous at T=5? and then the first car at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow, freeway5: two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12) -> h=12, tau=1, s=12.\n   (-h)=-12 -> ceil(-12/12)=ceil(-1)=-1 -> T_min=5-1=4 -> but we start at T>=5, so T_min=5.\n   (-tau)=-1 -> floor(-1/12)=floor(-0.083)=-1 -> T_max=5-1=4 -> which is less than 5? \n\nWait, let's compute the condition:\n   We require: \n        L = 1 + 12*(T-5) <=0 -> 12*(T-5)<=-1 -> T-5<=-1/12 -> T<=5-0.083 -> T<=4.917 -> so T<=4 for integer T.\n   and R = 12+12*(T-5)>=0 -> 12*(T-5)>=-12 -> T-5>=-1 -> T>=4.\n\nSo dangerous for T in [4,4] -> only T=4? But we start at T=5, so not dangerous.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,12) -> h=60, tau=49, s=12.\n   (-h)=-60 -> ceil(-60/12)=ceil(-5)=-5 -> T_min=5-5=0 -> so T>=5: T_min=5.\n   (-tau)=-49 -> floor(-49/12)=floor(-4.083)=-5 -> T_max=5-5=0 -> which is less than 5? \n\nCondition:\n   L=49+12*(T-5)<=0 -> 12*(T-5)<=-49 -> T-5<=-49/12≈-4.083 -> T<=0.917 -> so T<=0 -> not for T>=5.\n   R=60+12*(T-5)>=0 -> 12*(T-5)>=-60 -> T-5>=-5 -> T>=0.\n\nSo dangerous for T in [0,0]? -> T=0? not in [5,..). So freeway5 is safe for T>=5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6,7,8: same cars as freeway5? \n   freeway6: (12,1,right,12), (60,49,right,12) -> same as freeway5: safe for T>=5.\n\nfreeway7: same -> safe.\nfreeway8: same -> safe.\n\nBut freeway1,2,3: each has one car: (-33,-44,right,3) -> we computed for freeway3: dangerous at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1 and freeway2: same car parameters? so same dangerous turns: T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway4: dangerous at T=5 (from the second car) and T=12,13,14 (from the first car). But note: the third car is safe.\n\nBut wait, at T=5: freeway4 is dangerous? But we are at T=5 and we are on freeway3, so we don't care. However, if we are on freeway4 at T=5, we would be in danger. But we are not.\n\nNow, we need to get from y=3 at T=5 to y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding being on a freeway k (for k=1..8) at a turn T when that freeway has a car whose span includes 0 at T.\n\nSo let's list the dangerous turns for each freeway that we might step on:\n\nWe are starting at y=3 at T=5. Then we can move to y=2,3,4 at T=6.\n\nWe are going to go up to 9, so we will pass freeways 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\nFreeway4: dangerous at T=12,13,14 -> so we don't want to be on freeway4 at turns 12,13,14.\n\nFreeway1,2,3: dangerous at T=16,17,18,19 -> but we are starting at 3 and going up, so we won't be on freeway1,2 again? unless we go down. Since we want to minimize turns, we don't want to go down. So we can avoid freeways 1,2 by not going down.\n\nBut freeway3: we are at T=5: safe. Then we leave freeway3 at T=6 (if we go up) and never return? so freeway3 dangerous at T=16,17,18,19 won't affect us.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5,6,7,8: all safe for T>=5? as we computed.\n\nBut wait: freeway4 is dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\nWe are at T=5 at y=3.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal steps: 6 steps up (from 3 to 9: 6 moves). So we can be at y=9 at T=5+6=11? \n\nBut note: we start at T=5 at y=3. Then:\n\nT5: y=3 -> safe (as computed)\nT6: y=4 (if we move up) -> we are on freeway4 at T=6: is freeway4 dangerous at T=6? \n   We computed: freeway4 dangerous at T=5,12,13,14. T=6 is not in that list? \n   But we computed the first car: dangerous only at T=12,13,14? and the second car: only at T=5? and the third: none. So at T=6, freeway4 is safe.\n\nThen T7: y=5 -> freeway5: safe (as computed for T>=5: no danger)\nT8: y=6 -> safe\nT9: y=7 -> safe\nT10: y=8 -> safe\nT11: y=9 -> we are at 9, which is safe (no cars on freeway9).\n\nSo the sequence: \n   T5: U -> y=4 at T6? Actually, at T5 we start at y=3, then we choose an action at T5 that will update the position for T6.\n\nRecall: \n   At turn T, we are at y_T. Then we choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + a_T (with a_T: U->+1, D->-1, S->0).\n\nSo:\n   T5: start at y5=3. Then we choose a5. \n        If a5=U, then y6 = 3+1=4.\n        If a5=S, then y6=3.\n        If a5=D, then y6=2.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the last turn, say at turn T.\n\nThe minimal H: if we go up every turn, then we can be at y=9 at T=5+6=11? \n\nBut let me compute:\n\n   T5: y5=3 -> after action a5 (U) -> y6=4\n   T6: y6=4 -> a6=U -> y7=5\n   T7: y7=5 -> a7=U -> y8=6\n   T8: y8=6 -> a8=U -> y9=7\n   T9: y9=7 -> a9=U -> y10=8\n   T10: y10=8 -> a10=U -> y11=9\n\nSo at T11, we are at y11=9. So H=6 actions? The actions are at T5 to T10 (6 actions). Then the player is at (0,9) at the end of the last action (at turn T10) and that is the state for turn T10+1? Wait, no.\n\nThe update: at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo at turn t, the position is y_t. Then we do action a_t, and then at the next turn (t+1) we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n   Turn 5: we are at y5=3. Then we do a5 -> then at turn6 we are at y6.\n   Turn6: at y6, then do a6 -> turn7: y7, etc.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the last turn. So we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9, and we do H-1 actions? \n\nBut the problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} meaning t=0 to H-1, so the actions are from t1 (which is 5) to t1+H-1 (which is 5+H-1). Then the state at turn t1+H (which is 5+H) is after the last action. But we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nSo we require: at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9).\n\nHow do we get there?\n\nWe are at turn t1=5: at (0,3). Then we do an action at turn5: that action will determine y6. Then at turn6, we are at y6. Then we do an action at turn6 to get y7, and so on.\n\nSo at turn T (>=5), we are at y_T. Then we do an action a_T, and then we are at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nWe require that at some turn T = t1+H-1, we are at y_T = 9.\n\nSo if we let T = 5 + k, then we require that at turn 5+k, we are at 9. And we have taken k actions? \n\nWe start at turn5: we haven't taken an action yet. Then we take the first action at turn5 to get to turn6. Then the second action at turn6 to get to turn7, etc.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn T, we must have taken (T-5) actions? \n\nBut note: at turn5, we are at 3. Then at turn6, we are at 3+delta0, at turn7: 3+delta0+delta1, ... at turn5+k: 3 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} delta_i = 9.\n\nThe minimal k: the minimal number of moves to get from 3 to 9? 6 moves if we always go up.\n\nSo we want to be at 9 at turn 5+6 = 11? \n\nBut wait: if we take 6 actions: \n   Action at turn5: leads to y6\n   Action at turn6: leads to y7\n   ...\n   Action at turn10: leads to y11.\n\nSo at turn11, we are at y11=9. So the turn index when we are at 9 is 11. Then H is the number of actions? The sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1: so the last action is at turn t1+H-1 = 5+H-1. Then we are at 9 at the next state? But we are required to be at 9 at the turn of the last action? \n\nThe problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo we must be at 9 at the same turn when we take the last action? \n\nBut the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t. Then we take an action a_t and then we get y_{t+1}. So the position at turn t is y_t.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nIn our sequence:\n\n   Turn t1: 5 -> y5=3\n   Turn 6: y6\n   Turn 7: y7\n   ...\n   Turn 5+H-1: y_{5+H-1}=9.\n\nWe have to go from 3 to 9 in (5+H-1 - 5) = H-1 turns? \n\nActually, the state at turn5: y5=3.\nAt turn6: y6 = y5 + a5.\nAt turn7: y7 = y6 + a6 = y5 + a5 + a6.\n...\nAt turn5+k: y_{5+k} = 3 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{5+i}\n\nWe require y_{5+H-1} = 9.\n\nThe minimal H? The minimal number of actions? \n\nThe minimal k = H-1 such that we can go from 3 to 9 in k steps? The minimal k is 6 (by always going up). Then H-1=6 -> H=7.\n\nBut then the last turn index is 5+7-1=11? \n\nSo we want to be at y11=9.\n\nAnd we take 7 actions: at turns 5,6,7,8,9,10,11? But wait, the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: so t from 0 to 6? meaning turns 5+0=5 to 5+6=11. So we take an action at turn11? But after taking that action, we update to y12? \n\nBut we require to be at 9 at turn11 (before taking the action at turn11? no). \n\nThe problem: at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take an action a_t to update to y_{t+1}. \n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take a_t, and then the state for the next turn is y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, to have the player at (0,9) at turn T, we must have y_T = 9 at the beginning of turn T, before taking the action.\n\nBut then we don't need to take an action at turn T? But the problem requires a sequence of actions until we reach 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9. And we do not take an action at that turn? But the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nActually, the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn, we might move away? \n\nThe problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we do not necessarily have to take an action? But the sequence of actions is defined for t from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nHowever, note that the action at the last turn (t1+H-1) might cause us to leave 9? But we are only required to be at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". And then we take the action at that turn? and then we are at y_{t1+H} which might be 10? but that is not allowed because y must be in [0,9]. \n\nActually, the problem says we must avoid collisions until we reach (0,9). Once we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we have reached. The action at that turn might be arbitrary? but we must not leave the grid? \n\nBut note: the problem does not say we have to stay at 9. It only says to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we can then move away? But that would be strange.\n\nHowever, the minimal H is achieved by being at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 and then we stop? but the sequence of actions is defined for H actions? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we take H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nBut the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are at (0,9). Then after that action, we go to y_{t1+H} = 9 + a_{t1+H-1}. But we must have y_{t1+H} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9, we cannot go up (would be 10, invalid). We can go down to 8 or stay at 9.\n\nBut we are only required to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. The subsequent state is not required to be 9.\n\nHowever, to minimize H, we want to get to 9 as quickly as possible. So we can take an action at the last turn that keeps us at 9? or moves down? but that would be extra. \n\nAlternatively, we can reach 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 and then take an action that is allowed. But the minimal H: the minimal number of turns from start to the turn we are at 9.\n\nThe minimal number of steps (actions) to go from 3 to 9 is 6. So we can be at 9 at the beginning of turn 5+6 = 11? \n\nBut how?\n\n   Turn5: start at 3. Then we take an action at turn5: U -> then at turn6: we are at 4.\n   ...\n   At turn10: we are at 8. Then we take action at turn10: U -> then at turn11: we are at 9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9. Then we have taken 6 actions: at turns5,6,7,8,9,10. So H=6? Then the last turn we take an action is at turn10 (which is t1+5) and we are at 9 at turn11? But the requirement is to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 5+6-1=10? \n\nBut we are at 9 at turn11, not turn10.\n\nTo be at 9 at the beginning of turn10: then we must have taken actions that get us to 9 at turn10.\n\nWe start at turn5: 3.\nturn6: 3 + a5\nturn7: 3 + a5 + a6\n...\nturn10: 3 + a5+a6+a7+a8+a9 = 9.\n\nSo we need 5 actions: a5 to a9 (at turns5,6,7,8,9) to get from 3 to 9? That would require an average of (9-3)/5 = 1.2 per step? But we can only do +1 per step? So impossible.\n\nTherefore, we must be at 9 at turn11? by taking 6 actions: from turn5 to turn10. Then we are at 9 at turn11. Then t1+H-1 = 5+H-1=11 -> so H=7.\n\nBut that seems odd: we take 6 actions (over 6 turns) to go up 6 steps, but we are at 9 at turn11, which is the 7th turn? \n\nThe turns: \n   turn5: start at 3 (before any action)\n   turn6: at 4 (after first action U at turn5)\n   turn7: at 5 (after U at turn6)\n   turn8: at 6\n   turn9: at 7\n   turn10: at 8\n   turn11: at 9 (after U at turn10)\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn11. The actions were taken at turns5,6,7,8,9,10: 6 actions. \n\nBut the problem requires a sequence of H actions and to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIf we set H=6, then t1+H-1=5+6-1=10. But we are at 9 at turn11, not turn10.\n\nIf we set H=7, then t1+H-1=5+7-1=11, and we are at 9 at turn11. And we take 7 actions: at turns5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nBut at turn11, we are already at 9. Then we take an action at turn11: what action? We can choose S (stay) so that we remain at 9 at turn12? But we don't care about turn12. But the requirement is to be at 9 at turn11 (the beginning) and then we take an action at turn11. That action does not affect the requirement.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   Actions: \n        turn5: U\n        turn6: U\n        turn7: U\n        turn8: U\n        turn9: U\n        turn10: U\n        turn11: S   (or any action that doesn't take us out of bounds, but S is safe)\n\nThen the state at turn11: we start at 9. Then we do S, and then at turn12 we are still at 9.\n\nBut we only require to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11. And we have taken 7 actions (from turn5 to turn11). So H=7.\n\nAlternatively, we could do without the last S? But the problem requires a sequence of actions until turn t1+H-1, and we are at 9 at that turn. \n\nBut if we do only 6 actions (t5 to t10), then we are at 9 at turn11, but we haven't taken an action at turn11? and the sequence is only until turn10. Then turn11 is not included. But we are at 9 at turn11, which is after the last action? \n\nThe problem: we are to provide a sequence for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nIn this scenario, if we stop at turn10 (last action at turn10), then we are at 9 at turn11, which is after the last action. But we are not at 9 at the last action turn (turn10) because at turn10 we were at 8.\n\nSo we must include the turn when we are at 9 at the beginning. Therefore, we must have an action at the turn when we are at 9? \n\nHence, the minimal H: we need 6 up moves, and then we must have a turn where we are at 9 and we take an action (which can be S). So total turns: 7.\n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 faster? \n\nWe start at turn5 at y=3. We want to be at y=9 at the beginning of a turn. The soonest is turn11, as above.\n\nTherefore, H=7.\n\nNow, we must check if the entire path is safe.\n\nThe path: \n   turn5: y5=3 -> safe (as computed: freeway3 at T=5 is safe)\n   turn6: y6=4 -> freeway4: check T=6: \n        freeway4: dangerous at T=5,12,13,14 -> T=6: safe.\n   turn7: y7=5 -> freeway5: safe for T>=5 (as computed)\n   turn8: y8=6 -> freeway6: safe\n   turn9: y9=7 -> freeway7: safe\n   turn10: y10=8 -> freeway8: safe\n   turn11: y11=9 -> safe (freeway9 has no cars)\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\n   Turn5: U\n   Turn6: U\n   Turn7: U\n   Turn8: U\n   Turn9: U\n   Turn10: U\n   Turn11: S   (to stay at 9, but we could also do D? but that would leave, so S is safe and keeps us at 9 for the next state)\n\nBut note: at turn11, we are at 9 and we take an action. We can take any action? but we must not go out of bounds: if we take U, we go to 10 which is invalid. So we must take S or D. But D would go to 8, which is safe? but we are only required to be at 9 at turn11 (the beginning). So we can take D? but that would move us away. The problem doesn't require us to stay. However, to be safe, we can take S.\n\nBut the problem only requires to avoid collisions until we reach (0,9). Once we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn11, we have reached. The subsequent action and state are not constrained? except that we must not leave the grid? \n\nBut the update rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, and it must be in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and take U, we get 10 which is invalid. So we cannot take U. We can take S or D.\n\nBut the problem does not specify what happens after we reach (0,9). We only care about the path until we first reach (0,9). \n\nHowever, the sequence of actions must be defined for H actions. And the last action is at turn11. Then the state at turn12 is 9+S=9 or 9+D=8. \n\nBut we are only concerned about collisions until we have reached (0,9) at turn11. The collision condition at turn11: we are at y11=9 -> no cars on freeway9, so safe. Then at turn11, we take an action: if we take D, then at turn11 we are on freeway9 (so safe) and then we move to y12=8. But at turn11, we are only required to be at 9? and then we can do anything. \n\nHowever, to be consistent, we can take S.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the player to remain at 9. So we can choose any valid action.\n\nBut to minimize the impact, we choose S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n   Turn5: U\n   Turn6: U\n   Turn7: U\n   Turn8: U\n   Turn9: U\n   Turn10: U\n   Turn11: S\n\nBut wait: we are at turn11: y11=9. Then we take S -> y12=9. But we are not required to be at 9 at turn12. \n\nBut is there a reason to not take S? No.\n\nAlternatively, we could have taken an extra move? but that would be more turns.\n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 earlier? \n\nSuppose we go up twice as fast? But we can only move up by 1 per turn. \n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nBut what about the dangerous freeway4 at T=12,13,14? We are at freeway4 only at turn6 (if we go straight up). And turn6=5+1=6, which is before 12. So safe.\n\nBut what if we are forced to wait? In this case, we are not.\n\nBut let me check if we can be at 9 earlier? \n\nWe start at turn5: y5=3.\nIf we could be at 9 at turn10: that would be 5 steps? but 3+5=8, not 9. \nAt turn11: 3+6=9 -> so minimal.\n\nBut is there a path that takes only 6 actions? Then we would be at 9 at turn11, but the last action would be at turn10. Then the sequence would be 6 actions: turns5 to 10. Then we are at 9 at turn11. But the problem requires that we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 5+6-1=10. But we are at 9 at turn11, not turn10. So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, H=7.\n\nBut let me verify the freeway4 at T=6: we said it is safe. How?\n\nFreeway4 has three cars:\n\nCar1: (-28,-39,right,4) -> at T=6: \n   L = -39 + 4*(6-5) = -39+4 = -35\n   R = -28+4 = -24 -> [ -35, -24] -> 0 not in.\n\nCar2: (8,-3,right,4) -> \n   L = -3 +4*(1) = 1\n   R = 8+4=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nCar3: (44,33,right,4) -> \n   L = 33+4=37, R=44+4=48 -> 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5 at T=7: \n   Car1: (12,1,right,12) -> at T=7: \n        L=1+12*(2)=1+24=25, R=12+24=36 -> safe.\n   Car2: (60,49,right,12) -> L=49+24=73, R=60+24=84 -> safe.\n\nSame for freeways 6,7,8.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut what about freeway4 at T=5? we are not on it at T=5.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is 7 turns.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". What is a turn? The player takes an action per turn. So we take 7 actions: from turn5 to turn11.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the turn indices: \n   Turn 5: a_{5} = U\n   Turn 6: a_{6} = U\n   ...\n   Turn 11: a_{11} = S\n\nAnd at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9. Then we take S and remain at 9 for turn12, but we don't care.\n\nAlternatively, we could do D at turn11? but that would be:\n\n   Turn11: D -> then at turn12: y12=8.\n\nBut that is also safe? but then we leave 9. The problem doesn't require to stay.\n\nHowever, to be safe and not risk anything, we choose S.\n\nBut the problem does not specify, so either is acceptable? but S is simpler.\n\nBut note: if we do D at turn11, then we are at 8 at turn12. But at turn12, if we were to check, freeway8: \n   freeway8: cars (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12) -> at T=12 (which is turn12=5+7? relative to t1=5: T=12 -> T-5=7)\n        car1: L=1+12*7=1+84=85, R=12+84=96 -> safe.\n        car2: L=49+84=133, R=60+84=144 -> safe.\n\nSo safe. But we don't need to care. \n\nSo we can choose D as well? but why would we? \n\nThe problem requires minimal H and any sequence that minimizes H and avoids collisions. We have a sequence with H=7.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=6? \n\nIf we are at 9 at turn10 (which would be t1+5, so H=6: t1 to t1+5) then we require y_{5+6-1}=y_{10}=9.\n\nBut we start at 3 at turn5. To get to 9 at turn10, we need 5 moves: 3 + 5 moves = 8 if all U? so we cannot get to 9 in 5 moves. \n\nTherefore, no.\n\nSo we output the sequence with H=7.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7.\n\nBut let me see if we can avoid the last action? \n\nThe problem: the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1. And we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we want to be at 9 at turn10 (t1+5, so t1+H-1=10 -> H=6), then we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn10. But we cannot get to 9 in 5 moves from 3.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=7.\n\nOne more thing: what if we move faster by going up twice in a row? but we are already doing that. \n\nOr what if we use a different route? for example, go down to 2? then we have to cover more distance. That would take more turns.\n\nSo the minimal is 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 7. The sequence of actions is designed to move the player upward as quickly as possible while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n- At turn 5, the player is at \\(y = 3\\). Freeway 3 has a car with span \\([-44, -33]\\) at turn 5, which does not contain 0, so it is safe to stay or move. Moving up to \\(y = 4\\) is safe and progresses toward the goal.\n- At turn 6, the player is at \\(y = 4\\). Freeway 4 has cars, but at turn 6:\n  - Car 1: span \\([-39 + 4(6-5), -28 + 4(6-5)] = [-35, -24]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: span \\([-3 + 4(6-5), 8 + 4(6-5)] = [1, 12]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Car 3: span \\([33 + 4(6-5), 44 + 4(6-5)] = [37, 48]\\), 0 not in span.\n  Moving up to \\(y = 5\\) is safe.\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\(y = 5\\). Freeway 5 has cars, but at turn 7:\n  - Car 1: span \\([1 + 12(7-5), 12 + 12(7-5)] = [25, 36]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: span \\([49 + 12(7-5), 60 + 12(7-5)] = [73, 84]\\), 0 not in span.\n  Moving up to \\(y = 6\\) is safe.\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 has the same car configuration as freeway 5, and at turn 8, the spans are similarly safe. Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) is safe.\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 has the same car configuration, and at turn 9, the spans are safe. Moving up to \\(y = 8\\) is safe.\n- At turn 10, the player is at \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 has the same car configuration, and at turn 10, the spans are safe. Moving up to \\(y = 9\\) is safe, and the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, the player is at \\(y = 9\\). Freeway 9 has no cars, so it is safe. The action \\(S\\) (stay) is chosen to remain at \\(y = 9\\), as moving up would go out of bounds (\\(y = 10\\) is invalid), and moving down is unnecessary but would be safe. However, \\(S\\) is optimal to stay at the goal.\n\nThe sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(11 = t_1 + H - 1 = 5 + 7 - 1\\) with \\(H = 7\\) turns. The actions avoid all dangerous freeway conditions:\n- Freeway 4 is dangerous at turns 12, 13, 14, but the player is on freeway 4 only at turn 6, which is safe.\n- Freeways 1, 2, 3 are dangerous at turns 16–19, but the player moves upward and is not on these freeways at those turns.\n- Freeways 5–8 are safe for all turns \\(\\geq 5\\).\n\nThe sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 4) on turn t1 = 6. I need to get to (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, moving up, down, or staying, while avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving left or right, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway where a car spans x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nThe key point is that when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move up from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. Similarly for down.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions: U (up), D (down), or S (stay) for each turn starting from t=6, until I reach y=9.\n\nCurrent y=4 at t=6.\n\nThe goal is y=9, so I need to move up. But I have to avoid the cars on rows 1 through 8.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn t1=6.\n\nFor each freeway k (which is the y-level), there are cars defined by (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right means increasing x, left means decreasing x? But in the car update, it says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], which is confusing because τ is tail, h is head, but if it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail, so [τ, h] with τ < h I assume.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h > τ? Let me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it says [h, τ], and h - s dt, etc.\n\nI think I need to interpret the span correctly.\n\nAlso, collision occurs only if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway I'm on at that turn.\n\nAnd when I move, I'm not on the new row until the next turn.\n\nNow, let's list all cars at t=6 for each row.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, and span is given as (h, τ) = (-30, -41). But for right-moving, the head should be on the right, so if it's moving right, tail is at -41, head at -30? That seems odd because -30 > -41, so if it's moving right, head at -30, tail at -41, so the car is from x=-41 to x=-30? But at x negative, moving right means increasing x.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates: head and tail, with direction indicating movement.\n\nFor right-moving, at time t, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I think.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but for the update, for right-moving, they use Span(t1) = [τ, h] for the update formula.\n\nLook: \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\"\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\"\n\nBut in the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for a right-moving car, head is the front when moving right, so for example, if moving right, head at higher x, tail at lower x.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\n-30 is greater than -41, so if right-moving, head at -30, tail at -41.\n\nAt t=6, span is from x=-41 to x=-30.\n\nThen for future turn T, since moving right at speed 3, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)] = [-41 + 3(T-6), -30 + 3(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nBut in the list, all cars seem to be right-moving except... let's see all.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 2: same, (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-24, -35, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (48, 37, right, 4)\n\n(48,37, right,4)? 48>37, so head 48, tail 37, moving right.\n\nBut (12,1, right,4): head 12, tail 1, moving right.\n\n(-24,-35, right,4): head -24, tail -35, since -24 > -35.\n\nFreeway 5: (24,13, right,12), (-48,-59, right,12)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 same as 5? Let's see:\n\nFreeway 5: (24,13, right,12), (-48,-59, right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (24,13, right,12), (-48,-59, right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nAll cars are right-moving except... no, all are right-moving in this case.\n\nNow, I need to find when these cars have 0 in their span for each row.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for the row I'm on, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nSince I start at y=4 at t=6, and I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but the player can be at y=0 or y=9, and since no cars there, no collision.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to 8 with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer at (0,y), so at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, at turn t=6, player is at y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be since from 4 to 9, difference 5, so if I move up every turn, I can reach in 5 turns: to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I need to check if at each step, when I'm on a freeway, no car has 0 in span at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, at the turn I move, I'm still on the current row, and only on the new row next turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=6 onwards.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t=6.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn t if y_t is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway k=y_t, 0 is in some car's span at time t.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, I need to find for which t, 0 is in the span at time t.\n\nSince all cars move at constant speed, I can find when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, let's define the span at time t for each car.\n\nGeneral: for a car at freeway k, with initial at t1=6: head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nSince all d=right, I can use the right-moving update.\n\nSpan at time T (relative to t1=6, so T = t - 6? Better to use absolute turn.\n\nSet t=0 as reference, but t1=6 is current, so let τ = t - 6, the time since t1.\n\nSo at time t, τ = t - 6.\n\nFor a car, span at time t is [τ_tail + s τ, h + s τ] for right-moving, since Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] with T=t, t1=6.\n\nIn the formula, T is the future time, t1 is current.\n\nSo for time t, let δt = t - t1 = t - 6.\n\nThen for right-moving car: Span(t) = [τ + s * δt, h + s * δt]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving it would be different, but all are right here.\n\nτ and h are given at t1.\n\nNow, 0 is in span if τ + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δt\n\nSince the car is moving right, and assuming τ < h, so the span is [min, max] with min increasing.\n\n0 in span iff min ≤ 0 ≤ max, i.e., τ + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δt\n\nSimilarly for multiple cars, if any car on that row has this.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which t, there is a car with 0 in span at time t.\n\nThen, for the player, at each turn t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and for k=y_t, there is collision at that t, then I cannot be there.\n\ny_t is the position at turn t.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: h = -30, τ = -41, s=3, d=right\n\nSpan at t: [ -41 + 3(δt), -30 + 3(δt) ] where δt = t - 6\n\n0 in span if -41 + 3δt ≤ 0 ≤ -30 + 3δt\n\nSolve:\n\n-41 + 3δt ≤ 0 => 3δt ≤ 41 => δt ≤ 41/3 ≈ 13.666, so δt ≤ 13 since integer? t integer, δt integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -30 + 3δt => 3δt ≥ 30 => δt ≥ 10\n\nAlso, -41 + 3δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -30 + 3δt\n\nSo δt ≥ ceil(30/3) = 10? 0 ≤ -30 + 3δt => 3δt ≥ 30 => δt ≥ 10\n\nAnd -41 + 3δt ≤ 0 => 3δt ≤ 41 => δt ≤ floor(41/3) = 13 since 41/3=13.666, so δt ≤ 13\n\nδt integer, t integer.\n\nSo for δt from 10 to 13 inclusive.\n\nThus at t = 6 + δt, so t=16,17,18,19? δt=10: t=16, δt=11:t=17, δt=12:t=18, δt=13:t=19\n\nt=6 + δt\n\nδt min=10, t=16\n\nδt max=13, t=19\n\nSo collision on freeway 1 at t=16,17,18,19\n\nBut only if player is on y=1 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, car (-30,-41,right,3), so same span, collision at same t=16,17,18,19\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, collision at t=16,17,18,19\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nh=-24, τ=-35, s=4\n\nSpan at t: [ -35 + 4δt, -24 + 4δt ]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 4δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 4δt\n\nWhich is -35 + 4δt ≤ 0 => 4δt ≤ 35 => δt ≤ 35/4 = 8.75, so δt ≤ 8\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -24 + 4δt => 4δt ≥ 24 => δt ≥ 6\n\nSo δt = 6,7,8\n\nt=6+6=12, t=6+7=13, t=6+8=14\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (12,1,right,4) h=12, τ=1, s=4\n\nSpan: [1 + 4δt, 12 + 4δt]\n\n0 in span: 1 + 4δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 4δt\n\nBut 1 + 4δt ≤ 0? Since δt ≥0, 1+4δt ≥1 >0, so never ≤0, thus 0 cannot be ≤ min since min =1 +4δt ≥1 >0, so 0 < min, not in span. So this car never has 0 in span.\n\nThird car on freeway 4: (48,37,right,4) h=48, τ=37, s=4\n\nSpan: [37 + 4δt, 48 + 4δt]\n\nMin=37+4δt ≥37>0, so 0 < min, not in span, never collision.\n\nSo only first car matters for freeway 4, collision at t=12,13,14\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) h=24, τ=13, s=12\n\nSpan: [13 + 12δt, 24 + 12δt]\n\nMin=13+12δt ≥13>0 for δt≥0, so never ≤0, thus 0 not in span.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12) h=-48, τ=-59, s=12\n\nSpan: [-59 + 12δt, -48 + 12δt]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 12δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 12δt\n\nWhich is -59 + 12δt ≤ 0 => 12δt ≤ 59 => δt ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so δt ≤ 4\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48 + 12δt => 12δt ≥ 48 => δt ≥ 4\n\nSo δt ≥4 and δt ≤4, so δt=4\n\nThus at t=6+4=10, collision on freeway 5 if a car is there.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: same cars as 5, so collision only at t=10\n\nFreeway 7: same, at t=10\n\nFreeway 8: same, at t=10\n\nNow, summarize collision times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: collision at t=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=2: same, t=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=3: same, t=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=4: collision at t=12,13,14 (from first car)\n\n- y=5: collision at t=10 (only at t=10)\n\n- y=6: collision at t=10\n\n- y=7: collision at t=10\n\n- y=8: collision at t=10\n\ny=4 has collision at t=12,13,14\n\nPlayer starts at t=6, y=4.\n\nAt t=6, y=4, is there collision? We need to check if at t=6, for y=4, 0 in span.\n\nFor freeway 4, at t=6, δt=0, first car span: [-35 +0, -24+0] = [-35,-24], 0 not in [-35,-24] since -35≤ x ≤ -24 <0, so 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not covering, so at t=6, no collision on y=4.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nNow, player at t=6, y=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct way: move up each turn.\n\nFrom y=4, after one up: to y=5 at t=7? Let's sequence.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at t=6, a_6, then y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\ny_6 =4\n\nIf a_6 = U, then y_7 =5\n\nIf a_6 = S, y_7=4\n\nIf a_6 = D, y_7=3, but I want to go up, so probably not down.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo reach y=9, minimal turns: if I move up every turn, starting from y=4 at t=6.\n\nAfter H turns, y_{t1 + H} = y_6 + number of ups minus downs.\n\nSince I start at t=6, after 0 actions, y=4.\n\nAfter first action at t=6, y_7 set.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t1 + H} = y_6 + sum_{i=0}^{H-1} Δy_{t1 + i}\n\nAnd I want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nSince y_6=4, need sum of Δy over H actions = +5.\n\nEach Δy is +1, -1, or 0.\n\nTo minimize H, I should use U as much as possible, so H=5 with all U, y_{11} = y_6 +5 =9 at t=11? Let's see.\n\nt=6: y=4\n\na_6: if U, y_7=5\n\na_7: if U, y_8=6\n\na_8: if U, y_9=7\n\na_9: if U, y_10=8\n\na_10: if U, y_11=9\n\nSo at t=11, y=9, reached.\n\nH=5 turns: actions at t=6 to t=10, y from 7 to 11.\n\nBut I need to check for each turn t from 6 to 10, when the player is on a freeway (y=1 to 8), if there is collision at that t.\n\nAt t=6: y=4, freeway 4. Collision at t=12,13,14, not at t=6, so safe.\n\nAt t=7: y=5, freeway 5. Collision only at t=10, not at t=7, so safe.\n\nAt t=8: y=6, freeway 6. Collision at t=10, not t=8, safe.\n\nAt t=9: y=7, freeway 7. Collision at t=10, not t=9, safe.\n\nAt t=10: y=8, freeway 8. Collision at t=10! Yes, at t=10, on y=8, collision.\n\nAt t=10, y=8, and freeway 8 has collision at t=10.\n\nTherefore, at t=10, if I am on y=8, I collide.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=10, y=8, which is freeway 8, and t=10 has collision, so I die.\n\nThus, I cannot be on y=8 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows at critical times.\n\nIn this path, I get to y=8 at t=10, but collision there.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n- Delay reaching y=8 so that not at t=10.\n\n- Or go down temporarily, but that might take more turns.\n\n- Or move slower.\n\nSince collision only at specific times, I can time the movement.\n\nNow, collision on y=8 only at t=10, similarly y=7 at t=10, etc.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all have collision only at t=10, except y=4 at t=12,13,14.\n\ny=1,2,3 at t=16-19.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so when I reach y=9, no issue.\n\nBut to reach, I need to be at y=8 at some point, then move up to y=9.\n\nAt turn T, if I am at y=8, and move U, then at turn T, I am on y=8, so if collision at T on y=8, I die.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nSo to not collide, when I am on y=8, it must not be at a collision time.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=10, y=8, collision.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=8 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5,6,7 at t=10, collision, but if I am not on them at t=10, ok.\n\nNow, since I start at y=4 at t=6.\n\nI can go up slower.\n\nFor example, stay at y=4 for some turns, but y=4 has collision at t=12,13,14, so I need to be away by then.\n\nt=12,13,14 collision on y=4.\n\nCurrently t=6, so I have time.\n\nI need to reach y=9 before or after, but minimal turns, so probably not after.\n\nH=5 is minimal if possible, but not due to collision.\n\nWith H=5, I must be at y=8 at t=10 to reach y=9 at t=11, but at t=10 on y=8 collision.\n\nIf I move up later, but then H larger.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 earlier or something.\n\nList the times when each row is dangerous.\n\nDanger times for each row:\n\n- y=4: t=12,13,14\n\n- y=5: t=10\n\n- y=6: t=10\n\n- y=7: t=10\n\n- y=8: t=10\n\n- y=1,2,3: t=16,17,18,19 (but I don't plan to go down)\n\ny=9 safe always.\n\nI start at t=6, y=4.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn, say T.\n\nTo minimize H, T should be as small as possible.\n\nFrom t=6, after k actions, at turn t=6+k, y= y6 + net up.\n\ny6=4.\n\nIf I use U all, at t=11, y=9 as before.\n\nBut to avoid collision at t=10 on y=8.\n\nAt t=10, y=8 is bad, but in the sequence, I am there.\n\nI could be at a different y at t=10.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=4 for one extra turn.\n\nAt t=6, if I do S (stay), then y7=4\n\nThen a7=U, y8=5\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=6: y=4, safe (no collision at t=6)\n\nt=7: y=4, safe (t=7 not danger for y=4, danger at 12-14)\n\nt=8: y=5, freeway 5, collision only at t=10, not t=8, safe.\n\nt=9: y=6, freeway 6, collision at t=10, not t=9, safe.\n\nt=10: y=7, freeway 7, collision at t=10! Yes, at t=10, on y=7, collision.\n\nBecause y=7 has collision at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay longer.\n\nSuppose I move up but slower.\n\nFor example, from y=4, go to y=5 at some point.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at t=10.\n\nBecause all of them have collision at t=10.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all collide at t=10.\n\nSo at t=10, I must not be on y=5,6,7, or 8.\n\nWhere can I be at t=10?\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4,9.\n\ny=9 is goal, but if I reach earlier.\n\ny=4: at t=10, is it safe? y=4 danger at t=12,13,14, not at t=10, so safe.\n\ny=3: danger at t=16-19, not t=10, safe.\n\netc.\n\nBut I start from y=4, need to go up.\n\nIf at t=10, I am on y=4, for example, then I can move up later.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nt=6: y=4\n\nI need to be at y=9.\n\nSuppose I want to be not on 5-8 at t=10.\n\nSo at t=10, y should be <=4 or >=9.\n\nBut y=9 requires previous y=8.\n\nSo if at t=10, y=9, that means at t=9, I was on y=8 and moved up.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am on y=8, is it safe? y=8 danger only at t=10, not at t=9, so at t=9 on y=8 safe, then move U to y=9 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I reach earlier.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach by t=10.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=10, I need y_{10} =9.\n\ny_{10} = y6 + sum_{t=6 to 9} Δy_t\n\ny6=4, so sum from t=6 to 9 of Δy_t must be +5.\n\nThat's 4 actions: t=6,7,8,9 actions for y_{7} to y_{10}.\n\ny_{10} set by a_9.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nAt turn t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo for y at turn T, it is set by actions before.\n\ny_{t} for t>=6.\n\ny_6 =4 (given)\n\nAfter a_6, y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\nAfter a_7, y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{T}, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nSo to have y_{T+1} =9 for some T+1.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nNow, to have y_K =9 for some K.\n\nFor example, y_{11} =9 with 5 ups as before.\n\ny_{10} =9: need to reach by t=10.\n\ny_{10} = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\ny_6=4, so Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 = +5\n\nSince each Δy <=1, need all 4 actions to be U, so y_{10} =4 +4*1 =8? y_{10} = y_6 + sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i\n\ny_6=4\n\ny_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7\n\ny_9 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8\n\ny_10 = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nSo for y_10 =9, need Δy_6 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 =5\n\nBut each Δy is at most +1, so sum at most 4, so y_10 <= 4+4=8, cannot be 9 with 4 actions.\n\nMinimum to reach y=9 is 5 actions: from y_6=4, after 5 ups, y_11=9.\n\nSimilarly, with downs, more actions.\n\nSo minimal H is at least 5, but with 5 actions, y_11=9, but to get there, at some point I must be on y=8.\n\nIn the sequence, I am on y=8 at t=10 for the direct path.\n\nBut I can be on y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I delay moving up.\n\nSuppose at t=6, I do S: y7=4\n\nThen a7=U, y8=5\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nNow, at t=10, y=7, which is dangerous at t=10, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I do U at t=6: y7=5\n\nThen if I do S at t=7: y8=5\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\na9=U, y10=7  // at t=10 y=7, collision\n\nOr a9=S, y10=6, then a10=U, y11=7, a11=U, y12=8, a12=U, y13=9, H larger.\n\nTo avoid being on 5-8 at t=10, I need at t=10 to be on y<=4 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not possible by t=10, as above.\n\nSo must be on y<=4 at t=10.\n\ny<=4 means y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nI am at y=4 at t=6.\n\nIf I stay or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nSo suppose at t=10, I am on y=4.\n\nThen from t=6 to t=10, I need to have y_t <=4 for t=6 to 10, but at t=10 y=4.\n\nSince y starts at 4, to stay or decrease, but I need to go up eventually.\n\ny_t for t=6 to 10.\n\ny_6=4\n\nIf I do all S, y_7=4, y_8=4, y_9=4, y_10=4\n\nThen at t=10, y=4, safe.\n\nThen after that, I can move up.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9, need +5, so at least 5 more actions.\n\nFor example, a10=U, y11=5\n\na11=U, y12=6\n\na12=U, y13=7\n\na13=U, y14=8\n\na14=U, y15=9\n\nBut at t=14, y=8, and y=8 has collision only at t=10, not other times, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, check other times.\n\nt=11: y=5, freeway 5, collision only at t=10, not t=11, safe.\n\nt=12: y=6, freeway 6, collision only at t=10, not t=12, safe.\n\nt=13: y=7, freeway 7, collision only at t=10, not t=13, safe.\n\nt=14: y=8, freeway 8, collision only at t=10, not t=14, safe.\n\nt=15: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=12,13,14, I am moving through, but y=4 has danger at t=12,13,14, but at t=12, I am on y=6, not y=4.\n\nt=12: y=6, which is safe.\n\nOnly y=4 is dangerous at t=12,13,14, but I am not on y=4 at those times.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=12, y=6, not 4.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut H is larger: I used actions from t=6 to t=14, 9 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions at t=6 to t=14 for y up to t=15.\n\nBut I need the sequence until I reach y=9.\n\nIn this case, I stayed from t=6 to t=9: actions a6 to a9.\n\nt=6: a6=S, y7=4\n\nt=7: a7=S, y8=4? Better to list turns.\n\nTurn t: action a_t, then position at turn t is before action or after?\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t, then I take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo for collision, at turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=6: y=4, I take a6, say S, then y7=4\n\nt=7: y=4, take a7, say S, then y8=4\n\nt=8: y=4, take a8, say S, then y9=4\n\nt=9: y=4, take a9, say S, then y10=4\n\nNow t=10: y=4, take a10=U, then y11=5\n\nt=11: y=5, take a11=U, then y12=6\n\nt=12: y=6, take a12=U, then y13=7\n\nt=13: y=7, take a13=U, then y14=8\n\nt=14: y=8, take a14=U, then y15=9\n\nReached at t=15.\n\nNumber of actions H: from t=6 to t=14, that's 9 actions? t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14: 9 turns, but H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe sequence is {a_t for t= t1 to t1 + H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t1=6, after H actions, at turn 6+H, y=9.\n\nHere at turn 15, y=9, so 6+H=15, H=9.\n\nBut earlier with direct, H=5 but not possible.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nInstead of staying from t=6 to t=9, I can move up to y=5 or something earlier, as long as not on 5-8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, I need to be on y<=4 or y=9.\n\nSince y=9 not possible, on y<=4.\n\nFor example, I can go up to y=5 before t=10, but then at t=10, if on y=5, collision.\n\nSo I need to be on y<=4 at t=10.\n\ny<=4 means y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, from t=6, y=4, I can move down to y=3 or stay.\n\nBut moving down might not be efficient.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are only dangerous at t=10, I can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=5 at t=7 or t=8, etc., as long as not at t=10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo to minimize H, I should move up as much as possible except avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, I need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at t=10.\n\nAlso, for y=4, avoid at t=12,13,14.\n\nBut t=12,13,14 are later.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSuppose I go up directly but skip t=10.\n\nFor example, at t=6: U, y7=5\n\nt=7: U, y8=6\n\nt=8: U, y9=7\n\nNow at t=9, y=7, I need to not be on y=8 at t=10 if I move up, but at t=9, if I move U, y10=8, then at t=10, y=8, collision.\n\nIf at t=9 I do S, y10=7, but at t=10 y=7, collision because y=7 dangerous at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, if I do D, y10=6, then at t=10 y=6, collision.\n\nSo at t=9, if I am on y=7, whatever I do, at t=10 I will be on y=6,7, or 8, all dangerous.\n\nIf I am on y=6 at t=9, same thing, move to 5,6,7 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly for y=5 or y=8.\n\nThe only way to avoid being on 5-8 at t=10 is to be on y<=4 or y=9 at t=10.\n\nSince y=9 not possible, on y<=4.\n\nTherefore, at t=10, I must be on y<=4.\n\nThen after that, I can move up.\n\nNow, from t=6 to t=10, I need to go from y=4 to y<=4 in a way that I can then go up.\n\nSince I start at y=4, I can stay there or move down and up, but moving down costs extra turns.\n\nMinimal turns: stay at y=4 until t=10, then start moving up.\n\nBut at t=10, y=4, then move up to y=9 in 5 turns: at t=15 y=9 as before.\n\nBut I can move up a bit before, as long as at t=10 I am at y<=4.\n\nFor example, at t=6: U, to y7=5\n\nBut at t=7 y=5, which is not dangerous yet, since danger only at t=10.\n\nThen at t=7: I need to go down or stay, but if I stay, y8=5, then I have to deal with t=8,9.\n\nIf at t=7 y=5, I can go down to y=4 at t=8.\n\na7=D, then y8=4\n\nThen at t=8 y=4\n\nThen I can stay or something.\n\nBut at t=10, I need y= something <=4.\n\nLet's list the positions.\n\nt=6: y=4\n\nOption 1: a6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7: y=5\n\nNow at t=7, I can do a7=S: y8=5\n\nOr a7=D: y8=4\n\nOr a7=U: y8=6\n\nBut I need to be <=4 at t=10.\n\nt=10 is 3 turns from t=7.\n\nIf a7=D, y8=4\n\nThen t=8: y=4\n\nThen I can do a8=S or U or D.\n\nIf I want y10<=4.\n\ny10 depends on actions.\n\nFrom t=8, y=4\n\ny10 = y8 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\ny8=4, so y10 = 4 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\nΔy8 and Δy9 each -1,0,1.\n\nSo y10 = 4 + something between -2 and 2, so y10 between 2 and 6.\n\nI need y10 <=4, so possible with Δy8 and Δy9 not both positive, or one zero or negative.\n\nFor example, if both S, y10=4\n\nIf one U one S, y10=5\n\nIf one U one D, y10=4\n\nIf both U, y10=6\n\n Etc.\n\nTo have y10<=4, I need not to have net increase.\n\nBut since I need to go up later, I might as well not move up much now.\n\nBack to t=7 y=5.\n\nIf I do a7=D, y8=4\n\nThen t=8 y=4\n\nThen to have y10<=4, I can do a8=S and a9=S, then y10=4\n\nOr other combinations.\n\nBut I used a move down, which costs extra.\n\nIf at t=7 y=5, I do a7=S, y8=5\n\nThen t=8 y=5\n\nThen y10 = y8 + Δy8 + Δy9 =5 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\nTo have y10<=4, need Δy8 + Δy9 <= -1, so at least one down.\n\nFor example, a8=D, y9=4, then a9=S, y10=4\n\nOr a8=S, y9=5, a9=D, y10=4\n\nEtc.\n\nBut again, I have to move down.\n\nIf I stay at y=4 from beginning, no down moves.\n\nBut let's see the minimal H.\n\nThe critical point is to be below at t=10.\n\nThen from t=10 y=4, I need to go to y=9, which takes 5 moves: a10 to a14, y15=9.\n\nH=9 as before.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 faster by not staying all time.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=5 early, but then come down before t=10.\n\nBut that might not save turns.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are safe except at t=10, I can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=8 at t=9 or t=11, etc.\n\nIn the direct path, I was on y=8 at t=10, bad.\n\nIf I can be on y=8 at t=9, for example.\n\nThen move U at t=9 to y=10? y=10 not exist, y max 9.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so if at y=8, U to y=9.\n\nOr at y=9, stay.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 at some turn and move U.\n\nAt that turn, when I am on y=8, it must not be dangerous time.\n\ny=8 dangerous only at t=10, so other times safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for y=8, I can be there at t=9 or t=11, etc.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8, I need to come from below.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence to minimize H.\n\nStart t=6, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSuppose I move up immediately.\n\na6=U, y7=5  // t=7 y=5, safe\n\na7=U, y8=6  // t=8 y=6, safe (danger only t=10)\n\na8=U, y9=7  // t=9 y=7, safe\n\nNow at t=9, y=7.\n\nIf I move U, y10=8, but at t=10 y=8 collision.\n\nIf I move S, y10=7, at t=10 y=7 collision.\n\nIf I move D, y10=6, at t=10 y=6 collision.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at t=9, because whatever I do, at t=10 I am on 6,7, or 8, all dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=6 at t=9, same issue: move to 5,6,7 at t=10.\n\nIf on y=5 at t=9, move to 4,5,6 at t=10; y=4 is safe, but y=5 and 6 dangerous.\n\nIf at t=9 on y=5, and I move D to y=4, then at t=10 y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can proceed up.\n\nBut I wasted a down move.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=8 at t=9, move to 7,8,9; y=9 safe, but if move U to y=9, at t=10 y=9 safe, but to move U at t=9, I need to be on y=8 at t=9.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, to be on y=8 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=8.\n\nFrom start, t=6 y=4\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\na8=U, y9=7  // not 8\n\nTo be y9=8, need from y6=4, in 3 actions: a6,a7,a8 to set y7,y8,y9.\n\ny9 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8\n\n4 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 =8, so Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 =4\n\nSince each <=1, must all be U.\n\nSo a6=U, y7=5\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\na8=U, y9=7? y9 = y8 + Δy8 =6 +1=7 if a8=U\n\ny9 is position at turn 9, set after a8.\n\nAfter a8, y9 = y8 + Δy8\n\ny8 = y7 + Δy7\n\ny7 = y6 + Δy6\n\nSo with a6=U, y7=5\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nTo have y9=8, I need y8=7 or something, but from above, y9=7, not 8.\n\nThe only way to have y9=8 is if at t=8, y=8, but y8=6 after a7=U.\n\ny8=6, then a8=U, y9=7.\n\nI cannot reach y=8 by t=9 with from y=4 in 3 actions.\n\nMaximum y9=7 with 3 ups.\n\nSimilarly, y10=8 with 4 actions: as earlier.\n\nSo earliest to be at y=8 is at t=10 with 4 ups: y10=8.\n\nBut at t=10, y=8 collision.\n\nNext, at t=11, I can be at y=8.\n\nFor example, with delays.\n\nBut let's find a sequence with H smaller than 9.\n\nSince I have to be <=4 at t=10, and then go up.\n\nBut from t=10 y=4 to y=9, 5 actions, y15=9.\n\nH=9 actions from t=6 to t=14.\n\nActions at t=6 to t=14, 9 actions, reach at t=15.\n\nBut I can start moving up before t=10, as long as at t=10 I am <=4.\n\nFor example, at t=6: U, to y7=5  // safe\n\nThen at t=7: since at y=5, I need to go down to be low at t=10.\n\na7=D, to y8=4  // down\n\nt=8: y=4, I can stay or move.\n\nTo have y10<=4.\n\nIf at t=8 y=4, I can do a8=S, y9=4\n\na9=S, y10=4\n\nThen a10=U, y11=5\n\netc.\n\nBut I used a down move, so to go up, I need extra up, so same number or more.\n\nFrom y7=5 at t=7, if I do a7=S, y8=5\n\nThen to have y10<=4, need to go down, e.g. a8=D, y9=4, a9=S, y10=4\n\nThen y10=4, then a10=U, y11=5, a11=U, y12=6, a12=U, y13=7, a13=U, y14=8, a14=U, y15=9\n\nSame as before, 9 actions.\n\nAt t=9, y=4, a9=U, y10=5, but at t=10 y=5, collision! Because y=5 dangerous at t=10.\n\nIn the sequence above, when I have y10=4 at t=10, then a10=U, y11=5, but at t=11, y=5, which is safe since danger only t=10.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut if I do a9=U when y9=4, then y10=5, at t=10 y=5 collision.\n\nSo I must not move up at t=9 if I want to be low at t=10.\n\nSo in the sequence where I am at y=4 at t=9, I should not move U at t=9, but move U at t=10 or later.\n\nAt t=9, if y=4, I can do a9=S, y10=4, then a10=U, y11=5, etc.\n\nOr a9=D, but not necessary.\n\nSo minimal way is to stay at y=4 until t=10.\n\nThen from there, move up each turn to y=9 at t=15.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=6: y=4, take a6=S? Or whatever, but to stay, a6=S, y7=4\n\nSimilarly, a7=S, y8=4\n\na8=S, y9=4\n\na9=S, y10=4  // at t=10 y=4, safe\n\nThen a10=U, y11=5  // t=11 y=5, safe (danger t=10 only)\n\na11=U, y12=6  // t=12 y=6, safe\n\na12=U, y13=7  // t=13 y=7, safe\n\na13=U, y14=8  // t=14 y=8, safe (danger t=10 only)\n\na14=U, y15=9  // reached\n\nNow, are there any other dangers? For example, at t=12, y=6, but y=6 danger only at t=10, not t=12, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=12? No, at t=12 y=6.\n\ny=4 has danger at t=12,13,14, but I am not on y=4 at those times; at t=12 y=6, t=13 y=7, t=14 y=8, all other rows.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nH=9 actions: from t=6 to t=14.\n\nBut can I do with less?\n\nFor example, if I go up to y=5 early and come down, but that might not save.\n\nSuppose at t=6: U, y7=5\n\nThen at t=7: D, y8=4  // back to 4\n\nThen I have wasted two moves to stay at same, net zero.\n\nThen I need to stay or move.\n\nAt t=8: y=4, same as before.\n\nThen to be at y=4 at t=10, I need to stay or move down, but y=4, so stay.\n\nThen from t=10 y=4, same as before.\n\nBut I used extra actions, so H larger.\n\nIf I go to y=6 and back, worse.\n\nSo staying put is better.\n\nBut is there a way to reach before t=15?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=8 at t=11.\n\nThen move U to y=9 at t=12.\n\nTo be on y=8 at t=11.\n\ny11=8.\n\nFrom y6=4, need y11 = y6 + sum_{t=6 to 10} Δy_t =4 + Δy6+Δy7+Δy8+Δy9+Δy10 =8\n\nSo sum of 5 Δy = +4.\n\nSince each between -1 and 1, possible, for example, four U and one S, or three U and one D and one S, etc.\n\nBut net +4 in 5 actions.\n\nFor example, U,U,U,U,S or U,U,U,S,U etc., y11=8.\n\nThen at t=11, y=8, which is safe, since danger only t=10.\n\nThen a11=U, y12=9.\n\nReached at t=12.\n\nH=6 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=11 for y up to t=12.\n\nt=6: a6, set y7\n\n...\n\nt=11: a11, set y12\n\nTo have y12=9.\n\ny12 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10 + Δy11\n\ny6=4, so need sum_{i=6 to 11} Δy_i = +5\n\n6 actions, each at most +1, so possible with all U except one not U, but need +5, so five U and one S, or four U and two S, but +5 requires five +1 and one 0, so five U and one S.\n\nFor example, actions: five U and one S in some order.\n\nThen y12=4 +5 =9.\n\nNow, at which turn to have the S.\n\nAlso, need to avoid collision.\n\nNow, positions at each turn.\n\nt=6: y=4, take a6\n\nSuppose a6=U, then y7=5\n\nt=7: y=5, take a7, suppose U, y8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, take a8, suppose U, y9=7\n\nt=9: y=7, take a9, now if a9=U, y10=8, but at t=10 y=8 collision if I go there.\n\ny10=8, but at turn t=10, position y=8, dangerous.\n\nBut I need to have one S, so perhaps a9=S, then y10=7\n\nThen at t=10, y=7, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf a9=D, y10=6, at t=10 y=6 collision.\n\nSo if I am on y=7 at t=9, I cannot avoid collision at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=6 at t=9, same.\n\nTo avoid, I need to be lower at t=9.\n\nSuppose at t=9, I am on y=4 or something.\n\nBut to reach high, I need to move up.\n\nSet the S earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=6: S, y7=4\n\nThen a7=U, y8=5\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\na9=U, y10=7  // but at t=10 y=7 collision\n\nStill problem.\n\nt=6: U, y7=5\n\nt=7: S, y8=5  // a7=S\n\nThen a8=U, y9=6\n\na9=U, y10=7 // t=10 y=7 collision\n\nSame.\n\nt=6: U, y7=5\n\nt=7: U, y8=6\n\nt=8: S, y9=6  // a8=S\n\nThen a9=U, y10=7 // t=10 y=7 collision\n\nOr a9=S, y10=6, collision\n\na9=D, y10=5, collision\n\nNo.\n\nIf I have the S at t=10.\n\nFor example, actions: a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=S, a11=U\n\nThen y7=5 (t=7)\n\ny8=6 (t=8)\n\ny9=7 (t=9)\n\ny10=8 (after a9=U? a9 at t=9: if a9=U, y10=8\n\nThen at t=10, y=8, collision.\n\nThen a10=S, but at t=10 I am on y=8, collision occurs before action? The collision is at the turn, based on position before action I think.\n\nThe game: at turn t, player is at position y_t, then collision check based on y_t and cars at t, then I take action a_t, then position updates.\n\nSo at t=10, if y10=8, collision happens, game over, no action taken.\n\nSo I must not be on dangerous position at dangerous time.\n\nIn this case, with a6 to a9 all U: y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8\n\nAt t=10, y=8, collision.\n\nIf I do a10=S, but I am already collided at t=10.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach by t=12 with only one S, because to have y12=9, I need five U in six actions, so net +5 in 6 actions, but the positions at intermediate turns will force me to be on y=5,6,7,8 at t=10 or before.\n\nSpecifically, since from t=6 to t=10, with actions a6 to a9 (4 actions), y10 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\ny6=4, so y10 = 4 + sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i\n\nWith four actions, each Δy <=1, so y10 <= 4+4=8\n\nTo have y12=9, I need the later actions.\n\nBut at t=10, y10 must be <=4 to avoid collision, since if y10=5,6,7,8 all dangerous at t=10.\n\ny10 must be <=4.\n\nBut y10 = 4 + sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i\n\nSince sum <=4, y10 <=8, but to have y10 <=4, need sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i <=0\n\nThat is, net not positive, so some downs or stays.\n\nBut then for y12=9, I need sum_{i=6}^{11} Δy_i = +5\n\nBut sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i <=0, so the remaining two actions a10 and a11 must provide at least +5, but each at most +1, so +2 at most, so sum <= 0 + 2 =2 <5, impossible.\n\nsum_{i=6}^{11} Δy_i = sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i + Δy10 + Δy11 <= 0 +1 +1 =2 <5, so y12 <= 4+2=6 <9, cannot reach y=9.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach by t=12.\n\nSimilarly, for t=13: y13=9.\n\ny13 = y6 + sum_{i=6}^{12} Δy_i =4 + 7 terms, need sum=5.\n\nSo possible with five U and two S, for example.\n\nBut at t=10, y10 must be <=4.\n\ny10 =4 + sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i\n\nNeed sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i <=0\n\nThen for y13=9, need sum_{i=6}^{12} Δy_i =5\n\nBut sum_{i=6}^{12} = sum_{i=6}^9 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12\n\nsum_{i=6}^9 <=0, and Δy10 to Δy12 <=3, so sum <= 0+3=3<5, still impossible? 3<5, yes.\n\nsum <=3, but need 5, impossible.\n\ny13 = y6 + sum_{i=6}^{12} Δy_i\n\nΔy_i for i=6 to 12, that's 7 actions.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so max y13=4+7=11, but we need 9.\n\nBut with constraint.\n\ny10 =4 + sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i <=4, since y10<=4\n\nThen y13 = y10 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12\n\ny10 <=4, Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12 <=3, so y13 <=7<9, cannot reach y=9.\n\ny10 <=4, then after three actions, y13 <=4+3=7<9.\n\nBut I need y13=9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for t=14: y14=9.\n\ny14 = y6 + sum_{i=6}^{13} Δy_i =4 + 8 terms, need sum=5.\n\ny10 must be <=4.\n\ny10 =4 + sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i <=4, so sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i <=0\n\nThen y14 = y10 + sum_{i=10}^{13} Δy_i <=4 + 4 =8<9? sum from i=10 to 13, 4 actions, <=4, so y14 <=4+4=8<9.\n\ny14 = y10 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12 + Δy13\n\nSince y10 <=4, and four Δy <=4, y14 <=8<9, so cannot reach y=9 by t=14.\n\nt=14 position.\n\ny14 = position at turn 14.\n\nTo have y14=9.\n\nBut y14 <= y10 + 4 <= 4 + 4 =8 <9, yes impossible.\n\nSimilarly, t=15: y15=9.\n\ny15 = y6 + sum_{i=6}^{14} Δy_i =4 + 9 terms, need sum=5.\n\ny10 <=4.\n\ny10 =4 + sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i <=4\n\nThen y15 = y10 + sum_{i=10}^{14} Δy_i <=4 + 5 =9\n\nNow, <=9, and we need =9, so must have y10=4 and all Δy_i for i=10 to14 be U, so y15=9.\n\nAlso, from above, y10 <=4 and to have y15=9, must have y10=4 and sum_{i=10}^{14} Δy_i =5, so all U.\n\nNow, y10=4 requires that from t=6 to t=9, I stay at y=4, so all actions S or net zero with moves but back.\n\nBut minimal is to do all S from t=6 to t=9.\n\nThen a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, y15=9.\n\nAs in the first sequence.\n\nIf I move around but end up at y=4 at t=10, it might take more actions, so this is minimal H=9.\n\nBut earlier I thought H=9, but let's confirm if I can reach earlier.\n\nt=15 is the earliest possible under constraint.\n\nWithout constraint, t=11, but with constraint, due to t=10 danger, I must be low at t=10, so earliest is t=15.\n\nAnd with the sequence above.\n\nIn the sequence, I used a6 to a9 all S, but since I start at y=4, and I need to stay, I can do S.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list actions.\n\nBut at t=6, I am at y=4, and I take action.\n\nIn the sequence: for turn t=6: action S, then y7=4\n\nSimilarly for t=7,8,9: S each, y stays 4.\n\nThen t=10: U, y11=5\n\nt=11: U, y12=6\n\nt=12: U, y13=7\n\nt=13: U, y14=8\n\nt=14: U, y15=9\n\nReached.\n\nNow, about y=4 danger at t=12,13,14: at those times, I am on y=6,7,8, not y=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=8? That would reach at t=14.\n\ny14=9.\n\nBut y14 = y10 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12 + Δy13\n\ny10 <=4, and four Δy <=4, y14 <=8<9, impossible as above.\n\nSimilarly, H=7 or less worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=4 at t=12,13,14.\n\nIn the sequence, I am not on y=4 at those times.\n\nAt t=12, I am on y=6, etc.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can move up a bit before t=10, but I have to be at y<=4 at t=10, so I might go up and down, but that would require more actions to compensate, so H not smaller.\n\nFor example, go to y=5 at t=7, then down to y=4 at t=8, then at t=10 y=4, but I used extra actions.\n\nThen to reach y=9, I need more ups, so H larger or same.\n\nNot better.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nTurn t1=6 to t1+H-1=6+8=14? H=9 actions, from t=6 to t=14.\n\nt=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14: that's 9 turns.\n\nAfter that, at turn 15, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, list actions for each turn.\n\nAlso, for freeway 4, there is a car that could be at x=0, but in this path, I avoid the times.\n\nIn the beginning, I thought about going directly, but couldn't.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5,6,7,8 are safe except t=10, I could be on them at t=11,12,etc.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=11, I need to get there.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=6, to y=8 at t=11.\n\ny11=8.\n\ny11 = y6 + sum_{i=6}^{10} Δy_i =4 + 5 terms, need sum=4, so for example four U and one S.\n\nBut at t=10, I must be on y<=4 to avoid collision.\n\ny10 = position at t=10.\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy10\n\nIf y11=8, then y10 + Δy10 =8.\n\nSince Δy10 <=1, y10 >=7.\n\nBut at t=10, y10 >=7, which is y=7 or 8, both dangerous at t=10, collision.\n\nTherefore, impossible to be at y=11=8 because it requires y10=7 or 8, which collide.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at t=11, y11=9, then y10 + Δy10=9, so y10=8 or 9 (if U), or if S, y10=9, but y=9 safe, but to have y10=9, need previous, but y10=9 requires y9=8 and U or something.\n\ny10=9: from above, y10 <=8 with actions, so y10=9 impossible? y10 = y6 + sum_{i=6}^9 Δy_i <=4+4=8, so y10<=8, cannot be 9. Thus impossible to be at y=9 before t=11.\n\nEarliest y11=9 with five U from t=6 to t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, if y10=8, collision.\n\nIf I can have y10=7 or something, but dangerous.\n\nBut y10 must be <=4 to avoid collision.\n\nSo indeed, impossible before t=15.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions from t=6 to t=14.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nThen at turn 15, position (0,9)\n\nIn the action sequence, it should be for turns t=6 to t=14.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut in the answer format, it says {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, with t1=6.\n\nSo a_{6+0} to a_{6+8}, since H-1=8, so t from 0 to 8, a_{6} to a_{14}.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car that might be at x=0 at t=12,13,14, but I am not on y=4 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps I can move up earlier but skip the danger on other rows.\n\nFor example, from y=4, go directly to y=9, but I have to go through.\n\nSince no cars on y=9, but I need to be on y=8 to move up.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let's double-check the car on y=4.\n\nFreeway 4: car (-24,-35,right,4), at t=12, δt=6, span: [-35 +4*6, -24 +4*6] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 <=0<=0, so 0 included, so at t=12, on y=4, collision if there.\n\nSimilarly t=13: δt=7, [-35+28, -24+28]= [-7,4], 0 in [-7,4], yes.\n\nt=14: [-35+32, -24+32]=[-3,8], 0 in, yes.\n\nBut in sequence, at t=12, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 9. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on any dangerous freeway at the times when cars occupy \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- **Freeway 1, 2, 3**: Cars collide at \\(x = 0\\) on turns \\(t = 16, 17, 18, 19\\). These are not relevant as the player moves upward quickly and avoids these rows during these late turns.\n- **Freeway 4**: The car \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 4)\\) collides at \\(x = 0\\) on turns \\(t = 12, 13, 14\\). The player must avoid being on \\(y = 4\\) during these turns.\n- **Freeway 5, 6, 7, 8**: Cars collide at \\(x = 0\\) on turn \\(t = 10\\). The player must avoid being on \\(y = 5, 6, 7,\\) or \\(8\\) at \\(t = 10\\).\n\n### Strategy:\n- To avoid collision at \\(t = 10\\) on freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must be at \\(y \\leq 4\\) or \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 10\\). Since \\(y = 9\\) is not reachable by \\(t = 10\\), the player stays at \\(y = 4\\) until \\(t = 10\\).\n- After \\(t = 10\\), the player moves upward each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by \\(t = 15\\), avoiding the danger times for \\(y = 4\\) (turns 12-14) by being on higher rows.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence starts at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) with the player at \\(y = 4\\). Actions are chosen to:\n- Stay at \\(y = 4\\) for turns 6 to 9 (actions: S, S, S, S), ensuring \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 10\\) (safe, as collision on \\(y = 4\\) starts at \\(t = 12\\)).\n- Move upward each turn from \\(t = 10\\) to \\(t = 14\\) (actions: U, U, U, U, U), reaching \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 15\\).\n\nThe actions for turns \\(t = 6\\) to \\(t = 14\\) (9 turns) are:\n\n- Turn 6: S (stay at \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 7: S (stay at \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 8: S (stay at \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 9: S (stay at \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 10: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 11\\))\n- Turn 11: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 12\\))\n- Turn 12: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 13\\))\n- Turn 13: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 14\\))\n- Turn 14: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 15\\))\n\n### Verification:\n- **At \\(t = 10\\)**: Player is at \\(y = 4\\), which is safe (collision on \\(y = 4\\) starts at \\(t = 12\\)).\n- **Turns 11 to 14**: Player is on \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\), but these are safe as collision only occurs at \\(t = 10\\) for these rows.\n- **At \\(t = 12, 13, 14\\)**: Player is on \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) (not \\(y = 4\\)), avoiding collision on \\(y = 4\\).\n- **At \\(t = 15\\)**: Player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars and is safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns (\\(H = 9\\)) without any collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁=7.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its position at turn t₁=7, and I need to compute where it is at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision happens only if the player is on a freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. When you move to a new y, you're not on that freeway until the next turn, so you only check the freeway you're currently on for collisions.\n\nThe player position at turn T determines which freeway to check. If y_T = k, then I need to check if for any car on freeway k, 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is probably the top, and since there are no cars on y=0 or y=9, I assume, because freeways are from 1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 might be safe zones.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=0 and y=9 should have no cars, so once we reach y=9, we're safe.\n\nWe start at (0,4), so on freeway 4? No, the position is (x,y), but x is always 0 for the player? Let me read.\n\n\"the initial position (0, y_{t₁})\" and \"reach (0,9)\", so I think the player is always at x=0, and we move vertically. Cars are on horizontal freeways at different y-levels.\n\nSo for the player, we only care about the y-coordinate, and for each turn, we're at some y, and we need to ensure that if y is between 1 and 8, there's no car on that freeway whose span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nNow, for the cars, I need to model their positions over time.\n\nEach car is defined by its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t₁=7.\n\nDirection: left or right. In the table, for freeway 1: (-27, -38, right, 3). Head and tail, but direction is given.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, head is less than tail? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t₁ is [h, τ], and at time T, it becomes [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] at t₁? In the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: (-27, -38, right, 3). Head is -27, tail is -38. But if direction is right, and it's moving right, the span should be [τ, h] with τ < h, I think.\n\nLet's check the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction), but in the update, for right-moving, it uses [τ, h] implying τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h, τ] with h left, τ right? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nSo in this notation, for left-moving, h is the head (left end, smaller x), τ is tail (right end, larger x), so as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nFor right-moving, \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" with τ the tail (left end), h the head (right end), so [τ, h] with τ < h, and both increase as it moves right.\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1: (-27, -38, right, 3). Head is -27, tail is -38. But -27 > -38, so if tail is -38 and head is -27, for right-moving, τ should be the left end, which is tail, I think.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ and h such that τ < h.\n\nHere, tail is -38, head is -27, and -38 < -27, so τ = tail = -38, h = head = -27.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nIn this case, all cars in the input have head and tail such that for right-moving, tail < head, since direction is right.\n\nFreeway 1: (-27, -38, right, 3), -38 < -27, so tail = -38, head = -27.\n\nFreeway 4: (-20, -31, right, 4), -31 < -20? -31 is less than -20, so tail = -31, head = -20? But it's written as (head, tail) = (-20, -31), so head is -20, tail is -31, but since direction right, and tail should be left end.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: in freeway 4, cars: (-20, -31, right, 4), (16,5, right,4), (52,41, right,4)\n\nFor first car: head=-20, tail=-31. Since direction right, and tail should be left, so τ = min, h = max, so here tail=-31, head=-20, so τ = -31, h = -20.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (16,5, right,4), head=16, tail=5? 5<16, so tail=5, head=16.\n\nBut tail=5, head=16, so τ=5, h=16.\n\nThird car: (52,41, right,4), head=52, tail=41, so τ=41, h=52.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: (36,25, right,12), head=36, tail=25, τ=25, h=36; and (-36,-47,right,12), head=-36, tail=-47, τ=-47, h=-36.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when a car has 0 in its span at a given turn T.\n\nThat is, for a car, at turn T, span is [left, right], and 0 in [left, right] means left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSince it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nNow, t₁ = 7, so for a future turn T, Δt = T - t₁.\n\nLet τ = T - t₁, so at time after τ steps from now.\n\nFor a car with direction, speed s.\n\nIf right-moving: span at T is [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ] where τ and h are at t₁.\n\nτ here is the tail position, not time; I used τ for time difference, but tail is also τ, confusing.\n\nLet me use Δt for time difference.\n\nSet t_current = t₁ = 7.\n\nFor a future turn T, let Δt = T - 7.\n\nThen for a car:\n\n- If right-moving: left_end_T = τ + s * Δt\n\nright_end_T = h + s * Δt\n\nWhere τ and h are the tail and head at t₁.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: left_end_T = h - s * Δt\n\nright_end_T = τ - s * Δt\n\nBut in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let me check the directions.\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\nFreeway 2: right\n\nFreeway 3: right\n\nFreeway 4: all right\n\nFreeway 5: all right\n\nFreeway 6: all right\n\nFreeway 7: all right\n\nFreeway 8: all right\n\nAll cars are right-moving! No left-moving cars.\n\nIs that right? Let me see the table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | (-27,-38,right,3) | direction right\n\nSimilarly all have \"right\".\n\nSo all cars are moving to the right.\n\nTherefore, for all cars, at time T, span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] with τ and h at t₁.\n\nAnd collision if player is on that freeway at turn T, and 0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], i.e., τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt.\n\nNow, since the player is at x=0 always, we care about when 0 is covered by a car on the same freeway.\n\nNow, we start at y=4 at turn 7.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 to y=9, difference is 5, so minimum moves would be 5 up actions, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 5.\n\nBut we need to minimize H, so we want to go up as fast as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nNow, since we start at y=4, and need to be at y=9, and we can only move one step per turn, the minimal H is at least 5, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might collide with cars on freeways 4,5,6,7,8 as we go up.\n\ny=4 to y=5, then to y=6, etc., up to y=9.\n\nBut at each position, we need to check for collisions at each turn.\n\nAlso, when we move, we are not on the new freeway until the next turn, so for example, when we are at y=4 at turn T, we check freeway 4 for collision at turn T.\n\nIf we move up to y=5, at turn T+1 we are at y=5 and check freeway 5, etc.\n\nBut at the turn we move, we are still on the old freeway.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars, and find for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0, meaning some car has 0 in span.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, but we just need if any car covers 0 at that turn.\n\nFor each freeway, I need the set of turn numbers T where collision occurs if player is there.\n\nT is absolute turn, starting from t₁=7.\n\nSince we care about future, Δt >=0.\n\nLet me define for each freeway k, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., some car has 0 in its span.\n\nThen, for the player path, at each turn, if y_T is between 1 and 8, it must not be unsafe at that turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nStart at turn 7, y=4.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the unsafe times.\n\nSince all cars right-moving with constant speed, for each car, the time when it covers 0 can be found by solving the inequality.\n\nFor a car with tail τ, head h, speed s, at time T, it covers 0 if τ + s (T-7) <= 0 <= h + s (T-7)\n\nSince τ <= h, because right-moving.\n\nSo this inequality: τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt, with Δt = T - 7.\n\nSo let's solve for Δt.\n\nFirst, 0 <= h + s Δt ⇒ s Δt >= -h ⇒ Δt >= -h/s\n\nSimilarly, τ + s Δt <= 0 ⇒ s Δt <= -τ ⇒ Δt <= -τ/s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nNow, also, since Δt >=0, we need max(0, ceil(-h/s)) <= Δt <= floor(-τ/s) ? Let's think carefully.\n\nThe inequality τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nThis implies that Δt must satisfy:\n\nFrom 0 <= h + s Δt: Δt >= ceil( -h / s ) ? Not necessarily integer, but turns are discrete, so Δt integer.\n\nT is integer, so Δt integer >=0.\n\nSo we need to find integer Δt such that:\n\nτ + s Δt <= 0 and 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\ns Δt <= -τ  (1)\n\nand s Δt >= -h  (2)\n\nSince s > 0, we can divide.\n\nSo Δt <= floor( (-τ) / s )  because s Δt <= -τ, and since Δt integer, Δt <= floor( -τ / s )\n\nSimilarly, s Δt >= -h, so Δt >= ceil( -h / s )\n\nThen, if ceil( -h / s ) <= floor( -τ / s ), then for Δt in that range, the car covers 0.\n\nOtherwise, no.\n\nThen for each freeway, multiple cars, so unsafe if any car covers 0 at that Δt.\n\nBut for the freeway, we care about when it is unsafe, so for each freeway, find the set of Δt where at least one car has 0 in span.\n\nThen, since we need to go from y=4 to y=9, we can think of the path as a sequence of actions.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to increase y by 5, H at least 5.\n\nIf we go up every turn, we reach in 5 turns: at turn 7: y=4, turn 8: y=5, turn 9: y=6, turn 10: y=7, turn 11: y=8, turn 12: y=9. So at turn 12, y=9, which is safe. H=5 turns? Turns from t=7 to t=11, actions at t=7,8,9,10,11, so 5 actions, H=5.\n\nBut we need to check if during this, we avoid collisions.\n\nAt each turn, when we are on y=4,5,6,7,8, we need no collision.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt turn 7: we start at y=4, so we are on freeway 4 at turn 7. Need to check if freeway 4 is unsafe at Δt=0.\n\nΔt = T - 7, so for turn 7, Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly, turn 8: Δt=1, y=5 if we move up, etc.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the unsafe Δt.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car: τ = -38, h = -27, s=3\n\nThen Δt >= ceil( -h / s ) = ceil( -(-27) / 3 ) = ceil(27/3) = ceil(9) =9\n\nΔt <= floor( -τ / s ) = floor( -(-38) / 3 ) = floor(38/3) = floor(12.666) =12\n\nSo for Δt from 9 to 12 inclusive, this car covers 0.\n\nBut freeway 1 has only one car, so unsafe at Δt=9,10,11,12.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Cars: (-27,-38,right,3) same as freeway 1.\n\nτ=-38, h=-27, s=3, so same: unsafe Δt=9,10,11,12.\n\nFreeway 3: also same: unsafe Δt=9,10,11,12.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-20,-31,right,4) so head=-20, tail=-31? Head=-20, tail=-31, so τ = tail = -31, h = head = -20, s=4\n\nThen Δt >= ceil( -h / s ) = ceil( -(-20)/4 ) = ceil(20/4) = ceil(5) =5\n\nΔt <= floor( -τ / s ) = floor( -(-31)/4 ) = floor(31/4) = floor(7.75) =7\n\nSo for this car, covers 0 when Δt=5,6,7\n\nNow second car on freeway 4: (16,5,right,4) head=16, tail=5, so τ=5, h=16, s=4\n\nΔt >= ceil( -h/s ) = ceil( -16/4 ) = ceil(-4) = -4\n\nBut Δt >=0, so ceil(-4) = -4, but since Δt >=0, the inequality Δt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-4) = -4, which is always true for Δt>=0.\n\nΔt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-16/4) = ceil(-4) = -4\n\nSince Δt >=0 > -4, so always true for Δt>=0.\n\nNow, lower bound: Δt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-4) = -4, and since Δt>=0, this is satisfied.\n\nUpper bound: Δt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-5/4) = floor(-1.25) = -2? Let's see.\n\ns Δt <= -τ\n\nτ=5, so s Δt <= -5\n\n4 Δt <= -5\n\nΔt <= -5/4 = -1.25\n\nSince Δt >=0, this is impossible. Δt <= -1.25, but Δt >=0, no overlap.\n\nSo this car never covers 0? Let's see.\n\nThe condition: s Δt <= -τ and s Δt >= -h\n\ns=4, τ=5, h=16\n\ns Δt >= -h = -16, so 4 Δt >= -16, Δt >= -4, true for Δt>=0\n\ns Δt <= -τ = -5, so 4 Δt <= -5, Δt <= -1.25, but Δt >=0, no integer Δt satisfies Δt <= -1.25 and Δt >=0. So indeed, no solution, this car never covers 0 because it is moving right from x=5 to higher, and 0 is left, so never reaches 0.\n\nSimilarly, third car on freeway 4: (52,41,right,4) head=52, tail=41, so τ=41, h=52, s=4\n\nThen Δt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-52/4) = ceil(-13) = -13, true for Δt>=0\n\nΔt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-41/4) = floor(-10.25) = -11\n\ns Δt <= -τ = -41, 4 Δt <= -41, Δt <= -10.25, so Δt <= -11 since integer? floor(-10.25) = -11? No.\n\nfloor(x) is greatest integer <= x.\n\nx = -41/4 = -10.25, floor(-10.25) = -11? No, -11 < -10.25? -11 is less than -10.25, but floor is greatest integer less than or equal.\n\n-10.25, integers less than or equal: -11, -12, ... but greatest is -11? No, -11 = -11.0 < -10.25, but -10.25 is greater than -11.\n\n-10.25, floor is -11? No, for example, floor(-1.5) = -2, since -2 < -1.5 < -1.\n\nSimilarly, floor(-10.25) = -11, because -11 <= -10.25 <= -10.\n\n-11 < -10.25 < -10, so floor is -11.\n\nBut Δt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-41/4) = floor(-10.25) = -11\n\nAnd Δt >=0, so Δt <= -11 and Δt >=0 impossible, so never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 4, only the first car can cover 0, at Δt=5,6,7.\n\nThus freeway 4 unsafe at Δt=5,6,7.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12) head=36, tail=25, so τ=25, h=36, s=12\n\nThen Δt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-36/12) = ceil(-3) = -3, true for Δt>=0\n\nΔt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-25/12) = floor(-2.083) = -3? -25/12 = -2.083, floor is -3? Since -3 < -2.083 < -2, floor is -3.\n\nThen Δt <= -3 and Δt >=0 impossible, so never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12) head=-36, tail=-47, so τ=-47, h=-36, s=12\n\nThen Δt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil( -(-36)/12 ) = ceil(36/12) = ceil(3) =3\n\nΔt <= floor( -τ / s ) = floor( -(-47)/12 ) = floor(47/12) = floor(3.916) =3\n\nSo Δt >=3 and Δt <=3, so only at Δt=3.\n\nThus freeway 5 unsafe only at Δt=3.\n\nNow freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? Cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12) same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12) same, covers at Δt=3.\n\nSo freeway 6 unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5 and 6, unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nFreeway 8: same, unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nNow freeway 1,2,3 unsafe at Δt=9,10,11,12, but since we are going to y=9, and we might not be on low freeways, but let's list all unsafe times per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe Δt=9,10,11,12\n\nFreeway 2: same, Δt=9,10,11,12\n\nFreeway 3: same, Δt=9,10,11,12\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe Δt=5,6,7\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe Δt=3\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe Δt=3\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe Δt=3\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe Δt=3\n\nNow, we start at turn 7, which is Δt=0, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nMinimal path: go up every turn.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 7 (Δt=0): at y=4, action? We are at y=4, but action a_t determines next y.\n\nAt turn t, player position y_t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nBut collision is checked at turn t based on y_t.\n\nFor turn t, y_t is the position, and we check if on freeway k=y_t, and if unsafe at that turn.\n\nTurn t corresponds to Δt = t - 7.\n\nSo for turn t, Δt = t - 7.\n\nStart: turn 7, Δt=0, y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 at Δt=0: is it unsafe? Freeway 4 unsafe at Δt=5,6,7, so at Δt=0, is it safe? Yes, since unsafe only at 5,6,7.\n\nΔt=0 not in {5,6,7}, so safe.\n\nNow, we take action, say U, to go up.\n\nAction at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn 7, we take action a_7.\n\nIf a_7 = U, then y_8 = y_7 +1 =5\n\nIf S, y_8=4, etc.\n\nBut we want to go up.\n\nSuppose we go up at each turn.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7 (Δt=0): y=4, on freeway 4. Safe, since not unsafe at Δt=0.\n\nAction a_7 = U\n\nThen turn 8 (Δt=1): y=5, on freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nΔt=1, not 3, so safe.\n\nAction a_8 = U\n\nTurn 9 (Δt=2): y=6, on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nΔt=2 not 3, safe.\n\nAction a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10 (Δt=3): y=7, on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nΔt=3, and freeway 7 unsafe at Δt=3, so collision! Not safe.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nAt turn 10, Δt=3, y=7, freeway 7 is unsafe at Δt=3, so collision if we are there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway 7 at turn 10.\n\nBut in the path above, at turn 10, y=7, which is freeway 7, and unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nThus, we need to avoid that.\n\nWe could stay or go down at some point to avoid being on unsafe freeway at that time.\n\nSince we need to go to y=9, and minimal H.\n\nCurrent plan: if we go straight up, we have collision at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10 is when Δt=3.\n\nWe can delay or something.\n\nSince freeway 7 is unsafe only at Δt=3, we can avoid being on freeway 7 at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at Δt=5,6,7\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at Δt=3\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at Δt=3\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at Δt=3\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at Δt=3\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 unsafe later, but we are going up, so might not reach them, or if we go down, but we need to go to y=9, so probably not going down to low y.\n\ny=0 and 9 safe.\n\nNow, at turn 7 (Δt=0): y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nWe need to go up.\n\nBut if we go to y=5 at turn 8 (Δt=1), freeway 5, safe at Δt=1.\n\nThen to y=6 at turn 9 (Δt=2), freeway 6, safe at Δt=2.\n\nThen at turn 10 (Δt=3), if we go to y=7, freeway 7, unsafe.\n\nWe could stay at y=6 for turn 10.\n\nAction at turn 9: instead of U, we do S or D.\n\nBut we need to minimize H, so staying might increase time.\n\nH is the number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nCurrently at y=4, need to reach y=9.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 for one turn, then later go up.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 7 (Δt=0): y=4, safe. Action U → y=5 at turn 8\n\nTurn 8 (Δt=1): y=5, freeway 5, unsafe only at Δt=3, so safe at Δt=1. Action U → y=6 at turn 9\n\nTurn 9 (Δt=2): y=6, freeway 6, unsafe at Δt=3, not at 2, so safe. Now, if we do U, we go to y=7 at turn 10, but at turn 10, Δt=3, y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo instead, at turn 9, we do S: stay at y=6.\n\nThen turn 10 (Δt=3): y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at Δt=3? Yes, freeway 6 unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nAt Δt=3, freeway 6 is unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=6 at turn 10 (Δt=3), we are on freeway 6, and unsafe, collision.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nFreeway 6 is also unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5,6,7,8 all unsafe at Δt=3 except freeway 5 is only at Δt=3, etc.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nSo if we stay at y=6 at turn 10 (Δt=3), we have collision on freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=5 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 9 (Δt=2), y=6, safe.\n\nAction: if we do D, then y_{10} = y_9 -1 =5? y_9=6, action D, y_{10}=5.\n\nThen turn 10 (Δt=3): y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at Δt=3, so also collision.\n\nIf we do S at turn 9, y_{10}=6, collision on freeway 6.\n\nSo at turn 10 (Δt=3), freeways 5,6,7,8 are all unsafe? Freeway 5 unsafe at Δt=3, freeway 6 at Δt=3, freeway 7 at Δt=3, freeway 8 at Δt=3.\n\nAnd freeway 4 unsafe only at 5,6,7.\n\nBut at Δt=3, freeway 4 is safe.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at turn 9, which is Δt=2, safe.\n\nWe need to be at a safe freeway at turn 10, Δt=3.\n\nWhat freeways are safe at Δt=3?\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at 9-12, safe at Δt=3\n\nFreeway 2: same, safe\n\nFreeway 3: same, safe\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at 5,6,7, so at Δt=3, safe\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at 3, not safe\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at 3\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at 3\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at 3\n\nSo at Δt=3, safe freeways are y=1,2,3,4.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe, but we are at y=6, not easy to go to y=0 or y=9 immediately.\n\nAt turn 9 (Δt=2), we are at y=6.\n\nWe need to move to a safe y for turn 10.\n\nIf we go down to y=5, but y=5 is freeway 5, unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nIf stay y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf go down to y=4, but from y=6 to y=4 in one step? Actions: U, D, S, each changes by 1 or 0.\n\nFrom y=6, we can go to y=5 (D), y=7 (U), or y=6 (S).\n\ny=5,6,7 all unsafe at Δt=3.\n\ny=4 is safe at Δt=3, but we can't reach from y=6 in one step; we can only go to y=5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 or below, but too far.\n\nSo at turn 10, Δt=3, we cannot be on y=5,6,7,8 because all unsafe.\n\ny=8: freeway 8 unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nAnd y=4 is safe, but from y=6, we can only be at y=5,6,7 at turn 10.\n\nAll of which are unsafe.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to be safe at turn 10 if we are at y=6 at turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, we must be at some y.\n\nPerhaps we need to avoid being on high freeways earlier.\n\nStart over.\n\nAt turn 7 (Δt=0): y=4, freeway 4 safe (unsafe at 5,6,7, not 0).\n\nWe can choose to go up or not.\n\nIf we go up to y=5 at turn 8, or stay at y=4, or go down, but going down might not help since we need to go up.\n\nSince at Δt=3, freeways 5-8 are unsafe, we need to be below y=5 or at y=9 at that time.\n\ny=9 is safe, but we start from y=4, at Δt=0.\n\nΔt=3 is turn 10.\n\nWe need to plan the path so that at turn 10 (Δt=3), we are not on freeway 5,6,7,8.\n\nSo we must be on y<=4 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 might be too far.\n\nFrom turn 7 to turn 10, that's 3 turns: turn 7,8,9 actions, then at turn 10 position.\n\nAt turn 7, y=4.\n\nAfter 3 actions, y can be from 4-3=1 to 4+3=7, but since we want to go up, probably not down.\n\nBut at turn 10, we need y<=4 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is impossible in 3 turns from y=4, since max increase to 7.\n\nSo at turn 10, y<=4 or y=9, but y=9 not possible, so must have y<=4.\n\nBut we start at y=4 at turn 7, after actions, at turn 10, if we go down, y could be less, but we need to reach y=9 later, so going down might cost more turns.\n\nWe can stay or go down to be at y<=4 at turn 10.\n\nThen after that, go up.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, from turn 7 to turn 10.\n\nTurn 7: start y=4.\n\nWe need y_10 <=4.\n\nSince y_{10} = y_7 + sum of Δy from t=7 to 9.\n\nActions at t=7,8,9 affect y_8,y_9,y_10.\n\ny_t for turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo for turn 10, y_10 is position.\n\ny_10 depends on actions from turn 7 to 9.\n\nSimilarly, y_7 is given.\n\nWe need y_10 <=4.\n\nSince y_7=4, to have y_10<=4, we need not to go up too much, or go down.\n\nSpecifically, the net change from turn 7 to 10: after 3 actions, y_10 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nEach Δy is -1,0, or +1.\n\nSo y_10 = 4 + a + b + c, where a,b,c in {-1,0,1}\n\nSo y_10 between 1 and 7.\n\nWe need y_10 <=4.\n\nSo 4 + a+b+c <=4, so a+b+c <=0.\n\nThen after turn 10, we can go up to y=9.\n\nBut at turn 10, we also need to be safe, which since y<=4, and at Δt=3, freeways 1,2,3,4 are safe, as we saw.\n\ny<=4 means freeway 1,2,3,4 or y=0.\n\nAll safe at Δt=3.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, minimal H.\n\nFirst, we need to reach y=9 from y_10.\n\ny_10 <=4, say y_10 = k <=4.\n\nThen from k to 9, need at least 9-k moves up.\n\nPlus the turns to get to turn 10.\n\nFrom turn 7 to turn 10, that's 3 turns: turns 7,8,9 with actions, then turn 10 we are at position.\n\nThe sequence of actions: we take actions at turns t=7,8,9,... until we reach y=9.\n\nThe turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach.\n\nNow, at turn 10, we are at y_10 <=4.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9, which takes at least 9 - y_10 turns.\n\nSince each up move increases by 1.\n\nWe can do multiple up, but no down needed if no obstacles, but there might be later obstacles.\n\nFor example, freeway 4 unsafe at Δt=5,6,7.\n\nΔt relative to t₁=7.\n\nSo Δt=5 is turn 12, Δt=6 turn 13, etc.\n\nBut let's first handle the immediate issue.\n\nSo, to avoid collision at turn 10, we need y_10 <=4.\n\nNow, y_10 = 4 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9\n\nSet d = Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9, then y_10 = 4 + d, and we need d <=0.\n\nd = sum of three changes, each -1,0,1.\n\nNow, we need to choose actions such that during these turns, we are safe.\n\nTurn 7 (Δt=0): y=4, freeway 4 safe.\n\nAction a_7: if U, y_8=5; if S, y_8=4; if D, y_8=3.\n\nTurn 8 (Δt=1): y=y_8, on freeway y_8.\n\nNow, at Δt=1, which freeways unsafe?\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at 5,6,7, not 1, so safe.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe only at 3, not 1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 unsafe only at 3, so at Δt=1, all freeways safe except possibly others, but freeway 1,2,3 unsafe later, so at Δt=1, all freeways are safe, since unsafe times are at 3,5,6,7,9-12.\n\nAt Δt=1, no freeway is unsafe, because:\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at 5,6,7\n\nFreeway 5 at 3\n\nFreeway 6 at 3\n\netc., all not 1.\n\nFreeway 1 at 9-12, not 1.\n\nSo at Δt=1, all positions are safe.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=2: turn 9, Δt=2.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at 5,6,7 not 2\n\nFreeway 5 at 3 not 2\n\nFreeway 6 at 3 not 2\n\nFreeway 7 at 3 not 2\n\nFreeway 8 at 3 not 2\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 at 9-12 not 2\n\nSo at Δt=2, all freeways safe.\n\nOnly at Δt=3, freeways 5-8 unsafe.\n\nAnd at other times, safe except specific.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nTo have y_10 <=4, we need to not go up too much in the first three actions.\n\nSpecifically, y_10 = 4 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 <=4, so Δy_7 + Δy_8 + Δy_9 <=0.\n\nSince each <=1, possible with some S or D.\n\nBut we want to minimize time, so we should do as many U as possible, but constrained.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, so if we go down, it takes more turns.\n\nMinimal d<=0, so d=0 or -1 or -2 or -3.\n\nBut d=0: y_10=4, then need 5 ups to reach y=9.\n\nd=-1: y_10=3, need 6 ups, etc., worse.\n\nSo best is d=0, y_10=4.\n\nThen from there, go up 5 times.\n\nNow, with d=0, meaning sum of Δy_7, Δy_8, Δy_9 =0.\n\nPossible sequences: all S: S,S,S then y_10=4\n\nOr U,D,S or U,S,D etc., but net zero.\n\nBut we need to be safe during the path.\n\nAt turn 7: y=4, safe.\n\nAction: to have net zero, we can do S at some points.\n\nBut let's list possible actions.\n\nFirst, at turn 7: we can do U, S, or D.\n\nIf we do U, y_8=5.\n\nThen at turn 8 (Δt=1): y=5, safe as above.\n\nThen action at turn 8: if we do D, y_9=4.\n\nThen at turn 9 (Δt=2): y=4, safe.\n\nThen action at turn 9: if S, y_10=4; or U, y_10=5 but we need y_10<=4, so must do S or D to have y_10=4 or less.\n\nIf at turn 9, S, y_10=4.\n\nIf D, y_10=3.\n\nBut we want y_10=4 if possible.\n\nIn this case: a_7=U, a_8=D, then y_8=5, y_9=4 (after a_8=D), then at turn 9, y=4, action a_9: if S, y_10=4; if D, y_10=3.\n\nSimilarly, other sequences.\n\nWe could do S at turn 7, then U and D, etc.\n\nBut let's choose one.\n\nTo have y_10=4, one way: a_7=S, a_8=S, a_9=S: then y_7=4, y_8=4, y_9=4, y_10=4.\n\nAll safe since at Δt=0,1,2, freeway 4 safe.\n\nAt Δt=0: turn7, safe; Δt=1: turn8, y=4? If a_7=S, y_8=4, so at turn8, y=4, Δt=1, freeway4 safe.\n\nSimilarly turn9, y=4, Δt=2, safe.\n\nThen turn10, y=4, Δt=3, freeway4 safe.\n\nThen from there, we go up to y=9.\n\nNow, from y=4 at turn10, we need to reach y=9.\n\nGo up each turn.\n\nTurn10 (Δt=3): y=4, safe. Action U → y=5 at turn11.\n\nTurn11 (Δt=4): y=5, freeway5.\n\nNow, freeway5 unsafe at Δt=3 only, so at Δt=4, safe? Yes, since only unsafe at 3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 unsafe at3, not4, safe.\n\nAt Δt=4, which is turn11.\n\nTurn11: Δt=11-7=4.\n\nFreeway5: unsafe only at Δt=3, so at Δt=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut freeway4 unsafe at Δt=5,6,7.\n\nAt turn11, Δt=4, freeway5, safe.\n\nAction U → y=6 at turn12.\n\nTurn12 (Δt=5): y=6, freeway6.\n\nFreeway6 unsafe only at Δt=3, so at Δt=5, safe.\n\nAction U → y=7 at turn13.\n\nTurn13 (Δt=6): y=7, freeway7.\n\nFreeway7 unsafe only at Δt=3, so at Δt=6, safe.\n\nAction U → y=8 at turn14.\n\nTurn14 (Δt=7): y=8, freeway8.\n\nFreeway8 unsafe only at Δt=3, so at Δt=7, safe.\n\nAction U → y=9 at turn15.\n\nTurn15 (Δt=8): y=9, reached, safe.\n\nNow, we reached at turn15.\n\nH= number of actions: from turn7 to turn14, actions at t=7 to14, that's 8 actions? Let's list the turns.\n\nStart turn7: position y=4.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nAction at t=7: S (stay), so y_8=4\n\nt=8: S, y_9=4\n\nt=9: S, y_10=4\n\nt=10: U, y_11=5\n\nt=11: U, y_12=6\n\nt=12: U, y_13=7\n\nt=13: U, y_14=8\n\nt=14: U, y_15=9\n\nAt turn15, y=9, reached.\n\nActions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14: 8 actions.\n\nBut earlier we could have done better.\n\nIn the beginning, instead of all S, we could have moved but net zero.\n\nFor example, at turn7: U, to y_8=5\n\nTurn8: D, to y_9=4\n\nThen turn9: S, to y_10=4\n\nSame y_10=4.\n\nThen from turn10: U to y11=5, etc., same as above.\n\nStill 8 actions to reach turn15.\n\nBut at turn10 we go to y=5 at turn11.\n\nTurn11: Δt=4, y=5, safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at turn12, Δt=5.\n\nNow, freeway6 safe at Δt=5.\n\nBut at turn12, Δt=5, y=6.\n\nNow, next, U to y=7 at turn13, Δt=6.\n\nFreeway7 safe at Δt=6? Freeway7 unsafe only at Δt=3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=8 at turn14, Δt=7.\n\nFreeway8 safe.\n\nU to y=9 at turn15.\n\nSame.\n\nBut we have freeway4 unsafe at Δt=5,6,7.\n\nIn this path, when are we on freeway4? Only at the beginning, up to turn10, y=4, but at turn10, Δt=3, freeway4 safe, since unsafe at 5,6,7.\n\nΔt=3 not in 5,6,7.\n\nThen at turn11, y=5, not freeway4.\n\nFreeway4 is for y=4.\n\nIn the going up phase, we are not on y=4 except at turn10.\n\nAt turn12, Δt=5, we are at y=6, freeway6, not 4.\n\nFreeway4 is only when y=4, which we left at turn10.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut can we reach faster?\n\nIn this path, we wasted three turns staying at y=4 to avoid the problem at turn10.\n\nBut perhaps we can go up earlier.\n\nFor example, suppose at turn7, we go up to y=5.\n\nBut then at turn10, we need y_10<=4, so we must come down.\n\nFor instance:\n\nTurn7 (Δt=0): y=4, safe. Action U → y_8=5\n\nTurn8 (Δt=1): y=5, safe (Δt=1 not 3). Action D → y_9=4\n\nTurn9 (Δt=2): y=4, safe. Action S → y_10=4\n\nThen same as before.\n\ny_10=4.\n\nThen turn10: U to y11=5\n\netc., same path.\n\nAfter turn9, y=4, but we can go up at turn9.\n\nAt turn9 (Δt=2), y=4, we can do U to go to y_10=5.\n\nBut at turn10, Δt=3, y=5, freeway5 unsafe! Collision.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nIf we do U at turn9, y_10=5, but at turn10, unsafe.\n\nSo we must have y_10<=4.\n\nThus, we need to be at y<=4 at turn10.\n\nNow, to save time, we could be at a lower y but then go up faster, but since we need to reach y=9, being lower takes more steps.\n\nFor example, if y_10=3, then need 6 ups, worse.\n\nSo best y_10=4.\n\nThen from there, 5 ups to y=9.\n\nNow, the actions to get to y_10=4 with net zero change.\n\nIn the above, we used three actions: e.g., S,S,S or U,D,S etc.\n\nBut we can do it in a way that we are ready to go up.\n\nAnother idea: since at Δt=3, only that time is bad for freeways 5-8, we can pass through them before or after.\n\nBut freeways 5-8 are only unsafe at Δt=3, safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 unsafe at Δt=5,6,7.\n\nNow, we start at y=4 at turn7.\n\nWe can go up to y=5 before Δt=3.\n\nFor example, at turn7: U to y=5 at turn8 (Δt=1)\n\nTurn8: U to y=6 at turn9 (Δt=2)\n\nNow turn9 (Δt=2): y=6, safe, as before.\n\nNow, at turn9, we need to avoid being on unsafe freeway at turn10.\n\nBut at turn10, Δt=3, freeways 5-8 unsafe.\n\nSo from y=6 at turn9, if we go U to y=7, then at turn10 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf S, y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf D, y=5 unsafe.\n\nAll unsafe.\n\nWe can only go to y=4, but from y=6, we can only reach y=5 in one step.\n\nNot to y=4.\n\nSo impossible from y=6 to be safe at turn10.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at y=5,6,7,8 at turn9, because from there, we go to y=5,6,7,8 or 4,5,6,7,8, but y=4 is safe, but from y=6, we can go to y=5 (D), which is unsafe at turn10, or to y=6 or 7, unsafe.\n\nNo way to reach y=4 from y=6 in one action.\n\nThus, at turn9, we must be at y<=4 to be able to be at y<=4 at turn10.\n\nFor example, if at turn9, y=4, then we can S to y=4 at turn10.\n\nOr if y=3, we can U to y=4 or S to y=3, etc.\n\nBut at turn9, Δt=2, all safe, so we can be at any y.\n\nNow, to have y_10<=4, and from turn7.\n\nAt turn7: y=4.\n\nAfter two actions (turn7 and8), we have y_9.\n\nThen at turn9, action determines y_10.\n\ny_9 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 = 4 + a + b\n\nThen y_10 = y_9 + c = 4 + a + b + c\n\nNeed y_10 <=4, so a+b+c <=0.\n\nBut we can choose.\n\nTo save time, we want to be as high as possible at turn9, but still able to have y_10<=4.\n\nFor example, if y_9=4, then we can S to y_10=4.\n\nOr if y_9=5, then we must D to y_10=4, but y_10=4 is ok, but we were at y=5 at turn9, which is fine.\n\nThen from y_10=4, go up.\n\nBut y_10=4, same as before.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nOption 1: stay low.\n\nTurn7: S, y=4 → y8=4\n\nTurn8: S, y=4 → y9=4\n\nTurn9: S, y=4 → y10=4\n\nThen turn10: U → y11=5\n\netc. to turn14 U to y15=9.\n\n8 actions.\n\nOption 2: move up and down.\n\nTurn7: U → y8=5\n\nTurn8: D → y9=4  (since y8=5, action D, y9=4)\n\nThen turn9: S or U? But to y10.\n\nIf turn9: S → y10=4\n\nThen same as before.\n\nAt turn9, y=4, we can U to y10=5, but then at turn10, Δt=3, y=5, unsafe! No.\n\nSo we must do S or D to have y10=4 or less.\n\nSo turn9: S → y10=4\n\nThen same path.\n\nTurn7: U → y8=5\n\nTurn8: S → y9=5\n\nThen at turn9, y=5, we need to go to y10<=4, so must do D → y10=4\n\nThen turn10: y=4, safe.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut now, at turn10, y=4, then U to y11=5, etc.\n\nSame number of actions: actions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 to reach y15=9.\n\nStill 8.\n\nBut in this case, from turn7 to turn10, we used U,S,D or U,D,S, net same.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 faster, we need to be higher earlier.\n\nBut at turn10, we must be at y<=4.\n\nThen from y=4, it takes 5 more turns to y=9.\n\nMinimum turns from start: we start at turn7, end at turn15, 8 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think, from t=7 to t=7+H-1, at t=7+H-1, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn7 we start, after H actions, at turn t=7+H, y=9? Let's see.\n\nDefine: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at turn t=7, y_7=4.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=7+H, we have y_{7+H} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t=7 to t=7+H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=5, actions at t=7,8,9,10,11, then at t=12, y=9.\n\nBut in our case, with obstacles, not possible.\n\nIn the clear path, it would be t=7: U, y8=5; t=8: U, y9=6; t=9: U, y10=7; t=10: U, y11=8; t=11: U, y12=9. So at t=12, y=9, H=5 actions.\n\nBut we have collision at t=10.\n\nIn our adjusted path, we have y10=4, then t=10: U, y11=5; t=11: U, y12=6; t=12: U, y13=7; t=13: U, y14=8; t=14: U, y15=9. So at t=15, y=9, actions from t=7 to t=14, H=8 actions.\n\nBut we have freeway 4 unsafe at Δt=5,6,7, which is turn12,13,14.\n\nIn the going up phase, at turn12: Δt=5, y=6? In this path, at turn12, y=6 or what.\n\nIn the sequence after y10=4:\n\nt=10: U → y11=5\n\nt=11: U → y12=6\n\nt=12: U → y13=7\n\nt=13: U → y14=8\n\nt=14: U → y15=9\n\nAt turn12: Δt=12-7=5, y=6, freeway6.\n\nFreeway6 unsafe only at Δt=3, so at Δt=5, safe.\n\nAt turn13: Δt=6, y=7, freeway7, unsafe only at 3, safe.\n\nSimilarly turn14: Δt=7, y=8, freeway8, safe.\n\nNo problem with freeway4, since we are not on it.\n\nFreeway4 is y=4, which we were on earlier.\n\nBut at turn12, Δt=5, if we were on y=4, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=4 at turn10, Δt=3, which is safe for freeway4.\n\nThen we leave, so no issue.\n\nBut can we reduce H?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=5 or higher at turn10, but we can't because unsafe.\n\nUnless we are at y=9 at turn10, but impossible.\n\ny=9 at turn10: from y=4, need +5 in 3 turns, impossible.\n\nSo must be y<=4 at turn10.\n\nThen min H is 8.\n\nBut let's see if we can go up faster after turn10.\n\nIn the path, from y10=4 to y15=9, 5 ups.\n\nBut at turn11, y=5, Δt=4, safe.\n\nTurn12, y=6, Δt=5, safe.\n\nBut freeway4 is unsafe at Δt=5,6,7, but we are not on freeway4.\n\nAnother thing: freeway4 unsafe at Δt=5,6,7, but only if we are on it.\n\nIn the path, we are on freeway4 only at turns when y=4, which is up to turn10.\n\nAt turn10, Δt=3, not 5,6,7, safe.\n\nAfter that, we are on higher freeways.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut is there a way to have fewer than 8 actions?\n\nSuppose we go down at some point to be safe, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at turn7, we do D to y8=3.\n\nThen at turn8, y=3, freeway3, safe at Δt=1.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut at turn10, we need to be at y<=4, which we can, but we are lower, so takes more steps to reach y=9.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn7: D → y8=3\n\nTurn8: U → y9=4\n\nTurn9: S → y10=4\n\nThen turn10: U → y11=5\n\netc. to turn14: U to y15=9, same as before, 8 actions, but we were at y=3, which is fine, but same H.\n\nOr from turn8 y=3, we can go up faster, but at turn10, we need to be low.\n\nTurn7: D → y8=3\n\nTurn8: U → y9=4\n\nTurn9: U → but if U, y10=5, then at turn10 unsafe.\n\nSo must not go up at turn9.\n\nTurn9: S → y10=4\n\nSame.\n\nSo seems 8 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times again.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 unsafe only at Δt=3.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at Δt=5,6,7.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 unsafe at Δt=9,10,11,12.\n\nWe don't care about them since we go up.\n\nAt Δt=3, turn10.\n\nWe must not be on freeway 5,6,7,8 at that turn.\n\nThe only way is to be on y=0,1,2,3,4, or9.\n\ny=9 not possible, so y<=4.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nNow, after that, we go up, and freeway 4 unsafe at Δt=5,6,7, turn12,13,14.\n\nIn the path, at turn12, Δt=5, we are at y=6 if we started from y10=4 and went up.\n\ny=6, freeway6, not 4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut at turn12, if we were on y=4, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nSo the path is ok.\n\nBut can we be at y=9 earlier by going faster?\n\nSuppose we do not stay, but go up and down to be at y=4 at turn10, but with same net.\n\nFor example, turn7: U → y8=5\n\nTurn8: U → y9=6\n\nBut at turn9, y=6, we need to go to y10<=4, but we can only go to y=5,6,7, all unsafe at turn10.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTurn7: S → y8=4\n\nTurn8: U → y9=5\n\nThen at turn9, y=5, we can do D → y10=4\n\nThen y10=4.\n\nSame as before.\n\nThen go up.\n\nStill, from turn7 to turn14 actions, H=8.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before turn15.\n\nFor example, if at some point we can skip.\n\nBut no, each step changes y by at most 1.\n\nAnother idea: after turn10, we go up, but freeway4 unsafe at turn12,13,14, but we are not on it, so ok.\n\nBut at turn14, we go to y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, is there a freeway at y=9? No, cars only on 1-8, so y=9 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=0 safe.\n\nBut in the answer, we need the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the waiting by going down and up, but that might not save time.\n\nFor example, suppose at turn7: U to y8=5\n\nTurn8: D to y9=4\n\nThen turn9: U to y10=5, but at turn10 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTurn7: D to y8=3\n\nTurn8: U to y9=4\n\nTurn9: U to y10=5, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo must have y10<=4.\n\nThus minimal H is 8.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nWe need to output the actions from turn t=7 onwards until we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, we can choose to do U,D,etc.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should go up as much as possible except when constrained.\n\nIn this case, to have y10=4, we can do, for example, actions: S,S,S for t=7,8,9, then U,U,U,U,U for t=10 to14.\n\nBut t=10 to14 is 5 actions.\n\nActions: t=7: S, t=8: S, t=9: S, t=10: U, t=11: U, t=12: U, t=13: U, t=14: U, then at t=15, y=9.\n\nH=8 actions.\n\nWith U and D: t=7: U, t=8: D, t=9: S, t=10: U, etc., same H.\n\nNow, but at turn12,13,14, we have freeway4 unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn12: y=6, not 4.\n\nBut let's check if at any point we are unsafe.\n\nTurn7 (Δt=0): y=4, freeway4, unsafe at 5,6,7? Δt=0 not in, safe. Action S\n\nTurn8 (Δt=1): y=4, freeway4, unsafe at 5,6,7 not 1, safe. Action S\n\nTurn9 (Δt=2): y=4, freeway4, safe. Action S\n\nTurn10 (Δt=3): y=4, freeway4, unsafe at 5,6,7 not 3, safe. Action U → y11=5\n\nTurn11 (Δt=4): y=5, freeway5, unsafe only at Δt=3 not 4, safe. Action U → y12=6\n\nTurn12 (Δt=5): y=6, freeway6, unsafe only at Δt=3 not 5, safe. Action U → y13=7\n\nTurn13 (Δt=6): y=7, freeway7, unsafe only at Δt=3 not 6, safe. Action U → y14=8\n\nTurn14 (Δt=7): y=8, freeway8, unsafe only at Δt=3 not 7, safe. Action U → y15=9\n\nTurn15 (Δt=8): y=9, safe, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=8 turns: actions from t=7 to t=14.\n\nBut we can have a different sequence where we move but end up same.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=7: U → y8=5\n\nt=8: D → y9=4\n\nt=9: S → y10=4\n\nThen t=10: U → y11=5\n\netc., same as before.\n\nIn this case, at turn8 (Δt=1): y=5, safe.\n\nTurn9 (Δt=2): y=4, safe.\n\nThen same.\n\nBut H same.\n\nPerhaps we can go to higher y after turn10, but no.\n\nAnother point: freeway 4 unsafe at turn12,13,14 (Δt=5,6,7), but in the path, we are on y=6,7,8 at those times, not y=4.\n\nBut suppose we want to save a turn, how?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 at turn14.\n\nBut from y=4 at turn10, to y=9 at turn14, that's 5 steps: turn10 to14 actions, y11=5, y12=6, y13=7, y14=8, y15=9, so at turn15 y=9.\n\nIf we could be at y=5 at turn10, but we can't because unsafe.\n\nUnless we are at y=9 at turn10, impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can pass through freeways 5-8 before Δt=3.\n\nFor example, at turn7 (Δt=0): U to y8=5\n\nTurn8 (Δt=1): U to y9=6\n\nNow at turn9 (Δt=2), y=6, safe.\n\nBut then at turn9, we need to go to turn10.\n\nIf we go U to y10=7, unsafe at turn10.\n\nS or D, unsafe.\n\nBut we can go to y=4? No, from y=6, can only go to y=5,6,7.\n\nAll unsafe at turn10.\n\nSo stuck.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be below at turn10.\n\nThus minimal H=8.\n\nBut in the beginning, we have freeway 1,2,3 unsafe later, but we don't go there.\n\nNow, for the action sequence, I need to output.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions starting from turn t1=7.\n\nI can choose, for example, all stay until turn10, then up.\n\nBut to make it simple.\n\nSince the problem asks for minimal H, and sequence.\n\nBut H=8.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach in H=7.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at turn14, which is t=7+7=14, so at turn14 y=9.\n\nThen actions from t=7 to t=13.\n\ny13=9.\n\nBut y7=4, so need net +5 in 7 actions? From turn7 to turn13, that's 6 actions: t=7 to12, y13.\n\ny13 = y7 + sum_{t=7 to12} Δy_t\n\nNeed y13=9, so sum of 6 changes = +5.\n\nPossible, e.g., five U and one S, or four U and one D and one S, etc., but net +5.\n\nBut we have the constraint at turn10.\n\nAt turn10, we must be at y<=4 to be safe.\n\ny10 = y7 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\ny7=4.\n\ny10 <=4.\n\nThen y13 = y10 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12\n\ny10 <=4, need y13=9, so Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12 >=5.\n\nBut each at most +1, so must be all U, and y10 <=4, so y13 <=4 +3 =7 <9, impossible.\n\ny10 <=4, y13 = y10 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12 <=4 +1+1+1=7<9, cannot reach 9.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach by turn13.\n\nSimilarly, to reach at turn14, y14=9.\n\ny14 = y10 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12 + Δy13\n\ny10 <=4, so need Δy10 to Δy13 all U, y14 <=4+4=8<9, still less.\n\ny14 = y10 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12 + Δy13\n\nIf y10 <=4, and each Δy <=1, y14 <=4+4=8<9.\n\nTo have y14=9, must have y10 >=5, but y10 <=4 required, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we must have y10 <=4 to avoid collision, but to reach y=9 by turn14, y10 must be at least 5, impossible.\n\ny10 <=4, y14 <=4 + number of actions from t=10 to13.\n\nActions at t=10,11,12,13: four actions, each can increase by 1, so y14 <=4 +4=8<9.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 by turn14.\n\nEarliest possible: turn15, y15=9, with y10=4, then y15=4 +5=9 with five U actions.\n\nIf y10=3, then need more, but worse.\n\nSo minimal is turn15, with H=8 actions.\n\nThus, the sequence must include staying or moving to have y10=4.\n\nFor the sequence, I can output, for example:\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nThen at turn 15, y=9.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut the answer should be the actions.\n\nSince we need to minimize H, and this is minimal.\n\nPerhaps with U and D, but same H.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 9: S, but we can do other, but not necessary.\n\nNow, for the output format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 14 action, position at turn 15.\n\nH=8.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions or if I missed something.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars, but in this path, we only on freeway 4 at turns 7,8,9,10 with Δt=0,1,2,3, all not 5,6,7, so safe.\n\nFreeway 5 at turn11, Δt=4, safe, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nTo make it more efficient, but cannot reduce H.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 faster by taking a different path, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0 and up, but that takes more turns.\n\nNo.\n\nSo, the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 8. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on an unsafe freeway at critical times, particularly at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\) (turn 10) when freeways 5 to 8 are unsafe, and considering other unsafe intervals.\n\n- Freeway 4 is unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 5, 6, 7\\) (turns 12, 13, 14) due to car spans covering \\(x=0\\).\n- Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8 are unsafe only at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\) (turn 10).\n- Other freeways are unsafe at later times, but the player moves upward and avoids these.\n\nThe strategy involves:\n- Staying at \\(y=4\\) for turns 7, 8, and 9 to avoid being on freeways 5-8 at turn 10 (\\(\\Delta t = 3\\)).\n- Moving upward from turn 10 to turn 14 to reach \\(y=9\\) by turn 15.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n- Turn 7: Stay (S) – Player remains at \\(y=4\\), which is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\).\n- Turn 8: Stay (S) – Player remains at \\(y=4\\), safe at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\).\n- Turn 9: Stay (S) – Player remains at \\(y=4\\), safe at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\).\n- Turn 10: Up (U) – Player moves to \\(y=5\\), safe at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\) (freeway 5 unsafe only at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\), but action occurs at turn 10; position at turn 11 is \\(y=5\\) and checked at turn 11, \\(\\Delta t = 4\\), which is safe).\n- Turn 11: Up (U) – Player moves to \\(y=6\\), safe at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) (freeway 6 unsafe only at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\)).\n- Turn 12: Up (U) – Player moves to \\(y=7\\), safe at \\(\\Delta t = 5\\) (freeway 7 unsafe only at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\)).\n- Turn 13: Up (U) – Player moves to \\(y=8\\), safe at \\(\\Delta t = 6\\) (freeway 8 unsafe only at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\)).\n- Turn 14: Up (U) – Player moves to \\(y=9\\), reached at turn 15, which is safe (no cars on \\(y=9\\)).\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y=9\\) at turn 15 with \\(H=8\\) actions, and all positions during the path are safe.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) at turn 8 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when you move, you're not on the new row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and you arrive on y+1 at turn T+1. So you don't collide with cars on the row you're moving to at the turn you decide to move.\n\nNow, the cars are given for each freeway k (which I think corresponds to y=k) at turn t_1=8. I need to find where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=3. Since it's right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-35 + 3(T-8), -24 + 3(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nt_1=8, so for any future turn T, the time elapsed is Δt = T - 8.\n\nFor freeway 1:\n\nCar: d=right, so span at T: [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [-35 + 3Δt, -24 + 3Δt]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, I think? It says \"(-24, -35, right, 3)\" for each, but for freeway 1,2,3 it's the same, and then different for others.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3)  → but head and tail: for right-moving, head is larger, tail smaller? In the span, for right-moving, it's [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t_1, and then [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] at T.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt].\n\nBut in this case, all cars are right-moving, I think? Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3) — h=-24, τ=-35, so since right, head is at -24, tail at -35, so span [ -35, -24 ] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [ -35 + 3Δt, -24 + 3Δt ]\n\nSimilarly freeway 2: same, (-24, -35, right, 3) so same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same.\n\nNow freeway 4: has three cars: (-16, -27, right, 4), (20, 9, right, 4), (56, 45, right, 4)\n\nFor each, s=4, d=right.\n\nFirst car: h=-16, τ=-27? Head and tail: for right, head should be larger, but -16 > -27, yes, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-27, -16]\n\nAt T: [-27 + 4Δt, -16 + 4Δt]\n\nSecond car: (20, 9, right, 4) — h=20, τ=9, so [9,20] at t_1, at T: [9 + 4Δt, 20 + 4Δt]\n\nThird car: (56,45, right,4) h=56, τ=45, [45,56] at t_1, at T: [45 + 4Δt, 56 + 4Δt]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (48,37, right,12), (-24,-35, right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, s=12, d=right, so at T: [37 + 12Δt, 48 + 12Δt]\n\nSecond car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=12, d=right, at T: [-35 + 12Δt, -24 + 12Δt]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12) — yes same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nSo to summarize, the freeways are:\n\n- y=1: one car with span at T: [-35 + 3Δt, -24 + 3Δt]\n\n- y=2: same as y=1\n\n- y=3: same as y=1\n\n- y=4: three cars:\n  - Car1: [-27 + 4Δt, -16 + 4Δt]\n  - Car2: [9 + 4Δt, 20 + 4Δt]\n  - Car3: [45 + 4Δt, 56 + 4Δt]\n\n- y=5: two cars:\n  - Car1: [37 + 12Δt, 48 + 12Δt]\n  - Car2: [-35 + 12Δt, -24 + 12Δt]\n\n- y=6: same as y=5\n\n- y=7: same\n\n- y=8: same\n\nNow, the player starts at y=4 at turn 8. I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars.\n\nBut the player needs to be at (0,9), so y=9 position.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for some car on that row, 0 is within its span at T.\n\nThat is, for the row y_T, if 0 is in [low, high] for some car on that row at turn T.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, the x-position is always 0, I think, since it's (0, y_t).\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player is always at x=0, I assume, since position is (0, y_t).\n\nAnd cars are on the freeways, which are horizontal, so their spans are in the x-direction.\n\nSo for collision, at turn T, if player is on row y, and for that row, at that turn, there is a car whose span includes x=0.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=4 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a row when x=0 is covered by a car on that row at that turn.\n\nSince moving takes time, if I move up at turn T, at turn T I'm still on current row, and I arrive on new row at T+1.\n\nSimilarly for down or stay.\n\nI should consider the state over time.\n\nFirst, let's find out for each row and for each future turn relative to t_1=8, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, for each freeway y, and for each Δt, is 0 in the span of any car on that row at time t_1 + Δt.\n\nSince t_1=8, let τ = T - 8, so τ is the number of turns after turn 8.\n\nSo for τ = 0,1,2,... we can compute for each row if it is occupied at that τ.\n\nThen the player position at time τ (meaning turn 8+τ) depends on actions.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\nMin τ such that at turn 8+τ, y=9.\n\ny_τ for τ=0,1,2,... with y_0 = 4.\n\ny_τ = y_{t_1 + τ} at turn 8+τ.\n\nDefine time steps: let t = τ, starting from t=0 corresponding to turn 8.\n\nSo at time t=0: y=4\n\nAfter each action, at time t, we take action a_t, which determines Δy, and y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\ny_{t+1} is position at time t+1.\n\nThe position is updated after the action.\n\nFrom the dynamics: at turn T, we choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nIn the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t (turn t), we have position y_t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen at time t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if when we are at position y_T, and for that row y_T, at turn T, 0 is in some car span.\n\nThat is, at the beginning of turn T, we are at y_T, and during turn T, we are on row y_T, so if 0 is occupied on row y_T at turn T, we collide.\n\nAfter choosing action, we move to new position for next turn.\n\nBut during the turn, we are on the current row.\n\nFor turn T, we start at y_T, choose a_T, then move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nDuring turn T, we are on row y_T.\n\nSo collision happens if at turn T, on row y_T, 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nNow, for row y_T, at turn T, which is time t from start, with t = T - t_1 = T - 8.\n\nSince T = 8 + τ for τ = 0,1,2,...\n\nSet τ = T - 8, so for each τ >=0, turn is 8+τ.\n\nAt turn 8+τ, row y_{8+τ}, and we need to check for that row at τ.\n\nNow, let's compute for each row and each τ, whether row is occupied at (turn 8+τ).\n\nOccupied means that for some car on that row, 0 is in its span at time τ.\n\nSince the span depends on τ.\n\nFirst, for y=1: only one car, span: [-35 + 3τ, -24 + 3τ]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 3τ <= 0 <= -24 + 3τ\n\nWhich is -35 + 3τ <= 0 and 0 <= -24 + 3τ\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 3τ <= 0 => 3τ <= 35 => τ <= 35/3 ≈ 11.666, so τ <= 11 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 + 3τ => 3τ >= 24 => τ >= 8\n\nSo for τ from 8 to 11 inclusive, 0 is in span for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2: same car configuration, so same as y=1, occupied for τ=8,9,10,11.\n\nSimilarly y=3: same, τ=8,9,10,11.\n\nNow y=4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: [-27 + 4τ, -16 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span if -27 + 4τ <= 0 <= -16 + 4τ\n\nWhich is -27 + 4τ <= 0 => 4τ <= 27 => τ <= 27/4 = 6.75, so τ <= 6\n\nAnd 0 <= -16 + 4τ => 4τ >= 16 => τ >= 4\n\nSo τ from 4 to 6 inclusive.\n\nSecond car: [9 + 4τ, 20 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span if 9 + 4τ <= 0 <= 20 + 4τ\n\nBut 9 + 4τ <=0? 4τ <= -9, impossible since τ>=0, so never true. So second car never has 0 in span.\n\nThird car: [45 + 4τ, 56 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span if 45 + 4τ <= 0 <= 56 + 4τ\n\n45 + 4τ <=0? 4τ <= -45, impossible, so never.\n\nSo only first car can occupy, and only for τ=4,5,6.\n\nτ=4: -27 +16 = -11, -16+16=0? Let's compute:\n\nτ=4: low = -27 + 4*4 = -27 +16 = -11, high = -16 +16 =0, so [-11,0], 0 is included? 0 <=0 is true, and -11 <=0 true, so yes.\n\nτ=5: low = -27+20= -7, high= -16+20=4, [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nτ=6: low= -27+24= -3, high= -16+24=8, [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nτ=3: low= -27+12= -15, high= -16+12= -4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nτ=7: low= -27+28=1, high= -16+28=12, [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not in.\n\nSo y=4 occupied only at τ=4,5,6.\n\nNow y=5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span? 37 +12τ <=0 <=48 +12τ\n\n37+12τ <=0? 12τ <= -37, impossible, so never.\n\nSecond car: [-35 + 12τ, -24 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12τ <=0 <= -24 +12τ\n\nWhich is -35 +12τ <=0 => 12τ <=35 => τ <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so τ <=2\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 +12τ => 12τ >=24 => τ >=2\n\nSo τ=2 only.\n\nτ=2: low= -35 + 24 = -11, high= -24 +24=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nτ=1: low= -35+12= -23, high= -24+12= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=3: low= -35+36=1, high= -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo y=5 occupied only at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=6: same as y=5, occupied only at τ=2.\n\ny=7: same, τ=2.\n\ny=8: same, τ=2.\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=0, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some time t.\n\nMin t such that y_t =9.\n\nActions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0 per action.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, minimum moves: 5 up moves, but we can have stays or downs, but to minimize turns, we should avoid downs, and minimize stays.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions, so we might need to wait or detour.\n\nNow, let's list the occupation per row per time τ.\n\nτ: time index, τ=0,1,2,3,...\n\nRows y=1 to 8.\n\nFor each τ, which rows are occupied.\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=1: occ at τ=8,9,10,11\n\ny=2: same, τ=8,9,10,11\n\ny=3: same, τ=8,9,10,11\n\ny=4: occ at τ=4,5,6\n\ny=5: occ at τ=2\n\ny=6: occ at τ=2\n\ny=7: occ at τ=2\n\ny=8: occ at τ=2\n\ny=0 and y=9: never occ.\n\nPlayer position: at time τ, we are at y_τ.\n\nCollision if at time τ, row y_τ is occupied, meaning that for that y and τ, it is occupied as above.\n\ny_τ must be between 0 and 9.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=4.\n\nAt τ=0, what is occupied? For y=4, occ at τ=4,5,6, but τ=0: y=4 not occ, since τ=0 not in 4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 occ only τ=2, etc.\n\nAt τ=0:\n\n- y=4: not occ (occ only τ=4,5,6)\n\n- y=5: not occ (occ only τ=2)\n\netc. All rows not occ at τ=0 except possibly, but y=4 is safe at τ=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is always safe.\n\nThe dangerous times are when we might be on occupied rows.\n\nSpecifically, for y=4, it is occupied at τ=4,5,6, so we must not be on y=4 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 is occupied only at τ=2, so must not be on y=5 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8 at τ=2.\n\ny=1,2,3 occupied at τ=8,9,10,11, but since we are starting from y=4 and going to y=9, we probably won't go to lower rows, but we could if necessary, but to minimize time, we should go up directly.\n\ny=0 is safe, but going down might waste time.\n\nSimilarly, staying might be needed.\n\nNow, from y=4, we can go up to y=5,6,etc.\n\nBut let's see the constraints.\n\nWe need y_t for t=0,1,2,... such that y_0=4, and y_t=9 for some t, and for each t, y_t not occupied at time t.\n\nThat is, at time t, row y_t is not occupied.\n\nNow, the occupation:\n\n- At t=2: y=5,6,7,8 are occupied. So must not be on y=5,6,7,8 at t=2.\n\n- At t=4,5,6: y=4 is occupied, so must not be on y=4 at t=4,5,6.\n\n- At t=8,9,10,11: y=1,2,3 occupied, but since we are going up, we might not be there.\n\nBut for min time, we can ignore lower rows if we don't go there.\n\nNow, y_t must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so min time to go from 4 to 9 is 5 steps: U,U,U,U,U to reach y=9 at t=5.\n\nBut we need to check if we can do that without collision.\n\nSo let's simulate t=0 to t=5.\n\nt=0: y=4, not occupied (since occ at t=4,5,6, not t=0), so safe. We can choose action.\n\nSuppose we go up: a_0 = U, then y_1 = 5.\n\nt=1: now at y=5. Is y=5 occupied at t=1? y=5 occ only at t=2, not t=1, so safe. Choose action, say U, a_1=U, y_2=6.\n\nt=2: now at y=6. But at t=2, y=6 is occupied! Because y=6 occ at t=2.\n\nCollision! Not good.\n\nIf at t=1 we don't go up, but stay or down.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nAt t=0, if we stay: a_0=S, y_1=4.\n\nt=1: y=4, not occ at t=1 (occ at 4,5,6), so safe. But we are still at y=4.\n\nThen if we go up at t=1, a_1=U, y_2=5.\n\nt=2: y=5, but at t=2, y=5 is occupied. Collision.\n\nIf at t=1 we stay again, a_1=S, y_2=4.\n\nt=2: y=4, is it occ at t=2? y=4 occ at t=4,5,6, not t=2, so safe. But we need to move up.\n\nBut at t=2, we are at y=4, safe, then we can go up, a_2=U, y_3=5.\n\nt=3: y=5, not occ (occ only t=2), so safe.\n\nThen go up, a_3=U, y_4=6.\n\nt=4: y=6, is it occ? y=6 occ only at t=2, not t=4, so not occ. But y=4 is occ at t=4, but we are on y=6, not y=4.\n\ny=6 at t=4: not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=4: occ only t=2, not t=4.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen continue: a_4=U, y_5=7.\n\nt=5: y=7, not occ (occ only t=2 for y=7? y=7 occ at t=2, not other times, so safe.\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=8.\n\nt=6: y=8, occ only at t=2, not t=6, safe.\n\na_6=U, y_7=9.\n\nt=7: y=9, safe, and we reached.\n\nBut at t=7, y=9, which is the goal? We need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nAt time t=7, we are at y=7? Let's list:\n\nt=0: y=4, action? In this sequence, we stayed at t=0 and t=1? I think I missed.\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt t=0: start y=4\n\nIf we do S at t=0, y_1=4 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=4, safe, do S? Or U.\n\nIn my earlier, I said at t=1, if we do S, y_2=4 at t=2\n\nt=2: y=4, safe (since occ only t=4,5,6 for y=4)\n\nThen do U, y_3=5 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=5, safe (occ only t=2)\n\nDo U, y_4=6 at t=4\n\nt=4: y=6, safe (occ only t=2 for y=6)\n\nDo U, y_5=7 at t=5\n\nt=5: y=7, safe\n\nDo U, y_6=8 at t=6\n\nt=6: y=8, safe (occ only t=2)\n\nDo U, y_7=9 at t=7\n\nt=7: y=9, safe, reached.\n\nBut we used 7 turns: from t=0 to t=6 actions, position at t=7 is y=9.\n\nt is time index, at time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action at t, we go to t+1.\n\nTo reach y_t=9 at some t.\n\nIn this case, at t=7, y=9.\n\nBut we started at t=0, so 7 steps? t from 0 to 6: 7 actions? Let's see.\n\nTime: turn 8+t for t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt t=0 (turn 8), position y=4.\n\nWe take action a_{t_1 + t} for t=0,1,2,... up to H-1, and after H actions, at time H, we have y_H =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=H-1, and at t=H, position is 9.\n\nMin H such that we can reach.\n\nIn the above, with actions: at t=0: S (stay), t=1: S (stay), t=2: U, t=3: U, t=4: U, t=5: U, t=6: U, then at t=7, y=9.\n\nSo H=7, since after 7 actions, at time 7, y=9.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nWe could have reached earlier.\n\nFor example, if we go up faster, but at t=2, we cannot be on y=5,6,7,8 because they are occupied.\n\nAt t=2, y=5,6,7,8 are all occupied.\n\nSo we must not be on these rows at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4,5,6, we cannot be on y=4.\n\nNow, at t=0: y=4, safe.\n\nIf we go up at t=0: a_0=U, y_1=5 at t=1.\n\nt=1: y=5, not occ (occ only t=2), safe.\n\nNow at t=1, we need to choose action for t=1.\n\nIf we go up to y=6 at t=2, but t=2 y=6 occupied, collision.\n\nIf we stay: a_1=S, y_2=5 at t=2, but y=5 at t=2 occupied, collision.\n\nIf we go down: a_1=D, y_2=4 at t=2.\n\nt=2: y=4, not occ (occ at t=4,5,6, not t=2), safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we are at t=2, y=4.\n\nThen a_2=U, y_3=5 at t=3, safe (y=5 not occ t=3)\n\na_3=U, y_4=6 at t=4\n\nt=4: y=6, not occ, but y=4 is occ at t=4, but we are on y=6, so ok.\n\nThen a_4=U, y_5=7 at t=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=8 at t=6\n\na_6=U, y_7=9 at t=7\n\nSame as before, but we went up at t=0, then down at t=1, so we have extra down move, still reach at t=7.\n\nWorse.\n\nAfter t=1 y=5, if we could go to another row, but only up, down, stay.\n\nNo, we have to be on y=5 at t=1.\n\nThen only choices: U to y=6 at t=2, but occupied; S to y=5 at t=2, occupied; D to y=4 at t=2, safe.\n\nSo only down or stay, but stay causes collision, so must go down to y=4 at t=2.\n\nThen proceed up, same as before.\n\nBut we lost time.\n\nAt t=0, instead of staying, go up to y=5 at t=1, then down to y=4 at t=2, but then we are back, and have to go up again.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps we can be on other rows at critical times.\n\nFor example, at t=2, we need to be on a row not occupied, which are y=1,2,3,4,9 but y=9 far, or y=0.\n\ny=1,2,3 are occupied at t=2? No, y=1,2,3 occupied at t=8,9,10,11, not at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, occupied rows: y=5,6,7,8.\n\nSo safe rows at t=2: y=0,1,2,3,4,9.\n\ny=9 is far.\n\ny=4 is safe at t=2.\n\ny=3 is safe at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,1,0.\n\nBut we start from y=4, so going down might be inefficient.\n\nTo reach faster, we need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at t=2, and not on y=4 at t=4,5,6.\n\nNow, min time: if no obstacles, 5 up moves, reach at t=5.\n\nBut at t=2, we cannot be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nIf we go directly up:\n\nt=0: y=4, safe\n\na_0=U, y_1=5 at t=1, safe\n\nt=1: y=5, safe (not t=2)\n\nNow, we need to not be at y=5,6,7,8 at t=2.\n\nSo at t=1, we must move to a position such that at t=2 we are not on those.\n\nBut y_{t+1} depends on a_t.\n\nAt t=1, we are at y=5.\n\nWe choose a_1.\n\nIf a_1=U, y_2=6, but at t=2 y=6 occupied, bad.\n\nIf a_1=S, y_2=5, occupied at t=2, bad.\n\nIf a_1=D, y_2=4, then at t=2 y=4, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up, but as before.\n\nAfter y_2=4, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=2, to y=9, min 5 up moves: at t=3 y=5, t=4 y=6, t=5 y=7, t=6 y=8, t=7 y=9.\n\nBut at t=4, we are at y=6, which is fine, but y=4 is occupied at t=4, but we are not on it.\n\nProblem: at t=4,5,6, we cannot be on y=4, but we are not, we are on y=6 at t=4.\n\nt=4: y=6, not occupied.\n\nThen at t=5: if y=7, not occupied.\n\nBut we have issue at t=4,5,6 with y=4, but we are not on it.\n\nIn this path: t=0: y=4\n\na0=U, y1=5\n\nt=1: y=5\n\na1=D, y2=4  (to avoid t=2 collision)\n\nt=2: y=4, safe\n\nNow, from here, we need to go up.\n\na2=U, y3=5 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=5, safe (not occ)\n\na3=U, y4=6 at t=4\n\nt=4: y=6, safe (y=6 occ only t=2)\n\na4=U, y5=7 at t=5\n\nt=5: y=7, safe\n\na5=U, y6=8 at t=6\n\nt=6: y=8, safe (occ only t=2)\n\na6=U, y7=9 at t=7\n\nReach at t=7.\n\nBut we have a down move, which costs extra.\n\nWithout down, can we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at t=0, we stay: a0=S, y1=4 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=4, safe\n\nNow at t=1, we are at y=4.\n\nWe need to choose a1.\n\nIf we go up, a1=U, y2=5 at t=2, but y=5 occ at t=2, collision.\n\nIf stay, a1=S, y2=4 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen as before, a2=U, y3=5 at t=3, etc., to y7=9 at t=7.\n\nSame.\n\nBut we used a stay at t=0 and t=1.\n\nNow, to save time, perhaps we can be on a different row at t=2.\n\nFor example, at t=1, from y=4, if we go down? a1=D, y2=3 at t=2.\n\nt=2: y=3, is it occupied? y=3 occ only at t=8,9,10,11, not t=2, so safe.\n\nThen from y=3 at t=2, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut y=3 to y=9, need 6 up moves, which would take to t=8 or more.\n\nFor example, a2=U, y3=4 at t=3\n\nBut at t=3, y=4 not occ, but then we have to go up, but at t=4, y=4 occ, so we cannot be on y=4 at t=4.\n\nIf at t=3 y=4, then if we go up, a3=U, y4=5 at t=4.\n\nt=4: y=5, not occ (occ only t=2), safe.\n\nThen a4=U, y5=6 at t=5\n\na5=U, y6=7 at t=6\n\na6=U, y7=8 at t=7\n\na7=U, y8=9 at t=8\n\nReach at t=8, worse than t=7.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=2, if we go up faster, but we are at y=3 t=2.\n\na2=U, y3=4 at t=3\n\nBut at t=3, we are at y=4, which is safe since not occ at t=3.\n\nThen we need to leave y=4 before t=4.\n\nSo at t=3, we must go up, a3=U, y4=5 at t=4.\n\nAs above, then to y=9 at t=8.\n\nStill t=8.\n\nIf we go up twice, but we can only move one per turn.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=2, min to y=9 is 6 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U, to y4 at t=3, y5 at t=4, y6 t=5, y7 t=6, y8 t=7, y9 t=8.\n\nBut at t=4, y=5 is safe, no problem.\n\nBut we reach at t=8.\n\nWorse than the first sequence which reached at t=7.\n\nFirst sequence: stay at t=0 and t=1, then up from t=2 to t=6, reach t=7.\n\nOr with down, same.\n\nCan we reach by t=6?\n\nSuppose we want y_t=9 at t=6.\n\nThen we need to have moved up 5 times in 6 actions, so one stay or down, but down not helpful.\n\nFor example, actions: U,U,U,U,U with one stay somewhere.\n\nBut at t=2, we must not be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, y_t: t=0 y=4\n\nAfter actions.\n\nSuppose at t=0, U, y1=5\n\nt=1: y=5\n\nNow at t=1, if we could go directly to y=7 or something, but no, only one step.\n\nIf at t=1, we stay, y2=5 at t=2, occupied, bad.\n\nIf down, y2=4, then we are at y=4 t=2.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at t=6, we need to go from y=4 at t=2 to y=9 at t=6, which is 4 moves: but 4 up moves to y=8 at t=6, not y=9.\n\nFrom t=2 to t=6, 4 actions: a2 to a5, positions y3 to y6.\n\ny2=4 at t=2\n\na2: U, y3=5 at t=3\n\na3: U, y4=6 at t=4\n\na4: U, y5=7 at t=5\n\na5: U, y6=8 at t=6\n\nThen y6=8, not 9. To reach y=9, need another action at t=6, y7=9 at t=7.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we start by going up faster but skip the dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nFor example, at t=0, go up to y=5 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, since we cannot be on y=5,6,7,8 at t=2, and we are at y=5, we must go down to y=4 at t=2.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut to reach earlier, from y=4 at t=2, if we can go up faster, but we need to be at y=9 at say t=5, but from y=4 at t=2, after 3 actions, y5 at t=5, max y=7 if all U.\n\nNot 9.\n\nImpossible to reach before t=5? Min is 5 moves, but with constraints, we might need to delay.\n\nt=5: y=9 possible only if we started with U at t=0, U t=1, U t=2, but at t=2 we cannot be on y=6 if we go U from y=5, or if we are at y=5 at t=2, occupied.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf we are at y=4 at t=0, U to y=5 at t=1, then at t=1 we go U to y=6 at t=2, but y=6 at t=2 occupied.\n\nOr go D to y=4 at t=2, then U to y=5 at t=3, etc., but y=5 at t=3 is safe, then U to y=6 at t=4, U to y=7 at t=5, then we need to go to y=9, so at t=5 y=7, need two more U to y=9 at t=7.\n\nSame.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=3 or something.\n\nBut let's list the positions over time.\n\nAnother idea: since y=4 is occupied at t=4,5,6, we need to be off y=4 by t=4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=2, we need to be off y=5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, at t=0: y=4, must leave before t=4? No, at t=4, if we are on y=4, collision, but we can be on y=4 at t=0,1,2,3, just not t=4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=2, cannot be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut let's see the critical points.\n\nSuppose we do nothing at first: stay at y=4 until we must move.\n\nBut at t=3, we can be on y=4, since not occ.\n\nThen at t=3, we go up to y=5.\n\nBut at t=3, y=5 safe.\n\nThen at t=4, we can be on y=6, since y=6 not occ at t=4.\n\nThen t=5 y=7, t=6 y=8, t=7 y=9.\n\nBut at t=4, y=6 is safe, yes.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=0: y=4, safe\n\na0: S, y1=4 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=4, safe\n\na1: S, y2=4 at t=2\n\nt=2: y=4, safe\n\na2: U, y3=5 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=5, safe\n\na3: U, y4=6 at t=4\n\nt=4: y=6, safe\n\na4: U, y5=7 at t=5\n\nt=5: y=7, safe\n\na5: U, y6=8 at t=6\n\nt=6: y=8, safe\n\na6: U, y7=9 at t=7\n\nReach at t=7 with 3 stays and 4 ups, but 7 actions.\n\nWe used stays at t=0 and t=1, but at t=2 we stayed? In above, at t=0,1,2 we stayed? No.\n\nIn above: at t=0, action a0=S, to y1=4\n\nt=1, action a1=S, to y2=4\n\nt=2, action a2=U, to y3=5\n\netc.\n\nBut at t=2, we are at y=4, which is fine.\n\nBut we can go up earlier if possible.\n\nFor example, at t=0, go up to y=5 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, we are at y=5.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on y=5 at t=2, so we must move: either down or up, but up to y=6 at t=2 occupied, down to y=4 at t=2 safe.\n\nThen at t=2, y=4.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut we used one up and one down, net no progress.\n\nWorse.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=3 or something, but not helpful.\n\nAnother thought: at t=1, from y=5, we stay or down, but both problematic for t=2 except down to 4.\n\nNo.\n\nSo it seems we cannot reach before t=7.\n\nBut let's check if we can reach at t=6.\n\nSuppose y6=9.\n\nThen we need to have y_t from t=0 to t=6.\n\ny0=4\n\ny6=9, so net +5 in 6 steps, so one stay or one down, but down not good, so one stay.\n\nFor example, actions: four U and one S, or five U and one D, etc.\n\nBut positions: let's list possible paths.\n\nSuppose we have a stay at some point.\n\nCase: stay at t=0: a0=S, y1=4\n\nThen y1=4\n\nNow at t=1, y=4\n\nIf we go U, a1=U, y2=5 at t=2, but t=2 y=5 occupied, bad.\n\nIf stay, a1=S, y2=4 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen y2=4\n\nThen we need to reach y=9 by t=6.\n\nFrom t=2 y=4 to t=6 y=9, need +5 in 4 steps, impossible, max y=8 at t=6.\n\ny6=8 if all U from t=2.\n\nNot 9.\n\nIf no stay at t=0, but at another time.\n\nSuppose a0=U, y1=5 at t=1\n\nThen at t=1, y=5\n\nNow, to avoid t=2 on y=5,6,7,8, we must have y2 <=4 or y2=9, but y2=9 impossible.\n\nSo y2 <=4.\n\nSince y1=5, to have y2<=4, we must do D, so a1=D, y2=4 at t=2.\n\nThen y2=4\n\nNow from here, to y6=9, need +5 in 4 steps, impossible, y6 <=8.\n\ny6=8 if all U.\n\nNot 9.\n\nSuppose we have a stay later.\n\nFor example, a0=U, y1=5\n\na1=D, y2=4  (forced to avoid collision)\n\nThen y2=4\n\nNow from t=2 to t=6, 4 actions: a2,a3,a4,a5\n\ny3, y4, y5, y6\n\ny6 <= y2 +4 =8 if all U.\n\nCannot reach y=9.\n\nIf we start with S: a0=S, y1=4\n\nThen at t=1, y=4\n\nIf we do S again, a1=S, y2=4\n\nThen y2=4\n\nThen a2=U, y3=5\n\na3=U, y4=6\n\na4=U, y5=7\n\na5=U, y6=8\n\ny6=8, not 9.\n\nNeed one more U to y7=9.\n\nSo always 7 steps to reach y=9.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 earlier and stay or something.\n\nBut y=8 at t=2 is occupied, so we cannot be on it at t=2.\n\nBut at other times safe.\n\nBut to reach y=8, we need to go through lower rows.\n\nI think t=7 is the minimal.\n\nIn the first sequence, we reached at t=7 with actions: at t=0: S, t=1: S, t=2: U, t=3: U, t=4: U, t=5: U, t=6: U\n\nThen y7=9.\n\nBut we have two S at beginning.\n\nWe can have the S later, but not necessary.\n\nTo have fewer actions, but H is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1 actions, position at t=H.\n\nMin H=7.\n\nBut let's confirm the occupation.\n\nAt t=4, y=4 is occupied, but in the sequence, at t=4, we are at y=6, not y=4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=2, we are at y=4, not occupied.\n\nIn the sequence with S at t=0 and t=1.\n\nAt t=0: action a0=S, but at turn t_1 + t, t=0 is turn 8.\n\nTurn 8: position (0,4), we take action a_{t_1} = a_8.\n\nThen after action, at turn 9, position y.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 8: position y=4, take action, say S, then turn 9 position y=4\n\nTurn 9: position y=4, take action S, then turn 10 position y=4\n\nTurn 10: position y=4, take action U, then turn 11 position y=5\n\nTurn 11: position y=5, take action U, then turn 12 position y=6\n\nTurn 12: position y=6, take action U, then turn 13 position y=7\n\nTurn 13: position y=7, take action U, then turn 14 position y=8\n\nTurn 14: position y=8, take action U, then turn 15 position y=9\n\nAt turn 15, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 8 to turn 14, actions a8 to a14, 7 actions, H=7.\n\nt_1=8, actions from t=0 to t=H-1, H=7, actions a8 to a13? Let's index.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=8, so actions at turns 8,9,10,11,12,13,14 for H=7, then at turn 15, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions at turn 8,9,10,11,12,13,14.\n\nAfter last action at turn 14, position at turn 15 is y=9.\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt each turn, position and if occupied.\n\nTurn 8 (t=0): y=4, row y=4 at τ=0, not occupied (occ at τ=4,5,6)\n\nTurn 9 (t=1): y=4, same, τ=1, not occ\n\nTurn 10 (t=2): y=4, τ=2, not occ for y=4 (occ τ=4,5,6)\n\nTurn 11 (t=3): y=5, row y=5 at τ=3, y=5 occ only at τ=2, not τ=3, safe\n\nTurn 12 (t=4): y=6, row y=6 at τ=4, occ only at τ=2, not τ=4, safe\n\nTurn 13 (t=5): y=7, row y=7 at τ=5, occ only at τ=2, not τ=5, safe\n\nTurn 14 (t=6): y=8, row y=8 at τ=6, occ only at τ=2, not τ=6, safe\n\nTurn 15 (t=7): y=9, safe, no cars.\n\nNo collision.\n\nIs there a shorter sequence? H=6 would mean actions from t=0 to t=5, position at t=6 y=9.\n\ny6=9.\n\ny0=4, so in 6 steps, need to increase by 5, so must have five U and one other, but since min moves, probably one S or one D.\n\nBut with D, it decreases, so net less, cannot reach y=9 in 6 steps from y=4 with a down.\n\nMust have five U and one S, but the S might be at a time when we can.\n\nBut positions: y0=4\n\nAfter actions a0 to a5.\n\nSuppose a0=U, y1=5\n\na1=U, y2=6?

H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, meaning the number of actions in the sequence.\n\nIn the task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1? No.\n\nLet's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1?\"\n\nFrom the dynamics: after H actions, at time t_1 + H, position is reached.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position updated.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, at turn t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, H=7, actions at turn 8 to 13? t from 0 to 6.\n\nt=0: turn t_1 +0 =8, action a8\n\nt=1: turn 9, a9\n\n...\n\nt=6: turn 14, a14\n\nThen at turn 15, y=9.\n\nReached at turn t_1 + H =8+7=15.\n\nt_1 + H =8+7=15.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions: turn8:S, turn9:S, turn10:U, turn11:U, turn12:U, turn13:U, turn14:U\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4, there are multiple cars, but we considered only the first one for occupation, which is fine.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we stayed at turn8 and turn9, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can start with U but then adjust, but we saw it doesn't save time.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nH=7\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's make sure the turn numbers.\n\nt_1=8.\n\nActions for turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =8 to 14.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can have different actions, but same H.\n\nFor example, at turn8, we could go U, but then we have to go down at turn9, then proceed, but we reach at same time with extra move.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a row where \\(x = 0\\) is occupied by a car at the corresponding turn.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Reasoning:\n- **Freeway 1, 2, 3**: Occupied at turns \\(\\tau = 8, 9, 10, 11\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 8\\), so absolute turns 16, 17, 18, 19). The player never goes below \\(y = 4\\), so no collision.\n- **Freeway 4**: Occupied at turns \\(\\tau = 4, 5, 6\\) (absolute turns 12, 13, 14). The player is not on \\(y = 4\\) at these times.\n- **Freeway 5, 6, 7, 8**: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (absolute turn 10). The player is not on \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) at turn 10.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 8 (current turn)**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 4\\). At turn 8, \\(y = 4\\) is safe (not occupied).\n- **Turn 9**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 4\\). At turn 9, \\(y = 4\\) is safe (not occupied).\n- **Turn 10**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\). At turn 10, \\(y = 4\\) is safe (not occupied), and moving to \\(y = 5\\) occurs at turn 11.\n- **Turn 11**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\). At turn 11, \\(y = 5\\) is safe (not occupied at turn 11).\n- **Turn 12**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\). At turn 12, \\(y = 6\\) is safe (not occupied at turn 12).\n- **Turn 13**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\). At turn 13, \\(y = 7\\) is safe (not occupied at turn 13).\n- **Turn 14**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\). At turn 14, \\(y = 8\\) is safe (not occupied at turn 14).\n\nAfter the action at turn 14, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 15. No collisions occur during the sequence.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t1=9. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right with a constant speed. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn. Importantly, when you move to a new freeway, you're not on it until the next turn, so you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nLet me list out the car states for each freeway at t1=9.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-21, -32, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, head is at h, tail at τ, but for right-moving, it says span is [τ, h] with h > τ? Let's see the update.\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head should be the front, so for right-moving, head is larger than tail, I think.\n\nLook at freeway 4: (-12, -23, right, 4), since -12 > -23, so head is -12, tail is -23, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? But it says span(t1) for right-moving is [τ, h], so if τ = -23, h = -12, then [τ, h] = [-23, -12], which is from left to right, so tail at left, head at right.\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars seem to be right-moving except... all are right-moving in this state? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: (-21, -32, right, 3) so direction right.\n\nFreeway 2: same, right.\n\nFreeway 3: same, right.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars, all right, speeds 4.\n\nFirst car: (-12, -23, right, 4), so at t1=9, span = [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nSecond car: (24, 13, right, 4)? 24 and 13, 24>13, but if head is 24, tail is 13? That might be a typo or I misread.\n\nThe table says: (24, 13, right, 4), but 24 > 13, so if head is 24, tail is 13, and right-moving, then span should be [τ, h] = [13, 24]? But in the notation, it's written as (head, tail), so head=24, tail=13, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] = [13,24] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (60,49,right,4), head=60, tail=49, span [49,60]\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, so tail=-23, head=-12, span [-23,-12]\n\nNow freeway 5: (60,49,right,12), head=60,tail=49, span [49,60] and (-12,-23,right,12), span [-23,-12]\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8 same as 5.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 each have two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer position y_T is the freeway number.\n\nAt turn T, player is at (0, y_T), so freeway y_T.\n\nCollision if 0 ∈ span of a car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAnd when player moves, at turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but for collision at T, it's based on y_T.\n\nAlso, if y_T = y_{T+1}, player is on the same freeway, but for collision, it's per turn based on current position.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only check for collision on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, if you stay or move vertically, at turn T you are on y_T, so check collision on freeway y_T at T.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9, starting at turn 9, position (0,4).\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 in min turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find out when cars are at position 0 for each freeway.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with span at T, we need 0 ∈ [low, high] for some car.\n\nFor a right-moving car, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince t1=9, let Δt = T - 9, so at time T = 9 + Δt.\n\nThen for a car with initial τ, h, s, right-moving, span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\n0 in span if τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so only that.\n\nNow for each freeway, find when 0 is occupied, i.e., when there is a car such that 0 ∈ [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nWhich means τ + s Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s Δt, so -h/s ≤ Δt ≤ -τ/s? Let's solve.\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ h + s Δt ⇒ s Δt ≥ -h ⇒ Δt ≥ -h/s (if s>0)\n\nSecond, τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince s>0.\n\nAlso, since the span is [low, high], 0 in [low,high] iff low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nSo Δt must satisfy: τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSo from 0 ≤ h + s Δt: Δt ≥ ceil( -h / s )? But since time is discrete, we need to find integer Δt where this holds.\n\nSimilarly from τ + s Δt ≤ 0: Δt ≤ floor( -τ / s )? Let's think carefully.\n\nΔt is integer since turns are discrete.\n\nFor a given car, at time T=9+Δt, the span includes 0 if there exists integer n such that the car covers position 0 at that time.\n\nBut since cars move continuously but we have discrete checks, I think we need to find for which Δt, the inequality holds for some car on the freeway.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the cars and when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car, (-21,-32,right,3)\n\nSo τ = -32, h = -21, s=3\n\nSpan at T: [ -32 + 3Δt, -21 + 3Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -32 + 3Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -21 + 3Δt\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ -21 + 3Δt ⇒ 3Δt ≥ 21 ⇒ Δt ≥ 7\n\nSecond, -32 + 3Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 3Δt ≤ 32 ⇒ Δt ≤ 32/3 ≈ 10.666, so Δt ≤ 10 since integer.\n\nSo Δt ≥7 and Δt ≤10, so for Δt=7,8,9,10\n\nT=9+7=16 to 9+10=19, so at turns 16,17,18,19, freeway 1 has a car at position 0? Not necessarily at 0, but covering 0.\n\nAt T=16, span: -32 + 3*7 = -32+21= -11, -21+21=0, so [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is the right end, included? Since it's a closed interval, I assume, so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, at T=17: -32+24= -8, -21+24=3, [ -8,3], 0 inside.\n\nT=18: -32+27= -5, -21+27=6, [-5,6], 0 inside.\n\nT=19: -32+30= -2, -21+30=9, [-2,9], 0 inside.\n\nT=20: -32+33=1, -21+33=12, [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nT=6: -32+18= -14, -21+18= -3, [-14,-3], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 occupied at turns 16,17,18,19.\n\nΔt from 0, T from 9.\n\nNow freeway 2: same car, (-21,-32,right,3), same as freeway 1, so occupied at same times: T=16,17,18,19.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,4) so τ=-23, h=-12, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [ -23 +4Δt, -12 +4Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -23 +4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +4Δt\n\n0 ≤ -12 +4Δt ⇒ 4Δt ≥12 ⇒ Δt ≥3\n\n-23 +4Δt ≤0 ⇒ 4Δt ≤23 ⇒ Δt ≤ 23/4=5.75, so Δt ≤5\n\nThus Δt=3,4,5\n\nT=9+3=12, 13,14\n\nAt T=12: -23+12= -11? Δt=3, -23+4*3= -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=13: -23+16= -7, -12+16=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=14: -23+20= -3, -12+20=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=15: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (24,13,right,4) head=24, tail=13, so τ=13, h=24? In the notation, for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ=tail, h=head.\n\nGiven as (head, tail) = (24,13), so tail=13, head=24, so τ=13, h=24, s=4\n\nSpan: [13 +4Δt, 24 +4Δt]\n\n0 in span? 13 +4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 24 +4Δt\n\n13 +4Δt ≤0? Since Δt≥0, 13+4Δt ≥13>0, so left side >0, can never be ≤0, so 0 not in span ever, because the car is always to the right, min position 13 at Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (60,49,right,4) head=60, tail=49, τ=49, h=60, s=4\n\nSpan [49+4Δt, 60+4Δt], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 4, only first car can cover 0, at Δt=3,4,5, T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars (60,49,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12), τ=49, h=60, s=12\n\nSpan [49+12Δt, 60+12Δt], all large positive, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,12), head=-12, tail=-23, so τ=-23, h=-12, s=12\n\nSpan: [-23 +12Δt, -12 +12Δt]\n\n0 in span if -23 +12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +12Δt\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ -12 +12Δt ⇒ 12Δt ≥12 ⇒ Δt ≥1\n\nSecond, -23 +12Δt ≤0 ⇒ 12Δt ≤23 ⇒ Δt ≤ 23/12 ≈1.916, so Δt ≤1\n\nThus Δt ≥1 and Δt ≤1, so only Δt=1\n\nT=9+1=10\n\nAt T=10, span: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nFor other Δt, not.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, two cars, but (60,49,right,12) never covers 0, and (-12,-23,right,12) covers at Δt=1, T=10.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, occupied at T=10.\n\nFreeway 8: same, occupied at T=10.\n\nNow, freeway 9 and 0? But freeways are from 1 to 8, y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars mentioned, and player starts at y=4, target y=9.\n\ny=9 is the target, and since no freeway above, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is the bottom, but we don't go there.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when it is occupied at position 0:\n\nFreeway 1: occupied at T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: same, T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: occupied at T=10\n\nFreeway 6: occupied at T=10\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at T=10\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at T=10\n\nFor other times, these freeways are free at position 0.\n\nNow, player starts at turn t=9, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nPossible actions: U (up), D (down), S (stay).\n\nEach move changes y by +1, -1, 0, but y must be in [0,9], so at y=0, can't go down, at y=9 can't go up, but here we start at y=4, target y=9.\n\nSince we need to go up to y=9, and min turns, probably we want to go up as much as possible, but need to avoid collisions at certain times on certain freeways.\n\nThe collision depends on the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nWe need to plan a path from turn 9 onwards.\n\nCurrent turn 9, y=4.\n\nAt turn 9, we are on freeway 4. Is it occupied?\n\nAt T=9, which is Δt=0.\n\nFor freeway 4, at T=9, Δt=0, span first car: [-23, -12], 0 not in, since -12<0? -23 to -12, all negative, 0 not in. Other cars not cover, so freeway 4 is free at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 at T=9: Δt=0, second car span [-23, -12], 0 not in, first car [49,60] not, so free.\n\nBut freeway 5 occupied only at T=10.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since from y=4 to y=9, difference 5, so if we go up every turn, we reach in 5 turns: turn 9: y=4, after U, turn 10: y=5, turn 11: y=6, turn 12: y=7, turn 13: y=8, turn 14: y=9.\n\nBut we need to check for collisions at each turn.\n\nAt each turn T, when we are on y_T, we need that freeway y_T is not occupied at T.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn 9: at T=9, y=4, freeway 4. As above, free at T=9.\n\nTurn 10: at T=10, y=5, freeway 5. But freeway 5 is occupied at T=10! Because we have a car covering 0.\n\nSo collision if we are on freeway 5 at turn 10.\n\nTherefore, cannot be on freeway 5 at turn 10.\n\nSo this direct path has collision at turn 10.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps go down first or stay to avoid being on freeway 5 at turn 10.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince freeway 5,6,7,8 all occupied only at T=10, and free otherwise.\n\nFreeway 5: occ T=10\n\nFreeway 6: occ T=10\n\nFreeway 7: occ T=10\n\nFreeway 8: occ T=10\n\nFreeway 4 occ T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 occ T=16,17,18,19\n\nWe start at turn 9, y=4.\n\nTo reach y=9, min 5 moves up, but we might need to delay or something.\n\nSince freeways 5-8 are only occupied at T=10, if we are not on them at turn 10, we are fine.\n\nTurn 10 is critical for y=5,6,7,8.\n\nAt turn 10, if we are on y=5,6,7, or 8, we collide.\n\nSo we must not be on freeways 5,6,7,8 at turn 10.\n\nThat means at turn 10, we must be on y <=4 or y>=9, but y=9 is target, but we may not be there yet.\n\ny=0 to 4 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is the target, so if we can be at y=9 at turn 10, that might be possible, but let's see.\n\nAt turn 10, if we are at y=9, then we are on freeway 9, but freeway 9 has no cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0,1,2,3,4: freeway 1,2,3,4.\n\nAt turn 10, freeway 1: is it occupied? Freeway 1 occupied only at T=16-19, not at T=10, so free.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2,3 free at T=10.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=10: Δt=1, for freeway 4, occupied at T=12,13,14, not at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, Δt=1, freeway 4: first car span [-23+4*1, -12+4*1] = [-19,-8], all negative, 0 not in. Other cars not cover, so free.\n\nSo at turn 10, freeways 1,2,3,4 are free, and 9 is free.\n\nBut we are at turn 9 now.\n\nAt turn 9, we are at y=4.\n\nWe need to choose action at turn 9 to set y for turn 10.\n\nAfter action at turn 9, y_{10} is determined.\n\nAt turn 10, we must not be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nSo possible y at turn 10: 0,1,2,3,4,9.\n\nBut from y=4 at turn 9, we can go to y=3 (D), y=4 (S), y=5 (U).\n\ny=5 is forbidden at turn 10, so we cannot go to y=5 at turn 10.\n\nSo at turn 9, we can only do S or D, to y=4 or y=3 at turn 10.\n\nIf we go to y=3, or stay at y=4.\n\nThen at turn 10, we are at y=4 or y=3, which is safe for turn 10.\n\nThen we can proceed up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nAlso, later we have issues on freeway 4 at T=12,13,14.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can reach quickly.\n\nMin H: since we need to go from 4 to 9, 5 steps, but with detour, might take more.\n\nFirst, avoid turn 10 problem.\n\nSo at turn 9: instead of U, we do S or D.\n\nCase 1: at turn 9, do S, so y_{10} =4.\n\nThen at turn 10, we are on y=4, freeway 4, which is free at T=10, as above.\n\nThen at turn 10, we can do U to go to y=5.\n\nBut at turn 10, if we do U, then y_{11} = y_{10} +1 =5.\n\nNow turn 11: at T=11, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nIs freeway 5 occupied at T=11?\n\nFreeway 5: cars, the one that covers 0 only at T=10, not at other times.\n\nAt T=11, Δt=2, for second car: span [-23 +12*2, -12 +12*2] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in. First car [49+24,60+24]=[73,84], not. So freeway 5 free at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=5 at turn 11, safe.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut we need to check later times.\n\nTurn 9: S, so y=4 at T=9 (safe), then after S, y_{10}=4.\n\nTurn 10: at T=10, y=4 (safe), then do U, so y_{11} =5.\n\nTurn 11: at T=11, y=5 (freeway 5, safe as above), then do U, y_{12}=6.\n\nTurn 12: at T=12, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nIs freeway 6 occupied at T=12?\n\nFreeway 6: cars similar to 5, occupied only at T=10.\n\nAt T=12, Δt=3, second car: [-23 +12*3, -12+12*3] = [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24], 0 not in. First car [49+36,60+36]=[85,96], not. So free at T=12.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 safe at T=12.\n\nThen U to y_{13}=7.\n\nTurn 13: T=13, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt T=13, freeway 7: similar, occupied only at T=10, so at T=13 free, safe.\n\nU to y_{14}=8.\n\nTurn 14: T=14, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt T=14, freeway 8: occupied only at T=10, so free, safe.\n\nThen U to y_{15}=9.\n\nTurn 15: T=15, y=9, which is the target, and no cars, so safe.\n\nBut we reach y=9 at turn 15, but we started from turn 9, so turns: from turn 9 to 15, that's 7 turns? Let's list the actions.\n\nStart turn 9: position y=4\n\nAfter action, y_{t} for next turn.\n\nTurn 9: action S, so y_{10} =4\n\nTurn 10: at (0,4), action U, so y_{11} =5\n\nTurn 11: at (0,5), action U, y_{12}=6\n\nTurn 12: at (0,6), action U, y_{13}=7\n\nTurn 13: at (0,7), action U, y_{14}=8\n\nTurn 14: at (0,8), action U, y_{15}=9\n\nTurn 15: at (0,9), which is the target, so we have reached at turn 15.\n\nNumber of turns: from turn 9 to turn 15, that's 6 turns? Turns involved: turn 9,10,11,12,13,14: that's 6 actions, and at turn 15 we are at y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1, so sequence of H actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, position y=9.\n\nIn this case, after 6 actions: actions at turn 9,10,11,12,13,14, and at turn 15, y=9.\n\nSo H=6.\n\nBut is this minimal? Without delay, we could reach at turn 14, but we had to stay at turn 9.\n\nIn the direct path, we would reach at turn 14 with 5 actions, but collision at turn 10.\n\nWith one stay, we take 6 actions to reach at turn 15.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach faster.\n\nAnother option: at turn 9, instead of S, do D to y=3.\n\nThen at turn 10, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 at T=10: occupied only at T=16-19, so free, safe.\n\nThen from y=3, we need to go up to 9, which takes more moves, so longer, not better.\n\nFor example, turn 9: D, y_{10}=3\n\nTurn 10: U, y_{11}=4\n\nThen same as before, but now at turn 11 y=4, then to y=9 in 5 more moves, so reach at turn 16, worse.\n\nSo not good.\n\nAt turn 9, do S, as before.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we reached at turn 15 with H=6.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 4 occupied at T=12,13,14, but in that sequence, we were on y=6,7,8 at those times, not on y=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4.\n\nIn turn 12, we were on y=6, not y=4.\n\nAt T=12, freeway 4 is occupied, but if we are not on it, no problem.\n\nIn the sequence, we were on y=6 at T=12, which is freeway 6, free.\n\nSimilarly at T=13, y=7, freeway 7 free.\n\nT=14, y=8, freeway 8 free.\n\nAnd at T=15, y=9, safe.\n\nBut we have freeway 1,2,3 occupied later, but we don't go there, so fine.\n\nSo with H=6, we can reach.\n\nBut can we reach faster?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 earlier.\n\nSuppose at turn 9, we do U immediately, but then at turn 10, y=5, which is occupied, collision.\n\nUnless we can skip turn 10 or something.\n\nPerhaps go down and then up faster, but from y=4 to y=9, min 5 up moves, but we need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, we must not be on those, so we must be on y<=4 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 at turn 10: from y=4 at turn 9, to y=9 at turn 10, impossible in one move, since max +1.\n\nSo cannot be at y=9 before turn 14 at earliest, with all up.\n\nBut at turn 10, we must be at y<=4 or y=9, but y=9 not possible, so must be y<=4.\n\nThus at turn 10, y=4,3,2,1,0.\n\nFrom y=4 at turn 9, we can go to y=4 (S) or y=3 (D) or y=5 (U, but forbidden).\n\nSo only S or D at turn 9.\n\nThen at turn 10, we are at y=4 or y=3.\n\nIf y=4, we can go up from there.\n\nAs before, we reach y=9 at turn 15.\n\nIf at turn 9 we do D to y=3, then at turn 10 y=3, then we need to go up to 9, min 6 moves from turn 10, reach at turn 16, worse.\n\nSo best is to do S at turn 9, then U each turn to turn 14.\n\nBut at turn 14, we go to y=9.\n\nIn the sequence: actions at turn 9: S, turn 10: U, turn 11: U, turn 12: U, turn 13: U, turn 14: U.\n\nAfter turn 14 action U, y=9 at turn 15.\n\nH=6 actions.\n\nBut is there a way with H=5?\n\nWith H=5 actions, we start at turn 9, after 5 actions, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nThe actions would be from turn 9 to 13.\n\nAfter action at turn 13, y_{14} should be 9.\n\nSince we start at y=4, to reach y=9 in 5 moves, we need exactly 5 up moves, no down or stay, because each U increases by 1, D decreases, S same, so to increase by 5, we need 5 U and no D or S, so all U.\n\nThus sequence: turn 9: U, y_{10}=5\n\nTurn 10: U, y_{11}=6\n\nTurn 11: U, y_{12}=7\n\nTurn 12: U, y_{13}=8\n\nTurn 13: U, y_{14}=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nTurn 9: T=9, y=4, freeway 4, free, safe.\n\nTurn 10: T=10, y=5, freeway 5, occupied! At T=10, freeway 5 has car at 0, collision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nIf we do a down move, we cannot reach in 5 moves.\n\nFor example, if turn 9: D, y_{10}=3\n\nThen to reach y=9 at turn 14, we need from y=3 to y=9 in 4 moves, but 6 units, impossible with +1 per move, max increase 4 in 4 moves, to y=7, not 9.\n\nIf turn 9: S, y_{10}=4, then to y=9 in 4 moves: turn 10: U to5, turn11:U to6, turn12:U to7, turn13:U to8, then at turn14 y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{14}=9, we need after turn13 action, y=9, so from y at turn13, U to9, so y at turn13 must be 8.\n\nThen from start, at turn9 y=4.\n\nAfter 4 actions (t9 to t12), y_{13} should be 8.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=8 in 4 moves, need +4, so four U, no S or D.\n\nSequence: t9:U, y10=5; t10:U, y11=6; t11:U, y12=7; t12:U, y13=8; then t13:U, y14=9.\n\nBut at t10: y=5, T=10, collision.\n\nIf we have a down move, we cannot reach y=8 in time.\n\nFor example, t9: D, y10=3; then to y13=8, need +5 in 3 moves, impossible.\n\nt9: S, y10=4; then to y13=8 in 3 moves: need +4, but 3 moves, max +3 to y=7.\n\nCannot.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y=9 at turn 14 with H=5 actions; we must reach at turn 15 or later.\n\nWith H=6, we can reach at turn 15.\n\nIn my earlier sequence with S at t9, we have H=6.\n\nBut in that sequence, we used S at t9 and then U all, reaching at t15.\n\nBut we have freeway 4 occupied at T=12,13,14.\n\nIn the sequence: at T=12, we are on y=6, not y=4.\n\nSimilarly T=13, y=7; T=14, y=8; all not y=4, so fine.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=5? We saw no.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by not staying, but going down and up, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, from y=4, go down to y=0 or something, but that takes extra moves, worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 6.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1=9: S (stay)\n\nThen at turn 10, position (0,4)\n\nTurn 10: U (up) to y=5\n\nTurn 11: U to y=6\n\nTurn 12: U to y=7\n\nTurn 13: U to y=8\n\nTurn 14: U to y=9\n\nAt turn 14, after U, y=9 at turn 15.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=9 to t=14.\n\nt=9: action S\n\nt=10: action U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nAfter t=14 action, y=9 at t=15.\n\nH=6 actions.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the sequence above, at no point we are on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTurn 9 (T=9): y=4, freeway 4, not occupied.\n\nTurn 10 (T=10): y=4, freeway 4, not occupied (free at T=10)\n\nTurn 11 (T=11): y=5, freeway 5, not occupied (only at T=10)\n\nTurn 12 (T=12): y=6, freeway 6, not occupied (only at T=10)\n\nTurn 13 (T=13): y=7, freeway 7, not occupied (only at T=10)\n\nTurn 14 (T=14): y=8, freeway 8, not occupied (only at T=10)\n\nAnd after turn 14 action U, at turn 15, y=9, target.\n\nWe don't need to check turn 15 for action, since we reached.\n\nNow, but at turn 14, we are at y=8, which is free, and we go to y=9.\n\nIs there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we do nothing at first, but we need to go up.\n\nPerhaps we can go up immediately but avoid the collision by being on a different freeway, but no, at turn 10, if on y=5,6,7,8, collision.\n\nUnless we can be on y=9 at turn 10, impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 9, do U to y=5, but at turn 10, y=5, collision, so we must not be on y=5 at turn 10.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to y=3 at turn 9, then at turn 10 y=3, safe, then quickly up.\n\nBut from y=3 at turn 10, to y=9 at turn 14: need +6 in 4 moves, impossible, max +4 to y=7 at turn 14.\n\nTo reach at turn 15: from y=3 at turn 10, after 5 actions to turn 14, y=8 if all U, then at turn 15 y=9, same as before but started lower.\n\nWorse or same.\n\nt10: y=3, t11:U y=4, t12:U y=5, t13:U y=6, t14:U y=7, then need another U to y=8 at t15, and to y=9 at t16.\n\nReach at turn 16, worse than 15.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus the sequence with S at t9 is best.\n\nBut in that sequence, we have H=6.\n\nBut let's check if we can do with H=5 by taking a different path, but I think not.\n\nPerhaps at some point we stay to avoid later collisions, but in this case, no later collisions on the path to 9.\n\nFreeway 4 is occupied at T=12,13,14, but if we are not on it, fine.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on y=6,7,8 at those times, which are free.\n\nIf we were on y=4 at T=12, it would be occupied, but we are not.\n\nIn our sequence, we left y=4 at turn 10 (after action U, to y=5 at turn 11).\n\nAt turn 10, we are still at y=4, then move to y=5 at turn 11.\n\nAt T=12, we are at y=6, not y=4.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus minimal H is 6, with the sequence: S at t9, then U at t10, U at t11, U at t12, U at t13, U at t14.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the player position is given at (0,4) at turn t1=9.\n\nActions to be taken at each turn.\n\nSo for turn 9: action S\n\nTurn 10: action U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 15, position (0,9).\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 5, etc., we think it's fine.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 5 at T=11.\n\nT=11, Δt=2, freeway 5: car (-12,-23,right,12), span at T=11: τ + s Δt = -23 +12*2 = -23+24=1, h + s Δt = -12+24=12, so [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, other car not relevant.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt T=10 for freeway 5: τ + s Δt = -23 +12*1= -11, h + s Δt = -12+12=0, so [-11,0], 0 included, so occupied.\n\nBut in our sequence, at T=10, we are on y=4, not y=5.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer, we just need to give the sequence, I think.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: S (since t1=9)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U (turn 10)\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U (turn 11)\n\nTurn t_1 +3: U (turn 12)\n\nTurn t_1 +4: U (turn 13)\n\nTurn t_1 +5: U (turn 14)\n\nAfter that, at turn t_1 +6 =15, we are at (0,9).\n\nH=6.\n\nBut in the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t=t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=9, H=6, so actions at t=9 to 14, as above.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there a sequence with H=5? We saw no.\n\nSuppose we go up at turn 9 to y=5, but collision at turn 10, unavoidable if on y=5 at T=10.\n\nUnless we move off before, but at turn 9 we are at y=4, safe, then if we go to y=5 at turn 10, we are on y=5 at T=10, collision.\n\nIf we could teleport, no.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus H=6 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) is 6.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) at turn 10 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn. Cars move left or right with given speeds, and I must avoid being on a freeway when a car's span includes x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on the freeway y_T at that exact turn T. Also, when moving to a new freeway, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nCurrent turn is t1 = 10. Player position: (0,4). So at turn 10, the player is on freeway y=4.\n\nNow, let's list the cars on each freeway at turn t1=10. The cars are given with their head, tail, direction, and speed. I need to compute for each car where its span is at any given future turn.\n\nFirst, for freeway k, which corresponds to y=k. So freeway 1 is y=1, up to freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nCars on freeway 1: one car: head h=-18, tail τ=-29, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nSince it's moving right, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: initial span [τ, h] at t1, then at T, [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says \"(-18, -29, right, 3)\". I think head is -18, tail is -29. But typically, for right-moving, head is greater than tail, but here head is -18, tail is -29, and since it's moving right, head should be on the right, so if tail is -29 and head is -18, that means the car is from x=-29 to x=-18, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would decrease.\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except... let's see the directions.\n\nFreeway 1: right, so moving right.\n\nFreeway 2: same, right, s=3.\n\nFreeway 3: same, right, s=3.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (-8, -19, right, 4), (28, 17, right, 4)? Head 28, tail 17? That might be a typo or something. Head should be greater than tail for right-moving? Let's see.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor the first car on freeway 4: h=-8, τ=-19, right, s=4. So head -8, tail -19, since -8 > -19, so it's from x=-19 to x=-8, moving right.\n\nSecond car: (28, 17, right, 4). Head 28, tail 17, so if moving right, head should be greater, 28>17, so from 17 to 28, moving right.\n\nBut direction is right, so it should be moving to increasing x, so if head is 28, tail 17, as it moves right, both increase, so span [17 + s(T-t1), 28 + s(T-t1)]? At t1, span is [17,28] I think, but let's confirm the notation.\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, initial span [τ, h] at t1, then at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for (h, τ, d, s), if d=right, then initial span is [τ, h] if τ < h, which it should be.\n\nIn freeway 4, first car: h=-8, τ=-19, so τ=-19, h=-8, so initial span at t1 is [ -19, -8 ]\n\nAs it moves right, at T, span [ -19 + 4*(T-10), -8 + 4*(T-10) ]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (28, 17, right, 4), so τ=17, h=28, initial span [17,28], at T, [17 + 4*(T-10), 28 + 4*(T-10)]\n\nThird car: (-48, -59, right, 4), τ=-59, h=-48, span [-59, -48] at t1, at T, [-59 + 4*(T-10), -48 + 4*(T-10)]\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, right, s=12, span at t1: [-59, -48], at T: [-59 + 12*(T-10), -48 + 12*(T-10)]\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 12), so h=0, τ=-11, span at t1: [-11, 0], since τ=-11, h=0.\n\nAt T: [-11 + 12*(T-10), 0 + 12*(T-10)] = [-11 + 12(T-10), 12(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5, two cars identical: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nNow, the player starts at y=4 at turn 10.\n\nI need to go to y=9. Since y from 0 to 9, and freeways are 1 to 8, so y=9 is the top, no cars there, I think. y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but the goal is to reach (0,9), so at y=9, no cars to worry about, I just need to be there.\n\nThe collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nBut the player starts at y=4, needs to go up to y=9.\n\nMinimal moves: from y=4 to y=9, that's 5 steps up, so at least 5 turns if I go up every turn. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nBut I need to check if I can go directly up without colliding.\n\nFirst, let's consider the path. Player can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, so I need to move from y=4 to y=9.\n\nThe critical part is when I'm on freeways y=1 to 8, I must not have a car on that freeway with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, at the turn I move, I'm on the current freeway, and I arrive at the new one next turn.\n\nNow, since I start at y=4 at turn 10, I need to see for each future turn, for each freeway, when cars have 0 in their span.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t=10 being current.\n\nFor a freeway i, at turn t, there is a collision if for some car on i, 0 is in the span at t.\n\nSpan at t is computed based on initial at t1=10.\n\nDefine delta_t = t - 10, so at delta_t=0, it's turn 10.\n\nThen for each car, the span at time t (from t1) is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s * delta_t, h + s * delta_t]\n\nFor left-moving, but all are right-moving here, no left-moving cars given.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, according to the table.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: right, s=3\n\nFreeway 4: all right, s=4\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: cars with s=12, all right.\n\nNo left-moving cars.\n\nSo only right-moving.\n\nNow, for a car, 0 is in span at t if min_span <= 0 <= max_span, i.e., τ + s delta_t <= 0 <= h + s delta_t\n\nSince for right-moving, τ + s delta_t is the left end, h + s delta_t is the right end.\n\nIn the span [left, right], left = τ + s delta_t, right = h + s delta_t.\n\n0 in span iff left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSo for each car, we can find when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen for each freeway, if any car has 0 in span at time t, then that freeway is occupied at x=0 at time t.\n\nPlayer must not be on that freeway at that time.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and when they cover x=0.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car: τ=-29, h=-18, s=3, dir=right.\n\nSo left end at t: -29 + 3 delta_t\n\nRight end: -18 + 3 delta_t\n\n0 in span iff -29 + 3 delta_t <= 0 <= -18 + 3 delta_t\n\nSolve:\n\nFirst inequality: -29 + 3 delta_t <= 0 => 3 delta_t <= 29 => delta_t <= 29/3 ≈ 9.666, so delta_t <= 9 since integer? delta_t is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nt and delta_t are integers, since turns are discrete.\n\nt1=10, t=10,11,12,... so delta_t = t - 10, integer >=0.\n\nSimilarly, positions are integers? The span has integer values, I think, since head and tail are integers, speed integer, so positions are integers.\n\nIn the car positions, h and τ are integers, s integers, so span at integer positions.\n\nSo for freeway 1 car:\n\n-29 + 3 delta_t <= 0 <= -18 + 3 delta_t\n\nFirst: -29 + 3 delta_t <= 0 => 3 delta_t <= 29 => delta_t <= 9.666, so delta_t <= 9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -18 + 3 delta_t => 3 delta_t >= 18 => delta_t >= 6\n\nSo for delta_t from 6 to 9 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\ndelta_t=6: left = -29 + 18 = -11, right = -18 + 18 = 0, so 0 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 is included.\n\ndelta_t=7: left=-29+21=-8, right=-18+21=3, 0 between -8 and 3, yes.\n\nSimilarly, delta_t=8: left=-29+24=-5, right=-18+24=6, 0 in.\n\ndelta_t=9: left=-29+27=-2, right=-18+27=9, 0 in.\n\ndelta_t=10: left=-29+30=1, right=-18+30=12, 0 < 1? 0 <= left=1, but left=1 >0, so 0 not >= left, so 0 not in [1,12], no.\n\nSimilarly, delta_t=5: left=-29+15=-14, right=-18+15=-3, 0 > -3? right=-3 <0, so 0 not <= right, no.\n\nSo freeway 1 occupied at x=0 when delta_t = 6,7,8,9 i.e. turns t=16,17,18,19.\n\nt=10 + delta_t, so t=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Cars: (-18,-29,right,3) same as freeway 1, so identical, occupied at same times: t=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 3: also same, (-18,-29,right,3), so same, t=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=-19, h=-8, s=4, right\n\nLeft: -19 + 4 delta_t\n\nRight: -8 + 4 delta_t\n\n0 in span: -19 + 4 delta_t <= 0 <= -8 + 4 delta_t\n\nFirst: -19 + 4 delta_t <= 0 => 4 delta_t <= 19 => delta_t <= 19/4=4.75, so delta_t <=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -8 + 4 delta_t => 4 delta_t >=8 => delta_t >=2\n\nSo for delta_t=2,3,4\n\nt=12,13,14\n\ndelta_t=2: left=-19+8=-11, right=-8+8=0, 0<=0<=0, yes\n\ndelta_t=3: left=-19+12=-7, right=-8+12=4, 0 in\n\ndelta_t=4: left=-19+16=-3, right=-8+16=8, 0 in\n\ndelta_t=1: left=-19+4=-15, right=-8+4=-4, both <0, 0 not <= right? right=-4<0, so 0 not <= right, no\n\ndelta_t=5: left=-19+20=1, right=-8+20=12, 1>0, 0 not >= left, no\n\nSecond car on freeway 4: (28,17,right,4) so τ=17, h=28, s=4\n\nLeft: 17 + 4 delta_t\n\nRight: 28 + 4 delta_t\n\n0 in span: 17 + 4 delta_t <= 0 <= 28 + 4 delta_t\n\nBut 17 + 4 delta_t >=17 >0 for delta_t>=0, so left end >=17>0, so 0 < left, never <= left, so 0 never in span. This car is always to the right, never reaches x=0.\n\nThird car: (-48,-59,right,4) τ=-59, h=-48, s=4\n\nLeft: -59 + 4 delta_t\n\nRight: -48 + 4 delta_t\n\n0 in span: -59 + 4 delta_t <= 0 <= -48 + 4 delta_t\n\nFirst: -59 + 4 delta_t <= 0 => 4 delta_t <=59 => delta_t <=14.75, so <=14\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 4 delta_t => 4 delta_t >=48 => delta_t >=12\n\nSo for delta_t=12,13,14\n\nt=22,23,24\n\ndelta_t=12: left=-59+48=-11, right=-48+48=0, 0 in\n\ndelta_t=13: left=-59+52=-7, right=-48+52=4, 0 in\n\netc.\n\nBut for freeway 4, the dangerous times are from first car: t=12,13,14 and from third car: t=22,23,24, but second car never at 0.\n\nSo freeway 4 occupied at t=12,13,14 and t=22,23,24.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nLeft: -59 + 12 delta_t\n\nRight: -48 + 12 delta_t\n\n0 in span: -59 + 12 delta_t <= 0 <= -48 + 12 delta_t\n\nFirst: -59 + 12 delta_t <=0 => 12 delta_t <=59 => delta_t <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so <=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 12 delta_t => 12 delta_t >=48 => delta_t >=4\n\nSo delta_t=4: left=-59+48=-11, right=-48+48=0, 0 in\n\ndelta_t=3: left=-59+36=-23, right=-48+36=-12, both <0, 0 not <= right? right=-12<0, 0 > right, not <=, so no\n\ndelta_t=5: left=-59+60=1, right=-48+60=12, 1>0, 0 not >= left, no\n\nSo only at delta_t=4, t=14\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (0,-11,right,12) τ=-11, h=0, s=12\n\nAt t1, span is [-11, 0], so at delta_t=0, 0 is included? But at turn t=10, the player is at y=4, not on y=5, so we care about future turns.\n\nNow, span at t: left = τ + s delta_t = -11 + 12 delta_t\n\nRight = h + s delta_t = 0 + 12 delta_t = 12 delta_t\n\n0 in span: -11 + 12 delta_t <= 0 <= 12 delta_t\n\nFirst: -11 + 12 delta_t <=0 => 12 delta_t <=11 => delta_t <= 11/12 ≈0.916, so for delta_t=0 only? delta_t integer.\n\ndelta_t=0: left=-11, right=0, -11 <=0<=0, yes.\n\nBut at t=10, delta_t=0, but the player is not on freeway 5 at t=10, so for future, delta_t>=1.\n\nFor delta_t>=1:\n\n-11 + 12 delta_t <=0 => 12 delta_t <=11 => delta_t <=0.916, impossible for delta_t>=1.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 12 delta_t always true for delta_t>=1.\n\nBut -11 + 12 delta_t <=0 not true for delta_t>=1, since min when delta_t=1, -11+12=1>0.\n\nSo for delta_t>=1, left = -11 +12 delta_t >=1 >0 for delta_t>=1, so 0 < left, not in span.\n\nThus, only at t=10, but we start from t=10, player not on y=5, so freeway 5 is safe except possibly at t=10, but player not there.\n\nFor future, the second car on freeway 5 is at 0 only at t=10, not later.\n\nFirst car at t=14.\n\nSo freeway 5: occupied only at t=14 (from first car, since second car not at 0 after t=10)\n\nt=14 is delta_t=4.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? Cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSame as freeway 5, so occupied at t=14 (from first car, and second car only at t=10 not relevant)\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nAll freeways 5-8 have the same car setup, so each is occupied only at t=14.\n\nFreeway 5: at t=14, first car has span at delta_t=4: left=-59+48=-11, right=-48+48=0, so 0 in.\n\nSecond car not at 0 after t=10.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nBut for each, at t=14, occupied.\n\nNow, also, for freeway 4, we have occupied at t=12,13,14,22,23,24\n\nt=14 is occupied for freeway 4 as well.\n\nNow, let's summarize the occupied times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: t=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=2: t=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=3: t=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=4: t=12,13,14,22,23,24\n\n- y=5: t=14\n\n- y=6: t=14\n\n- y=7: t=14\n\n- y=8: t=14\n\ny=5 to 8 each occupied only at t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, all of y=4,5,6,7,8 are occupied? y=4 at t=14, y=5 at t=14, etc.\n\ny=4 occupied t=12,13,14,22,23,24\n\ny=5 occupied only t=14\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 only t=14.\n\nNow, player starts at y=4 at t=10.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal path might be to go up as fast as possible, but I need to avoid being on a freeway when it's occupied at that turn.\n\nSince I start at t=10 on y=4.\n\nAt t=10, y=4, is it occupied? At t=10, freeway 4: from above, for y=4, occupied at t=12,13,14,22,etc, not at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, delta_t=0.\n\nFor y=4, first car: at delta_t=0, left=-19, right=-8, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: left=17, right=28, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: left=-59, right=-48, 0 not in.\n\nSo y=4 safe at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways may have cars, but player not there.\n\nSo at t=10, player on y=4, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nEach turn, I choose action, which determines next y.\n\nI need a sequence from t=10 to some H, with y_{t1+H-1} =9? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\", and sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, but t=0 is relative to t1.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, action at time t1 + t.\n\nAnd at time t1 + H -1, position should be (0,9).\n\nSince we start at t1, and actions from t1 to t1 + H -1, total H actions, and after H actions, at time t1 + H, position is after H actions, but we need position at time t1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nAt time T, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + delta y.\n\nWe start at T=t1=10, y=4.\n\nAfter action a_{10}, y_{11} = y_10 + delta y_{10}, and so on.\n\nWe need at some time T, y_T =9, and we want minimal H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet T = t1 + k for k=0,1,2,...\n\nAt k=0, T=t1=10, y=4\n\nAfter m actions, at time t1 + m, y_{t1+m} is the position.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + m} =9 for some m, and we want the smallest such m, but with the sequence of actions.\n\nThe time when we reach y=9 is t_reach = t1 + H -1, so H is the number of turns from start to reach, including the start? Let's see.\n\nFrom the answer format: actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1, total H actions, and at time t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nSo after H actions, at time t1 + H, position is y_{t1+H}, but we need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, at time t1, before any action, position is given.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at time t1+1, position y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, positions from t1 to t1+H.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for instance, if H=1, then at time t1 +1 -1 = t1, y_{t1} should be 9, but it's 4, not 9.\n\nSo H must be at least 5, since from 4 to 9, need 5 steps up.\n\nMinimal H if no obstacles: H=5, with actions U,U,U,U,U, then at time t1+4, y=8? Let's compute.\n\nStart t=10, y=4\n\nAfter a10=U, t=11, y=5\n\nAfter a11=U, t=12, y=6\n\nAfter a12=U, t=13, y=7\n\nAfter a13=U, t=14, y=8\n\nAfter a14=U, t=15, y=9\n\nSo at t=15, y=9, which is t1 + H -1 =10 + H -1 =15, so 10 + H -1 =15, thus H=6.\n\nt1 + H -1 =15, t1=10, so 10 + H -1 =15, H-1=5, H=6.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=10 + H -1 =15? t=10 to t=15 is 6 actions? Let's index.\n\nActions: a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, action at time t1 +0 = t1\n\nt=1, action at t1+1\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, action at t1 + H -1\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1}, at time (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we need position at time t1 + H -1 to be (0,9), which is before the last action? Confusion.\n\nPosition at time T is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nAt time T, position is y_T, and we take action a_T.\n\nWe start at time t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nWe take actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter a_{t1 + H -1}, at time t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we need that at time t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nSo for example, at time t1 + H -1, y_{t1 + H -1} =9, and we are about to take action a_{t1 + H -1}, but that action might be U, D, or S, but since we are at 9, if we go U, we might go to 10, but y=9 is the top, y in [0,9], so if y=9, U would stay at 9? From the movement: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, with y in [0,9], so if y_t=9 and a_t=U, y_{t+1} = min(9+1,9)=9, similarly D to 8, etc. But the position is clamped.\n\nBut for reaching, at time t1 + H -1, y should be 9.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is a_{t1 + H -1}, which is taken at time t1 + H -1, and after that, at t1 + H, y might be different, but we care about position at t1 + H -1 being 9.\n\nSo for the minimal path with no obstacles, to go from y=4 to y=9 in 5 steps: actions U,U,U,U,U at t=10 to t=14.\n\nThen positions:\n\nt=10: y=4\n\na10=U: t=11, y=5\n\na11=U: t=12, y=6\n\na12=U: t=13, y=7\n\na13=U: t=14, y=8\n\na14=U: t=15, y=9\n\nBut at time t=15, y=9, which is t1 + 5 =15, t1=10, so t1 + m with m=5, but we need time t1 + H -1 =15, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nWith actions at t=10,11,12,13,14, that's 5 actions, from t=10 to t=14, H-1=4? Let's count.\n\nThe actions are for times t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0: action at t1\n\nt=1: action at t1+1\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: action at t1 + H -1\n\nAnd at time t1 + H -1, position should be 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with 5 actions U from t=10 to t=14:\n\nAt time t=14, position is y=8 (after a14=U, but a14 is at time 14, after which y15=9.\n\nBut at time t=14, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y at time T be 9, with T=t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at time T=15, then t1 + H -1 =15, t1=10, so 10 + H -1=15, H=6.\n\nThen actions from t=10 to t=15? t= t1 + t for t=0 to 5, since H=6, t=0 to 5, actions at t=10,11,12,13,14,15.\n\nBut at time t=15, we take action a15, but position at t=15 should be 9 before action.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of the time when we reach y=9.\n\nLet T be the time when y_T =9.\n\nThen T = t1 + H -1.\n\nH is the number of actions in the sequence, from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor minimal T, from y=4 to y=9, minimal T is t=15 with 5 ups, as above, but at t=15, y=9.\n\nT=15, so t1 + H -1 =15, H-1=5, H=6.\n\nWith actions at t=10 to t=15.\n\nBut the actions determine how we get there.\n\nSince we start at t=10, y=4, and after each action we move.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some time.\n\nMinimal time to reach y=9 is t=15 with all U, but we need to check if it's possible with the cars.\n\nWith all U: from t=10 to t=14 actions U.\n\nPositions:\n\nt=10: y=4\n\na10=U: t=11, y=5\n\na11=U: t=12, y=6\n\na12=U: t=13, y=7\n\na13=U: t=14, y=8\n\nThen at t=14, y=8, which is freeway 8.\n\nNow, freeway 8 is occupied at t=14? From above, y=8 occupied at t=14.\n\nSo at t=14, if player is on y=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12, y=6? Let's see the positions over time.\n\nt=10: y=4, safe\n\nt=11: y=5, after a10=U\n\nAt t=11, y=5, is it occupied? Freeway 5 occupied only at t=14, not at t=11. t=11 is delta_t=1, from t1=10.\n\ndelta_t = t - 10\n\nt=11, delta_t=1\n\ny=5: occupied at t=14 (delta_t=4), not at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, t=12: y=6, delta_t=2, y=6 occupied only at t=14, not at t=12.\n\nt=13: y=7, occupied only at t=14, not at t=13.\n\nt=14: y=8, occupied at t=14, collision.\n\nSo at t=14, y=8 is occupied, so if we are there, collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot go directly up because at t=14 we are on y=8 which is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if we go slower, we might hit other occupied times.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nSpecifically, for the path, we need that for each time t, if y_t = k for k=1 to 8, then freeway k is not occupied at t.\n\nNow, from the occupied times:\n\ny=1: occ at t=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: same\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: occ at t=12,13,14,22,23,24\n\ny=5: occ at t=14\n\ny=6: occ at t=14\n\ny=7: occ at t=14\n\ny=8: occ at t=14\n\nAlso, t=14 is bad for y=4,5,6,7,8 all occupied.\n\ny=4 occupied t=12,13,14, so t=14 y=4 occ, etc.\n\nTo go from y=4 to y=9, we need to pass through y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut at t=14, all of them are occupied, so we cannot be on any of them at t=14.\n\nBut we might be on y=9 at t=14, but y=9 is safe.\n\nBut to be on y=9 at t=14, we need to arrive earlier.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 by t=14.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=10, to y=9 at t=14, that would require moving up 5 steps in 4 turns? From t=10 to t=14 is 4 steps? Positions at times.\n\nAt t=10, y=4\n\nAt t=11, y=5 (after U)\n\nt=12, y=6\n\nt=13, y=7\n\nt=14, y=8 if we go U at t=13\n\nTo have y=9 at t=14, we need y=9 at time t=14.\n\nThat means at t=13, we were at y=8, and we go U to y=9 at t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, y=9 is safe.\n\nBut at t=13, we are at y=8? Let's see.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=14:\n\ny_{14} =9.\n\ny_{14} = y_{13} + delta y_{13}\n\nIf y_{13} =8, and a_{13}=U, then y_{14}=9.\n\nOr if y_{13}=9, and a_{13}=S or D, but we want to reach, so probably from 8.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=13, etc.\n\nMinimal time to reach y=9 is t=14, if we can go up faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so from y=4 at t=10, earliest y=9 is at t=15 with all U, as before.\n\nt=10: y=4\n\nAfter U: t=11: y=5\n\nU: t=12: y=6\n\nU: t=13: y=7\n\nU: t=14: y=8\n\nU: t=15: y=9\n\nSo at t=15, y=9.\n\nCannot be earlier.\n\nAt t=14, y=8 is occupied, so we cannot be on y=8 at t=14.\n\nTherefore, in the direct path, we are on y=8 at t=14, collision.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nPossibilities: either not be on y=8 at t=14, or be on a safe freeway.\n\nBut at t=14, all y=4 to 8 are occupied, so no safe freeway at t=14 for y=1-8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, but y=0 is below.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, so we can go to y=9 before t=14 or after, but earliest is t=15.\n\nAt t=15, y=9 is safe.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=15, we need to be at y=8 at t=14 or y=9 at t=14.\n\nBut y=8 at t=14 is occupied, so we cannot be at y=8 at t=14.\n\nIf we are at y=9 at t=14, that would require being at y=8 at t=13 and going U, but t=13: if y=8 at t=13, is it occupied?\n\nFreeway 8 occupied only at t=14, not at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, delta_t=3, freeway 8: for y=8, occupied only at t=14, so at t=13, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nSo if we can be at y=8 at t=13, then go U at t=13 to be at y=9 at t=14.\n\nBut at t=13, y=8 is safe, since occupied only at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, we are at y=9, safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=13, we need to arrive there.\n\nFrom start, at t=10, y=4.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=13, that means from t=10 to t=13, we need to go from y=4 to y=8, which is 4 steps in 3 turns? From t=10 to t=13, positions at t=10,11,12,13.\n\ny10=4\n\ny11: after a10, could be 3,4,5\n\ny12: after a11, etc.\n\ny13: position at time 13.\n\nTo have y13=8, since y10=4, we need net +4 in y over 3 actions (a10,a11,a12).\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, so possible to have +4 in 3 actions only if all U, but +1 each, 3 actions give +3, to y=7 at t=13? Let's see.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nAt t=10: y=4\n\na10: if U, t=11 y=5\n\na11: U, t=12 y=6\n\na12: U, t=13 y=7\n\nSo at t=13, y=7.\n\nTo have y=8 at t=13, we need to be at y=7 at t=12 and go U, or y=8 at t=12 and stay, etc.\n\nBut from above, with actions starting from t=10, after 2 actions (a10 and a11), at t=12, y could be at most 6 if both U.\n\ny10=4\n\na10=U: y11=5\n\na11=U: y12=6\n\nThen a12=U: y13=7\n\nCannot be higher than 7 at t=13.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can't, only one step per turn.\n\nSo earliest to be at y=8 is at t=14, with y13=7, a13=U, y14=8.\n\nBut at t=14, y=8 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at t=15, with y14=8, a14=U, y15=9, but y14=8 occupied at t=14.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=8 at t=14.\n\nSince we must pass through y=8 to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 at some time when it is not occupied.\n\nFreeway 8 is occupied only at t=14, so it is safe at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=13, y=8 is safe, as above.\n\nBut we cannot be at y=8 at t=13 because it takes at least 4 steps to go from y=4 to y=8.\n\nFrom t=10 to t=13: 3 actions, max y=7 at t=13.\n\nSimilarly, at t=15, y=8 could be safe, but we want to be at y=9 by then.\n\nWe need to delay or advance our position to avoid the occupied times.\n\nSpecifically, at t=14, all y=4 to 8 are occupied, so we must not be on any of them at t=14.\n\nTherefore, at t=14, we must be on y=0, y=9, or y=10 but y=10 not exist, so y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so ideally be at y=9 at t=14 or earlier, but earlier impossible, so at t=14 be at y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=14, we need y=8 at t=13 and go U.\n\nBut at t=13, y=8 is possible? As above, at t=13, y can be at most 7, so y=8 not possible at t=13.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=9 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at y=0 at t=14 unless we go down, but that might not help.\n\nSo at t=14, we must be on y=0 or y=9 to avoid collision, but y=9 not reachable, y=0 is possible but far from goal.\n\nThen we can go to y=0 at t=14, then later go up, but that will take more turns.\n\nMinimal H might be larger.\n\nWe could be on a freeway that is not occupied at that time, but at t=14, all y=1-8 are occupied, so no.\n\nThe only safe rows at t=14 are y=0 and y=9.\n\nSo player must be on y=0 or y=9 at t=14.\n\nSince we start from y=4, going to y=9 directly, we can't reach y=9 by t=14, so we must go to y=0 at t=14 or be on the way.\n\nBut let's list the safe times for each freeway.\n\nFor each y and time, when it is safe to be there.\n\ny=1: safe except t=16,17,18,19\n\nSimilarly y=2,3 same.\n\ny=4: safe except t=12,13,14,22,23,24\n\ny=5: safe except t=14\n\ny=6: safe except t=14\n\ny=7: safe except t=14\n\ny=8: safe except t=14\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, we need to go from (t=10,y=4) to (t=T,y=9) for some T.\n\nMinimal T is 15, but at t=14, for the path to y=9 at t=15, we are at y=8 at t=14, which is occupied, so impossible for direct path.\n\nSo we need T>15.\n\nNext possible T=16.\n\nAt T=16, y=9.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 =16, so 10 + H -1=16, H=7.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=15 (since t= t1 to t1+H-1=15 for H=7? Let's calculate.\n\nt1 + H -1 =16, t1=10, so 10 + H -1=16, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions at t=10 to t=16? t= t1 + k for k=0 to H-1=6, so actions at t=10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\nBut position at t=16 should be 9.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at t=16.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at t=15 or y=9 at t=15.\n\nBut at t=15, y=9 is safe, or y=8 is safe since freeway 8 occupied only at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, we need to avoid the occupied times during the path.\n\nSpecifically, at t=14, we must not be on y=1-8, so we must be on y=0 or y=9 at t=14.\n\nSince we can't be on y=9 at t=14, we must be on y=0 at t=14.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9 by t=16.\n\nFor example, at t=14, be at y=0.\n\nThen from t=10 to t=14, go from y=4 to y=0.\n\ny=4 to y=0 is 4 steps down, in 4 turns? From t=10 to t=14, positions.\n\nAt t=10: y=4\n\nAfter actions a10 to a13, at t=14 position.\n\nTo have y14=0.\n\nFor example, all D actions.\n\na10=D: t=11 y=3\n\na11=D: t=12 y=2\n\na12=D: t=13 y=1\n\na13=D: t=14 y=0\n\nNow, check if safe.\n\nt=11: y=3, freeway 3 occupied at t=16-19, not at t=11, safe.\n\nt=12: y=2, freeway 2 occupied at t=16-19, not t=12, safe.\n\nt=13: y=1, freeway 1 occupied at t=16-19, not t=13, safe.\n\nt=14: y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=14, y=0.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9 by t=16.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=14, to y=9 at t=16, that's 9 steps in 2 turns, impossible. Max we can go to y=2 at t=16.\n\ny14=0\n\na14: if U, y15=1\n\na15: U, y16=2\n\nStill at y=2, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=16, from t=14 y=0, we need at least 9 steps, but only 2 actions, can only reach y=2.\n\nImpossible.\n\nt=16 is the time for position.\n\nIf we want y16=9, then from y14=0, after a14 and a15, y16 = y15 + delta y15.\n\ny15 depends on a14.\n\nMax y15=1 if a14=U\n\nThen y16=2 if a15=U, or 1 or 0.\n\nCannot reach 9.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at t=16, we need to be closer at earlier times.\n\nFor example, at t=15, we need to be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at t=15, y=8, then a15=U, y16=9.\n\nOr if y=9 at t=15, stay or whatever.\n\nBut to have y=8 at t=15, we need to arrive there.\n\nAt t=15, y=8 is safe, since occupied only at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=15, from start.\n\nAt t=10 y=4.\n\nTo t=15, 5 turns, 5 actions to change position.\n\nNet change +4 to y=8.\n\nPossible with 4U and 1S, for example.\n\nBut we need to avoid occupied times.\n\nFirst, at t=14, we must not be on y=1-8, so must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince y=9 not reachable, must be on y=0 at t=14.\n\nSo at t=14, y=0.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=14, to y=8 at t=15, we need to go up 8 steps in one action, impossible. Max +1 per turn.\n\nSo at t=15, from y=0 at t=14, after a14, y15 <=1.\n\nThen at t=16, y16 <=2.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at t=16, we need to be at least at y=7 at t=15 to go U twice, but from y=0 at t=14, y15<=1, y16<=2.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by t=16.\n\nTherefore, we need a later time.\n\nLet's aim for t=17 or later.\n\nFirst, let's list the constraints.\n\nAt t=14, player must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince y=9 not possible, must be on y=0 at t=14.\n\nThen from t=10 to t=14, we go from y=4 to y=0.\n\nAs in the down path: a10=D, a11=D, a12=D, a13=D, then t=11 y=3, t=12 y=2, t=13 y=1, t=14 y=0, all safe as before.\n\nThen at t=14, y=0.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 at some later time.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=14, go up to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: 9 steps up, but we can go up each turn, but need to avoid cars on the way.\n\nFreeways occupied at certain times.\n\nFor example, to go up from y=0.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nThen to y=1, freeway 1 occupied at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3.\n\nAt t=14, we are at y=0.\n\nTake action a14.\n\nSuppose a14=U, then at t=15, y=1.\n\nNow, at t=15, y=1, is it occupied? Freeway 1 occupied at t=16-19, not at t=15, so safe.\n\nThen a15=U, t=16, y=2.\n\nAt t=16, y=2, freeway 2 occupied at t=16,17,18,19, so at t=16, occupied, collision.\n\nIf we go to y=2 at t=16, occupied.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=2 at t=16.\n\nSimilarly for y=1,3 same occupied at t=16-19.\n\nSo at t=16, we must not be on y=1,2,3.\n\nAlso, y=4 occupied at t=12,13,14,22,23,24, so at t=16, not occupied, safe.\n\ny=5 occupied only t=14, safe at t=16.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 safe at t=16.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut y=1,2,3 occupied at t=16.\n\nSo at t=16, to be safe, we must be on y=0,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNot on y=1,2,3.\n\nNow, from t=14 y=0, we can choose to go up or stay.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nOne way: at t=14 y=0, we can stay or go up.\n\nIf we go up to y=1 at t=15, then at t=16, if we go to y=2, occupied, or stay at y=1, but y=1 occupied at t=16, or go down to y=0.\n\nBut going down not helpful.\n\nSo better to delay going up or something.\n\nAt t=14 y=0, we can stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nFor example, at t=14, action S, stay at y=0, t=15 y=0.\n\nThen at t=15, y=0, safe.\n\nNow at t=16, we need to be not on y=1,2,3.\n\nSo if we go to y=1 at t=16, occupied, so we should not go to y=1 at t=16.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=15, action a15.\n\nIf a15=U, t=16 y=1, occupied, collision.\n\nIf a15=S, t=16 y=0, safe.\n\nIf a15=D, t=16 y=0, since y=0, D to 0.\n\nSo to avoid collision, at t=16, we can be at y=0 by staying or going down.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nThe occupation for y=1,2,3 is only at t=16-19, so after t=19, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4, occupied at t=22-24, but that might be later.\n\nSo we can wait at y=0 until after t=19, then go up.\n\nBut that would take many turns.\n\nSince y=4,5,6,7,8 are safe at t=16, we can go directly to those from y=0, but we are at y=0, to go to y=4, we need to pass through y=1,2,3, which at t=16 are occupied.\n\nFor example, at t=15, from y=0, if we go U to y=1 at t=16, but t=16 y=1 occupied.\n\nIf at t=15 we stay at y=0, then at t=16, we can go U to y=1, but occupied, or stay, or go D.\n\nBut we can't go directly to higher y.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=1 at a time when it is safe, but y=1 is only safe before t=16 or after t=19.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor example, at t=15, y=1 is safe, as above.\n\nBut at t=16, it is occupied.\n\nSo if we are at y=1 at t=15, we can go to y=2 at t=16, but y=2 occupied at t=16, collision.\n\nOr stay at y=1, occupied.\n\nOr go down to y=0.\n\nSo no good.\n\nTherefore, to avoid being on y=1,2,3 at t=16,17,18,19, we should not be on those rows during those times.\n\nSo for the up path from y=0, we should be above y=3 by t=16 or below y=1, but below not helpful.\n\nBy t=16, be on y>=4.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=14, to y>=4 at t=16, that requires at least +4 in two actions, impossible.\n\nMax +2, to y=2 at t=16.\n\nCannot reach y=4 by t=16.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to stay at y=0 until after the occupied period for y=1,2,3, which ends at t=19.\n\nSo at t=19, last occupied for y=1,2,3.\n\nThen at t=20, it is safe to be on them.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 occupied at t=22-24, so we need to be past y=4 before t=22 or after, but since we go up, better before.\n\nLet's plan the path from t=14 y=0.\n\nWe stay at y=0 for some turns to avoid the bad times.\n\nAt t=14: y=0\n\nTo avoid being on y=1,2,3 during t=16-19, we can:\n\n- Stay at y=0 until t=20, then go up.\n\nOr go up before t=16 but be on y=1,2,3 only when safe, but they are only safe at t<=15 or t>=20.\n\nt=15 is safe for y=1,2,3.\n\nFor example, at t=15, we can be on y=1,2,3 safe.\n\nThen at t=16, we need to not be on them, so we must be on y=0 or y>=4 by t=16.\n\nBut from t=15, if on y=1,2,3, to be on y>=4 at t=16, need to go up, but from y=3, U to y=4 at t=16, possible.\n\ny=4 at t=16 is safe, as occupied only at t=12,13,14,22,etc, not at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7,8 safe at t=16.\n\nSo possible.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=3 at t=15, go U to y=4 at t=16.\n\nOr from y=2 at t=15, go U to y=3 at t=16, but y=3 occupied at t=16, not good.\n\nMust go directly to y>=4.\n\nSo from t=15, if we are on y=3, we can go U to y=4 at t=16.\n\nIf on y=2, we can go U to y=3, but occupied, or stay, occupied, or down to y=1 or 0, but y=1,2,3 all occupied at t=16.\n\nSo only if we are at y=3 at t=15, we can go U to y=4 at t=16, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=1 or 2 at t=15, we cannot avoid collision at t=16 if we go up, or if we stay or down, we are on occupied row.\n\nSo to be safe, we must be at y=3 at t=15, then go U to y=4 at t=16.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut we are at t=14 y=0.\n\nFrom t=14 y=0 to t=15.\n\nAt t=15, we need to be at y=3.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=14, after a14, y15 <=1, cannot be at y=3 at t=15.\n\nImpossible.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to stay at y=0 during the dangerous period t=16-19 for y=1,2,3.\n\nSo at t=14 y=0.\n\nWe take actions to stay at y=0 or move down, but down not necessary.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=14: y=0, action S or D, stay at y=0, t=15 y=0\n\nSimilarly, at t=15: action S or D, t=16 y=0\n\nAt t=16: y=0, safe, since not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly, t=17: y=0\n\nt=18: y=0\n\nt=19: y=0\n\nAll safe at y=0.\n\nThen at t=20, we can start going up.\n\nAt t=20, y=0, action U, t=21 y=1\n\nAt t=21, y=1, is it safe? Freeway 1 occupied at t=16-19, not at t=21, so safe.\n\nAction U, t=22 y=2\n\nAt t=22, y=2, freeway 2 occupied at t=16-19, not t=22, safe.\n\nBut y=4 is occupied at t=22,23,24.\n\nAt t=22, y=2, not on y=4, so safe.\n\nAction U, t=23 y=3\n\nAt t=23, y=3, freeway 3 occupied at t=16-19, not t=23, safe.\n\nAction U, t=24 y=4\n\nAt t=24, y=4, but freeway 4 occupied at t=22,23,24, so at t=24, occupied, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=24, y=4 occupied.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=4 at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, we need to avoid that.\n\nFrom above, at t=23 y=3, we go U to y=4 at t=24, occupied.\n\nInstead, at t=23, from y=3, we can stay or go down, but not helpful.\n\nOr go up later.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to go through y=4.\n\ny=4 occupied at t=22,23,24, so we should not be on y=4 during those times.\n\nSo be on y=4 before t=22 or after t=24.\n\nAfter t=24, it is safe.\n\nFor example, at t=25, y=4 safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can delay going to y=4.\n\nFrom the up path.\n\nAt t=20: y=0\n\na20=U: t=21 y=1\n\na21=U: t=22 y=2\n\nAt t=22, y=2, safe.\n\nBut if we go U to y=3 at t=23, then to y=4 at t=24, occupied.\n\nSo at t=22, from y=2, instead of going U, we can stay at y=2 for some turns.\n\ny=2 is safe except at t=16-19, which is past, so at t=22, safe.\n\nWe can stay at y=2 until after t=24.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=22: y=2, action S, t=23 y=2\n\nt=23: y=2, action S, t=24 y=2\n\nt=24: y=2, safe, since not occupied.\n\nThen at t=24, action U, t=25 y=3\n\nt=25: y=3, action U, t=26 y=4\n\nAt t=26, y=4, now freeway 4 occupied at t=22,23,24, not at t=26, so safe.\n\nThen continue up.\n\na26=U: t=27 y=5\n\ny=5 safe at all times except t=14, which is past.\n\na27=U: t=28 y=6\n\ny=6 safe except t=14.\n\na28=U: t=29 y=7\n\ny=7 safe except t=14.\n\na29=U: t=30 y=8\n\ny=8 safe except t=14.\n\na30=U: t=31 y=9\n\nNow at t=31, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, we need to connect from the beginning.\n\nFirst, from start to t=14 at y=0.\n\nAs before: at t=10: y=4\n\na10=D: t=11 y=3\n\na11=D: t=12 y=2\n\na12=D: t=13 y=1\n\na13=D: t=14 y=0\n\nAll safe.\n\nThen from t=14 to t=20, we stay at y=0.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need actions.\n\nAt t=14: y=0, we can action S or D, but since y=0, D keeps at 0, S keeps at 0.\n\nSimilarly, to stay, we can do S or D.\n\nBut to minimize actions, we should go up as soon as possible, but we have to wait.\n\nIn this case, from t=14 to t=20, we need to stay at y=0 for turns t=15,16,17,18,19.\n\nAt t=14: we are at y=0, after arriving from down.\n\nNow, actions from t=14 to t=19 to stay at y=0.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=14: position y=0, action a14: if S, y15=0\n\na15: S, y16=0\n\na16: S, y17=0\n\na17: S, y18=0\n\na18: S, y19=0\n\nThen at t=19, y=0.\n\nThen at t=19, action U, t=20 y=1\n\nBut earlier we planned to start up at t=20 from y=0.\n\nAt t=19, y=0, a19=U, t=20 y=1\n\nThen a20=U, t=21 y=2\n\nBut at t=20, y=1, which is freeway 1, occupied only at t=16-19, t=20 is after, so safe? t=20 >19, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=21 y=2 safe.\n\nThen at t=21, y=2, a21=U, t=22 y=3\n\nt=22: y=3, but we need to avoid going to y=4 at bad times.\n\nIn this path, at t=22, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a22=U, t=23 y=4\n\nBut at t=23, y=4, occupied? Freeway 4 occupied at t=22,23,24.\n\nt=23 occupied, collision.\n\nMistake.\n\nAt t=22, y=3, if we go U to y=4 at t=23, occupied.\n\nSo need to stay or something.\n\nAt t=22, y=3? From above, t=22 y=3 after a22=U? Let's list positions.\n\nt=19: y=0 (after a19 action? Let's define.\n\nFrom the down path:\n\nt=13: y=1 (after a13=D from y=1 at t=13? Positions:\n\nt=10: y=4\n\na10=D: t=11 y=3\n\na11=D: t=12 y=2\n\na12=D: t=13 y=1\n\na13=D: t=14 y=0\n\nThen at t=14, y=0\n\nNow actions to stay:\n\na14=S: t=15 y=0\n\na15=S: t=16 y=0\n\na16=S: t=17 y=0\n\na17=S: t=18 y=0\n\na18=S: t=19 y=0\n\nThen a19=U: t=20 y=1\n\na20=U: t=21 y=2\n\na21=U: t=22 y=3\n\nAt t=22, y=3\n\nNow, if a22=U, t=23 y=4, but t=23, y=4 occupied.\n\nInstead, at t=22, y=3, we can action S to stay at y=3 for t=23.\n\na22=S: t=23 y=3\n\nAt t=23, y=3, freeway 3 occupied only at t=16-19, not t=23, safe.\n\nThen at t=23, action S again, t=24 y=3\n\nOr go U.\n\nBut y=4 occupied at t=24.\n\nSo at t=23, if we go U, t=24 y=4, occupied.\n\nSo we should stay at y=3 until after t=24.\n\nFor example:\n\na22=S: t=23 y=3\n\na23=S: t=24 y=3  (safe, since y=3 not occupied)\n\nThen at t=24, action U, t=25 y=4\n\nNow t=25, y=4, freeway 4 not occupied (only at 12-14 and 22-24), t=25>24, safe.\n\nThen continue:\n\na24=U: t=25 y=4? a24 at t=24, action, to y at t=25.\n\nt=24: position y=3 (after a23=S)\n\na24=U: t=25 y=4\n\nYes.\n\nThen a25=U: t=26 y=5\n\na26=U: t=27 y=6\n\na27=U: t=28 y=7\n\na28=U: t=29 y=8\n\na29=U: t=30 y=9\n\nAt t=30, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, we need to reach at time t=30.\n\nt1 + H -1 =30, t1=10, so 10 + H -1 =30, H-1=20, H=21.\n\nBut we can optimize to reduce turns.\n\nIn the above, we stayed at y=0 from t=14 to t=19, that's 6 turns at y=0 (t=14 to 19), but we only need to avoid being on y=1,2,3 during t=16-19, so we can go up earlier to y=3 before t=16.\n\nFor example, at t=15, we can be at y=3, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, at t=16, go to y=4, safe.\n\nBut how to be at y=3 at t=15.\n\nFrom t=14 y=0, we can only reach y=1 at t=15.\n\nCannot reach y=3.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nWe can go up to y=3 during the safe period before.\n\nAt t=14 y=0.\n\nt=14 is after the y=1,2,3 occupation? Occupation for y=1,2,3 is t=16-19, so at t=14 and t=15, it is safe to be on them.\n\nFor example, at t=14 y=0, action U, t=15 y=1 (safe)\n\nThen at t=15 y=1, action U, t=16 y=2, but at t=16, y=2 occupied, collision.\n\nIf at t=15, we go to y=2, but from y=1 at t=15, action U to y=2 at t=16, occupied.\n\nOr action S to y=1 at t=16, occupied.\n\nOr action D to y=0 at t=16, safe.\n\nBut then we are back to y=0.\n\nNo progress.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=1,2,3 at t=16-19, so we must be off them during that time, either below or above.\n\nSince we are at y=0 at t=14, we can only be at y=0 or y=1 at t=15, and at t=16, if on y=1, occupied, so we must be at y=0 at t=16, which means at t=15, we must be at y=0 or y=1 and go down or stay to y=0.\n\nBut to reach higher, we need to wait until after t=19.\n\nSo the waiting at y=0 is necessary.\n\nTo save time, we can go up to y=3 as soon as possible after t=19.\n\nIn the path above, we started going up at t=19 from y=0.\n\nBut at t=19, if we go U to y=1 at t=20.\n\nThen to y=2 at t=21, y=3 at t=22.\n\nBut at t=22, y=3, then to y=4 at t=23, but y=4 occupied at t=23.\n\nSo we stayed at y=3 during t=23 and t=24 to avoid.\n\nBut we can go directly from y=3 to y=5 or something, but no, must go step by step.\n\nAnother idea: after t=19, go up fast to pass y=4 before t=22 or after t=24.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=19, to y=4 at t=20 impossible.\n\nt=19 y=0\n\na19=U: t=20 y=1\n\na20=U: t=21 y=2\n\na21=U: t=22 y=3\n\na22=U: t=23 y=4  occupied\n\nIf we go slower, worse.\n\nSo we need to delay reaching y=4 until after t=24.\n\nThus, at t=22, we are at y=3, and we stay there until t=24, then go to y=4 at t=25.\n\nAs in the earlier path.\n\nNow, from y=4 at t=25, go up to y=9.\n\nt=25 y=4\n\na25=U: t=26 y=5\n\na26=U: t=27 y=6\n\na27=U: t=28 y=7\n\na28=U: t=29 y=8\n\na29=U: t=30 y=9\n\nAt t=30, y=9.\n\nTotal from start: from t=10 to t=30, 20 turns, H such that t1 + H -1 =30, 10 + H -1=30, H=21.\n\nBut we can reduce by not staying so long at y=0.\n\nFor example, at t=14 y=0, we can go up to y=1 at t=15, but then at t=16, we must go down to y=0 to avoid, but that wastes turns.\n\nFor instance:\n\nt=14 y=0, a14=U: t=15 y=1\n\nThen at t=15 y=1, to avoid t=16, we can a15=D: t=16 y=0\n\nThen at t=16 y=0, a16=S: t=17 y=0\n\na17=S: t=18 y=0\n\na18=S: t=19 y=0\n\nThen same as before, start up at t=19.\n\nBut we used an extra U and D, which cancels, but we are at same point as staying at t=14 to t=15.\n\nIn terms of position, at t=16 we are back to y=0, same as if we stayed.\n\nBut we have extra actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=0 from t=14 to t=19.\n\nAt t=19, we are at y=0, and we go up.\n\nIn the up path, from t=20 to t=22 we go to y=3, then stay at y=3 for t=23 and t=24, then to y=4 at t=25.\n\nBut at t=22, y=3, we can go to y=4 later.\n\nSince y=4 is occupied from t=22 to 24, we can be on y=4 at t=25.\n\nSimilarly, we can go directly from y=3 to y=4 after t=24.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 faster, after passing y=4, no more obstacles, so we can go straight up.\n\nBut we have to wait at y=3 for two turns.\n\nIs there a way to avoid that?\n\nFor example, if we reach y=4 before t=22.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=19, to y=4 at t=20 impossible.\n\nt=19 y=0\n\nt=20 y=1\n\nt=21 y=2\n\nt=22 y=3\n\nCannot be at y=4 before t=23.\n\nAnd t=23 y=4 occupied.\n\nSo must be at y=4 at t=25 or later.\n\nThus, the path is fixed.\n\nNow, back to the beginning, we have the down path to y=0 at t=14.\n\nThen stay at y=0 from t=14 to t=19.\n\nt=14 to t=19 is positions y=0 at times t=14,15,16,17,18,19? Let's list times.\n\nAt t=14, position y=0 (after down)\n\nThen actions at t=14,15,16,17,18 to stay, so:\n\nAction at t=14: S or D, result y=0 at t=15\n\nAction at t=15: S or D, y=0 at t=16\n\nAction at t=16: S or D, y=0 at t=17\n\nAction at t=17: S or D, y=0 at t=18\n\nAction at t=18: S or D, y=0 at t=19\n\nAt t=19, position y=0.\n\nThen action at t=19: U, so y=1 at t=20\n\nAction at t=20: U, y=2 at t=21\n\nAction at t=21: U, y=3 at t=22\n\nNow at t=22, position y=3\n\nAction at t=22: S (stay), so y=3 at t=23\n\nAction at t=23: S, y=3 at t=24\n\nAction at t=24: U, y=4 at t=25\n\nAction at t=25: U, y=5 at t=26\n\nAction at t=26: U, y=6 at t=27\n\nAction at t=27: U, y=7 at t=28\n\nAction at t=28: U, y=8 at t=29\n\nAction at t=29: U, y=9 at t=30\n\nAt t=30, y=9, which is the goal time.\n\nNow, the actions are from t=10 to t=29, since at t=29 we take action to go to y=9 at t=30.\n\nTime when position is 9 is t=30.\n\nt1 + H -1 =30, t1=10, so 10 + H -1 =30, H-1=20, H=21.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=10 + 20 = t=30? Let's see the indices.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_t for t = t1 to t1 + H -1}\n\nH=21, so actions from t=10 to t=10+20=30? t1 + H -1 =10 + 21 -1=30, so actions at t=10,11,12,...,30.\n\nBut at t=30, we take action a30, but position at t=30 is after a30? Confusion.\n\nPosition at time T is before action a_T.\n\nAt time T, position y_T, then we take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + delta y.\n\nIn this case, at time t=30, we want y_30 =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=30, y=9, and we take action a30, which could be S, U, or D, but since we are at goal, we can choose S.\n\nBut the position at t=30 is 9.\n\nIn the action sequence, actions from t=10 to t=29 are taken to reach y=9 at t=30.\n\nt=30 = t1 + H -1 with H=21.\n\nActions: a10 to a29, that's 20 actions? t from 10 to 29 inclusive is 20 actions.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=10 to t=29, that's 20 actions.\n\nH should be the number, so for H=21, actions from t=10 to t=10+20=30? t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=10, t1+H-1=30, so H-1=20, H=21, actions at t=10,11,12,...,30.\n\nBut at t=30, we need to take action, but position at t=30 should be 9, so we must have reached at t=30 before action.\n\nIn the sequence, with actions up to a29, we have y30=9.\n\nThen at t=30, we take action a30, but since position is already 9, a30 can be anything, but to stay, we can set S.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to list actions until we reach, so probably a30 is not needed if we reach at t=30.\n\nThe sequence is until the action that makes us reach, but in the format, we list actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and at time t1+H-1 position is 9.\n\nIn this case, with actions a10 to a29, we have at time t=30 position y30=9.\n\nt=30 = t1 + 20, so t1 + H -1 = t1 + 20, thus H-1=20, H=21.\n\nThen actions from t=10 to t=30, but at t=30, we need an action, but y30=9 is before a30, so a30 is taken after.\n\nBut to have position at t=30 be 9, we don't need a30 for that.\n\nFor example, in the minimal path, with all U from t=10 to t=14, y15=9, so at time t=15, position is 9, which is t1 + H -1 with H=6, t1+5=15.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=14, 5 actions.\n\nHere, at t=30, position is 9, which is t1 + 20, since t1=10, t=30=10+20.\n\nSo t1 + H -1 =10 + H -1 =30, so H-1=20, H=21.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=10 + 20 = t=30? t1 + (H-1) =10 + 20=30, so actions at t=10,11,12,...,30.\n\nThat's 21 actions.\n\nBut at t=30, if we take action, it changes y31, but we don't care, since we reached at t=30.\n\nIn the sequence, we can include a30, set to S or U, but since y=9, U stays.\n\nBut the position at t=30 is 9, so it's fine.\n\nTo save one action, but we need to reach at t=30.\n\nIn the path, we have actions from a10 to a29 to reach y30=9.\n\nThen a30 is extra, but we have to list it.\n\nIn the sequence, for a29: at t=29, position y29=8, a29=U, y30=9.\n\nThen at t=30, position y30=9, so we reached at t=30.\n\nAction a30 is at t=30, but not needed for reaching, but in the sequence, since we list actions from t=10 to t=30 for H=21, a30 must be included.\n\nWe can set a30 to S.\n\nSimilarly, in the stay parts, we used S actions.\n\nNow, let's list all actions.\n\nFirst, from t=10 to t=13: down to y=0.\n\nt=10: action D\n\nt=11: action D\n\nt=12: action D\n\nt=13: action D\n\nThen t=14 to t=18: stay at y=0, so actions S or D, let's use S.\n\nt=14: S\n\nt=15: S\n\nt=16: S\n\nt=17: S\n\nt=18: S\n\nAt t=19: position y=0, action U\n\nt=20: action U\n\nt=21: action U\n\nt=22: action S (stay at y=3 for t=23)\n\nt=23: action S (stay for t=24)\n\nt=24: action U (to y=4 at t=25)\n\nt=25: U\n\nt=26: U\n\nt=27: U\n\nt=28: U\n\nt=29: U\n\nThen at t=30, y=9.\n\nNow action at t=30: since position is 9, we can set a30=S, but it's not necessary, but for the sequence, we need to list up to t=30.\n\nThe time when position is 9 is t=30, which is t1 + H -1=30, so H=21.\n\nActions: from t=10 to t=30.\n\na30: at t=30, y=9, we can do S.\n\nNow, but we can reduce the stay at y=0.\n\nNotice that at t=19, we are at y=0, and we go U to y=1 at t=20.\n\nBut t=19 is safe for y=1,2,3, so at t=19, from y=0, we can go U to y=1 at t=20? At t=19, action U, y20=1.\n\nt=19: position y=0, action U, so y20=1.\n\nThen at t=20, y=1, which is safe, since t=20>19.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nSimilarly, earlier at t=18, we are at y=0.\n\nAt t=18, if we go U, y19=1.\n\nt=19 y=1, which is safe? t=19, y=1, freeway 1 occupied at t=16-19, so at t=19, occupied, collision.\n\nt=19 is included in occupied, so we cannot be on y=1 at t=19.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3.\n\nSo at t=19, we must not be on y=1,2,3.\n\nThus, at t=19, we must be on y=0 or y>=4.\n\nBut from below, only y=0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at t=19.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go up at t=18 or t=19.\n\nMust stay at y=0 until t=19.\n\nThen at t=19, action, but at t=19 position y=0, action to go to y=1 at t=20.\n\nSo in the sequence, at t=19 action U.\n\nNow, back to the answer.\n\nWe need the minimal H.\n\nIn this path, H=21.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier by not going all the way down.\n\nFor example, start from y=4 at t=10.\n\nInstead of going down to y=0, we can go to a safe row at t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, all y=1-8 occupied, so only y=0 or y=9 safe.\n\ny=9 not reachable, so must go to y=0.\n\nNo choice.\n\nPerhaps go up to y=9 later but with fewer waits.\n\nBut I think H=21 is the minimal in this case.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=9 at t=14 by some path, but impossible.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 10: D  (to y=3 at t=11)\n\nIn the answer, list action at each turn.\n\nTurn t: a_t\n\nTurn 10: D  (after action, y11=3)\n\nTurn 11: D  (y12=2)\n\nTurn 12: D  (y13=1)\n\nTurn 13: D  (y14=0)\n\nTurn 14: S  (y15=0)\n\nTurn 15: S  (y16=0)\n\nTurn 16: S  (y17=0)\n\nTurn 17: S  (y18=0)\n\nTurn 18: S  (y19=0)\n\nTurn 19: U  (y20=1)\n\nTurn 20: U  (y21=2)\n\nTurn 21: U  (y22=3)\n\nTurn 22: S  (y23=3)\n\nTurn 23: S  (y24=3)\n\nTurn 24: U  (y25=4)\n\nTurn 25: U  (y26=5)\n\nTurn 26: U  (y27=6)\n\nTurn 27: U  (y28=7)\n\nTurn 28: U  (y29=8)\n\nTurn 29: U  (y30=9)\n\nNow, at time t=30, y=9, so we reached.\n\nH=20? Actions from t=10 to t=29, that's 20 actions.\n\nt=10 to t=29 inclusive: 20 turns.\n\nt1 + H -1 =30, t1=10, so 10 + H -1 =30, H-1=20, H=21.\n\nThus, we need actions up to t=30.\n\nAt t=30, position y=9, we take action a30, which can be S, for example.\n\nSo add:\n\nTurn 30: S\n\nBut since we reached at t=30, and action at t=30 is after, but in the sequence, it must be included for H=21.\n\nIn the minimal sequence, we can have H smaller if we reach earlier, but we can't.\n\nAnother point: at the end, when we go up from y=4 to y=9, it takes 5 turns, from t=25 to t=29 actions to reach y=9 at t=30.\n\nt=25 y=4, a25=U t=26 y=5, ..., a29=U t=30 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the stay at y=3, we used two S at t=22 and t=23.\n\nBut at t=24, we go U to y=4 at t=25.\n\nt=24 action U, y25=4.\n\nPosition at t=24 is y=3 (from a23=S).\n\nAll good.\n\nI think this is minimal.\n\nSo H=21.\n\nNow, for the answer, list actions from turn 10 to turn 30.\n\nBut turn 30 is t1 + H -1 =30.\n\nH=21.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: S\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: S  (since at y=9, stay)\n\nIn the sequence, turn 30 action is listed, but position at turn 30 is 9 before action.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reduce.\n\nNotice that from turn 19 to turn 21, we go U,U,U to y=3 at t=22.\n\nThen stay at t=22 and t=23, then U at t=24 to y=4 at t=25.\n\nBut at t=24, we go to y=4, which is after the occupation.\n\nSince y=4 is occupied only up to t=24, at t=24 it is occupied, so we must not be on y=4 at t=24.\n\nIn the path, at t=24, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=24, we go U to y=4 at t=25, which is safe.\n\nIf we could go to y=4 at t=25 directly, but no.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H is 21.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 21. This sequence ensures the player is at (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10 + 21 - 1 = 30\\).\n\nThe actions are designed to:\n- Move down to \\(y = 0\\) by turn 14 to avoid the dangerous period at \\(t = 14\\) where all freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are occupied.\n- Stay at \\(y = 0\\) from turns 14 to 18 to avoid the occupation of freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\) at turns 16 to 19.\n- Move up to \\(y = 3\\) by turn 22.\n- Stay at \\(y = 3\\) from turns 22 to 23 to avoid the occupation of freeway \\(y = 4\\) at turns 22 to 24.\n- Move up from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\) from turns 25 to 29, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 30.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{10 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{20}\\) (for \\(H = 21\\)) is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: D \\\\\nTurn 11: D \\\\\nTurn 12: D \\\\\nTurn 13: D \\\\\nTurn 14: S \\\\\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: S \\\\\nTurn 17: S \\\\\nTurn 18: S \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: S \\\\\nTurn 23: S \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: S\n}\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H\\) while ensuring no collisions:\n- At \\(t = 14\\), the player is at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding occupation on \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- From \\(t = 16\\) to \\(t = 19\\), staying at \\(y = 0\\) avoids occupation on \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\).\n- At \\(t = 22\\) and \\(t = 23\\), staying at \\(y = 3\\) avoids occupation on \\(y = 4\\).\n- From \\(t = 25\\) onwards, moving up to \\(y = 9\\) is safe as no occupations conflict.\n- At \\(t = 30\\), \\(y = 9\\) is reached and the action is \"S\" to stay, confirming the position.",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T they are still on y_T. So at turn T, we check the car on freeway y_T. Only when the player stays on the same freeway for consecutive turns, they are on that freeway for multiple turns.\n\nThe car update:\nFor a car on freeway i (which is fixed) and at turn t1 we are given its state: (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\nFor left-moving: the car moves to the left. The span at t1 is [h, τ] (with h > τ because it's moving left? Actually, the problem says: left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nBut note: in the example for freeway 4 we have: (-4, -15, right, 4) -> but wait, the direction is right? Actually, the table has both left and right.\n\nWait, the table says \"direction d\": for left-moving, we use the update for left, and for right-moving, for right.\n\nBut in the table, we have:\nFreeway 1: (-15, -26, right, 3) -> but note: for right-moving, the update is: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. However, the initial span is given as (head, tail). The problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning that the tail is at τ and head at h? But in the data, it's given as (head, tail). So we must interpret.\n\nLooking at the update rule for right-moving: \n  Initially: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut the input is: (head, tail, direction, speed). So what is head and tail? The problem says for right-moving: the span is [τ, h] meaning from tail to head, and since it's moving right, the tail is the leftmost and head is the rightmost? Actually, the update rule for right-moving: the entire car moves right, so the tail (left end) moves from τ to τ + s*(T-t1) and the head (right end) moves from h to h + s*(T-t1). So the initial span at t1 is [τ, h] (with τ <= h).\n\nBut in the data for freeway 1: (-15, -26, right, 3). Here, head = -15, tail = -26? But -26 is less than -15, so if we form [tail, head] we get [-26, -15]. But the update rule for right-moving uses [τ, h] and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So we can interpret the given (head, tail) as (h, τ) and then for right-moving, the span at t1 is [τ, h] (so we must use the tail as the left end and head as the right end). However, in this example, tail = -26 and head = -15, so [τ, h] = [-26, -15]. Then at time T, the car is at [ -26 + 3*(T-11), -15 + 3*(T-11) ].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the update rule uses [h, τ] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. But note: in the update rule, the span at t1 is [h, τ] and then moves left. However, if h and τ are given, and if the car is moving left, then typically we have h > τ? Actually, the example doesn't have left-moving cars? Let's see the data:\n\nAll the cars in the current state are right-moving? Actually, freeway 4 has three cars: \n  (-4, -15, right, 4) -> [tail, head] = [-15, -4]? But wait, the input is (head, tail) = (-4, -15). So for right-moving, we use tail = -15, head = -4? Then the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-15, -4]. Then at T: [ -15 + 4*(T-11), -4 + 4*(T-11) ]\n\nBut wait: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So we must know which is tail and which is head. The input gives (head, tail). So:\n\n- For right-moving: the head is the rightmost end, the tail is the leftmost. So the span is [tail, head]. Therefore, given (head, tail) we form the span as [tail, head] (if tail <= head) but in the example: (-4, -15) -> head=-4, tail=-15 -> so tail < head, so span = [-15, -4]. Then at T: [-15 + 4*(T-11), -4 + 4*(T-11)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the problem says the span at t1 is [h, τ] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So we must interpret: in the input, (head, tail) for left-moving: head is the leftmost? and tail is the rightmost? Because as the car moves left, the leftmost (head) moves left and the rightmost (tail) moves left. But the problem says: left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if h is the leftmost and τ is the rightmost, then we must have h <= τ? Actually, in the example there are no left-moving cars.\n\nBut note: in the data for freeway 4 we have three cars, all with direction 'right'. Similarly, freeways 5-8 have two cars each, all right.\n\nSo all cars are moving right. Therefore, for each car on a freeway, we have:\n\n  (head, tail, 'right', speed) -> the initial span at t1=11 is [tail, head] (because tail is the leftmost, head the rightmost) and then at time T (>=11), the span is:\n      left_end = tail + s*(T-11)\n      right_end = head + s*(T-11)\n\nCollision at freeway k at time T if the player is at (0, k) and there is a car on freeway k such that:\n      left_end <= 0 <= right_end\n\nBut note: the player is only at freeway k at time T if at that turn the player is on row k. And the player moves at the end of the turn? Actually, the update for the player: \n      at turn t, the player chooses an action, then the position at time t+1 is updated.\n\nBut the collision condition is checked at turn T: meaning at the moment the player is at row y_T at turn T. How is the turn defined?\n\nThe problem says: \n  - Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at the beginning of turn t, the player is at y_t. Then they choose an action, and then at the end of the turn they are at y_{t+1}. But the collision is checked during the turn? \n\nThe note clarifies: \n  \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) for that freeway but not in Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T. Therefore, we only check the cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nTherefore, the plan:\n\nWe start at turn 11 at row 3. We want to get to row 9. The actions are U (up: +1), D (down: -1), S (stay: 0). We can only change row by at most 1 per turn. We must avoid being at a row k (from 1 to 8) at any turn T (>=11) if there is a car on that row k at time T that covers x=0.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions from turn 11 to turn 11+H-1 such that at turn 11+H-1 we are at row 9.\n\nNote: we start at row 3 at turn 11. So at turn 11, we are at row 3. Then we choose an action for turn 11, which will lead to row y12 = y11 + Δy11. Then at turn 12, we are at row y12, and so on.\n\nWe must check for each turn T (starting from 11) and for the row we are at at that turn, whether there is a car on that row at time T that covers 0.\n\nLet's list the freeways that have cars and compute the car spans at any time T (with T>=11).\n\nWe'll denote time t = T - 11, so at T=11, t=0; at T=12, t=1, etc.\n\nFor each freeway k, we have a list of cars. For each car, we have (tail, head, speed) since direction is always right.\n\nBut note: the input gives (head, tail) and then we use tail as left end and head as right end? Actually, as above: for a car with (head, tail) and direction right, the initial span (at T=11) is [tail, head]. Then at time T (relative to 11: t = T-11), the span is:\n  left_end = tail + s * (T-11) = tail + s * t\n  right_end = head + s * t\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in [left_end, right_end] at the time T when the player is on that freeway.\n\nNow, let's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=-15, tail=-26, speed=3) -> at T=11: span = [-26, -15]. Then at time t (t=T-11): [-26 + 3t, -15 + 3t]\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: [-26+3t, -15+3t]\nFreeway 3: same: [-26+3t, -15+3t]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n  Car1: (head=-4, tail=-15, speed=4) -> at T=11: [-15, -4] -> at t: [-15+4t, -4+4t]\n  Car2: (head=32, tail=21, speed=4) -> wait, the input says: (32,21,right,4). But note: head=32, tail=21? Then the span at T=11 is [21, 32]? Then at t: [21+4t, 32+4t]\n  Car3: (head=-44, tail=-55, speed=4) -> at T=11: [-55, -44] -> at t: [-55+4t, -44+4t]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n  Car1: (head=-36, tail=-47, speed=12) -> at T=11: [-47, -36] -> at t: [-47+12t, -36+12t]\n  Car2: (head=12, tail=1, speed=12) -> at T=11: [1,12] -> at t: [1+12t, 12+12t]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway5: two cars: same parameters? \n  Car1: (head=-36, tail=-47, speed=12) -> same as freeway5 car1: [-47+12t, -36+12t]\n  Car2: (head=12, tail=1, speed=12) -> same as freeway5 car2: [1+12t, 12+12t]\n\nFreeway 7: same\nFreeway 8: same\n\nSo freeways 1,2,3 are identical; freeway4 has three cars; freeways 5,6,7,8 are identical.\n\nNow, we are starting at turn 11 (t=0) at row 3. We need to go to row 9. The minimal number of turns would be at least 6 (if we go up every turn: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 6 moves). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe'll simulate the path and check for collisions. We must consider that at each turn, we choose U, D, or S, and then the next row is clamped to [0,9]. Since we are starting at 3 and going to 9, we don't want to go below 0 or above 9, but going up is the goal.\n\nWe'll try to find the minimal H by trying the direct path and if collisions occur, then we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid a collision and then go up.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions for turns starting at turn 11.\n\nLet me compute the car positions for the rows we might traverse: rows 3 to 9. But note: we start at row 3 at turn 11. Then we move to rows 4,5,6,7,8,9. We must avoid rows 1 and 2? We start at row 3, so we won't go to row 1 or 2? But we can go down? However, going down from 3 would lead to 2, then 1, then 0. But we are at row 3 and we want to go to 9, so going down would be counterproductive. So we assume we only move up or stay.\n\nSo the possible rows we will be in: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9. But note: row 9 is the goal and there are no cars above row 8 (since freeways are 1 to 8). So once we are at row 9, we are safe.\n\nWe must check for each row from 3 to 8 at the time we are on that row.\n\nWe'll denote the time steps: \n  T0 = 11: row=3\n  T1 = 12: row=?\n  ...\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we try the minimal path: 6 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U: \n  T11: row3 -> T12: row4 -> T13: row5 -> T14: row6 -> T15: row7 -> T16: row8 -> T17: row9.\n\nBut we must check at each turn (from 11 to 16) the row we are at and whether there is a collision.\n\nWe check:\n\nTurn T=11 (t=0): row=3 -> freeway 3.\n  Freeway3 has one car: at t=0: [-26, -15]. Does 0 in [-26,-15]? No. Safe.\n\nTurn T=12 (t=1): row=4 -> freeway4.\n  Freeway4 has three cars:\n    Car1: [-15+4*1, -4+4*1] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is included? Yes! Because -11<=0<=0? But note: the interval is inclusive. So 0 is at the right end? So it is included. Therefore, collision.\n\nSo the direct path fails at T=12 on freeway4.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway4 at t=1 (T=12). So we must avoid being on row4 at turn12.\n\nHow? We can either:\n  a) at turn11, instead of going up, we stay: then at T=11 we are at row3 (safe) and at T=12 we are still at row3. Then we can go up at T=12 to row4 at T=13? But then we are at row4 at T=13 (t=2). Check row4 at t=2: \n        Car1: [-15+4*2, -4+4*2] = [-15+8, -4+8] = [-7,4] -> 0 in [-7,4]? Yes.\n  b) at turn11, we go down? But that would lead to row2 at T=12. Then we are on freeway2 at T=12 (t=1). Check freeway2 at t=1: \n        Car: [-26+3*1, -15+3*1] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in [-23,-12] -> safe. Then we can try to go up from there.\n\nBut going down might lead to a longer path. We need to minimize the total turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to wait at row3 for one turn and then go up. But as above, at T=13 (t=2) on row4 is still unsafe.\n\nHow about wait two turns at row3? Then at T=13 (t=2) we go up to row4 at T=13? Then we are at row4 at T=13 (t=2). \n  Check row4 at t=2: Car1: [-15+4*2, -4+4*2] = [-7,4] -> unsafe.\n\nWait three turns? Then at T=14 (t=3) we go to row4: \n  row4 at t=3: Car1: [-15+4*3, -4+4*3] = [-15+12, -4+12] = [-3,8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\nWait four turns? Then at T=15 (t=4): \n  Car1: [-15+16, -4+16] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe? But wait, 0 is less than 1, so no.\n\nSo if we stay at row3 for 4 turns (from T=11 to T=14: actions S,S,S,S) then at T=15 we go to row4: \n  Then at T=11: row3 (safe) \n  T=12: row3 (safe) -> freeway3 at t=1: [-26+3, -15+3] = [-23,-12] -> safe? Actually, at T=12 we are at row3 -> freeway3: [-26+3*1, -15+3*1] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n  T=13: row3: freeway3 at t=2: [-26+6, -15+6] = [-20,-9] -> safe.\n  T=14: row3: freeway3 at t=3: [-26+9, -15+9] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  T=15: row4: freeway4 at t=4: \n        Car1: [-15+16, -4+16] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n        Car2: [21+16, 32+16] = [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48] -> safe.\n        Car3: [-55+16, -44+16] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n\nSo row4 at t=4 is safe.\n\nThen we can proceed: \n  T=15: row4 -> then at T=16: we go to row5? \n        At T=16: row5? We need to check row5 at t=5 (T=16): \n        Freeway5: two cars:\n          Car1: [-47+12*5, -36+12*5] = [-47+60, -36+60] = [13,24] -> safe.\n          Car2: [1+12*5, 12+12*5] = [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\n  Then T=17: row6? \n        Freeway6 at t=6: same as freeway5 at t=6? \n          Car1: [-47+72, -36+72] = [25,36] -> safe.\n          Car2: [1+72,12+72] = [73,84] -> safe.\n\n  Then T=18: row7? \n        Freeway7 at t=7: \n          Car1: [-47+84, -36+84] = [37,48] -> safe.\n          Car2: [1+84,12+84] = [85,96] -> safe.\n\n  Then T=19: row8?\n        Freeway8 at t=8:\n          Car1: [-47+96, -36+96] = [49,60] -> safe.\n          Car2: [1+96,12+96] = [97,108] -> safe.\n\n  Then T=20: row9? -> goal, and no cars on row9.\n\nBut is this minimal? We used 4 stays at row3, then up to row4 (at T=15), then up to row5 (T=16), row6 (T=17), row7 (T=18), row8 (T=19), row9 (T=20). So H = 10? Because from T=11 to T=20 is 10 turns? Actually, the sequence is from turn11 to turn20: 10 actions? But note: the minimal path without waiting would be 6 actions (from turn11 to turn16). Here we have 10 turns? Actually, the number of actions is the number of turns we take. We start at turn11 and take actions for 10 turns? Then we are at turn20.\n\nBut we can try to see if we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, can we go down to row2 and then go up? \n\nAt turn11: we are at row3. Instead of staying, we go down to row2 at T=12.\n\nCheck at T=12 (t=1): row2 -> freeway2: at t=1: [-26+3, -15+3] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nThen at T=12: we are at row2. Then we can go up to row3 at T=13? \n  At T=13: row3 -> freeway3 at t=2: [-26+6, -15+6] = [-20,-9] -> safe.\n\nThen at T=13: we can go up to row4 at T=14? \n  T=14: row4 at t=3: \n        Car1: [-15+4*3, -4+4*3] = [-3,8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot go to row4 at t=3.\n\nThen we might wait at row3? \n  At T=14: we stay at row3? Then T=14: row3 at t=3: freeway3: [-26+9, -15+9] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  Then T=15: go to row4? at t=4: row4: as above, safe (car1: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]).\n\nThen from row4 we go up as before.\n\nSo the sequence:\n  T11: D (from 3 to 2) -> at T12: row2\n  T12: U (from 2 to 3) -> at T13: row3\n  T13: S (stay at 3) -> at T14: row3\n  T14: U (to 4) -> at T15: row4 -> safe (t=4: row4 safe)\n  Then we go up: \n        T15: U -> T16: row5\n        T16: U -> T17: row6\n        T17: U -> T18: row7\n        T18: U -> T19: row8\n        T19: U -> T20: row9\n\nBut we are at row9 at T20. That's 10 turns as well.\n\nAlternatively, after row2, we might go up to row3 and then immediately to row4? But we saw that row4 at t=2 (T=13) is unsafe. \n\nOr at T12: at row2, we can stay? \n  T12: row2 (safe) -> T13: if we stay at row2: \n        row2 at t=2: freeway2: [-26+6, -15+6] = [-20,-9] -> safe.\n  Then T13: we go to row3: \n        row3 at t=3: [-26+9, -15+9] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  Then T14: go to row4: at t=4: row4 safe as above.\n\nThen the sequence:\n  T11: D -> row2 at T12\n  T12: S -> row2 at T13\n  T13: U -> row3 at T14\n  T14: U -> row4 at T15 (safe)\n  Then from row4: \n        T15: U -> row5 at T16\n        T16: U -> row6 at T17\n        T17: U -> row7 at T18\n        T18: U -> row8 at T19\n        T19: U -> row9 at T20\n\nStill 9 actions? Wait: from T11 to T20: we have 10 turns? Actually, we take 9 actions: \n  T11: D\n  T12: S\n  T13: U\n  T14: U\n  T15: U\n  T16: U\n  T17: U\n  T18: U\n  T19: U\n\nThat's 9 actions, and we reach row9 at turn20? But at turn11 we start at row3. Then:\n\n  T11: D -> row2 at the beginning of T12? Actually, the update: at turn T, we do the action and then the position for the next turn is set. So:\n\n  Turn 11: action D -> at the end of turn11, we are at row2, and then at turn12 we are at row2.\n  Turn12: action S -> at the end of turn12, we are at row2 -> so at turn13 we are at row2? \n  But we did: \n      T12: S -> so we are at row2 at the end of T12? Then at turn13 we start at row2.\n\n  Turn13: U -> at the end of T13: row3 -> so at turn14 we start at row3.\n\n  Turn14: U -> at the end of T14: row4 -> at turn15: row4.\n\n  Then turn15: U -> turn16: row5\n        turn16: U -> turn17: row6\n        turn17: U -> turn18: row7\n        turn18: U -> turn19: row8\n        turn19: U -> turn20: row9.\n\nSo at turn20, we are at row9. The number of actions: from turn11 to turn19: that's 9 actions? But the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1? So H = 9? Then we have 9 actions: from turn11 to turn19.\n\nBut note: at turn11 we do the first action, and then after 9 actions we are at turn20? Actually, the turns we take actions: turn11, turn12, ... turn19 -> that's 9 turns. So H=9.\n\nBut we started at turn11 at row3. After 9 actions, we are at turn20 (which is 11+9-1? Let me see: \n  After 1 action (turn11): we are at the state for turn12? \n  We want to be at row9 at the beginning of turn (11+H-1)? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nSo if t1=11, then at turn (11+H-1) we are at row9.\n\nIn the above sequence: \n  After 9 actions (H=9), we are at turn 11+9-1 = 19? But in the sequence above, we are at row9 at the beginning of turn20? \n\nActually, the timing:\n\n  Turn11: we do action a11 -> then at the end of turn11, we move to the next row, and that row is the starting row for turn12.\n  So at the beginning of turn11, we are at row3. \n      After action a11 (D): at the beginning of turn12, we are at row2.\n  Then at the beginning of turn12: we are at row2, then we do a12 (S): then at the beginning of turn13: row2.\n  Then a13 (U): at the beginning of turn14: row3.\n  Then a14 (U): at the beginning of turn15: row4.\n  Then a15 (U): at the beginning of turn16: row5.\n  Then a16 (U): at the beginning of turn17: row6.\n  Then a17 (U): at the beginning of turn18: row7.\n  Then a18 (U): at the beginning of turn19: row8.\n  Then a19 (U): at the beginning of turn20: row9.\n\nWe want to be at row9 at the beginning of turn (11+H-1). \n\nSo we want: 11+H-1 = 20? Then H-1 = 9 -> H=10.\n\nBut the problem: the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1: meaning from turn11 to turn11+H-1.\n\nSo if H=10, then we have actions from turn11 to turn20? But then at the beginning of turn21 we would be at row9? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the position at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). \n\nIn our sequence: \n  After the last action (at turn19: U) we are at row9 at the beginning of turn20. \n  So the turn at which we are at (0,9) is turn20.\n\nTherefore: 11 + H - 1 = 20  => H = 10.\n\nBut wait, we did 9 actions? How is that?\n\nThe sequence of actions: \n  We take an action at each turn from turn11 to turn19: that's 9 actions. Then we are at row9 at the beginning of turn20. \n\nThe problem: the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1: meaning we have H actions. And then at turn t1+H-1 we are at the goal.\n\nSo if we take H actions, then the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then at the beginning of the next turn (t1+H) we are at the new row. But we are at the goal at the beginning of turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nThis suggests that after the last action, we are at the goal at the same turn? \n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t. Then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and that becomes the state for the next turn.\n\nBut the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nThat means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut how do we get there? By the action we take at turn t1+H-2? \n\nExample: \n  At the beginning of turn t1: we are at row3.\n  We take action at turn t1: that leads to the row at the beginning of turn t1+1.\n\nSo to be at row9 at the beginning of turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that brought us there.\n\nTherefore, we want: \n  at the beginning of turn (t1+H-1) we are at row9.\n\nThat means the action that brought us to row9 was taken at turn (t1+H-2). \n\nBut the sequence of actions is from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: \n  t=0: turn t1\n  t=1: turn t1+1\n  ...\n  t=H-1: turn t1+H-1\n\nBut if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, then that action would update the position to the beginning of turn t1+H. But we are required to be at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\nThis implies that the last action we take must be at turn t1+H-2? \n\nBut the sequence includes H actions: from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1. \n\nTherefore, we must be at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, meaning that the last action that affected that position was at turn t1+H-2. Then the action at turn t1+H-1 is not needed? \n\nActually, the problem states: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo if we are already at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at that turn? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. \n\nBut if we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to move. But we still have to specify an action for that turn? However, we can choose S (stay). \n\nAnd then the next state (for turn t1+H) would still be row9. \n\nBut the problem only requires to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1. So we can stop at turn t1+H-1? \n\nTherefore, the action at turn t1+H-1 is not necessary to move? We can do S.\n\nSo in the sequence, the last action (at turn t1+H-1) can be S if we are already at row9 at the beginning of that turn? Or we might get there by an action at turn t1+H-2.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want to be at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action (which could be S) at that turn? \n\nBut note: if we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we can take any action? Because even if we go down, we would leave row9? But the requirement is to be at (0,9) at that turn. \n\nActually, the collision condition: we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action. But the collision check is at the beginning of the turn? Or during the turn? \n\nThe problem says: collision occurs at turn T only if ... and we are on freeway y_T. And at the beginning of turn T, we are at row y_T. Then during the turn, we choose an action. The collision is checked at turn T, meaning at the beginning? Or during the turn? \n\nThe note says: when you decide to move to a different row, you are not on that row at turn T. This implies that the row we are at at the beginning of the turn is the one that matters for collision.\n\nTherefore, if we are at row9 at the beginning of turn T, then there is no car on row9 (since freeways are 1-8) so it is safe. Then we can take any action? But we don't care as long as we are at row9 at that turn.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we can take an action at turn t1+H-1 that might move us, but then we would not be at row9 at the beginning of the next turn. But we are required to be at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\nTherefore, the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is not necessary to move us to row9; we should already be there at the beginning of that turn. Then we can choose an action at that turn arbitrarily? But the problem requires a sequence of actions until we reach the goal. \n\nHowever, the goal is to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1. So the action at turn t1+H-1 can be S, to stay. Or even U or D? But if we are at row9 and do U, we stay at row9 (because the grid is clamped to [0,9]). Similarly, D would go to 8? Then we wouldn't be at row9 at the beginning of the next turn, but we only care about turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, we are at row9 at the beginning, and then we can do any action? But the problem doesn't require us to stay at row9 afterward. \n\nTherefore, the minimal H is the minimal number such that we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nNow, how many actions? The actions are taken from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1: that's H actions. And we must be at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn the direct path without waiting: \n  We start at turn11 (row3). \n  We want to be at row9 at the beginning of turn11+H-1.\n\nThe fastest: \n  At the beginning of turn11: row3.\n  We take 6 up actions: \n        turn11: U -> turn12: row4\n        turn12: U -> turn13: row5\n        turn13: U -> turn14: row6\n        turn14: U -> turn15: row7\n        turn15: U -> turn16: row8\n        turn16: U -> turn17: row9\n\nSo at the beginning of turn17, we are at row9. Therefore, we want: \n        11 + H - 1 = 17  => H = 7.\n\nBut we have a collision on turn12 (row4) so we cannot take that path.\n\nIn our earlier waiting strategy: \n  We wait at row3 for 4 turns (S,S,S,S) then go up 6 times? \n        turn11: S -> turn12: row3\n        turn12: S -> turn13: row3\n        turn13: S -> turn14: row3\n        turn14: S -> turn15: row3\n        turn15: U -> turn16: row4\n        turn16: U -> turn17: row5\n        turn17: U -> turn18: row6\n        turn18: U -> turn19: row7\n        turn19: U -> turn20: row8\n        turn20: U -> turn21: row9\n\nSo at the beginning of turn21, we are at row9. Then we want 11+H-1 = 21 -> H = 11.\n\nBut earlier we had a path that went down and then up and we were at row9 at turn20? \n  At the beginning of turn20, row9. So 11+H-1 = 20 -> H=10.\n\nIn that path: \n  Actions: \n      turn11: D -> at turn12: row2\n      turn12: S -> turn13: row2\n      turn13: U -> turn14: row3\n      turn14: U -> turn15: row4\n      turn15: U -> turn16: row5\n      turn16: U -> turn17: row6\n      turn17: U -> turn18: row7\n      turn18: U -> turn19: row8\n      turn19: U -> turn20: row9\n\nSo we are at row9 at turn20. So H=10: because 11+10-1=20.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t=0 to 9: turn11 to turn19 (10 actions).\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe were forced to avoid row4 at t=1,2,3. We found that row4 is safe at t>=4. \n\nWhat if we try to go faster through the upper rows? \n\nAlternatively, can we skip row4? No, because we must go from row3 to row4 to row5, etc.\n\nOr, we might go from row3 to row4 at a later time when it is safe, but then go faster through rows 5,6,7,8? But the cars on rows 5-8 are moving fast, and they might be safe at later times? \n\nBut in our first safe path (without going down) we did 4 waits at row3 and then went up. That took 10 actions? Actually, 4 waits + 6 ups = 10 actions, and then we are at row9 at turn21? \n\nBut in the down then up path, we did 10 actions and reached at turn20? \n\nBut let me count the down then up path again:\n\n  Actions: 10 actions (from turn11 to turn20? No, the actions are at turns: 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 -> 9 actions? But we have 10 actions? \n\nLet me list:\n\n  Action1 at turn11: D -> to row2 (at turn12)\n  Action2 at turn12: S -> stay at row2 (at turn13)\n  Action3 at turn13: U -> to row3 (at turn14)\n  Action4 at turn14: U -> to row4 (at turn15)\n  Action5 at turn15: U -> to row5 (at turn16)\n  Action6 at turn16: U -> to row6 (at turn17)\n  Action7 at turn17: U -> to row7 (at turn18)\n  Action8 at turn18: U -> to row8 (at turn19)\n  Action9 at turn19: U -> to row9 (at turn20)\n\nSo 9 actions. Then we are at row9 at turn20. Then we want to be at row9 at the beginning of turn (11+H-1). \n\nSo 11+H-1 = 20 -> H = 10.\n\nBut we only took 9 actions. The problem requires a sequence of H actions? \n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> so t from 0 to H-1: that's H actions.\n\nBut in this case, we only need 9 actions? But then H=9, and then we would be at row9 at turn 11+9-1 = 19? But in our simulation, we are at row9 at turn20, not turn19.\n\nWhat's the issue? \n\nThe actions are taken at turns: \n  a_{t1} at turn t1 = 11 -> first action.\n  a_{t1+1} at turn12\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-1} at turn11+H-1.\n\nAnd after taking the last action (at turn11+H-1), the next state is at turn11+H.\n\nBut we are required to be at row9 at turn11+H-1.\n\nSo to be at row9 at the beginning of turn11+H-1, we must have been brought there by the action taken at turn11+H-2. Then at turn11+H-1, we are at row9 and we take an action (which might be S) and then we move to the next state, but we don't care about that.\n\nTherefore, in the down-up path:\n\n  We want to be at row9 at the beginning of turn20. \n  The action that brings us to row9 is taken at turn19: U (from row8 to row9). \n  Then at turn19, we take that action and then at the beginning of turn20 we are at row9.\n\n  But the turn at which we are at row9 is turn20. \n\n  So we require 11+H-1 = 20 -> H=10.\n\n  Then the sequence of actions has 10 actions: from turn11 to turn20.\n\n  But what is the action at turn20? We are already at row9 at the beginning of turn20. We can choose S.\n\n  So the full sequence:\n\n      turn11: D\n      turn12: S\n      turn13: U\n      turn14: U\n      turn15: U\n      turn16: U\n      turn17: U\n      turn18: U\n      turn19: U   -> this action at turn19: from row8 to row9, so at turn20 we are at row9.\n      turn20: S   -> this is the 10th action.\n\nBut is the action at turn20 necessary? The problem requires a sequence of H actions that gets us to row9 at turn11+H-1. \n\n  At turn11+H-1 = 11+10-1 = 20, we are at row9. But the action at turn20 is taken after we are already at row9 at the beginning of turn20. \n\n  However, the collision condition: at turn20, we are at row9 -> safe. Then we take action S -> and then we stay at row9 for turn21, but we don't care.\n\n  But the requirement is only to be at row9 at turn20.\n\n  So the action at turn20 can be S.\n\nTherefore, the down-up path with an extra S at the end gives H=10.\n\nBut can we avoid the extra action? \n\nIf we can be at row9 at the beginning of turn19, then we would only need 9 actions? \n\nHow? \n\n  We would need to be at row9 at turn19. \n  That means we must have taken an action at turn18 that brought us to row9 at turn19.\n\n  So we must be at row8 at the beginning of turn18, then do U at turn18, then at turn19 we are at row9.\n\n  But can we get to row8 by turn18? \n\n  Starting from row3 at turn11, we need to go up 5 times (to go from 3 to 8) in 7 turns? But we have to avoid collisions.\n\n  We know that we must avoid row4 at t=1,2,3 (i.e., turns12,13,14). \n\n  We can try:\n\n      turn11: S (stay at 3) -> turn12: row3\n      turn12: S -> turn13: row3\n      turn13: S -> turn14: row3\n      turn14: U -> turn15: row4 (t=4: safe)\n      turn15: U -> turn16: row5 (t=5: safe as before)\n      turn16: U -> turn17: row6 (t=6: safe)\n      turn17: U -> turn18: row7 (t=7: safe)\n      turn18: U -> turn19: row8 (t=8: safe? freeway8 at t=8: \n                Car1: [-47+12*8, -36+12*8] = [-47+96, -36+96] = [49,60] -> safe.\n                Car2: [1+96,12+96]=[97,108] -> safe.\n      Then at turn19: we want to be at row9. So we do U at turn19: then at turn20 we are at row9. But we want to be at row9 at turn19? We are not.\n\n  Alternatively, can we be at row9 at turn19? \n\n  We would need to be at row8 at turn18, then U at turn18: then at turn19 we are at row9.\n\n  But then we are at row9 at the beginning of turn19. \n\n  Then we require 11+H-1 = 19 -> H=9.\n\n  But to get to row8 at turn18, we need to have moved from row3 to row8 in 7 turns (from turn11 to turn18). \n\n  How many moves? 5 up moves. So we need 5 up moves and 2 stays? \n\n  We can do:\n\n        turn11: U -> but then at turn12: row4 -> t=1: unsafe.\n        turn11: S -> turn12: row3\n        turn12: S -> turn13: row3\n        turn13: U -> turn14: row4 (t=3: unsafe, because car1: [-3,8] includes 0)\n        turn11: S, turn12: U? -> then turn12: row4 (t=1: unsafe)\n\n  Or:\n\n        turn11: D -> to row2 at turn12 (safe)\n        turn12: U -> to row3 at turn13 (safe)\n        turn13: U -> to row4 at turn14 (t=3: unsafe) -> fails.\n\n  Or:\n\n        turn11: D -> row2 at turn12\n        turn12: U -> row3 at turn13\n        turn13: S -> row3 at turn14\n        turn14: U -> row4 at turn15 (safe, t=4)\n        turn15: U -> row5 at turn16 (safe)\n        turn16: U -> row6 at turn17 (safe)\n        turn17: U -> row7 at turn18 (safe)\n        turn18: U -> row8 at turn19 -> then we are at row8 at turn19, but we want to be at row9 at turn19.\n\n  To be at row9 at turn19, we would have to be at row8 at turn18 and then do U at turn18: then at turn19 we are at row9.\n\n  So if we can be at row8 at turn18, then we can do U at turn18 and be at row9 at turn19.\n\n  How to be at row8 at turn18? \n\n  From above, we can be at row7 at turn18 by:\n\n        turn11: D -> row2 at turn12\n        turn12: U -> row3 at turn13\n        turn13: S -> row3 at turn14\n        turn14: U -> row4 at turn15\n        turn15: U -> row5 at turn16\n        turn16: U -> row6 at turn17\n        turn17: U -> row7 at turn18\n\n  Then at turn18: we are at row7. Then we do U at turn18: to row8 at turn19. But we want to be at row8 at turn18? We are not.\n\n  To be at row8 at turn18, we would have to do U at turn17 from row7 to row8 at turn18.\n\n  So:\n\n        turn17: U -> row8 at turn18.\n\n  Then at turn18: we are at row8. Then we do U at turn18: then at turn19 we are at row9. But wait, we cannot do two actions in one turn.\n\n  The action at turn17 is taken and then we are at row8 at turn18. Then at turn18, we take an action (U) and then at turn19 we are at row9.\n\n  So to be at row8 at the beginning of turn18, we need:\n\n        turn11: D (row2 at turn12)\n        turn12: U (row3 at turn13)\n        turn13: U -> but then at turn14: row4 (t=3: unsafe)\n\n  How about:\n\n        turn11: D (row2 at turn12)\n        turn12: U (row3 at turn13)\n        turn13: S (row3 at turn14)\n        turn14: U (row4 at turn15) [safe]\n        turn15: U (row5 at turn16)\n        turn16: U (row6 at turn17)\n        turn17: U (row7 at turn18) -> then at turn18, we are at row7, not row8.\n\n  We need to be at row8 at turn18. So we must have moved faster? \n\n  We have only 7 turns (from turn11 to turn17) to go from row3 to row8: that's 5 up moves. We have 7 turns, so we can do 5 up and 2 other moves? But we did down and then up and then a stay: that's one down, one up, one stay, and then five up? That's 1+1+1+5 = 8 moves? But we have only 7 turns (actions at turn11 to turn17: 7 actions). \n\n  Alternatively, without the down:\n\n        turn11: S (row3 at turn12)\n        turn12: S (row3 at turn13)\n        turn13: S (row3 at turn14)\n        turn14: U (row4 at turn15) [safe]\n        turn15: U (row5 at turn16)\n        turn16: U (row6 at turn17)\n        turn17: U (row7 at turn18) -> then at turn18: row7.\n\n  Still not row8.\n\n  To be at row8 at turn18, we need to have done 5 up moves by turn18. The first up move cannot be before turn14 (because row4 is unsafe before t=4). \n\n  So:\n\n        turn14: U (from row3 to row4) -> safe.\n        turn15: U (row5)\n        turn16: U (row6)\n        turn17: U (row7)\n        turn18: U (row8) -> then at turn19: row8. \n\n  So we are at row8 at turn19.\n\n  To be at row8 at turn18, we would have to do the first up at turn13? But turn13 is t=2, and row4 at t=2 is unsafe.\n\n  Therefore, it seems impossible to be at row8 by turn18.\n\n  Thus, the minimal H is 10.\n\n  We have two strategies:\n\n  Strategy 1: stay at row3 for 4 turns, then go up.\n\n      Actions:\n          turn11: S\n          turn12: S\n          turn13: S\n          turn14: S\n          turn15: U\n          turn16: U\n          turn17: U\n          turn18: U\n          turn19: U\n          turn20: U   -> then at turn21: row9. But then 11+H-1=21 -> H=11.\n\n      But this is 11 actions? And we are at row9 at turn21.\n\n      Alternatively, after the last U at turn20, we are at row9 at turn21. But we want to be at row9 at turn20? \n\n      We are at row9 at turn21. So we would need to do an extra action at turn21: S? Then H=11, and we are at row9 at turn21 (11+11-1=21).\n\n      But that is worse than the down-up path.\n\n  Strategy 2: down then up.\n\n      Actions:\n          turn11: D\n          turn12: S\n          turn13: U\n          turn14: U\n          turn15: U\n          turn16: U\n          turn17: U\n          turn18: U\n          turn19: U   -> at turn20: row9\n          turn20: S   -> to satisfy the sequence of 10 actions.\n\n      But then we are at row9 at turn20, and 11+10-1=20, so it satisfies.\n\n      However, the action at turn20 is S when we are already at row9. But that is acceptable.\n\n  But is there a strategy with H=10 that doesn't go down? \n\n  We could try to use fewer waits at row3. We know we have to avoid row4 at t=1,2,3. \n\n  We can do:\n\n      turn11: S (row3 at turn12) -> safe.\n      turn12: S (row3 at turn13) -> safe.\n      turn13: S (row3 at turn14) -> safe.\n      turn14: U (row4 at turn15) -> safe (t=4)\n      turn15: U (row5 at turn16) -> safe.\n      turn16: U (row6 at turn17) -> safe.\n      turn17: U (row7 at turn18) -> safe.\n      turn18: U (row8 at turn19) -> safe.\n      turn19: U (row9 at turn20) -> safe.\n      turn20: S (to complete the 10th action) -> safe.\n\n  This also works and has 10 actions. And we are at row9 at turn20.\n\n  This is better because we don't go down.\n\n  So the sequence:\n\n      Turn11: S\n      Turn12: S\n      Turn13: S\n      Turn14: U\n      Turn15: U\n      Turn16: U\n      Turn17: U\n      Turn18: U\n      Turn19: U\n      Turn20: S   [but note: at turn20 we are at row9, so we do S to stay]\n\n  But wait, the last action (turn20: S) is taken when we are at row9 at the beginning of turn20. Then we do S and remain at row9 for turn21.\n\n  But we are required to be at row9 at turn20 (the beginning of turn20). \n\n  How did we get to row9 at turn20? By the action at turn19: U (from row8 to row9) -> so at turn20 we are at row9.\n\n  Then at turn20, we do S -> which is unnecessary for the goal but required for the sequence of 10 actions.\n\n  Therefore, this is valid and also has 10 actions.\n\n  And it is simpler: we don't go down.\n\n  So the minimal H is 10.\n\n  But can we avoid the last S? \n\n  If we can be at row9 at turn19, then we would only need 9 actions. But we concluded that's not possible.\n\n  Therefore, we choose the sequence with 4 waits at row3 (actually 3 waits: turns11,12,13 are S, then turn14 we go up) and then 5 up moves and then one S.\n\n  But note: from row3 at turn14, we do U at turn14: then at turn15 we are at row4.\n        Then U at turn15: row5 at turn16\n        U at turn16: row6 at turn17\n        U at turn17: row7 at turn18\n        U at turn18: row8 at turn19\n        U at turn19: row9 at turn20\n\n  Then at turn20, we do S: that's the 10th action.\n\n  So the sequence:\n\n      Turn11: S\n      Turn12: S\n      Turn13: S\n      Turn14: U\n      Turn15: U\n      Turn16: U\n      Turn17: U\n      Turn18: U\n      Turn19: U\n      Turn20: S\n\n  But wait, we only need to be at row9 at turn20. We are already there at the beginning of turn20. Then the action at turn20 can be anything? But if we do U or D, we might move? \n\n  However, the grid is clamped: \n        If at row9 and we do U: still row9.\n        If we do D: then we go to row8 at turn21, but we only care about turn20.\n\n  So we can do U at turn20? But then the action is U, and we remain at row9.\n\n  Or we can do S.\n\n  We choose S to be safe.\n\n  But note: the problem requires minimal H. H=10 in both strategies.\n\n  We'll choose the one that doesn't go down.\n\n  But let's verify the collisions for this sequence:\n\n      Turn11 (t=0): row3 -> freeway3: car at [-26, -15] -> safe.\n      Turn12 (t=1): row3 -> freeway3: [-26+3, -15+3] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n      Turn13 (t=2): row3 -> freeway3: [-26+6, -15+6] = [-20,-9] -> safe.\n      Turn14 (t=3): row3 -> freeway3: [-26+9, -15+9] = [-17,-6] -> safe. \n            But wait, at turn14 we are at row3? Then we do U -> then at turn15 we will be at row4.\n\n      At turn14: we are at row3 (beginning) and then we do U -> then at the end of turn14 we move to row4, so at the beginning of turn15 we are at row4.\n\n      Turn15 (t=4): row4 -> freeway4: \n            Car1: [-15+4*4, -4+4*4] = [-15+16, -4+16] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n            Car2: [21+16, 32+16] = [37,48] -> safe.\n            Car3: [-55+16, -44+16] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n\n      Turn16 (t=5): row5 -> freeway5: \n            Car1: [-47+12*5, -36+12*5] = [13,24] -> safe.\n            Car2: [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\n      Turn17 (t=6): row6 -> same as freeway5 at t=6: \n            Car1: [-47+72, -36+72] = [25,36] -> safe.\n            Car2: [73,84] -> safe.\n\n      Turn18 (t=7): row7 -> freeway7: \n            Car1: [-47+84, -36+84] = [37,48] -> safe.\n            Car2: [85,96] -> safe.\n\n      Turn19 (t=8): row8 -> freeway8: \n            Car1: [-47+96, -36+96] = [49,60] -> safe.\n            Car2: [97,108] -> safe.\n\n      Turn20 (t=9): row9 -> no cars, safe. And we do S.\n\n  This is safe.\n\n  Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n      Turn11: S\n      Turn12: S\n      Turn13: S\n      Turn14: U\n      Turn15: U\n      Turn16: U\n      Turn17: U\n      Turn18: U\n      Turn19: U\n      Turn20: S\n\n  But note: the problem says to output the sequence for turns starting at t1=11 and for t=0 to H-1, which is 10 actions.\n\n  So we output:\n\n      Turn11: S\n      Turn12: S\n      Turn13: S\n      Turn14: U\n      Turn15: U\n      Turn16: U\n      Turn17: U\n      Turn18: U\n      Turn19: U\n      Turn20: S\n\n  However, the last action (at turn20) is not necessary for reaching row9 at turn20? Because we are already at row9 at the beginning of turn20. But the problem requires a sequence of H actions, and we must have H=10, so we include it.\n\n  But is there a sequence of 9 actions that gets us to row9 at turn19? \n\n  If we can be at row9 at turn19, then we output 9 actions.\n\n  We try: \n\n      We need to be at row9 at the beginning of turn19: 11+9-1=19.\n\n      How to get to row9 in 8 moves (from row3 at turn11 to row9 at turn19) with 8 moves? But we must go 6 steps up. \n\n      So we need 6 up moves and 3 other moves (which could be stays or even down, but down would be counterproductive).\n\n      We can do 6 up moves and 3 stays? \n\n      But we have to avoid collisions.\n\n      The earliest we can be at row4 is at t=4 (turn15) as we found.\n\n      Then:\n\n          turn11: S (row3 at turn12)\n          turn12: S (row3 at turn13)\n          turn13: S (row3 at turn14)\n          turn14: U (row4 at turn15) [safe]\n          turn15: U (row5 at turn16)\n          turn16: U (row6 at turn17)\n          turn17: U (row7 at turn18)\n          turn18: U (row8 at turn19)\n          turn19: U (row9 at turn20) -> but we are at row9 at turn20, not turn19.\n\n      To be at row9 at turn19, we would have to be at row8 at turn18 and then do U at turn18: then at turn19 we are at row9.\n\n      So we need to be at row8 at turn18.\n\n      How to be at row8 at turn18? \n\n          We are at row3 at turn11.\n          We need to go from row3 to row8: 5 up moves, in 7 turns (from turn11 to turn17: because the action at turn17 will move us to row8 at turn18).\n\n          The first up move (to row4) must be at or after turn14 (so that at turn15 we are at row4, and t=4: safe).\n\n          Then:\n\n                turn14: U -> turn15: row4\n                turn15: U -> turn16: row5\n                turn16: U -> turn17: row6\n                turn17: U -> turn18: row7 -> we are at row7 at turn18, not row8.\n\n          We are one short.\n\n      If we can do an extra up move earlier, but we cannot because we are stuck at row3 until turn14.\n\n      Therefore, it is impossible to be at row8 at turn18.\n\n  Thus, minimal H is 10.\n\n  We output the sequence with 3 stays at row3, then 6 up moves and then one stay at the end.\n\n  But note: in the sequence above, we have only 5 up moves from row4 to row9? \n        turn14: U (row3->row4) -> then we are at row4 at turn15.\n        turn15: U (row4->row5) at turn16.\n        turn16: U (row5->row6) at turn17.\n        turn17: U (row6->row7) at turn18.\n        turn18: U (row7->row8) at turn19.\n        turn19: U (row8->row9) at turn20.\n\n  That's 6 up moves: from turn14 to turn19.\n\n  And then turn20: S.\n\n  So 10 actions.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the turn20 action is at turn20, and the turn we are at row9 is turn20? Yes, at the beginning of turn20 we are at row9. Then we do S at turn20.\n\nWe could also do U at turn20? Then we are still at row9 at turn21. But the problem only requires to be at row9 at turn20. \n\nBut the action S is safe and doesn't change the row.\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid the last action if H were defined differently, but the problem requires H actions.\n\nSo we output the above.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 3) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars, the player must stay at row 3 for the first three turns to avoid an unsafe condition on row 4 at turns 12, 13, and 14. The car on row 4 (freeway 4) covers x=0 at turns 12, 13, and 14 (t=1,2,3 relative to turn 11), but is safe at turn 15 (t=4). After moving to row 4 at turn 14, the player moves up one row per turn to reach row 9 by turn 20. The action at turn 20 is \"S\" (stay) to satisfy the sequence length requirement, as the player is already at row 9 at the start of turn 20.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 11 to 20 (H=10) is:\n\n- Turn 11: Stay at row 3 (safe, no car covers x=0 on row 3 at t=0).\n- Turn 12: Stay at row 3 (safe at t=1).\n- Turn 13: Stay at row 3 (safe at t=2).\n- Turn 14: Move up to row 4 (safe at t=3 for row 3, and row 4 is safe at t=4 when entered at turn 15).\n- Turn 15: Move up to row 5 (safe at t=5).\n- Turn 16: Move up to row 6 (safe at t=6).\n- Turn 17: Move up to row 7 (safe at t=7).\n- Turn 18: Move up to row 8 (safe at t=8).\n- Turn 19: Move up to row 9 (safe, as row 9 has no cars).\n- Turn 20: Stay at row 9 (to complete the sequence; the player is already at row 9).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at the start of turn 20 (t=9 relative to turn 11) with no collisions, using 10 turns (H=10).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: S\n}",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nPlayer movement:\n- U: y increases by 1 (up)\n- D: y decreases by 1 (down)\n- S: stay (y remains)\n\nCollision condition: At turn T, if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k, for k in {1,...,8}) and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nNote: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, we are only present on freeway y_T during turn T. So we only check the car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWe start at y=3 at turn 12. We need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal vertical distance is 6 (from 3 to 9). So at least 6 moves (if we go up every turn). But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe must compute the positions of the cars at each future turn (relative to turn 12). Let T = t - 12, so at turn 12, T=0.\n\nFor a car on a freeway:\n\nLeft-moving: \n  Span at turn t (where t = 12 + T) = [h - s * T, τ - s * T]   (and note that for left-moving, h is the head and τ is the tail? But the problem says for left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, τ] -> at T: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] but note that T-t1 = T since t1=12? Actually, T is the offset from t1.\n\nBut note: the update rule is for T>t1, so at time T (absolute) = t1 + T_offset, we have:\n\nFor left-moving: \n  new_head = h - s*(T_offset)\n  new_tail = τ - s*(T_offset)\n\nBut the problem says: \n  Left-moving: Span(t1)= [h, τ] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving:\n  Span(t1)= [τ, h] -> at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nHowever, note the representation in the table:\n\nFor freeway 4: (0, -11, right, 4) ... so for a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? But wait, the problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\". So for a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is at the rightmost end) and the tail is the leftmost? \n\nBut the update rule for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for the car (0, -11, right, 4) at t1=12:\n  τ = -11, h = 0, s=4, direction=right.\n\nAt T = t1 + T_offset (with T_offset=0 at t1), the span at t1 is [ -11, 0 ].\n\nThen at turn t = 12 + T_offset, the span becomes:\n  [ -11 + 4*T_offset, 0 + 4*T_offset ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if we had one: [h, τ] at t1, then at T: [h - s*T_offset, τ - s*T_offset].\n\nBut note: the problem states that collision occurs only if the player is at (0, k) and 0 is in the span of a car on freeway k at that turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 12 (T_offset=0) to the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nWe must avoid freeways 1 to 8 when there is a car that covers x=0 at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nLet's list the cars for each freeway at turn 12 (T_offset=0):\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-12, -23, right, 3) -> right-moving? \n  Actually, the table says \"direction d\": right. So right-moving.\n  Span at T_offset=0: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? \n  But wait, the problem says: for right-moving, the span is [τ, h]. However, in the table, it's written as (head h, tail τ). For right-moving, the head should be the larger coordinate? But here: h=-12, τ=-23 -> so head is -12 and tail is -23. Since the car is moving right, the head is the front. So the span is from tail to head: [-23, -12]. \n\nSo at T_offset=0: span = [-23, -12] -> does it cover 0? No.\n\nBut note: the update: at T_offset, the span is [ -23 + 3*T_offset, -12 + 3*T_offset ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: [-23, -12] at T_offset=0? Actually same data: (-12, -23, right, 3) -> so same: [-23, -12] at T_offset=0.\n\nFreeway 3: same: [-23, -12] at T_offset=0.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n  Car1: (0, -11, right, 4) -> so head=0, tail=-11 -> wait, for right-moving, the head should be the larger coordinate? But 0 > -11, so head=0, tail=-11 -> span at T_offset=0: [tail, head] = [-11, 0]. This covers 0! So at turn 12, freeway 4 has a car that covers x=0? \n  But note: the player is at freeway 3 at turn 12, so we don't check freeway4 at turn12. However, if we move to freeway4 at a future turn, we must check.\n\n  Car2: (36, 25, right, 4) -> head=36, tail=25? But that would imply tail>head? That doesn't make sense. \n  Let me read the table: it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, ...)\". For a right-moving car, the head should be the front (larger x) and tail the rear (smaller x). But here head=36, tail=25: that would be a car from 25 to 36? But then the update rule for right-moving: [τ + s*(T_offset), h + s*(T_offset)] = [25 +4*T_offset, 36+4*T_offset]. That does not cover 0 at T_offset=0.\n\n  Car3: (-40, -51, right, 4) -> head=-40, tail=-51 -> so the car is from -51 to -40? Then [ -51 +4*T_offset, -40+4*T_offset] -> at T_offset=0: [-51,-40] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\n  So only the first car on freeway4 at T_offset=0: [-11,0] -> covers 0. So if we are on freeway4 at T_offset=0, we collide. But we are at y=3 at turn12, so we are not on freeway4 at turn12.\n\nFreeway5: two cars:\n  Car1: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> head=-24, tail=-35 -> so the car is from -35 to -24? Then [ -35 +12*T_offset, -24+12*T_offset]\n  Car2: (24, 13, right, 12) -> head=24, tail=13 -> [13+12*T_offset, 24+12*T_offset]\n\nFreeway6,7,8: same as freeway5? The table shows the same two cars for each.\n\nNow, we are at y=3 at turn12. We need to move to y=9.\n\nWe can plan a path. We have to avoid:\n\nFreeway1,2,3: at T_offset=0 (turn12) we are on freeway3 -> but freeway3 at turn12: car span [-23,-12] -> doesn't cover 0, so we are safe at turn12.\n\nWe must avoid freeway4 at any turn when we are on it and the car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWe are going to compute the positions of the cars at future turns (T_offset = 0,1,2,...) and see when they cover x=0.\n\nWe are particularly interested in when a car on a freeway has 0 in its span at a given T_offset.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the times T_offset when 0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nFreeway1: one car: [ -23 + 3*T_offset, -12 + 3*T_offset ]\n  We need: -23 + 3*T_offset <= 0 <= -12 + 3*T_offset\n  => \n    -23 + 3*T_offset <= 0  => 3*T_offset <= 23 => T_offset <= 23/3 ≈ 7.666 -> T_offset <= 7 (since integer)\n    and 0 <= -12 + 3*T_offset => 12 <= 3*T_offset => T_offset >= 4.\n\n  So at T_offset in [4,7] (i.e., turns 16 to 19) freeway1 is blocked.\n\nFreeway2: same as freeway1: blocked at T_offset [4,7]\n\nFreeway3: same: blocked at T_offset [4,7]\n\nFreeway4: \n  Car1: [-11 + 4*T_offset, 0 + 4*T_offset] = [-11+4*T_offset, 4*T_offset]\n    We need: -11+4*T_offset <= 0 <= 4*T_offset\n    => \n        -11+4*T_offset <= 0 => 4*T_offset <= 11 => T_offset <= 2.75 -> T_offset <= 2\n        and 0 <= 4*T_offset => T_offset >= 0\n    So T_offset in [0,2] -> turns 12,13,14: freeway4 is blocked by car1.\n\n  Car2: [13+4*T_offset, 24+4*T_offset] -> 0 is never in this interval because 13+4*T_offset >= 13 > 0 for T_offset>=0.\n\n  Car3: [-51+4*T_offset, -40+4*T_offset] -> maximum is -40+4*T_offset, which becomes positive only when 4*T_offset>40 -> T_offset>=10.25 -> T_offset>=11. Then we need -51+4*T_offset<=0<=-40+4*T_offset? \n    At T_offset=11: [-51+44, -40+44] = [-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4]? Actually, -7<=0<=4 -> yes. \n    So car3 covers 0 at T_offset>= ceil( (40)/4 )? Actually, we need -51+4*T_offset <= 0 and 0<=-40+4*T_offset? \n    But note: the interval is [ -51+4*T_offset, -40+4*T_offset]. We require:\n        -51+4*T_offset <= 0 <= -40+4*T_offset\n    => \n        T_offset <= 51/4 = 12.75 -> T_offset<=12\n        and 0<=-40+4*T_offset -> 40<=4*T_offset -> T_offset>=10\n    So T_offset in [10,12] -> turns 22,23,24.\n\n  Therefore, freeway4 is blocked at T_offset: [0,2] and [10,12] -> so turns 12,13,14,22,23,24.\n\nFreeway5: \n  Car1: [-35+12*T_offset, -24+12*T_offset]\n    We need: -35+12*T_offset <= 0 <= -24+12*T_offset\n    => \n        -35+12*T_offset<=0 -> 12*T_offset<=35 -> T_offset<=2.916 -> T_offset<=2\n        0<=-24+12*T_offset -> 24<=12*T_offset -> T_offset>=2\n    So only at T_offset=2: [ -35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is the upper bound? The interval is [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes, because it's a closed interval? The problem doesn't specify, but we assume inclusive. So T_offset=2: blocked.\n\n  Car2: [13+12*T_offset, 24+12*T_offset] -> minimum is 13 (at T_offset=0) and increases. So 0 is never in this interval.\n\n  Therefore, freeway5 is blocked at T_offset=2 (turn14).\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5? The table says same cars: so blocked at T_offset=2.\n\nFreeway7: same: blocked at T_offset=2.\n\nFreeway8: same: blocked at T_offset=2.\n\nSummary of blocked freeways by turn (relative to turn12, T_offset):\n\nTurn T_offset=0 (turn12):\n  Freeway4: blocked (by car1)\n\nTurn T_offset=1 (turn13):\n  Freeway4: blocked (by car1) -> because [ -11+4= -7, 4] -> 0 in [-7,4] -> yes.\n\nTurn T_offset=2 (turn14):\n  Freeway4: blocked (by car1: [-11+8, 8] = [-3,8] -> 0 in [-3,8]: yes)\n  Freeway5,6,7,8: blocked (by car1: at T_offset=2, car1 on these freeways: [-35+24, -24+24]=[-11,0] -> 0 is included)\n\nTurn T_offset=3 (turn15):\n  Freeway4: car1: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> car1 gone? \n            car3: not yet (car3 at T_offset=3: [-51+12, -40+12]=[-39,-28] -> no)\n            so freeway4 clear? \n  But wait, car1: [ -11+4*3, 0+4*3] = [1,12] -> 0 not in. \n  car3: [-51+12, -40+12] = [-39,-28] -> no. \n  car2: [13+12, 24+12]=[25,36] -> no.\n  So freeway4 clear at T_offset=3.\n\n  Freeway5: at T_offset=3: \n        car1: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n        car2: [13+36, 24+36]=[49,60] -> no.\n        so freeway5 clear? \n  Similarly, freeways6,7,8: same as freeway5.\n\nTurn T_offset=4 (turn16):\n  Freeway1,2,3: blocked (as per above, from T_offset=4 to 7) -> so freeway1,2,3 blocked.\n  Freeway4: \n        car1: [ -11+16, 16] = [5,16] -> no\n        car3: [-51+16, -40+16]=[-35,-24] -> no\n        so freeway4 clear.\n  Freeway5: \n        car1: [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24] -> no\n        car2: [13+48,24+48]=[61,72] -> no\n        so clear.\n\nTurn T_offset=5 (turn17): same as T_offset=4? \n  Freeway1,2,3: blocked (until T_offset=7)\n  Others: clear.\n\nTurn T_offset=6 (turn18): same.\n\nTurn T_offset=7 (turn19): freeway1,2,3 blocked (last block).\n\nTurn T_offset=8 (turn20): freeway1,2,3: \n        For freeway1: T_offset=8: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> clear.\n        Similarly, freeway2,3 clear.\n\nTurn T_offset=9 (turn21): all clear? \n\nTurn T_offset=10 (turn22): freeway4: car3: [-51+40, -40+40]=[-11,0] -> 0 in? \n        -11<=0<=0 -> yes.

The minimal number of moves is 6 (if we go up every turn). But we have to avoid the blocked freeways at the times we are on them.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay). We must not be on a freeway when it is blocked at that turn.\n\nWe are at y=3 at T_offset=0. We are safe at T_offset=0 on y=3? \n  Freeway3: blocked at T_offset in [4,7] -> not at T_offset=0 -> safe.\n\nWe need to plan the next moves.\n\nWe have to go through freeways 4,5,6,7,8 to get to 9? Actually, we are at 3, then we go to 4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut note: the goal is (0,9). The freeways are from 1 to 8. The player can be at y=0 and y=9 without worrying about cars (since cars are only on freeways 1-8). So when we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nWe start at y=3 at T_offset=0.\n\nWe must avoid:\n  T_offset=0: freeway4 is blocked -> so we cannot move to freeway4 at T_offset=0? But we are at y=3 at T_offset=0. We are not on freeway4.\n\nBut if we want to move to freeway4 at T_offset=1, then we would be on freeway4 at T_offset=1? How?\n\nAt turn T (absolute)=12 (T_offset=0): we are at y=3. Then we choose an action for turn12 (which will move us at the next turn, turn13 (T_offset=1)).\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn12 (T_offset=0): we are at y=3. We choose an action (U, D, or S) that will determine y at turn13 (T_offset=1).\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at T_offset=t if k is blocked at t.\n\nWe are going to simulate the next moves.\n\nWe want the minimal H. So we try to go up as much as possible.\n\nOption 1: Go up every turn.\n\nTurn12 (T_offset=0): at y=3 -> we choose U -> then at turn13 (T_offset=1): we are at y=4.\n\nBut at T_offset=1: freeway4 is blocked. So if we are at y=4 at T_offset=1, we are on freeway4 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go up at turn12.\n\nWe can choose to stay at turn12: then at turn13 (T_offset=1): we are still at y=3.\n\nBut then we have to move eventually.\n\nOr we can go down? But we are at y=3, if we go down to y=2, then we are on freeway2 at T_offset=1. Freeway2 is blocked only at T_offset in [4,7]. So at T_offset=1, freeway2 is safe.\n\nSo let's consider:\n\nOption 2: Stay at turn12: \n  Turn12: S -> y remains 3 at turn13 (T_offset=1). \n  Now at T_offset=1, we are at y=3. Freeway3 is blocked at T_offset>=4, so at T_offset=1, it's safe.\n\n  Then at turn13 (T_offset=1): we can choose to go up? \n        U: then at turn14 (T_offset=2): y=4.\n        But at T_offset=2, freeway4 is blocked -> so if we are at y=4 at T_offset=2, we crash.\n\n  Or at turn13: we can choose to stay again? \n        S: then at turn14 (T_offset=2): still y=3.\n        Then at turn14: we are at y=3. But freeway3: blocked at T_offset>=4? T_offset=2 is not in [4,7] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn14: we can go up? Then at turn15 (T_offset=3): y=4.\n        At T_offset=3: freeway4 is clear (as we saw: car1: [1,12] -> 0 not in) -> safe.\n\n        Then we can continue up: \n          turn15: at y=4 -> U -> turn16 (T_offset=4): y=5.\n          At T_offset=4: freeway5 is clear? We saw freeway5 is only blocked at T_offset=2, so at T_offset=4: clear. \n          But note: freeway5: we saw that at T_offset=4: car1: [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> no 0 -> clear.\n\n          Then turn16: U -> turn17 (T_offset=5): y=6.\n          Freeway6: at T_offset=5: \n                car1: [-35+60, -24+60]=[25,36] -> no\n                car2: [13+60,24+60]=[73,84] -> no\n                so safe.\n\n          Then turn17: U -> turn18 (T_offset=6): y=7.\n          Freeway7: same as above: safe.\n\n          Then turn18: U -> turn19 (T_offset=7): y=8.\n          Freeway8: same: safe? \n                car1: [-35+84, -24+84]=[49,60] -> no\n                car2: [13+84,24+84]=[97,108] -> no -> safe.\n\n          Then turn19: U -> turn20 (T_offset=8): y=9 -> goal.\n\n        Total turns: from turn12 to turn20 -> 8 turns? \n          We started at turn12 (T_offset=0) and ended at turn20 (T_offset=8). But we took actions at turn12,13,...,19 -> 8 actions? \n          Actually, we have H moves: we start at turn12, then we do 8 actions: \n            turn12: S\n            turn13: S\n            turn14: U\n            turn15: U\n            turn16: U\n            turn17: U\n            turn18: U\n            turn19: U\n          Then at turn19 (after the U) we are at y=9? \n          Let me check:\n\n          turn12: start at y=3, do S -> y remains 3 at the next state? \n          Actually, the update: at turn t, we do action a_t, then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\n          So:\n            turn12: a12 = S -> y13 = 3 + 0 = 3.\n            turn13: a13 = S -> y14 = 3 + 0 = 3.\n            turn14: a14 = U -> y15 = 3 + 1 = 4.\n            turn15: a15 = U -> y16 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n            turn16: a16 = U -> y17 = 5 + 1 = 6.\n            turn17: a17 = U -> y18 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n            turn18: a18 = U -> y19 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n            turn19: a19 = U -> y20 = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\n          So at turn20, we are at y=9. But we have performed 8 actions (from turn12 to turn19). The goal is reached at turn20 (which is the state after the last action). So H=8.\n\n          Is there a shorter path?\n\nWe need to check if we can do it in less than 8 moves.\n\nMinimal is 6 moves (if we go up 6 times). But we saw that going up immediately at turn12 leads to crash at turn13 (when we are at y=4 at T_offset=1).\n\nWhat if we delay the move to freeway4 until T_offset=3 (which is safe)?\n\nWe have to get from y=3 to y=9 in 6 moves, but we must avoid:\n\n  - At T_offset=1: freeway4 is blocked -> we cannot be at y=4 at T_offset=1.\n  - At T_offset=2: freeway4,5,6,7,8 are blocked? \n        freeway4: blocked at T_offset=2 -> so we cannot be at y=4 at T_offset=2.\n        freeway5,6,7,8: blocked at T_offset=2 -> so we cannot be at y=5,6,7,8 at T_offset=2.\n\nBut note: if we are at y=3 at T_offset=2, that's safe (freeway3 is safe at T_offset=2).\n\nWe can try:\n\n  Turn12: U -> then at T_offset=1: we are at y=4 -> blocked. -> crash.\n\n  Turn12: D -> then at T_offset=1: y=2 -> freeway2: blocked only at T_offset>=4 -> safe.\n      Then we have to go up eventually.\n\nBut if we go down to y=2 at T_offset=1, then we have to cover from y=2 to y=9: 7 steps. \n\nBut we might be able to avoid the blocks by timing.\n\nAlternatively, we might go up at a later time.\n\nBut note: we must be at y=9 at the end. The blocks happen at specific T_offsets.\n\nWe can try to go up as soon as freeway4 is safe, which is at T_offset>=3.\n\nSo:\n\n  We are at y=3 at T_offset=0.\n\n  We can do:\n    T_offset=0: S -> y=3 (safe)\n    T_offset=1: S -> y=3 (safe)\n    T_offset=2: U -> y=4 (at T_offset=3: because the state after the action at T_offset=2 will be at T_offset=3? \n          Action at turn14 (T_offset=2) -> then y15 = 3+1=4, and this state is at turn15 (T_offset=3). So we are on freeway4 at T_offset=3 -> safe (because freeway4 is safe at T_offset=3).\n\n    Then we can go up every turn: \n        T_offset=3: at y=4 -> U -> T_offset=4: y=5\n        T_offset=4: at y=5 -> U -> T_offset=5: y=6\n        T_offset=5: at y=6 -> U -> T_offset=6: y=7\n        T_offset=6: at y=7 -> U -> T_offset=7: y=8\n        T_offset=7: at y=8 -> U -> T_offset=8: y=9\n\n  Total actions: 2 (S) + 1 (U) then 5 (U) = 8 actions? \n        turn12: S -> y13=3\n        turn13: S -> y14=3\n        turn14: U -> y15=4\n        turn15: U -> y16=5\n        turn16: U -> y17=6\n        turn17: U -> y18=7\n        turn18: U -> y19=8\n        turn19: U -> y20=9\n\n  Same as before: 8 actions.\n\nBut can we do it in 7?\n\nWe need to save one move. We are currently spending two turns at y=3.\n\nIf we can spend only one turn at y=3, then:\n\n  Turn12: S -> then at T_offset=1: y=3 (safe)\n  Then at turn13 (T_offset=1): we cannot go to y=4 (because freeway4 is blocked at T_offset=1) -> so we must either stay or go down.\n\n  If we go down: \n        turn13: D -> then at T_offset=2: y=2 (freeway2) -> freeway2 is blocked at T_offset>=4? So at T_offset=2: safe.\n        Then we have to go up: \n            turn14 (T_offset=2): we are at y=2 -> we can go up to y=3? \n                But at T_offset=3: we want to be at y=4? \n                So: \n                  turn14: U -> y=3 at T_offset=3 (state at turn15: T_offset=3, y=3) -> safe? freeway3: blocked at T_offset in [4,7] -> so at T_offset=3: safe.\n                Then turn15: U -> y=4 at T_offset=4 -> freeway4: at T_offset=4: clear -> safe.\n                Then turn16: U -> y=5 at T_offset=5 -> freeway5: clear -> safe.\n                turn17: U -> y=6 at T_offset=6 -> safe.\n                turn18: U -> y=7 at T_offset=7 -> safe.\n                turn19: U -> y=8 at T_offset=8 -> safe.\n                turn20: U -> y=9 at T_offset=9 -> goal.\n\n            But that's 8 moves again.\n\n  Alternatively, at turn13 (T_offset=1): we stay at y=3? \n        Then at turn14 (T_offset=2): we are at y=3 -> safe (freeway3 not blocked at T_offset=2). \n        Then we can go up at turn14: to y=4 at T_offset=3 -> safe.\n        Then same as above: then we go up every turn until we get to y=9 at T_offset=8 (turn20) -> 7 moves? \n          Actions: \n            turn12: S\n            turn13: S\n            turn14: U -> then we are at y=4 at turn15 (T_offset=3)\n            turn15: U -> y=5 at turn16 (T_offset=4)\n            turn16: U -> y=6 at turn17 (T_offset=5)\n            turn17: U -> y=7 at turn18 (T_offset=6)\n            turn18: U -> y=8 at turn19 (T_offset=7)\n            turn19: U -> y=9 at turn20 (T_offset=8)\n\n          That's 8 actions.\n\nBut wait: we started at turn12 and ended at turn20 (state at turn20). The actions are from turn12 to turn19 -> 8 actions.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at an earlier turn.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\n  We start at y=3 at turn12.\n\n  We want to be at y=4 at T_offset=3 (which is safe). Then we can go up quickly.\n\n  But we have 3 turns (turn12,13,14) to get to y=4 at turn15 (T_offset=3). \n\n  We must not be at y=4 at T_offset=1 or 2.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      Option: \n        turn12: D -> then at turn13 (T_offset=1): y=2 (safe, because freeway2 is safe at T_offset=1)\n        turn13: U -> then at turn14 (T_offset=2): y=3 (safe, freeway3 safe at T_offset=2)\n        turn14: U -> then at turn15 (T_offset=3): y=4 (safe) -> then we go up: \n        turn15: U -> y=5 at T_offset=4 (safe)\n        turn16: U -> y=6 at T_offset=5 (safe)\n        turn17: U -> y=7 at T_offset=6 (safe)\n        turn18: U -> y=8 at T_offset=7 (safe)\n        turn19: U -> y=9 at T_offset=8 (goal)\n\n      That's 8 moves.\n\n  Or: \n        turn12: S -> y=3 at turn13 (T_offset=1) [safe]\n        turn13: D -> then at turn14 (T_offset=2): y=2 (freeway2: safe at T_offset=2? freeway2 blocked at T_offset in [4,7] -> yes, safe)\n        turn14: U -> then at turn15 (T_offset=3): y=3 (safe) -> but we are still at y=3? Then we have to go to y=4 at turn16? \n        Then: \n          turn15: U -> y=4 at T_offset=4 -> freeway4: safe? at T_offset=4: freeway4 is clear -> safe.\n          turn16: U -> y=5 at T_offset=5 -> safe\n          turn17: U -> y=6 at T_offset=6 -> safe\n          turn18: U -> y=7 at T_offset=7 -> safe\n          turn19: U -> y=8 at T_offset=8 -> safe\n          turn20: U -> y=9 at T_offset=9 -> goal? \n          But that's 9 moves.\n\nWe want minimal H.\n\nWhat if we go up as soon as possible without crashing? The first safe time for freeway4 is T_offset=3.\n\nSo we need to be at y=4 at T_offset=3.\n\nWe start at y=3 at T_offset=0.\n\nWe have 3 turns to get to y=4 at T_offset=3.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  - Stay at y=3 for two turns (T_offset=0 and 1) and then go up at T_offset=2 to be at y=4 at T_offset=3: \n        turn12: S -> T_offset=0: stay at y=3 -> then at turn13: y=3 (T_offset=1)\n        turn13: S -> T_offset=1: stay at y=3 -> then at turn14: y=3 (T_offset=2)\n        turn14: U -> then at turn15: y=4 (T_offset=3) -> safe.\n\n  - Or: \n        turn12: D -> then at turn13: y=2 (T_offset=1)\n        turn13: U -> then at turn14: y=3 (T_offset=2)\n        turn14: U -> then at turn15: y=4 (T_offset=3) -> same.\n\n  - Or: \n        turn12: U -> then at turn13: y=4 (T_offset=1) -> crash.\n\nSo the two safe ways take 3 moves to get to y=4 at T_offset=3.\n\nThen we need 5 more moves to get to y=9: 4,5,6,7,8,9 -> 5 steps? \n  Actually, from y=4 to y=9: 5 steps (U at turn15,16,17,18,19) -> then at turn20: y=9.\n\nTotal moves: 3 (to get to y=4) + 5 = 8 moves.\n\nBut note: we start at turn12 and do actions at turn12,13,...,19 (8 actions) and then at turn20 we are at y=9.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=9 earlier?\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn T. The earliest we can be at y=9 is if we go up 6 times: that would be at turn12+6 = turn18.\n\nBut can we do that without crashing?\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n  T_offset=0: we start at y=3 -> safe.\n\n  Then:\n    turn12: action a12 -> y13 = 3 + delta\n    turn13: a13 -> y14 = ...\n    ...\n\n  We need to be at y=9 at turn18 (T_offset=6).\n\n  The constraints:\n\n    At T_offset=1: we cannot be at y=4 (because freeway4 blocked)\n    At T_offset=2: we cannot be at y=4,5,6,7,8 (because freeway4,5,6,7,8 blocked)\n\n  We start at y=3 at T_offset=0.\n\n  After turn12 (a12): we can be at y=2,3,4 at T_offset=1.\n\n  But we cannot be at y=4 at T_offset=1 -> so a12 cannot be U.\n\n  So a12 can be S (y13=3) or D (y13=2).\n\n  Case 1: a12 = S -> then at T_offset=1: y=3.\n\n      Then at turn13 (T_offset=1): we choose a13 -> we can go to y=2,3,4 at T_offset=2.\n\n      But at T_offset=2: we cannot be at y=4,5,6,7,8 -> so we cannot choose U (because that would go to y=4 at T_offset=2).\n\n      So we can choose S (y=3) or D (y=2).\n\n        If a13=S: then at T_offset=2: y=3 -> safe.\n        Then at turn14 (T_offset=2): we choose a14 -> we can go to y=2,3,4 at T_offset=3.\n\n        But at T_offset=3: freeway4 is safe, so we can be at y=4 at T_offset=3.\n\n        Now, we want to be at y=9 at T_offset=6 (turn18). \n\n        From turn14 (T_offset=2) we are at y=3. We need to get to y=9 in 4 moves? \n          We have 4 actions: turn14,15,16,17 -> we need to go up 6 levels? \n          From y=3 to y=9: 6 steps -> we need 6 moves? but we only have 4 moves -> impossible.\n\n        Alternatively, if we go up as much as possible:\n\n          turn14: U -> then at T_offset=3: y=4\n          turn15: U -> T_offset=4: y=5\n          turn16: U -> T_offset=5: y=6\n          turn17: U -> T_offset=6: y=7 -> then we are at y=7 at turn18 (T_offset=6) -> not 9.\n\n        So we cannot reach y=9 by turn18.\n\n  Case 2: a12 = D -> then at T_offset=1: y=2.\n\n      Then at turn13 (T_offset=1): we can choose a13 -> to y=1,2,3 at T_offset=2.\n\n      But at T_offset=2: \n          freeway1: blocked? freeway1 is blocked at T_offset in [4,7] -> so at T_offset=2: safe? \n          freeway2: safe? \n          freeway3: safe? \n          But note: we cannot be at y=4,5,6,7,8 at T_offset=2 -> but we are going to be at most y=3.\n\n      So we can choose U: then at T_offset=2: y=3 (safe) -> same as above: then we are at y=3 at T_offset=2, and we need 6 moves to get to y=9 -> we only have 4 moves (turn14 to turn17) -> we get to y=7 at turn18.\n\n      Or we choose S: then at T_offset=2: y=2 -> safe, but then we are even lower.\n\n      Or we choose D: then at T_offset=2: y=1 -> safe? freeway1 is safe at T_offset=2 -> but then we are at y=1 -> we have to cover 8 levels in 5 moves? impossible.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=9 in 6 moves (by turn18).\n\nWhat about 7 moves? Then we would be at y=9 at turn19 (T_offset=7).\n\nWe start at turn12: do 7 actions (turn12 to turn18) and then at turn19 we are at y=9.\n\nWe need to go from y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps (if we go up every time) but we have 7 moves? Actually, we have 7 actions to cover 6 steps? We can do one extra stay.\n\nBut we have to avoid the blocks.\n\nConstraints:\n\n  T_offset=1: cannot be at y=4.\n  T_offset=2: cannot be at y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe have:\n\n  T_offset=0: y=3 (safe)\n  T_offset=1: we can be at y=2,3 (not 4) -> so a12: S or D.\n  T_offset=2: we can be at y=1,2,3 (because we cannot be at 4-8) -> so from T_offset=1 (y=2 or 3) we can go to y=1,2,3,4? but 4 is blocked -> so we can only go to y=1,2,3.\n\n  Then T_offset=3: we can be at y=4 (since freeway4 safe) and also safe for others? \n        freeway1,2,3: blocked only at T_offset>=4? so at T_offset=3: safe? \n        freeway4: safe? \n        freeway5,6,7,8: safe? \n\n  So at T_offset=3: we can be at any freeway.\n\n  Then we can go up quickly.\n\nBut we have 7 moves to cover 6 steps: so we can have one extra move to stay or go down and up.\n\nLet's try:\n\n  Option A: \n    turn12: S -> T_offset=1: y=3\n    turn13: S -> T_offset=2: y=3\n    turn14: U -> T_offset=3: y=4\n    turn15: U -> T_offset=4: y=5\n    turn16: U -> T_offset=5: y=6\n    turn17: U -> T_offset=6: y=7\n    turn18: U -> T_offset=7: y=8\n    then we are at y=8 at turn19 (T_offset=7) -> not 9.\n\n  We need one more up: turn19: U -> then at turn20: y=9 -> but that's 8 moves.\n\n  Option B: use the extra move to go up at an earlier time?

Then we go down to y=2 at T_offset=2? \n        turn12: S -> T_offset=1: y=3\n        turn13: D -> T_offset=2: y=2\n        turn14: U -> T_offset=3: y=3\n        turn15: U -> T_offset=4: y=4\n        then we need to go from y=4 to y=9: 5 moves -> \n        turn16: U -> y=5\n        turn17: U -> y=6\n        turn18: U -> y=7\n        turn19: U -> y=8\n        turn20: U -> y=9 -> 9 moves.\n\n  Option D: at turn12: D -> y=2 at T_offset=1\n        turn13: U -> y=3 at T_offset=2\n        turn14: U -> y=4 at T_offset=3\n        turn15: U -> y=5\n        turn16: U -> y=6\n        turn17: U -> y=7\n        turn18: U -> y=8\n        turn19: U -> y=9 -> 8 moves.\n\n  Option E: use a stay at a later time? \n\n  How about:\n\n        turn12: S -> T_offset=1: y=3\n        turn13: S -> T_offset=2: y=3\n        turn14: U -> T_offset=3: y=4\n        turn15: U -> T_offset=4: y=5\n        turn16: U -> T_offset=5: y=6\n        turn17: U -> T_offset=6: y=7\n        turn18: U -> T_offset=7: y=8 -> then we are at y=8 at T_offset=7 -> safe, but we need to get to y=9 at the next turn -> turn19: U -> y=9 at T_offset=8.\n\n        That's 8 moves.\n\nBut wait, at T_offset=7: we are at y=8 -> freeway8: safe? \n        freeway8 at T_offset=7: \n          car1: [-35 + 12*7, -24+12*7] = [-35+84, -24+84] = [49,60] -> no 0 -> safe.\n        car2: [13+84,24+84]=[97,108] -> no.\n\n        so safe.\n\nBut we are still at 8 moves.\n\nWe must see if we can be at y=9 at T_offset=7 (turn19) by doing only 7 moves? \n\nWe need to cover 6 levels in 7 moves: so we have one extra move. We can use that extra move to go up at an earlier time? But we are blocked at the beginning.\n\nWhat if we go up twice in a row after T_offset=3? \n\nBut we have to be at y=4 at T_offset=3. Then we can go up every turn until we get to y=9 at T_offset=8.\n\nAlternatively, we might skip some freeways by going up two in one move? No, we can only move one per turn.\n\nOr we might go down and then up to avoid a future block? But the only future block is freeway4 at T_offset=10,11,12 (turns22,23,24) which is beyond when we hope to finish (by turn19).\n\nSo the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut let me check if there is a 7-move path.\n\nSuppose we do:\n\n  turn12: S -> y=3 at T_offset=1 (safe)\n  turn13: D -> y=2 at T_offset=2 (safe) [freeway2 safe]\n  turn14: U -> y=3 at T_offset=3 (safe) [freeway3 safe]\n  turn15: U -> y=4 at T_offset=4 (safe) [freeway4 safe at T_offset=4? yes]\n  turn16: U -> y=5 at T_offset=5 (safe)\n  turn17: U -> y=6 at T_offset=6 (safe)\n  turn18: U -> y=7 at T_offset=7 (safe)\n  then we are at y=7 at turn19 (T_offset=7) -> not 9.\n\n  We need two more moves to get to 9.\n\nAlternatively, after T_offset=3 (y=3) we go up quickly:\n\n  turn15: U -> y=4 (T_offset=4)\n  turn16: U -> y=5 (T_offset=5)\n  turn17: U -> y=6 (T_offset=6)\n  turn18: U -> y=7 (T_offset=7) -> then we need turn19: U -> y=8 (T_offset=8) and turn20: U -> y=9 -> 9 moves.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\n  turn12: S -> y=3 (T_offset=1)\n  turn13: S -> y=3 (T_offset=2) [safe]\n  turn14: U -> y=4 (T_offset=3) [safe]\n  turn15: U -> y=5 (T_offset=4) [safe]\n  turn16: U -> y=6 (T_offset=5) [safe]\n  turn17: U -> y=7 (T_offset=6) [safe]\n  turn18: U -> y=8 (T_offset=7) [safe]\n  turn19: U -> y=9 (T_offset=8) -> 8 moves.\n\nThis is the same as the first plan.\n\nBut note: at T_offset=7, we are at y=8 -> freeway8: safe.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns is 8.\n\nNow, we have two sequences that work:\n\nSequence A (with two stays at the beginning):\n  turn12: S\n  turn13: S\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n  turn16: U\n  turn17: U\n  turn18: U\n  turn19: U\n\nSequence B (with a down and then up):\n  turn12: D\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n  turn16: U\n  turn17: U\n  turn18: U\n  turn19: U\n\nBut wait, in sequence B:\n\n  turn12: D -> at turn13: y=2 (T_offset=1) -> safe.\n  turn13: U -> at turn14: y=3 (T_offset=2) -> safe.\n  turn14: U -> at turn15: y=4 (T_offset=3) -> safe.\n  then same as above.\n\nBut note: at turn14 (T_offset=2): we are at y=3 -> safe. Then at turn14 we do U -> then at turn15 (T_offset=3) we are at y=4.\n\nBut we have to check freeway4 at T_offset=3: safe.\n\nBoth sequences are 8 moves.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut note: in the down move, we went to y=2. Are there any cars on freeway1? \n  Freeway1: blocked at T_offset in [4,7]. We are at freeway2 at T_offset=1 and freeway3 at T_offset=2 -> not freeway1.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nWe can output either.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and both are 8.\n\nI'll choose sequence A (the one without down) to avoid going down unnecessarily.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut wait, we are at turn12: we start at (0,3). After turn12 (action S): we stay at 3 -> next turn13: still at 3.\nThen turn13: S -> still at 3.\nThen turn14: U -> to 4.\n...\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n...\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n\nAnd then at turn20 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here H=8, so t from 0 to 7.\n\nt=0: turn12\nt=1: turn13\n...\nt=7: turn19\n\nSo we have 8 actions.\n\nBut note: the goal is reached at the state after the last action, which is turn20.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nLet me double-check that we avoid collisions:\n\nTurn12: at y=3 (freeway3) at T_offset=0: freeway3 car: [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn13: we do S, so we are at y=3 at T_offset=1: freeway3: [-23+3, -12+3] = [-20,-9] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn14: we do U, so at turn15 we are at y=4 (T_offset=2? no: wait, the action at turn14 will update to the next state at turn15.\n\nAt turn14 (when we do the action): we are at y=3 (from turn14 state). Then we do U -> so at turn15: y=4.\n\nSo at turn15: T_offset = turn15 - turn12 = 3? \n  T_offset = 3: \n      freeway4: \n          car1: [-11+4*3, 0+4*3] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n          other cars: not covering 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTurn15: we do U -> then at turn16: y=5 -> T_offset=4: \n      freeway5: \n          car1: [-35+12*4, -24+12*4] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> no\n          car2: [13+48,24+48]=[61,72] -> no\n      safe.\n\nTurn16: U -> turn17: y=6 -> T_offset=5: freeway6: same as freeway5? safe.\n\nTurn17: U -> turn18: y=7 -> T_offset=6: freeway7: safe.\n\nTurn18: U -> turn19: y=8 -> T_offset=7: freeway8: \n          car1: [-35+12*7, -24+12*7]=[-35+84, -24+84]=[49,60] -> no\n          car2: [13+84,24+84]=[97,108] -> no\n          safe.\n\nTurn19: U -> turn20: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo it works.\n\nIs there a 7-move path? We didn't find one, so we output the 8-move path.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We are doing 8 moves, so H=8.\n\nBut the answer format requires the actions for turns from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nWe could also do:\n\n  Turn12: D\n  Turn13: U\n  Turn14: U\n  Turn15: U\n  Turn16: U\n  Turn17: U\n  Turn18: U\n  Turn19: U\n\nBut that also works and has the same H.\n\nThe problem does not specify which sequence to choose if multiple, so we can choose any minimal sequence.\n\nI'll choose the one without down moves.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 8. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) based on the car positions and movements.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Analysis:\n- **Freeway 4** is blocked at turns 12, 13, 14 (relative \\(T_{\\text{offset}} = 0, 1, 2\\)) and turns 22, 23, 24 (relative \\(T_{\\text{offset}} = 10, 11, 12\\)) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Freeways 1, 2, 3** are blocked at turns 16 to 19 (relative \\(T_{\\text{offset}} = 4\\) to \\(7\\)).\n- **Freeways 5, 6, 7, 8** are blocked at turn 14 (relative \\(T_{\\text{offset}} = 2\\)).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 12. The sequence uses two \"S\" (stay) actions to remain at \\(y = 3\\) during turns 12 and 13, avoiding freeway 4 blocks at turns 12 and 13. At turn 14, moving up to \\(y = 4\\) is safe as freeway 4 is clear at turn 15 (relative \\(T_{\\text{offset}} = 3\\)). Subsequent \"U\" (up) actions move the player to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 20, avoiding all blocks on intermediate freeways.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 12: Stay at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3 clear).\n- Turn 13: Stay at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3 clear).\n- Turn 14: Move up to \\(y = 4\\) (safe at turn 15, freeway 4 clear).\n- Turn 15: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) (safe, freeway 5 clear).\n- Turn 16: Move up to \\(y = 6\\) (safe, freeway 6 clear).\n- Turn 17: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) (safe, freeway 7 clear).\n- Turn 18: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) (safe, freeway 8 clear).\n- Turn 19: Move up to \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached at turn 20).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 20 (after 8 actions) without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) at turn 13 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, there's no car that has a span covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn relative to turn 13. The car positions are given at turn t1=13, and they move with constant speed.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each row:\n\n- Row 1: one car, head -9, tail -20, right direction, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] but head and tail are given with h and τ, and for right-moving, it says [τ, h] becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nIn the state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\", and for direction, it says right or left.\n\nFor right-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn the row 1 entry: (-9, -20, right, 3)\n\nNow, is this [head, tail]? Head is -9, tail is -20. Since it's right-moving and tail should be left of head, but -20 is less than -9, so tail is at -20, head at -9, so the car is from -20 to -9, and since it's right-moving, it moves to the right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-20, -9]\n\nAt time T, span: [ -20 + 3*(T-13), -9 + 3*(T-13) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for collision, we care about when x=0 is in the span for a given row at the turn we are on that row.\n\nAlso, note that when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on row y_T. If I choose to move up or down, at turn T, I am still on y_T, and at turn T+1, I move to the new row.\n\nSo, for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that row at turn T.\n\nNow, I start at turn 13, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, and y must be integer between 0 and 9, to go from 3 to 9, I need at least 6 turns if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could be more.\n\nBut I should minimize H, so I want to go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row and for each turn around now, when cars are present at x=0.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to see for each freeway row, when is it safe to be on that row, meaning that at that turn, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nFor a given row and turn, if there is a car with 0 in span at that turn, it's unsafe.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nBut I need to compute for each row the times when it is unsafe.\n\nSince I start at turn 13, and I need to go to y=9, and turns are discrete, I should consider turns starting from 13.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 13, so at T=13, ΔT=0.\n\nFor each row, I have cars with their spans.\n\nStart with row 1: one car, right-moving, h=-9, τ=-20, s=3\n\nSpan at T: [ -20 + 3*ΔT, -9 + 3*ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -20 + 3*ΔT <= 0 <= -9 + 3*ΔT\n\nSince -20 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= -9 + 3ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -20 + 3ΔT <= 0 => 3ΔT <= 20 => ΔT <= 20/3 ≈ 6.666, so ΔT <= 6 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -9 + 3ΔT => 3ΔT >= 9 => ΔT >= 3\n\nSo for ΔT from 3 to 6 inclusive, 0 is in span, unsafe.\n\nΔT=3: [ -20+9, -9+9] = [-11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nΔT=4: [-20+12, -9+12] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔT=5: [-20+15, -9+15] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔT=6: [-20+18, -9+18] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔT=7: [-20+21, -9+21] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nΔT=2: [-20+6, -9+6] = [-14,-3], 0 not in\n\nSo row 1 unsafe for ΔT=3,4,5,6, i.e., T=16,17,18,19\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nT=13: ΔT=0, span [-20,-9], 0 not in\n\nT=14: ΔT=1, [-17,-6], no\n\nT=15: ΔT=2, [-14,-3], no\n\nT=16: ΔT=3, [-11,0], yes\n\netc.\n\nNow row 2: similar, (-9,-20,right,3) same as row 1, so unsafe same times: T=16,17,18,19\n\nRow 3: again same, (-9,-20,right,3), so unsafe T=16,17,18,19\n\nNow row 4: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (4, -7, right, 4), (40, 29, right, 4), (-36, -47, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head 4, tail -7?

But tail should be left, 29<40, so [τ,h] = [29,40]\n\nAt T: [29+4ΔT, 40+4ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 29+4ΔT <=0 <=40+4ΔT\n\n29+4ΔT <=0? 4ΔT <= -29, impossible since ΔT>=0, so 0 not in, always safe for this car.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (-36,-47,right,4) head -36, tail -47, so [τ,h] = [-47,-36]\n\nAt T: [-47+4ΔT, -36+4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -47+4ΔT <=0 <= -36+4ΔT\n\nFirst: -47+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=47 => ΔT <=47/4=11.75, so ΔT<=11\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36+4ΔT => 4ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=9\n\nSo for ΔT from 9 to 11 inclusive.\n\nΔT=9: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=10: [-47+40, -36+40]=[-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔT=11: [-47+44, -36+44]=[-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔT=12: [-47+48, -36+48]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nNow for row 4, unsafe if any car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car unsafe for ΔT=0,1\n\nSecond car never unsafe\n\nThird car unsafe for ΔT=9,10,11\n\nSo overall, row 4 unsafe when:\n\nFor ΔT=0 (T=13): first car unsafe\n\nΔT=1 (T=14): first car unsafe\n\nΔT=9 (T=22): third car unsafe\n\nΔT=10 (T=23): third car unsafe\n\nΔT=11 (T=24): third car unsafe\n\nAnd safe otherwise for now.\n\nBut ΔT=0 and 1 are past? No, T=13 is current turn, but I start at T=13, y=3, which is row 3? Freeways are y=1 to 8, and player y from 0 to 9.\n\nAt T=13, I am on y=3, which is freeway row 3.\n\nBut for row 4, at T=13, it is unsafe because of first car.\n\nBut I'm not on row 4 yet.\n\nNow similarly, other rows.\n\nRow 5: cars (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head -12, tail -23, right, so [τ,h] = [-23,-12]\n\nAt T: [-23 +12ΔT, -12 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -23+12ΔT <=0 <= -12+12ΔT\n\nFirst: -23+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=23 => ΔT <=23/12≈1.916, so ΔT<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12+12ΔT => 12ΔT >=12 => ΔT >=1\n\nSo both inequalities: ΔT <=1 and ΔT >=1, so only ΔT=1\n\nΔT=1: [-23+12, -12+12]=[-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=0: [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nΔT=2: [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12) head 36, tail 25, so [τ,h]=[25,36]\n\nAt T: [25+12ΔT,36+12ΔT]\n\n0 in? 25+12ΔT <=0 impossible, always safe.\n\nSo row 5 unsafe only at ΔT=1, i.e., T=14\n\nNow row 6: same as row 5? Cars (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12), same as row 5, so unsafe only at T=14\n\nRow 7: same, unsafe only at T=14\n\nRow 8: same, unsafe only at T=14\n\nNow, row 4 has more, but we have it.\n\nI am at y=3 at T=13.\n\ny=3 is row 3, which at T=13: from earlier, row 3 unsafe only at T=16,17,18,19, so at T=13 it is safe.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, it's the top, so no cars, always safe. But I need to be at (0,9), so when I reach y=9, it's fine, no collision possible.\n\nThe freeways are only y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, always safe.\n\nIn the player update, y=0 and y=9 are boundaries, but no cars, so I can be there safely.\n\nNow, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision depends on y_T at turn T.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1, to go from 3 to 9, minimum 6 turns if I go up each time.\n\nBut I need to avoid unsafe times on the rows.\n\nLet me list the unsafe times for each row:\n\nRow 1: unsafe T=16,17,18,19\n\nRow 2: same, T=16,17,18,19\n\nRow 3: same, T=16,17,18,19\n\nRow 4: unsafe at T=13,14,22,23,24\n\nT=13,14 from first car, T=22,23,24 from third car.\n\nRow 5: unsafe only at T=14\n\nRow 6: unsafe only at T=14\n\nRow 7: unsafe only at T=14\n\nRow 8: unsafe only at T=14\n\nNow, I start at T=13, y=3.\n\ny=3 is row 3, which is safe at T=13.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nI should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nI need to cross rows 4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\ny=3 to y=4, then to y=5, etc.\n\nBut at each turn, when I am on a row, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose a_t to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nFor example, at T=13, I am on y=3.\n\nSince I want to go up, I can choose U, so y_{14} = 4.\n\nOr S, stay, or D down to 2, but that might not help.\n\nSimilarly, later.\n\nNow, let's see for each row when it is safe.\n\nI am at T=13, y=3, safe.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at T=14.\n\nBut at T=14, I would be on y=4.\n\nIs y=4 safe at T=14?\n\ny=4 is row 4, which at T=14 is unsafe, because row 4 unsafe at T=14.\n\nIf I am on row 4 at T=14, I collide.\n\nSo I cannot be on row 4 at T=14.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go directly from y=3 to y=4 at turn 13, because that would put me on y=4 at T=14, which is unsafe.\n\nAt turn T=13, I am on y=3. I choose action a_{13}.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_{14} = y_{13} +1 = 4.\n\nAt turn T=14, I am on y=4.\n\nAnd row 4 is unsafe at T=14, so I collide.\n\nIf I choose S, I stay on y=3 at T=14.\n\ny=3 at T=14: T=14, ΔT=1, row 3: earlier, row 3 unsafe only at T=16-19, so at T=14, ΔT=1, span [-17,-6] for row 3, no 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose D, y=2 at T=14, but y=2 is row 2, unsafe at T=16-19, but T=14 is safe, row 2 at T=14: similar to row 1, at ΔT=1, [-17,-6], no 0, safe.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nNow, back to point: I cannot go to y=4 at T=14 because it's unsafe.\n\nI could go later, but row 4 is unsafe at T=13,14, then safe until T=22, which is far.\n\nT=22 is turn 22, which is 9 turns later, too long, I need minimal turns.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 4 at a safe time.\n\nRow 4 unsafe at T=13,14,22,23,24.\n\nSo safe at T=15 to 21, for example.\n\nT=15 to 21 inclusive? T=15: ΔT=2, row 4.\n\nFirst car: at ΔT=2, span [1,12], no 0\n\nThird car: unsafe only ΔT=9,10,11, so ΔT=2 safe.\n\nSimilarly T=16 to 21 should be safe for row 4, except T=22,23,24 unsafe.\n\nT=15: ΔT=2, safe\n\nT=16: ΔT=3, safe? Row 4 at T=16: ΔT=3, first car span at ΔT=3: [ -7+12, 4+12]= [5,16]? Earlier for first car: at ΔT, [ -7+4ΔT, 4+4ΔT]\n\nΔT=3: [-7+12,4+12]=[5,16], no 0\n\nThird car at ΔT=3: [-47+12, -36+12]=[-35,-24], no 0, so safe.\n\nT=17: ΔT=4, first car [-7+16,4+16]=[9,20], no; third car [-47+16,-36+16]=[-31,-20], no\n\n...\n\nUp to T=21: ΔT=8, first car [-7+32,4+32]=[25,36], no; third car [-47+32,-36+32]=[-15,-4], no 0\n\nT=22: ΔT=9, third car [-47+36,-36+36]=[-11,0], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nSo row 4 safe from T=15 to T=21.\n\nSimilarly, other rows have constraints.\n\nNow row 5,6,7,8 all unsafe only at T=14.\n\nSo for example, row 5: unsafe at T=14, safe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nNow, I need to be on each row at safe times.\n\nI start at T=13 on y=3, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe rows to cross: y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nI can stay or move, but to go up, I need to spend turns on the rows.\n\nSince I can move only one step per turn, the number of turns depends on how many up moves I make, but I might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut detour down might take more turns, so probably better to go up directly if possible.\n\nNow, the critical points are row 4 and row 5-8 at T=14.\n\nSpecifically, row 4 is unsafe at T=13 and T=14, so I cannot be on row 4 at those times.\n\nBut I can be on row 4 from T=15 to 21.\n\nSimilarly, for row 5, it is unsafe only at T=14, so I can be on row 5 at other times, like T=13,15,16,etc., but T=13 I'm on y=3, not 5.\n\nAt T=14, row 5 unsafe, so I must not be on row 5 at T=14.\n\nSimilarly for rows 6,7,8.\n\nNow, I am at y=3 at T=13.\n\nIf I go up immediately to y=4 at T=14, but y=4 unsafe at T=14, so I collide.\n\nSo I cannot do that.\n\nI could stay on y=3 at T=13.\n\nAt T=13, I am on y=3, safe.\n\nI choose action: if I choose S, then at T=14, I am still on y=3.\n\ny=3 at T=14 is safe, as we said.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=4 at T=15.\n\nAt T=14, I am on y=3, I choose U, then y_{15} =4.\n\nAt turn T=15, I am on y=4.\n\nNow, T=15, row 4 is safe, as we said T=15 to 21 safe.\n\nSo at T=15, on y=4, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=5.\n\ny=5 is row 5.\n\nRow 5 unsafe only at T=14.\n\nAt T=15, row 5 is safe.\n\nSo I can go up from y=4 to y=5 at turn T=15.\n\nAt T=15, I am on y=4, I choose U, then y_{16} =5.\n\nAt turn T=16, I am on y=5.\n\nT=16, row 5: since unsafe only at T=14, T=16 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nFrom y=5 to y=6 at T=16: at T=16 on y=5, choose U, y_{17}=6.\n\nT=17 on y=6, safe since row 6 unsafe only at T=14.\n\nSimilarly, T=17 to y=7: y_{18}=7.\n\nT=18 on y=7, safe.\n\nThen to y=8: y_{19}=8.\n\nT=19 on y=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=9: at T=19 on y=8, choose U, y_{20}=9.\n\nAt turn T=20, I am on y=9, and since y=9 has no cars, I have reached.\n\nNow, let's list the turns:\n\nStart: T=13, y=3, safe.\n\nAction at T=13: I need to choose what to do.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=13, I stayed? In my plan:\n\nAt T=13, I am on y=3.\n\nIf I choose S (stay), then at T=14, I am still on y=3.\n\nThen at T=14, on y=3, choose U, so y_{15} =4.\n\nAt T=15, on y=4.\n\nChoose U, y_{16}=5.\n\nT=16, on y=5.\n\nU, y_{17}=6.\n\nT=17, on y=6.\n\nU, y_{18}=7.\n\nT=18, on y=7.\n\nU, y_{19}=8.\n\nT=19, on y=8.\n\nU, y_{20}=9.\n\nT=20, on y=9, done.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1, so actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=13, actions from a_{13} to a_{13+H-1}, and at turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at T=20, y=9, which is turn 20.\n\nt1 + H -1 =20, t1=13, so 13 + H -1 =20, so 12 + H =20, H=8.\n\nTurns: from T=13 to T=20, that's 8 turns? T=13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20: that's 8 turns.\n\nActions at T=13 to T=19, since at T=19 I choose action to go to y=20=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: at each turn, I choose the action that determines the next position.\n\nAt turn T, I choose a_T, which affects y_{T+1}.\n\nIn the state, at turn T, I am at y_T, choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + delta.\n\nAnd at turn T, collision depends on y_T.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt T=13: I am at y=3, I need to choose a_{13}.\n\nIn my plan, at T=13, I stay, so a_{13} = S.\n\nThen at T=14, I am at y=3 (since I stayed), then I choose a_{14} = U, so y_{15} =4.\n\nAt T=15, I am at y=4, choose a_{15} = U, y_{16}=5.\n\nAt T=16, y=5, a_{16}=U, y_{17}=6.\n\nT=17, y=6, a_{17}=U, y_{18}=7.\n\nT=18, y=7, a_{18}=U, y_{19}=8.\n\nT=19, y=8, a_{19}=U, y_{20}=9.\n\nNow, at turn T=20, I am at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nThe last action was at T=19, to go to y=20=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=13 to t=19, that's 7 actions: a13 to a19.\n\nH is the number of turns, which should include from start to end.\n\nThe player position changes from turn to turn.\n\nAt turn t1=13, position is (0,3)\n\nAfter actions, at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9)\n\nIn this case, at turn 20, position is (0,9), and t1 + H -1 =20, 13 + H -1 =20, so H=8.\n\nThe actions are from turn 13 to turn 19, 7 actions.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is turn 20.\n\nIn the sequence, I started at T=13 y=3, after actions, at T=20 y=9.\n\nNow, in this sequence, I used 7 actions: S at T=13, then U from T=14 to T=19.\n\nT=13: S, T=14: U, T=15: U, ..., T=19: U.\n\nThat's one S and six U, but from y=3 to y=9, I need to increase by 6, so six U moves, but I had an extra stay at the beginning.\n\nIn terms of turns, from T=13 to T=20, 8 turns.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nFor example, can I go up at T=13?\n\nAt T=13, if I choose U, then y_{14}=4, but at T=14 I am on y=4, which is unsafe, collide.\n\nSo I cannot.\n\nIf I go down, to y=2, but that might not help.\n\ny=2 is row 2, which is safe at T=13 and T=14, since unsafe only T=16-19.\n\nBut if I go to y=2 at T=14, then I need to come back up, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at T=13, choose D, then y_{14}=2.\n\nAt T=14, on y=2, safe (since row 2 safe at T=14).\n\nThen I can go up to y=3 at T=15, but y=3 at T=15 is safe, but then I'm back to y=3, same as before but later.\n\nThen from there go up, but I reach later.\n\nFor instance: T=13: D, y14=2\n\nT=14: on y=2, choose U, y15=3\n\nT=15: on y=3, choose U, y16=4\n\nBut at T=16, on y=4: T=16, row 4 safe? Yes, as before.\n\nThen continue up, but now I have extra turns: from T=15 y=3 to T=16 y=4, etc., to reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example, similar to before but started by going down and up, so more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nI could go directly to row 5 or something.\n\nBut to go to row 5, I need to be on row 4 first or row 6, but I have to go through adjacent.\n\nAnother idea: since row 4 is safe from T=15, but row 5-8 are all safe except T=14, which is past.\n\nT=14 is the only unsafe time for them.\n\nIn my first plan, I went to y=4 at T=15, which is fine.\n\nBut can I go faster?\n\nFor example, if I can be on row 4 earlier, but row 4 unsafe at T=13 and 14, so I cannot be on it before T=15.\n\nT=15 is the earliest I can be on row 4.\n\nThen from there, I go up each turn to y=5 at T=16, y=6 at T=17, etc., to y=9 at T=20.\n\nIs there a way to skip or something? No, I have to visit each row sequentially if I go up directly.\n\nI could go to y=5 directly from y=3? But I can only move to adjacent y, so from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4. Not directly to 5.\n\nSo I must go through y=4 to reach y=5.\n\nSimilarly, I must visit y=4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\nThe minimal path must include these rows, and I need to be on each at a safe time.\n\nNow, for row 4, I need to be on it at some T between 15 and 21.\n\nIn my plan, T=15.\n\nSimilarly, for row 5, I need to be on it when not T=14.\n\nIn my plan, T=16.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 at T=17, row 7 at T=18, row 8 at T=19.\n\nAll safe.\n\nCan I be on row 5 earlier? For example, at T=15.\n\nBut to be on row 5 at T=15, I need to have moved to it.\n\nAt T=14, I need to be on y=4 or y=6 to move to y=5 at T=14 action? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T=14, I am on some y, choose a_{14}, then y_{15} set.\n\nTo be on y=5 at T=15, that means at T=14, I was on y=4 or y=5 or y=6, and chose action to go to y=5.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nIf at T=14 I am on y=4 and choose U, then y_{15}=5.\n\nOr on y=5 and choose S, y_{15}=5.\n\nOr on y=6 and choose D, y_{15}=5.\n\nBut at T=14, row 5 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=5 at T=14.\n\nTherefore, I cannot choose to stay on y=5 at T=14.\n\nIf I am on y=4 at T=14, but row 4 is unsafe at T=14, so I cannot be on y=4 at T=14 either.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=6 at T=14, row 6 is unsafe at T=14, so also cannot.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on row 5 at T=15, because to be there, I must have been on an adjacent row at T=14 and moved, but all adjacent rows are unsafe at T=14, so I cannot be on them at T=14 to make the move.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on row 5 at T=15.\n\nSimilarly, for any row, at T=14, rows 4,5,6,7,8 are all unsafe except possibly others, but row 4 unsafe, row 5-8 unsafe at T=14.\n\nRow 1,2,3 are safe at T=14, but they are not adjacent to row 5 except row 4.\n\nBut row 4 is unsafe.\n\nSo indeed, I cannot be on row 5 at T=15.\n\nThe earliest I can be on row 5 is T=15? T=15 is turn 15.\n\nAt T=15, I can be on row 5 only if I came from T=14.\n\nBut at T=14, I cannot be on y=4,5,6 to move to y=5 at T=15.\n\nSince I cannot be on any of rows 4,5,6 at T=14, I cannot be in position to have y_{15}=5.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on row 5 at T=15.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on row 5 until at least T=15? T=15 is impossible as above.\n\nT=16: can I be on row 5 at T=16?\n\nAt T=15, I need to be on y=4 or y=5 or y=6, and choose action to go to y=5.\n\nAt T=15, row 4 is safe (since T=15), row 5 is safe (T=15 not 14), row 6 is safe.\n\nSo I can be on, say, y=4 at T=15, choose U, then y_{16}=5.\n\nOr on y=6 at T=15, choose D, y_{16}=5.\n\nOr on y=5 at T=15, choose S, y_{16}=5.\n\nBut at T=15, row 5 is safe, so possible.\n\nSimilarly, in my first plan, I am on y=4 at T=15, choose U, y_{16}=5.\n\nNow, back to minimal H.\n\nIn my first plan, I reach y=9 at T=20.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on row 4 at T=15, which I am.\n\nThen from there, can I go faster to higher rows?\n\nBut I have to move one by one.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 8 earlier or something.\n\nBut row 8 is safe except T=14, so I can be on it at T=13? But I start at y=3, not 8.\n\nTo reach row 8, I need to go through rows.\n\nThe constraining point is row 4, which I can only start from T=15.\n\nThen from T=15 on y=4, I go to y=5 at T=16, y=6 at T=17, y=7 at T=18, y=8 at T=19, y=9 at T=20.\n\nEach step takes one turn, so I need 5 turns from y=4 to y=9, but I reach y=4 at T=15, so y=9 at T=20.\n\nCan I reach y=4 earlier? No, because before T=15, row 4 is unsafe.\n\nT=14 and earlier unsafe.\n\nSo T=15 is earliest for row 4.\n\nThen the up moves take 5 turns to go from 4 to 9.\n\nBut I started at y=3 at T=13.\n\nIn between, from T=13 to T=15, I have two turns: T=13 and T=14.\n\nIn my plan, I spent them both on y=3: at T=13 I stayed, so at T=14 still on y=3.\n\nThen at T=14 I go up to y=4 at T=15.\n\nCould I have used one of these turns to go up partially?\n\nFor example, at T=13, instead of staying, can I go to y=4? But cannot, unsafe.\n\nGo to y=2? But then I might come back, but that would take extra turns.\n\nFor instance, suppose at T=13, I go down to y=2.\n\nThen at T=14, on y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen at T=14, I can choose to go up to y=3, so y_{15}=3.\n\nThen at T=15, on y=3, then go to y=4 at T=16? Let's see:\n\nT=13: choose D, y_{14}=2\n\nT=14: on y=2, choose U, y_{15}=3\n\nT=15: on y=3, choose U, y_{16}=4\n\nT=16: on y=4, choose U, y_{17}=5\n\n...\n\nThen to y=9 at T=21? Later.\n\nCompared to first plan where I reached y=4 at T=15, here at T=16, so one turn later.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt T=14 on y=2, I could go directly to y=3, same as above.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 5-8 are only unsafe at T=14, and safe otherwise, perhaps I can be on them at T=13 or something, but I start at y=3.\n\nFor example, to be on y=5 at T=13, but I am at y=3, impossible in one turn.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think the first plan is optimal: stay at y=3 for T=13 and T=14, then go up each turn to y=9 at T=20.\n\nBut at T=13, I stay, so y=3 at T=14.\n\nThen at T=14, I go up, so y_{15}=4.\n\nNow, in terms of H, from start turn t1=13 to end turn t1+H-1=20, so H=8.\n\nThe sequence of actions: for turns 13 to 19.\n\na_{13}: S (since stay at y=3)\n\na_{14}: U (to y=4)\n\na_{15}: U (to y=5)\n\na_{16}: U (to y=6)\n\na_{17}: U (to y=7)\n\na_{18}: U (to y=8)\n\na_{19}: U (to y=9)\n\nAnd at turn 20, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, I need to confirm that at each step, no collision.\n\nAt T=13: y=3, row 3, safe as per earlier.\n\nT=14: y=3, row 3, safe.\n\nT=15: y=4, row 4, safe (T=15)\n\nT=16: y=5, row 5, safe (not T=14)\n\nT=17: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nT=18: y=7, row 7, safe\n\nT=19: y=8, row 8, safe\n\nT=20: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a way with H smaller?\n\nSuppose H=7, then t1+H-1=13+7-1=19, so at turn 19, y=9.\n\nThat means I need to reach y=9 at turn 19.\n\nStarting from y=3 at turn 13, I need to increase y by 6 in 6 turns? From turn 13 to turn 19, that's 6 actions? Turns: from T=13 to T=19, that's 7 positions, but actions from T=13 to T=18? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAt turn 13, y=3.\n\nAfter actions, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nThe actions are chosen at turns 13 to 18, for 6 actions.\n\ny changes from 3 to 9, delta=6, so I need exactly 6 up moves, no down or stay.\n\nSo actions must be all U from T=13 to T=18.\n\nThen y_{14}=4, y_{15}=5, y_{16}=6, y_{17}=7, y_{18}=8, y_{19}=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt T=13: y=3, row 3, safe.\n\nT=14: y=4, row 4, but row 4 unsafe at T=14, collide.\n\nTherefore, impossible to have y=4 at T=14.\n\nHence, cannot reach in 7 turns.\n\nIf I have a stay or down, it would take more turns to increase y, so H would be larger.\n\nThus, minimal H is 8.\n\nIn the sequence, I have one stay at the beginning.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I have a_{13}=S.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the plan, actions from turn 13 to 19.\n\na_{13}: S\n\na_{14}: U\n\na_{15}: U\n\na_{16}: U\n\na_{17}: U\n\na_{18}: U\n\na_{19}: U\n\nIn the sequence, a_{t} for t from t1 to t1+H-1, which is 13 to 19.\n\nH=8, so t from 13 to 13+7=20? t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThe answer format: {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1} = a_{13}\n\nt=1, a_{14}, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9)\n\nIn this case, t1=13, H=8, so actions at t=0 to 7: a_{13} to a_{20}? t1 + t for t=0 to 7: t=0: a13, t=1: a14, ..., t=7: a20\n\nBut at turn t1 + H -1 =13+8-1=20, position should be (0,9)\n\nNow, the action at turn T affects y_{T+1}, but the position at turn T is before action or after?\n\nIn the game dynamics, at turn T, the player is at position, then chooses action, which determines the next position.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, it depends on the position at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, when I specify action at turn T, it is chosen based on current position.\n\nBut at the end, after all actions, at turn t1+H-1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, for H=8, actions from a13 to a20.\n\na20 is chosen at turn 20, which would affect y21, but we don't care, since we reach y=9 at turn 20.\n\nIn the action sequence, up to a_{t1+H-1}, which is a20.\n\nBut at turn 20, I am already at y=9, so if I choose an action, it might move me away, but the position at turn 20 is (0,9), which is the goal.\n\nThe action at turn 20 is not necessary for reaching, but since we specify actions up to when we reach, I think we include the action only if it changes to the next, but in this case, at turn 20, position is already (0,9), so I don't need to choose an action; I have reached.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nLet me read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions are chosen at turns from t1 to t1 + H -1, inclusive.\n\nFor each of these turns, I choose an action, which determines the position for the next turn, but the position at that turn is given or from previous.\n\nStart: at turn t1, position is given.\n\nThen I choose a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1 +1}\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position is y_{t1+1}, choose a_{t1+1}, and so on, up to turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, I choose an action, but since I am at (0,9), I might choose any, but the position at that turn is (0,9).\n\nThe action at turn t1 + H -1 affects y_{t1 + H}, but we don't care, as long as at turn t1+H-1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn terms of the sequence, I need to specify the actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn my earlier plan, with H=8:\n\nt1 + H -1 =13+8-1=20.\n\nSo actions at turns 13 to 20.\n\nBut at turn 20, position is (0,9), which is the goal.\n\nNow, what action do I choose at turn 20? It doesn't matter, since I have reached. I can choose S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, for the actions to reach, the last action that matters is at turn 19, which sets y20=9.\n\nThen at turn 20, I am at y=9, so for the action at turn 20, I can put anything, say S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nIn my action list, I have actions from a13 to a19 to set positions up to y20.\n\nThen at a20, I need to specify, but since position at turn 20 is already set, and I choose a20 which affects y21, but we don't care.\n\nSo for the sequence, I can include a20 with S or U, etc.\n\nBut to be consistent, let's list.\n\nIn the minimal path, with H=8, actions:\n\nAt turn 13: choose S, so y14=3 (since stay)\n\nAt turn 14: choose U, y15=4\n\nAt turn 15: choose U, y16=5\n\nAt turn 16: choose U, y17=6\n\nAt turn 17: choose U, y18=7\n\nAt turn 18: choose U, y19=8\n\nAt turn 19: choose U, y20=9\n\nNow, at turn 20: position (0,9), reached.\n\nFor the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1=7: a13 to a19? t=0: a13, t=1: a14, ..., t=7: a20?\n\nt from 0 to 7, that's 8 actions: a13 to a20.\n\nBut at turn 20, I need to choose an action, but since position is already (0,9), I can choose, say, S.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions only up to a19 to set y20.\n\nBut for turn t1+H-1=20, I must include an action in the sequence.\n\nI can set a20 to S, for example.\n\nThen y21=9, but not necessary.\n\nSimilarly, in the position, at turn 20, it is (0,9) regardless.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\na13: S\n\na14: U\n\na15: U\n\na16: U\n\na17: U\n\na18: U\n\na19: U\n\na20: S (or whatever)\n\nBut in terms of the actions, a19: U sets y20=9.\n\nThen a20: S keeps it, but since we don't care beyond, it's fine.\n\nI could have a20: U, but y=9, cannot go up, so if I choose U, y21=min(9+1,9)=9, same as S.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be fine.\n\nNow, back to the row 4 third car, which is unsafe at T=22,23,24, but in my plan, I am done by T=20, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all safe.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I go faster, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thought: at T=13, I stay, but maybe I can go to y=4 at T=15 directly, but I have to go through T=14.\n\nNo.\n\nSuppose at T=13, I go down to y=2, but that delays.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think H=8 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = S (since t1=13)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\n...\n\nIn the format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: a_{13} = S\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U\nTurn 16: a_{16} = U\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n}\n\nBut H=8, so I need up to turn 20.\n\nt1 + H -1 =20, so actions up to a20.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1=7, so a13 to a20.\n\nSo I need to include a20.\n\na20: I can set to S.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: S\n\nBut at turn 20, position is already (0,9), and action S is fine.\n\nTo avoid extra, but I think it's required.\n\nIn the action sequence, a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, at turn 20, position is (0,9), so with a20=S, it stays, fine.\n\nI could have only 7 actions if I end at turn 19, but at turn 19, y=8 in my sequence, not 9.\n\nIn the all-up impossible case, at turn 19 y=9 only if I started earlier, but I can't.\n\nSo must have H=8.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut in the car state, for row 4, there was a second car (40,29,right,4), which I said never unsafe, but in the list, it was there, but I considered it.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8. The sequence of actions from turn 13 to turn 20 ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 20 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 13 + 8 - 1 = 20\\)) without any collisions.\n\n### Explanation of the Sequence:\n- **Turn 13 (current turn)**: The player is at (0, 3). Row 3 is safe at turn 13 (no car spans include x=0). Choosing \"S\" (stay) keeps the player at y=3 for turn 14.\n- **Turn 14**: The player is at (0, 3). Row 3 is safe at turn 14. Choosing \"U\" (up) moves the player to y=4 for turn 15.\n- **Turn 15**: The player is at (0, 4). Row 4 is safe at turn 15 (no car spans include x=0). Choosing \"U\" moves the player to y=5 for turn 16.\n- **Turn 16**: The player is at (0, 5). Row 5 is safe at turn 16 (no car spans include x=0). Choosing \"U\" moves the player to y=6 for turn 17.\n- **Turn 17**: The player is at (0, 6). Row 6 is safe at turn 17 (no car spans include x=0). Choosing \"U\" moves the player to y=7 for turn 18.\n- **Turn 18**: The player is at (0, 7). Row 7 is safe at turn 18 (no car spans include x=0). Choosing \"U\" moves the player to y=8 for turn 19.\n- **Turn 19**: The player is at (0, 8). Row 8 is safe at turn 19 (no car spans include x=0). Choosing \"U\" moves the player to y=9 for turn 20.\n- **Turn 20**: The player is at (0, 9), which is the goal. Since y=9 has no cars, it is always safe. Choosing \"S\" (stay) is arbitrary but valid, as the position is already reached.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Row 3 (y=3)**: Unsafe at turns 16–19, but safe at turns 13 and 14 (used in the sequence).\n- **Row 4 (y=4)**: Unsafe at turns 13, 14, 22–24, but safe at turns 15–21 (used at turn 15).\n- **Rows 5–8 (y=5 to y=8)**: Unsafe only at turn 14, but safe at all other turns (used at turns 16–19, all safe).\n- **y=9**: No cars, always safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H=8\\) turns, which is minimal because:\n- Reaching y=9 from y=3 requires at least 6 upward moves, but moving directly upward at turn 13 would place the player on row 4 at turn 14, which is unsafe. A stay at turn 13 is necessary to delay the move to row 4 until turn 15 (the earliest safe turn for row 4).\n- Any sequence with \\(H=7\\) would require reaching y=9 by turn 19, but this forces an upward move at turn 13 (to y=4 at turn 14), resulting in a collision on row 4 at turn 14. Thus, \\(H=7\\) is impossible.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: a_{13} = S \\\\\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U \\\\\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U \\\\\nTurn 16: a_{16} = U \\\\\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U \\\\\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U \\\\\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U \\\\\nTurn 20: a_{20} = S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 14, and the player is at (0,3). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). \n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nNote: The player's position at turn T is (0, y_T). When the player moves (U, D, S) at turn T, they update their position for the next turn. Specifically, after taking action at turn T, the new position is for turn T+1.\n\nAlso note: When moving from freeway i to j (by changing y), at the moment of the move (turn T) the player is still on the original freeway i. Then at turn T+1, they are on freeway j. Therefore, at turn T, we only check the freeway corresponding to y_T (the starting freeway of that turn). And at turn T+1, we check the freeway corresponding to y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are given the state of cars at turn t1=14. For future turns T (>=14), we can compute the car spans using the update rules.\n\nCar update:\n- For a left-moving car: span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- For a right-moving car: span at T is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the given cars have direction specified as \"right\" or \"left\"? In the table, we see only \"right\" in the example. However, the update rule for left-moving is provided too. But in the given data, all cars are \"right\". So we only use the right-moving update.\n\nAlso note: the span is given as (head, tail). For right-moving cars, the head is the front (so the car extends from tail to head, and as it moves right, both tail and head increase by s*(T-t1)). The problem states for right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] meaning that the tail becomes the leftmost and head the rightmost? Actually, in the initial state for a right-moving car, the span is given as (head, tail) but then the update rule uses [τ, h] as the initial span? \n\nLooking at the update rule for right-moving:\n  Initial: Span(t1) = [τ, h]   -> but in the table it's given as (head, tail). \n\nIn the table for freeway 4: (8, -3, right, 4). \n  So head=8, tail=-3? Then the initial span at t1=14 for this car is [τ, h] = [-3, 8]? \n\nBut note: the update rule says for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for freeway 4, at t1=14: \n  car1: τ=-3, h=8, s=4 -> so at T, the span is [-3 + 4*(T-14), 8 + 4*(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly, the other cars.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and there exists a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the span of that car at turn T.\n\nWe are to move from y=3 at turn 14 to y=9 at some turn. The minimal H is the minimal number of turns (including the starting turn? or the number of actions?).\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1? But in the answer, we start from turn t1. \n\nWe are to output actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... until the turn when we first reach y=9. Note that we must be at y=9 at the end of the last action. So if we start at y=3, we need to go up 6 units. Each U gives +1, D gives -1, S stays. \n\nBut we cannot go through freeways that have a car covering 0 at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nWe are to minimize H, the total number of turns (so the number of actions taken). The starting turn is t1=14, and we take actions at turns 14, 15, ... until we reach y=9 at the end of an action.\n\nNote: we are allowed to stay at y=0 or y=9 without being on a freeway? Actually, the freeways are from y=1 to 8. So when at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars? So no collision. But note: the goal is to be at (0,9). \n\nWe start at (0,3) at turn 14. Then we take an action at turn 14 that will lead to y15 = y14 + Δy (with constraints: must be in [0,9]). Then at turn 15 we are at (0,y15), and so on.\n\nWe need to avoid being at a freeway (y in [1,8]) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nSo for each freeway and each car on that freeway, we can compute for any turn T the span and check if 0 is in that span.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 14 onward. We have 6 steps to climb (minimum) if we go straight up without waiting. But we might have to wait because of cars.\n\nLet's analyze the cars on each freeway at the starting turn t1=14.\n\nFreeways 1,2,3: each has one car: (-6, -17, right, 3). \n  Since it's right-moving, at turn T: \n      span = [-17 + 3*(T-14), -6 + 3*(T-14)]\n\n  We need to check when 0 is in this interval? \n      -17 + 3*(T-14) <= 0 <= -6 + 3*(T-14)\n\n  Solve: \n      -17 + 3*(T-14) <= 0  => 3*(T-14) <= 17 => T-14 <= 5.66 => T <= 19.66 -> T<=19\n      and 0 <= -6 + 3*(T-14) => 3*(T-14) >=6 => T-14>=2 => T>=16.\n\n  So for T in [16,19] (inclusive) the car on freeway 1 (and similarly 2,3) will have 0 in their span.\n\n  Therefore, on freeways 1,2,3, the player must avoid being there at turns 16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 4: has three cars: \n  car1: (8, -3, right, 4) -> initial span at T=14: [-3,8]? Actually, the update rule for right uses [τ, h] and τ is tail? But the table gives (head, tail) as (8,-3). So tail τ = -3, head h = 8? Then the initial span is [-3,8]. \n      At T: [-3+4*(T-14), 8+4*(T-14)]\n\n  Check for 0:\n      -3+4*(T-14) <= 0 <= 8+4*(T-14)\n\n      Left: -3+4*(T-14)<=0 => 4*(T-14)<=3 => T-14<=0.75 => T<=14.75 -> T<=14 (only at T=14? but T>=14)\n        At T=14: -3<=0<=8 -> true -> so T=14 is dangerous.\n\n      Then the next car: (44,33,right,4): \n          span at T: [33+4*(T-14), 44+4*(T-14)] -> 33+... and 44+... are both positive for T>=14? \n          At T=14: [33,44] -> 0 not in.\n          So not dangerous.\n\n      Third car: (-32,-43,right,4): \n          span at T: [-43+4*(T-14), -32+4*(T-14)]\n          Check: -43+4*(T-14) <= 0 <= -32+4*(T-14)\n          Left: -43+4*(T-14)<=0 => 4*(T-14)<=43 => T-14<=10.75 -> T<=24.75\n          Right: 0<=-32+4*(T-14) => 4*(T-14)>=32 => T-14>=8 => T>=22\n          So dangerous for T in [22,24] (since T must be integer: 22,23,24).\n\n  Therefore, freeway 4 is dangerous at T=14 and T=22,23,24.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (48,37,right,12)\n  First car: (0, -11) -> so tail τ=-11, head=0? Then initial span: [-11,0] at T=14? \n      At T: [-11+12*(T-14), 0+12*(T-14)]\n      Check for 0: \n          -11+12*(T-14) <= 0 <= 12*(T-14)\n          Left: -11+12*(T-14)<=0 => 12*(T-14)<=11 => T-14<=11/12 <1 -> T<=14.916 -> only T=14?\n          At T=14: -11<=0<=0 -> true? because 0 is at the head? so yes, 0 is included.\n\n          So at T=14, the car is covering [ -11, 0] -> includes 0.\n\n      Second car: (48,37) -> [37+12*(T-14), 48+12*(T-14)] -> both positive at T=14 and beyond -> safe.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 5 is dangerous at T=14.\n\n  But note: the player starts at turn 14 at y=3, which is not freeway 5. However, if we were to go to freeway 5 at turn 14? We are at y=3 at turn 14. So we are on freeway 3 at turn 14? \n\n  Actually, at turn 14, the player is at (0,3) -> so freeway 3. We must check freeway 3 at turn 14. \n\n  For freeway 3: car: (-6, -17, right, 3) -> at T=14: span = [-17+3*(0), -6+3*(0)] = [-17,-6] -> does not contain 0. So freeway 3 is safe at T=14.\n\n  But freeway 5 is dangerous at T=14, but we are not on freeway 5 at turn 14.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8: same as freeway 5? \n  They have the same cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (48,37,right,12). So same analysis: at T=14, the first car on each of these freeways has a span [-11,0] at T=14 -> so 0 is included. Therefore, freeways 5,6,7,8 are dangerous at T=14.\n\nBut note: at turn 14, the player is at y=3 (freeway 3) which is safe. Then we take an action at turn 14 that will lead to a new y at turn 15.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 5,6,7,8 at turn 14? But we are not on them. However, if we move to one of them at turn 14? Actually, we cannot move to a freeway at the same turn? We are at freeway 3 at turn 14. Then at turn 15, we will be at a new y.\n\nSo the danger at turn 14 only matters for the freeway we are currently on (freeway 3) which is safe.\n\nNow, what about future turns? We must avoid freeways 1,2,3 during turns 16,17,18,19 (because of the cars there) and freeway 4 at turns 14 (already passed) and 22,23,24, and freeways 5,6,7,8 at turn 14 (we are past that) but what about later?\n\nFor freeways 5,6,7,8: \n  First car: (0, -11, right, 12) -> at T: [-11+12*(T-14), 12*(T-14)] \n      We found it dangerous at T=14. \n      When else? \n          The span moves to the right. After T=14, the left end is -11+12*(T-14). \n          We need 0 to be in [left, right] = [-11+12*(T-14), 12*(T-14)]\n          Conditions:\n            left <= 0 -> -11+12*(T-14) <=0 -> 12*(T-14)<=11 -> T-14<=11/12 -> T<=14.916 -> so only T=14.\n          And right>=0 -> 12*(T-14)>=0 -> always for T>=14.\n\n      So only dangerous at T=14.\n\n  Second car: never dangerous.\n\nSo freeways 5,6,7,8 are only dangerous at T=14. Since we are at turn 14 and not on these, they are safe for any future turn.\n\nTherefore, the dangerous intervals are:\n  Freeways 1,2,3: turns 16,17,18,19\n  Freeway 4: turns 22,23,24\n  Freeways 5,6,7,8: only turn 14 (which we have passed for these freeways because we are not on them at 14)\n\nSo we only have to worry about freeways 1,2,3 during 16-19 and freeway 4 during 22-24.\n\nOur plan: we start at y=3 at turn 14. We want to go to y=9. The minimal steps without obstacles is 6 steps (all U). But we have to avoid freeways 1,2,3 during turns 16-19. \n\nNote: we are at freeway 3 at turn 14. Then we move. We can choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway 1,2, or 3 at turns 16,17,18,19. So if we are still on freeway 1,2,3 at turn 16,17,18,19, we are in danger.\n\nWe can try to get out of freeways 1-3 as quickly as possible. For example, if we go up: \n  Turn14: at y=3 -> we take U -> at turn15: y=4 -> freeway4? \n  Then at turn15 we are on freeway4. \n\nBut we must check freeway4 at turn15: \n  For freeway4, we have cars. We computed that freeway4 is dangerous at T=14 (which we passed) and T=22,23,24. At T=15: \n      car1: [-3+4*(15-14), 8+4*(15-14)] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n      car2: [33+4,44+4]=[37,48] -> safe.\n      car3: [-43+4, -32+4] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway4 is safe at turn15.\n\nThen we can continue up: \n  Turn15: at y=4 -> take U -> turn16: y=5 -> freeway5? \n  But freeway5 is only dangerous at T=14 -> so at T=16 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up until y=9.\n\nBut note: at turn16 we are at y=5 (freeway5) and we have to avoid freeways1-3 at turn16? We are not on freeways1-3 at turn16, so safe.\n\nSo the plan: \n  Turn14: U -> y=4 at turn15 -> freeway4 (safe at T=15)\n  Turn15: U -> y=5 at turn16 -> freeway5 (safe because freeway5 only dangerous at T=14, and now T=16)\n  Turn16: U -> y=6 at turn17 -> freeway6 (safe at T=17? same as freeway5: only dangerous at T=14 -> safe)\n  Turn17: U -> y=7 at turn18 -> freeway7 (safe)\n  Turn18: U -> y=8 at turn19 -> freeway8 (safe)\n  Turn19: U -> y=9 at turn20 -> goal.\n\nSo we reach at turn20? But wait: we started at turn14, and we take 6 actions: turns14,15,16,17,18,19 -> 6 actions, and at the end of turn19 we are at y=9. So H=6 turns? \n\nBut let's check the turns when we are on freeways that are dangerous:\n\nAt turn16: we are at y=5 -> freeway5 -> not in {1,2,3} -> safe.\nAt turn17: y=6 -> freeway6 -> safe.\nAt turn18: y=7 -> freeway7 -> safe.\nAt turn19: y=8 -> freeway8 -> safe.\n\nBut what about freeway4? We were on freeway4 at turn15 (safe) and then moved to freeway5 at turn16. We don't need to worry about freeway4 after that.\n\nHowever, we must check freeway5,6,7,8 at the turns we are on them? We said they are only dangerous at T=14. But let me double-check for freeway5 at T=16:\n\n  First car: (0, -11, right, 12) -> at T=16: \n      span = [-11 + 12*(16-14), 0 + 12*(16-14)] = [-11+24, 24] = [13,24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n  Similarly, freeway6,7,8: same.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: we have to avoid freeways1-3 during turns16-19. We are not on them, so safe.\n\nBut what if we get to y=9 earlier? We start at y=3. The minimal steps is 6. We are doing 6 steps. So that's minimal.\n\nBut note: we are going through freeways 4,5,6,7,8. We have checked they are safe at the times we are there.\n\nBut freeway4 has a dangerous period at turns22,23,24. We are passing freeway4 at turn15, which is well before 22 -> safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\n\nWe reach y=9 at turn19? Actually, after the last action (at turn19) we move to y=9. So at turn20 we would be at y=9? \n\nBut note: \n  At turn14: we are at y=3. After action at turn14 (U), we go to y=4 at turn15.\n  At turn15: we are at y=4. After action at turn15 (U), we go to y=5 at turn16.\n  ...\n  At turn19: we are at y=8. After action at turn19 (U), we go to y=9 at turn20.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn20. Therefore, we need to output actions from turn14 to turn19 (6 actions). \n\nBut the problem says: we are to output until we reach (0,9) at the end of an action. So the last action is at turn19 and then we are at y=9 at turn20. \n\nBut the answer format is to list the actions for the turns: turn14, turn15, ... until the last action that gets us to y=9. \n\nWe have to check: at turn19 we take an action and then at the next state (turn20) we are at y=9. So we do not need to take an action at turn20.\n\nSo the sequence is 6 actions: turns14 to 19.\n\nBut wait: what if we can do it in fewer than 6? We start at y=3. We need to get to y=9: 6 steps up. So 6 is the minimum. \n\nBut note: we can also go down? But that would take more steps. So 6 is minimal.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that we are not forced to wait because of the dangerous intervals. But in the above, we avoid the dangerous freeways 1-3 during 16-19 by being above them.\n\nBut what if we had to go through freeway3 at turn16? Then we would have to avoid. But we are above freeway3 by turn16.\n\nBut let me check: \n  turn14: y=3 -> freeway3 at T=14 (safe)\n  turn15: y=4 -> freeway4 at T=15 (safe)\n  turn16: y=5 -> freeway5 at T=16 (safe)\n\nAnd freeway3 at T=16 is dangerous? yes, but we are not on freeway3 at T=16. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, we are clear.\n\nBut wait: what about the car on freeway4 at T=15? We checked and it is safe.\n\nSo the plan is valid.\n\nBut note: the problem says that at turn T, when we take an action, we update to y_{T+1}. So we are never on freeway4 at turn15? \n\nActually: \n  At the start of turn14, we are at y=3 (freeway3). \n  We take action at turn14: U -> so at the next state (turn15) we are at y=4.\n\nTherefore, at turn15, we are on freeway4. So we must check freeway4 at turn15 -> we did: safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn16, we are at y=5 (freeway5) -> and we checked freeway5 at turn16: safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, and the actions are:\n\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\n\nBut wait: what if we can do it in 5 steps? That would require moving up by 6 in 5 steps? But each step moves at most 1. So 6 steps are minimal.\n\nAlternatively, if we could go up 2 at a time? But the moves are only +1, -1, 0. So no.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the dangerous freeways 1-3 at turns16-19 by a different route? We don't need to because we are above them.\n\nHowever, what if we tried to go down? That would take more steps. \n\nBut note: we must also avoid freeway4 at turns22-24. But we are long past freeway4 by turn22? We are at turn20 at y=9. So we are done by turn20, which is before 22. So no problem.\n\nBut what if we had to wait? We didn't have to.\n\nAnother thing: what about freeway0 or freeway9? They are not freeways (freeways are 1-8) so no cars. So if we go to y=0, we are safe, but that's away from the goal. Similarly, y=9 is the goal and safe.\n\nTherefore, the above plan is minimal and safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway5 at turn16:\n\n  Freeway5: two cars at turn16 (T=16, t1=14 -> T-t1=2)\n      car1: (0, -11, right, 12) -> but the update: \n          We have to use the update rule: for right-moving: \n          Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] \n          But what are τ and h? The table gives (head, tail) = (0, -11). \n\n          For a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost? So the car extends from tail (left) to head (right). \n          Therefore, at T: [ -11 + 12*2, 0 + 12*2 ] = [-11+24, 24] = [13,24] -> 0 not included.\n\n      car2: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+24, 48+24] = [61,72] -> safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 6,7,8: same.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway4 at turn15: \n  car1: (head=8, tail=-3) -> [ -3 + 4*(15-14), 8+4*(15-14) ] = [1,12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n\nTherefore, we output the 6 U actions.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1. So t0 corresponds to t1, t1 corresponds to t1+1, ... until t=H-1 which is t1+H-1. \n\nWe have H=6, so we output actions for t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3, t1+4, t1+5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn19 (which is t1+5) and then at turn20 we are at y=9.\n\nSo we are done.\n\nBut wait: what if we try to go faster? We can't. So this is minimal.\n\nAlternatively, if we could skip some freeways? But we have to go through 4,5,6,7,8 to get from 3 to 9. \n\nOne more thing: we could potentially go down to y=0 and then go up? But that would take more steps: \n  down from 3 to 0: 3 steps down, then up 9 steps -> total 12 steps. Worse.\n\nOr wait at some freeway? But we don't need to.\n\nSo we are confident.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal. The analysis of car movements and collision conditions shows that moving upward continuously avoids all dangerous freeways during critical turns:\n\n- **Dangerous intervals**:\n  - Freeways 1, 2, 3: Dangerous at turns 16, 17, 18, 19 (due to cars covering position 0).\n  - Freeway 4: Dangerous at turns 14, 22, 23, 24.\n  - Freeways 5, 6, 7, 8: Dangerous only at turn 14 (safe for turns ≥ 15).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3) at turn 14, which is safe. By moving upward each turn:\n- Turn 14: Move to \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4) at turn 15. Freeway 4 is safe at turn 15 (span [1, 12] for car 1, no 0).\n- Turn 15: Move to \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5) at turn 16. Freeway 5 is safe at turn 16 (span [13, 24] for car 1, no 0).\n- Turn 16: Move to \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6) at turn 17. Freeway 6 is safe at turn 17 (similar to freeway 5).\n- Turn 17: Move to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7) at turn 18. Freeway 7 is safe at turn 18.\n- Turn 18: Move to \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8) at turn 19. Freeway 8 is safe at turn 19.\n- Turn 19: Move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20, reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence of 6 upward moves achieves the goal in the minimal number of turns (\\(H = 6\\)), avoiding all collisions. Freeways 1-3 are avoided during turns 16-19, and freeway 4 is avoided during turns 22-24 as the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) before turn 22.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n- Turn 14: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 4\\).\n- Turn 15: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 5\\).\n- Turn 16: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- Turn 17: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 7\\).\n- Turn 18: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- Turn 19: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0,4) at turn t1 = 15. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y-position by +1, -1, or 0, and must stay within y=0 to y=9.\n\nCollision occurs if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, the car spans include 0. Importantly, if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that new freeway until the next turn, so they only check collision for the current y at turn T.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states for each freeway at turn t1=15. I need to determine where the cars are at future turns to avoid when the player might be on that row.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn 15, and they move left or right with constant speed. The span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving cars, head is the front, and it moves left, so decreasing x. For right-moving, head is front, moving right, increasing x.\n\nIn the update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]  (since both decrease)\n\n- Right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]  (both increase)\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, head h is at the left? Let's see the initial spans.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-3, -14, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving, head should be the right end? I think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook at the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s dT, τ - s dT] where dT = T-t1\n\nBut in this, if it's left-moving, and [h, τ], with h and τ, which is head and tail? Probably head is the front, so for left-moving, front is left, so h should be smaller than τ? But here for freeway 1, it's (-3, -14, right, 3), h=-3, τ=-14, and since direction right, it should be moving right.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s dT, h + s dT]\"\n\nIn the description, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], with τ and h, but in the freeway listing, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for right-moving, head is the front, so for right-moving, front is at higher x, so in [τ, h], τ should be tail (left end), h should be head (right end).\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, in the update it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], so h is head, which for left-moving is left end.\n\nBut in the freeway listing, all cars have direction right except possibly, but in this case, all are right-moving? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: (-3, -14, right, 3) — since direction right, and (head, tail) given, so head = -3, tail = -14. Since moving right, head should be right end, but -3 > -14, so yes, head at x=-3, tail at x=-14, so the car spans from x=-14 to x=-3 at t=15, and since moving right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars: (12,1,right,4), (48,37,right,4), (-28,-39,right,4)\n\nFor (12,1,right,4): head=12, tail=1, so at t=15, from x=1 to x=12, moving right at speed 4.\n\nSimilarly, (48,37,right,4): from 37 to 48, moving right.\n\n(-28,-39,right,4): head=-28, tail=-39, from -39 to -28, moving right.\n\nFreeway 5: (12,1,right,12), (60,49,right,12) — both moving right at speed 12.\n\nFreeways 6,7,8 same as 5? Freeway 6,7,8 have same cars: (12,1,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5 also has (12,1,right,12), (60,49,right,12), yes.\n\nFreeway 4 has three cars.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 have one car each: (-3,-14,right,3)\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=4 to y=9, so must move up through y=5,6,7,8 to 9.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I assume. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe havens.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), so once at y=9, no need to worry about cars.\n\nCollision only when on y=1 to 8 and for that row, 0 in car span at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, player is on y_T, and actions change y for next turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t1. Set τ = 0 for simplicity, where τ is turns after t1.\n\nSo at τ=0 (turn t1=15), player at y=4.\n\nWe need to find actions a_τ for τ=0 to H-1, such that at some τ=H-1, y = 9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\ny_{τ} is position at turn t1 + τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, position changes to y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\nAt each turn τ, player has y_τ, and we need that if y_τ between 1 and 8, then for that freeway, 0 not in car span at turn t1 + τ.\n\nTurn T = t1 + τ.\n\nFor car positions, at turn T = t1 + τ, the span depends on τ.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway and for each τ, whether there is a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find when the span includes 0.\n\nFor a given freeway, at time τ (after t1), the car spans.\n\nFirst, let's handle each freeway separately.\n\nStart with freeway y=1:\n\nCars: only one car: head h=-3, tail τ=-14, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nSince right-moving, at time τ, position: tail position = τ + s * τ = -14 + 3τ\n\nHead position = h + s * τ = -3 + 3τ\n\nSpan: [tail + s τ, head + s τ] = [-14 + 3τ, -3 + 3τ]\n\nFor collision at x=0, we need 0 in [ -14 + 3τ, -3 + 3τ ]\n\nSo -14 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -3 + 3τ\n\nFirst inequality: -14 + 3τ ≤ 0 => 3τ ≤ 14 => τ ≤ 14/3 ≈ 4.666\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -3 + 3τ => 3τ ≥ 3 => τ ≥ 1\n\nSo for τ from 1 to 4 inclusive? τ integer since turns.\n\nτ ≥1 and τ ≤4.666, so τ=1,2,3,4.\n\nCheck:\n\nτ=1: span [-14+3, -3+3] = [-11,0], 0 is included? -11 ≤0≤0, yes, 0 is endpoint.\n\nτ=2: [-14+6, -3+6] = [-8,3], -8≤0≤3, yes.\n\nτ=3: [-14+9, -3+9] = [-5,6], yes.\n\nτ=4: [-14+12, -3+12] = [-2,9], -2≤0≤9, yes.\n\nτ=5: [-14+15, -3+15] = [1,12], 0<1? 0 not >=1, so 0 not in [1,12], no collision.\n\nτ=0: at τ=0, span [-14,-3], 0 not in, since -14 to -3, all negative.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision when player on y=1 at τ=1,2,3,4.\n\nNow freeway y=2: same as y=1, car (-3,-14,right,3), so identical to y=1. Collision at τ=1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly freeway y=3: same car, collision at τ=1,2,3,4.\n\nNow freeway y=4: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (12,1,right,4), (48,37,right,4), (-28,-39,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=12, tail=1, s=4, right-moving.\n\nAt τ, tail pos = 1 + 4τ, head pos = 12 + 4τ, span [1+4τ, 12+4τ]\n\n0 in span if 1+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ 12+4τ\n\nBut 1+4τ ≤0? Since τ≥0, 1+4τ ≥1 >0, so left end >0, so 0 not in [1+4τ, 12+4τ] for any τ, since min at τ=0 is [1,12], 0<1.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (48,37,right,4), span [37+4τ, 48+4τ], always positive, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-28,-39,right,4), head=-28, tail=-39, s=4.\n\nTail pos = -39 + 4τ, head pos = -28 + 4τ, span [-39+4τ, -28+4τ]\n\n0 in span if -39+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -28+4τ\n\nFirst: -39+4τ ≤0 => 4τ ≤39 => τ ≤ 39/4 = 9.75\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -28 +4τ => 4τ ≥28 => τ ≥7\n\nSo τ from 7 to 9 inclusive.\n\nτ=7: [-39+28, -28+28] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nτ=8: [-39+32, -28+32] = [-7,4], -7≤0≤4, yes.\n\nτ=9: [-39+36, -28+36] = [-3,8], yes.\n\nτ=10: [-39+40, -28+40] = [1,12], 0<1, no.\n\nSo for freeway 4, collision only from the third car, at τ=7,8,9 when on y=4.\n\nBut player starts at y=4 at τ=0, and at τ=0, what is car position? At τ=0, span [-39,-28], 0 not in, so safe at τ=0 on y=4.\n\nNow freeway y=5: cars (12,1,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=12, tail=1, s=12, right-moving.\n\nSpan [1+12τ, 12+12τ]\n\n0 in? 1+12τ ≤0? τ≥0, 1+12τ≥1>0, so never.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,12), span [49+12τ,60+12τ], always positive, never.\n\nSo for freeway 5, no car ever covers x=0, because both cars are to the right and moving right, so x>0 always. So freeway 5 is always safe at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=6: same as y=5, cars (12,1,right,12), (60,49,right,12), both with s=12, so span [1+12τ,12+12τ] and [49+12τ,60+12τ], all min x=1 at τ=0, so x=0 never covered. Always safe.\n\nFreeway y=7: same, identical to y=5 and 6, always safe.\n\nFreeway y=8: same, cars (12,1,right,12), (60,49,right,12), always safe at x=0.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all have no cars that cover x=0, so they are always safe to be on at any turn.\n\nIs that right? For y=5,6,7,8, the cars are at x=1 or more at τ=0, and moving right with high speed, so x=0 never occupied. Yes.\n\nNow, freeway y=1,2,3 have collision at τ=1,2,3,4\n\ny=4 has collision at τ=7,8,9\n\ny=5,6,7,8 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4 at τ=0.\n\nGoal is y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nPlayer can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, probably want to move up as much as possible, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nAt τ=0, y=4, which is safe since at τ=0, y=4 no collision.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe difference is 5, so minimum moves: if always move up, from y=4 to y=9, need 5 up moves, so H=5 turns, from τ=0 to τ=4, position at τ=4 should be y=9.\n\ny_τ at turn τ.\n\nAfter H actions, at τ=H, y_H is position.\n\nSet τ from 0 to H.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y_0 =4\n\nAt τ=H, we want y_H =9.\n\nMinimal H such that we can have a sequence with y_H=9.\n\nSince we can move up multiple times, minimal H is 5, if we can move up 5 times without collision.\n\nBut we need to check for each position when on rows 1-8, no collision.\n\nIn this case, when moving up from y=4.\n\nBut y=4 has collision at τ=7,8,9, but if we move fast, we might not be on y=4 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3 have collision at τ=1,2,3,4.\n\nBut we start at y=4, so we don't need to go to y=1,2,3 since we are going up to 9.\n\ny=4 to y=9, so we need to be on y=4,5,6,7,8 at some points.\n\nSpecifically, when we move from y to y+1, we are on y during the turn we move.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nSuppose at turn τ, we are at y_τ.\n\nWe take action a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nAt turn τ, we are on row y_τ, and we check collision for that row at time T = t1 + τ.\n\nIf we take action U, we move to y_{τ+1} = y_τ +1, so at turn τ, we are on y_τ, and at turn τ+1, on y_τ+1.\n\nSimilarly for D and S.\n\nTo go from y=4 to y=9, we need to increase y by 5, so we must have at least 5 U actions. Each U increases y by 1, D decreases, S no change. So net +5 needed, so minimal number of turns is 5, with all U, if possible.\n\nWith H turns, from τ=0 to τ=H-1 actions, position at τ=H.\n\ny_0 =4, after H actions, y_H.\n\nIf all U, y_H = y_0 + number of U.\n\nWe want y_H =9, so number of U minus number of D must be 5.\n\nSince S doesn't change, the net displacement must be +5.\n\nMinimal H is achieved when no S or D, all U, so H=5.\n\nBut we may need to delay or something to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, check if we can go directly up in 5 turns.\n\nStart τ=0, y=4, action a0.\n\nAfter a0, y1 = y0 + Δy0.\n\nAt each turn τ, y_τ must be safe if between 1 and 8.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are always safe, as we established.\n\ny=4 is safe except at τ=7,8,9.\n\nBut τ=7,8,9 are turns after t1, so at T= t1 + τ.\n\nt1=15, so τ=7 is T=22, etc.\n\nBut we are considering relative τ.\n\nNow, for the player:\n\nAt τ=0: y=4, which is safe since τ=0, freeway 4 no collision at τ=0.\n\nWe take action, say U, then at τ=1, y=5.\n\ny=5 is always safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, if we take U, y=6 at τ=2.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nU to y=7 at τ=3.\n\ny=7 safe.\n\nU to y=8 at τ=4.\n\ny=8 safe.\n\nU to y=9 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=9, which is goal, no car check.\n\nNow, during this, we were on:\n\nτ=0: y=4, safe\n\nτ=1: y=5, safe\n\nτ=2: y=6, safe\n\nτ=3: y=7, safe\n\nτ=4: y=8, safe\n\nτ=5: y=9, done.\n\nWe never on y=1,2,3, and on y=4 only at τ=0, which is safe, and y=5-8 always safe.\n\ny=4 collision at τ=7,8,9, but τ=0 is not 7,8,9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=1,2,3,4 we are on y=5,6,7,8, all safe.\n\nSo in 5 turns, we can reach y=9 at τ=5.\n\nBut τ from 0 to 5, with 5 actions: τ=0 to 4.\n\ny at τ=0:4, after a0, y1; after a1, y2; ... after a4, y5.\n\nWe want y5=9.\n\nWith actions: a0=U, y1=5\n\na1=U, y2=6\n\na2=U, y3=7\n\na3=U, y4=8\n\na4=U, y5=9\n\nNow, check positions at each turn:\n\nTurn τ=0 (T=15): y=4, freeway 4, at τ=0, no collision, safe.\n\nTurn τ=1 (T=16): y=5, freeway 5, always safe.\n\nTurn τ=2 (T=17): y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nTurn τ=3 (T=18): y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nTurn τ=4 (T=19): y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nTurn τ=5 (T=20): y=9, no freeway, done.\n\nNo collision at any point.\n\nAnd H=5 turns, with actions at τ=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut the sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1, I think.\n\nt1=15, actions at t=15,16,17,18,19, and position at t=20 is (0,9).\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions for turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions from t=15 to t=15+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=15+H, position y=9.\n\nIn terms of τ, τ=0 to H-1 actions, position at τ=H.\n\nWe want position at τ=H to be 9.\n\nWith H=5, τ=0,1,2,3,4 actions, position at τ=5.\n\nActions: a_{t1} = a_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19} all U.\n\nAnd we reach at t=20.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nEarlier I thought y=1,2,3 have collisions, but we don't go there, so fine.\n\ny=4 only at τ=0, safe.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 4, at τ=0, it's safe, and we leave immediately.\n\nCould there be a problem with other rows? No.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 4 at τ=0.\n\nFreeway 4 cars: at τ=0, spans: first car [1,12], not include 0; second [37,48], no; third [-39,-28], no, so yes.\n\nAnd we are not on y=4 at later times.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,4), which is on freeway y=4 at turn t1=15.\n\nAnd we move up.\n\nBut in the collision rule, when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and if we move to different y, we are not on that new y until next turn.\n\nIn this case, when we take U at τ=0, at turn τ=0, we are on y=4, then after action, at turn τ=1, we are on y=5.\n\nSo during turn τ=0, we are on y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, on y=5, safe, and so on.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? For example, if we stay or something, but since we can go directly in 5 turns, and it works, H=5 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me check if with H=4 possible? y_0=4, after 4 actions, y_4.\n\nMax y_4 can be 4+4=8 if all U, but we need y=9, so y_4=8<9, not reach. If we have some U and D, but net must +5, with 4 actions, max net +4, so y_4 <=8<9, cannot reach in 4 turns. Similarly, H=5 is minimum possible.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 5.\n\nAnd the sequence is all U.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +4: a_{t_1+4} = U\n\nWith t_1=15.\n\nBut let me write the turns.\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 20, position (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t=15 to t=19, H=5 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is there any car that could cause issue? For example, on y=5,6,7,8, we said always safe, but let me double-check freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5: cars (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nAt any τ, span [1+12τ,12+12τ] and [49+12τ,60+12τ], both min at least 1>0, so x=0 never covered. Similarly for others.\n\nFreeway 4 at τ=7,8,9 has collision, but we are not on it at those times.\n\nAt τ=0, we are on it, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to go down or something, but no need.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we stay at y=4 for some turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at τ=0, y=4, safe, but then we waste a turn, and later we might hit the collision at τ=7,8,9 if we stay too long, but in this case, since we leave immediately, it's fine.\n\nIf we go down to y=3, but y=3 has collision at τ=1,2,3,4, and we start at τ=0, y=4, if we go down at τ=0, to y=3 at τ=1, then at τ=1, y=3, which has collision at τ=1 (since for y=3, collision at τ=1,2,3,4), so at τ=1, on y=3, collision, not good.\n\nSimilarly, not beneficial.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nThus, minimal H=5, all U.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 4, there are multiple cars, but we considered the third one for collision at τ=7,8,9.\n\nBut at τ=0, safe.\n\nAlso, for y=1,2,3, but we avoid.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the player is at (0,4), and cars are on the freeway, but since we are at x=0, and cars move, but we only care when span includes x=0.\n\nIn this sequence, all good.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nt1=15, so actions from t=15 to t=15+H-1.\n\nH=5, so t=15 to 19.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t=0: a15, t=1: a16, ..., t=4: a19.\n\nAll U.\n\nAnd reach at t=20.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer, it doesn't ask for H, just the sequence.\n\nBut we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 4, there is a car (-28,-39,right,4), which at τ=0 is from -39 to -28, not at 0.\n\nAnd moves right.\n\nAt τ=7, it is at [-39+28, -28+28] = [-11,0], so at x=0, collision if on y=4.\n\nBut we not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Player Movement**: The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and must remain within \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\).\n- **Collision Condition**: A collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the car span on that freeway includes \\(x = 0\\) at turn \\(T\\). When the player moves to a different y-position at turn \\(T\\), they are not considered on the new freeway until turn \\(T+1\\), so collisions are only checked for the current \\(y_T\\).\n- **Car Positions and Collision Times**:\n  - **Freeways 1, 2, and 3**: Each has one car \\((-3, -14, \\text{right}, 3)\\). Collision occurs at relative turns \\(\\tau = T - t_1 = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) (i.e., turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)).\n  - **Freeway 4**: Has three cars. Only the car \\((-28, -39, \\text{right}, 4)\\) causes collisions at \\(\\tau = 7, 8, 9\\) (turns \\(T = 22, 23, 24\\)). At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn \\(T = 15\\)), freeway 4 is safe.\n  - **Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8**: Each has cars that are always at \\(x \\geq 1\\) for all \\(\\tau\\), so \\(x = 0\\) is never covered, and these freeways are always safe.\n- **Goal**: Reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 4\\) with minimal turns. The minimum number of turns required is 5, as a net increase of +5 in y-position is needed, and with all U actions, \\(y = 9\\) can be reached in 5 turns (actions at turns 15 to 19, position at turn 20).\n\n### Sequence Validity:\n- A sequence of 5 U actions is feasible:\n  - At turn 15 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)): Player at \\(y = 4\\). Freeway 4 is safe at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (no collision).\n  - At turn 16 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)): Player at \\(y = 5\\). Freeway 5 is always safe.\n  - At turn 17 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)): Player at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 is always safe.\n  - At turn 18 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)): Player at \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 is always safe.\n  - At turn 19 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)): Player at \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 is always safe.\n  - After the last action, at turn 20, player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is safe (no freeway).\n- No collisions occur, as the player avoids freeways 1, 2, and 3 entirely and is only on freeway 4 at \\(\\tau = 0\\), when it is safe.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 16, and the player is at (0,5). We need to get to (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the freeway at the end of the turn) and at that turn T, for the car on that freeway, the car's span (at turn T) contains 0.\n\nNote: The player moves at the same time as the cars. The player's movement is: \n  - U: y increases by 1 (up to 9)\n  - D: y decreases by 1 (down to 0)\n  - S: stay\n\nWe start at y=5 at turn 16.\n\nWe have to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8. Note that we are on freeway y at the end of the turn. So at turn T, if we end at y, then we check the cars on freeway y at turn T.\n\nThe cars are given for freeways 1 to 8. For each freeway, there are one or more cars. For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nImportant: The update of the car's position at turn T (from the initial state at turn t1=16) is:\n\nFor left-moving (but note: the direction is given as \"right\" or \"left\"? Actually, the problem says:\n  - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation in the table:\n\nFor freeway 4: (16,5,right,4) -> This is right-moving? But the span at t1 is given as (head, tail). For right-moving, the problem says that at t1 the span is [τ, h] meaning that τ is the leftmost and h is the rightmost? But the input gives (head, tail). \n\nActually, the problem states: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\". \n\nAnd for the update:\n  - If the car is right-moving, then the span at t1 is [τ, h] (so tail is the left end and head is the right end). Then at time T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n  - If left-moving, then at t1 the span is [h, τ] (so head is the left end and tail is the right end) and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So the first number in the tuple is the tail (left end) and the second is the head (right end) for a right-moving car? \n\nHowever, looking at the input:\n\nFreeway 1: (0, -11, right, 3) -> so if right, then at t1=16, the span is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]. Then at a future turn T, the span becomes [-11 + 3*(T-16), 0 + 3*(T-16)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: \n  - First car: (16,5,right,4) -> so at t1=16: [5, 16]? But wait, the input is (head, tail) = (16,5). How to interpret?\n\nThe problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\".\n\nBut for a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is the rightmost) and the tail is the back (leftmost). So the span is [tail, head] = [τ, h]. So for freeway 4, first car: h=16, τ=5, so [5,16] at t1=16.\n\nBut wait: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So that matches: τ=5, h=16 -> [5,16].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, the head would be the front (leftmost) and the tail the back (rightmost), so the span is [head, tail] = [h, τ].\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nFor a car (h, τ, d, s):\n  - If d is 'right': at time t, the car covers [τ + s*(t-t1), h + s*(t-t1)]\n  - If d is 'left': at time t, the car covers [h - s*(t-t1), τ - s*(t-t1)]\n\nWe are at turn t1=16. We are going to simulate from t=16 (current) to ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe start at y=5 at the beginning of turn 16. We choose an action for turn 16, then at the end of turn 16, we update the player's y and the cars.\n\nBut note: the collision condition at turn T: we are on freeway y_T (the y at the end of turn T) and we check if 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: The player is only on one freeway per turn (the one at the end of the turn). And when we move, we are not on the intermediate freeway during the turn. So if at turn T we start at y and move to y+1 (with action U), then at the end of turn T we are at y+1. During the turn, we are not on freeway y+1 until the end. Therefore, we only check the freeway we end on at turn T.\n\nOur goal: minimal H such that after H-1 actions (from t=16 to t=16+H-1) we end at y=9.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) to find the shortest path. The state can be (turn, y). But note that the turn number matters because the car positions change with time.\n\nWe are starting at turn 16, y=5.\n\nWe'll simulate for each possible action (U, D, S) and check the next state.\n\nBut note: the turn number increases by 1 for each step.\n\nWe need to check for collision at each step: at the end of the turn, we are at y, and we check the cars on freeway y at that turn.\n\nWe have to simulate the cars for the given turn.\n\nWe are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8 because if we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars. But note: we start at y=5 and we are trying to get to y=9. We cannot go above 9 or below 0.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So if we are at y=0 or y=9, no collision check.\n\nBut note: the goal is (0,9). At y=9, no cars, so we are safe.\n\nNow, let's compute the car positions for a given freeway and turn T (relative to t1=16).\n\nWe'll precompute the car spans for each freeway and each turn we might encounter. But note the turns: we are starting at 16 and we are going to simulate until we reach 9. The minimal H might be small (like 4 turns: 5->6->7->8->9) but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=0, τ=-11, d='right', s=3) -> at turn T, span = [-11 + 3*(T-16), 0 + 3*(T-16)]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (0, -11, right, 3) -> same: [-11+3*(T-16), 3*(T-16)]\n\nFreeway 3: same: [-11+3*(T-16), 3*(T-16)]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars:\n  car1: (16,5,right,4) -> [5+4*(T-16), 16+4*(T-16)]\n  car2: (52,41,right,4) -> [41+4*(T-16), 52+4*(T-16)]\n  car3: (-24,-35,right,4) -> [-35+4*(T-16), -24+4*(T-16)]\n\nFreeway 5: two cars:\n  car1: (24,13,right,12) -> [13+12*(T-16), 24+12*(T-16)]\n  car2: (-48,-59,right,12) -> [-59+12*(T-16), -48+12*(T-16)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? \n  (24,13,right,12) and (-48,-59,right,12) -> same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nSo freeways 1,2,3 are identical; freeways 5,6,7,8 are identical; freeway 4 has three cars.\n\nNow, we are at turn 16 at y=5. We are about to take an action for turn 16. Then at the end of turn 16, we will be at a new y (if we moved) and then we check the cars on that freeway at turn 16.\n\nBut note: the cars at turn 16 are given. So for freeway 5 at turn 16: \n  car1: [13,24] -> because at T=16: 13+12*(0)=13, 24+12*(0)=24 -> [13,24]\n  car2: [-59, -48] -> so 0 is not in [-59,-48] nor [13,24]. So freeway 5 at turn 16 is safe.\n\nHowever, we are at freeway 5 at the start? But we are at turn 16 and we are at y=5. We are going to take an action at turn 16. Then at the end of turn 16, we will be at y = 5 + (1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S). Then we check the freeway we end on at turn 16.\n\nSo if we choose S, we end at y=5. Then we check freeway 5 at turn 16: \n  freeway5: [13,24] and [-59,-48] -> 0 is not in either.\n\nIf we choose U, we end at y=6. Then we check freeway6 at turn 16: \n  freeway6: same as freeway5: [13,24] and [-59,-48] -> 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, D: end at y=4 -> check freeway4 at turn16: \n  freeway4: \n      car1: [5,16] -> 0 is not in [5,16]? 0 is less than 5 -> no.\n      car2: [41,52] -> 0 not in.\n      car3: [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn16, all three moves are safe? But we have to plan for the future.\n\nWe need the minimal H. So we can try to go up as fast as possible: 5->6->7->8->9 in 4 turns. But we must check each step.\n\nLet's check the path: \n  Turn16: start at y=5, then we do U -> y=6 at end of turn16 -> check freeway6 at turn16: safe (as above).\n  Turn17: at y=6, do U -> y=7 at end of turn17 -> check freeway7 at turn17: \n      freeway7: same as freeway5: at turn17 (T=17, so T-t1=1) -> \n          car1: [13+12*1, 24+12*1] = [25,36] -> 0 not in.\n          car2: [-59+12*1, -48+12*1] = [-47,-36] -> 0 not in.\n      safe.\n  Turn18: at y=7, do U -> y=8 at end of turn18 -> check freeway8 at turn18: \n      freeway8: same, at T=18 (T-t1=2):\n          car1: [13+24, 24+24] = [37,48] -> safe.\n          car2: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n  Turn19: at y=8, do U -> y=9 -> safe (no cars).\n\nSo that path is safe? Then H=4 (turns 16,17,18,19) and the actions are U, U, U, U.\n\nBut wait: we are at turn19 and we end at y=9. So the sequence is:\n  Turn16: U\n  Turn17: U\n  Turn18: U\n  Turn19: U\n\nBut let me double-check freeway4 at turn16: if we had gone down? But we didn't. However, in the above path we never used freeway4, but we did use freeway6,7,8 at turns 16,17,18.\n\nBut note: at turn16 we ended at y=6 (freeway6) and we checked freeway6 at turn16: safe.\n\nAt turn17 we ended at y=7 (freeway7) and we checked at turn17: safe.\n\nAt turn18 we ended at y=8 (freeway8) and we checked at turn18: safe.\n\nAt turn19 we end at y=9: safe.\n\nSo that seems safe. But is there a problem we missed?\n\nWhat about freeway5? We started at y=5 at the beginning of turn16, but we moved to y=6 at the end of turn16. So we were never at freeway5 at the end of a turn? Actually, at the end of turn16 we are at y=6, so we only check freeway6 at turn16.\n\nBut wait: what if we had stayed at freeway5? We don't because we moved.\n\nNow, what about the cars on freeway4? We never went to freeway4? So we don't care.\n\nBut let me check freeway4 at turn16: if we had stayed at y=5, then we would have to check freeway4? No: because if we stay at y=5, then we are on freeway5? Wait, the freeway index is the y-coordinate. So if we are at y=5, we are on freeway5? But the table says freeway4? \n\nThe freeways are by y: freeway1 is at y=1, freeway2 at y=2, ... freeway8 at y=8. So at y=5, we are on freeway5. The car data for freeway5 is given.\n\nSo in the input, the table:\n\n| Freeway k | ... |\n| 1 | ... |   -> this is for y=1\n| 2 | ... |   -> for y=2\n...\n| 8 | ... |   -> for y=8\n\nTherefore, if we are at y=5, we look at freeway5.\n\nSo in the above, when we ended at y=6, we checked freeway6.\n\nBut note: the input for freeway4 is for y=4, freeway5 for y=5, etc.\n\nSo our path is:\n\nTurn16: from y=5 (beginning) to y=6 (end) -> check freeway6 at turn16: safe.\nTurn17: from y=6 to y=7 -> check freeway7 at turn17: safe.\nTurn18: from y=7 to y=8 -> check freeway8 at turn18: safe.\nTurn19: from y=8 to y=9 -> no check.\n\nBut wait, at turn16 we started at y=5 and then we moved to y=6. We did not check freeway5 at turn16? Because we ended at y=6. And we are only checked at the freeway we end on.\n\nSo the above path seems safe.\n\nBut why then are there multiple cars? And why are there cars on freeway4? Maybe if we try to go down? But we are going up.\n\nBut let me check if there is any danger on the upward path? We saw that at turn16,17,18 for freeways6,7,8 the cars are moving and 0 is never in the spans.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway8 at turn18? We computed the car spans at turn18:\n\nFor freeway8 (which is the same as freeway5,6,7): \n  car1: [13+12*(18-16)=13+24=37, 24+24=48] -> [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [-59+12*2=-59+24=-35, -48+24=-24] -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut what if we had arrived at freeway8 at a different turn? For example, if we delayed, then the cars would be at different positions.\n\nBut in our path, we are at freeway8 at turn18.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway6 at turn16: \n  turn16: T=16, so T-t1=0 -> the cars are at:\n      car1: [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n      car2: [-59,-48] -> 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn17: \n  T=17 -> T-t1=1 -> \n      car1: [13+12=25, 24+12=36] -> 0 not in.\n      car2: [-59+12=-47, -48+12=-36] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nBut is there a faster way? The minimal H: we need to get from 5 to 9: 4 steps. So 4 turns is the minimum. So we cannot do better.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here H=4, so t from 0 to 3. So:\n\nt=0: turn16\nt=1: turn17\nt=2: turn18\nt=3: turn19\n\nSo the actions are for turn16,17,18,19.\n\nBut note: at turn19 we do U and then we end at y=9. So that's the last action.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less than 4? We cannot: 5 to 9 is 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively, could we go down? But that would take more steps. So the minimal is 4.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions? Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H actions. And we start at turn t1, so the last turn we act is t1+H-1, and then we end at y=9 at the end of that turn.\n\nSo H=4.\n\nBut wait: we are at the beginning of turn16 at y=5. Then we do 4 moves: turn16,17,18,19. At the end of turn19 we are at y=9.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut why then does the problem have complex car data? Maybe I made a mistake? Let me check freeway4 at turn16: if we had gone down to y=4 at turn16, then we would have to check freeway4 at turn16.\n\nAt turn16, freeway4 cars:\n  car1: [5,16] -> 0 is not in [5,16] -> safe.\n  car2: [41,52] -> safe.\n  car3: [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nBut if we go down, we are going away from the goal. So it would take more steps.\n\nAlternatively, what if we wait at y=5 for one turn? Then we do S at turn16: then at the end of turn16 we are at y=5. Then we check freeway5 at turn16: safe. Then at turn17 we go up to y=6, then turn18 to y=7, turn19 to y=8, turn20 to y=9 -> that's 5 turns. Worse.\n\nSo the direct upward path is best.\n\nBut is there any car that might appear at 0 on freeway6,7,8 at the turns we are there? We computed: no.\n\nBut let me check freeway8 at an earlier turn? For example, if we arrived at freeway8 at turn17? How? We start at 5, then turn16: U->6, turn17: U->7, then we need two more to get to 9. So we cannot be at freeway8 until at least turn18.\n\nSimilarly, we computed freeway8 at turn18 is safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway8 at turn18 again: \n  car1: [13+12*(18-16)=13+24=37, 24+24=48] -> [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [-59+24=-35, -48+24=-24] -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut what about freeway4? We don't use it. Freeway1,2,3? We are above 5 so we skip them.\n\nBut wait: what about if we take a detour? No, because we want minimal steps.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\n\nBut the problem has freeway4 with three cars, and freeways5-8 with two cars each, and freeways1-3 with one car. Why? Maybe to catch if we go down? But we are going up.\n\nBut let me check freeway5 at a later turn? For example, if we were to stay at y=5 for two turns? Then at turn17 we are at y=5: check freeway5 at turn17: \n  car1: [13+12*(17-16)=13+12=25, 24+12=36] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [-59+12=-47, -48+12=-36] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo safe, but that would be slower.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 at a later turn? For example, at turn17: \n  car1: [5+4*(1)=9, 16+4=20] -> [9,20] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [41+4=45,52+4=56] -> safe.\n  car3: [-35+4=-31, -24+4=-20] -> safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut why is there a car on freeway4 at (16,5) at turn16? That car at turn16 is at [5,16] which does not include 0. But if we were at y=4 at turn16, we are safe. And if we were at y=4 at turn17, then we see [9,20] -> still safe.\n\nBut note: what if we were at freeway4 at turn18? \n  car1: [5+4*2=13, 16+8=24] -> [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [41+8=49,52+8=60] -> safe.\n  car3: [-35+8=-27, -24+8=-16] -> safe.\n\nSo no.\n\nBut wait, there is a car on freeway5 at turn16: [13,24] and [-59,-48] -> safe. But what about at turn15? We are starting at turn16, so we don't care about turn15.\n\nTherefore, the upward path is safe and minimal.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1+1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut let me write in the required format.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that for t=0, we have a_{t1+0}=a_{16}, for t=1, a_{17}, etc.\n\nSo we have four actions: a16, a17, a18, a19.\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: a_{16}\nTurn 17: a_{17}\nTurn 18: a_{18}\nTurn 19: a_{19}\n}\n\nWith the actions filled in.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me check if at any point we are on a freeway with a car that covers 0.\n\nAt turn16: we end at y=6. Freeway6 at turn16: \n  car1: [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [-59,-48] -> 0 not in.\n\nAt turn17: we end at y=7. Freeway7 at turn17: \n  car1: [13+12=25,24+12=36] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: [-59+12=-47, -48+12=-36] -> 0 not in.\n\nAt turn18: we end at y=8.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 17, and the player is at (0,6). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant note: \n- The player updates at the same time as the cars. \n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that same turn T.\n- When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, note that at turn T the player is still on row y. Then at the next turn (T+1) the player will be on row y'. Therefore, at the moment of moving (turn T) we only check the current row (y) for collision. The next row (y') is only checked at the next turn (if we are still moving or staying on that row).\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row (y=1,2,...,8) at a turn T when there is a car on that row whose span includes 0 at turn T.\n\nGiven the car update rules:\n- For a left-moving car: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] at turn T (relative to t1).\n- For a right-moving car: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] (note: the example uses [τ, h] for right-moving, meaning the head is at the higher number? Actually, in the example the right-moving car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But note the update rule for right-moving: \n    Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut wait: the initial state at t1 is given as (head, tail, ...). For a right-moving car, the head is the front? Then the tail is behind. So the span is from tail to head? But the update rule says for right-moving: initial span [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. \n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (3, -8, right, 3). So at t1=17, the car on freeway 1 is a right-moving car with head at 3 and tail at -8? Then the span is from -8 to 3? But the update rule for right-moving says: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So τ is the tail and h is the head? Then the initial span is [τ, h] = [-8, 3]. Then at turn T, the span becomes [-8 + 3*(T-17), 3 + 3*(T-17)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, we would have [h, τ] -> [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)], but in our table all cars are right-moving? Actually, we don't have any left-moving in this problem? Let me check: all directions are \"right\". So only right-moving.\n\nSo for each car on a freeway, we have:\n   car_span(T) = [ tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1) ]\n\nWe are at (0, y) at each turn. We are concerned only when the player is on a freeway row k (which is the row number) at turn T, and then we check if 0 is in the car's span on that row? But note: the problem says \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". \n\nSo at turn T, if the player is on row y (which is one of the freeways 1-8), then we must check every car on that row at turn T. If any car's span at turn T contains 0, then collision.\n\nImportant: the player starts at (0,6) at turn 17. We are to choose actions for turns 17, 18, ... until we reach row 9.\n\nWe can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y remains). And we must stay within [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nGoal: minimal H (number of turns) and the action sequence.\n\nWe are to output the actions starting at turn 17 (for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions: from turn 17 to turn 17+H-1). Then at turn 17+H-1, we are at row 9.\n\nWe note that we start at row 6. We need to get to row 9. The minimal moves without cars would be 3 moves up (U). But we have to avoid the cars on rows 7 and 8? Actually, we have to avoid collisions on every freeway row we are on at the moment.\n\nWe are currently at row 6 at turn 17. But row 6 is a freeway? Yes, freeways are rows 1 to 8. So we must check row 6 at turn 17 for collision? \n\nAt turn 17, we are at row 6. The car state for row 6: \n   Cars: (36, 25, right, 12) and (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Car State\" for freeway k. So for row 6 (freeway 6), we have two cars.\n\nCompute the span for each car on row 6 at turn 17 (T=17, relative to t1=17: so T-t1=0):\n   Car1: tail=25, head=36 -> span = [25, 36] -> but wait, the update rule for right-moving: \n        [τ + s*(0), h + s*(0)] = [25, 36] -> does 0 lie in [25,36]? No.\n   Car2: tail=-47, head=-36 -> span = [-47, -36] -> 0 is not in this.\n\nSo at turn 17, row 6 is safe.\n\nNow, we plan the moves. We want to go from row 6 to row 9. We can do:\n\nOption 1: go up three times: U, U, U. Then we would be at row 9 at turn 17+3-1 = turn 19? \n   Turn 17: start at row 6 -> action U -> then at turn 18, we are at row 7.\n   Turn 18: at row 7 -> action U -> then at turn 19, we are at row 8.\n   Turn 19: at row 8 -> action U -> then at turn 20, we are at row 9 -> done in 3 turns? But we must check safety at each turn.\n\nWe must check the row we are on at each turn:\n\nTurn 17: we are on row 6 -> safe (as above).\n\nTurn 18: we are on row 7 -> check row 7 at turn 18 (T=18, so T-t1=1).\n\nRow 7 cars: same as row 6? Actually, the table shows:\n   Freeway 7: (36,25,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nSo for row 7 at turn 18 (T=18, t1=17, so Δt=1):\n   Car1: [25 + 12*1, 36 + 12*1] = [37, 48] -> 0 not in [37,48]\n   Car2: [-47 + 12*1, -36 + 12*1] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSo row 7 is safe at turn 18.\n\nTurn 19: we are on row 8 -> check row 8 at turn 19 (T=19, Δt=2).\n\nRow 8 cars: same as row 6 and 7? \n   Freeway 8: (36,25,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\n   Car1: [25+12*2, 36+12*2] = [25+24, 36+24] = [49,60] -> no\n   Car2: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23, -12] -> no.\n\nSo row 8 is safe.\n\nThen at turn 20 we are at row 9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait, at turn 20 we are at row 9 and we don't check row 9? Because the freeways are only 1-8. So we are safe.\n\nSo minimal H=3? Then the actions are:\n   Turn 17: U\n   Turn 18: U\n   Turn 19: U\n\nBut wait: at turn 19 we are at row 8? Then we take U and at the end of turn 19 we move to row 9, which is at turn 20. But the problem says: we take H actions and at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo t1=17, H=3: then we take actions at turns 17, 18, 19. And at turn 17+3-1 = 19, we are at row 9? But actually:\n\n   Start: turn 17: at row 6 -> after action U at turn17, at turn18 we are at row7.\n   Turn18: at row7, action U -> at turn19 we are at row8.\n   Turn19: at row8, action U -> at turn20 we are at row9.\n\nBut the last action is at turn19 (which is the third action) and then at turn20 we are at row9. However, the problem says: the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions, and at the turn after the last action we are at row9. So the turn when we are at row9 is t1 + H (because we start at t1 and take H actions: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then we are at row9 at the next state which is turn t1+H). \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nWait: the player update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo after one action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}. Therefore, after H actions (taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1), we have:\n   y_{t1+H} = ... \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLet me clarify indexing:\n\nAt turn t1 (current turn), we are at y_{t1}=6.\n\nWe take an action a_{t1} at turn t1, then at the next turn (t1+1) we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t1+1 we take a_{t1+1}, then at turn t1+2 we are at y_{t1+2}, and so on.\n\nWe want that at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut note: at turn t1+H-1, we are at row 9, and we have taken H-1 actions? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions: \n   a_{t1} (t=0), a_{t1+1} (t=1), ..., a_{t1+H-1} (t=H-1)\n\nThen the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nWait, let me re-index:\n\nAt the start: turn t1, state y_{t1}=6.\n\nAfter the first action (t=0, at turn t1): \n   we get state at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter the second action (t=1, at turn t1+1): \n   we get state at turn t1+2: y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nAfter the k-th action (at turn t1+k-1), we get state at turn t1+k.\n\nWe take H actions: so we get states at turns: t1+1, t1+2, ..., t1+H.\n\nWe want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? \n\nBut note: the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1, and then we get state at turn t1+H. So we never have a state at turn t1+H-1 that is after an action taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\nActually, we have:\n\n   Turn t1: state y_{t1} = 6 (before any action in our sequence? but we are about to take the first action)\n   Then we take action at turn t1 -> state at turn t1+1 = y_{t1+1}\n   Then at turn t1+1 we take action -> state at turn t1+2 = y_{t1+2}\n   ...\n   At turn t1+H-1 we take the last action -> then state at turn t1+H = y_{t1+H}\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis implies that we are at row 9 at turn t1+H-1. How? \n\nIt means that we have taken H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1: so H actions. \n\nAlternatively, note the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nThis is confusing. Let me see the example in the problem: \n\n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\n   and the answer format: \n        Turn t1: a_{t1}\n        Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n        ...\n\n   until the last action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after the last action? \n\nWait, no: the state at turn t1 is before the first action. Then we take action a_{t1} and then at turn t1+1 we are at a new state. \n\nSo to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have taken actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2? \n\nBut the problem says: sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1: meaning we take H actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after the (H-1)-th action? \n\nActually, the state at turn t1 is the starting state (row6). Then:\n\n   After action a_{t1} (at turn t1) we are at state at turn t1+1.\n   After action a_{t1+1} (at turn t1+1) we are at state at turn t1+2.\n   ...\n   After action a_{t1+H-1} (at turn t1+H-1) we are at state at turn t1+H.\n\nTherefore, we want the state at turn t1+H to be 9? But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis suggests that the problem counts the starting turn as the first state? And then we take actions and then the state at the same turn? \n\nBut the update rule is: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo the action at turn t affects the state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, we are at y_{t1} at turn t1 (given: 6). We take an action a_{t1} at turn t1, then we get y_{t1+1}. Then we take a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, then we get y_{t1+2}, etc.\n\nTo have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, we must have taken H-1 actions? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions. \n\nAnd then we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nBut with H actions, we get:\n\n   After 0 actions: at turn t1: y_{t1}=6\n   After 1 action: at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = ... \n   ...\n   After H actions: at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} = ...\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we need to have taken H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1: that would be H actions. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then we are at the goal at the state that is after the last action? \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nLet me re-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" \n\nIt says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence is of H actions. \n\nBut note: we start at turn t1, and we take H actions (so the last action is at turn t1+H-1). Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state before the last action? \n\nBut we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThat would mean that we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we don't need to take an action at that turn? \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nLooking at the update: \n   At turn t, we are at state y_t, then we choose an action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nTherefore, at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take an action a_t, and then we are at y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nSo to be at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we must have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? \n\nThen the sequence of actions would be from t1 to t1+H-2, which is H-1 actions? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}: H actions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the \"turns\" as the state turns. \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning we start at turn t1 and we end at turn t1+H-1? \n\nAnd we take actions at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nBut then the state at the end of the process is at turn t1+H-1. \n\nAnd we want that state to be row9.\n\nSo we start at turn t1 at row6. Then we take action at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1 we are at a new row. Then we take action at turn t1+1, and then at turn t1+2, ... until at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9. \n\nHow many actions? We take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? That is H-1 actions? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: meaning H actions. \n\nThis suggests that we take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut then the state after the action at turn t1+H-1 is at turn t1+H. \n\nTherefore, to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have already been there at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 and then we take an action? \n\nBut that action would then move us? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that we are to be at row9 at the turn that is the last turn we act? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. \n\nLooking at the problem statement: \n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand the answer format: \n   Turn t1: a_{t1}\n   Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n   ...\n   Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd then after taking the last action at turn t1+H-1, we are at row9 at the next state? But that would be turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" in the task? \n\nWait, in the task section: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nThis seems inconsistent. \n\nLet me check the problem again: \n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\n   and then in the answer format, we output actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: the minimal number of turns H might mean the total number of turns we are in the game? \n\nWe start at turn t1 (state known) and we want to be at row9 by the time we reach turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut that would be after (H-1) actions? \n\nAlternatively, H is the number of actions? \n\nI think the problem likely means:\n\n   We take H actions (so H is the length of the action sequence) and then at the state at turn (t1+H) we are at row9. But then why would they write \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"?\n\nAnother possibility: the indexing of the state is the same as the turn when we are at that state. And we start at state at turn t1. Then we take an action at turn t1 and then we are at state at turn t1+1. Then we take an action at turn t1+1 and then at state at turn t1+2. ... Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1 and then we are at state at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9? \n\nThat would mean that we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn? But then we would move away? \n\nUnless we do nothing? But then why take an action?\n\nI see the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take actions at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1. \n\nAnd then it says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis implies that we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn? But then we will move to another row? \n\nThat doesn't make sense for the goal. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo. \n\nLooking at the update rule: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo if we are at turn t, we are at state y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then we get y_{t+1}. \n\nWe want to be at row9 at some turn T. \n\nThe problem says: at turn t1+H-1, we are at row9. \n\nThat means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at row9. \n\nBut then we would take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut we don't need to move anymore. \n\nSo the action at turn t1+H-1 could be 'S' (stay). Then we would remain at row9 at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem does not require anything about turn t1+H, only that at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   ... \n   at the beginning of turn t1+H-1: we are at row9.\n   then we take action S at turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are still at row9.\n\nBut the requirement is only for turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the minimal H would be the number of actions we take until we are at row9 at the beginning of a turn, and then we take an action (S) at that turn? \n\nBut then we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so we must have gotten there by the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nAlternatively, we might arrive at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 by an action taken at turn t1+H-2. Then we take an action S at turn t1+H-1 to satisfy the sequence of H actions? \n\nBut then H is the number of actions, and we are at row9 at turn t1+H-1 (beginning) and then we take an action S.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then we output H actions.\n\nHowever, we don't necessarily need to take an action after arriving? \n\nBut the problem requires a sequence of H actions.\n\nSo let me try with H=3:\n\n   Turn t1 (17): beginning: row6. We take an action a17 -> then at turn18: row?\n   Turn18: beginning: row? then take action a18 -> turn19: row?\n   Turn19: beginning: row? then take action a19 -> turn20: row?\n\nWe want at the beginning of turn19 (which is t1+2) to be row9? That would be after two actions. \n\nBut then the action at turn19 would be taken when we are already at row9? \n\nSo the minimal number of actions to get to row9 is 3: \n   a17: U -> row7 at turn18\n   a18: U -> row8 at turn19\n   a19: U -> row9 at turn20\n\nThen we are at row9 at the beginning of turn20. \n\nBut the problem requires we are at row9 at turn19 (t1+2) if H=3? Because t1+H-1 = 17+3-1=19.\n\nSo we would need to be at row9 at the beginning of turn19.\n\nHow can we be at row9 at the beginning of turn19? \n   That means by turn19 we have taken actions at turns17 and 18.\n\n   Action at turn17: ? -> then at turn18: row?\n   Action at turn18: ? -> then at turn19: row9.\n\nSo we need to go from 6 to 9 in two actions: U, U, U? But that's three steps. \n\nAlternatively, we might be able to move faster? But the moves are only +1, -1, or 0 per action.\n\nWe start at row6 at turn17 (beginning). \n   If we do U at turn17: then at turn18 (beginning) we are at row7.\n   Then U at turn18: then at turn19 (beginning) we are at row8.\n   We are not at row9.\n\n   If we could do a double move? But no, one move per action.\n\nSo it takes at least three actions to go from 6 to 9: \n   U at turn17: turn18 -> row7\n   U at turn18: turn19 -> row8\n   U at turn19: turn20 -> row9\n\nThen we are at row9 at turn20.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at row9 is turn20.\n\nSo we want y_{20}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo we want y_{17+H-1}=9.\n\nWe want 17+H-1 = 20 -> H-1 = 3 -> H=4.\n\nThen the actions would be at turns17,18,19,20? But then we are at row9 at turn21? \n\nNo, if H=4, then t1+H-1 = 17+4-1=20, and we want y_{20}=9.\n\nHow do we achieve y_{20}=9? \n   We start at turn17: y17=6.\n   We take action at turn17: a17 -> y18 = 6 + Δ17\n   a18 -> y19 = y18 + Δ18\n   a19 -> y20 = y19 + Δ19\n   a20 -> y21 = y20 + Δ20   [but we don't need to take an action at turn20 if we already are at row9 at turn20?]\n\nBut the sequence has H=4 actions: from turn17 to turn20.\n\nBut we want y20=9, meaning at the beginning of turn20 we are at row9.\n\nSo we need to have arrived at row9 by the action at turn19.\n\n   So: \n        y19 = 8 or 9 or 10? \n        then a19: if y19=8, then U -> y20=9.\n        or if y19=9, then S -> y20=9.\n\nBut how to get to y19=8 or 9?\n\nWe want minimal H. H=4 means we take 4 actions, but we only need 3 moves (U three times) to get to 9. \n\nBut with the actions:\n   a17: U -> y18=7\n   a18: U -> y19=8\n   a19: U -> y20=9\n\nThen we are at row9 at the beginning of turn20. \n\nSo to have y20=9, we need H such that 17+H-1=20 -> H=4.\n\nThen the actions are for turns17,18,19,20? But the last action at turn20 would be the fourth action, and then we get y21. \n\nBut we don't need to move at turn20? \n\nBut the problem requires a sequence of H actions, and then we are at row9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we set H=4, then we require y_{17+4-1}=y_{20}=9.\n\nAnd the actions are at turns17,18,19,20. But at turn20, we are already at row9 (at the beginning) so we can do S. \n\nSo the actions would be:\n   turn17: U\n   turn18: U\n   turn19: U\n   turn20: S\n\nThen:\n   turn17: start at 6, U -> turn18:7\n   turn18: at7, U -> turn19:8\n   turn19: at8, U -> turn20:9\n   turn20: at9, S -> turn21:9\n\nWe are at row9 at turn20 and turn21.\n\nBut the requirement is only for turn20: y20=9.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut is there a way with H=3? Then we would require y_{17+3-1}=y_{19}=9.\n\nSo we need to be at row9 at the beginning of turn19.\n\nHow? \n   turn17: start at6. \n   a17: must get us to at least row8 by turn18? But we can only move by 1 per action.\n        a17: U -> turn18:7\n   a18: then at turn18 (beginning) we are at7. We need to be at9 at turn19 (beginning). \n        a18: U -> turn19:8 -> not 9.\n        a18: U twice? no, only one action.\n\n   Alternatively, a17: U, a18: U, and then at turn19 we are at8, not9.\n\n   Or if we do a17: U, a18: U, then at turn19 we are at8. \n\n   We cannot be at9 at turn19.\n\nTherefore, H must be at least 4.\n\nBut wait, what if we move down then up? No, that would take more actions.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nBut we must check the cars for the entire path.\n\nWe have to ensure that at each turn when we are on a freeway row (1-8), we are safe.\n\nOur planned actions for H=4:\n   turn17: U -> then at turn18 we are at row7\n   turn18: U -> then at turn19 we are at row8\n   turn19: U -> then at turn20 we are at row9\n   turn20: S -> then at turn21 we are at row9\n\nWe are on freeway rows only at turns17 (row6), turn18 (row7), turn19 (row8).\n\nWe already checked turn17 (row6) at turn17: safe.\n\nWe need to check:\n   turn18: row7 at turn18 (T=18, relative to t1=17: Δt=1)\n   turn19: row8 at turn19 (Δt=2)\n\nFor row7 at turn18 (Δt=1):\n   Freeway7 has two cars: \n        car1: (36,25,right,12) -> span at T=18: [25+12*1, 36+12*1] = [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n        car2: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\n\nFor row8 at turn19 (Δt=2):\n        car1: [25+12*2, 36+12*2] = [25+24,36+24] = [49,60] -> no.\n        car2: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> no.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut what about row6 at turn17 we already did.\n\nTherefore, the plan is valid.\n\nBut note: there are other freeways? We only care about the freeway we are on.\n\nSo the actions are:\n   Turn 17: U\n   Turn 18: U\n   Turn 19: U\n   Turn 20: S\n\nBut wait, is the S necessary? The problem only requires that we are at row9 at turn20. We are there at the beginning of turn20. Then we take an action at turn20. We can choose any action? But we must output an action for turn20. Since we are at row9, we can do S to stay.\n\nAlternatively, if we do U at turn20, we would try to go to row10, but that is not allowed? The rule says: y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go above 9. Therefore, we must do S or D. But doing D would go to 8, which is not 9. So we must do S.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions\" only on freeways (1-8). At row9, no freeway, so no collision check. So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut is there a way to get to row9 earlier? We saw that physically we cannot be at row9 before turn20.\n\nAlternatively, what if we use down actions? But that would take more steps.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 4,5, etc.? Actually, we are not on those freeways. We are only on rows 6,7,8. And we checked the cars on rows 6,7,8.\n\nHowever, note that freeway 4 has three cars? But we are never on freeway4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1,2,3: we are not on them.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn17 we are on row6, and freeway6 has cars: \n   (36,25,right,12) -> [25,36] at turn17: safe.\n   (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47,-36] at turn17: safe.\n\nAt turn18: row7, freeway7: same as freeway6? The table shows for freeway7: same cars as freeway6? Actually, the table shows:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n| 1 | ... |\n| 2 | ... |\n| 3 | ... |\n| 4 | ... |\n| 5 | ... |\n| 6 | (36,25,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) |\n| 7 | (36,25,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) |\n| 8 | (36,25,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) |\n\nSo yes, rows 6,7,8 have the same car configuration.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nBut note: what if at turn19 when we are at row8, we do U and then at turn20 we are at row9. Then we are not on freeway at turn20. And then at turn20 we do S: we are still at row9, which is safe.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=4.\n\nBut is there a way with H=3? We argued not.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then we output H actions. \n\nBut in our plan, we are at row9 at turn20, which is the turn index 17+3? But we took 3 moves and then one stay. \n\nBut the minimal number of turns from start to the goal state is 3 turns of movement? But the problem counts the turns when we take actions.\n\nAlternatively, we might be able to skip the last S? \n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9. For H=3, that would be turn17+3-1=19. We are at row9 at turn20, not turn19.\n\nSo we must have H=4.\n\nBut let me see if we can be at row9 at turn19 by a different route.\n\nWe start at row6 at turn17.\n\nIs there a way to move two rows in one action? No.\n\nWhat if we use a car to move us? No, we can only move up, down, or stay.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut wait, what about the cars on freeway 4,5, etc.? They are not on our path.\n\nBut note: freeway 4 has cars: \n   (20,9,right,4), (56,45,right,4), (-20,-31,right,4)\n\nBut we are never on freeway4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5: same as 6? No, freeway5 has: (36,25,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) -> same as 6,7,8.\n\nBut we are not on freeway5.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut one more thing: at turn17, when we are at row6, we have cars on row6. We checked. \n\nBut what about the other freeways? The problem says: collision occurs only if we are on a freeway row and at that turn a car on that row has a span containing 0.\n\nSo if we are not on that freeway row, we don't care.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=4. But is there a way to avoid the last S? \n\nIf we could finish earlier? But we cannot be at row9 at turn19.\n\nWhat if we do not take an action at turn20? But the problem says we must output a sequence of H actions. For H=3, we cannot achieve the state at turn19 (t1+2) to be row9.\n\nSo we must have H=4.\n\nBut let me see the car movements: are there any cars that might block us if we delay? \n\nFor example, if we wait at row6 for one turn? \n\nBut then we would take more actions. For example:\n\n   turn17: S -> then at turn18: row6\n   turn18: U -> turn19: row7\n   turn19: U -> turn20: row8\n   turn20: U -> turn21: row9\n\nThen we would be at row9 at turn21. To have y_{20}=9? Then we would need H=4 for this too: \n   We want y_{17+H-1}=9 -> 17+H-1=21 -> H=5.\n\nSo that would be slower.\n\nTherefore, the direct three ups and then a stay is the fastest.\n\nBut we must check if at turn17,18,19 we are safe. We did.\n\nOne more: what about freeway 1,2,3? They have cars: (3,-8,right,3) at turn17.\n\nFor row1,2,3: \n   We are not on them, so no need.\n\nBut just out of curiosity: at turn17, freeway1: \n   car: (3,-8,right,3) -> span at turn17: [-8,3]? \n   Does 0 lie in [-8,3]? Yes, 0 is in [-8,3]. \n\nBut we are not on freeway1 at turn17, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn18: \n   freeway1: span = [-8+3, 3+3] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]? Yes.\n   freeway2 and 3: same.\n\nBut again, we are not on those rows.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut note: the problem says the player starts at (0,6) at turn t1=17. \n\nSo the output:\n\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: S\n\nBut the last action is S at turn20, and then we are at row9 at turn21? But we are already at row9 at the beginning of turn20. Then we do S and remain at row9 at turn21.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn20 (which is t1+H-1 = 17+4-1=20) we are at row9. That is satisfied at the beginning of turn20.\n\nAnd the action at turn20 is S, which is valid.\n\nSo we are done.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 17\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0. The grid has y from 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars moving left or right at constant speeds. Collision happens if at some turn T, the player is at y_T and the x-position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when you move to a new y, you're not considered on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and only at turn T+1 are you on y+1. That means when you decide to move at turn T, you're checking for collision on your current freeway at turn T, and the new freeway only from turn T+1 onwards.\n\nIn this case, since we're starting at turn t1=18, position (0,7), and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nFirst, I should list out the car positions for each freeway at turn t1=18, and then for future turns, since they move predictably.\n\nThe car update is given: for a car, at turn T, the span is based on the head and tail at t1.\n\nFor left-moving cars: span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, it says span(t1) = [h, tau], and then at T, [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span(t1) = [tau, h], and at T, [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head is greater than tail I think? Let's see the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (6, -5, right, 3). Since direction is right, and head=6, tail=-5, so at t1, span is from tau to h, so [-5,6] I think? The span is given as [tau, h] for right-moving.\n\nIn the rule: for right-moving, span(t1) = [tau, h], so [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, [h, tau].\n\nIn the input, it's (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving, head should be the front, so if moving right, head > tail, so span is [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly, left-moving, head < tail? Let's see.\n\nIn freeway 4, there is a car with (24,13,right,4), so head=24, tail=13, since right, span at t1 is [tau, h] = [13,24].\n\nBut tail=13, head=24, so [13,24].\n\nAnother car: (-16,-27,right,4), head=-16, tail=-27, so span [tau, h] = [-27,-16].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this table, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: (6,-5,right,3) → span [ -5, 6 ]\n\nFreeway 2: same, (6,-5,right,3) → [ -5,6 ]\n\nFreeway 3: same, (6,-5,right,3) → [ -5,6 ]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: (24,13,right,4) → [13,24], (60,49,right,4) → [49,60], (-16,-27,right,4) → [-27,-16]\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,12) → [37,48], and (-24,-35,right,12) → [-35,-24]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nAll cars are right-moving, no left-moving. That might simplify things.\n\nSo for each car, at turn T, the span for right-moving car is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBecause from [tau, h] at t1, so position at T: tau + s*(T-t1) to h + s*(T-t1)\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right here.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, player is at y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for freeway k, if y_T = k, and min_span <= 0 <= max_span for some car on k at turn T.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, y_T is the row, and x=0 always, I assume, since it's (0, y).\n\nThe player is always at x=0, moving vertically, and cars are moving horizontally on their rows.\n\nSo for each freeway k, we need to know when there is a car covering x=0 at turn T.\n\nThat is, for a given k and T, if there exists a car on k such that tau + s*(T-t1) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t1)\n\nSince the car spans are intervals.\n\nNow, t1=18, so let's set t = T - t1, so t=0 is current turn.\n\nAt t=0, T=t1=18.\n\nPlayer starts at y=7.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince we can only move one step per turn, the minimum H would be 2, if we can go up twice: from 7 to 8, then to 9.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, at turn T=18, player is at y=7. So we are on freeway 7? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=7 is freeway 7.\n\nWe need to check if at T=18, on freeway 7, is there a collision? That is, is x=0 covered by any car on freeway 7 at T=18.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt T=18, t=0, so span for first car: [37,48], since s=12, t=0, so [37 + 0, 48 + 0]? No.\n\nGeneral: at turn T, position is tau + s*(T - t1) to h + s*(T - t1)\n\nSince t1=18, T=18, T-t1=0, so for first car on freeway 7: tau=37, h=48, s=12, so span [37 + 12*0, 48 + 12*0] = [37,48]\n\nSimilarly, second car: tau=-35, h=-24, s=12, span [-35, -24]\n\nNow, x=0, is 0 in [37,48]? No, 37 to 48, all positive, 0 not in.\n\nIs 0 in [-35,-24]? -35 to -24, all negative, 0 not in. So no collision at T=18 on freeway 7. Good.\n\nNow, we want to take action at turn 18. Possible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we do U, we move to y=8 at the next turn, so at turn T=19, y=8.\n\nBut when we take action at turn T=18, we are moving to y=8 for turn 19.\n\nAt turn T=18, we are still on y=7, and we take action a_{18}, which determines y_{19}.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, we are at position (0, y_t), we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, with bounds.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn when we are on a freeway.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, we need to ensure that no car on freeway y_T has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no freeway, so no collision possible.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nIn this case, we start at y=7, which is freeway 7.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to get to y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: from 7, we can go to 8 in one turn, then to 9 in another, so H=2, if possible.\n\nBut we need to check if we can do that without collision.\n\nSo, let's consider going up directly.\n\nAction at t1=18: a_{18} = U, so y_{19} = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nThen at turn 19, we are at y=8.\n\nNow, at turn 19, T=19, t= T - t1 =1.\n\nWe need to check if on freeway 8 at T=19, is there collision.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: same as 7, (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt T=19, t=1, so for first car: tau + s*(1) = 37 + 12*1 = 37+12=49 to h + s*1 =48+12=60, so [49,60]\n\nSecond car: tau + s*1 = -35 +12 = -23 to h + s*1 = -24 +12 = -12, so [-23,-12]? Let's compute:\n\ntau = -35, s=12, T-t1=1, so tau + s*(1) = -35 + 12 = -23\n\nh + s*(1) = -24 + 12 = -12? h is -24, so h + s*(T-t1) = -24 + 12*1 = -12\n\nAnd since it's right-moving, span is [tau + sΔ, h + sΔ] so [-23, -12]\n\nx=0: is 0 in [49,60]? No. In [-23,-12]? -23 to -12, all negative, 0 not in. So no collision at T=19 on y=8.\n\nThen, at turn 19, we can take action a_{19} = U, so y_{20} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nAt turn 20, we are at y=9, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at turn 20.\n\nBut is that correct? Turn t1=18, we take action, go to y=19=8 at turn 19.\n\nThen at turn 19, take action, go to y=20=9 at turn 20.\n\nSo after two actions, at turn 20, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H=2 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe player position: at turn t1, we start at (0,7).\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we go to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nWe reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H when y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn terms of turns, at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nWe start at T=t1=18, y=7.\n\nAfter first action, at T=19, y=8 or other.\n\nAfter second action, at T=20, y=9.\n\nSo we reach at T=20, with H=2 actions.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions to reach in H steps.\n\nIn this case, with two actions: U at t1, U at t1+1, we reach at t1+2.\n\nNow, but we need to make sure that during the path, no collision.\n\nAt T=18, we are at y=7, which we checked no collision.\n\nAt T=19, at y=8, no collision.\n\nAt T=20, y=9, safe.\n\nBut when we are at T=19, y=8, we are on freeway 8, and we checked no car covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=18, y=7, no issue.\n\nBut is there any other point? We only have two turns: T=18 and T=19 where we are on freeways.\n\nT=18: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nT=19: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nT=20: y=9, no freeway.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=18: we have cars [37,48] and [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=19: [49,60] and [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the player is at x=0 always.\n\nNow, but in freeway 4,5,6, etc., but since we are not on those rows, it doesn't matter.\n\nCollision only if we are on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSo for this path, it seems we can reach in H=2.\n\nBut is there a problem? Let me see the other freeways, but we don't care since we are not on them.\n\nBut just to be thorough, at T=18, we are only concerned with y=7.\n\nSimilarly at T=19, only y=8.\n\nAnd we checked.\n\nPerhaps I should check if we can go faster, but from 7 to 9, minimum 2 steps, so H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; it should be the actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=2, actions: a_{18} = U, a_{19} = U.\n\nBut let me write in the format.\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t1 +1: a_{t1+1} = U\n\nBut t1=18.\n\nBut is this possible? I think I missed something.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nIn this case, when we move, at turn T, we are on the current y, and only after action we move.\n\nIn the sequence above, no issue.\n\nBut let me check if at some point, for example, when we are at y=8 at T=19, we are on freeway 8, and cars are not at 0.\n\nBut freeway 8 has cars, but not at 0.\n\nBut let me see the cars on freeway 8 at other times, but we only care at the turn we are there.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, I need to make sure that at the exact turn we are there, no car is at 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut why do I feel like it might not be? Because freeway 4 has multiple cars, but we are not on it.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to wait or something.\n\nAnother thing: the player starts at (0,7), which is on freeway 7, and we need to leave it.\n\nBut in this case, we move up immediately.\n\nBut let me check freeway 6 and 8 as well, since we might pass through.\n\nIn this path, we only are on y=7 at T=18 and y=8 at T=19.\n\nNow, for freeway 6: at T=18, cars: (48,37,right,12) → [37,48], and (-24,-35,right,12) → [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nBut we are not on y=6 at T=18.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 same.\n\nFreeway 4: let's see, but not relevant.\n\nNow, at T=19, we are on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: cars (48,37,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt T=19, t=1, [37+12=49, 48+12=60] = [49,60]\n\nAnd [-35+12= -23, -24+12= -12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nIf we were to stay on y=8, but we don't.\n\nNow, but what about freeway 7 at T=19? We are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 9 doesn't exist.\n\nSo seems no problem.\n\nBut let me see the initial position; we are at y=7, and we go up to 8, then to 9.\n\nBut y=8 is freeway 8, which we checked at T=19.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 8 has cars, but not at 0.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at any turn, for the rows we are on, it's safe.\n\nAnother thought: when we move up, at the turn we move, we are still on the current row, so for example, at turn T=18, we are on y=7, take action U, then at T=19, we are on y=8.\n\nDuring T=19, we are on y=8, so we need y=8 to be safe at T=19.\n\nWhich it is.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions for freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFirst, freeway 7 at T=18: cars: one with [37,48], min=37>0, so 0 not covered. Other with [-35,-24], max=-24<0, so 0 not covered. Safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=19: cars: [49,60], min=49>0, 0 not in. [-23,-12], max=-12<0, 0 not in. Safe.\n\nSo H=2 should work.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at T=20.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason we cannot go directly.\n\nPerhaps for y=7, we need to see if we can stay or something, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: the player can move down or stay, but going up is faster.\n\nPerhaps for other rows, but we don't go there.\n\nBut let me see freeway 6, for example, at some turn, but we are not on it.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to go through other rows, but no, direct is shortest.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at turn T=18, just in case.\n\nAt T=18, freeway 8: cars (48,37,right,12) → [37,48], and (-24,-35,right,12) → [-35,-24], same as freeway 7 at T=18, 0 not in.\n\nBut at T=18, we are not on y=8, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in our path, at T=19, we are on y=8.\n\nNow, what if we do S at T=18? Then y=19=7, stay at y=7.\n\nThen at T=19, we are still at y=7, need to check collision at T=19 on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=19: t=1, cars: first car [37+12=49,48+12=60]? tau=37, s=12, T-t1=1, so min = tau + s*1 =37+12=49, max=h + s*1=48+12=60, [49,60]\n\nSecond car: tau=-35, s=12, min= -35+12= -23, max=h + s*1= -24 +12= -12, [-23,-12]\n\n0 not in, so safe. Then we can go up later, but it takes more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, to y=6, then we have to come back, worse.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nBut is there a car that might be at 0 at some point?\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, is there a time when a car covers x=0?\n\nBut in this case, for freeway 8, cars are at [37,48] at t=0, moving right at speed 12, so position increases.\n\nThe first car: min position at time t: 37 + 12t, which at t=0 is 37, increases, so always >37>0.\n\nSecond car: min position -35 +12t, at t=0, -35, at t=1, -23, etc., increasing, but since max is -24 +12t, at t=0, -24, t=1, -12, t=2, 0? Let's see when it covers 0.\n\nThe span is [tau + s t, h + s t] with t=T-t1.\n\nFor second car on freeway 8: tau=-35, h=-24, s=12.\n\nMin position: -35 + 12t\n\nMax position: -24 + 12t\n\nSet min <=0<= max, so -35 +12t <=0 and 0<= -24 +12t\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +12t <=0 => 12t <=35 => t <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12t => 12t >=24 => t>=2\n\nSo for t=2, min= -35 +12*2= -35+24= -11, max= -24 +24=0? -24 +12*2= -24+24=0.\n\nSo at t=2, T=t1+2=20, min= -35+24= -11, max= -24+24=0.\n\nSo span [ -11, 0 ] at T=20.\n\nx=0 is covered? min <=0<= max, -11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt T=20, for this car, span [ -11, 0 ], so x=0 is covered.\n\nBut only if we are on freeway 8 at T=20.\n\nIn our earlier plan, at T=20, we are at y=9, not on freeway 8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly, at T=19, for this car, min= -35+12= -23, max= -24+12= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nNow, back to our path.\n\nWith a_{18}=U, y_{19}=8\n\na_{19}=U, y_{20}=9\n\nAt T=19, y=8, freeway 8, no collision as above.\n\nAt T=20, y=9, safe.\n\nBut what about at T=18, y=7, safe.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut let me check freeway 7 at other times.\n\nFor example, if we were to stay, at T=19 on y=7, we have [49,60] and [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=20, freeway 7: t=2, first car [37+24=61,48+24=72]? tau=37,s=12,t=2, min=37+24=61, max=48+24=72\n\nSecond car: min= -35+24= -11, max= -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0 ], which covers 0.\n\nBut at T=20, if we were on y=7, it would be collision, but we are not.\n\nIn our case, we are at y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have only two actions.\n\nBut let me see if for y=8, at T=19, it is safe, which it is.\n\nBut in freeway 4, there is a car at (-16,-27,right,4), let's see when it covers 0.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to avoid moving when cars are coming, but in this case, for the rows we use, at the times, it's fine.\n\nBut let me list all the freeways we care about: only 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=18: safe\n\nFreeway 8 at T=19: safe\n\nAnd we pass through them at those times.\n\nNow, but the player starts at turn t1=18, and we take actions immediately.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 at turn 19, then to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nBut is there a reason to go faster? No, minimum two moves.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly, but we need to move step by step.\n\nAnother thing: what if we go down first? But that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor example, go to y=6, then up, etc., but longer.\n\nSo H=2 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 8 at T=19.\n\nT=19, t=1, car1: min=37 +12*1=49, max=48+12=60, [49,60]\n\nCar2: min= -35 +12*1= -23, max= -24+12= -12, [-23,-12]\n\n0 not in either, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7 at T=18: [37,48] and [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut the answer should be two actions: U at t1, and U at t1+1.\n\nNow, in the format.\n\nBut let me see the car state again.\n\nFreeway 4 has multiple cars, but we are not on freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4: cars (24,13,right,4) so at t=0, [13,24], moving right.\n\n(60,49,right,4) [49,60]\n\n(-16,-27,right,4) [-27,-16]\n\nNone near 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: (48,37,right,12) [37,48], (-24,-35,right,12) [-35,-24], same as others.\n\nAll similar.\n\nBut for freeway 1,2,3: each has one car (6,-5,right,3)\n\nAt t=0, span [ -5,6]\n\nNow, when does it cover 0? min= -5 +3t, max=6 +3t? For right-moving, span [tau + s t, h + s t]\n\ntau=-5, h=6, s=3.\n\nmin = -5 +3t, max=6 +3t\n\nSet min <=0<= max: -5+3t <=0 => 3t<=5 => t<=5/3≈1.666\n\nAnd 0<=6+3t always true for t>=0.\n\nAlso, -5+3t <=0 implies t<=1.666, and since t integer, t=0,1.\n\nAt t=0: min=-5, max=6, so -5<=0<=6, yes, 0 covered.\n\nAt t=1: min=-5+3= -2, max=6+3=9, -2<=0<=9, yes.\n\nAt t=2: min=-5+6=1, max=6+6=12, 1<=0<=12? 0<1, so 0 not <= max? min=1, max=12, so 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1.\n\nSo at t=0 and t=1, freeway 1 has car covering x=0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3.\n\nAt T=t1=18, t=0, on freeway 1, if we were there, collision.\n\nBut we are not on freeway 1.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=7 and 8, not 1,2,3.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 at T=18: t=0, span [-5,6], 0 in, so if player on y=1 at T=18, collision.\n\nSimilarly at T=19, t=1, min=-5+3= -2, max=6+3=9, [ -2,9], 0 in, so collision on y=1 at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, until when? At t=2, min=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in, so safe at T=20 for y=1.\n\nBut we are not going there.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut for our purpose, since we are only on 7 and 8 at specific times, and it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, with actions U at turn 18 and U at turn 19.\n\nBut let me write the answer.\n\nThe sequence should be for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at turn t1 and t1+1.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the player position at turn t1 is given, and we take action at turn t1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nAnd we reach (0,9) at turn 20.\n\nNow, but in the action sequence, it's up to the turn before reaching.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify the turns.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 18: U  \nTurn 19: U  \n}\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 19, when we are at y=8, and we take action U, moving to y=9, but at turn 19, we are on y=8, and we are safe, as checked.\n\nThen at turn 20, we arrive at y=9.\n\nNo issue.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if we can do it in H=1? Impossible, since from 7 to 9, we need at least two moves; we can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, this should be the answer.\n\nBut earlier I thought about the car on freeway 8 at T=20 covering 0, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\).

So once I reach y=9, I'm safe, and that's the goal.\n\ny=9 is the top, so to reach it, I need to move up from y=8 to y=9. But I might need to wait or move down if there's a car on y=8 that I could collide with.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car positions at turn t_1=19.\n\nThe car states are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, (9, -2, right, 3)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at T is [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt turn t_1, T=t_1, so span should be [tau, h] for right-moving? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the table, it says (head h, tail tau, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so at t_1, head is at h, tail at tau, and since it's moving right, head should be greater than tail if right is increasing x.\n\nThe x-axis is horizontal, I assume, but it's not specified. I think x=0 is the point we need to cross, and cars are on the freeway lanes.\n\nThe collision happens if 0 is in the span at turn T when I'm on that freeway.\n\nFor freeway 1: car (9, -2, right, 3)\n\nAt t_1=19, span is [tau, h] = [-2, 9]? But head and tail: it says (head h, tail tau), so head=9, tail=-2, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, at time t_1, the car occupies from tail to head, so [tau, h] = [-2, 9].\n\nThen at time T, span is [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-2 + 3(T-19), 9 + 3(T-19)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, I need to be on freeway y at time T, and if 0 is in the span for that y at T, collision.\n\nAlso, when I move from y to y+1 or y-1, at the turn I move, I'm still on the old row for that turn, so I only check the car on the row I'm leaving, not the one I'm entering, at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, when I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, I start at y=8 at turn 19.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is above, so I need to use action U at some point to go from 8 to 9.\n\nBut I might need to wait or move down first if it's unsafe.\n\nFirst, let's see the cars on row y=8, since that's where I am.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: (60, 49, right, 12) and (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nBoth right-moving, speed 12.\n\nAt turn T, for the first car: head=60, tail=49, so at t_1=19, span [49,60]? Head and tail: (head h, tail tau) = (60,49) so for right-moving, at t_1, span is [tau, h] = [49,60]\n\nThen at time T, span = [49 + 12(T-19), 60 + 12(T-19)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=-12, tail=-23, so at t_1, span [ -23, -12 ]\n\nAt T, [ -23 + 12(T-19), -12 + 12(T-19) ]\n\nI need to find when 0 is in these spans for y=8.\n\nFor collision at y=8 at time T, if 0 is in either car's span.\n\nFirst car: 0 in [49 + 12(T-19), 60 + 12(T-19)] ?\n\n49 + 12(T-19) <= 0 <= 60 + 12(T-19)\n\nBut 49 + 12(T-19) is at least 49 - something, but T-19 could be negative, but T >= t_1, so T-19 >=0.\n\nT is the turn number, starting from t_1=19, so for T >=19, T-19 >=0.\n\nSo 49 + 12(T-19) >= 49 >0, so the lower bound is at least 49, which is greater than 0, so 0 cannot be in [49 +12d, 60+12d] for d>=0, since min is 49>0.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound 60+12d >0, but lower bound >0, so 0 < lower bound, so 0 not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [ -23 +12d, -12 +12d] where d=T-19\n\n-23 +12d <= 0 <= -12 +12d\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\n-23 +12d <= 0 => 12d <=23 => d <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so d <=1 since d integer? d=T-19 integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -12 +12d => 12 <=12d => d >=1\n\nSo for d=1, -23+12= -11, -12+12=0\n\nSo at d=1, T=20, span [ -23+12(1), -12+12(1) ] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 to 0, so 0 is included, since it says \"0 in span\", and span includes endpoints I assume.\n\nThe span is [a,b], which includes a and b, so if a <=0<=b, collision.\n\nAt T=20, d=1, [ -11, 0], so 0 is the upper bound, so yes, 0 is in the span.\n\nFor d=0, T=19, [ -23, -12], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nd=1, T=20, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nd=2, T=21, [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=20, for the second car on y=8, 0 is in the span.\n\nBut there are two cars on y=8.\n\nFirst car, as I said, span starts at 49+12d >=49>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSecond car covers 0 at T=20.\n\nAt T=20, if I am on y=8, I collide because 0 is in the span of the second car.\n\nNow, what about other times? Only T=20 has collision on y=8 for this car.\n\nd=1 only.\n\nNow, but I start at T=19, y=8.\n\nAt T=19, on y=8, is there collision?\n\nFor second car, span [ -23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nFirst car [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=19, safe on y=8.\n\nAt T=20, if I am on y=8, I collide because of second car.\n\nNow, I need to not be on y=8 at T=20 if I want to avoid collision, but I might be moving or something.\n\nI am at (0,8) at turn 19.\n\nI can take actions: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I stay (S), I remain at y=8, and at turn 20, I will be at y=8, and collide because at turn 20, on y=8, 0 is in the car span.\n\nIf I move up (U), at turn 19, I move to y=9 at turn 20? Let's see the update.\n\nAt turn t, I choose action, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t=19, I choose a_{19}, then y_{20} = y_{19} + Δy_{19}\n\ny_{19} =8.\n\nIf a_{19} = U, then Δy= +1, so y_{20} =8 +1 =9.\n\nThen at turn 20, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, at turn 19, when I am on y=8, I check cars on y=8 at turn 19 for collision. At turn 19, y=8 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen at turn 20, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, no collision.\n\nAnd I have reached (0,9), so with H=1 turn? H is the number of turns, I think from t=19 to t=19+H-1.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nI start at turn t_1=19, position (0,8).\n\nAfter H turns, I should be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19 + H -1.\n\nAt that turn, y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then at turn t_1 +1 -1 = t_1=19, I should be at (0,9), but I start at (0,8), so at turn 19 I am at y=8, not 9. So I need to move to y=9 at some later turn.\n\nThe minimal H might be 2: at turn 19, I take action, then at turn 20, I reach y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, so sequence from t=19 to t=19+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nI start at t=19, y=8.\n\nAfter taking action a_{19}, I go to y_{20}.\n\nThen I can take a_{20}, go to y_{21}, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nThe position after actions: at time t, before action, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter taking action a_t, I move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1=19, so y_{19 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=1, y_{19+1-1} = y_{19} =8 ≠9.\n\nFor H=2, y_{19+2-1} = y_{20} =9.\n\nFor H=3, y_{21}=9, etc.\n\nSo minimal H is 2, if I can go directly to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nNow, at turn 19, I can choose U, then y_{20} =8+1=9.\n\nNow, collision check: at turn 19, I am on y=8, and I take action.\n\nWhen I take action at turn t, I am on y_t during turn t, so I check collision for row y_t at time t.\n\nThen after action, at turn t+1, I am on y_{t+1}, check collision for that row at time t+1.\n\nIn this case, at turn 19, I am on y=8, and cars on y=8 at t=19: as above, no car has 0 in span, so safe.\n\nThen I take U, so at turn 20, I am on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo I reach (0,9) at turn 20, which is t_1 +1, so for H=2, t_1 + H -1 =19+2-1=20, y=9.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut is there a problem with cars on other rows? When I move, I don't check the row I'm entering at the same turn.\n\nIn this case, from y=8 to y=9, at turn 19, I leave y=8, and at turn 20, I arrive at y=9.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut why is there a car on y=8 at t=20 that might be a problem? But at t=20, I am at y=9, not on y=8.\n\nSo for me, going directly U at t=19 should work.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I have to go through other rows, but since I start at y=8 and want to go to y=9, I don't need to go down or anything.\n\nBut let's see if there are cars on y=8 that affect me at t=19 or during movement.\n\nAt t=19, I am on y=8, safe.\n\nI take U, go to y=9 at t=20.\n\nNo collision.\n\nBut the problem is to avoid collisions, and I think it should be fine.\n\nBut why are there multiple cars and freeways listed? Maybe for other positions, but since I start at 8 and go to 9 directly, I only care about y=8 at t=19.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that y=9 is not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on y=8 at t=20.\n\nAt t=20, on y=8, there is a car with span [-11,0], so if I were on y=8 at t=20, I would collide, but I'm not, I'm at y=9.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly, other rows don't matter.\n\nBut what about when I move? The note says that when I move, at the turn I move, I am not on the new row yet, so I don't collide with cars there.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for minimal turns, H=2 is possible.\n\nBut let me see if H=1 is possible. H=1 would mean y_{19} =9, but I start at y_{19}=8, so impossible. So H=2 is minimal possible.\n\nNow, is there a reason I cannot go directly? Only if at t=19, on y=8, it is unsafe, but it is safe.\n\nOr if moving up causes issue, but no, because at t=19 I am on y=8, and after action I go to y=9 at t=20.\n\nPerhaps the car spans include the point, and since I am at x=0, if 0 is in span, collision.\n\nAt t=19, y=8, not in span.\n\nAt t=20, y=9, no cars.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut let me look at other freeways to see if there is a trap.\n\nFor example, if I were to go to other rows, but I don't need to.\n\nSince I start at 8 and want to go to 9, only one move up.\n\nBut I could stay or move down, but that would increase H, so not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H should be 2, with action U at t=19.\n\nThen sequence: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1 =20, I am at (0,9), which is the goal for H=2.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19 +2 -1=20, yes.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence of actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so for H=2, actions at t=19 and t=20? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\\)\"\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 +0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nThen after these H actions, I am at position after turn t_1 + H -1, which should be (0,9).\n\nIn terms of turns: at time t_1, I take action a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1}, I go to y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen take a_{t_1 +1}, go to y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, up to take a_{t_1 + H -1}, go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Inconsistency.\n\nLet's see the goal: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nTurn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nNow, y_t is determined before action at t.\n\nAfter action at t, I go to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, take action a_t, then at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo for turn T = t_1 + H -1, I am at y_T =9.\n\nTo reach y_T=9 at turn T.\n\nThe actions are taken from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t=t_1 only, a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1} for H=1, which is 8, not 9.\n\nIf H=2, actions at t=t_1 and t=t_1 +1, that is t=19 and t=20 for t_1=19.\n\nAfter action at t=19, I go to y_{20}.\n\nAfter action at t=20, I go to y_{21}.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{19 +2 -1} = y_{20} =9.\n\nSo after action at t=19, I go to y_{20}, which should be 9.\n\nThen at turn 20, I am at y=9, and I might take an action, but since I am already at (0,9), I don't need to do anything, but I have to take H actions.\n\nFor H=2, I need to take two actions: a_{19} and a_{20}.\n\na_{19} determines y_{20}, which should be 9.\n\nThen a_{20} determines y_{21}, but y_{21} can be anything, since I am already at (0,9) at turn 20.\n\nThe goal is to reach at turn t_1 + H -1, which is turn 20 for H=2.\n\nSo at turn 20, I must be at (0,9).\n\nAfter that, I may take additional actions, but since I have to take exactly H actions, for the remaining actions, I can do anything, like stay, but it might cause collision if I stay on a freeway.\n\nIn this case, for H=2, at turn 20, I am at y=9, which is safe.\n\nThen I take a_{20}, which could be S, U, or D.\n\nIf I take U, but y=9, if I go up, y=10, but y only from 0 to 9, so y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if y_t=9, U is invalid? Or does it stay?\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=9, U would make y=10, not allowed, so I assume it is clamped or invalid, but the action is defined, so probably y_{t+1} = min(9, max(0, y_t + Δy)), but not specified.\n\nThe condition: y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if action would take it out, it stays or something, but not defined.\n\nTo be safe, at y=9, only D or S are possible, U has no effect or invalid, but I think we should avoid invalid actions.\n\nSimilarly at y=0, D not possible.\n\nIn this case, for minimal H, with H=2, I can take a_{19} = U, then y_{20} =9.\n\nThen at turn 20, I am at y=9, and I need to take a_{20}, which can be S (stay), then y_{21}=9.\n\nBut since I only care about reaching at turn 20, y_{20}=9, and at turn 20, position is (0,9), and I take action a_{20} to go to y_{21}, but y_{21} doesn't matter for the goal, as long as at turn 20 I am there.\n\nAnd at turn 20, y=9, no cars, so safe when I take action.\n\nAction at turn t: when I take action, I am on y_t, so check collision on y_t at time t.\n\nAt turn 20, if I am on y=9, no freeway, so no collision, safe.\n\nThen I can take any action, say S.\n\nSimilarly, if I take D, I go to y=8, but that might not be safe, but I don't have to.\n\nSo for H=2, actions: a_{19} = U, and a_{20} = S or U or D, but U might not be allowed, so better to take S.\n\na_{20} = S, then y_{21} =9, still at 9.\n\nNow, but I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in this case, with a_{19}=U, I reach y_{20}=9, so for turn 20, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd I take a_{20}, but it doesn't affect the position at turn 20.\n\nThe position at turn t is before action or after? Turn t: position is y_t, then I take action a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter action, I go to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo for turn 20, y_{20} is the position.\n\nTo have y_{20}=9, I need that from y_{19}=8, I took action U at t=19.\n\nThen at turn 20, I am at y=9.\n\nThen I take action a_{20}, which affects y_{21}, but y_{21} is not specified, so I can choose.\n\nBut since the sequence must have H actions, and for H=2, I must take two actions.\n\nNow, back to the car issue.\n\nEarlier I thought it was fine, but let me confirm if at t=19, on y=8, it is safe.\n\ny=8 at t=19.\n\nCars: first car (60,49,right,12), span at t=19: since right-moving, at t_1, span [tau, h] = [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car (-12,-23,right,12), span [ -23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen I take U, go to y=9 at t=20.\n\nAt t=20, on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nThen I take a_{20}, say S, no issue.\n\nBut is there a car on y=9? No, y=9 not a freeway.\n\nFreeways are 1 to 8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut why are there cars on other rows? For example, if I had to go through them, but I don't.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason I cannot go directly.\n\nPerhaps at the moment I move, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the car on y=8 at t=20 has span including 0, but I am not on y=8 at t=20.\n\nUnless I stay.\n\nBut I move away.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 or others, but I don't go there.\n\nSo I think H=2 is possible with actions U at t=19 and S at t=20.\n\nBut since at t=20 I am already at 9, I could take no action, but I have to take the sequence.\n\nMinimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me check if H=2 is indeed minimal; yes, since H=1 impossible.\n\nNow, but in the car list, there are multiple cars, and for row 8, at t=19 it is safe, at t=20 it is not, but I leave at t=19.\n\nBut what about the action at t=20? When I take a_{20}, I am on y=9 at t=20, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I need to output only the necessary actions, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nAnother thing: in the car update, for row 4,5,6,7, there are cars, but since I don't go there, irrelevant.\n\nBut for completeness, let's see if I had to go down, but I don't.\n\nPerhaps the player might be forced to avoid, but in this case, direct move is fine.\n\nBut let me see the car on row 8 at t=19 and t=20.\n\nt=19: safe\n\nt=20: unsafe for y=8.\n\nSo if I stay at t=19, I would be on y=8 at t=20 and collide.\n\nBut I don't stay, I move up.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps for other times, but I only care about the turns I am on the row.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut let me calculate the span for other rows to see if there is danger, but since I don't visit, not needed.\n\nFor example, suppose I were at y=7, I might need to check.\n\nBut I start at y=8.\n\nPerhaps to reach y=9, I need to be safe when I move.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nSo minimal H=2, actions: a_{19} = U, a_{20} = S (for example).\n\nBut in the answer, I need to specify the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if S at t=20 is necessary; I could do U, but at y=9, U might not do anything, or error, so better S.\n\nD would go down to y=8, which at t=21 might be safe or not, but not necessary.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nFor H=2: t=19 and t=20.\n\nAction at t=19: U\n\nAction at t=20: S\n\nThen position: after a_{19}, y_{20}=9; at turn 20, position (0,9); then a_{20}=S, y_{21}=9.\n\nReached at turn 20.\n\nNow, but the problem is to reach (0,9), and I do at turn 20.\n\nBut is there a car that affects me at x=0 at some turn?\n\nAnother point: when I am at y=8, x=0, and if at that turn, 0 is in car span on that row, collision.\n\nAt t=19, not.\n\nAt t=20, I am at y=9.\n\nSo no.\n\nBut let me list all cars that could be at x=0 at some time on row 8, but only at t=20 for the second car.\n\nNot an issue.\n\nPerhaps for row 9, but no cars.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut why are there cars on row 1,2,3 with (9,-2,right,3)? Let's see if they affect anything.\n\nFor example, row 1: car (9,-2,right,3)\n\nAt t_1=19, span [ -2,9] for right-moving? Head=9, tail=-2, so [tau,h] = [-2,9]\n\nAt T, [ -2 +3(T-19), 9 +3(T-19) ]\n\n0 in span when -2 +3d <=0 <=9 +3d, which is always true for d>=0? -2+3d <=0 for d<=2/3, so d=0: -2<=0<=9, yes 0 in [-2,9]\n\nAt T=19, d=0, span [-2,9], 0 is between -2 and 9, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nBut for row y=1, at t=19, if I were on y=1, I would collide, but I am not, I am on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nBut for me, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 and 3 same, all have cars that include 0 at t=19? For row 1: at t=19, span [-2,9], includes 0.\n\nRow 2: same car (9,-2,right,3), so at t=19, span includes 0.\n\nRow 3: same.\n\nBut I am not on these rows.\n\nRow 4: cars (28,17,right,4), (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=28, tail=17, span [17,28] at t=19, 0 not in.\n\nSecond: head=-48, tail=-59? Head and tail: (head h, tail tau) = (-48,-59), direction right, so at t_1, span [tau, h] = [-59, -48], 0 not in.\n\nThird: head=-12, tail=-23, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nNow, at time T, for example, when is 0 in span.\n\nFor first car: [17+4d, 28+4d], min 17>0, so never 0.\n\nSecond: [-59+4d, -48+4d], 0 in when -59+4d <=0 <= -48+4d\n\n-59+4d <=0 => d<=59/4=14.75\n\n0 <= -48+4d => d>=12\n\nSo for d=12,13,14\n\nd=12: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nd=13: [-59+52, -48+52] = [-7,4], 0 in? -7<=0<=4, yes\n\nd=14: [-59+56, -48+56] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nSimilarly, third car: [-23+4d, -12+4d]\n\n0 in when -23+4d <=0 <= -12+4d\n\n-23+4d<=0 => d<=23/4=5.75\n\n0<= -12+4d => d>=3\n\nSo d=3,4,5\n\nd=3: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\netc.\n\nBut for row 4, not relevant to me.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut back to row 8, as before.\n\nNow, row 5,6,7,8 have similar cars with high speed.\n\nRow 5: (60,49,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nSame as row 8.\n\nFor row 5 at t=19: first car [49,60], 0 not in; second car [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=20: first [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], 0 not; second [-23+12,-12+12]=[-11,0], 0 in.\n\nSo if on row 5 at t=20, collide.\n\nSimilarly for row 6 and 7 same.\n\nBut I don't care.\n\nSo for me, starting at y=8, t=19, I can go directly to y=9.\n\nThus minimal H=2 with action U at t=19 and, say, S at t=20.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=2, I need two actions.\n\nPerhaps I can do only one action, but H=2 is minimal.\n\nAnother thought: do I need to take an action at t=20? Since I am already at y=9 at turn 20, and the position is achieved, but I have to take H actions, so for H=2, I must take two actions.\n\nI could take U at t=19 and then at t=20 take U, but at y=9, if U is not allowed, or it stays, but not necessary.\n\nTake S at t=20.\n\nIn the output, I need to write the actions.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\"\n\nFor t_1=19.\n\nSo for H=2:\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nBut Turn 20 is t_1 +1.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for t=0: t_1 +0 =19, action U\n\nt=1: t_1 +1=20, action S\n\nThen y_{20}=9, reached at turn 20.\n\nBut is S necessary? I could take any action, but S is safe.\n\nTo be precise, since at turn 20 I am at y=9, and I take action, but no collision possible.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=1, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: can I reach at turn 19? But y_{19}=8, not 9, so no.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach faster, no.\n\nPerhaps by moving down or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I move down to y=7, then I might avoid something, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nMoreover, on y=7, let's see cars.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 8, cars (60,49,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nAt t=19: safe, since spans [49,60] and [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=20: [61,72] and [-11,0], so if on y=7 at t=20, collide because of second car.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nBut if I go to y=7 at t=20, I might collide.\n\nBut I don't go there.\n\nFor example, if at t=19 I take D, go to y=7 at t=20, then at t=20 on y=7, the car has span including 0, so I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at t=19, at t=20 on y=8, collide.\n\nSo the only safe move at t=19 is to go up to y=9.\n\nIf I go down, I collide at t=20.\n\nIf I stay, collide.\n\nOnly U is safe and reaches the goal quickly.\n\nSo definitely, a_{19} must be U.\n\nThen at t=20, I am at y=9, and I take a_{20}, which can be S.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so H=2.\n\nSequence: a_{19} = U, a_{20} = S\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nBut Turn 20 is t_1 +1.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on row 8.\n\nFreeway 8: cars (60,49,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nAt t=19: positions: first car: since right-moving, at t_1, the car is from tail to head, x from tau to h, so [49,60], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: from -23 to -12, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt t=20: first car [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [-23+12,-12+12]=[-11,0], so x from -11 to 0, so at x=0, it is included, so if player at (0,y) with y=8 at t=20, collision.\n\nBut by moving up at t=19, I avoid that.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2 with actions U and S.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 19\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- At turn 19, the player is at \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 (row \\(y = 8\\)) are:\n  - Car 1: \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 12)\\)  \n    Span at turn 19: \\([49 + 12(0), 60 + 12(0)] = [49, 60]\\) (0 not in span, safe).  \n  - Car 2: \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 12)\\)  \n    Span at turn 19: \\([-23 + 12(0), -12 + 12(0)] = [-23, -12]\\) (0 not in span, safe).  \n  Thus, \\(y = 8\\) is safe at turn 19.\n- At turn 20, if the player is on \\(y = 8\\):\n  - Car 1: \\([49 + 12(1), 60 + 12(1)] = [61, 72]\\) (0 not in span).  \n  - Car 2: \\([-23 + 12(1), -12 + 12(1)] = [-11, 0]\\) (0 in span, collision if present).  \n  Thus, \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at turn 20.\n\nTo avoid collision and reach \\(y = 9\\):\n- The only safe action at turn 19 is \\(U\\) (up), moving to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20.  \n  - At turn 19, the player is on \\(y = 8\\), which is safe as established.  \n  - After moving, at turn 20, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no cars and no collision.  \n- At turn 20, the player is at \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached). An action must be taken as part of the sequence; \\(S\\) (stay) is safe and keeps the player at \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Minimal Turns\n- \\(H = 2\\) is minimal because \\(H = 1\\) is impossible (starting at \\(y = 8\\), and \\(y = 9\\) is reached at turn 20 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 19 + 2 - 1 = 20\\)).\n\n### Action Sequence\n- Turn 19: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\))  \n- Turn 20: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 9\\); any action is safe, but \\(S\\) is optimal)\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: S\n}",
