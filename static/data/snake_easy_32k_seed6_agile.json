Moving Left now allows a sequence: \n     - Turn 10: L to (3,6). \n     - Turn 11: L to (2,6). \n     - Turn 12: L to (1,6) to eat the food. \n   - This secures +1 score before the food expires.\n\n3. **Alternative (Right Path)**:\n   - Moving Right would prioritize (4,4), but (1,6) would be missed entirely, resulting in a net loss of potential score.\n\n4. **Safety**: \n   - Moving Left avoids collisions and keeps the snake maneuverable for future turns (e.g., after eating (1,6), the snake can safely navigate downward).\n\nThus, the optimal immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The other food at (4,5) is too distant and expires soon.  \n- **Safety**: Moving Left avoids collisions (tail is at (6,2), and no body segments block the path).  \n- **Efficiency**: Direct path minimizes turns to reach the food.  \n- **Future Flexibility**: Post-eating movement to (2,5) ensures maneuverability in open space.  \n\nThis plan aligns with the core rules and maximizes score while mitigating risks.",

From the head at (1,5), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: (0,5) - Wall (x=0). **Invalid**.\n2. **Right (R)**: (2,5) - Occupied by the snake's body (segment 1). **Invalid** (collision).\n3. **Up (U)**: (1,6) - Empty. **Valid**.\n4. **Down (D)**: (1,4) - Empty. **Valid**.\n\nSo, the valid immediate moves are **Up (U)** or **Down (D)**.\n\n### Evaluating Move Up (U) to (1,6)\n\nIf we choose **U**:\n\n- New head position: (1,6).\n- New direction: Up (U).\n  \nNext possible moves from (1,6):\n\n- **Up (U)**: (1,7) - Wall (y=7). **Invalid**.\n- **Down (D)**: Reverse of current direction. **Not allowed**.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,6) - Wall (x=0). **Invalid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,6) - Empty. **Valid**.\n\nSo, the only possible move next would be **R** to (2,6).\n\nFrom (2,6):\n\n- New head position: (2,6).\n- New direction: Right (R).\n\nNext possible moves from (2,6):\n\n- **Right (R)**: (3,6) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 4). **Invalid** (collision).\n- **Left (L)**: Reverse of current direction. **Not allowed**.\n- **Up (U)**: (2,7) - Wall (y=7). **Invalid**.\n- **Down (D)**: (2,5) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 2). **Invalid** (collision).\n\nThis leads to a dead end on turn 86 with no valid moves, causing the snake to die.\n\n### Evaluating Move Down (D) to (1,4)\n\nIf we choose **D**:\n\n- New head position: (1,4).\n- New direction: Down (D).\n\nNext possible moves from (1,4):\n\n- **Down (D)**: (1,3) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Up (U)**: Reverse of current direction. **Not allowed**.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,4) - Wall (x=0). **Invalid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,4) - Empty. **Valid**.\n\nSo, possible moves: **D** to (1,3) or **R** to (2,4).\n\n#### Option 1: Move D to (1,3)\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\n- New head position: (1,3).\n- New direction: Down (D).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Down (D)**: (1,2) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Up (U)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,3) - Wall. **Invalid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,3) - Empty (tail was at (2,3), now moved). **Valid**.\n\nChoose **D** to (1,2):\n\nFrom (1,2):\n\n- New head position: (1,2).\n- New direction: Down (D).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Down (D)**: (1,1) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Up (U)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,2) - Wall. **Invalid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,2) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 17). **Invalid**.\n\nChoose **D** to (1,1):\n\nFrom (1,1):\n\n- New head position: (1,1).\n- New direction: Down (D).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Down (D)**: (1,0) - Wall (y=0). **Invalid**.\n- **Up (U)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,1) - Wall. **Invalid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,1) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 16). **Invalid**.\n\nDead end at turn 87.\n\n#### Option 2: Move R to (2,4)\n\nFrom (2,4):\n\n- New head position: (2,4).\n- New direction: Right (R).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Right (R)**: (3,4) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Left (L)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Up (U)**: (2,5) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 2). **Invalid**.\n- **Down (D)**: (2,3) - Empty. **Valid**.\n\nChoose **R** to (3,4):\n\nFrom (3,4):\n\n- New head position: (3,4).\n- New direction: Right (R).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Right (R)**: (4,4) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Left (L)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Up (U)**: (3,5) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 3). **Invalid**.\n- **Down (D)**: (3,3) - Empty. **Valid**.\n\nChoose **R** to (4,4):\n\nFrom (4,4):\n\n- New head position: (4,4).\n- New direction: Right (R).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Right (R)**: (5,4) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 10). **Invalid**.\n- **Left (L)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Up (U)**: (4,5) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Down (D)**: (4,3) - Empty. **Valid**.\n\nChoose **D** to (4,3):\n\nFrom (4,3):\n\n- New head position: (4,3).\n- New direction: Down (D).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Down (D)**: (4,2) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Up (U)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Left (L)**: (3,3) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (5,3) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 11). **Invalid**.\n\nThis path allows the snake to survive longer without immediately hitting a dead end.\n\n### Food Accessibility\n\nBoth food items are under the snake's body:\n\n- (5,2): Under segment 11.\n- (3,6): Under segment 3.\n\nTo eat them:\n\n1. The body segment must move away, vacating the cell.\n2. The head must then move onto the vacated food cell.\n\nHowever, for a body segment to vacate its cell:\n\n- It must be the tail segment when the snake moves, as only the tail's previous position is vacated after a move.\n- For (5,2) to become the tail, it would take 7 moves without eating (since it's segment 11 out of 18). But the food disappears after turn 89 (current turn 84 + 5 more turns), so it's impossible.\n- Similarly, (3,6) would take 15 moves to become the tail, but it disappears after turn 91.\n\nThus, **neither food can be eaten within their remaining lifespan**.\n\n### Optimal Strategy\n\nGiven that the food cannot be eaten, the best strategy is to **maximize survival time** by navigating to open areas and avoiding immediate dead ends.\n\n- Moving **Up (U)** leads to a quick dead end on turn 86.\n- Moving **Down (D)** allows for more extended survival by navigating towards less crowded areas.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above, the optimal immediate action is to move **Down (D)** at turn 84 to (1,4), followed by moving right to explore open spaces.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the **immediate action for the current Turn 84**, not the sequence. Given the analysis, the best immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{D}",

However, the key insight is that the snake can safely move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, as the tail will move forward, avoiding a collision. \n\nGiven the current state:\n- **Head at (4,4)**, direction **U**.\n- **Possible moves**: U (to (4,5)), L (to (3,4)), or R (to (5,4)) — but R leads to a body collision (segment 15 at (5,4)), so only U or L are viable.\n- **Food**: All food is under the body, with (3,6) having the shortest lifespan (3 turns).\n\n### Immediate Action (Turn 90):\n- **Move L to (3,4)**: This avoids the dead-end created by moving U to (4,5), where the snake would be entirely surrounded at turn 91. Moving L to (3,4) at least opens the possibility of future moves, though the snake will still be constrained.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Turn 90 (Move L to (3,4))**:\n   - New head position: (3,4).\n   - Tail is at (5,2), which will move to (5,3) if no food is eaten (since the snake does not grow).\n   - The cell (3,4) is free, so this move is safe.\n\n2. **Turn 91 (From (3,4))**:\n   - Adjacent cells: \n     - U (3,5): Occupied by segment 9.\n     - D (3,3): Occupied by segment 3.\n     - L (2,4): Occupied by segment 5.\n     - R (4,4): Occupied by segment 1.\n   - All adjacent cells are occupied, but the snake can move into the tail cell (5,3) if it were adjacent (it is not). Thus, the snake has no safe move at turn 91 and will collide regardless of the direction chosen.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe snake is in a no-win situation where any move at turn 90 leads to an inevitable collision at turn 91. However, moving L to (3,4) is the least immediately harmful option, as moving U to (4,5) also leads to a dead-end with no escape. \n\n### Final Action:\n\\boxed{L}",

Moving right (R) is invalid because it's the reverse of the current left (L) direction.\n2. **Food Under Body**: There is positive food under the snake's body at (3, 6), (2, 5), and (5, 3), but the snake cannot eat them immediately because the body must first move away from these positions.\n3. **Tail Position**: The tail is at (5, 3), which is not adjacent to the head, so moving into the tail's position is not an option here.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the current state, the snake has no valid moves that avoid collision. All possible moves (L, U, D) result in the head moving into a cell occupied by the snake's body, which is fatal. \n\n### Final Decision:\nSince the snake must move and all possible moves lead to collision, the game ends here. However, since we must provide an action, we choose the least harmful option (though all are equally fatal in this case).\n\n\\boxed{U} \n\n### Note:\nThis move will result in the snake's head colliding with its body at (3, 5), ending the game. The snake is trapped with no possible safe moves at Turn 91.",
