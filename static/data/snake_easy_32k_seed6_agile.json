Then \"(6, 6, 9, 1)\" is (6,6), value 1, life span 9. And \"(6, 5, 10, 1)\" – that might be (6,5), value 1, life span 10? But it says \"Life Span and Value\", so probably (x,y), life span, value? Let's see the format.\n> \n> In the input, it says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span:\" and then lists like ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ). But here it's written as (1,4,9,1), which is confusing. Perhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value)? That doesn't make sense because value should be first or something. Let me read the state:\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n> - (1, 4, 9, 1)\n> - (1, 2, 9, 1)\n> - (6, 6, 9, 1)\n> - (6, 5, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> I think there might be a mistake in the notation. Probably, it's meant to be (x,y), value, life_span. But here it has four numbers. (1,4,9,1) – that could be x=1, y=4, life_span=9, value=1? But the text says \"Value and Life Span\", so value first?

No, that can't be, because value is usually ±1.\n> \n> Let me read carefully: \" (1, 4, 9, 1) \" – I think this is likely (x=1, y=4, life_span=9, value=1), but the order might be wrong. The core rules say: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so it should be clear.\n> \n> Perhaps in the state, it's listed as (x,y, life_span, value) or something.

Let's see.\n> \n> At turn t=1, food has life span N, it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (1,4) with life span 9 at turn 1, it will disappear at turn 1+9=10?

Let's clarify.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, countdown = L, at turn t+1, countdown = L-1, ..., at turn t + L - 1, countdown = 1, then at turn t + L, it disappears? No.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> Suppose at turn T, food is spawned with life span N.\n> \n> At turn T, countdown = N (decreases to N-1? or starts at N?)\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, if food has countdown C, then during the turn, if not eaten, at the end of turn, C decreases by 1. If C was 1, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> But for simplicity, since we're at turn t, and life span given, it has that many turns left.\n> \n> For example, at turn 1, life span 9 for (1,4), so it will be available for turns 1 through 9, and disappear after turn 9 or at turn 10?

Since I just moved, the tail is at (1,3), and if I move down to (1,3), I would be eating the cell, but (1,3) has no food, so it's just moving to the tail position, which is allowed because the tail will move away.\n> \n> Rule: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail moves forward.\n> \n> So moving to (1,3) is safe, as long as it's not a body segment other than tail.\n> \n> Here, only one body segment, which is tail, so moving to (1,3) is fine; head moves to (1,3), tail moves to (1,4)? Let's see.\n> \n> After eating at turn 2, snake: positions [(1,4), (1,3)] head at (1,4).\n> \n> If I move D to (1,3), which is the tail cell. Since it's the tail, head moves to (1,3), and since no food eaten (cell is empty), the tail moves away from (1,3) to... the body: the tail was at (1,3), head at (1,4), now head moves to (1,3), so the new head is at (1,3), and the body segment at (1,3) is now the new tail or something.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail leaves the last cell; if food, tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 2, after moving to (1,4) and eating, snake is [(1,4), (1,3)] with head at (1,4).\n> \n> Now turn 3, move D to (1,3). (1,3) is occupied by the tail. Since it's the tail, and head moves there, but (1,3) has no food, so: head moves to (1,3), and since no food, the tail is removed, so the snake becomes just [(1,3)] again? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> When the head moves to a cell:\n> \n> - If the cell has food, eat it, grow: new head position, body segments stay, so length increases by one.\n> \n> - If no food, move: new head position, tail removed, so length same.\n> \n> But when moving to the tail cell, it's special because the tail will move.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to the current tail position, and there is no food there, then head moves to that cell, and since it's the tail, the tail was there but moves away, so the cell becomes head, and the previous tail is removed, but since it was the only other segment, now snake has one segment again? No.\n> \n> Example: snake with two segments: head at A, tail at B.\n> \n> After move: head moves to C.\n> \n> If C is not food, new head at C, tail moves from B, so new positions: C and A, with head at C, tail at A.\n> \n> If C has food, new head at C, tail stays at B, so positions C, A, B with head C, tail B.\n> \n> Now, if C is the same as B, that is, moving to tail position.\n> \n> If head moves to the current tail position, and that cell has no food, then: head moves to that cell (which was tail), and the tail is removed, but since it was moving to itself, it's like the snake shortens or something? But in standard rules, moving to tail position is allowed because the tail moves away.\n> \n> So, head moves to the tail cell, which is empty (since no food), so no eat, just move. New head position is the tail cell, and the tail segment is removed (since it moved from there), and the body segment becomes the new tail.\n> \n> In two-segment snake: positions [H, T]\n> \n> Move to T: new head at T, and since no food, tail is removed. But the tail was at T, so removing it, and the previous head position is now the body, but since tail is removed, only one segment left: [T] with head at T.\n> \n> But T was the tail, now it's head, but the cell was occupied, but after move, it's free except for head.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think the snake moves to the new position.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell, if that cell is the current tail position, and no food, then the head occupies that cell, and the tail is removed, so the snake has one less segment? That doesn't make sense for growth.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, the tail follows, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> If head moves to the current tail cell, it means the head and tail are swapping positions or something.\n> \n> In a linear snake, if head is at (x,y), tail at (x',y'), and head moves to (x',y'), which is the tail position.\n> \n> Then after move, the new head is at (x',y'), and the tail was at (x',y'), but it moves to where? The body segments shift.\n> \n> For example, snake segments: [H, B] where B is tail.\n> \n> After moving head to B's position: new head at B's position, and since no food, the tail (B) is removed, so the new snake is just [H'] at the position where B was, and the previous head position is empty.\n> \n> So the snake shortens to one segment.\n> \n> But that seems odd, and it might cause issues, but in terms of collision, since the tail moved away, it's safe.\n> \n> In this case, for a two-segment snake, moving to the tail position causes the snake to become one segment again, effectively shortening.\n> \n> But in terms of game, it might not be intended, but according to rules, it should be possible.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's assume that moving to the tail cell is safe and the snake behaves as per standard rules.\n> \n> In this specific case, for my plan, it might not be necessary.\n> \n> Back to the decision.\n> \n> From (2,3), if I move L to (1,3) at turn 1.\n> \n> Then at turn 2, I can move U to (1,4) to eat the food.\n> \n> After that, snake: head at (1,4), body at (1,3), length 2.\n> \n> Head direction U.\n> \n> Now turn 3, from (1,4), I can move U to (1,5), D to (1,3), R to (2,4), L to wall.\n> \n> If I move D to (1,3), which is the tail position. (1,3) has no food, so if I move there, head moves to (1,3), and since no food, tail is removed, so snake becomes single segment at (1,3). But (1,3) was the body, now head, and tail gone. So effectively, the snake shortens to length 1 at (1,3).\n> \n> But that means I lost the growth from eating food, which is bad. Because I ate food to grow, but then by moving back to the tail, I shortened again.\n> \n> So to avoid that, I should not move back immediately.\n> \n> From (1,4), better to move to a new cell, like U to (1,5) or R to (2,4).\n> \n> Similarly, if I go to (1,2) instead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (1,2), which is below.\n> \n> But let's think about the grid.\n> \n> The internal obstacle at (3,2) might block some paths.\n> \n> Since all food is positive, and no negative food mentioned, I can eat all, but need to plan a path.\n> \n> Another option: go for the food at (6,5) or (6,6), but it's farther, so I might eat the closer food first.\n> \n> Also, life span is long, so no hurry.\n> \n> But to maximize score, eating sooner is better to grow and eat more.\n> \n> But with risk.\n> \n> Now, for the sequence, I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Let's outline a possible sequence.\n> \n> Start at turn 1: snake at (2,3), dir L.\n> \n> Option: Move L to (1,3)  -- this is safe, no wall, no obstacle.\n> \n> After turn 1, snake at (1,3), dir L?

That means the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, because x=0 and x=7 are walls, and similarly for y. Walls take up the whole row or column, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is deadly. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2), which I must avoid.\n> \n> Current turn is t=2.\n> \n> Snake positions: only [(2,2)], so the snake is just a single segment, the head. That means it's length 1 right now. Head direction is down (D), so it's facing downwards.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,4) with value 1 and life span 8. Since it's turn 2, it will disappear after 8 turns, so at turn 10? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if it spawns at some turn, it lasts N turns. But here, it's given at turn 2, with life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 2 + 8 - 1? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food that appears at turn T with life span N, it exists from turn T to turn T + N - 1, and disappears at turn T + N. For example, at turn T, life span N, so after turn T, it has N-1 left, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> But in the state, it's given with life span at current turn. So for food at (1,4), life span 8 at turn 2, meaning it will be there for 8 turns starting from now, so it disappears after turn 9? Let's think.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the turn it's spawned, countdown is N, then next turn N-1, down to 0, and when countdown is 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning? I need to be precise.\n> \n> Typically in such games, when countdown reaches 0, the food is removed before the next turn. But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Assume that at the start of turn T, if a food has life span L, it is present during turn T, and at the end of turn T, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> But for movement and eating, it's during the turn.\n> \n> To simplify: food is present on a cell as long as its life span > 0. At the beginning of turn, if life span > 0, it can be eaten that turn. After being eaten or when life span reaches 0, it's removed.\n> \n> In this case, all foods have life span given at turn 2: (1,4) life span 8, so it will be there until turn 2 + 8 - 1 = turn 9, I think. Let's not overcomplicate; I can think in terms of remaining turns.\n> \n> Since we're at turn 2, and life span is 8, it has 8 turns left including this one, so it will disappear after turn 9? Turn 2: life span 8, after turn 2, it becomes 7, and so on, until after turn 9, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 10. But for turn 2 to turn 9, it's present.\n> \n> Similarly, others: (1,2) life span 8, (6,6) life span 8, (6,5) life span 9.\n> \n> (6,5) has life span 9, so it lasts one turn longer.\n> \n> All values are +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Snake is at (2,2), head direction down.\n> \n> Since snake has only one segment, no body to worry about, except that if it eats food, it will grow.\n> \n> Also, food can be under the snake, but here snake is at (2,2), and food is at (1,4), (1,2), (6,6), (6,5), none of which is (2,2), so no issue.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action for turn 2, and think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse?

So cells like (x,0) for any x, (x,7), (0,y), (7,y) are walls. Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> (2,2) is at y=2, so moving down to (2,1) is possible, since y=1 is playable.\n> \n> Moving left to (1,2), which is also playable.\n> \n> Moving right to (3,2), but (3,2) is an internal obstacle, so I cannot move there. (3,2) is occupied by a wall obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> So from (2,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - D: to (2,1) - open\n> \n> - L: to (1,2) - but (1,2) has food?

After eating, the new segment is added, so positions become [(1,2), (2,2)] or something? When snake moves and eats, the head moves to new position, and since it ate, a new segment is added at the tail, but since it was length 1, after eating, it becomes length 2, with head at new position and tail at previous position.\n> \n> Standard snake: when snake eats, it grows, so after move, head is at new cell, and if it ate, tail doesn't move, so body segments include the previous positions.\n> \n> Initially, snake at S: [(2,2)] , head only.\n> \n> If I move to (1,2) and eat food, then after move, head is at (1,2), and since it ate, it grows, so the tail stays at (2,2), so positions: [(1,2), (2,2)] , head at (1,2), tail at (2,2).\n> \n> If I don't eat, just move, say to (2,1), no food there, so snake moves to (2,1), and since no eat, tail moves away, but tail was only one, so after move, it's just [(2,1)].\n> \n> But here, moving to (1,2) has food, so eating and growing.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) has no food, I think.

Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 3, countdown is 7, then turn 4 it's 6, ..., down to turn 9 countdown=1, then on turn 10 it should be gone.

Value is given as 1 for all, and it says \"Value and Life Span\", so (1,4,7,1) means (x,y, life_span, value), I think.

But (2,2) was the tail, so when head moves there, and tail is removed, but since it's the same cell, effectively the snake is now at [(2,2)] only, length 1? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell. If no food, the tail is removed from its position, so the snake moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, if head is at A, tail at B.\n> \n> If head moves to a cell C.\n> \n> If C is not food, then after head moves to C, the tail is removed, so the new positions are [C, A], since the body segment that was at A is now behind head.\n> \n> Let's specify coordinates.\n> \n> At turn t, positions: head at (1,2), body at (2,2). So segment 0: (1,2), segment 1: (2,2).\n> \n> Now, if I move right to (2,2), which is where segment 1 is.\n> \n> After moving, head moves to new position (2,2). Since (2,2) is not food (food is elsewhere), no growth, so tail is removed. Tail was segment 1 at (2,2), so it is removed. But the head is now at (2,2), which was the old tail position.

It's turn 5, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So, any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Internal obstacle at (3,2). So, walls are at all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, plus (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2). So, the snake is vertical, head up at (1,4), body down to (1,3) and (1,2). Head direction is U, which is up, so moving upward.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,6), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including this turn, so if not eaten by turn 10, it's gone? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, so it will be gone at turn t + N.\n> \n> Current turn is 5.\n> \n> For (6,6): life span 5, so disappears after 5 turns, meaning it will be present until turn 5 + 5 - 1? No: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L. Because countdown starts decreasing from this turn.\n> \n> For example, at turn 5, life span 5: after turn 5, countdown to 4; turn 6, to 3; ... turn 9, to 0; so after turn 9, it disappears, so not present on turn 10. Similarly, it can be eaten on turns 5 to 9 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5): life span 6, disappears after turn 5 + 6 = 11? Turn 5: life span 6, after turn 5, it becomes 5, so on turn 6, life span 5, and so on, until turn 10: life span 1, after turn 10, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 10.\n> \n> Generally, food with life span L at turn t can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6): life span 9, so can be eaten from turn 5 to turn 13 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (1,4), moving up. Possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, R, but not D, because no instant reverse. So, from (1,4), moving up would go to (1,5), left to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, so not possible, right to (2,4), or down to (1,3) but that's the body, and I can't move opposite to current direction anyway.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so I cannot move D on next turn.\n> \n> Available moves:\n> \n> - U: to (1,5). Is this valid? (1,5) is within bounds? Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells with 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6 are free, except obstacles.\n> \n> (1,5): x=1, y=5, should be free. Snake body is at (1,3) and (1,2), so (1,5) is empty? Let's see grid.\n> \n> List all occupied cells.\n> \n> Walls: all (x,y) with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and internal (3,2).\n> \n> So for movement, I cannot move to walls.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2).

Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, it's playable. Similarly, x=6 is playable.\n> \n> So grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except walls at borders and (3,2).\n> \n> (3,2) is internal obstacle, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Now, from (1,4), head U.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (1,5). (1,5) is empty, no wall, not snake, not obstacle. Safe.\n> \n> - D: to (1,3).

(2,4) should be free? No walls, no snake, no obstacle? Snake is at (1,2),(1,3),(1,4), so (2,4) empty. Yes.\n> \n> So only two possible moves: U to (1,5) or R to (2,4).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (1,6): at (1,6), which is directly above the snake.

But there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Let's see the snake: positions [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]. Head at (1,4), tail at (1,2).\n> \n> If I move to (1,5), then positions: head to (1,5), body: (1,4) becomes new body, (1,3) becomes second body, tail (1,2) still there. After move, snake: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, if not eating, it moves head to new position, and tail moves off, so length same.\n> \n> If no food eaten, snake moves: new head position, then body follows, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake movement.\n> \n> Here, if I move U to (1,5), no food there, so snake becomes: head at (1,5), then body segments: previous head (1,4) becomes first body, (1,3) becomes second body, and tail (1,2) is removed. So new positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)].\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R to (2,4), no food, so snake: head (2,4), then (1,4) becomes body, (1,3) becomes body, tail (1,2) removed, so [(2,4), (1,4), (1,3)].\n> \n> Now, food at (1,6): if I go to (1,5) on this turn, then next turn I can go U to (1,6). (1,6) has food, so if I eat it, snake grows: head moves to (1,6), and tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (1,6), then previous head (1,5) becomes body, and the tail stays, so snake becomes [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)].\n> \n> Length increases by one.\n> \n> But is there tail reward danger?

Walls at x=0 and x=7, so cells from x=1 to x=6 are free, similarly y=1 to y=6. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are valid, y=1 to y=6 valid.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: (1,5) head, (1,4) body, (1,3) tail. So on the grid, x=1, y=3,4,5 occupied by snake.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (6,6): which is bottom-right? y=6 is the top row since y=0 bottom? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom, but in coordinates, it might be specified. The problem doesn't specify, but since walls y=0 and y=7, and snake at y=5,4,3, and food at y=6, which is adjacent to y=7 wall, so y=6 is the top row if y increases upwards.\n> \n> Head direction U, which is (x,y+1), so increasing y is up, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top wall. So y=6 is just below top wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right wall.\n> \n> So playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Now, internal obstacle at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,6): top-right corner\n> \n> - (6,5): right column, y=5\n> \n> - (1,6): left column, top row, since y=6\n> \n> (1,6) is directly above the snake head. Snake head at (1,5), so (1,6) is one cell above.\n> \n> Since head is moving Up, if I move U to (1,6), I can eat the food there immediately, because food is at (1,6), and head moves to it.\n> \n> But there's a rule about Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (1,3), which is not adjacent to head. Head at (1,5), tail at (1,3), so they are two cells apart, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (1,5) and (1,4) are adjacent, but (1,5) and (1,3) are not directly adjacent; there's (1,4) in between.\n> \n> So for (1,6) food, if I move U to (1,6), I eat the food, snake grows, so new positions: head at (1,6), then body at (1,5), (1,4), tail at (1,3)? When you eat food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, you grow by one segment, so the tail stays in place or something? Let's clarify from rules.\n> \n> The rules don't specify the growth mechanics, but typically in snake, when you eat food, you add a segment, so the next time you move, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: before moving, snake is at positions. After moving to a food cell, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added where the tail was or something? No.\n> \n> Standard: when you move to a cell with food, you eat it, so the head occupies that cell, and since you ate food, the tail doesn't move this turn, so the new tail position is the same as before, meaning the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> For example: current snake: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] head to tail.\n> \n> If I move U to (1,6) which has food, then after move: head at (1,6), and since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so body segments: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) remains, but now (1,6) is head, (1,5) is first body, etc., so positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] so length 4.\n> \n> If no food, move to (1,6), head to (1,6), tail moves off (1,3) to... when no food, tail moves, so positions [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)].\n> \n> But with food, tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, for (1,6) food, if I move U, I eat it, grow to length 4.\n> \n> Now, is there Tail Reward Danger? The rule: \"if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n> \n> Here, after eating, tail is at (1,3), head at (1,6), not adjacent. Adjacent cells to head at (1,6) are (1,5), (1,7) but y=7 wall, (0,6) x=0 wall, (2,6). (1,5) is body, not tail. Tail is at (1,3), far away.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> But (1,6) is on the border, y=6, adjacent to y=7 wall. After moving to (1,6), head is at (1,6), which has neighbors: U: (1,7) wall, D: (1,5) body, L: (0,6) wall, R: (2,6). So only R is possible next move? But we need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 6.\n> \n> Possible actions on turn 6: since head direction U, I can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> - U: to (1,6), which has food, eat it, grow to length 4.\n> \n> - L: to (0,5), but x=0 is wall, so collision, die. Cannot move L.\n> \n> - R: to (2,5), which is empty.\n> \n> So only two choices: U or R. D is not allowed because reverse.\n> \n> Current direction U, opposite D, so cannot move D.\n> \n> So choices: U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, if I move U to (1,6) on turn 6:\n> \n> - Eat food at (1,6), so score +1, snake grows to positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,3). Length 4.\n> \n> - Head direction now U, since moved U.\n> \n> - Food at (1,6) is eaten, removed.\n> \n> - Other food: (6,6) life_span=4 → after turn 6, on turn 7, life_span=3\n> \n> - (6,5) life_span=5 → on turn 7, life_span=4\n> \n> - (1,6) gone.\n> \n> Now, on turn 7, head at (1,6), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R, but U to (1,7) is wall, die. L to (0,6) wall, die. R to (2,6) is possible.\n> \n> Only R is safe? D to (1,5) is possible, but current direction U, moving D is reverse? Direction is U, moving D is opposite, so cannot move D? \"No instant reverse\" means on the very next turn, cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> After moving U to (1,6), the new direction is U. So on turn 7, from (1,6), direction U, I can move U, L, R, but U is wall, L is wall, so only R to (2,6) is possible.\n> \n> Move to (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is empty? Yes, no food there.\n> \n> So move to (2,6), no food, so snake moves: head to (2,6), body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — tail (1,3) moves off? When no food eaten, tail moves.\n> \n> After turn 6: positions [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] head to tail.\n> \n> Move to (2,6): head to (2,6), then body segments follow: the segment that was at (1,6) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So from positions: head was (1,6), after move to (2,6), new head at (2,6). Then the body segment that was at (1,5) moves to (1,6), the segment at (1,4) moves to (1,5), and the tail at (1,3) moves to (1,4). So new positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]\n> \n> Length still 4.\n> \n> Now head at (2,6), direction? Since moved from (1,6) to (2,6), that's right, so new direction R.\n> \n> Food: (6,6) at turn 7 life_span=3, (6,5) life_span=4.\n> \n> On turn 7, after move, food (6,6) life_span decreases to 3, etc.\n> \n> But now head at (2,6), which is near top-right.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,6): direction R, so can move R, U, D, but not L (reverse).\n> \n> R to (3,6), U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5).\n> \n> U to (2,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (2,5) possible.\n> \n> R to (3,6) possible.\n> \n> L to (1,6) but L is opposite to current direction R? Current direction after move to (2,6) is R, so moving L would be reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So moves: R to (3,6) or D to (2,5).\n> \n> (3,6) is empty? Yes.\n> \n> (2,5) is empty? But there is food at (6,5), not here.\n> \n> (2,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, I need to think further, but this seems risky because I'm stuck near the wall with few options.\n> \n> From (2,6), if I move R to (3,6), then head at (3,6), direction R.\n> \n> Then from (3,6), can move R to (4,6), U wall, D to (3,5), not L.\n> \n> R to (4,6) possible, D to (3,5) possible.\n> \n> And so on.\n> \n> But I need to get to the food at (6,6) or (6,5), which are far.\n> \n> If from (2,6) I move D to (2,5), then head at (2,5), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Then from (2,5), can move D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5), not U (reverse).\n> \n> And so on.\n> \n> But let's see the other option: on turn 6, instead of U, I move R to (2,5).\n> \n> That might be better.\n> \n> First option led to a dead end at (2,6) with only down or right, but right might be ok.\n> \n> But let's consider moving R on turn 6.\n> \n> Turn 6: move R to (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is empty, no food there.\n> \n> So snake moves: head to (2,5), then body: (1,5) moves to? Positions: original [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n> \n> After move R to (2,5): head at (2,5), then the segment that was at (1,5) is now body, but it moves to the new position? Head to (2,5), then the first body segment moves to where head was, (1,5), but (1,5) is now occupied? No, when head moves, the body follows.\n> \n> After move: head at (2,5), then the body segment that was at (1,4) moves to (1,5)? Let's think.\n> \n> Previous positions: index 0 head (1,5), index 1 body (1,4), index 2 tail (1,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (2,5), the new head is at (2,5). Then, the segment that was at position 1 (1,4) moves to the previous position of head, which is (1,5). Then the segment that was at position 2 (1,3) moves to the previous position of segment 1, which was (1,4). So new positions: head (2,5), body (1,5), tail (1,4).

Let's confirm: walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, meaning the grid goes from x=1 to x=6. Similarly for y, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. But y=0 and y=7 are borders, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, I think. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are valid, similarly y=1 to y=6.

Since grid is 1 to 6, moving to x<1 or x>6 or y<1 or y>6 is invalid, but since walls are at x=0 and x=7, etc., the cells outside 1-6 are walls, so we can only be on (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Also internal obstacle at (3,2), so cannot move to (3,2).\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4)]\n> \n> So head at (2,5), body at (1,5), tail at (1,4).\n> \n> If snake moves, the tail will move away, so the cell (1,4) will be free after move, but only if snake moves forward.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - U: (2,6) — is this valid? y=6 is within 1-6, and not a wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. Check if occupied by body: body is at (1,5) and (1,4), so (2,6) is free. Also, not obstacle; obstacle at (3,2), so yes.\n> \n> - D: (2,4) — y=4, free? Body: (1,5) and (1,4), so (2,4) is free. Not obstacle.\n> \n> - L: (1,5) — but (1,5) is the body segment. Now, collision: if head touches body, it dies, except for the tail if we move into it, but only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

Not the tail. Tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> So (1,5) is a body segment, not the tail. If head moves to (1,5), it would be colliding with the body segment at (1,5), which is not vacating; it's still occupied until after the move.\n> \n> Rule: \"head touches any body segment\" — if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it collides and dies, except if that cell is the tail and the tail is moving away.\n> \n> Here, (1,5) is not the tail; it's the second segment. So moving to (1,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (2,4): (2,4) is free now, since no one there.\n> \n> Moving up to (2,6): free.\n> \n> Moving right to (3,5): (3,5) — is it free? Not occupied by snake or obstacle? Snake at (2,5),(1,5),(1,4), so (3,5) free. Obstacle at (3,2), not (3,5). Walls: x=3, y=5 within 1-6, so ok.\n> \n> But moving left to (1,5) is invalid because it's a body collision.\n> \n> Also, cannot move left because opposite direction?

The problem doesn't say, so I think for this scenario, we only have these food items, and we need to plan to eat them.\n> \n> The state input has \"Food Positions\", so I think these are the current food, and no new food is added, or it might be, but not specified. To be safe, I'll assume only these food exist for now, and we need to eat them within their life span.\n> \n> Now, let's think about distances.\n> \n> From head (2,5) to food:\n> \n> - (6,6): Manhattan distance |6-2| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n> \n> - (6,5): |6-2| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4\n> \n> - (1,6): |1-2| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n> \n> - (4,4): |4-2| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n> \n> (1,6) is closest, distance 2.\n> \n> But (1,6) is above (1,5), which is the body segment.\n> \n> Current snake: head (2,5), body (1,5), tail (1,4)\n> \n> (1,6) is directly above (1,5), which is a body segment.\n> \n> If I want to eat (1,6), I need to move to it when head is on (1,6) and it's free.\n> \n> But currently, (1,6) has food, so it's not occupied by snake, I think? Snake positions are (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), so (1,6) is free, has food.\n> \n> To eat (1,6), I can go up from (1,5) or something.\n> \n> But from current position, I can move U to (2,6), which is not (1,6).\n> \n> From (2,5), moving U to (2,6) gets me closer to (1,6)? (2,6) to (1,6) is left, distance 1.\n> \n> But I need to be able to move to (1,6) from there.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the snake changes.\n> \n> Let's simulate possible actions.\n> \n> First, at turn 7, possible actions: U, D, R.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (2,6)\n> \n> Then snake: head (2,6), body (2,5), tail (1,5) — positions [(2,6), (2,5), (1,5)]\n> \n> Direction: since moved up, new head direction U.\n> \n> Food at (1,6) is still there.\n> \n> From (2,6), I can move L to (1,6) to eat the food, since (1,6) has food.\n> \n> But (1,6) is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (1,5), which is below (1,6).\n> \n> If I move to (1,6), I eat the food, snake grows: new head (1,6), then body: previous head (2,6) and so on.\n> \n> After eating, snake length increases by 1, so positions: new head (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), and tail (1,5) — but (1,5) is still there? Let's see.\n> \n> When head moves to food cell, it eats it, so the tail doesn't move; it grows.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length increases, so tail stays, and new segment added.\n> \n> Specifically: head moves to food cell, consumes food, then a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, and snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, snake is [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> Head moves to new cell with food: new head position, then the body segments move as usual, but since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position, so the tail doesn't advance; it stays, and a new segment is added behind.\n> \n> After move and eat: new head at food cell, then the previous head becomes first body, previous body1 becomes body2, ..., and the previous tail remains as tail, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? I'm confused.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail end, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and the new segment is the new tail, but since tail didn't move, the position remains.\n> \n> Example: snake positions [H, B, T] at cells (Hx,Hy), (Bx,By), (Tx,Ty)\n> \n> Head moves to new cell (Nx,Ny) with food.\n> \n> Then, after move: head is at (Nx,Ny), body segments: the previous head (Hx,Hy) becomes body1, previous body (Bx,By) becomes body2, and the tail (Tx,Ty) remains as tail, but since a new segment is added, the tail is now the previous tail, and a new segment is added at (Tx,Ty)? No.\n> \n> Typically: the head moves to new position, consumes food, then the body moves: the segment that was at H moves to N, but since it's the head, it's now at N. Then the body segment that was at B moves to the previous position of H, which is now occupied by body1. Let's think of the segments.\n> \n> After head moves to new cell with food:\n> \n> - The new head position is the food cell.\n> \n> - The first body segment moves to the old head position.\n> \n> - The second body segment moves to the old first body position.\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - The tail segment stays where it is, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? No, the new segment is added, so the tail position doesn't change, but the tail is now a new segment at the same position.\n> \n> In terms of list: before eat: positions [P0=head, P1, P2, ..., Pk=tail]\n> \n> After moving to food: new positions [new_head, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk]  because the head moves to new cell, P0 becomes body, P1 to Pk remain, but Pk is tail, and since food eaten, no tail movement, so positions: [new_head, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with Pk still tail.\n> \n> So the snake grows by one segment, added at the tail end.\n> \n> In this case, from [H, B, T] to [new_H, H, B, T] with T still tail.\n> \n> So the tail cell remains occupied, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so it's like the tail stays.\n> \n> Back to the case.\n> \n> If at some point, head moves to food cell, and that cell is adjacent to the current tail, then after eating, the new head is on the food cell, and the tail is still there, but since the snake grew, the tail didn't move, so if the head is now adjacent to the tail, it might collide later, but not immediately.\n> \n> The \"Tail Reward Danger\" specifically: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> So it's when the tail cell itself has food, and head moves to it to eat, but since tail is there, it's collision? But the rule says: \"the tail cell has positive food\", and \"eating it kills\" because after eating, the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> Let's read: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Key: the food is on the tail cell.\n> \n> And head is adjacent to tail, so if head moves to the tail cell to eat the food, but when it moves to that cell, the tail is there, so it collides with body before eating? But the rule implies that you can attempt to eat it, but it causes death because after growth.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides immediately, except if it's the tail and tail moves away.\n> \n> But here, if food is on tail cell, and head moves to it, since tail is there, it's a body collision, so it dies immediately, not even eating.\n> \n> But the rule says \"eating it kills\", implying that it can be eaten but then collides after.\n> \n> There might be a nuance.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So, if food is under the body, it can be eaten only after the body moves away and head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, for tail, if food is on tail cell, it can be eaten only when the tail moves away and head moves to that cell later.\n> \n> But in the \"Tail Reward Danger\", it says when head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> So, if head is adjacent, and tail cell has food, if head moves to tail cell to eat, but at that moment, tail is there, so collision.\n> \n> But after tail moves away, it might be possible.\n> \n> The danger is when head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, and you move head to tail cell to eat, but since tail is still there, collision occurs.\n> \n> If tail moves away first, then head can move to that cell safely to eat the food.\n> \n> But in the adjacent case, if head is next to tail, and tail cell has food, moving head to tail cell causes collision because tail is there.\n> \n> And after that, if it were possible, the growth would cause new tail to be added, but since collision, it dies.\n> \n> So, essentially, you cannot eat food on the tail cell if head is adjacent; it will cause collision.\n> \n> Only when tail is not adjacent, or after it moves.\n> \n> But in this state, no food on tail, so no issue.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> At turn 7, head at (2,5), options: U, D, R.\n> \n> Goal: eat food, avoid dying.\n> \n> Also, need to think long-term.\n> \n> First, (1,6) is close, at distance 2.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,6) at turn 7.\n> \n> Then at turn 8, from (2,6), I can move L to (1,6) to eat the food at (1,6).\n> \n> But (1,6) has life span 7, available until turn 13, so no hurry.\n> \n> After moving U to (2,6), snake: [(2,6), (2,5), (1,5)]\n> \n> Direction U.\n> \n> From (2,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction.

Positions: new head at (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), and the previous tail (1,5) becomes the last body, and a new segment is added at (1,5), so now snake has two segments at (1,5)? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> When eating food, the head moves to the new cell, the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to the old head position, second body to old first body position, and so on, but the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail position remains occupied, and the new segment is at that position, but since tail didn't move, it's like the tail is duplicated.\n> \n> In list terms: positions before: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to food and eating: new positions [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T]  because H is now body, B1 to T remain, and T is still tail, but since new segment added, it's [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T] with T as tail, and the new segment is T, so it's longer.\n> \n> For example, from [ (2,6), (2,5), (1,5) ] with head (2,6), body (2,5), tail (1,5)\n> \n> Move to (1,6) with food: new head (1,6), then the previous head (2,6) becomes first body, previous body (2,5) becomes second body, and the previous tail (1,5) remains as tail, but since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position of the tail, so the tail is now at (1,5), and a new segment is added at (1,5), but that's the same cell, so it's occupied, but the snake has two segments at (1,5)? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard Snake mechanics: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move on that turn; the snake grows by one segment, so the new length is old length +1, with the head at new position, and the tail stays where it is.\n> \n> Positions: the new head is at the food cell, the first body segment is at the old head position, the second body segment at the old first body position, ..., and the tail is at the old tail position, and since no movement for tail, it stays, and a new segment is not added; the tail remains, so the position list has the same tail position as before, but now it's part of the body, and the new tail is the old tail position, but since no move, it's the same.\n> \n> For a snake of length L, positions [P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{L-1}] with P0 head, P_{L-1} tail.\n> \n> When head moves to new position Q with food:\n> \n> - The new head position is Q.\n> \n> - The new body position 1 is P0 (old head)\n> \n> - New body position 2 is P1 (old body1)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New body position L-1 is P_{L-2} (old body L-2 or tail-1)\n> \n> - New body position L is P_{L-1} (old tail)\n> \n> - And since food eaten, a new segment is added, so new tail position is P_{L-1} (old tail), so the tail stays at P_{L-1}, and the new segment is at P_{L-1}, but it's the same cell, so the cell P_{L-1} is still occupied by the tail, and no new cell is added; the snake just doesn't move the tail, so the length increases.\n> \n> In terms of grid, the head moves forward to Q, the body segments move to the previous position of the segment ahead, but the tail does not move; it stays, so the new positions are: head at Q, body1 at P0, body2 at P1, ..., body_{L-1} at P_{L-2}, and tail at P_{L-1} (same as before).\n> \n> Then the snake has length L+1, with positions [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{L-1}].\n> \n> For example, with L=3: [H, B, T]\n> \n> After eating at Q: new positions [Q, H, B] and T is gone?

But when I move, the head goes to new cell, then the body segments follow: so if head moves to (2,5), then the body that was at (2,5) needs to move to where? The segment that was at (2,5) would move to the next, but the next is the head's old position? Sequence: after move, new head position, then the first body segment moves to old head position, second body to old first body, etc.\n> \n> Specifically: if snake is [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move direction, new head is H' = H + direction.\n> \n> Then new positions: [H', H, B1, B2, ...] so the tail B_last is removed, unless food eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail is removed, so the cell that was tail is free.\n> \n> But if I move head to a cell that is currently occupied by body, except the tail under certain conditions.\n> \n> General collision: head touches any body segment after the move.\n> \n> After move, if new head position is the same as any body segment position in the new snake, it collides.\n> \n> In this case, if I move left to (2,5), which is currently B1.\n> \n> After move: new head at (2,5), then the body segments: the segment that was at H (3,5) moves to (2,5)? No.\n> \n> Old positions: H=(3,5), B1=(2,5), B2=(1,5)\n> \n> Move head left to (2,5): so new head position (2,5)\n> \n> Then, the first body segment (which was at old H (3,5)) moves to? The new body segment positions: the segment that was head is now at (2,5), so it becomes the new B1. Then the old B1 at (2,5) should move to the position where the head was? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the next segment moves to the old head position, and so on.\n> \n> So: after moving head to (2,5):\n> \n> - New head: (2,5)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (3,5) (old head) moves to... it becomes the new first body segment, but where? The new first body segment is at the old head position (3,5)? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically: the head moves to a new cell. Then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So positions after move:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position, say P_new.\n> \n> - Then body segment 1 moves to the old head position.\n> \n> - Body segment 2 moves to the old position of body segment 1.\n> \n> - etc.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Old: head (3,5), B1 (2,5), B2 (1,5) — B2 is tail.\n> \n> Move head to (2,5).\n> \n> New head: (2,5)\n> \n> Then B1 (which was at (2,5)) moves to where? It should move to the old head position, which is (3,5). But (3,5) is now free? After head moves away.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (2,5), then the segment that was B1 is now at (3,5)? No.\n> \n> The segments:\n> \n> - The head is now at (2,5)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (3,5) (which was head) is now the first body segment at (3,5)? But it doesn't move; only the head moves, then each body segment takes the place of the previous one.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard: when the snake moves in a direction, the head is placed in the new cell. Then, each body segment is moved to the position of the previous segment in the chain. So the tail segment is removed from its position.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Current: segment 0: head at (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 1: body at (2,5)\n> \n> Segment 2: tail at (1,5)\n> \n> After moving left to (2,5):\n> \n> - New head at (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (old body) moves to the position of segment 0, which was (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (old tail) moves to the position of segment 1, which was (2,5) but (2,5) is now head, so it moves to (2,5)? Conflict.\n> \n> Positions:\n> \n> - New position for head: (2,5)\n> \n> - New position for segment 1: the old position of segment 0, which is (3,5)\n> \n> - New position for segment 2: the old position of segment 1, which is (2,5)\n> \n> But (2,5) is now occupied by the new head, so segment 2 would move to (2,5), but head is there, so collision.\n> \n> In terms of the list: new snake positions: head at (2,5), then the body segments are: the first body is at old head position (3,5), and the tail is at old first body position (2,5), but (2,5) is the new head, so the tail is at (2,5), same as head, collision.\n> \n> So moving to a body cell causes collision, except for the tail cell under certain conditions.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if you move to the tail position, and the tail moves away, it might be ok.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (1,5). If I move to (2,5), which is not the tail, it's the body, so it should cause collision.\n> \n> But let's see the tail position: tail is at (1,5).\n> \n> If I were to move left to (2,5), that's the body, not tail.\n> \n> To move to tail, I would need to go to (1,5), but from (3,5), moving left would go to (2,5) first, not directly to (1,5).\n> \n> From head (3,5), moving L goes to (2,5), which is body, not tail.\n> \n> Moving to (1,5) is not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are (3,6), (3,4), (4,5), (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is adjacent, and it's body.\n> \n> So moving to (2,5) would cause head to be at same position as the new position of the tail or something?

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So only the tail cell is safe to move into, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, for my snake, tail is at (1,5), so if I could move directly to (1,5), it might be ok, but I can't because it's not adjacent to head? Head at (3,5), adjacent are (3,6), (3,4), (4,5), (2,5). (1,5) is not adjacent, so I can only move to adjacent cells.\n> \n> So from (3,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,6): is this free?

It's turn 9. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,2). Snake positions are: head at (4,5), body at (3,5), tail at (2,5).

Since head direction is R, it just moved to (4,5) from the left, probably from (3,5) but now it's at (4,5), with body behind.\n> \n> Snake positions are listed as head first, so head is (4,5), then (3,5), then (2,5). So the snake is on row y=5, from x=2 to x=4.\n> \n> Head direction is R, so it was moving right to get to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can go Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), or Right (R).

No, when you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place for that turn? I need to recall snake mechanics.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, on the next move, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> But in this case, for Tail Reward Danger: it says if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail collide.\n> \n> But in this state, tail is at (2,5), and there's no food on tail, I think.

        "thinking": "Based on the detailed analysis, the immediate action for the current Turn \\( t_0 = 10 \\) should be to move **Left (L)** to position (3,6). This sets up a path to reach and eat the food at (1,6) by Turn 12, which is critical due to its shorter lifespan (must be eaten by Turn 13). \n\nHere's the reasoning for the immediate action:\n1. **Current Constraints**: \n   - Cannot move Up (wall at (4,7)). \n   - Cannot move Down (reverse of current direction U is forbidden). \n   - Valid options: Left (L) to (3,6) or Right (R) to (5,6).\n\n2. **Prioritizing (1,6)**:\n   - (1,6) has a lifespan of 4 (disappears after Turn 13). Moving Left now allows a sequence: \n     - Turn 10: L to (3,6). \n     - Turn 11: L to (2,6). \n     - Turn 12: L to (1,6) to eat the food. \n   - This secures +1 score before the food expires.\n\n3. **Alternative (Right Path)**:\n   - Moving Right would prioritize (4,4), but (1,6) would be missed entirely, resulting in a net loss of potential score.\n\n4. **Safety**: \n   - Moving Left avoids collisions and keeps the snake maneuverable for future turns (e.g., after eating (1,6), the snake can safely navigate downward).\n\nThus, the optimal immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{L}",

There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2), which I need to avoid.\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (4,6), then (4,5), then (3,5). So the snake is three segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it's moving upwards, so from (4,6) to (4,5) was moving down? Let me clarify the direction.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)]. Head is at (4,6), and it was moving Up to get to (4,6)? Direction is given as U, so current head direction is Up. That means from the previous position, it moved up to (4,6). But the positions show head at (4,6), then body at (4,5), which is directly below, and then (3,5), which is left of that.\n> \n> If head is at (4,6) and moving Up, that means in the next move, if it continues Up, it would go to (4,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that's invalid. y=7 is a border wall, so moving Up to (4,7) is not possible because it's out of bounds.\n> \n> The grid: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y-coordinates from 1 to 6 are playable. Similarly, x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> So head at (4,6), which is y=6, so moving Up (increasing y) would go to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid. Therefore, the snake cannot move Up; it must choose another direction.\n> \n> Available moves: Since head direction is U, but moving U is invalid because (4,7) is wall. Also, no instant reverse, so it cannot move Down directly because that would be opposite to current U direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So current direction is U, so cannot move D on this turn.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but U is invalid (wall), D is forbidden (reverse), so only L or R.\n> \n> L: left to (3,6)\n> \n> R: right to (5,6)\n> \n> Now, check for walls: (3,6) is within bounds? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.

Snake body: positions are (4,5) and (3,5). Head moving to (3,6) or (5,6), neither is (4,5) or (3,5), so no immediate collision. When the snake moves, the tail also moves, so after move, the body shifts.\n> \n> For collision: head cannot touch any body segment except the tail, because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, possible moves: L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1, life span 2 (so disappears after 2 turns, including current?

Borders are x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7, so x=1 is not wall, y=6 not wall, so it should be free, no obstacle mentioned.\n> \n> Internal obstacle is (3,2), not here.\n> \n> So (1,6) is accessible.\n> \n> Another food: (4,4) value 1, life_span 6. Position (4,4).\n> \n> From current (3,6), how to get there? Need to go down and possibly right.\n> \n> Also, (4,2) value 1, life_span 9, at (4,2).\n> \n> (4,2) has internal obstacle at (3,2), so need to be careful.\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n> \n> After I move, the snake will grow only if I eat food; otherwise, it moves, tail moves, so length stays the same if no food eaten.\n> \n> If I eat food, length increases by one.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n> \n> First, for turn 11, I can go D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n> \n> If I go L to (2,6), then head at (2,6), body at (3,6), tail at (4,5)? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> After move, the head moves to new position, body follows: so if head moves to (2,6), then the body segment that was at (4,6) moves to the old head position (3,6)? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> Positions: current: head (3,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (4,5)\n> \n> After move, if I go left to (2,6):\n> \n> - New head: (2,6)\n> \n> - Then seg1 moves to old head position (3,6)\n> \n> - Seg2 moves to old seg1 position (4,6)\n> \n> So new positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] but seg2 was (4,5), now moves to (4,6)? No.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> The body segments follow the head. When head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Head was at (3,6), moves to new position, say (2,6)\n> \n> - Then the first body segment (which was at (4,6)) moves to the position where head was, (3,6)\n> \n> - Then the second body segment (which was at (4,5)) moves to the position where the first body segment was, (4,6)\n> \n> So new positions: head (2,6), body segments: (3,6) and (4,6)\n> \n> But (4,5) is now vacated, since tail moved.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go down to (3,5):\n> \n> - Head to (3,5)\n> \n> - Body seg1 to (3,6)\n> \n> - Body seg2 to (4,6)  // since seg1 was at (4,6)\n> \n> New positions: head (3,5), body (3,6), body (4,6)\n> \n> Now, food at (4,4) is below.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (4,4), which is directly below (4,5) or something.\n> \n> I need to think about paths and risks.\n> \n> Moreover, there's a danger with tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and collides.\n> \n> But in this case, let's see where the tail is.\n> \n> Current tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> After moves, tail changes.\n> \n> For example, if I move down to (3,5), new tail is at (4,6)? From above: after down move, positions: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6) so tail at (4,6)\n> \n> If I move left to (2,6), positions: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) tail at (4,6)\n> \n> In both cases, after move, tail is at (4,6)\n> \n> Now, is there food at (4,6)? No, food positions are (6,5), (1,6), (4,4), (4,2). (4,6) is not listed, so no food there.\n> \n> Now, let's plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, food (1,6) is close, at (1,6), which I can reach in two moves: from (3,6) to (2,6) then to (1,6).\n> \n> But if I go to (1,6) on turn 12, say.\n> \n> Turn 11: I need to choose action.\n> \n> If I go left to (2,6) on turn 11, then on turn 12 I can go left to (1,6) to eat the food there.\n> \n> But life_span of (1,6) is 3, meaning at turn 11 it has life_span 3, so it can be eaten on turn 11,12,13.\n> \n> If I eat on turn 12, that's fine.\n> \n> But when I eat, snake grows, so after eating, length increases.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid collisions.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move for that turn, I think? When you eat food, the tail stays in place, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, so the head is on food, and the tail does not move that turn, so a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail didn't move, it stays, and the segment before it becomes the new tail? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically: when snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, consumes it, and instead of the tail moving, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail remains, and the snake grows by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, positions [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n> \n> Head moves to new position, which has food. Then, the body segments move as usual: seg1 to old head, seg2 to old seg1, etc., but the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the old tail position, so the tail stays, and there's a new segment after it? No.\n> \n> Better to think: after head moves to food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; the new positions are [new head, old head, old seg1, ..., old tail] and since tail didn't move, it's still there, but the new segment is added, so length increases by one.\n> \n> For example, current: [H, S1, S2] with S2 tail.\n> \n> Head moves to food at F, so new head at F, then S1 moves to old H position, S2 does not move, and a new segment is added at S2 position? But S2 is still there.\n> \n> Standard: when eating, the head moves to food, the body moves as usual, but the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, and since head moved, it's like adding a segment before the tail or something.\n> \n> Positions: before move: [H, S1, S2] with S2 tail.\n> \n> After move with eating: head moves to F (food), so new head: F\n> \n> S1 moves to old H position\n> \n> S2 does not move; it stays as tail? But S2 was tail, now it's not moving, so it becomes part of the body, and a new tail segment is added? I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> I recall the rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> In movement, when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and that turn, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, body segments move to their next positions, but since tail doesn't move, the position that was tail remains occupied, and the tail segment stays there, but now there is an additional segment.\n> \n> For example: before move: positions: H, S1, S2 (tail)\n> \n> Head moves to F (food)\n> \n> Then S1 moves to H (old head position)\n> \n> S2 does not move; it stays at its position.\n> \n> But now, S2 is still the tail, and since it didn't move, the snake has grown: new positions [F, H, S1, S2] but S1 moved to old H, so it's [F, old H, S1, S2] and S2 is tail.\n> \n> Since S2 didn't move, it's still there, and the segment that was S1 is now at old H, which was the head position.\n> \n> Let's label positions.\n> \n> Suppose at time t, positions: H at (3,6), S1 at (4,6), S2 at (4,5) tail.\n> \n> Move head to (2,6), which has no food, so no eat: new positions: head at (2,6), S1 moves to (3,6), S2 moves to (4,6), so tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Now, if head moves to a cell with food, say to (1,6) which has food.\n> \n> Then: head moves to (1,6), eats food.\n> \n> S1 moves to old head position (2,6)\n> \n> S2 moves to old S1 position (3,6)  // but since we ate, tail should not move? No.\n> \n> When eating, tail does not move; only head and body up to the neck move.\n> \n> General rule: when no eat, all segments move: head to new, each body to previous segment position.\n> \n> When eat, head to new (food), each body segment moves to previous position, but the tail segment does not move, so it stays, and the snake gains a segment at the tail position, meaning the tail remains where it is for that turn, so the length increases.\n> \n> After the move, the tail is still at the same position, and there is an additional body segment.\n> \n> In the sequence: before move: [H, S1, S2] with S2 tail.\n> \n> After move with eat: head to F, S1 to H, S2 does not move, so new positions: [F, H, S1] and S2 is still there, so [F, H, S1, S2] with S2 still tail? But S1 is now at old H, and S2 is at its position.\n> \n> S2 was tail, now it's not the last; since S2 didn't move, it becomes the second last, and a new tail is S2, but it's the same segment.\n> \n> Positions: new head at F.\n> \n> Then the first body segment is at old H position.\n> \n> The second body segment is at old S1 position? Let's think of indices.\n> \n> Positions list: index 0: head, 1: body1, 2: body2, ..., n-1: tail.\n> \n> After move without eat: new head at new pos, new body1 at old head pos, new body2 at old body1 pos, ..., new tail at old body_k pos for some k.\n> \n> With eat: new head at food, new body1 at old head, new body2 at old body1, ..., and new body at old tail position, so the tail is extended, meaning the old tail position is now a body segment, and the new tail is the old tail, but since it didn't move, it's the same, but a new segment is added at the end? I think I have it.\n> \n> Standard: when eating, the head moves to the food, the body segments move as in no-eat case, but the tail does not advance; instead, the tail stays in place, so the segment that was tail remains, and since the head moved, the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> For example, before: [H, S1, S2] with S2 tail.\n> \n> After eating: head to F, S1 to old H, S2 stays, so new positions: [F, old H, S1, S2] with S2 tail.\n> \n> S2 is still the tail, at the same position.\n> \n> So the positions are F, old H, S1, S2.\n> \n> S1 is at its old position only if it didn't move, but S1 moved to old H, so S1 is now at old H position, S2 is at old S1 position? No.\n> \n> In the sequence, S2 was at position P, and it stays at P, while S1 moves to old H.\n> \n> So the new list is: new head at F, new body1 at old H (which was head), new body2 at S1's old position? Let's use coordinates.\n> \n> Before: H: (3,6), S1: (4,6), S2: (4,5)\n> \n> Head moves to F at (1,6), say.\n> \n> Then S1 moves to old H (3,6)\n> \n> S2 does not move; it stays at (4,5)\n> \n> But S2 was tail, now it's still tail at (4,5), and the new positions are head (1,6), body1 (3,6), body2 (4,6)? Body2 should be S1's position, but S1 moved to (3,6), so the position (4,6) is now empty? No.\n> \n> After S1 moves to (3,6), the position (4,6) is vacated, and S2 stays at (4,5), so the new body segments are at (3,6) and (4,5)? But (4,6) is not occupied.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Correct: the body segments move one step towards the head.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So for body1, it moves to where head was.\n> \n> For body2, it moves to where body1 was.\n> \n> In this case, body1 at (4,6) moves to head's old position (3,6)\n> \n> Body2 at (4,5) moves to body1's old position (4,6)\n> \n> So new body1 at (3,6), new body2 at (4,6)\n> \n> Then head at (1,6)\n> \n> So positions: head (1,6), body1 (3,6), body2 (4,6)\n> \n> But body2 is tail at (4,6)\n> \n> When eating, tail does not move; so body2 does not move; it stays at (4,5), and no segment moves to (4,6).\n> \n> So after eating: head at (1,6), body1 moves to old head (3,6), body2 (tail) does not move, so it stays at (4,5), and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail didn't move, it's like the tail is duplicated or something.\n> \n> I think the common way is: when eating, the tail remains in place, so the position that the tail was going to move to is not vacated; instead, the tail stays, and the head and body move, so the snake grows.\n> \n> So in positions: new head at F, new body1 at old head, new body2 at old body1, ..., and the last segment (tail) stays, so it is now part of the body, and the new tail is the same as old, but since it didn't move, the segment is still there.\n> \n> For example: before move: segments: 0: (3,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (4,5)\n> \n> Head moves to (1,6) with eat.\n> \n> Then, segment 1 moves to segment 0's old position (3,6)\n> \n> Segment 2 (tail) does not move; it stays at (4,5)\n> \n> And a new segment is added at the old tail position, but since tail didn't move, it's at (4,5), so now we have segments: 0: (1,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (4,5), and 3: (4,5)? That can't be, two segments at same position.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Upon second thought, in many implementations, when the snake eats, the head moves to the food, the body segments move as usual, but the tail does not advance, so the last position is not vacated, and the snake length increases by one.\n> \n> So the new positions are: head at new position, then the old head position, then the old position of body1, etc., up to the old tail position, which is still occupied.\n> \n> In the list, the new segment list has the new head, then the old head, then the old body1, then the old body2, ..., then the old tail.\n> \n> For our case: old positions: 0: (3,6) head, 1: (4,6) body1, 2: (4,5) tail\n> \n> After moving head to (1,6) with eat:\n> \n> New head: (1,6)\n> \n> New body1: old head position (3,6)\n> \n> New body2: old body1 position (4,6)\n> \n> New body3: old tail position (4,5)  // since tail didn't move, we add a new segment at old tail position\n> \n> So new positions: [(1,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5)] with tail at (4,5)\n> \n> The tail is now at (4,5), but it was at (4,5) before, and we have an additional segment at (4,6).\n> \n> In this case, from three segments, after eating, we have four segments: head at (1,6), body at (3,6), body at (4,6), tail at (4,5).\n> \n> The cell (4,6) is now occupied, which was body1's position.\n> \n> Similarly, the tail is at (4,5), same as before.\n> \n> So the snake grew by one, with the new segment added at the tail end, but since tail didn't move, it's at the same position.\n> \n> I think that's the way.\n> \n> For this problem, I'll assume that when eating, the tail does not move, so the position is not vacated, and a new segment is added at the tail position, extending the snake.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, the tail position is still occupied, so moving there might cause collision if not careful.\n> \n> Back to the decision.\n> \n> For turn 11, I can move to (2,6) or (3,5).\n> \n> If I move to (2,6), I can then move to (1,6) on turn 12 to eat the food there.\n> \n> (1,6) has food with life_span 3, so at turn 11, life_span 3, after turn 11 it becomes 2, so it can be eaten on turn 12.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move down to (3,5), I can go towards (4,4) or other food.\n> \n> But (4,4) has life_span 6, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Also, (4,2) with life_span 9.\n> \n> Now, the food at (6,5) is gone after this turn, so ignore.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about risks.\n> \n> Also, the internal obstacle at (3,2), so I need to avoid that.\n> \n> Moreover, the tail danger: if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But in this case, no food on tail cells yet.\n> \n> Current tail at (4,5), no food there.\n> \n> After moves, tail may change.\n> \n> Let's plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, option 1: move left to (2,6) on turn 11.\n> \n> Then on turn 12, move left to (1,6) to eat the food.\n> \n> After that, snake grows.\n> \n> Then I need to think where to go next.\n> \n> After eating at (1,6), positions as above, but let's simulate.\n> \n> Turn 11: move L to (2,6)\n> \n> No food at (2,6), so no eat.\n> \n> New positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), body (4,6)  // since tail moved to (4,6)\n> \n> Old tail was at (4,5), moved to (4,6)\n> \n> Positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> Tail at (4,6)\n> \n> Now, head at (2,6), direction L?

two foods: (1,6) and (4,4), but it takes more turns and I might be in a tighter spot after.\n> \n> In option 2, I eat (4,4) and (4,2), missing (1,6), but I eat sooner and have a shorter path to

It's turn 12. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, but there's also an internal obstacle at (3,2). So (3,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), then (3,6), then (4,6). So the snake has three segments. Head is at (3,5), body at (3,6), tail at (4,6). Head direction is down, which is decreasing y, so moving towards lower y.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 3.

No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,5), direction down. So if I continue down, next position would be (3,4), since down decreases y.\n> \n> But I have to consider the movement constraints. I cannot instantly reverse. Since current direction is down, I cannot move up on the next turn.

Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for x, 1 to 6 are free; for y, 1 to 6 are free. But (3,2) is an internal obstacle, so blocked.\n> \n> So (3,4): x=3, y=4, not a border, not (3,2), so should be free.\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions are [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6)]. If I move down to (3,4), that cell is not occupied by body currently. Body is at (3,6) and (4,6), so (3,4) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, left to (2,5): should be free, no wall or body.\n> \n> Right to (4,5): should be free.\n> \n> But I need to think about future turns.\n> \n> Also, food: (1,6) is at (1,6), which is the body position? Snake body has (3,6), but (1,6) is different. Food at (1,6), (4,4), (4,2).\n> \n> (4,4) is near, and (4,2) is below, but (4,2) has an obstacle? (3,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) should be free unless wall. Walls are only borders and (3,2), so (4,2) is free.\n> \n> Now, life spans: food at (1,6) has life span 3, so it will disappear after 3 turns from now, meaning if not eaten by turn 14 (since turn 12 current, life span decreases each turn including current, so after turn 12, life span 2 left; after turn 13, life span 1; after turn 14, gone. So must be eaten by turn 14 to get it.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) life span 5, so disappears after turn 17, must eat by turn 16? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 12: current, life span decreases to 2 for (1,6), 4 for (4,4), 7 for (4,2)? No.\n> \n> Life span is given as the number of turns it will last, including the current turn.\n> \n> For (1,6): life_span=3, so after this turn (turn 12), it has 2 turns left; after turn 13, 1 turn left; after turn 14, gone. So it can be eaten on turn 12, 13, or 14.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (4,4) life_span=5, so can be eaten up to turn 16.\n> \n> (4,2) life_span=8, up to turn 19.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,5), direction down.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for several turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves and evaluate risks.\n> \n> If I move down to (3,4):\n> \n> - Position: (3,4)\n> \n> - Then from there, possible moves: since I moved down, direction is down, so I can go down to (3,3), left to (2,4), right to (4,4), not up.\n> \n> (4,4) has food, which is positive.\n> \n> But I need to see if it's safe.\n> \n> If I move to (3,4), the tail is at (4,6), and it will move. When I move, the snake moves: head to new position, and tail moves forward, so the segment at (4,6) will be the new tail or something? Let's think about snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new cell, and tail leaves its cell, so the body follows.\n> \n> Currently, positions: head (3,5), body (3,6), tail (4,6).\n> \n> If I move down to (3,4), new head is (3,4), then the body: the segment that was at (3,5) becomes the new body segment, and (3,6) becomes the next, and (4,6) is the tail. Since I'm moving down, and not eating food, length doesn't increase, so tail moves away.\n> \n> After move: head at (3,4), then body: (3,5), (3,6), but (3,6) was body, now it's still there, but the tail was (4,6), and since no food eaten, tail is removed? Standard snake: when no food, head moves to new cell, tail is removed from the end.\n> \n> So positions: after moving down without eating:\n> \n> - New head: (3,4)\n> \n> - Body: the previous head (3,5) becomes part of body, so snake positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)]? But (3,6) was already body, and tail (4,6) is removed.\n> \n> Let's sequence:\n> \n> - Before move: segments: index 0: head (3,5), index 1: body (3,6), index 2: tail (4,6)\n> \n> - Move down to (3,4): new head (3,4)\n> \n> - Since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the last segment (4,6) is removed.\n> \n> - The body segments shift: (3,5) becomes the first body segment, (3,6) becomes the second, but since tail removed, now the snake has head (3,4), body (3,5), and (3,6) is the new tail? Positions: head at (3,4), then the previous positions except tail: so (3,4) is head, (3,5) is body, (3,6) is tail? But (3,6) was body before, now it's tail.\n> \n> After move, snake positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)] because the tail (4,6) is gone, and (3,6) is now the tail.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> If I had eaten food, length increases, tail stays.\n> \n> But in this case, moving to (3,4), no food there, so snake becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)]\n> \n> Now, from (3,4), I can move down to (3,3), left to (2,4), right to (4,4).\n> \n> (4,4) has food, so if I move right to (4,4), I eat the food, length increases to 4.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead.\n> \n> First, back to turn 12.\n> \n> Options for turn 12:\n> \n> - D to (3,4)\n> \n> - L to (2,5)\n> \n> - R to (4,5)\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate each.\n> \n> First, moving D to (3,4):\n> \n> - As above, new positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), tail (3,6)\n> \n> - Then turn 13: from (3,4), direction is down (since I moved down), so can move D, L, R.\n> \n> - If move D to (3,3): (3,3) is free?

It's turn 13. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then (3,5), and tail at (3,6). So the snake has three segments.

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 13, life span 2 means it has 2 turns left, including turn 13. So after turn 13, it has 1 turn left, and after turn 14, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 13 or 14.\n> \n> Life span: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten until turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 on the next turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten as long as life span > 0.\n> \n> At turn 13, life span 2: after turn 13, it becomes 1; after turn 14, it becomes 0 and disappears.

No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,5), direction right. So possible moves: since direction is right, I can go right, up, or down, but not left because that would be instant reverse. Rules: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left on this turn.\n> \n> Possible actions from (4,5):\n> \n> - Up: to (4,6)\n> \n> - Down: to (4,4)\n> \n> - Right: to (5,5)\n> \n> - Left: not allowed, since opposite to current direction R.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, and I'm choosing the next move.

Head is at (4,5), so (4,4) is down one cell.\n> \n> - (4,2) down from there, but there's an obstacle at (3,2), so (4,2) might be accessible? (4,2) is at x=4,y=2, obstacle is (3,2), which is different cell.\n> \n> - (6,1) bottom-right.\n> \n> Since life span is short for (1,6), only 2 turns left, I might consider going for it if possible, but it's at (1,6), which is far from (4,5).\n> \n> Distance: from (4,5) to (1,6): delta x = -3, delta y = +1, so Manhattan distance 4, but with obstacles and snake body, might take more turns.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) is adjacent down, so I can go down to (4,4) directly this turn.\n> \n> (4,4) has food with value 1, life 4, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But if I go down to (4,4), I eat it, snake grows to length 4, so new tail will be added, but positions: if I move down to (4,4), head to (4,4), then body segments: the current head (4,5) becomes body, then (3,5), then (3,6) is tail. After eating, snake grows, so new positions: head at (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,6). Tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> But (3,6) is where the tail is, but since we ate, a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move immediately? When you eat, the tail stays in place for that turn, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Movement: when you move, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and if you eat food, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move, effectively growing.\n> \n> If you don't eat, tail moves forward, so no growth.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,4), which has food, I eat it, so snake grows: new head at (4,4), then the previous head (4,5) becomes first body, then (3,5) becomes second body, and (3,6) is still tail, but since we ate, a new segment is added, so the tail extends, meaning (3,6) stays, and the segment that was at (3,6) is now part of the body, with a new segment at (3,6)? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats, so the head moves to that cell, the body follows, but the tail doesn't move, so the snake increases in length by one.

Tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> If I move U to (4,5), that's where the second segment is, so head would collide with body, die.\n> \n> Similarly, D: (4,3) — is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6)\n> \n> So (4,3) is empty? And not wall? y=3, between 0 and 7, x=4, not 0 or 7, and not (3,2) obstacle, so (4,3) should be free.\n> \n> L: (3,4) — is this occupied? Snake has (3,5) and (3,6), but (3,4) is below? y=4, x=3.

(3,5) is at x=3,y=5, head at (4,4), so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing side, so (4,4) and (3,5) are diagonal? No, in grid, adjacent is horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.\n> \n> So adjacent cells: north (4,5), south (4,3), west (3,4), east (5,4).\n> \n> (4,5) occupied, others free.\n> \n> Now, if I move, the snake will grow only if I eat food, which I'm not doing this turn probably.\n> \n> First, for turn 14, I need to choose action.\n> \n> Possible actions: D, L, or R.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,3): new head position (4,3), then body: the segment that was at (4,4) moves to where head was? When snake moves, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So after move D: head to (4,3), then (4,4) becomes body, (4,5) moves to (4,4), (3,5) moves to (4,5)?

Segment 2 was (3,5), moves to (4,5), which was previous segment 1 position. Previous segment 1 position is (4,5), so segment 2 moves to (4,5).

Positions: head (4,3), then body: (4,4), (4,5), and tail (3,5). But (3,5) is the last.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (3,4): head to (3,4), then body: segment 1 to (4,4), segment 2 to (4,5), tail to (3,5).

Then turn 15: from (4,3), I can move D to (4,2).\n> \n> On turn 15, head at (4,3), direction is D (since I moved D on turn 14).\n> \n> Then I can move D to (4,2), which is free? Currently, (4,2) is not occupied, and not wall, except the obstacle is at (3,2), not (4,2), so (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> When I move to (4,2), I eat the food, so snake grows: head moves to (4,2), then the body segments follow, but since I ate food, a new segment is added where the tail was, or how?\n> \n> When snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move that turn, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Specifically: head moves to new position, if it eats food, the tail stays, so a new segment is added at the tail position. The body segments move as usual.\n> \n> So after eating, the snake length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if on turn 15 I move to (4,2) and eat, then:\n> \n> Before move: positions at start of turn 15: let's say after turn 14, I moved D, so positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n> \n> Then on turn 15, move D to (4,2): head to (4,2), which has food, so eat it. Then, the body: segment 1 moves to previous head position (4,3), segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (4,4), tail moves to previous segment 2 position (4,5), and since ate food, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (3,5), so now tail is at (3,5), and new segment before that? Let's list.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,2), then body: (4,3) [previous head], (4,4) [previous segment 1], (4,5) [previous segment 2], and tail (3,5) [previous tail, but since ate, it stays? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, the tail does not move, so the segments are: new head at food, then the previous head position becomes first body, and so on, but the last segment (tail) doesn't advance, so it grows.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (4,2), then the previous positions of the body except the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> After move: head at (4,2), then the segment that was head is now first body at (4,3), then next body at (4,4), then next at (4,5), and the tail was at (3,5), but since ate, tail stays at (3,5), so now we have an additional segment at (3,5), and the new tail is still at (3,5)? No.\n> \n> The body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was, which is (4,3). Second body segment moves to where first body was, which is (4,4). Third body segment moves to where second body was, which is (4,5). But the tail, instead of moving, stays because food eaten, so a new segment is added at the current tail position.\n> \n> So snake becomes: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and tail (3,5) — the tail didn't move, so it's still (3,5), and since we add a segment, it's now part of body, and tail is (3,5), but (3,5) was already there, now it's the new tail? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Better: before move, positions: index 0: head (4,3), 1: body (4,4), 2: body (4,5), 3: tail (3,5)\n> \n> After move: head moves to (4,2) and eats food. Then, segment 1 moves to previous head position (4,3). Segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (4,4). Now, for the tail, since food eaten, it does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the current tail position (3,5), so the tail remains (3,5), and the new segment is added, so now the snake has segments: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and (3,5).

It's turn 15. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,2). So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (3,2) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then body segments at (4,4), (4,5), and tail at (3,5).

I should prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. Assume coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls on borders, so accessible cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), tail (3,5). So, the snake is in a vertical line from (4,3) to (4,5), then left to (3,5).\n> \n> Head direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (4,3). So, previous position was probably (4,2) or something, but (4,2) has food, but we'll see.\n> \n> Since head direction is D, and it's at (4,3), it must have come from above, like (4,2), but (4,2) has food, but the snake didn't eat it because if it was on (4,2), it would have eaten when it moved there, but according to positions, head is at (4,3), so it didn't come from (4,2) necessarily. Let's think.\n> \n> The positions are given as [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)], with head first. Head direction D means the snake was moving downward to reach (4,3). So, before this turn, the head was at (4,2), I assume, but (4,2) has food, and if the head moved to (4,2) on a previous turn, it should have eaten it, but food is still there, so perhaps the food spawned under the snake or something.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) has life span 6, turn 15, so it appeared recently or has been there. But snake positions: head at (4,3), which is above (4,2)? y=3 is above y=2 if y increases upwards? Typically in grids, y=0 is top, y increasing down, or y=0 bottom? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So, if U increases y, that means y=0 is bottom, y increases upwards? Let's see:\n> \n> U: (x,y) to (x,y+1) — if y+1 is up, then y=0 is bottom, y increases upwards. But in standard grid, often y=0 is top, but here U is (x,y+1), which might be down if y=0 top. I think I need to define the orientation.\n> \n> Typically in such games, (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward, x increases right.\n> \n> But here, U is (x,y+1) — if y increases down, then y+1 is down, so U would be down? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Let's read: \"U`(x,y+1)`\" — it says U (x,y+1), so if we assume (x,y) with y increasing upwards, then U to (x,y+1) is up. Similarly, D to (x,y-1) is down.\n> \n> In many grid systems, y=0 is bottom and increases up, but in programming, often y=0 is top and increases down. To avoid confusion, I should think in terms of the actions.\n> \n> From the snake positions: head at (4,3), body at (4,4), (4,5). If head is at (4,3) and body at (4,4), that means the body is below the head if y increases down, or above if y increases up.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down. So, if D is (x,y-1), that means moving to lower y, so if y increases down, D is down to higher y? I'm getting confused.\n> \n> Let's define: let's assume the standard coordinate system where (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward, x increases right. So:\n> \n> - U: up, to (x, y-1) because y decreases when going up.\n> \n> - D: down, to (x, y+1) because y increases when going down.\n> \n> - L: left, to (x-1, y)\n> \n> - R: right, to (x+1, y)\n> \n> But in the problem, it says U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`, which suggests that y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y increases upward.\n> \n> I think there's inconsistency in common practices. To resolve, let's look at the food positions.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) and (6,1). Snake at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). With head at (4,3).\n> \n> If head direction is D, and D is (x,y-1), so moving to (x,y-1) is down. So if the head is at (4,3) and moving D, it came from (4,4)? No.\n> \n> If it moved D to (4,3), that means from a higher y to lower y, so if y increases down, moving to lower y is up, but D is down? I'm messing this up.\n> \n> Let's read the action definitions carefully:\n> \n> \"U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`, L`(x-1,y)`, R`(x+1,y)`\"\n> \n> And \"Snake Head Direction: D\" for current state.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), with direction D.\n> \n> Direction is the direction it is facing or the direction it last moved? It says \"Snake Head Direction\", and in context, it's the current direction of movement.\n> \n> Typically, the head direction indicates the direction it moved to reach the current position.\n> \n> So, if head is at (4,3) and direction D, that means it moved down to (4,3). Moving down to (4,3) means it came from (4,4), because D is (x,y-1), so from (x, y+1) to (x,y) or something.\n> \n> Let's think: if at turn t, head is at position P with direction D, it means that on turn t, the head moved to P by moving in direction D.\n> \n> For example, at turn t-1, head was at some cell, and on turn t, it moved D to current position.\n> \n> But in the positions list, the positions are for the current turn, so head at (4,3) with direction D, so on turn 15, it is at (4,3) after moving D.\n> \n> Therefore, on turn 14, head was at (4,4), and it moved D to (4,3).\n> \n> Similarly, the body: from positions, after head moved to (4,3), the body segments follow: (4,4) was the previous head, now body, then (4,5) was body, now still body, and (3,5) tail.\n> \n> Tail at (3,5), which was probably from previous movement.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,2): (4,2) is at same x, y=2. If y increases down, then (4,2) is above (4,3) since y=2 < y=3.\n> \n> If y increases down, smaller y is up, larger y is down.\n> \n> So (4,2) has y=2, (4,3) has y=3, so (4,2) is above (4,3).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) is at x=6,y=1.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so accessible x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so (3,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) and (6,1).\n> \n> (4,2) has food with life span 6, so it will disappear on turn 21.\n> \n> (6,1) has life span 8, disappear on turn 23.\n> \n> Both positive, value 1.\n> \n> Now, current head at (4,3), direction D, so it can move to adjacent cells, but cannot move opposite direction instantly, so since it just moved D (down), it cannot move U (up) on next turn, because U is opposite of D.\n> \n> Actions: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> Opposite of D is U, so it cannot move U next.\n> \n> It can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - D: to (4,4) — but (4,4) is occupied by the body, so moving there would cause collision, death.\n> \n> - L: to (3,3) — what is at (3,3)? No walls, no obstacle mentioned, so should be free. Walls are only borders and (3,2), so (3,3) should be accessible.\n> \n> - R: to (5,3) — similarly, should be free.\n> \n> - U: to (4,2) — but (4,2) has food, and U is opposite to current direction D, so cannot move U because of no instant reverse rule.\n> \n> So, from current position (4,3), with head direction D, possible actions are L, R, or D, but D to (4,4) is body, so collision, impossible. So only possible moves are L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,2) blocked.\n> \n> Cells:\n> \n> y=1: (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1) — (6,1) has food\n> \n> y=2: (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) blocked (4,2) food (5,2) (6,2)\n> \n> y=3: (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) head (5,3) (6,3)\n> \n> y=4: (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) body (5,4) (6,4)\n> \n> y=5: (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) tail (4,5) body (5,5) (6,5)\n> \n> y=6: (1,6) (2,6) (3,6) (4,6) (5,6) (6,6)\n> \n> Snake: head (4,3), body segments: (4,4), (4,5), tail (3,5).

No, (4,2) is a cell, and snake is at (4,3), (4,4), etc., so (4,2) is not occupied by snake; it has food, but snake is not on it currently.\n> \n> In the positions, (4,2) is not listed, so it's free but with food.\n> \n> But to eat it, we need to move head to (4,2).\n> \n> But currently, from (4,3), moving U to (4,2) is possible in terms of direction?

Also, since the snake will move, when the head moves, the body follows, so moving to (4,3) would collide with the body segment that is currently there but will move away? I need to think carefully about movement.\n> \n> Movement rules: When the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So, if the head moves to a new position, the segment that was at (4,3) will move to where the head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: The head moves to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the segment ahead of it.

No.\n> \n> The positions shift: the segment that was behind the head moves to the head's old position, and so on.\n> \n> After one move:\n> - New head position: depends on direction\n> - New position for segment 1: old head position\n> - New position for segment 2: old position of segment 1\n> - New position for segment 3: old position of segment 2\n> \n> So tail moves away.\n> \n> For collision: The head cannot move to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, except for the tail cell, because the tail will move.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when considering a move to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment other than the tail, it's a collision. If it's the tail, and the tail moves, it might be safe, but only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to the current tail position, since the tail moves, that cell becomes free, so no collision. But if head moves to a body segment that is not the tail, that segment might still be there or move, but generally, the head should not move to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,4) - is this occupied? Current positions: (5,3) head, (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (5,4) is empty? Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Occupied cells: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n> \n> So (5,4) is free? y=4, x=5. (4,4) is at x=4,y=4, so (5,4) should be free unless there's food or something, but cells: (5,4) not listed as occupied, so it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) is down, which is free.\n> \n> (4,3) is occupied by body segment, not tail.

Not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> But walls: x=7 is wall, so (6,3) is within bounds, x=6<7, y=3 between 0 and 7.\n> \n> Similarly, left to (4,3): but (4,3) is occupied by body, so moving left to (4,3) would collide, since it's a body segment and not the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5), so only (4,5) is safe to move to, but (4,5) is not adjacent directly? From (5,3), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (5,4)\n> \n> - Down: (5,2)\n> \n> - Left: (4,3) — occupied, not tail, collision\n> \n> - Right: (6,3)\n> \n> (4,3) is left, but occupied.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since head direction is R (right), moving left would be opposite, so not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is R, so opposite is L (left), so cannot move left on this turn.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,4)\n> \n> - D: (5,2)\n> \n> - R: (6,3)\n> \n> Cannot move L because it's reverse and also occupied.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (4,2): positive, life_span 5, so it will disappear after 5 turns, including current? Life_span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 16, life_span=5, so it will be gone by turn 21? Let's see.\n> \n> Life_span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (4,2) with life_span 5 on turn 16: on turn 17, life_span=4; turn 18, life_span=3; ... turn 20, life_span=1; turn 21, life_span=0, disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 16 to 20.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life_span=7: from turn 16 to 22.\n> \n> (4,3) life_span=10: turn 16 to 25, but it's under the snake body.\n> \n> (4,3) is occupied by the snake body, so it can't be eaten now. Only if the snake moves away and then back.\n> \n> But (4,3) is the first body segment. When the snake moves, that segment will move to the head's position.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan moves for at least 5 turns: turns 16,17,18,19,20.\n> \n> Turn 16 is the current turn.\n> \n> I should consider the goal: eat positive food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Food available: (4,2), (6,1), and (4,3) which is under body.\n> \n> (4,2) is down from current position? From head (5,3), down is (5,2), but (4,2) is at x=4,y=2, which is left and down.\n> \n> (4,2) is adjacent to (4,3) or (5,2), but from (5,3), moving down to (5,2) gets closer to (4,2), since (5,2) to (4,2) is left, or (5,2) to (4,2) is adjacent? (5,2) and (4,2) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) is at x=6,y=1, which is down and right from (5,3).\n> \n> (5,3) to (6,1) is not adjacent; need to move.\n> \n> Also, the food at (4,3) is under body. To eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (4,3), and then the head moves to (4,3) when it's free.\n> \n> But (4,3) is currently occupied, so when the snake moves, if head moves away, the body will shift.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to (6,3) on turn 16, then:\n> \n> - New head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Body: (5,3) [old head], (4,3) [moves to old segment1 position? Let's see positions after move.\n> \n> Turn 16, move head.\n> \n> After move, the positions:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> - Segment 1 moves to old head position (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old segment1 position (4,3)? No.\n> \n> Current positions: head (5,3), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5)\n> \n> If head moves to (6,3) (right):\n> \n> - New head: (6,3)\n> \n> - New seg1: old head position (5,3)\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 position (4,3)\n> \n> - New seg3: old seg2 position (4,4)\n> \n> - Tail was seg3, moved to (4,4), so (4,5) is now free.\n> \n> So the cell (4,3) is now occupied by seg2? New seg2 is at (4,3), which was old seg1 position, but old seg1 was at (4,3), and it moved to (5,3), so (4,3) is now free? No.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head to (6,3)\n> \n> - seg1 to (5,3)  // old head\n> \n> - seg2 to (4,3)  // old seg1 position? seg2 was at (4,4), and it moves to where seg1 was, which is (4,3)\n> \n> - seg3 to (4,4)  // old seg2 position (4,4), so seg3 moves to (4,4)\n> \n> Old seg3 was at (4,5), which is now empty.\n> \n> So the food at (4,3) is still under the snake? New seg2 is at (4,3), so (4,3) is occupied by seg2 now. It was seg1 before, now seg2, so still occupied. Not free.\n> \n> To free (4,3), the snake needs to move so that no segment is on (4,3). Since it's a body segment, it will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> For example, if the head keeps moving right or something, the body will shift, but (4,3) might be occupied by different segments.\n> \n> The position (4,3) will be free only when the tail has passed it, meaning that the segment that was on (4,3) has moved away and no other segment is there.\n> \n> In this case, since the snake has multiple segments, when the tail moves off (4,5), but (4,3) is closer to head.\n> \n> After the move above, (4,3) is occupied by seg2.\n> \n> If the head moves again, say to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so cannot.\n> \n> x=6 is the last before wall, x=7 wall.\n> \n> So from (6,3), possible moves.\n> \n> But let's think about freeing (4,3).\n> \n> The segment currently at (4,3) is seg1. When the head moves, seg1 moves to old head position, so (4,3) is left empty if no other segment moves there, but seg2 moves to (4,3) in the example above, so it's still occupied.\n> \n> The only way to free a body-occupied cell is if the snake moves such that the segment on that cell moves away and no new segment comes to it, which happens when the tail moves off and the snake doesn't loop back.\n> \n> But (4,3) is not the tail; tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> To free (4,3), we need the snake to move so that the segment on (4,3) moves and the next segment doesn't come to (4,3), but since the segments follow, when seg1 moves to (5,3), seg2 moves to where seg1 was, which is (4,3), so it remains occupied by the next segment. Only when the tail is on that cell and moves off, it becomes free.\n> \n> For example, the tail is at (4,5). If the snake moves down or something, the tail will move.\n> \n> But (4,3) is not the tail; it's a middle segment.\n> \n> So for a body cell that is not the tail, it will always be occupied by some segment when the snake moves, until the tail passes that point.\n> \n> In this case, the segment at (4,3) will move to (5,3) when head moves, but then seg2 moves to (4,3), so (4,3) is continuously occupied until the tail is at that position and moves off.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,5). When the snake moves, the tail moves to old seg2 position, which is (4,4) in the first move.\n> \n> Then, if the head moves again, the tail will move to (4,3) or something.\n> \n> Let's simulate:\n> \n> Start: positions: H(5,3), S1(4,3), S2(4,4), S3(4,5)\n> \n> After move right: H(6,3), S1(5,3), S2(4,3), S3(4,4)  // S3 moved to (4,4), so (4,5) free, but (4,3) now occupied by S2.\n> \n> If head moves right again to (7,3) but x=7 wall, so cannot. x=6 is max for x, since x=7 wall. x=6,y=3, to right x=7 is wall, so cannot move right.\n> \n> From (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied by S1, so if move left to (5,3), it is occupied, and S1 is not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Current direction after move is R, so no instant reverse to L?

I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's clarify:\n> \n> - When no food eaten: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail moves off its cell.\n> \n> - When food eaten: head moves to food cell, body segments move as usual, but tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail cell remains occupied, and snake length increases.\n> \n> Case: food on tail cell P.\n> \n> - Before move: tail at P with food.\n> \n> - Head moves to P to eat food.\n> \n> - Since food eaten, after move: head is at P, the old tail segment is still at P (because tail doesn't move when eating), and a new segment is added at P (the new tail).\n> \n> So now P has three segments: head, old tail, new tail? No.\n> \n> Positions:\n> \n> Suppose before move: segments: ..., S_{n-1}, S_n (tail at P with food)\n> \n> Head at H, adjacent or not.\n> \n> Head moves to P.\n> \n> Since food eaten, the movement: head moves to P.\n> \n> Then, the body: S1 moves to old head position, S2 to old S1, ..., S_{n-1} to old S_{n-2} position, S_n (tail) does not move, and a new segment S_{n+1} is added at the old tail position, which is P.\n> \n> But S_n is at P, and new segment S_{n+1} is also added at P, and head is at P, so P has head, S_n, and S_{n+1}, all on same cell, instant collision.\n> \n> Yes, so it's always fatal to eat food on the tail cell, because it causes multiple segments on the same cell.\n> \n> The rule says: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" But it's not just the head and new tail; the old tail is also there.\n> \n> So in practice, eating food on the tail position is always deadly and should be avoided.\n> \n> Is that correct?\n> \n> The rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> But what if the head is not adjacent?

Let's sequence the events.\n> \n> When the head moves to a cell with food:\n> - The head occupies the food cell.\n> - If it's positive food, the snake grows: the tail does not move, and a new segment is added at the old tail position.\n> \n> So if the food is on the old tail position, and head moves there:\n> - Head moves to the cell, so now head and old tail are on the same cell (since tail didn't move), then a new segment is added at that same cell, so three segments on one cell, collision.\n> \n> If the food is not on tail, but on another cell, it's fine.\n> \n> But for food on tail, it's always deadly to eat it, because it forces the head and tail to be on the same cell after the move, before the new segment is added, but when head moves to the cell, it is occupied by tail, so collision happens when head moves in, before the growth.\n> \n> In the collision rule, \"body collision (head touches any body segment)\" when moving to a cell occupied by body.\n> \n> If the food is on tail cell, and head moves to it, since the cell is occupied by tail (a body segment), it should be a collision, regardless of eating.\n> \n> But the rule allows moving to tail cell when no food, because tail moves away.\n> \n> But when there is food on tail cell, if head moves to it, it is moving to a cell occupied by body, so collision should occur, and eating doesn't happen.\n> \n> The rule doesn't specify, but from the \"Tail Reward Danger\", it implies that eating it kills, so perhaps the move is attempted, but causes death.\n> \n> To avoid risk, we should never move to a cell that has food on the tail position, because it will cause collision.\n> \n> In this case, for the food at (4,3), it is on a body segment, not tail, so it can be eaten if we free it and head moves when it's free.\n> \n> But if it were on tail, it would be problematic.\n> \n> Back to the food at (4,3): it is on seg1, not tail, so it can be eaten.\n> \n> To eat it, we need the snake to move so that the body leaves (4,3), and then the head moves to (4,3) when it's empty and food is there.\n> \n> Since the body is on it, it will be occupied until the tail passes it.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,5).

Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head is at (5,2), then body segments at (5,3), (4,3), and tail at (4,4). So the snake has 4 segments.\n> \n> - Snake head direction: Currently moving Down (D). That means from the previous position, it was moving down to (5,2). Since direction is D, and head is at (5,2), it came from (5,3) above? Let's see the positions: snake positions are [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]. Head at (5,2), and next segment at (5,3), which is directly above, so yes, it was moving down to reach (5,2). So current direction is D.\n> \n> - Food:\n> - (4,2) with life span 4, value 1 (positive food)\n> - (6,1) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n> - (4,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, about the food at (4,3): (4,3) is occupied by a body segment of the snake. Specifically, it's the second segment in the list: positions are head (5,2), then (5,3), then (4,3), then (4,4). So (4,3) is the third segment, but since indexing starts at 0, (5,2) is index 0 (head), (5,3) index 1, (4,3) index 2, (4,4) index 3 (tail).\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is on a body segment. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. So currently, (4,3) has food, but it's under the snake, so we can't eat it now. We need to move the body away first.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (4,2) is at row 4, column 2; (6,1) at row 6, column 1.\n> \n> Grid visualization might help.

So (4,2) is not occupied, so food there is accessible.\n> \n> - (6,1): not occupied.\n> \n> - (4,3): occupied by snake body, so not accessible yet.\n> \n> Current head direction: D (down). So from (5,2), possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse? Rule: no instant reverse. Cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So I cannot move up next.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,2):\n> \n> - Down (D): to (5,1) - but y=1, not y=0, so it's within bounds? y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall, I think. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are free, except obstacles.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls. Similarly for x.\n> \n> So (5,1): x=5, y=1, x from 0-7, y from 0-7, y=1 is not wall, but let's check obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), which is not (5,1), so (5,1) should be free.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (4,2)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (6,2)\n> \n> - Up (U): but opposite direction, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible actions: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, (4,2) has food! Food at (4,2) with life span 4. Since we're at turn 17, and life span decreases every turn, including current, so after this turn, life span will be 3, then 2, etc. But we can eat it if we move there.\n> \n> But we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, (6,1) has food, but that's farther.\n> \n> And (4,3) has food under the body, which we can eat only if we move the body away.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate move.\n> \n> From head (5,2), moving:\n> \n> - D to (5,1): what is there? No food mentioned, so empty.\n> \n> - L to (4,2): food there, positive, so if we move there, we eat it, snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> - R to (6,2): no food, I think. Food is at (6,1), not (6,2).\n> \n> Now, if we eat at (4,2), snake grows: new head at (4,2), and body segments: the current head (5,2) becomes body, then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), and since we ate, we add a new segment, so tail stays or grows? Rule: eating positive food, length +1, so we add a segment.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows immediately, so positions: new head at food position, and the tail doesn't move that turn? Standard snake rules: when you eat, you grow, so the tail stays in place for that turn, meaning the new segment is added when the head moves to food, but the body doesn't move that turn? I need to recall the movement.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when the head moves to a food cell, it eats, and the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn. But in terms of positions, after move: head moves to new position, and if it eats, a new segment is added at the end, so the tail position remains the same for that turn.\n> \n> But in this game, since positions are given, let's see the movement.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> Also, for movement: each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward one cell, unless eating, in which case the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Yes, that's standard.\n> \n> So if we move to a food cell, we eat, and the tail doesn't move, so the new position list has the head at food, and all body segments shift, but tail stays, so we add a new segment at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Example: snake positions: [H, B1, B2, T]  H=head, T=tail.\n> \n> If head moves to a new cell that has food, then new positions: [new_H, H, B1, B2] and since we eat, T doesn't move, so it's [new_pos, old_head, B1, B2, T]? Positions: suppose head was at P, moves to Q (food), then Q is new head, P becomes new body, and the body segments follow, but since we eat, tail doesn't move, so the tail T remains, and we add a new segment at T? No.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, so tail moves away from its current position.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food cell, each body segment moves to the next position, but the tail does not move, meaning it stays in place, so a new segment is effectively added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, the position it occupied is now part of the body, and the new tail is the same cell? Let's think.\n> \n> Positions: before move: [A, B, C] A=head, C=tail.\n> \n> Move head to new cell D (no food): positions become [D, A, B] and C is no longer part of snake, so tail moved to B.\n> \n> If D has food: positions become [D, A, B, C] because tail didn't move, so C is still there, and we have an extra segment.\n> \n> In this case, from [A,B,C] to [D,A,B,C], so length increased by one.\n> \n> Similarly here.\n> \n> In our case, current positions: [(5,2)H, (5,3)B1, (4,3)B2, (4,4)T]\n> \n> If we move head to (4,2) which has food, then new positions: head at (4,2), then old head (5,2) becomes body, then (5,3), then (4,3), and tail (4,4) stays, so positions: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] and since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so (4,4) is still tail, but now it's followed by nothing? Positions should be: new head (4,2), then the previous positions except tail is kept: so [ (4,2) new head, (5,2) which was head now body, (5,3) body, (4,3) body, (4,4) tail ] and since we ate, no removal of tail, so the snake has 5 segments now.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> If no eat, move to empty cell, say (5,1), then positions: [ (5,1) new head, (5,2) body, (5,3) body, (4,3) body ] and tail (4,4) is removed, so positions become [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)] with (4,4) free now.\n> \n> Back to choices.\n> \n> If we move L to (4,2), we eat the food, grow to length 5.\n> \n> But is it safe? (4,2) is adjacent, and no immediate danger, but we need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (4,3) under the body. Currently, (4,3) is occupied by B2.\n> \n> If we move, the body might move away.\n> \n> Moreover, there's a danger about tail reward: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because of collision.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (4,4), not at (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) has food, but it's a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,4).\n> \n> Now, life spans: food at (4,2) has life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns, including this turn. Since turn 17, after this move, if we don't eat it, life span decreases to 3, then 2, etc. It disappears when life span reaches 0, I assume.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 6, (4,3) life span 9.\n> \n> (4,3) food is under snake, so it will be there until the snake moves away or life span ends.\n> \n> Now, possible actions for turn 17: D, L, R.\n> \n> L: to (4,2) - eat food, grow.\n> \n> R: to (6,2) - empty, I think.\n> \n> D: to (5,1) - empty.\n> \n> But we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders, so (5,1) is y=1, not wall, x=5 between 0-7.\n> \n> (4,2) x=4,y=2, not wall.\n> \n> (6,2) x=6,y=2, not wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), which is near (4,2).\n> \n> (3,2) is wall, so we can't move there.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the board state.\n> \n> Let me list all cells.\n> \n> Grid: rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells.

When no eat, tail moves away.\n> \n> Previous tail was (4,4), and since no eat, the last segment is removed, so positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] and (4,3) becomes the new tail? Let's see: the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to the head's previous position, etc.\n> \n> Standard: after head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So from positions: before move: index 0: (4,2)H, 1: (5,2)B1, 2: (5,3)B2, 3: (4,3)B3, 4: (4,4)T\n> \n> After moving head to (4,1) no food: new head at (4,1), then body: the segment that was at index 1 moves to where head was, (4,2), segment at index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (5,2), segment at index 3 moves to where index 2 was, (5,3), and segment at index 4 moves to where index 3 was, (4,3). But since no eat, we don't add a segment, so the tail segment moves to (4,3), and (4,4) is freed. New positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) ]? No.\n> \n> Positions list: the new head is at (4,1). The body segments: the previous head position (4,2) is now occupied by the first body segment. Then, the previous first body segment (5,2) is now occupied by the second body segment? No.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after move, the new position of segment i is the old position of segment i-1 for i>=1.\n> \n> Specifically: new_pos[0] = new head position (4,1)\n> \n> new_pos[1] = old_pos[0] = (4,2)  // previous head position\n> \n> new_pos[2] = old_pos[1] = (5,2)\n> \n> new_pos[3] = old_pos[2] = (5,3)\n> \n> new_pos[4] = old_pos[3] = (4,3)  // this was B3, now tail? Old tail was old_pos[4] = (4,4), but since no eat, we don't keep it, so the snake has one less segment? No.\n> \n> Length is fixed unless eating. When no eat, the tail is removed.\n> \n> So for a snake of length L, positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving head to new cell, no eat: new positions [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{L-2}] and T is removed, so the last segment is lost.\n> \n> In this case, length 5: positions indices 0:H, 1:B1, 2:B2, 3:B3, 4:T\n> \n> After move no eat: new head at new position, new body at old H position, new next at old B1 position, ..., new tail at old B3 position? Let's list:\n> \n> New position 0: (4,1)\n> \n> New position 1: old position 0 = (4,2)\n> \n> New position 2: old position 1 = (5,2)\n> \n> New position 3: old position 2 = (5,3)\n> \n> And old position 3 = (4,3) is not used, and old position 4 = (4,4) is freed.\n> \n> So the new snake has positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] with length 4? But we had length 5, after no eat, it should be length 4.\n> \n> Yes, because we didn't eat, so length decreases? No, length only increases when eating; otherwise, it stays the same, but when moving without eating, the length is the same, but the tail moves forward.\n> \n> In terms of segment count: if no eat, the number of segments remains the same, but the tail cell changes.\n> \n> In this case, from 5 segments, after moving without eating, we still have 5 segments, but the tail has moved.\n> \n> In my earlier: positions before move: [ (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ] 5 positions.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,1) no food: the head moves to (4,1), then the body segments: the segment that was at (5,2) moves to (4,2), but (4,2) is now occupied by the new body, let's think of the positions shifting.\n> \n> The new position of the snake: the head is at (4,1). Then, the first body segment is at the previous head position (4,2). Then the second body segment is at the previous first body position (5,2). Then the third body segment is at the previous second body position (5,3). Then the tail is at the previous third body position (4,3). The previous tail position (4,4) is now empty.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) ]? (4,3) is the tail now.\n> \n> But (4,3) was previously occupied, and now it's tail.\n> \n> In this case, the food at (4,3) is still there, but now the snake is at (4,3) as tail.\n> \n> But the food is under the tail now.\n> \n> Back to the sequence.\n> \n> If on turn 17 we move L to (4,2), eat food, positions become: [ (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]\n> \n> Then on turn 18, from (4,2), only possible move is D to (4,1), no food there, so move: head to (4,1), no eat, so new positions: head (4,1), body at previous head (4,2), body at previous B1 (5,2), body at previous B2 (5,3), tail at previous B3 (4,3). Previous tail (4,4) freed.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) ] with (4,3) as tail.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3) is under the tail, but since it's tail, and we can move, but to eat it, we need the head to move there after the body moves away.\n> \n> Currently, head at (4,1), direction down (since moved D).\n> \n> From (4,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction D, so cannot move U (up).\n> \n> Current direction is D, so cannot move U.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - D to (4,0): but y=0 is wall, death.\n> \n> - L to (3,1): x=3,y=1, not border, but internal obstacle?

It's turn 18, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2). Snake positions: head at (4,2), then body segments at (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4). So the snake is 5 segments long. Head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1 and life span 5. Since it's turn 18, this food will disappear after 5 turns, so on turn 23.\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 8. Disappears on turn 26.\n> \n> But (4,3) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, looking at snake positions: (4,2) head, (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4). So (4,3) is the fourth segment, which is part of the body.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. So for (4,3), since it's under the body, I might be able to eat it later if I move such that the snake leaves that cell and then head comes back.\n> \n> But also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide. In this case, the tail is at (4,4). Let's see where the head is: (4,2).\n> \n> Head at (4,2), tail at (4,4). Are they adjacent? (4,2) and (4,4) are two cells apart vertically. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. (4,2) and (4,4) have (4,3) in between, so not adjacent; they are separated by one cell. So no immediate danger there.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6. Similarly y from 1 to 6. But internal obstacle at (3,2), which is within playable area.\n> \n> Playable cells: (1,1) to (6,6), except (3,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head (4,2), body: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), tail (4,4).\n> \n> Head direction is L, so last move was left to (4,2). Since head is at (4,2) and direction is L, it came from right, so previous head was at (5,2), but (5,2) is now the second segment.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,2), moving left. So possible moves from here: I can go U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But I cannot do instant reverse, which would be R (right), since current direction is L. So I cannot go right immediately.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> Walls: if I go left to (3,2), but (3,2) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall. So I cannot go left to (3,2) because it's blocked.\n> \n> x=3,y=2 is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall cell, so moving left to (3,2) is invalid.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go down to (4,1), but y=0 is wall, so (4,1) might be playable? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the bottom row? Let's define coordinates.\n> \n> Assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Typically in such games, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left. But here, walls are given, so cells: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, with borders walls.\n> \n> But for movement, moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is wall collision.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Playable cells: all (x,y) where 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6, except (3,2).\n> \n> Now, head at (4,2). Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (4,3) but (4,3) is currently occupied by the snake body. (4,3) is the fourth segment. If I move up to (4,3), that would be a body collision because it's not the tail; the tail is at (4,4). When the head moves, if it hits a body segment, it dies, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n> \n> In this case, (4,3) is not the tail; tail is at (4,4). So moving to (4,3) would collide with body segment, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: to (4,1).

I need to confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> The state says: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So (x,y) with y=0 is bottom or top? Not specified, but since movement U is (x,y+1), it implies that increasing y is up, so probably (0,0) is bottom-left, y increasing upwards.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4). So from (4,2) to (5,2) is right, then to (5,3) is up, then to (4,3) is left, then to (4,4) is up. So y increasing is up.\n> \n> So (4,1) would be down from (4,2), so y=1 is below y=2.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so (4,1) should be playable if y=1 is within bounds.

The tail (4,4) moves away? When snake moves, the tail moves only if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since I'm moving to (4,1), which has no food, so no growth, so the tail will move off the current position.\n> \n> Current snake: positions [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n> \n> After moving down to (4,1), new positions: head at (4,1), then the previous head (4,2) becomes second segment, then (5,2) third, (5,3) fourth, and tail (4,3) — since no food eaten, tail moves off (4,4), so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)]? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Original: index 0: head (4,2), 1: (5,2), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4) tail.\n> \n> After move down to (4,1): new head (4,1), then the body segments are the previous positions except the tail is removed if no food, so segments: new head (4,1), then previous head (4,2), then (5,2), then (5,3), then (4,3) as tail? But (4,3) was the fourth segment, now it becomes the tail.\n> \n> Positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n> \n> Yes, tail at (4,3).\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3) is still there, but under the tail now? Food at (4,3) is present, and now the tail is at (4,3), but since it's the tail, when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat, the tail moves away.\n> \n> But for now, at this state, I need to plan multiple moves.\n> \n> But back to turn 18: I must choose an action for turn 18.\n> \n> As per above, only possible move is down to (4,1).

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 18, life span 5, so it has 5 turns left, including turn 18, so it will disappear after turn 22? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,1), at turn 18, life_span=5, meaning it will disappear after 5 turns from now. Since countdown decreases each turn including current, after turn 18, countdown becomes 4; after turn 19, 3; ... after turn 22, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 23? Or at the end of turn?\n> \n> Typically, it might be that at the start of turn, countdown decreases, and if 0, food disappears before the turn.\n> \n> But to be precise: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at each turn, the life span decreases by one at the beginning of the turn.\n> \n> So for turn 18, life span 5; after turn 18, it becomes 4 for turn 19, and so on, down to 0 after turn 22, so it disappears before turn 23.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,3): life span 8 at turn 18, so it will last until after turn 25, disappear before turn 26.\n> \n> But (4,3) is currently under snake body, and in the new state after move, it might be under tail.\n> \n> In turn 18, after moving down to (4,1), the snake becomes [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)] with tail at (4,3).\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is under the tail.\n> \n> To eat it, the tail must move away, and then head move onto it.\n> \n> Now, for the food at (6,1), it's at (6,1), which is near the bottom right.\n> \n> I need to plan how to eat food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Since I have to go down on turn 18, let's set that.\n> \n> Action for turn 18: D (down to (4,1))\n> \n> Now, after this, head is at (4,1), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,1):\n> \n> - U: up to (4,2) — but (4,2) is now occupied by the second segment?

I'll assume (0,0) is bottom-left, but in coordinates, y=0 is bottom? Typically in such grids, y=0 might be the bottom row, but I should confirm from the movement. Head direction is down, and positions: head (4,1), then (4,2) which is above it? Let's list the positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Next: (4,2) – so if y increases upwards, (4,2) is north of (4,1). Then (5,2) which is east of (4,2), then (5,3) north of (5,2), then (4,3) west of (5,3). So the snake is shaped like: from (4,1) down? Head is at (4,1), moving down, but if moving down, y decreases? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upwards, y decreases downwards. So (4,1) to (4,2) is moving up, but head direction is given as D, down. Contradiction?\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Head at (4,1), and head direction is D, meaning it was moving down to (4,1)? But from where? The previous position isn't given, but since positions are listed head first, (4,1) is head, then (4,2) is the first body segment, which would be where the head was before. So if head is at (4,1) and previous was (4,2), that means it moved from (4,2) to (4,1), which is down, since y decreased from 2 to 1. Yes, so moving down.\n> \n> Current head at (4,1), and it just moved down to there. So possible moves: since it moved down, it cannot instantly reverse to up (U) because of no instant reverse rule. So next move can be L, R, or D, but not U.\n> \n> Available moves: L (left to (3,1)), R (right to (5,1)), D (down to (4,0)).\n> \n> But (4,0) is y=0, which is the bottom border, so that's a wall, cannot go there. Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So (4,0) is y=0, wall, so cannot move D.\n> \n> Similarly, moving L to (3,1): is that a wall? Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,1) is within bounds, not a border. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not (3,1), so (3,1) should be free.\n> \n> Moving R to (5,1): x=5,y=1, not border, not obstacle.\n> \n> Also, food at (6,1), (4,3), (3,1).\n> \n> (3,1) has food, and it's directly left of head.\n> \n> (4,3) has food, but that's where the tail is? Snake positions: last segment is (4,3), and food is at (4,3). But (4,3) is occupied by the snake's tail.\n> \n> Food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,3), and food is there. But to eat it, the tail must move away first, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Now, the head is at (4,1), tail at (4,3), so they are not adjacent; positions: (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3). So head (4,1), then (4,2), then (5,2), then (5,3), then tail (4,3). So (4,1) to (4,2) is vertical, then to (5,2) right, then to (5,3) up, then to (4,3) left. So tail at (4,3).\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is under the tail. To eat it, the snake must move so that tail moves away, then head can move to (4,3).\n> \n> But (4,3) is currently occupied, so head can't move there directly.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide after growth.\n> \n> But here, head is at (4,1), tail at (4,3), which are not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,1) and (4,2) are adjacent, (4,2) and (5,2), etc., but (4,1) and (4,3) are not adjacent; (4,2) is between them. So no issue now.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 19.\n> \n> Current head: (4,1), direction D (down).\n> \n> Cannot move U (up) because reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Move D to (4,0): but y=0, wall, invalid.\n> \n> Move L to (3,1): possible, and there is food at (3,1).\n> \n> Move R to (5,1): possible, no food there.\n> \n> Also, could I not move directly to food?

No.\n> \n> When snake eats, it grows, so after moving, the head is at new position, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail stays for this turn.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, on that turn, you move to the food cell, and since it's food, length increases, so the tail does not move; it stays, so the new position has head at food, and tail remains.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: before move: snake at S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move without eating: new head position, remove tail, so [new_head, H, B1, ..., B_last] where B_last was before T?

So no wall collision.\n> \n> Now, is (6,1) occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). (6,1) is not in this list, so it's free. So moving to (6,1) should eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n> \n> But there's a special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. Here, tail is at (5,3). Head is at (5,1), tail at (5,3). Are they adjacent? (5,1) and (5,3) are not adjacent; they are two apart vertically. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right. (5,1) and (5,3) differ by y=2, so not adjacent. Tail food: the food is at (6,1), not on tail. So no issue.\n> \n> Moving to (6,1) eats the food, snake grows to length 6. New positions: head at (6,1), then body: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3).

Since I eat on turn 20, it's fine.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Other moves:\n> \n> - Move U to (5,2): (5,2) is currently occupied by the snake body. Snake positions: (5,1) head, then (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). So (5,2) is the fourth segment? Let's index: position 0: (5,1) head, 1: (4,1), 2: (4,2), 3: (5,2), 4: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> So (5,2) is position 3, a body segment. Moving to (5,2) would cause head to collide with body, which is deadly.

But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> y increases up? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is wall.\n> \n> In positions, snake has (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3).

(6,2) not occupied.\n> \n> Also, walls: x=6, y=2, not wall except borders, x=6<7, y=2>0, not wall. Internal obstacle (3,2), not here.\n> \n> So U to (6,2) is possible.\n> \n> But is there food?

Tail was (5,2), but head moves there, and since no food eaten, tail segment is removed, so new tail is (4,2)? Let's see snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (6,2), 1: (6,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (4,2), 5: (5,2) tail.\n> \n> If I move left to (5,2), which is current position of tail.\n> \n> New head position: (5,2)\n> \n> Then body segments: the segment that was at index 0 moves to where head was?

Current positions: head (6,2) to (6,3), seg1 (6,1) to (6,2), seg2 (5,1) to (6,1), seg3 (4,1) to (5,1), seg4 (4,2) to (4,1), and seg5 (5,2) gone. So new snake: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2) — wait no, seg4 was (4,2), moves to old seg3 position (4,1)? Old seg3 was (4,1), position.\n> \n> Old: seg0: (6,2), seg1: (6,1), seg2: (5,1), seg3: (4,1), seg4: (4,2), seg5: (5,2)\n> \n> After move up to (6,3):\n> \n> New head: (6,3)\n> \n> seg1 moves to (6,2)  // old head\n> \n> seg2 moves to (6,1)  // old seg1\n> \n> seg3 moves to (5,1)  // old seg2\n> \n> seg4 moves to (4,1)  // old seg3\n> \n> seg5 moves to (4,2)  // old seg4, but since no eat, we don't keep tail; the segment is not added, so the last position is not occupied by tail.\n> \n> When no eat, the tail is removed, so only 5 segments.\n> \n> New positions: head (6,3), then body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)  // and (4,2) is no longer part of snake; old seg4 was at (4,2), but it moves to (4,1), and since no new segment, the cell (4,2) is empty now.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) is empty.\n> \n> So after move up, snake: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n> \n> Tail at (4,1)\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3) is close. (4,3) is above (4,2), but (4,2) is now empty? In current state, (4,2) is occupied by snake, but after move, it might be free.\n> \n> But for turn 22, we are deciding action.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (4,3), which is adjacent to current head (6,2)? (4,3) is at x=4,y=3, head at (6,2), so not adjacent directly; distance is |6-4| + |2-3| = 2+1=3, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: up (6,3), down (6,1) but invalid, left (5,2), right (7,2) invalid.\n> \n> So only (6,3) and (5,2) possible.\n> \n> (4,3) is at (4,3), which is left and up from head, but not directly adjacent.\n> \n> To reach (4,3), I need to move left or up first.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, note that (4,3) has short life span, only 4 turns, so I need to eat it soon if possible.\n> \n> Life span 4 at turn 22, so must eat by turn 25.\n> \n> Now, the grid has an obstacle at (3,2), which is wall, so I cannot go there.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Also, internal wall at (3,2), so (3,2) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions turn 22:\n> \n> - (6,2) head\n> \n> - (6,1)\n> \n> - (5,1)\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> - (4,2)\n> \n> - (5,2) tail\n> \n> Food: (4,3), (3,1), (4,5)\n> \n> (3,1) is at x=3,y=1.

Earlier I thought (4,2) was vacated. Yes, in new snake, positions are (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), so (4,2) is empty.

In current positions, (4,1) is not occupied; after previous move, positions are (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), so (4,1) is free? But moving down to (4,1) from (4,2).\n> \n> (4,1) is not in snake, and no wall, so free, but no food.\n> \n> - Left to (3,2): but (3,2) is wall!

If no food, tail moves to the next position, effectively shortening the snake path.\n> \n> But for collision, head cannot collide with body except the tail, but since tail moves, it's ok to move to where tail was.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But if you eat food on the tail cell, it might be dangerous.\n> \n> First, back to reaching (4,3).\n> \n> Suppose at t=23, I move left to (5,3).\n> \n> Then snake positions: head moves to (5,3), body follows: the segment at (6,3) becomes body, so new positions: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), and tail (4,2) moves? When head moves to (5,3), since (5,3) is empty? Is there food? (5,3) is not a food position, so no eat, so tail moves forward.\n> \n> After head moves to new cell, if no food, tail moves, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (6,3) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (4,2) tail.\n> \n> After move left to (5,3): head to (5,3), so new head (5,3), then the body: the first body segment was (6,2), but now it should be the previous head position? Snake movement: when head moves, the new head is at the new position, and the body shifts, so the segment that was head becomes the neck, and so on, and if no food eaten, the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So after moving to (5,3) with no food: new positions: head (5,3), then body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1).

New positions: head to (4,3), then body: the current head (5,3) becomes new neck, so positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]? When head moves to new cell, if eat, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail stays.\n> \n> Standard: after move and eat, the head is at new position, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Let's think: before move, positions: [head, body..., tail]\n> \n> After move without eat: head moves to new cell, body follows, tail moves off previous position.\n> \n> After move with eat: head moves to new cell (food), body follows, but since ate, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail position stays, and snake grows.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head position, then the rest, and tail position unchanged, so one more segment.\n> \n> In this case, before: positions [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)] tail (4,1)\n> \n> After move L to (4,3) and eat: head to (4,3), then the previous positions: (5,3) becomes part of body, so [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)] but (4,1) is still there, and since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so (4,1) is now the second last, and a new segment is added? No.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Typically in snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not advance, meaning that the last segment (tail) remains in place, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> So the new positions are: the new head at the food cell, then the previous head position, then the previous body positions in order, and the tail position remains, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> For example, before: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to food: [newH (food), H, B1, B2, ..., T] so T is still there, and since body follows, the segment that was H is now behind newH, etc., and T is the last, so length increased.\n> \n> In this case, before: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) tail.\n> \n> After moving L to (4,3) and eating: new head at (4,3), then previous head (5,3) becomes neck, then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) and since ate, the tail (4,1) stays, so positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]\n> \n> So the tail is still (4,1), and the segment at (4,1) is now part of the body, with the new tail being the same cell, but it's the last segment.\n> \n> The tail position is (4,1), and it doesn't move because we ate food.\n> \n> If no eat, tail would move to the next position, but here it stays.\n> \n> So new snake: length 7, positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), tail (4,1)\n> \n> Now, the cell (4,1) is occupied, and head is at (4,3).\n> \n> Now, for other moves.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (4,3) with short life.

It's turn 25. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then body segments at (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to (4,3) from (5,3), I assume.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1 and life span 4. So it disappears after turn 25 + 4 = turn 29, but since life span decreases each turn including current, on turn 25, life span is 4, so it has 4 turns left including turn 25. After turn 25, life span becomes 3, and so on, until turn 29 it disappears.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L on turn T, it will disappear after T + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N on turn T, it decreases each turn, so:\n> \n> - Turn T: life span N\n> \n> - Turn T+1: life span N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn T + (N-1): life span 1\n> \n> - On turn T + N, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn T to turn T + (N-1), inclusive.\n> \n> For food at (3,1): on turn 25, life span 4, so it can be eaten on turns 25, 26, 27, 28.

No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, from turn 25 to turn 29 or beyond. But I should think strategically.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Walls at borders, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,3)\n> \n> - Body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n> \n> So let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - (4,3) head\n> \n> - (5,3)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> - (6,2)\n> \n> - (6,1)\n> \n> - (5,1)\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> Also, tail is at (4,1), which will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so from (5,3) to (4,3), moving left.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - Up: U to (4,4)\n> \n> - Down: D to (4,2)\n> \n> - Left: L to (3,3)\n> \n> - Right: R to (5,3)\n> \n> But (5,3) is occupied by the body, so moving right would cause collision, since it's not the tail. Tail is at (4,1), so (5,3) is a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to a body segment other than the tail is deadly. Moving to tail is ok only if tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (4,4) - is this free? Let's see occupied cells: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). So (4,4) is not occupied, and not wall? Walls are borders, so (4,4) should be within bounds, x=4, y=4, between 1 and 6, and no internal obstacle there. Internal obstacle is at (3,2), so (4,4) is free. Assuming no other obstacles.\n> \n> - D: (4,2) - is this occupied? Not in the list, and not wall, internal obstacle is (3,2), so (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> - L: (3,3) - not occupied, not wall, internal obstacle is (3,2), so (3,3) should be free.\n> \n> - R: (5,3) - but (5,3) is occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, movement constraint: no instant reverse. Current direction is L, so cannot move R immediately, since R is opposite of L. Left and right are opposites, up and down.\n> \n> Directions: U (y+1), D (y-1), L (x-1), R (x+1). So from L, opposite is R, so cannot move R on next turn.\n> \n> Therefore, from (4,3), possible moves: U, D, L. R is invalid due to reverse and also occupied.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (3,1) - value 1, life span 4, can be eaten until turn 28.\n> \n> - (4,5) - value 1, life span 7, until turn 31.\n> \n> - (2,1) - value 1, life span 10, until turn 34.\n> \n> Also, note that (3,1) is currently occupied? Snake positions include (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), but not (3,1). Food is at (3,1), which is not occupied by snake, I think.\n> \n> Snake: (4,1) is body, (5,1), (6,1), but (3,1) is not listed, so food should be there.\n> \n> But food can be under body? Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> In this case, is (3,1) under body? Snake body includes (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), but (3,1) is separate. Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> (3,1) is a cell, and snake has segments at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), so (3,1) is not occupied by snake, I believe. The snake positions list is the cells occupied by the snake, so (3,1) is free for food.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (4,5) and (2,1) should not be occupied.\n> \n> (4,5): snake is at y=1,2,3, so (4,5) free.\n> \n> (2,1): snake at x=4,5,6, y=1, so (2,1) should be free.\n> \n> Also, (3,1) is near the tail. Tail is at (4,1), which is adjacent to (3,1)? (4,1) and (3,1) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Now, there's a special rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> But here, the food is at (3,1), not on the tail. Tail is at (4,1), which has no food.\n> \n> Food is at (3,1), so if head moves to (3,1), it eats the food, and snake grows, so new tail will be added after moving.\n> \n> But (3,1) is adjacent to current tail (4,1). But the danger is when the food is on the tail cell itself.\n> \n> Rule says: \"if the tail cell has positive food\"\n> \n> Here, tail cell is (4,1), and food is at (3,1), not on (4,1), so no issue.\n> \n> Only if food is on the tail cell and head is adjacent, eating it causes collision because after eating, tail doesn't move, so head and tail collide.\n> \n> But here, food is not on tail, so safe to eat.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan moves to eat food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's see the map visually. I'll sketch a grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake:\n> \n> Head: (4,3)\n> \n> Body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)  // tail at (4,1)\n> \n> Food: (3,1), (4,5), (2,1)\n> \n> Now, life spans: (3,1) has short life, only 4 turns left, must be eaten soon.\n> \n> (4,5) has 7 turns, (2,1) has 10, so less urgent.\n> \n> But I need to maximize score, so eating any is good, but prioritize based on risk and opportunity.\n> \n> Also, think long-term survival.\n> \n> Now, from head (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3).\n> \n> I should consider each option.\n> \n> First, if I go L to (3,3): then head at (3,3). From there, I can go to (3,1) or other places.\n> \n> (3,1) is below, so from (3,3), I can go D to (3,2), but (3,2) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot go there.\n> \n> (3,2) is blocked, so from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2) but blocked, L to (2,3), R to (4,3) but (4,3) is now body? After moving to (3,3), the snake moves, so positions change.\n> \n> I need to simulate the moves.\n> \n> Start from turn 25.\n> \n> Turn 25: head at (4,3), direction L.\n> \n> Action choices: U, D, L.\n> \n> If I choose L: move to (3,3). Then snake becomes: head (3,3), body: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) and tail (4,1) moves? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> Basic snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food cell, new segment is added at the tail end, so tail stays, and snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,3), which has no food, so snake moves: head to (3,3), then (4,3) becomes new body position for the first segment, (5,3) to (4,3)? Let's trace.\n> \n> Old positions: [ (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) ]  // head at (4,3)\n> \n> After move L to (3,3): new head is (3,3). Then the body segments follow: the segment that was at (4,3) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard: the new head is at (3,3), then the first body segment moves to the old head position (4,3), second body segment moves to old first body position (5,3), and so on, up to the tail.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head, 1: first body, etc., up to tail.\n> \n> After move, new position 0: (3,3)\n> \n> Position 1: old position 0 = (4,3)\n> \n> Position 2: old position 1 = (5,3)\n> \n> Position 3: old position 2 = (6,3)\n> \n> Position 4: old position 3 = (6,2)\n> \n> Position 5: old position 4 = (6,1)\n> \n> Position 6: old position 5 = (5,1)  // tail was old position 6 at (4,1), but since no growth, tail is removed, so positions 1 to 6 become positions 1 to 5? Length 7, after move no eat, length still 7, so new positions: head (3,3), then body: (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) — (5,1) is now tail, since (4,1) is gone.\n> \n> Old tail (4,1) is left, so snake now occupies: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n> \n> So tail at (5,1)\n> \n> Food at (3,1) is still there.\n> \n> Now, from (3,3), head direction is L (since moved left).\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2) but (3,2) is wall, blocked, L to (2,3), R to (4,3) but (4,3) is now body, so cannot move R, and also reverse?

Positions: after move to (4,1), head (4,1), then body: old head (4,2), then (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) — (6,1) is now second last, tail is (6,1)? Let's list:\n> \n> Old positions before turn 26: head (4,2), body (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) — position 0: (4,2), 1: (4,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,1), 6: (5,1)\n> \n> After move D to (4,1): new head (4,1), then position 1: old pos0 = (4,2), position 2: old pos1 = (4,3), position 3: old pos2 = (5,3), position 4: old pos3 = (6,3), position 5: old pos4 = (6,2), position 6: old pos5 = (6,1) — and old tail (5,1) gone.

After move, occupied: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) — so (5,1) is free, and not wall.\n> \n> Current direction D, so U is opposite, cannot.\n> \n> So possible: L to (3,1) to eat food, or R to (5,1).\n> \n> If I go L to (3,1), eat food at (3,1), value +1, snake grows to length 8.\n> \n> New head at (3,1), and since ate, new tail added, so tail remains the old tail, which was (6,1), but positions: after eating, head moves to (3,1), and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Old positions before move: head (4,1), body (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> After eating at (3,1): new head at (3,1), then the body segments: position 1: old head position (4,1), position 2: old pos1 (4,2), ..., up to position 7: old pos6 (6,1), and new tail added, so position 8: where? When you eat, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> Standard: after moving head to food cell, the body moves as usual, but the tail doesn't advance; instead, a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail position remains occupied.\n> \n> In this case: old tail was at (6,1). After head moves to (3,1), the body moves: position 1: old head (4,1), position 2: old pos1 (4,2), position 3: old pos2 (4,3), position 4: old pos3 (5,3), position 5: old pos4 (6,3), position 6: old pos5 (6,2), position 7: old pos6 (6,1), and since ate, add new segment at old tail position, so position 8: (6,1)? No.\n> \n> When you eat, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, but the tail does not move; a new segment is created at the position where the tail was, so the snake extends.\n> \n> Positions: new head at food cell (3,1)\n> \n> Then the first body segment is at the old head position (4,1)\n> \n> Second body segment at old first body position (4,2)\n> \n> Third at (4,3)\n> \n> Fourth at (5,3)\n> \n> Fifth at (6,3)\n> \n> Sixth at (6,2)\n> \n> Seventh at (6,1)  // this was old tail\n> \n> Eighth: new segment at (6,1)? But (6,1) is already occupied by the seventh segment?

No, in snake, when no eat, tail moves to new position, but when eat, tail does not move, so the position of segment 6 is now occupied by segment 7, but segment 6 was tail at (6,1), after head moves, segment 1 goes to (4,1), etc., segment 6 goes to (6,2)? Let's think the movement.\n> \n> Standard snake movement when eating:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell (food cell)\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment\n> \n> - Since eating, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added there.\n> \n> So after move:\n> \n> New head: (3,1)\n> \n> New segment 1: old head position (4,1)\n> \n> New segment 2: old segment 1 position (4,2)\n> \n> New segment 3: old segment 2 position (4,3)\n> \n> New segment 4: old segment 3 position (5,3)\n> \n> New segment 5: old segment 4 position (6,3)\n> \n> New segment 6: old segment 5 position (6,2)\n> \n> New segment 7: old segment 6 position (6,1)  // this is the old tail position, but since eating, it becomes a body segment, and a new segment is added at (6,1)?

Old segment 5 is at (6,2), so new segment 6 at (6,2).\n> \n> Then, since eating, a new segment is created at the old position of the tail, which is (6,1), so new segment 7 at (6,1).\n> \n> But old segment 6 was at (6,1), and it moved to (6,2), so (6,1) is vacant except for the new segment.\n> \n> Positions after eating:\n> \n> - Head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,1)  // old head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (4,2)  // old seg1\n> \n> - Segment 3: (4,3)  // old seg2\n> \n> - Segment 4: (5,3)  // old seg3\n> \n> - Segment 5: (6,3)  // old seg4\n> \n> - Segment 6: (6,2)  // old seg5\n> \n> - Segment 7: (6,1)  // new segment at old tail position\n> \n> And tail is segment 7 at (6,1)\n> \n> In terms of cells, occupied: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So after eating (3,1), snake is longer, and positions include (3,1) to (6,1) and up.\n> \n> Now, back to planning.\n> \n> If at turn 25, I go D to (4,2), then turn 26 go D to (4,1), then turn 27 go L to (3,1) to eat, on turn 27.\n> \n> (3,1) life span 4, on turn 25, so on turn 27, life span should be 2, since each turn decreases.\n> \n> Turn 25: life span 4\n> \n> Turn 26: life span 3\n> \n> Turn 27: life span 2, so can be eaten.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> If I go directly to eat, but from (4,3) at turn 25, I can't go directly to (3,1) because (3,2) is blocked.\n> \n> So this path requires two moves to reach (3,1): first to (4,2), then to (4,1), then to (3,1).\n> \n> At turn 25, from (4,3), if I go L to (3,3), then from (3,3), I can go to (2,3) or (3,4), but to reach (3,1), I need to go to (2,3) then down to (2,2) then to (2,1) or (3,1), but (3,1) from (2,2) is not adjacent, (2,2) to (3,1) is diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent are (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2) but (3,2) blocked.\n> \n> From (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) blocked.\n> \n> So to (2,1) or (1,2) or back.\n> \n> From (2,2), I can go to (2,1) to eat food there, or to (3,1) is not directly possible.\n> \n> (3,1) can only be reached from (3,0) wall, (2,1), (4,1), or (3,2) blocked. So only (2,1) or (4,1).\n> \n> (2,1) has food, but different food.\n> \n> For (3,1), I must go through (2,1) or (4,1).\n> \n> (4,1) might be easier from current position.\n> \n> At turn 25, if I go D to (4,2), then D to (4,1) on turn 26, then L to (3,1) on turn 27 to eat.\n> \n> That seems efficient.\n> \n> If I go U or other, it might take longer.\n> \n> Another choice: at (4,3), go U to (4,4).\n> \n> Then head to (4,4), no food, snake moves: head (4,4), body (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1).\n> \n> Then from there, I can go to (4,5) which has food, but (4,5) is above, so from (4,4) go U to (4,5) to eat.\n> \n> But (4,5) has longer life, not urgent.\n> \n> Whereas (3,1) must be eaten soon.\n> \n> So probably better to go for (3,1) first.\n> \n> Moreover, after eating (3,1), the snake is longer, and I can plan for other food.\n> \n> Also, need to think about survival.\n> \n> Currently, the snake is in the bottom right area, with head at (4,3), and body around.\n> \n> After eating (3,1), head at (3,1), which is near the wall.\n> \n> Now, let's plan the sequence for 5 turns: turn 25 to 29.\n> \n> Turn 25: action\n> \n> Turn 26: action\n> \n> Turn 27: action\n> \n> Turn 28: action\n> \n> Turn 29: action\n> \n> And beyond if possible.\n> \n> But at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Now, for (3,1), it can be eaten until turn 28, so on turn 27 or 28.\n> \n> If I go the path: turn 25: D to (4,2)\n> \n> Then turn 26: from (4,2), I can go D to (4,1) or R to (5,2)\n> \n> But to reach (3,1), better to go D to (4,1)\n> \n> Then turn 27: from (4,1), go L to (3,1) to eat.\n> \n> So on turn 27, eat (3,1).\n> \n> Now, after that, snake is at positions as above: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,1), direction L (since moved left from (4,1)).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,1):\n> \n> U to (3,2) but blocked, wall.\n> \n> D to (3,0) wall, cannot.\n> \n> L to (2,1) — (2,1) has food, value 1, life span 10, can be eaten.\n> \n> R to (4,1) but (4,1) is body, occupied, cannot.\n> \n> Current direction L, so R is opposite, cannot anyway.\n> \n> So only possible move: L to (2,1) to eat food there.\n> \n> (2,1) has food, so I can eat it immediately on turn 28.\n> \n> Turn 27: just ate (3,1), head at (3,1)\n> \n> Turn 28: from (3,1), go L to (2,1) to eat (2,1).\n> \n> Then snake grows again.\n> \n> After eating (2,1): head at (2,1), food eaten.\n> \n> Old positions before move: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> Move to (2,1): new head (2,1)\n> \n> Then segment 1: old head (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 2: old seg1 (4,1)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Segment 8: old seg7 (6,1)\n> \n> And since ate, add new segment at old tail position, so segment 9: (6,1)\n> \n> Positions: head (2,1), seg1 (3,1), seg2 (4,1), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,1), and new seg9 at (6,1)? No, similar to before.\n> \n> After head moves to (2,1):\n> \n> New head: (2,1)\n> \n> Seg1: old head (3,1)\n> \n> Seg2: old seg1 (4,1)\n> \n> Seg3: old seg2 (4,2)\n> \n> Seg4: old seg3 (4,3)\n> \n> Seg5: old seg4 (5,3)\n> \n> Seg6: old seg5 (6,3)\n> \n> Seg7: old seg6 (6,2)\n> \n> Seg8: old seg7 (6,1)  // this was tail\n> \n> Then new segment added at (6,1), so seg9: (6,1)\n> \n> But (6,1) is now occupied by seg8 and seg9? No, seg8 moves to (6,1) from old seg7, and new seg9 at old tail position which is (6,1), but since seg8 moved there, it's the same cell? I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Old positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (3,1)\n> \n> 1: (4,1)\n> \n> 2: (4,2)\n> \n> 3: (4,3)\n> \n> 4: (5,3)\n> \n> 5: (6,3)\n> \n> 6: (6,2)\n> \n> 7: tail (6,1)\n> \n> Head moves to (2,1)\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> Head: (2,1)\n> \n> Seg1: old pos0 = (3,1)\n> \n> Seg2: old pos1 = (4,1)\n> \n> Seg3: old pos2 = (4,2)\n> \n> Seg4: old pos3 = (4,3)\n> \n> Seg5: old pos4 = (5,3)\n> \n> Seg6: old pos5 = (6,3)\n> \n> Seg7: old pos6 = (6,2)\n> \n> Seg8: old pos7 = (6,1)  // old tail\n> \n> Since ate, new segment added at old tail position (6,1), so seg9: (6,1)\n> \n> But seg8 is at (6,1), and seg9 at (6,1), same cell? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I confused the indexing.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell, the body segments each move to the position of the previous segment. So:\n> \n> - New position 0: head at (2,1)\n> \n> - New position 1: old position 0 (3,1)\n> \n> - New position 2: old position 1 (4,1)\n> \n> - New position 3: old position 2 (4,2)\n> \n> - New position 4: old position 3 (4,3)\n> \n> - New position 5: old position 4 (5,3)\n> \n> - New position 6: old position 5 (6,3)\n> \n> - New position 7: old position 6 (6,2)\n> \n> - New position 8: old position 7 (6,1)  // this is the new tail if no eat, but since eat, we add a new segment.\n> \n> After moving, the snake has positions 0 to 7, with position 8 being the new position from old tail, but since no eat, position 8 would be the new tail cell, but in this case, with growth, the tail doesn't move; we keep the old tail position and add a new segment there.\n> \n> Standard: when eating, the head moves to food, the body moves as usual, but the tail segment does not advance; it stays, and a new segment is added at the old tail position.\n> \n> So for positions:\n> \n> After head moves to (2,1):\n> \n> - Head: (2,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 1: old head position (3,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 2: old position of segment 1, which is (4,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 3: old position of segment 2, which is (4,2)\n> \n> - Body segment 4: old position of segment 3, which is (4,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 5: old position of segment 4, which is (5,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 6: old position of segment 5, which is (6,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 7: old position of segment 6, which is (6,2)  // this was the last body segment before tail\n> \n> - Body segment 8: old position of segment 7, which was tail at (6,1), but since it was tail, and we eat, it doesn't move; instead, it stays as a body segment, and a new segment is added at (6,1).\n> \n> I think I have it.\n> \n> Old tail is at (6,1). When we eat, the tail segment remains where it is, and a new segment is added at that position, so the tail position is unchanged, and we have an additional segment.\n> \n> So after moving head to (2,1):\n> \n> - New head: (2,1)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head position (3,1)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 position (4,1)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old segment 2 position (4,2)\n> \n> - New segment 4: old segment 3 position (4,3)\n> \n> - New segment 5: old segment 4 position (5,3)\n> \n> - New segment 6: old segment 5 position (6,3)\n> \n> - New segment 7: old segment 6 position (6,2)  // this was the second last\n> \n> - New segment 8: old segment 7 position (6,1)  // this was the tail, and it moves to the new position? No.\n> \n> In the body movement, the segment that was tail moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> But when eating, we add a new segment at the old tail position before the move.\n> \n> Before any move, tail is at P.\n> \n> Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> Then each body segment moves to the position of the segment in front.\n> \n> So the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1 or something.\n> \n> Positions before move turn 28: head (3,1), seg1 (4,1), seg2 (4,2), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (5,3), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (6,2), seg7 (6,1)  // seg7 is tail.\n> \n> Head moves to (2,1).\n> \n> Then:\n> \n> - New head: (2,1)\n> \n> - New seg1: old head position (3,1)\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 position (4,1)\n> \n> - New seg3: old seg2 position (4,2)\n> \n> - New seg4: old seg3 position (4,3)\n> \n> - New seg5: old seg4 position (5,3)\n> \n> - New seg6: old seg5 position (6,3)\n> \n> - New seg7: old seg6 position (6,2)\n> \n> - Now, the old seg7 (tail at (6,1)) is not moved to; instead, since eating, a new segment is added at old seg7 position (6,1), so new seg8 at (6,1)\n> \n> And this is the new tail.\n> \n> So occupied cells: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So after eating both (3,1) and (2,1), snake is at (2,1) to (6,1) and (6,2), (6,3), etc.\n> \n> Now, back to the sequence.\n> \n> At turn 25: from (4,3), go D to (4,2)\n> \n> Turn 26: from (4,2), go D to (4,1)  // no eat\n> \n> Turn 27: from (4,1), go L to (3,1) to eat (3,1)  // snake grows to 8\n> \n> Turn 28: from (3,1), go L to (2,1) to eat (2,1)  // snake grows to 9\n> \n> Now, turn 29: head at (2,1), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> From (2,1), possible moves:\n> \n> U to (2,2) - is it free?

It's turn 26, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (4,2), then (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). So the snake has 7 segments. The head is at (4,2) and it's moving down, which is direction D. Moving down means increasing y, so from (4,2) to (4,3) would be moving down? No, let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is the bottom or top? The movement is defined as U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), so U increases y, D decreases y. That means y=0 is the bottom, and y=7 is the top, I assume. But in the snake positions, head is at (4,2), moving D, which is down, so to (x,y-1). But in the positions, from head (4,2) to next segment (4,3), that would be increasing y, which should be up if U is (x,y+1). Inconsistency here.\n> \n> Let's read the positions: Snake Positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]\n> \n> Head is at (4,2), and the next segment is (4,3). Since moving from (4,2) to (4,3) means y increased by 1, so that should be moving up, not down. But the head direction is given as D, which is down.\n> \n> Direction D means (x,y-1), so moving down should decrease y. But here, from previous position, it must have come from somewhere. The head direction is the current moving direction. So if head is at (4,2) and direction is D, that means it just moved to (4,2) from (4,3) or something? Let's think.\n> \n> The positions list is from head to tail. So head is at (4,2), then (4,3), so the head moved from (4,3) to (4,2)? But (4,3) to (4,2) is decreasing y, which is down, so yes, moving D to (4,2).\n> \n> Similarly, before that, it was at (4,3) coming from (5,3)? Positions: index 0: (4,2) head, index 1: (4,3), index 2: (5,3), index 3: (6,3), index 4: (6,2), index 5: (6,1), index 6: (5,1) tail.\n> \n> So, the head moved to (4,2) from (4,3) by moving down (decreasing y). Then the segment at (4,3) was previously occupied, and so on.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,2), direction D (down, so y-1).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (3,1,3,1) — I think this is (x,y,life_span,value), so (3,1) with life_span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,5,6,1) — (4,5) life_span 6, value 1\n> \n> - (2,1,9,1) — (2,1) life_span 9, value 1\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life_span: for (3,1) it's 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life_span decreases every turn, including current, so if life_span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it has N turns left including this one.\n> \n> For (3,1), life_span=3, so it will disappear after turn 28? Let's see: current turn is 26. Life_span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 26, life_span=3, after turn 26 it becomes 2, after turn 27 it becomes 1, after turn 28 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 26, 27, or 28.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) life_span=6, disappears after turn 31.\n> \n> (2,1) life_span=9, disappears after turn 34.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can't go there.

Current is D, so opposite is U. So I can move L, R, or D again? No instant reverse, meaning I cannot move opposite to the current direction on the next turn.\n> \n> So from current direction D, I can move D (down again), L (left), or R (right), but not U (up).\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are around (4,2):\n> \n> - Up: (4,3) — but that's occupied by the snake body, segment at index 1.

The snake moves: head to new position, each segment follows, so tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment, which is (6,1), I think.\n> \n> After move: head to (4,1), then body segments: the old head (4,2) becomes new neck, then (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), and tail (5,1) is removed?

Since we ate, we add a new segment at the tail position, so tail stays at (6,1), and a new segment is added where the tail was, but since tail moves only if no eat, when eat, tail doesn't move, so we add a new segment at the previous tail position.\n> \n> Standard snake: when eat, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays, and the body extends.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move to food, positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ]\n> \n> Move head to (3,1), eat food, so new head (3,1), then the segments: (4,1) becomes part of body, and we add a new segment at the end, so positions become: [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ] — and since we ate, we add a new segment at (6,1), so now tail is at (6,1), and the new segment is at (6,1), but (6,1) was already there, so we add an extra segment.\n> \n> Let's think: after move without eat, positions shift, tail removed.

No.\n> \n> Typically: the snake moves to new head, each segment moves to previous position, but when eating, the tail segment does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard way: when snake moves and eats, the head moves to the new cell (food), and the tail does not move, so the body extends by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions: after move and eat, the head is at the new position, the body segments are the previous positions including the old head, and the tail remains where it was, so the length increases by one.\n> \n> For example, before move: positions: P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n> \n> Move to new cell N, eat food: new positions: N (new head), P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk (now tail)\n> \n> So the tail is still Pk, but it's no longer the tail; the segment that was tail is now part of body, and the tail is still at Pk, but since we add a segment, Pk becomes the second last, and a new tail is added? No.\n> \n> After eating: the head moves to N, then the first body segment moves to P0, second to P1, and so on, up to the tail which was at Pk, it moves to the previous position of the segment before it, but since we eat, the tail doesn't move; it stays, so the position Pk is occupied, and a new segment is added at Pk? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have it: in snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not retract that turn, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So the new positions are: new head at food, then the old head, then the rest of the body, and the tail remains, so the list has one more element.\n> \n> From [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with P0 head, Pk tail.\n> \n> After moving to N and eating: new positions [N, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] so now length k+2 segments? No.\n> \n> [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] has k+1 segments.\n> \n> After move to N without eat: [N, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}] so Pk removed, length k.\n> \n> With eat: [N, P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] so all old positions plus new head, so length k+2? No.\n> \n> Example: snake with 3 segments: head A, body B, tail C.\n> \n> Move to new cell D, eat: new head D, then A, then B, then C, so positions D,A,B,C — 4 segments.\n> \n> Yes, so tail C is still there.\n> \n> In this case, before move: positions [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ] 7 segments.\n> \n> Move to (3,1) and eat: new positions [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ] 8 segments, tail at (6,1).\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,1) on turn 26.\n> \n> Then on turn 27, from (4,1), I can move L to (3,1) to eat the food.\n> \n> Is there any danger?

but from (2,1) to (4,5) requires at least |2-4| + |1-5| = 2+4=6 moves, so on turn 34 I can reach, but on turn 31, I can be at best at (4,4) or something, not (4,5).\n> \n> For example, turn 28: (2,1),

immediately to secure +1 score, followed by the adjacent food at (2,1) for another +1, as both are positive and time-sensitive. This path avoids the deadly dead-end on the right (e.g., moving to (5,2) leads to unavoidable collisions) and ensures long-term survival by escaping the bottom-left corner via upward movement to open space after eating.\n",

It's turn 27, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). So the snake is 7 segments long. The head direction is down, which means it's moving towards decreasing y, I assume, since y=0 is the bottom? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but in this context, let's confirm.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), which probably means y increases upwards, so U is up. D is (x,y-1), so down decreases y. L is (x-1,y), left, R is (x+1,y), right.\n> \n> Snake head direction is D, down, so it's moving down, meaning towards lower y values.\n> \n> Current head at (4,1). Since direction is D, last move was down to (4,1), so previous head was at (4,0)? But y=0 is the border, so let's see positions: from (4,1) to (4,2) to (4,3), etc. Positions are listed head first: (4,1) is head, then (4,2), (4,3), etc. But if head is at (4,1) and moving down, that would be to (4,0), but y=0 is a wall, so it can't be moving down into a wall. Head direction is D, down, but current position is (4,1), and moving down would be to (4,0), but (4,0) is a border wall, so that would be a collision. But the snake is alive, so it must have come from somewhere.\n> \n> Let's list the positions in order: head (4,1), then body (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). Tail is (6,1).\n> \n> Since head is at (4,1) and next is (4,2), which is above it? y=2 is greater than y=1, so if y increases up, (4,2) is north of (4,1). But head direction is D, down, which is decreasing y. Contradiction.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed with head first, so the snake was moving from (4,2) to (4,1), which is down, decreasing y. Yes, that makes sense. So from (4,2) to (4,1) is down. Then the body segments: after head (4,1), the next is (4,2), which was the previous head position, then (4,3), (5,3), etc.\n> \n> So the snake is currently at (4,1), having moved down from (4,2). Direction is D, so it can move U, L, or R, but not D again? No, it can move in any direction except instant reverse. Instant reverse means it cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is D, so it cannot move U (up) immediately, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So current direction is D (down), so on this turn, I cannot move U (up), because that would be reverse. I can move D (down), L (left), or R (right), but moving D to (4,0) is a wall, since y=0 is border wall.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.

Collision is if head touches body, but after move, the body segments are at (4,1), (4,2), etc., so (3,1) not touching any body except (4,1) is adjacent, but not same cell, so no collision.

Let's see: after moving right to (5,1), the snake positions: head at (5,1), then the first body segment is previous head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), and the last segment (6,1) is gone, so positions: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2)] — 7 segments still.\n> \n> Now, from (5,1), I can move U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But direction now R (right), since I moved right.\n> \n> Cannot instant reverse to L.\n> \n> Now U to (5,2), D to (5,0) wall, L to (4,1) but (4,1) is now body?

Since (4,5) is unreachable before its expiration (life span 4, gone after turn 31), the sequence prioritizes reaching (1,5) efficiently by moving left to (1,1) and then upward, minimizing risk by staying clear of the body and leveraging the long life span of (1,5).\n",

(1,1) on turn 29, the body includes (4,2), (4,3), etc., but when I move, the tail moves, so cells free up.\n> \n> But let's see if there is a collision risk.\n> \n> For example, when I am at (1,2) on turn 30, the body has (2,1), (3,1), etc., but I am at (1,2), not touching.\n> \n> Similarly, all fine.\n> \n> But I recall the special case: food can spawn under body, but here (1,5) is not under body, so no issue.\n> \n> Perhaps for long-term, moving up to (2,2) allows me to have more options on turn 30.\n> \n> For instance, on turn 30, from (2,2), I can choose to go up to (2,3) or left to (1,2).\n> \n> If I go up to (2,3), I can explore the top, but (1,5) is at left, so I might delay eating, but since life span long, I can eat later.\n> \n> But to maximize score, I should eat as soon

It's turn 30, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,2), then body segments: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2). So the snake is 9 segments long. Head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to get to (2,2) from (2,1)? Let's see: from (2,1) to (2,2) is Up, yes. But the direction given is the current head direction, so it's facing Up.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1 and life span 2. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 2 more turns? Life span is given as 2 at turn 30, so after this turn (turn 30), it decreases to 1, then after turn 31, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 30 or 31.\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 1 and life span 8. Value 1 is positive food, since value 1 is +1, and it says \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1\", and \"Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1\". Both foods here have value 1, so both are positive. Value is 1 for both, so +1 each.\n> \n> Life span for (1,5) is 8, so it will last until turn 30 + 8 - 1 or something?

It says \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn t, life span is L, and after the turn, it becomes L-1. If L=1, it disappears after the turn.\n> \n> For (4,5): life span 2 at turn 30. So:\n> \n> - Turn 30: life span 2, can be eaten.

Let's see what's at (2,3). From snake positions, (2,3) is not occupied, and not a wall.\n> \n> - Down: (2,1) – this is occupied by body segment, but it's the segment that was just behind the head. Since the snake moves, if we move down to (2,1), that cell will be occupied by the head, and the body will shift, so the tail moves away. Specifically, (2,1) is the first body segment, so after moving down, head goes to (2,1), and the tail (6,2) will move to where? When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front. So if head moves to (2,1), which is currently occupied by segment 1, then segment 1 will move to where segment 2 is? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the neck (first body segment) moves to the old head position, and so on, tail moves to the position of the second last segment or something. Actually, the entire body shifts forward; the last segment (tail) is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> But in this case, since we're just moving, not eating yet.\n> \n> If no food eaten, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail is left.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - Current positions: head at (2,2), segments: (2,1), (3,1), etc.\n> \n> If head moves to (2,3), then new positions: head at (2,3), then body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) – and tail (6,2) is gone? No.\n> \n> Snake segments: index 0: head (2,2), index 1: (2,1), index 2: (3,1), index 3: (4,1), index 4: (4,2), index 5: (4,3), index 6: (5,3), index 7: (6,3), index 8: (6,2) tail.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - If head moves to new cell, say (x,y), then new head is (x,y), new segment 1 is old head position (2,2), new segment 2 is old segment 1 position (2,1), and so on, down to new segment 8 is old segment 7 position (6,3), and old tail (6,2) is abandoned, so snake shortens by one? No, if no food eaten, the snake doesn't grow, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Standard: when moving without eating, the head moves to new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the segment before it, so the last segment (tail) is removed, meaning the snake moves forward, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> So positions: after moving head to (2,3), new positions: head (2,3), then body: (2,2) [old head], (2,1) [old seg1], (3,1) [old seg2], (4,1) [old seg3], (4,2) [old seg4], (4,3) [old seg5], (5,3) [old seg6], (6,3) [old seg7] – and old seg8 (6,2) is no longer part of snake, so (6,2) is free now.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves to (2,1), which is currently occupied by segment 1. But when head moves to (2,1), since (2,1) is where segment 1 is, but segment 1 will move to the old head position (2,2), so it's okay, no collision, because the cell is vacated by the body segment moving away.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But here, (2,1) is not the tail, it's the neck.\n> \n> General rule: moving to a cell that will be vacated by the body is safe, as long as it's not a permanent body cell except tail.\n> \n> In snake, when you move, the only body cell that might be occupied but is safe to move to is the tail cell, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> For other body cells, if you move to them, it might be a collision if they don't move away in time, but in the immediate move, if you move to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it will cause collision because that segment is still there when head arrives? No.\n> \n> Let's clarify the collision rule.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to any cell that has a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail segment, because the tail moves away when the snake moves.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,1), it is a body segment, but not the tail. The tail is at (6,2).\n> \n> If I move down to (2,1), that cell is occupied by segment 1, so head would be moving to a body-occupied cell, which is not the tail, so it should be a collision.\n> \n> But according to the movement, when head moves to (2,1), at the same time, segment 1 moves to (2,2), so (2,1) is vacated, and head is at (2,1), so no collision? I think there's a timing issue.\n> \n> I need to interpret the rule strictly.\n> \n> The rule says: \"head touches any body segment\" – so if the head moves to a cell that has a body segment at that moment, it collides.\n> \n> But when the snake moves, all segments update simultaneously.\n> \n> Typically in snake games, the head moves first to the new cell, then the body segments shift. If the new head position was occupied by a body segment (except the tail), it collides because that segment hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> But if it's the tail, since the tail will move, it's okay.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,1), it's not the tail; it's the first body segment.\n> \n> So moving to (2,1) should cause a collision because segment 1 is there when the head moves.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any other body cell would be collision.\n> \n> Only moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Also, moving to free cells or food cells is fine.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - Up: (2,3) – what is here? Not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. (3,2) is obstacle, but (2,3) is different. x=2,y=3.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,3) is within bounds, not border. Internal obstacle only at (3,2), so (2,3) is free. Probably safe.\n> \n> - Down: (2,1) – this is occupied by body segment 1, not tail, so moving here should cause collision. Not safe.\n> \n> - Left: (1,2) – x=1,y=2. Is this wall? Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 is not border. y=2 not border. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not here. Snake positions: is (1,2) occupied? Snake: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), etc., no (1,2), so free. Safe.\n> \n> - Right: (3,2) – but (3,2) is an internal obstacle! Given: Internal Obstacles: [(3,2)], so it's a wall, cannot move there.

Old tail was (6,3), but when head moves to (3,3), seg1 moves to (2,3), seg2 to (2,2), ..., seg8 to old seg7 (5,3), so tail now at (5,3), and (6,3) free.\n> \n> But back to food: if I'm at (3,3) on turn 31, I can move to (3,4) or (4,3) or (2,3) etc.\n> \n> (4,5) is at (4,5), which is two moves away from (3,3): e.g., to (4,4) then (4,5), or to (3,4) then (4,4) then (4,5), etc.\n> \n> But from (3,3) to (4,5) directly not adjacent.\n> \n> To reach (4,5) on turn 31, I need to be at (4,5) or adjacent on turn 31 move.\n> \n> But on turn 31, if I start from (2,3) after turn 30, the closest I can get to (4,5) is, say, (3,4) or (4,4), but not (4,5).\n> \n> From (2,3) on turn 31, I can move to (3,3) as above, then from there on turn 32 to (3,4), then turn 33 to (4,4), turn 34 to (4,5).

Let me confirm the grid size.\n> \n> The border cells are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so x from 0 to 7 inclusive, but walls are at those coordinates, so the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6? No, let's see: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. So the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), which is 6x6, but let's list the coordinates.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7: 0 and 7 are walls, so x=1,2,3,4,5,6 are playable? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive. Similarly for y: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive. So playable area is (1,1) to (6,6), that's 6x6 cells.\n> \n> But there's an internal obstacle at (3,2). So that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,2), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So the snake has 9 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Current turn t=31.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1, life_span 1. So it disappears after this turn or next? Life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 31, life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Since we're at turn 31, and it has life_span 1, after turn 31, it will be gone. So if not eaten on turn 31, it disappears.\n> \n> Life_span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the start of turn 31, life_span is 1. After the snake moves and eats or not, at the end of the turn, life_span decreases to 0, and since N=1, it disappears after this turn. So to eat it, must move to (4,5) on this turn.\n> \n> But the snake head is at (1,2), which is far, so impossible to reach (4,5) in one move. So this food will disappear after turn 31, uneaten.\n> \n> Next food: (1,5) value 1, life_span 7. So it will disappear after turn 31+7=38? Life_span 7 at turn 31, so after 7 more turns, it disappears. Countdown decreases each turn, so after turn 31, life_span becomes 6, then 5, ..., down to 0 after turn 37, disappears after turn 37? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If at turn t, life_span is N, then after N turns, it disappears. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life_span=N, after turn t, it becomes N-1; after turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t+(N-1), it becomes 1, after turn t+N, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (1,5): life_span=7 at turn 31. After turn 31, life_span=6; after turn 32, life_span=5; ... after turn 37, life_span=0, disappears after turn 37. So it can be eaten from turn 31 to 37 inclusive? At turn t, if snake moves to food cell, it eats it before life_span decrease. So as long as life_span >=1 at the start of the turn, it can be eaten that turn.\n> \n> At start of turn t, if life_span >=1, food is present; snake can eat it by moving to that cell during turn t; then at end of turn, life_span decreases.\n> \n> So for (1,5), life_span=7 at turn 31, so present from turn 31 to 37, disappears after turn 37 (i.e., not present at turn 38).\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) value 1, life_span=10, so present from turn 31 to 40, disappears after turn 40.\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (1,2), moving left (L), so direction is decreasing x.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is L, I cannot move right (R) immediately because of no instant reverse.

But food can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> Also, (1,3) is within bounds: x=1, y=3, both between 1 and 6, and no wall or obstacle? Obstacle is at (3,2), not (1,3).

Snake: (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), etc. (2,1) is at (2,1), not (1,1). (1,1) should be empty? Let's see: positions are (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So (1,1) is not occupied, and it's not wall, so valid move to (1,1).\n> \n> - L: to (0,2). But x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - R: to (2,2). But (2,2) is the second segment of the snake.

After eating, the new head is at (1,3), and the tail stays or moves? When snake eats, it grows, so after move, head moves to new position, if food, it is eaten, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail doesn't move that turn? Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to food, food is eaten, and tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> So when head moves to a cell with positive food, it eats it, the food is removed, and the snake grows, meaning that after the move, the tail does not move, so the new position is added, and tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> If no food, head moves, tail moves to next, length same.\n> \n> Here, if I move U to (1,3), I eat the food, so head now at (1,3), and the body: since I ate, tail doesn't move, so the snake becomes: head (1,3), then previous head (1,2) becomes first body, then (2,2), (2,1), etc., up to (6,3), and since I ate, no tail movement, so new segment is added? Let's think.\n> \n> Initially, snake positions: [ (1,2) head, (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) tail ]\n> \n> After moving U to (1,3) and eating food: new head is at (1,3), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so the body includes the previous head and all segments. So positions become: [ (1,3) new head, (1,2) now body, (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) ] — 10 segments.\n> \n> (6,3) is still tail, but since no move, it stays.\n> \n> Then next turn, when I move, tail will move.\n> \n> If I move D to (1,1), no food, so head moves to (1,1), tail moves to the next position, so the last segment (6,3) is removed, and new positions: head (1,1), then (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3) — tail is (5,3), since (6,3) removed.\n> \n> Now, back to choices.\n> \n> If I move U, I eat (1,3) immediately, get +1 score, and grow.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. There is also (1,5) food with life_span 7, so I have until turn 37 to eat it.\n> \n> After moving U, head is at (1,3), and direction would be U, since I moved up.\n> \n> Then from there, I can move to (1,4), or (2,3), etc.\n> \n> But let's consider the risks.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (6,3), far away, not adjacent to head.

(1,1) is corner, but y=1, D to (1,0) wall, U to (1,2) body, L to (0,1) wall, R to (2,1) which is body segment.\n> \n> (2,1) is in the body, so moving there causes collision.\n> \n> So from (1,1), no valid moves?

It's turn 32. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at those coordinates, meaning the snake can't go there. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,3), then body segments: (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is Up, which is consistent with moving from (1,2) to (1,3) since y increases going up.\n> \n> Food: only one piece at (1,5) with value 1 and life span 7. So it's positive food, worth +1, and it will disappear after 7 turns, including this one, so by turn 38 it might be gone if not eaten.\n> \n> I need to plan 5 turns ahead, from turn 32 to at least turn 37. Actions should be for turns 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, etc., but since we're thinking 5+ turns, I should consider up to turn 37 or more.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at all border cells: (0,y) for y=0 to7, (7,y) for y=0 to7, (x,0) for x=0 to7, (x,7) for x=0 to7. But since it's borders, cells like (0,1) etc. are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Body: (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly in the bottom-left area, with the head at (1,3), and tail at (6,3).\n> \n> Head direction is U, so last move was up to (1,3).\n> \n> Available moves from current head position (1,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (1,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (1,2), but (1,2) is occupied by the body. However, since the snake will move, when we move, the tail moves, so we can potentially move to a cell that was just vacated by the tail, but we need to check.\n> \n> Movement rules: head moves to a new cell, and if it eats food, a new segment is added at the tail, else tail moves forward.\n> \n> But collision: head cannot touch any body segment except the tail, because when we move, the tail moves, so if head moves to where tail is, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But in this case, from (1,3), moving down to (1,2): (1,2) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (6,3). So (1,2) is a body segment, not tail. Moving to (1,2) would cause collision because head touches body.\n> \n> Let's list the snake segments in order:\n> \n> Index 0: head (1,3)\n> \n> Index 1: (1,2)\n> \n> Index 2: (2,2)\n> \n> Index 3: (2,1)\n> \n> Index 4: (3,1)\n> \n> Index 5: (4,1)\n> \n> Index 6: (4,2)\n> \n> Index 7: (4,3)\n> \n> Index 8: (5,3)\n> \n> Index 9: tail (6,3)\n> \n> So from head (1,3), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (1,4)\n> \n> - Down: (1,2) - occupied by segment 1, which is body, not tail. So if head moves to (1,2), it would collide with segment 1 before movement. After movement, the head moves to new position, and tail moves only if no food eaten. But collision is checked when head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail cell.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell occupied by tail is allowed only if that cell is the tail and it will move. But if occupied by non-tail body, collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from (1,3):\n> \n> - U: (1,4) - possible, if not wall or obstacle.\n> \n> - D: (1,2) - occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision. Invalid.\n> \n> - L: (0,3) - x=0 is wall, since border cells are walls. So invalid.\n> \n> - R: (2,3) - is this free? Let's see current snake positions: (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). (2,3) is not listed, so it should be empty. Also, no wall at (2,3), walls are at borders and (3,2) obstacle.\n> \n> (3,2) is obstacle, but (2,3) is fine.\n> \n> So possible moves from (1,3): Up to (1,4) or Right to (2,3).\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current head direction is U, so opposite is D, which is invalid anyway, so no issue.\n> \n> So choices: U or R.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,5) with value 1, life span 7. Since current turn 32, it disappears after 7 turns, so last chance to eat is turn 38? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 32, life span 7, meaning it will be there for 7 more turns: turns 32,33,34,35,36,37,38. After turn 38, it disappears, so not available on turn 39.\n> \n> Life span: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, with life span N, it will be present for N turns, from t to t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N.\n> \n> At turn 32, life span 7, so available on turns 32,33,34,35,36,37,38. Gone on turn 39.\n> \n> We have time to reach it.\n> \n> (1,5) is two cells above the head at (1,3), so if we move up twice, we can be at (1,5) on turn 33? Let's see.\n> \n> If turn 32: move U to (1,4)\n> \n> Then turn 33: move U to (1,5), which is the food.\n> \n> But we need to consider if that is safe.\n> \n> First, on turn 32, if we move U to (1,4), is that safe?\n> \n> (1,4): is it occupied? Current snake positions: all below y=3 except (1,3) is head, but (1,4) not listed, so free. Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, but (1,4) is within bounds, x=1,y=4, not border. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not here. So (1,4) should be free.\n> \n> After moving to (1,4), snake positions: new head at (1,4), then old head (1,3) becomes body, and so on, tail moves away if no food eaten.\n> \n> No food at (1,4), so no eating, tail moves. Tail was (6,3), so after move, snake becomes: head (1,4), body: (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3). Tail (6,3) is removed since no growth.\n> \n> Then on turn 33, from (1,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (1,5) - food is there.\n> \n> - D: to (1,3) - but (1,3) is now body segment (after turn 32 move), so occupied, collision if move down.\n> \n> - L: (0,4) wall, invalid.\n> \n> - R: (2,4) - should be free, no snake or wall.\n> \n> Also, head direction now U (since we moved up).\n> \n> Moving to (1,5) would eat the food, since head moves there.\n> \n> But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> It says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, when we eat at (1,5), the tail is not adjacent; tail is at (5,3) after turn 32 move, which is not adjacent to (1,5).\n> \n> (1,5) and (5,3) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so (1,5) and (1,4) adjacent, but (1,5) and (5,3) not.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so new tail added, positions: head at (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), etc., down to (5,3), and new segment at tail, so length 11.\n> \n> But we need to think longer term.\n> \n> Is this the best move?

So it's positive food.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? Let's confirm: walls are at x=0 and x=7, so columns 1 to 6 are playable. Similarly, y=0 and y=7, so rows 1 to 6. But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so rows from 1 to 6 inclusive? Let's think: if y=0 and y=7 are walls, then the grid has y from 1 to 6. Similarly for x.\n> \n> In the snake positions, we have y=4,3,2,1, so y=1 is playable, not a wall. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so playable y: 1 to 6. Similarly x: 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), which is within the grid.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,5), which is above the snake's head. Snake head is at (1,4), moving up, so (1,5) is directly above.\n> \n> Life span of food is 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 33, life span 6, it will disappear after turn 38? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, life span N, it will be there for N turns, from turn t to turn t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N.\n> \n> At turn 33, life span 6, so it exists from turn 33 to turn 38 (since 33 to 38 is 6 turns: 33,34,35,36,37,38), and gone at turn 39.\n> \n> But we need to think about when it can be eaten.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 33.\n> \n> Current head position: (1,4)\n> \n> Current direction: U (up)\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But I cannot do an instant reverse. Since current direction is U, reverse is D, so I cannot move down immediately. So possible moves: U, L, R. (Up, Left, Right)\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move does:\n> \n> - If I move U (up) to (1,5): that's where the food is. But I need to check if I can eat it safely.\n> \n> Food is at (1,5), and it's positive food, value +1, so eating it would increase length by 1.\n> \n> But there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because of collision.\n> \n> First, what is the tail? Snake positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)] so tail is at (5,3).\n> \n> Head is at (1,4), tail at (5,3). Are they adjacent? Let's see the positions: (1,4) and (5,3) – not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so same x, y differs by 1, or same y, x differs by 1.\n> \n> (1,4) to (5,3): x diff 4, y diff 1, not adjacent. So no immediate danger from that rule.\n> \n> But when I eat food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so if I move to (1,5) and eat the food, the snake grows, so the new tail will be... let's think.\n> \n> Normally, when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added where the tail was, but the tail doesn't move that turn. So the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> In this case, if I move up to (1,5), which has food, I eat it. Then the new positions: head at (1,5), and the body segments: the previous head (1,4) becomes the first body segment, and so on, down to the tail (5,3). But since I ate food, the tail stays in place, so a new segment is added at (5,3)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail moves forward one cell. When food eaten, head moves to food, tail does not move, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous positions except the tail is not removed.\n> \n> Here: after eating, positions would be: head at (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3) — but since I ate, the tail (5,3) stays, and I add a new segment? No, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail remains, and the new head is added.\n> \n> Snake was 10 segments: indices 0 to 9: 0: head (1,4), 1: (1,3), 2: (1,2), 3: (2,2), 4: (2,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,3), 9: tail (5,3)\n> \n> After moving up and eating food: head moves to (1,5), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so positions become: head (1,5), segment 1: (1,4), segment 2: (1,3), ..., segment 9: (5,3), and a new segment added at the previous tail position? No, in standard snake, when you eat, the tail stays, meaning the segment that was the tail remains, and the head moves to new cell, so the snake gains one cell.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3) ] — so 11 segments, tail still at (5,3).\n> \n> Now, is there a collision? Head at (1,5), body segments: (1,4) is directly below, (1,3) etc., but (1,5) is not occupied by any other segment except itself, which is fine. And walls: (1,5) is within bounds? y=5, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=5 is fine, x=1 fine.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,2), not relevant here.\n> \n> So moving up to (1,5) seems safe and I get the food.\n> \n> But let's think about the tail reward danger rule. The rule says: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Here, head is at (1,4), tail at (5,3), not adjacent. After eating, head at (1,5), tail at (5,3), still not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Moreover, the food is at (1,5), not on the tail.\n> \n> So eating it should be fine.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. The food has life span 6, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear, or I can eat it later, but I should eat it since it's positive and available.\n> \n> Life span 6 from turn 33, so it will be there until turn 38, I can eat it later.\n> \n> But why not eat it now?\n> \n> However, I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, after eating, the snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver, but in this case, the grid has space.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (1,4)\n> \n> - Body: (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)\n> \n> So let's list cells:\n> \n> Row y=6: empty except possibly food?

move R to (2,5) instead of U.\n> \n> Turn 34: move R to (2,5), no food (since food at (1,5) eaten), so head to (2,5), body: (1,5), (1,4), etc., tail moves.\n> \n> Positions: head (2,5), body: (1,5),

(4,5) or U to (3,6), etc.\n> \n> (4,5) is free, and not near body.\n> \n> So the snake can move to the right side.\n> \n> If I didn't eat at turn 33, and moved R to (2,4), then I can still eat later.\n> \n> But by not eating now, I delay growing, but I can eat later with the same effect, except the life span decreases.\n> \n> But since I can eat by turn 35, it's fine.\n> \n> However, in both cases, I eat the food within 2 turns.\n> \n> But if I eat at turn 33, I get the score earlier, but for survival, it might not matter.\n> \n> The score is based on eating, so eating at turn 33 or 35 both give +1, but at different times.\n> \n> But for long-term, I need to survive to eat more, but here no more food mentioned, so perhaps after eating, I just need to survive as long as possible, but the score is from eating food, so if no more food, score doesn't increase, but I should avoid death.\n> \n> The goal is to maximize score, so I need to eat food when available.\n> \n> Since only one food, I must eat it to have score 1, else 0.\n> \n> But I can eat it later.\n> \n> But to have a score, I need to eat it before it disappears.\n> \n> So I should eat it within the life span.\n> \n> Now, at turn 33, moving up to eat is straightforward.\n> \n> If I move right, I can eat at turn 35.\n> \n> But moving right at turn 33 might be safer for long-term because I'm not going into the corner.\n> \n> For example, if I move U to (1,5) at turn 33, I'm at top-left, then I have to move out, which might be tight with the long snake.\n> \n> If I move R to (2,4) at turn 33, I'm more central, then I can move to (2,5) and eat at (1,5) at turn 35.\n> \n> From (2,4), turn 34 move U to (2,5), then turn 35 move L to (1,5) to eat.\n> \n> After eating, I'm at (1,5) with the snake body

But life span is given as 10, and it decreases every turn, including current turn? The food is at (4,1), value 1, life span 10.\n> \n> Food position: (4,1), value 1, life span 10.\n> \n> Now, let's look at the snake positions: the head is at (1,5), and food is at (4,1). Also, from the snake positions, (4,1) is occupied by the snake! Snake positions: ... (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3). So (4,1) is the 8th segment? Let's index them:\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (1,5), 1: (1,4), 2: (1,3), 3: (1,2), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (4,2), 9: (4,3), 10: tail (5,3)\n> \n> So (4,1) is occupied by the snake's body segment at index 7.\n> \n> Now, food is at (4,1), which is exactly where that body segment is. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, food is under the body at (4,1). Since it's under the body, the snake can't eat it immediately. The head is at (1,5), which is far away.\n> \n> Life span of food is 10, meaning it will disappear after 10 turns, including the current turn? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn 34, life span is 10, so after turn 34, it becomes 9, then 8, ..., and disappears when life span reaches 0? Or after N turns from spawn.\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life_span is 10 on turn 34, that means it will be gone after turn 34 + 10 = 44? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think this means it exists for N turns, including the turn it spawns or from when it's counted. But the countdown decreases every turn, including current, so if on turn t it has life_span L, on turn t+1 it has L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before the turn or after?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on the turn it is present, the countdown decreases by one each turn, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before the next turn.\n> \n> But for simplicity, if on turn t, life_span is L, then it will last for L more turns, disappearing after turn t + L - 1 or something? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose food spawns on turn S with life_span N. On turn S, life_span is N. On turn S+1, it becomes N-1, ..., on turn S + N - 1, it becomes 1, and on turn S + N, it becomes 0 and disappears before turn S + N + 1? The rule doesn't specify exactly when it disappears relative to the turn.\n> \n> But in this case, for the food at (4,1), on turn 34, life_span is 10. So it will decrease to 9 on turn 35, 8 on turn 36, ..., down to 0 on turn 44. And it disappears after turn 44, meaning it's not there on turn 45. So it can be eaten from turn 34 to turn 44 inclusive? On turn 44, life_span is 0, but it might still be present until the end of the turn.\n> \n> To be safe, I think we can assume that as long as life_span > 0, the food is present and can be eaten. On the turn when life_span becomes 0, it disappears and cannot be eaten. So for life_span 10 on turn 34, it can be eaten from turn 34 to turn 43 (since on turn 43, life_span=1, then on turn 44 it becomes 0 and disappears).\n> \n> Turn 34: life_span=10\n> \n> Turn 35: life_span=9\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 43: life_span=1\n> \n> Turn 44: life_span=0, food disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turns 34 to 43 inclusive.\n> \n> But currently, on turn 34, the food is under the snake's body at (4,1), so it can't be eaten until the body moves away.\n> \n> Now, the snake's body: (4,1) is the 7th segment. The head is at (1,5), moving up.\n> \n> First, I need to plan moves for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Available actions: U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction. Current head direction is U (up), so cannot move down (D) on next turn.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (1,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): but cannot, because opposite direction.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (0,5), but x=0 is a wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (2,5)\n> \n> So from (1,5), possible moves: U to (1,6) or R to (2,5). D and L are invalid or not allowed.\n> \n> L to (0,5) is wall, so death. D is opposite direction, not allowed. So only U or R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid state.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, walls at borders and internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)\n> \n> Food at (4,1) under body.\n> \n> I need to think about getting to the food. But food is at (4,1), which is occupied, so I need to move the snake so that the body moves away from (4,1), and then head can move there.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, each turn the tail moves forward, so segments shift.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the segment that was at (4,1) might move if it's not the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,3). (4,1) is the 7th segment, so when snake moves, that segment will move to where the previous segment was, but since it's a body segment, it follows the path.\n> \n> After one move, if head moves, say, up to (1,6), then new head is (1,6), and the tail (5,3) is removed? No, when snake moves without eating, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, and the tail is removed. So the snake shortens? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So in this case, snake has 11 segments. If no food eaten, after moving, head is at new position, segments 1 to 10 move to positions 0 to 9, and the old tail at position 10 is vacated.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (1,5), 1: (1,4), 2: (1,3), 3: (1,2), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (4,2), 9: (4,3), 10: (5,3)\n> \n> After move, if head moves to new cell, say (1,6) for U, then new positions: head at (1,6), then segment 1 at old head (1,5), segment 2 at old segment 1 (1,4), ..., segment 10 at old segment 9 (4,3), and the old tail (5,3) is vacated.\n> \n> The segment that was at (4,1) is now moved to where segment 6 was, which is (3,1)? Let's see: after move U to (1,6):\n> \n> - New head: (1,6)\n> \n> - Body: [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]  // this is new positions from old positions: new body segment 1 is old head (1,5), segment 2 is old segment 1 (1,4), ..., segment 10 is old segment 9 (4,3). Old segment 10 (5,3) is removed.\n> \n> So the cell (4,1) was occupied by old segment 7, but after move, new segment 8 is at (4,1)? New positions:\n> \n> - Head: (1,6)\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head (1,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old segment 1 (1,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old segment 2 (1,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: old segment 3 (1,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: old segment 4 (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6: old segment 5 (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 7: old segment 6 (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 8: old segment 7 (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 9: old segment 8 (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 10: old segment 9 (4,3)\n> \n> And old segment 10 (5,3) is removed.\n> \n> So (4,1) is still occupied by new segment 8. It hasn't moved away; it's still there, just the index changed.\n> \n> The food is at (4,1), and it's still under the snake body.\n> \n> To free the food, I need the snake to move such that the segment at (4,1) moves away and no other segment is there, so that the cell is empty, then head can move to it.\n> \n> Since the snake moves step by step, the only way to vacate (4,1) is for the tail to be there or for the snake to move away from that area.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (5,3), not at (4,1). (4,1) is a body segment.\n> \n> As the snake moves, the body will move, but (4,1) might be occupied until the tail passes through it, but the tail is at (5,3), which is not adjacent, so it might take several moves.\n> \n> Let's see the path to the tail or to free (4,1).\n> \n> Also, there is an internal obstacle at (3,2), which is a wall, so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Now, the food has life span 10, so it will disappear after turn 43, as I thought earlier.\n> \n> Turn 34 to 43, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But to eat it, I need the head to be at (4,1) when the cell is empty.\n> \n> Currently, head at (1,5), food at (4,1), so I need to move towards that area.\n> \n> But there are walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, and (3,2) is wall.\n> \n> Snake: head (1,5), body down to (1,2), then to (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)\n> \n> From (1,2) to (2,2) is right, then (2,2) to (2,1) down, (2,1) to (3,1) right, (3,1) to (4,1) right, (4,1) to (4,2) up, (4,2) to (4,3) up, (4,3) to (5,3) right.\n> \n> Food at (4,1), under the body.\n> \n> To eat the food, I need to move the snake so that the segment at (4,1) moves away. Since it's not the tail, when the snake moves, that segment will move to where the previous segment was, but only if the head moves.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves up to (1,6), then as above, (4,1) is still occupied.\n> \n> If head moves right to (2,5), let's see what happens.\n> \n> If head moves R to (2,5), then new head (2,5), body: [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) ]  // similar to above, segment 8 at (4,1)\n> \n> Still occupied.\n> \n> To vacate (4,1), I need the tail to be at that position or the snake to move such that the body leaves that cell.\n> \n> The tail is at (5,3). When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so it will move to where segment 9 was, which is (4,3) if head moves, but let's see the sequence.\n> \n> After one move, tail is removed, so (5,3) is vacated, but (4,1) is still occupied.\n> \n> The cell (4,1) will be vacated only when the segment that is there moves away and no new segment comes, but since it's a body segment, it moves when the head moves.\n> \n> The position (4,1) will be empty when the segment that was there moves to a new position and the next segment doesn't come to it immediately.\n> \n> For example, in the current configuration, (4,1) is segment 7. When the head moves, segment 7 moves to where segment 6 was, which is (3,1), so (4,1) is vacated only if no other segment moves to it, but in this case, when segment 7 moves to (3,1), segment 8 moves to where segment 7 was, which is (4,1), so (4,1) is still occupied by segment 8 now.\n> \n> Similarly, it stays occupied until the tail passes through it.\n> \n> The tail is at (5,3). The path from tail to head: from (5,3) to (4,3) to (4,2) to (4,1) to (3,1) etc.\n> \n> (4,1) is part of the body. To vacate (4,1), I need the tail to be at (4,1), and when the snake moves, the tail moves away, vacating it.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (5,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), so to get the tail to (4,1), I need to move the snake so that the tail moves towards that position.\n> \n> Since the tail follows the path, I need to move the head in a way that the tail approaches (4,1).\n> \n> The distance from tail to (4,1) is: tail at (5,3), to (4,3), then (4,2), then (4,1), so it takes 3 moves for the tail to reach (4,1).\n> \n> Let's calculate.\n> \n> Current turn 34, tail at (5,3).\n> \n> After one move, say head moves, tail is removed, so new tail is old segment 9 at (4,3).\n> \n> After two moves, new tail is old segment 8 at (4,2)? Let's sequence.\n> \n> Turn 34: positions, tail at (5,3)\n> \n> After move on turn 34, new positions: head new, body shifts, tail (5,3) removed, new tail is the last body segment, which was at (4,3) for segment 10?

After second move, new positions: head new, 1: old head, 2: old 1, ..., 10: old 9.\n> \n> So after two moves, new tail is old segment 9, which was at (4,2) in the original, but after first move, positions changed.\n> \n> To vacate (4,1), it will happen when the segment that is at (4,1) moves and no new segment comes, which will be when that segment is the tail.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 34, (4,1) is segment 7, not tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (5,3). The path is (5,3) <- (4,3) <- (4,2) <- (4,1) <- (3,1) etc.\n> \n> So the segment at (4,1) is connected to (4,2) and (3,1).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the segment at (4,1) will move to where the previous segment was, which is (3,1), but only if the head moves in a way that the direction allows.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves, the segment at (4,1) will move to (3,1) if the snake is moving such that the body follows.\n> \n> But when it moves to (3,1), the cell (4,1) is vacated, but then the next segment, which was at (4,2), moves to (4,1), so (4,1) is immediately reoccupied.\n> \n> Unless the segment that was at (4,2) does not move to (4,1), but in this case, it does because the body is connected.\n> \n> The only way to vacate (4,1) is for the tail to be at (4,1) and then when the snake moves, the tail moves away, leaving it empty.\n> \n> So I need the tail to reach (4,1).\n> \n> Currently, tail at (5,3). After one move, tail moves to (4,3) if head moves in a certain way, but let's see the sequence.\n> \n> At turn 34, tail at (5,3)\n> \n> After one move (turn 35), the new tail is the segment that was at (4,3), which is position (4,3)\n> \n> After two moves (turn 36), new tail is the segment that was at (4,2), position (4,2)\n> \n> After three moves (turn 37), new tail is the segment that was at (4,1), position (4,1)\n> \n> Then on turn 37, tail is at (4,1)\n> \n> Then on turn 38, when the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail moves away from (4,1) to where the previous segment was, and (4,1) is vacated.\n> \n> At that point, the food at (4,1) can be eaten if the head moves there.\n> \n> But on turn 38, when the tail moves away, (4,1) is empty, and if head moves to (4,1), it can eat the food.\n> \n> But the head is far away.\n> \n> First, let's find out when the tail will be at (4,1).\n> \n> From above:\n> \n> - Turn 34: tail at (5,3)\n> \n> - After move on turn 34: new tail at (4,3)  // turn 35 state\n> \n> - After move on turn 35: new tail at (4,2)  // turn 36 state\n> \n> - After move on turn 36: new tail at (4,1)  // turn 37 state\n> \n> On turn 37, tail is at (4,1)\n> \n> Then on turn 38, when snake moves, the tail at (4,1) moves to where the previous segment was, which is (4,2)?

risks, such as walls and body collisions. By heading right and down, the snake positions itself to reach the food area by turn 38-40, when the food cell is vacated and still available (life span 10 on turn 34, so available until turn 43). Long-term survival is ensured by staying in open spaces and planning to eat the food safely after the tail moves away.\n",

It's turn 35. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,5), then body segments: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). So the snake has 11 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving to the right to reach (2,5) from previous position. Since head is at (2,5) and direction is R, it came from left, so previous head was at (1,5) or something? Snake positions list: head (2,5), then (1,5), which is left of head, so yes, moving right to (2,5).\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 9. Life span 9 means it will disappear after 9 turns, including this turn, so it has 9 turns left including turn 35.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n> \n> From the list: index 0: (2,5) head, index 1: (1,5), index 2: (1,4), index 3: (1,3), index 4: (1,2), index 5: (2,2), index 6: (2,1), index 7: (3,1), index 8: (4,1), index 9: (4,2), index 10: (4,3)\n> \n> Tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Now, food is at (4,1). But (4,1) is occupied by the snake! Index 8 is (4,1), which is part of the body. But food can spawn under the snake's body, and it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (4,1) has food, but it's also occupied by the snake segment at position index 8. So to eat it, that segment needs to move away, and then head must move to (4,1).\n> \n> But the head is at (2,5), which is far from (4,1). Also, life span is 9, so it has until turn 35+8=43 to be eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 35, life span 9, it will disappear after 9 turns, so last chance to eat is on turn 35 + 8 = 43? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it has L turns left including turn t. So it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear after turn t+L-1, so not present on turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, turn 35, life span 9: present on turns 35 to 43 (since 35 + 8 = 43, 9 turns: 35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43? That's 9 turns: from 35 to 43 inclusive is 43-35+1=9 turns.\n> \n> After turn 43, it disappears, so not there on turn 44.\n> \n> But we need to eat it by moving head onto it on or before turn 43.\n> \n> Now, head is at (2,5), food at (4,1). That's a distance of |2-4| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6 cells away in Manhattan distance. But with obstacles and snake body, it might take more turns.\n> \n> Also, snake is moving, so I need to plan a path.\n> \n> First, what are possible moves from current position (2,5) with head direction R.\n> \n> Current head direction is R (right), so I can move U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: no instant reverse, cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so cannot move left. Possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, let's check each:\n> \n> - U: (2,5+1) = (2,6)\n> \n> - D: (2,5-1) = (2,4)\n> \n> - R: (2+1,5) = (3,5)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - (2,6): is this a wall? y=6, border walls at y=7 and y=0, so y=6 is not wall, but let's see grid: y from 0 to 7, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is safe. x=2, not wall. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not here. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). None at (2,6), so safe.\n> \n> - (2,4): similarly, y=4, not wall. x=2. Occupied? Snake has (1,4) but that's different cell. (2,4) not in list, so safe.\n> \n> - (3,5): x=3, y=5. Not wall, not in snake positions, so safe.\n> \n> All three moves are possible immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for multiple turns to get to the food or other goals.\n> \n> The food at (4,1) is under the snake body at index 8, (4,1). To eat it, that segment must move away first.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (4,3), and the segment at (4,1) is not the tail; it's position index 8.\n> \n> The snake moves each turn: when it moves, the head goes to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so each segment moves to the next position.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail stays and snake grows.\n> \n> But in this case, since we might eat food, snake can grow.\n> \n> To free up (4,1), the segment currently there must move away. Since the snake moves step by step, the segment at (4,1) will move to where the next segment is or something.\n> \n> Let's think about the snake movement.\n> \n> At turn 35, positions: head (2,5), then body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) tail.\n> \n> If no food eaten, when snake moves, say to direction D, head moves to (2,4), then new positions: head (2,4), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) and tail (4,3) is removed? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts to the position of the segment ahead of it, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So from positions: seg0: (2,5), seg1: (1,5), seg2: (1,4), ..., seg10: (4,3)\n> \n> If head moves to new position, say new_head, then new positions: new_head, then seg0, seg1, ..., seg9. So seg10 (tail) is gone.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to (2,4), new positions: head (2,4), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) — so (4,3) is removed, and (4,1) is still there, but now it's seg9 or something.\n> \n> Previously (4,1) was seg8, but after move, seg8 is (4,1) becomes seg9 in new list? Let's index.\n> \n> After move to (2,4):\n> \n> - New head: (2,4) — was not occupied before\n> \n> - Then seg0 old: (2,5) becomes body seg1\n> \n> - seg1 old: (1,5) becomes body seg2\n> \n> - seg2 old: (1,4) becomes body seg3\n> \n> - seg3 old: (1,3) becomes body seg4\n> \n> - seg4 old: (1,2) becomes body seg5\n> \n> - seg5 old: (2,2) becomes body seg6\n> \n> - seg6 old: (2,1) becomes body seg7\n> \n> - seg7 old: (3,1) becomes body seg8\n> \n> - seg8 old: (4,1) becomes body seg9\n> \n> - seg9 old: (4,2) becomes body seg10\n> \n> - seg10 old: (4,3) is removed\n> \n> So now (4,1) is still occupied, by body seg9.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move in other directions, the body shifts, but (4,1) will be occupied until that segment moves further.\n> \n> The segment at (4,1) is currently the 9th segment from head? Head is seg0, so seg8 is (4,1), which is 8 positions from head.\n> \n> Since the snake has 11 segments, it will take 8 moves for that segment to become the tail and move away, but when it becomes the tail, it moves each turn, so to free (4,1), we need that segment to leave (4,1).\n> \n> Currently, seg8 is at (4,1). When the snake moves, if no growth, seg8 will move to the position of seg7, which is (3,1) at turn 35? Positions: seg7 is (3,1), seg8 is (4,1).\n> \n> After one move, say head moves somewhere, seg8 old moves to seg7 old position, which is (3,1), and new seg8 is at (3,1)? From above, after move to (2,4), old seg8 (4,1) becomes new seg9 at (4,1)? No.\n> \n> In the new positions, the cell (4,1) is now occupied by new seg9, which was old seg8.\n> \n> But the position (4,1) is still occupied after one move.\n> \n> In fact, to free (4,1), we need the segment that is there to move away, which will happen when that segment advances, but since the snake moves, that segment will only move when the segments before it move.\n> \n> Specifically, the segment at (4,1) will stay there until the snake moves enough times that this segment is no longer part of the body when it shifts.\n> \n> Since it's seg8, it will take 8 moves for this segment to become the tail. After 8 moves, if no growth, this segment will be the tail, and on the 9th move, when the tail moves, (4,1) will be free.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn 35, seg8 at (4,1)\n> \n> After one move (turn 36): seg8 moves to seg7's position, which is (3,1), so (4,1) is now occupied by the next segment, seg9 at (4,1)? No.\n> \n> After move, the positions shift: the head moves, each body segment takes the position of the previous segment, so the cell that was seg7 is now occupied by seg8, but seg7 was at (3,1), so after move, (3,1) is occupied by whatever was seg8, which was (4,1), but seg8 moves to (3,1), and (4,1) is now occupied by seg9, which was (4,2) at turn 35.\n> \n> Generally, for a cell to be freed, the segment on it must move off, which happens when the snake moves and that segment advances to the next position.\n> \n> For (4,1), it is currently occupied by seg8. When seg8 moves, it will go to where seg7 was, so (4,1) is left, but immediately occupied by seg9 if seg9 was adjacent, but in this case, seg9 is at (4,2), so when seg8 moves to (3,1), seg9 moves to (4,1), so (4,1) is still occupied, now by seg9.\n> \n> Similarly, only when the tail moves off, but the tail is at (4,3), which is different cell.\n> \n> To free (4,1), we need all segments from there to the tail to move, so that no segment is on (4,1).\n> \n> Since the snake is a path, and (4,1) has a segment, it will be occupied until that segment is the tail and the tail moves off.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (4,1) is not the tail; tail is at (4,3). The distance from head to this segment is 8 steps (since seg0 to seg8, 8 indices away).\n> \n> After k moves without eating, the segment that was at position m will be at position m-k if m-k >=0, but it's messy.\n> \n> The cell (4,1) will be occupied for the next few moves as the body shifts.\n> \n> Specifically, it will be occupied until the segment currently on it becomes the tail and moves off.\n> \n> The segment at (4,1) is the 9th segment (index 8, 0-based).\n> \n> The tail is index 10.\n> \n> After 2 moves without eating, the tail will be the segment that was index 8, but let's see:\n> \n> After 0 moves: seg8 at (4,1)\n> \n> After 1 move: seg8 moves to seg7 position, so to (3,1), and seg9 moves to (4,1)\n> \n> After 2 moves: seg9 moves to seg8 position, which is (3,1), and seg10 moves to (4,1)? After 1 move, positions: head new, then seg0 old, ..., seg9 old at (4,2) becomes new seg10 at (4,2)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's define the state at turn 35:\n> \n> Positions: S = [P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10] = [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n> \n> When snake moves to a new head position H_new, the new positions are: [H_new, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9] and P10 is removed.\n> \n> So after one move to H_new, new S: [H_new, (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]  -- P10 (4,3) removed.\n> \n> So (4,1) is still occupied, by the 9th element (index 8) which is (4,1) from previous.\n> \n> After second move, new head to H_new2, new S: [H_new2, H_new, (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)]  -- P9 (4,2) removed, but (4,1) is still there as the last element.\n> \n> After second move, new positions: [H_new2, H_new, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8] = [H_new2, H_new, (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)]  -- P8 was (4,1), and it is now the last element.\n> \n> After third move, new S: [H_new3, H_new2, H_new, (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1)]  -- P8 (4,1) is removed, and (4,1) is no longer occupied.\n> \n> So after three moves without eating, (4,1) is freed because the segment that was there has moved and it was the tail in the new state.\n> \n> At turn 35, P8 is at (4,1)\n> \n> After 1 move: P8 is still in new positions at (4,1) as the second last\n> \n> After 2 moves: P8 is at (4,1) as the last element (tail)\n> \n> After 3 moves: P8 is removed, so (4,1) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, if we eat food during this time, snake grows, so it might take longer.\n> \n> But for (4,1) to be free, we need at least 3 moves without eating, or with eating, it could be different.\n> \n> Since we want to eat the food at (4,1), we need to move the head there after it is free.\n> \n> The food has life span 9, from turn 35 to 43, so we have time, but we need to plan the path.\n> \n> Also, there is a risk with tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, the food is at (4,1), which is not the tail; tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> So that might not be an issue now.\n> \n> First, let's find how to get to (4,1) safely.\n> \n> But (4,1) is occupied now, so we need to wait for it to be free.\n> \n> From above, it will be free after 3 moves, on turn 38 if we don't eat any food in between.\n> \n> Turn 35: current\n> \n> After move on turn 35 to turn 36: (4,1) still occupied\n> \n> After turn 36 to 37: (4,1) still occupied but now tail\n> \n> After turn 37 to 38: (4,1) freed, available on turn 38.\n> \n> On turn 38, if no food eaten, (4,1) is free.\n> \n> Then we can move head to (4,1) on turn 38 or later to eat the food.\n> \n> But we need to be at (4,1) by turn 43.\n> \n> Since it's free on turn 38, we can go there on turn 38, 39, etc.\n> \n> But we need to plan the path from current position.\n> \n> Current head at (2,5) on turn 35.\n> \n> We need to move to some direction.\n> \n> Also, we should avoid risks, like getting trapped or colliding.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, walls at borders, obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the left and bottom, from (1,5) to (4,3), with head at (2,5).\n> \n> Available space: for example, right side is open, top is open.\n> \n> Food at (4,1), occupied now.\n> \n> Since we need to eat the food, and it's positive, +1 score and grow.\n> \n> But to eat it, we need to be at (4,1) when it's free, around turn 38.\n> \n> Current turn 35, so in 3 turns.\n> \n> But we need to move the head towards that area.\n> \n> From (2,5), we can move U to (2,6), D to (2,4), or R to (3,5).\n> \n> If we move R to (3,5), that's closer to x=4.\n> \n> (3,5) is safe, as we said.\n> \n> Then from there, we can go to (4,5) or (3,6) or (3,4), etc.\n> \n> But we need to go down to y=1.\n> \n> Also, there's an obstacle at (3,2), so we can't go there.\n> \n> Now, the area around (4,1): (4,1) is currently occupied, but will be free.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: (4,0) is wall (y=0), (4,2) is occupied by snake, (3,1) occupied, (5,1) but x=5, not wall, but walls at x=7, so x=5 is ok.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are safe, similarly y=1 to 6 safe, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so (4,0) is invalid.\n> \n> So adjacent to (4,1): up (4,2), down (4,0) wall, left (3,1), right (5,1).\n> \n> (4,2) is occupied, (3,1) occupied, so only (5,1) is potentially free, but let's see if it's occupied.\n> \n> From snake positions, (5,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Also, (4,1) itself will be free later.\n> \n> To eat the food, we need to move head to (4,1) when it's free.\n> \n> But when we move to (4,1), we eat the food, so snake grows, and the tail doesn't move, so new tail is where the tail was.\n> \n> But at that time, the tail might be elsewhere.\n> \n> Now, back to planning.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's decide the first move.\n> \n> Options: U, D, R from (2,5).\n> \n> If I move R to (3,5), that might be good to go right.\n> \n> Then from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5), L to (2,5) but (2,5) is where the neck is, so if I move L, it would be reverse, but let's see.\n> \n> From (3,5), previous head was (2,5), so current direction would be R, so I can move U, D, R, not L (opposite).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move U to (2,6) from (2,5), then at (2,6), previous was (2,5), so direction U, so I can move U, L, R, not D.\n> \n> Similarly for D.\n> \n> But let's think about getting to (4,1) area.\n> \n> Since (4,1) will be free around turn 38, I need to be near there.\n> \n> Current position (2,5) to (4,1), difference dx=2, dy=4, so Manhattan distance 6, but with turns, I can get there in 6 moves, but since I have to wait for the cell to be free, I can take my time or go directly.\n> \n> But I need to arrive on or before turn 43.\n> \n> Turn 38 to 43 is 6 turns to choose when to go.\n> \n> But I should go when it's safe.\n> \n> Also, there might be other food, but only one food given, at (4,1).\n> \n> The food list has only one: (4,1,9,1)\n> \n> So no other food.\n> \n> So the only way to score is to eat this food or find other, but no other listed, so I think only this one.\n> \n> The state says \"Food Positions\", and only one is given.\n> \n> So I must eat this to score, or survive without eating, but to maximize score, I should eat it.\n> \n> But I need to survive long-term, so if it's risky, I might avoid it, but here it seems possible.\n>

It's turn 36, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning we can't go to those cells. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,5), then body segments: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2). That's 11 segments, so the snake is 11 cells long.\n> \n> Head direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food: Only one food item at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 8.

Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn 36, food at (4,1) has life_span 8.

Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically in such games, if something has a life span of N at turn t, it will last until the end of turn t + N - 1 or something. But to be precise:\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at the current turn, it has life_span, and after that turn, it decreases.\n> \n> But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it is removed after N turns have passed.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: at turn t, with life_span L, after the turn, L decreases by 1.

If L was 1, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available next turn.\n> \n> Similarly, if eaten during the turn, it's consumed.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 36, life_span 8, so it will decrease to 7 after turn 36, and so on, down to 0 after turn 43, so it disappears at turn 44.\n> \n> But for eating, we care about whether it's present when the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Now, the food is at (4,1). Looking at snake positions, (4,1) is the 10th segment?

Let's count:\n> \n> - 0: (3,5) head\n> \n> - 1: (2,5)\n> \n> - 2: (1,5)\n> \n> - 3: (1,4)\n> \n> - 4: (1,3)\n> \n> - 5: (1,2)\n> \n> - 6: (2,2)\n> \n> - 7: (2,1)\n> \n> - 8: (3,1)\n> \n> - 9: (4,1)\n> \n> - 10: (4,2)  // so (4,2) is the tail segment.\n> \n> But the food is at (4,1), which is position 9 in the snake body.\n> \n> Position 9 is (4,1), which is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Now, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, the food is at (4,1), which is currently occupied by a body segment, not the tail. The tail is at (4,2).\n> \n> Tail is at (4,2), and food is at (4,1), which is the second last segment or something.\n> \n> Positions: head (3,5), ... , (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) tail.\n> \n> So (4,1) is the segment before the tail, and (4,2) is tail.\n> \n> Food is at (4,1), which is under the snake body.\n> \n> To eat this food, the snake must move such that the body moves away from (4,1), and then the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> But since the snake is moving, and food is on a body segment, when that segment moves, the food might become accessible if the head can reach it.\n> \n> Let's think about the snake movement.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,5), direction R (right).\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move R, U, or D, but not L because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so next move can be R (continue right), U (up), or D (down), but not L (left) because opposite direction.\n> \n> Now, the grid has walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can't go there. Also internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> So let's map the grid.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so accessible cells are (1,1) to (6,6)? No.\n> \n> \"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall, so we can only be on cells where 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6? Let's see.\n> \n> For example, snake has positions like (1,2), (1,3), etc., which are x=1, y=2, so y=2 is not border, border is y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6 should be accessible, similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6 are free, except for obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), which is within that.\n> \n> Current head at (3,5), which is fine.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - Right (R): to (4,5)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,6)  // y+1\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,4)  // y-1\n> \n> Cannot go left to (2,5) because that's the body segment immediately behind, and also it would be reverse direction.\n> \n> (2,5) is the first body segment, so moving left to (2,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> In general, moving to any cell occupied by body except the tail is deadly, but since the tail moves, if head moves to the current tail position, it's ok because tail moves away.\n> \n> But here, from (3,5), possible cells:\n> \n> - (4,5): is this occupied? Snake positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (1,5), etc. (4,5) is not in the list, so should be free.\n> \n> - (3,6): y=6, since y=7 is wall, but y=6 should be accessible, as borders are walls, so (3,6) is within 1-6 y.\n> \n> y from 1 to 6, so (3,6) is ok, and not occupied by snake? Snake has y=5,4,3,2,1,2, etc., no y=6, so free.\n> \n> - (3,4): similarly, (3,4) not in positions, should be free.\n> \n> Now, the food is at (4,1), with value +1, life span 8.\n> \n> But it's currently under the snake at position (4,1), which is segment 9.\n> \n> To eat it, we need the snake to move so that the segment at (4,1) moves away, and then head can move to (4,1) when it's free.\n> \n> Since the snake moves one step per turn, when the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so positions shift.\n> \n> Let's simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> Current positions: indices 0 to 10: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n> \n> After one move, if head moves to a new cell, the tail moves away, so the body segments shift.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to a new cell, that becomes new head, and the tail cell is removed, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, snake moves: new head position based on move, then all segments shift, so the tail is removed.\n> \n> If food eaten, new head position, and tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, for food at (4,1), it is currently occupied, so not accessible. When the snake moves, depending on the move, the segment at (4,1) might move or not.\n> \n> Let's see the current tail: (4,2) is tail. When snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail (4,2) is removed, and a new tail is created at (4,1) or something? No.\n> \n> After move: the body segments follow the head.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to (4,5), then new positions: head at (4,5), then the old head (3,5) becomes segment 1, (2,5) becomes segment 2, and so on, up to (4,1) becomes segment 9, and (4,2) is the old tail, which is removed, so the new tail is (4,1)? Let's list:\n> \n> Old positions: 0:(3,5), 1:(2,5), 2:(1,5), 3:(1,4), 4:(1,3), 5:(1,2), 6:(2,2), 7:(2,1), 8:(3,1), 9:(4,1), 10:(4,2)\n> \n> After move R to (4,5):\n> \n> New head: (4,5)\n> \n> Then new segment 1: old head (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 2: old seg1 (2,5)\n> \n> Segment 3: old seg2 (1,5)\n> \n> Segment 4: old seg3 (1,4)\n> \n> Segment 5: old seg4 (1,3)\n> \n> Segment 6: old seg5 (1,2)\n> \n> Segment 7: old seg6 (2,2)\n> \n> Segment 8: old seg7 (2,1)\n> \n> Segment 9: old seg8 (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 10: old seg9 (4,1)  // since tail removed, the last segment is old seg9, which was (4,1)\n> \n> Old seg9 was (4,1), and old tail (4,2) is removed, so new segments: head at (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — so tail is now at (4,1).\n> \n> Previously, food was at (4,1), but after the move, the snake is now at (4,1) as the tail, so the cell (4,1) is still occupied by snake, but it's the tail now.\n> \n> Food is at (4,1), which is now the tail position after this move.\n> \n> But the food was there before, and now the snake tail is there, so the food is still under the snake.\n> \n> To eat the food, we need the cell to be empty and then head move to it.\n> \n> Currently, after any move, the food at (4,1) might still be covered or not, depending on movement.\n> \n> The food is at (4,1), and it has a life span of 8 turns from now.\n> \n> I need to think about how to reach (4,1) with the head after the body has moved away.\n> \n> Also, there's the Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n> \n> But in this case, the food is not on the tail yet; it's on a body segment.\n> \n> Let's find a path to the food.\n> \n> First, the head is at (3,5), food at (4,1).\n> \n> The grid has obstacles: internal at (3,2), so (3,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Also, snake body occupies many cells.\n> \n> I should consider possible actions for the next few turns.\n> \n> The goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, and think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Currently, only one food, positive, at (4,1), life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 43, I think.

Head direction is D, down, which is (x,y-1). So from (4,4), moving down would go to (4,3). But the next segment is at (4,5), which has higher y, so if y increases upwards, then (4,5) is above (4,4).

It's turn 39. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,2). So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (3,2) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then body segments: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1). That's 11 segments, so the snake is 11 cells long.\n> \n> Head direction is down (D), meaning it's moving downward. Since it's at (4,3), moving down would go to (4,2), but I need to check if that's possible.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 5, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 8, value +1 (also positive food)\n> \n> Both foods are positive, so eating them increases length by 1.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,1), it disappears after 5 turns, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 39, life span is 5, so it will disappear after turn 43? Let's calculate: life span N means it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> At turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone by turn t + L - 1 or something? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns, it's gone. So at turn t, life span N: exists until turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: life span N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: life span N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + N - 1: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: gone\n> \n> So for food at (4,1), life span 5 at turn 39, so it will be gone after turn 43? Turn 39: life span 5, turn 40: 4, turn 41: 3, turn 42: 2, turn 43: 1, so on turn 44 it should be gone. But since it decreases each turn including current, at turn t + N, it's 0 and gone.\n> \n> Standard way: after N turns, it disappears. So from turn t, it lasts for N more turns, including t? No.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t with life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Or beginning?\n> \n> I think it's safer to think: at the start of turn t, if life span is L, then during this turn it's present, and after the turn, life span becomes L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for planning, since we decide moves at the start of the turn, we know if food is present or not.\n> \n> At turn 39, life span 5, so it will be present for turns 39, 40, 41, 42, 43? Turn 39: L=5, after turn 39, L becomes 4 for turn 40, and so on, up to turn 43: L=1, after turn 43, it becomes 0 and disappears, so not present on turn 44.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,2): life span 8 at turn 39, so present until turn 46.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,3), direction down. So possible moves: since direction is down, I can go down, left, or right, but not up because of no instant reverse.

(4,2) is within bounds? x=4, y=2, y=2 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=2 is fine. But is (4,2) occupied? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1)\n> \n> So occupied: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1)\n> \n> (4,2) is not in this list, so not occupied by body. Also, not a wall; walls are (3,2) and borders. (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> (4,2) is at x=4,y=2, which is not (3,2), so no wall. Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,2) is inside.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,3): x=3,y=3, not wall, not occupied?

(1,5) to (1,4) is down, since y decreases? Coordinates: let's assume y increases up, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), so probably y increases as we go up.\n> \n> In the movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top? But in positions, head at (4,3), moving down to (4,2) would be decreasing y.\n> \n> In the snake positions, (4,3) to (4,4) to (4,5), so from (4,3) to (4,4) is up?

Since at turn 39, L=5, after turn 39: L=4 for turn 40, ..., after turn 43: L=0 gone. So last chance to eat is turn 43.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) has L=8, so available until turn 46.\n> \n> But (2,2) is under the snake, so to eat it, we need the body to move away.\n> \n> Currently, (2,2) is segment 9, and tail is at (2,1). The snake moves, so each turn the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the body segments shift.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, each body segment moves to the next position, and the tail segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten now, when we move, the tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (2,1). When we move, the head moves to a new cell, say to (4,2) for example, then the body shifts: the segment at (4,4) moves to where head was (4,3), and so on, down to tail at (2,1) moves to where the previous segment was, but since it's the tail, it leaves the cell.\n> \n> Specifically, after move, new head position, and the last segment (tail) is removed, so the cell it occupied is free now.\n> \n> In this case, after one move, the tail at (2,1) will be gone, so (2,1) becomes free.\n> \n> But for (2,2), which is occupied by segment 9, after one move, segment 9 will move to where segment 10 was, which is (2,1)?

Standard snake movement: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail position is abandoned.\n> \n> So new snake: [new_head, old_head, old_segment1, ..., old_segment9] but since there are 11 segments, indices 0 to 10.\n> \n> After move: new head at new_pos, then the body is [old_pos0, old_pos1, ..., old_pos9], so positions 1 to 10 of the new snake are the old positions 0 to 9.\n> \n> And old_pos10 (tail) is no longer part of snake.\n> \n> For example, if head moves down to (4,2), new head is (4,2), then body: old head (4,3) becomes segment 1, then (4,4) becomes segment 2, (4,5) segment 3, (3,5) segment 4, (2,5) segment 5, (1,5) segment 6, (1,4) segment 7, (1,3) segment 8, (1,2) segment 9, (2,2) segment 10, and (2,1) is abandoned.\n> \n> So the cell (2,1) is now free, and (2,2) is still occupied, by what was segment 9, now segment 10.\n> \n> Segment 9 was (2,2), but after move, it becomes segment 10, at the same position?

It's turn 40, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and one internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are given: head at (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2). So the snake has 11 segments. The head direction is down, which is D, meaning it was moving downward last turn.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 4\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 7\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> All food has positive value, +1, and increases length when eaten. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including the current one. So for (4,1), life span 4 means it will disappear after 4 more turns, including turn 40. So it will be gone after turn 43? Let's clarify the life span countdown.\n> \n> Life span: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is N, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. For example, at turn 40, life span 4 means:\n> \n> - Turn 40: life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 41: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 42: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 43: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 44: life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 43, inclusive? No.\n> \n> The food can be eaten as long as its life span is greater than 0. When life span decreases to 0, it disappears before the turn starts or something? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn t, if life span is L, then after the turn, it decreases to L-1. If L was 1, it disappears after the turn. So for (4,1) at turn 40, life span 4: after turn 40, it becomes 3; after turn 41, 2; after turn 42, 1; after turn 43, 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten during turns 40, 41, 42, 43? But during turn 43, after eating, it might be gone.\n> \n> Typically, the food is present during the turn if life span > 0. So for (4,1), life span 4 at turn 40, it is present for turns 40, 41, 42, 43. On turn 44, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) life span 7: present for turns 40 to 46.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 10: present for turns 40 to 49.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,2), direction down. So last move was down, to (4,2). Current position is (4,2), and it came from (4,3)? Positions: head is (4,2), then (4,3), so if head is at (4,2) and next is (4,3), that means the snake was moving upward? I need to understand the direction.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), ...] so head is at (4,2), and the second segment is at (4,3), which is directly above, since y=3 > y=2? Coordinates: let's assume (x,y) with y increasing upward or downward?\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases as we go up, I think. Standard grid: usually (0,0) bottom-left, but here walls are given with y=0 and y=7, so let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — so from (4,2) to (4,3) is increasing y, which is upward? But head direction is given as D, down. Contradiction?\n> \n> Head direction: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" meaning the current direction the head is facing, I think it's the direction it moved to get to the current position.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Snake Head Direction: U/D/L/R\" and in this case D.\n> \n> But positions: from (4,3) to (4,2) would be down, since y decreased from 3 to 2? Let's list positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (4,2) head\n> \n> Index 1: (4,3)\n> \n> Index 2: (4,4)\n> \n> Index 3: (4,5)\n> \n> Index 4: (3,5)\n> \n> etc.\n> \n> So from index 1 (4,3) to index 0 (4,2), that is a move down, because y decreased from 3 to 2. So direction down makes sense; it moved down to (4,2).\n> \n> Now, the head is at (4,2), and it can move in possible directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But no instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D (down), so cannot move U (up) next, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,2): D, L, R. Cannot U.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are occupied or walls.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So if I move, for example:\n> \n> - Down to (4,1): y=1, which is not y=0, so not wall. y=0 is bottom wall, I think. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 0 to 7 inclusive? x from 0 to 7 inclusive.\n> \n> (4,1) is within bounds, x=4 between 0-7, y=1 between 0-7, not wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), which is left of head, but head is at (4,2), so (3,2) is occupied by wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, snake body: positions are all occupied except the tail might move.\n> \n> Current positions: head (4,2), body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)\n> \n> So (2,2) is the tail.\n> \n> Now, if I move, the tail will move only if I don't eat food; if I eat, tail stays and grows.\n> \n> But for collision, when I move, the head moves to a new cell, and if that cell is occupied by body or wall, I die. But the tail is special: if I move into the tail cell, and the tail moves away, it might be ok, but only if the tail is not staying due to eating.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving, the head moves to a new cell. If that cell is food, it eats and grows, so the tail doesn't move. If not, the tail moves forward, so the cell it leaves is free.\n> \n> Collision: head cannot move to a cell occupied by body segment except the tail, because the tail will move. But if the head moves to the tail cell, and I don't eat, the tail moves, so it's ok. If I eat, the tail stays, so moving to tail cell when eating would cause collision because the new head and tail would be on same cell after growth.\n> \n> The rule says: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But only if you don't eat food. If you eat food, you grow, tail doesn't move, so if head moves to tail position, it would collide.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, for moving to tail cell:\n> \n> - If there is no food, I can move to tail cell, and since tail moves away, no collision.\n> \n> - If there is food on tail cell, and I move there to eat it, then since I eat, tail doesn't move, and head is on that cell, but after eating, the tail is still there? Let's think.\n> \n> Positions: suppose tail is at T, and head moves to T to eat food. After eating, the snake grows, so the tail stays, and head is now on T, but T was tail, so now there are two segments on T? That causes collision.\n> \n> Yes, as per the rule: eating food on tail cell causes immediate death because head and tail are on same cell after growth.\n> \n> Otherwise, if no food, moving to tail cell is safe because tail moves.\n> \n> Also, food under body: can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on it.

It's turn 41. The grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and one internal obstacle at (3,2). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,2), then body segments at (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So the snake is 11 units long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it just moved from (4,2) to (5,2).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value +1 and life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including this one. After turn 43, it's gone.\n> \n> - (2,2) with value +1 and life span 6. Disappears after turn 46.\n> \n> - (2,6) with value +1 and life span 9. Disappears after turn 49.\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 41. Since the head direction is R, I can't move left instantly because that would be opposite to current direction. So possible moves from (5,2) are: Up (U) to (5,3), Down (D) to (5,1), or Right (R) to (6,2). Left is not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so moving right to (6,2) is on the border? x=7 is a wall, so x=6 should be within bounds? The grid is from x=0 to x=7, but walls are at x=0 and x=7, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls. Similarly for y. So playable cells are x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> x=7 is a wall, so (6,2) is not a wall cell; it's within bounds. Similarly, (5,1) and (5,3) are within bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), but that's not near the head now.\n> \n> Now, snake body: Head is at (5,2), body segments: (4,2), (4,3), etc. So moving to (4,2) would be into the body, but (4,2) is the next segment, which is the neck. When we move, the tail moves, so moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is allowed, but here (4,2) is occupied by the body, and since the snake moves, after the move, the tail will move away.\n> \n> Important: Collision is when head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail moves. So if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it's ok because the tail will move, so no collision. But if it moves to any other body segment, it's a collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (5,3): is (5,3) occupied? Snake positions: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), etc. So (5,3) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n> \n> - Down to (5,1): not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> - Right to (6,2): not in snake positions, free.\n> \n> - Left to (4,2): but (4,2) is occupied by the first body segment. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision because the head would be on the same cell as the body before movement. After movement, the body shifts, but at the moment of move, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies, except for the tail cell.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, (4,2) is the neck, not the tail. Tail is at (1,2). So moving left to (4,2) would cause collision because it's touching the body.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,2), possible moves: U, D, R. L is invalid due to collision and also direction reversal not allowed.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and plan multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (4,1): value +1, life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 43 or it disappears.\n> \n> - (2,2): value +1, life span 6, eat by turn 46.\n> \n> - (2,6): value +1, life span 9, eat by turn 49.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case about food under the snake's body. Let's check if any food is under the snake.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n> \n> Food: (4,1), (2,2), (2,6)\n> \n> (4,1) is not under snake, (2,2) is at (2,2), is that occupied? Snake has (2,5), (1,5), etc., but not (2,2). Similarly, (2,6) not occupied. So no food under body now.\n> \n> But (2,2) might be relevant.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But tail is at (1,2), and food is at (2,2), which is adjacent? (2,2) is not the tail cell; the tail cell is (1,2). Food at (2,2) is separate.\n> \n> Head is at (5,2), tail at (1,2), not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence to maximize score, but prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: 6x6 playable? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but walls at borders, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> (3,2) is occupied by wall, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Snake: head (5,2), body going down to (4,2), then up to (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), then left to (3,5), (2,5), then down to (1,5), then right?

Free, I think.\n> \n> - D to (5,1): free.\n> \n> - R to (6,2): free.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,1) is close, but to reach it, I need to go down to (5,1) or something.\n> \n> (4,1) is at row 4, column 1.\n> \n> From (5,2), if I go down to (5,1), then I'm at (5,1), and (4,1) is adjacent left.\n> \n> But from (5,1), I could go left to (4,1) to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,2) is at (2,2), which might be reachable later.\n> \n> Food at (2,6) is farther.\n> \n> Life spans: (4,1) disappears after turn 43, so only 3 turns including this one: turn 41,42,43. After turn 43, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) lasts until turn 46, (2,6) until turn 49.\n> \n> Since (4,1) has short life, I should consider eating it soon.\n> \n> But is it safe?\n> \n> Also, I need to think about the path.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move for that turn.\n> \n> When you eat food, length increases, so tail stays, body extends.\n> \n> But here all food is positive, so eating grows.\n> \n> Now, let's plan turn by turn.\n> \n> Turn 41: start at (5,2), head direction R.\n> \n> Options: U, D, R.\n> \n> If I go R to (6,2): then head at (6,2). From there, I can go U to (6,3), D to (6,1), or L to (5,2). But (5,2) is now the neck, since body moves, so moving back to (5,2) would be collision? After move to (6,2), the body shifts: new head (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), etc. Tail at (1,2) moves to (1, something)? When snake moves, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, after moving to (6,2), positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,3)? Let's trace.\n> \n> Current positions: turn 41, head (5,2), body: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) — that's 11 segments.\n> \n> After move, say to (6,2), new head (6,2), then the previous head (5,2) becomes neck, so body: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and tail (1,2) is removed? No: when you move without eating, the tail moves off, so the new tail is the second last, but the cell is vacated.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2), positions: head (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — and (1,2) is no longer part, so tail is now at (1,3)? Original positions: index 0: (5,2) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (1,5), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,3), 10: (1,2) tail.\n> \n> After moving right to (6,2), new head is (6,2), and the body shifts: segment 1 becomes (5,2), segment 2 becomes (4,2), segment 3 becomes (4,3), ..., up to segment 10 becomes (1,3), and segment 11 (tail) was (1,2) but since no growth, tail is removed, so new positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — so tail at (1,3).\n> \n> Similarly, if I go up to (5,3), new head (5,3), body: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail at (1,3) since (1,2) is removed.\n> \n> (1,2) was tail, removed, so positions after up move: head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — yes.\n> \n> Down to (5,1): head (5,1), body (5,2), (4,2), etc., tail at (1,3).\n> \n> Now, back to turn 41 choices.\n> \n> I need to eat (4,1) soon, since life span 3. Turn 41,42,43 to eat.\n> \n> If I go down to (5,1) on turn 41, then on turn 42, I can go left to (4,1) to eat it.\n> \n> But let's see the state.\n> \n> Turn 41: move to (5,1).

L to (4,1), which is free? (4,1) is food, not occupied by snake, so I can move there to eat. D to (5,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid. R to (6,1), which is within bounds.\n> \n> So from (5,1), moves: U to (5,2) - collision with body, not allowed. D to (5,0) - wall. L to (4,1) - possible, to eat food. R to (6,1) - possible.\n> \n> If I go L to (4,1), I eat the food, so snake grows, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> After eating, new length 12, positions: head (4,1), then body: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), ..., up to (1,3), and tail stays, so (1,2) was removed earlier? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Before turn 42, positions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail at (1,3).\n> \n> If I move to (4,1) and eat, new head (4,1), and since eating, the tail doesn't move, so body remains: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), ..., (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — and new tail is still (1,3)? Positions: head (4,1), then the previous head (5,1) becomes first body, so: head (4,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — 12 segments, tail at (1,3).\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? (4,1) is not under body, so ok.\n> \n> After eating, head at (4,1), direction from (5,1) to (4,1) is left, so new head direction L.\n> \n> Now, from here, I need to think about the next moves.\n> \n> But let's see other options.\n> \n> If on turn 41 I go right to (6,2), then head at (6,2), and (4,1) is still there, but I'm farther away. To reach (4,1) from (6,2), I need to go left, but the body might be in the way.\n> \n> For example, from (6,2), I can go left to (5,2), but (5,2) is now the neck after move, so if I go back, collision.\n> \n> After moving to (6,2), positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (4,2), etc.\n> \n> If I go left to (5,2), that's directly into the neck, collision, not allowed.\n> \n> I can go down to (6,1) or up to (6,3).\n> \n> But (6,1) is near the corner, and (4,1) is at (4,1), so to reach it, I might need to go through (5,1) or something, but let's see the path.\n> \n> From (6,2), if I go down to (6,1), then from (6,1) I can go left to (5,1), then to (4,1), but that would be on turn 43.\n> \n> Turn 41: go to (6,2)\n> \n> Turn 42: from (6,2), go down to (6,1) — possible, since (6,1) free.\n> \n> Then turn 43: from (6,1), go left to (5,1) — (5,1) should be free?

Life span: turn 41,42,43, so on turn 43 it can be eaten, but after turn 43 it disappears. So during turn 43, if I move to it, I eat it.\n> \n> But from (5,1) on turn 43, I can go left to (4,1) to eat.\n> \n> But I need to be at (5,1) on turn 43.\n> \n> In the sequence: turn 41: R to (6,2)\n> \n> Turn 42: D to (6,1)\n> \n> Turn 43: L to (5,1) — but now at (5,1), and to eat (4,1), I need to move to (4,1) on the same turn? On turn 43, from (5,1), I can move to (4,1) if I choose L.\n> \n> But when I move to (5,1) on turn 43, that's the action for turn 43.\n> \n> Then for turn 44, I could move to (4,1), but turn 43 is the last chance for (4,1), so if I don't move directly to (4,1) on turn 43, I miss it.\n> \n> On turn 43, if I am at (5,1), and I move to (4,1), I eat it on turn 43.\n> \n> In the sequence above, on turn 43, I move to (5,1), not to (4,1). I need to go directly.\n> \n> In the path: after turn 42 at (6,1), on turn 43 I can choose to go left to (5,1) or directly down? From (6,1), moves: U to (6,2), but (6,2) is previous head? After turn 42, positions: turn 42 move to (6,1), so head (6,1), body (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), etc., tail at (1,4)? Let's not get distracted.\n> \n> To eat (4,1) on turn 43, I need to be on a cell adjacent to it on turn 42 or earlier.\n> \n> If on turn 41 I go down to (5,1), then on turn 42 I can eat it directly.\n> \n> If on turn 41 I go right, then on turn 42 I need to be near, but from (6,2), if I go down to (6,1) on turn 42, then on turn 43 I am at (6,1), and (4,1) is two steps away, so I can't reach it on turn 43 to eat; I can move to (5,1) on turn 43, but (4,1) disappears after turn 43, so if I don't move to it on turn 43, it's gone.\n> \n> Turn 43: if I am at (5,1), I can move to (4,1) to eat it.\n> \n> But to be at (5,1) on turn 43, I need to have moved there.\n> \n> In the sequence: turn 41: R to (6,2)\n> \n> Turn 42: D to (6,1)\n> \n> Turn 43: L to (5,1) — now at (5,1), but I haven't eaten (4,1) yet. To eat it, I need to move to (4,1), which would be turn 44, but turn 44 is after turn 43, so (4,1) is gone. Life span: disappears after N turns, including current. So for (4,1), life span 3, present on turns 41,42,43. On turn 43, it is still there and can be eaten. On turn 44, it is gone.\n> \n> So on turn 43, if I am at a cell adjacent to (4,1), I can move to it and eat.\n> \n> If on turn 43 I am at (5,1), which is adjacent, I can move to (4,1) to eat on turn 43.\n> \n> In the sequence: turn 41: R to (6,2)\n> \n> Turn 42: D to (6,1) — now at (6,1) on turn 42.\n> \n> Turn 43: from (6,1), I can move to (5,1) or to (6,2) or (5,1) or (6,0) invalid.\n> \n> If I move to (5,1) on turn 43, I am at (5,1), but (4,1) is left, so I can only eat it if I move directly to it, but on turn 43 I am moving to (5,1), not to (4,1). So after moving to (5,1) on turn 43, (4,1) is still there? No, when I move to (5,1) on turn 43, that action is for turn 43, and after the move, if (5,1) has food, I eat it, but (4,1) is not at (5,1).\n> \n> To eat (4,1), I need to move to (4,1) on turn 43.\n> \n> But on turn 43, I am at (6,1), and (4,1) is not adjacent; it's two cells away, so I can't reach it in one move. From (6,1) to (4,1) requires two moves, but on turn 43 I can only move to adjacent cells, so to (5,1) or (6,2) or (6,0) invalid. (5,1) is the only option to get closer.\n> \n> Then on turn 44, (4,1) is gone.\n> \n> Therefore, if I don't start moving towards (4,1) on turn 41, I can't eat it.\n> \n> Specifically, to eat (4,1) on turn 43, I need to be at (4,2), (5,1), or (3,1) on turn 42?

It's turn 42, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (5,1), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So the snake has 11 segments. The head direction is down, which is towards decreasing y, since y=0 is the bottom? Let me confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which probably means y increases upwards, so U is up, D is down to lower y. But in the position list, the head is at (5,1) and direction is D, which is down, so from (5,1) down would be to (5,0), but y=0 is a wall, so it can't go there directly. Let's list all positions:\n> \n> - Head: (5,1)\n> \n> - Next: (5,2) — that's one above? If y increases upwards, (5,2) has higher y than (5,1), so if U is (x,y+1), that means moving to higher y is up, so (5,2) is above (5,1). But the snake is moving down? Direction is given as D, down.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,1), (5,2), ...] so from head to body: head at (5,1), then the next segment is at (5,2), which is above it if y increases upwards. But if direction is down, that means the snake was moving down to (5,1) from a previous position. Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> The head direction is the direction it moved to get to the current head position. So head is at (5,1), and it arrived there by moving down, so it came from (5,2) or something? Positions: head at (5,1), body at (5,2), so the snake was previously at (5,2) and moved down to (5,1). But (5,2) to (5,1) is down, since y decreased from 2 to 1. Then the direction is D, down, meaning it moved down to get to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, for the next move, since direction is D, I can't do an instant reverse, so I can't move up (U) because that would be opposite to down. So possible moves are left (L), right (R), or continue down (D), but down to (5,0) is a wall, so I can't go down. Walls are at y=0, so (5,0) is out of bounds. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,1)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U (up): (x,y+1) = (5,2)\n> \n> - D (down): (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid\n> \n> - L (left): (x-1,y) = (4,1)\n> \n> - R (right): (x+1,y) = (6,1)\n> \n> But instant reverse: since current direction is D, moving U would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. So U is invalid for this turn.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible moves are L to (4,1) or R to (6,1). D is invalid because of wall.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,1), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 42, it has life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 43? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it will be gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> For food at (4,1) at turn 42 with life span 2: it will disappear after 2 turns, so at turn 44, it's gone. But it can be eaten on turn 42 or 43? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Let's interpret: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it means that at the start of turn t, if a food has life span L, it will be present during turn t, and at the end of turn t, life span decreases by 1. So if L=1, it disappears after this turn; if L=2, it will be present for this turn and next, then disappear.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,1) at turn 42, life span 2: it will be available on turn 42 and 43, and disappear after turn 43, so not available on turn 44.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) life span 5: available for turns 42 to 46, disappear after turn 46.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 8: available for turns 42 to 49.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (5,1), and I need to choose a move for turn 42.\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n> \n> (4,1) has food, so if I move left to (4,1), I eat the food there, since it's not under the body or anything? Current positions: snake is at (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), etc. (4,1) is not occupied by snake, I think. Let's list all snake positions: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So (4,1) is free, no snake there.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders and (3,2) obstacle.\n> \n> (4,1) is at x=4,y=1, not a wall.\n> \n> So moving to (4,1) would eat the food, since head moves there.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, if I move to (4,1), I eat the food, snake grows to 12 segments. New head at (4,1), and the tail will be the last segment, which is (1,3) currently.\n> \n> After moving to (4,1), the snake body will be: head at (4,1), then since it ate food, the tail doesn't move, so positions become: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] but (5,1) was the previous head, now it's the second segment.\n> \n> Original positions: [ (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]\n> \n> After moving left to (4,1) and eating food: head moves to (4,1), and since food is eaten, length increases, so the tail stays. So new positions: head at (4,1), then the previous head (5,1) becomes second, then (5,2), then (4,2), and so on, up to (1,3), but since we add a segment, the tail is still (1,3), and we have 12 segments.\n> \n> Specifically: new head: (4,1)\n> \n> Then: (5,1) // previous head\n> \n> Then: (5,2) // this was first body segment\n> \n> Then: (4,2) // second body\n> \n> And so on, down to (1,3), which was the tail, but since we ate food, it doesn't move, so (1,3) remains, and we have a new segment? No: when snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't advance, meaning that the last position stays, and a new segment is added at the tail.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food, and since you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So positions: the new head is at the food cell, and the body includes all previous segments, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> So from 11 segments, after eating, 12 segments.\n> \n> Positions: [ (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]\n> \n> (1,3) is still there.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,1), and direction: since I moved left, new direction is L.\n> \n> But I need to consider future moves.\n> \n> If I don't eat, move right to (6,1).\n> \n> Then no food eaten, head moves to (6,1), tail moves to the next, so positions: head at (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), ..., up to (1,4), and (1,3) is gone, so snake shortens?

Moving there would cause a collision because the body is there now. But according to rules, we can move into a cell that will be vacated, but only if it's the tail.

If I move up to (4,2), the head would be on a body segment that isn't moving away, so it should be a collision. Because when I move, the head moves first, then the body follows, but if head moves to a cell that is occupied by body, it collides unless that cell is the tail and will be vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: after head moves, if the new head position is the same as any body segment except the tail, it dies. If it's the tail, it's ok because tail moves after.\n> \n> Here, (4,2) is not the tail; tail is (1,3).

Is it wall or free? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle (3,2). (3,1) is not listed as wall, so it should be free. But is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,1) not in the list, so free.\n> \n> Right: to (5,1) – (5,1) is the second segment, body.

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 44, life span 3, meaning after 3 turns it disappears: turn 44,45,46, gone on 47? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,2) with life span 3 at turn 44. After turn 44, countdown to 2. After turn 45, to 1. After turn 46, to 0, so disappears before turn 47? Or after turn 46?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it means: when spawned, life span N, at each turn, including the turn it's present, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after?\n> \n> From the text: \"Disappears after N turns\" and countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> Probably, if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone after turn t + N - 1 or something. Let's think.\n> \n> Assume that at the turn it is listed, life span is current value. After each turn, it decreases by 1. When it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> For example, at turn 44, life span 3 for (2,2). After turn 44 is processed, life span becomes 2. After turn 45, becomes 1. After turn 46, becomes 0, so before turn 47, it disappears, so not available on turn 47.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) life span 6 at turn 44, so will last until after turn 49? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn 44: life span 3 for (2,2), so available on turns 44,45,46? After turn 44, life span 2, so still there. After turn 45, life span 1, still there. After turn 46, life span 0, disappears, so not on turn 47.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) life span 6 at turn 44: after turn 44, 5; turn45,4; ... turn49,0, so disappears before turn 50.\n> \n> (1,1) life span 9, so lasts longer.\n> \n> Back to turn 45 choices.\n> \n> From (2,1), I can move up to (2,2) or left to (1,1).\n> \n> If I move to (2,2), I eat the food there, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new head at (2,2), length increases.\n> \n> Then positions: head (2,2), body: (2,1), (3,1), etc., and tail still (1,5) or? After eating, tail stays, so positions add (2,2) as head, and the body includes (2,1) which was head, now second, and so on, up to (1,5), and since we ate, we don't remove tail, so new segment at the end? When we eat, the snake grows, so after moving head to food, the tail remains, and we add a new segment where tail was or something? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, head occupies that cell, and a new segment is added to the tail, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> So positions: before move, snake is at S, with head H, tail T.\n> \n> After moving to food: new head at food position, the body is H followed by previous body, and tail remains, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 45, before move, positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), ..., (1,5)] 12 segments.\n> \n> If move to (2,2) which has food, then new positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), ..., up to (1,5), and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end? No, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the segment before tail stays, and tail position remains, but since we grow, the new tail is the same as old tail? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically: when not eating, head moves to new position, tail is removed.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to food, tail is not removed, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head position becomes second segment, and all body segments stay, no tail removed, so length increases by one.\n> \n> For example: previous positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After eating: [new_head (food), H, B1, B2, ..., T] so T is still there, and we have one more segment.\n> \n> In this case, after moving to (2,2) and eating, positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) — now 13 segments, since tail (1,5) not removed.\n> \n> Similarly, if move to (1,1) and eat, same thing.\n> \n> Now, also, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, for (2,2) or (1,1), is the tail adjacent?\n> \n> Tail is at (1,5) currently, before move.\n> \n> Head at (2,1), tail at (1,5). Are they adjacent? (2,1) and (1,5) - x differ by 1, y differ by 4, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. So (2,1) and (1,5) are not adjacent; distance is |dx| + |dy| = 1+4=5, not 1.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, from (2,1), moving to (2,2) or (1,1) both seem possible.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list all food:\n> \n> - (2,2): value +1, life span 3 at turn 44.

Now turn 45, it is still there with life span 2 (after turn 44 decrease).\n> \n> At turn 44, life span 3, after turn 44, it decreases to 2, so at turn 45, life span 2, available.\n> \n> Similarly, at turn 46, life span 1, available.

This means it disappears after 2 turns, including current, so after turn 46, it might be gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 45, life span is 2, so it will disappear after turn 46. After turn 46, it's gone.\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 5. So it will disappear after turn 49 (45 + 4 more turns? Let's clarify: life span N means it disappears after N turns from now, including current turn. So:\n> \n> - For (2,2): life span 2 at turn 45. After turn 45, life span becomes 1. After turn 46, life span 0, so it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 45 or 46.\n> \n> - Similarly, (2,6): life span 5, so disappears after turn 49 (after 4 more turns: turn 46,47,48,49?

(1,1) is not in snake positions, and not wall? x=1,y=1, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,1) is not border. Internal obstacle is (3,2), so (1,1) is free.

Then new head is (2,2), and the tail stays or grows? When I eat, length increases, so tail doesn't move this turn.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so positions: new head at (2,2), then previous head (2,1) becomes body, and all body segments shift, but since we add a segment, the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added at the tail? No.\n> \n> In Snake, when you eat food, you grow, so the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move that turn. The body segments remain where they are, but since head moved, the segment that was head becomes neck, and so on.\n> \n> Standard Snake mechanics.\n> \n> So if I move to (2,2) and eat food, new positions: head at (2,2), then (2,1), then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) and then since I ate, I add a new segment at the end, so tail becomes (1,5) still, but now there are 13 segments: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), ..., up to (1,5), and new segment at (1,5)? No.\n> \n> When you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and the new segment is attached, so the tail end remains the same cell, but since it's added, the segment that was tail is now second last, and new tail is the same position? Confusion.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake moves forward: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail does not move, so the position it occupied is still occupied, and a new segment is added there, but since tail doesn't move, the last segment stays, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> Example: positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move without eating: new head at new position, then [old H, B1, B2, ..., up to before T], and T is removed.\n> \n> With eating: new head at new position, then [old H, B1, B2, ..., T], and T stays, so new positions: [new head, old H, B1, ..., T] with T still there.\n> \n> In this case, for move to (2,2) from (2,1), eating food.\n> \n> Old positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), ..., tail (1,5)\n> \n> After move: head moves to (2,2), so new head (2,2), then the previous head (2,1) becomes the new second segment, then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) and since I ate, I add a new segment at the tail, so the tail is still (1,5), but now it's followed by a new segment? No, the new segment is added at the tail position, meaning that the tail cell remains occupied, and the snake gains a segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) — and that's 12 segments, but I ate, so it should be 13.\n> \n> I think I missed: the segments are: from head to tail: index 0 to 11, 12 segments.\n> \n> After move to (2,2) with eat: new head (2,2), then segment 1 is old head (2,1), segment 2 is (3,1), ..., segment 11 is (2,5), segment 12 is (1,5), and since ate, we add a new segment 13 at position (1,5), so tail is now (1,5) with the new segment, but (1,5) is already occupied, so the new tail is at (1,5), and the previous tail position is still (1,5), so it's the same cell. So the snake now has segments: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) — 13 segments, all positions the same except new head at (2,2) and the body from (2,1) to (1,5) unchanged, with (1,5) being the tail.\n> \n> (1,5) is the tail, and it didn't move, so it's still there.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to (1,1) and eat, new head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), ..., (1,5), and add new segment at (1,5), so tail at (1,5).\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> If I move up to (2,2), I eat the food there. But life span is 2, so if I don't eat now, it might be gone soon, but I can eat now.\n> \n> There is also the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (1,5), head is at (2,1), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so |dx| + |dy| = 1.\n> \n> (2,1) and (1,5) are not adjacent; dx=1, dy=4, so not adjacent. So no danger here.\n> \n> Now, let's think ahead.\n> \n> First option: move up to (2,2) at turn 45.\n> \n> Then new head at (2,2), direction up?

So the snake has 13 segments. Head direction is Up, which is U, meaning last move was up to (2,2) from (2,1)? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (2,2) is head, then (2,1) which is down, but head direction is U, so it must have moved up to (2,2).

So when life span reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> But let's see the description: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's: at turn t, with life span L, it will be present for this turn and the next L-1 turns, so total L turns, disappearing at turn t+L.\n> \n> For (2,6) at turn 46, life span 4: present on turns 46,47,48,49, gone at turn 50.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life span 7: present turns 46 to 52, gone at 53.\n> \n> (5,4) life span 10: present turns 46 to 55, gone at 56.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,2)\n> \n> Head direction: U, so last move was up.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: since head direction is U, I cannot move D (down) immediately, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,2): U (up to (2,3)), L (left to (1,2)), R (right to (3,2))\n> \n> But (3,2) is an internal obstacle? Walls: internal obstacles: [(3,2)], so (3,2) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> So from (2,2):\n> \n> - U: (2,3) - is this free? Need to check if it's occupied or wall.\n> \n> (2,3) is not in snake positions? Snake positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), etc. (2,3) is not listed, so probably free, but need to check walls.\n> \n> Walls: borders y=0 and y=7, so y=3 is not border, and internal obstacles only (3,2), so (2,3) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, L: (1,2) - x=1, y=2, not border, not obstacle, and not in snake positions? Snake has (1,5), but not (1,2), so free.\n> \n> R: (3,2) - but (3,2) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> D: down to (2,1), but (2,1) is the second segment of snake. But can I move to tail? Generally, moving to the tail is allowed because the tail will move, so unless it causes collision, it might be ok.\n> \n> The rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, and the tail moves away, it might be safe, but only if it's the tail and not other body parts.\n> \n> Specifically, moving to the tail cell is ok because after the move, the tail moves, so head is on that cell, and tail is gone.\n> \n> But in this case, current tail is at (1,5), but (2,1) is not tail; it's the second segment.\n> \n> Let's list snake positions: indices: 0: head (2,2), 1: (2,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (5,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (4,3), 8: (4,4), 9: (4,5), 10: (3,5), 11: (2,5), 12: tail (1,5)\n> \n> So positions: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)\n> \n> If I move down to (2,1), (2,1) is the first body segment, not the tail.

So no issue.\n> \n> Then from there, can move, but (2,6) is top row, y=6, walls at y=7, so y=6 is safe, but moving Up would go to (2,7), which is wall, not allowed. So from (2,6), can only move Left to (1,6), Down to (2,5), or Right to (3,6). But (2,5) is now body, occupied.\n> \n> After eating, positions: (2,6) head, (2,5) body, so (2,5) occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,6): Left to (1,6), or Right to (3,6), or Down to (2,5) but that's body, collision, death.

Life span: on turn 47, life span 3, after turn 47, if not eaten, life span 2 on turn 48, after turn 48, life span 1 on turn 49, after turn 49, life span 0, gone. So last chance turn 49.

After eating at (2,6), positions: head (2,6), body1 (2,5), body2 (2,4), body3 (2,3), body4 (2,2), body5 (2,1), body6 (3,1), body7 (4,1), body8 (5,1), body9 (5,2), body10 (4,2), body11 (4,3), body12 (4,4), body13 (4,5), tail body14 (3,5)? I think I have confusion.\n> \n> After eating at (2,6) on turn 49: positions fixed: head (2,6), then the previous head position becomes body, so (2,5) body1, then previous body segments: (2,4) body2, (2,3) body3, (2,2) body4, (2,1) body5, (3,1) body6, (4,1) body7, (5,1) body8, (5,2) body9, (4,2) body10, (4,3) body11, (4,4) body12, (4,5) body13, and the previous tail (3,5) is body14. So 14 segments, tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Then turn 50: move Left to (1,6). (1,6) free, no food, so head to (1,6), body shifts: new body1 (2,6), new body2 (2,5), new body3 (2,4), ..., up to new body13 (4,5), and new body14 (3,5) removed, so tail is removed.

Head and 13 body segments? After move, no food, length same, so 14 segments: head (1,6), then the previous positions except tail removed, so body: (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) was body13, but since tail removed, (4,5) becomes the new tail?

For example, at turn 49, food with life_span 1 will be gone by turn 50 if not eaten on turn 49.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span 4 means it will disappear after 4 turns, so after turn 52 if not eaten.\n> \n> But eating happens when the head moves onto the food cell on that turn.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,4), moving right. So from (3,4), possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But current direction is R, so I can't instantly reverse to L, meaning I can't go left on the next turn.\n> \n> Movement constraints: No instant reverse. So from R, I can go U, D, or R, but not L.\n> \n> Now, let's list the possible moves from current position (3,4):\n> \n> - Up: (3,5)\n> \n> - Down: (3,3)\n> \n> - Right: (4,4)\n> \n> - Left: (2,4) but (2,4) is occupied by the snake body, the second segment.\n> \n> (2,4) is the first body segment right after head. Head is at (3,4), then (2,4), so (2,4) is occupied.\n> \n> Can I move to (2,4)? According to rules, moving into the tail segment is allowed only if the tail moves away, but here it's not the tail; it's a body segment.\n> \n> Deadly collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But exception: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (4,5)? Snake positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> (4,5) is the last position.\n> \n> Now, (2,4) is the second segment, not the tail.\n> \n> If I move left to (2,4), that would be head colliding with body segment, which is deadly. So I cannot move left.\n> \n> Similarly, moving up to (3,5): is that free? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (3,5) is within bounds, y=5<7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so (3,5) should be fine.\n> \n> Down to (3,3): similarly, within bounds.\n> \n> Right to (4,4): (4,4) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: ... (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — (4,4) is the 12th segment? Let's index:\n> \n> Index: 0: (3,4) head\n> \n> 1: (2,4)\n> \n> 2: (2,3)\n> \n> 3: (2,2)\n> \n> 4: (2,1)\n> \n> 5: (3,1)\n> \n> 6: (4,1)\n> \n> 7: (5,1)\n> \n> 8: (5,2)\n> \n> 9: (4,2)\n> \n> 10: (4,3)\n> \n> 11: (4,4)\n> \n> 12: (4,5) tail\n> \n> So (4,4) is position 11, which is a body segment, not tail. Tail is (4,5).\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (4,4) would be colliding with body, deadly. Cannot move right to (4,4).\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (2,4) is to segment 1, deadly.\n> \n> Now, moving up to (3,5): is (3,5) occupied? From the list, no, (3,5) is not in snake positions. Walls: no wall at (3,5), borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, internal obstacle at (3,2), so (3,5) is free.\n> \n> Moving down to (3,3): similarly, not occupied, no wall.\n> \n> But internal obstacle is at (3,2), so (3,3) is fine.\n> \n> So possible moves: Up to (3,5) or Down to (3,3). Cannot go left or right due to body collision.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so no reverse issue since I'm not going left.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (2,6) value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (1,1) value 1, life_span 4\n> \n> - (5,4) value 1, life_span 7\n> \n> - (2,4) value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> (2,4) is currently occupied by the snake body. The rule says: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Currently, (2,4) has food, but it's under the snake body. So to eat it, the snake must move away from (2,4), and then later head moves to it.\n> \n> But life_span is 10, so it has time.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> Now, (2,6) has life_span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. Since life_span decreases every turn including current, at turn 49, if not eaten, it will be gone by turn 50.\n> \n> Can I eat it now? (2,6) is at x=2,y=6.\n> \n> Head at (3,4). To reach (2,6), I need to go left and up or something, but from (3,4), I can only go up or down immediately, not left or right as we saw.\n> \n> If I go up to (3,5), then from there, I could go left to (2,5) or up to (3,6), etc., but (2,6) is at (2,6), which is adjacent to (2,5) or (3,6)? (2,6) is adjacent to (2,5) down, (1,6) left, (2,7) up? y=7 is wall, so (2,7) is invalid.\n> \n> y=7 is border wall, so y=7 is out of bounds.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0,7 walls.\n> \n> (2,6) is at y=6, which is one below y=7 wall.\n> \n> To reach (2,6) from (3,4) in one move: not possible, since not adjacent. Adjacent cells are (3,5), (3,3), (4,4), (2,4), but (4,4) and (2,4) occupied, so only (3,5) and (3,3) possible.\n> \n> (2,6) is two moves away at minimum. For example, go up to (3,5), then left to (2,5), then up to (2,6)? (2,5) to (2,6) is up, but y increases up? U is (x,y+1), so from (2,5) to (2,6) is U.\n> \n> But from current position, even if I go up to (3,5) now, then on turn 50, I can go left to (2,5), but (2,6) has life_span 1, so if not eaten on turn 49, it disappears, so on turn 50 it's gone. I can't eat it on turn 50.\n> \n> Life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 49, life_span=1, after turn 49, if not eaten, it disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 49, which is now.\n> \n> But I can't reach it in one move from (3,4) since it's not adjacent. Distance: from (3,4) to (2,6) is Δx=1, Δy=2, so at least two moves, like left then up, but I can't go left directly, and even if I could, (2,4) is occupied, so impossible to reach in one move. Therefore, I cannot eat (2,6) on this turn. It will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> So (2,6) is not accessible now, and will be gone.\n> \n> Now, other foods.\n> \n> (1,1) at x=1,y=1, life_span 4, so available for turns 49,50,51,52, disappears after turn 52.\n> \n> (5,4) at x=5,y=4, life_span 7, available longer.\n> \n> (2,4) at x=2,y=4, but currently occupied by snake body segment, so cannot eat now; need to move away and come back later.\n> \n> Life_span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Current snake head at (3,4), can move to (3,5) or (3,3).\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, and internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n> \n> So body covers a path.\n> \n> Food: (2,6), (1,1), (5,4), and (2,4) but (2,4) has food under it, but occupied.\n> \n> Since (2,4) has food, when the snake moves, if the body leaves (2,4), that cell will have food, and if head moves there later, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But for now, let's consider moves.\n> \n> Options: Up or Down.\n> \n> If I go Up to (3,5):\n> \n> - Turn 49: move U to (3,5)\n> \n> Then snake: head at (3,5), body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), ..., tail (4,5)?

No.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So from positions: before move: head (3,4), seg1 (2,4), seg2 (2,3), ..., seg12 (4,5)\n> \n> After move U to (3,5): new head at (3,5), then seg1 was (2,4) but now it moves to the previous head position (3,4), so new seg1: (3,4)\n> \n> Then seg2 moves to previous seg1 position (2,4), so new seg2: (2,4)\n> \n> Similarly, seg3 to (2,3), and so on, up to seg12 to previous seg11 position?

Snake positions: head at (3,5), then body segments: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). That's 13 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, which is towards increasing y, so from (3,5), moving Up would go to (3,6), but y=6 is within bounds since walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 is playable? Let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). Yes.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 4. Life span means it disappears after 4 turns, including the current turn. So at turn 50, life span 4, it will disappear after turn 53? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it's gone at turn t + N.\n> \n> If life span is 4 at turn 50, then:\n> \n> - Turn 50: life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 51: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 52: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 53: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 54: life span 0, so it disappears at the start of turn 54? Or after turn 53? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> It says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, with life span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1. After L decreases, when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (1,1): turn 50, life span 4. After turn 50, life span 3; after turn 51, life span 2; after turn 52, life span 1; after turn 53, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 54. So it can be eaten from turn 50 to turn 53 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) with value 1, life span 6 at turn 50. So it will disappear after turn 55 (since 50+6=56, but let's count: turn 50 L=6, turn 51 L=5, ..., turn 55 L=1, turn 56 L=0 disappear? After turn 55, L=1? Turn 50: L=4 for (1,1), so after turn 50, L=3; so at the start of turn, life span is given, then after the turn, it decreases.\n> \n> The state is given at turn t, before action. So at turn 50, life span is 4 for (1,1), meaning it can be eaten on turns 50,51,52,53. On turn 54, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) L=6, can be eaten turns 50 to 55.\n> \n> And (2,4) with value 1, life span 9, so turns 50 to 58.\n> \n> Now, (2,4) is interesting because it's listed as a food position, but in the snake positions, (2,4) is the third segment of the snake. Snake positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), then (2,4). So (2,4) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (2,4), since it's under the snake body, it can only be eaten if that body segment moves away and then the head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 50, snake has segments: index 0: head (3,5), 1: (3,4), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,3), etc.\n> \n> So (2,4) is occupied by segment 2.\n> \n> If the snake moves such that segment 2 moves away from (2,4), then (2,4) becomes empty, and if later the head moves to (2,4), it can eat the food.\n> \n> But the food is at (2,4) with life span 9, so we have time.\n> \n> Now, head direction is Up, so from (3,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: since head direction is U, cannot move D (down) next, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So possible actions: U (up to (3,6)), L (left to (2,5)), R (right to (4,5)).

(3,5) and (4,4): delta x=1, delta y=-1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means same row or column, adjacent cells, so (3,5) adjacent are (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5). Tail at (4,4) is not adjacent to head; it's diagonal. So not adjacent, so no immediate danger from that.\n> \n> But if we eat food, the tail might not move, but when we eat, the tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to food, it eats, length increases, and the new segment is added, but tail stays, so the position where food was becomes new tail or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> From the rules: when eating positive food, \"Length of snake +1\", so after eating, the snake grows by one segment. So when head moves to food cell, it consumes the food, and a new segment is added at the end, so the tail doesn't move that turn? Or the tail moves, but an extra segment is added.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail position remains, and snake grows.\n> \n> But in terms of movement: normally, each turn, head moves to new cell, each segment follows, tail moves away.\n> \n> When you eat, head moves to food, but instead of tail moving, a new segment is added at the position where tail was going to move from or something. I need to think.\n> \n> Standard behavior: on a turn without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food cell, consumes it, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move; the snake grows by one, and the new tail is the old tail position.\n> \n> For example, if tail is at P, and head eats food at Q, then after move, head is at Q, the segment that was tail remains at P, and a new segment is added at P, so tail is still at P, but now there are two segments there? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake body is a list of positions. When moving without eating, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last position (tail) is vacated.\n> \n> When eating, the head moves to the food position, the body segments follow as usual, but the tail does not vacate; instead, the tail position remains occupied, and a new segment is added, so the snake length increases by one.\n> \n> Specifically: positions [head, seg1, seg2, ..., seg_k] with k segments after head? Let's say positions list: index 0 head, 1 to n-1 body, n-1 is tail.\n> \n> After move without eating: new head at new position, then seg1 to seg_{n-1} move to positions 0 to n-2, and tail (seg_{n-1}) moves to where seg_{n-2} was, so the old tail position is free.\n> \n> After move with eating: new head at food position, then seg1 to seg_{n-1} move to positions 0 to n-2, and a new segment is added at the old position of seg_{n-1} (tail), so now tail is at the old tail position, and length is n+1.\n> \n> So the cell that was tail remains occupied, and new tail is there.\n> \n> In this case, for tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it would mean head moves to adjacent cell where tail is? But tail is occupied, so head cannot move to tail position because it's occupied.\n> \n> The danger is when the food is on the tail cell, and head moves to it.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> So, scenario: tail is at position T, and there is food at T. Head is adjacent to T.\n> \n> If head moves to T to eat the food, then: head moves to T, consumes food, and since it ate, the snake grows, so a new segment is added at the old tail position, which is T. But now head is at T, and a new segment is added at T, so there are two segments at T? That can't be; it must be that the new segment is added after the move.\n> \n> I think the collision happens because after eating, the head is at T, and the new tail is at T, but since it's the same cell, it collides.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, head at H, tail at T, food at T.\n> \n> Head moves to T: now head is at T, but T was occupied by tail, so when head moves to T, it is moving to an occupied cell, which should be a collision. But the rule says \"can only be eaten if body moves away\", but here the body is tail, and it's moving away if we eat, but when we move to T, tail is still there, so it's occupied.\n> \n> The rule for food under body: \"can only be eaten if the body moves away, and head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For tail, when we move, the tail will move away only if we don't eat, but if we eat, the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> In this case, if food is on tail and head is adjacent, moving to it to eat: head moves to T, but T is occupied by tail, so collision before eating? That might be the issue.\n> \n> Perhaps the movement and eating are simultaneous, but it's messy.\n> \n> The \"Tail Reward Danger\" specifically says that eating it kills, so it's allowed to move to it, but then it causes death because of the growth.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, I'll assume that moving to a cell occupied by body is always deadly, except for the tail cell when it's about to move.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, generally, moving to body cell is deadly, except for the tail cell, because tail will move away, so if head moves to tail cell, it's ok, as long as no other collision.\n> \n> But in this case, if there is food on the tail cell, and head moves to it, it can eat the food, but then the danger is that after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head and new tail are at same position or something.\n> \n> Let's read the rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added, so if head moves to tail position, it was ok before eating because tail moves away, but if you eat, tail doesn't move, so after move, head is at the position, but tail is still there, so collision.\n> \n> Standard way: if no eat, head moves to new cell, tail moves away, so if head moves to where tail was, it's fine because tail leaves.\n> \n> If eat, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so if food was at tail, head moves to tail position, which is now free because tail is about to move, but if we eat, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Before move: head at H, tail at T, food at T.\n> \n> - Move: head moves to T. Since T is tail, and tail will move if no eat, but if we eat, we don't move tail.\n> \n> When head moves to T, it consumes the food at T, then since food is eaten, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added at the old tail position. But head is now at T, and tail is at T, so they are at the same cell, collision.\n> \n> If no food, head moves to T, tail moves to its next position, so T is vacated.\n> \n> But with food, tail stays, so head and tail at same cell.\n> \n> That's the danger.\n> \n> In this state, for (2,4), it's food under body, not tail, so different.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,4), no food there.\n> \n> Food at (2,4) is under a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> So for (2,4), to eat it, we need the body to move away first, then head move to it.\n> \n> Now, back to current turn.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, L, R.\n> \n> Let's evaluate each.\n> \n> First, move U to (3,6).\n> \n> Then snake head to (3,6), body follows: seg1 to (3,5), seg2 to (3,4), ..., and tail (4,4) moves to (4,3)?

After turn 53, gone. So must be eaten on or before turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) life 5: turns 51-55, eat by turn 55.\n> \n> (2,4) life 8: turns 51-58, eat by turn 58.\n> \n> (2,4) is currently under snake body, segment 3: (2,4).\n> \n> So to eat it, the snake must move away so that (2,4) is vacated, then head moves back when food is there.\n> \n> But food is already there, under the body, so when the body moves away, the food is revealed, and head can move to it.\n> \n> But only if head moves onto it after it's free.\n> \n> Now, the segment at (2,4) is the fourth segment. When snake moves, depending on direction, it might move away.\n> \n> Current snake: head (4,5) R, so moving R would move the body segments.\n> \n> For example, if I move R to (5,5), then as above, new positions: body4 is at (2,4)? In the new positions after move R: segment 4 is at old segment 3 (2,4), so (2,4) is still occupied, but by a different segment.\n> \n> The cell (2,4) is still occupied after move, unless the segment there moves.\n> \n> In this case, when snake moves right, the segment that was at (2,4) moves to where? Old segment 3 is at (2,4), after move, new segment 4 is at old segment 3 (2,4), so (2,4) is still occupied by the new segment 4. The position doesn't change immediately.\n> \n> The cell (2,4) is occupied by a body segment both before and after the move, since it's not the tail moving away.\n> \n> To free (2,4), the snake needs to move in a way that the segment at (2,4) moves to another cell.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves down or something.\n> \n> But (2,4) is held by segment, which is part of the body.\n> \n> The segment at (2,4) will only move when the snake moves, and it moves to the position of the previous segment ahead.\n> \n> So to free (2,4), we need the body to move so that the segment leaves that cell.\n> \n> For instance, if the head moves in a direction that causes the body to shift, and the segment at (2,4) moves to, say, (2,3) or whatever.\n> \n> But (2,3) is currently occupied by another segment? Current positions: (2,3) is segment 4? Indices: 0: (4,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (3,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,3), 5: (2,2), etc.\n> \n> So (2,4) is segment 3.\n> \n> If head moves, say, down to (4,4), then new head (4,4), body1: old head (4,5), body2: old body1 (3,5), body3: old body2 (3,4), body4: old body3 (2,4), so (2,4) is still occupied by body4.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves right to (5,5), body3: old body2 (3,4), body4: old body3 (2,4), still occupied.\n> \n> If head moves up to (4,6), body1: (4,5), body2: (3,5), body3: (3,4), body4: (2,4), same.\n> \n> So in all cases, after one move, (2,4) is still occupied because it's not the tail, and the segments are just shifting.\n> \n> The only way to free (2,4) is to have the segment that is there move to a different position, which requires the snake to move multiple times so that the body segment at (2,4) advances to the next position.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves in a direction that causes the body to flow, eventually the segment at (2,4) will move to where the previous segment was.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, each segment moves to the position of the segment ahead of it.\n> \n> So the segment at position i moves to position i-1's old position when the snake moves.\n> \n> So for segment at (2,4), which is index 3, it will move to where index 2 was, which is (3,4) currently.\n> \n> Currently, index 2 is at (3,4).\n> \n> So when snake moves, segment at (2,4) (index 3) moves to the old position of index 2, which is (3,4).\n> \n> But (3,4) might be occupied, but after move, it moves there.\n> \n> So after one move, the cell (2,4) is vacated only if no segment moves to it, but in this case, after move, new segment 4 moves to old position of segment 3, which is (2,4), so it stays occupied.\n> \n> Let's think: when snake moves, the head moves to new cell, then each subsequent segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> For a cell to be vacated, it must be the old tail position, because the tail moves away and no one moves to the old tail cell.\n> \n> Other cells may stay occupied if the body segments shift to them.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell not the tail, if it was occupied by segment k, after move, it might be occupied by segment k+1 or something.\n> \n> In this case, (2,4) is occupied by segment 3. After move, the new segment 4 is at the old position of segment 3, which is (2,4), so (2,4) is now occupied by segment 4, so the cell is still occupied.\n> \n> The only cell that is freed is the old tail position.\n> \n> For (2,4) to be free, it needs to be the tail at some point, or the snake moves in a way that the segment leaves and no one comes.\n> \n> But since the body is connected, when the snake moves, the segments shift, so internal cells remain occupied unless the snake shortens or something, but here no eating, so length constant.\n> \n> So (2,4) will only be free when the tail moves away from its current position, but tail is at (4,3), not at (2,4).\n> \n> To free (2,4), we need the segment that is currently at (2,4) to move to another cell and no segment to move to (2,4).\n> \n> That happens when the segment at (2,4) moves to the position of the segment ahead, and the position behind is not filled because it's not the tail or something.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves, the segment at (2,4) moves to (3,4), and the cell (2,4) is left empty if no segment moves to it. But since segment 4 was at (2,3), it moves to (2,4)? Let's not confuse.\n> \n> After a move, the cells that were occupied by body segments except the tail may be reoccupied if the snake doesn't turn sharply, but in general, for a cell to be vacated, it must be that the segment that was there moves away and no other segment moves to it in the same move.\n> \n> In snake movement, when the head moves, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment immediately ahead of it. So the cell that was occupied by the segment ahead is now occupied by this segment.\n> \n> For cell (2,4), it is currently occupied by segment 3. Segment 3 will move to the old position of segment 2, which is (3,4). So after move, segment 3 is at (3,4), and cell (2,4) is now occupied by segment 4, which moves to the old position of segment 3, which is (2,4). So (2,4) is still occupied.\n> \n> The only cell that is not reoccupied is the old position of the tail, because no segment moves to it.\n> \n> To free (2,4), we need the tail to be at (2,4) at some point, so that when the tail moves, it vacates.\n> \n> But currently tail is at (4,3), so it will take many moves for the tail to reach (2,4) or for the segment to be shed.\n> \n> Since the food is under (2,4), and it's positive, to eat it, we need to have the head move to (2,4) when it is free and food is there.\n> \n> But food is already there with life span 8, so we have time.\n> \n> For now, it's not accessible immediately.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,1) is free, but far.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is free and close.\n> \n> So probably best to go for (5,4) first.\n> \n> Let's plan to eat (5,4).\n> \n> From current position (4,5), I can go D to (4,4) or R to (5,5), then to (5,4).\n> \n> If I go D to (4,4), then from there, I can go R to (5,4) to eat on turn 52.\n> \n> If I go R to (5,5), then D to (5,4) on turn 52.\n> \n> But if I go R to (5,5), then on turn 52, I go D to (5,4), eat.\n> \n> If I go D to (4,4), then turn 52 go R to (5,4), eat.\n> \n> But after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n> \n> Now, which one is better?\n> \n> Also, need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Moreover, there's the food at (1,1) with short life.\n> \n> If I go for (5,4) immediately, I can eat it on turn 52.\n> \n> Then on turn 52, after eating, head at (5,4), and snake has 14 segments.\n> \n> Then I can think about (1,1).\n> \n> But (1,1) is at (1,1), from (5,4), distance |5-1| + |4-1| = 4+3=7, but with obstacles.\n> \n> Grid: internal obstacle at (3,2), which is in the way.\n> \n> Path from (5,4) to (1,1).\n> \n> Possible paths: for example, go left to (4,4), (3,4), but (3,4) is currently occupied, but may move.\n> \n> Or go down, but y=1 is bottom.\n> \n> Since time is short for (1,1), I need to move towards it soon.\n> \n> Current turn 51, must eat by turn 53.\n> \n> If I eat (5,4) on turn 52, that's turn 52, then on turn 53 I need to be at (1,1) to eat it, but from (5,4) to (1,1) in one move?

Rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - (5,5) head\n> \n> - (4,5) body\n> \n> - (3,5) body\n> \n> - (3,4) body\n> \n> - (2,4) body\n> \n> - (2,3) body\n> \n> - (2,2) body\n> \n> - (2,1) body\n> \n> - (3,1) body\n> \n> - (4,1) body\n> \n> - (5,1) body\n> \n> - (5,2) body\n> \n> - (4,2) tail\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (1,1) - but snake has body at (2,1), (3,1), etc. (1,1) is a cell. Is it occupied? Food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten when head moves there after body moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (1,1) has food, but is there body there? Snake positions: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) are body, but not (1,1). (1,1) is empty? Let's see.\n> \n> List all snake positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)\n> \n> So (1,1) is not occupied by snake, I think. x=1,y=1: not in the list. (2,1) is occupied, but (1,1) is free. Similarly, (1,1) has food.\n> \n> (2,4) has food? Food at (2,4), but snake has a body segment at (2,4)? Positions: (2,4) is the fifth segment. Food is at (2,4) with value 1, life span 7.\n> \n> But if there is a body segment at (2,4), and food is there, it means the food is under the body. So it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves in later.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (5,4) - is it occupied? Snake at (5,5), (4,5), etc., not at (5,4), so free cell? (5,4) not in positions, so free.\n> \n> (6,3) free.\n> \n> (1,1) free, but food there.\n> \n> Now, for (2,4), since body is there, food is hidden, can't be eaten now.\n> \n> Back to head at (5,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,6) - is this valid? y=6, y=7 is border, but (5,6) is within bounds? x=5,y=6, y=6 is not y=7, so it should be ok, unless wall. Walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (5,6) is not wall. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not here. Also, is it occupied by body? Positions: (5,5), (4,5), etc., no (5,6), so free? But food? No food at (5,6), I think. Food at (1,1), (5,4), (2,4), (6,3). So (5,6) empty.\n> \n> But moving to (5,6): is it safe? No body there, no wall, so ok.\n> \n> - D: (5,4) - ah, (5,4) has food! And it's a free cell, no body. So moving down to (5,4) would eat the food, since head moves there.\n> \n> - R: (6,5) - x=6,y=5. x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not x=7, so ok. Is it occupied? No, free. Food? No, food at (6,3) is different.\n> \n> (6,5) no food.\n> \n> - L: not possible, opposite direction.\n> \n> So immediate moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> D leads to food at (5,4).\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because after growing, tail doesn't move, so head collides.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,2), I think. Positions: last is (4,2), so tail at (4,2).\n> \n> Head at (5,5), not adjacent to (4,2). Adjacent means sharing side, so (5,5) and (4,2): delta x=1, delta y=3, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,4) is below head, so moving D would eat it immediately.\n> \n> But is it safe? After eating, snake grows, so new tail added, but since we eat, length increases.\n> \n> Current length 13, after eating, length 14.\n> \n> But I need to consider future moves.\n> \n> Also, other food: (1,1) with short life, only 2 turns left, so must be eaten by turn 53 or it disappears.\n> \n> (2,4) has food but body is there, so need to move body away first.\n> \n> (6,3) has long life.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the board.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all border cells, so cannot go to x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7. So playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are invalid. Similarly y=0 or y=7 invalid.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so (3,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake body:\n> \n> - Head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Body: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)\n> \n> So the snake is coiled around, from (5,5) right, to (4,5) left, to (3,5) down to (3,4)? (3,5) to (3,4) is down, then (3,4) to (2,4) left, then (2,4) to (2,3) down, to (2,2) down, to (2,1) down, then (2,1) to (3,1) right, to (4,1) right, to (5,1) right, to (5,2) up, to (4,2) left? (5,2) to (4,2) is left.\n> \n> Tail at (4,2).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,1): value 1, life span 2 (disappears after turn 53)\n> \n> - (5,4): value 1, life span 4 (disappears after turn 55)\n> \n> - (2,4): value 1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 58) but currently occupied by body at (2,4)? Position (2,4) is part of body, index 5. So food is under it, not accessible now.\n> \n> - (6,3): value 1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 61)\n> \n> Now, for (2,4), since body is there, to eat that food, we need the body to move away, then head to move there. But when body moves away, the food becomes visible, and we can eat it if head goes there.\n> \n> But life span is long, 7 turns, so we have time.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) has short life, only 2 turns, so we might want to eat it soon if possible.\n> \n> But (1,1) is at bottom left.\n> \n> Head at (5,5), (1,1) is far.\n> \n> Possible to go there in 2 turns? From (5,5) to (1,1): minimum Manhattan distance |5-1| + |5-1| = 4+4=8, so at least 8 moves away, not possible in 2 turns. So we can't eat (1,1) before it disappears? Turn 52, life span 2: can be eaten on turn 52 or 53? But on turn 52, head is at (5,5), to reach (1,1) in one move? Impossible, too far. Even in two moves, from (5,5) to (1,1) in two moves? Minimum 4 steps in x and 4 in y, so impossible in 2 moves. So (1,1) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after turn 53 without being eaten, since snake can't reach it in time.\n> \n> Similarly, turn 53: if we move towards it, but on turn 52, we are at (5,5), after move, say to (5,4) or (6,5) or (5,6), then on turn 53, from there, to (1,1) still far. For example, from (5,4) to (1,1) is |4| + |3| =7, min 7 moves, but on turn 53 it can be eaten, but after turn 53 it disappears, so last chance turn 53. But from any position after turn 52, distance to (1,1) is at least 4 in x or y, so impossible to reach on turn 53. Thus, (1,1) food is unreachable and will expire without being eaten. Ignore it.\n> \n> Now, (5,4) is directly below head, so we can eat it on turn 52 by moving D.\n> \n> But should we?\n> \n> After eating, snake grows to 14 segments. Head at (5,4), then body: previous head (5,5) becomes new segment 2, and so on, up to tail (4,2) with new segment added? When we eat, the tail doesn't move immediately; the head moves to food, and we add a new segment where the tail was, but since tail moves, it's a bit different.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head eats food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> In terms of positions: on turn when eating, head moves to food cell, and the body moves, but tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> For example, current positions: let's denote S0 = (5,5), S1=(4,5), ..., S12=(4,2) tail.\n> \n> If we move D to (5,4) and eat food, then new head is (5,4), and S0 becomes part of body, so new positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), ..., up to tail (4,2) and since we ate, tail doesn't move, so we add a new tail at (4,2)? No.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows: the head moves to the food, and the body follows, but the tail end doesn't advance, so the new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So positions: after move, head is new position, then previous head, then previous body segments except the tail stays for one more turn? I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard mechanics: when snake eats food, on that turn, head moves to food, body moves as usual, but the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment at the tail position.\n> \n> For example, before move: segments P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n> \n> After move without eating: head moves to new cell, P0 becomes body, P1 to Pk move, tail Pk moves away.\n> \n> With eating: head moves to new cell (food), P0 becomes body, P1 to Pk-1 move, but Pk (tail) does not move, so new positions: new head, P0, P1, ..., Pk (now body), and Pk is still there, but with the new segment, so length k+2? Let's think indices.\n> \n> Suppose k segments, positions at time t: H_t, B1_t, B2_t, ..., T_t\n> \n> At time t+1, if no eat: H_{t+1} = move, B1_{t+1} = H_t, B2_{t+1} = B1_t, ..., T_{t+1} = B_{k-1}_t or something.\n> \n> Assume snake has N segments.\n> \n> After move without eating: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment moves away from its position.\n> \n> With eating: head moves to food, each body segment moves to previous position of segment ahead, but the tail segment does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added there, so the tail remains, and the snake grows.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food, then the previous head position, then the previous position of body1, etc., and the tail position is the same as before, with the new segment.\n> \n> In terms of list: after eating, the position list has the new head, then all previous positions except the tail is duplicated or something.\n> \n> Easier: after move with eat, the snake has one more segment; the head is at new position, the body includes all previous positions, so the tail is the previous tail, not moved.\n> \n> For example, current: positions: H, B1, B2, ..., T (13 segments)\n> \n> After moving down to (5,4) and eating:\n> \n> New head: (5,4)\n> \n> New body segments: H becomes first body, so (5,5), then B1 was (4,5), becomes second body, and so on, up to T was (4,2), but since we ate, T does not move, so T is still (4,2), and it is now part of body, with a new tail at (4,2)? No.\n> \n> The new positions: head at (5,4), then the previous head (5,5) is now body segment 1, previous B1 (4,5) is now body segment 2, ..., previous T (4,2) is now body segment 12, and since we ate, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, so new tail at (4,2), but the previous tail is still there as body segment 12, and new tail at same position? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard way: when snake eats, the tail does not move on that turn, so the cell that was tail remains occupied, and the head moves to food, so the snake extends by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So the position of the tail does not change; it stays, and the head moves forward.\n> \n> In the list, the new positions are: new head position, then all previous positions from head to tail, so the tail position is included twice? No.\n> \n> For example, suppose simple snake: head at (2,2), body at (2,1), tail at (2,1)? Better to have multiple.\n> \n> Suppose head (3,3), body (3,2), tail (3,1).\n> \n> Move down to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, so if no food, cannot. Assume (3,4) has food.\n> \n> Move down to (3,4) eat food. Then new head (3,4), new body: previous head (3,3) is now first body, previous body (3,2) is now second body, and previous tail (3,1) is still tail, but since we ate, tail does not move, so positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), body (3,2), tail (3,1). Length 4 now.\n> \n> Previously length 3: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)\n> \n> After eating at (3,4): head to (3,4), body to (3,3), body to (3,2), and tail stays at (3,1), so positions (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) — now tail is (3,1).\n> \n> The cell (3,1) was tail, still is tail, not moved.\n> \n> In terms of segments, we have added a new segment at the head, but the tail didn't advance.\n> \n> In this case, the position that was occupied by body or tail is still occupied.\n> \n> Back to our case.\n> \n> Current positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)\n> \n> After moving down to (5,4) and eating food there:\n> \n> New head at (5,4)\n> \n> Then previous head (5,5) becomes new body segment 1\n> \n> Previous body segment 1 (4,5) becomes new body segment 2\n> \n> Previous body segment 2 (3,5) becomes new body segment 3\n> \n> Previous body segment 3 (3,4) becomes new body segment 4\n> \n> Previous body segment 4 (2,4) becomes new body segment 5\n> \n> And so on, up to previous body segment 11 (5,2) becomes new body segment 12\n> \n> Previous tail (4,2) becomes new body segment 13\n> \n> And since we ate, we add a new tail at the position where the tail was, so new tail at (4,2)\n> \n> So new positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), body (4,5), body (3,5), body (3,4), body (2,4), body (2,3), body (2,2), body (2,1), body (3,1), body (4,1), body (5,1), body (5,2), body (4,2)  -- this is body segment 13, and new tail at (4,2)? But (4,2) is already occupied by body segment 13.\n> \n> That can't be; two segments at same position.\n> \n> I think I confused the indices.\n> \n> Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> At turn 52, positions: index 0: (5,5) head, 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (3,4), 4: (2,4), 5: (2,3), 6: (2,2), 7: (2,1), 8: (3,1), 9: (4,1), 10: (5,1), 11: (5,2), 12: (4,2) tail.\n> \n> After moving down, head to (5,4), which is new position.\n> \n> Then, the new body: segment 0 moves to where head was, so (5,5) becomes body segment 1.\n> \n> Segment 1 (4,5) becomes body segment 2.\n> \n> Segment 2 (3,5) becomes body segment 3.\n> \n> Segment 3 (3,4) becomes body segment 4.\n> \n> Segment 4 (2,4) becomes body segment 5.\n> \n> Segment 5 (2,3) becomes body segment 6.\n> \n> Segment 6 (2,2) becomes body segment 7.\n> \n> Segment 7 (2,1) becomes body segment 8.\n> \n> Segment 8 (3,1) becomes body segment 9.\n> \n> Segment 9 (4,1) becomes body segment 10.\n> \n> Segment 10 (5,1) becomes body segment 11.\n> \n> Segment 11 (5,2) becomes body segment 12.\n> \n> Segment 12 (4,2) was tail, but since we ate, it does not move, so it becomes body segment 13, and a new segment is added at (4,2) for the tail? No.\n> \n> When eating, the tail segment stays in place, so the position (4,2) is still occupied by the tail, but it is now part of the body, and the new tail is at the same position? That doesn't work.\n> \n> I think the correct way is: after moving and eating, the head is at the new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, but the tail segment does not advance, so the last body segment position is duplicated for the new tail.\n> \n> In terms of list, the new position list is: [new_head] + previous_positions[0:-1]  # in Python notation, previous positions from head to tail, but excluding the last one?

But life span 6, so it has 6 turns including this one? Rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after N turns\" means after N turns from now, it disappears. But \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: at the start of turn, life_span is current, and after the turn, it decreases. If life_span is 1, it can be eaten during this turn, then disappears.\n> \n> The input says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" for current turn, so at turn t, life_span is given, and it decreases each turn.\n> \n> For food at (1,1): life_span 1 at turn 53, so after turn 53, it disappears. So it can be eaten only on turn 53, but since head is far, impossible, so gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4): life_span 6 at turn 53, so it will last until turn 53 + 6 - 1 = 58? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 53: life_span=6, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 53, life_span decreases to 5? Or after the turn?\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so during turn t, life_span is L, then after turn t, it becomes L-1.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" might mean it exists for N turns, including the current one if N>0.\n> \n> Standard way: if life_span is N at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears after turn t+N-1.\n> \n> For example, life_span=1: exists only at turn t, can be eaten on turn t.\n> \n> Life_span=2: exists at turn t and t+1, can be eaten on turn t or t+1.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - (1,1): life_span=1 at turn 53, so can be eaten only on turn 53. Since head is at (5,4), distance |5-1| + |4-1| = 4+3=7, too far, impossible to eat this turn. So it will be gone.\n> \n> - (2,4): life_span=6 at turn 53, so can be eaten on turns 53 to 58 (since 53+5=58, turn 53 to 58 is 6 turns: 53,54,55,56,57,58).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3): life_span=9, can be eaten from turn 53 to 61.\n> \n> Now, (2,4) is currently occupied by the snake body.

Positions: index 0: head (5,4), 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,4), 5: (2,4), ... so (2,4) is the 5th body segment, but in terms of position, it's occupied.\n> \n> To eat the food at (2,4), we need to move the body away first. That means the snake must move such that the segment at (2,4) is no longer there, i.e., the tail moves or something.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, each turn the tail moves forward, so if the snake doesn't grow, the tail moves, so positions shift.\n> \n> But to eat food under body, we need the cell to be vacated before head moves there.\n> \n> Specifically, for (2,4), if the snake moves and the segment at (2,4) moves away, then later head can move to (2,4) to eat food.\n> \n> But since the food is at (2,4), and it's under body, we need to time it so that when body leaves, head can come.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> That means, if tail has food and head eats it while adjacent, after eating, the tail doesn't move away, so head and tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,4), it's not the tail; tail is at (4,2). So no immediate danger, but we need to plan to free the cell.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,3) is free, not under body.\n> \n> (6,3) is at x=6,y=3, and head at (5,4), so adjacent? |5-6|=1, |4-3|=1, so not adjacent, diagonal, not adjacent for move; adjacent means sharing edge, so (5,4) to (6,3) is diagonal, not directly adjacent. Adjacent cells are (5,3), (4,4), (6,4), (5,5) but (5,5) is body.\n> \n> From (5,4), adjacent cells: up (5,5) but that's body and current direction down, so cannot go up; down (5,3), left (4,4), right (6,4).\n> \n> (6,3) is not adjacent; to go to (6,3), from (5,4), I need to go down to (5,3) then right to (6,3), or right to (6,4) then down to (6,3), etc.\n> \n> Now, back to choosing action for turn 53.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible actions: D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n> \n> Let's evaluate each:\n> \n> Option 1: Move Down to (5,3)\n> \n> - New head position: (5,3)\n> \n> - Since no food there, snake does not grow, so tail moves away. Current tail is (4,2), so after move, new positions: head (5,3), then the previous head (5,4) becomes body, so body: (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), and tail was (4,2), but since no growth, the last segment is removed, so new tail is (5,2) or what?\n> \n> Snake positions: after moving down to (5,3), the new head is (5,3), and the body starts from the old head (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), ..., up to (5,2), but (5,2) was second last, and (4,2) was tail. Since no growth, the tail (4,2) is removed, so the new body is from (5,4) to (5,2), but (5,2) is now the last segment? List:\n> \n> Previous positions: indices 0: (5,4) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (2,3), 7: (2,2), 8: (2,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (4,1), 11: (5,1), 12: (5,2), 13: (4,2) tail.\n> \n> After move down to (5,3), new head at (5,3), then the segment that was head becomes body, so position 0: (5,3) new head, position 1: old head (5,4), position 2: (5,5), position 3: (4,5), ..., position 12: (5,2), and position 13: (4,2) is removed since no growth. So new body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2). New tail is (5,2).\n> \n> Length still 14? 13 body segments + head = 14, yes.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,4) is still there, occupied? (2,4) is position 5 in new list? New positions: head (5,3), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2) tail. So (2,4) is still occupied by body, at index 6? Let's index: after head (5,3), body: 1:(5,4), 2:(5,5), 3:(4,5), 4:(3,5), 5:(3,4), 6:(2,4), 7:(2,3), etc. So (2,4) is body segment.\n> \n> Food at (6,3) is free.\n> \n> Option 2: Move Left to (4,4)\n> \n> New head at (4,4)\n> \n> No food there, so no growth, tail removed.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,4), body: old head (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2). Tail was (4,2) removed, new tail (5,2).\n> \n> (4,4) was empty, so no collision.\n> \n> Food at (2,4) still occupied.\n> \n> Option 3: Move Right to (6,4)\n> \n> New head at (6,4)\n> \n> No food, no growth, tail removed.\n> \n> New positions: head (6,4), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2). New tail (5,2).\n> \n> (6,4) is free.\n> \n> Food at (6,3) is at (6,3), which is below (6,4), so if I go right to (6,4), I can consider going down to (6,3) next turn to eat food.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Now, the food at (1,1) is gone after this turn, so no issue.\n> \n> Priority is to eat food and avoid risks.\n> \n> But (2,4) food is under body, so I need to free it first.\n> \n> How to free (2,4)? Currently occupied by a body segment. Since the snake moves, and if no growth, the tail moves, so eventually, as the snake moves, the body segment at (2,4) will move if the snake changes direction.\n> \n> Specifically, the segment at (2,4) is part of the body, and when the snake moves, that position will be vacated only if the snake moves in a way that the segment moves away.\n> \n> For example, if the snake continues current path, positions shift, so (2,4) might be occupied for a while.\n> \n> Current snake path: let's see the positions. Head at (5,4) down, then body (5,5) which is up, but head moving down, so it's turning? Positions: (5,4) head down, next (5,5) which is north, so the snake must have turned somewhere.\n> \n> Perhaps the snake was moving up before, but now direction is down, so it changed.\n> \n> From positions: (5,4) to (5,5) is up, but head direction is down, so at previous turn, head was at (5,5) moving down to (5,4)? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2)]\n> \n> Head at (5,4), and it was at (5,5) before, since (5,5) is first body segment. So from (5,5) to (5,4) is down, so previous direction was down or what? Head direction is given as D, down, so current movement is down.\n> \n> The positions show that from (5,5) to (5,4) is down, so yes.\n> \n> Then from (5,4) to where? If it moves down, to (5,3), etc.\n> \n> The body at (2,4) is fixed for now, but as the snake moves, if it doesn't grow, the tail moves, so the position (2,4) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at index 5 or 6 is at (2,4), but as the snake moves forward, that segment will move to the next position.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves down to (5,3), then the body segment at (2,4) might move to (2,3) or something, but let's see the sequence.\n> \n> After move down to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2) tail. So (2,4) is still occupied, now by the segment that was there, but it didn't move yet.\n> \n> The body segments don't move individually; when the head moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to (5,3), the first body segment moves to old head (5,4), second to old first body (5,5), and so on, up to the tail segment moving to the position of the second last, which was (5,2), and the old tail (4,2) is removed.\n> \n> So for the cell (2,4), it was occupied by a body segment; after the move, that body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, which is (3,4) or what?\n> \n> Previous positions: let's list indices:\n> \n> Before move: 0: (5,4) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (2,3), 7: (2,2), 8: (2,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (4,1), 11: (5,1), 12: (5,2), 13: (4,2) tail.\n> \n> After head moves to (5,3): new head at (5,3), then new body 1: old head (5,4), new body 2: old body 1 (5,5), new body 3: old body 2 (4,5), new body 4: old body 3 (3,5), new body 5: old body 4 (3,4), new body 6: old body 5 (2,4), new body 7: old body 6 (2,3), new body 8: old body 7 (2,2), new body 9: old body 8 (2,1), new body 10: old body 9 (3,1), new body 11: old body 10 (4,1), new body 12: old body 11 (5,1), and new body 13: old body 12 (5,2). Old tail (4,2) is removed, so no body 14.\n> \n> New positions: head (5,3), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2) tail.\n> \n> So (2,4) is still occupied, by new body 6.\n> \n> Similarly, if we keep moving straight, (2,4) will be occupied until the snake turns or the segment moves.\n> \n> To vacate (2,4), the snake needs to move in such a way that the segment currently at (2,4) moves to a different position, which happens when the head moves and the body shifts.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves and the body shifts, the segment at (2,4) will move to where the previous segment was, which is (3,4) in this case, so (2,4) is vacated only if no new segment comes, but since no growth, when the segment leaves, it's vacated.\n> \n> In the move above, when the head moves down, the segment that was at (2,4) moves to (2,4) again? No, in the new positions, the segment that was at (2,4) (old body 5) is now at new body 6 position, which is still (2,4) because the previous segment for it was (3,4) or something.\n> \n> From above, old body 5 was at (2,4), and after move, new body 6 is at old body 5 position (2,4), because new body 6 takes the position of old body 5.\n> \n> Generally, for a body segment at position P, after a move with no growth, it moves to the position of the next segment towards the head, but in the list, it's the previous index.\n> \n> In the shift, each body segment moves to the position of the segment before it in the list, which is closer to the head.\n> \n> So for the segment at index k, after move, it moves to the position of index k-1.\n> \n> In this case, for the cell (2,4), it was occupied by index 5 (old body 5).\n> \n> After move, the segment that was at index 5 moves to the position of index 4, which is (3,4).\n> \n> Then the position (2,4) is now occupied by the segment that was at index 6, which was (2,3), so new body 6 is at (2,4).\n> \n> So (2,4) is still occupied, by a different segment.\n> \n> The cell (2,4) remains occupied as long as there is a body segment assigned to it, which is until the tail moves past it or something.\n> \n> Since the body is shifting, the occupancy of (2,4) will change only if the snake turns or the path changes.\n> \n> Currently, the snake has a bend at (3,4) and (3,5), etc.\n> \n> To vacate (2,4), the snake needs to move in a way that the segment at (2,4) moves away, and no other segment moves in immediately.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves and the body shifts, the segment that was at (2,4) moves to (3,4), and the position (2,4) is taken by the segment that was at (2,3), so (2,4) is still occupied.\n> \n> If the snake moves down again, same thing.\n> \n> But if the head turns, it might change.\n> \n> For instance, if from (5,4), instead of down, I move left to (4,4), then new positions: head (4,4), body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2) tail.\n> \n> So (2,4) is still occupied, by new body 6 (old body 5).\n> \n> No change.\n> \n> Similarly, only when the snake grows or changes direction significantly, the occupancy at (2,4) might change.\n> \n> But since the snake is long, and (2,4) is in the middle, it will be occupied for many turns unless the snake shortens or turns.\n> \n> The only way to vacate (2,4) is to have the tail pass through it, but the tail is at (4,2), which is not near, so it will take many moves for the tail to reach (2,4) if the snake moves away.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves down or right, the tail is at (4,2), and as the snake moves, the tail moves towards the body.\n> \n> Current tail at (4,2), and the body goes to (5,2), (5,1), etc., so the tail will move to (5,2) if head moves, then to (5,1), etc., so it's moving away from (2,4), so (2,4) will remain occupied for a long time.\n> \n> In fact, to free (2,4), I need the snake to move in a way that the segment at (2,4) is the tail or something, but it's not; it's in the middle.\n> \n> The position (2,4) will be vacated only when the body segment there moves and no new segment comes, which happens when the snake moves and the tail is cut, but with no growth, the tail is cut each move, so eventually, after 5 moves or so, the segment at (2,4) might be closer to the tail.\n> \n> Let's calculate how many moves until the segment at (2,4) becomes the tail.\n> \n> Current positions: head at index 0, tail at index 13.\n> \n> The segment at (2,4) is at index 5 (old body 5, but in the list it's index 5 for position (2,4) in the initial list? Initial positions: index 0: (5,4), 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (2,3), etc.\n> \n> So (2,4) is index 5.\n> \n> The tail is index 13.\n> \n> After each move with no growth, the tail index decreases because the last element is removed.\n> \n> After one move, the new positions have one less segment at the tail, so the index of (2,4) becomes index 4 in the new list? After move, new head, then the body starts from old index 0, so old index 1 becomes new index 1, old index 2 becomes new index 2, ..., old index 12 becomes new index 12, old index 13 removed.\n> \n> For a segment at old index k, after move with no growth, it becomes new index k-1 for k>=1, and the position changes to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> Specifically for the cell, the segment that was at (2,4) at old index 5, after move, it moves to the position of old index 4, which is (3,4).\n> \n> Then the cell (2,4) is now occupied by the segment that was at old index 6, (2,3), which moves to old index 5 position (2,4).\n> \n> So the cell (2,4) remains occupied, but by a different segment each time, until the index that corresponds to that position is high enough that when it moves, no one replaces it, but since new segments come from the head, it's always occupied until the tail passes.\n> \n> Actually, the cell is vacated only when the segment that was there moves away and no segment moves in, but in the shift, when the segment at position P moves to another position, the position P is taken by the segment from the next position, so it's never vacated unless the tail is at that position and moves away with no new tail.\n> \n> For example, if the tail is at (2,4), and the snake moves with no growth, the tail moves to the position of the second last, and (2,4) is vacated.\n> \n> Otherwise, for a body cell not the tail, it is always occupied after each move.\n> \n> So for (2,4), since it's not the tail, it will remain occupied as long as the snake doesn't grow and the tail doesn't reach there.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,2), and the distance in the snake is 8 segments away (from index 5 to 13, 8 steps), so it will take 8 moves for the tail to reach the position where (2,4) is now, but since the positions shift, after 8 moves, the current index 5 will be at the tail position.\n> \n> Current index 5 is (2,4), index 13 is tail.\n> \n> After 8 moves with no growth, the snake length decreases by 8, but since no growth, length decreases by 1 per move, so after 8 moves, length is 14-8=6, and the current index 5 will be the new tail, but at that time, it may not be at (2,4) because the position changes as the snake moves.\n> \n> If the snake moves straight, the positions don't change much, but in this case, the snake has turns.\n> \n> To free (2,4), I need to have the tail at (2,4) and then move away.\n> \n> But currently tail is at (4,2), so I need to move the snake so that the tail approaches (2,4).\n> \n> But that might take many turns, and the food life span is 6 turns, from turn 53 to 58.\n> \n> After 8 moves, it will be turn 61, which is beyond life span 58, so the food will be gone before the tail reaches there.\n> \n> Life span: at turn 53, life span 6, so can be eaten until turn 58.\n> \n> After 5 moves from now, at turn 58, it can still be eaten, but at turn 59 it disappears.\n> \n> But to free (2,4), it might take more than 5 moves.\n> \n> For example, if I do nothing, the snake is moving, but from current position, if I move down to (5,3), then the body at (2,4) is still there, and it will take many moves to shift.\n> \n> Perhaps I can move the head in a way that the snake turns and the body at (2,4) moves sooner.\n> \n> But it's complicated, and with life span only 6 turns, it might not be feasible to eat the food at (2,4) in time.\n> \n> Moreover, it's risky because to eat it, I need to move the head to (2,4) after it's free, but it might not be free in time.\n> \n> So perhaps it's better to focus on the other food at (6,3), which is free and has longer life span.\n> \n> (6,3) has life span 9, so until turn 61.\n> \n> And it's at (6,3), head at (5,4), so I can reach it in a few moves.\n> \n> For example, from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), then right to (6,3) to eat on turn 54.\n> \n> Or go right to (6,4), then down to (6,3) to eat on turn 54.\n> \n> Both possible.\n> \n> Also, need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> First, let's plan to eat (6,3).\n> \n> Option: move down to (5,3) on turn 53.\n> \n> Then on turn 54, from (5,3), I can go right to (6,3) to eat food.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so tail does not move, new length 15.\n> \n> But need to check if (6,3) is safe.\n> \n> (6,3): is it a wall? x=6<7, y=3>0, so within bounds, not border wall.

It's turn 54. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,2). So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except for (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), and the body segments in order: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2)]. So the head is at (5,3), and the tail is at (5,2). Snake head direction is down, which is D. Since it's moving down, from (5,3) to (5,4) would be up? Let's clarify the coordinates.\n> \n> Typically, in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). And head direction is D, meaning it was moving down, so decreasing y.\n> \n> Current head is at (5,3), direction D, so it came from above? Let's list the positions:\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (5,3) head, then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2) tail.\n> \n> Since head is at (5,3) and next is (5,4), which has higher y, so if y increases upwards, (5,4) is above (5,3). But direction is D, down, which decreases y. Contradiction?\n> \n> Direction D means the snake is facing downwards, so from the previous position, it moved to (5,3) by decreasing y. But in the positions, (5,3) is head, then (5,4) is the next segment, meaning the head was at (5,4) before moving to (5,3)? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> The positions list is given as head first, so at turn 54, head is at (5,3), and the body follows. The head direction is the direction it moved to get to the current position. Head direction is D, so it moved down to (5,3), meaning it came from (5,4), which is above it (if y increases upwards).\n> \n> But in the positions, (5,4) is the second segment, so yes, before moving, head was at (5,4), it moved down to (5,3), so now head is at (5,3), and the segment that was at (5,4) is now part of the body.\n> \n> Similarly, the tail is at (5,2), which is below (5,3).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1 each.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,4), it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn, so it will be gone by turn 54 + 6 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> If life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning after turn t + N - 1? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1, I think. After N turns, including current, so from turn t, it has N turns left.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear before turn t+N.\n> \n> Similarly here, at turn 54, food at (2,4) has life span 6, so it will be present until turn 54 + 6 - 1 = 59? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 54: life span 6\n> \n> - After turn 54, countdown decreases to 5\n> \n> - After turn 55, to 4, and so on, until after turn 59, it becomes 0 and disappears? But \"disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at the start of turn t, if life span is L, after the turn, it decreases by 1. After N such decreases, it disappears.\n> \n> At turn 54, life span is 6, meaning it has 6 turns left including this one. After turn 54 is processed, life span becomes 5, and so on. So it exists as long as life span > 0.\n> \n> After turn 54, if not eaten, life span becomes 5; after turn 55, 4; ... after turn 59, it becomes 0 and disappears before turn 60.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,3), life span 8, so it will be present until after turn 54+7=61? Turn 54: L=8, after turn 54: L=7, ..., after turn 61: L=0, disappear before turn 62.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 59 or so.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose a sequence of actions for the next few turns, starting from turn 54.\n> \n> Possible moves from head position (5,3): since head direction is D (down), I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so I cannot move U because U is opposite to D. D is down, U is up, so opposite, cannot move up.\n> \n> Allowed moves: not opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so cannot move U. Can move D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, check the cells:\n> \n> - Move D: to (5,2). What is at (5,2)? Looking at snake positions, (5,2) is the tail! But tail will move when snake moves, so moving to tail position is safe if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), etc., and tail (5,2).\n> \n> If I move down to (5,2), the head moves to (5,2), which is currently occupied by the tail. But when the snake moves, the tail will also move forward, so after the move, the tail is no longer at (5,2), so it should be safe, as long as no other body part is there.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, (5,2) is the tail, so moving to (5,2) should be okay; the head moves there, and since tail moves away, no collision.\n> \n> But let's confirm the positions after move.\n> \n> Current positions: let's index them: s0 = head (5,3), s1 = (5,4), s2 = (5,5), s3 = (4,5), s4 = (3,5), s5 = (3,4), s6 = (2,4), s7 = (2,3), s8 = (2,2), s9 = (2,1), s10 = (3,1), s11 = (4,1), s12 = (5,1), s13 = tail (5,2)\n> \n> If I move down to (5,2), new head position is (5,2). Then the body: the segment that was s1 moves to s0 old position (5,3), s2 to s1 (5,4), ..., up to s13 to s12 old position? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving down to (5,2):\n> \n> - New head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Then s0 old position (5,3) becomes the new position for the first body segment, so s1 moves to (5,3)\n> \n> - s2 moves to s1 old (5,4)\n> \n> - s3 moves to s2 old (5,5)\n> \n> - s4 moves to s3 old (4,5)\n> \n> - and so on, up to s12 moves to s11 old (4,1)? s11 is (4,1), s12 is (5,1), so s12 moves to s11 old position (4,1)\n> \n> - s13 (tail) moves to s12 old position (5,1)\n> \n> The tail was at (5,2), but after move, the head is at (5,2), and the tail moves to (5,1), so no collision.\n> \n> Now, is (5,2) safe?

Walls: (4,3) is x=4,y=3, not wall, so safe.\n> \n> Move R: right to (6,3). (6,3) is a food position! But let's see if it's safe. (6,3) not in snake positions, and not wall. Walls: border x=7, so x=6 is not border, y=3, not border. Internal obstacle (3,2), not here. So (6,3) is free and has food.\n> \n> But we need to consider if eating it is safe.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible moves from (5,3) with direction D:\n> \n> - U: not allowed, opposite to D.\n> \n> - D: to (5,2) - currently tail, but safe after move.\n> \n> - L: to (4,3) - free cell.\n> \n> - R: to (6,3) - food cell.\n> \n> Now, we need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,4), which is currently occupied by a body segment?

Then snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (6,3), then the body: s0 old (5,3) becomes first body segment, so snake becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2)] so 15 segments, tail at (5,2).\n> \n> Now, head direction would be R, since I moved right.\n> \n> Then from there, I can plan next moves.\n> \n> But we need to think about the other food at (2,4).\n> \n> (2,4) is currently occupied, and to eat it, I need to vacate that cell.\n> \n> Currently, (2,4) is occupied by s6, which is part of the body.\n> \n> The snake will move, so when the snake moves, the body segments shift.\n> \n> For example, if I move in a way that the segment at (2,4) moves away, but since the snake is long, it might take time.\n> \n> Let's see the position of (2,4) in the snake.\n> \n> The snake body from head: (5,3) head, then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), then (2,4) is the 7th segment?

When snake moves, segment i moves to the old position of segment i-1 for i>=1, and head moves to new position.\n> \n> For the cell (2,4), it is currently occupied by segment 6. After one move, segment 6 moves to the old position of segment 5, which is (3,4). So (2,4) is vacated, and segment 6 is now at (3,4).\n> \n> After one move, regardless of direction, the cell (2,4) is free, because segment 6 moves to where segment 5 was.\n> \n> Similarly, after any move, the tail moves away, and cells are vacated.\n> \n> In general, when the snake moves, the tail position is vacated, and the head occupies a new cell, but other cells might be vacated if the snake turns.\n> \n> Specifically for a particular cell, if it was occupied by a body segment, after one move, that segment moves to the previous position, so the cell is vacated unless the head or something moves there, but the head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> For example, cell (2,4) is occupied by segment 6. After one move:\n> \n> - Segment 6 moves to the position that was segment 5, which is (3,4)\n> \n> - So (2,4) is no longer occupied by any segment, it is free.\n> \n> - But only if no new segment moves there, but since the head moves to a new position, and other segments shift, (2,4) is free after one move, because segment 6 leaves it.\n> \n> Similarly, for any body segment except the head and tail, when the snake moves, each body segment leaves its current cell and moves to the previous one's position, so all cells except the tail position are potentially vacated, but the tail position is vacated only if the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, (2,4) is not the tail, so after one move, it will be vacated.\n> \n> After one move from turn 54 to turn 55, the cell (2,4) will be empty, because segment 6 moves to (3,4).\n> \n> Then, if the head moves to (2,4) on a subsequent turn, it can eat the food, provided the food is still there.\n> \n> Now, at turn 54, life span of (2,4) is 6, so after turn 54, it decreases to 5, and so on.\n> \n> If I don't eat it at turn 54, at turn 55, it might still be there with life span 5, and the cell is free.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,3).\n> \n> Now, back to actions.\n> \n> At turn 54, I can choose to move D, L, or R.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,3), I eat the food there immediately.

It's turn 55. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (3,2). The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (6,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2). So the snake has 15 segments. The head direction is R, meaning right, so it was moving east.\n> \n> Now, food: there are two food items. One at (2,4) with value 1 and life span 5. Another at (3,4) with value 1 and life span 10. Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,4), life span 5, which means it disappears after 5 turns including the current one. Similarly for (3,4), life span 10.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. It's an 8x8 grid since borders are x=0 to 7 and y=0 to 7, but walls occupy x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. Also internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> So playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,2) is blocked.\n> \n> Now snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (2,4)  // this is where one food is, but it's occupied by snake body\n> \n> - Segment 8: (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 12: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 13: (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 14: (5,2)  // tail\n> \n> Tail is at (5,2).\n> \n> Food at (2,4) and (3,4). But (2,4) is segment 7, and (3,4) is segment 6 of the snake. So both food are currently under the snake's body.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But here, food is not on tail, it's on body segments.\n> \n> First, let's find possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (6,3), direction is R (right). So it just moved right to (6,3) from (5,3)? Positions: head is (6,3), previous was (5,3), so it moved from (5,3) to (6,3), so direction is right.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) next.\n> \n> So allowed moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed because it's opposite.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions.\n> \n> First, move U: to (6,4)\n> \n> Is (6,4) valid? Playable area: x=1-6, y=1-6, except walls and obstacles.\n> \n> (6,4): x=6, y=4. x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable. y=4, not wall. Obstacle at (3,2), not here. So (6,4) is empty? But is it occupied by snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> From positions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2)\n> \n> So (6,4) is not in this list, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is within bounds: x=6, y=4, min x=1, max x=6? x from 1 to 6, since x=0 and x=7 are walls.

Snake has (5,2), but (6,2) not listed, so free? (5,2) is the tail, but (6,2) is different cell. Snake positions: no (6,2), so free.\n> \n> But obstacle? (3,2) is obstacle, but (6,2) is different, so no issue.\n> \n> Move R: to (7,3)\n> \n> But x=7 is wall, since border cells x=7 is wall. So cannot move to (7,3), it's a wall collision.\n> \n> So move R is invalid.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), or L to (5,3)? L is left to (5,3).\n> \n> But L is opposite to current direction R, so cannot move L instantly. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is R, so moving L is opposite, not allowed. So only U and D are possible? U and D are perpendicular, not opposite.\n> \n> Opposite of R is L, so U and D are allowed, R is invalid due to wall, L not allowed due to reverse.\n> \n> So only U and D are possible actions for turn 55.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, food: (2,4) with life span 5, meaning it will disappear after turn 55 + 5 - 1? Let's see life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,4): life_span = 5, so it appears at some turn, and will disappear after 5 turns from now? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 55. Life span 5, so after 5 turns, it disappears. That means it will be gone after turn 59? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn 55, countdown is 5, so it has 5 turns left: turns 55,56,57,58,59. After turn 59, it disappears, so it can be eaten up to and including turn 59? But when eaten, it's during the turn.\n> \n> Typically, food is present during the turn when countdown >0, and can be eaten if head moves onto it during that turn.\n> \n> So for (2,4), life span 5 at turn 55, so it can be eaten on turns 55,56,57,58,59. Disappears after turn 59, so not available on turn 60.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) life span 10, so available from turn 55 to 64 inclusive? Countdown 10 at turn 55, so turns 55 to 64, 10 turns, disappears after turn 64.\n> \n> But both foods are currently under snake body, at (2,4) and (3,4), which are segment 7 and 6.\n> \n> To eat them, the body must move away first.\n> \n> Now, the snake is moving, so positions change each turn.\n> \n> Also, the tail will move when the snake moves, unless it eats food.\n> \n> Currently, no food eaten, so when snake moves, tail moves forward, so cells are freed.\n> \n> Let me simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> Current positions: let's list with indices:\n> \n> Index 0: head (6,3)\n> \n> 1: (5,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,4)\n> \n> 3: (5,5)\n> \n> 4: (4,5)\n> \n> 5: (3,5)\n> \n> 6: (3,4)  // food at (3,4) under this\n> \n> 7: (2,4)  // food at (2,4) under this\n> \n> 8: (2,3)\n> \n> 9: (2,2)\n> \n> 10: (2,1)\n> \n> 11: (3,1)\n> \n> 12: (4,1)\n> \n> 13: (5,1)\n> \n> 14: (5,2)  // tail\n> \n> After a move, if no food eaten, the head moves to a new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the one before, and the tail is removed.\n> \n> So if head moves to new cell, body segments shift, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food cell, new segment is added at the end, so tail doesn't move, and length increases.\n> \n> But here, foods are under body, not under head or tail directly.\n> \n> Now, for turn 55, I need to choose action: U or D.\n> \n> Let me consider both options.\n> \n> First, suppose I move U to (6,4).\n> \n> Then new head position: (6,4)\n> \n> Previous head (6,3) becomes body segment 1.\n> \n> Then segment 1 was (5,3), now becomes segment 2, and so on, down to segment 14 was (5,2), which is removed, so tail moves to (5,1)?

It's turn 56. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,2). So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (3,2) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,4), then body segments: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). That's 15 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, meaning it's moving towards increasing y, so from (6,4), moving Up would go to (6,5), but let's confirm the coordinates. Typically, in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The walls are given with y=0 and y=7 as borders, so I think y=0 is bottom or top? It says y=0 and y=7 are borders, and snake positions include (2,1), (3,1), etc., so y=1 is the lowest row, I believe, meaning y increases upwards or downwards?\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so if U increases y, and walls at y=0 and y=7, with y=0 being a border, then moving U from (6,4) would go to (6,5), which should be valid if y=5 is within bounds. Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Food: two pieces:\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span means they disappear after that many turns, including current turn. So for (2,4), life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 56 + 3 = 59? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 56, life span is 4, so it will be there for turns 56,57,58,59? After turn 59, it disappears. Similarly, (3,4) with life span 9, so it will be there until turn 56 + 8 = 64? Turn 56: life span 9, so it decreases to 8 on turn 57, to 7 on 58, ..., to 1 on turn 64, then disappears after turn 64, so last chance to eat is turn 64.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 61 or so.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,4), direction Up. But looking at the positions, the head is at (6,4), and moving Up would go to (6,5). Is (6,5) occupied? Snake positions: let's list them:\n> \n> Head: (6,4)\n> \n> Body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n> \n> So (6,5) is not in this list, so it should be free. Similarly, (5,4) is occupied, but that's the body.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,4)\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since head direction is Up, reverse is Down, so cannot move Down immediately.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions, but body collision: head cannot touch any body segment except the tail, which might move.\n> \n> Specifically, the rule: head can move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, but not to other body cells.\n> \n> In this case, for move to be safe, the cell must not be occupied by a body segment that won't move away.\n> \n> But when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off its cell, so cells occupied change.\n> \n> For the next move, I need to check if the target cell is safe.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,4) and (3,4), but (2,4) is currently occupied by the snake? Look: snake positions include (2,4), which is the 9th segment? Positions: index 0: head (6,4), 1: (6,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (3,5), 7: (3,4), 8: (2,4), 9: (2,3), etc.\n> \n> (2,4) is position index 8, which is a body segment. Similarly, (3,4) is index 7.\n> \n> Food at (2,4) and (3,4), but these cells are currently occupied by the snake's body.\n> \n> The food mechanics say that food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> So, for food at (2,4), which is under the body, to eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (2,4), and then later the head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,4).\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, what is the tail? Tail is the last segment, which is (5,1) in this case.\n> \n> Adjacent to tail: cells next to (5,1), which are (5,2), (4,1), (6,1), (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so (4,1) and (6,1) and (5,2). (4,1) is occupied by snake? Positions: (4,1) is index 13? List: 0:(6,4), 1:(6,3), 2:(5,3), 3:(5,4), 4:(5,5), 5:(4,5), 6:(3,5), 7:(3,4), 8:(2,4), 9:(2,3), 10:(2,2), 11:(2,1), 12:(3,1), 13:(4,1), 14:(5,1) tail.\n> \n> So tail at (5,1). Adjacent cells: (5,0) wall, (6,1) not occupied? x=6,y=1: is it wall? Walls: x=0 or x=7, y=0 or y=7, so (6,1) is x=6, y=1, should be playable since x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Similarly, (4,1) is occupied by snake body, (5,2) is free? (5,2) not in positions, and not wall.\n> \n> (5,2) is not occupied, and no obstacle mentioned.\n> \n> Internal obstacle only at (3,2).\n> \n> So adjacent to tail: (4,1) occupied, (6,1) free, (5,0) wall, (5,2) free.\n> \n> But for the danger, it's when head is adjacent to tail and tail has food. But tail is at (5,1), and food is at (2,4) and (3,4), not at (5,1), so no food on tail cell. So no immediate danger there.\n> \n> Now, back to planning.\n> \n> I need to choose a sequence of actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> Current head: (6,4), direction Up.\n> \n> Possible moves from here: U, L, R.

That would be collision.\n> \n> Perhaps the tail is considered to be there, but when head moves to it, for movement, it's invalid because the cell is occupied.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1.

It's turn 57, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x-coordinates from 1 to 6 are safe, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's list all the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). So the snake has 15 segments. Head is at (6,5), and direction is Up, meaning it just moved up to (6,5) from (6,4), I assume.\n> \n> Food: two pieces:\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> Both have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,4), life span 3, which means it disappears after 3 turns, including the current turn. So if not eaten by turn 59, it's gone? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 57, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 59? I need to clarify the countdown.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, and countdown decreases each turn including current, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: life span = N\n> \n> - After turn t: life span becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1: life span becomes N-2\n> \n> ...\n> \n> - When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (2,4): at turn 57, life span=3. After turn 57, it becomes 2. After turn 58, it becomes 1. After turn 59, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 57, 58, or 59, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,4): life span=8 at turn 57, so it will disappear after turn 64? Let's calculate: after 57: 7, 58:6, ..., up to after turn 64: it becomes 0 and disappears. So available until turn 64 inclusive? No.\n> \n> Start: turn 57, life=8\n> \n> After turn 57: life=7\n> \n> After turn 58: life=6\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 63: life=2? Let's find when it reaches 0.\n> \n> After turn 57: 7\n> \n> After turn 58: 6\n> \n> After turn 59: 5\n> \n> After turn 60: 4\n> \n> After turn 61: 3\n> \n> After turn 62: 2\n> \n> After turn 63: 1\n> \n> After turn 64: 0 → disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 57 to 64, but after turn 64, it's gone.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,5), direction Up. So from (6,5), possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current direction is Up, so I cannot move Down immediately, because of no instant reverse. So Down is invalid.\n> \n> Possible moves: Up, Left, Right.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid state.\n> \n> First, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake body: positions listed.

Moving Up would go to (6,6), but y=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall, so (6,6) should be safe? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are safe. y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 safe.\n> \n> So (6,6) is within bounds.\n> \n> But let's see if (6,6) is occupied. Snake positions: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), etc. No (6,6), so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, moving Left from (6,5) to (5,5). (5,5) is in snake body? Positions: (6,5) head, then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), yes (5,5) is the 6th segment? List indices: index 0: (6,5) head, 1: (6,4), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,4), 5: (5,5), 6: (4,5), etc.\n> \n> (5,5) is position index 5, which is part of body. But when the snake moves, the tail moves, so the cell that was occupied by tail might be free, but for collision, head cannot move to a cell that will be occupied by body after move.\n> \n> Collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it's okay because the tail moves away. But if it moves to a cell occupied by any other body part, it collides.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is (4,1). When the snake moves, the tail moves, so the cell (4,1) will be free after move, but head is moving to a new position.\n> \n> For the next position, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it collides. If it is the current tail, it's okay because after move, the tail is gone from there.\n> \n> Also, walls: cannot move to wall cells.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,5):\n> \n> - Up: to (6,6) - what is at (6,6)?

So invalid.\n> \n> - Left: to (5,5) - (5,5) is index 5 in positions, which is body, not tail. Tail is (4,1), so moving to (5,5) would collide with body.\n> \n> - Right: to (7,5) - but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so cannot move right.\n> \n> So from (6,5), with direction Up:\n> \n> - Down: invalid, reverse and also occupied\n> \n> - Left: to (5,5), occupied by body, not tail\n> \n> - Right: to (7,5), wall\n> \n> - Up: to (6,6), which seems empty\n> \n> Is (6,6) empty? Snake positions don't have it, walls not there, food not there. So yes.\n> \n> But let me confirm the grid.\n> \n> List all occupied cells: snake positions.\n> \n> (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)\n> \n> Food at (2,4) and (3,4), but (2,4) and (3,4) are also part of snake body? (3,4) is index 9: (3,4), and (2,4) is index 10? Positions: index 0: (6,5), 1: (6,4), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,4), 5: (5,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (3,4)?

It's turn 58. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2).

I should prioritize long-term survival and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. The grid size isn't specified, but from the walls, it seems like it's 8x8, since x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, so 8 cells each way, but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls, similarly for y. So the playable grid is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. But let's list the coordinates.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1)\n> \n> (3,1) is at y=1, which is not the wall; walls are at y=0, so y=1 is playable. Similarly, x=1 to x=6 are playable, since x=0 and x=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (2,4): life span 2, value 1\n> \n> - (3,4): life span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (5,5): life span 10, value 1\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So at turn 58, life span 2 means it will disappear after 2 more turns? Let's see the rule: \"life-span disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (2,4) with life span 2 on turn 58: it will disappear after turn 58 + 2 = turn 60? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Let N be the life span at turn t. It disappears when countdown reaches 0, which happens after N turns from now.\n> \n> If life span is L at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. After turn t + L - 1, it disappears? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t, life span is L. After turn t, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1. So it is present until turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=1 at turn t, it decreases to 0 at turn t+1? But the rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret as: the food will disappear at the start of turn t + N, meaning it's not available on turn t + N.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life span is N, then:\n> \n> - On turn t: countdown = N\n> \n> - On turn t+1: countdown = N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - On turn t + N - 1: countdown = 1\n> \n> - On turn t + N: countdown = 0, food disappears.\n> \n> So food is available from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and gone at turn t + N.\n> \n> For (2,4): life span 2 at turn 58, so available on turn 58 and 59, gone at turn 60.\n> \n> For (3,4): life span 7, available from turn 58 to 64 (58+7-1=64), gone at 65.\n> \n> For (5,5): life span 10, available from 58 to 67, gone at 68.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,6) with direction U. So moving up would be to (6,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that's invalid. Walls are y=0 and y=7, so (6,7) is out of bounds, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (6,5) but (6,5) is the snake body, second segment? Snake positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), etc. So (6,5) is the body segment right after head, so moving down to (6,5) would be collision with body.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,6):\n> \n> - Up (U): (6,7) - but y=7 is wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down (D): (6,5) - occupied by snake body, collision\n> \n> - Left (L): (5,6) - is this free? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> Current snake positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1)\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,2)\n> \n> So (5,6): not in snake positions, and not a wall. Walls are only borders and (3,2), so (5,6) should be free? y=6 is not y=7, x=5 is between 1 and 6, so yes, (5,6) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, right (R): (7,6) but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: only left to (5,6)? What about down? Down is to (6,5) which is body, invalid. Up to wall, invalid. Right to wall, invalid. So only left to (5,6) is possible? But head direction is U, but we can change direction, as long as not instant reverse.\n> \n> Instant reverse: since head direction is U, which is up, opposite is D, so we cannot move down on next turn. But down is invalid anyway.\n> \n> So only possible move is left to (5,6).\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> (5,6): not occupied by snake or wall.\n> \n> Snake has (6,6), (6,5), etc., but not (5,6).\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3,2).\n> \n> So yes, (5,6) is free.\n> \n> But is there food?

By turn 61, moving down positions the snake to eat the time-sensitive food at (3,4) on turn 63, leveraging its remaining life span while avoiding tail collision risks. Long-term, this path frees space for future food consumption and maintains maneuverability.\n",

Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,6) is within bounds, no internal wall there, and not in snake positions? Snake: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1).

Down to (5,5) is occupied, but (5,5) is a food position? Food is at (5,5), but it's also occupied by snake body? Food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> In this case, (5,5) has food with value 9, but it's currently occupied by the snake body (it's the 8th segment). So to eat it, the snake needs to move so that the body leaves (5,5), and then head moves to it later. But for now, since the body is there, moving head to (5,5) would cause collision because the body segment is still there when head moves.\n> \n> The rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1.

It's turn 60, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive, I think? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So moving to any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall collision. Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2). That's 15 segments. Head direction is left, so currently moving left.\n> \n> Food: two items.\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1 and life span 6. Life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including the current turn. So if not eaten by turn 65, it's gone? Turn 60 is current, so life span decreases each turn. After turn 60, life span becomes 5, then 4, etc., until 0, then disappears. So (3,4) will disappear after turn 65? Let's see: at turn 60, life span is 6, so it can be eaten on turns 60,61,62,63,64,65? Life span decreases every turn including current, so:\n> \n> - Turn 60: life span 6, present\n> \n> - Turn 61: life span 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 65: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 66: life span 0, disappeared? Or does it disappear when life span reaches 0?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think \"disappears after N turns\" means it exists for N turns starting from when it spawned, but here we have the current life span.\n> \n> In the state, it's given with life_span, which is the remaining turns it will be present.\n> \n> So for (3,4): life_span=6 at turn 60, so it will be present until turn 65 (since after turn 65, life_span=0, and it disappears before turn 66?).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) with value 1 and life span 8, so present until turn 67.\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1 each.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,6), moving left.

It's turn 61. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,2). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,6), and it's moving left (L). The body segments are listed: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3). That's 15 segments, so the snake is long.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 5. So it disappears after 5 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, so at turn 61, if life span is 5, it will disappear after turn 65? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, a food with life span L will be gone after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn 61, life span 5: it will be present on turns 61, 62, 63, 64, and disappear after turn 65 starts or something. Typically, it means it has L turns left, including the current turn. So if not eaten, it vanishes at the end of turn t + L - 1 or beginning of turn t + L. I think for planning, we can think it has L turns left to be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Foods:\n> \n> - (3,4): value 1, life span 5, so must be eaten by turn 65?

Snake positions include (3,4), which is the 13th segment? Let's count:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (3,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (6,6), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,4), 9: (5,5), 10: (4,5), 11: (3,5), 12: (3,4), 13: (2,4), 14: (2,3)\n> \n> So (3,4) is occupied by snake body segment at index 12.\n> \n> But food is at (3,4) with value 1 and life span 5. But it's under the snake body. According to rules, food can spawn under body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) has food, and (5,5) is also a snake segment?

If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, what is the tail? Tail is the last segment, which is (2,3).\n> \n> Head is at (3,6), which is not adjacent to (2,3). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,6) to (2,3) is not adjacent; (3,6) neighbors are (3,5), (3,7) but y=7 is wall, (2,6), (4,6). (2,6) might be empty? Let's see.\n> \n> I should map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x,y, but only the borders, I think. It says \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", so all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> So let's list all wall cells:\n> \n> - All (0,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (7,y) for y=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,0) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> - All (x,7) for x=0 to 7\n> \n> But (x,0) and (x,7) are included, and (0,y), (7,y).

Positions: head (3,6), then (4,6), so it was moving left to (3,6) from (4,6)? Snake positions: [(3,6), (4,6), ...] so head is first, so at turn 61, head is at (3,6), which it moved to from previous position.\n> \n> Since direction is L, it was moving left to reach (3,6), so previous head was at (4,6) at turn 60, I assume.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,6):\n> \n> - Up: U to (3,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: D to (3,5)\n> \n> - Left: L to (2,6)\n> \n> - Right: R to (4,6), but (4,6) is the first body segment, so moving right would collide with body. Also, reverse direction is not allowed? Reverse: current direction is L, so moving R would be reverse, which is not allowed. So R is invalid both because of body collision and no reverse.\n> \n> Cannot move reverse, so R is not possible.\n> \n> U is to (3,7), which is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves: D to (3,5) or L to (2,6)\n> \n> Now, (3,5) is a snake segment? Positions: (3,5) is index 11, yes, occupied by body.\n> \n> If I move down to (3,5), that is occupied, so collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6): is it occupied?

Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (2,6) should be free, not wall, not occupied.\n> \n> (2,6): x=2, y=6, not x=0 or7, not y=0 or7, not (3,2), so yes, empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) is occupied.\n> \n> So from (3,6), moving D to (3,5) would hit body at (3,5), death.\n> \n> Moving L to (2,6) should be safe, as it's empty.\n> \n> But let's confirm: after moving, the snake moves, so tail moves, etc.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed, unless food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, no food eaten, since moving to (2,6) which has no food, or (3,5) has no food? (3,5) is occupied, but no food there, or is there food? Food is at (3,4), not (3,5). (3,5) is snake body.\n> \n> So if move to (2,6), head to (2,6), then body: (3,6) becomes segment 1, (4,6) segment 2, ..., up to (2,3) is tail, which moves off, so (2,3) is removed.\n> \n> New positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4) — tail was (2,3), removed, so (2,4) is now tail? Original tail (2,3) removed, so positions from index 1 to 14 become new body, but index 0 is new head.\n> \n> After move without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts to previous position of the segment ahead, tail is removed.\n> \n> So from positions: head (3,6), body [ (4,6), (5,6), ..., (2,4), (2,3) ] 14 body segments.\n> \n> If move to (2,6), new head (2,6), new body: the old head (3,6) becomes first body, then (4,6), ..., up to (2,4) becomes second last, and tail (2,3) is removed.\n> \n> The segment that was at index 1, (4,6), becomes the new position for what was index 0, but it shifts.\n> \n> New snake: head at (2,6), then segment 1: old head position (3,6), segment 2: old segment 1 position (4,6), segment 3: (5,6), ..., segment 13: old segment 12 position (2,4), and segment 14: old segment 13 position?

It's turn 62. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,2). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the edges and that one obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,6), then body segments: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4). That's 15 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> 1. Head: (2,6)\n> \n> 2. (3,6)\n> \n> 3. (4,6)\n> \n> 4. (5,6)\n> \n> 5. (6,6)\n> \n> 6. (6,5)\n> \n> 7. (6,4)\n> \n> 8. (6,3)\n> \n> 9.

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it has N turns left including this one.\n> \n> For (3,4): life span 4, so it disappears after turn 62 + 4 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The state says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Moving left would go to (1,6), but x=0 is a wall, so (1,6) might be valid? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,6) is within bounds, since grid is from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, meaning we can't move there.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So for (2,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - Left: (1,6) — but x=1 is not 0 or 7, so should be ok? x=0 is wall, x=7 is wall, so x from 1 to 6 are ok?

It's turn 63, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall corner, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Playable cells are where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,5), and direction is Down, which is decreasing y? Let's confirm the coordinate system. Typically in such grids, y increases upwards, but here the movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So U increases y, D decreases y, L decreases x, R increases x. So (0,0) is bottom-left, I assume? But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? Let's see the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n> \n> Head at (2,5), direction Down. Down is (x,y-1), so decreasing y, meaning moving down if y=0 is bottom.\n> \n> But (2,6) is next, which is above (2,5) since y=6 > y=5, so if head is at (2,5) and direction is Down, but the next segment is (2,6), which has higher y, so that means the snake was moving Up to (2,6)? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Snake positions are listed head first: head is (2,5), then body segments: (2,6), (3,6), etc. But if head is at (2,5) and direction is Down, that means it just moved to (2,5) from above, so from (2,6)? But (2,6) is the second position, which is the first body segment.\n> \n> Let's think about the movement. On the previous turn, head was at some position, and it moved to current head.\n> \n> Current head is (2,5), and direction is D (Down), so it must have come from (2,6), because Down to (2,5) from (2,6) since y decreases.\n> \n> But in the positions, (2,6) is the first body segment, which matches; it's the neck. Then (3,6) is next, and so on.\n> \n> So the snake is moving down to (2,5) from (2,6).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (5,6) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All positive food, since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span means how many turns left, including current turn. So for (3,4), life span 3, so it disappears after 3 turns, meaning it will be gone after turn 65? Let's see: current turn is 63, life span 3, so it appears on turn 63? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 63, life span 3, then turn 64 life span 2, turn 65 life span 1, turn 66 gone? But since it decreases each turn including current, at turn t, if life span is N, it will last until turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if a food has life span L, it means:\n> \n> - On turn t, life span is L\n> \n> - On turn t+1, life span is L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - On turn t + L - 1, life span is 1\n> \n> - On turn t + L, it disappears.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 63:\n> \n> - Food at (3,4): life span 3, so it will be present on turns 63, 64, 65; disappears on turn 66.\n> \n> - (5,5): life span 5, present turns 63 to 67, gone turn 68.\n> \n> - (5,6): life span 8, present turns 63 to 70, gone turn 71.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since the food has limited life, I should consider that.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: list of 15 segments.\n> \n> Head: (2,5)\n> \n> Body: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> (3,4) is the tail, since it's last.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied by the snake's tail!

Snake positions: (5,5) is in the list, it's the 12th segment? Positions: index 0: (2,5) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (5,6), 5: (6,6), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3), 9: (5,3), 10: (5,4), 11: (5,5), 12: (4,5), 13: (3,5), 14: (3,4) tail.\n> \n> So (5,5) is position 11, which is a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Food is at (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,6), but (5,6) is position 4, occupied.\n> \n> And food at (3,4), which is the tail position.\n> \n> Now, the rule about food under body: it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> For (3,4), it's the tail. If the snake moves, the tail will move, so if the head moves to (3,4) after the tail has moved, it might be possible, but we have to be careful with the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's find possible moves for current turn.\n> \n> Head at (2,5), direction Down. Last move was Down to (2,5), so from (2,6).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse.

So if head moves to a cell that was tail, and tail moves away, it's ok, as long as no collision with other body.\n> \n> But if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by body but not tail, it collides.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell, if it is occupied by snake and will be occupied after move, collision.\n> \n> But tail cell: after move, tail moves, so the cell is free.\n> \n> So, for current position, possible moves:\n> \n> From (2,5):\n> \n> - U: (2,6) but (2,6) is currently occupied by body (first segment), and since the snake moves, if head moves to (2,6), but (2,6) is where the neck is, so after move, head to (2,6), but body segment 1 would move to where? Let's simulate.\n> \n> If head moves to a new cell, say new_head, then the body: segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 to old segment 1 position, and so on, tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> So if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by, say, segment K, then after move, segment K will be at its new position, but if K is not tail, the cell might be occupied by segment K-1 or something.\n> \n> Specifically, collision if the new head position is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, because the tail will move.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Current positions: head (2,5), body: (2,6), (3,6), etc., tail (3,4)\n> \n> If head moves to (2,6): (2,6) is currently occupied by body segment 1. After move, head would be at (2,6), and segment 1 moves to (2,5), which is old head, but (2,6) is now head, but before move, (2,6) had a body, so when head moves to (2,6), it would collide with the body segment there before it moves.\n> \n> Generally, the rule is: if the new head position is currently occupied by any body segment, it's a collision, except if it is the tail segment and the snake is moving such that the tail leaves.\n> \n> But in standard rules, moving to the tail position is safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> But here, it says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

Let's check if occupied.\n> \n> Current snake positions: all positions listed. (2,4) is not in the list, so not occupied by snake.\n> \n> Also, walls: (2,4) x=2, y=4, between 1-6, so not wall.

Snake has (2,5), (2,6), etc., no (1,5), so empty.\n> \n> - R: to (3,5) - (3,5) is currently segment 13, body segment, not tail. Tail is (3,4). So (3,5) is occupied, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, cannot move U because opposite direction? Current direction is D, so U is opposite, cannot move U.\n> \n> The constraint is \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is the direction the head is facing, which is the direction it just moved to get there.\n> \n> It says \"Snake Head Direction: D\" and \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> So for this turn, since direction is D, cannot move U.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - D: to (2,4) - empty\n> \n> - L: to (1,5) - empty\n> \n> - R: to (3,5) - but occupied by body, collision\n> \n> - U: not allowed, opposite direction and also occupied, but even if empty, cannot due to reverse.\n> \n> So only possible moves: L or D.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,4), which is tail, and (5,5), body, (5,6) body.\n> \n> I need to think about eating food.\n> \n> First, food at (3,4) is on tail, life span 3.\n> \n> If the snake moves such that the tail moves away and head moves to (3,4), it can eat it.\n> \n> But tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Currently, head at (2,5), tail at (3,4).

Let's see.\n> \n> Rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, when you eat the food, if the head is adjacent to the tail and the food is on the tail cell, then after eating, since length increases, the tail does not move, so the head moves to the food cell (which was tail), and the tail stays there, so now head and tail are on the same cell? Collision.\n> \n> But in this case, the food is on the tail cell, so if head moves to tail cell to eat, and if head was adjacent to tail before move, then after move, head is on that cell, and since length increases, tail doesn't move, so both on same cell, dead.\n> \n> Otherwise, if head was not adjacent, then after moving to tail cell and eating, tail doesn't move, but head is now where tail was, and tail is still there? Confusing.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> Normal move without eating: head moves to new cell, tail moves away, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> If new head cell has food, snake eats it, length increases, so tail does not move; it stays, and the new segment is added at head, but since head moved, the new position is the head with food, and tail stays, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> But if the food was on the tail cell, and head moves to it.\n> \n> Before move, tail is at position P with food.\n> \n> Head moves to P.\n> \n> Since head moves to P, and P has food, it eats it.\n> \n> After eating, length increases, so tail does not move; it stays at P.\n> \n> But head is also at P, so head and tail on same cell, collision.\n> \n> If the head was not moving to tail cell, but to another cell with food.\n> \n> But in this specific case, for tail cell with food.\n> \n> If head moves to tail cell to eat the food, and since the tail is there, but when head moves to it, it collides? No, because the tail will move only if no growth.\n> \n> But with growth, tail stays.\n> \n> The rule says that moving to tail cell is allowed because tail moves, but if there is food and you eat, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So, to avoid collision, you should not eat the food on tail cell if head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> In this case, current head (2,5) and tail (3,4) are not adjacent, as they are diagonal.\n> \n> After a move, it might be.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to (2,4), then head at (2,4), tail at (3,4), which are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Then, if at that point, the tail cell (3,4) has food, and if head moves to (3,4) next turn, it would be eating it while adjacent, causing death.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied, not possible.\n> \n> Or to (1,5), not adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Back to current turn.\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (1,5) or D to (2,4).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about eating food.\n> \n> Food at (3,4) on tail, life span 3, so we have a few turns to eat it.\n> \n> But if we eat it, we need to do it when head is not adjacent to tail, to avoid the danger.\n> \n> Also, food at (5,5) and (5,6), but they are under body, so we need to move so that those cells are vacated and head can move there.\n> \n> First, let's see the snake shape.\n> \n> Plot the grid.\n> \n> Grid 6x6, x 1-6, y 1-6?

It's turn 64, and the grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (3,2).

That's good; I don't have to worry about penalties.\n> \n> The snake head is at (2,4), moving down. From the positions, the snake is long; it has 15 segments. Let me list the positions to visualize:\n> \n> Head: (2,4)\n> \n> Then: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) – that's 14 body segments plus head, so 15 total.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from current position (2,4) with direction D (down):\n> \n> Since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse.

Therefore, valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. And internal obstacle at (3,2), which is a wall.\n> \n> So from (2,4):\n> \n> - Down: (2,3) – is this valid? y=3, x=2. (2,3) is not a wall, and it's within 1-6 in both axes? x=2, y=3, both between 1 and 6, and not (3,2), so yes.\n> \n> - Left: (1,4) – x=1, y=4, should be fine.\n> \n> - Right: (3,4) – x=3, y=4, but (3,4) has food, but that's ok, we can eat it if we move there.\n> \n> - Up: (2,5) – but (2,5) is a body segment? Snake positions: head (2,4), then (2,5) is the next segment.

Snake positions: let's list all: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5).

Life span decreases every turn, including current turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn 64, life_span is given, so for (3,4): life_span=2, so after 2 turns, it will be gone. Since countdown includes current turn, after this turn (turn 64), if not eaten, life_span becomes 1, then after turn 65, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 64 or 65.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) life_span=4, so available for 4 more turns: 64,65,66,67.\n> \n> (5,6) life_span=7, available longer.\n> \n> (2,3) life_span=10, long time.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,4), direction D.\n> \n> If I move down to (2,3), I eat the food at (2,3), which is positive, so score +1, length increases by 1.\n> \n> But after eating, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move for that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so the new segment is added, tail stays.\n> \n> But in movement, when you eat, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so the tail remains where it was.\n> \n> Then next turn, when not eating, tail moves.\n> \n> Now, potential danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, where is the tail? Tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Head at (2,4), tail at (3,5). Are they adjacent?\n> \n> (2,4) and (3,5): difference in x is 1, y is 1, so not adjacent horizontally or vertically; it's diagonal.

It's turn 65, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), with an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (3,4), and the body segments follow. The snake has 16 segments: [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]. The head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to get to (3,4) from the previous position. Since the head is at (3,4) and the next segment is (2,4), that means the snake was moving left to right? Let's see the sequence: positions are listed head first, so from head to tail. Head at (3,4), then (2,4), which is left, then (2,5) up, (2,6) up, (3,6) right, and so on. But the head direction is given as R, which means on the previous move, it moved right to reach (3,4). Since the head is at (3,4) and direction is R, that implies it came from (2,4)? No, let's think carefully.\n> \n> The positions are: index 0: (3,4) head, index 1: (2,4), index 2: (2,5), etc. So the head is at (3,4), and the first body segment is at (2,4), which is to the left. Since the head moved to (3,4) from the previous position, and direction is R, that means before moving to (3,4), the head was at (2,4), and it moved right to (3,4). But in the positions list, (2,4) is the first body segment, which is correct because after head moves to (3,4), the body follows. Let's confirm the movement.\n> \n> Previous head position: since head moved right to (3,4), it must have come from (2,4). But (2,4) is now the first body segment. Yes, that makes sense. Similarly, the tail is at (3,5), which is the last position.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,6) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,5) it's 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current, so on turn 68 it will be gone if not eaten. Similarly, (5,6) life span 6, gone on turn 71, and (2,3) life span 9, gone on turn 74.\n> \n> Current turn is 65, so:\n> \n> - (5,5) must be eaten by turn 67 (since life span decreases each turn, including current; so after turn 65, life span becomes 2, then 1 on turn 66, 0 on turn 67 and disappears before turn 68? Let's clarify the life span decrease.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 65, life span is given as 3 for (5,5), meaning it has 3 turns left including this one. After turn 65, it will have 2 turns left, and so on. So it can be eaten on turn 65, 66, or 67. On turn 68, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) life span 6: can be eaten until turn 70 (since 65:6, 66:5, 67:4, 68:3, 69:2, 70:1, 71:0 gone).\n> \n> (2,3) life span 9: can be eaten until turn 73.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid.

Similarly, (5,6) is also occupied; position index 6 is (5,6).\n> \n> Food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> So (5,5) has food, but it's currently under the snake's body segment at (5,5). To eat it, that body segment must move away, and then head must move to (5,5).\n> \n> Similarly for (5,6).\n> \n> (2,3) is not occupied, I think.

No, let's see collision rules.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail moves. Specifically, you can move into the tail cell since the tail will move, but not into other body cells.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

So head moves to (3,5), and since it's the tail, no collision, and tail moves away? But if we move to tail, and it's not eating food (no food at (3,5)), so tail moves to the previous position, which is the second last segment.\n> \n> Current tail is (3,5), which is position 15.

So (4,3) is not there, so it should be free.\n> \n> (4,3) might be a valid cell.\n> \n> Also, (2,3) has food.\n> \n> Now, moving to (2,3) or (4,3).\n> \n> But (2,3) is left from (3,3), so L.\n> \n> (4,3) is right, R.\n> \n> Down is invalid.\n> \n> Up is invalid.\n> \n> So only L or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: (5,5) life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 66, life span 2, so after this turn, it becomes 1, then after turn 67, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it will disappear after turn 67.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 70 (since 66,67,68,69,70 - 5 turns including current? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, meaning it exists for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> At turn t, life span N: after N turns, it disappears, so it is present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> For example, (5,5) life span 2 at turn 66: present on turn 66 and 67, disappears at turn 68.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) life span 5: present on turns 66,67,68,69,70, disappears at turn 71.\n> \n> (2,3) life span 8: present on turns 66 to 73, disappears at turn 74.\n> \n> Now, (5,5) is currently occupied by a body segment. Specifically, in snake positions, (5,5) is the 15th segment? List: index 0: head (3,3), 1: (3,4), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (5,6), 8: (6,6), 9: (6,5), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,3), 12: (5,3), 13: (5,4), 14: (5,5), 15: (4,5). So (5,5) is position 14, which is not the tail; tail is (4,5).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves, so depending on movement, the cell (5,5) might be vacated.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,6).\n> \n> But for eating, the head needs to move onto the food after it's vacated.\n> \n> Now, back to current move: from (3,3), I can go left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n> \n> If I go left to (2,3), I eat the food immediately, since (2,3) has food and is free. Then snake grows, so new head at (2,3), and tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> But I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> If I go right to (4,3), then no food eaten, head moves to (4,3), and tail moves from (4,5) to? When snake moves without eating, tail moves forward.\n> \n> Let me simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> First, current snake positions: list of 16 cells.\n> \n> After move, if no eat, head moves to new position, tail is removed, so snake shortens? No, when no food eaten, snake moves, head to new cell, tail cell is vacated, so length same.\n> \n> If eat food, head to new cell, tail not removed, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if move to (2,3), which has food, so eat, grow.\n> \n> If move to (4,3), no food, so no grow.\n> \n> Now, (4,3) is empty, I think.\n> \n> What about the tail? Tail is at (4,5), but when we move, if no eat, the tail moves.\n> \n> But for now, let's consider options.\n> \n> Option 1: Move Left to (2,3) at turn 66.\n> \n> - Head moves to (2,3), eats food, so snake grows: new head at (2,3), body: previous head (3,3) becomes first body segment, then the rest. So new positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). And since ate, tail stays, so the last segment (4,5) is still there, and we add a new segment? No.\n> \n> When snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the body is extended. So the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> Current length 16, after eat, length 17.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (2,3), then the previous head (3,3) is now part of body, and all previous body segments remain, so the list becomes: [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] — 17 positions.\n> \n> Tail is still (4,5).\n> \n> Now, after moving to (2,3), head is at (2,3), and direction was D, but now moving left, so new head direction is L (left).\n> \n> From there, possible moves: since moved left, cannot move right (instant reverse).\n> \n> Adjacent cells: from (2,3)\n> \n> - Left: (1,3) but x=0 is wall, so (1,3) might be valid? Borders are x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=0 is wall, so (1,3) is within bounds? Grid: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so not accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> So from (2,3):\n> \n> - Up: (2,4) - but (2,4) is a body segment, occupied.\n> \n> - Down: (2,2) - y=2, x=2, is it wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=2 is not wall. But is it free? Currently, snake positions don't have (2,2), so probably free.\n> \n> - Left: (1,3) - x=1, y=3, but x=0 is wall, so (1,3) should be accessible, since x=1>0.\n> \n> x=0 is wall, so cells with x=0 cannot be entered, but x=1 to x=6 are ok, similarly y=1 to y=6? Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so min x=1, max x=6? No.\n> \n> \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7) are all walls. Similarly, (0,1) to (0,6) etc.\n> \n> So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> In coordinates, (1,1) to (6,6) are the inner cells.\n> \n> For example, (2,3): x=2, y=3, which is between 1 and 6, so ok.\n> \n> (1,3): x=1, y=3, which is min x, but x=1 is not wall, x=0 is wall, so (1,3) is playable.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is playable.\n> \n> y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> So from (2,3):\n> \n> - Left: (1,3) - should be free, I think. Snake positions: no (1,3), so free.\n> \n> - Right: (3,3) - but (3,3) is now a body segment (after move), occupied.\n> \n> - Up: (2,4) - body segment, occupied.\n> \n> - Down: (2,2) - should be free, no snake or wall.\n> \n> Also, since head direction is now L, cannot move R (right) next turn.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,3): down to (2,2) or left to (1,3).\n> \n> Both seem possible.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; first decide turn 66 move.\n> \n> Option 2: Move Right to (4,3) at turn 66.\n> \n> From (3,3) move right to (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) is empty, no food, so no eat.\n> \n> Snake moves: head to (4,3), tail from (4,5) is removed? When no eat, head moves to new cell, the tail cell is vacated, so snake positions: new head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Length 15 now, since no grow.\n> \n> Previous positions had 16 segments, after move, head to (4,3), so the list: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). And (4,5) was tail, removed, so (5,5) is now the tail? Positions: index 0: new head (4,3), 1: (3,3), 2: (3,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,5), 5: (2,6), 6: (3,6), 7: (4,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (6,6), 10: (6,5), 11: (6,4), 12: (6,3), 13: (5,3), 14: (5,4), 15: (5,5). So tail is (5,5).\n> \n> And head at (4,3), direction now R (right).\n> \n> From (4,3), possible moves: since direction R, cannot move L (left).\n> \n> Adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (4,4) - what is there?

It's turn 67, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,3), and the body segments follow. The snake has 17 segments: [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (2,3) from... since it came from (3,3) to (2,3), so previous direction was left.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 1 (so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 67, life span 1 means it will disappear after turn 67, so it must be eaten now or never.\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (5,5) with life span 1 on turn 67, if not eaten on turn 67, it will be gone by turn 68.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) with value 4, life span 1 – same thing, must be eaten now or never.\n> \n> (4,6) with value 10, life span 1 – also must be eaten now or never.\n> \n> All food has life span 1, so they all need to be eaten this turn or they disappear.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (2,3), moving left. Possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because that would be instant reverse? No, the rule is \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move right on this turn.\n> \n> So from (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U) to (2,4)\n> \n> - Down (D) to (2,2)\n> \n> - Left (L) to (1,3)\n> \n> - Right (R) is forbidden because it's opposite to current left direction.\n> \n> But (2,4) is occupied by the snake body? Let's see the positions: snake has segments at (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), etc. (2,4) is the fourth segment, so it's occupied. If I move up to (2,4), that's a body collision, which is deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (2,2): is that free? (2,2) – walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (2,2) is within bounds. Internal obstacle at (3,2), but (2,2) is not that. Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> So (2,2) is not in this list, so it should be free, I think. But is it a wall? Walls are only borders and (3,2), so (2,2) should be empty.\n> \n> Moving left to (1,3): (1,3) – x=1, y=3, not wall, and not in snake positions? Snake has (2,3), (3,3), etc., no (1,3), so free.\n> \n> But moving up to (2,4) is occupied by snake body at index 3: (2,4), so collision.\n> \n> Moving down to (2,2): let's confirm if it's safe. Coordinates: (2,2) – y=2, not 0 or 7, x=2 not 0 or 7, not (3,2) obstacle, and not in snake positions, so yes, free.\n> \n> Moving left to (1,3): similarly, should be free.\n> \n> Now, the food is all at (5,5), (5,6), (4,6). But snake head is at (2,3), which is far away. I can't reach them in one move. But since all food has life span 1, I need to eat them this turn or they disappear. But I can only move to adjacent cells, so from (2,3), I can't reach (5,5) etc. in one turn. So I must miss all this food; they will disappear after this turn since life span 1 and not eaten on turn 67.\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and for N=1, after this turn it disappears, meaning not available on next turn. So on turn 67, if not eaten, gone forever.\n> \n> Since head is at (2,3), and food is at (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), all multiple steps away, impossible to eat this turn. So I should ignore them and focus on survival and future food.\n> \n> But the food has values, and I might get to them, but since life span is 1, they expire now, so effectively, there is no food to eat this turn. I need to plan for future turns.\n> \n> But the state doesn't provide future food; only current food is given, and it might spawn later, but I think for now, I have to assume that food will appear, or perhaps after this, new food spawns, but the AI doesn't control that; I just need to move safely.\n> \n> In this state, all current food expires after this turn, so on turn 67, I move, and since I can't eat any food, no growth, but I need to avoid dying.\n> \n> Also, the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (4,5), I think. Snake positions: head (2,3), tail is last, (4,5). Positions: index 0: (2,3), 1: (3,3), 2: (3,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,5), 5: (2,6), 6: (3,6), 7: (4,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (6,6), 10: (6,5), 11: (6,4), 12: (6,3), 13: (5,3), 14: (5,4), 15: (5,5), 16: (4,5) – so tail is (4,5).\n> \n> Head at (2,3), tail at (4,5), not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x or y diff by 1. (2,3) and (4,5) have dx=2, dy=2, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,3) with direction L:\n> \n> - U: to (2,4) – but (2,4) is occupied by snake body (index 3), so collision, death. Not possible.\n> \n> - D: to (2,2) – seems free, as we thought.\n> \n> - L: to (1,3) – free.\n> \n> - R: to (3,3) – but (3,3) is the second segment, so occupied, and also, moving right is opposite to current left direction, so forbidden by no instant reverse rule.\n> \n> So only possible moves are Down to (2,2) or Left to (1,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to see the situation.\n> \n> Grid 8x8: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so moving to x=0 or x=7 is wall collision, similarly y=0 or y=7. Also internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The description says: \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.

For example, at turn t, life_span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Standard: if life_span is N, it appears for N turns, starting from the turn it's spawned.\n> \n> But here, at turn 68, food at (5,6) has life_span 1, so it can be eaten only on turn 68, and disappears after turn 68. Similarly for (4,6), life_span 1, can be eaten only on turn 68, disappears after.\n> \n> But turn 68 is the current turn, and I need to choose an action for turn 68.\n> \n> The action sequence starts from turn 68.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,2), direction down. So possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right? No instant reverse, so cannot move up (opposite of down).\n> \n> Current direction down, so cannot move up. Possible moves: down, left, right.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake body: positions from head (2,2) to tail (5,5).\n> \n> Head at (2,2), moving down would go to (2,1). (2,1): is it wall? y=1, not y=0, x=2 not border, and not (3,2), so (2,1) should be free. But is it occupied by snake body? Let's list all snake positions:\n> \n> Snake: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]\n> \n> (2,1) is not in this list, so it's free.\n> \n> But moving down to (2,1) might be safe? Need to check if it causes collision later.\n> \n> Similarly, left: from (2,2), left is (1,2). (1,2): x=1, not 0, y=2, not border, not (3,2), and not in snake positions? Snake has (2,2), (2,3), etc., no (1,2), so free.\n> \n> Right: (3,2), but (3,2) is the internal obstacle! Walls include (3,2), so I cannot move to (3,2).\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,2) with direction down:\n> \n> - Down to (2,1): possible, no wall, no snake body.\n> \n> - Left to (1,2): possible.\n> \n> - Right to (3,2): not possible, wall.\n> \n> - Up to (2,3): but (2,3) is the second segment, so moving up would cause immediate collision with body. Also, up is opposite of down, so not allowed due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> So only possible moves: down or left.\n> \n> Now, food: both at (5,6) and (4,6), but they have life_span 1, so must be eaten this turn or they disappear. But head is at (2,2), far from (5,6) and (4,6), which are at y=6, x=4 and 5.\n> \n> Distance: from (2,2) to (5,6) is |5-2| + |6-2| = 3+4=7 moves away, similarly to (4,6) is |4-2| + |6-2| = 2+4=6 moves away. I can't reach them in one move, so impossible to eat this turn. Therefore, both foods will disappear after this turn since life_span 1.\n> \n> Life_span 1, at turn 68, if not eaten now, they disappear. Since head can't reach them in one move, they won't be eaten, so no food to eat immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for survival and future food, but there might be no other food mentioned, only these two, but they expire now.\n> \n> The state only lists current food, so after this turn, no food? But food might spawn later, but I don't have information about that. I think for this decision, I only know the current state.\n> \n> The goal is to maximize score by eating positive food, but since no food can be eaten this turn, and no other food, I need to avoid dying and wait for new food, I suppose.\n> \n> But new food spawning isn't modeled here, I think I have to work with what's given.\n> \n> Perhaps food will appear, but in this input, only these are given, so after they disappear, no food until new one spawns, but I don't control that.\n> \n> I should focus on survival and positioning for potential future food.\n> \n> Now, back to moves: I can go down to (2,1) or left to (1,2).\n> \n> First, let's see what happens if I go down to (2,1).\n> \n> After moving down, head to (2,1), then the snake moves: new head (2,1), body: since it eats no food, length same, so tail moves away. Current tail is (5,5), which will be removed, and new positions: head (2,1), then the old head (2,2) becomes first body, then (2,3), etc., up to (5,4) or something.\n> \n> Let's list positions after moving down without eating:\n> \n> Current positions: head (2,2), then segments: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> After move down, head moves to (2,1), and since no food eaten, tail (5,5) is removed.

It's turn 69, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (2,1), and the direction is D (down). But let's list the positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]. That's 17 segments. Head at (2,1), tail at (5,4)? Let me trace it.\n> \n> From head: (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6) -> (3,6) -> (4,6) -> (5,6) -> (6,6) -> (6,5) -> (6,4) -> (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,4). So tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,6) with value 3, life span 1? It says (5,6,3,1) – I think this means position (5,6), value 3, life span 1.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6,8,1) – position (4,6), value 8, life span 1.\n> \n> Life span 1 means they disappear after this turn or next? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span L on turn t, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at the time it's spawned, life_span is N. Each turn, including the current one, the countdown decreases by one. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning of next? Typically in such games, food is available until the countdown expires.\n> \n> But for decision, since we're at turn t1=69, and life span is 1, that means after this turn (turn 69), the countdown decreases to 0, so it should disappear after turn 69? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Turn t1=69: food has life_span 1, so countdown is 1. After this turn, countdown becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 70? Or at the end of turn 69?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn t when food is present, countdown decreases at the start or during the turn? I think it's safer to assume that for food with life_span N on turn t, it will be available for N turns including turn t. So if life_span=1, it's only available on turn t, and disappears before turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, for life_span=1, if not eaten on turn t, it disappears.\n> \n> In this case, both foods have life_span 1, so they must be eaten on this turn (turn 69) or they disappear forever.\n> \n> But can I eat them on turn 69? The snake moves on turn 69, and food is eaten if head moves to the food cell.\n> \n> Snake head is at (2,1), and foods are at (5,6) and (4,6). (5,6) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (5,6) – let's see: positions are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), ... so (4,6) and (5,6) are part of the snake body.\n> \n> (4,6) is the 10th segment? Let's index: index 0: head (2,1), 1: (2,2), 2: (2,3), 3: (3,3), 4: (3,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (2,5), 7: (2,6), 8: (3,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (5,6), 11: (6,6), etc.\n> \n> So (4,6) is occupied by segment 9, and (5,6) by segment 10.\n> \n> Food is at (5,6) and (4,6), but these cells are currently occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Since the food has life_span 1, and it's turn 69, if I want to eat it, I need to move such that the body moves away from that cell and the head moves onto it on this turn or next, but life_span is 1, so only on this turn.\n> \n> For food at (5,6): it's currently occupied by the snake body (segment 10). To eat it, I need the body to move away from (5,6), but when the snake moves, the tail moves, so segments shift.\n> \n> On each turn, when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is left, and if the head moves to a food, a new segment is added.\n> \n> But for food under the body, since the body is moving, if the food is under a body segment that is not the tail, it might be covered until that segment moves away.\n> \n> Specifically for (5,6): it's occupied by segment 10. When the snake moves, segment 10 will move to where segment 11 is? No.\n> \n> After move, each segment i moves to where segment i-1 was, except head moves to new position.\n> \n> So on turn 69, before move: head at (2,1), segment 1 at (2,2), ..., segment 9 at (4,6), segment 10 at (5,6), etc.\n> \n> After move, if head moves to new position, say (x,y), then segment 1 moves to old head position (2,1), segment 2 to old segment 1 position (2,2), ..., segment 10 to old segment 9 position (4,6), segment 11 to old segment 10 position (5,6)? Let's think.\n> \n> Positions: let S_t be positions at time t.\n> \n> S_t = [H_t, B1_t, B2_t, ..., T_t]\n> \n> After move in direction D, H_{t+1} = H_t + D\n> \n> Then B1_{t+1} = H_t\n> \n> B2_{t+1} = B1_t\n> \n> ...\n> \n> T_{t+1} = second last segment\n> \n> If head eats food, a new segment is added at the tail position before move, so tail doesn't move, and new segment is added.\n> \n> But for body, when a segment moves, it leaves its current cell.\n> \n> For food under a body segment at position P, if that segment moves away on this turn, then P is free, and if head moves to P on this turn, it can eat the food.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,6), it is occupied by segment 10 at time t.\n> \n> When snake moves, segment 10 will move to where segment 9 is now, which is (4,6). So segment 10 leaves (5,6) and moves to (4,6).\n> \n> Similarly, segment 9 is at (4,6) now, and will move to where segment 8 is, which is (3,6).\n> \n> After move, (5,6) is now occupied by segment 11? Let's see the new positions.\n> \n> Suppose head moves to some new position, say new_head.\n> \n> Then:\n> \n> - New head: new_head\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head position (2,1)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 position (2,2)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old segment 2 position (2,3)\n> \n> - New segment 4: old segment 3 position (3,3)\n> \n> - New segment 5: old segment 4 position (3,4)\n> \n> - New segment 6: old segment 5 position (2,4)\n> \n> - New segment 7: old segment 6 position (2,5)\n> \n> - New segment 8: old segment 7 position (2,6)\n> \n> - New segment 9: old segment 8 position (3,6)\n> \n> - New segment 10: old segment 9 position (4,6)\n> \n> - New segment 11: old segment 10 position (5,6)\n> \n> - New segment 12: old segment 11 position (6,6)\n> \n> - and so on.\n> \n> So after move, the cell (5,6) is now occupied by the new segment 11, which is the old position of segment 10. But segment 10 has moved to (4,6), which is old segment 9 position.\n> \n> The point is, after the move, the cell (5,6) is still occupied by the snake, but by a different segment. Specifically, it's now segment 11 instead of segment 10.\n> \n> But for the food, since the segment moved away, but the cell is still occupied by another segment, so the food is not accessible.\n> \n> The rule says: \"1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> In this case, when segment 10 moves away from (5,6), but segment 11 moves to (5,6), so the cell (5,6) is not free; it's still occupied. Therefore, the body doesn't move away; it's just a different part of the body.\n> \n> So for food to be eatable, the cell must become empty after the body moves away, meaning that no segment occupies it after the move.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,6), after move, it is occupied by segment 11, so it's not empty. Similarly for (4,6), it is occupied by segment 9 now, and after move, segment 10 will be at (4,6), so still occupied.\n> \n> Therefore, since both food cells are under the snake body and will remain occupied after the move, it's impossible to eat them on this turn because the head cannot move to those cells as they are occupied.\n> \n> Moreover, life span is 1, so they disappear after this turn anyway. So I cannot eat these foods; they are not accessible.\n> \n> But let's confirm the positions.\n> \n> Food at (5,6) and (4,6) are both under body segments, and after any move, those cells will still be occupied by the snake, so head cannot move there. Therefore, I cannot eat them on turn 69, and they will disappear.\n> \n> So I should ignore these foods since they are not obtainable.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (2,1), direction is D (down). But (2,1) is at y=1, and moving down would go to (2,0), but y=0 is a wall, so I cannot move down because it would hit the wall.\n> \n> Similarly, left: x=1, but x=2-1=1, and walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is not a wall? Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? Let's see the wall description.\n> \n> \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for movement, snake cannot go to those cells.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> So head at (2,1). Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But current direction is D, so I cannot do U (up) because that's opposite? No, the rule is \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so I cannot move U (up) on this turn.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is D, I can move D, L, or R. But not U.\n> \n> Now, check each direction:\n> \n> - Move D (down): to (2,1-1) = (2,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - Move L (left): to (2-1,1) = (1,1). Is (1,1) free? Snake positions: current positions are (2,1) head, (2,2), (2,3), etc. (1,1) is not in the list, so it might be free, but need to check for walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so (1,1) is within bounds, not a wall. Internal obstacle at (3,2), not (1,1). So (1,1) should be free.\n> \n> - Move R (right): to (2+1,1) = (3,1). (3,1) is not in snake positions, and not wall, obstacle at (3,2) which is different, so (3,1) should be free.\n> \n> - Move U (up): to (2,1+1) = (2,2). But (2,2) is the second segment of the snake, so moving there would cause body collision. Also, since it's the immediate next segment, it's deadly.\n> \n> Now, current direction is D, so I cannot move U anyway because of no reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1). D is invalid.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's understand the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,1), body: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n> \n> So tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Now, the snake is quite long, 17 segments.\n> \n> Since no food is available to eat now, I need to find a safe path and look for future food, but no other food is mentioned, so probably no other food present.

It's turn 70. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,1), and the body segments follow: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n> \n> That's 17 segments, so the snake length is 17.\n> \n> Head direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,6) with value 2, life span 1\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 7, life span 1\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 10, life span 1\n> \n> Life span 1 means they disappear after this turn if not eaten, since life span decreases every turn including current. So on turn 70, if not eaten, they vanish.\n> \n> Food can only be eaten if the head moves onto the cell, and if it's under the body, the body must move away first. But in this case, let's see where the food is relative to the snake.\n> \n> First food: (5,6) with value 2, life span 1. Looking at snake positions, (5,6) is part of the snake body. Specifically, it's the 12th segment: positions are (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), etc. So (5,6) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, second food: (4,6) with value 7, life span 1. That's also part of the snake body; it's the 11th segment: (4,6).\n> \n> Third food: (6,2) with value 10, life span 1. Is this on the snake? Snake positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), etc. No (6,2), so it's not on the snake.\n> \n> (6,2) is not listed in snake positions, so it should be free, but let's confirm: snake has (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), but not (6,2). So (6,2) is empty.\n> \n> Now, food on body: (5,6) and (4,6) are under the snake body, so to eat them, the body must move away and then head move there. But since life span is 1, and it's turn 70, if not eaten now, they disappear.\n> \n> Life span 1: on turn 70, if not eaten, after turn 70, they disappear. So they can be eaten only on this turn, turn 70.\n> \n> But for food under body, it's tricky. Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Since the body is on (4,6) and (5,6), for the head to eat them, the body must move away first. But on this turn, the snake will move, so if the snake moves such that (4,6) or (5,6) is no longer occupied, then head could move there later, but since life span is 1, only this turn counts.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> On turn 70, before any move, the food is present. The snake decides to move. After the move, if the head moves to a food cell, it eats it.\n> \n> But for food under body, since the body is there, the head can't move to that cell because it's occupied by the body. Only after the body moves away can the head move there.\n> \n> But in this case, for (4,6), it's occupied by the body segment at index 10? Let's index the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list with indices:\n> \n> 0: head (3,1)\n> \n> 1: (2,1)\n> \n> 2: (2,2)\n> \n> 3: (2,3)\n> \n> 4: (3,3)\n> \n> 5: (3,4)\n> \n> 6: (2,4)\n> \n> 7: (2,5)\n> \n> 8: (2,6)\n> \n> 9: (3,6)\n> \n> 10: (4,6)  // food here with value 7\n> \n> 11: (5,6)  // food here with value 2\n> \n> 12: (6,6)\n> \n> 13: (6,5)\n> \n> 14: (6,4)\n> \n> 15: (6,3)\n> \n> 16: (5,3)  // tail\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. The tail segment is removed, but if food is eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, so length increases.\n> \n> Specifically: when head moves to a new cell, if that cell has food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move; else, tail moves forward, so the last position is freed.\n> \n> But for food under body, it's only eatable if the body moves away, meaning that the segment occupying it moves to another position, freeing the cell, and then head can move there.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,6), it's occupied by segment 10. After the snake moves, segment 10 will move to where segment 9 was, which is (3,6), and (4,6) will be freed only if no new segment is added or something. Let's think.\n> \n> After a move, the positions shift: the new head is at the new position, then segment 1 is at old head position, segment 2 at old segment 1 position, and so on, up to the tail.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail is removed, so the old tail position is freed.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail stays, so no position freed, and a new segment is added at the tail, so length increases.\n> \n> For a body cell that has food, to eat it, we need that cell to be free for the head to move into.\n> \n> That means that the segment occupying it must move away, and the cell must be empty when head moves there.\n> \n> Since the snake moves as a whole, the only way for a body cell to be freed is if it's the tail and no food eaten, or if it's not tail but the snake moves such that that segment moves.\n> \n> For example, (4,6) is segment 10. After move, segment 10 will be at the position of segment 9 before move, which is (3,6). So (4,6) is no longer occupied by segment 10; it might be occupied by another segment or free.\n> \n> After move, the cell that was occupied by segment 10 will be occupied by segment 11 if the snake doesn't grow, or if it grows, it might be different.\n> \n> I should simulate the move.\n> \n> Current positions:\n> \n> Index: position\n> \n> 0: (3,1)  head\n> \n> 1: (2,1)\n> \n> 2: (2,2)\n> \n> 3: (2,3)\n> \n> 4: (3,3)\n> \n> 5: (3,4)\n> \n> 6: (2,4)\n> \n> 7: (2,5)\n> \n> 8: (2,6)\n> \n> 9: (3,6)\n> \n> 10: (4,6)  // food here\n> \n> 11: (5,6)  // food here\n> \n> 12: (6,6)\n> \n> 13: (6,5)\n> \n> 14: (6,4)\n> \n> 15: (6,3)\n> \n> 16: (5,3)  tail\n> \n> Head direction is R, so if head moves right, to (4,1)?

Body has (2,1), (2,2), etc., no (4,1), so yes, (4,1) is free.\n> \n> Move U to (3,2): (3,2) is internal obstacle? Walls include internal obstacle at (3,2), so cannot move there. Also, is it body?

It's turn 71, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (4,1), and the body segments follow. The head direction is right (R), so it's moving to the east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> - (5,6) with value 1 and life span 1\n> - (4,6) with value 6 and life span 1\n> - (6,2) with value 9 and life span 1\n> \n> All food has life span 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, and it's turn 71, if not eaten now, they vanish.\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span 1 on turn t, it must be eaten on turn t, or it's gone. Similarly for life span 2, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, etc. Here, all foods have life span 1, so they must be eaten on this turn (turn 71) or they disappear.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,1), moving right. Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L because that would be instant reverse. No instant reverse means I can't move opposite to current direction, so from R, I can't go L; only U, D, R are allowed.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n> \n> First, let's plot the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, walls at borders and obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (4,1)\n> \n> Then: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n> \n> That's 17 segments. So snake length is 17.\n> \n> Food at:\n> - (5,6): but (5,6) is occupied by the snake! Let's see: snake positions include (5,6), which is the 13th segment? Counting from head: index 0: (4,1), 1: (3,1), 2: (2,1), 3: (2,2), 4: (2,3), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,4), 7: (2,4), 8: (2,5), 9: (2,6), 10: (3,6), 11: (4,6), 12: (5,6), 13: (6,6), 14: (6,5), 15: (6,4), 16: (6,3)\n> \n> So (5,6) is position 12, which is a body segment, not the head. Similarly, (4,6) is position 11, also a body segment.\n> \n> Food at (5,6) and (4,6) are on the snake's body. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> For (5,6): it's currently occupied by the snake body. To eat it, the snake must move so that the body is no longer there, and then the head moves to (5,6). But since life span is 1, it must be eaten this turn or gone. But this turn, the head is at (4,1), far away, so impossible to eat (5,6) or (4,6) this turn because head can't reach them in one move. Head at (4,1), to reach (5,6) would take multiple moves, min 5 moves since |dx|=1, |dy|=5, so at least 5 steps, but life span is 1, so it disappears after this turn. So both (4,6) and (5,6) food cannot be eaten; they will disappear after this turn since life span ends.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) has life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or gone.\n> \n> Head at (4,1), (6,2) is at distance |dx|=2, |dy|=1, so it's possible to reach in one or two moves, but let's see.\n> \n> From (4,1), to (6,2): one way is right to (5,1), then up-right? Moves: from (4,1), I can go R to (5,1), then from there, to (6,1) or (5,2) or (5,0), but (6,2) is at (6,2), so from (5,1), I can go U to (5,2), then R to (6,2)? (5,2) to (6,2) is R, yes.\n> \n> But (6,2) is the target.\n> \n> Can I reach it directly? From (4,1), moves: U to (4,2), but that might not help. D to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid. R to (5,1), L not allowed since current dir R.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> D to (4,0): y=0 is wall, so invalid. Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so (4,0) is out of bounds, invalid move.\n> \n> So from (4,1), valid moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,2)\n> \n> - D: to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (5,1)\n> \n> - L: not allowed, opposite to R.\n> \n> So only U or R are possible? D is invalid, L not allowed, so only U or R.\n> \n> U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, food at (6,2) must be eaten this turn to get it, but head is at (4,1), and (6,2) is two cells away: either via (5,1) and then (6,2), or via (4,2) and then (5,2) etc., but minimum two moves to reach (6,2). But since life span is 1, it must be eaten this turn, meaning head must be on (6,2) on turn 71. But head is at (4,1) on turn 71, so it can't be at (6,2) on the same turn; it takes at least one move to change position. So impossible to eat (6,2) on turn 71 because it's not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: from (4,1), adjacent are (4,2) up, (4,0) down (invalid), (5,1) right, (3,1) left (but not allowed move).\n> \n> (6,2) is not adjacent to (4,1); it's at distance 2 in x and 1 in y, so not adjacent. Therefore, cannot reach it in one move. Since life span 1, it disappears after turn 71 if not eaten on turn 71. So all three foods will disappear after this turn; none can be eaten on this turn.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 71, no food can be eaten, so the immediate decision is about moving safely to survive and set up for future.\n> \n> But I need to think about future turns.\n> \n> First, let's confirm the food: all have life span 1, so after turn 71, they are gone. So no food to eat now.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,1), dir R.\n> \n> Possible actions: U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, I need to check if these moves are safe.\n> \n> First, moving to (4,2): what is at (4,2)? Looking at snake positions: snake has segments at (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), etc., but (4,2) is not in the list. Snake positions: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). So (4,2) is not occupied by snake. Also, is it a wall? Walls are borders and (3,2), but (4,2) is not listed, so free cell.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1): not in snake positions, not wall (since borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, internal only (3,2)), so free.\n> \n> But I need to consider the move itself and future.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the snake grows only if it eats food, but no food this turn, so after move, the tail moves, so length stays 17.\n> \n> When snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail moves away from current tail position, so the cell that was tail is now free.\n> \n> Current tail is (6,3), I think. Positions: last one is (6,3), which is the tail.\n> \n> After move, if no food, tail moves, so (6,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Now, for turn 71 action.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (4,2)\n> \n> Then head at (4,2), and since no food, tail moves, so the new positions: head at (4,2), then previous head (4,1) becomes body, and so on, tail (6,3) is removed.\n> \n> But (4,2) is safe, as we saw.\n> \n> Option 2: Move R to (5,1)\n> \n> Head to (5,1), then body follows, tail removed.\n> \n> (5,1) is also safe.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead to future turns.\n> \n> But there is no food now, since all disappear, so I need to consider where the snake can go to find food later. But no food is given, so probably new food will spawn?

There's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,1), and the body segments follow: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4).

Also internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (5,1)\n> \n> Body: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> Tail is at (6,4), I think. Positions list has 17 elements, index 0 is head, index 16 is tail? Let's count: positions given: 17 positions. So head at (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). So tail is (6,4).\n> \n> Now, food at (4,6) and (6,2).\n> \n> (4,6) is occupied by the snake? Let's see: in snake positions, (4,6) is the 13th position? Index 12: positions[12] is (4,6). Yes, (4,6) is part of the body. But food can spawn under the body, and it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is not occupied by snake, I think. Snake has (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), but not (6,2). (6,2) is free, I assume, unless it's a wall or something, but walls are borders and (3,2), so (6,2) should be empty.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (3,2). So (6,2) is within bounds, not a wall, not occupied by snake, so it's accessible.\n> \n> Now, head is at (5,1) with direction R (right). So from (5,1), possible moves: U (up, to (5,2)? y+1 is up? Let's confirm coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The problem says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so assuming y increases upward, so (x,y) with y=0 bottom, y=7 top? But walls include y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So from (5,1), head at (5,1), moving right.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L, because L would be left, opposite to R, and no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current direction R, so cannot move L (left) next turn.\n> \n> Allowed moves: U (up, to (5,2)? (x,y+1) for U, so from (5,1) U to (5,2)\n> \n> D to (5,0), but y=0 is wall, so D is invalid.\n> \n> R to (6,1)\n> \n> L to (4,1), but (4,1) is occupied by the body? Positions: (4,1) is the second segment, so it's a body part.\n> \n> But in snake movement, when moving, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves, so if head moves to a cell that was tail, it might be ok, but need to check.\n> \n> General rule: head can move to a cell that is not wall, not body except the tail cell, because tail will move away.\n> \n> Specifically, collision if head touches any body segment except that in the next moment, tail moves, so if head moves to where tail is, it should be ok, as long as it's not a permanent collision.\n> \n> But in this case, (4,1) is not the tail; tail is at (6,4). (4,1) is close to head.\n> \n> Let's list possible moves from (5,1):\n> \n> - U: to (5,2). Is this safe? (5,2): not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: (5,1) head, (4,1), (3,1), etc. (5,2) not in positions, so empty? But we need to check if it's accessible.\n> \n> (5,2): x=5 between 1-6? x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=5 is fine, y=2 between 1-6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=2 ok. Not wall. Not in snake positions? Snake: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). No (5,2), so empty. So U to (5,2) possible.\n> \n> - D: to (5,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - R: to (6,1). (6,1): not wall? x=6, y=1. x=6 between 1-6? x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=6 is ok, y=1 ok. Occupied? Snake has (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), but not (6,1). (6,1) not in positions, so empty. So R possible.\n> \n> - L: to (4,1). But (4,1) is the second segment of snake, so it's a body part. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision. Tail is at (6,4), so (4,1) is body, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, L is opposite to current direction R, so even if it were empty, cannot move opposite instantly, but here it's occupied, so definitely invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: U or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for 5 turns.\n> \n> Also, food: (4,6) and (6,2).\n> \n> (4,6) is currently occupied by snake? Positions: (4,6) is in the list, it's the 13th position, index 12: (4,6). So it's under the body. To eat it, the body must move away, and then head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is free.\n> \n> Life span: (4,6) disappears in 6 turns, so by turn 78. (6,2) in 8 turns, by turn 80.\n> \n> Since we're at turn 72, we have time.\n> \n> But I need to prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate move.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (5,2)\n> \n> Then head at (5,2), direction changed to U.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but not opposite to current, which would be D? Current direction after move is U, so cannot move D next turn.\n> \n> Also, check surroundings.\n> \n> (5,2): U to (5,3), D to (5,1), but (5,1) is where the neck was? After moving, the snake body: head moves to (5,2), so new positions: head (5,2), then previous head (5,1) becomes body, then (4,1), (3,1), etc., and tail (6,4) moves? When head moves, tail moves away only if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten in this move, length unchanged, so tail moves away. So after move U, positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) and tail was (6,4), but since no growth, tail moves to next? The tail segment is removed, so positions: new head (5,2), then the old body from (5,1) to (6,5), I think.\n> \n> Old positions: 17 segments. After moving head to (5,2), the body is from (5,1) to (6,5), and (6,4) is gone? Let's index.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (5,1) head, 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (2,1), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,3), 6: (3,3), 7: (3,4), 8: (2,4), 9: (2,5), 10: (2,6), 11: (3,6), 12: (4,6), 13: (5,6), 14: (6,6), 15: (6,5), 16: (6,4) tail.\n> \n> After move U to (5,2): new head (5,2), then the body segments: the first body segment is the old head (5,1), then index 1: (4,1), up to index 15: (6,5), and the tail index 16 (6,4) is removed. So new positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). So 17 segments still, tail at (6,5).\n> \n> (4,6) is still occupied, as position 13?

When eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail, but since we add a segment, the position before tail is new tail? Let's see.\n> \n> Before move: head (6,1), body (5,1) to (6,5), tail (6,5)? In positions, after moving to (6,1), positions are: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), ..., (6,6), (6,5)?

No: the last segment was (6,5), which is now the second last, and tail is still (6,5), but we add a new head, so the tail remains the same position? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move.

So it will take 4 moves for that segment to become tail? Not exactly, because when the snake moves, indices shift.\n> \n> After each move without eating, the tail is removed, so the segment that was second last becomes new tail.\n> \n> So to make a specific segment the tail, it depends on the position in the body.\n> \n> Currently, the distance from head to the (4,6) segment: head at index 0, (4,6) at index 12, so 12 segments away, so it will take 12 moves for that segment to become the tail, at which point when the snake moves, if no growth, the tail moves away, freeing (4,6).\n> \n> But during those moves, if the snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move, and it takes longer for that segment to reach tail.\n> \n> To free (4,6), I need to not eat food for a while, so that the segment at (4,6) becomes the tail after some moves.\n> \n> Since the snake has 17 segments, and (4,6) is 12th from head, it needs 12 moves without eating to make it the tail, then on the 13th move, if no eat, it is freed.\n> \n> But if I eat food, it adds to the tail, so it takes more moves.\n> \n> For example, if I eat one food, length 18, then (4,6) is 13th from head? After growth, indices change.\n> \n> It's messy.\n> \n> Practically, to eat the food at (4,6), I need to have the head move to (4,6) when it is free and not occupied.\n> \n> Since it has life span 6, it might disappear before I can free it.\n> \n> At turn 72, life span 6, so disappears at turn 78.\n> \n> In 6 turns, if I don't eat any food, the snake can move, and the segment at (4,6) might become tail sooner or later.\n> \n> But with 17 segments, it takes many moves to cycle.\n> \n> Minimum moves to free (4,6): since it is 12 segments from head, after 12 moves without eating, it becomes tail, then on the 13th move, if I move without eating, (4,6) is freed.\n> \n> But 12 moves from now, turn 72 +12 =84, but food disappears at turn 78, which is before, so I cannot free it in time to eat before it disappears.\n> \n> Turn 72, food at (4,6) life span 6, so it exists for 6 more turns, including current? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 72, life span 6, after turn 72, it becomes 5, and so on, down to 0 at turn 78, so it disappears at the start of turn 78 or end? I think after turn 77, at turn 78 it is gone.\n> \n> Typically, life span decreases after each turn, so at turn t, life span N, after the turn, it becomes N-1, and when N=0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (4,6), at turn 72, life span 6, so after turn 72, life span 5; after turn 73, 4; ... after turn 77, life span 0, so at turn 78, it is gone.\n> \n> So it can be eaten from turn 72 to turn 77, but since it is occupied, I need to free it first.\n> \n> To free it, I need to make it the tail position and move away.\n> \n> But as above, it will take at least 12 moves without eating to make it tail, but 12 moves from turn 72 is turn 84, way after turn 78, so impossible to free it in time.\n> \n> Moreover, if I eat food, it takes even longer.\n> \n> Therefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (4,6) because it will disappear before I can free the cell. The snake is too long, and (4,6) is too far from the tail.\n> \n> So I should ignore this food; it's not accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food at (6,2) is available and can be eaten soon.\n> \n> Now, back to actions.\n> \n> I have two choices at turn 72: move U to (5,2) or move R to (6,1).\n> \n> If I move R to (6,1), then on turn 73, I must move U to (6,2) to eat the food, since only move.\n> \n> Then I grow, and head at (6,2).\n> \n> If I move U to (5,2) on turn 72, then on turn 73, I can choose to move to (6,2) to eat food, or move elsewhere.\n> \n> But moving to (6,2) from (5,2) is R, which is possible.\n> \n> So in both cases, I can eat the food at (6,2) on turn 73.\n> \n> But after eating, the state is different.\n> \n> First, suppose I move R to (6,1) on turn 72.\n> \n> Then turn 73: move U to (6,2), eat food, grow to 18 segments.\n> \n> Head at (6,2), direction U.\n> \n> Then from there, as before, can move U to (6,3) or L to (5,2).\n> \n> (6,3) is empty, (5,2) is empty now?

Let's think.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, the head moves to food, food is consumed, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move; the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So positions: the new head is at the food cell, then the previous head position becomes the first body segment, and so on, up to the previous tail, which remains, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail is now the new segment at the same place.\n> \n> For example: current positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move without eat: head to new cell, [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] where T was, but T is removed.\n> \n> With eat: head to food, [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., T], and a new segment is added at T, so the positions are [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., T, T] but T is the same position, so it becomes longer, tail is the new segment at T.\n> \n> In terms of cells, the tail cell stays occupied.\n> \n> In this case, if move to (6,2) and eat:\n> \n> New head at (6,2)\n> \n> Previous head (5,2) becomes body\n> \n> Then (5,1) becomes next, etc.\n> \n> Current segments: 0: (5,2)H, 1:(5,1), 2:(4,1), 3:(3,1), 4:(2,1), 5:(2,2), 6:(2,3), 7:(3,3), 8:(3,4), 9:(2,4), 10:(2,5), 11:(2,6), 12:(3,6), 13:(4,6), 14:(5,6), 15:(6,6), 16:(6,5)T\n> \n> After moving head to (6,2) and eating:\n> \n> New segments: head at (6,2)\n> \n> Then segment 1: (5,2)  // previous head\n> \n> Segment 2: (5,1)  // previous seg1\n> \n> Segment 3: (4,1)  // previous seg2\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to segment 17: (6,5)  // previous tail\n> \n> And since ate, a new segment is added at (6,5), so segment 18: (6,5)  // new tail position\n> \n> So the snake grows, and (6,5) is now occupied by two segments? No: the new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail was at (6,5), after growth, the new tail is at (6,5), and the previous tail position is occupied by the new segment.\n> \n> In the sequence, the positions are: new head (6,2), then previous head (5,2), then all previous body segments in order, so from index 1 to 16: (5,1), (4,1), ..., up to (6,5), and then a new segment at (6,5), so at position (6,5) there are two segments? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when the snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, but the tail does not move; it stays in place, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so the snake increases in length by one, and the new tail is the newly added segment at the previous tail position.\n> \n> For example: suppose snake is [A, B, C] with C tail. Move to food at D, eat: new head at D, then A becomes body, B body, C body, and new segment at C, so positions [D, A, B, C] with C now having two? No: after moving, the segments are: head to D, then the first body is A, second body is B, and tail is C, but since ate, a new segment is added at the previous position of tail, which was C, so now the tail is the new segment at C, and C is now a body segment, with the new tail at C.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, the cell C now has the body segment that was tail and the new tail, but that means two segments at same cell, which is messy.\n> \n> Better to think: the tail position remains occupied, and when growing, the new segment is added at that position, so the snake extends.\n> \n> In sequence: before move: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk with P0 head, Pk tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell N:\n> \n> - If no eat, new positions: N, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}  (tail was Pk, which is now empty)\n> \n> - If eat, new positions: N, P0, P1, ..., Pk  (and Pk is the new tail position, so tail is at Pk)\n> \n> In eat case, the positions include Pk twice? No: the new list is N (head), P0 (body), P1 (body), ..., Pk (body), and since it ate, Pk is now a body segment, and the new tail is at Pk, but it's the same cell.\n> \n> In terms of cells, the cell Pk is occupied by the tail, and after growth, it is still occupied, but now by a body segment, and the tail is at the same cell, but it's the same segment.\n> \n> I think I'm overcomplicating.\n> \n> Simply: when snake eats, the head moves to food, the body follows as usual, but the tail does not move; it stays, so the snake gains one segment at the tail position.\n> \n> So the new length is old length +1, with the tail position unchanged.\n> \n> In positions: new head at food cell, then the entire previous snake positions are shifted, with the last position (tail) repeated or something.\n> \n> From the previous list, all positions from index 0 to k are kept, and a new head is added, but the tail position is not removed.\n> \n> Standard: after move with eat, the head is at new position, each body segment moves to previous position, so the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1 for i>0, but position 0 is head, so for body segments, segment i moves to where segment i-1 was? Let's not.\n> \n> Easier: the new snake positions are: [new_head] + previous_positions\n> \n> For example, previous positions: [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> After moving to new cell N with eat: new positions [N, H, B1, B2, T]  because T stays, and it's now the second last, with the new tail at T.\n> \n> But T is the same position, so positions are N, H, B1, B2, T with T being tail.\n> \n> The cell T is still occupied.\n> \n> In this case, for our snake, if move to (6,2) and eat:\n> \n> New head at (6,2)\n> \n> Then previous head (5,2) becomes body\n> \n> Previous body segments: (5,1), (4,1), ..., up to (6,5) tail\n> \n> So new positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)\n> \n> And since ate, the tail is at (6,5), which was the previous tail position.\n> \n> The cell (6,5) is occupied, and it's the tail.\n> \n> Now, in this position, (4,6) is still occupied by a body segment, index 14 or something.\n> \n> But the food at (4,6) is still there, under the body.\n> \n> Now, back to actions at turn 73.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,2), I eat the food there, get +1, snake grows.\n> \n> But is it safe?

It's turn 74, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)).\n> \n> Walls:\n> - Border: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, cells outside 1-6 in x and y are walls.\n> - Internal obstacle: (3,2). So, I can't move to (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (5,3), and the body segments follow: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). That's 17 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction: Currently U (up), which means the head is moving upward. From (5,3) to (5,4) or something? But the positions show head at (5,3) and next is (5,2), which is down? That seems inconsistent.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), ...]. Head is (5,3), then (5,2) is directly below it, so if head direction is U, that might be a mistake. Head direction is given as U, but from (5,3), moving U would be to (5,4), but the next position is (5,2), which is down. Perhaps the head direction is the direction it moved to get to current position.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Snake Head Direction: U\" – I think this means the direction the head is facing or the last move direction. In Snake games, the head direction usually indicates the current movement direction.\n> \n> But in the positions, head is at (5,3), and the next segment is at (5,2), which is south, so if it moved to (5,3) from (5,2), that would be upward, so direction U makes sense. (5,2) to (5,3) is up, so current head position is (5,3), and it moved up to get there, so direction U is correct for the next move.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 4\n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 6\n> - (6,4) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,6) it's 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current, so if not eaten by turn 77, it's gone. Similarly, (6,2) disappears after turn 79, (6,4) after turn 82.\n> \n> Current turn is 74.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since food has life spans, I should consider which food to target.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: 6x6 playable cells? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders are out of bounds, and internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: list them to see where the body is.\n> \n> Head: (5,3)\n> \n> Then: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n> \n> Tail is (6,6)\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> - (4,6) – but (4,6) is occupied by the snake! It's the 14th segment?

But food is listed at (4,6), which is occupied by the snake.\n> \n> According to rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\"\n> \n> So here, food at (4,6) is under the body, so it can be eaten only if the snake moves such that (4,6) is vacated and then head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (6,2) and (6,4).\n> \n> (6,2) is not occupied? Let's see snake positions: (5,1), (4,1), etc., no (6,2). (6,2) should be free, I think. Snake has (5,1), (4,1), but not (6,1) or (6,2). (6,6) is tail, but (6,2) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) should be free? Snake has (5,6), (6,6), but (6,4) is not listed, so probably free.\n> \n> Grid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Cells:\n> \n> List all snake positions:\n> (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n> \n> So occupied: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,1), (3,3), (3,4), (3,6), (4,1), (4,6), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,6), (6,6)\n> \n> Free cells: for example, (1,1) to (1,6) except walls? Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are playable, but y=1 to 6.\n> \n> x=1: possible, but snake has (2,1), (2,2), etc., but not (1,1), (1,2), etc. So (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) are free? But walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7 are walls, so (1,1) to (1,6) should be playable since x=1>0 and x=1<7, similarly y.\n> \n> Internal obstacle (3,2), so (3,2) is wall.\n> \n> So free cells: all except snake positions and (3,2).\n> \n> Food at:\n> - (4,6): occupied by snake body, so food is there but under body.\n> - (6,2): not occupied, free cell.\n> - (6,4): not occupied, free cell.\n> \n> Head at (5,3), direction U, so possible moves: since direction is U, I can move U, L, R but not D? Because no instant reverse.\n> \n> Rules: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is U (up), so opposite is D (down). So I cannot move down.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,3):\n> - U: (5,4) – is this free? (5,4) not in snake positions, and not wall. Snake positions: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), no (5,4). Walls: not border, not (3,2). So (5,4) should be free.\n> - L: (4,3) – check: not in snake positions? Snake has (4,1), (4,6), no (4,3). Not wall. So free.\n> - R: (6,3) – (6,3) not in snake positions? Snake has (6,6), but not (6,3). Not wall. So free.\n> - D: (5,2) – but (5,2) is the next segment, body. And it's occupied, so moving there would collide with body. Also, cannot move down because it's opposite direction? But even if allowed, it's occupied.\n> \n> Moving to a body segment: if I move to (5,2), which is the next segment, but in Snake, when you move, the tail moves, so if I move to a cell that was just vacated by tail, it might be ok, but generally, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by body except the tail, it collides.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, (5,2) is not the tail; tail is (6,6). (5,2) is the second segment, so if I move to (5,2), it would collide because that cell is occupied and won't be vacated immediately; only the tail moves after head moves.\n> \n> Sequence: on turn, head moves first to a new cell, then if no food eaten, tail moves, so the cell where tail was becomes free.\n> \n> But when head moves, if it moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides because that segment is still there.\n> \n> Only if it moves to the tail cell, and tail is about to move, it might be ok, but let's see.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,3), moving to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied by the first body segment, which is not the tail. So if head moves there, it would be on the same cell as body before tail moves, so collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any body cell except the tail is collision.\n> \n> Here, tail is (6,6), so (5,2) is not tail.\n> \n> Thus, possible moves from (5,3):\n> - U to (5,4): free\n> - L to (4,3): free\n> - R to (6,3): free\n> - D to (5,2): occupied by body, collision, not possible.\n> \n> Also, cannot move D because opposite direction? But since it's occupied anyway, irrelevant.\n> \n> So choices: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> - (4,6): value 1, life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 77 (since turn 74 current, life span 4 means disappears after 4 turns, so if not eaten on turn 74, 75, 76, or 77, it's gone. After turn 77, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 77.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 74, life span 4, so it will be there for 4 more turns: turns 74,75,76,77. On turn 78, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): life span 6, so until turn 79 (74+5=79? Turn 74: span 6, so present on 74,75,76,77,78,79. Disappears on turn 80.\n> \n> Turn t, life span N: present from t to t + N - 1, inclusive?

When food eaten, snake grows, so after head moves to food, a new segment is added at the tail or something.\n> \n> Rules: when eating positive food, length increases by 1, so a new segment is added at the position where the tail was or something? Typically, when head eats food, the tail does not move that turn, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> In terms of positions: head moves to food cell, consumes food, and the tail remains in place, so the new segment is effectively added at the tail position, but tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Then next turn, the tail moves as usual.\n> \n> For vacating a body cell: to make (4,6) free, we need the segment that is currently at (4,6) to move away, and no other segment to move there immediately.\n> \n> Currently seg14 is at (4,6).\n> \n> After one move, if no food eaten, seg14 moves to old seg13 position, which is (3,6), and seg15 moves to (4,6), so (4,6) is now occupied by seg15.\n> \n> Similarly, after another move, seg15 might move away, but it depends on the path.\n> \n> The cell (4,6) will be occupied by different segments until the tail moves past it.\n> \n> Since (4,6) is not the tail, it will take multiple moves to vacate it, and when it is vacated, it might be by the tail moving away.\n> \n> But the tail is at (6,6), which is far.\n> \n> The shortest way to vacate (4,6) is to have the snake move in a way that the segment at (4,6) is no longer there, but since segments shift, (4,6) will be occupied until the tail passes that point.\n> \n> Let's see the path.

It's turn 75, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: walls at x=0 and x=7 mean that x coordinates from 1 to 6 are valid, similarly for y from 1 to 6. But there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), and direction is Up. So current head is (5,4), moving Up, which decreases y-coordinate? No, in grid coordinates, Up usually means decreasing y, but let's see the movement constraints: U is (x,y+1)? That can't be right. Let me check the core rules.\n> \n> In the movement constraints: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). That seems inconsistent with typical coordinate systems. In many games, (0,0) is top-left, so U would decrease y, but here it says U (x,y+1), which might mean increasing y is up? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The state says: Snake Head Direction: U, and positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), ...] so from (5,4) to (5,3) is down? (5,4) to (5,3) is decreasing y, so if y increases upwards, that would be down. But the direction is U, which is supposed to be (x,y+1), but y+1 from (5,4) would be (5,5), not (5,3). There's confusion.\n> \n> Let's read carefully. Movement: U (x,y+1) means moving up increases y? But in the positions, head is at (5,4), and previous position must be where it came from. The positions are listed head first, so (5,4) is head, then (5,3) is the next segment, so the head moved from (5,5) to (5,4)? But the positions don't show that; the list is current positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), ...] so at this turn, head is at (5,4), and it was at (5,5) last turn? But positions are only current. Direction is given as U, meaning it is moving Up, which is (x,y+1)? But from where?\n> \n> Perhaps I should assume the coordinate system: since U is defined as (x,y+1), and D as (x,y-1), so increasing y is up, decreasing y is down. But in the positions, head at (5,4), direction U, so last turn it must have been at (5,3) or something? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), etc. So the snake is moving down, since from (5,4) to (5,3) is decreasing y, which should be Down. But direction is given as U, which is (x,y+1), increasing y.\n> \n> Inconsistency. Direction U means it is facing upwards, so moving U would go to (x,y+1). But in positions, (5,4) to (5,3) suggests it moved down to (5,4). I think I have a misunderstanding.\n> \n> The direction is the current facing direction, not the movement that just happened. The state says \"Snake Head Direction: U\" meaning the head is currently facing Up, so it can move U, D, L, R, but not opposite immediately.\n> \n> Last movement: since positions are head first, and direction is U, it means the head moved to (5,4) from a position above, but (5,4) to (5,3) is below, so let's list all positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]\n> \n> From head at (5,4), to (5,3), which is down, so the snake is moving downwards. But direction is U? That doesn't make sense. Perhaps the direction is the direction it is facing, so if it's facing U, but moving down, that can't be because it would have to turn.\n> \n> I think there's a mistake. The direction should indicate the last move direction. Let me read the state input: \"Snake Head Direction: U/D/L/R\" and it's given as U.\n> \n> Perhaps from the positions, the head is at (5,4), and the second segment is at (5,3), so the head moved from (5,5) to (5,4) last turn? But (5,5) is not in the positions, so it must have been there. The positions list only current cells occupied.\n> \n> At turn 75, head at (5,4), and it moved there from, say, (5,5) in turn 74, so direction is D (down), but it's given as U. Contradiction.\n> \n> Unless the coordinate system is different. Let's assume that U (x,y+1) means y+1 is north, so increasing y is up.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), direction U, so it is facing up, meaning last move was to (5,4) from (5,3)? But (5,3) is the second segment, so if it moved from (5,3) to (5,4), that would be up, so direction U. But in the positions, (5,4) is head, (5,3) is neck, so yes, it moved from (5,3) to (5,4), so from lower y to higher y, so up, direction U. That makes sense.\n> \n> So coordinate system: U (x,y+1) : increasing y is up.\n> \n> D (x,y-1) : decreasing y is down.\n> \n> L (x-1,y) : decreasing x is left.\n> \n> R (x+1,y) : increasing x is right.\n> \n> In positions: head at (5,4), which was previously at (5,3) before moving up to (5,4). Then the body segments follow: after head (5,4), next is (5,3), which was the previous head position, then (5,2), etc.\n> \n> So the snake is currently at (5,4) facing up, so it can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,4)\n> \n> Direction: U, so last move was up, so cannot move down immediately.\n> \n> Now, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so valid x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.

But (4,6) is interesting because it's where the tail is currently. According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Specifically, (4,6) is the tail position. So if the snake moves such that the tail moves away, then later the head can eat it, but we have to be careful about tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the tail grows and collides with the head.\n> \n> In this case, the head is at (5,5), and tail is at (4,6). Are they adjacent? (5,5) and (4,6): let's see the distance. x diff: 1, y diff: 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right; not diagonal. So (5,5) and (4,6) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, so not directly next to each other horizontally or vertically.\n> \n> Therefore, no immediate tail reward danger here.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,6) has life span 2. That means it disappears after 2 turns, including the current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 76, life span 2, so after turn 76, it will have life span 1, then after turn 77, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 76 or 77.\n> \n> But currently, it's under the tail, so the snake cannot eat it now because the tail is there.

Internal obstacle at (3,2), not relevant here.\n> \n> But (5,4) is body, so down is invalid.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction instantly.

Life span decreases each turn, so at turn 76, life span 4, meaning it has 4 turns left including this one? Or after this turn?\n> \n> The rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for (4,6), life span 2 at turn 76: it will disappear after turn 77. That is, it exists on turn 76 and 77, disappears before turn 78.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 4 at turn 76: exists on turns 76,77,78,79, disappears before turn 80.\n> \n> (6,4) life span 7: exists turns 76 to 82.\n> \n> (3,5) life span 10: exists turns 76 to 85.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (5,5).

When the snake moves, the tail will move to the next position, depending on the direction.\n> \n> Current snake positions: head (5,5), tail (4,6). When snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell (4,6) will be vacated, but only if the snake doesn't grow. If no food is eaten, the tail moves, so (4,6) becomes empty.\n> \n> But there is food at (4,6), so if the head moves to (4,6) after the tail moves away, it can eat it.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - On turn 76, snake moves. Since no food is eaten at turn 76 (head not on food), the tail will move. Tail is at (4,6), and since the snake moves, the tail segment will be removed, so (4,6) becomes empty, but with food there.\n> \n> Positions: let's denote the positions. Snake: index 0: head (5,5), 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), ..., up to 16: tail (4,6).\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, and tail is removed.

This is confusing.\n> \n> Let's read the state input carefully:\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n> - (4, 6, 1, 1)\n> - (6, 2, 3, 1)\n> - (6, 4, 6, 1)\n> - (3, 5, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> And in the core rules, it's \"Value and Life Span\", so I think for each, the third number is value, fourth is life span.\n> \n> But for (4,6,1,1): value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> (6,2,3,1): value=3, life_span=1\n> \n> (6,4,6,1): value=6, life_span=1\n> \n> (3,5,9,1): value=9, life_span=1\n> \n> All have life_span=1, which means all food will disappear after this turn? But that can't be, because for example, (6,2) has life span 3 in the description? No, the \"3\" is part of the tuple.\n> \n> Perhaps it's a typo in the input. Let's see the original message: \" - (4, 6, 1, 1)\" and \" - (6, 2, 3, 1)\" – I think I have to go with what's written. So value can be greater than 1 for some food, but the core rules say only +1 or -1. This is inconsistent.\n> \n> Another idea: perhaps the \"value\" in the input is the life span, and the \"life span\" is the value? But the text says \"Value and Life Span\", so it should be value first, then life span.\n> \n> For (4,6,1,1): value=1, life span=1\n> \n> (6,2,3,1): value=3, life span=1\n> \n> But life span=1 for all, which is odd.

Let's see if that makes sense.\n> \n> If (4,6,1,1) then life_span=1, value=1\n> \n> (6,2,3,1) life_span=3, value=1\n> \n> (6,4,6,1) life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> (3,5,9,1) life_span=9, value=1\n> \n> Ah, that makes more sense! Because in the core rules, value is +1 or -1, so here value is 1 for all, meaning all positive food, and the number before is life span.\n> \n> Yes, that must be it. Because in the input, it's \"Life Span and Value\" but listed as (x,y, a, b), and from the values, a is likely life span, b is value.\n> \n> For (4,6,1,1) : x=4,y=6, life_span=1, value=1\n> \n> (6,2,3,1): x=6,y=2, life_span=3, value=1\n> \n> (6,4,6,1): x=6,y=4, life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> (3,5,9,1): x=3,y=5, life_span=9, value=1\n> \n> And value=1 for all, so all are positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,6) it has life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn (turn 77).

It's turn 78, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head at (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). That's 17 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> The head direction is U, which is up, meaning moving towards increasing y. Since the head is at (6,6), moving up would go to (6,7), but y=7 is a wall, so moving up is impossible because it would hit the top wall. Let me confirm the coordinates. Assuming (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases upwards, x increases to the right. So (6,6) moving up to (6,7) is y=7, which is a wall border. So moving U is not possible; it would cause a wall collision.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, but since y=7 is wall, I can't move up. Also, I need to consider the no instant reverse rule. Since I'm moving up, I cannot move down immediately, because that would be reverse to U, which is up. Reverse of U is D.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But:\n> \n> - U: to (6,7) – but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (6,5) – but (6,5) is the second segment of the snake. Let's see the positions: head (6,6), then (6,5) is the next segment. If I move down to (6,5), that would be colliding with the body immediately, because (6,5) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), ...] so (6,5) is the first body segment. Moving to (6,5) would be head touching body, which is a collision. Also, after moving, the tail moves, but since the head is moving to a body cell, it's deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, L: left to (5,6) – is that occupied? Let's see the positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), etc. (5,6) is not in the list, so it might be free? Positions: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). So (5,6) is not listed, so it should be empty. But is it a wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 borders, and internal obstacle (3,2). (5,6) is within bounds, x=5,y=6, not (3,2), so should be free.\n> \n> R: right to (7,6) – x=7 is wall border, so invalid.\n> \n> D: down to (6,5) is body, collision.\n> \n> U: to (6,7) is wall.\n> \n> So only possible moves are L or R? L is left to (5,6), R is right to (7,6) which is wall, so R invalid. U invalid, D invalid, so only L to (5,6) is possible?\n> \n> But head direction is U, but since I can't move U, I have to choose another direction. The no instant reverse only prevents moving opposite to current direction, but since U is not possible, moving D might be allowed? No, the rule says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\", meaning if current direction is U, I cannot choose D for the next move. But in this case, moving D would be to (6,5), which is body, so it's invalid anyway due to collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving U is invalid due to wall.\n> \n> Moving R is invalid due to wall.\n> \n> So only L to (5,6) is possible? But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> (5,6): is it occupied? Snake positions: (5,5) is there, but (5,6) not listed, so free. Walls: no wall at (5,6), since borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, and internal (3,2). So (5,6) should be safe to move to.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the snake will have new head at (5,6), and tail moves forward, so (2,6) might be freed, but since we're moving, the body follows.\n> \n> But I need to think about food and future moves.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 3 (meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 78, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 80? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for L turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=3 at turn 78, it is there for turn 78, 79, 80, and disappears before turn 81. So can be eaten on turns 78, 79, 80.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,4) with value 1, life span 5, so present for turns 78 to 82.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) with value 1, life span 8, present for turns 78 to 85.\n> \n> All food have value +1, so positive food, eating increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, back to current move. At turn 78, head at (6,6), direction U, but I can only move L to (5,6), as other moves are invalid.\n> \n> Is there another option? What about moving down? But moving down to (6,5) is body, collision. And it's also reverse direction, which is forbidden if possible, but it's impossible anyway.\n> \n> So only possible action is L to (5,6).\n> \n> But let me confirm the snake positions. Snake: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), ...] so (6,5) is directly below head, so moving down is suicide. Up is wall. Right is wall. Left to (5,6) is free, as (5,6) not in positions.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,2), which is not relevant here.\n> \n> So for turn 78, I must move L to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, after that, the new head position is (5,6), and the body will be: head (5,6), then previous head (6,6) becomes body, then (6,5), (5,5), and so on, and tail (2,6) moves off, but since we didn't eat, length same, tail moves.\n> \n> Snake positions after move: if I move left to (5,6), new head is (5,6), then the first body segment is (6,6), which was previous head, then (6,5), (5,5), ..., up to (2,6), but (2,6) was tail, and since no food eaten, tail moves to the next segment? When snake moves without eating, the tail segment is removed, so the new tail is the second last segment.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (6,6) head, 1: (6,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,2), 6: (5,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (3,1), 9: (2,1), 10: (2,2), 11: (2,3), 12: (3,3), 13: (3,4), 14: (2,4), 15: (2,5), 16: (2,6) tail.\n> \n> After moving left to (5,6): new head is (5,6), then the body segments are: the previous head (6,6) now at position 1, then (6,5) at position 2, (5,5) at position 3, and so on, down to (2,5) at position 15? Let's see: the tail (2,6) is removed since no growth, so the new snake is: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5). (2,5) is now the tail, since (2,6) was removed.\n> \n> Positions: after move, segments: 0: (5,6) head, 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (5,4), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,2), 7: (5,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (2,1), 11: (2,2), 12: (2,3), 13: (3,3), 14: (3,4), 15: (2,4), 16: (2,5) tail. (2,5) was previously position 15, but now it's the last, and (2,6) gone.\n> \n> Now, head at (5,6), and direction was U, but now I moved L, so new direction is L (left).\n> \n> Now, for turn 79, I need to choose next action.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,6): U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: since I just moved L, I cannot move R (right) next.\n> \n> Also, check collisions.\n> \n> U: up to (5,7) – y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: down to (5,5) – (5,5) is a body segment?

Not in positions, and not wall. Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (3,2). (4,6) x=4,y=6, not wall, not snake, so free.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (4,6).\n> \n> Is that right? U: wall, D: body at (5,5), R: body at (6,6), L: (4,6) free.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So turn 79: move L to (4,6).\n> \n> New head direction L.\n> \n> Now turn 80: from (4,6), possible moves.\n> \n> Cannot reverse, so cannot move R (since last move L).\n> \n> U: to (4,7) – y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: to (4,5) – is (4,5) occupied?

Not occupied, yes.\n> \n> Moving L to (3,6): (3,6) not occupied, yes.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,5), then head at (4,5), and I can then move to food or something.\n> \n> (6,4) food is at (6,4), which is far, since snake is around (4,6) and (5,6) etc.\n> \n> (3,5) food is at (3,5), which is closer.\n> \n> From (4,6), if I move L to (3,6), then at (3,6), I can then move D to (3,5) to eat the food, since (3,5) has food.\n> \n> But is that safe? First, at (3,6), moving D to (3,5).\n> \n> Now, when I eat food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> But need to check if head is adjacent to tail or something.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,5), which is adjacent to (3,5)? (3,5) and (2,5) are adjacent, sharing x or y? (3,5) and (2,5) differ by x=1, same y, so yes, adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> If head moves to (3,5) to eat food, and tail is at (2,5), which is adjacent, then according to the rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> But in this case, the food is at (3,5), not at the tail. The tail is at (2,5), which doesn't have food.\n> \n> The rule says: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has food, but here the food is at (3,5), tail at (2,5), so tail cell has no food, so it should be safe to eat.\n> \n> The danger is only if the food is on the tail cell itself and head is adjacent.\n> \n> Let me read: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> So, it requires that the food is on the tail cell, and head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> In this case, food is at (3,5), tail is at (2,5), so tail cell has no food, so no danger.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (3,5) to eat should be fine.\n> \n> Now, at turn 80, if I am at (4,6), and I move L to (3,6), then on turn 81, I can move D to (3,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> But at turn 80, the food (6,2) is still present, but it might not be reachable.\n> \n> (6,2) is at bottom, snake is at top, so probably not reachable soon.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is also at (6,4), which might be reachable later.\n> \n> But let's plan the sequence.\n> \n> First, for turn 80: from (4,6), I can choose to move to (4,5) or (3,6).\n> \n> If I move to (4,5), then from there, I might go towards (3,5) or other food.\n> \n> But (3,5) is at (3,5), from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) directly?

Countdown: turn 79:4, 80:3, 81:2, 82:1, 83:0 gone. So can be eaten turns 79-82.\n> \n> - (3,5): value 1, life span 7. Countdown=7, disappears after turn 85.\n> \n> - (5,2): value 1, life span 10. Countdown=10, disappears after turn 88.\n> \n> All foods have value 1, positive, no negative food mentioned. The value is 1 for all, and it says \"value1\" etc., but in the input, it's written as (x,y, life_span, value), I think.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (6, 2, 2, 1) - (6, 4, 4, 1) - (3, 5, 7, 1) - (5, 2, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> So (x,y, life_span, value). Value is 1 for all, so all positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,6), direction L (left). So from (5,6), possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So cannot move right on this turn.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> First, let's find possible moves from (5,6).\n> \n> - U: (5,7) – but y=7 is wall border, so (5,7) is out of bounds, cannot move there.\n> \n> - D: (5,5) – now, is this occupied? Snake positions: (5,5) is the 4th segment? Positions: index 0: (5,6), 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (5,5), so (5,5) is occupied by body segment 3. Moving to (5,5) would collide with body, deadly.\n> \n> - L: (4,6) – is this free? Let's see: walls: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, but borders are walls, so (4,6) should be within bounds? x=4, y=6, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but borders are walls, meaning cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (4,6) has x=4, y=6, not on border, and not (3,2) obstacle, so should be free? But is it occupied by snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), etc. (4,6) is not in the list, so it should be empty.\n> \n> - R: (6,6) – but (6,6) is occupied by body segment 1. Also, cannot move right because it's opposite to current left direction? Current direction L, so R is opposite, cannot move right.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Since we're at turn t1, and choosing action for turn t1, we cannot move opposite to the current head direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so for turn t1, we cannot move R.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn t1: U, D, L.\n> \n> But U: (5,7) is y=7, border wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (5,5) is occupied by body, invalid.\n> \n> L: (4,6) – seems free and not wall.\n> \n> Is (4,6) occupied? Snake positions: let's list all: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5). No (4,6), so yes, free.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (3,2). (4,6) not wall.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (4,6). Is that right?\n> \n> U invalid, D invalid, R invalid (opposite), so only L is possible?\n> \n> But let's confirm: after moving to (4,6), the snake will have new head at (4,6), and the tail will move, so the body segment at (2,5) will be removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> But since we're moving to (4,6), which has no food, so no growth, tail moves.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, at turn t1=79, only possible move is L to (4,6), since other moves are invalid.\n> \n> Is that correct?\n> \n> U: (5,7) - y=7 is border, wall, cannot move.\n> \n> D: (5,5) - occupied by snake body, cannot move there.\n> \n> R: (6,6) - occupied, and also opposite direction, cannot move.\n> \n> L: (4,6) - free, not wall.\n> \n> Yes, so for turn 79, must move L to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, after this move, snake head at (4,6), direction was L, but after moving, direction changes to the move we made, I think? For the next turn, the head direction will be L, since we moved left.\n> \n> Now, need to plan for future turns.\n> \n> But the action sequence should start from turn 79.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (4,6), what is the new snake position?\n> \n> Head moves to (4,6), then the body: since no food eaten, tail is removed. Tail was (2,5), so removed. New positions: head (4,6), then previous head (5,6) becomes body, so segment 1: (5,6), then segment 2: (6,6)? Let's see.\n> \n> Original positions: indices 0: (5,6) head, 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (5,5), ..., up to 16: (2,5) tail.\n> \n> After move left to (4,6), new head is (4,6). Then the body: the segment that was head becomes new body segment 1: (5,6). Then segment 2: (6,6), segment 3: (6,5), and so on, up to segment 16: but tail (2,5) is removed, so the new tail is what was segment 15: (2,4)? Positions: after move, the new body is the old body minus the tail, plus the new head.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so the body shifts.\n> \n> So new positions: head (4,6), then [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) ] because tail (2,5) removed, so (2,4) is now the tail.\n> \n> Old positions: 0: (5,6), 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (5,4), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,2), 7: (5,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (2,1), 11: (2,2), 12: (2,3), 13: (3,3), 14: (3,4), 15: (2,4), 16: (2,5)\n> \n> After move: head to (4,6), so new segment 0: (4,6)\n> \n> Then new segment 1: old head (5,6)\n> \n> New segment 2: old segment 1 (6,6)\n> \n> New segment 3: old segment 2 (6,5)\n> \n> New segment 4: old segment 3 (5,5)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to new segment 16: old segment 15 (2,4)?

It's turn 81, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are given: head is at (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4). So the snake has 17 segments. Head direction is L, which means it's moving left, so from (3,6) it was going to (2,6) or something? Let me plot this.\n> \n> List of positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,6)\n> \n> - Next: (4,6) — that's to the right, but head direction is L? That doesn't make sense. Head direction is given as L, meaning it just moved left to (3,6). But the previous position should be to the right if it moved left to (3,6). Let's see the sequence: positions are head first, so at turn 81, head is at (3,6), and the body segments follow.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n> \n> Head is at (3,6), and the next segment is (4,6), which is to the east, so if head is moving left, that means it was previously at (4,6) and moved left to (3,6). But (4,6) is the second segment, so at the next turn, when the snake moves, the head moves, and the tail follows.\n> \n> Head direction is the direction it is currently facing or just moved. It says \"Snake Head Direction: L\", so at turn 81, the head is at (3,6) and it is facing left, meaning it just moved left or is about to move left? I think it's the direction for the next move.\n> \n> The action sequence is for turns starting from t1, so at turn 81, I need to choose an action: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> Since head direction is given as L, that means the previous move was left, so I cannot instantly reverse to right; I can only go U, D, or L, but not R because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Current head direction L means the snake is facing left, so for the next move, I can go U, D, or L, but not R, because no instant reverse.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1 and life_span 3? It says (6,4,3,1) — I think it's (x,y, life_span, value). Let me read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6,4,3,1)\" so that's (x,y) = (6,4), life_span=3, value=1. Similarly, (3,5,5,1) is (3,5) with life_span=5, value=1, and (5,2,8,1) is (5,2) with life_span=8, value=1.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food? But one of them is at (5,2), which is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (5,2), which is the 9th segment: positions index from 0: head (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) — yes, (5,2) is part of the snake body.\n> \n> Food at (5,2) with life_span 8, value 1. But it's under the snake body. According to rules, food can spawn under body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (6,4) and (3,5).\n> \n> Life_span: for (6,4) it's 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So at turn 81, life_span 3 means: after turn 81, it has 2 turns left; after turn 82, 1 turn left; after turn 83, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 83.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) life_span 5: disappears after turn 85 (since turn 81:5, 82:4, 83:3, 84:2, 85:1, gone after 85? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n> \n> For (6,4): life_span 3 at turn 81, so present on turns 81, 82, 83, gone at turn 84.\n> \n> For (3,5): life_span 5, present on turns 81 to 85, gone at 86.\n> \n> For (5,2): life_span 8, present on turns 81 to 88, gone at 89.\n> \n> But (5,2) is under the snake body, so to eat it, the snake must move away from that cell and later head move to it when it's empty.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,6), direction L, so possible moves: since facing left, I can go Left (L), Up (U), or Down (D), but not Right (R) because reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,6)\n> \n> Moving L would go to (2,6)\n> \n> U to (3,7) but y=7 is a wall? Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so (3,7) is y=7, which is a wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (3,5)\n> \n> L to (2,6)\n> \n> R is not allowed because opposite direction.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,2), but that's not near head.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,6):\n> \n> - L: to (2,6) — is this valid? (2,6) is not a wall, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all snake cells.\n> \n> Snake: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n> \n> (2,6) is not in this list, and x=2, y=6, between 0 and 7, not wall except borders, y=6 not border, x=2 not border, so should be free? But is it a wall? Walls only borders and (3,2), so (2,6) should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, D: to (3,5) — (3,5) is not in snake positions, and not wall, and there is food at (3,5) with value 1.\n> \n> U: to (3,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves: L to (2,6) or D to (3,5).\n> \n> Now, (3,5) has food, so if I move there, I eat it, snake grows to 18 segments.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> I should sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,6)\n> \n> Body: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) — so row y=6, x=3 to6\n> \n> Then (6,5) — down to (6,5)\n> \n> Then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) — so column x=5, y=5 to1\n> \n> Then (4,1), (3,1) — left to (4,1) and (3,1)\n> \n> Then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) — down then right? (2,1) to (2,2) to (2,3)\n> \n> Then (3,3), (3,4) — right to (3,3) then up to (3,4)\n> \n> And head at (3,6).\n> \n> Now, tail is at (3,4)? Positions: last is (3,4), but tail is the end, which moves when snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> So tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (6,4): value 1, life_span 3, so must be eaten by turn 83.\n> \n> - (3,5): value 1, life_span 5, eat by turn 85.\n> \n> - (5,2): value 1, life_span 8, eat by turn 88, but it's under snake body at (5,2), which is occupied.\n> \n> (5,2) is a body segment, not head or tail. Segment at index 8: positions[8] is (5,2).\n> \n> To eat this food, the snake must move so that the body leaves (5,2), making it empty, then later head can move to it.\n> \n> But since the snake moves, when the segment at (5,2) moves, it will leave that cell, so the food becomes accessible, but only if head can reach it later.\n> \n> Now, back to current turn, I have two choices: move L to (2,6) or D to (3,5).\n> \n> If I move D to (3,5), I eat the food there, snake grows to 18 segments, head now at (3,5), and direction becomes D (since I moved down).\n> \n> Then, from there, possible moves.\n> \n> But let's see the consequences.\n> \n> If I move to (3,5), I eat food, grow, so the new tail will be added after current tail, so positions: head moves to (3,5), body segments follow, but since I ate food, tail doesn't move, so snake becomes 18 segments: head at (3,5), then previous head (3,6) becomes body, so [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), ... up to (3,4) but tail was at (3,4), and since I ate, tail stays, so new positions: [ (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4) ] — now tail is at (3,4), but (3,4) is still there.\n> \n> Before move, tail was (3,4), after moving down to (3,5) and eating, head at (3,5), body: (3,6), (4,6), etc., and tail still (3,4), so positions: [ (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4) ] — yes, 18 positions.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,5), direction D (down).\n> \n> From (3,5), possible moves: L to (2,5), R to (4,5), D to (3,4), U to (3,6) but (3,6) is now body, occupied, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, walls: U to (3,6) is occupied, D to (3,4) is occupied by tail? (3,4) is tail, but when head moves, the tail will move if no growth, but since I ate, tail stays, so (3,4) is occupied.\n> \n> Let's clarify movement.\n> \n> When snake moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of the next, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> - If food eaten, head moves to new cell with food, segments move, but tail does not leave, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In this case, after moving to (3,5) and eating, head at (3,5), and the body includes (3,6), so (3,6) is occupied, and (3,4) is occupied.\n> \n> From (3,5), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Left: (2,5) — is it free? Not in snake positions, not wall.\n> \n> - Right: (4,5) — free? Snake has (4,6), (5,6), etc., but (4,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - Down: (3,4) — but (3,4) is the tail, occupied.\n> \n> - Up: (3,6) — occupied by body.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,5) after moving there: L to (2,5) or R to (4,5). D and U are occupied.\n> \n> If I go L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n> \n> But if I go D to (3,4), it would be collision with body, death.\n> \n> Similarly U to (3,6) collision.\n> \n> So only L or R.\n> \n> Now, if I don't eat the food now, move L to (2,6) instead.\n> \n> Then, no food eaten, so head moves to (2,6), body follows: segments shift, tail at (3,4) leaves, so new positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) — and (3,4) is gone, so tail is at (3,3).\n> \n> Snake length 16 now? Original 17, no growth, so after move, positions: [ (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) ] — 17 positions? Head to tail.\n> \n> Original: 17 segments. After move: head to new position, each body segment to previous position of the one before, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Positions before move: indices 0 to 16: 0:(3,6), 1:(4,6), 2:(5,6), 3:(6,6), 4:(6,5), 5:(5,5), 6:(5,4), 7:(5,3), 8:(5,2), 9:(5,1), 10:(4,1), 11:(3,1), 12:(2,1), 13:(2,2), 14:(2,3), 15:(3,3), 16:(3,4)\n> \n> After moving left to (2,6): new head at (2,6), then body: position 0 moves to (2,6), but body segments: segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, so to (3,6), segment 2 to where segment 1 was, (4,6), and so on, up to segment 16 moves to where segment 15 was, which is (3,3), and segment 15 was at (3,3), which is where segment 14 moved to? Let's think:\n> \n> New positions: head: (2,6)\n> \n> Then body: segment 1 goes to previous position of head, which is (3,6)\n> \n> Segment 2 goes to previous position of segment 1, which was (4,6)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Segment 15 goes to previous position of segment 14, which was (2,3)? Segment 14 was at (2,3), so segment 15 moves to (2,3)\n> \n> Segment 16 was at (3,4), and it moves to where segment 15 was? Segment 15 was at (3,3), so segment 16 moves to (3,3)\n> \n> But segment 15 is moving to (2,3), so the new body is: after head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), and then segment 16 was tail, but it moves to (3,3), which is the position where segment 15 was.\n> \n> Positions before move: seg0: (3,6), seg1: (4,6), seg2: (5,6), seg3: (6,6), seg4: (6,5), seg5: (5,5), seg6: (5,4), seg7: (5,3), seg8: (5,2), seg9: (5,1), seg10: (4,1), seg11: (3,1), seg12: (2,1), seg13: (2,2), seg14: (2,3), seg15: (3,3), seg16: (3,4)\n> \n> After moving left to (2,6): new seg0 (head) at (2,6)\n> \n> Then new seg1 at old seg0 position: (3,6)\n> \n> New seg2 at old seg1 position: (4,6)\n> \n> New seg3 at old seg2 position: (5,6)\n> \n> New seg4 at old seg3 position: (6,6)\n> \n> New seg5 at old seg4 position: (6,5)\n> \n> New seg6 at old seg5 position: (5,5)\n> \n> New seg7 at old seg6 position: (5,4)\n> \n> New seg8 at old seg7 position: (5,3)\n> \n> New seg9 at old seg8 position: (5,2)  -- but (5,2) has food, but not eaten because head not there.\n> \n> New seg10 at old seg9 position: (5,1)\n> \n> New seg11 at old seg10 position: (4,1)\n> \n> New seg12 at old seg11 position: (3,1)\n> \n> New seg13 at old seg12 position: (2,1)\n> \n> New seg14 at old seg13 position: (2,2)\n> \n> New seg15 at old seg14 position: (2,3)\n> \n> New seg16 at old seg15 position: (3,3)  -- and old seg16 at (3,4) is not part of snake anymore, so (3,4) is empty now.\n> \n> So new tail at (3,3), and (3,4) is free.\n> \n> Head at (2,6), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> From (2,6), possible moves: L to (1,6), R to (3,6) but (3,6) is now body, occupied, U to (2,7) but y=7 wall, D to (2,5).\n> \n> Also, no reverse since moved left, so R is opposite, not allowed.

is impossible given movement constraints), and the food at (5,2) cannot be eaten before it disappears due to body obstruction. Thus, I prioritize immediately eating the accessible positive food at (3,5) to grow the snake, then navigate toward open areas (left and down) to avoid dead ends and ensure long-term survival.\n",

But if it's the tail, and the tail moves away, it's okay because the tail vacates the cell.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,5): currently, (3,5) is the position of the second segment.

Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, but index 0 was head, which has moved.\n> \n> Better to think: after head moves to new position, the tail end is removed if no food eaten, or a new segment added if food eaten.\n> \n> But for collision: before moving, if the target cell is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it's a collision. Because after move, that body segment will still be there except the tail moves.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, to avoid collision, the target cell must not be occupied by any body segment except the current tail position.\n> \n> Current body segments: from index 1 to 17: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> Tail is at index 17: (3,3)\n> \n> So, for head at (2,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,6) – is this occupied? Look at positions: (3,6) is index 2, (4,6) etc, but (2,6) is not in the list. Snake positions: (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), ... no (2,6). Also, walls: y=7 is wall, so (2,6) is y=6, which is within 0 to 7? Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (2,6) is valid, no wall. Obstacle at (3,2), not (2,6). So (2,6) should be empty.\n> \n> - D: (2,4) – not in snake positions, not wall, y=4>0, so ok.\n> \n> - L: (1,5) – x=1, not 0, so not wall. Not in snake positions, so ok.\n> \n> - R: (3,5) – (3,5) is index 1, which is a body segment, not the tail. Tail is (3,3). So (3,5) is occupied by body, so moving there would cause collision, invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves: U, D, L. Cannot go R.\n> \n> Now, food: (6,4) value 1, life span 1. This will disappear after this turn, so if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> (5,2) value 1, life span 6, so it has 6 turns including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 83, life span 1 for (6,4) means it disappears after turn 83 if not eaten. Similarly, (5,2) life span 6, disappears after 6 turns, so up to turn 88? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for (6,4), life span 1, at turn 83, it will disappear after this turn, meaning if not eaten on turn 83, it's gone.\n> \n> For (5,2), life span 6, it will disappear after turn 88 (83+5? Let's calculate).\n> \n> Turn current: t=83\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, so available from turn t to t + N - 1? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, life span is L, then after this turn, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it exists for N turns starting from when it was spawned, but here we have current life span.\n> \n> Given: at turn 83, food has life span S, so it will disappear after S more turns.\n> \n> For (6,4), S=1, so after turn 83, it disappears, meaning it can only be eaten on turn 83.\n> \n> For (5,2), S=6, so it disappears after turn 88 (since 83 + 6 - 1 = 88? Let's see: after turn 83, S becomes 5; after turn 84, S=4; ... after turn 88, S=0, disappears.

When the snake moves, the body moves, so (3,6) will be vacated when the segment there moves to a new position.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves, the segment at (3,6) will move to where the previous segment was, but it depends on the movement.\n> \n> The position (3,6) will be vacated only if the segment that is there moves away and no other segment moves to it immediately, but since the snake moves as a whole, when the head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> So, for cell (3,6), it is currently occupied by the segment that was at index 2.

The tail is index 17 at (3,3).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves, but (5,2) is not the tail, so it won't be vacated.\n> \n> In fact, (5,2) will be vacated only when the segment that is there becomes the tail and the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> But that will take many moves, since it's index 10 out of 18, so it needs to become the tail, which means the snake must move 8 times without eating to make it the tail? Not exactly.\n> \n> The segment at index 10 will become the tail after 7 moves, because there are 7 segments after it (indices 11 to 17), so after 7 moves, if no growth, the segment that was at index 10 will be at index 10-7=3 or something? Let's see.\n> \n> After k moves with no food eaten, the tail is the segment that was at index k, and the head has moved k times.\n> \n> Positions: after k moves, the new tail is the segment that was at index k.\n> \n> For example, after 1 move, tail is old index 16 (since old index 17 removed).\n> \n> After 2 moves, tail is old index 15, and so on.\n> \n> So for the cell (5,2), which is occupied by old index 10, it will be vacated when that segment moves away and no other segment comes, which happens when that segment is the tail and it moves.\n> \n> So when will index 10 become the tail? After 8 moves with no food eaten, because there are 8 segments after it (indices 11 to 18, but index 17 is tail, so indices 11 to 17 are 7 segments, let's count.\n> \n> Indices from 0 to 17, so 18 segments.\n> \n> Segment at index 10: there are 7 segments after it (11 to 17).\n> \n> After 7 moves with no food, the tail will be the segment that was at index 10 (since after 7 moves, tail is old index 17-7=10?

From the head at (1,5), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: (0,5) - Wall (x=0). **Invalid**.\n2. **Right (R)**: (2,5) - Occupied by the snake's body (segment 1). **Invalid** (collision).\n3. **Up (U)**: (1,6) - Empty. **Valid**.\n4. **Down (D)**: (1,4) - Empty. **Valid**.\n\nSo, the valid immediate moves are **Up (U)** or **Down (D)**.\n\n### Evaluating Move Up (U) to (1,6)\n\nIf we choose **U**:\n\n- New head position: (1,6).\n- New direction: Up (U).\n  \nNext possible moves from (1,6):\n\n- **Up (U)**: (1,7) - Wall (y=7). **Invalid**.\n- **Down (D)**: Reverse of current direction. **Not allowed**.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,6) - Wall (x=0). **Invalid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,6) - Empty. **Valid**.\n\nSo, the only possible move next would be **R** to (2,6).\n\nFrom (2,6):\n\n- New head position: (2,6).\n- New direction: Right (R).\n\nNext possible moves from (2,6):\n\n- **Right (R)**: (3,6) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 4). **Invalid** (collision).\n- **Left (L)**: Reverse of current direction. **Not allowed**.\n- **Up (U)**: (2,7) - Wall (y=7). **Invalid**.\n- **Down (D)**: (2,5) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 2). **Invalid** (collision).\n\nThis leads to a dead end on turn 86 with no valid moves, causing the snake to die.\n\n### Evaluating Move Down (D) to (1,4)\n\nIf we choose **D**:\n\n- New head position: (1,4).\n- New direction: Down (D).\n\nNext possible moves from (1,4):\n\n- **Down (D)**: (1,3) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Up (U)**: Reverse of current direction. **Not allowed**.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,4) - Wall (x=0). **Invalid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,4) - Empty. **Valid**.\n\nSo, possible moves: **D** to (1,3) or **R** to (2,4).\n\n#### Option 1: Move D to (1,3)\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\n- New head position: (1,3).\n- New direction: Down (D).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Down (D)**: (1,2) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Up (U)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,3) - Wall. **Invalid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,3) - Empty (tail was at (2,3), now moved). **Valid**.\n\nChoose **D** to (1,2):\n\nFrom (1,2):\n\n- New head position: (1,2).\n- New direction: Down (D).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Down (D)**: (1,1) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Up (U)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,2) - Wall. **Invalid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,2) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 17). **Invalid**.\n\nChoose **D** to (1,1):\n\nFrom (1,1):\n\n- New head position: (1,1).\n- New direction: Down (D).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Down (D)**: (1,0) - Wall (y=0). **Invalid**.\n- **Up (U)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Left (L)**: (0,1) - Wall. **Invalid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (2,1) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 16). **Invalid**.\n\nDead end at turn 87.\n\n#### Option 2: Move R to (2,4)\n\nFrom (2,4):\n\n- New head position: (2,4).\n- New direction: Right (R).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Right (R)**: (3,4) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Left (L)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Up (U)**: (2,5) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 2). **Invalid**.\n- **Down (D)**: (2,3) - Empty. **Valid**.\n\nChoose **R** to (3,4):\n\nFrom (3,4):\n\n- New head position: (3,4).\n- New direction: Right (R).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Right (R)**: (4,4) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Left (L)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Up (U)**: (3,5) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 3). **Invalid**.\n- **Down (D)**: (3,3) - Empty. **Valid**.\n\nChoose **R** to (4,4):\n\nFrom (4,4):\n\n- New head position: (4,4).\n- New direction: Right (R).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Right (R)**: (5,4) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 10). **Invalid**.\n- **Left (L)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Up (U)**: (4,5) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Down (D)**: (4,3) - Empty. **Valid**.\n\nChoose **D** to (4,3):\n\nFrom (4,3):\n\n- New head position: (4,3).\n- New direction: Down (D).\n\nNext possible moves:\n\n- **Down (D)**: (4,2) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Up (U)**: Reverse. **Not allowed**.\n- **Left (L)**: (3,3) - Empty. **Valid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (5,3) - Occupied by snake's body (segment 11). **Invalid**.\n\nThis path allows the snake to survive longer without immediately hitting a dead end.\n\n### Food Accessibility\n\nBoth food items are under the snake's body:\n\n- (5,2): Under segment 11.\n- (3,6): Under segment 3.\n\nTo eat them:\n\n1. The body segment must move away, vacating the cell.\n2. The head must then move onto the vacated food cell.\n\nHowever, for a body segment to vacate its cell:\n\n- It must be the tail segment when the snake moves, as only the tail's previous position is vacated after a move.\n- For (5,2) to become the tail, it would take 7 moves without eating (since it's segment 11 out of 18). But the food disappears after turn 89 (current turn 84 + 5 more turns), so it's impossible.\n- Similarly, (3,6) would take 15 moves to become the tail, but it disappears after turn 91.\n\nThus, **neither food can be eaten within their remaining lifespan**.\n\n### Optimal Strategy\n\nGiven that the food cannot be eaten, the best strategy is to **maximize survival time** by navigating to open areas and avoiding immediate dead ends.\n\n- Moving **Up (U)** leads to a quick dead end on turn 86.\n- Moving **Down (D)** allows for more extended survival by navigating towards less crowded areas.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above, the optimal immediate action is to move **Down (D)** at turn 84 to (1,4), followed by moving right to explore open spaces.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the **immediate action for the current Turn 84**, not the sequence. Given the analysis, the best immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 84, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid, since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7.

Let me confirm.\n> \n> The grid has walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except for internal obstacles. There's one internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: The snake has 18 segments, from head to tail: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]. Head is at (1,5) and it's moving left, so current direction is L.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - One at (5,2) with value 1 and life span 6. So it disappears after 6 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So at turn 84, life span is 6, meaning it will be there for turns 84,85,86,87,88,89, and disappear after that? No, let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Let's think.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", so N is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn.\n> \n> For example, if life_span=1, it disappears after this turn, so it can be eaten only on this turn.\n> \n> If life_span=2, it can be eaten on this turn or next turn, and disappears after next turn.\n> \n> In this case, life_span=6 on turn 84, so it can be eaten from turn 84 to turn 89, and disappears after turn 89? Turn 84 is the first turn it's present, life_span decreases to 5 on turn 85, etc., down to 0 on turn 89, and disappears after turn 89.

It's turn 85, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). That's 18 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> The head direction is down (D), which means from (1,4), moving down would go to (1,3), but let's confirm the coordinates. Typically, in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The walls are given with y=0 and y=7, and snake positions: (1,4) to (1,5) which is up if y increases upwards? But head direction is D, down.\n> \n> Let's clarify the coordinate system. Positions: head at (1,4), next segment (1,5). Since (1,5) has a higher y-value, that means y=5 is above y=4 if we assume y increases upwards. But head direction is down, so moving down decreases y. From (1,4), moving down to (1,3) would decrease y.\n> \n> But in the list, after head (1,4), it's (1,5), which has higher y, so the snake was moving up to get to (1,4) from (1,5)? No, the positions are listed from head to tail. Head is first: (1,4), then (1,5), so the head is at (1,4) and the next body part is at (1,5), which means the snake moved from (1,5) to (1,4)? That doesn't make sense because if head is at (1,4) and previous position was (1,5), that would be moving down if y decreases downwards? I think I have a confusion in coordinate system.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Snake Positions: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), ...]\" so head is (1,4), then neck is (1,5), so the segment behind head is at (1,5). Since head is at (1,4) and neck at (1,5), that means the snake is moving away from (1,5) towards (1,4), so if y=5 is higher than y=4, then moving from higher y to lower y is down. Yes, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, I assume. So moving down decreases y, moving up increases y.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, down, which matches: from (1,4), moving down would go to (1,3).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1 and life_span 5\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1 and life_span 7\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life_span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food, but we need to check if eating them is safe.\n> \n> Life_span: for (5,2), life_span=5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Current turn is 85, so it will disappear on turn 90 if not eaten? Life_span decreases every turn, including current, so if life_span=5 at turn 85, it will be gone after turn 89? Let's see: at turn 85, life_span=5; turn 86, life_span=4; ... turn 89, life_span=1; turn 90, it disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn 89.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) life_span=7, so disappears after turn 91.\n> \n> (2,5) life_span=10, disappears after turn 94.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n> \n> Head: (1,4)\n> \n> Body: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)\n> \n> Tail is (2,2)\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (5,2): but (5,2) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (5,2), which is the 13th segment? Let's count: positions index from 0: head (1,4)=0, (1,5)=1, (2,5)=2, (3,5)=3, (3,6)=4, (4,6)=5, (5,6)=6, (6,6)=7, (6,5)=8, (5,5)=9, (5,4)=10, (5,3)=11, (5,2)=12, (5,1)=13, (4,1)=14, (3,1)=15, (2,1)=16, (2,2)=17. So (5,2) is the 12th segment, not the tail. Tail is (2,2).\n> \n> But food is at (5,2), which is currently occupied by the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,6): (3,6) is occupied by the snake? Snake has (3,6) as the 4th position? Positions: (3,6) is index 4, so yes, occupied.\n> \n> And food at (2,5): (2,5) is index 2, occupied.\n> \n> So all three food items are currently under the snake's body.\n> \n> For each, to eat them, the snake needs to move such that the body leaves that cell, and then head moves in.\n> \n> But we also have the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's find possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (1,4), direction down (D). So from (1,4), moving down would go to (1,3).\n> \n> Possible directions: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot instantly reverse. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up), because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Reverse of down is up, so cannot move up.\n> \n> Possible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> Now, check each for collision.\n> \n> Move D to (1,3): is this a wall? x=1, y=3. Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (1,3) is within bounds. Obstacle at (3,2), not (1,3). Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). (1,3) is not in this list, so empty. So moving to (1,3) is safe for now.\n> \n> Move L to (0,4): but x=0 is wall, so collision, death. Cannot move left.\n> \n> Move R to (2,4): (2,4) not in snake positions? Snake has (2,5), (2,1), (2,2), but not (2,4). And not wall, so possible.\n> \n> (2,4) is not occupied, yes.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (1,3) or R to (2,4).\n> \n> Cannot move U because reverse, and L to wall.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, the food: all under body, so need to plan how to eat them safely.\n> \n> First, food at (5,2): currently occupied. When the snake moves, the tail will move, but since the food is under a body segment, not necessarily tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,2), food at (5,2) is middle body.\n> \n> To eat (5,2), we need the snake to move so that (5,2) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> But (5,2) has life_span 5, so we have until turn 89 to eat it.\n> \n> Current turn 85, so 5 turns including this? Life_span decreases each turn, so at turn 85, life_span=5, so it can be eaten on turns 85,86,87,88,89? No.\n> \n> The food is present as long as life_span > 0, I think. When life_span decreases to 0, it disappears.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning at turn t+L it is gone.\n> \n> For (5,2) at turn 85, life_span=5, so it exists at turns 85,86,87,88,89? Disappears after turn 89, so last chance to eat is turn 89 when life_span=1, then after that, gone.\n> \n> Similarly, at turn t, if life_span=1, it can be eaten that turn, then disappears.\n> \n> So for (5,2), life_span=5 at turn 85, so can be eaten on turns 85 to 89 inclusive? Turn 85: life_span=5, after eating or not, at end of turn, life_span decreases to 4 for next turn.\n> \n> The state is at the beginning of turn, I think.\n> \n> \"Current Turn: t_1=85\" and food has life_span, which decreases every turn including current, so at start of turn 85, food has life_span=5 for (5,2).\n> \n> After the snake moves and if it eats, the food is consumed, else at end of turn, life_span decreases by 1.\n> \n> So for (5,2), at turn 85, if not eaten, at turn 86, life_span=4, and so on, until turn 89: life_span=1, if not eaten, after turn 89, it disappears, so cannot be eaten on turn 90.\n> \n> So can be eaten on turns 85 to 89.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> But (5,2) is currently occupied, so cannot eat now unless it moves away.\n> \n> Now, similarly, (3,6) life_span=7, so up to turn 91.\n> \n> (2,5) life_span=10, up to turn 94.\n> \n> Now, back to current move.\n> \n> From (1,4), I can go D to (1,3) or R to (2,4).\n> \n> I need to think about accessing the food and safety.\n> \n> Also, the snake is long, 18 segments, so space is limited, need to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, walls at borders, obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,4), body to tail (2,2).\n> \n> Food under body at (5,2), (3,6), (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is a body segment, index 2.\n> \n> To eat (2,5), it needs to be vacated.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> First, let's consider possible sequences.\n> \n> Option 1: Move down to (1,3)\n> \n> Then from (1,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Current direction would be D, since moved down.\n> \n> From (1,3), can move D to (1,2), L to (0,2) wall, R to (2,3), U to (1,4) but (1,4) is now the neck, since head moved to (1,3), so body segments shift, (1,4) is now occupied by the segment that was behind head.\n> \n> After move, head at new position, tail moves forward if no food eaten.\n> \n> If move to (1,3), no food there, so tail moves from (2,2) to next? When snake moves, if not eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> So after moving to (1,3):\n> \n> New head: (1,3)\n> \n> Then body: (1,4) which was previous head, now neck, then (1,5), (2,5), etc., and tail (2,2) moves to? The last segment was (2,2), and it moves to the position of the previous segment? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Previous positions: head (1,4), then segments: [ (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ..., (2,2) ]\n> \n> After moving head to (1,3), the new positions: head (1,3), then the first body segment is at previous head position (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), ..., up to the second last segment, and tail moves to the position that was (2,1) or something.\n> \n> The snake has 18 segments. After moving, head to new cell, each subsequent segment takes the place of the previous one in the list.\n> \n> So new position list: head at (1,3), then segment 1 at (1,4), segment 2 at (1,5), segment 3 at (2,5), segment 4 at (3,5), ..., segment 16 at (2,1), segment 17 at (2,2)? Let's index.\n> \n> Previous: index 0: (1,4) head\n> \n> Index 1: (1,5)\n> \n> Index 2: (2,5)\n> \n> Index 3: (3,5)\n> \n> Index 4: (3,6)\n> \n> Index 5: (4,6)\n> \n> Index 6: (5,6)\n> \n> Index 7: (6,6)\n> \n> Index 8: (6,5)\n> \n> Index 9: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 10: (5,4)\n> \n> Index 11: (5,3)\n> \n> Index 12: (5,2)\n> \n> Index 13: (5,1)\n> \n> Index 14: (4,1)\n> \n> Index 15: (3,1)\n> \n> Index 16: (2,1)\n> \n> Index 17: (2,2) tail\n> \n> After moving head to (1,3), new head at (1,3)\n> \n> Then body:\n> \n> Index 0 now at previous index 0 position: (1,4)\n> \n> Index 1 at previous index 1 position: (1,5)\n> \n> Index 2 at previous index 2 position: (2,5)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to index 16 at previous index 16 position: (2,1)\n> \n> And tail, index 17, is removed, so the tail cell (2,2) is vacated.\n> \n> The new tail is the segment that was at index 16, (2,1), but since all segments shift, the new position for index 17 is not there, so the tail is gone, and the new snake has segments from new head to previous index 16.\n> \n> New positions: head (1,3)\n> \n> Then: (1,4) [previous head], (1,5) [prev index1], (2,5) [prev index2], (3,5) [3], (3,6) [4], (4,6) [5], (5,6) [6], (6,6) [7], (6,5) [8], (5,5) [9], (5,4) [10], (5,3) [11], (5,2) [12], (5,1) [13], (4,1) [14], (3,1) [15], (2,1) [16]\n> \n> Previous index 17 (2,2) is gone, so new tail is at (2,1), and (2,2) is empty.\n> \n> Also, food at (5,2) is still there, under the body, but now it's at position of index 12 in new list? New list: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) — so (5,2) is occupied by the segment that was previously at (5,3)? Previous index 11 was (5,3), now it's at (5,2) in new positions? Let's clarify.\n> \n> After move, the cell (5,2) is still occupied by the snake, because the segment that was at (5,2) is now at (5,1) or something.\n> \n> Previous: (5,2) was index 12.\n> \n> After move, the segment that was index 12 is now at the position of index 11? No.\n> \n> The positions shift: the segment that was at index i is now at the position of index i-1 for i>0.\n> \n> Segment that was index 0 is no longer, new head at new position.\n> \n> Segment that was index 1 is now at position of previous index 0.\n> \n> Segment that was index 2 is now at position of previous index 1.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Segment that was index 17 is now at position of previous index 16.\n> \n> Previous index 16 was (2,1), so segment that was tail (index 17) is now at (2,1).\n> \n> And previous index 17 position (2,2) is vacated.\n> \n> For (5,2): previous index 12 was at (5,2). After move, the segment that was index 12 is now at the position of previous index 11, which is (5,3)? Previous index 11 was (5,3), so segment that was index 12 is now at (5,3)? Let's list new positions:\n> \n> - New head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Body 1: previous head position (1,4)\n> \n> - Body 2: previous index 1 position (1,5)\n> \n> - Body 3: previous index 2 position (2,5)\n> \n> - Body 4: previous index 3 position (3,5)\n> \n> - Body 5: previous index 4 position (3,6)\n> \n> - Body 6: previous index 5 position (4,6)\n> \n> - Body 7: previous index 6 position (5,6)\n> \n> - Body 8: previous index 7 position (6,6)\n> \n> - Body 9: previous index 8 position (6,5)\n> \n> - Body 10: previous index 9 position (5,5)\n> \n> - Body 11: previous index 10 position (5,4)\n> \n> - Body 12: previous index 11 position (5,3)\n> \n> - Body 13: previous index 12 position (5,2)  // segment that was at (5,2) is now at (5,2)?

Let's count: head (2,4) is index 0, then (1,4) idx1, (1,5) idx2, (2,5) idx3, (3,5) idx4, (3,6) idx5, (4,6) idx6, (5,6) idx7, (6,6) idx8, (6,5) idx9, (5,5) idx10, (5,4) idx11, (5,3) idx12, (5,2) idx13, (5,1) idx14, etc. (5,2) is index 13 in the list, but positions start from head.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n> \n> So (5,2) is at position 13, which is a body segment. Since the snake moves, when the head moves, the tail moves, so if the head moves away, and later the tail moves, the food at (5,2) might become accessible, but only if the snake moves such that the head can reach it after the body has moved.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,6): value 1, life span 6. (3,6) is also a body segment; from positions, (3,6) is index 5.\n> \n> Food at (2,5): value 1, life span 9. (2,5) is index 3 in the snake positions.\n> \n> All food is under the snake's body! So I can only eat them if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk with tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's find where the tail is. Tail is the last segment, (2,1).\n> \n> The head is at (2,4), which is not adjacent to (2,1). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,4) and (2,1) are not adjacent; they are three cells apart vertically.\n> \n> Possible adjacent cells to tail: (2,1) can be adjacent to (1,1), (3,1), (2,0), (2,2), but (2,0) is wall since y=0 is wall, and (1,1) or (3,1) might be occupied.\n> \n> (3,1) is part of snake, (1,1) is not in positions, so probably free, but walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so (2,0) is wall, (2,2) might be free or not.\n> \n> I should map the grid to see free cells.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, cells from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (3,2).\n> \n> So, (3,2) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, snake occupies: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> From positions: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> Also, food at (5,2), (3,6), (2,5), but since under body, not accessible yet.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,2), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn. So on turn 86, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 89? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Turn t, life span N, so it exists for this turn and N-1 more turns, so disappears after turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For (5,2): at turn 86, life span 4, so exists on turns 86,87,88,89, disappears after turn 89? Disappears after N turns, so if N=4, it disappears after 4 turns, meaning it is not there on turn 90.\n> \n> Standard: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t, life span N; turn t+1, life span N-1; ... turn t+N-1, life span 1; on turn t+N, it disappears, so not present.\n> \n> For (5,2): turn 86, life span 4 → exists until turn 89 (since on turn 89, life span 1; after that, gone).\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6): life span 6 at turn 86 → exists until turn 91.\n> \n> (2,5): life span 9 at turn 86 → exists until turn 94.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from head (2,4) with direction R.\n> \n> Options: U to (2,5), D to (2,3), R to (3,4)\n> \n> But (2,5) has food, but it's under the snake body. Specifically, (2,5) is the 3rd segment in the positions. When the snake moves, the body will shift.\n> \n> To eat food under body, two conditions: body moves away, then head moves onto it.\n> \n> So for (2,5), since it's a body segment, not the head, it can be eaten if the snake moves such that the tail moves off it or something.\n> \n> Let's think about the snake movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail moves off its current position.\n> \n> For a food under a body segment at position k, it can be eaten only if that segment is the tail when the head moves onto it? No.\n> \n> The rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So, for a cell that was occupied by body, if the snake moves such that that cell is no longer occupied (body moves away), and then later the head moves onto that cell, it can be eaten.\n> \n> For example, for food at (2,5), which is currently occupied. When the snake moves, if (2,5) is not the tail, it might still be occupied or not, depending on the movement.\n> \n> Let's simulate the snake positions.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (2,4) head, 1: (1,4), 2: (1,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (5,6), 8: (6,6), 9: (6,5), 10: (5,5), 11: (5,4), 12: (5,3), 13: (5,2), 14: (5,1), 15: (4,1), 16: (3,1), 17: (2,1) tail.\n> \n> If the head moves to a new position, say to (3,4), then new positions: head at (3,4), then segment 1: old head (2,4), segment 2: old pos1 (1,4), segment 3: old pos2 (1,5), and so on, up to segment 17: old pos16 (3,1), and tail old pos17 (2,1) is left, so the cell (2,1) is now free, but it had no food.\n> \n> The food is at (2,5), which is current position of index 3.\n> \n> If the snake moves, index 3 will be at old position of index 2 or something. Let's see:\n> \n> After one move, say head to (3,4), then positions become: [(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] and tail at (3,1), so (2,1) is free.\n> \n> But (2,5) is now at index 4, still occupied.\n> \n> To free up (2,5), it needs to be the tail position when it moves off.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> Also, for (5,2), it's index 13, so it will take many moves for it to be the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (2,1), and the food is at (5,2), which is far in the body.\n> \n> The distance from head to that segment: (5,2) is at index 13, so it will become tail after 13 moves? When the head moves 13 times, that segment will be the tail and will move off.\n> \n> Current tail index 17, positions have 18 segments, so indices 0 to 17.\n> \n> When head moves, the segment at index k becomes the position of index k-1 for k>0, and index 0 is new head position.\n> \n> The cell that was occupied by the tail (index 17) is abandoned.\n> \n> For a body segment at position k, it will be abandoned when it becomes the tail, which happens after the head has made (17 - k) moves, since there are 18 segments, indices 0 to 17, so for a segment at index k, it will be the tail after (17 - k) moves, and on the next move, it moves off and the cell is free.\n> \n> For example, food at (2,5) which is index 3. k=3, so after (17-3) = 14 moves, it will be the tail. Then on the 15th move, when head moves, the tail moves off and (2,5) is free, and then if head moves onto it, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,6) at index 5, k=5, after (17-5)=12 moves, it will be tail, then on 13th move it moves off.\n> \n> For (5,2) at index 13, k=13, after (17-13)=4 moves, it will be tail, then on 5th move it moves off.\n> \n> Let's confirm.\n> \n> After M moves, the segment that was at index i will be at index i+M if i+M <=17, but when i+M >17, it's gone.\n> \n> The cell at position of index k will be free after (17 - k) moves, because after (17-k) moves, the segment that was at k is now at k + (17-k) = 17, so it is the tail. Then on the next move (the (17-k+1)th move), when the head moves, the tail moves to the position of the previous segment, so the cell is free.\n> \n> So for food at (5,2), k=13, after (17-13)=4 moves, it is the tail. Then on the 5th move, it moves off and (5,2) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,6), k=5, after (17-5)=12 moves, it is tail, then on 13th move free.\n> \n> For (2,5), k=3, after 14 moves tail, on 15th move free.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (5,2) life span 4 at turn 86, so exists until turn 89 (turns 86,87,88,89), disappears on turn 90.\n> \n> It will be free on the 5th move from now.\n> \n> Let t be turn 86.\n> \n> After 4 moves, on turn 90, the segment at (5,2) is now the tail? Let's see the timing.\n> \n> At turn t=86, positions as given.\n> \n> After first move (turn 87), positions shift, the cell (5,2) is now occupied by the segment that was at index 12 or something? Better not to think of indices.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) is currently occupied by the snake. It will be vacated when the segment that is now at (5,2) becomes the tail and moves off.\n> \n> That segment is at index 13 now. After d moves, it will be at index 13 - d, because each move, indices decrease for body segments? Positions: after one move, the segment that was at index 1 is now at index 2, but the position changes.\n> \n> The index of a fixed segment decreases over moves.\n> \n> At turn t, segment at index k has a position.\n> \n> After one move, that same segment is now at index k+1, for k from 0 to 16, and index 17 is gone.\n> \n> For the cell (5,2), it is occupied by a specific segment. When that segment becomes the tail, which is when its index is 17.\n> \n> Currently at t=86, the segment at (5,2) has index 13.\n> \n> After each move, its index increases by 1, because the head is added, so all indices shift down.\n> \n> After one move, that segment is at index 14.\n> \n> After two moves, index 15.\n> \n> After three moves, index 16.\n> \n> After four moves, index 17, so it is the tail at turn 90? Let's see:\n> \n> At turn 86: index 13 at (5,2)\n> \n> After move on turn 86 to turn 87: head moves to new position, so at turn 87, positions: head at new pos, then old head at index 1, old index 1 at index 2, ..., old index 16 at index 17, old index 17 gone. So the segment that was at index 13 at t86 is now at index 14 at t87.\n> \n> Similarly, at t87, it is index 14.\n> \n> After move to t88, it becomes index 15.\n> \n> t88 to t89: index 16.\n> \n> t89 to t90: index 17, so at turn 90, it is the tail.\n> \n> Then, when the snake moves on turn 90 to turn 91, the tail moves to the position of index 16 at t90, so the cell (5,2) is vacated and free at turn 91.\n> \n> But the food at (5,2) has life span until turn 89. At turn 89, life span is 1, so it exists. At turn 90, life span 0, disappears, so not there.\n> \n> Therefore, when (5,2) is vacated on turn 91, the food is already gone since it disappeared on turn 90.\n> \n> Life span: at turn t, life span N, so:\n> \n> - Turn t: life span N, present\n> \n> - Turn t+1: life span N-1, present if N-1 >0\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + N -1: life span 1, present\n> \n> - Turn t + N: life span 0, not present\n> \n> For (5,2): t=86, N=4, so present on turns 86,87,88,89 (since on turn 89, life span=1). On turn 90, not present.\n> \n> Vacation of (5,2) happens on turn 91 when the tail moves off, but food is gone on turn 90, so (5,2) is vacated but no food to eat. So cannot eat (5,2) at all.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (3,6): at index 5, t=86, N=6, exists until turn 91 (turns 86 to 91, since turn 91: t+5, life span=1? t=86, N=6.\n> \n> Turn 86: N=6\n> \n> Turn 87: N=5\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 91: N=1 (since 86 to 91 is 6 turns?

But for planning, I need to decide actions starting from turn 87.\n> \n> Current turn is 87, and I need to output actions for turn 87, 88, etc.\n> \n> Also, food at (5,2), (3,6), (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is a food position, but let's see if it's under the snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), ... so (2,5) is part of the snake body! Specifically, it's the fifth segment.\n> \n> Food is at (2,5) with life span 8. But since it's under the snake body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is also a food position, and snake has a segment at (3,6), which is the seventh segment: positions index 6 (0-based: head=0, (2,3); 1: (2,4); 2: (1,4); 3: (1,5); 4: (2,5); 5: (3,5); 6: (3,6); etc.)\n> \n> So food at (3,6) is under the snake body at position (3,6).\n> \n> Food at (5,2) is also listed, but let's see snake positions: ... (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) — tail is at (3,1). (5,2) is not in the snake positions, so it should be free, but (5,2) has a wall? No, walls are border and (3,2). (5,2) should be accessible.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7; y=0,7; and internal (3,2). So (5,2) is not a wall, it's free.\n> \n> Now, for food under body: (2,5) and (3,6) are both under snake body, so to eat them, the snake must move such that the body leaves those cells, then head moves there.\n> \n> But since the snake moves, segments shift, so when the tail moves away, the food might become accessible if head can reach it.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk with tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because after eating, tail doesn't move, so head collides with new tail.\n> \n> First, let's find where the tail is.\n> \n> Snake positions: last one is (3,1), so tail at (3,1).\n> \n> Head is at (2,3). Distance to tail: (2,3) to (3,1) is not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (2,3) and (3,1): x differs by 1, y by 2, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells would be like (2,2), (2,4), (1,3), (3,3) — but (2,4) is occupied by snake body, (1,3) might be free, (3,3) might be free, (2,2) might be free.\n> \n> Let me sketch a grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, since borders are walls, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except (3,2) is obstacle.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacle at (3,2), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (2,3)\n> \n> - Body: (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) — tail.\n> \n> (5,2) is listed as a body segment? Positions: ... (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), ... so (5,2) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> But food is at (5,2) with value 1 and life span 3.\n> \n> Food at (5,2) is under the snake body? Yes, it's occupied by the snake, so it's under the body.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,6) is under body, and (2,5) under body.\n> \n> All three food items are currently under the snake body.\n> \n> - Food at (5,2): snake has segment at (5,2), which is position index 13 or so? Let's count: head (2,3)=0, (2,4)=1, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=3, (2,5)=4, (3,5)=5, (3,6)=6, (4,6)=7, (5,6)=8, (6,6)=9, (6,5)=10, (5,5)=11, (5,4)=12, (5,3)=13, (5,2)=14, (5,1)=15, (4,1)=16, (3,1)=17 tail.\n> \n> So (5,2) is index 14, (3,6) is index 6, (2,5) is index 4.\n> \n> All covered.\n> \n> To eat them, the snake must move so that the body leaves those cells, and then head moves onto them when they are empty.\n> \n> Since the snake moves, the body segments shift; when the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so cells that were occupied might become free.\n> \n> For example, when the snake moves in a direction, the head goes to a new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and the tail cell is vacated, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail moves, so the cell is free.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows, and the cell remains occupied.\n> \n> But for food under body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away first.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,2), it's occupied, so when the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail will move from (3,1), so (3,1) is vacated, but (5,2) is still occupied until that segment moves.\n> \n> The food at (5,2) is under segment 14. When the snake moves, segment 14 will move to where segment 13 was, and so on, so (5,2) might be vacated only when the tail moves past it, but since it's not the tail, it takes many moves.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> I need to think about the snake's movement and path.\n> \n> First, let's list free cells or possible moves.\n> \n> Head at (2,3), direction down. So possible moves: cannot go up (reverse), so can go down, left, right? Directions: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> From (2,3):\n> \n> - Down: to (2,2) — y decreases? y=3, down to y=2? Let's define coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 at bottom or top? But here, walls are y=0 and y=7, but since borders are walls, we play in y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Snake head at (2,3), and positions: (2,4) is above it, since y=4 > y=3, so y increases up? Or down?\n> \n> Head direction D, down. If it was moving down, from where to (2,3)? If it came from (2,4) to (2,3), that would be moving down, decreasing y. So probably y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top? Let's see.\n> \n> Positions: head (2,3), then (2,4) — so (2,4) has higher y, so if (2,4) is north of (2,3), then moving to (2,3) is south, down.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is west of (2,4), etc.\n> \n> So coordinate system: x from left to right, y from bottom to top? Head at (2,3), moved down to it, so from higher y to lower y, so y=3 to y=2 would be further down, decreasing y.\n> \n> From (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,4) — but (2,4) is occupied by snake body (segment 1), so collision, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,2) — what is at (2,2)? Is it free? Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,2) is within 1-6, not (3,2) obstacle (3,2) is at x=3,y=2, so (2,2) should be free, no snake? Snake positions: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), etc., no (2,2), so (2,2) is free.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,3) — x=1,y=3, within bounds, not wall, not in snake positions? Positions have (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,3), so should be free.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (3,3) — x=3,y=3, not wall, not in snake positions? Snake has (3,5), (3,6), (3,1), but (3,3)? Not listed, so free.\n> \n> (3,3) should be free, since not occupied.\n> \n> But obstacle at (3,2), which is below, not (3,3).\n> \n> So from (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,4) — occupied, invalid\n> \n> - D: to (2,2) — free\n> \n> - L: to (1,3) — free\n> \n> - R: to (3,3) — free\n> \n> But head direction is D, down, so if I move up, it's reverse, which is not allowed only if it's the opposite direction. Current direction D, so opposite is U, which is invalid anyway because occupied. So for next move, I can choose D, L, or R since U is opposite and also occupied.\n> \n> No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction, so from D, I cannot move U. But U is invalid anyway, so I can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and survival.\n> \n> Food under body: (5,2) has life span 3, so it will disappear in 3 turns, by turn 90. Since current turn 87, after this move, turn 88, then 89, gone at turn 90. So it has 3 turns left, including turn 87? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 87, life span 3, so after turn 87, countdown to 2; after turn 88, to 1; after turn 89, to 0, so it disappears before turn 90, I think. At the start of turn 90, it might be gone.\n> \n> But for eating, on a turn, if head moves to food cell, it eats it.\n> \n> So for (5,2), it can be eaten on turns 87,88,89, since after that it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) life span 5, so disappears after turn 92? Turn 87: countdown 5, after turn 87: 4, turn 88:3, turn89:2, turn90:1, turn91:0, so gone before turn 92. Can be eaten on turns 87 to 91.\n> \n> (2,5) life span 8, disappears after turn 95, can be eaten turns 87 to 94.\n> \n> But all are under body now, so need to be exposed first.\n> \n> Now, the snake is long, 18 segments? Positions have 18 elements: from (2,3) to (3,1), 18 cells.\n> \n> Length 18.\n> \n> To eat (5,2), which is segment 14, it will take many moves for that cell to be vacated, since the tail is at (3,1), index 17.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves, so the last segment is removed, and a new head is added.\n> \n> To free (5,2), which is not the tail, we need to move the snake so that the segment at (5,2) moves away, but it will only be vacated when it becomes the tail, which is far.\n> \n> The cell (5,2) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves to another position, but since the snake moves as a whole, the cell is only vacated when that segment is the tail and we move without eating food.\n> \n> Currently, (5,2) is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves without eating, the tail segment is removed, so the cell of the tail is vacated. But for (5,2), it's not the tail; the tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> So to vacate (5,2), we need to move the snake such that the segment at (5,2) eventually becomes the tail, which means moving many times without eating, so the tail shortens? No, without eating, the length stays the same, but the tail moves.\n> \n> When no food eaten, on each move, the tail is removed, so the snake shortens by one? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move, if no food, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so snake occupies the same number of cells, but shifted.\n> \n> So the cell that was tail is vacated, and the cell that was head is now body, new head position.\n> \n> For a body segment like (5,2), it will be vacated only when it becomes the tail position, which happens after many moves.\n> \n> Specifically, the segment at index 14 will become tail after (18-14) = 4 moves if no food eaten, since each move, the tail index decreases? Let's think.\n> \n> Positions: let's say segments S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., S17 (tail).\n> \n> After one move without eating, new head at new position, S1 becomes new S0? No.\n> \n> When you move in a direction, new head is adjacent cell, then each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So after move, the new positions are: new head, then old head, then S1, S2, ..., up to S16, and S17 is removed.\n> \n> So the segment that was at position k is now at position k+1 for k from 0 to 16, but the cell is the same only if not moving, but since moving, the cell changes.\n> \n> The cell that was occupied by Sk is now occupied by S_{k+1} for k from 0 to 16, and S17 cell is vacated.\n> \n> For example, cell at (5,2) is currently occupied by S14. After one move without eating, S14 will be occupied by S15, and S14 cell is no longer occupied by that segment, but S15 moves to S14 position? Let's see.\n> \n> After move, new head at say P, then position 1 is old head, position 2 is old S1, ..., position 17 is old S16, and old S17 is removed.\n> \n> So the cell that was S14 is now occupied by the segment that was S15, because S15 moves to the position of S14.\n> \n> Similarly, the cell of S17 is vacated.\n> \n> But for a specific cell, like (5,2), it was occupied by S14. After move, S15 moves to (5,2), so (5,2) is still occupied, now by S15 (which was at (5,3) or something).\n> \n> Then after another move, S16 moves to (5,2), and so on, until the segment that was at S17 moves to (5,2) when it becomes S16 or something.\n> \n> Actually, the cell (5,2) will be occupied until the tail moves past it, but since the segments are shifting, the cell remains occupied until the last segment that was behind it moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, since (5,2) is not the tail, it will take exactly the number of moves equal to the distance from tail to that segment to vacate it.\n> \n> Current tail is S17 at (3,1). S14 is at (5,2), so the segment at (5,2) is 3 positions ahead of tail? Indices: S14 is index 14, tail S17 index 17, so there are 3 segments after it: S15, S16, S17.\n> \n> To vacate the cell at (5,2), we need to move 3 times without eating, so that S17 is removed, then S16, then S15, and after 3 moves, S14 becomes the new tail, and when we move again, it is removed, vacating (5,2).\n> \n> After 3 moves without eating:\n> \n> - Move 1: new head, S0 removed, S1 to S16 shift, S17 removed. So S14 becomes S13, but the cell: the segment that was S14 moves to where S13 was, etc. It's messy.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that the cell (5,2) will be vacated after the number of moves equal to the number of segments between it and the tail inclusive.\n> \n> From S14 to S17, there are 4 segments: S14, S15, S16, S17.\n> \n> After 4 moves without eating, S14 will be the tail, and on the 5th move, it is vacated.\n> \n> Let's simulate with a smaller snake.\n> \n> Suppose snake: head A, B, C tail at positions P, Q, R.\n> \n> After move to new head D, positions: D (new head), A (body), B (body), C removed. So cell R vacated.\n> \n> If we want to vacate Q, which was B. Currently B at Q.\n> \n> After move 1: new head, say to S, positions: S, A, B removed? No: segments: new head S, then old head A, then old B, and C removed. So cell of C vacated, cell of B is now occupied by the segment that was B, but at different position? When moving to S, from A, say to adjacent.\n> \n> Old positions: head at A, body B at Q, tail C at R.\n> \n> Move to new cell S adjacent to A.\n> \n> New positions: head S, body at old head A, body at old B Q, and tail C removed, so cell R vacated. Cell Q is still occupied by the segment that was B, now it is the second body segment.\n> \n> Then after another move, to T adjacent to S, new positions: head T, body at S, body at A, and the segment at Q is removed? When moving, the last body segment is removed.\n> \n> After move 2: new head T, body at old head S, body at old body A, and the segment that was at Q (old B) is removed, so cell Q vacated.\n> \n> So to vacate a body cell, it takes a number of moves equal to the position from the tail.\n> \n> For a segment at position k from head (0=head), with length L, tail at L-1.\n> \n> To vacate the cell of segment at index k, it takes (L - 1 - k) moves without eating, because after (L-1-k) moves, that segment becomes the tail, and on the next move, it is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,2), index 14, L=18, so L-1=17, k=14, so moves to become tail: 17-14 = 3 moves. After 3 moves without eating, S14 becomes the new tail (since after 3 moves, the segment that was S14 is now at index L-1-3 or something, but let's not index).\n> \n> After m moves without eating, the tail segment is the one that was at index m from the end.\n> \n> After 0 moves, tail is S17.\n> \n> After 1 move, tail is S16 (now at position of S17).\n> \n> After 2 moves, tail is S15.\n> \n> After 3 moves, tail is S14.\n> \n> Then after 4th move, S14 is removed, vacating its cell.\n> \n> So for cell at (5,2), occupied by S14, it will be vacated after 4 moves without eating, on the 5th move when the head moves, the tail (which was S14) is removed.\n> \n> But the food is at (5,2), so to eat it, we need the head to move to (5,2) when it is free.\n> \n> But with 4 moves to vacate it, and life span 3, it will disappear before that, so impossible to eat (5,2) because it has only 3 turns left, but it takes at least 4 moves to vacate it, and after that it's gone.\n> \n> Life span 3 at turn 87: after turn 87, countdown to 2; after turn 88, to 1; after turn 89, to 0, so at turn 90, it is gone. So it can be eaten on turns 87,88,89 if head moves to it when free.\n> \n> But since it's occupied, and to free it takes 4 moves without eating, but we can't free it in time because after 4 moves, it's turn 91, but it's gone at turn 90.\n> \n> Start of turn 87: food at (5,2) with life span 3.\n> \n> After turn 87 action, if head moves, and if it eats food or not, but the food life span decreases after the turn.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So on turn t, before action, food has life span L.\n> \n> After action, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> If eaten during turn, it is removed.\n> \n> For turn 87, food at (5,2) has life span 3.\n> \n> After turn 87, if not eaten, life span becomes 2.\n> \n> Similarly for other turns.\n> \n> To eat on turn t, head moves to it during turn t.\n> \n> For (5,2), it is occupied, so cannot be eaten on turn 87.\n> \n> Even if we start moving to free it, it takes 4 moves to vacate, so earliest it can be free is after 4 moves, on turn 91.\n> \n> But after turn 89, life span: turn 87: L=3, after turn if not eaten, L=2.\n> \n> Turn 88: L=2, after turn not eaten, L=1.\n> \n> Turn 89: L=1, after turn not eaten, L=0, food disappears.\n> \n> So on turn 90, it is gone, cannot be eaten.\n> \n> On turn 89, if it were free and head moves to it, it can be eaten, but it won't be free by turn 89.\n> \n> After 2 moves without eating: on turn 88, after move, the segment at (5,2) is still occupied, but by a different segment.\n> \n> After 2 moves: turn 87 move, turn 88 move.\n> \n> After turn 87 move without eating, the segment at (5,2) is now occupied by S15 (which was S16 or something), still occupied.\n> \n> After turn 88 move without eating, occupied by S16, etc.\n> \n> Only after 4 moves, on turn 91, when we move, the cell is vacated, but food is already gone.\n> \n> So (5,2) cannot be eaten; it will disappear before it can be accessed.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,6), index 6, L=18, k=6, moves to vacate: L-1-k = 17-6=11 moves.\n> \n> Life span 5, so can be eaten up to turn 91, but 11 moves to vacate, impossible.\n> \n> Turn 87 to 91 is 5 turns, but 11 moves needed, not possible.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,5), index 4, k=4, L=18, moves to vacate: 17-4=13 moves, life span 8, up to turn 94, 13 moves to turn 99, not possible.\n> \n> But life span 8, from turn 87 to 94, that's 8 turns including 87, so 8 actions from 87 to 94.\n> \n> After 13 moves it would be turn 100, not possible.\n> \n> But we can eat food during the process to grow, which might change the indices, but since we're not eating, the length remains, so it takes many moves to free a body cell.\n> \n> Therefore, it's impossible to eat any of these foods because they are under the body and will disappear before the snake can expose them by moving away.\n> \n> Is that right?

Since the snake moves, when head moves, the tail moves, so if I move to (2,3), which is currently occupied, but after moving, the tail will move away, so it might be ok, but I need to check collision rules.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

After the move, the head would be at (2,3), and the second segment was there, but since the snake moves, the body follows, so if head moves to (2,3), which is where the neck is, that would be a collision because it's not the tail; the tail is at (4,1).\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn 88, positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (2,4), etc. to tail (4,1).\n> \n> If I move left to (2,3), that cell is currently occupied by the body segment at index 1 (after head). When I move, the head goes to (2,3), but at that moment, the body segment is still there? No, the movement happens simultaneously: head moves to new position, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So when head moves to (2,3), the segment that was at (2,3) will move to where? The segment at (2,3) was the neck, it will move to the new position of the head? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the segment that was behind it moves to where the head was, and so on.\n> \n> So if head moves from (3,3) to (2,3), then:\n> \n> - New head position: (2,3)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (2,3) moves to (3,3) (previous head position)\n> \n> - Then the segment that was at (2,4) moves to (2,3)?

Confusion.\n> \n> Better to think: each segment moves to the position of the next segment, but since head moves first.\n> \n> The body segments follow the head. So when head moves to a new cell, the first body segment moves to the old head position, the second to the old first body position, and so on, until the tail.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - Head moves from (3,3) to (2,3)\n> \n> - Then body segment at index 1 ( (2,3) ) must move to the old head position (3,3)\n> \n> - Body segment at index 2 ( (2,4) ) moves to the old position of index 1, which was (2,3), but (2,3) is now the head, so it moves to (2,3)?

Current positions: (3,4) is not in the list. Positions are: (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), etc. No (3,4), so (3,4) is free?

Is (4,3) occupied? Not in the list, so free.

        "thinking": "The analysis reveals that the snake is in a precarious position where any immediate move leads to a dead-end. However, the key insight is that the snake can safely move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, as the tail will move forward, avoiding a collision. \n\nGiven the current state:\n- **Head at (4,4)**, direction **U**.\n- **Possible moves**: U (to (4,5)), L (to (3,4)), or R (to (5,4)) — but R leads to a body collision (segment 15 at (5,4)), so only U or L are viable.\n- **Food**: All food is under the body, with (3,6) having the shortest lifespan (3 turns).\n\n### Immediate Action (Turn 90):\n- **Move L to (3,4)**: This avoids the dead-end created by moving U to (4,5), where the snake would be entirely surrounded at turn 91. Moving L to (3,4) at least opens the possibility of future moves, though the snake will still be constrained.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Turn 90 (Move L to (3,4))**:\n   - New head position: (3,4).\n   - Tail is at (5,2), which will move to (5,3) if no food is eaten (since the snake does not grow).\n   - The cell (3,4) is free, so this move is safe.\n\n2. **Turn 91 (From (3,4))**:\n   - Adjacent cells: \n     - U (3,5): Occupied by segment 9.\n     - D (3,3): Occupied by segment 3.\n     - L (2,4): Occupied by segment 5.\n     - R (4,4): Occupied by segment 1.\n   - All adjacent cells are occupied, but the snake can move into the tail cell (5,3) if it were adjacent (it is not). Thus, the snake has no safe move at turn 91 and will collide regardless of the direction chosen.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe snake is in a no-win situation where any move at turn 90 leads to an inevitable collision at turn 91. However, moving L to (3,4) is the least immediately harmful option, as moving U to (4,5) also leads to a dead-end with no escape. \n\n### Final Action:\n\\boxed{L}",

Positions:\n> \n> Head: (4,4)\n> \n> Then body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n> \n> Tail is at (5,2).\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (3,6): value 1, life span 3. Current turn 90, so it will disappear after turn 92? Life span 3, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 90, life span 3, meaning it has 3 turns left including this one. After turn 90, it has 2 left; after turn 91, 1 left; after turn 92, it disappears. So must be eaten by turn 92.\n> \n> - (2,5): value 1, life span 5. At turn 90, life span 5, so disappears after turn 94.\n> \n> - (5,3): value 1, life span 8. Disappears after turn 97.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about risks. One special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,2). Is there food at (5,2)? Food is at (3,6), (2,5), (5,3), not at (5,2), so no food on tail currently. But if I move, things might change.\n> \n> Also, food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> In this case, food at (3,6) and (2,5) are on the snake body? Let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,6) is part of the snake? Positions: ... (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), ... so (3,6) is occupied by the snake, specifically the 10th segment? Let's list indices:\n> \n> 0: head (4,4)\n> \n> 1: (4,3)\n> \n> 2: (3,3)\n> \n> 3: (2,3)\n> \n> 4: (2,4)\n> \n> 5: (1,4)\n> \n> 6: (1,5)\n> \n> 7: (2,5)\n> \n> 8: (3,5)\n> \n> 9: (3,6)\n> \n> 10: (4,6)\n> \n> 11: (5,6)\n> \n> 12: (6,6)\n> \n> 13: (6,5)\n> \n> 14: (5,5)\n> \n> 15: (5,4)\n> \n> 16: (5,3)\n> \n> 17: tail (5,2)\n> \n> So, food at (3,6) is at position of segment 9, which is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,5) is at position of segment 7.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is at segment 16.\n> \n> So, all three food items are currently under the snake's body.\n> \n> Therefore, to eat them, the body must move away, and then head must move onto that cell.\n> \n> For (3,6), it's at (3,6), which is segment 9. To eat it, segment 9 must be vacated, and head must move to (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Life spans: (3,6) has life span 3, so only 3 turns to be eaten, including current turn 90. So it must be eaten by turn 92.\n> \n> (2,5) life span 5, by turn 94.\n> \n> (5,3) life span 8, by turn 97.\n> \n> Now, since the snake is long, moving the body away takes time, and I need to plan the path.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid collisions: walls, obstacles, and body.\n> \n> Obstacle at (3,2), which is not on the path immediately.\n> \n> Head at (4,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R (since not D).\n> \n> - U: to (4,5)\n> \n> - L: to (3,4)\n> \n> - R: to (5,4)\n> \n> Now, check if these are safe.\n> \n> First, (4,5): is it occupied or wall?\n> \n> Walls: x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (4,5) is within 1-6, y=5 between 1 and 6, so not wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (3,2), not (4,5).\n> \n> Now, is (4,5) occupied by snake? Snake positions: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), ... (5,4) is segment 15, (5,5) is 14, (6,5) is 13, etc. (4,5) not in the list? Positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). So (4,5) is not occupied. Yes, it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4): not in positions, should be free? (3,4) not listed. Positions have (3,3), (3,5), (3,6), but no (3,4). Yes, free.\n> \n> (5,4) is segment 15, occupied. (5,4) is part of the body.\n> \n> (5,4) is position of segment 15: (5,4)\n> \n> So moving R to (5,4) would be moving into body segment, which is not safe because when the snake moves, the body moves, but if head moves to a body cell, it collides unless it's the tail.\n> \n> General rule: head cannot move to any body segment except the tail, because when head moves to a cell, if it's occupied by body, it collides, except if it's the tail, because tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, (5,4) is segment 15, not the tail. Tail is (5,2).\n> \n> So moving to (5,4) would cause collision with body segment.\n> \n> Therefore, R is not safe.\n> \n> L to (3,4): not occupied, not wall, so safe.\n> \n> U to (4,5): not occupied, not wall, safe.\n> \n> D is not possible because instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible actions: U or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think long-term to eat food, especially the one with short life span.\n> \n> (3,6) has only 3 turns left, and it's under the body at (3,6).\n> \n> To eat it, I need the body to move away from (3,6), and head to move to (3,6).\n> \n> Currently, (3,6) is occupied by segment 9.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each segment moves to the next position, so the body shifts.\n> \n> But for the cell to be vacated, the snake needs to move such that the segment that was at (3,6) moves away.\n> \n> Currently, segment 9 is at (3,6). When the snake moves, segment 9 will move to where segment 8 was? Let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail end is cut off or moved, depending on if food eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail stays, so no cell vacated, snake grows.\n> \n> But for a body cell to be vacated, it needs to be that when the snake moves, that segment is no longer occupied because the snake is moving away from it.\n> \n> Specifically for (3,6), segment 9 is there. After one move, segment 9 will move to where segment 8 is now, which is (3,5), and segment 10 will move to (3,6)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Positions: index 8: (3,5), index 9: (3,6), index 10: (4,6), etc.\n> \n> After one move, if head moves, say, to (4,5), then new head is (4,5), then segment 1 (was (4,3)) moves to (4,4)? Standard: new positions: head to new position, then segment 1 to old head position, segment 2 to old segment 1 position, and so on, up to tail.\n> \n> So after move, position 0: new head position\n> \n> Position 1: old head position\n> \n> Position 2: old position 1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Position k: old position k-1 for k>0\n> \n> Tail is removed if no food, or kept if food eaten.\n> \n> In terms of cells: the cell that was tail is vacated if no food eaten. Other cells may be vacated only if the snake moves in a way that a body segment is not reoccupied.\n> \n> But for a specific cell, like (3,6), it is occupied by segment 9. After one move, segment 9 will be at the position where segment 8 was, which is (3,5). So (3,6) will now be occupied by segment 10, which was at (4,6)? Let's see:\n> \n> After move, positions:\n> \n> - New head: wherever it moves\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head position\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 position\n> \n> - New segment 3: old segment 2 position\n> \n> ...\n> \n> - New segment 9: old segment 8 position, which is (3,5)\n> \n> - New segment 10: old segment 9 position, which is (3,6)\n> \n> - New segment 11: old segment 10 position, (4,6)\n> \n> etc.\n> \n> So (3,6) is now occupied by new segment 10, which was old segment 9? New segment 10 is at old segment 9 position, so (3,6) is still occupied, by the next segment.\n> \n> In fact, since the snake is contiguous, internal body cells don't get vacated by movement; only the tail cell might be vacated if no food eaten.\n> \n> Specifically, when the snake moves without eating food, the tail cell is vacated, and all other body cells shift but remain occupied.\n> \n> If the snake eats food, no cell is vacated; snake grows by one.\n> \n> Therefore, for a food under the body, like (3,6), which is under segment 9, it can only be eaten if that cell is vacated and head moves there.\n> \n> But since the body shifts, the cell (3,6) will only be vacated if the snake moves such that no segment is there, which typically happens when the tail leaves it or when the snake turns.\n> \n> In this case, (3,6) is occupied, and to vacate it, the snake must move in a way that the segment at (3,6) moves away and no other segment moves there immediately.\n> \n> But since the segments are connected, it's tricky.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves and the segment at (3,6) moves to a different cell, then (3,6) is free, but only if the tail is moving away or something.\n> \n> Let's think about the tail. The tail is at (5,2). If the snake moves and no food eaten, tail moves to where segment 16 was or something? Tail is segment 17 at (5,2).\n> \n> After move, if no food, segment 17 is removed, so (5,2) is vacated.\n> \n> For other cells, they are only vacated if the snake shortens or turns sharply.\n> \n> But in normal movement, internal cells are not vacated; they are just reoccupied by the next segment.\n> \n> However, if the snake turns, some cells might be left empty.\n> \n> For instance, if the head turns, the body follows, but cells behind may be vacated if the path changes.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,6), it is currently occupied. To vacate it, the snake needs to move such that when the segment that was at (3,6) moves to a new position, and no segment comes to (3,6), which means that the snake must be moving in a direction that leaves that cell empty.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, it might take multiple moves to vacate a body cell.\n> \n> But for food under body, it can only be eaten when the body moves away, meaning that cell is free, and head moves there.\n> \n> With life span short for (3,6), I need to act fast.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (3,6), life span 3, must be eaten by turn 92.\n> \n> Current turn 90.\n> \n> So I have turns 90, 91, 92 to eat it.\n> \n> If not eaten by turn 92, it disappears.\n> \n> Now, to eat (3,6), I need head to move to (3,6) when it is free.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 90, (3,6) is occupied.\n> \n> After one move, at turn 91, what happens?\n> \n> Suppose at turn 90, I move head.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (4,5) or L to (3,4).\n> \n> If I move U to (4,5), then new head (4,5), new segment 1: (4,4), new segment 2: (4,3), new segment 3: (3,3), and so on. Old segment 8 was (3,5), so new segment 9: (3,5), new segment 10: (3,6), so (3,6) is still occupied by segment 10.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (3,4), new head (3,4), new segment 1: (4,4), new segment 2: (4,3), new segment 3: (3,3), new segment 4: (2,3), etc. Old segment 8 was (3,5), new segment 9: (3,5), new segment 10: (3,6), so (3,6) still occupied.\n> \n> In both cases, after one move, (3,6) is still occupied.\n> \n> Now at turn 91, (3,6) has life span 2 left.\n> \n> If I move again, say at turn 91, head is at new position.\n> \n> But (3,6) is still occupied.\n> \n> To vacate (3,6), I need the snake to move such that the segment at (3,6) moves away and no segment replaces it.\n> \n> Currently, segment 10 is at (3,6) after turn 90 move?

        "thinking": "Let's carefully analyze the current state and possible moves for the snake at Turn 91.\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n- **Snake Head Position**: (3, 4)\n- **Current Direction**: L (Left)\n- **Adjacent Cells**:\n  - Left (L): (2, 4) - Occupied by snake body (segment 6)\n  - Right (R): (4, 4) - Occupied by snake body (segment 1) and is the reverse direction (invalid)\n  - Up (U): (3, 5) - Occupied by snake body (segment 9)\n  - Down (D): (3, 3) - Occupied by snake body (segment 3)\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **No Immediate Safe Moves**: All adjacent cells (L, U, D) are occupied by the snake's body, and moving into them would cause a collision. Moving right (R) is invalid because it's the reverse of the current left (L) direction.\n2. **Food Under Body**: There is positive food under the snake's body at (3, 6), (2, 5), and (5, 3), but the snake cannot eat them immediately because the body must first move away from these positions.\n3. **Tail Position**: The tail is at (5, 3), which is not adjacent to the head, so moving into the tail's position is not an option here.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the current state, the snake has no valid moves that avoid collision. All possible moves (L, U, D) result in the head moving into a cell occupied by the snake's body, which is fatal. \n\n### Final Decision:\nSince the snake must move and all possible moves lead to collision, the game ends here. However, since we must provide an action, we choose the least harmful option (though all are equally fatal in this case).\n\n\\boxed{U} \n\n### Note:\nThis move will result in the snake's head colliding with its body at (3, 5), ending the game. The snake is trapped with no possible safe moves at Turn 91.",

It's turn 91, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Walls are at x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, so the grid is 8x8, but cells from (0,0) to (7,7) exist, but borders are walls, so we can only move in (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me check the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n> \n> Head is at (3,4), and direction is L, which is left, so moving left. Last move was left to get to (3,4) from (4,4)? Positions are head first: (3,4) is head, then (4,4) is the first body segment, and so on, up to tail at (5,3).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (3,6) with life_span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,5) with life_span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,3) with life_span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,1) with life_span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so +1 each if eaten.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,6) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn. So on turn 91, life_span=2, so it will disappear after turn 92? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,6) with life_span 2 on turn 91: on turn 91, countdown is 2, so it will be there for this turn and next turn, and disappear after turn 92? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so:\n> \n> - Turn t: life_span N, present\n> \n> - Turn t+1: if N>1, still present with life_span N-1, else if N=1, disappears after turn t? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it is present. After the turn, life_span decreases by 1. If after decrease, life_span becomes 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: \"disappears after N turns\" means it will vanish after N more turns.\n> \n> For example, if life_span is 2 on turn 91, it means:\n> \n> - On turn 91: present\n> \n> - On turn 92: present (life_span decreases to 1 at end of turn 91 or start of turn 92?

Perhaps there's a mistake in my reading.\n> \n> Another possibility: the food under body might be considered, but the food is separate, but the cell is occupied by snake, so head can't move there.\n> \n> I think I found the issue. In the food positions, (3,6) has food, but snake is at (3,6) as segment 11. Similarly for others. But for movement, the cell is occupied, so head cannot move to (3,6) now because it's occupied.\n> \n> But for the snake to eat that food, it needs to move the body away first.\n> \n> But at this position, head at (3,4), no immediate move is safe.\n> \n> Unless one of the adjacent cells is not occupied.

How did the snake get here? Previous turn, head was at (4,4), direction L, so it moved to (3,4), which was free at that time? At turn 90, head was at (4,4), moved L to (3,4), which was not occupied then? But at turn 90, what was the snake position?\n> \n> At turn 91, positions are given, so at turn 91 start, snake is as above.\n> \n> At turn 90, before move, head was at (4,4), and it moved L to (3,4).

Length 18, so 18 positions.\n> \n> In the list, at turn 91, positions are 18, starting with (3,4) head.\n> \n> So at turn 90, head was at (4,4), and after moving L to (3,4), the new head is (3,4), and the tail moved from, say, (5,3) to somewhere, but since no food eaten, tail moves, so the cell (3,4) was free at turn 90 before move? At turn 90, before move, what was at (3,4)?\n> \n> At turn 90, positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), and tail (5,3)? Positions are ordered, so at turn 90, let's list the segments.\n> \n> The positions given are for turn 91, with head at (3,4).

Length 18, so 18 positions.\n> \n> When head moves from (4,4) to (3,4), the new head is (3,4), then the body becomes (4,4), (4,3), etc., and the tail at (5,3) is removed if no food, so new tail is the second last position.\n> \n> At turn 90, before move, positions: let's say P0 to P17, with P0 = head (4,4), P1 = (4,3), P2 = (3,3), P3 = (2,3), P4 = (2,4), P5 = (1,4), P6 = (1,5), P7 = (2,5), P8 = (3,5), P9 = (3,6), P10 = (4,6), P11 = (5,6), P12 = (6,6), P13 = (6,5), P14 = (5,5), P15 = (5,4), P16 = (5,3), P17 = tail (5,3)?

This path ensures survival by gradually freeing space and aligning with the food's lifespan.\n",
