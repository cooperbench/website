        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t_1 = 0, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe grid has vertical positions y from 0 to 9. The player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y remains). The movement is constrained so that y must be in [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (which is y=k) and at that same turn T, there is a car on freeway k such that the car's span (which is moving) contains the x-coordinate 0 (since the player is at (0, y)).\n\nImportant note: when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at turn T the player is still on y_T. So at turn T, we only check the freeway corresponding to y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on y_{T+1} and we check that freeway.\n\nThe car update:\n- For a left-moving car (d='left'): at turn T, the car span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] (and note that since it's left-moving, the head is at the right and tail at the left? Actually, the initial span at t1 is given as (h, tau). For left-moving, the car is moving left, so the entire span shifts left by s*(T-t1). Similarly, for right-moving, the span shifts right by s*(T-t1).\n\nBut note: the representation for left-moving: initial span [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. However, the problem states:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note that if h and tau are the endpoints, we must consider the interval. However, the problem does not specify which of h or tau is larger. But from the example, for left-moving, the head is at a higher x than the tail? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"head is at h, tail is at tau\", and then the car moves left, so the head and tail both decrease by s*(T-t1). Similarly, for right-moving, they both increase.\n\nHowever, the problem states the span for left-moving as [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. This implies that the order of h and tau might not be sorted? But in the collision condition, we require that 0 is in the span. So we must consider the interval between the two numbers regardless of order? Actually, the problem says \"the car span\", which is a contiguous interval. So for left-moving, the initial span [h, tau] (which might be [min, max] or [max, min]?) is not specified. But note the example:\n\nIn freeway 3: we have (48, 37, right, 6) -> so head=48, tail=37. Since it's right-moving, the head is at 48 and tail at 37? But then the span is [37,48]? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So they are representing the span as [tail, head] for right-moving? But then for left-moving, they write [h, tau] and then both decrease.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we can think: the car has a head and a tail. The head is the front of the car. For a left-moving car, the head is at a larger x-coordinate and moves left (so decreasing x). The tail is at a smaller x. Similarly, for a right-moving car, the head is at a smaller x and moves right (so increasing x), and the tail is at a larger x? Actually, that doesn't match the freeway 3 example: (48,37,right,6). If it's right-moving, and head=48, tail=37, then head=48 is greater than tail=37, so the car spans from 37 to 48? But then when moving right, the entire car moves right, so the span becomes [37+6*dt, 48+6*dt]. However, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" and then [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt]. Here, they set tau=37 and h=48? Then the span is [37,48] and becomes [37+6*dt,48+6*dt]. That makes sense.\n\nBut for left-moving, they write: [h, tau] and then [h-s*dt, tau-s*dt]. In the example for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36). Here, h=48, tau=83. So the initial span is [48,83]? But that would be from 48 to 83, which is 35 units long. Then moving left, it becomes [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt]. However, if the car is moving left, we would expect the head to be at the rightmost part? Actually, if the car is moving left, the front (head) should be the leftmost? Or the rightmost? \n\nThe problem states: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at tau\". It doesn't specify which is left/right. But the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] -> so the entire interval shifts left. So the relative positions of h and tau don't change? Then the interval is [min(h,tau), max(h,tau)]? Or is it [h, tau] meaning from h to tau? The problem does not specify the order. But for the collision check, we care about the continuous interval. So we can define the car's span at time T as:\n\nFor a car (h, tau, d, s):\n  If d is left: then the span at time T is [min(h, tau) - s*(T-t1), max(h, tau) - s*(T-t1)]? \nBut wait, the problem writes: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. This is an interval that might be decreasing if h < tau? But that would be unusual. Alternatively, the problem might have intended that for left-moving, the head is the rightmost and the tail the leftmost? Then the initial span is [tau, h] (with tau < h) and then becomes [tau - s*dt, h - s*dt]. But the problem writes [h, tau] for left-moving. \n\nLooking at freeway 1: (48,83,left,36). If we take the interval [48,83] and shift left, then at time T, the car is at [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt]. This is a long car (35 units) and moving left at 36 per turn. Similarly, freeway 2 is the same.\n\nFor freeway 3: (48,37,right,6): if we take [37,48] (if we interpret as [tau, head] for right-moving? but the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] and then becomes [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt]. So if tau=37 and h=48, then the span is [37,48] and moves right.\n\nBut then in the same freeway 3, we have two more cars: (12,1,right,6) -> [1,12] and (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35,-24]. \n\nSo the representation: \n  For left-moving: the initial span is [h, tau] and then shifts left. The values h and tau are given without any ordering? But in the example, for left-moving, h=48 and tau=83, which is increasing? So the car goes from 48 to 83? That would be 35 units long. Then shifting left: at time T, [48-36*T, 83-36*T] (since t1=0).\n\nFor right-moving: the initial span is [tau, h] and then shifts right. In the example, (48,37,right,6) -> [37,48] and then [37+6*T,48+6*T].\n\nNow, collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\nWe are at turn 0, and we are at y0=0. We are not on any freeway 1-8 at turn 0, so no collision at turn 0. We start by taking an action at turn 0 to move to y1.\n\nOur goal: we must end at (0,9) at the last turn (turn H-1, since we count turns from t1=0 to t1+H-1). So at the last turn, we must be at y=9.\n\nWe need to avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8. We start at y=0 and we are safe at y=0 and y=9 (since there are no cars on y=0 and y=9). But note: the problem says cars are on freeways y=1,...,8.\n\nThe plan: we need to move from y=0 to y=9. The minimal number of turns in terms of vertical moves is 9 moves up (if we do only U). But we have to avoid the cars on the intermediate rows at the times we are there.\n\nWe must consider the times when we arrive at each freeway. Since we start at turn 0 at y0=0, then at turn 1 we are at y1 (which can be 0,1, or if we go up, then 1). Then at turn 2, we can be at y2, etc.\n\nWe are allowed to move down or stay, so we might need to wait sometimes? But we want minimal H.\n\nWe'll model the state (turn, y) and check if at that turn, if y is between 1 and 8, then we must check all cars on that freeway to see if any car has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS (breadth-first search) over the states (turn, y) to find the minimal turns to reach y=9.\n\nNote: the grid is small (y from 0 to 9) but the number of turns might be large because the cars move fast? But note the cars are moving in the x-direction and we are fixed at x=0. The cars that are far away might not matter. However, the speeds are high (like 36 and 6). The car on freeway 1: at time T, the span is [48-36*T, 83-36*T]. We need 0 to be not in that interval. Similarly for others.\n\nWe can compute for each freeway and each car, the times T at which 0 is in the car's span. Then we know that we cannot be on that freeway at that time.\n\nBut note: we might be able to avoid by timing: we can wait at a safe row until the car passes.\n\nHowever, we are starting at turn 0 and we want the minimal H.\n\nWe'll compute the safe times for each freeway.\n\nBut note: a freeway has multiple cars. So we need to avoid any car on that freeway at the time we are there.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the time intervals (if any) during which the car covers 0. Then the unsafe times for freeway k are the union of these intervals.\n\nThen, we can traverse the grid (y from 0 to 9) over increasing turns, and for each state (t, y) we check if at time t, being on row y is safe.\n\nSafe conditions:\n- If y=0 or y=9: always safe (since no cars).\n- If y in {1,...,8}: then we must check that at time t, no car on freeway y has 0 in its span.\n\nWe start at (0,0) and we want to reach (t,9) for some t, and we minimize t.\n\nActions: U, D, S. But note: we can only move to adjacent y (or stay) and y must be in [0,9].\n\nWe'll do BFS in terms of turns. We start at (0,0). Then at each step, we consider the next action (U, D, S) and the next state (t+1, y') where y' = y + dy (with dy: +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S), and if y' is in [0,9] and the state (t+1, y') is safe (i.e., if y' is 0 or 9, safe; if y' in 1..8, then we must check that at time t+1, freeway y' is safe).\n\nBut note: at time t, we are at (0, y_t). Then we choose an action a_t that will determine y_{t+1}. Then at time t+1, we are at (0, y_{t+1}). So the safety check at time t+1 is for the freeway y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn 0: (0,0) is safe. Then at turn 1, we can be at y=0 (if we do S or D? but D from 0: y1 = 0-1 -> but y must be in [0,9], so we cannot go below 0. So at y=0, we cannot go D. So from (0,0), actions: \n  U: y1=1\n  D: invalid (y1=-1 not allowed) -> so not allowed.\n  S: y1=0\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, we cannot go U.\n\nWe are going to simulate turns until we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll use a queue for BFS: (turn, y, path) where path is the sequence of actions so far. But note we only need the minimal turn, so we can do:\n\nLet dist[t][y] = minimal turns to reach (t,y) but we don't know the turn count. Alternatively, we can do state (y) and use a queue that is ordered by turn.\n\nBut note: the state is (t,y). We start at (0,0). Then we try next states (1,0) and (1,1). Then from (1,0) we can go to (2,0) and (2,1); from (1,1) we can go to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) [if we do D, S, U]. But wait: from (1,1): \n  U: y2=2\n  D: y2=0\n  S: y2=1\n\nBut we must check safety at the next state at the next turn.\n\nWe'll do:\n\nInitialize: \n  queue: [(0,0, [])]   # (turn, y, actions_so_far)\n  visited: set of (t,y) that we have already visited? But note: we might want to visit the same y at a later turn if we had a different path? But we are looking for minimal turns. So we want to reach y=9 as early as possible. Therefore, we can use Dijkstra (where the cost is the turn) but since each action costs one turn, we can do BFS by increasing turn.\n\nWe mark visited for (y) at a given turn? Actually, we might have multiple ways to reach (y) at the same turn? Then we don't need to revisit. Also, if we reached (y) at an earlier turn, we don't need to consider a later turn. So we can keep an array min_turn[y] = minimal turn at which we reached y. Then we can skip a state (t,y) if we have already reached y at a turn <= t.\n\nBut note: sometimes we might need to wait (by staying) and then go, so we might have a state (t,y) that we reached at a higher turn but then we can wait? Actually, if we are at (t,y) and we can stay, then we can be at (t+1,y). But if we have already visited (t,y) and then we stay, we get (t+1,y). However, if we have already reached (t,y) and we know that we can then stay arbitrarily, then we don't need to consider (t+1,y) if we already have (t,y) because we can just stay. But actually, the safety condition might change: at time t+1, the freeway y might be unsafe even if at time t it was safe? So we must consider the state (t,y) and then staying leads to (t+1,y) and we must check safety at t+1.\n\nTherefore, we cannot prune by y only. We must consider each (t,y) as a distinct state.\n\nBut note: the grid of (t,y) is infinite? Because we can stay arbitrarily long. However, the cars move with time, so eventually the cars that are moving fast (like 36 per turn) will pass 0 quickly. We can compute the unsafe intervals for each freeway and then the safe times are periodic? Actually, the cars are moving continuously? But note: the cars are defined by linear motion. However, the unsafe intervals for a car are contiguous and finite? Because the car moves and eventually leaves 0.\n\nBut we have multiple cars on a freeway. The unsafe times for a freeway are the union of the unsafe intervals of its cars.\n\nLet's precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) the set of time intervals during which the freeway is unsafe.\n\nFor each car on freeway k:\n\nFor a left-moving car: (h, tau, 'left', s)\n  The span at time T: [h - s*T, tau - s*T]   (since t1=0, T>=0)\n  We need 0 in this interval: \n      min(h - s*T, tau - s*T) <= 0 <= max(h - s*T, tau - s*T)\n\nBut note: the interval is [h-s*T, tau-s*T] regardless of order? Actually, the interval is from the smallest to the largest? But the problem does not specify. However, the collision condition is 0 in the set [h-s*T, tau-s*T] meaning mathematically: \n  0 is between h-s*T and tau-s*T (inclusive) regardless of which is bigger? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"0 in Span(T)\". And the span is a contiguous set. So we can define the interval as:\n   low = min(h-s*T, tau-s*T)\n   high = max(h-s*T, tau-s*T)\n\nThen we require low <= 0 <= high.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \n   low = min(tau+s*T, h+s*T)\n   high = max(tau+s*T, h+s*T)\n\nBut wait: for right-moving, the update is [tau+s*T, h+s*T]. Then the interval is from min(tau+s*T, h+s*T) to max(tau+s*T, h+s*T). \n\nBut note: the representation for right-moving: the problem says \"Span(T) = [tau+s*T, h+s*T]\". This is written as [tau+s*T, h+s*T]. If tau <= h, then the interval is [tau+s*T, h+s*T]. If tau > h, then it is [h+s*T, tau+s*T]? Actually, the problem does not specify, but in the example they use: for freeway 3, (48,37,right,6): then [37,48] becomes [37+6*T,48+6*T]. So they assume that for right-moving, tau <= h? Similarly, for left-moving: (48,83,left,36): [48,83] becomes [48-36*T,83-36*T] -> so they assume for left-moving, h <= tau? \n\nLooking at the numbers: for left-moving, h=48, tau=83 -> h<tau. For right-moving, (48,37,right,6): h=48, tau=37 -> h>tau.\n\nSo we can assume that in the input:\n  For left-moving: h <= tau? Because if h>tau, then the interval [h-s*T, tau-s*T] would be a negative length? But the problem states the span as [h, tau] for left-moving. So we must take the interval as the closed interval between h-s*T and tau-s*T. Similarly for right-moving: the interval is the closed interval between tau+s*T and h+s*T.\n\nTherefore, to compute the unsafe interval for a car:\n\nCase 1: left-moving\n  Let a = h - s*T, b = tau - s*T.\n  The interval is [min(a,b), max(a,b)].\n  We want 0 in [min(a,b), max(a,b)]  <=> min(a,b) <= 0 <= max(a,b)\n\nCase 2: right-moving\n  Let a = tau + s*T, b = h + s*T.\n  The interval is [min(a,b), max(a,b)] and we want 0 in that interval.\n\nBut note: we can solve for T:\n\nFor left-moving:\n  Without loss of generality, assume the car moves such that the entire interval shifts left. The condition is:\n      h - s*T <= 0 <= tau - s*T   OR   tau - s*T <= 0 <= h - s*T?\n  Actually, we don't know which of a and b is smaller. But we can write:\n\n  The condition is: \n      (h - s*T <= 0 and 0 <= tau - s*T) OR (tau - s*T <= 0 and 0 <= h - s*T)\n\nBut note: if h <= tau, then h-s*T <= tau-s*T for all T? Because h<=tau. So the interval is [h-s*T, tau-s*T]. Then the condition is:\n      h - s*T <= 0 <= tau - s*T\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, if tau <= h, then the interval is [tau+s*T, h+s*T] and the condition is:\n      tau+s*T <= 0 <= h+s*T   -> but this is impossible because s*T>=0, so tau+s*T >= tau (which for the example is 37) and then 0 cannot be in [37,48] at T=0. Actually, we see that at T=0, the car at freeway 3: (48,37,right,6) is at [37,48], which does not contain 0. So we must have T such that tau+s*T <= 0 <= h+s*T.\n\nBut wait: in the example for freeway 3, we have a car (-24,-35,right,6): then the interval at T is [-35+6*T, -24+6*T]. We need 0 in that interval: \n      -35+6*T <= 0 <= -24+6*T\n      => 35/6 <= T <= 24/6 -> but 35/6 ~ 5.8 and 24/6=4 -> no solution? Actually, let me solve:\n      -35+6T <= 0  => 6T <= 35 => T <= 35/6 ≈ 5.83\n      0 <= -24+6T => 6T>=24 => T>=4.\n      So T in [4, 5.83]. Since T is integer, T=5? Then at T=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]? Yes.\n\nBut note: the problem says the car is (-24,-35,right,6). How do we interpret? The problem states: for right-moving, the span at T is [tau+s*T, h+s*T] = [-35+6*T, -24+6*T]. So at T=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]. So T=5 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, for the same freeway, we have another car: (12,1,right,6): [1+6*T, 12+6*T]. Then 0 in [1+6*T,12+6*T]? \n      We need 1+6T <= 0 <= 12+6T -> but 1+6T>=1>0 for T>=0 -> no solution.\n\nAnd (48,37,right,6): [37+6T,48+6T] -> 37+6T>0 for T>=0 -> no solution.\n\nSo for freeway 3, the only unsafe times are when the car (-24,-35,right,6) is covering 0, which is at T in [4, 35/6) -> T=4,5? Actually, at T=5: [-5,6] -> 0 is included. At T=4: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? \n      Condition: -11<=0<=0 -> yes. So T=4 and T=5.\n\nBut note: at T=5: the interval is [-5,6] -> 0 is included. At T=6: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo unsafe at T=4 and T=5.\n\nSimilarly, we must compute for every car on every freeway.\n\nLet's do it for all freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n   Condition: 48 - 36*T <= 0 <= 83 - 36*T\n      => 48 - 36T <= 0  => 36T>=48 => T>=48/36=4/3≈1.33\n      and 0<=83-36T => 36T<=83 => T<=83/36≈2.305\n      So T in [1.33, 2.305] -> T=2? (since T integer, and T=1: 48-36=12>0 -> not covered? T=2: 48-72=-24<=0, 83-72=11>=0 -> yes. So T=2.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: unsafe at T=2.\n\nFreeway 3: as above: unsafe at T=4 and T=5.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \n  | 4 | (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) |\n  So same as freeway 3: unsafe at T=4,5.\n\nFreeway 5: one car: (48,37,right,6)\n   Condition: [37+6T,48+6T] -> we need 37+6T<=0<=48+6T? \n      37+6T<=0 -> T<=-37/6 -> impossible. So never unsafe.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: (48,37,right,6) -> never unsafe.\n\nFreeway 7: same -> never unsafe.\n\nFreeway 8: same -> never unsafe.\n\nBut wait: freeway 5,6,7,8: each has one car: (48,37,right,6). So we already computed: safe.\n\nSo summary of unsafe times for freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: T=2\nFreeway 2: T=2\nFreeway 3: T=4,5\nFreeway 4: T=4,5\nFreeway 5: safe at all times\nFreeway 6: safe at all times\nFreeway 7: safe at all times\nFreeway 8: safe at all times\n\nNow, we plan the moves:\n\nWe start at (0,0). We can:\n  S: stay at (1,0) -> safe, but we haven't moved up.\n  U: move to (1,1) -> at turn 1, freeway 1: is it unsafe? We computed freeway 1 unsafe at T=2. So at T=1, freeway 1 is safe? \n        For freeway1: the car: at T=1: [48-36,83-36] = [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\n\nSo from (0,0) we can go to (1,1).\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible. The minimal moves: 9 moves up. So if we go up every time, we would be:\n  Turn 0: y0=0\n  Turn 1: y1=1 (action U)\n  Turn 2: y2=2 (action U) -> at turn 2, we are at freeway 2 -> unsafe? freeway2 is unsafe at T=2 -> collision! So we cannot be at freeway2 at turn2.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway2 at turn2.\n\nWe can consider:\n  Option 1: at turn1, we go to y1=1. Then at turn2, we cannot go to y2=2 because that would be unsafe. So we can:\n      - Stay at y=1: then at turn2, we are at freeway1? But freeway1 is unsafe at turn2? \n          freeway1: at T=2: [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11] -> 0 in [-24,11] -> unsafe! So we cannot stay at y=1 at turn2.\n      - Move down to y=0: then at turn2, we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn3, we can go up again to y=1? but then at turn3, freeway1: T=3: [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in there -> safe. Then at turn4, we can go to y=2? but freeway2 at turn4: T=4: [48-144,83-144] = [-96,-61] -> safe. Then we can continue up.\n\nBut we also have freeway3 and 4 at T=4 and T=5 being unsafe.\n\nLet me write the path:\n\nTurn0: start at (0,0) -> safe.\nTurn1: U -> (1,1) -> safe (as above).\nTurn2: D -> (2,0) -> safe (y=0).\nTurn3: U -> (3,1) -> freeway1 at T=3: safe (as above).\nTurn4: U -> (4,2) -> freeway2 at T=4: safe (as above).\nTurn5: U -> (5,3) -> freeway3 at T=5: unsafe! because freeway3 is unsafe at T=5.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=3 at turn5.\n\nAt turn4: we are at (4,2). What else can we do?\n  We can stay at y=2: then at turn5, we are at freeway2: T=5: safe? freeway2 at T=5: [48-36*5,83-36*5] = [48-180,83-180] = [-132,-97] -> safe.\n  Then at turn5: we are at (5,2). Then at turn6: we can go to y=3? freeway3 at T=6: we computed freeway3 unsafe only at T=4,5? so T=6: safe? \n        freeway3: cars? \n          (48,37,right,6): at T=6: [37+36,48+36] = [73,84] -> safe.\n          (12,1,right,6): [1+36,12+36]=[37,48] -> safe.\n          (-24,-35,right,6): [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12] -> safe.\n        So safe.\n\nThen we can proceed:\n\nTurn6: U -> (6,3) -> safe.\nTurn7: U -> (7,4) -> freeway4 at T=7: safe? \n        freeway4: same as freeway3: unsafe only at T=4,5? T=7: safe.\nTurn8: U -> (8,5) -> freeway5: safe at all times.\nTurn9: U -> (9,6) -> safe.\nTurn10: U -> (10,7) -> safe.\nTurn11: U -> (11,8) -> safe.\nTurn12: U -> (12,9) -> done.\n\nTotal turns: 12.\n\nBut is this minimal? We started at turn0, and we reached at turn12. The sequence of actions:\n\nTurn0: U (to y1=1)\nTurn1: D (to y2=0)\nTurn2: U (to y3=1)\nTurn3: U (to y4=2)\nTurn4: S (at y4=2, then at turn5: y5=2)  [or we did: at turn4: we are at (4,2), then we do S at turn4 to stay at turn5 at y=2? \nBut in the path above: \n  turn4: we were at (4,2) and then we did S at turn4 to remain at (5,2). Then turn5: we do U to (6,3). \n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn0: U\nTurn1: D\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: S   (because we cannot go up at turn4 to turn5: because if we go U at turn4 we get to y=3 at turn5, which is unsafe. So we must stay at turn4 to avoid turn5 at y=3? But wait, at turn4 we are at y=2. Then we choose an action at turn4 to determine y5.\n\nWe have:\n\nState at turn4: (4,2) -> safe.\nThen at turn4, we choose:\n  U: then at turn5: y5=3 -> unsafe (freeway3 at T=5: unsafe) -> not allowed.\n  D: then at turn5: y5=1 -> freeway1 at T=5: safe? [48-36*5,83-36*5] = [-132,-97] -> safe.\n  S: then at turn5: y5=2 -> freeway2 at T=5: safe (as above).\n\nSo we have two options at turn4: we can go down to 1 or stay at 2. But we want to minimize the total turns. Going down to 1 might lead to a longer path? So we choose to stay at 2.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn0: U  -> (1,1)\nTurn1: D  -> (2,0)   [but wait: turn1: we are at (1,1), then we do D -> y2=0. Then at turn2: we are at (2,0). Then:\nTurn2: U -> (3,1)   [at turn3: (3,1) -> freeway1: T=3: safe? yes]\nTurn3: U -> (4,2)   [at turn4: (4,2) -> freeway2: T=4: safe? yes, because freeway2 unsafe only at T=2 -> safe]\nThen at turn4: we choose S -> (5,2) [safe]\nThen turn5: U -> (6,3) [safe]\nThen turn6: U -> (7,4) [safe]\nThen turn7: U -> (8,5) [safe]\nThen turn8: U -> (9,6) [safe]\nThen turn9: U -> (10,7) [safe]\nThen turn10: U -> (11,8) [safe]\nThen turn11: U -> (12,9) [done]\n\nTotal turns: 12. But we started at turn0 and we did 12 actions? Then the last action is at turn11, and we are at (12,9). So H=12? \n\nBut note: the problem says: we start at turn t1=0, and we do actions for t=0 to t=H-1. Then the state after H actions is at turn t1+H. But the problem says: we are at (0, y_{t1}) at turn t1. Then we do an action a_{t1} to get to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, and so on until we are at y_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1 and we require that to be 9.\n\nSo we start at turn0: y0=0.\nWe do H actions: a0, a1, ..., a_{H-1}.\nThen the last state is at turn H: y_H = 9.\n\nIn our plan, we have:\n\nturn0: start at y0=0.\nAfter 1st action (a0): at turn1: y1=1.\nAfter 2nd action (a1): at turn2: y2=0.\nAfter 3rd action (a2): at turn3: y3=1.\nAfter 4th action (a3): at turn4: y4=2.\nAfter 5th action (a4): at turn5: y5=2.   [we did S at turn4: so a4=S]\nAfter 6th action (a5): at turn6: y6=3.\nAfter 7th action (a6): at turn7: y7=4.\nAfter 8th action (a7): at turn8: y8=5.\nAfter 9th action (a8): at turn9: y9=6.\nAfter 10th action (a9): at turn10: y10=7.\nAfter 11th action (a10): at turn11: y11=8.\nAfter 12th action (a11): at turn12: y12=9.\n\nSo H=12 actions. The sequence of actions: \n  a0=U, a1=D, a2=U, a3=U, a4=S, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U.\n\nBut can we do better? \n\nAlternative: at turn0: U (to y1=1)\nturn1: instead of D, we do S? \n  Then at turn1: we are at (1,1). Then at turn2: we must not be at y=1 (because freeway1 unsafe at T=2) and we cannot go to y=2 (freeway2 unsafe at T=2). So we must go down to y=0. \n  Then same as above: at turn2: D -> (2,0). Then same as above.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait at y=0 for one turn? \n  turn0: S -> (1,0) [safe]\n  turn1: U -> (2,1) -> at turn2: freeway1: T=2 -> unsafe! so not allowed.\n\nSo we must leave y=1 by turn1? \n\nBut we did: at turn1: we are at y1=1 (by U at turn0). Then at turn2: we go down to y2=0. \n\nAlternatively, we might try to go up faster? But at turn2 we cannot be at y=2.\n\nWhat if we go up to y=3 earlier? \n\nBut freeway3 is unsafe at T=4 and 5. So we must avoid being at freeway3 at turns 4 and 5.\n\nWe can be at freeway3 at turn3? \n  freeway3 at T=3: \n      car1: (48,37,right,6): [37+18,48+18]=[55,66] -> safe.\n      car2: (12,1,right,6): [1+18,12+18]=[19,30] -> safe.\n      car3: (-24,-35,right,6): [-35+18, -24+18]=[-17,-6] -> safe.\n  So safe.\n\nThen we could be at y=3 at turn3? \n\nHow? \n  turn0: U -> (1,1)\n  turn1: U -> (2,2) -> but at turn2: freeway2: unsafe! so we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we go to y=3 at turn6? But we already have a path that goes through at turn6.\n\nBut if we can get to y=3 at turn3, then we can avoid the later delay? \n\nBut we cannot get to y=3 at turn3 because we have to go through y=2 at turn2, which is unsafe.\n\nWe can try to go to y=4 at turn4? \n  But to be at y=4 at turn4, we must have been at y=3 at turn3 and then U. But we cannot be at y=3 at turn3 without being at y=2 at turn2.\n\nAlternatively, we can go to y=0 and then skip the unsafe times? \n\nWe note that freeway1 and 2 are unsafe only at T=2, and freeway3 and 4 are unsafe at T=4,5.\n\nSo the minimal time to pass freeway1 and 2: we must not be at freeway1 at T=2 and freeway2 at T=2. We can be at freeway1 at T=1 and then freeway2 at T=3? \n\nFor freeway1: safe at T=0,1,3,4,... (only unsafe at T=2)\nfreeway2: unsafe at T=2, safe at T=0,1,3,4,...\n\nSo we can:\n  turn0: U -> (1,1) [freeway1: T=1: safe]\n  turn1: S -> (2,1) [but T=2: freeway1: unsafe] -> not allowed.\n\n  turn0: U -> (1,1)\n  turn1: U -> (2,2) [freeway2: T=2: unsafe] -> not allowed.\n\n  turn0: U -> (1,1)\n  turn1: D -> (2,0) [safe]\n  turn2: U -> (3,1) [freeway1: T=3: safe]\n  turn3: U -> (4,2) [freeway2: T=4: safe]\n  Now we are at (4,2). Then we want to go to freeway3 at a safe time: safe at T=3,6,7,... (unsafe at 4,5). But T=4: we are at freeway2, not freeway3. At T=5: we can be at freeway3? \n        But if we go U at turn4: then at turn5: y5=3 -> freeway3: T=5: unsafe.\n        So we must wait at freeway2 until T=5 has passed? Then at turn4: we can do S -> (5,2) [freeway2: T=5: safe? freeway2: T=5: [48-180,83-180]=[-132,-97] -> safe]\n        Then at turn5: U -> (6,3) [freeway3: T=6: safe] -> then we can go up.\n\nSo that's the same as before.\n\nBut what if we go from y=2 to y=3 at turn4? Then we are at freeway3 at T=4: unsafe. So we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we could go from y=2 to y=4 in one move? No, we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo the minimal time might be 12.\n\nBut let me see if we can avoid the stay at turn4.\n\nWe could at turn4: go down to y=1? \n  Then at turn5: we are at freeway1: T=5: safe? yes. Then at turn5: we can go to y=2? freeway2: T=5: safe? yes. Then at turn6: to y=3: freeway3: T=6: safe. Then we are at y=3 at turn6, same as before.\n\nBut then the path would be:\n  turn0: U -> (1,1)\n  turn1: D -> (2,0)\n  turn2: U -> (3,1)\n  turn3: U -> (4,2)\n  turn4: D -> (5,1)  [freeway1: T=5: safe]\n  turn5: U -> (6,2)  [freeway2: T=6: safe? freeway2: T=6: [48-216,83-216] = [-168,-133] -> safe]\n  turn6: U -> (7,3)  [freeway3: T=7: safe? as above -> safe]\n  turn7: U -> (8,4)  [freeway4: T=8: safe? freeway4: unsafe only at T=4,5 -> safe]\n  turn8: U -> (9,5)\n  turn9: U -> (10,6)\n  turn10: U -> (11,7)\n  turn11: U -> (12,8)\n  turn12: U -> (13,9)\n\nNow we have 13 moves. Worse.\n\nSo the first plan (with the stay at turn4) is better.\n\nBut can we skip the stay? \n\nWe note that freeway3 is unsafe at T=4 and T=5. We can be at freeway3 at T=3 or T=6. \n\nTo be at freeway3 at T=3: we must be at y=3 at turn3. \n  How? \n      turn0: U (to 1)\n      turn1: ? we cannot go to 2 at turn1 because then at turn2: freeway2: unsafe. \n      So we must be at turn1: at y=0 or 1? \n          If we go to y=0 at turn1, then at turn2: we go to y=1? then at turn3: we can go to y=2? but not to y=3 in one move. \n      Alternatively, we start by staying at 0 at turn0: \n          turn0: S -> (1,0)\n          turn1: U -> (2,1) [freeway1: T=2: unsafe] -> not allowed.\n\n      Or turn0: U -> (1,1)\n          turn1: D -> (2,0)\n          turn2: U -> (3,1)\n          turn3: U -> (4,2)  [we are at y=2 at turn4, not y=3]\n\n      We cannot reach y=3 at turn3.\n\nTo be at freeway3 at T=6: we can be at y=3 at turn6. \n\nIn our first plan, we are at y=3 at turn6. Then we go up without delay until y=9 at turn12.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=3 earlier than turn6? \n\nAt turn3: we are at y=1 -> we can only get to y=3 at turn5 at the earliest (if we go U at turn3: to y=2 at turn4, then U at turn4: to y=3 at turn5). But at turn5, freeway3 is unsafe. So we must avoid that. Then the earliest we can be at y=3 is turn6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let me check if we can be at y=9 in 11 moves? \n\nThe minimal moves without cars: 9 moves. But we have to add 3 moves: one D and two S? In our path we have one D and one S. So 9+1+1=11? But we did 12 moves: 12 actions.\n\nActually, the moves: \n  0->1: U\n  1->0: D\n  0->1: U\n  1->2: U\n  2->2: S\n  2->3: U\n  3->4: U\n  4->5: U\n  5->6: U\n  6->7: U\n  7->8: U\n  8->9: U\n\nThat's 12 moves.\n\nBut note: the D and the S are detours. We cannot avoid the D at the beginning because we must leave freeway1 at turn2. And we cannot avoid the S at turn4 because we must avoid freeway3 at turn5. \n\nSo we have to add two extra moves? \n\nBut the D is one extra move (down then up again: two moves for no net progress) and the S is one extra move (no progress). So total extra moves: 2, making total 11? But 9 + 2 = 11, but we have 12 moves. Why? \n\nActually, the net progress: we start at 0, we end at 9: net 9 up moves. But we have one down move and one stay. The stay doesn't change the net, but the down move requires an extra up move to compensate. So we need at least 9 (for the net) + 1 (for the down) + 1 (for the stay) = 11? But we did 12 moves. \n\nWait: the moves:\n  U (0->1): +1\n  D (1->0): -1\n  U (0->1): +1\n  U (1->2): +1\n  S (2->2): 0\n  U (2->3): +1\n  U (3->4): +1\n  ... until 9.\n\nThe net: 1 -1 +1 +1 +0 +1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 1 (from the first U) -1 (from the D) then 7 U's and one S? \n  Count the U: 9 U's? \n      moves: \n        move0: U -> +1\n        move1: D -> -1\n        move2: U -> +1\n        move3: U -> +1\n        move4: S -> 0\n        move5: U -> +1\n        move6: U -> +1\n        move7: U -> +1\n        move8: U -> +1\n        move9: U -> +1\n        move10: U -> +1\n        move11: U -> +1\n\n  Total U: 10? D:1, S:1.\n  Net: 10 - 1 = 9.\n\nBut we have 12 moves: 12 actions.\n\nBut we only need 9 net up moves. The extra moves are 3: one D and two non-productive moves? But we have one S and one D: that's two non-productive? Actually, the D is a down and then we have to do an extra U to compensate. So the D and the extra U: two moves for no net. The S: one move for no net. Total non-productive: 3 moves. So total moves: 9 (productive) + 3 (non-productive) = 12.\n\nBut we must do at least 12 moves.\n\nIs there a path with 11 moves? \n\nWe need net 9 up moves. The total displacement must be 9. \n\nSuppose we do k U, m D, and n S, then:\n   k - m = 9\n   k + m + n = H\n   =>  k = 9 + m\n   => H = (9+m) + m + n = 9 + 2m + n.\n\nMinimal H: when m=0, n=0: H=9. But we cannot. Then next: m=0, n=1: H=10; or m=1, n=0: H=11.\n\nSo we are looking for a path with m=1, n=0: H=11.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times: T=2 (freeways1,2) and T=4,5 (freeways3,4).\n\nWe must be at freeway1 at some T not=2, freeway2 at T not=2, freeway3 at T not in {4,5}, freeway4 at T not in {4,5}.\n\nWe start at T0=0 at y0=0.\n\nWe do 11 moves: so we end at T=11 at y11=9.\n\nWe must assign the times for passing freeway1,2,3,4.\n\nWe must pass freeway1 at some T1, freeway2 at T2, etc.\n\nThe times: we go from y=0 to y=1 at some T, then to y=2 at T+1, etc.\n\nBut we can skip freeways by moving faster? No, we must go through each freeway? Not necessarily: we can go from y=0 to y=1, then to y=2, then to y=3, etc. But we can also go down and skip a freeway? No, we have to eventually go to y=9, so we must pass every y from 0 to 9.\n\nSo we will be at freeway1 (y=1) at some T1, freeway2 (y=2) at T2, freeway3 (y=3) at T3, freeway4 (y=4) at T4.\n\nConstraints:\n  T1 >=1, T2 = T1 + d1, T3 = T2 + d2, T4 = T3 + d3, and then we have to go to y=9: so T9 = T4 + ... \n\nBut the moves: we can move arbitrarily: we can stay or move down. \n\nThe minimal time to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 moves (if no obstacles). But with obstacles, we must avoid the unsafe times.\n\nWe require:\n  T1 not=2\n  T2 not=2\n  T3 not in {4,5}\n  T4 not in {4,5}\n\nAlso, the T's must be increasing and T_i >= i (if we only go up, then T_i = i). \n\nBut we can go down and stay, so T_i can be larger.\n\nWe want H=11, so we end at T=11.\n\nWe need to assign T1, T2, T3, T4 in the range [1,10] (since we are at y=4 at T4, then we need at least 5 more moves to get to 9, so T4 <= 6? because T4+5 = 11? \n\nActually, from y=4 to y=9: 5 moves (if we go up every time). So if we are at y=4 at T4, then we can be at y=9 at T4+5. We require T4+5=11 -> T4=6.\n\nSimilarly, we must be at y=1 at T1, then y=2 at T2, y=3 at T3, y=4 at T4=6.\n\nConstraints:\n  T1 not=2\n  T2 not=2\n  T3 not in {4,5}\n  T4=6.\n\nThe sequence of y: \n  0 -> ... -> 1 at T1 -> ... -> 2 at T2 -> ... -> 3 at T3 -> ... -> 4 at T4=6.\n\nThe minimal time to go from 0 to 4 is 4 moves. But we have 6 turns to get to y=4. So we have 2 extra moves. We can use them to delay.\n\nWe need to avoid T1=2 and T2=2 and T3 not in {4,5}. \n\nBut T4=6, so T3 must be <=5. But T3 cannot be 4 or 5. So T3 must be <=3? \n\nBut from T3 we go to T4=6: we have at least 3 moves? But we are going from y=3 to y=4: only one move. So we must spend 2 extra moves in the segment from y=3 to y=4? \n\nWe can stay at y=3 for two turns? But then T3 would be the time we first reach y=3? Then we stay at y=3 for two turns: then we leave at T3+2 to y=4? But then we are at y=4 at T3+1? \n\nActually, if we are at y=3 at T3, then we can:\n  T3: at y=3\n  T3+1: we can stay at y=3\n  T3+2: we can stay at y=3\n  T3+3: go to y=4.\n\nBut then we require T3+3=6 -> T3=3.\n\nSo T3=3. Then we are at y=3 at T3=3. Then we stay at y=3 for 3 turns? until T=6? Then at T=6: we go to y=4.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at T=3,4,5,6? Then at T=4 and T=5: we are at freeway3 -> unsafe! because freeway3 is unsafe at T=4,5.\n\nSo we cannot stay at y=3 during T=4,5.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=3 only at T=3 and then leave? But we need to wait until T=6 to go to y=4? \n\nIf we go to y=4 at T=4: then freeway4 at T=4: unsafe. Similarly, T=5: unsafe. So we must go at T=6. So we must avoid being at y=3 at T=4 and T=5? \n\nBut if we are at y=3 at T=3, then we can go down to y=2 at T=4? Then at T=4: freeway2: safe? freeway2 at T=4: [48-144,83-144] = [-96,-61] -> safe. Then at T=5: we can go back to y=3? but freeway3 at T=5: unsafe. Or we can go to y=4? unsafe. Or stay at y=2: safe.\n\nThen at T=5: we are at y=2. Then at T=6: we go to y=3? but we need to be at y=4 at T=6? no, we are at y=3 at T=6. Then we go to y=4 at T=7? then T4=7, but we needed T4=6.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=4 at T=6 by being at y=3 at T=5? but unsafe.\n\nSo it seems impossible to have T4=6 and avoid the unsafe times.\n\nTherefore, there is no path of 11 moves.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 12.\n\nSo we output the sequence of 12 actions.\n\nBut we have a path: \n  actions: \n    t0: U\n    t1: D\n    t2: U\n    t3: U\n    t4: S\n    t5: U\n    t6: U\n    t7: U\n    t8: U\n    t9: U\n    t10: U\n    t11: U\n\nBut let me write the positions to verify safety:\n\nTurn0: y0=0 -> safe.\n  a0=U -> \nTurn1: y1=1 -> freeway1: T=1: [48-36,83-36]=[12,47] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  a1=D -> \nTurn2: y2=0 -> safe.\n  a2=U -> \nTurn3: y3=1 -> freeway1: T=3: [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\n  a3=U -> \nTurn4: y4=2 -> freeway2: T=4: [48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\n  a4=S -> \nTurn5: y5=2 -> freeway2: T=5: [48-180,83-180]=[-132,-97] -> safe.\n  a5=U -> \nTurn6: y6=3 -> freeway3: T=6: \n      car1: [37+36,48+36]=[73,84] -> safe.\n      car2: [1+36,12+36]=[37,48] -> safe.\n      car3: [-35+36,-24+36]=[1,12] -> safe.\n  a6=U -> \nTurn7: y7=4 -> freeway4: T=7: same as freeway3 at T=7: \n      car1: [37+42,48+42]=[79,90] -> safe.\n      car2: [1+42,12+42]=[43,54] -> safe.\n      car3: [-35+42,-24+42]=[7,18] -> safe.\n  a7=U -> \nTurn8: y8=5 -> freeway5: safe always.\n  a8=U -> \nTurn9: y9=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n  a9=U -> \nTurn10: y10=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n  a10=U -> \nTurn11: y11=8 -> freeway8: safe.\n  a11=U -> \nTurn12: y12=9 -> done.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"current turn is t_1\", and we are to output actions for t_1 to t_1+H-1. Here t_1=0, so we output from turn0 to turn11.\n\nIn the format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here H=12, so t from 0 to 11.\n\nWe are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) is 12. The sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n\n- At turn 0, starting at \\((0, 0)\\), move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 at \\(T = 1\\): car span [12, 47], 0 not in span).\n- At turn 1, move down to \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no cars).\n- At turn 2, move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 at \\(T = 3\\): car span [-60, -25], 0 not in span).\n- At turn 3, move up to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 at \\(T = 4\\): car span [-96, -61], 0 not in span).\n- At turn 4, stay at \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 at \\(T = 5\\): car span [-132, -97], 0 not in span).\n- At turn 5, move up to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 at \\(T = 6\\): cars [73, 84], [37, 48], [1, 12], 0 not in any span).\n- At turn 6, move up to \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as freeway 4 at \\(T = 7\\): cars [79, 90], [43, 54], [7, 18], 0 not in any span).\n- At turn 7, move up to \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as freeway 5 has no unsafe times).\n- At turn 8, move up to \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as freeway 6 has no unsafe times).\n- At turn 9, move up to \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as freeway 7 has no unsafe times).\n- At turn 10, move up to \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as freeway 8 has no unsafe times).\n- At turn 11, move up to \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached, \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 12 turns without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 0: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For left-moving cars, the span [h, τ] moves left by s per turn, so at time T, it's [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]. For right-moving, [τ, h] moves right, so [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn, so you only check for collision on the row you're currently on.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=2, player at (0,0). I need to go to (0,9).\n\nFirst, list the car states for each freeway at t1=2.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nSince it's left-moving, direction left, so head is at -24, tail at 11? That seems odd because usually for left-moving, head is left, tail right? Let me read the definition.\n\nIt says: left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut if h is head and τ is tail, for left-moving, head should be on the left, so if h = -24 and τ = 11, that means at t1, the car spans from -24 to 11, which is from left to right? But it's moving left, so as it moves left, both ends decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span [τ, h] with τ tail, h head? It says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" for both, but the span is defined differently.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nThen for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut if head is at h and tail at τ, and it's left-moving, typically head is the front, so if moving left, head should be on the left, so h should be less than τ? In this case, for freeway 1, h=-24, τ=11, so h < τ, and since it's left-moving, [h, τ] = [-24, 11], so it's from x=-24 to x=11.\n\nThen at time T, span is [ -24 - 36(T-2), 11 - 36(T-2) ]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor freeway 3, for example, cars: (60,49,right,6), so head at 60, tail at 49, so since right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [49,60] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, (24,13,right,6) -> [13,24], and (-12,-23,right,6) -> head -12, tail -23? But tail at -23, head at -12, so if moving right, head should be on the right, so h should be greater than τ? Here h=-12, τ=-23, so h > τ, so span [τ,h] = [-23,-12].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you are still on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nThe collision definition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you might move to a different row for the next turn, but during turn T, you are on y_T, so only cars on y_T matter for collision at that turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn t1=2.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars on them, only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns, I need to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, to go from 0 to 9, minimum H is 9 turns if I go up every turn, but I might have to wait or detour if there are cars.\n\nBut in this case, I need to see when the cars cross x=0.\n\nAlso, since the cars move continuously, I need to find times when for a given freeway, at turn T, there is a car where 0 is in its span.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the times when it is dangerous, i.e., when 0 is occupied.\n\nSince the player moves one row per turn potentially, I need to consider for each row and each turn whether it is safe.\n\nBut turns start from t1=2.\n\nLet me define T relative to t1. Set t = 0 at turn t1, so current turn is t=0, position y=0.\n\nThen at turn t (relative), time from start is t, so absolute turn is t1 + t = 2 + t.\n\nPlayer position at turn t is y_t.\n\nActions at turn t affect y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T (absolute), player is at position (0, y_T).\n\nThen player chooses action a_T, which determines Δy_T, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn T for y_T.\n\nIn the update: \"player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nWith Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn t only if on freeway y_t and 0 in span for some car on that freeway at turn t.\n\nIn the task, it says \"at turn T\", and T is the turn number.\n\nFor this problem, since we start at turn t1=2, and we go to turn t1+H-1 when y=9.\n\nLet me set t=0 for simplicity, meaning turns after start.\n\nSo let τ be the number of turns after t1.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn t1=2), y=0.\n\nThen at each step τ, we choose action a_{t1+τ}, which sets y_{τ+1}.\n\nPosition at turn τ: y_τ\n\nAfter action a_τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nCollision at turn τ (absolute turn t1+τ) if on y_τ and 0 in car span on row y_τ at that turn.\n\nWe need to reach y_H = 9 for some H, with minimal H.\n\ny_H is position after H turns? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0 (initial)\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nGenerally, at step τ, position y_τ\n\nAction a_τ determines Δy_τ, so y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nAfter H steps, we have y_H, and we want y_H = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nIn the answer format, it says {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd at turn t1+H-1, position should be (0,9).\n\nAt turn T = t1 + k, position is y_k, and after action, y_{k+1}, but at turn T, we are at y_k.\n\nWe need that at turn t1+H-1, y_{H-1} = 9? Let's see the indexing.\n\nSet: let k be the step, from k=0 to k=H-1.\n\nAt absolute turn t_k = t1 + k\n\nPosition at turn t_k is y_k\n\nThen action a_{t_k} determines Δy_k, so y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k\n\nAfter action at turn t_k, position changes to y_{k+1} for the next turn.\n\nAt turn t_k, we are at y_k.\n\nWe want at some turn t_{H-1} = t1 + H - 1, y_{H-1} = 9.\n\nThe actions are for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is k=0 to k=H-1, a_{t1+k} for k=0 to H-1.\n\nAnd at the last turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at turn t1, and after H-1 actions, we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe minimal number of actions is at least 9, since we need to increase y by 9.\n\nBut we might have to go down or stay to avoid, so H could be more than 9.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway row, at which turns it is occupied at x=0.\n\nDefine for each row i from 1 to 8, the set of turns T (absolute) where 0 is in the span of some car on row i at turn T.\n\nSince cars move at constant speed, the occupation is periodic or can be calculated.\n\nFirst, let's handle each freeway separately.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36) at t1=2.\n\nLeft-moving, span at time T: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-24 - 36(T-2), 11 - 36(T-2)]\n\n0 is in span if -24 -36(T-2) <= 0 <= 11 -36(T-2)\n\nSince the car is moving left, the span shifts left.\n\nSet u = T-2, time from now.\n\nThen span at u: [-24 -36u, 11 -36u]\n\n0 in span: -24 -36u <= 0 <= 11 -36u\n\nWhich means:\n\nFrom left: -24 -36u <= 0 => -36u <= 24 => u >= -24/36 = -2/3, but u = T-2 >=0 since T>=2, so u>=0, so -24-36u <=0 always true for u>=0? -24-36u <=0 for u>0, at u=0, -24<=0 true.\n\n-24-36u <=0 for all u>=0.\n\nNow right inequality: 0 <= 11 -36u => 36u <=11 => u <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo u <= 11/36\n\nSince u integer? Turns are integer, T integer, u integer.\n\nu = T - t1 = T - 2, integer.\n\nSo u <= floor(11/36) but 11/36 <1, so u <=0.\n\nu <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so for integer u, u=0.\n\nAt u=0, T=2, span [-24,11], 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nFor u=1, T=3, span [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60,-25], 0 not in [-60,-25], so not occupied.\n\nSimilarly for u>1, further left.\n\nSo freeway 1 is occupied only at T=2, u=0.\n\nAt T=2, row 1 has a car at x=0.\n\nBut at turn T=2, we are at y=0, not on row 1, so for us, when we are on row 1, it might be safe except at T=2.\n\nBut we are not on row 1 at T=2.\n\nNow, freeway 2: similarly, (-24,11,left,36) same as row 1.\n\nCars: \"2 | (-24, 11, left, 36)\" same as row 1.\n\nSo also occupied only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nRight-moving.\n\nFor each car, span at time T.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,6), head 60, tail 49, direction right.\n\nSpan at t1=2: [τ, h] = [49,60] since right-moving.\n\nThen at T, span [49 + 6(T-2), 60 + 6(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,6), span [13 + 6(T-2), 24 + 6(T-2)]\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,6), head -12, tail -23, so since right-moving, τ=-23, h=-12, span [τ, h] = [-23,-12] at t1.\n\nAt T: [-23 + 6(T-2), -12 + 6(T-2)]\n\nNow, 0 in span for row 3 if for any car, 0 in their span at T.\n\nSet u = T-2.\n\nFirst car: span [49 +6u, 60+6u], 0 in [49+6u,60+6u] only if 49+6u <=0<=60+6u, but 49+6u >=49>0 for u>=0, so 0 not in this span, since min is 49+6u>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [13+6u,24+6u], min 13+6u >=13>0 for u>=0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [-23+6u, -12+6u]\n\n0 in span if -23+6u <=0<= -12+6u\n\nLeft: -23+6u <=0 => 6u <=23 => u <= 23/6 ≈3.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -12+6u => 12 <=6u => u >=2\n\nSo for u>=2 and u<=3.833, integer u, u=2,3.\n\nu=2: T=4, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0<=0? 0 in [-11,0], yes, since -11<=0<=0.\n\nThe span is inclusive, I assume, since it says \"within the span\".\n\nSimilarly, u=3: T=5, span [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nu=4: T=6, span [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in, since min 1>0.\n\nSo for row 3, occupied at T=4 and T=5 (u=2,3)\n\nT=4 and T=5 absolute.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as row 3: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nSo same as row 3, occupied at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow freeway 5: only one car: (60,49,right,6)\n\nSpan at T: [49 +6(T-2), 60 +6(T-2)]\n\nMin 49+6u >0 for u>=0, so 0 never in span, so row 5 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same, (60,49,right,6), always min>0, safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same car, (60,49,right,6), safe.\n\nFreeway 8: same, (60,49,right,6), safe.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all have only one car each, (60,49,right,6), which is always to the right, so x>=49>0, so never at x=0, so always safe.\n\nNow freeways 1 and 2 are only occupied at T=2, which is now, but we are not on them.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nWe start at τ=0 (turn 2), y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are always safe, we can go through them anytime.\n\nBut we need to avoid rows 1-4 when they are occupied.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nRow 1: occupied only at T=2, u=0\n\nRow 2: same, only at T=2\n\nRow 3: occupied at T=4 and T=5\n\nRow 4: occupied at T=4 and T=5\n\nRows 1 and 2 are safe except at T=2, but since we start at y=0 at T=2, we are not on row 1 or 2, so for future, if we go to row 1 or 2, it is safe except we shouldn't be there at T=2, but T=2 is past, so row 1 and 2 are safe for T>2.\n\nSimilarly, row 3 and 4 are unsafe at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow, we need to go up from y=0.\n\nAt turn T=2, we are at y=0. We choose action to go to y=1 or stay or down, but down to 0 or negative? y must be in [0,9], so from 0, we can go up to 1 or stay at 0, cannot go down.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, we can stay or go down, but we need to reach 9.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on row 3 or 4 at T=4 or T=5.\n\nT=4 and T=5 are absolute turns.\n\nSince we start at T=2, let's list the absolute turns and which rows are dangerous.\n\nTurn T | Dangerous rows\n\nT=2: row 1 and 2 occupied, but we are at y=0, so not affected.\n\nT=3: no row occupied? Row 1 and 2 only at T=2, row 3 and 4 at T=4,5.\n\nAt T=3: row 1: span at T=3, u=1, [-24-36,11-36]=[-60,-25], 0 not in\n\nRow 2: same\n\nRow 3: at T=3, u=1, for third car: [-23+6(1), -12+6(1)] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, min -17<0< -6? -6 >0? -17 <=0 <= -6? 0 <= -6 false, so no.\n\nSimilarly other cars not near 0.\n\nRow 4 same.\n\nSo T=3, all rows safe.\n\nT=4: row 3 and 4 occupied, as above.\n\nT=5: row 3 and 4 occupied.\n\nT=6: row 3: at u=4, span third car [1,12], 0 not in; similarly row 4 same. Other rows safe. So safe.\n\nT=7 and later: safe, since row 1 and 2 cars are gone, row 3 and 4 cars moved away.\n\nNow, player position.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nStart at T=2, y=0.\n\nWe choose actions to move.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to increase y as fast as possible, but avoid being on row 3 or 4 at T=4 or T=5.\n\nSince row 3 and 4 are y=3 and 4? Freeway k is row y=k, I assume.\n\nFreeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, etc., up to y=8.\n\nSo rows: y=1 to y=8.\n\nDanger at T=4 and T=5 for y=3 and y=4.\n\nWe need to not be on y=3 at T=4 or T=5, and not on y=4 at T=4 or T=5.\n\nAt other times, it's safe.\n\nNow, the path: from y=0 at T=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible to go up each turn, but we might need to wait or skip the dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are always safe, we can go directly up if we time it.\n\nList the turns and positions.\n\nSet τ=0: T=2, y=0\n\nAction a_0: we can choose U or S (since D would go to -1, invalid, so only U or S)\n\nIf U, go to y=1 at next turn.\n\nIf S, stay at y=0.\n\nNow, we want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nBut if we go up every turn:\n\nStart: τ=0, T=2, y=0, action U, then y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1, T=3, y=1, action U, y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2, T=4, y=2, action U, y=3 at τ=3\n\nBut at τ=2, T=4, y=2, position y=2, which is row 2, but row 2 is safe at T=4, since only dangerous at T=2.\n\nThen action U to go to y=3 at next turn.\n\nNow at τ=3, T=5, y=3? Let's see:\n\nAfter action at τ=2, T=4, we set y for τ=3.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn τ: position y_τ, action a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nAt τ=0: T=2, y_0=0, action a_0, say U, then y_1 = 0 +1 =1\n\nNow at turn τ=1: T=3, y_1=1, we are on row 1 at T=3. Row 1 safe at T=3? Yes, as above.\n\nAction a_1, say U, then y_2 =1 +1=2\n\nTurn τ=2: T=4, y_2=2, on row 2 at T=4. Safe, since row 2 dangerous only at T=2.\n\nAction a_2, if U, then y_3 =2+1=3\n\nTurn τ=3: T=5, y_3=3, on row 3 at T=5. But row 3 is dangerous at T=5! Because occupied.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf we go up, at T=5 we are on y=3, which is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue.\n\ny_3=3 at T=5, dangerous.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=3 or y=4 at T=4 or T=5.\n\nT=4 and T=5 both dangerous for y=3 and y=4.\n\nAt T=4, if on y=3 or y=4, collision.\n\nAt T=5, if on y=3 or y=4, collision.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, at T=4, we are on y=2, which is safe.\n\nAt T=5, we would be on y=3 if we go up, but dangerous.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=3 at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, we could be on y=4 at T=5, also dangerous.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Stay at y=2 at T=4, then at T=5, if we stay or go down, but we need to go up eventually.\n\n- Or go up to y=3 at a different time.\n\nSince at T=4, we are at y=2 (if we went up twice from start).\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe dangerous turns are T=4 and T=5, only for rows y=3 and y=4.\n\nOther rows and other times are safe.\n\nSo, for example, we can be on y=3 only if not at T=4 or T=5.\n\nSimilarly for y=4.\n\nSince we need to pass through all rows, we can delay or advance the time we are on y=3 and y=4.\n\nList the possible times we can be on each row safely.\n\nRow y=1: safe for all T except T=2, but T=2 is past, so all T>=3 safe.\n\nRow y=2: same, safe for T>=3.\n\nRow y=3: safe except T=4 and T=5, so safe for T=2,3,6,7,... but T=2 is past, so safe for T=3,6,7,...\n\nT=3: u=1, row 3 at T=3, as above, not occupied, safe.\n\nT=4 and T=5 occupied, unsafe.\n\nT=6 safe, etc.\n\nSimilarly, row y=4: same, safe except T=4 and T=5.\n\nRow y=5 to y=8: always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9: safe, no cars.\n\nNow, we start at T=2, y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on y=3 or y=4 at T=4 or T=5.\n\nSince T=4 and T=5 are consecutive, we can be below or above during that time.\n\nFor example, at T=4, we should not be on y=3 or 4, so we can be on y<=2 or y>=5.\n\nSimilarly at T=5, not on y=3 or 4, so y<=2 or y>=5.\n\nNow, let's plan the path from start.\n\nAt T=2, y=0. Action: we can go up to y=1 or stay.\n\nIf stay at y=0, then at T=3, we are still at y=0, then we can go up, but that delays.\n\nBetter to go up.\n\nAssume we go up each turn unless necessary to wait.\n\nBut we need to skip y=3 and y=4 during T=4 and T=5.\n\nT=4 and T=5 are turns when we might be on those rows.\n\nSince we start at T=2, y=0.\n\nAfter one up: at T=3, y=1 (if we go up at T=2)\n\nThen at T=3, y=1, we can go up to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=2, which is safe (y=2 not dangerous at T=4)\n\nNow, from y=2 at T=4, we want to go to y=5 or something, but we need to pass y=3 and y=4.\n\nBut at T=4, if we go up to y=3, then at T=5, y=3, which is dangerous.\n\nIf we stay at y=2 at T=4, then at T=5, we are at y=2, which is safe (y=2 not dangerous at T=5), then at T=5, we can go up to y=3, but at T=5, y=3 is dangerous! At T=5, if we are on y=3, collision.\n\nSo if at T=4 we are at y=2, and we stay, then at T=5 we are at y=2, safe, but then we need to go up to y=3 at some point.\n\nBut if at T=5, we go up to y=3, then at T=6 we would be at y=3, but T=6 is safe for y=3.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOption 1: stay at y=2 during T=4 and T=5.\n\nAt T=4, y=2, safe. Action: S (stay), so y remains 2 for next turn.\n\nThen at T=5, y=2, safe. Then action U, go to y=3 at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=3, which is safe (since T=6>5).\n\nThen from there go up to y=4, etc.\n\nBut we wasted two turns staying at y=2.\n\nTotal turns: start T=2 y=0, action U to y=1 at T=3\n\nT=3 y=1, action U to y=2 at T=4\n\nT=4 y=2, action S to stay y=2 at T=5\n\nT=5 y=2, action U to y=3 at T=6\n\nT=6 y=3, action U to y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7 y=4, action U to y=5 at T=8\n\nT=8 y=5, action U to y=6 at T=9\n\nT=9 y=6, action U to y=7 at T=10\n\nT=10 y=7, action U to y=8 at T=11\n\nT=11 y=8, action U to y=9 at T=12\n\nThen at T=12, y=9, reached.\n\nBut H: from τ=0 to τ=10? Let's count.\n\nAt turn T=2 (τ=0), y=0\n\nAfter H actions, at turn T=2+H-1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at T=12, which is t1 + H -1 = 2 + H -1 =12, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nT=2 + H -1 =12, so 2 + H -1 =12, H-1=10, H=11 actions.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are safe, we can go faster to higher rows before T=4.\n\nFor example, at T=2, y=0, go up to y=1 at T=3.\n\nT=3, y=1, go up to y=2 at T=4.\n\nNow at T=4, y=2, instead of staying, go up to y=3? But at T=5, if y=3, dangerous.\n\nUnless we can jump over.\n\nBut we can only change by 1, so from y=2, we can go to y=3 or stay or down, but down to y=1 not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: go up faster initially.\n\nAt T=2, y=0, go up to y=1.\n\nT=3, y=1, go up to y=2.\n\nBut at T=3, we are at y=1, we could go up to y=2 at T=4, or we could go up twice? No, only one action per turn.\n\nEach turn, one action, change y by at most 1.\n\nSo from y=0 to y=2 takes at least two turns: to T=3 y=1, then T=4 y=2.\n\nThen from y=2, to go to y=5, we need three more turns, but during T=4 and T=5, we are at y=2 or y=3 or y=4.\n\nIf we go up from y=2 at T=4 to y=3 at T=5, then at T=5 y=3 dangerous.\n\nIf we stay at y=2 at T=4, then at T=5 y=2, safe, then at T=5 go to y=3, but at T=6 y=3, safe.\n\nBut we lose time.\n\nTo save time, we can be on a higher row before T=4.\n\nFor example, at T=2, y=0, go up to y=1 at T=3.\n\nThen at T=3, y=1, instead of going to y=2, we could... but we have to go through y=2.\n\nUnless we start later, but we start now.\n\nAnother thought: at T=2, we stay at y=0, but that delays.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr, we can go down, but from y=0, cannot go down.\n\nSo only options at start: U or S.\n\nS is worse.\n\nSo best to go up.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=5 or above by T=4, so we are safe during T=4 and T=5.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nFrom y=0 at T=2.\n\nAfter one action: T=3, y=1\n\nAfter two actions: T=4, y=2 (if we go up both times)\n\ny=2 at T=4.\n\nTo be at y=5 at T=4, we need to go up three times in one turn? Impossible, max one per turn.\n\nSo at T=4, we can be at most y=2.\n\nSimilarly, at T=5, we can be at most y=3 if we went up from y=2 at T=4.\n\nBut y=3 at T=5 dangerous.\n\nIf at T=4 we stay at y=2, then at T=5 y=2, then we can go to y=3 at T=6.\n\nBut as before, slow.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=3 before T=4 or after T=5.\n\nFor example, at T=3, we can be at y=2.\n\nHow?\n\nAt T=2, y=0, go up to y=1 at T=3.\n\nAt T=3, y=1, we can go up to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAt T=3, we are at y=1.\n\nTo be at y=2 at T=3, we need to have been at y=1 at T=2 and go up, but at T=2 we started at y=0, so impossible to be at y=2 at T=3.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=2 is T=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at T=5 if we go up, or later.\n\nNow, to avoid y=3 and y=4 at T=4 and T=5.\n\nAt T=4, since we can be at most y=2, we are safe if we are at y<=2.\n\nAt T=5, we can be at y=2 or y=3 or higher.\n\nIf we are at y=2 at T=4 and go up, at T=5 we are at y=3, dangerous.\n\nIf we stay at y=2 at T=4, then at T=5 we are at y=2, safe, then we can go up later.\n\nBut we need to go to y=3 at some safe time.\n\nSafe times for y=3: T=3,6,7,...\n\nBut at T=3, we are at y=1, not y=3.\n\nAt T=6, we can be at y=3.\n\nSimilarly for y=4.\n\nSo, one way is to be at y=2 at T=4 and T=5, by staying at T=4.\n\nThen at T=5, from y=2, go up to y=3 at T=6.\n\nThen at T=6, y=3, safe, go up to y=4 at T=7.\n\nT=7 y=4, safe (since T=7>5), go up to y=5 at T=8, and so on to y=9 at T=12.\n\nAs before, H=11.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 faster if we go to higher rows earlier, but we are limited by the speed.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=5, we go to y=3 at T=6, y=4 at T=7, y=5 at T=8, etc., up to y=9 at T=12.\n\nT=12 is turn, with y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=10, 11 actions? Let's list:\n\nτ=0, T=2, y=0, action U → y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1, T=3, y=1, action U → y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2, T=4, y=2, action S → y=2 at τ=3 (since stay)\n\nτ=3, T=5, y=2, action U → y=3 at τ=4\n\nτ=4, T=6, y=3, action U → y=4 at τ=5\n\nτ=5, T=7, y=4, action U → y=5 at τ=6\n\nτ=6, T=8, y=5, action U → y=6 at τ=7\n\nτ=7, T=9, y=6, action U → y=7 at τ=8\n\nτ=8, T=10, y=7, action U → y=8 at τ=9\n\nτ=9, T=11, y=8, action U → y=9 at τ=10\n\nAt τ=10, T=12, y=9.\n\nSo we reach at T=12 with y=9, after 10 actions? τ from 0 to 9 is 10 actions? Let's see:\n\nActions at turns: a_t1 to a_t1+H-1, with t1+H-1=12, t1=2, so 2+H-1=12, H-1=10, H=11 actions.\n\nAnd at turn t1+H-1=12, position y=9.\n\nBut we can reduce H by not staying.\n\nFor example, can we be on y=3 at T=3?\n\nAt T=3, we can be at y=1 or y=2? At T=3, y=1 if we went up from y=0 at T=2.\n\nTo be at y=3 at T=3, impossible from start.\n\nEarliest y=3 is T=5 if we go up continuously.\n\nBut at T=5, y=3 dangerous.\n\nNext is T=6.\n\nSimilarly, can we be on y=4 at T=3? No.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=5 directly by T=5 or something.\n\nBut from start, at T=4, y=2 max.\n\nAt T=5, y=3 max if we go up.\n\ny=3 at T=5 dangerous.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to lower rows temporarily, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at T=2, y=0, go up to y=1.\n\nT=3, y=1, instead of going up, go down? But y=0, but we can, but then we are lower.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr stay at y=1 at T=3.\n\nThen at T=4, we are at y=1, which is safe (y=1 safe at T=4), then we can go up to y=2 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, y=2, safe, since y=2 not dangerous at T=5.\n\nThen from y=2 at T=5, go up to y=3 at T=6, etc.\n\nBut let's see the sequence:\n\nτ=0, T=2, y=0, action U → y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1, T=3, y=1, action S → y=1 at τ=2  (stay at y=1)\n\nτ=2, T=4, y=1, action U → y=2 at τ=3\n\nτ=3, T=5, y=2, action U → y=3 at τ=4\n\nτ=4, T=6, y=3, action U → y=4 at τ=5\n\nτ=5, T=7, y=4, action U → y=5 at τ=6\n\nτ=6, T=8, y=5, action U → y=6 at τ=7\n\nτ=7, T=9, y=6, action U → y=7 at τ=8\n\nτ=8, T=10, y=7, action U → y=8 at τ=9\n\nτ=9, T=11, y=8, action U → y=9 at τ=10\n\nSame as before, T=12 y=9, H=11.\n\nNo better.\n\nBut in this case, at T=4 we are at y=1, at T=5 at y=2, both safe, but we delayed going up.\n\nStill 11 turns.\n\nTo save a turn, we need to reach y=9 earlier.\n\nMinimal possible H: since 9 steps up, at least 9 actions, so H>=9.\n\nWith H=9, we would reach y=9 at turn t1+8 =2+8=10, so at T=10, y=9.\n\nIs it possible with H=9?\n\nThat means we go up every turn from τ=0 to τ=8.\n\nThen:\n\nτ=0, T=2, y=0, action U → y=1 at T=3\n\nτ=1, T=3, y=1, action U → y=2 at T=4\n\nτ=2, T=4, y=2, action U → y=3 at T=5\n\nBut at T=5, y=3, and row 3 occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we skip some action, but we need to go up 9 times, so 9 actions minimum, but with possible stay or down, but that increases H, so for H=9, we must go up 9 times, no stay or down.\n\nSo positions: at T=2, y=0\n\nAfter actions: T=3 y=1, T=4 y=2, T=5 y=3, T=6 y=4, T=7 y=5, T=8 y=6, T=9 y=7, T=10 y=8, T=11 y=9? With 9 actions.\n\nStart τ=0, T=2, y=0, action U, y1=1 at T=3\n\nAction at τ=1, T=3, U, y2=2 at T=4\n\nAction at τ=2, T=4, U, y3=3 at T=5\n\nAt T=5, we are on y=3, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we could be at higher y earlier, but we can't.\n\nSo impossible with H=9.\n\nSimilarly, H=10: 10 actions, reach at T=2+9=11.\n\nWith 10 actions, we can have 9 up and one stay or something.\n\nFor example, go up to y=2 at T=4, then stay at y=2 at T=5, then go up to y=3 at T=6, etc.\n\nSequence:\n\nτ=0, T=2, y=0, U → y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1, T=3, y=1, U → y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2, T=4, y=2, S → y=2 at τ=3  (stay, so at T=5 y=2)\n\nτ=3, T=5, y=2, U → y=3 at τ=4\n\nτ=4, T=6, y=3, U → y=4 at τ=5\n\nτ=5, T=7, y=4, U → y=5 at τ=6\n\nτ=6, T=8, y=5, U → y=6 at τ=7\n\nτ=7, T=9, y=6, U → y=7 at τ=8\n\nτ=8, T=10, y=7, U → y=8 at τ=9\n\nτ=9, T=11, y=8, U → y=9 at τ=10\n\nAt τ=10, T=12, y=9? Let's see when we reach y=9.\n\nAfter action at τ=9, T=11, U from y=8 to y=9, so at next turn, τ=10, T=12, y=9.\n\nBut with 10 actions (τ=0 to 9), we have y at τ=10 is 9, at T=12.\n\nBut for H=10, we should reach at T=2+10-1=11 with y=9.\n\nHere at T=11, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nAt turn T=11, which is τ=9, y=8, then after action U, y=9 at T=12.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, we need to have the position at that turn be 9.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=11, y=8, not 9.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at T=12.\n\nWith H actions, we reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor H=10, t1+H-1=2+10-1=11, so at T=11, y must be 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=11, y=8.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=11, we need to be at y=8 at T=10 or something.\n\nLet's list the turn and position after actions.\n\nDefine: at turn T, position y(T)\n\nFor T=2, y(2)=0\n\nAfter action at T, y(T+1) = y(T) + Δy\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we care about y(T).\n\nWe want y(T) for some T.\n\nWith minimal T - t1 +1 or something.\n\nStart at T=2, y=0.\n\nWe want y(T) =9 for some T, with minimal T - 2 +1? The number of turns from start to end is (T - 2) +1? From T=2 to T, inclusive, number of turns is T-2+1 = T-1.\n\nFor example, from T=2 to T=2, one turn, but we start at position.\n\nThe number of actions is the number of turns from t1 to the turn before we reach, but we reach at turn T with y(T)=9.\n\nThe actions are from turn t1 to turn T-1? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y(T), and we may perform action to change for next turn.\n\nBut when we reach y=9 at turn T, we don't need to act after that.\n\nIn this case, we perform actions from turn t1 to the turn when we reach y=9, but at the turn when y=9, we may not need to act, but the action sequence is until we reach.\n\nIn the problem, we find H and actions from t1 to t1+H-1 such that at turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nSo we perform H actions, and after the last action, at turn t1+H-1, position is 9.\n\nThe actions are at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t1+k for k=0 to H-1, we perform action a_{t1+k}, and after that, at turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nFor k from 0 to H-1, action at t1+k determines Δy for that turn, so y at turn t1+k+1 = y at t1+k + Δy at t1+k.\n\nBut at turn t1+k, position is y before action? No.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, position is y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines Δy_T, so for the next turn, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, position is y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we are at y_T, and we check collision based on that.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn T, position y_T.\n\nWe start at T=t1=2, y_2=0.\n\nWe perform action a_2, which sets y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\nThen at turn 3, y_3, action a_3, sets y_4, etc.\n\nAfter H-1 actions (from T=2 to T=2+H-2? Let's index.\n\nSet the turn index.\n\nLet T = t1 + t for t=0 to ?\n\nAt T = t1 + t, position y_t\n\nThen action a_{t1+t} determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nThen at next turn T+1 = t1 + (t+1), position y_{t+1}\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAt turn t1 + t, position y_t.\n\nCollision at turn t1+t if on row y_t and 0 in span.\n\nWe want for some H, at turn t1 + (H-1), position y_{H-1} =9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=H-2? Let's see.\n\nAt t=0, turn t1, position y_0, action a_{t1} determines y_1\n\nAt t=1, turn t1+1, position y_1, action a_{t1+1} determines y_2\n\n...\nAt t=H-2, turn t1+H-2, position y_{H-2}, action a_{t1+H-2} determines y_{H-1}\n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, position y_{H-1} =9, and we are done, no action needed at that turn for movement, but we may have performed an action to get there.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, but at turn t1+H-1, we perform an action that sets y for the next turn, but since we reach y=9 at that turn, we don't care about next.\n\nFor example, at turn t1+H-1, we are at position y_{H-1}, and we perform some action, but since we are at 9, we might do S or something, but the position at that turn is 9 before action.\n\nThe position at turn T is defined before the action.\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, position y_{H-1} =9.\n\nThe actions are from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, each action at turn T determines the change for the next position.\n\nFor turn t1+H-1, we perform an action, but it doesn't affect the position at that turn, only the next, but since we don't care about next, we can choose any action, but to be at y=9, if we are at y=9, we can choose S to stay, or U or D but y=9, U would go to 10 invalid, so only S or D to 8, but we want to be at 9, so we choose S or something.\n\nBut the key is that at turn t1+H-1, we must be at y=9.\n\nTo reach that with minimal H.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nWith H=10, we can reach at T=2+10-1=11 with y=9.\n\nIs it possible?\n\nFor example, start T=2, y=0, action U, so y=1 at T=3\n\nT=3, y=1, action U, y=2 at T=4\n\nT=4, y=2, action U, but if U, y=3 at T=5, but at T=5 y=3 dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nT=4, y=2, action S, y=2 at T=5\n\nT=5, y=2, action U, y=3 at T=6\n\nBut at T=6 y=3, then we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=3 at T=6, to y=9, we need 6 more up actions.\n\nT=6 y=3, U to y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7 y=4, U to y=5 at T=8\n\nT=8 y=5, U to y=6 at T=9\n\nT=9 y=6, U to y=7 at T=10\n\nT=10 y=7, U to y=8 at T=11\n\nT=11 y=8, U to y=9 at T=12\n\nBut at T=11 y=8, not 9. To have y=9 at T=11, we need to be at y=8 at T=10 and go U.\n\nBut in above, at T=10 y=7.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at T=12.\n\nWith actions from T=2 to T=11? Let's list the turns where we act.\n\nAct at T=2: U, so at T=3 y=1\n\nAct at T=3: U, at T=4 y=2\n\nAct at T=4: S, at T=5 y=2\n\nAct at T=5: U, at T=6 y=3\n\nAct at T=6: U, at T=7 y=4\n\nAct at T=7: U, at T=8 y=5\n\nAct at T=8: U, at T=9 y=6\n\nAct at T=9: U, at T=10 y=7\n\nAct at T=10: U, at T=11 y=8\n\nAct at T=11: U, at T=12 y=9\n\nActions at T=2 to T=11, that's 10 actions (H=10), but at turn t1+H-1=2+10-1=11, y=8, not 9. Mistake.\n\nt1+H-1=2+10-1=11, at turn 11, position y=8, but we want y=9 at turn 11.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn T=11, we need at turn T=11, position y=9.\n\nThat means at turn T=10, position y=8 or y=9, but if y=9 at T=10, then at T=11 it could be 9 or 8 or 10, but we want at T=11 y=9.\n\nIf at T=10 y=8, then action U at T=10, y=9 at T=11.\n\nIf at T=10 y=9, action S, y=9 at T=11.\n\nSo to have y=9 at T=11, we need to be at y=8 or y=9 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, for minimal H.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=11 with H=10.\n\nT=11 = t1 + H-1 =2 +10-1=11, yes.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at T=11.\n\nSo we need to have y_10 such that after action at T=10, y_11=9, so if y_10=8, action U, or y_10=9, action S.\n\nBut we start from y=0 at T=2.\n\nSo from T=2 to T=11, 10 turns, but positions from T=2 to T=11.\n\nNumber of steps: from T=2 to T=11, 10 positions, 9 changes? Let's think of the state.\n\nAt T=2: y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: at T=3, y\n\nAfter 2 actions: at T=4, y\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at T=2+k, y\n\nWe want at some T, y=9.\n\nT = 2 + k for k the number of actions performed.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn T=2+k.\n\nPosition at turn 2+k.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at T=2, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action, at T=3, y\n\nAfter 2 actions, at T=4, y\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions, at T=2+m, position y.\n\nWe want y=9 at some T=2+m, with m min.\n\nThen H = m+1? Because actions from t1 to t1+m, number of actions H=m+1, and at turn t1+m, position 9.\n\nt1+m =2+m, and at that turn, position 9.\n\nH actions: actions at t1 to t1+H-1, after which at turn t1+H-1 position 9.\n\nSo for turn t1+H-1 position 9.\n\nWith H actions, we reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor turn t1+H-1 =2+H-1=1+H.\n\nSet S = t1+H-1, the turn when we are at 9.\n\nThen S =2+H-1, so H = S-1.\n\nBut S is the turn number.\n\nFrom start, to reach at turn S, with position 9, the number of actions is S-2, since from T=2 to T=S-1 we act, and at T=S we are at 9.\n\nActions at T=2 to T=S-1, S-2 actions? T from 2 to S-1 inclusive, number of actions is (S-1) - 2 +1 = S-2.\n\nFor example, to reach at T=3, we can act at T=2: if U, then at T=3 y=1, not 9.\n\nTo reach at T=2, no action, y=0, not 9.\n\nTo reach at T=11, we need to act from T=2 to T=10, 9 actions, then at T=11 y=9.\n\nActions at T=2 to T=10, 9 actions, at T=11 position y=9.\n\nThen H=9, turn t1+H-1=2+9-1=10, but at T=10, we are not at 9, we act at T=10 to set y at T=11.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, position 9.\n\nFor H=9, t1+H-1=2+9-1=10, so at T=10, position must be 9.\n\nFor that, we need to be at y=9 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, for H=10, at T=11 y=9.\n\nNow, to have y=9 at T=10, we need 9 up actions in 8 turns? From T=2 y=0 to T=10 y=9, we need to increase y by 9 in 8 steps (from T=2 to T=10, 8 intervals).\n\nFrom turn T to turn T+1, y can increase by at most 1.\n\nFrom T=2 to T=10, 8 steps, can increase y by at most 8, from 0 to 8, not to 9.\n\nMin turn to reach y=9: earliest possible is T=11, with y=9, by going up every turn from T=2 to T=10.\n\nAt T=2 y=0, act U, T=3 y=1, U, T=4 y=2, U, T=5 y=3, U, T=6 y=4, U, T=7 y=5, U, T=8 y=6, U, T=9 y=7, U, T=10 y=8, then at T=10 act U, T=11 y=9.\n\nSo at T=11, y=9.\n\nWith actions from T=2 to T=10, 9 actions, H=9, but at turn t1+H-1=2+9-1=10, position y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have position at turn T=10 be 9, we need to be at y=8 at T=9 and act U at T=9, so at T=10 y=9.\n\nBut at T=9, to be at y=8, we need to have acted from T=2 to T=8.\n\nT=2 y=0, act U, T=3 y=1, ..., up to T=9 y=7 (after 7 actions), then act U at T=9, T=10 y=8, then to have y=9 at T=10, we need to be at y=8 at T=9 and act U at T=9, but at T=9 we act to set y at T=10, so at T=9 position is say y, then after action U, at T=10 position y+1.\n\nTo have at T=10 position 9, we need at T=9 position 8 and action U at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, to have at T=11 position 9, need at T=10 position 8 or 9 and appropriate action.\n\nFor minimal turn to reach y=9, it is T=11 with y=9, as above, with actions at T=2 to T=10.\n\nNumber of actions: 9 actions, H=9, but at turn t1+H-1=10, position is 8, not 9.\n\nTurn t1+H-1=2+9-1=10, position at turn 10 is 8.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo for H=9, at turn 10, position 8, not 9.\n\nFor H=10, actions at T=2 to T=11, at turn t1+H-1=2+10-1=11, position at turn 11 can be 9 if we act appropriately at T=11, but at T=11 we act to set y at T=12, so position at T=11 is before action.\n\nTo have position at T=11 be 9, we need to have set it by action at T=10.\n\nFrom above, the earliest turn to have position 9 is T=11, with position at T=11 being 9, achieved by actions at T=2 to T=10 as above.\n\nThen for that, we have actions at T=2 to T=10, 9 actions, H=9, but at turn T=10 (t1+H-1=10), position is 8, not 9.\n\nAt turn T=11, position is 9, but T=11 is not t1+H-1 for H=9.\n\nFor H=10, actions at T=2 to T=11, at turn T=11 (t1+H-1=11), position can be 9 if at T=10 position 8 and action U at T=10, or position 9 and action S at T=10.\n\nIn the sequence, if we go up continuously, at T=10 position 8, then action U at T=10, at T=11 position 9.\n\nSo for H=10, actions at T=2 to T=11, but at T=11 we action U, but position at T=11 is 8 before action, after action it sets position for T=12 to 9, but at turn T=11, position is 8.\n\nWe care about position at the turn before action for collision and for the state.\n\nIn the definition, at turn T, position y_T is before action.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T, then we choose action based on that, and it determines y_{T+1}.\n\nFor the goal, at turn t1+H-1, we want y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nFor collision, at each turn T, we check based on y_T.\n\nIn the above, to have y_T=9 at some T.\n\nMin T is 11, with y_11=9.\n\nAchieved by actions at T=2 to T=10: all U, but at T=5, y_5=3, dangerous.\n\nFor y_11=9, it requires y_5=3 at T=5, which is dangerous.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach at T=11 with y=9 because we must pass through y=3 or 4 at T=5 or earlier, but at T=5, y=3 is dangerous.\n\nThe only way is to reach later.\n\nWith H=10, we can reach at T=11 with y=9, but with collision risk.\n\nBut we can reach at T=12 with y=9 safely, as in the first sequence.\n\nWith H=11, actions from T=2 to T=12, at turn T=12 y=9.\n\nBut H=11 means 11 actions, at turn t1+H-1=2+11-1=12, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence I had earlier with stay, we have at T=12 y=9 with 11 actions.\n\nBut we can do with H=10? Reach at T=11 with y=9 safely.\n\nIs it possible?\n\nTo have y_11=9, we need to go up 9 times in 9 actions, from T=2 to T=10.\n\nPositions: at T=2 y=0\n\nAfter action at T=2 U, T=3 y=1\n\nAction at T=3 U, T=4 y=2\n\nAction at T=4, if U, T=5 y=3 dangerous\n\nIf at T=4 action S, T=5 y=2\n\nThen action at T=5 U, T=6 y=3\n\nBut to reach y=9 at T=11, from T=6 y=3 to T=11 y=9, we need 5 more steps, but from T=6 to T=11 is 5 steps, can increase by 5, to y=8 at T=11, not 9.\n\nT=6 y=3, action U T=7 y=4, U T=8 y=5, U T=9 y=6, U T=10 y=7, U T=11 y=8.\n\nThen to have y=9 at T=11, we need y=8 at T=10 and action U at T=10, but at T=10 y=7, so T=11 y=8.\n\nCan't reach y=9 at T=11 with safe path.\n\nIf we go faster earlier, but we can't.\n\nSo minimal turn to reach y=9 safely is T=12 with y=9.\n\nWith actions from T=2 to T=11, 10 actions, H=10, at turn t1+H-1=2+10-1=11, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y=9 at T=12, we need actions from T=2 to T=11, 10 actions, H=10, but at turn 11, position is 8, not 9.\n\nFor turn T=12, y=9, we need actions from T=2 to T=11, 10 actions, H=10, at turn t1+H-1=2+10-1=11, position 8, not 9.\n\nt1+H-1=11, position 8.\n\nFor position at T=12 to be 9, we need to act at T=11 to set it.\n\nBut the turn when position is 9 is T=12, so for that, H must be such that t1+H-1=12, so 2+H-1=12, H=11.\n\nThen actions from T=2 to T=11, at turn T=12 position 9.\n\nWith 11 actions.\n\nAnd we can do it safely as in the first sequence with one stay.\n\nBut in that sequence, we had a stay at T=4, so it took longer.\n\nCan we reach at T=12 with y=9 with only 10 actions? 10 actions can set position at T=12 to at most 10, but from T=2 y=0, after 10 actions, at T=12 y at most 10, but y<=9, so possible y=9 or 10, but with 10 actions, from T=2 to T=11 acting, position at T=12 is set.\n\nWith 10 up actions, y=10 at T=12, but y=10 invalid, so not possible; with 9 up and one stay, y=9 at T=12.\n\nFor example, actions all U except one S somewhere.\n\nBut we need to avoid collision.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=12 with minimal actions, we can have 9 up and one stay, H=10 actions.\n\nH=10 actions from t1 to t1+9.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1=2+10-1=11, position must be 9? No.\n\nH actions, from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H-1 position 9.\n\nFor H=10, t1+H-1=2+10-1=11, position at turn 11 must be 9.\n\nBut to have position at turn 11 be 9, we need to have increased from 0 in 9 steps (from T=2 to T=11, 9 intervals), so possible with 9 up actions, position at T=11 is 9.\n\nThen actions at T=2 to T=10 with all U, but at T=5 position y=3 dangerous.\n\nWith one stay, position at T=11 is 8, not 9.\n\nSo for position at T=11 to be 9, we must have 9 up actions with no down or stay, so we must be at y=3 at T=5, dangerous.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at T=11 safely.\n\nThe earliest safe turn to be at y=9 is T=12.\n\nAt T=12, position 9.\n\nTo achieve that with H actions.\n\nFor T=12, t1+H-1=12, 2+H-1=12, H=11.\n\nActions from T=2 to T=11.\n\nWe can have a sequence with 10 up and one stay, or 9 up and two stays, etc., but to minimize H, we want as few actions as possible, but H is fixed for the turn, so with H=11, we can have 10 up and one stay, for example.\n\nPosition at T=12: from T=2 to T=11, 10 steps, can increase by 10, but y=9, so we need to increase by 9, so one stay or one down, but down not necessary.\n\nSo with 10 up and one stay in 11 actions, we can have position at T=12 be 9.\n\nSimilarly, we can have the stay at a safe place.\n\nIn the first sequence, we had a stay at T=4, but we can have the stay at another time to avoid the collision.\n\nFor example, to avoid being at y=3 or 4 at T=4 and T=5.\n\nT=4 and T=5 are dangerous for y=3 and 4.\n\nIn the direct path, at T=4 position y=2, T=5 position y=3 dangerous.\n\nSo we can stay at T=4 or at T=5.\n\nBut if we stay at T=4, position at T=5 is y=2, safe, then at T=5 action U, position at T=6 y=3, safe.\n\nThen from there go up to y=9 at T=12.\n\nSequence:\n\nT=2: y=0, action U, so position at T=3 y=1\n\nT=3: y=1, action U, position at T=4 y=2\n\nT=4: y=2, action S (stay), so position at T=5 y=2\n\nT=5: y=2, action U, position at T=6 y=3\n\nT=6: y=3, action U, position at T=7 y=4\n\nT=7: y=4, action U, position at T=8 y=5\n\nT=8: y=5, action U, position at T=9 y=6\n\nT=9: y=6, action U, position at T=10 y=7\n\nT=10: y=7, action U, position at T=11 y=8\n\nT=11: y=8, action U, position at T=12 y=9\n\nActions at T=2 to T=11, 10 actions? T=2 to T=11 is 10 turns, H=10.\n\nBut at turn t1+H-1=2+10-1=11, position y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have position at T=12 be 9, we need action at T=11 U from y=8 to y=9.\n\nBut for the goal, at turn t1+H-1, we want position 9.\n\nHere for H=10, at turn 11 position 8.\n\nFor position at T=12 to be 9, we need t1+H-1=12, so H=11.\n\nActions at T=2 to T=12? No.\n\nActions from T=2 to T=11 for H=10, but position at T=12 is not at the turn of action.\n\nLet's give up and use the initial plan.\n\nWith H=11, actions from T=2 to T=12? t1 to t1+H-1=2 to 2+11-1=12.\n\nActions at T=2 to T=12.\n\nAt T=2: action, sets position for T=3\n\n...\nAt T=12: action, sets position for T=13, but we don't care.\n\nAt turn T=12, position y_12, which is set by action at T=11.\n\nTo have y_12=9, we need action at T=11 to set it.\n\nIn the sequence, we can have:\n\nAction at T=2: U, so at T=3 y=1\n\nAction at T=3: U, at T=4 y=2\n\nAction at T=4: S, at T=5 y=2  (stay)\n\nAction at T=5: U, at T=6 y=3\n\nAction at T=6: U, at T=7 y=4\n\nAction at T=7: U, at T=8 y=5\n\nAction at T=8: U, at T=9 y=6\n\nAction at T=9: U, at T=10 y=7\n\nAction at T=10: U, at T=11 y=8\n\nAction at T=11: U, at T=12 y=9\n\nActions at T=2 to T=11, that's 10 actions, H=10.\n\nAt turn T=12, y=9, but for H=10, t1+H-1=2+10-1=11, at turn 11, y=8, not 9.\n\nThe turn when we are at y=9 is T=12, so to have that as the turn t1+H-1, we need 2+H-1=12, H=11.\n\nThen actions at T=2 to T=12.\n\nAt T=12, we perform an action, but position at T=12 is already 9, so we can choose S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence above, with 10 actions, we reach y=9 at T=12, but we have only 10 actions, from T=2 to T=11.\n\nFor H=11, we add an action at T=12, but at T=12 position is 9, we can do S.\n\nSo the sequence with H=11:\n\nAction at T=2: U\n\nAction at T=3: U\n\nAction at T=4: S\n\nAction at T=5: U\n\nAction at T=6: U\n\nAction at T=7: U\n\nAction at T=8: U\n\nAction at T=9: U\n\nAction at T=10: U\n\nAction at T=11: U  (to set y=9 at T=12)\n\nAction at T=12: S  (stay at y=9)\n\nBut at turn T=12, position is 9, and we do action S, so y remains 9.\n\nBut the position at turn T=12 is 9, which is what we want for t1+H-1=12.\n\nAnd H=11 actions.\n\nBut we can omit the last action if we reach early, but in this case, with 10 actions we can reach at T=12 with y=9, but the turn is T=12, so for that turn to be included in the action sequence, we need H such that t1+H-1=12, so H=11.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 11 with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence with 10 actions, we have position at T=12=9, but the last action is at T=11, and we don't have an action at T=12 for the sequence, but in the problem, the actions are up to the turn when we reach.\n\nI think for safety, we can use the sequence with stay at T=4.\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can avoid the collision with less delay.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 5-8 are safe, we can go to y=4 after T=5.\n\nFor example, at T=2, y=0, U to y=1 at T=3\n\nT=3, y=1, U to y=2 at T=4\n\nT=4, y=2, now instead of staying, we can go down? To y=1 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=1, safe, then we can go up to y=2 at T=6, then to y=3 at T=7, etc., but slower.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr, at T=4, y=2, go U to y=3 at T=5, but dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo the best is to stay at y=2 during T=4 and T=5 or something.\n\nIn the first sequence, with one stay, we reach at T=12.\n\nWith H=11.\n\nBut in the action sequence for H=11, we have 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can have no stay but still reach at T=12 with y=9.\n\nFor example, from start go up to y=2 at T=4, then at T=4 go U to y=3 at T=5 dangerous, not good.\n\nOr, start by staying at T=2: T=2 y=0, action S, so at T=3 y=0\n\nThen T=3 y=0, action U, at T=4 y=1\n\nT=4 y=1, action U, at T=5 y=2\n\nT=5 y=2, action U, at T=6 y=3\n\nThen same as before, but we delayed one turn, so at T=13 y=9, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11 with one stay at T=4.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=4, we stay, so position at T=5 is still y=2.\n\nThen we go up.\n\nNow for the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=2.\n\nActions from t1 to t1+H-1=2 to 12 for H=11.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S  (stay at y=2)\n\nTurn 5: U  (to y=3)\n\nTurn 6: U  (to y=4)\n\nTurn 7: U  (to y=5)\n\nTurn 8: U  (to y=6)\n\nTurn 9: U  (to y=7)\n\nTurn 10: U  (to y=8)\n\nTurn 11: U  (to y=9)\n\nTurn 12: S  (stay at y=9, but at turn 12, we are at y=9, so action S is fine)\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 12, we do action S, but position at turn 12 is already 9.\n\nSince we reach at turn 12, and we are at y=9, we can choose S.\n\nBut in the action list, we have to specify for each turn.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision.\n\nAt each turn:\n\nTurn T=2: y=0, safe\n\nAction U\n\nTurn T=3: y=1, row 1, at T=3, not occupied, safe\n\nAction U\n\nTurn T=4: y=2, row 2, at T=4, not occupied, safe\n\nAction S (stay)\n\nTurn T=5: y=2, row 2, at T=5, safe (row 2 occupied only at T=2)\n\nAction U\n\nTurn T=6: y=3, row 3, at T=6, not occupied (since occupied only at T=4,5), safe\n\nAction U\n\nTurn T=7: y=4, row 4, at T=7, safe\n\nAction U\n\nTurn T=8: y=5, safe\n\nAction U\n\nTurn T=9: y=6, safe\n\nAction U\n\nTurn T=10: y=7, safe\n\nAction U\n\nTurn T=11: y=8, safe\n\nAction U\n\nTurn T=12: y=9, safe, action S\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=11 turns for actions, from t1=2 to 12.\n\nMinimal H is 11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose we reach at T=11 with y=9, but as before, not possible safely.\n\nOr at T=12 with H=10.\n\nWith H=10, actions at T=2 to T=11.\n\nAt turn T=11, position must be 9 for t1+H-1=2+10-1=11.\n\nTo have y_11=9, we need to have gone up 9 times with no stay, but then at T=5 y=3 dangerous.\n\nIf we have one stay, y_11=8 or less, not 9.\n\nFor example, if we stay at T=4, then at T=5 y=2, T=6 y=3, ..., T=11 y=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nIf we stay at another turn, say at T=3: T=2 U, T=3 y=1, action S, T=4 y=1, action U, T=5 y=2, action U, T=6 y=3, etc., T=11 y=8.\n\nSame.\n\nSo impossible with H=10.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut for turn 12, since we are at y=9, we can do S.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nNow, for the car state, I think I covered.\n\nIn freeway 3 and 4, there are multiple cars, but I think I considered the third car which is near zero.\n\nFor row 3, at T=4 and T=5 occupied, yes.\n\nSimilarly for row 4.\n\nOther rows fine.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on rows \\(y = 3\\) or \\(y = 4\\) during turns \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 5\\), when those rows are occupied by cars. Specifically, the player stays at \\(y = 2\\) during turn \\(T = 4\\) to avoid moving to \\(y = 3\\) or \\(y = 4\\) at the dangerous times.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- At turn 2, the player moves up to \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turn 3, the player moves up to \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 4, the player stays at \\(y = 2\\) to avoid the dangerous rows at \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 5\\).\n- At turn 5, the player moves up to \\(y = 3\\) (now safe, as \\(T = 6\\) is not dangerous).\n- From turns 6 to 11, the player moves up each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n- At turn 12, the player stays at \\(y = 9\\) since the goal is reached.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 2 (\\(T = 2\\)):** Player at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no cars).\n- **Turn 3 (\\(T = 3\\)):** Player at \\(y = 1\\). Freeway 1 at \\(T = 3\\): car span \\([-60, -25]\\), 0 not in span (safe).\n- **Turn 4 (\\(T = 4\\)):** Player at \\(y = 2\\). Freeway 2 at \\(T = 4\\): car span \\([-60, -25]\\), 0 not in span (safe).\n- **Turn 5 (\\(T = 5\\)):** Player at \\(y = 2\\). Freeway 2 at \\(T = 5\\): car span \\([-60, -25]\\), 0 not in span (safe).\n- **Turn 6 (\\(T = 6\\)):** Player at \\(y = 3\\). Freeway 3 at \\(T = 6\\): cars spans \\([73, 84]\\), \\([37, 48]\\), \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in any span (safe).\n- **Turn 7 (\\(T = 7\\)):** Player at \\(y = 4\\). Freeway 4 at \\(T = 7\\): cars spans \\([73, 84]\\), \\([37, 48]\\), \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in any span (safe).\n- **Turns 8-12:** Rows \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\) are safe at all times, as cars on freeways 5-8 never occupy \\(x = 0\\), and \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 11 turns, which is minimal, as fewer turns would either require being on \\(y = 3\\) or \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 4\\) or \\(T = 5\\) (causing collision) or fail to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 11.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 5, and I'm at y=2.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span moves left with speed s, and for right-moving cars, it moves right with speed s. Collision happens only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at T+1 I'm on y+1. So I only check for collision on the freeway I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nNow, looking at the car states:\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, left-moving, head 12, tail 47, speed 36. Head and tail: since it's left-moving, head is at 12, tail at 47? That seems odd because usually head is the front, but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be the left end? Let me read the update rule.\n\nIt says: left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd for right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nThe notation is a bit confusing. For left-moving, it has [h, τ], and h and τ are given, but in the car state, for freeway 1, it's (12,47,left,36). So h=12, τ=47? But 12 < 47, so [12,47], and since it's moving left, at time T, it becomes [12 - sΔT, 47 - sΔT], so the whole interval moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it has [τ, h], so in the car state, for example, freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,6), so τ=-36, h=-47? But -36 > -47, so [τ,h] = [-36, -47], which is from -36 to -47, but that's decreasing, but since it's right-moving, the span should be increasing? I think I need to interpret the span properly.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], and then at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]. So if τ and h are such that τ < h, then it moves right. But in the car state, for right-moving, they give (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the notation, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ and h, but in the list, it's written as (h, τ, d, s), I think.\n\nLook at the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 6), so h = -36, τ = -47, d=right, s=6.\n\nFor right-moving, the span is given as [τ, h] at t_1, so [ -47, -36 ]? τ = -47, h = -36, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36], since τ should be the left end or something.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in the definition.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor car k on freeway i, at turn t_1, head at h, tail at τ.\n\nThen for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] and it moves left.\n\nBut in the example, for freeway 1, left-moving, h=12, τ=47, so [12,47]. Since it's moving left, at T, [12 - sΔT, 47 - sΔT].\n\nBut 12 to 47, that's a length of 35, and speed 36, which is fast.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, for freeway 3, car is (h, τ, d, s) = (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nFor right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h]? From the update rule: \"right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]]\"\n\nSo with τ = -47, h = -36, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36], which is from -47 to -36, and it moves right, so at T, [-47 + sΔT, -36 + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nAlso, freeway 3 has three cars: (-36,-47,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nLet's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (12,47,left,36) so span at t_1=5: [12,47] moving left at 36.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (12,47,left,36) so also [12,47] left at 36.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n\nFirst: (-36,-47,right,6) so [τ,h] for right is [ -47, -36]? τ=-47, h=-36, so [τ,h] = [-47, -36]\n\nSecond: (42,31,right,6) h=42, τ=31, so [τ,h] = [31,42]\n\nThird: (6,-5,right,6) h=6, τ=-5, so [τ,h] = [-5,6]\n\nAll moving right at speed 6.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: only (-36,-47,right,6) so [τ,h] = [-47,-36] for right\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 each have only one car: (-36,-47,right,6) so span at t_1=5: [-47,-36] moving right at 6.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9. The player starts at y=2 at turn t=5.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I assume.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), and since y=9 has no freeway, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is the start, but we start from y=2.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=2, I need to move up 7 units, so minimum moves would be 7 up actions, but I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, the minimal H might be more than 7 if there are obstacles.\n\nBut I need to find the minimal H.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to simulate when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nThe collision depends on whether 0 is in the car's span at the turn when I'm on that freeway.\n\nLet me denote t as the turn number, with t=5 current.\n\nAt each turn t, I choose action a_t, which changes y for the next turn.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t, and I choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen, at turn t, I am on freeway y_t (if y_t between 1 and 8), and I collide if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at time t.\n\nThe car spans are defined for each turn T.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, span(T) depends on t_1=5.\n\nFor example, for a left-moving car on freeway k, span(T) = [h - s(T-5), τ - s(T-5)] for T >=5\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\ns is speed, so per turn movement.\n\nSince s is given, and T-5 is integer, it should be fine.\n\nNow, 0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is at (0,y), so we care about x=0.\n\nCollision if at turn T, I'm on freeway k, and 0 is within span(T) for some car on k.\n\nNow, for freeway k, there might be multiple cars, so I need to check all on that row.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway y=1 to 8, when 0 is not covered by any car, i.e., safe to be on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince the player moves one y per turn if moving, but can stay or move down, I need to plan a path from y=2 to y=9 over time.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so when I reach y=9, I'm safe, and I need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe position is always (0,y), so only y changes.\n\nActions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny in [0,9], so if at y=0, I can only go up or stay, cannot go down. Similarly at y=9, only down or stay, but since we want to reach y=9, once there, we can stop.\n\nIn this case, we start at y=2.\n\nNow, let's analyze each freeway's car coverage at x=0 over time.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: y=1, one car: left-moving, h=12, τ=47, s=36.\n\nSpan at T: [12 - 36(T-5), 47 - 36(T-5)]\n\n0 is in span if 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT, where ΔT = T-5.\n\nSince 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 => 12 <= 36ΔT => ΔT >= 12/36 = 1/3, so since ΔT integer, ΔT >=1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so ΔT <=1\n\nThus, for ΔT=1, both: 12-36= -24 <=0, 47-36=11 >=0, yes 0 in [-24,11]\n\nFor ΔT=0, T=5: [12,47], 0 not in, since 0<12.\n\nΔT=2: [12-72,47-72] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=6 (ΔT=1), 0 is in the span, so unsafe at T=6.\n\nFor other T, safe.\n\nT=6: ΔT=1, span [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nT=5: [12,47], 0<12, not in.\n\nT=7: [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 is unsafe only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, one car (12,47,left,36), so same, unsafe only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3, three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6) but for right-moving, span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] with τ=-47, h=-36, s=6\n\nSo [ -47 + 6ΔT, -36 + 6ΔT ]\n\n0 in this if -47 +6ΔT <=0 <= -36 +6ΔT\n\nLeft: -47+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=47 => ΔT <=47/6≈7.833, so ΔT<=7\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +6ΔT => 36 <=6ΔT => ΔT >=6\n\nSo for ΔT=6,7\n\nΔT=6: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0<=0, yes in.\n\nΔT=7: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT=5: [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nΔT=8: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (42,31,right,6) h=42, τ=31, so for right-moving, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [31 +6ΔT, 42+6ΔT]\n\n0 in this? 31+6ΔT <=0 <=42+6ΔT? But 31+6ΔT >=31>0 for ΔT>=0, so left end >0, so 0 not in, always safe for this car.\n\nThird car: (6,-5,right,6) h=6, τ=-5, so [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-5 +6ΔT, 6 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -5+6ΔT <=0 <=6+6ΔT\n\nLeft: -5+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=5 => ΔT <=5/6<1, so for ΔT=0 only possible? ΔT integer, -5+6ΔT <=0 for ΔT<=0, but ΔT>=0, so for ΔT=0: -5<=0<=6, yes 0 in [-5,6]\n\nΔT=1: [-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nΔT=0: T=5, [ -5,6], 0 in it.\n\nFor freeway 3, at T=5, first car not covering 0, second not, third covering 0.\n\nAt T=6, first car: ΔT=1, [ -47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30], 0 not in\n\nSecond: [31+6,42+6]=[37,48], not\n\nThird: [-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], not, so safe at T=6\n\nAt T=7, first car: ΔT=2, [-47+12,-36+12]=[-35,-24], not\n\nSecond: [31+12,42+12]=[43,54], not\n\nThird: [-5+12,6+12]=[7,18], not, safe\n\nBut earlier at T=5, unsafe because of third car.\n\nNow for ΔT=6 and 7, first car covers, but let's see.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe when? From above, at T=5, unsafe (third car), at other times might be safe except when first car covers at high ΔT.\n\nBut for now, at T=5, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, for other turns.\n\nLet's list for each freeway and each T if unsafe.\n\nFirst, for freeway 3:\n\nCars:\n\nCar1: (right) span at T: [ -47 +6ΔT, -36 +6ΔT ], unsafe when 0 in, i.e. ΔT=6 or 7\n\nCar2: [31+6ΔT,42+6ΔT], always >0, safe\n\nCar3: [ -5 +6ΔT, 6 +6ΔT ], unsafe when 0 in, i.e. at ΔT=0 (T=5), since for ΔT=0, [-5,6] contains 0.\n\nFor ΔT=1, [1,12] not.\n\nSo overall freeway 3 unsafe at T=5 (car3), and at T=11 (ΔT=6) and T=12 (ΔT=7) for car1.\n\nΔT=6: T=5+6=11, car1 span [-47+36, -36+36]=[-11,0], contains 0\n\nT=12: [-47+42,-36+42]=[-5,6], contains 0\n\nT=5: unsafe from car3\n\nOther times safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3, so same unsafe times: T=5,11,12\n\nNow freeway 5: y=5, one car: (-36,-47,right,6) same as above car1, so span [ -47 +6ΔT, -36 +6ΔT ], unsafe at ΔT=6,7 i.e. T=11,12\n\nAt T=5: ΔT=0, [ -47, -36], 0 not in, safe? -47 to -36, both negative, 0 not in, so safe at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, for other ΔT except 6 and 7.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 same as freeway 5, each has one car like this, unsafe only at T=11 and T=12.\n\nNow freeway 1 and 2 we have, unsafe only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=6\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=6\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=5,11,12\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=5,11,12\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=11,12\n\nFreeway 6: same, T=11,12\n\nFreeway 7: same, T=11,12\n\nFreeway 8: same, T=11,12\n\nAnd for other times, safe.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t=5, y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=2 at turn 5.\n\nIf I move up immediately, to y=3 at next turn.\n\nBut at turn 5, I am on y=2.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nAt turn 5, I am on freeway 2.\n\nIs freeway 2 safe at T=5? From above, freeway 2 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=5, safe.\n\nThen I choose an action.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: if I go up every turn, from y=2 to y=9, need 7 up moves, so at turn 5+7=12, I reach y=9.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at some turn, and the actions are from turn t to t+H-1, so if I start at t=5, after H turns, I am at turn t=5+H-1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, I move to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, I need to arrive there at some turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=5 to t=5+H-1, so H actions, after which I am at turn 5+H, position y_{5+H}.\n\nAnd I need y_{5+H} =9.\n\nThe last action is at turn 5+H-1, which sets y_{5+H}.\n\nBut the position at turn 5+H is after the action.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of actions.\n\nIf I go up every turn, from y=2 at t=5, after one up, at t=6, y=3; t=7, y=4; ... up to t=12, y=9? Let's compute:\n\nt=5: y=2\n\na_5: U, then t=6, y=3\n\na_6: U, t=7, y=4\n\na_7: U, t=8, y=5\n\na_8: U, t=9, y=6\n\na_9: U, t=10, y=7\n\na_10: U, t=11, y=8\n\na_11: U, t=12, y=9\n\nSo with 7 actions, at t=12, y=9.\n\nNow, need to check for collision during the path.\n\nAt each turn t, when I am on y_t, must not collide.\n\nt=5: on y=2 (freeway 2), at T=5, freeway 2 safe, as above.\n\nt=6: on y=3 (freeway 3), at T=6.\n\nFreeway 3 at T=6: from earlier, safe, because at T=6, we have no car covering 0 for freeway 3? Earlier for freeway 3, unsafe at T=5,11,12. T=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=7: on y=4 (freeway 4), at T=7. Freeway 4 unsafe at T=5,11,12, so T=7 safe.\n\nt=8: on y=5 (freeway 5), at T=8. Freeway 5 unsafe only at T=11,12, so safe.\n\nt=9: on y=6 (freeway 6), at T=9, safe.\n\nt=10: on y=7 (freeway 7), at T=10, safe.\n\nt=11: on y=8 (freeway 8), at T=11.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=11? Yes, from above, freeway 8 has car, unsafe at T=11 and 12.\n\nAt T=11, on freeway 8, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo at t=11, I am on y=8, which is unsafe at T=11.\n\nThus, collision.\n\nCannot go directly up.\n\nNeed to avoid that.\n\nNow, T=11 and 12 are unsafe for freeways 5,6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all unsafe at T=11 and T=12.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 also unsafe at T=11,12, but we might not be there.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=11, we are on y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we need to delay or something.\n\nPerhaps stay at some point.\n\nSince freeways 1 and 2 are only unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at T=6, freeway 2 unsafe at T=6.\n\nBut at other times safe.\n\nFreeways 3 and 4 unsafe at T=5,11,12.\n\nT=5 is past, we are at t=5 now.\n\nt=5 is current turn, we start from here.\n\nAt t=5, we are on y=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 at T=5: safe, since unsafe only at T=6.\n\nBut we are at turn t=5, and we choose action for this turn.\n\nNow, if I stay at y=2 for turn t=5, then at t=5, I am on y=2, safe.\n\nThen I choose a_5.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at t=6, but at t=6, I would be on y=3.\n\nt=6, y=3, freeway 3 at T=6: safe, as before.\n\nBut later at t=11, problem.\n\nTo avoid being on freeways 5-8 at t=11 and t=12.\n\nSince I need to reach y=9, I can go slower or faster.\n\nMinimal H is 7 if no obstacles, but with obstacles, might be more.\n\nI could go up to y=4 or something and wait.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0: at bottom, no freeway, so always safe to be there.\n\nSimilarly y=9.\n\nBut we start from y=2.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe times:\n\nFor freeway 1: unsafe T=6\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe T=6\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe T=5,11,12\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe T=5,11,12\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe T=11,12\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe T=11,12\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe T=11,12\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe T=11,12\n\nT=5 is current, we are at y=2 at T=5, which is safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be on freeways 3 to 8 at some points.\n\nSince freeways 5-8 are unsafe at T=11,12, we should not be on them at those turns.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3-4 unsafe at T=11,12 as well.\n\nBut T=11 and 12 are late, so if we can reach y=9 before t=11, we avoid that.\n\nt=11 is turn 11.\n\nFrom start, at t=5, if we move fast.\n\nMinimal time to y=9: from y=2 to y=9, need 7 moves, so earliest at t=12, as before.\n\nt=5: y=2\n\nAfter 1 move: t=6, y=3\n\n...\n\nAfter 7 moves: t=12, y=9\n\nSo we cannot reach before t=12.\n\nt=12 is when we arrive at y=9.\n\nAt t=11, we are at y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nSince we cannot arrive before t=12, we must be at y=8 at t=11, which is unsafe.\n\nUnless we are not on y=8 at t=11.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=12, we must be at y=8 at t=11, and move up.\n\nIf at t=11 we are at y=8 and move up, at t=11 we are on y=8, which collides if unsafe.\n\nThen at t=12, we are at y=9, safe.\n\nBut collision at t=11.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on freeway 8 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, we could be on a different y at t=11.\n\nFor example, if we delay our movement.\n\nSuppose we stay at lower y longer.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 or something, but that might take more turns.\n\nSince freeways 1 and 2 are only unsafe at T=6, and safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3 and 4 are safe except at T=5,11,12.\n\nT=5 is past, so for t>=6, freeways 3 and 4 are safe except at t=11,12.\n\nSimilarly for 5-8, safe except t=11,12.\n\nNow, t=11 and 12 are the critical points.\n\nTo avoid being on freeways 1-8 at t=11 and 12? But we need to be on some y.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, so if we can be at y=0 or y=9 at t=11 and t=12, we avoid collision.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, so if we reach y=9 before t=11, then at t=11 we are at y=9, safe.\n\nBut we cannot reach before t=12 as min.\n\nt=12 is the earliest to arrive at y=9.\n\nAt t=12, we are at y=9, safe, but at t=11, we are at y=8, unsafe.\n\nUnless we reach y=9 earlier, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at t=11, but how? From y=2 at t=5, to y=9 at t=11, that would require moving up 7 times in 6 turns? From t=5 to t=11, there are 6 actions: t=5,6,7,8,9,10 actions, leading to t=6 to t=11 positions.\n\nLet's see the turns.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position at t+1? No.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is y_t.\n\nThen choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo the position y_t is for turn t.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, we need y_T =9.\n\nFor T=11, y_11=9.\n\nFrom y_5=2, we need to increase y by 7 in 6 steps? From t=5 to t=11, there are 6 intervals, 6 actions.\n\nActions from t=5 to t=10, 6 actions, determine y_6 to y_11.\n\ny_5 is given, y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5, ..., y_11 = y_10 + Δy_10.\n\nTo have y_11=9, with y_5=2, so the sum of Δy from t=5 to t=10 must be +7.\n\nEach Δy is +1,0,-1, so to have net +7 in 6 moves, possible, for example, 7 up and one down or something, but net +7 in 6 moves means at least one stay or down, but then we need more moves, no.\n\nNet change: y_11 - y_5 = sum_{k=5}^{10} Δy_k = +7\n\nEach |Δy_k| <=1, so to have sum +7 in 6 terms, each <=1, so must be all +1 except one +0 or something, but +7 with 6 terms, each <=1, so possible only if all +1 and one extra, but each Δy <=1, so maximum sum is 6 if all +1, which gives y_11 = y_5 +6 = 2+6=8, which is less than 9.\n\ny_5=2, after 6 actions (t=5 to t=10), we have y_11.\n\nIf all actions U, y_11 = y_5 +6 =8.\n\nThen to reach y=9, we need one more action, at t=11, U, to y_12=9.\n\nSo indeed, earliest to reach y=9 is at t=12, with y_12=9.\n\nCannot be at y=9 at t=11 or earlier.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, we must be at y=8 if we go directly, but we might be elsewhere.\n\nAt t=11, we can be at y=7 or something if we moved slower.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, to avoid collision at t=11, we must not be on freeways 1-8 at t=11, meaning we must be at y=0 or y=9 at turn t=11.\n\nSimilarly for t=12, but at t=12 we can be at y=9.\n\nBut at t=11, if we are at y=0, that might be possible, but y=0 is far.\n\ny=0 at t=11.\n\nThen from there go to y=9.\n\nBut that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, from y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 moves, but we are at y=2 at t=5, so if we go down to y=0, then up, it takes more time.\n\nBut we want minimal H.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at t=12, but at t=11, be at a safe y, not on freeway.\n\nThe only safe y at t=11 are y=0 and y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not possible at t=11, so only y=0.\n\nSo if we are at y=0 at t=11, then safe.\n\nThen from y=0, we can go up to y=9 in 9 moves, but that would be slow.\n\nBut at t=11, y=0, then after actions, we reach y=9 later.\n\nBut H would be larger.\n\nPerhaps not at t=11, but we need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at the critical times.\n\nSince freeways 5-8 are only unsafe at t=11 and 12, if we can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, if we pass through freeway 8 before t=11 or after t=12.\n\nBut after t=12, we are at y=9, so no need.\n\nBefore t=11, we can be on freeway 8.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor instance, freeway 8 unsafe at t=11,12, so safe at t=10, for example.\n\nLet's list the safe times for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: safe except t=6\n\nFreeway 2: safe except t=6\n\nFreeway 3: safe except t=5,11,12\n\nBut t=5 is past, so for future, safe except t=11,12\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: safe except t=11,12\n\nFreeway 5: safe except t=11,12\n\nFreeway 6: safe except t=11,12\n\nFreeway 7: safe except t=11,12\n\nFreeway 8: safe except t=11,12\n\nAnd for all, at t=6, freeway 1 and 2 unsafe, but 3-8 safe at t=6.\n\nNow, we are at y=2 at t=5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince freeways 3-8 are all unsafe at t=11 and t=12, we must not be on any of them at those turns.\n\nTherefore, at t=11 and t=12, we must be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not possible at t=11, as established.\n\nSo at t=11, we must be at y=0.\n\nThen at t=12, we can be at y=1 or something, but we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut at t=12, if we are on freeway, it might be unsafe.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nFirst, at t=11, we must be at y=0.\n\nNow, from t=5, y=2, to t=11, y=0.\n\nThat means in 6 turns (t=5 to t=10 actions), we need to go from y=2 to y=0, so net change -2.\n\nEach action can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nSo from t=5 to t=11, 6 actions: a5 to a10, determining y6 to y11.\n\ny11 = y5 + sum_{k=5}^{10} Δy_k\n\ny5=2, y11=0, so sum Δy from k=5 to10 must be -2.\n\nThen after that, from y=0 at t=11, we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 up moves, so at least 9 actions.\n\nBut we can start from t=11.\n\nAt t=11, we are at y=0, choose action, then y12, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nBut H will be large.\n\nFor example, to go from y=2 to y=0 in 6 moves with net -2, we can do, say, 2 down, 4 stay, or something, but we can do it faster, but not necessary.\n\nThen from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves, so total actions from t=5 to t=11+9-1 = t=19, H=15 actions or something.\n\nBut this is not minimal, since we can reach earlier if we don't go down.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=9 at t=12, but avoid being on unsafe freeway at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, instead of being on y=8, we could be on y=9 if possible, but not.\n\nOr on y=7, for example, if we moved slower.\n\nBut if at t=11 we are on y=7, freeway 7, which is unsafe at t=11, still collision.\n\nSimilarly, any y from 1 to 8 is unsafe at t=11, because all freeways are unsafe at t=11 and t=12.\n\nFreeways 1 and 2 are safe at t=11, except that freeway 1 and 2 are only unsafe at t=6, so at t=11, they are safe.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe only t=6, so at t=11, safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 safe at t=11.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 unsafe at t=11,12, so not safe.\n\nFreeway 5-8 unsafe at t=11,12.\n\nSo at t=11, only freeway 1 and 2 are safe, and y=0, y=9.\n\nSimilarly at t=12, freeway 1 and 2 safe, y=0, y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is safe.\n\nSo at t=11, we can be on freeway 1 or 2 or y=0.\n\nSimilarly for t=12.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at t=12, we need to be at y=8 at t=11 and move up.\n\nBut at t=11, if we are on y=8, freeway 8, unsafe.\n\nIf we are on freeway 1 or 2 at t=11, then to reach y=9 at t=12, we need to move up multiple times, impossible in one step.\n\nFrom y, we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nSo if at t=11 we are at y=2, for example, then at t=12 we can be at y=3, not 9.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nSo the only way to be at y=9 at t=12 is to be at y=8 at t=11 and move up.\n\nBut y=8 at t=11 is unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=9 at t=11, impossible.\n\nSo we must reach y=9 after t=12.\n\nFor example, at t=13 or later.\n\nBut then H larger.\n\nSince at t=11 and 12, we can be on freeway 1 or 2, which are safe.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is only 7 steps from y=2, but with delay.\n\nLet's think.\n\nSuppose we want to be at y=9 at some turn after t=12.\n\nFor example, at t=13.\n\nThen at t=12, we must be at y=8 or y=9, but y=9 not yet, so y=8.\n\nBut at t=12, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, we need to be at y=7 or 8 or 9 for the path to y=9 at t=13.\n\nBut at t=11, if on y=7 or 8, unsafe.\n\nIf on y=9 at t=11, impossible.\n\nSo at t=11, we can be on y=1 or 2, safe.\n\nSay at t=11, we are at y=2.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at t=13, we need to go from y=2 to y=9 in 2 steps, impossible, max to y=4.\n\ny11=2, y12 = y11 + Δy11, y13 = y12 + Δy12.\n\nTo have y13=9, need y12=8 or 9, but y12=9 impossible from y11=2, so y12=8, then y13=9.\n\nBut to have y12=8 from y11=2, impossible in one step.\n\nΔy11 <=1, so from y11=2, y12 <=3.\n\nThen y13 <=4, not 9.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 at t=13 from y=2 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, from any y at t=11, we can reach at most y+2 at t=13.\n\nSince y<=2 at t=11 (freeway 1 or 2 or 0), so at t=13, y<=4, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need more turns.\n\nFor example, if at t=11, we are at y=2, then after k up moves, at turn t=11+k, y=2+k.\n\nSet 2+k=9, k=7, so at t=11+7=18, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=1, t=19, etc.\n\nBut this is late.\n\nWe can be at higher y earlier, but not at t=11.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=4 quickly, then stay or something until after t=12.\n\nLet's list the safe times again.\n\nFreeways 3-8 are safe for t=6 to t=10, for example.\n\nt=6 to t=10 are safe for all freeways except that freeway 1 and 2 are unsafe at t=6.\n\nBut for freeways 3-8, at t=6: safe, t=7 safe, t=8 safe, t=9 safe, t=10 safe, then unsafe at t=11,12.\n\nThen after t=12, safe again, but we want to reach before if possible.\n\nSince we can reach at t=12 but with collision at t=11, we need to pass through the upper freeways before t=11.\n\nFor example, be on freeway 8 at t=10 or earlier.\n\nThen at t=10, be on y=8, safe, then at t=10, move up to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, we are at y=9, safe.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt t=10, we can be on y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt t=10, T=10, freeway 8: unsafe at T=11,12, so at T=10, safe, as earlier.\n\nThen at turn t=10, we are on y=8, safe.\n\nThen we choose a_t=10 = U, so y11 = 8 +1 =9.\n\nThen at turn t=11, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12, we are still at y=9 or move, but we have reached.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=8 at t=10.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=5, to y=8 at t=10.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=5 to t=10, 5 actions (t=5 to t=9) determine y6 to y10.\n\ny10 = y5 + sum_{k=5}^{9} Δy_k = 2 + sum_{k=5}^9 Δy_k\n\nSet y10=8, so sum Δy from k=5 to9 must be +6.\n\nWith 5 actions, each Δy <=1, so max sum +5, so y10 <= 2+5=7, cannot reach y=8 at t=10.\n\ny5=2, after action a5, y6 = y5 + Δy5\n\nAfter a6, y7, ..., after a9, y10.\n\nSo 5 actions, from y6 to y10.\n\ny10 = y5 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\nSo sum of 5 Δy terms.\n\nEach |Δy|<=1, so y10 <= 2+5=7, or y10 >=2-5=-3.\n\nSo maximum y10=7 if all U.\n\nThus at t=10, we can be at y=7 at best.\n\nThen at t=10, on y=7, freeway 7, safe at T=10.\n\nThen we can move up to y=8 at t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at T=11, collision.\n\nIf we move up at t=10 to y=8, but y10=7, a10=U, y11=8.\n\nAt t=11, on y=8, unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=10, if we stay, y11=7, still on freeway 7, unsafe at t=11.\n\nIf we move down, worse.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, be on y=8.\n\nThen from y=2 at t=5 to y=8 at t=9.\n\n4 actions: a5 to a8, y6 to y9.\n\ny9 = y5 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8\n\nSet y9=8, so sum of 4 Δy from k=5 to8 must be +6.\n\nBut each <=1, sum <=4, so y9 <=2+4=6, cannot be 8.\n\nImpossible.\n\ny8: at t=8, y8.\n\nFrom y5=2, to y8 at t=8.\n\n3 actions: a5,a6,a7 determine y6,y7,y8.\n\ny8 = y5 + Δy5 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\nSet y8=8, sum 3 Δy = +6, impossible, max +3, y8<=5.\n\nSimilarly, earlier not possible.\n\nSo the earliest we can be on y=8 is at t=12 if we go directly, but at t=11 we are on y=8.\n\nBut we can be on y=8 at t=10 only if we start from higher, but we start from y=2.\n\nMinimal turn to reach y=8: from y=2, need 6 up moves, so at t=11, y=8 if all up from t=5.\n\nt=5: y=2\n\na5=U, t=6 y=3\n\na6=U, t=7 y=4\n\na7=U, t=8 y=5\n\na8=U, t=9 y=6\n\na9=U, t=10 y=7\n\na10=U, t=11 y=8\n\nSo at t=11, y=8.\n\nWe can reach y=8 at t=11, but it is unsafe.\n\nTo be at y=8 before t=11, we need more up moves in fewer turns, impossible.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 before t=11.\n\nSimilarly for y=7: can be at t=10, y=7, as above.\n\nAt t=10, y=7, safe, but then at t=11, if we move to y=8, unsafe, or stay at y=7, unsafe at t=11.\n\nSo no good.\n\nPerhaps go to y=9 via a different path, but only vertical move.\n\nAnother idea: at t=11, be at y=1 or 2, safe, then after t=12, when freeways are safe again, go up.\n\nBut freeways are safe after t=12.\n\nFor example, at t=12, freeways 3-8 are unsafe, but freeway 1 and 2 safe, and y=0,9.\n\nAt t=12, we can be on freeway 1 or 2 or y=9.\n\nBut if we are at y=2 at t=11, then at t=12, we can be at y=3, on freeway 3, which is unsafe at t=12.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways 3-8 unsafe at t=12.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 safe at t=12.\n\nSo at t=12, we can be on freeway 1 or 2 or y=0 or y=9.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=2 at t=12, it takes 7 moves, at t=19.\n\nLate.\n\nBut let's calculate minimal H.\n\nSince we must avoid being on freeways 3-8 at t=11 and t=12, and freeways 1-2 are safe there, we can stay on freeway 1 or 2 during t=11 and t=12.\n\nFor example, at t=10, be on y=2, then at t=10, choose S, so y11=2, on freeway 2 at t=11, safe.\n\nThen at t=11, choose S, y12=2, on freeway 2 at t=12, safe.\n\nThen after t=12, go up to y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=12, to y=9 at t=12+7=19.\n\nActions from t=5 to t=18, 14 actions.\n\nBut we can be at higher y at t=10.\n\nFor example, at t=10, we can be at y=7, as max.\n\nThen at t=10, on y=7, freeway 7, safe at T=10.\n\nBut at t=10, we need to move to a safe position for t=11.\n\nIf we move down to y=6, then at t=11, on y=6, freeway 6, unsafe.\n\nOr stay, y=7, unsafe.\n\nOr move up to y=8, at t=11 on y=8, unsafe.\n\nNo way to avoid from y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=6 at t=10, same thing.\n\nBut at t=10, if we are on a lower freeway, like y=1 or 2, we can stay.\n\nSo to be safe at t=11 and t=12, we must be on y=1 or 2 at those turns.\n\nSo let's plan to be at y=2 at t=11 and t=12.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=5, to y=2 at t=11, net change 0 in 6 actions.\n\nSo we can do, for example, stay at y=2 for some turns.\n\nThen after t=12, go up to y=9.\n\nBut let's see if we can be at higher y before t=11.\n\nFor example, go up to y=8 as fast as possible, but we can only reach y=7 at t=10, as above.\n\nAt t=10, y=7, but we can't stay there for t=11.\n\nSo we need to move down to y=2 or 1 before t=11.\n\nFor example, from y=7 at t=10, we can move down to y=6 at t=11, but y=6 unsafe at t=11.\n\nOr move down multiple steps, but in one step, from y=7 to y=6 at t=11, unsafe.\n\nTo reach y=2 at t=11 from y=7 at t=10, impossible in one step.\n\nΔy10 = -1,0,1, so from y10=7, y11=6,7, or 8.\n\nAll not 2.\n\nSo we cannot jump down.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=2 at t=11, we must be at y=2 at t=10 or t=11 with small change.\n\nSpecifically, at t=10, we must be at y=1,2, or 3 to reach y=2 at t=11.\n\nIf y10=2, a10=S, y11=2\n\nIf y10=1, a10=U, y11=2\n\nIf y10=3, a10=D, y11=2\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nBut at t=10, if we are at y=3, freeway 3, at T=10: is it safe?\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe at T=11,12, but T=10 safe, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 or 2 at t=10 safe.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 safe at t=10, since unsafe only t=6.\n\nFreeway 3 safe at t=10.\n\nSo possible.\n\nThen we can choose to be at y=2 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly for t=12.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should be as high as possible before t=11.\n\nSo let's go up as fast as possible to some y, then move down to y=2 for t=11 and t=12, then go up after.\n\nBut moving down might not be efficient.\n\nSince we have to spend time at low y, better to stay low from the beginning and move up after t=12.\n\nBut let's calculate the minimal H.\n\nFirst, from t=5 to t=10, we can move up to y=7 at t=10.\n\ny5=2, all U: t=6 y=3, t=7 y=4, t=8 y=5, t=9 y=6, t=10 y=7.\n\nAt t=10, y=7.\n\nThen from here, we need to get to y=2 at t=11.\n\nBut from y=7, to y=2 in one step impossible.\n\nWe need to start moving down earlier.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point we move down.\n\nBut that seems wasteful.\n\nPerhaps at t=10, we are at y=3 or something.\n\nLet's define the path.\n\nWe need to be at y=2 at t=11 for safety.\n\ny11=2.\n\nFrom y5=2, so from t=5 to t=11, net change 0.\n\nActions a5 to a10, 6 actions, sum Δy =0.\n\nThen from t=11, y=2, go to y=9, need 7 up moves, so at t=18, y=9.\n\nActions from t=11 to t=17, 7 actions.\n\nTotal actions from t=5 to t=17, 13 actions.\n\nH=13.\n\nBut we can be at higher y at t=10.\n\nFor example, go up to y=6 at t=9, then move down to y=2 at t=11.\n\nt=5: y=2\n\na5=U, t=6 y=3\n\na6=U, t=7 y=4\n\na7=U, t=8 y=5\n\na8=U, t=9 y=6\n\nNow at t=9, y=6, freeway 6, safe at T=9.\n\nThen we need to get to y=2 at t=11.\n\nFrom t=9 to t=11, two actions.\n\na9 and a10.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9 =6 + Δy9\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy10\n\nSet y11=2.\n\nSo 6 + Δy9 + Δy10 =2, so Δy9 + Δy10 = -4\n\nBut each Δy >= -1, so sum >= -2, cannot be -4.\n\nImpossible.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=9, in two actions, we can reach at best y=4 at t=11, if both down: a9=D, y10=5; a10=D, y11=4.\n\nOr y=5 at t=11 if one down one stay, etc.\n\nCannot reach y=2.\n\nTo reach y=2 at t=11 from t=5, we must not go too high.\n\nFor example, if we stay at low y.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=2 until t=10 or something.\n\nBut let's list possible.\n\ny5=2\n\nWe need y11=2.\n\nSo for turns t=6 to t=10, we can move around, but y11=2.\n\nThe position at t=6 to t=10 can be different.\n\nBut we need to avoid collision at each turn.\n\nFor example, at t=6, if we are on y=2, freeway 2, unsafe at T=6.\n\nAt t=6, freeway 2 is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=2 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=1 at t=6, freeway 1 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=6, we must not be on freeway 1 or 2, so must be on y=3 to 8 or 0,9.\n\nBut y=0 or 9 far.\n\nSo probably on y=3 or higher.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, we are on y=2, safe.\n\nWe choose a5.\n\nIf we go up, to y=3 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, on y=3, freeway 3, at T=6, safe, as earlier.\n\nThen we can stay or move.\n\nBut we need to be at y=2 at t=11.\n\nSo let's outline a path.\n\nStart t=5, y=2, safe.\n\nChoose a5=U, so y6=3.\n\nt=6, on y=3, freeway 3, T=6 safe.\n\nChoose a6=U, y7=4.\n\nt=7, y=4, freeway 4, T=7 safe.\n\na7=U, y8=5, t=8, y=5, freeway 5, T=8 safe.\n\na8=U, y9=6, t=9, y=6, freeway 6, T=9 safe.\n\na9=U, y10=7, t=10, y=7, freeway 7, T=10 safe.\n\nNow at t=10, y=7.\n\nWe need y11=2.\n\nBut from y=7, to y=2, need at least 5 down moves, but only one action to t=11, impossible.\n\nSo we must have lower y at t=10.\n\nFor example, at t=10, be at y=3.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom t=5, we can move slower or down.\n\nFor example, t=5: y=2, a5=S, y6=2, but at t=6, on y=2, unsafe! Cannot.\n\nAt t=6, must not be on y=2.\n\nSo a5 cannot be S or D, must be U to go to y=3.\n\nSimilarly, a5=U, y6=3.\n\nThen at t=6, on y=3, safe.\n\nNow, we can choose to go down or stay or up.\n\nBut to be at y=2 at t=11, we need to decrease later.\n\nFor example, a6=S, y7=3\n\na7=S, y8=3\n\na8=S, y9=3\n\na9=S, y10=3\n\nThen at t=10, y=3, freeway 3, safe at T=10.\n\nThen a10=D, y11=2\n\nAt t=11, on y=2, freeway 2, safe at T=11.\n\nThen we can stay or move.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAt t=11, y=2.\n\nThen we can start going up.\n\nBut at t=12, we can be on y=2 or 3.\n\nIf on y=3, freeway 3 unsafe at t=12.\n\nSo at t=12, we should not be on freeway 3-8, so on y=1,2 or 0,9.\n\nSo at t=12, we can be on y=2.\n\nChoose a11=S, y12=2, on freeway 2 at t=12, safe.\n\nThen after t=12, go up.\n\nFor example, from t=12, y=2, go up to y=9 in 7 moves, at t=19.\n\nBut H is large.\n\nTo save time, from t=11, y=2, we can go up, but at t=12, if we go to y=3, on freeway 3, unsafe at t=12.\n\nSo we must stay on low y until after t=12.\n\nSo at t=12, be on y=1 or 2.\n\nThen after, go up.\n\nFor example, at t=11, y=2, a11=S, y12=2.\n\nThen a12=U, y13=3, and so on.\n\nBut freeways are safe after t=12.\n\nAt t=13, freeway 3 is safe, since unsafe only at t=11,12, so at t=13 safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo from t=12, y=2, we can go up directly to y=9.\n\nActions:\n\nt=12: y=2, a12=U, y13=3\n\nt=13: y=3, a13=U, y14=4\n\n...\n\nup to a18=U, y19=9\n\nBut at t=19, y=9.\n\nNow, from start, we have from t=5 to t=11 at y=2 except we moved to y=3 at t=6 and stayed.\n\nIn the path above, we were at y=3 from t=6 to t=10, then down to y=2 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=12, y=2.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut we can optimize the first part.\n\nSince we need to be at y=2 at t=11, and at t=5 y=2, we can stay at y=2 from t=5 to t=10 except at t=6 we must not be on y=2.\n\nSo at t=5, we must move to y=3 at t=6.\n\nThen from t=6 to t=10, we can be at y=3, then at t=10, move down to y=2 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11, y=2.\n\nFor t=12, we can stay at y=2 or move.\n\nBut to reach faster, at t=11, we can move up to y=3 at t=12, but at t=12, y=3, freeway 3 unsafe, so cannot.\n\nSo must stay at y=2 at t=12 or go to y=1.\n\nSay stay at y=2 for t=12.\n\nThen from t=13, start going up.\n\nSo let's write the sequence.\n\nStart t=5, y=2\n\na5 = U  (to avoid t=6 on y=2)\n\ny6=3\n\nt=6, on y=3, safe\n\na6 = S  (stay at y=3)\n\ny7=3\n\nt=7, y=3, safe\n\na7 = S\n\ny8=3\n\nt=8, y=3, safe\n\na8 = S\n\ny9=3\n\nt=9, y=3, safe\n\na9 = S\n\ny10=3\n\nt=10, y=3, safe\n\na10 = D  (move down to y=2 for t=11)\n\ny11=2\n\nt=11, on y=2, safe\n\na11 = S  (stay for t=12)\n\ny12=2\n\nt=12, on y=2, safe\n\nNow, from here, go up to y=9.\n\na12 = U, y13=3\n\nt=13, y=3, freeway 3, now safe since t=13>12\n\na13 = U, y14=4\n\na14 = U, y15=5\n\na15 = U, y16=6\n\na16 = U, y17=7\n\na17 = U, y18=8\n\na18 = U, y19=9\n\nSo at t=19, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=5 to t=18, that's 14 actions? Turns from t=5 to t=18 inclusive for actions? Let's list the action turns.\n\nActions at t=5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18\n\nThat's 14 actions.\n\nH=14, and we reach at turn t=19.\n\nBut we can reduce by not staying so long at y=3.\n\nIn the first part, from t=6 to t=10, we stayed at y=3, but we could have gone higher and come down, but coming down takes time, probably not better.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=6, y=3, we go up to y=4 at t=7, etc., but then to come down to y=2 at t=11, we need more down moves, which might take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=7 at t=10, then to reach y=2 at t=11, impossible.\n\nSo staying at y=3 is fine.\n\nAt t=11 and t=12, we stayed at y=2, but after t=12, freeways are safe, so at t=12, we can move up to y=3 at t=13, but at t=12, if we move up, y13=3, but at t=12, we are on y=2 or wherever.\n\nIn the above, at t=12, we are on y=2, and we do a12=S or U.\n\nIf we do a12=U, then y13=3, at t=13 on y=3.\n\nBut at t=12, we are on y=2, safe.\n\nBut if we do a12=U at t=12, then at t=12, we are on y=2, choose U, so y13=3.\n\nThen at t=13, on y=3.\n\nBut we can do that to save one turn.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, we are at y=2, we can move up at t=11 to y=3, but at t=12, y=3 is unsafe.\n\nNo, because at t=12, freeway 3 unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be on y=3 at t=12.\n\nSo at t=12, we must be on y=1,2,0,9.\n\nSo on y=2.\n\nThus, at t=11, if we are at y=2, we must choose a11 such that y12=2, so a11=S or if y11=1, a11=U, but we are at y11=2, so a11=S to stay.\n\nCannot move up at t=11.\n\nSo in the path above, it's correct.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier in the first part.\n\nFor example, from t=6 to t=9, go up to y=6, then move down to y=2 for t=11.\n\nBut from y=6 at t=9 to y=2 at t=11.\n\nTwo actions: a9 and a10.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy10\n\ny9=6, y11=2, so 6 + Δy9 + Δy10 =2, so Δy9 + Δy10 = -4, impossible since each >= -1.\n\nSo with two actions, min y11=4 if both down.\n\nSo we can be at y=4 at t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, y=4, freeway 4, unsafe at T=11.\n\nNot good.\n\nWith three actions, from t=8 to t=10.\n\nSuppose at t=8, y=5, for example.\n\nThen a8, a9, a10 to set y11.\n\ny8=5, y11=2, so 5 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10 =2, so Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10 = -3, possible, e.g. all D.\n\nThen y11=2.\n\nBut we need to be at safe positions during.\n\nFor example, start t=5, a5=U, y6=3\n\na6=U, y7=4\n\na7=U, y8=5\n\nt=8, y=5, safe\n\na8=D, y9=4\n\nt=9, y=4, freeway 4, safe at T=9\n\na9=D, y10=3\n\nt=10, y=3, safe\n\na10=D, y11=2\n\nt=11, y=2, safe\n\nThen a11=S, y12=2\n\nt=12, safe\n\nThen go up: a12=U, y13=3\n\netc, same as before, but we reached y=5 and came down, so we used extra actions, but the number of actions to reach y=9 is the same, since we still start from y=2 at t=12.\n\nIn this case, from t=12 y=2 to t=19 y=9, 7 actions, plus from t=5 to t=11, 7 actions (a5 to a11), total 14 actions same as before.\n\nIn the first path, we had a5 to a10 and a11 to a18, 14 actions.\n\nHere also.\n\nBut in this path, we were at higher y briefly, but not necessary.\n\nTo save time, we can at t=12 go up immediately.\n\nBut we have to wait until after t=12.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=12, we can be on y=2, and freeways are safe after, we can go up from t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, if we go up, y13=3, but at t=12, we are on y=2, safe.\n\nThen to reach y=9 faster, but it still takes 7 up moves from y=2.\n\nMinimal is 7 moves from whatever y we start after t=12.\n\nBut we start from y=2 at t=12.\n\nIf we can be at higher y at t=12, but at t=12, we can only be on y=1 or 2, since freeways 3-8 unsafe.\n\nSo y<=2 at t=12.\n\nThus, minimal H is 14, as above.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a shorter way.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at t=13.\n\nThen at t=12, we must be at y=8 or 9.\n\nIf y=9, not possible.\n\ny=8 at t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, y=8, freeway 8, unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf at t=13, y=9, then at t=12, y=8 or 9.\n\ny=8 at t=12, unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to reach at t=13.\n\nSimilarly for t=14: at t=13, must be at y=8 or 9.\n\nIf y=8 at t=13, freeway 8, safe after t=12, so safe.\n\nThen possible.\n\nFor example, at t=13, y=8, then a13=U, y14=9.\n\nBut we need to be at y=8 at t=13.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=5 to y=8 at t=13.\n\n8 turns, 8 actions from a5 to a12.\n\ny13 = y5 + sum_{k=5}^{12} Δy_k = 2 + sum of 8 Δy\n\nSet y13=8, so sum Δy = +6.\n\nWith 8 actions, possible, for example, 6 up, 2 stay, or 7 up 1 down, etc.\n\nBut we need to avoid collision at t=11 and t=12.\n\nAt t=11 and t=12, we must not be on freeways 3-8.\n\nSo at t=11, be on y=0,1,2,9\n\nSimilarly t=12.\n\nNow, to reach y=8 at t=13, we can be at y=7 at t=12, then move up.\n\nBut at t=12, y=7, freeway 7, unsafe.\n\nOr at t=12, be on y=2, then move to y=8 in one step impossible.\n\nSo to be at y=8 at t=13, we must be at y=7 or 8 at t=12.\n\nIf at y=8 at t=12, unsafe.\n\nIf at y=7 at t=12, unsafe.\n\nSo collision at t=12.\n\nIf we are at y=7 at t=12, unsafe.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at low y at t=11 and t=12, then go up after.\n\nThus minimal H is 14.\n\nBut in the path, we can start going up immediately after t=12.\n\nIn the sequence I had, we go up from t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, we are at y=2, and we do a12=U at turn t=12, so y13=3.\n\nThen no issue.\n\nNow, to output the actions.\n\nIn the first part, we have to handle t=6.\n\nAt t=5, we are at y=2, must move up to avoid t=6 on y=2.\n\nThen we can stay at y=3 until t=10, then down to y=2 at t=11.\n\nThen stay at t=11 for t=12.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut at t=10, we move down, so at t=10, we are on y=3, safe, choose D, so y11=2.\n\nThen at t=11, on y=2, choose S, y12=2.\n\nThen a12=U, y13=3, etc.\n\nSince after t=12, all freeways safe, we can go up directly.\n\nNow, the number of turns: from t=5 to t=18 actions, 14 actions.\n\nBut let's list the action sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t=5, position (0,2)\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1 =5: a5\n\nSince we need to move up to avoid t=6.\n\nSo a5 = U\n\nThen turn 6: at y=3, we can choose S or U or D, but to save time, perhaps S.\n\nIn the minimal path, we can go up further, but then we have to come down, which may not save time.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=3, a6=U, y7=4\n\na7=U, y8=5\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\nNow at t=10, y=7\n\nThen we need to get to y=2 at t=11, impossible.\n\nSo we must not go above y=3 in the first part if we want to reach y=2 at t=11 with few actions.\n\nFrom t=5 to t=11, with y11=2, y5=2, net 0, so we can have various paths, but the position at t=6 to t=10 must be safe.\n\nAt t=6, must not be on y=1 or 2, so y>=3.\n\nSimilarly, other times safe as long as not on unsafe freeway at that turn.\n\nFor example, at t=7, freeway 4 safe, etc.\n\nSo we can be at y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at various times, as long as at t=11, y=2.\n\nBut to have y=2 at t=11, with y5=2, the sum of Δy from t=5 to t=10 must be 0.\n\nActions a5 to a10 determine y6 to y11.\n\ny11 = y5 + Δy5 + ... + Δy10\n\n6 terms: Δy5 to Δy10\n\ny11 =2, y5=2, so sum_{k=5}^{10} Δy_k =0\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,1.\n\nAlso, at t=6, y6 must be >=3.\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5\n\nSince y5=2, and y6>=3, so Δy5 >=1, so Δy5=1, a5=U, y6=3.\n\nThen y6=3.\n\nNow, sum Δy5 to Δy10 =0, with Δy5=1, so sum_{k=6}^{10} Δy_k = -1\n\ny11 = y5 + Δy5 + ... + Δy10 =2 +1 + (Δy6 + ... + Δy10) =2+1 + S, where S= sum_{k=6}^{10} Δy_k\n\ny11=2, so 3 + S =2, so S= -1.\n\nSo sum of Δy6 to Δy10 = -1.\n\nEach between -1 and 1.\n\nNow, positions: at t=6, y=3\n\nThen we can choose actions.\n\nFor example, all stay except one down: but 5 actions, sum to -1.\n\nFor instance, four stay, one down: S,S,S,S,D for a6 to a10.\n\nThen y7=y6 + Δy6=3+0=3\n\ny8=3+0=3\n\ny9=3+0=3\n\ny10=3+ (-1) =2? a10=D, y11= y10 + Δy10, let's see.\n\nAfter a6, y7= y6 + Δy6\n\nIf a6=S, Δy6=0, y7=3\n\na7=S, y8=3\n\na8=S, y9=3\n\na9=S, y10=3\n\nThen a10=D, Δy10= -1, y11= y10 + Δy10=3-1=2\n\nYes.\n\nAt t=10, y=3, which is safe.\n\nThen a10=D, y11=2.\n\nSimilarly, other combinations.\n\nBut in this case, we have fewer moves, but the time to reach y=9 is the same because we start from y=2 at t=11.\n\nAfter t=12, we go up.\n\nBut at t=11, we are at y=2, then for t=12, we need to be at safe y, so a11=S, y12=2.\n\nThen from t=12, go up.\n\nSo actions: a5=U\n\na6=S\n\na7=S\n\na8=S\n\na9=S\n\na10=D  (to y11=2)\n\na11=S  (y12=2)\n\na12=U  (y13=3)\n\na13=U  (y14=4)\n\na14=U  (y15=5)\n\na15=U  (y16=6)\n\na16=U  (y17=7)\n\na17=U  (y18=8)\n\na18=U  (y19=9)\n\nActions from t=5 to t=18, 14 actions.\n\nWe can reduce by one if we can start going up at t=11, but at t=11, if we do a11=U, then y12=3, but at t=12, on y=3, unsafe, collision.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 14.\n\nBut in the sequence, a10=D, which is down, but it works.\n\nSince we have to be at y=2 at t=11, and we were at y=3, we move down.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car at freeway 3.\n\nIn this path, at t=6 to t=9, we are on y=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt t=6, T=6, freeway 3 safe, as earlier.\n\nt=7, T=7, safe, etc.\n\nAt t=10, y=3, T=10, safe.\n\nThen a10=D, to y11=2.\n\nAt t=11, y=2, safe.\n\na11=S, y12=2.\n\nThen up.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach (0,9), which is at t=19.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t=5 to t=18 for H=14 actions.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAfter a18=U, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nNow, is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose we go to y=4 or something, but then to come down to y=2 at t=11, it takes down moves, which don't help.\n\nFor example, if at t=6, a6=U, y7=4\n\nThen to have sum S= -1 for Δy6 to Δy10.\n\ny6=3, then y11 = y6 + Δy6 + ... + Δy10 =3 + S, and y11=2, so 3+S=2, S= -1.\n\nIf y7=4, then Δy6= +1 (since y7= y6 + Δy6=3 +1=4)\n\nThen S = Δy6 + ... + Δy10 = +1 + sum_{k=7}^{10} Δy_k\n\nSet S= -1, so +1 + T = -1, T= -2, where T= sum_{k=7}^{10} Δy_k\n\n4 actions, sum to -2, possible, e.g. two down, two stay.\n\nThen y11=2.\n\nBut we used extra up and down, no gain.\n\nSimilarly, the time to reach y=9 is the same.\n\nSo the first sequence is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at t=18 or something, but with H smaller.\n\nFor example, if we are at higher y at t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, we must be at y<=2.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 14.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 10, we do D, but since we are at y=3, moving to y=2, which is fine.\n\nNow, let's write the actions.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=5.\n\nSequence for t from 5 to 5+H-1.\n\nH=14, so actions from t=5 to t=18.\n\nt=5 to t=18 inclusive, 14 turns.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the up part, from turn 12 to 18, we go from y=2 to y=9 in 7 steps: turn 12: U to y=3 at t=13, turn 13: U to y=4 at t=14, ..., turn 18: U to y=9 at t=19.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it cleaner, since from turn 12 to 18, all U, but we have to list.\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 3 at t=5: at t=5, we were on y=2, not freeway 3, so no issue.\n\nIn the path, we avoided all unsafe times.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nFrom t=5 to t=18 actions, 14 actions.\n\nReach at t=19.\n\nPerhaps we can do fewer if we go to y=1 or something, but y=1 is freeway 1, which has unsafe at t=6, but we can avoid.\n\nFor example, at t=5, instead of U, we could go D to y=1, but at t=5, on y=2, a5=D, y6=1.\n\nThen at t=6, on y=1, freeway 1, unsafe at T=6, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo must go up at t=5.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H = 14\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The actions are chosen to ensure that the player is not on any freeway \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) during turns when a collision would occur (specifically, avoiding freeways 1 and 2 at turn 6, and freeways 3 to 8 at turns 11 and 12).\n\n- From turn 5 to turn 10, the player moves to and stays at \\(y = 3\\) (safe except at turns 11 and 12, which are avoided) to handle the unsafe condition at turn 6 on freeways 1 and 2. At turn 10, the player moves down to \\(y = 2\\) to be safe at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, the player stays at \\(y = 2\\) to remain safe during turn 12 (freeway 2 is safe at turns 11 and 12).\n- After turn 12, all freeways are safe, so the player moves up directly to \\(y = 9\\) in 7 turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions, with \\(H = 14\\), is as follows:\n\n- Turn 5: Move up (U) to avoid being on freeway 2 at turn 6 (unsafe). Position at turn 6: \\(y = 3\\).\n- Turn 6: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 is safe at turn 6).\n- Turn 7: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 is safe at turn 7).\n- Turn 8: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 is safe at turn 8).\n- Turn 9: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 is safe at turn 9).\n- Turn 10: Move down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 11 (safe on freeway 2). Position at turn 11: \\(y = 2\\).\n- Turn 11: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\) for turn 12 (freeway 2 is safe at turn 12). Position at turn 12: \\(y = 2\\).\n- Turn 12: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 is safe after turn 12). Position at turn 13: \\(y = 3\\).\n- Turn 13: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\). Position at turn 14: \\(y = 4\\).\n- Turn 14: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\). Position at turn 15: \\(y = 5\\).\n- Turn 15: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\). Position at turn 16: \\(y = 6\\).\n- Turn 16: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\). Position at turn 17: \\(y = 7\\).\n- Turn 17: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\). Position at turn 18: \\(y = 8\\).\n- Turn 18: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\). Position at turn 19: \\(y = 9\\).\n\nAt turn 19, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\). No collisions occur during the sequence, as verified against the car movements and unsafe times for each freeway.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

The player moves vertically: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y unchanged). The player must not be on a freeway row (y from 1 to 8) at a turn T if there is a car on that freeway at that turn such that the car's span includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant note: at turn T, if the player moves to a new row at turn T+1, then at turn T the player is still on the old row. So if we move from row y to row y+1 at turn T (by U), then at turn T we are on row y, and at turn T+1 we are on row y+1.\n\nWe start at turn 8, position y=4.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. Since y=9 is the top (and above the freeways), once we are on y=9 we are safe. Note that y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars), but we start at y=4 and need to get to y=9.\n\nThe car movements:\n\nFor a car at turn t1 (which is 8) with given (head, tail, direction, speed), we can compute its position at any future turn T (>=8).\n\nThe update:\n- Left-moving (d = left): Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  But note: the initial span at t1 is [h, tau] for left? Actually, the problem says for left: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. Since the car is moving left, the entire span shifts left by s per turn.\n\n- Right-moving (d = right): Span(t1) = [tau, h] (note: tau is the tail and h the head, but in right-moving, the head is the leading part? Actually, the problem says: for right, Span(t1)=[tau, h] and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that the car extends from tau to h? And then it moves right.\n\nHowever, in the collision condition, we care about whether 0 is in the span at turn T for a car on the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nWe are given:\n\nFreeway 1: one car (48,83,left,36)\nFreeway 2: one car (48,83,left,36)\nFreeway 3: three cars: (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\nFreeway 5: one car: (-18,-29,right,6)\nFreeway 6: one car: (-18,-29,right,6)\nFreeway 7: one car: (-18,-29,right,6)\nFreeway 8: one car: (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nNote: freeways 1 and 2 have the same car? Actually, the table says \"Cars\" and lists one for freeway 1 and one for freeway 2, but they are identical. Similarly, freeways 3 and 4 have the same set of three cars.\n\nWe are at turn 8. We need to simulate the cars from turn 8 onward.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway and each car the time intervals (if any) when the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the car spans are continuous intervals. We need to know at which turns T (>=8) the car on a freeway k has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are going to move from turn 8 onward. We are at y=4 at turn 8.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway k at turn T if any car on freeway k at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nWe note that freeways 1 and 2 have the same car? Actually, they are separate freeways. So freeway 1 has one car, freeway 2 has one car (same data, but they are on different rows).\n\nLet me compute for each car the condition for 0 being in the span at turn T.\n\nGeneral formula for a car at freeway k:\n\nFor a left-moving car: \n  At turn T, the span is [h - 36*(T-8), 83 - 36*(T-8)]   ??? Wait, the initial head is 48 and tail is 83? That doesn't make sense because 48 < 83, but for a left-moving car, if the car is moving left, then the head (front) should be on the left? Actually, the problem says for left: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then moves left. But if h=48 and tau=83, then the car extends from 48 to 83? That would be a car of length 35 (83-48+1?) and moving left.\n\nBut when moving left, the entire car moves left. So at turn T, the car is at [48 - 36*(T-8), 83 - 36*(T-8)].\n\nWe require 0 to be in [48 - 36*(T-8), 83 - 36*(T-8)].\n\nSo:\n  48 - 36*(T-8) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-8)\n\nWe can solve for T.\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36*(T-8) <= 0  => 36*(T-8) >= 48 => T-8 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 => T>=9.333 -> so T>=10 (since T integer)\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-8) => 36*(T-8) <= 83 => T-8 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 => T<=10.305 -> so T<=10\n\nThus, for the car on freeway 1 (and similarly for freeway 2), 0 is in the span only when T=10? Because T must be integer and between 10 and 10 (from T>=10 and T<=10). So only at turn 10.\n\nCheck T=10:\n  48 - 36*(10-8) = 48 - 72 = -24\n  83 - 36*(10-8) = 83 - 72 = 11\n  So the span is [-24, 11] which includes 0.\n\nT=9: \n  48 - 36*1 = 12, 83-36=47 -> [12,47] -> 0 not in.\nT=11: \n  48 - 36*3 = 48-108 = -60, 83-108=-25 -> [-60,-25] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 and 2 are safe at all turns except T=10.\n\nNow for the right-moving cars.\n\nTake the car on freeway 3: (-18,-29,right,6). But note: for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, h]? The problem says: for right, Span(t1)=[tau, h] and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut the given data: (head h, tail tau) = (-18, -29) and direction right? Then the initial span is [tau, h] = [-29, -18]? Because tau is the tail and h is the head? But then the car is from -29 to -18? That's a length of 10? And it moves right.\n\nAt turn T, the span becomes: [-29 + 6*(T-8), -18 + 6*(T-8)].\n\nWe require 0 in [-29 + 6*(T-8), -18 + 6*(T-8)].\n\nSo:\n  -29 + 6*(T-8) <= 0 <= -18 + 6*(T-8)\n\nFirst: -29 + 6*(T-8) <= 0 => 6*(T-8) <= 29 => T-8 <= 29/6 ≈ 4.833 => T<=12.833 -> T<=12\n\nSecond: 0 <= -18 + 6*(T-8) => 6*(T-8) >= 18 => T-8>=3 => T>=11\n\nSo T must be 11 or 12.\n\nCheck T=11: [-29+6*3, -18+6*3] = [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? yes, 0 is the upper bound? so yes.\nT=12: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6] -> includes 0.\n\nT=10: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> no 0.\nT=13: [-29+30, -18+30] = [1,12] -> no.\n\nSo this car covers freeway 3 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nBut note: freeway 3 has two more cars: (60,49,right,6) and (24,13,right,6). \n\nWait, the data for freeway 3: three cars: (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6). \n\nLet me check the others.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,6). But note: for right, the initial span is [tau, h] = [49,60]? Because the problem says: (head h, tail tau) = (60,49) and then for right, the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [49,60]. Then at T: [49 + 6*(T-8), 60 + 6*(T-8)].\n\nWe require 0 in [49+6*(T-8), 60+6*(T-8)].\n\nSince 49+6*(T-8) is at least 49-48=1 (at T=8: 49,60) and then increases, so 0 will never be in this interval because the smallest value is 49 (at T=8) and then becomes larger? So this car never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,6): initial span [13,24] at t1=8. Then at T: [13+6*(T-8), 24+6*(T-8)]. Again, at T=8: [13,24], and then moves right. The smallest value is 13 at T=8, so 0 is never covered.\n\nTherefore, on freeway 3, only the first car (-18,-29,right,6) is dangerous at T=11 and T=12.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4: same set of cars -> same as freeway 3: dangerous at T=11 and T=12.\n\nNow freeways 5,6,7,8: each has one car: (-18,-29,right,6). So each of these freeways has a car that is dangerous at T=11 and T=12.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: T=10\nFreeway 2: T=10\nFreeway 3: T=11,12\nFreeway 4: T=11,12\nFreeway 5: T=11,12\nFreeway 6: T=11,12\nFreeway 7: T=11,12\nFreeway 8: T=11,12\n\nWe are at turn 8, y=4.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves? Since we are at y=4 and we need to get to y=9, the minimal moves would be 5 upward moves (U) without any delay. But we must avoid the dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nWe start at turn 8 at y=4. We are not on a freeway? Actually, y=4 is freeway 4? The freeways are y=1 to 8. So y=4 is freeway 4. But at turn 8, we are on freeway 4. Is freeway 4 dangerous at turn 8? From above, freeway 4 is dangerous only at T=11 and 12. So at turn 8, it is safe.\n\nBut we have to plan the moves. We are going to take actions at turns 8,9,10,... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe can only move one step at a time. We have three choices: U, D, S.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of turns.\n\nThe direct upward path: \n  Turn 8: at y=4 -> action U: then at turn 9 we are at y=5.\n  Turn 9: at y=5 -> action U: turn 10 -> y=6.\n  Turn 10: at y=6 -> action U: turn 11 -> y=7.\n  Turn 11: at y=7 -> action U: turn 12 -> y=8.\n  Turn 12: at y=8 -> action U: turn 13 -> y=9.\n\nBut we must check for collisions at each turn when we are on a freeway (y from 1 to 8).\n\nAt turn 8: we are at y=4 (freeway 4) at turn 8 -> safe (freeway 4 dangerous only at 11,12).\nAt turn 9: we are at y=5 (freeway 5) at turn 9 -> freeway 5 dangerous at 11,12 -> so safe at turn 9.\nAt turn 10: we are at y=6 (freeway 6) at turn 10 -> freeway 6 dangerous at 11,12 -> safe at turn 10.\nAt turn 11: we are at y=7 (freeway 7) at turn 11 -> freeway 7 is dangerous at T=11 -> so we would collide!\n\nTherefore, the direct path at turn 11 on freeway 7 is dangerous.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 1-8 at their dangerous times.\n\nWe note that freeway 1 and 2 are dangerous at turn 10, and freeways 3-8 are dangerous at turns 11 and 12.\n\nWe are going to need to adjust.\n\nWe have two main issues:\n1. At turn 11, we must not be on freeways 3-8 (because they are dangerous at 11). Similarly at turn 12, we must avoid freeways 3-8.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 8 at y=4.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We can consider:\n\nOption 1: Wait at a safe freeway until the danger is over? But note that at turn 11 and 12, all freeways 3-8 are dangerous. So we cannot be on any of them at turn 11 or 12. Therefore, we must be either at y=0 or y=9 at turn 11 and 12? Or we can be in the process of moving? But note: at turn 11, we are at a row (freeway row or safe row) at that turn.\n\nWe can be at y=0 or y=9 at turn 11 and 12 to avoid the danger. But we are starting at y=4 and going to y=9. We cannot get to y=9 by turn 11? Let me see:\n\nIf we go up as fast as possible:\n\nTurn 8: start at y=4 -> U -> turn9: y=5\nTurn9: U -> turn10: y=6\nTurn10: U -> turn11: y=7 -> but y=7 is freeway7, dangerous at turn11 -> crash.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go down to y=0 to avoid? But then we have to come back up.\n\nOr we can try to time the moves so that we skip the dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turns 11 and 12. So at turn 11 and 12, we must be at y=0, or y=9, or possibly in between but only if we are not on a freeway row? But note, the freeways are y=1 to 8. So if we are at y=0 or y=9, we are safe.\n\nBut we are at y=4 at turn8. We need to get to y=9. We cannot be at y=0 at turn11 and then get to y=9 in one turn? That would require moving 9 steps? No, we can only move one per turn.\n\nSo we must be at y=9 by turn12 at the latest? But let's see:\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turns 11 and 12. So at turn11, we must be at y=0 or y=9. Similarly at turn12, we must be at y=0 or y=9. But we want to be at y=9 eventually. So we can aim to be at y=9 at turn11 or turn12.\n\nBut if we are at y=9 at turn11, then we are safe at turn11 and turn12 (if we stay). But we can also be at y=0 at turn11 and then go up? But that would take more turns.\n\nLet me try to be at y=9 by turn11.\n\nFrom turn8 (y=4) to turn11: we have 3 moves (turns 8,9,10). We need to move up 5 steps? That's impossible because 3 moves can only give 3 steps up -> y=7 at turn11. So we cannot be at y=9 by turn11.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at turn11? Then from turn8 to turn11: 3 moves. We are at y=4. We need to go down 4 steps to y=0. That would require 4 moves? So we would need to start going down at turn8,9,10, and then at turn11 we would be at y=0? \n\nTurn8: start y=4 -> D -> turn9: y=3\nTurn9: D -> turn10: y=2\nTurn10: D -> turn11: y=1 -> but we are not at y=0. We need one more D to get to y=0 at turn12? But then at turn11 we are at y=1 -> freeway1? and freeway1 is not dangerous at turn11? freeway1 is dangerous only at turn10. But freeway1 is safe at turn11? yes. But at turn11, freeway1 is safe? because freeway1 is dangerous only at turn10.\n\nBut at turn11, freeways 3-8 are dangerous. So being at y=1 (freeway1) at turn11 is safe? yes.\n\nBut we need to avoid freeways 3-8 at turn11 and 12. So if we are at freeway1 at turn11, that is safe because freeway1 is only dangerous at turn10.\n\nSimilarly, at turn12, if we are at freeway1, is it dangerous? freeway1 is dangerous only at turn10, so turn12 is safe.\n\nBut we want to get to y=9. So we can go from y=1 (at turn11) to y=9 in 8 moves? That would be too many.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the dangerous rows at the dangerous times by carefully timing our moves.\n\nWe note that the danger periods are very specific: only turn10 for freeways1-2, and turns11-12 for freeways3-8.\n\nWe can plan:\n\n- At turn10: we must not be on freeway1 or freeway2? Actually, freeway1 and 2 are dangerous at turn10. But note: we are on a freeway row only if we are on that row at the start of the turn? and then we move at the end of the turn? So at turn10, if we are on freeway1 or 2, we crash.\n\nSimilarly, at turn11 and 12, we crash if we are on freeways 3-8.\n\nSo we can plan:\n\nWe have to cover 5 steps upward. We have from turn8 to ... until we get to y=9.\n\nWe must not be at:\n  y=1 or 2 at turn10\n  y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at turn11 and turn12.\n\nBut note: we are at y=4 at turn8.\n\nWe can try to be at a safe row at turn10,11,12.\n\nSafe rows at turn10: any row except y=1 and y=2? because freeway1 and 2 are dangerous at turn10.\n\nSafe rows at turn11: only y=0,1,2,9? because freeways3-8 (y=3 to 8) are dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, at turn12: same as turn11.\n\nBut note: we can be at y=1 or 2 at turn11 and 12 because they are safe (only freeways3-8 are dangerous at those turns).\n\nSo the constraints:\n\nAt turn10: avoid y=1 and y=2.\nAt turn11: avoid y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\nAt turn12: avoid y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe need to get from y=4 at turn8 to y=9.\n\nLet me denote the state (turn, y). We start at (8,4).\n\nWe can simulate the moves. We want to minimize the number of turns.\n\nWe have to avoid the constraints above.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nAt turn8: we can do U, D, S.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible, so we prefer U, but we have constraints.\n\nWe note that we must be at a safe row at turn10,11,12.\n\nWe have 4 moves until turn12? Let me count:\n\nTurn8: we are at y=4 at the start of the turn, then we choose an action, and then at the end of the turn we update to the next y for the next turn.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn8: action a8 -> at turn9 we are at y5 = y4 + delta.\n\nTurn9: action a9 -> turn10: y10\nTurn10: action a10 -> turn11: y11\nTurn11: action a11 -> turn12: y12\n...\n\nWe must have:\n- At turn10: y10 must not be 1 or 2.\n- At turn11: y11 must be in {0,1,2,9} (to avoid freeways 3-8) -> but note: we are not at y=9 yet, and we are going up? so we might not be at 9 by turn11? \n- At turn12: similarly, y12 must be in {0,1,2,9}.\n\nBut we want to get to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nWe can try to be at y=0,1,2 at turn11 and then go up from there? But that would require going down first.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to be at y=9 by turn12? That would be 4 moves: from y=4 at turn8 to y=9 at turn12: we need 5 steps up in 4 moves? so we need to do 5 ups and possibly one down? that doesn't add up.\n\nWe have 4 moves (turn8,9,10,11) to get from y4 to y12. The maximum we can go up is 4 steps -> y8 at turn12. Then we need one more move to get to y9 at turn13.\n\nBut at turn12 we must be at y=0,1,2, or 9. If we are at y8 at turn12, that is dangerous -> crash.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at y8 at turn12. So we cannot get to y9 by turn12? Then we must be at a safe row at turn12, and then proceed.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y9 is turn13? Then we have:\n\nAt turn12: we must be at a safe row: y=0,1,2,9. But we are going to y9 at turn13, so at turn12 we must be at y8? which is not safe. Or we can be at y9 at turn12? Then we are done. But to be at y9 at turn12, we need to get from y4 to y9 in 4 moves: that requires 5 net upward moves. So we would need 5 U and negative moves? but then we cannot have 5 net upward in 4 moves.\n\nTherefore, the minimal time to get to y9 from y4 is 5 moves (since we need 5 steps up). So the earliest arrival is turn8+5 = turn13? Because:\n\nTurn8: move1 -> turn9: y5\nTurn9: move2 -> turn10: y6\nTurn10: move3 -> turn11: y7\nTurn11: move4 -> turn12: y8\nTurn12: move5 -> turn13: y9\n\nBut at turn12 we are at y8, which is freeway8, and at turn12, freeway8 is dangerous -> crash.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at y8 at turn12. So we cannot do the last up move at turn12? Then we have to delay.\n\nBut we can try to be at a safe row at turn12. For example, at turn12 we can be at y=2? Then from y2 we go up to y3 at turn13, then to y4, etc. That would take more turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=9 at turn13, but we must avoid being at y8 at turn12. How?\n\nWe can do:\n\nWe have to be at a safe row at turn11 and turn12. The safe rows at turn11 and 12 are {0,1,2,9}. We want to minimize the total turns.\n\nWe are at y4 at turn8.\n\nWe need to get to y9. The minimal moves is 5 upward moves. But we have to spend some moves to avoid the dangerous rows at turn10,11,12.\n\nLet me try to simulate:\n\nWe need to be at a safe row at turn10 (so not y1 or y2), at turn11 (must be in {0,1,2,9}), and at turn12 (in {0,1,2,9}).\n\nWe also want to minimize the total turns.\n\nWe can consider being at y2 at turn10? That is not allowed because at turn10, y2 is dangerous (freeway2 is dangerous at turn10). So we cannot be at y1 or y2 at turn10.\n\nSo at turn10, we can be at y0, y3, y4, y5, y6, y7, y8, y9.\n\nBut note: we are starting at y4 at turn8. We have two moves (turn8 and turn9) to get to turn10.\n\nWe can go:\n\nOption A: Go up twice: \n  turn8: U -> turn9: y5\n  turn9: U -> turn10: y6 -> safe at turn10 (since y6 is not 1 or 2)\n\nThen at turn10, we are at y6. Now we must be at a safe row at turn11. Safe rows at turn11: {0,1,2,9}. But we are at y6. We can go down? or up? \n\nIf we go up at turn10: U -> turn11: y7 -> but y7 is not safe at turn11 -> crash.\nIf we go down: D -> turn11: y5 -> y5 is not safe (must be in {0,1,2,9}) -> crash.\nIf we stay: S -> turn11: y6 -> crash.\n\nSo this path fails.\n\nOption B: Go up then down:\n  turn8: U -> turn9: y5\n  turn9: D -> turn10: y4 -> safe (y4 is not 1 or 2)\n\nAt turn10: y4. Now we need to get to a safe row at turn11. We can:\n  U: y5 at turn11 -> crash (y5 not safe)\n  D: y3 at turn11 -> crash (y3 not safe)\n  S: y4 at turn11 -> crash.\n\nFail.\n\nOption C: Go down twice:\n  turn8: D -> turn9: y3\n  turn9: D -> turn10: y2 -> but y2 is dangerous at turn10 -> crash.\n\nFail.\n\nOption D: Go down then up:\n  turn8: D -> turn9: y3\n  turn9: U -> turn10: y4 -> safe.\n\nThen same as option B: at turn10 we are at y4, and then at turn11 we are stuck.\n\nOption E: Go down then stay:\n  turn8: D -> turn9: y3\n  turn9: S -> turn10: y3 -> safe (y3 not 1 or 2)\n\nThen at turn10: y3. Then at turn10 we can:\n  U: turn11 -> y4 -> crash\n  D: turn11 -> y2 -> safe? because at turn11, safe rows are {0,1,2,9}. y2 is safe.\n  S: turn11 -> y3 -> crash.\n\nSo we choose D at turn10: then at turn11: y2.\n\nThen at turn11, we are at y2 (safe). Then we want to go up. But we need to be safe at turn12: at turn12, we must be in {0,1,2,9}. We are at y2 at turn11. We can:\n  U: turn12 -> y3 -> crash (y3 not safe at turn12)\n  D: turn12 -> y1 -> safe (y1 is in {0,1,2,9}? yes, because safe rows at turn12 are {0,1,2,9})\n  S: turn12 -> y2 -> safe.\n\nBut we want to go up. So we have to wait? \n\nIf we do D at turn11: then at turn12: y1. Then we can start going up. But this is getting long.\n\nLet me write the sequence:\n\nTurn8: D -> turn9: y3\nTurn9: S -> turn10: y3\nTurn10: D -> turn11: y2\nTurn11: D -> turn12: y1   [safe because y1 at turn12 is safe]\nThen turn12: U -> turn13: y2\nturn13: U -> turn14: y3\n... until y9: we need 7 more moves from y1? to y9: 8 steps? so 8 moves: turn12 to turn20? That's too long.\n\nWe don't want to go down that much.\n\nAnother option: at turn11 we are at y2 (safe). Then at turn12, we cannot go up to y3 because it's dangerous. But we can go up twice in a row to skip the dangerous rows quickly? But we are constrained by the move per turn.\n\nWe have to be at a safe row at turn12. From y2 at turn11, we can only go to y1, y2, or y3. But y3 is dangerous at turn12. So we can only go to y1 or y2 at turn12.\n\nThen at turn12, we are at y1 or y2. Then we can start going up. But we are only at y1 or y2 at turn12, and we need to get to y9. That will take at least 7 or 8 moves from there. Total turns: from turn8 to turn12: 4 moves, then 7 moves to go from y2 to y9? 11 moves total? That's not minimal.\n\nWe need a better plan.\n\nWhat if we can be at y9 by turn12? That would require 5 upward moves in 4 moves: impossible.\n\nOr at turn13: 5 upward moves in 5 moves: turn8 to turn13.\n\nBut we have to avoid being at y8 at turn12 (because turn12 is dangerous for y8). So we cannot do:\n\nturn8: U -> y5\nturn9: U -> y6\nturn10: U -> y7\nturn11: U -> y8 -> but at turn11, y8 is dangerous! (freeway8 dangerous at turn11) -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot be at y8 at turn11 either.\n\nIn fact, at turn11 and turn12, we cannot be on freeways 3-8 (y3 to y8).\n\nSo the only safe rows at turn11 and turn12 are y0, y1, y2, y9.\n\nWe are at y4 at turn8. We have 3 moves to turn11 (moves at turn8,9,10). We need to be at one of {0,1,2,9} at turn11. But we cannot be at y9 by turn11 because it takes 5 moves to go up 5 steps and we only have 3 moves.\n\nSo we must be at y0, y1, or y2 at turn11.\n\nThe closest safe row is y2. How to get to y2 at turn11?\n\nFrom y4 at turn8 to y2 at turn11: net change -2. In 3 moves, we can do two downs and one up? or two downs and one stay? \n\nWe need to avoid being at dangerous rows at turn10.\n\nAt turn10, we cannot be at y1 or y2.\n\nSo we want at turn10 to be at a row not in {1,2}. And at turn11 to be at y0,1,2.\n\nWe are at y4 at turn8.\n\nOption: \n  turn8: D -> turn9: y3\n  turn9: D -> turn10: y2 -> but y2 is dangerous at turn10 -> crash.\n\nNot allowed.\n\nOption:\n  turn8: D -> turn9: y3\n  turn9: S -> turn10: y3 (safe at turn10 because not 1 or 2)\n  turn10: D -> turn11: y2 (safe at turn11 because y2 is allowed)\n\nThis works.\n\nSo sequence so far:\n  Turn8: D\n  Turn9: S\n  Turn10: D\n\nThen at turn11: y2.\n\nThen at turn11, we are at y2. We need to get to y9. We have to be safe at turn12: we are at y2 at turn11, and at turn12 we must be in {0,1,2,9}. We can choose to move or not.\n\nIf we move up at turn11: U -> turn12: y3 -> but y3 is dangerous at turn12 -> crash.\nIf we move down: D -> turn12: y1 -> safe.\nIf we stay: S -> turn12: y2 -> safe.\n\nBut we want to go up. So we choose to stay or go down? That delays our progress.\n\nAfter turn12, the danger is over. The dangerous times are only turn10,11,12. So at turn13 onward, all freeways are safe.\n\nSo from turn12 onward, we can go up freely.\n\nBut at turn11 we are at y2. We then:\n\nOption 1: at turn11: S -> turn12: y2 (safe)\n  Then turn12: U -> turn13: y3\n  turn13: U -> turn14: y4\n  turn14: U -> turn15: y5\n  turn15: U -> turn16: y6\n  turn17: U -> y7\n  turn18: U -> y8\n  turn19: U -> y9\n\nThat's 11 moves from turn8? We have turn8 to turn19: 12 turns? But we start at turn8 and do actions at turn8,9,..., until we reach.\n\nTotal turns: from turn8 to turn19 (inclusive) is 12 turns? But we only need to count the actions from turn8 to the action that gets us to y9. The last action is at turn18: U to go from y8 to y9 at turn19. So the actions are at turns 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 -> 11 actions.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nOption 2: at turn11: D -> turn12: y1 (safe)\n  Then turn12: U -> turn13: y2\n  turn13: U -> y3\n  ... until turn18: U -> y8\n  turn19: U -> y9 -> still 11 actions? because from y1 to y9: 8 steps, so 8 actions from turn12 to turn19, plus the first three actions (turn8,9,10) and turn11: so 4 actions before turn12, then 8 actions -> total 12 actions? Let me count:\n\n  turn8: D (action1)\n  turn9: S (action2)\n  turn10: D (action3)\n  turn11: D (action4) -> y1 at turn12\n  turn12: U (action5) -> y2 at turn13\n  turn13: U (action6) -> y3\n  turn14: U (action7) -> y4\n  turn15: U (action8) -> y5\n  turn16: U (action9) -> y6\n  turn17: U (action10) -> y7\n  turn18: U (action11) -> y8\n  turn19: U (action12) -> y9\n\nSo 12 actions.\n\nBut in option1 (stay at turn11): we had:\n  turn8: D (1)\n  turn9: S (2)\n  turn10: D (3) -> y2 at turn11\n  turn11: S (4) -> y2 at turn12\n  turn12: U (5) -> y3 at turn13\n  turn13: U (6) -> y4\n  turn14: U (7) -> y5\n  turn15: U (8) -> y6\n  turn16: U (9) -> y7\n  turn17: U (10) -> y8\n  turn18: U (11) -> y9 at turn19\n\nSo 11 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to do better?\n\nWe could go up after turn12 faster? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: after turn12, there is no danger, but we are at y2. We need 7 ups to get to y9. So minimum 7 moves after turn12. The first part (to get to a safe row at turn11) took 3 moves (turn8,9,10) and then at turn11 we have to do an action to be safe at turn12, which can be S or D. If we do S, then we are at y2 for both turn11 and turn12. Then from turn12 onward, we do 7 ups: total actions = 3 (t8-t10) + 1 (t11) + 7 (t12-t18) = 11 actions, and we arrive at turn19.\n\nCan we avoid the extra action at turn11? If we could be at y2 at turn11 and then at turn12 be at a safe row without an action? But we have to take an action at turn11.\n\nUnless we can be at y9 at turn12, but that's impossible from y2 in one move.\n\nOr if we can be at y0 or y1 at turn11, but then we are even lower.\n\nBut let's try to get to y0 at turn11.\n\nFrom y4 at turn8 to y0 at turn11: net change -4 in 3 moves. We need 4 downs. Impossible.\n\nOr y1: net change -3 in 3 moves: possible: three downs.\n\nBut then at turn10, if we go down three times:\n\n turn8: D -> y3\n turn9: D -> y2 -> crash at turn9? no, the danger at turn10 is for being at y1 or y2 at turn10. But at turn9, we are at y2? That's turn9, not turn10. But at turn10, we will be at y1 if we do:\n\n turn8: D -> turn9: y3\n turn9: D -> turn10: y2 -> crash at turn10 because y2 is dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be at y1 or y2 at turn10.\n\nTo get to y1 at turn11, we must have been at y2 or y1 or y0 at turn10. But y1 and y2 are dangerous at turn10. So the only safe way is to be at y0 at turn10? Then from y0 at turn10, we can go to y1 at turn11 by U, or stay at y0, or go down? but y0 is the bottom.\n\nHow to get to y0 at turn10:\n\nFrom y4 at turn8 to y0 at turn10: net change -4 in 2 moves: impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to be at y2 at turn11 via the path: turn8: D, turn9: S, turn10: D.\n\nThen we have to spend an action at turn11 to stay at y2 or go down to y1, and then we start going up.\n\nBut we want to minimize the total turns. Is there a way to be higher than y2 at turn11 without crashing?\n\nThe safe rows at turn11 are y0,1,2,9. We can't be at y9. We can't be at y0 or y1 without crashing at turn10. So only y2 is achievable.\n\nTherefore, we are at y2 at turn11.\n\nNow, at turn12, we can be at y1, y2, or y3? but y3 is dangerous. So we can be at y1 or y2.\n\nIf we are at y2 at turn12, then we start going up from there. The soonest to y9 is 7 ups: actions at turn12 to turn18, arrive at y9 at turn19.\n\nTotal actions: from turn8 to turn18: 11 actions.\n\nBut can we be at a higher safe row at turn12? The safe rows are only up to y2, so no.\n\nAnother idea: after turn12, the danger is over. But at turn12 we are at y2. We can do a double move? No, only one per turn.\n\nIs there a way to get to y9 sooner if we use more up moves earlier? But we have to avoid the danger times.\n\nWhat if we go up initially and then down to avoid the danger at turn11?\n\nFor example:\n\n turn8: U -> turn9: y5\n turn9: U -> turn10: y6\n turn10: we cannot stay at y6 because then at turn11 we would be at y6,7, or 8 if we move up or stay or down by one? and all are dangerous.\n\nSo at turn10, we must leave the freeways 3-8 by turn11. How? We can go down to y5 at turn11? but y5 is not safe. Or to y0? not possible.\n\nWe can go up to y7 at turn10, then at turn10 we do D to y6 at turn11? still not safe.\n\nOr we can go down from y6 at turn10 to y5 at turn11? not safe.\n\nSo it seems impossible to be above y2 at turn11 without crashing.\n\nTherefore, the only viable path is to go down to y3 at turn9, then stay to avoid being at y2 at turn10, then down to y2 at turn11, then stay or down at turn11, then start going up.\n\nBut to minimize the total turns, we want to start going up as soon as possible.\n\nSo at turn11, we are at y2. We can either:\n\n- Stay at turn11: then at turn12 we are at y2. Then we start going up at turn12, and it takes 7 ups to get to y9 at turn19.\n\n- Or at turn11, we go down to y1 at turn12. Then at turn12, we are at y1. Then we go up from there: 8 ups to get to y9 at turn20 -> worse.\n\nSo better to stay at turn11.\n\nThen the plan is:\n\nTurn8: D (from y4 to y3 at turn9)\nTurn9: S (stay at y3 at turn10)\nTurn10: D (from y3 to y2 at turn11)\nTurn11: S (stay at y2 at turn12)\nThen from turn12 to turn18: U every turn.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn8: D\nTurn9: S\nTurn10: D\nTurn11: S\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\n\nAt turn18, after U, we go from y8 to y9 at turn19.\n\nBut the action at turn18 is the last action? and at turn19 we are at y9. So we have used 11 actions (from turn8 to turn18).\n\nBut is there a way to save one turn?\n\nWhat if at turn11, instead of staying, we go up? But then at turn12 we would be at y3, which is dangerous -> crash. So not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, can we be at y0 at turn12? That would be even lower.\n\nAnother idea: at turn10, after being at y3, we could go up instead of down? But then at turn11 we would be at y4, which is dangerous -> crash.\n\nOr at turn9, after turn8: D to y3, we could go up on turn9? then turn9: U -> turn10: y4. Safe at turn10. Then at turn10: we can go down to y3 at turn11 -> dangerous (y3 is not safe at turn11). Or up to y5 at turn11 -> dangerous. Or stay at y4 -> dangerous. So not possible.\n\nTherefore, the above plan is the only safe one we have.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y9 sooner by not going down to y2 but to y0 or y1 earlier? We saw it's not possible without crashing at turn10.\n\nAnother thought: the danger at turn10 is only for freeway1 and2 (y1 and y2). So if we are at y0 at turn10, that's safe. But how to get to y0 at turn10 from y4 at turn8 in two moves? We need two downs: turn8: D->y3, turn9: D->y2 -> but at turn9 we are at y2? then at turn10 we would be at y2 if we stay, or y1 if we go down, or y3 if we go up. But at turn10, if we are at y2, crash. If we are at y1, crash. If we are at y3, safe. But then at turn10 we are at y3, and then at turn11 we need to be at safe row. So then we go down to y2 at turn11: safe. Then same as before.\n\nWe cannot be at y0 at turn10.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 11.\n\nBut let me confirm the entire sequence and the positions at each turn:\n\nTurn8: start at y4, action D -> then at turn9: y3\nTurn9: action S -> at turn10: y3\n  At turn10: we are at y3 -> safe because not y1 or y2.\nTurn10: action D -> at turn11: y2\n  At turn11: we are at y2 -> safe because y2 is in {0,1,2,9}\nTurn11: action S -> at turn12: y2\n  At turn12: safe because y2 is allowed.\nTurn12: U -> turn13: y3\nTurn13: U -> turn14: y4\nTurn14: U -> turn15: y5\nTurn15: U -> turn16: y6\nTurn16: U -> turn17: y7\nTurn17: U -> turn18: y8\nTurn18: U -> turn19: y9 -> reached.\n\nWe reached at turn19. The actions are from turn8 to turn18: 11 actions.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H and the sequence. H is the number of actions? or the number of turns including the start? The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd we start at t1=8, so actions at t=0 to H-1 relative to t1. So the actions are at times: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd after H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and at that turn we are at y=9.\n\nIn our case, after 11 actions (at turns 8,9,...,18), at turn19 we are at y9. So the last action is at turn18, and then at turn19 we are at the goal.\n\nThe number of actions is 11. So H=11.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWhat if we go up initially as much as possible without hitting the danger, then wait at a safe row during the danger turns.\n\nFor example, we go up to y5 at turn9, then to y6 at turn10. Then at turn10, we are at y6 (safe because not y1 or y2). Then we have to get to a safe row at turn11. The only way is to go down to y5? but y5 is not safe. Or to y0? not possible. So no.\n\nGo up to y7 by turn11: \n  turn8: U -> y5\n  turn9: U -> y6\n  turn10: U -> y7 -> at turn11, y7 is dangerous -> crash.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo up to y5 at turn9, then down to y4 at turn10, then down to y3 at turn11 -> but y3 is not safe at turn11.\n\nNo.\n\nSo the only safe way is to go down to avoid the danger.\n\nBut we can try to be at y9 at turn13 or turn14? In our plan, we are at y9 at turn19, which is after 11 actions.\n\nBut let me count the turns: from turn8 to turn19 is 12 turns? But we are only concerned with the number of actions.\n\nThe minimal number of actions to achieve the goal is 11.\n\nBut is there a way with 10 actions? That would mean we reach y9 at turn18.\n\nTo reach y9 at turn18, we need to cover 5 steps up in 10 actions? But 10 actions allow up to 10 steps up, but we start at y4, so we can easily overshoot. But the issue is the constraints.\n\nSuppose we do 10 actions. We start at turn8, action1 at turn8, ..., action10 at turn17, then at turn18 we are at y9.\n\nWe have to be safe at turn10,11,12.\n\nWe need to net +5 in y (from y4 to y9) in 10 moves. So we can have 5 ups and 5 other moves (downs or stays) that cancel out.\n\nBut we have to be at safe rows at turn10,11,12.\n\nAt turn10: not at y1 or y2.\nAt turn11 and12: only at y0,1,2,9.\n\nBut we are at y4 at turn8. In the first two moves (turn8 and9), we can go to any y from 2 to 6.\n\nWe can try to be at a high y during the danger turns by going up and then waiting at y9? But we can't get to y9 before turn13.\n\nFor example, if we go up continuously, we get to y9 at turn13 (5 ups: actions at turn8,9,10,11,12, then at turn13 we are at y9). But then at turn11 and12, we would be at y7 and y8, which are dangerous -> crash.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y5 or y6 and then wait there? But at turn11 and12, we cannot be at y5 or y6.\n\nSo we must leave the freeways 3-8 at turn11 and12.\n\nThe only way is to be at y0,1,2 at those turns.\n\nBut then after turn12, we have to go up from there. From y2, we need 7 ups, which would take 7 actions. And before turn12, we have 4 actions (turn8 to turn11). So total actions: 4 + 7 = 11.\n\nIf we are at y1 at turn12, then 8 ups -> 4+8=12 actions.\n\nIf we are at y0 at turn12, then 9 ups -> 13 actions.\n\nSo the minimal is 11 actions by being at y2 at turn12.\n\nAnd we have a plan for that.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nTurn8: D\nTurn9: S\nTurn10: D\nTurn11: S\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\n\nBut let me double-check the turns:\n\nAction at turn8: D -> leads to turn9: y3\nAction at turn9: S -> turn10: y3\nAction at turn10: D -> turn11: y2\nAction at turn11: S -> turn12: y2\nAction at turn12: U -> turn13: y3\nAction at turn13: U -> turn14: y4\nAction at turn14: U -> turn15: y5\nAction at turn15: U -> turn16: y6\nAction at turn16: U -> turn17: y7\nAction at turn17: U -> turn18: y8\nAction at turn18: U -> turn19: y9\n\nAnd we are done.\n\nNow, we must ensure that at every turn when we are on a freeway (y1 to y8), the freeway is not dangerous at that turn.\n\nCheck:\n\nTurn8: y4 -> freeway4. At turn8, freeway4 dangerous? Only at turns 11 and 12. Safe.\nTurn9: y3 -> freeway3. Dangerous at 11,12? not 9. Safe.\nTurn10: y3 -> freeway3. Dangerous at 11,12? not 10. Safe.\nTurn11: y2 -> freeway2. Dangerous at turn10? not 11. Safe.\nTurn12: y2 -> freeway2. Safe (danger only at turn10).\nTurn13: y3 -> freeway3. After turn12, no danger. Safe.\nTurn14: y4 -> freeway4. Safe.\n... and so on.\n\nAlso, we avoided the dangerous times for freeway1 and2 at turn10: we were at y3 at turn10, not y1 or y2.\n\nAnd at turn11 and12, we were at y2, which is safe for those turns.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nSo the answer is 11 actions, and the sequence as above.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence. I think H is the number of actions, which is 11.\n\nIn the answer format, we list the actions from turn8 to turn18.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: D\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: D\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut the current turn is t1=8, so we start at turn8.\n\nWe don't need to write beyond turn18 because after the last action (turn18) we reach the goal at the next turn.\n\nSo the sequence has 11 actions.\n\nNow, to box the answer.\n\nBut let me see if we can optimize one more: at turn11, we are at y2, and we do S. Then at turn12 we are at y2 and then we go up. But could we at turn11 do nothing (S) and then at turn12 do U, but is there a way to combine and save a move? No.\n\nAlternatively, if we at turn11 do U, we crash. So no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at the specified dangerous turns.\n\n### Dangerous Turns Summary:\n- **Freeways 1 and 2**: Dangerous at turn 10 (player must avoid \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10).\n- **Freeways 3 to 8**: Dangerous at turns 11 and 12 (player must be at \\(y = 0\\), \\(y = 1\\), \\(y = 2\\), or \\(y = 9\\) at turns 11 and 12).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence starts at turn 8 and ends at turn 18 (11 actions). After the last action (turn 18), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\n- **Turn 8 (current turn)**: Move down (D) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 9. Safe, as freeway 3 is not dangerous at turn 8.\n- **Turn 9**: Stay (S) at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 10. Safe, as \\(y = 3\\) is not 1 or 2 (avoiding freeways 1 and 2 danger at turn 10).\n- **Turn 10**: Move down (D) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 11. Safe, as freeways 1 and 2 are only dangerous at turn 10.\n- **Turn 11**: Stay (S) at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 12. Safe, as \\(y = 2\\) is allowed at turn 11 and 12 (safe rows: 0, 1, 2, 9).\n- **Turns 12 to 18**: Move up (U) consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19. After turn 12, no freeways are dangerous, so moving up is safe.\n\n### Full Position Timeline:\n- Turn 8: Start at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe at turn 8).\n- Action D: At turn 9, \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe at turn 9).\n- Action S: At turn 10, \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe at turn 10; not \\(y = 1\\) or 2).\n- Action D: At turn 11, \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe at turn 11; \\(y = 2\\) is allowed).\n- Action S: At turn 12, \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe at turn 12; \\(y = 2\\) is allowed).\n- Action U: At turn 13, \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe after turn 12).\n- Action U: At turn 14, \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe).\n- Action U: At turn 15, \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe).\n- Action U: At turn 16, \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe).\n- Action U: At turn 17, \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe).\n- Action U: At turn 18, \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, safe).\n- Action U: At turn 19, \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached, safe).\n\n### Answer:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: D \\\\\nTurn 9: S \\\\\nTurn 10: D \\\\\nTurn 11: S \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t_1 = 11 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right with constant speed, and their positions are given at turn t_1. I need to check for collisions at each turn when the player is on a freeway. Collision happens only if the player is on a freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are not on y_{T+1} until the next turn. So at turn T, they are on y_T, and only check cars on y_T. When they move, at turn T, they leave y_T and arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, but the player starts at y=0 and needs to be at y=9.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at turn t_1=11.\n\nFor each freeway k=1 to 8:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head=48, tail=83, direction=left, speed=36. Since it's left-moving, span is [h, τ] = [48,83], but for left-moving, head is smaller? Direction left means it's moving left, so position decreases. The span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, head is the front when moving left, so if moving left, head should be less than tail? Let me read the update.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nHere for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36). So at t_1=11, span is [48,83]. Since moving left, as T increases, both decrease.\n\nBut [48,83] with left direction: if moving left, the head should be on the left, so smaller x, so head=48, tail=83? 48 to 83, that's increasing x, but direction left means moving to smaller x, so at t_1, head is at 48, tail at 83? But if moving left, tail should be behind, so if head is at smaller x, tail at larger x, so span [head, tail] with head < tail for left-moving? But here head=48, tail=83, 48<83, so [48,83], as T increases, both decrease, so it moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it should be [τ, h] with τ < h, I think.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3: (48,37,right,6), but it says (head, tail), but for right-moving, it's listed as (48,37,right,6), but in the span definition for right, it's [τ, h], so τ should be tail, h head.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut for direction, when moving right, head should be greater than tail, I assume.\n\nFor freeway 3: (48,37,right,6), so head=48, tail=37, since right, head > tail, so at t_1, position from tail to head, so span [τ, h] = [37,48].\n\nSimilarly, for left, head < tail, span [h, τ].\n\nIn freeway 1, left: head=48, tail=83, 48<83, so [48,83].\n\nNow for freeway 3, it has multiple cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nEach is a separate car on the same freeway.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 4 same as 3: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: only (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 are different: both have (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway 2 same as 1: (48,83,left,36)\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0, turn 11.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be 9 turns if I can go up every turn, but I need to avoid collisions on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nAt each turn, when on a freeway, I need to ensure that for that freeway, at that turn, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nThe collision is only if 0 is in the span at the exact turn when player is on that y.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, player is on y_T, so check cars on y_T for that turn.\n\nThen after action, y_{T+1} is set, but at turn T, player is still on y_T.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as much as possible, but I need to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when 0 is in the span of any car, meaning when it is dangerous to be on that freeway.\n\nSince cars move continuously, I need to find for each freeway, the times when a car covers x=0.\n\nx=0 is the player's x-position, always 0.\n\nFor each car on each freeway, find when 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nT is discrete turns.\n\nLet t_1 = 11.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, the span depends on s and direction.\n\nFirst, for left-moving car: span at T: [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\n0 in span means h - s(T - t_1) <= 0 <= τ - s(T - t_1)\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)], so τ + s(T - t_1) <= 0 <= h + s(T - t_1)\n\nSince the span is a interval, 0 in it means the min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor left-moving: since head < tail, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1\n\n0 in [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] iff h - sΔT <= 0 <= τ - sΔT\n\nWhich is h <= sΔT <= τ? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nh - sΔT <= 0 and 0 <= τ - sΔT\n\nSo h - sΔT <= 0 => sΔT >= h\n\nAnd 0 <= τ - sΔT => sΔT <= τ\n\nSince s > 0, ΔT >=0.\n\nSo for left-moving, 0 in span at T iff h <= sΔT <= τ\n\nWhere ΔT = T - t_1\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\n0 in it iff τ + sΔT <= 0 <= h + sΔT\n\nSo τ + sΔT <= 0 and 0 <= h + sΔT\n\nThus sΔT <= -τ and sΔT >= -h\n\nSince τ and h, for right-moving, τ < h, so -h < -τ.\n\nsΔT >= -h and sΔT <= -τ\n\nBecause from τ + sΔT <= 0 => sΔT <= -τ\n\nAnd 0 <= h + sΔT => sΔT >= -h\n\nSo sΔT >= -h and sΔT <= -τ\n\nSince h > τ, -h < -τ, so sΔT between -h and -τ.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's find for each car when it covers x=0.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, left, h=48, τ=83, s=36, t_1=11\n\n0 in span when h <= sΔT <= τ, so 48 <= 36 ΔT <= 83\n\nΔT = T - 11\n\nSo 48 <= 36 (T-11) <= 83\n\nDivide by 36: 48/36 <= T-11 <= 83/36\n\n48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo T-11 between 1.333 and 2.305, since T integer, T-11=2? 1.333 to 2.305, so ΔT=2? T-11=2, then 36*2=72, 48<=72<=83? 48<=72 yes, 72<=83 yes. ΔT=1: 36*1=36, 48<=36? 36<48, false. ΔT=3: 36*3=108, 108<=83? 108>83, false. So only at ΔT=2, T=13.\n\nsΔT=36*ΔT, must be >=48 and <=83.\n\nΔT=1: 36, 36<48, not >=48\n\nΔT=2: 72, 48<=72<=83, yes\n\nΔT=3: 108>83, not <=83\n\nSo only at T=13, for freeway 1, the car covers x=0.\n\nT = t_1 + ΔT = 11 + 2 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 is the same: (48,83,left,36), so also only at T=13, dangerous.\n\nNow freeway 3: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6)\n\nRight-moving: h=48, τ=37, s=6\n\n0 in span when sΔT >= -h and sΔT <= -τ\n\nsΔT >= -48 and sΔT <= -37\n\nSince right-moving, sΔT >= -h and sΔT <= -τ\n\nh=48, τ=37, so sΔT >= -48 and sΔT <= -37\n\ns=6>0, so ΔT >= ceil(-48/6) and ΔT <= floor(-37/6)? Let's compute.\n\nsΔT >= -48 => 6ΔT >= -48 => ΔT >= -8\n\nBut ΔT = T-11 >=0, so ΔT >=0 always true since -8<0.\n\nsΔT <= -37 => 6ΔT <= -37 => ΔT <= -37/6 ≈ -6.166, but ΔT >=0, so 6ΔT >=0 > -37? -37 is negative, 6ΔT >=0 for ΔT>=0, so 6ΔT <= -37 is impossible because left side >=0, right side negative.\n\nsΔT <= -τ = -37, since τ=37, -τ=-37\n\nsΔT <= -37, but sΔT =6ΔT >=0 for ΔT>=0, which is greater than -37, so 6ΔT <= -37 cannot hold for any ΔT>=0.\n\nSimilarly, sΔT >= -h = -48, which is true for all ΔT since 6ΔT >=0 > -48? -48 is less, so 6ΔT >= -48 always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nBut the inequality sΔT <= -τ must hold, but -τ = -37, sΔT <= -37, but sΔT >=0, so indeed impossible.\n\nFor this car, at no time 0 is covered? But let's think.\n\nThe span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [37 + 6ΔT, 48 + 6ΔT]\n\nSince moving right, positions increase.\n\n0 in span if 37 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= 48 + 6ΔT\n\nNow, 37 + 6ΔT <=0 and 0 <=48 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst, 0 <=48 + 6ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nSecond, 37 + 6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <= -37 => ΔT <= -37/6 ≈ -6.166, which is impossible for ΔT>=0.\n\nSo indeed, for this car, since it starts at min x=37 at t_1, and moves right, it never reaches x=0 or less; it's always to the right. So 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly for other cars on freeway 3.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (12,1,right,6)\n\nh=12, τ=1, right\n\nSpan [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [1 + 6ΔT, 12 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= 12 + 6ΔT\n\n0 <=12 + 6ΔT always true.\n\n1 + 6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <= -1 => ΔT <= -1/6 ≈ -0.166, impossible.\n\nSo never covers x=0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nh=-24? Head=-24, tail=-35, direction right.\n\nSince right, head > tail? -24 > -35, yes.\n\nSpan [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-35 + 6ΔT, -24 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= -24 + 6ΔT\n\nWhich is -35 + 6ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -24 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst: -35 + 6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, so ΔT <=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 6ΔT => 6ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT >=4 and ΔT <=5\n\nThus for ΔT=4 and 5.\n\nT = t_1 + ΔT =11 +4=15 or 11+5=16.\n\nAt T=15 and 16, this car covers x=0.\n\nNow, for freeway 3, we have three cars, but the first two never cover x=0, only the third one does at T=15 and 16.\n\nSo freeway 3 is dangerous at T=15 and 16.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, only the third car covers x=0 at T=15 and 16.\n\nSo dangerous at T=15,16.\n\nFreeway 5: only one car (48,37,right,6)\n\nAs before, never covers x=0, so freeway 5 is always safe? Let's confirm.\n\nCar: h=48, τ=37, right, s=6\n\nSpan [37 + 6ΔT, 48 + 6ΔT], min at least 37>0, so never <=0, so 0 never in span. Yes, always safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same car (48,37,right,6), always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 1 and 2 are dangerous only at T=13.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous at T=13\n\n- y=2: dangerous at T=13\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=15,16\n\n- y=4: dangerous at T=15,16\n\n- y=5: always safe\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: always safe\n\nPlayer starts at turn 11, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nSince y=5 to y=8 are always safe, I can be on them anytime.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are only dangerous at T=13, so I should avoid being on y=1 or y=2 at turn 13.\n\ny=3 and y=4 are dangerous at T=15 and 16, so avoid on them at those turns.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nStart at turn 11, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up at least 9 times, but I can stay or move down, but that would increase H, so to minimize H, I should move up every turn if possible.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if I go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 turns, arriving at turn 19? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, after action, position is y_T.\n\nTurn t_1 =11, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{11}, y_{12} = y_{11} + Δy, but y_{11} is given, at turn 11, before action? The position is given at turn t_1, which is before any action, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nThe state is given at turn t_1: player position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0) at turn t_1=11.\n\nThen, for each turn, player chooses action a_t, then position updates: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThe collision is checked at the beginning of each turn, I think, based on the position at that turn.\n\nThe note says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, player is on y_T, and we check for freeway y_T if there is a car with 0 in span at turn T.\n\nThen after action, y_{T+1} is set for the next turn.\n\nSo at turn T, position y_T is used for collision check.\n\nStart: turn 11, y_11 = 0. Since y=0 is not freeway, no collision possible. Safe.\n\nThen player chooses a_{11}, which determines y_{12}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 12, position y_{12}, if on freeway 1-8, check collision based on cars at that turn, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nSince y=9 is not freeway, no collision, but I need to be at y=9, so at some turn, after action, y_T=9.\n\nThe sequence ends when y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, but let's see the index.\n\nt_1=11, after H turns, I think we have turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1? Let's read.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at time t_1 + 0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + H-1\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, the position is y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9? Not exactly.\n\nThe position after action a_t is y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position becomes y_{t+1}.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nActions from t = t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nStart at turn t_1=11, y_11=0.\n\nAfter action a_11, y_12 set.\n\nAfter a_12, y_13 set, ..., after a_{11+H-1}, y_{11+H} set.\n\nWe want y_{11+H} =9.\n\nMinimal H is 9, if I go up every turn, y_12=1, y_13=2, ..., y_20=9.\n\nt_1 + H =11 + H, set to 9, so 11+H=20 when H=9? y_{11+H} =9, so for H=9, y_{20}=9.\n\nBut at intermediate turns, I need to avoid collision.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T from 12 to 19, y_T from 1 to 8, need to be safe at those turns.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, which is set by previous action.\n\nFor example, at turn T=12, y_12 depends on a_11, and so on.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are per freeway, but I need to know when I am on which freeway.\n\nSince I want minimal H, let's assume I go up every turn and see if possible.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nTurn 11: y_11=0, safe (not freeway)\n\nAction a_11 = U, then y_12 = 0 +1 =1\n\nAt turn 12: y_12=1, which is freeway 1. Check if collision at T=12.\n\nFor freeway 1, dangerous only at T=13, not at T=12. So safe? At T=12, ΔT = T - t_1 =12-11=1\n\nFor freeway 1, car: left, s=36, at ΔT=1, span [48-36*1, 83-36*1] = [12,47], 0 not in [12,47], so safe.\n\nThen action a_12=U, y_13=1+1=2\n\nAt turn 13: y_13=2, freeway 2. Dangerous at T=13? Freeway 2 has same car, dangerous at T=13.\n\nAt T=13, ΔT=13-11=2, span [48-72, 83-72]? sΔT=36*2=72, so [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11]\n\n-24 to 11, which includes 0, since -24<=0<=11, yes. So collision if on freeway 2 at T=13.\n\nBut here y_13=2, which is freeway 2, and at T=13, so collision.\n\nCannot be on y=2 at turn 13.\n\nIn this path, at turn 13, y=2, collision.\n\nSo going straight up causes collision at turn 13 on y=2.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nPossible ways: delay reaching y=2 at turn 13, or skip y=2 at that turn.\n\nSince y=1 and y=2 are dangerous only at T=13, I can be on them at other times.\n\nSimilarly for y=3 and y=4, dangerous at T=15 and 16.\n\nNow, minimal H=9 might not be possible if I have to wait.\n\nBut y=5 to 8 are safe, so I can go through them fast.\n\nLet me list the turns and possible y positions.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at turn 11+H.\n\nSet T_start = 11.\n\nI need y_T for T from 11 to some T_end.\n\ny_11 = 0\n\ny_{11+H} =9\n\nEach step, y_{t+1} = y_t + a_t, with a_t in {U,D,S}, so y changes by -1,0,1.\n\nTo minimize H, I want to increase y as fast as possible.\n\nBut I have constraints at certain turns.\n\nFirst, at turn 13, I must not be on y=1 or y=2, because both are dangerous at T=13.\n\ny=1: at T=13, freeway 1 dangerous? Freeway 1 is y=1.\n\ny=1 dangerous at T=13? Freeway 1 dangerous only at T=13, so at turn 13, if on y=1, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at turn 13, collision.\n\nNow, y=3 at turn 13: is it dangerous? y=3 dangerous at T=15,16, not at 13, so at turn 13, y=3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, other y are safe at turn 13.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 15 and 16, I must not be on y=3 or y=4.\n\nNow, y=5-8 always safe.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince at turn 13, I cannot be on y=1 or y=2, I could be lower or higher.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=0 at turn 13, or y=3 or above.\n\nBut y=0 at turn 13: turn 13 is after start.\n\nStart at turn 11 y=0.\n\nAfter two actions, at turn 13, y_13 depends on a_11 and a_12.\n\ny_13 = y_11 + Δy_11 + Δy_12 = 0 + a11 + a12, since each Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo avoid being on y=1 or 2 at turn 13, y_13 must not be 1 or 2.\n\nSo y_13 <=0 or y_13 >=3.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, y=3 safe, etc.\n\ny_13=0,1,2,3,... but not 1 or 2.\n\nSo y_13 <=0 or y_13 >=3.\n\nNow, similarly for other turns.\n\nBut I also have constraints at T=15,16 for y=3,4.\n\nFirst, let's list the critical turns.\n\nTurn 13: avoid y=1 and y=2\n\nTurn 15: avoid y=3 and y=4\n\nTurn 16: avoid y=3 and y=4\n\nNow, I want to go up fast.\n\nMinimal H: if no obstacles, H=9, arrive y=9 at turn 20.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\nSince I have to avoid turn 13 on y=1 or 2, I can, for example, stay at y=0 for some turns or move down, but that might increase H.\n\nTo save time, I should go up but skip the dangerous spots.\n\nFor instance, at turn 13, if I am at y=0 or y=3, safe.\n\nThen later, at turn 15 and 16, I need to not be on y=3 or 4.\n\nNow, let's think step by step from start.\n\nTurn 11: y=0, safe. I can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf I choose S, y=0 still, but I waste a turn, not good for min time.\n\nSimilarly, D to y=-1, but y must be >=0, so y_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=0, D not possible, since y=0, if D, y= -1 not allowed, so I think the position is clamped, but the dynamics say y_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=0, a_t=D would set y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, same as S. Similarly at y=9, U same as S.\n\nBut in this case, from y=0, D and S both result in y=0.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=1.\n\nTo make progress, I should go U when possible.\n\nBut at start, I need to avoid being on y=1 or 2 at turn 13.\n\nTurn 13 is two turns from now.\n\nFrom turn 11 to turn 13, two actions: a11 and a12.\n\ny13 = y11 + Δy11 + Δy12 = 0 + a11 + a12, where a_t is U:+1, D:-1 or 0, S:0.\n\nBut since y=0, D or S both give 0, U gives +1.\n\nSo possible y13:\n\n- If both S or D: y13=0\n\n- If one U and one S/D: y13=1\n\n- If both U: y13=2\n\nBut we need y13 not 1 or 2, so only possibilities: y13=0 or y13 >=3, but from y=0 in two steps, max y=2, min y=0, so y13 can only be 0,1,2.\n\nCannot be >=3 in two steps.\n\nTherefore, the only way to avoid y13=1 or 2 is to have y13=0.\n\nThus, at turn 13, I must be at y=0.\n\nWhich means I did not move up in the first two turns.\n\nSo for a11 and a12, I must choose S or D, but from y=0, both keep y=0.\n\nSo essentially, I stay at y=0 for turns 11 and 12? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 11: y11=0, I choose a11 = S or D, both set y12=0.\n\nThen at turn 12: y12=0, I choose a12 = S or D, both set y13=0.\n\nThen at turn 13: y13=0, safe, not freeway.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9 from here.\n\nBut I wasted two turns, so H will be larger.\n\nMinimal H was 9, now with delay, at least 11 or more.\n\nBut perhaps I can make up time later.\n\ny=5-8 are safe, so I can go fast through them.\n\nNow, from turn 13, y=0.\n\nI need to avoid y=3 and y=4 at turn 15 and 16.\n\nTurn 15 is two turns from turn 13? Turn 13 to turn 15 is two steps.\n\nTurn 13: after action a13, y14 set.\n\nTurn 14: after a14, y15 set.\n\nTurn 15: y15 position.\n\nSimilarly, turn 16: y16 position.\n\nAt turn 15, I need y15 not 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly at turn 16, y16 not 3 or 4.\n\nNow, from y13=0, at turn 13.\n\nI need to reach high y quickly.\n\nBut constraints at turn 15 and 16.\n\nFirst, from turn 13, y13=0.\n\nAfter a13, y14 set.\n\nAfter a14, y15 set.\n\ny15 = y13 + Δy13 + Δy14 = 0 + a13 + a14\n\na13 and a14 each in {U,S,D}, but from y=0, D and S same, U to 1.\n\ny15 can be: min 0 (both S/D), max 2 (both U).\n\nSimilarly, y16 = y15 + Δy15.\n\nAt turn 15, I need y15 not 3 or 4, but y15 <=2 from above, so y15=0,1,2, all not 3 or 4, so automatically safe at turn 15, since y15<=2 <3.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 16, y16 position.\n\ny16 = y15 + Δy15\n\ny15 is 0,1, or 2.\n\nIf y15=0, y16 can be 0 or 1 (if U)\n\nIf y15=1, y16 can be 0,1,2\n\nIf y15=2, y16 can be 1,2,3\n\nAt turn 16, I need y16 not 3 or 4.\n\nIf y16=3 or 4, dangerous, else safe.\n\nNow, from above, y16 can be at most 3, if y15=2 and U.\n\ny16=3 is dangerous at turn 16 for y=3.\n\ny16=4 possible? From y15=2, U to 3, but y15<=2, so y16 <=3.\n\ny16=3 only if y15=2 and a15=U.\n\nThen at turn 16, y16=3, which is dangerous since y=3 dangerous at T=16.\n\nIf y16=0,1,2, safe.\n\nSo to avoid y16=3, I need that if y15=2, I do not go U to 3; instead go S or D to stay or decrease.\n\nBut I want to go up, so I might need to avoid being at y15=2 if I plan to go up, or go down.\n\nBut let's list possible paths.\n\nFrom turn 13, y=0.\n\nI need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut I have to pass through y=3 and y=4, but not at turn 15 or 16.\n\nTurn 15 and 16 are specific turns.\n\nNow, let's find when I can be on y=3 and y=4 safely.\n\ny=3 dangerous at T=15 and T=16, so safe only at other times.\n\nSimilarly y=4 dangerous at T=15,16.\n\nOther freeways safe except as above.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nFrom turn 13, y=0.\n\nI must choose actions to avoid y16=3 if it would be dangerous.\n\nBut first, let's go step by step.\n\nAt turn 13: y13=0, safe. I can choose a13.\n\nIf a13=U, y14=1\n\nIf a13=S or D, y14=0\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, turn 14: y14 position.\n\nIf y14=1, freeway 1, but freeway 1 dangerous only at T=13, not at other times.\n\nAt T=13 it was dangerous, but at turn 14, ΔT=14-11=3, for freeway 1, car span [48-36*3, 83-36*3] = [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same.\n\nSo y=1 at turn 14 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nNow, at turn 14, if I am on y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there.\n\nBut I need to handle turn 15 and 16.\n\nTurn 15: if on y=3 or 4, dangerous.\n\nTurn 16: same.\n\nNow from turn 13, y=0.\n\nI want to go up fast, so I should go U when possible.\n\nBut let's consider the time to reach y=9.\n\nAt turn 13, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which takes at least 9 turns from here, so minimal to reach at turn 22.\n\nBut perhaps I can do better if I had started moving earlier, but I had to stay at start.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, instead of staying, could I go down? But from y=0, I cannot go below 0, so same as stay.\n\nSo I must stay at y=0 for turns 11 and 12, so at turn 13 y=0.\n\nNow from turn 13, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nBut with constraints at turn 15 and 16.\n\nLet t be the turn number.\n\nt=13: y=0\n\nt=14: after a13, y14\n\nt=15: after a14, y15\n\nt=16: after a15, y16\n\nt=17: after a16, y17\n\netc.\n\nAt t=15, y15 must not be 3 or 4. Since from y=0 at t=13, in two steps, y15 <=2, so y15=0,1,2, all less than 3, so automatically not 3 or 4, so safe at t=15.\n\nSimilarly at t=16, y16 must not be 3 or 4.\n\ny16 = y15 + Δy15\n\ny15 <=2, so y16 <=3.\n\ny16=3 only if y15=2 and a15=U.\n\nIn that case, at t=16, y16=3, dangerous.\n\nOtherwise, if y15=2 and a15=S or D, y16=2 or 1, safe.\n\nOr if y15<2, y16<=2 or 3, but if y15=1, y16=0,1,2 if S or D, or 2 if U? y15=1, a15=U, y16=2; a15=S, y16=1; a15=D, y16=0.\n\nSo y16=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly if y15=0, y16=0 or 1.\n\nSo y16 can be 3 only if y15=2 and a15=U.\n\nTo avoid danger at t=16, I must not have y16=3, so I must avoid the case where y15=2 and a15=U.\n\nTherefore, if I am at y15=2, I must not go up to 3 at t=15; I should stay or go down.\n\nBut that might delay.\n\nI can choose to not be at y15=2.\n\ny15 depends on previous actions.\n\nFrom t=13 y=0, to t=15 y15.\n\ny15 = Δy13 + Δy14\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, but from y=0, if down or stay, Δy=0; up Δy=1.\n\nSo y15 = number of U in a13 and a14.\n\nPossible: 0,1,2.\n\nIf y15=0: both S or D at t=13 and t=14\n\ny15=1: one U and one S/D\n\ny15=2: both U\n\nNow, for t=16, if y15=2, and I do U, y16=3 dangerous, so I must not do U; I must do S or D, so y16=2 or 1.\n\nIf y15=1, y16 can be 0,1,2 all safe.\n\nIf y15=0, y16=0 or 1 safe.\n\nSo to minimize time, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being at y15=2 if I want to go up next, but since I have to avoid y16=3, I can be at y15=2 but then not go up.\n\nBut that means I stay at y=2 or go down, which is not progress.\n\nTo save time, it might be better to have y15=1 or 0, so that at t=15, I can go up to y16=2 or something.\n\nLet's plan the actions.\n\nI need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\ny=5-8 are always safe, so I can go through them fast.\n\nBut I need to get to y=5.\n\nFirst, from t=13 y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=3 and y=4, but not at t=15 or 16.\n\nt=15 and 16 are soon.\n\nFor example, at t=16, I cannot be on y=3 or 4.\n\nt=16 is only 3 turns from t=13.\n\nFrom t=13 y=0, to be at y=4, I need at least 4 steps, so at t=17 earliest.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=16 earliest, but at t=16, if y=3, dangerous.\n\nSo I can be on y=3 at turns other than 15 and 16.\n\nSimilarly for y=4.\n\nNow, let's list possible y over time.\n\nt=13: y=0 (fixed)\n\nt=14: after a13, can be 0 or 1\n\nt=15: after a14, can be 0,1,2 depending\n\nBut as above, y15 <=2\n\nt=16: after a15, y16 as above\n\nSince y15 <=2, y16 <=3\n\nAt t=16, y16 cannot be 3 or 4, but y16<=3, so only cannot be 3.\n\nThus, I must have y16 !=3.\n\nWhich means: if y15=2, I must not go U, so a15 must be S or D, so y16=2 or 1\n\nIf y15<2, y16 cannot be 3 anyway, so safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 fast, I should increase y as much as possible.\n\nFor example, at t=13, I can go U to y14=1\n\nThen at t=14, I can go U to y15=2\n\nBut at t=15, y15=2, then at t=15, I must not go U to avoid y16=3 at t=16, so I must choose S or D, say S, so y16=2\n\nOr D to y16=1, worse.\n\nSo y16=2\n\nThen at t=16, y16=2, safe, I can go U to y17=3\n\nAt t=17, y17=3, now is t=17 safe for y=3? Dangerous only at t=15,16, so t=17 is fine, since no danger.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up.\n\nBut y17=3, then U to y18=4, then U to y19=5, and so on.\n\nLet's list:\n\nt=13: y=0, a13=U, y14=1\n\nt=14: y=1, a14=U, y15=2\n\nt=15: y=2, must not go U, so a15=S (or D, but S better), y16=2\n\nt=16: y=2, a16=U, y17=3\n\nt=17: y=3, a17=U, y18=4\n\nt=18: y=4, a18=U, y19=5\n\nt=19: y=5, a19=U, y20=6\n\nt=20: y=6, a20=U, y21=7\n\nt=21: y=7, a21=U, y22=8\n\nt=22: y=8, a22=U, y23=9\n\nNow y23=9, so at turn 23, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=11, actions from t=11 to t=11+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{11+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, from t=13 y=0 to t=23 y=9, but t=13 is after two actions? Let's index properly.\n\nStart: t=11, y11=0\n\nAfter a11: y12, but we stayed, so y12=0\n\nAfter a12: y13=0\n\nThen a13: y14=1\n\na14: y15=2\n\na15: y16=2 (since S)\n\na16: y17=3\n\na17: y18=4\n\na18: y19=5\n\na19: y20=6\n\na20: y21=7\n\na21: y22=8\n\na22: y23=9\n\nSo y23=9, so after actions a11 to a22, that's 12 actions? t from 11 to 22 inclusive.\n\nActions: a11, a12, a13, ..., a22.\n\nThat's 12 actions: t=11 to t=22, 12 turns? t=11 to t=22 is 12 values.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=11 to t=22, that's 12 actions.\n\nThen y_{23}=9.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so τ=0 at t=11.\n\nAction at τ=0: a_{t1}\n\nτ=1: a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nτ=H-1: a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nAfter action at τ=H-1, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAt τ=0, t=11, y=0.\n\nAfter last action, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions from τ=0 to τ=11? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=0, t=11, action a11\n\nAfter a11, y12\n\n...\n\nAt τ=k, action at t=11+k\n\nAfter action at τ=k, y_{12+k}\n\nSet y_{11 + k} after action at τ=k-1? Better to use absolute t.\n\nStart t=11, y11=0\n\nAfter action a11, y12\n\nAfter a12, y13\n\n...\nAfter a22, y23=9\n\nSo actions a11 to a22, 12 actions.\n\nτ from 0 to 11, H=12.\n\nAfter action at τ=H-1=11, y_{11 + H} = y_{22}, no.\n\nt=11 + τ\n\nAction at τ, at time t=11+τ\n\nAfter action at τ, position y_{t+1} = y_{12+τ}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = y_{11+H} =9\n\nAfter action at τ=H-1, y_{t1 + H} =9\n\nIn this case, after a22 at t=22, y23=9, so t1 + H =23, 11+H=23, H=12.\n\nBut perhaps I can do better.\n\nIn the above, at t=15, I was at y=2, and I stayed, so I wasted a turn not increasing y.\n\nIf I can avoid that.\n\nFor example, if at t=15, I am not at y=2, so I can go up at t=15.\n\nFrom t=13 y=0, if I go up only once or not at all.\n\nFor example, at t=13, a13=S, y14=0\n\nThen at t=14, a14=U, y15=1\n\nThen at t=15, y15=1, safe, I can go U, y16=2\n\nAt t=16, y16=2, safe (not 3 or 4), I can go U, y17=3\n\nThen same as before, but I saved one turn? Let's see.\n\nt=13: y=0, a13=S, y14=0\n\nt=14: y=0? y14=0, a14=U, y15=1\n\nt=15: y=1, a15=U, y16=2\n\nt=16: y=2, a16=U, y17=3\n\nt=17: y=3, U, y18=4\n\nt=18: y=4, U, y19=5\n\nt=19: y=5, U, y20=6\n\nt=20: y=6, U, y21=7\n\nt=21: y=7, U, y22=8\n\nt=22: y=8, U, y23=9\n\nSame as before, y23=9, H=12.\n\nIn first sequence, I had y15=2, then stayed, y16=2, then up.\n\nHere y15=1, up to y16=2, same point.\n\nBut at t=16, I went up to y17=3, whereas before at t=16 I was at y16=2 going to y17=3.\n\nIn first sequence: t=16 y=2, a16=U, y17=3\n\nHere: t=16 y=2, a16=U, y17=3\n\nSame.\n\nBut in this sequence, I had a13=S, so I stayed at y=0 at t=14, whereas in first I had y14=1.\n\nBut both reach y=9 at t=23.\n\nNow, to save time, I need to be higher earlier.\n\nBut from t=13 y=0, I cannot be higher than y=2 at t=15.\n\nAt t=16, I can be y=3 only if I risk collision, but I cannot.\n\nUnless I am at y=3 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=3 at t=17 or later, which is safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, I need to start going up earlier, but I was forced to stay at start.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, instead of staying two turns, could I go down? But no, y=0, cannot go down.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=1 at turn 12, but at turn 13 I must not be on y=1 or 2, and at turn 12, if I am on y=1, it might be safe, but at turn 13 I need to not be there.\n\nLet's revisit the start.\n\nAt turn 11: y=0, safe.\n\nIf I go U at a11, then y12=1\n\nAt turn 12: y12=1, freeway 1. At T=12, as before, safe, since not dangerous time.\n\nThen at turn 12, I choose a12.\n\nIf I go U, y13=2, but at turn 13, y13=2, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I go S or D, y13=1, but at turn 13, y13=1, freeway 1, dangerous at T=13, collision.\n\nIf I go D, from y12=1, a12=D, y13=0.\n\nThen at turn 13, y13=0, safe.\n\nSo this is possible.\n\nSequence: a11=U, y12=1\n\nAt turn 12, y12=1, safe (as calculated)\n\na12=D, y13=0\n\nThen at turn 13, y13=0, safe.\n\nNow, compared to staying, I have y12=1 at one point, but I went down to y13=0.\n\nNow, from here, same as before, y13=0.\n\nBut I used one U and one D, net zero progress, same as two S.\n\nBut now I have to go from y13=0 to y=9.\n\nSame as before, 10 steps to y=9? From y13=0 to y=9, min 9 steps, arrive at t=22.\n\nt=13 y=0\n\nAfter 9 actions, y_{22}=9?

Min 6 steps from y=3 to y=9, arrive at t=23 if start from t=17.\n\ny17=3, to y23=9 in 6 steps.\n\nBut with the stay at t=15, I have delay.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=15 I stayed at y=2.\n\nBut if at t=15 I am not at y=2, I can go up.\n\nFor example, from t=13 y=0, a13=S, y14=0\n\na14=U, y15=1\n\nThen at t=15, y15=1, I can go U, a15=U, y16=2\n\nAt t=16, y16=2, not 3, safe, I can go U, a16=U, y17=3\n\nThen same as before.\n\ny17=3 at t=17, then to y=9 at t=23.\n\nNo gain.\n\nAt t=15, y15=1, go U to y16=2 at t=16.\n\nThen at t=16, y16=2, go U to y17=3 at t=17.\n\nSame.\n\nBut at t=16, I am at y=2, which is safe, and I go up.\n\nNow, to save a turn, I need to reach a higher y earlier.\n\nBut from t=13, I can only reach y=2 at t=15, y=3 at t=16 earliest but cannot because of danger, so y=3 at t=17 earliest.\n\nThen from y=3 to y=9, 6 steps, arrive at t=23.\n\nUnless I can be at y=4 or higher earlier, but from y=0 at t=13, to y=4 at t=17 earliest: t=13 y0, t14 y1, t15 y2, t16 y3, t17 y4.\n\nAt t=16, if y=3, dangerous, so I cannot have y=3 at t=16, so I cannot reach y=4 at t=17 because I need to be at y=3 at t=16, which is forbidden.\n\nThe only way to have y=4 at t=17 is to have y16=3 or 4 or 5, but y16<=3, and if y16=3, danger, so I must have y16<=2, then y17<=3, so at t=17, y17<=3.\n\nSo I cannot have y=4 at t=17; earliest at t=18 if I go up fast.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nIn all cases, from y=0 at t=13, I can only reach y=9 at t=23 with 10 actions from there, but including the actions from t=11 and t=12.\n\nEarlier with a11 and a12, I have two actions, then from t=13 to t=22, 10 actions, total 12 actions to y23=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut perhaps I can reduce by one if I can avoid the stay.\n\nAnother idea: at t=15, if I am at y=2, I could go down to y16=1, but that would make me slower.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr, I can go to y=3 at t=17, but then through y=5-8 fast.\n\nBut y=5-8 are safe, so I can go U every turn from there.\n\nBut from y=3 to y=9, 6 turns, arrive at t=23 if start from t=17.\n\ny17=3, a17=U, y18=4, a18=U, y19=5, ..., a22=U, y23=9.\n\nt=23.\n\nIf I can be at y=3 earlier, but I can't because of t=16 constraint.\n\nt=14: y14 can be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y14=1, at t=14.\n\nThen a14, y15.\n\nIf a14=U, y15=2\n\nIf a14=S, y15=1\n\nIf a14=D, y15=0\n\nThen at t=15, y15 as above.\n\nThen y16, etc.\n\nNo way to be higher.\n\nSo minimal H is 12, with y reached at t=23.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a shorter path.\n\nSuppose at the start, I go U at t=11 to y12=1.\n\nThen at t=12, instead of going D, I go S, but then y13=1, which at t=13 is dangerous, collision.\n\nOr go U, y13=2, collision at t=13.\n\nSo only choices are go D to y13=0 or stay, but from y12=1, S or D both to y13=1 or 0, but S to 1, danger, D to 0 safe.\n\nSo must go D to avoid collision.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I can choose to stay or go down at certain points, but to minimize time, I should go up when possible.\n\nFrom t=13, I should go up except when forced to stay at t=15 if at y=2.\n\nBut I can avoid being at y=2 at t=15 by going up less.\n\nFor example, if at t=13 I go S, y14=0, then at t=14 go U, y15=1, then at t=15 go U, y16=2, then at t=16 go U, y17=3, etc., same time.\n\nOr if I go U at t=13 to y14=1, then at t=14 go S, y15=1, then at t=15 go U, y16=2, then t=16 go U, y17=3, same.\n\nIn terms of number of U, I need 9 ups from y=0 to y=9, but since I had a net zero from t=11 to t=13, I need 9 ups from t=13 on.\n\nFrom t=13 to t=22, 10 turns, I can have 9 U and one S or D.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=15, I had a S, for example.\n\nIn other sequences, I might have a S at t=14 or something, but still 9 U and one non-U.\n\nThe non-U is necessary to avoid the danger at t=16.\n\nSo H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nAlso, I need to handle y=3 and y=4, but in this path, I go through y=3 at t=17, y=4 at t=18, which are safe.\n\ny=3 dangerous at t=15,16, not at t=17.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, freeway 5-8 always safe, so no issue.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 3 and 4 have cars that are dangerous at t=15,16, but I won't be on them at that time.\n\nSo ok.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence.\n\nI can choose any sequence as long as I avoid the dangers.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 11: action U\n\nThen turn 12: action D (to avoid collision at t=13)\n\nThen turn 13: action U\n\nTurn 14: action U (to y15=2)\n\nBut at t=15, y=2, I need to not go U, so action S or D.\n\nSay S to stay.\n\nThen turn 15: action S\n\nThen turn 16: action U (to y17=3)\n\nThen from there up every turn.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S  (since at y=2, cannot go U)\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U  (y18=4)\n\ny17=3, U to y18=4\n\nTurn 18: U (y19=5)\n\nTurn 19: U (y20=6)\n\nTurn 20: U (y21=7)\n\nTurn 21: U (y22=8)\n\nTurn 22: U (y23=9)\n\nNow, after action at turn 22, y23=9.\n\nH=12 actions, from turn 11 to turn 22.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =22, so 11 + H -1 =22, 10 + H =22, H=12.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 15: S, but I could do D, but S is better, no move.\n\nTo make it with fewer non-U, but I have to have one non-U in the sequence.\n\nAnother sequence: at turn 13, S; turn 14, U; turn 15, U; turn 16, U; but at turn 16, if I go U from y=2 to y=3, but at t=16, y=3 dangerous.\n\nIn this: if turn 13: S, y14=0\n\nTurn 14: U, y15=1\n\nTurn 15: U, y16=2\n\nAt t=16, y16=2, safe, I can go U, a16=U, y17=3\n\nThen same.\n\nNo problem, but at turn 15, y15=1, I go U to y16=2, not directly to 3.\n\ny16=2 at t=16, then to y17=3.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns starting from t_1=11.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nAfter Turn 22: U, position y23=9.\n\nIn the sequence, Turn 15: S, which is necessary to avoid going to y=3 at t=16.\n\nI could have Turn 15: D, but that would make y16=1, then I need more ups, worse.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nNow, about freeways 3 and 4, I pass through y=3 at t=17, y=4 at t=18, which are safe.\n\nAt t=17, for y=3, ΔT = T - t_1 =17-11=6\n\nFreeway 3: cars, only the third one was dangerous at T=15,16.\n\nAt T=17, ΔT=6, for the car (-24,-35,right,6), span [-35 +6*6, -24 +6*6] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nSimilarly at t=18, y=4, same, safe.\n\ny=5-8 no issue.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=12.\n\nThe sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the initial, for freeway 1 and 2, only at t=13 dangerous, which we avoided.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12, meaning the sequence consists of 12 actions from turn 11 to turn 22, resulting in position \\(y_{23} = 9\\).\n\n### Key Constraints and Reasoning:\n- **Dangerous Freeways and Turns**:\n  - Freeways 1 and 2 are dangerous only at turn 13 (due to car collisions at \\(x=0\\)).\n  - Freeways 3 and 4 are dangerous at turns 15 and 16 (due to car collisions at \\(x=0\\)).\n  - Freeways 5 to 8 are always safe, as no cars cover \\(x=0\\) at any turn.\n- **Initial Actions to Avoid Turn 13 Collision**:\n  - At turn 11, \\(y_{11} = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y_{12} = 1\\).\n  - At turn 12, \\(y_{12} = 1\\) (freeway 1, but safe at turn 12 as no collision). Action \\(D\\) (or \\(S\\)) is required to avoid \\(y_{13} = 1\\) or \\(2\\) at turn 13, which would cause collision. Choosing \\(D\\) sets \\(y_{13} = 0\\) (safe).\n- **Avoiding Turns 15 and 16 Collision**:\n  - From turn 13, \\(y_{13} = 0\\), progress upward is made, but \\(y_{15}\\) must not be 3 or 4 (safe as \\(y_{15} \\leq 2\\) from start).\n  - At turn 15, \\(y_{15} = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe at turn 15). Action \\(S\\) is chosen (instead of \\(U\\)) to avoid \\(y_{16} = 3\\) at turn 16, which would cause collision on freeway 3. Thus, \\(y_{16} = 2\\) (safe).\n- **Rapid Ascent Through Safe Zones**:\n  - From turn 16 onward, \\(U\\) actions are used to ascend quickly through freeways 3 to 8, which are safe at the relevant turns (e.g., \\(y = 3\\) at turn 17 and \\(y = 4\\) at turn 18 are not dangerous turns).\n  - Freeways 5 to 8 are always safe, allowing uninterrupted upward movement.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence minimizes \\(H = 12\\) turns. Each action is chosen to avoid collisions and reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible.\n\n- Turn 11: \\(U\\) (sets \\(y_{12} = 1\\))\n- Turn 12: \\(D\\) (sets \\(y_{13} = 0\\), avoids collision at turn 13)\n- Turn 13: \\(U\\) (sets \\(y_{14} = 1\\))\n- Turn 14: \\(U\\) (sets \\(y_{15} = 2\\))\n- Turn 15: \\(S\\) (sets \\(y_{16} = 2\\), avoids collision at turn 16)\n- Turn 16: \\(U\\) (sets \\(y_{17} = 3\\))\n- Turn 17: \\(U\\) (sets \\(y_{18} = 4\\))\n- Turn 18: \\(U\\) (sets \\(y_{19} = 5\\))\n- Turn 19: \\(U\\) (sets \\(y_{20} = 6\\))\n- Turn 20: \\(U\\) (sets \\(y_{21} = 7\\))\n- Turn 21: \\(U\\) (sets \\(y_{22} = 8\\))\n- Turn 22: \\(U\\) (sets \\(y_{23} = 9\\))\n\nAfter the action at turn 22, \\(y_{23} = 9\\), achieving the goal in \\(H = 12\\) turns.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Collision Checks**:\n  - Turn 12: \\(y = 1\\), freeway 1; cars at \\(\\Delta T = 1\\): span \\([12, 47]\\), 0 not in span (safe).\n  - Turn 13: \\(y = 0\\), not a freeway (safe).\n  - Turn 14: \\(y = 1\\), freeway 1; \\(\\Delta T = 3\\): span \\([-60, -25]\\), 0 not in span (safe).\n  - Turn 15: \\(y = 2\\), freeway 2; \\(\\Delta T = 4\\): span \\([-96, -61]\\), 0 not in span (safe).\n  - Turn 16: \\(y = 2\\), freeway 2; \\(\\Delta T = 5\\): span \\([-132, -97]\\), 0 not in span (safe).\n  - Turn 17: \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3; \\(\\Delta T = 6\\): for car \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 6)\\), span \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in span; other cars not covering 0 (safe).\n  - Turn 18: \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4; similarly safe as turn 17.\n  - Turns 19-22: \\(y = 5\\) to \\(8\\), freeways 5-8 always safe.\n- **Efficiency**: Any fewer than 12 turns would require reaching \\(y=9\\) earlier (e.g., turn 22), but the constraints at turns 13, 15, and 16 necessitate delays (e.g., the \\(S\\) at turn 15). Thus, \\(H = 12\\) is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 13, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nPlayer movement:\n  U: y += 1\n  D: y -= 1\n  S: y stays\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at the same time the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nNote: When moving from freeway y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still on freeway y. Then at turn T+1, the player is on freeway y'. So when moving, the player is only at the new freeway starting from the next turn.\n\nWe start at y=0 (which is not a freeway) at turn 13. We want to end at y=9 (also not a freeway) so we don't care about cars at y=9.\n\nWe must avoid the freeways 1-8 when we are on them at a turn and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nThe cars are given for each freeway. Note that for freeways 1 and 2, there is one car each (left-moving). For freeways 3 and 4, there are three cars each (right-moving). For freeways 5,6,7,8, there is one car each (right-moving).\n\nWe need to compute the car positions at any future turn T (relative to t1=13, so T = 13, 14, 15, ...). The time elapsed since t1 is (T - 13).\n\nCar update:\n\nFor a left-moving car (d = left): \n  At turn T: \n      head(T) = h0 - s*(T - t1)\n      tail(T) = tau0 - s*(T - t1)\n\nFor a right-moving car (d = right):\n  At turn T:\n      head(T) = h0 + s*(T - t1)\n      tail(T) = tau0 + s*(T - t1)\n\nBut note: for a left-moving car, the span is [head, tail] but since the car is moving left, the head is the rightmost part? Actually, the problem states for left-moving: initial span is [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(dt), tau - s*(dt)]. And for right-moving: initial span is [tau, h] and becomes [tau + s*(dt), h + s*(dt)]. \n\nSo for left-moving, the car is from tau to h (with tau < h) and moving left. So at time T, the car is from (tau0 - s*(T-t1)) to (h0 - s*(T-t1)).\n\nFor right-moving, the car is from tau to h (with tau < h) and moving right. So at time T, the car is from (tau0 + s*(T-t1)) to (h0 + s*(T-t1)).\n\nCollision occurs if the player is on freeway k at turn T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are starting at (0,0) at turn 13. We can only move up (to y=1) or stay (remain at y=0). We cannot move down because we are at y=0.\n\nWe want the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) but note that the turn is increasing and we are only concerned with the relative time from t1. The state is (t, y) where t is the turn (t>=13) and y in [0,9]. We start at (13,0). We want to reach any (t,9) with minimal t-13.\n\nBut note that the car positions change with time, so we must compute for each freeway and each time whether there is a car at 0.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each time T (>=13) whether there is a car at 0 on that freeway at time T.\n\nHowever, note that we are only concerned with the times when the player is on that freeway. Also, we can compute the condition for each car on a freeway: the condition for a car to cover 0 at time T.\n\nLet dt = T - 13.\n\nFor freeway 1: one left-moving car: h0=-24, tau0=11, s=36.\n  At time T, the car spans from: 11 - 36*dt to -24 - 36*dt? \n  But wait: the initial state is (h,tau) = (-24,11) for a left-moving. The problem says: for left-moving, initial span is [h, tau] = [-24, 11]. But that doesn't make sense because -24 < 11, so the car would be from -24 to 11? However, the problem says for left-moving: the update is [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So at dt=0: [-24, 11]. Then at dt=1: [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25]. \n\nBut note: the problem states the car is moving left, so the entire car moves left. We are interested in whether 0 is in the interval [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. However, note that the problem says for left-moving: the span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. Since h=-24 and tau=11, and the car moves left, the span at time T is [ -24 - 36*dt, 11 - 36*dt ].\n\nBut this interval is from a lower number to a higher number? Actually, -24 -36*dt is less than 11-36*dt? Yes, because -24 < 11. So the interval is [min, max] = [ -24-36*dt, 11-36*dt ].\n\nSo 0 is in the interval if:\n  -24 -36*dt <= 0 <= 11 -36*dt\n\nBut note: 11 -36*dt is decreasing and -24-36*dt is decreasing. We can solve:\n\n  -24 -36*dt <= 0  => -36*dt <= 24 => dt >= -24/36 = -2/3 -> always true for dt>=0? Actually, at dt=0: -24<=0 -> true, and 0<=11 -> true. So at dt=0, the car covers 0? \n\nBut wait: at turn 13 (dt=0), the car on freeway 1 is at [-24, 11]. So 0 is between -24 and 11? Yes. So freeway 1 at turn 13 has a car at 0? Then if the player is on freeway 1 at turn 13, there would be a collision.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same car: [-24,11] at dt=0 -> covers 0.\n\nFor freeway 3: three right-moving cars. For a right-moving car, the initial span is [tau, h]? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: initial span is [tau, h] and then becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. \n\nThe cars on freeway 3:\n  (60,49,right,6): initial span [49,60]? But the problem says: (head h, tail tau) and then for right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt]. So the first car: h=60, tau=49 -> initial span [49,60]? Then at time T: [49+6*dt, 60+6*dt]. This car covers 0? 49+6*dt <= 0 <=60+6*dt? But 49+6*dt is at least 49>0, so never covers 0.\n\n  (24,13,right,6): initial span [13,24] -> [13+6*dt,24+6*dt]. Since 13>0, and increasing, never covers 0.\n\n  (-12,-23,right,6): initial span? Here h=-12, tau=-23? Then the initial span is [tau, h] = [-23, -12]. Then at time T: [-23+6*dt, -12+6*dt]. We need to check if 0 is in [-23+6*dt, -12+6*dt]?\n      -23+6*dt <= 0 <= -12+6*dt\n      The first inequality: 6*dt <= 23 -> dt <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833 -> so dt=0,1,2,3\n      The second: 0 <= -12+6*dt -> 6*dt>=12 -> dt>=2.\n\n      So for dt=2,3: \n        dt=2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is included? Note: the interval is [min, max] = [-11,0]. So 0 is included? Yes, because the car includes the endpoint? The problem doesn't specify if it's open or closed. But typically in such problems, the span is inclusive. So at dt=2: the car is from -11 to 0 -> so 0 is included.\n\n      Similarly, dt=3: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6] -> 0 is included.\n\n      But note: at dt=2: T = 13+2 = 15; at dt=3: T=16.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3? The same three cars? Then same times: freeway 4 has a car at 0 at T=15 and 16.\n\nFreeway 5: one car (60,49,right,6): [49,60] -> [49+6*dt,60+6*dt] -> never covers 0.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: never covers 0.\n\nFreeway 7: same: never covers 0.\n\nFreeway 8: same: never covers 0.\n\nBut wait: freeway 3 and 4 have cars that cover 0 at T=15 and 16.\n\nAlso, freeway 1 and 2 at T=13 (dt=0) cover 0.\n\nNow, let's compute for freeway 1 and 2 at future times:\n\nFreeway 1: left-moving car: [ -24-36*dt, 11-36*dt ]\n  0 is in the interval if:\n      -24-36*dt <= 0 <= 11-36*dt\n  => \n      -24 <= 36*dt   [always true for dt>=0] and\n      36*dt >= 11? -> no, the second inequality: 0 <= 11-36*dt -> 36*dt <= 11 -> dt <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305 -> so only at dt=0? \n\n  So only at T=13 (dt=0) the car on freeway 1 covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same, only at T=13.\n\nBut wait: at dt=0, we have 0 in [ -24, 11]? Yes. At dt=1: [ -24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25] -> 0 is not in there.\n\nSo freeway 1 and 2 are safe for T>=14.\n\nNow freeway 3 and 4: we have three cars. The first two never cover 0. The third one: \n  [-23+6*dt, -12+6*dt] covers 0 for dt=2 and dt=3 (i.e., T=15,16).\n\nSo freeway 3 and 4 are unsafe at T=15 and 16? Actually, the problem says: if there is any car on the freeway that covers 0 at that turn, then collision. So at T=15 and 16, freeway 3 and 4 are unsafe.\n\nFreeways 5-8: safe at all times.\n\nNow, the player starts at (13,0). We must move to y=1 at some point to get to 9.\n\nBut at T=13, if we move to y=1 (by action U at T=13), then at turn 13 we are still at y=0 (because we move at the end of the turn? Actually, the update: at turn t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta. So at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then at the next turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, at turn 13: we are at y=0. We choose an action. If we choose U, then at turn 14 we will be at y=1.\n\nBut note: at turn 13, we are at y=0 -> no collision (because freeways are 1-8). At turn 14, we are at y=1 -> freeway 1. And we need to check freeway 1 at turn 14: safe? Because at turn 14 (dt=1) the car on freeway1 is at [-60,-25] -> no 0. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose S at turn13, we remain at y=0 at turn14.\n\nOur goal: get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can move up as fast as possible? But we must avoid freeways 3 and 4 at T=15 and 16.\n\nConsider the timeline:\n\nTurn 13 (t0=13): at y=0.\n\nWe can choose:\n  Option 1: U -> then at turn14: y=1.\n  Option 2: S -> then at turn14: y=0.\n\nWe want minimal H, so we prefer moving up quickly.\n\nBut note: if we go up at turn13, then at turn14 we are at y=1 (freeway1, which is safe at T=14). Then at turn14 we can go U again: to y=2 at turn15.\n\nAt turn15: we are at y=2 -> freeway2. Freeway2 at T=15 (dt=2): the car is at [-24-36*2, 11-36*2] = [-24-72, 11-72] = [-96, -61] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn15 we can go U: to y=3 at turn16.\n\nBut at turn16: we are at freeway3. And freeway3 at T=16 (dt=3) is unsafe? Because the third car on freeway3 at T=16: [-23+6*3, -12+6*3] = [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in there? But wait: the player is at freeway3 at T=16. The car is at [-5,6] at T=16. But the player is at x=0? And the car spans from x=-5 to x=6? Then 0 is in the car? So collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway3 at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on freeway4 at T=16.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway3 at T=16 if we are at y=3 at turn16.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway3 and freeway4 at T=15 and T=16.\n\nWhat are the unsafe (turn, freeway) pairs?\n  Freeway1: only unsafe at T=13 (but we are at y=0 at T=13, so not on freeway1 then) -> actually we are never on freeway1 at T=13? Because at T=13 we are at y=0. So freeway1 is unsafe only at T=13 but we are not on it then. Then at T>=14, freeway1 is safe.\n\n  Freeway2: same -> unsafe only at T=13 -> and we are not on it then. So freeway2 is safe for T>=14.\n\n  Freeway3: unsafe at T=15 and T=16.\n  Freeway4: unsafe at T=15 and T=16.\n\n  Freeway5-8: safe at all times.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeway3 or freeway4 at turn15 and turn16.\n\nWe can be on freeway3 and freeway4 at other times, or avoid them altogether? But we have to go through them to get to y=9.\n\nWe start at y=0 (T=13). We want to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: we need at least 9 moves (if we only go up). But we might have to wait or detour? \n\nWe can try to plan:\n\nOption: move up as fast as possible until we hit the danger zone.\n\nBut at T=16 we must not be on freeway3 or freeway4. So we must not be at y=3 or y=4 at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, at T=15 we must not be at y=3 or y=4.\n\nBut note: at T=15, if we are at y=2, that's safe (freeway2, which is safe at T=15). At T=15, we can be at y=5? Then freeway5 is safe.\n\nWe have:\n\nTurn 13: y0 = 0\nTurn 14: y1 = ? \nTurn 15: y2 = ?\nTurn 16: y3 = ?\nTurn 17: y4 = ?\n\nWe must avoid:\n  At T=15: y2 must not be 3 or 4.\n  At T=16: y3 must not be 3 or 4.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go up every time, then:\n  T13: y=0\n  T14: y=1 (action U at T13)\n  T15: y=2 (action U at T14)\n  T16: y=3 -> unsafe! (because at T16 we are at freeway3) -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nWe can try:\n\nAt T14: y=1 (by U at T13)\nAt T15: we can go S (stay at y=1) or D (go down to y=0) or U (to y=2). \n  If we go U at T14: then at T15 we are at y=2 -> safe (freeway2 is safe at T15).\n  Then at T16: we want to avoid being at y=3 or 4. So we can go S at T15 (stay at y=2) or go U to y=3 (but unsafe) or go D to y=1.\n\n  If we go U at T15: then at T16 we are at y=3 -> unsafe.\n\n  So we must not go U at T15. We can go S: then at T16 we are at y=2 -> safe (freeway2). Then at T16, we can go U to y=3 at T17? But then at T17, freeway3: we must check if at T17 (dt=4) the car on freeway3: \n      The third car: [-23+6*4, -12+6*4] = [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe? \n      The other cars: [49+6*4,60+6*4] = [73,84] -> safe; [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe.\n      So freeway3 is safe at T17.\n\n  Similarly, freeway4 at T17: same.\n\nSo we can do:\n  T13: U -> y=1 at T14\n  T14: U -> y=2 at T15\n  T15: S -> stay at y=2 at T16 (so we avoid freeway3 and 4 at T15 and T16? Actually at T15 we are at y=2 (freeway2, safe) and at T16 we are at y=2 (freeway2, safe).\n  Then T16: U -> to y=3 at T17 -> freeway3 at T17: safe (as computed).\n  Then T17: U -> to y=4 at T18 -> freeway4 at T18: check the third car: [-23+6*(18-13)= -23+30=7, -12+30=18] -> [7,18] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  Then T18: U -> to y=5 at T19 -> freeway5: safe.\n  Then T19: U -> to y=6 at T20\n  T20: U -> to y=7 at T21\n  T21: U -> to y=8 at T22\n  T22: U -> to y=9 at T23.\n\nTotal turns: from T13 to T23: 10 actions? But we count the actions: \n  Actions at T13, T14, T15, T16, T17, T18, T19, T20, T21, T22 -> 10 actions? Then H=10? But the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: so H=10 turns? Then we end at T13+10-1 = T22? And at T22 we are at y=9? \n\nBut we started at T13 at y=0. Then after 10 actions (at T13, T14, ... T22) we end at T23? Actually, the state at turn t is after the action of turn t-1? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\nAt turn t (say t=13): we are at y=0. Then we choose an action a_13. Then at turn 14, we are at y1 = y0 + Delta.\n\nSo the position at turn t is determined before the action at turn t.\n\nWe start at turn 13: y=0.\nAfter action a_13 (at the end of turn13) we get y at turn14.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at some turn T. Then the last action is at turn T-1.\n\nIn the sequence, we write actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until we reach at turn t1+H-1 the last action, and then at the next turn we are at y=9.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal number of actions.\n\nIn the above plan, we have 10 actions? Then we would end at turn 13+10 = T23? Actually, the turns for actions: \n  Action at T13 -> leads to T14: y=1\n  Action at T14 -> leads to T15: y=2\n  ...\n  Action at T22 -> leads to T23: y=9.\n\nSo we need 10 actions? But we can do better?\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the delay. For example, at T15 we are at y=2. Instead of staying, we could move up at T15 to y=3 at T16? But that is unsafe. Or we could move down? But that would take more moves.\n\nAnother idea: at T15 we are at y=2. Then at T16 we move to y=1 (by D) -> then we are at freeway1 at T16: safe? Then at T17 we move up to y=2, then T18 to y=3, etc. That would be slower.\n\nSo the above plan (with a wait at T15) is 10 actions.\n\nBut can we get to y=9 faster? \n\nWe must avoid freeway3 and 4 at T15 and T16. So we cannot be at y=3 or 4 at T15 and T16.\n\nWe can try to be at y=5 by T16? \n\nHow?\n\nAt T13: U -> T14: y=1\nAt T14: U -> T15: y=2\nAt T15: we can only move up to y=3 (unsafe at T16) or stay at y=2 or move down to y=1. So we cannot get to y=5 at T16.\n\nAlternatively, we can move faster initially? But we start at y=0 at T13. To get to y=5 at T16, we would need 5 moves in 3 actions? Impossible because each move only changes by 1.\n\nWe can only do one move per turn.\n\nSo the minimal time to get to y=9 is 9 moves (if no waiting). But we have to wait at least one turn? Because we must avoid T16 at y=3.\n\nIn the above plan, we waited at T15 (stayed at y=2) and then continued. That took 10 moves.\n\nBut note: we could also wait at a different freeway? For example, at T14 we go to y=1, then at T15 we go to y=2, then at T16 we go to y=3? But that is unsafe at T16.\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid freeway3 and 4 altogether by going faster? We cannot.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go down? For example, at T14 we go to y=1, then at T15 we go down to y=0? Then we avoid freeway2 at T15? But then we are at y=0 at T15. Then we can go up again. But that would be slower.\n\nSo the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let me check if we can do 9.\n\nTo do 9 moves: we would be at y=9 at turn 13+9 = T22? How? \n  T13: action -> T14: y=?\n  ...\n  T21: action -> T22: y=9.\n\nWe need 9 actions: a13 to a21.\n\nThe path: \n  T13: U -> T14: y=1\n  T14: U -> T15: y=2\n  T15: U -> T16: y=3 -> unsafe! (because at T16, freeway3 is unsafe)\n\n  Alternatively, T15: we do not go U. Then at T16 we are at y=2? Then we need to go from y=2 to y=9 in 6 moves (from T16 to T22: 6 actions: T16 to T21) -> that would require 7 moves? Because 9-2=7 moves, but 6 actions? Then we would be at y=2+7=9 at T22? But 7 moves in 6 actions: impossible. So we must have at least 7 moves from y=2 to y=9, which requires 7 actions (each action gives one move). So from T16 to T22 (6 actions) we can only get to y=2+6=8. Then we need one more action to get to 9.\n\n  So total actions: from T13 to T21: 9 actions? \n      T13: U -> T14: y=1\n      T14: U -> T15: y=2\n      T15: S -> T16: y=2   [action S at T15: we wait at y=2]\n      T16: U -> T17: y=3\n      T17: U -> T18: y=4\n      T18: U -> T19: y=5\n      T19: U -> T20: y=6\n      T20: U -> T21: y=7\n      T21: U -> T22: y=8 -> not 9.\n\n  Then we need one more: T22: U -> T23: y=9 -> so 10 actions.\n\nBut we can try to skip the wait? \n\nWhat if we are at y=5 at T16? Then we can avoid the danger? How to get to y=5 at T16?\n\nFrom T13: \n  T13: U -> T14: y=1\n  T14: U -> T15: y=2\n  T15: we cannot go U (because then T16: y=3 -> unsafe) and we cannot go two moves at once. So we cannot get to y=5 at T16.\n\nAlternatively, we start by staying? \n  T13: S -> T14: y=0\n  T14: U -> T15: y=1\n  T15: U -> T16: y=2 -> safe? Then at T16: we are at y=2. Then we need to go to 9: 7 moves in 7 actions? Then we end at T23: y=9? So total actions: 9? \n      Actions: T13, T14, T15, T16, T17, T18, T19, T20, T21, T22 -> 10 actions? \n      Because: \n          T13: S -> T14: y0=0 -> y14=0? \n          Then T14: U -> T15: y=1\n          T15: U -> T16: y=2\n          T16: U -> T17: y=3\n          T17: U -> T18: y=4\n          T18: U -> T19: y=5\n          T19: U -> T20: y=6\n          T20: U -> T21: y=7\n          T21: U -> T22: y=8\n          T22: U -> T23: y=9.\n\n  That's 10 actions.\n\nBut we started with a wait at T13. Then we are at y=0 at T14. Then we go up. Then we are at y=2 at T16. Then we go up. But note: at T17: we are at freeway3? At T17: dt=4 -> freeway3: the third car: [-23+6*4, -12+6*4]=[1,12] -> does not include 0? So safe. Similarly, at T18: freeway4: same: [-23+6*5, -12+6*5] = [7,18] -> safe.\n\nSo that's 10 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to do 9 actions? \n\nWe need to be at y=9 at T22 (since T13 + 9 actions: last action at T21, then at T22 we are at y=9).\n\nWe start at T13: y=0.\n\nAfter 9 actions (T13 to T21) we want at T22: y=9.\n\nThe moves: we must have 9 moves upward? But we can also move down? But that would require more moves. So we need exactly 9 moves upward? \n\nBut we have to avoid the danger at T15 and T16 at freeway3 and 4.\n\nWe must be at y=0 at T13.\nAt T14: we can be y=0 (if S) or y=1 (if U).\nAt T15: we can be y=0,1,2.\nAt T16: we can be y=0,1,2,3.\n\nBut we must avoid y=3 and y=4 at T15? Actually, at T15: we are at freeway if y in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. But the only constraint is that at T15 we must not be at y=3 or y=4? Actually, the constraint is for freeway3 and 4: so only if we are at freeway3 (y=3) or freeway4 (y=4) at T15, then we crash? And similarly at T16.\n\nSo at T15: we can be at y=0,1,2,5,6,7,8? But we start at y=0 and we can only move one per turn. How to get to y=5 at T15? \n  T13: U -> T14: y=1\n  T14: U -> T15: y=2 -> that's the maximum we can get at T15.\n\nSo we cannot be at y>=5 at T15.\n\nSimilarly, at T16: we can be at y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6? But we cannot be at y=3 or 4. So we can be at y=0,1,2,5,6.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at T16: \n  T13: U -> T14: y=1\n  T14: U -> T15: y=2\n  T15: U -> T16: y=3 -> unsafe, so we cannot do that.\n\n  Alternatively, T15: we go two moves? No, we can only one move per turn.\n\nSo the only safe y at T16 are 0,1,2,5,6. But we can only get to y=0,1,2 at T16? Because:\n  If we start at T13: y=0.\n  Then T14: max y=1.\n  Then T15: max y=2.\n  Then T16: max y=3 (but unsafe) or we can do less: y=2 (if we stay at T15) or y=1 (if we go down) or y=0 (if we go down twice?).\n\nSo we cannot get to y=5 at T16.\n\nTherefore, we must have a delay. The minimal number of actions is 10.\n\nNow, the plan:\n\nWe have two possibilities:\n\nPlan A (wait at T15 at y=2):\n  T13: U -> T14: y=1\n  T14: U -> T15: y=2\n  T15: S -> T16: y=2   [wait]\n  T16: U -> T17: y=3   [now safe: freeway3 at T17: dt=4 -> third car: [1,12] -> 0 not in]\n  T17: U -> T18: y=4   [freeway4 at T18: dt=5 -> third car: [7,18] -> safe]\n  T18: U -> T19: y=5\n  T19: U -> T20: y=6\n  T20: U -> T21: y=7\n  T21: U -> T22: y=8\n  T22: U -> T23: y=9\n\nTotal actions: 10.\n\nPlan B (wait at T13 at y=0):\n  T13: S -> T14: y=0\n  T14: U -> T15: y=1\n  T15: U -> T16: y=2\n  T16: U -> T17: y=3   [safe: freeway3 at T17: dt=4 -> safe]\n  T17: U -> T18: y=4   [freeway4 at T18: safe]\n  T18: U -> T19: y=5\n  ... same as above until T22: U -> T23: y=9.\n\nAlso 10 actions.\n\nBut note: in Plan A, we get to y=2 at T15, then wait. In Plan B, we wait at the start.\n\nBoth are 10 actions.\n\nBut we might avoid one of the moves? Actually, we have to make 9 upward moves and one wait (which is an S). So total 10 actions.\n\nIs there a way to do 10 actions without waiting? For example, by moving down and then up? But that would require the same or more moves.\n\nSo we choose the first plan.\n\nBut let me check the freeways at the moments we are on them:\n\nPlan A:\n  T14: y=1 -> freeway1: at T14 (dt=1): car is at [-24-36,11-36]=[-60,-25] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  T15: y=2 -> freeway2: at T15 (dt=2): car at [-24-72,11-72]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\n  T16: y=2 -> freeway2: at T16 (dt=3): car at [-24-108,11-108]=[-132,-97] -> safe.\n  T17: y=3 -> freeway3: at T17 (dt=4): \n        car1: [49+6*4,60+6*4]=[73,84] -> safe.\n        car2: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe.\n        car3: [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12] -> safe (0 not in).\n  T18: y=4 -> freeway4: at T18 (dt=5):\n        same as above: car3: [-23+30, -12+30]=[7,18] -> safe.\n  T19: y=5 -> freeway5: safe (no car at 0 ever).\n  ... and so on.\n\nSo Plan A is safe.\n\nPlan B:\n  T14: y=0 -> not a freeway.\n  T15: y=1 -> freeway1: at T15 (dt=2): car at [-24-72,11-72]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\n  T16: y=2 -> freeway2: at T16 (dt=3): same as above -> safe.\n  T17: y=3 -> same as above -> safe.\n  ...\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nBut we can choose either. Since the problem doesn't specify which one, we can choose the one that moves earlier.\n\nBut note: in Plan A, we are at y=1 at T14 and then y=2 at T15. In Plan B, we are at y=0 at T14 and then y=1 at T15. So Plan A is more aggressive.\n\nWe'll output Plan A.\n\nBut the problem: we are at turn t1=13. The actions start at turn t1.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n\nAfter the last action (at turn22), at turn23 we are at y=9.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut the answer format: we list the actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nSo H=10, so we list 10 actions: for turns 13 to 22.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n\nBut wait: after 10 actions, we are at turn22? And then at the next turn (turn23) we are at y=9. But the problem says: the sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions and then we are at the goal at the next turn.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then the position at turn t1+H should be (0,9)? \n\nActually, after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), the next state is at turn t1+H. So we want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nIn our case: \n  Start at turn13: y13=0.\n  After action a13 (U) -> y14=1.\n  ... \n  After action a22 (at turn22) -> y23=9.\n\nSo we want y_{13+H} = 9? Then 13+H = 23? so H=10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway at T19: we are at y=5 at T19? \n  T19: dt= T19-13=6. Freeway5: one car: [49+6*6,60+6*6]=[49+36,60+36]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6,7,8: same.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway3 and 4 at T17 and T18 are safe as computed.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The cars on freeways 3 and 4 are unsafe at turns 15 and 16 (relative to \\(t_1 = 13\\), i.e., absolute turns 28 and 29) because they cover position \\(x = 0\\) at these turns. Therefore, the player must avoid being on freeway 3 (\\(y = 3\\)) or freeway 4 (\\(y = 4\\)) at turns 15 and 16.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) required is 10. The sequence of actions is designed to:\n- Move up to \\(y = 2\\) by turn 15.\n- Stay at \\(y = 2\\) during turn 15 (to avoid advancing to \\(y = 3\\) or \\(y = 4\\) at turn 16, which is unsafe).\n- Resume moving up from turn 16 onwards, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 23 (after 10 actions).\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- **Turn 13 (current turn)**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 14. Freeway 1 at turn 14 is safe (car span \\([-60, -25]\\), 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 14**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 15. Freeway 2 at turn 15 is safe (car span \\([-96, -61]\\), 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 15**: Stay (\\(S\\)) at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 16. Freeway 2 at turn 16 is safe (car span \\([-132, -97]\\), 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 16**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 17. Freeway 3 at turn 17 is safe (car spans: \\([73, 84]\\), \\([37, 48]\\), \\([1, 12]\\); 0 not in any span).\n- **Turn 17**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 18. Freeway 4 at turn 18 is safe (car spans: \\([73, 84]\\), \\([37, 48]\\), \\([7, 18]\\); 0 not in any span).\n- **Turn 18**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 19. Freeway 5 is always safe (car span \\([85, 96]\\) at turn 19, 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 19**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 20. Freeway 6 is always safe.\n- **Turn 20**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 21. Freeway 7 is always safe.\n- **Turn 21**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 22. Freeway 8 is always safe.\n- **Turn 22**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 23. The goal is reached.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and achieves the goal in 10 turns (actions from turn 13 to turn 22), with \\(y_{23} = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 15, and I start at y=2.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases, and for right-moving cars, it moves right. The collision happens only if at the turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn, so I only care about the car on the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, left-moving, head 48, tail 83, speed 36. Head and tail: if it's left-moving, and head is 48, tail is 83, but since it's moving left, the head should be the right end, I think? Let me see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ], and at T, it's [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nBut if h and τ are positions, and it's moving left, decreasing x, so if at t1, [h, τ], with h and τ, which one is larger? It says head and tail, but in the context, for left-moving, I think head is the front, which is the right end, so if moving left, head should be greater than tail? But here it says head 48, tail 83, but 48 is less than 83? That can't be right.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nIn the car state table: for freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nAnd span is given as [h, τ], for left-moving.\n\nBut [48, 83], so 48 to 83, which is from left to right? But it says left-moving, so if it's moving left, the car should be moving to decreasing x, so at time T, the span shifts left.\n\nBut with [48,83], at t1=15, position from 48 to 83, so if moving left, at T>t1, it will be at [48 - sΔT, 83 - sΔT].\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, it says [τ, h] for span at t1? No.\n\nLook: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], so τ is the tail, h is the head, and since moving right, tail should be left, head right, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span [h, τ], but with h and τ, which one is which? It says head and tail, but in the notation, for left-moving, it's (head, tail, dir, speed), and span is [h, τ].\n\nBut in the example for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), so h=48, τ=83, and since left-moving, span [48,83]. But 48 to 83 is increasing, so if moving left, the left end is decreasing.\n\nAt t1, the car occupies x from 48 to 83.\n\nAfter ΔT, it occupies [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway we are on.\n\nAlso, note that for freeways 3 and 4, there are multiple cars. Freeway 3 has three cars: (-42,-53,right,6), (36,25,right,6), and (0,-11,right,6). But let's list them.\n\nFirst, for right-moving cars, span at t1 is [τ, h], so for each car:\n\nCar 1 on freeway 3: τ=-42, h=-53? That can't be right because τ should be less than h for right-moving.\n\nIt says: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nBut in the update, for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nBut with the values, for first car on freeway 3: (-42, -53, right, 6)\n\nSo is head h = -42, tail τ = -53?\n\nBut if head is -42, tail is -53, and right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [-53, -42], because τ is tail, left end, h is head, right end.\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (36,25,right,6), so h=36, τ=25? τ=25, h=36, so span [25,36]? But it says (36,25), which might be head and tail, but in order, it's written as (h, τ), so for right-moving, span [τ, h] if τ < h.\n\nBut in this case, for (36,25,right,6), h=36, τ=25, so τ=25 < h=36, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [25,36].\n\nSimilarly, first car: (-42,-53,right,6), h=-42, τ=-53, since τ=-53 < h=-42, so span [ -53, -42 ].\n\nAnd third car: (0,-11,right,6), h=0, τ=-11, τ=-11 < h=0, span [ -11, 0 ].\n\nOh, at t1=15, for freeway 3, there is a car with span [ -11, 0 ] at turn 15.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4, same cars: (-42,-53,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nAnd freeways 5,6,7,8 each have one car: (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFor freeway 5: (-42,-53,right,6), so at t1, span [ -53, -42 ]\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 1 and 2 have left-moving cars: (48,83,left,36) each.\n\nAt t1=15, span [48,83] for each.\n\nNow I need to find when the player is on a freeway, whether 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nSince multiple cars, for a given freeway, collision if for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nAlso, for freeways with multiple cars, I need to check all.\n\nNow the player starts at y=2 at turn 15.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe vertical axis: y=0,1,2,...,9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nPlayer position is (0,y), so at (0,y), when y between 1 and 8, we need to avoid collision with cars on that y at that turn.\n\nWhen at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nGoal is (0,9), so once I reach y=9, I'm done.\n\nNow, actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nI start at y=2 at turn 15.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is 7 steps up, but I have to avoid the cars on y=3 to 8 when I'm there.\n\nSince I can move down or stay, but going down might not help since I need to go up, so probably minimal path is to go up directly, but I have to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at which turns 0 is in some car's span.\n\nSince the cars move, I need the position at turn T.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t1 = T - 15.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at turn T, the span for each car.\n\nThen 0 is covered if for any car, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nThen collision if I am on freeway k at turn T and 0 is covered.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: one car, left-moving, s=36, span at T: [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 is in span if 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same as freeway 1, since same car.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 both have the same car: (48,83,left,36)\n\nNow for freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-42,-53,right,6) → at t1, span [τ,h] = [-53,-42], at T: [-53 + 6ΔT, -42 + 6ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,6) → h=36, τ=25, span at t1 [25,36], at T: [25 + 6ΔT, 36 + 6ΔT]\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,6) → h=0, τ=-11, span at t1 [-11,0], at T: [-11 + 6ΔT, 0 + 6ΔT]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4, same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: one car (-42,-53,right,6) → same as first car of freeway 3, span at T: [-53 + 6ΔT, -42 + 6ΔT]\n\nSimilarly freeway 6,7,8 same.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find when 0 is covered at turn T.\n\nStart with freeway 1: 0 in [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\nSo 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT\n\nLeft: 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 => 48 <= 36ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so ΔT >= 2 since integer turns? Turns are discrete, I assume ΔT integer, since T is turn number.\n\nThe turn T is integer, t1=15, so T=15,16,17,... so ΔT = T - 15 = 0,1,2,3,...\n\nSimilarly, all actions at integer turns.\n\nSo ΔT integer.\n\nFor freeway 1: 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 => 36ΔT >= 48 => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so since ΔT integer, ΔT >= 2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 83 => ΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT <= 2\n\nΔT <= 2 and ΔT >= 2, so only at ΔT=2, i.e., T=17\n\nAt T=17, ΔT=2, 48 - 36*2 = 48-72 = -24 <=0, and 83-72=11, 0<=11, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=1, 48-36=12 >0, so 0 not <= 12? 0 <=12 is true, but 12 <=0 false? Let's see:\n\n48 - 36ΔT <= 0 must hold for 0 to be >= min.\n\nAt ΔT=1, min = 48-36=12, max=83-36=47, so [12,47], 0 not in, since 0<12.\n\nAt ΔT=2, min=48-72=-24, max=83-72=11, -24<=0<=11, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=3, min=48-108=-60, max=83-108=-25, -60<=0<=-25? 0 <= -25 false, no.\n\nSo only at T=17, freeway 1 has 0 covered.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 same.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: span at T: [-53 + 6ΔT, -42 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -53 +6ΔT <=0 <= -42 +6ΔT\n\nLeft: -53+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=53 => ΔT <=53/6≈8.833, so ΔT <=8\n\nRight: 0 <= -42 +6ΔT => 42 <=6ΔT => ΔT >=7\n\nSo for first car, 7<=ΔT<=8\n\nAt ΔT=7: min=-53+42= -11? -53+6*7= -53+42= -11, max=-42+42=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=8: min=-53+48= -5, max=-42+48=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=6: min=-53+36= -17, max=-42+36= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=9: min=-53+54=1, max=-42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo first car covers at ΔT=7 and 8.\n\nSecond car: span [25 +6ΔT, 36 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in this: 25+6ΔT <=0 <=36+6ΔT? But 25+6ΔT >0 for all ΔT>=0, since 25>0, so min is at least 25, which is greater than 0, so 0 never in this span. So no cover from second car.\n\nThird car: span [-11 +6ΔT, 0 +6ΔT] = [-11+6ΔT, 6ΔT]\n\n0 in this: min <=0 <= max.\n\nMin = -11+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=11 => ΔT <=11/6≈1.833, so ΔT <=1\n\nMax = 6ΔT >=0, always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nSo min <=0: -11+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=11 => ΔT <=1 (since ΔT integer)\n\nAnd 0 <= max: 0 <= 6ΔT, so ΔT >=0\n\nBut at ΔT=0, min=-11+0=-11, max=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=1, min=-11+6=-5, max=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=2, min=-11+12=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo third car covers at ΔT=0 and 1, i.e., T=15 and T=16.\n\nNow for freeway 3, collision if at turn T, 0 covered by any car.\n\nSo at T=15 (ΔT=0), third car covers.\n\nAt T=16 (ΔT=1), third car covers.\n\nAt T=17 (ΔT=2), no car covers? First car at ΔT=2: min=-53+12=-41, max=-42+12=-30, [-41,-30], 0 not in. Second car [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], no. Third car min=1, max=12, no. So at T=17, freeway 3 safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=18 (ΔT=3): first car min=-53+18=-35, max=-42+18=-24, no. Second car [25+18,36+18]=[43,54], no. Third car min=-11+18=7, max=18, no. Safe.\n\n...\n\nAt T=22 (ΔT=7): first car min=-53+42=-11, max=-42+42=0, so [ -11,0], 0 covered.\n\nSimilarly at T=23 (ΔT=8): first car min=-53+48=-5, max=-42+48=6, [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nBut for now, since I'm starting at turn 15, and I need to move soon.\n\nBack to freeway 3: collision at T=15 and T=16 from third car, and later at T=22 and T=23 from first car.\n\nBut T=22 is later.\n\nNow similarly, freeway 4 is same as freeway 3, so same situation.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car, same as first car of freeway 3: span [-53 +6ΔT, -42 +6ΔT]\n\n0 covered when -53+6ΔT <=0 <= -42+6ΔT\n\nAs before, 7<=ΔT<=8, so T=22 and 23.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8, all same, each has one car with same parameters, so for each, 0 covered at T=22 and 23.\n\nNow freeway 1 and 2: only at T=17.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4: at T=15,16,22,23\n\nFreeway 5 to 8: at T=22,23\n\nNow I start at turn 15, position y=2.\n\nAt turn 15, I am on freeway y=2.\n\nFor freeway 2, at turn 15: is there collision?\n\nFreeway 2 has the left-moving car, same as freeway 1.\n\nAt T=15, ΔT=0, span [48,83], min=48>0, so 0 not in, no collision at T=15 for freeway 2.\n\nEarlier I said freeway 1 and 2 have collision only at T=17.\n\nAt T=15, for freeway 2: span [48,83], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3 at T=15, third car covers, so if I were on freeway 3 at T=15, collision, but I'm on y=2.\n\nSo at turn 15, I am at y=2, freeway 2, which is safe at T=15.\n\nNow I need to choose action for turn 15: U, D, or S.\n\nI want to go to y=9, so probably U or S, but S keeps me at y=2.\n\nIf I go U, at turn 16, I will be at y=3.\n\nIf S, at y=2 still.\n\nNow, at turn 16, if I am at y=3, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 at T=16: as above, third car covers, so 0 covered, collision if I am on it.\n\nAt T=16, for freeway 3, third car span at ΔT=1: [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], which includes 0, so yes, collision.\n\nSo if I am on freeway 3 at turn 16, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=2 at turn 16, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 at T=16: ΔT=1, span [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nNow, I need to plan my path.\n\nI start at turn 15, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe minimal steps: from y=2 to y=9, need to increase by 7, so at least 7 turns if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see the danger times for each y.\n\nSince freeways are separate, I need to check for each y and each turn when it is occupied.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, cars only at T=17 collision.\n\ny=2: freeway 2, same as y=1, only T=17 collision.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, collision at T=15,16,22,23\n\ny=4: freeway 4, same as y=3, collision at T=15,16,22,23\n\ny=5: freeway 5, collision at T=22,23\n\ny=6: same, T=22,23\n\ny=7: same, T=22,23\n\ny=8: same, T=22,23\n\nNow, I start at turn 15, y=2.\n\nAt turn 15, y=2 is safe.\n\nI can choose to go up to y=3 or stay or down.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at turn 16, but at turn 16, y=3 is collided, as above.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 at turn 16, safe.\n\nThen at turn 16, I am at y=2, and I can choose action for turn 16.\n\nNow, turn 17: if I am on y=2 at turn 17, collision, because y=2 has collision at T=17.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 also at T=17.\n\nSo at turn 17, both y=1 and y=2 are collided.\n\ny=3 at turn 17 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nAt T=17, ΔT=2 for freeway 3: min=-53+12=-41, max=-42+12=-30? Wait no.\n\nFreeway 3 at T=17, ΔT=2:\n\nFirst car: [-53+12, -42+12] = [-41,-30], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], no\n\nThird car: [-11+12, 0+12]= [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in\n\nSo yes, freeway 3 safe at T=17.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 same.\n\ny=5 to 8 at T=17: for y=5, freeway 5, span at ΔT=2: [-53+12, -42+12] = [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly all safe at T=17 except y=1 and y=2.\n\nNow back to turn 15.\n\nI am at y=2, turn 15.\n\nOption 1: go up to y=3 at turn 16. But at turn 16, y=3 collided, so I cannot be on y=3 at turn 16.\n\nIf I go up at turn 15, I move to y=3 at turn 16, so at turn 16, I am on y=3, which is collided, so I die. Not good.\n\nOption 2: stay at y=2 at turn 15, so at turn 16, I am still at y=2.\n\nAt turn 16, y=2 is safe, as [12,47] no 0.\n\nThen at turn 16, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at turn 17? At turn 16, action U means y_{17} = y_{16} +1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and I must not collide with car on y_t at turn t.\n\nAfter action, at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nSo for turn t, I need to be safe at y_t when I am there.\n\nAt turn 15: y=2, safe.\n\nAction a_{15}: if U, then y_{16} = 2 +1 =3.\n\nThen at turn 16, I am at y=3, which is collided, since freeway 3 at T=16 has collision.\n\nSo if I go up at turn 15, I die at turn 16.\n\nIf I do S at turn 15, y_{16} =2, same as before.\n\nAt turn 16, I am at y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 16, I take action a_{16}.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at turn 17? Action at turn 16: if U, y_{17} = y_{16} +1 = 2+1=3.\n\nThen at turn 17, I am at y=3.\n\nNow at turn 17, y=3 is safe, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, if I do S at turn 16, y_{17}=2, but at turn 17, y=2 is collided, so I die.\n\nSo at turn 16, if I stay, I go to y=2 at turn 17, collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=1, y_{17}=1, but at turn 17, y=1 is also collided.\n\nSo the only safe action at turn 16 is to go up to y=3.\n\nThen at turn 17, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nNow from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=3 to y=9, need to go up 6 more steps.\n\nBut there are dangers later.\n\nFirst, let's outline the path so far.\n\nTurn 15: start at y=2, must not go up, so either S or D.\n\nIf S, then turn 16 at y=2.\n\nThen turn 16: must go up to y=3 at turn 17.\n\nTurn 17: at y=3, safe.\n\nIf at turn 15 I go down to y=1, but y=1 at turn 15: freeway 1, at T=15, ΔT=0, span [48,83], 0 not in, safe. But then I am at y=1 at turn 16.\n\nAt turn 16, y=1: freeway 1, ΔT=1, span [12,47], safe.\n\nThen at turn 17, if I am at y=1, collision.\n\nIf I go up to y=2 at turn 17, but y=2 at turn 17 collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=1, collision at turn 17.\n\nSo at turn 17, y=1 is unsafe, so I must not be on y=1 at turn 17.\n\nSimilarly for y=2.\n\nSo if I go down to y=1 at turn 15, then at turn 16 I am at y=1, safe, but then at turn 17, I need to move away, but y=2 is also unsafe, and going up to y=3: at turn 16 action U would take me to y=2 at turn 17? No.\n\nAt turn 16, if I am at y=1, action a_{16}:\n\nIf U, y_{17} = y_{16} +1 =1+1=2.\n\nThen at turn 17, at y=2, collision.\n\nIf S, y_{17}=1, collision.\n\nIf D, y_{17}=1-1=0, which is safe, since y=0 no cars.\n\nBut then I am at y=0, and I need to go up to y=9, which is farther, so more turns, probably not minimal.\n\nSo better to stay at y=2 initially.\n\nThus, at turn 15, I should do S, stay at y=2.\n\nThen turn 16: at y=2, must do U to go to y=3 at turn 17.\n\nTurn 17: at y=3, safe.\n\nNow, from turn 17, y=3, I need to go up.\n\ny=3 to y=4, etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid the later dangers.\n\nSpecifically, for y=3 to y=8, they have collisions at T=22 and 23.\n\nT=22 and 23 are turns from now.\n\nCurrent turn t1=15, so T=22 is 7 turns later, T=23 is 8 turns later.\n\nTurn 17 is t=17, so from turn 17 to turn 22 is 5 turns later? Let's compute turn numbers.\n\nTurn 15: t=15\n\nTurn 16: t=16\n\nTurn 17: t=17\n\n...\n\nTurn 22: t=22\n\nTurn 23: t=23\n\nAt turn 17, I am at y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, I need to gain 6 in y, so at least 6 actions, but I might need to wait.\n\nThe dangerous turns are T=22 and 23 for y=3 to 8.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nFor y=3 and y=4: collision at T=22 and T=23\n\nFor y=5,6,7,8: collision at T=22 and T=23\n\nAt T=22 and T=23, all freeways y=3 to 8 have collision.\n\nTherefore, I must not be on any y from 3 to 8 at turn 22 or turn 23.\n\nThat means, at turn 22, I must be at y=0,1,2, or 9.\n\nSimilarly at turn 23.\n\nBut y=9 is goal, if I reach earlier, I stop, but I need to be there at some turn.\n\nThe game continues until I reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nBut at turn 22 and 23, if I am on y=3 to 8, I collide.\n\nNow, I am at turn 17, y=3.\n\nTurn 17 is safe.\n\nNow, I need to go up.\n\nThe minimal time: if I go up every turn, from y=3 at turn 17.\n\nAfter one up: turn 18, y=4\n\nTurn 19, y=5\n\nTurn 20, y=6\n\nTurn 21, y=7\n\nTurn 22, y=8\n\nBut at turn 22, y=8 has collision, so if I am at y=8 at turn 22, I die.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=9 at turn 22, but y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nIf at turn 21 I am at y=7, and I go up, y_{22} =8, but at turn 22, I am at y=8, which has collision at T=22.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=8 at turn 22.\n\nSimilarly, I could go up faster or slower.\n\nFrom turn 17, y=3.\n\nTurn 17: action a_{17}, I can go U to y=4 at turn 18.\n\nOr S to y=3, or D to y=2.\n\nBut I need to go up, so probably U.\n\nIf U at turn 17, y_{18} =4.\n\nAt turn 18, y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=18: similar to freeway 3.\n\nΔT = T-15 = 18-15=3\n\nFor freeway 4, same as freeway 3.\n\nAt ΔT=3: first car [-53+18, -42+18]= [-35,-24], no 0\n\nSecond car [25+18,36+18]=[43,54], no\n\nThird car [-11+18, 0+18]= [7,18], no\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nTurn 18: action, if U, y_{19}=5\n\nTurn 19, y=5: freeway 5 at T=19.\n\nΔT=4, span [-53+24, -42+24] = [-29,-18], no 0, safe.\n\nTurn 19: U, y_{20}=6\n\nTurn 20, y=6: freeway 6 at T=20, ΔT=5, span [-53+30, -42+30]= [-23,-12], no 0, safe.\n\nTurn 20: U, y_{21}=7\n\nTurn 21, y=7: freeway 7 at T=21, ΔT=6, span [-53+36, -42+36]= [-17,-6], no 0, safe.\n\nTurn 21: if U, y_{22}=8\n\nThen turn 22, y=8: at T=22, freeway 8 has collision, since T=22 is dangerous.\n\nΔT=22-15=7, for freeway 8, span [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0], yes, 0 included, collision.\n\nSo if I arrive at y=8 at turn 22, I die.\n\nIf at turn 21 I do not go up, but stay or something.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nAt turn 21, if I am at y=7, and I go up, to y=8 at turn 22, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=7 at turn 21, then y_{22}=7, at turn 22, y=7 has collision at T=22.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=6, y_{22}=6, at turn 22, y=6 collision.\n\nAll y=3 to 8 unsafe at T=22.\n\nSo I must not be on y=3 to 8 at turn 22.\n\nSimilarly at turn 23.\n\nTherefore, at turn 22, I must be at y=0,1,2, or 9.\n\nSimilarly for turn 23.\n\nNow, since I need to reach y=9, the best is to be at y=9 by turn 21 or earlier, or at turn 22 if possible, but at turn 22, if I am at y=9, safe.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at turn 22.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI am at turn 17, y=3.\n\nIf I go up every turn, I reach:\n\nTurn 18: y=4\n\nTurn 19: y=5\n\nTurn 20: y=6\n\nTurn 21: y=7\n\nAt turn 21, I am at y=7.\n\nNow, to avoid being on y=3-8 at turn 22, I need to move to a safe y at turn 22.\n\nOptions: go to y=8, but y=8 unsafe at turn 22.\n\nGo to y=6, down, but unsafe.\n\nGo to y=9? From y=7, if I go up, y_{22}=8, not 9.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + delta, so from y=7, U to y=8.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to go up from y=8.\n\nBut at turn 21, y=7, if U, to y=8 at turn 22, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y=7 at turn 22, unsafe.\n\nIf down, y=6 at turn 22, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 at turn 21 if I want to avoid turn 22 collision, because all actions lead to y=6,7,8 at turn 22, all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=6 at turn 21, same thing.\n\nTo be safe at turn 22, I need to be at y=0,1,2, or 9 at the start of turn 22.\n\nThat means, at turn 21, I need to take action such that y_{22} is one of 0,1,2,9.\n\nBut y_{22} depends on y_{21} and action.\n\ny_{22} = y_{21} + delta y.\n\nSince y between 0 and 9.\n\nSo if y_{21} = k, then y_{22} can be k-1, k, k+1 if within bounds.\n\nTo have y_{22} =0,1,2, or 9.\n\nFor example, if at turn 21 I am at y=1, I can go down to y=0, or stay y=1, or up to y=2, all safe for turn 22.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=2, I can go to y=1,2,3 but y=3 unsafe at turn 22, so only to y=1 or 2.\n\ny=1 and 2 are safe at turn 22? y=1 and y=2, freeways, but at T=22, are they safe?\n\ny=1: freeway 1 at T=22.\n\nT=22, ΔT=22-15=7\n\nSpan for freeway 1: [48 - 36*7, 83 - 36*7] = [48-252, 83-252] = [-204, -169], all negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2 same, safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\ny=3 to 8 unsafe at T=22.\n\nSimilarly at T=23.\n\nSo y=0,1,2,9 safe at T=22 and T=23.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nI need to be at a position at turn 21 such that I can move to y=0,1,2, or 9 at turn 22.\n\nFor instance, if at turn 21 I am at y=1, I can go to y=0,1,2.\n\nIf at y=2, to y=1,2,3 but y=3 unsafe, so to y=1 or 2.\n\nIf at y=0, to y=0 or 1.\n\nIf at y=8, I can go to y=7,8,9.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe, but y=9 safe.\n\nSo if at y=8 at turn 21, I can go up to y=9 at turn 22.\n\nThen at turn 22, I am at y=9, safe, and I reached goal.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=9 at turn 21, I am already at goal, but I need to reach, so at turn 21 if at y=9, done.\n\nBut in our case, from earlier, if I go straight up, at turn 21 I am at y=7.\n\nFrom y=7, I can go to y=6,7,8 at turn 22, all unsafe except if I go to y=8, but y=8 unsafe, no, y=8 is unsafe at turn 22.\n\ny=6,7,8 all unsafe at turn 22.\n\nI cannot go directly to y=9 from y=7.\n\ny_{22} = y_{21} + delta, so from y=7, y_{22} can be 6,7, or 8, all in 3-8, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 at turn 21, because I cannot reach a safe y at turn 22.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,5,etc.\n\nThe only positions at turn 21 that allow me to be safe at turn 22 are:\n\n- If at y=1, I can go to y=0,1,2\n\n- If at y=2, I can go to y=1,2 (not 3)\n\n- If at y=8, I can go to y=9 (since y=7 and 8 unsafe, but y=9 safe)\n\n- If at y=9, stay or whatever, but reached.\n\n- If at y=0, go to y=0 or 1\n\nBut y=8: if at turn 21 I am at y=8, then I can go up to y=9 at turn 22.\n\nAt turn 22, y=9 safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=1, I can be at y=1 or 2 at turn 22.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, since I am at turn 17, y=3, and I need to get to y=9.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 21, for example.\n\nFrom turn 17 y=3 to turn 21 y=8, that is 5 turns, gain 5, so I need to go up 5 times in 4 turns? Let's see the turns.\n\nTurn 17: at y=3\n\nAfter action at turn 17, y_{18} set.\n\nNumber of actions from turn 17 to turn 21.\n\nTurn 17 action affects y_{18}\n\nTurn 18 action affects y_{19}\n\nTurn 19 action affects y_{20}\n\nTurn 20 action affects y_{21}\n\nTurn 21 action affects y_{22}\n\nI need y at turn 21.\n\nFrom turn 17 to turn 21, there are 4 actions: a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}, a_{20} to set y_{18}, y_{19}, y_{20}, y_{21}.\n\nStart: at turn 17, y=3\n\nAfter a_{17}, y_{18} = 3 + delta y_{17}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{18}, y_{19} = y_{18} + delta y_{18}\n\nAfter a_{19}, y_{20} = y_{19} + delta y_{19}\n\nAfter a_{20}, y_{21} = y_{20} + delta y_{20}\n\nI want y_{21} =8, for example.\n\nThen from y=3 to y=8, need +5, but with 4 actions, I can gain at most 4, so y_{21} <= 3+4=7, cannot reach y=8 in 4 actions from y=3.\n\ny at turn 17: y=3\n\ny at turn 18: after a_{17}, y_{18} = 3 + d17, d17 in {-1,0,1}, so y_{18} in {2,3,4}\n\nSimilarly, y_{19} = y_{18} + d18, and so on.\n\nAfter 4 actions, from turn 17 to turn 21, the y can increase by at most 4, so y_{21} <= 3+4=7.\n\nSimilarly, minimum y_{21} =3-4= -1, but y>=0, so at least 0.\n\nSo y_{21} can be from 0 to 7.\n\nCannot be 8 or 9.\n\nTherefore, at turn 21, the highest I can be is y=7, as in the direct path.\n\nBut at y=7, I cannot reach a safe y at turn 22 without colliding.\n\ny=7 at turn 21, y_{22} can only be 6,7,8, all unsafe at turn 22.\n\nSimilarly, if y=6 at turn 21, same.\n\nThe safe y at turn 22 are 0,1,2,9.\n\nBut from y=7 at turn 21, I cannot reach y=9 directly; I need to go to y=8 first, but at turn 22 y=8 is unsafe.\n\nI could be at a lower y at turn 21.\n\nFor example, if at turn 21 I am at y=2, then I can go to y=1,2 at turn 22, both safe.\n\nThen later go up to y=9.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nSince T=22 and T=23 are both dangerous, I need to avoid both.\n\nFirst, let's list the turns.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some turn, but avoid being on y=3-8 at T=22 or T=23.\n\nThe danger is only at T=22 and 23 for those y.\n\nBefore and after, it might be safe.\n\nFor example, at T=24, for y=3, ΔT=24-15=9, first car min=-53+54=1, max=-42+54=12, [1,12], no 0; similarly others, so safe after T=23.\n\nSimilarly, before, only specific times.\n\nSo I can pass through y=3-8 at other times.\n\nNow, from turn 17, y=3.\n\nI need to go up, but I must not be on y=3-8 at turn 22 or 23.\n\nTurn 22 is 5 turns after turn 17? Turn 17 to 22 is 5 turns later: turn 18,19,20,21,22.\n\nAt turn 17, t=17.\n\nTurn 22 is t=22, so 5 steps later.\n\nSimilarly, turn 23 is 6 steps later.\n\nSince I start at y=3 at t=17, I can move.\n\nTo avoid being at y=3-8 at t=22, I need that at t=22, y is not in 3-8.\n\nSimilarly for t=23.\n\nOne way is to be at y=9 before t=22 or at t=22.\n\nBut as above, I can reach at most y=7 at t=21, which is before t=22.\n\nt=21 is before t=22.\n\nAt t=21, if I am at y=7, I can stay or move, but at t=22 I will be on y=6,7,8.\n\nUnless I can reach y=9 at t=21 or earlier.\n\nBut from t=17 y=3, to t=21, 4 actions, max y=7, as above.\n\ny=7 at t=21.\n\nThen at t=22, I must be at safe y, but I can't from y=7.\n\nAlternative: I can go down to a lower y before t=22, so that at t=22 I can be at y=1 or 2.\n\nFor example, from t=17 y=3, I can go down to y=2 or lower.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nSuppose at turn 17, I stay or down, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nFor instance, at turn 17, I do S, so y_{18}=3\n\nThen turn 18, I can go U to y=4 at t=19? Let's list the turns.\n\nTurn 17: at y=3, action a_{17}\n\nIf a_{17}=S, y_{18}=3\n\nThen at turn 18, y=3, which is safe? At T=18, freeway 3: as before, ΔT=3, all cars not covering 0, safe.\n\nThen action a_{18}: if U, y_{19}=4\n\nTurn 19, y=4, safe, etc.\n\nBut I will still be at a high y at t=21.\n\nI need to be at y<=2 at t=21 or something.\n\nLet's set the target.\n\nI need at turn 22 to be at y=0,1,2, or 9.\n\nSince I can't be at y=9 at turn 22 from below, because to reach y=9, I must be at y=8 at some point, but at turn 22 if I am at y=8, unsafe.\n\nI can be at y=9 at turn 22 if I arrive there at that turn.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at turn 22, I need to be at y=8 at turn 21 and go up.\n\nBut at turn 21, if I am at y=8, then y_{22}=9 if I go up.\n\nThen at turn 22, I am at y=9, safe.\n\nAnd at turn 21, I am at y=8, which is freeway 8.\n\nAt turn 21, T=21, for freeway 8: ΔT=21-15=6, span [-53+36, -42+36] = [-17,-6], no 0, so safe.\n\nThen at turn 21, action U, to y=9 at turn 22.\n\nAt turn 22, y=9, safe, reached goal.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo I need to be at y=8 at turn 21.\n\nFrom turn 17 y=3, to turn 21 y=8.\n\ny from 3 to 8, difference 5, in how many steps?\n\nFrom turn 17 to turn 21, the actions at turn 17,18,19,20 affect y_{18}, y_{19}, y_{20}, y_{21}.\n\nSo 4 actions to increase y from 3 to 8, which is +5, but each action can increase by at most 1, so maximum increase 4, to y=7, cannot reach y=8 in 4 actions.\n\ny_{21} = y_{17} + sum_{t=17 to 20} delta y_t\n\ny_{17} =3\n\ndelta y_t each in {-1,0,1}\n\nAfter 4 actions, y_{21} = 3 + sum of 4 deltas.\n\nMax sum +4, so y_{21} <=7\n\nMin y_{21} >= 3-4= -1, but >=0.\n\nSo y_{21} <=7, cannot be 8.\n\nTherefore, impossible to be at y=8 at turn 21 from y=3 at turn 17 with 4 actions.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at turn 21, even higher, impossible.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=9 before turn 22 or at turn 22 directly from below.\n\nThe only way is to be at a low y at turn 21, like y=1 or 2, then go up later.\n\nOr, I can be at y=9 at turn 22 by being at y=8 at turn 21 and going up, but I can't be at y=8 at turn 21.\n\nUnless I start earlier.\n\nAnother idea: I can go up faster initially.\n\nBut from turn 15 to turn 17, I am at y=3 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 15, I was at y=2, and I did S at turn 15, U at turn 16 to y=3 at turn 17.\n\nBut at turn 15, I could have done something else.\n\nFor example, at turn 15, instead of S, I could go down to y=1, but that might be worse.\n\nOr, at turn 15, go up, but earlier I saw that if I go up at turn 15, to y=3 at turn 16, collision, so not possible.\n\nSo only choice at turn 15 is S or D.\n\nIf S, to y=2 at turn 16, then U to y=3 at turn 17.\n\nIf D, to y=1 at turn 16, then at turn 16, I am at y=1, safe, then at turn 17, I can go U to y=2, but at turn 17 y=2 collision, or go to y=0 or stay, but then I am lower.\n\nSo the first path is better: at turn 17 y=3.\n\nNow, to handle the turn 22 problem.\n\nSince I can't reach high enough to jump to y=9 at turn 22, I need to be at y=1 or 2 at turn 22, for example.\n\nThen after that, go up to y=9.\n\nBut that will take more turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 22, be at y=2, then go up to y=3 at turn 23, but at turn 23, y=3 to 8 are all unsafe.\n\nAt turn 23, T=23, all y=3-8 have collision.\n\nSo if I am on y=3 at turn 23, collision.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=3-8 at turn 23 either.\n\nSo at turn 23, I must be at y=0,1,2, or 9.\n\nSimilarly for turn 22.\n\nSo the danger zone is only at turn 22 and 23 for y=3-8.\n\nOutside, safe.\n\nSo I need to pass through y=3-8 before turn 22 or after turn 23.\n\nFor example, I can go up to y=8 before turn 22, then at turn 21, if I am at y=8, I can go up to y=9 at turn 22.\n\nBut as before, I can't be at y=8 at turn 21 from y=3 at turn 17.\n\nMax y=7 at turn 21.\n\nSo I can be at y=7 at turn 21, then from there, I need to go to y=9, but at turn 22, if I go to y=8, collision, etc.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 21, I am at y=7, and I go down to a lower y, but that seems counterproductive.\n\nOr, I can delay my ascent.\n\nFor example, from turn 17 y=3, instead of going up, I go down to y=2 or lower, so that at turn 22 I can be at y=2, for example.\n\nThen after turn 23, I go up.\n\nLet's calculate the turns.\n\nTurn 17: y=3\n\nI can go down to y=2 at turn 18.\n\nThen at turn 18, y=2, safe? At T=18, freeway 2: ΔT=3, span [48-108, 83-108]? ΔT=18-15=3, [48-108, 83-108]= [-60,-25], no 0, safe.\n\nThen at turn 18, I can go down to y=1 at turn 19.\n\nTurn 19, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at turn 19, go down to y=0 at turn 20.\n\nTurn 20, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at turn 20, I need to stay or go up.\n\nBut at turn 22, I want to be at y=2, for example.\n\nSo at turn 20, y=0, action a_{20}: if U, y_{21}=1\n\nTurn 21, y=1, action a_{21}: if U, y_{22}=2\n\nThen at turn 22, y=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can be at y=2 at turn 22.\n\nThen at turn 22, I am at y=2.\n\nThen I can go up to y=3 at turn 23, but at turn 23, y=3 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 at turn 22, then at turn 23, y=2 is safe? y=2 at T=23.\n\nT=23, ΔT=8, freeway 2: [48-36*8, 83-36*8] = [48-288, 83-288] = [-240, -205], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can stay at y=2 at turn 23.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nAfter turn 23, I can go up.\n\nTurn 23: at y=2, action U to y=3 at turn 24.\n\nTurn 24, y=3, now T=24, safe, as earlier.\n\nThen go up to y=4 at turn 25, and so on, to y=9.\n\nBut this takes many turns.\n\nFrom turn 24 y=3 to turn ? y=9, 6 steps, so at turn 30, for example.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince at turn 22 and 23 I am at y=2, I can start going up earlier.\n\nBut at turn 22, I am at y=2, I can go up to y=3 at turn 23, but at turn 23, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo I must not go up to y=3 at turn 23.\n\nI can only go to y=3 after turn 23.\n\nTurn 24 is safe.\n\nSo the earliest to go up is turn 23 action to go to y=3 at turn 24.\n\nSo from turn 22 y=2, I can do S or D or U, but if U, to y=3 at turn 23, collision.\n\nIf S, y_{23}=2, safe.\n\nIf D, to y=1 at turn 23, safe.\n\nThen at turn 23, I can go to y=2 or 1 or 0, all safe, but not up.\n\nThen at turn 24, I can go up to y=3.\n\nSo the fastest is to be at y=2 at turn 22 and turn 23, then at turn 23 action U to y=3 at turn 24.\n\nThen from turn 24 y=3, go up each turn to y=9 at turn 30.\n\nBut from turn 15 to turn 30, 15 turns, but we can reduce.\n\nBack to the beginning.\n\nAt turn 15, I am at y=2.\n\nInstead of going to y=3 at turn 17, I can stay at y=2 longer or go down.\n\nBut let's think differently.\n\nI can reach y=9 before turn 22.\n\nFor example, from turn 17 y=3, if I go up every turn, I reach y=7 at turn 21, as before.\n\nTurn 17: y=3\n\nTurn 18: y=4\n\nTurn 19: y=5\n\nTurn 20: y=6\n\nTurn 21: y=7\n\nAt turn 21, y=7.\n\nNow, instead of going up, I can go down, but that seems bad.\n\nOr, I can go up to y=8 at turn 22, but unsafe.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 20, I am at y=6, for example.\n\nIf at turn 20, I go up to y=7 at turn 21.\n\nThen at turn 21, y=7, then I can only go to 6,7,8 at turn 22.\n\nAll unsafe.\n\nBut if at turn 20, I am at lower y.\n\nLet's list the possible y at each turn from turn 17 onwards.\n\nTurn 17: y=3\n\nFor turn 18: y can be 2,3,4 depending on a17\n\nBut I want to go up, so assume a17=U, y18=4\n\nTurn 18: y=4, a18=U, y19=5\n\nTurn 19: y=5, a19=U, y20=6\n\nTurn 20: y=6, now action a20.\n\nIf a20=U, y21=7\n\nThen turn 21: y=7, action a21, y22=6,7, or 8 all unsafe at t22.\n\nIf at turn 20, a20=S, y21=6\n\nThen at turn 21, y=6, same problem.\n\nIf a20=D, y21=5\n\nThen at turn 21, y=5, then y22 can be 4,5,6 all unsafe at t22.\n\nStill bad.\n\nSo from turn 20 y=6, I cannot avoid being at unsafe y at t22 if I go directly.\n\nBut if at turn 19, I am at lower y.\n\nFor example, at turn 19, y=5, instead of going up, I go down.\n\nBut then I am lower, and it takes longer.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=2 at turn 22 by going down early.\n\nLet's calculate the minimal H.\n\nSince I must avoid t22 and t23 for y=3-8, I can pass through y=3-8 before t=22 or after t=23.\n\nThe latest before t22 is t21, and earliest after t23 is t24.\n\nAt t21, I can be on y=3-8, as long as I don't stay there at t22.\n\nBut at t21, if I am on y=8, I can go to y=9 at t22.\n\nBut I can't be at y=8 at t21 from start.\n\nMax y=7 at t21.\n\nFrom y=7 at t21, I can go to y=8 at t22, but unsafe.\n\nOr, I can go down to y=6 at t21, then at t22 to y=5,6,7 all unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=0,1,2 at t22.\n\nSimilarly for t23.\n\nSo I need to be at low y at t22 and t23.\n\nThen after t23, go up fast.\n\nBut t23 is late.\n\nt23 is turn 23.\n\nFrom turn 17 to turn 23 is 6 turns.\n\nIf I stay low, I can be at y=2 at turn 22 and 23.\n\nThen at turn 23, action U to y=3 at turn 24.\n\nThen go up each turn: turn 24 y=3, turn 25 y=4, ..., up to turn 30 y=9.\n\nBut from turn 15 to turn 30, 15 turns, but I started at turn 15, so H-1 turns? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence starts from turn t1=15.\n\nAt turn 15, I take action a15, then a16, etc., until I reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is the last turn.\n\nFor example, if I reach at turn T, then the actions are from turn 15 to turn T-1, and H = T - 15? Let's see the question.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt1=15, so actions from a_{15} to a_{15+H-1}, and after H actions, I reach at turn 15+H.\n\nAt turn 15, I am at position, then after actions, at turn 15+H, I am at (0,9).\n\nThe position at turn t is after actions up to t-1.\n\nAt turn 15, I am at y=2.\n\nAfter action a15, at turn 16, I am at new y, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 15+H, I am at y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a15 to a15+H-1.\n\nThen at turn 15+H, I am at y=9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIf I go directly up with no delays, from y=2 to y=9, need 7 steps: for example, U,U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 2 to 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 in 7 actions, so at turn 15+7=22, at y=9.\n\nTurn 15: y=2, action U, turn 16 y=3\n\nAction U, turn 17 y=4\n\n...\nAction U, turn 21 y=6? Let's list:\n\nTurn 15: start y=2, action U, y16=3\n\nBut at turn 16, y=3, which is collided, as we saw earlier, because freeway 3 at T=16 has collision.\n\nSo I cannot do this because at turn 16 I collide.\n\nIn the direct path, I had to wait at turn 15.\n\nWith waiting: turn 15: S, y16=2\n\nTurn 16: U, y17=3\n\nThen turn 17: U, y18=4\n\nTurn 18: U, y19=5\n\nTurn 19: U, y20=6\n\nTurn 20: U, y21=7\n\nTurn 21: U, y22=8\n\nBut at turn 22, y=8, collision.\n\nAnd at turn 21, y=7, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need one more action: turn 22: U, y23=9, but at turn 22, if I am at y=8, collision when I take the action? No.\n\nAt turn 22, I am at position y=8, and I take action, but at the moment I am on y=8 at turn 22, so I collide with car on freeway 8 at turn 22, before I take action.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T and 0 in span at T.\n\nSo at turn 22, if y=8, I collide, regardless of action.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at turn 22.\n\nSimilarly, in this path, at turn 22 y=8, collision.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nWith the down path, I can be at y=2 at turn 22.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 15: S, y16=2\n\nTurn 16: U, y17=3\n\nThen instead of going up, from turn 17 y=3, I go down.\n\nTurn 17: D, y18=2\n\nTurn 18: D, y19=1\n\nTurn 19: D, y20=0\n\nTurn 20: S, y21=0  (or U to y=1)\n\nAt turn 22, I want to be at y=2.\n\nSo at turn 20: y=0, action U, y21=1\n\nTurn 21: U, y22=2\n\nThen at turn 22, y=2, safe.\n\nTurn 22: I can S, y23=2\n\nOr U to y=3 at turn 23, but unsafe.\n\nSo S, y23=2\n\nTurn 23: U, y24=3\n\nThen turn 24: U, y25=4\n\nTurn 25: U, y26=5\n\nTurn 26: U, y27=6\n\nTurn 27: U, y28=7\n\nTurn 28: U, y29=8\n\nTurn 29: U, y30=9\n\nSo at turn 30, y=9.\n\nH = number of actions from turn 15 to turn 29, so 15 actions? Turns: from turn 15 to turn 29, 15 turns, but actions from a15 to a29, that's 15 actions, H=15.\n\nBut earlier direct with waiting was 7 actions to turn 22 but collision.\n\nMinimal might be less.\n\nI can go up to y=7 at turn 21, then at turn 21, go down to y=6, then at turn 22, I am at y=6, collision, not good.\n\nOr, from turn 17 y=3, I go up to y=4 at turn 18, then to y=5 at turn 19, then at turn 19, instead of up, I go down to y=4 at turn 20, then to y=3 at turn 21, then at turn 22, I can be at y=2 if I go down.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 17: U, y18=4\n\nTurn 18: U, y19=5\n\nTurn 19: D, y20=4\n\nTurn 20: D, y21=3\n\nThen at turn 21, y=3\n\nNow at turn 21, action a21, if U, y22=4, unsafe at t22\n\nIf S, y22=3, unsafe\n\nIf D, y22=2, safe.\n\nSo a21=D, y22=2\n\nThen at turn 22, y=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 22, I can S, y23=2\n\nThen turn 23: U, y24=3\n\nThen go up to y=9 at turn 30, same as before.\n\nStill 15 actions to turn 30.\n\nBut from turn 24 y=3 to turn 30 y=9, 6 actions for 6 steps, yes.\n\nBut I can reach earlier if I go up faster after turn 23.\n\nTurn 24 y=3, U to y4 at t25, U to y5 at t26, ..., U to y9 at t30, 7 actions from turn 24 to turn 30, but turn 24 action to y4 at t25, so from y3 at t24 to y9 at t30, 6 actions: a24 to a29, y25 to y30.\n\nt24 y=3, a24 U, y25=4\n\na25 U, y26=5\n\na26 U, y27=6\n\na27 U, y28=7\n\na28 U, y29=8\n\na29 U, y30=9\n\nSo a24 to a29, 6 actions.\n\nFrom start: actions from a15 to a29, 15 actions.\n\nBut H is the number, so H=15.\n\nBut perhaps I can be at higher y when I start going up.\n\nAnother idea: since the danger is only at t=22 and 23, I can be at y=8 at turn 21, but impossible, or at y=9 before.\n\nBut I can't reach before turn 22.\n\nTurn 21 is t=21, from t17 y3, max y7 at t21.\n\nAt t21 y7, if I could go directly to y9, but I can't, only to y8.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps at turn 20, I am at y=6, and I go up to y7 at t21, same.\n\nOr, let's list all freeways and times when safe.\n\nFor example, freeway 3 is safe at all times except t=15,16,22,23.\n\nt=15,16,22,23 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor y=3, unsafe at t=15,16,22,23.\n\nBut at turn 17, I am on y=3, which is safe.\n\nThen I can stay at y=3 for some turns, but at turn 18,19,20,21, y=3 is safe, as long as not at t=22 or 23.\n\nAt turn 18, T=18, safe, etc.\n\nSo at turn 17, y=3, I can do S for several turns.\n\nFor example, turn 17: S, y18=3\n\nTurn 18: S, y19=3\n\nTurn 19: S, y20=3\n\nTurn 20: S, y21=3\n\nAt turn 21, y=3\n\nThen at turn 21, I need to move to safe y at turn 22.\n\nIf I go down, y22=2, safe.\n\nThen at turn 22, y=2, I can stay or go down.\n\nThen at turn 23, I can go up to y=3 at turn 24.\n\nBut turn 24 y=3 is safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut from turn 21 y=3 to turn 24 y=3, I wasted turns.\n\nWorse than before.\n\nFrom turn 21 y=3, go down to y=2 at turn 22.\n\nThen at turn 22, I am at y=2, then at turn 23, I can go to y=3 at turn 24, as before.\n\nSame as first down path.\n\nTo save time, I can go up to y=7 at turn 21, then down to y=2 at turn 22.\n\nBut from y=7 to y=2, need 5 down actions, but from turn 21 to turn 22, only one action, so y22 = y21 + delta, so from y7, y22 can be 6,7,8, not 2.\n\nCannot jump down.\n\nSo only one step per turn.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 15 with the down-up path.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at turn 15, I do D to y=1 at turn 16.\n\nThen at turn 16, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at turn 16, I can do D to y=0 at turn 17.\n\nTurn 17, y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can stay at y=0 until turn 21, for example.\n\nAt turn 21, y=0, action U, y22=1\n\nTurn 22, y=1, action U, y23=2\n\nTurn 23, y=2, action U, y24=3\n\nThen go up to y=9 at turn 30, same as before.\n\nOr at turn 22, from y=1, I can go U to y=2 at turn 23? At turn 22 action U, y23=2.\n\nThen turn 23 action U, y24=3, etc.\n\nStill late.\n\nSo it seems 15 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's check the car on freeway 3 at t=15 and 16.\n\nAt t=15, y=3 has collision, but I was not on it.\n\nIn the path, I avoid it by not being there.\n\nAnother thought: can I be at y=9 at turn 22 by being at y=8 at turn 21 and going up.\n\nBut I can't be at y=8 at turn 21.\n\nUnless I start from lower y earlier.\n\nAt turn 15, I am at y=2.\n\nIf I go up at turn 15, I collide at turn 16 on y=3.\n\nSo I must not.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, but I think it's not possible.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 15.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFrom the first part:\n\nTurn 15: S, so a15=S, y16=2\n\nTurn 16: U, a16=U, y17=3\n\nThen from here, to be at y=2 at turn 22.\n\nSo from turn 17 y=3, I need to go down to y=2 at some point.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 17: D, a17=D, y18=2\n\nThen at turn 18, y=2, I can stay or go down.\n\nBut to be at y=2 at turn 22, I can stay at y=2 from turn 18 to turn 22.\n\nAt turn 18, y=2, safe.\n\nTurn 19, y=2, safe, etc.\n\nTurn 18: T=18, y=2 freeway 2, span [48-36*3, 83-36*3]= [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=19, ΔT=4, [48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61], no, safe.\n\nUp to T=22, as before, safe.\n\nSo I can stay at y=2 from turn 18 to turn 22.\n\nThen at turn 22, y=2, I can go up at turn 23 to y=3 at turn 24.\n\nBut at turn 23, I am at y=2, action a23.\n\nIf U, y24=3\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut at turn 23, I can do U to y=3 at turn 24.\n\nThen from turn 24 y=3 to turn 30 y=9, 6 actions.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 17: D, y18=2\n\nThen turn 18: S, y19=2\n\nTurn 19: S, y20=2\n\nTurn 20: S, y21=2\n\nTurn 21: S, y22=2\n\nTurn 22: S, y23=2  (I can stay or go up, but if go up to y=3 at t24, action at t22)\n\nAt turn 22, action a22, if S, y23=2\n\nThen turn 23: U, a23=U, y24=3\n\nTurn 24: U, a24=U, y25=4\n\n...\nUp to turn 29: U, a29=U, y30=9\n\nActions from a15 to a29, 15 actions.\n\nI can reduce the stay at y=2.\n\nFor example, from turn 17 y=3, I can go down to y=2 at turn 18, then stay until turn 21, then at turn 21 go down to y=1 or something, but not necessary.\n\nAt turn 21, I can be at y=2, then at turn 22, I am at y=2, safe, then at turn 23, I am at y=2, safe, then at turn 23 action U to y=3 at turn 24.\n\nSame as above.\n\nBut at turn 22, I can go up to y=3 at turn 23, but unsafe, so I must not.\n\nSo I think 15 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5-8, the car is only at T=22,23, but y=3 and 4 also at T=15,16, but I avoid those.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 17 I am at y=3, and y=3 is safe at turn 17, I can go up to y=4 at turn 18, then to y=5 at turn 19, then to y=6 at turn 20.\n\nAt turn 20, y=6, I can go down to y=5 at turn 21.\n\nThen at turn 21, y=5, then I can go down to y=4 at turn 22, but at turn 22, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nOr to y=6 or 5, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think I have to accept H=15.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nStart turn 15: at y=2\n\na15 = S, so position at turn 16: y=2\n\nTurn 16: a16 = U, position turn 17: y=3\n\nNow, to go down:\n\nTurn 17: a17 = D, position turn 18: y=2\n\nThen stay at y=2 for several turns.\n\nTurn 18: a18 = S, turn 19 y=2\n\nTurn 19: a19 = S, turn 20 y=2\n\nTurn 20: a20 = S, turn 21 y=2\n\nTurn 21: a21 = S, turn 22 y=2\n\nTurn 22: a22 = S, turn 23 y=2\n\nTurn 23: a23 = U, turn 24 y=3\n\nTurn 24: a24 = U, turn 25 y=4\n\nTurn 25: a25 = U, turn 26 y=5\n\nTurn 26: a26 = U, turn 27 y=6\n\nTurn 27: a27 = U, turn 28 y=7\n\nTurn 28: a28 = U, turn 29 y=8\n\nTurn 29: a29 = U, turn 30 y=9\n\nSo at turn 30, y=9.\n\nActions from a15 to a29, that's 15 actions.\n\nH=15.\n\nBut I can start going up earlier after turn 23.\n\nAt turn 23, I am at y=2, I can go directly to y=3 at turn 24, as above.\n\nNo need to stay at y=2 longer.\n\nIn the sequence above, from turn 18 to turn 23, I am at y=2, but at turn 23 I go to y=3.\n\nIn the actions, a18 to a22 are S, keeping y=2.\n\nBut at turn 23, a23=U to y=3 at turn 24.\n\nThen up.\n\nTo save one action, I can at turn 22, instead of S, go U to y=3 at turn 23, but at turn 23, y=3 is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I cannot.\n\nTherefore, H=15 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach at turn 29.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 at turn 28.\n\nFrom turn 24 y=3 to turn 28 y=8, 4 actions, gain 5, impossible.\n\nMax y=7 at turn 28 from y=3 at turn 24.\n\nTurn 24 y=3, a24 U, y25=4\n\na25 U, y26=5\n\na26 U, y27=6\n\na27 U, y28=7\n\nThen a28 U, y29=8\n\na29 U, y30=9\n\nSo turn 30.\n\nCannot earlier.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nNow for the sequence, but in the beginning, at turn 15 and 16, I have a15=S, a16=U.\n\nThen a17=D to go down.\n\nBut I could have stayed at y=2 from turn 16.\n\nTurn 16: at y=2, I could do S instead of U, but then I stay at y=2 longer, but I need to go to y=3 eventually, but in this case, I go down later, but same thing.\n\nIn the sequence above, I go to y=3 at turn 17 and immediately down, but I could avoid going to y=3.\n\nFor example, at turn 15: S, a15=S, y16=2\n\nTurn 16: S, a16=S, y17=2\n\nThen I am at y=2 at turn 17.\n\nThen I can stay at y=2 from turn 17 onwards.\n\nThen at turn 23, U to y=3 at turn 24, etc.\n\nBut at turn 17, y=2 is safe, so I can do that, and save one action because I don't go to y=3 and back.\n\nLet's see:\n\nTurn 15: S, a15=S, y16=2\n\nTurn 16: S, a16=S, y17=2  (instead of U to y=3)\n\nThen turn 17: S, a17=S, y18=2\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 22: S, a22=S, y23=2\n\nThen turn 23: U, a23=U, y24=3\n\nThen turn 24: U, y25=4\n\n...\n\nTurn 29: U, y30=9\n\nActions from a15 to a29, still 15 actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom turn 17 to turn 23, I am at y=2, with actions S.\n\nBut at turn 23, I go to y=3 at turn 24.\n\nNumber of actions same.\n\nIf I go up at turn 23 to y=3 at turn 24, same.\n\nSo no savings.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 15.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 3 at turn 15 and 16, but I avoided.\n\nNow, the sequence should be for turns from t1=15.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S  (stay at y=2)\n\nThen to be consistent, I can stay from turn 16 to turn 23 at y=2, but at turn 23 I take U to go to y=3 at turn 24.\n\nBut at turn 23, I am at y=2, action U, to y=3 at turn 24.\n\nThen up each turn to turn 29.\n\nBut turn 29 action to y=9 at turn 30.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 15 to turn 29, 15 actions.\n\nH=15.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: S\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nAt turn 29, after U, y30=9.\n\nYes.\n\nI could start going up earlier after the danger, but turn 24 is the earliest.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points.\n\nFor example, at turn 22, I am at y=2, safe.\n\nTurn 23, y=2, safe.\n\nTurn 24, y=3, T=24, freeway 3: ΔT=9, first car min=-53+54=1, max=-42+54=12, no 0; second car [25+54,36+54]=[79,90], no; third car [-11+54,0+54]=[43,54], no, safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nSo the sequence is above.\n\nIn the output, it should be for turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=15, so actions from turn 15 to turn 29.\n\nThe answer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1\n\nHere t1=15, H=15, so up to turn 15+14=29? t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a15\n\nt=1: a16\n\n...\n\nt=14: a29\n\nThen at turn 15+14=29, after action, turn 30 at y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: S\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nBut at turn 23: U to y=3 at turn 24\n\nThen U each to y=9 at turn 30.\n\nIn the sequence, I have many S, but it works.\n\nPerhaps I can reduce by not staying so long, but since I need to wait until after turn 23, I have to stay.\n\nAt turn 22, I could go U to y=3 at turn 23, but unsafe, so no.\n\nSo this is fine.\n\nSo minimal H=15.\n\nNow for the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 15. The sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on any freeway \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turns 22 and 23, as these turns have collisions for those freeways. The player must stay at \\(y = 2\\) (safe at all relevant turns) until turn 23, then move up to \\(y = 9\\) in the subsequent turns.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- **Turns 15 to 22**: Stay at \\(y = 2\\) using the \"S\" (stay) action. This avoids the collision on \\(y = 3\\) at turns 15 and 16, and the collisions on \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turns 22 and 23.\n- **Turns 23 to 29**: Move up (\"U\" action) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 30.\n\nAfter 15 actions (from turn 15 to turn 29), the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 30.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: S \\\\\nTurn 17: S \\\\\nTurn 18: S \\\\\nTurn 19: S \\\\\nTurn 20: S \\\\\nTurn 21: S \\\\\nTurn 22: S \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U\n}",

The collision happens only if at the turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So, if at turn T, you move from y to y+1, you are on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1. So you only check for collision on the row you're currently on at that turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. So once I'm at y=9, I'm safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at turn 18.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions: U (up, increase y by 1), D (down, decrease by 1), or S (stay, no change), to get to y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y is clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nSince we want to go up to 9, and we're at 3, we need at least 6 moves up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, which could take more turns.\n\nMinimal H is at least 6, but probably more because of cars.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn t_1=18.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars listed.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nSince it's left-moving, span at T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it says head h and tail τ, but for left-moving, if head is left, tail is right? I need to be careful with the span.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor left-moving cars, head is the left end, tail is the right end? Let me see the update rule.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nSo h = -60, τ = -25, both negative, so at t_1=18, span is [-60, -25], which is from -60 to -25, so left end is smaller number, I assume x-axis.\n\nSince it's left-moving, and h is head, which is left, so h < τ, I think.\n\n-60 < -25, so head is -60, tail is -25, so the car is from x=-60 to x=-25, and since it's left-moving, it moves left, so at time T, span is [ -60 - 36*(T-18), -25 - 36*(T-18) ]\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nBut collision is only if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway the player is on at that turn.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, always x=0.\n\nSo for freeway k, if at turn T, player is on y=k, and for some car on k, 0 is between the left and right ends of the span at T.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: only one car, span at T: left end L = -60 - 36(T-18), right end R = -25 - 36(T-18)\n\n0 is in [L, R] if L <= 0 <= R.\n\nBut since both L and R are negative and decreasing, L is more negative, so for all T, L < R < 0, since at T=18, -60 to -25, both negative, and moving left, so R = -25 -36(T-18) < -25 <0, similarly L more negative, so 0 is never in [L,R] for any T, because R <0 always. So freeway 1 is always safe, no car ever at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-60,-25,left,36), so same thing, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: has three cars: (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nAll right-moving, and direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], so head is h, tail is τ, and since moving right, τ < h.\n\nIn the notation, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nBut in the update, for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSo for the first car on freeway 3: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nh = -24, τ = -35? That seems odd.\n\nτ = -35, h = -24, and since right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24], so from -35 to -24.\n\nAt T, span = [-35 + 6(T-18), -24 + 6(T-18)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (54,43,right,6), h=54, τ=43, span(t_1) = [43,54]\n\nAt T: [43 + 6(T-18), 54 + 6(T-18)]\n\nThird car: (18,7,right,6), h=18, τ=7, span(t_1)= [7,18]\n\nAt T: [7 + 6(T-18), 18 + 6(T-18)]\n\nNow, for freeway 4: same as freeway 3? It says (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6) — identical to freeway 3.\n\nLet me check.\n\nFreeway 4: \"(-24, -35, right, 6), (54, 43, right, 6), (18, 7, right, 6)\" — yes, same as freeway 3.\n\nThen freeway 5: only (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: same, (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nAnd freeway 1 and 2 have the left-moving car which is safe.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 have multiple cars, but freeway 5 to 8 have only one car each, the (-24,-35,right,6) one.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1 = T - 18\n\nSo for a given freeway, at turn T, if player is on it, we need to check if 0 is in some car's span.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1 and 2: always safe, as we said.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: span at T: [ -35 + 6 Δt, -24 + 6 Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 6 Δt\n\nSimilarly, second car: [43 + 6 Δt, 54 + 6 Δt], since 43>0, and increasing, min is 43 +0 >0, so 0 < 43 <= left, so 0 not in [43+6Δt, 54+6Δt] for any Δt, since left end >=43>0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: [7 + 6 Δt, 18 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 7 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= 18 + 6 Δt\n\nBut 7 + 6 Δt >=7 >0 for Δt >=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for first car: -35 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 6 Δt\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nLeft: -35 + 6 Δt <= 0 => 6 Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, so Δt <=5 since integer? Δt is integer, T turn number.\n\nT is turn, integer, Δt integer.\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 <= -24 + 6 Δt => 6 Δt >=24 => Δt >=4\n\nSo 0 in span if Δt >=4 and Δt <=5\n\nSince Δt <=5.833, so Δt=4 or 5.\n\nFor Δt=4: left: -35 + 24 = -11, right: -24 + 24 =0, so span [-11,0], so 0 included.\n\nFor Δt=5: left: -35+30= -5, right: -24+30=6, span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nFor Δt=6: left: -35+36=1, right: -24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other cars on freeway 3 don't cover 0.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe when Δt=4 or 5, i.e., T=22 or 23.\n\nT=18 + Δt, so T=22 or 23.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3, so also unsafe at T=22,23.\n\nNow freeway 5: only one car: (-24,-35,right,6) same as above.\n\nSo span [ -35 + 6 Δt, -24 + 6 Δt ]\n\nUnsafe when Δt=4 or 5, T=22 or 23.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8: all have only this car, so all unsafe at T=22 and 23.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 each have the same car: (-24,-35,right,6), so yes, for each, unsafe at T=22,23.\n\nBut freeway 1 and 2 are always safe.\n\nNow, what about other times? For freeway 3,4,5,6,7,8, are they safe outside T=22,23?\n\nFor example, at T=18, Δt=0, for freeway 3: first car span [-35,-24], all negative, 0 not in. Second [43,54], positive, third [7,18], positive, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=19, Δt=1: first car [-35+6, -24+6]=[-29,-18], negative; second [49,60]; third [13,24], all not include 0.\n\nT=20: [-23,-12], negative.\n\nT=21: [-17,-6], negative.\n\nT=22: [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nT=23: [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nT=24: [1,12], not include 0.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways with that car.\n\nNow freeway 3 and 4 have additional cars, but they don't affect 0, as we saw.\n\nSo, summary:\n\n- Freeway 1: always safe\n\n- Freeway 2: always safe\n\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at T=22,23\n\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at T=22,23\n\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at T=22,23\n\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at T=22,23\n\n- Freeway 7: unsafe at T=22,23\n\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at T=22,23\n\nAll freeways from 3 to 8 are unsafe only at T=22 and 23. At other times, they are safe.\n\nT=22 and 23 are problematic for y=3 to 8.\n\nBut y=1 and 2 are always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at T=18.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nPossible actions: we can go up, down, or stay.\n\nSince we want to minimize turns, we should go up when possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it's unsafe.\n\nThe unsafe times are T=22 and 23 for freeways 3-8.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn from T=18 onwards.\n\nAt T=18, player is at y=3.\n\nNow, we need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, since y=1 and 2 are always safe, we could go down to y=2 or y=1 to avoid the unsafe times, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nThe unsafe times are only T=22 and 23, so if we can be on y=1 or 2 at those times, or above y=8? y=8 is a freeway, unsafe at T=22,23.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nSo, we need to not be on freeways 3 to 8 at T=22 or 23.\n\nAt other times, they are safe.\n\nSo, for example, at T=22 and 23, we should be on y=0,1,2, or 9.\n\ny=0 is also safe, no cars.\n\ny=0,1,2,9 are safe zones at those times.\n\nNow, starting from y=3 at T=18.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: if no cars, we can go up 6 times: U,U,U,U,U,U, to y=9 in 6 turns, at T=24.\n\nBut at T=24, y=9, but let's see the path.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nT=18: y=3, action? At T=18, we are at y=3, but action is for next position? Let's clarify.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t_1, which is the start.\n\nThen we choose actions for turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to some turn where we reach y=9.\n\nAt each turn t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nBut y_{t+1} is the position at turn t+1.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn t based on y_t.\n\nSo, at turn t, position (0, y_t), and if y_t between 1 and 8, check if 0 in span for some car on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T, we are at y_T, and we choose a_T which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision at T, it depends on y_T and the cars at T.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=3 to 8 at T=22 and 23.\n\nNow, times: from T=18 to, say, T=24.\n\nT=22 is 4 turns after start, T=23 is 5 turns after.\n\nΔt = T - 18.\n\nSo T=22: Δt=4, T=23: Δt=5.\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at T=18.\n\nIf we go directly up:\n\nAfter 0 actions: T=18, y=3\n\nAfter 1 action: T=19, y=?\n\nSuppose we do U at T=18: then y_{19} = y_18 +1 =4\n\nSimilarly, U at T=19: y_{20} =5\n\nU at T=20: y_{21} =6\n\nU at T=21: y_{22} =7\n\nAt T=22, y=7, which is freeway 7, and T=22 is unsafe, so collision.\n\nIf we continue, U at T=22: y_{23}=8, at T=23, y=8, unsafe.\n\nThen U at T=23: y_{24}=9, safe.\n\nBut at T=22 and 23, collision, so not possible.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on 3-8 at T=22 and 23.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Be below y=3 at T=22 and 23, i.e., on y=0,1,2.\n\n2. Be above y=8 at T=22 or 23, but y=9 only at turn when we arrive, but at T=22, if we are at y=9, but we start from y=3, need multiple steps.\n\nWe can reach y=9 before T=22 if possible.\n\nMinimal to reach y=9: from y=3, need 6 ups, in 6 turns, to T=24.\n\nAt T=24, y=9.\n\nBut we need to be safe during the path.\n\nFrom T=18 to T=24, we are on y_t at each turn.\n\nT=18: y=3, safe? At T=18, y=3, freeway 3, is it safe?\n\nAt T=18, Δt=0, freeway 3: cars as above, spans [-35,-24], [43,54], [7,18], all not contain 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=19: if y=4, freeway 4, at Δt=1, spans: first car [-29,-18], not 0; second [49,60]; third [13,24], all safe.\n\nT=20: y=5, freeway 5, only car span [-23,-12] at Δt=2, not 0.\n\nT=21: y=6, freeway 6, span [-17,-6] at Δt=3, not 0.\n\nT=22: y=7, freeway 7, span at Δt=4: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], includes 0, unsafe.\n\nProblem at T=22.\n\nTo avoid, we could stay or go down at some point to be lower at T=22.\n\nFor example, if at T=22, we are on y=2 or below.\n\ny=2 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly for T=23.\n\nSince T=22 and 23 are both unsafe for 3-8, we need to be not on those rows at those times.\n\nNow, the critical times are T=22 and 23.\n\nWe can be on y=0,1,2 or y=9 at those times.\n\ny=9 might be reachable only later.\n\nFrom y=3, to reach y=9, minimum 6 steps, so earliest at T=24.\n\nAt T=24, y=9, safe.\n\nBut we need to pass through intermediate rows.\n\nLet me list the turns: T=18,19,20,21,22,23,24,...\n\ny_t at each T.\n\nWe control the actions from T=18 onwards.\n\nAt T=18, we start at y=3.\n\nWe choose a_18, which sets y_19.\n\nThen a_19 sets y_20, and so on.\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H=6, to T=23? Let's see.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k.\n\nStart at turn t_1=18, position at turn 18.\n\nAfter 0 actions: turn 18, y=3\n\nAfter 1 action: turn 19, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions: turn 18 + m, y_{18+m}\n\nTo reach y=9, since y_{18} =3, we need y_{18+H} =9 for some H, with |change| <= H, but since we can go down, but we want min, so likely up.\n\nThe net change must be +6, so number of U minus number of D must be 6, and number of S adds turns.\n\nTo minimize H, we should minimize S and D, so mostly U.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nNow, back to avoiding T=22 and 23 on rows 3-8.\n\nSo for turn T=22, we must not be on y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for T=23.\n\nSo at T=22, y must be <=2 or >=9.\n\nBut >=9 only possible at T=24 or later, since from y=3 at T=18, min to y=9 is T=24 with 6 U.\n\nSimilarly, at T=23, y must be <=2 or >=9.\n\ny=9 at T=24 earliest.\n\nAt T=22, y<=2 or y=9 impossible, so must y<=2.\n\nSimilarly at T=23, must y<=2 or y=9, but y=9 not at T=23, so must y<=2.\n\nTherefore, at both T=22 and T=23, we must be on y<=2.\n\nThat is, y_22 <=2 and y_23 <=2.\n\nNow, we start from y_18=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some turn, say T.\n\nNow, the path must have y_22 <=2 and y_23 <=2.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, we can find possible sequences.\n\nFirst, from T=18 to T=22 is 4 turns: actions at T=18,19,20,21 determine y_19,20,21,22.\n\nSimilarly, y_23 depends on action at T=22.\n\nLet me set t=0 for simplicity, relative to start.\n\nLet τ = t - 18, so at τ=0, y=3.\n\nWe need y_τ at τ=4 (T=22) <=2\n\ny_τ at τ=5 (T=23) <=2\n\nAnd reach y=9 as early as possible.\n\nMinimal τ such that y_τ=9.\n\nSince net +6, and y_4 <=2, y_5 <=2.\n\ny_0=3.\n\ny_τ changes by -1,0,+1 each step.\n\nTo minimize τ when y_τ=9.\n\nBut we need to satisfy y_4 <=2 and y_5 <=2.\n\nSince y_0=3, to have y_4 <=2, we need to decrease or stay, but since we want to go up, we might need to go down first or stay.\n\nSimilarly for y_5.\n\nAfter τ=5, we can go up to 9.\n\nNow, let's consider the actions from τ=0 to τ=5.\n\ny_0=3\n\nAfter action at τ=0, y_1\n\nτ=1, y_2\n\nτ=2, y_3\n\nτ=3, y_4\n\nAction at τ=3 sets y_4.\n\nSimilarly, action at τ=4 sets y_5.\n\nWe need y_4 <=2 and y_5 <=2.\n\ny_5 depends on y_4 and action at τ=4.\n\nSince y_5 <=2, and y_4 <=2, possible to stay or move within 0-2.\n\nBut y_4 <=2, and y_0=3, so in 4 steps, from y=3 to y<=2, so net change <= -1, meaning we must have at least one more D than U in these 4 actions, or some S.\n\nSimilarly, since y_5 <=2, similar.\n\nBut after that, we need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, the earliest we can reach y=9 is if we go up as much as possible after τ=5.\n\ny_5 <=2, say y_5 = 2 or 1 or 0.\n\nThen to y=9, need at least 7,8,9 steps up from there.\n\nFor example, if y_5=2, need 7 steps to y=9 (since y_6 to y_12? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=5, y_5, position.\n\nThen after k actions, y_{5+k}\n\nSet y_{5+k} =9.\n\nSince y_5 <=2, y_{5+k} = y_5 + net U, so net U needed = 9 - y_5 >=7.\n\nMin k when net U = 9 - y_5, so k >= 9 - y_5.\n\nSince we can have S or D, but to min, use U only, so min k = 9 - y_5.\n\nThen at τ + k = 5 + (9 - y_5)\n\nTotal turns from start: τ=0 to τ=5 + (9 - y_5)\n\nBut y_5 <=2, so 9 - y_5 >=7, so min total turns at least 5 +7 =12? τ=12, turn T=18+12=30.\n\nBut earlier without cars, we could do in 6 turns to T=24.\n\nBut with constraints, we have to wait at low y until after T=23.\n\nT=23 is τ=5, so after τ=5, we can go up.\n\ny_5 <=2, so we start from low point.\n\nEarliest to reach y=9 is when y_5 is as high as possible, but y_5 <=2, so max y_5=2.\n\nThen need 7 U to go to y=9 in 7 steps.\n\nSequence: from τ=5 to τ=11, 6 actions to y_6 to y_11? Let's index properly.\n\nAt τ=5, y_5=2\n\nThen action at τ=5: U, then y_6=3\n\nU at τ=6, y_7=4\n\n...\n\nU at τ=11, y_12=9\n\ny_5 at τ=5, y_6 at τ=6, ..., y_12 at τ=12.\n\nSo from y_5=2 to y_12=9, 7 steps, τ from 5 to 12.\n\nTotal τ=12, turn T=18+12=30.\n\nBut at T=24 we could be at y=9 if no cars, but with cars, we have to delay.\n\nBut is this necessary? We must be at y<=2 at T=22 and T=23, which are τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nτ=4: T=22, y_4 <=2\n\nτ=5: T=23, y_5 <=2\n\nNow, y_5 <=2, and we need to go to 9, so yes, min to reach from y_5 is 9 - y_5 steps, each U, so arrival at τ=5 + (9 - y_5)\n\nSince y_5 <=2, min when y_5=2, arrive at τ=5+7=12.\n\nIf y_5=1, arrive at τ=5+8=13, worse.\n\ny_5=0, τ=5+9=14, worse.\n\nSo best to have y_5=2, arrive at τ=12.\n\nBut we need to achieve y_5=2 with y_4 <=2.\n\nNow, we start from y_0=3.\n\nWe need to go down to y<=2 by τ=4 and stay there at τ=5.\n\nBut we can go down earlier.\n\nSince y_4 <=2 and y_5 <=2, and y_0=3.\n\nIn the actions from τ=0 to τ=3 (sets y_4) and τ=4 (sets y_5).\n\ny_4 is set by actions at τ=0,1,2,3.\n\ny_4 = y_0 + sum_{i=0 to 3} Δy_i\n\nWhere Δy_i = +1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S.\n\nSimilarly, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\nWe need y_4 <=2, y_5 <=2.\n\nAnd y_0=3.\n\nTo have y_4 <=2, since y_0=3, we need the net change from τ=0 to τ=3 to be <= -1, so at least one D or some S, but S doesn't change, so need at least one D in first 4 actions? Actions from τ=0 to τ=3 are 4 actions: a_18 to a_21 for T=18 to 21, setting y_19 to y_22? Let's clarify timing.\n\nTurn τ: position y_τ\n\nAction at τ: a_τ, determines y_{τ+1}\n\nSo for position at τ, y_τ.\n\nAction a_τ changes to y_{τ+1}.\n\nWe need y_4 <=2 (for T=22)\n\ny_5 <=2 (for T=23)\n\ny_4 is position at τ=4, set by action at τ=3? No.\n\ny_τ is determined by previous actions.\n\ny_0 given.\n\na_0: sets y_1\n\na_1: sets y_2\n\na_2: sets y_3\n\na_3: sets y_4\n\na_4: sets y_5\n\nSo y_4 is set by a_3\n\ny_5 is set by a_4\n\nWe need y_4 <=2 and y_5 <=2.\n\ny_0=3\n\nTo have y_4 <=2, we can choose actions such that after 4 actions (a_0 to a_3), y_4 <=2.\n\nSince y_0=3, to have y_4 <=2, we need to decrease at least once, or stay multiple times.\n\nSimilarly for y_5, it depends on y_4 and a_4.\n\nBut since y_5 <=2, and y_4 <=2, a_4 can be S or D or U, but U would make y_5 = y_4 +1, which if y_4 <=2, y_5 <=3, but we need y_5 <=2, so if y_4 <=1, U is ok, y_5= y_4+1 <=2; if y_4=2, U makes y_5=3>2, not allowed. If y_4=2, to have y_5<=2, we must do S or D, so y_5=2 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=1, U makes y_5=2<=2, ok; D makes y_5=0; S=1.\n\nIf y_4=0, U=1, D=-1 but y=0 min, so if D, y=0, etc.\n\nBut to min time, we want y_4 as high as possible to make later ascent faster, but y_4 <=2, and for y_5, we want it high, but y_5 <=2.\n\nBest to have y_4=2 and y_5=2.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nNow, can we have y_4=2 and y_5=2 with y_0=3.\n\ny_0=3\n\nWe need y_4=2.\n\nSo net change over 4 actions: from y_0 to y_4, Δy = -1.\n\nSo sum of Δy for a_0 to a_3 must be -1.\n\nEach Δy: U:+1, D:-1, S:0.\n\nSo number of U minus number of D must be -1, since S don't affect.\n\nLet u = number of U, d = number of D, s = number of S, u+d+s=4, and net Δy = u - d.\n\ny_4 = y_0 + net Δy = 3 + (u - d)\n\nSet equal to 2, so 3 + u - d =2, so u - d = -1.\n\nAlso u + d + s =4.\n\nSimilarly, for y_5=2, which is set by a_4 from y_4.\n\nIf y_4=2, to have y_5=2, we must do S or D, but D would make y_5=1<2, which is ok but then y_5=1, so later we need more steps to 9.\n\nTo have y_5=2, we need to do S at τ=4 if y_4=2.\n\nIf we do D, y_5=1.\n\nBut we want y_5=2 to min steps.\n\nSo set a_4 = S, then y_5 = y_4 =2.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=1, we can do U to y_5=2, etc.\n\nBut best to have y_4=2 and y_5=2.\n\nSo let's aim for that.\n\nSo from y_0=3 to y_4=2 in 4 steps with net Δy = -1.\n\nu - d = -1, u + d + s =4.\n\nPossible: for example, one D and three S: u=0, d=1, s=3, net u-d=-1.\n\nOr one U, two D, one S: u=1, d=2, s=1, net u-d=1-2=-1.\n\nOr other combinations.\n\nBut s adds turns without progress, so to min total time, we should avoid S, use moves.\n\nBut here we have to wait, but we can use D to go down.\n\nSince we need to kill time until after τ=5, we might as well go down to y=2 or something.\n\nBut in terms of min steps later, we want y_4 and y_5 high, so y=2.\n\nNow, with u-d=-1 and u+d+s=4.\n\nMin s to avoid staying, so for example, d=1, u=0, s=3: then actions: three S and one D, in some order.\n\nBut y changes: start y=3, after one D, y=2, then S,S,S, y=2.\n\nBut we can do the D earlier or later.\n\nSimilarly, with u=1, d=2, s=1: net u-d=1-2=-1, so y from 3, down to 2 or less, but we want y=2.\n\nFor example, D,D,U,S or something.\n\nBut let's list possible sequences for first 5 actions to have y_4=2 and y_5=2.\n\ny_4 is set after a_3.\n\ny_0=3\n\na_0: suppose D, then y_1=2\n\nThen a_1: S, y_2=2\n\na_2: S, y_3=2\n\na_3: S, y_4=2\n\nThen a_4: S, y_5=2\n\nSo actions: D,S,S,S,S for a_0 to a_4? a_0 to a_3 set y_1 to y_4.\n\ny_4=2.\n\nThen a_4: S, y_5=2.\n\nBut a_4 is at τ=4, which is for y_5.\n\nNow, we have y_4=2 and y_5=2.\n\nTotal actions so far: from τ=0 to τ=4, 5 actions, up to y_5 at τ=5.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny_5=2, need to increase by 7 to y=9.\n\nSo 7 U actions: a_5 to a_11: all U.\n\nThen y_6=3, y_7=4, ..., y_12=9.\n\nAt τ=12, y_12=9.\n\nτ=12 from start, turn T=18+12=30.\n\nBut at which turns are we on freeways?\n\nWe need to ensure no collision except at T=22 and 23 we are safe.\n\nT=22 is τ=4, y_4=2, freeway? y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 is always safe, as we said earlier.\n\nT=23 is τ=5, y_5=2, same, safe.\n\nNow, other times: during the ascent, from τ=6 to τ=11, y from 3 to 8.\n\nTurns: τ=6: T=24, y=3? y_6=3 at τ=6, T=24.\n\nNow, at T=24, is freeway 3 safe?\n\nEarlier, for freeway 3, unsafe only at T=22,23, which is τ=4,5.\n\nT=24 is τ=6, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nAt T=24, τ=6, Δt=6 from start, but for freeway, at time T, Δt = T - 18.\n\nT=24, Δt=6.\n\nFor freeway 3: at Δt=6, as earlier, first car span [ -35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], not include 0.\n\nOther cars no issue.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at T=25, Δt=7, freeway 4: same as freeway 3, at Δt=7: first car [ -35+42, -24+42] = [7,18], not include 0? 0 not in, yes.\n\n[7,18] min 7>0.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at T=26, Δt=8, freeway 5: car span [ -35+48, -24+48] = [13,24], safe.\n\ny=6 at T=27, Δt=9, [ -35+54, -24+54]=[19,30], safe.\n\ny=7 at T=28, Δt=10, [ -35+60, -24+60]=[25,36], safe.\n\ny=8 at T=29, Δt=11, [ -35+66, -24+66]=[31,42], safe.\n\nThen y=9 at T=30, safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut total turns: from start T=18 to T=30, H=12 actions? From turn 18 to 30, number of actions.\n\nStart at turn 18, after H actions, at turn 18+H.\n\nAt turn 18+H, position y_{18+H}.\n\nIn this case, at turn 30, y=9, so 18+H=30, H=12.\n\nBut earlier I thought min 6, but with waiting, it's 12.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach faster by not staying so long.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=2 earlier, we might start going up before τ=5.\n\nBut at τ=5, we need y_5<=2, so we must be low until τ=5.\n\nAfter τ=5, we can go up.\n\ny_5 must be <=2, so at τ=5, we are at most y=2.\n\nThen from there, min 7 steps to y=9, at τ=12.\n\nSo cannot be faster than τ=12.\n\nBut τ=12 is T=30.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 earlier if we go up immediately after the critical period.\n\nBut y_5<=2, so no.\n\nAnother idea: what if at T=22 and 23, we are on y=0 or y=1, but that would make y_5 lower, so later arrival, worse.\n\nFor example, if y_5=1, then to y=9 need 8 steps, arrive at τ=13.\n\nSimilarly, if y_5=0, arrive at τ=14.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo best y_5=2.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, we used many S actions to stay at y=2.\n\nBut we can use fewer actions to reach y_4=2 and y_5=2.\n\nFor example, from y_0=3, we can go down immediately.\n\na_0: D, then y_1=2\n\nThen to keep y=2 until y_5.\n\nSo from τ=1 to τ=4, we need y_1=2, y_2=2, y_3=2, y_4=2, y_5=2.\n\nSo actions: a_0: D (to y_1=2)\n\na_1: S (y_2=2)\n\na_2: S (y_3=2)\n\na_3: S (y_4=2)\n\na_4: S (y_5=2)\n\nSame as before.\n\nWe could do a_0: S, y_1=3\n\na_1: D, y_2=2\n\na_2: S, y_3=2\n\na_3: S, y_4=2\n\na_4: S, y_5=2\n\nStill, y_1=3, but at τ=1, T=19, which is safe, since only T=22,23 unsafe.\n\nIn this case, y_1=3, freeway 3 at T=19, Δt=1, safe as earlier.\n\nThen y_2=2, etc.\n\nBut we still have S actions.\n\nTo reduce S, we can go down and up, but we need net decrease.\n\nFor example, to have y_4=2 from y_0=3 with net Δy=-1.\n\nSuppose we do one D and three S, but S not needed if we can, but we have to be at y=2 at τ=4.\n\nSince we can move, we might go below and come back, but that might not save time.\n\nFor example, a_0: D, y_1=2\n\na_1: D, y_2=1\n\na_2: U, y_3=2\n\na_3: S, y_4=2\n\nThen y_4=2.\n\nThen a_4: S, y_5=2.\n\nBut we used one extra D and U, which costs actions, but y_5=2 same.\n\nThen from y_5=2, go up: a_5 to a_11 U, y_12=9.\n\nStill arrive at τ=12.\n\nAnd we have more actions but same arrival time.\n\na_0 to a_4 are 5 actions to reach y_5=2.\n\nThen a_5 to a_11: 7 actions to y_12=9.\n\nTotal 12 actions, turn T=30.\n\nBut in terms of number of actions, H=12.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up earlier if we can be at y=2 at τ=4 and τ=5, but then go up from τ=5.\n\nBut τ=5 is T=23, after that safe.\n\nBut y must be integer, and we need to go up step by step.\n\nAnother thought: can we be at y=9 before T=22? But from y=3 at T=18, to y=9, min 6 steps, at T=24, which is after T=22,23.\n\nT=24 is after.\n\nBut at T=22, if we were at y=9, but impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the freeways at critical times by being on different rows.\n\nFor example, at T=22, be on y=1 or 2, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly for T=23.\n\nBut we start from y=3.\n\nNow, suppose we go down to y=2 quickly.\n\nFor example, a_18: D, to y_19=2 (T=19)\n\nThen at T=19, y=2, safe.\n\nT=20, we can stay or move.\n\nBut at T=22, we need to be <=2.\n\nSimilarly T=23.\n\nNow, from T=19 to T=22, we can be on y=2 or go to y=1, etc.\n\nBut to min time, we might stay at y=2 until after T=23.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nSuppose we go down to y=1 at some point.\n\nBut then y_5 might be lower.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=22, y=1, T=23 y=1.\n\nThen y_5=1, need 8 steps to y=9, arrive at T=18+5+8=31, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo best to be at y=2 at T=22 and T=23.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we can have fewer stay actions if we time it.\n\nFor example, from y_0=3, we can do:\n\na_0: S, y_1=3\n\na_1: S, y_2=3\n\na_2: S, y_3=3\n\na_3: D, y_4=2  (since y_3=3, D to y_4=2)\n\nThen a_4: S, y_5=2\n\nThen from there up.\n\nBut at T=22 is τ=4, y=2, safe.\n\nT=23 τ=5, y=2, safe.\n\nBut during τ=0,1,2: T=18,19,20, we are at y=3, which is freeway 3, but at those times, safe.\n\nT=18: safe, T=19: Δt=1, freeway 3 safe, T=20: Δt=2, safe.\n\nT=21: τ=3, y_3=3, freeway 3, Δt=3, span first car [-17,-6], not 0, safe.\n\nThen T=22: y_4=2, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut we used S actions at τ=0,1,2, which is waiting.\n\nThen a_3: D to y_4=2\n\na_4: S to y_5=2\n\nThen a_5 to a_11: U to y_12=9.\n\nStill H=12.\n\nTo reduce the number of S, we can go down earlier.\n\nFor example, a_0: D, y_1=2\n\nThen a_1: S, y_2=2\n\na_2: S, y_3=2\n\na_3: S, y_4=2\n\na_4: S, y_5=2\n\nSame.\n\na_0: D, y_1=2\n\na_1: S, y_2=2\n\na_2: S, y_3=2\n\na_3: S, y_4=2\n\na_4: S, y_5=2\n\nThen up.\n\nBut in all cases, we have to stay at y=2 for multiple turns to cover T=22 and T=23.\n\nSince T=22 and T=23 are consecutive, we need to be at y<=2 for both turns, so at least from some turn before to after, but since y changes slowly, we need to be low for those two turns.\n\nSpecifically, since y changes by at most 1, if y_22 <=2, then y_23 can be y_22-1, y_22, or y_22+1.\n\nBut we need y_23 <=2, so if y_22=2, y_23 can be 1,2,3.\n\nBut we need y_23<=2, so if y_22=2, we can have y_23=1,2 but not 3.\n\nSo we must not go up at T=22 if y_22=2.\n\nSimilarly, if y_22=1, y_23 can be 0,1,2, all <=2.\n\nBut to have y_23=2, we need to go up from y_22=1.\n\nBut in any case, for min time, we want y_23=2, so we can set y_22=2 and a_22=S, or y_22=1 and a_22=U, etc.\n\nBut earlier we have y_5=2 at τ=5.\n\nτ relative.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 with fewer than 12 turns.\n\nAnother idea: what if at T=22, we are on y=0 or 1, but we go up immediately after.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=22, y=1, then at T=23, we can be y=1 or y=2, but we need y_23<=2, so if y_22=1, we can do U at T=22 to y_23=2, which is <=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=23, y=2, safe.\n\nThen from there go up to 9.\n\ny_23=2 at T=23.\n\nThen need 7 U to y=9 at T=30.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we are higher before.\n\nBut we cannot be on y=3-8 at T=22 or 23.\n\nSo must be low at those times.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=9 at T=24, but with detour.\n\nFor example, go down to y=2, then up, but it takes more time.\n\nI think 12 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we go up immediately to y=4 or 5, but before T=22, we go down to y=2.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart T=18, y=3\n\na_18: U, y_19=4\n\na_19: U, y_20=5\n\na_20: D, y_21=4  // go down\n\na_21: D, y_22=3? y_21=4, D to y_22=3\n\nBut at T=22, y=3, which is unsafe! Freeway 3 at T=22, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\na_20: D, y_21=4? y_20=5, D to y_21=4\n\nThen a_21: D, y_22=3, still unsafe at T=22.\n\nTo be safe at T=22, need y_22<=2.\n\nSo from y_20=5, we need to go down to <=2 in two actions: a_20 and a_21.\n\na_20 sets y_21, a_21 sets y_22.\n\ny_20=5\n\nIf a_20: D, y_21=4\n\na_21: D, y_22=3, which is >2, unsafe.\n\nIf a_20: D, y_21=4\n\na_21: D, y_22=3 same.\n\ny_22=3>2.\n\nTo have y_22<=2, from y_20=5, we need at least two downs: a_20: D, y_21=4; a_21: D, y_22=3, still 3>2.\n\ny_22=3.\n\nTo get to y=2 or less, need three downs, but only two actions.\n\ny_20=5, after one down y_21=4, after second down y_22=3, cannot reach <=2 in two actions.\n\nMin y_22=3 if we do two D.\n\nIf we do one D and one S, y_22=4 or 5, worse.\n\nSo from y_20=5, impossible to have y_22<=2 with two actions.\n\nSimilarly, if we are higher earlier, it's harder to get down in time.\n\nIf we are at y=4 at T=20.\n\ny_20=4\n\nThen a_20: D, y_21=3\n\na_21: D, y_22=2, which is <=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=22, y=2, safe.\n\nNow T=23: y_23, depends on a_22.\n\nIf a_22: S, y_23=2, safe.\n\nOr U, y_23=3, but y=3 at T=23 unsafe! So cannot do U, must do S or D to keep y<=2.\n\nSo if y_22=2, a_22 must be S or D, so y_23=2 or 1.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nT=18: y=3, safe\n\na_18: ? \n\nSuppose we go up slowly or down.\n\nFor example:\n\na_18: S, y_19=3  // stay at 3\n\na_19: S, y_20=3  // T=20, y=3, freeway 3, Δt=2, safe\n\nThen a_20: D, y_21=2  // to go down\n\na_21: D, y_22=1  // T=22, y=1, freeway 1, always safe\n\nThen at T=22, y=1.\n\nNow a_22: we need y_23 <=2, so we can do U to y_23=2, or S to y_23=1, or D to y_23=0.\n\nTo min time, do U to y_23=2.\n\nThen T=23, y=2, safe.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\ny_23=2 at T=23.\n\nThen need to go to y=9.\n\na_23: U, y_24=3\n\na_24: U, y_25=4\n\n...\n\nup to a_29: U, y_30=9\n\ny_23=2 at T=23\n\na_23 U, y_24=3 at T=24\n\na_24 U, y_25=4 at T=25\n\n...\n\ny increases by 1 each U, so y_24=3, y_25=4, y_26=5, y_27=6, y_28=7, y_29=8, y_30=9.\n\nSo at T=30, y=9.\n\nSame as before, H=12 actions from T=18 to T=30.\n\nIn this sequence: actions from a_18 to a_29.\n\na_18: S (y_19=3)\n\na_19: S (y_20=3)\n\na_20: D (y_21=2)\n\na_21: D (y_22=1)\n\na_22: U (y_23=2)\n\na_23: U (y_24=3)\n\n...\n\na_29: U (y_30=9)\n\nFrom a_23 to a_29: 7 actions to go from y=2 to y=9? y_23=2, y_24=3 after a_23, ..., y_30=9 after a_29, so 7 actions: a_23 to a_29.\n\na_18 to a_22: 5 actions, then a_23 to a_29: 7 actions, total 12 actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIn this case, at T=22, y=1, T=23 y=2, both safe.\n\nBut we arrived at same time.\n\nCan we start going up earlier?\n\nFor example, at T=21, in the above, y_21=2.\n\nWe could go up at T=21, but if a_21: U, then y_22=3, which at T=22 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we are at y=2 at T=21, we must not go up until after T=23.\n\nSo we have to stay or go down at T=21 and T=22.\n\nThus, we cannot start going up before T=23.\n\nAt T=23, we can be at y=2, then go up from there.\n\nEarliest y=9 at T=30.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=2 at T=22 and T=23 with fewer actions.\n\nFor example, start from y=3 at T=18.\n\na_18: D, y_19=2  // down to 2 at T=19\n\nThen we need to be at y<=2 at T=22 and T=23.\n\nSo from T=19 to T=22, we can stay or move within 0-2.\n\nTo min time, stay at y=2.\n\na_19: S, y_20=2\n\na_20: S, y_21=2\n\na_21: S, y_22=2  // T=22, y=2\n\na_22: S, y_23=2  // T=23, y=2\n\nThen a_23: U, y_24=3\n\n...\n\na_29: U, y_30=9\n\nSame, 12 actions.\n\na_18 to a_22: 5 actions to stay at y=2 from T=19 to T=23? a_18: D to y_19=2\n\na_19: S, y_20=2\n\na_20: S, y_21=2\n\na_21: S, y_22=2\n\na_22: S, y_23=2\n\nThen a_23 to a_29: U each, y_24 to y_30=9, 7 actions.\n\nTotal from a_18 to a_29, 12 actions.\n\nNow, in terms of the sequence, we need to output actions from turn t_1=18 onwards.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the sequence until we reach y=9.\n\nSince we reach at turn 30, after a_29.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the car states for other times.\n\nIn the ascent, from T=24 to T=29, we are on y=3 to 8, but at those times, as we calculated, all safe.\n\nFor example, at T=24, y=3, freeway 3, Δt=6, span [1,12], no 0.\n\nT=25, y=4, freeway 4, same cars, Δt=7, [7,18], no 0.\n\nT=26, y=5, freeway 5, car span [13,24] at Δt=8, no 0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nIs there a way to do with H=11?\n\nSuppose we can be at y=9 at T=29.\n\nThat means from start, in 11 actions.\n\nBut y_18=3, y_29=9, net +6 in 11 steps, possible with 6 U and 5 S or something, but we have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nT=22 and T=23 must have y<=2.\n\nT=22 is turn 22, which is after 4 actions? Turns: start T=18, after H actions, turn 18+H.\n\nPosition at turn T.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 29, so T=29, which is 11 turns after start? Turn 18 to 29, difference 11, so after 11 actions, at turn 29.\n\ny_29=9.\n\nNow, y_18=3, so in 11 steps, net +6.\n\nNow, at T=22, which is turn 22, we need y_22 <=2.\n\nSimilarly T=23, y_23 <=2.\n\nTurn 22 is after 4 actions? From turn 18 to turn 22, it is 4 turns later, so y_22 is after actions a_18 to a_21.\n\nSimilarly, y_23 after a_18 to a_22.\n\ny_22 = y after 4 actions from start.\n\ny_18 to y_22: 4 steps.\n\ny_22 = y_18 + sum Δy for a_18 to a_21.\n\nSimilarly, y_23 = y_22 + Δy a_22.\n\nWe need y_22 <=2, y_23 <=2.\n\ny_18=3.\n\nTo have y_22 <=2, since y_18=3, net change over 4 actions <= -1.\n\nSimilarly, y_23 <=2.\n\nNow, y_29=9.\n\nThe minimal net change to go from y to 9 is 9-y, but with constraints.\n\nSuppose y_23 <=2, say y_23=2.\n\nThen from y_23=2 to y_29=9, in 6 steps: from turn 23 to 29, 6 actions: a_23 to a_28.\n\ny_23=2, after a_23: y_24, ..., after a_28: y_29.\n\nTo have y_29=9, need net +7 in 6 actions, which is impossible since max increase 6 with 6 U.\n\ny_23=2, y_24 <=3, ..., y_29 <= 2+6=8 <9, cannot reach y=9 in 6 steps from y=2.\n\nMax y_29=8 if all U from y_23=2.\n\ny_23=2, a_23 U, y_24=3, a_24 U, y_25=4, ..., a_28 U, y_29=8.\n\nThen need another action to y_30=9.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 at T=29 from y_23<=2.\n\nSimilarly, if y_23=1, max y_29=7, worse.\n\ny_23=0, max 6.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 before T=30 if we have y_23<=2.\n\nThus, minimal is at T=30 with y=9.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can choose any that satisfies.\n\nFor example, one simple way: go down to y=2 and stay until T=23, then go up.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: action D, to y_19=2\n\nThen stay at y=2 for turns 19,20,21,22,23? But actions.\n\nAt turn 18: after action, position turn 19.\n\nTurn 18: choose a_18, sets y_19.\n\nWe need to specify actions.\n\nStart: turn 18, position y=3.\n\na_18: D, then y_19=2\n\na_19: S, y_20=2\n\na_20: S, y_21=2\n\na_21: S, y_22=2  // T=22, y=2\n\na_22: S, y_23=2  // T=23, y=2\n\nThen go up:\n\na_23: U, y_24=3\n\na_24: U, y_25=4\n\na_25: U, y_26=5\n\na_26: U, y_27=6\n\na_27: U, y_28=7\n\na_28: U, y_29=8\n\na_29: U, y_30=9\n\nSo at turn 30, y=9.\n\nWe have actions from a_18 to a_29.\n\nNumber of actions: 12.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list until we reach.\n\nBut in the output, it should be the actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n\nBut we can reduce the stay actions by going down later, but same time.\n\nAnother sequence: start by staying at y=3 for a few turns, then go down.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 18: S, y_19=3\n\nTurn 19: S, y_20=3\n\nTurn 20: S, y_21=3  // T=21, y=3, safe\n\nTurn 21: D, y_22=2  // T=22, y=2 safe\n\nTurn 22: U, but if U, y_23=3, but T=23 y=3 unsafe! Cannot.\n\nSo at turn 22, since y_22=2, we cannot do U, must do S or D.\n\nSo turn 22: S, y_23=2  // T=23 safe\n\nThen turn 23: U, y_24=3\n\n...\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at turn 21 we do D to y_22=2, then turn 22 must not U, so S to y_23=2, then turn 23 U to y_24=3, etc.\n\nStill arrive at turn 30.\n\nI think it's fixed.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nWe need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 3 and 4 have multiple cars, but we already considered.\n\nIn the beginning, freeway 1 and 2 have left-moving cars, but we said always safe.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any time they can be unsafe.\n\nFreeway 1: car (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nSpan at T: [ -60 -36(T-18), -25 -36(T-18) ]\n\nFor T>=18, both ends decreasing, at T=18, [-60,-25], R=-25<0, and decreasing, so always R<0, L<0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 same.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus, the sequence can be as above.\n\nNow, to write the actions.\n\nSince the player is at (0,3) at turn 18, and we need actions from turn 18.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, action a_t.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: D  (to go down to y=2 at next turn)\n\nThen to stay at y=2:\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: S  // at turn 22, y=2\n\nTurn 22: S  // at turn 23, y=2\n\nThen up:\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U  // at turn 30, y=9\n\nAfter a_29, y_30=9.\n\nNow, H=12 actions, from turn 18 to 29.\n\nThe turns are from turn 18 to turn 29 for actions, reaching at turn 30.\n\nBut in the output, we list the actions until the one before reaching.\n\nIn the sequence, we reach after H actions.\n\nStart at turn t_1 with position.\n\nAfter first action, at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 18 + H, y=9.\n\nWith H=12, turn 30.\n\nActions: a_18 to a_29.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 18: D  \nTurn 19: S  \nTurn 20: S  \nTurn 21: S  \nTurn 22: S  \nTurn 23: U  \nTurn 24: U  \nTurn 25: U  \nTurn 26: U  \nTurn 27: U  \nTurn 28: U  \nTurn 29: U  \n}\n\nBut this is 12 lines, from turn 18 to 29.\n\nAfter turn 29 action U, at turn 30, y=9.\n\nWe can have a shorter sequence by not staying all time, but it doesn't save actions.\n\nFor example, we can go down and up between, but it might not help.\n\nSuppose at turn 18: S, y_19=3\n\nTurn 19: S, y_20=3\n\nTurn 20: D, y_21=2\n\nTurn 21: D, y_22=1  // T=22, y=1\n\nTurn 22: U, y_23=2  // T=23, y=2\n\nThen turn 23: U, y_24=3\n\n...\n\nSame, up to turn 29: U, y_30=9? y_23=2, turn 23: U, y_24=3; ... turn 29: U, y_30=9.\n\nActions: turn 18: S, 19:S, 20:D, 21:D, 22:U, 23:U, 24:U,25:U,26:U,27:U,28:U,29:U\n\nThat's 12 actions: 18 to 29.\n\nSame H.\n\nIn this case, at turn 21: D to y_22=1, T=22 y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nTurn 22: U to y_23=2, T=23 y=2, safe.\n\nThen up.\n\nBut same number.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the output, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5 to 8, only one car, but we considered.\n\nIn the sequence, when going up, at turn 24, y=3, which is after T=23, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nMinimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=11.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at turn 29.\n\ny_29=9.\n\ny_18=3, so net +6 in 11 steps, possible with 6 U and 5 S, for example.\n\nBut we need y_22 <=2 and y_23 <=2.\n\ny_22 at turn 22.\n\nTurn 22 is after 4 actions from start (a_18 to a_21 determine y_22).\n\ny_22 = y_18 + net change from a_18 to a_21.\n\n4 actions: net change, y_22 = 3 + net Δy.\n\nSet y_22 <=2, so net Δy <= -1.\n\nSimilarly, y_23 = y_22 + Δy a_22 <=2.\n\nNow, y_29=9.\n\nFrom y_23 to y_29: 6 actions (a_23 to a_28), y_29 = y_23 + net Δy from those.\n\ny_23 <=2, so max y_29 = y_23 + 6 <= 8 <9, since each U increases by 1.\n\ny_23 <=2, after 6 actions, y_29 <= 2+6=8 <9, cannot be 9.\n\nIf y_23=2, y_29<=8; if less, worse.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at turn 29 if y_23<=2.\n\nSimilarly for earlier.\n\nHence minimal at turn 30.\n\nSo H=12.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nI think we can output the sequence.\n\nIn the format, it should be the actions.\n\nSince the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nt_1=18.\n\nIn the box.\n\nSo for example:\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nAfter turn 29 action, at turn 30, position y=9.\n\nTo make it cleaner, we can have fewer S by using the second sequence with downs.\n\nBut same.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns required is 12. This is due to the need to avoid the unsafe times at turns \\(T = 22\\) and \\(T = 23\\) for freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\), where collisions would occur. The strategy involves moving down to \\(y = 2\\) by turn 19 and staying there until after turn 23 to remain safe during the critical periods. After turn 23, the player moves up directly to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 18: D** – Move down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 19.\n- **Turn 19: S** – Stay at \\(y = 2\\) (turn 20).\n- **Turn 20: S** – Stay at \\(y = 2\\) (turn 21).\n- **Turn 21: S** – Stay at \\(y = 2\\) (turn 22).\n- **Turn 22: S** – Stay at \\(y = 2\\) (turn 23).\n- **Turn 23: U** – Move up to \\(y = 3\\) (turn 24).\n- **Turn 24: U** – Move up to \\(y = 4\\) (turn 25).\n- **Turn 25: U** – Move up to \\(y = 5\\) (turn 26).\n- **Turn 26: U** – Move up to \\(y = 6\\) (turn 27).\n- **Turn 27: U** – Move up to \\(y = 7\\) (turn 28).\n- **Turn 28: U** – Move up to \\(y = 8\\) (turn 29).\n- **Turn 29: U** – Move up to \\(y = 9\\) (turn 30).\n\nAt turn 30, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is safe with no cars. The path avoids collisions:\n- Turns 19–23: At \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2), which is always safe.\n- Turns 24–29: During ascent, freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are safe at these times (not \\(T = 22\\) or \\(T = 23\\)).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal 12 turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 20.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span moves left with speed s, so at turn T, the span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]. For right-moving cars, it's [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nCollision happens at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn, so you don't collide with cars on the new row until you're actually there.\n\nThe player position updates: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on action U, D, S.\n\nI start at y=3 at turn 20.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I can only move up, down, or stay, and y is from 0 to 9, the minimal number of turns to go from 3 to 9 is 6, if I go up every turn. But I might hit cars, so I need to avoid them.\n\nI need to check for each turn and each y I might be on, whether there's a car that would cause a collision at that turn.\n\nThe collision depends on the car positions at the exact turn when I'm on that row.\n\nAlso, since the cars move continuously, I need to compute their spans at each turn relative to t_1=20.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=20.\n\nFor any future turn T, the time elapsed is Δt = T - 20.\n\nThen for each car, I can compute its span at turn T.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway, as given.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (h=12, τ=47, d=left, s=36)\n\nFor left-moving, span at T: [h - s(Δt), τ - s(Δt)] = [12 - 36(Δt), 47 - 36(Δt)]\n\nSince d=left.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (12,47,left,36)\n\n| Freeway | Cars |\n\nk=1: (12,47,left,36)\n\nk=2: (12,47,left,36)\n\nk=3: three cars: (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving cars, span is [τ + s(Δt), h + s(Δt)]\n\nSimilarly, k=4: same as k=3? (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nk=5: only one car (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nk=6: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nk=7: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nk=8: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nk=3 and k=4 have three cars each, but k=5 to k=8 have only one each.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9, which is the top row, I think y=9 is the goal, and no cars on y=9, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 might be safe, but y=0 is the bottom, and we start from there or something, but here we're at (0,3), which is x=0, y=3.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically, I think, since actions are U,D,S, so x is always 0? The position is given as (0, y), so I think player is always at x=0, and moves only in y-direction.\n\nCars are on the freeways, which are horizontal, I assume, at different y-levels.\n\nCollision when player is at y=k at turn T, and for that k, if there is a car whose span at T includes 0.\n\n0 is the x-coordinate where player is.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, I need to find when the span includes 0.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to check for any car on that row.\n\nFirst, let's handle the car movements.\n\nDefine Δt = T - 20.\n\nFor freeway 1: car (12,47,left,36)\n\nSpan at T: [12 - 36Δt, 47 - 36Δt]\n\nThis includes 0 when 12 - 36Δt <= 0 <= 47 - 36Δt\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same since identical.\n\nFor freeway 1:\n\n12 - 36Δt <= 0 <= 47 - 36Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36Δt <= 0 => 12 <= 36Δt => Δt >= 12/36 = 1/3\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 47 - 36Δt => 36Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/36 ≈ 1.3056\n\nSo for Δt from 1/3 to 47/36, approximately 0.333 to 1.305, so at turn T=20 + Δt, since turns are integers, Δt integer, T integer.\n\nΔt is integer because turns are discrete.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at T if Δt >=1 and Δt <=1? Let's see.\n\nΔt >= ceil(1/3) = 1? 1/3≈0.333, but Δt must be integer, so for Δt=1: 12-36*1=12-36=-24 <=0, and 47-36=11, 0<=11, yes.\n\nFor Δt=0: T=20, span [12,47], 0 not in [12,47], so no collision at t=20.\n\nΔt=1: T=21, span [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11], 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nΔt=2: T=22, span [12-72,47-72]=[-60,-25], 0 not in [-60,-25], so no.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision only at T=21.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same thing, collision only at T=21.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, so span: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-23 + 6 Δt, -12 + 6 Δt]\n\nIncludes 0 when -23 + 6Δt <= 0 <= -12 + 6Δt\n\nFirst: -23 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 23 => Δt <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 + 6Δt => 6Δt >= 12 => Δt >= 2\n\nSo for Δt=2,3\n\nΔt=2: -23+12= -11 <=0, -12+12=0, 0<=0, yes.\n\nΔt=3: -23+18= -5 <=0, -12+18=6, 0<=6, yes.\n\nΔt=4: -23+24=1 >0, not <=0? -23+24=1, which is greater than 0, so left inequality -23+6Δt <=0? 1 <=0 false, so 0 not less than or equal to -12+6Δt? Let's see the inequalities.\n\n0 is included if lower bound <=0 and upper bound >=0.\n\nLower bound: τ + s Δt = -23 + 6 Δt\n\nUpper bound: h + s Δt = -12 + 6 Δt\n\nSo -23 + 6Δt <= 0 and -12 + 6Δt >= 0\n\nSo -23 + 6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <= 23 => Δt <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so Δt <=3 since integer\n\n-12 + 6Δt >=0 => 6Δt >=12 => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt=2,3\n\nFor Δt=2: lower=-23+12=-11 <=0, upper=-12+12=0 >=0, yes\n\nΔt=3: lower=-23+18=-5<=0, upper=-12+18=6>=0, yes\n\nΔt=4: lower=-23+24=1 >0, not <=0, so no\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, span: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 6 Δt, -48 + 6 Δt]\n\nIncludes 0 when -59 + 6Δt <=0 and -48 + 6Δt >=0\n\nFirst: -59 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=59 => Δt <=59/6≈9.833\n\nSecond: -48 +6Δt >=0 => 6Δt >=48 => Δt >=8\n\nSo for Δt=8,9\n\nThird car on freeway 3: (30,19,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, span: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [19 + 6 Δt, 30 + 6 Δt]\n\nIncludes 0 when 19 +6Δt <=0 and 30 +6Δt >=0? But 19+6Δt >=19>0 for Δt>=0, so lower bound always positive, never <=0, so 0 never in span. Since min is at least 19, which is >0.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound larger, so no collision possible for this car.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only first two cars matter: collision at Δt=2,3 and Δt=8,9.\n\nΔt=2,3 from first car, Δt=8,9 from second car.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, I think: (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nSo same as above, collision at Δt=2,3 and Δt=8,9 for the cars that can hit.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nSame as the first car on freeway 3, so collision at Δt=2,3\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same, (-12,-23,right,6), collision Δt=2,3\n\nFreeway 7: same, collision Δt=2,3\n\nFreeway 8: same, collision Δt=2,3\n\nNow, freeway 1 and 2 have collision only at Δt=1, T=21.\n\nLet's summarize the dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\nFor a given freeway, collision occurs if for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car whose span includes 0.\n\nSo for freeway 1: dangerous at T=21\n\nFreeway 2: dangerous at T=21\n\nFreeway 3: dangerous when? From above, at Δt=2,3 (T=22,23) and Δt=8,9 (T=28,29)\n\nΔt = T-20, so T=20+Δt.\n\nSo freeway 3 dangerous at T=22,23,28,29\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same as 3, dangerous at T=22,23,28,29\n\nFreeway 5: dangerous at T=22,23 (since only Δt=2,3)\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: T=22,23\n\nFreeway 7: T=22,23\n\nFreeway 8: T=22,23\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 each have only one car, which causes collision at T=22,23.\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at turn t=20.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U (up), D (down), S (stay). y changes by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nI need to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous time.\n\nSpecifically, for turn T, if I am on freeway y_T, and y_T is between 1 and 8, and at that turn, for that freeway, it is dangerous, then collision.\n\nIf I am on y=0 or y=9, no car, so safe.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so when I reach y=9, I stop, I think.\n\nThe sequence should end when I reach (0,9), at some turn.\n\nMinimal H such that after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\nStarting from t=20, position y=3.\n\nAfter t=20, I perform actions at t=20,21,22,... up to some turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nAt turn T, I perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, the player position is y_t.\n\nThen I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if when I am at y_T, and y_T between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_T, at turn T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nNow, at turn T=20, I am at y=3, which is freeway 3? y=3 is row 3.\n\nFreeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3.\n\nAt turn T=20, what is the car situation?\n\nFor freeway 3 at T=20, Δt=0.\n\nCars: first car span [-12,-23]? Earlier for freeway 3, at Δt=0.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, h=-12, τ=-23? Span at Δt=0: for right-moving, [τ, h] = [-23, -12], since head is h, tail τ, and for right-moving, head is larger, I think.\n\nIn the car state, it says for freeway 3: (-12,-23,right,6), but which is head and tail?\n\nIt says: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor left-moving, head is left, I assume, but in the span update.\n\nFor left-moving: at t1, span is [h, τ], then moves left.\n\nIn the rule: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIn the description: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], with τ < h since moving right.\n\nIn freeway 3, cars: (-12,-23,right,6), so h=-12, τ=-23? But -23 < -12, so τ=-23, h=-12, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nSimilarly, second car (-48,-59,right,6), τ=-59, h=-48, span [-59,-48]\n\nThird car (30,19,right,6), but 19<30, so τ=19, h=30, span [19,30]\n\nAt T=20, Δt=0, for freeway 3:\n\nCar 1: span [-23,-12], 0 not in it.\n\nCar 2: span [-59,-48], 0 not in.\n\nCar 3: span [19,30], 0 not in.\n\nSo no collision at T=20 on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nBut player is at y=3 at T=20, and freeway 3 is not dangerous at T=20, so safe to be there.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: from y=3 to y=9, need +6, so at least 6 moves up.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns from t=20, so after H actions, I am at y_{20+H}.\n\nStart at t=20, y20=3.\n\nAfter action a20, y21 = y20 + Δy\n\nAfter a21, y22, and so on, up to after a_{20+H-1}, y_{20+H} =9.\n\nI need y_{20+H} =9.\n\nAnd I need for all t from 20 to 20+H-1, at position y_t, no collision at turn t? No.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn when I am on a freeway.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, and collision condition, then problem.\n\nFor T from 20 to 20+H-1, I am at y_T, which may not be the final position.\n\nAt turn 20+H, I am at y_{20+H}=9, which is safe, and that's the goal.\n\nBut for turns before that, I need to be safe.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous times for each row.\n\nI need to know for each row, at which turns it is dangerous to be there.\n\nRow y=1: dangerous at T=21 (from earlier)\n\nRow y=2: dangerous at T=21\n\nRow y=3: dangerous at T=22,23,28,29\n\nRow y=4: same as y=3? Freeway 4 has same cars as freeway 3, so dangerous at T=22,23,28,29\n\nRow y=5: freeway 5, only one car, dangerous at T=22,23\n\nSimilarly y=6: T=22,23\n\ny=7: T=22,23\n\ny=8: T=22,23\n\ny=1 and y=2 dangerous only at T=21.\n\ny=3 and y=4 dangerous at T=22,23,28,29\n\ny=5 to y=8 dangerous at T=22,23\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at T=20.\n\nAt T=20, y=3 is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to go up directly, but let's see the path.\n\nSince I need to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nFor example, at T=21, if I am on y=1 or y=2, collision.\n\nAt T=22 and T=23, if I am on y=3 to y=8, all are dangerous, except y=9 and y=0, but y=9 is goal.\n\nAt T=22, y=3 to y=8 all dangerous? Let's see.\n\ny=3: dangerous at T=22\n\ny=4: dangerous at T=22\n\ny=5: dangerous at T=22\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 all dangerous at T=22.\n\nSimilarly at T=23, same.\n\nThen at T=28,29, only y=3 and y=4 dangerous, but y=5 to y=8 not dangerous at those times.\n\nBut first, I need to handle T=21,22,23.\n\nAt T=21, y=1 and y=2 dangerous.\n\nBut I am at y=3 at T=20.\n\nAt T=20, I choose action, which affects y21.\n\ny21 = y20 + a20 action.\n\nIf I go up, y21=4\n\nDown, y21=2\n\nStay, y21=3\n\nNow, at T=21, if I am on y=1 or y=2, collision.\n\nBut y=3,4,etc are safe at T=21? Let's see.\n\nAt T=21, which rows are dangerous?\n\nOnly y=1 and y=2, because freeway 1 and 2 have collision only at T=21.\n\nFor other rows, at T=21, Δt=1.\n\nFor example, y=3: at T=21, Δt=1, freeway 3 cars: first car, span at Δt=1: for (-12,-23,right,6), span [ -23 +6*1, -12 +6*1] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-59+6,-48+6]=[-53,-42], no\n\nThird car: [19+6,30+6]=[25,36], no\n\nSimilarly, other freeways, at Δt=1, not dangerous except y=1 and y=2.\n\ny=1 at T=21: dangerous.\n\ny=2 dangerous at T=21.\n\ny=3 safe at T=21, similarly y=4,5,6,7,8 safe at T=21.\n\nSo at T=21, only avoid y=1 and y=2.\n\nBack to action at T=20.\n\nI am at y=3.\n\nIf I go up (U), y21=4, safe.\n\nIf I stay (S), y21=3, safe.\n\nIf I go down (D), y21=2, but at T=21, y=2 dangerous, collision! So I cannot go down.\n\nSo possible actions: U or S.\n\nNow, next, T=22.\n\nAt T=22, all rows y=3 to y=8 are dangerous, as we saw.\n\ny=3 dangerous, y=4 dangerous, ..., up to y=8.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are safe at T=22? Let's check.\n\nAt T=22, Δt=2.\n\nFreeway 1: span at Δt=2: [12-72,47-72]=[-60,-25], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nFreeway 2: same, safe.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 are freeways, but at T=22, no collision possible, so safe to be on.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nBut y=3 to y=8 dangerous at T=22.\n\nSpecifically, for y=3, dangerous at T=22; y=4, T=22; y=5, T=22; etc.\n\nAt T=22, if I am on y=3,4,5,6,7, or 8, collision.\n\nSo I must be on y=0,1,2, or 9 at T=22 to avoid collision.\n\nSimilarly at T=23, same situation: all y=3 to 8 dangerous, so must be on y=0,1,2,9.\n\nNow, at T=21, I am at y=4 if I went up, or y=3 if I stayed.\n\nCase 1: at T=20, I go up, so y21=4.\n\nThen at T=21, y=4, which is safe, as we said.\n\nNow for T=22, I need to be on y=0,1,2, or 9.\n\nBut y=9 is far, I am at y=4.\n\nFrom y=4, I can go to y=5,4,3 with U,S,D.\n\nBut at T=22, if I am on y=5, that's dangerous; y=4 dangerous; y=3 dangerous.\n\nAll of them are in 3-8.\n\nSo I need to go down to y=2 or less.\n\nFrom y=4, I can go down to y=3, but y=3 dangerous at T=22.\n\nOr down to y=2? With D, y22 = y21 + Δy from action at T=21.\n\nAt T=21, I choose action, which sets y22.\n\ny22 = y21 + a21 action.\n\ny21=4.\n\nIf I go down (D), y22=3\n\nBut y=3 dangerous at T=22.\n\nIf stay (S), y22=4, dangerous.\n\nIf up (U), y22=5, dangerous.\n\nAll lead to dangerous y at T=22.\n\nBut I need to be on y<=2 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is too high, y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps up, not possible in one step.\n\nSo from y=4, I can only go to y=3,4,5, all dangerous at T=22.\n\nBut y=2 is safe at T=22, but I can't reach y=2 from y=4 in one step; I can only change by 1.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=2 at T=22 if I was at y=4 at T=21.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 or y=0.\n\nBut from y=4, I can only go to y=3,4,5.\n\nAll dangerous.\n\nTherefore, if I was at y=4 at T=21, I cannot avoid collision at T=22, because whatever I do, y22 will be between 3 and 5, all dangerous.\n\ny22=3,4, or 5, all in 3-8, dangerous.\n\nSo collision inevitable.\n\nBut that can't be right; maybe I can go down earlier or something.\n\nAnother case: at T=20, I stay, so y21=3.\n\nThen at T=21, y=3, which is safe, as we said.\n\nNow at T=21, I need to choose action for y22.\n\ny21=3.\n\nIf I go down (D), y22=2\n\nIf stay (S), y22=3\n\nIf up (U), y22=4\n\nNow at T=22, y=2 is safe, y=3 dangerous, y=4 dangerous.\n\nSo if I go down to y22=2, then safe at T=22.\n\nIf I stay or up, dangerous.\n\nSo I must go down to y=2 at T=22.\n\nThen, similarly, at T=23, I need to be safe.\n\nAt T=23, all y=3 to 8 dangerous, so must be on y=0,1,2,9.\n\nI am at y=2 at T=22.\n\nThen action at T=22: I can go to y=1,2,3.\n\ny=3 dangerous at T=23, so I cannot go up.\n\nI can go down to y=1 or stay at y=2.\n\nBoth y=1 and y=2 are safe at T=23.\n\nBecause at T=23, for y=1 and y=2, no danger, as we saw earlier.\n\nOnly y=3-8 dangerous.\n\nSo I can stay at y=2 or go down to y=1.\n\nNow, after T=23, the danger is over except for y=3 and y=4 at T=28 and 29, but that might be later.\n\nFirst, let's get through T=22 and 23.\n\nSo, from start:\n\nAt T=20, y=3, I must not go up, because if I go up to y=4 at T=21, I get stuck.\n\nInstead, I should stay or go down, but going down to y=2 at T=21 might be bad? At T=21, y=2 is dangerous.\n\nAt T=20, if I go down, y21=2, but at T=21, y=2 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo I cannot go down at T=20.\n\nOnly options: stay or up.\n\nBut if I go up, to y=4 at T=21, then at T=22, I cannot escape danger.\n\nIf I stay, to y=3 at T=21, then at T=21, I can go down to y=2 at T=22.\n\nSo let's follow that.\n\nSequence:\n\nT=20: action S (stay), so y21 = y20 + 0 = 3\n\nAt T=21, position y=3, safe.\n\nAction at T=21: must go down to avoid danger at T=22.\n\nSo a21 = D, then y22 = y21 -1 = 3-1=2\n\nAt T=22, position y=2, which is safe, since only y=3-8 dangerous.\n\nNow at T=22, I need to choose action for y23.\n\ny22=2.\n\nOptions: D to y=1, S to y=2, U to y=3.\n\nAt T=23, y=3 dangerous, so I cannot go up to y=3.\n\nI can go down to y=1 or stay at y=2.\n\nBoth safe at T=23.\n\nSay, I stay: a22 = S, then y23=2\n\nOr go down: a22 = D, y23=1\n\nNow, after that, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut there is another danger at T=28 and 29 for y=3 and y=4.\n\nFirst, let's see how to minimize H.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nCurrently at T=22, y=2.\n\nAfter T=23, I can start moving up.\n\nBut at T=28 and 29, if I am on y=3 or y=4, collision.\n\nT=28 and 29 are future turns.\n\nFirst, let's assume I stay at y=2 for now.\n\nAt T=22, y=2\n\nAction: suppose I stay, a22=S, y23=2\n\nAt T=23, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I need to go up.\n\nBut y=3 and y=4 dangerous at T=28,29.\n\nT=28 is turn 28, current t=20, so Δt=8, T=28.\n\nSimilarly T=29.\n\nNow, turns: let's list the turns.\n\nCurrent turn: 20\n\nAfter actions: turn 21,22,23,... up to when I reach y=9.\n\nAt T=23, y=2 (if I stayed)\n\nThen I can start moving up.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=3 or y=4 at T=28 or T=29.\n\nSimilarly, other rows are safe at those times.\n\nNow, from y=2, I need to go to y=9, which requires 7 moves up, but I might stay or something.\n\nLet me denote the turn and y position.\n\nSet T=23: y=2\n\nThen at T=23, I choose action for y24.\n\nI want to go up.\n\nBut if I go up now, I might reach y=9 before T=28, or get stuck.\n\nT=28 is 5 turns after T=23? T=23 to T=24 is one step, etc.\n\nFrom T=23 to T=28 is 5 turns: T=24,25,26,27,28.\n\nAt T=23, y=2\n\nAfter action at T=23, y24.\n\nIf I go up each time, y24=3, y25=4, y26=5, y27=6, y28=7, y29=8, etc.\n\nAt T=28, y=7, which is not dangerous; only y=3 and y=4 dangerous at T=28.\n\nSimilarly at T=29, y=8 not dangerous.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nIf I go up from y=2 at T=23:\n\na23=U, y24=3\n\nBut at T=24, position y=3? T=24 is turn, y position at that turn.\n\nAt turn T=24, I am at y24.\n\nNow, is y=3 dangerous at T=24?\n\nEarlier, for y=3, dangerous only at T=22,23,28,29.\n\nT=24 is not dangerous for y=3.\n\nSimilarly, T=25,26,27 should be safe for all rows, I think.\n\nLet's confirm.\n\nFor y=3, dangerous at T=22,23,28,29.\n\nSimilarly for y=4, same.\n\nFor y=5 to 8, dangerous only at T=22,23, which have passed.\n\nT=22 and 23 are over when we reach T=24.\n\nAt T=24, for any row, no danger except later for y=3,4 at T=28,29.\n\nBut at T=24, y=3 is safe, for example.\n\nSimilarly, T=25,26,27 all safe for all rows.\n\nOnly at T=28 and 29, y=3 and y=4 dangerous.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nFrom T=23, y=2\n\nI go up: a23=U, y24=3\n\nAt T=24, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a24=U, y25=4\n\nT=25, y=4, safe.\n\na25=U, y26=5\n\nT=26, y=5, safe.\n\na26=U, y27=6\n\nT=27, y=6, safe.\n\na27=U, y28=7\n\nT=28, y=7, which is not dangerous (only y=3,4 dangerous), so safe.\n\na28=U, y29=8\n\nT=29, y=8, safe.\n\na29=U, y30=9\n\nAt T=30, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, check if all positions safe.\n\nAt T=20: y=3, safe\n\nT=21: y=3, safe (after stay at T=20)\n\nT=22: y=2, safe\n\nT=23: y=2, safe (we stayed or could go down, but we stayed)\n\nIn this sequence, at T=21, we went down to y=2 at T=22.\n\nAt T=22, we need to set y23.\n\nIn the above, I assumed at T=22, I stayed to y=2 at T=23.\n\nBut at T=22, y=2, I could go down to y=1.\n\nBut let's first write the actions.\n\nStart:\n\nT=20: S, so y21=3\n\nT=21: D, so y22=2\n\nT=22: S, so y23=2  (or D to y=1, but let's see)\n\nIn the path above, from T=23, I went up directly.\n\nBut at T=23, y=2, I went U to y24=3.\n\nThen continued up.\n\nNow, at T=28 and T=29, I was at y=7 and y=8, not dangerous.\n\nAnd reached y=9 at T=30.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=20 to t=29, that's 10 actions? Let's count.\n\nTurns: actions at t=20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29 → 10 actions, y from y20 to y30.\n\ny20=3, after 10 actions, y30=9.\n\nBut minimal could be less? From y=3 to y=9, min 6 actions, but we had to go down to y=2 and stay, so extra steps.\n\nIn this case, we have y: T=20:3, T=21:3, T=22:2, T=23:2, T=24:3, T=25:4, T=26:5, T=27:6, T=28:7, T=29:8, T=30:9\n\nSo positions from T=20 to T=30.\n\nBut we need to reach at some turn, and H is such that y_{20+H} =9.\n\nHere y30=9, so H=10, since from t=20 to t=29, 10 actions? t=20 to t=29 inclusive is 10 turns? Let's index.\n\nStart: at turn t=20, before action, y=3.\n\nAfter action a20, at turn t=21, y=y21.\n\nSimilarly, after a21, at t=22, y22, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=20+H, y_{20+H}.\n\nSet y_{20+H} =9.\n\nIn above, after a29, at t=30, y30=9, so H=10.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier.\n\nFor example, if I didn't have to go down, but I did to avoid T=22,23.\n\nAnother way: at T=20, I could go up to y=4 at T=21.\n\nBut then at T=21, y=4, I need to go down to avoid danger at T=22.\n\nFrom y=4, I can go down to y=3, but at T=22, y=3 dangerous.\n\nGo down to y=2? But from y=4, with one action, I can only go to y=3,4,5.\n\nCannot reach y=2 directly.\n\nUnless I go down multiple times, but at T=21, I can only set y22.\n\ny22 must be y21 ±1 or same.\n\ny21=4, so y22=3,4, or5, all dangerous at T=22.\n\nNo way to be on safe row at T=22 from y=4.\n\nTherefore, going up at T=20 is bad.\n\nSimilarly, going down at T=20 is worse, since y21=2, which is dangerous at T=21.\n\nSo only stay is possible at T=20.\n\nThen at T=21, go down to y=2 at T=22.\n\nThen at T=22, I can choose to go down or stay.\n\nIf I go down to y=1, for example.\n\nAt T=22, y=2, action D, then y23=1\n\nThen at T=23, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I need to go up.\n\nBut y=1 to y=9, need 8 steps up.\n\nBut I might reach later.\n\nIn the previous path, I stayed at y=2 for T=22 and T=23, then went up.\n\nBut at T=23, I could go up immediately.\n\nIn the sequence I had: T=23: y=2, then a23=U to y24=3 at T=24.\n\nBut at T=24, y=3, which is fine, but later at T=28, if I am on y=3 or y=4, danger.\n\nIn the direct up, I was at y=3 at T=24, which is before T=28, so safe.\n\nT=24 to T=27 are all safe.\n\nThen at T=28, I was at y=7.\n\nNow, can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, from y=2 at T=23, if I go up faster.\n\nBut I need to avoid y=3 and y=4 at T=28 and T=29.\n\nT=28 and T=29 are specific turns.\n\nFrom T=23, y=2.\n\nI can go up to y=3 at T=24, y=4 at T=25, etc.\n\nIf I go up without delay, y: T=24:3, T=25:4, T=26:5, T=27:6, T=28:7, T=29:8, T=30:9\n\nAs before.\n\nAt T=28, y=7, not 3 or 4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=29, y=8, safe.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach y=9 before T=30?\n\nFor example, if I start going up earlier.\n\nBut at T=20, I had to stay to avoid issues.\n\nAt T=21, I went down to y=2.\n\nAt T=22, I stayed at y=2.\n\nBut at T=22, I could go down to y=1, then from there go up.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=20: S, y21=3\n\nT=21: D, y22=2\n\nT=22: D, y23=1  (go down to y=1)\n\nThen at T=23, y=1, safe.\n\nThen go up:\n\nT=23: U, y24=2\n\nT=24: U, y25=3\n\nT=25: U, y26=4\n\nT=26: U, y27=5\n\nT=27: U, y28=6\n\nT=28: U, y29=7\n\nT=29: U, y30=8\n\nNot at 9 yet.\n\ny30=8, then need another action to y31=9.\n\nSo H=11, worse.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=23:\n\nT=23: U, y24=2\n\nBut y24=2 at T=24, then T=24: U, y25=3, etc., same as before but starting from lower.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, I need to be higher earlier, but I had to go down to avoid T=22,23.\n\nAnother idea: after T=23, when safe, go up fast, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nMinimal from y=2 to y=9 is 7 moves up, so at least 7 actions from T=23.\n\nT=23 to T=24,25,... after 7 actions, y_{23+7} = y30=2+7=9.\n\ny at T=23 is 2, after a23 to a29, 7 actions, y30=9.\n\nSimilarly, if I start from T=23 y=2, go up each turn, reach y=9 at T=30.\n\nIn the sequence, I had T=20 to T=29 actions, 10 actions.\n\nBut at T=20 and T=21, I had actions that didn't progress, like stay and down.\n\nSpecifically, at T=20: S, no change; T=21: D, down; then from T=22 to T=29: actions to go up.\n\nFrom T=22: y=2, then to T=30: y=9, that's 8 steps: from y=2 to y=9, delta=7, so 7 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt T=22, y=2 (after action at T=21)\n\nThen action at T=22 sets y23.\n\nIf I set y23=2 (stay), then y at T=23 is 2.\n\nThen actions: a23 to set y24, etc.\n\nAfter k actions from T=22, y_{22+k}\n\nSet y_{22+k} =9.\n\ny22=2, so need k=7, y_{29} =9? y_{22 + k} at turn 22+k.\n\nAfter 0 actions at T=22, y22=2.\n\nAfter a22, y23.\n\n...\n\nAfter a28, y29.\n\ny29 = y after a28.\n\nTo have y_m =9 for some m.\n\nIn terms of turns, at turn T, y_T.\n\nStart T=20, y=3.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn T=20+H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, T=20: y=3\n\nAfter a20: T=21, y=3 (if S) or etc.\n\nIn our case, after a20 (S): T=21, y=3\n\nAfter a21 (D): T=22, y=2\n\nAfter a22 (S): T=23, y=2\n\nThen after a23 (U): T=24, y=3\n\nAfter a24 (U): T=25, y=4\n\nAfter a25 (U): T=26, y=5\n\nAfter a26 (U): T=27, y=6\n\nAfter a27 (U): T=28, y=7\n\nAfter a28 (U): T=29, y=8\n\nAfter a29 (U): T=30, y=9\n\nSo y30=9, after actions from t=20 to t=29, that's 10 actions, H=10.\n\nCan I reduce?\n\nAt T=22, instead of staying, I could go up? But at T=22, if I go up to y=3, but at T=22, y=3 is dangerous! Because T=22 is dangerous for y=3.\n\nAt T=22, position y=2, if I go up, a22=U, then y23=3\n\nBut at turn T=23, position y=3, which is dangerous because T=23 is dangerous for y=3.\n\nIn the action at T=22, choosing U sets y23=3, and at turn T=23, I am at y=3, which is dangerous.\n\nSo I cannot do that.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at T=23, then I start from lower, worse.\n\nSo I think I have to stay at y=2 or go down at T=22 for T=23.\n\nBut going down wastes time.\n\nIn the sequence, I stayed at y=2 for T=23.\n\nThen from there, went up.\n\nNow, about T=28 and 29, but in the path, I was not on y=3 or 4 at those times.\n\nBut I could go faster to avoid being on y=3 or 4 at later times, but in this case, I was on y=3 and 4 at T=24 and T=25, which are safe, not at T=28,29.\n\nT=28,29 are later.\n\nIn fact, since I reached y=7 at T=28, it's fine.\n\nBut can I reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I didn't have the down move.\n\nBut I had to go down to avoid T=22.\n\nAnother possibility: at T=20, since I stay, y21=3.\n\nAt T=21, instead of going down, can I go up? To y=4 at T=22.\n\nBut at T=22, y=4 is dangerous, collision.\n\nGo down to y=2, but at T=21, if I go down, y22=2, which at T=22 is safe, as I did.\n\nBut at T=21, if I go down, y22=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=22, I could... but I need to be safe at T=23.\n\nIf at T=22, I go up to y=3, but at T=23, y=3 dangerous.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 or something, but that might take longer.\n\nI think the sequence I have is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the danger at T=28,29.\n\nIn my path, I am not on y=3 or 4 at those times, so fine.\n\nNow, H=10, but perhaps I can save one turn.\n\nSince at T=23, I am at y=2, and I go up immediately, but I have to go through y=3 and y=4 at some point, but at T=24 and 25, which are safe.\n\nIf I go up faster, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: after T=23, I go up, but I can reach y=9 at T=29? How?\n\nFrom y=2 at T=23, after 6 actions: to y=8 at T=29, then need another to y=9 at T=30.\n\ny at T=23: 2\n\nAfter a23: T=24, y=3\n\n...\n\nAfter a27: T=28, y=6? Let's count:\n\nT=23: y=2\n\na23=U: T=24, y=3\n\na24=U: T=25, y=4\n\na25=U: T=26, y=5\n\na26=U: T=27, y=6\n\na27=U: T=28, y=7\n\na28=U: T=29, y=8\n\na29=U: T=30, y=9\n\n7 actions from a23 to a29 to go from y=2 to y=9? y=2 to y=9 is 7 steps, so 7 actions to increase by 7.\n\nFrom T=23 y=2 to T=30 y=9, with actions at T=23 to T=29.\n\nBut in the beginning, I have actions from T=20 to T=22.\n\nTotal actions: T=20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29: 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can be at a higher position earlier, but I couldn't because of the danger.\n\nAt T=20, I could do nothing else.\n\nMaybe I can go down at some point to avoid, but I think not.\n\nAnother thought: at T=22, after I am at y=2, I stay for T=23, but I could go down to y=1, but that would make me lower, so I take longer to go up, worse.\n\nSo staying at y=2 for T=23 is fine.\n\nNow, about the later danger, but since I am not on y=3 or 4 at T=28,29, it's ok.\n\nBut in this sequence, I am on y=3 at T=24 and y=4 at T=25, which are fine.\n\nNow, but for freeway 3 and 4, dangerous at T=28,29, but I am not there then.\n\nNow, but let me confirm if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at T=20, I stay, y21=3\n\nT=21, I go down, y22=2\n\nNow at T=22, instead of staying, I go down to y=1? y23=1\n\nThen at T=23, y=1\n\nThen go up: T=23: U, y24=2\n\nT=24: U, y25=3\n\nT=25: U, y26=4\n\nT=26: U, y27=5\n\nT=27: U, y28=6\n\nT=28: U, y29=7\n\nT=29: U, y30=8\n\nThen need T=30: U, y31=9, so one more turn, H=11, worse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=2 for T=23.\n\nAt T=22, I could go up? But cannot, dangerous.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nIn the sequence, I have:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1} = S (since t1=20)\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{21} = D\n\nTurn t1+2: a_{22} = S\n\nThen Turn t1+3: a_{23} = U\n\nt1+4: a_{24} = U\n\nt1+5: a_{25} = U\n\nt1+6: a_{26} = U\n\nt1+7: a_{27} = U\n\nt1+8: a_{28} = U\n\nt1+9: a_{29} = U\n\nThen after a29, at t=30, y=9.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nt from t1 to t1+9, that's 10 turns of actions.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier at T=23.\n\nBut I am.\n\nAnother idea: after T=23, since T=28,29 are later, and I can be on y=3 or 4 before that.\n\nIn fact, in my sequence, I am on y=3 at T=24, y=4 at T=25, both before T=28, safe.\n\nIf I delay going up, I might hit the danger, but I don't need to.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=2 longer, then when I go up, I might be on y=3 or 4 at T=28 or 29.\n\nBut in this case, I go up immediately, so I avoid that.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=2 for more turns.\n\nFor example, at T=23, I stay: a23=S, y24=2\n\nThen T=24, y=2\n\nThen I can go up, but later.\n\nBut if I go up at T=24: U, y25=3\n\nThen continue, y26=4, y27=5, y28=6, y29=7, y30=8, y31=9, so H=11, worse.\n\nIf I go up faster, but I can't.\n\nSo minimal is to go up as soon as possible after safe.\n\nIn this case, from T=23 y=2, go up each turn to y=9 at T=30.\n\nNow, but at T=22, I stayed, but I could have done something else? No.\n\nIn the action at T=22, I set S to stay at y=2 for T=23.\n\nI could set D to go to y=1, but worse.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 3 and 4 at T=28,29, but since I not there, ok.\n\nNow, let me write the actions.\n\nt1 = 20\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: D\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nAfter Turn 29 action, y=9 at turn 30.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at t=29, which is t1+9.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9?\n\nThat is, reach y=9 at turn 29.\n\ny_{20+9} = y29=9.\n\nStart y20=3.\n\nAfter 9 actions, y29=9.\n\nNet change: from 3 to 9, +6, so possible only if I never go down, and go up 6 times, stay or something but must have exactly 6 up and 3 other actions, but other actions would be down or stay, which decrease y or no change, so to reach +6, I need at least 6 up, and if I have down or stay, I need more up or actions.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=3 in exactly 9 actions, I need net +6, so number of U minus number of D =6, and number of S = 9 - U - D.\n\nBut U + D + S =9, U - D =6.\n\nThen U = D +6, so D+6 + D + S =9, 2D + S =3.\n\nSo possible: if D=0, S=3, U=6\n\nOr D=1, S=1, U=7\n\nOr D=2, S=-1? Impossible, so only possibilities: (U,D,S) = (6,0,3) or (7,1,1) or (8,2,0) but U - D=6.\n\nIf U=6, D=0, S=3\n\nIf U=7, D=1, S=1\n\nIf U=8, D=2, S=0\n\nEtc.\n\nNow, in our case, to avoid collision, I had to go down at least once (at T=21), and stay once or more.\n\nIn the minimal, I had one down and one stay, and then ups.\n\nIn my sequence: actions: S (stay), D (down), S (stay), then U,U,U,U,U,U,U — that's 7 U? Let's list:\n\na20: S\n\na21: D\n\na22: S\n\na23: U\n\na24: U\n\na25: U\n\na26: U\n\na27: U\n\na28: U\n\na29: U\n\nSo U: 7 times, D:1 time, S:2 times (a20 and a22)\n\ny: start 3, after S:3, after D:2, after S:2, then after U:3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\nFrom a23 to a29: 7 U, from y=2 to y=9.\n\nNet: from y20=3 to y30=9, +6, but with one down and one stay, so I have extra actions.\n\nWith H=9, I need to reach y29=9.\n\ny20=3, so in 9 actions, to y29=9.\n\nNet +6.\n\nPossible if I have fewer downs or something.\n\nBut in the critical point, I had to go down to y=2 at some point.\n\nSuppose at T=20, I do U, but earlier we saw it leads to collision at T=22.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt T=20, S, y21=3\n\nAt T=21, instead of D, can I do U? y22=4, but at T=22, y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nDo S at T=21, y22=3, but at T=22, y=3 dangerous, collision.\n\nDo D at T=21, y22=2, safe at T=22.\n\nThen at T=22, I need to set y23.\n\nIf I set y23=2 or 1, safe at T=23.\n\nThen to reach y29=9.\n\ny22=2 at T=22.\n\nAfter actions a22 to a28, 7 actions, to y29.\n\ny22=2, y29=9, need +7 in 7 actions, so must go up all 7 times, no down or stay.\n\nSo a22 to a28 all U.\n\nThen y23=3, y24=4, y25=5, y26=6, y27=7, y28=8, y29=9.\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt T=22: y=2, safe.\n\nT=23: y=3, but T=23 is dangerous for y=3! Collision.\n\nBecause at T=23, y=3, and freeway 3 dangerous.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=3 at T=23.\n\nTherefore, with this, collision.\n\nIf at T=22, I set y23=1 (go down), then y23=1 at T=23, safe.\n\nThen a23 to a28: if all U, y24=2, y25=3, y26=4, y27=5, y28=6, y29=7, not 9.\n\ny29=7, not 9.\n\nTo reach y29=9, from y23=1, need +8 in 6 actions? y at T=23 is y23.\n\nAfter a23 to a28, 6 actions, to y29.\n\ny23=1, y29=9, need +8 in 6 actions, impossible since max increase 6.\n\ny23=1, after a23: y24, ..., after a28: y29.\n\nWith 6 actions, max y29=1+6=7.\n\nCannot reach 9.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at T=29.\n\nSimilarly, with H=9, y29=9 not possible without collision or impossible.\n\nThus H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have S at T=22, but I could have other actions, but not beneficial.\n\nSo the action sequence:\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: D\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=10, so actions from t=20 to t=29.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the car at later time, but since I not on y=3 or 4 at T=28,29, fine.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=24, y=3, which is freeway 3, but at T=24, not dangerous, as Δt=4, etc., no car at 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nNow, write in the format.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 20\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 2\\) to avoid the dangerous turns \\(t = 22\\) and \\(t = 23\\) for rows \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\), and then moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\).\n\n- At turn 20, staying at \\(y = 3\\) is safe because no collision occurs on freeway 3 at \\(t = 20\\).\n- At turn 21, moving down to \\(y = 2\\) avoids the danger on \\(y = 3\\) at \\(t = 22\\), and \\(y = 2\\) is safe at \\(t = 21\\) since only \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are dangerous at \\(t = 21\\), but moving to \\(y = 2\\) occurs at \\(t = 22\\).\n- At turn 22, staying at \\(y = 2\\) ensures safety at \\(t = 23\\) because \\(y = 2\\) is safe at \\(t = 23\\) (only \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are dangerous).\n- From turn 23 onwards, moving up each turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) by turn 30. The positions at \\(t = 24\\) to \\(t = 29\\) avoid the later dangerous turns \\(t = 28\\) and \\(t = 29\\) for \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) by being on higher rows.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 20: Stay (S), position remains (0, 3), safe.\n- Turn 21: Down (D), position to (0, 2), safe at \\(t = 22\\).\n- Turn 22: Stay (S), position remains (0, 2), safe at \\(t = 23\\).\n- Turn 23: Up (U), position to (0, 3), safe at \\(t = 24\\) (not dangerous for \\(y = 3\\)).\n- Turn 24: Up (U), position to (0, 4), safe at \\(t = 25\\) (not dangerous for \\(y = 4\\)).\n- Turn 25: Up (U), position to (0, 5), safe.\n- Turn 26: Up (U), position to (0, 6), safe.\n- Turn 27: Up (U), position to (0, 7), safe at \\(t = 28\\) (not \\(y = 3\\) or \\(y = 4\\)).\n- Turn 28: Up (U), position to (0, 8), safe at \\(t = 29\\) (not \\(y = 3\\) or \\(y = 4\\)).\n- Turn 29: Up (U), position to (0, 9), goal reached.\n\nAfter the action at turn 29, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 30. No shorter sequence is possible due to the need to avoid collisions at \\(t = 22\\) and \\(t = 23\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 22, and I start at y=2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. The cars are on freeways 1 through 8, and I have to avoid them when I'm on their row at the same turn. The collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe player position updates at each turn: if I choose U, y increases by 1; D, y decreases by 1; S, stay the same. But y must stay between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, the cars: for each car, given its state at turn t_1=22, I need to find where it is at future turns.\n\nLet me denote the time elapsed from t_1 as τ = T - t_1, so at time T, τ = T - 22.\n\nFor left-moving cars: the span at time T is [h - s * τ, τ - s * τ]. Since it's moving left, h and τ are decreasing.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and then Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)].\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, head is the right end? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and h and τ are given, with direction left.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36). Since direction is left, and it says head and tail, but in the span, it's [h, τ] for left-moving? But h and τ are both negative, which makes sense because the road is from -∞ to ∞, I assume.\n\nThe x-position is on a line, and 0 is the point we care about for collision.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nLet's clarify the span.\n\nFor a left-moving car: at t_1, span is [h, τ] with h > τ, I think? No.\n\nIn the notation: for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and then it moves left, so at T, it's [h - sτ, τ - sτ], where τ = T - t_1.\n\nBut if it's moving left, the positions decrease, so if at t_1, [h, τ] with h and τ, and since it's left-moving, I think h is the head, which is the front, so for left-moving, front is left? I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's look back: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd in the car state, for freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36). So h = -60, τ = -25.\n\nNow, since it's left-moving, and span [h, τ] = [-60, -25], which means the car occupies from x=-60 to x=-25 at t_1. Since it's moving left, the head is at x=-25 (the right end) and tail at x=-60? But it says \"head h\" and \"tail τ\", so for left-moving, h is tail or head?\n\nThe notation says \"head h, tail τ\", but in the span [h, τ], for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head (front) should be at the left end, so smaller x.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in terminology.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" is always the front, and for left-moving, front is left, so smaller x.\n\nIn freeway 1: h = -60, τ = -25, left direction. x=-60 is smaller than x=-25, so if it's left-moving, the car is from x=-60 to x=-25, with head at x=-60 and tail at x=-25? But tail is usually the back.\n\nI think \"head\" means the leading end, and for left-moving, leading end is left, so smaller x.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, leading end is right, larger x.\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, (head, tail) = (h, τ) with h < τ since left.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36), h=-60, τ=-25, and -60 < -25, so h < τ, so span [h, τ] = [-60, -25].\n\nAt time T, span [h - sτ, τ - sτ] with τ = T - t_1.\n\ns is speed, so for left-moving, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd in car state, for example freeway 3: (0, -11, right, 6), so for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ and h, with h being head.\n\nFor right-moving, head is larger x.\n\nSo in freeway 3: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (0, -11, right, 6), so h = 0 (head), τ = -11 (tail), and since right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-11, 0].\n\nThen at T, [τ + sτ, h + sτ] with τ = T - t_1.\n\nsτ here is s * (T-t_1), not the tail.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's use Δt for the time difference.\n\nSet t_1 = 22.\n\nAt time T, let Δt = T - t_1.\n\nFor a car on a freeway:\n\n- If left-moving: span at T is [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\n- If right-moving: span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nAnd collision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at T.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose an action to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am still on y_T, so I only care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen I decide to move at turn T, I am on y_T during turn T, and after the action, I move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that row at turn T.\n\nNow, I start at y=2 at turn 22.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is the top, but y=9 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think. y=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top, and freeways are in between.\n\nThe player can be on y=0 to y=9, but cars are only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so it's safe to be there.\n\nI start at (0,2), which is on freeway y=2, so at turn 22, I need to check if there is collision at (0,2).\n\nBut the task is to find actions from turn t_1 onwards, so at turn t_1=22, I am already at (0,2), and I need to choose action for turn t_1 to go to y_{23}, and so on.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so H actions, and after H turns, I reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turns: at turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), and I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}, and I want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nThe actions are from t = t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so after H actions, at time t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H} should be 9.\n\ny starts at y_{t_1} = 2.\n\nSo I need to go from y=2 to y=9, which is a difference of 7, so minimum H if I only go up is 7 turns, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, but since I need to go up, going down might not help, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 = 22.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving: h = -60, τ = -25, s = 36, dir left.\n\nAt time T, span: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-60 - 36 Δt, -25 - 36 Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval, so -60 -36 Δt <= 0 <= -25 -36 Δt\n\nBut since both ends are negative, and decreasing, 0 is greater than both, so 0 is never in this interval because the upper bound is negative. -25 -36 Δt <= -25 < 0 for all Δt >=0, so 0 > upper bound, so never collision on freeway 1. Similarly for freeway 2, same as freeway 1: (-60,-25,left,36), same thing, no collision possible.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars: (0, -11, right, 6), (-36, -47, right, 6)? head and tail.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], so for first car: (head h=0, tail τ=-11, right, s=6), so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt time T, span: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-11 + 6 Δt, 0 + 6 Δt]\n\nSecond car: (-36, -47, right, 6), so head h=-36? head is given first, but for right-moving, head should be larger, but here h=-36, τ=-47? -36 > -47, so h=-36 is larger, so head at -36, tail at -47.\n\nCar state: (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is larger x, tail is smaller x.\n\nSo second car: head h=-36, tail τ=-47, both negative, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-47 + 6 Δt, -36 + 6 Δt]\n\nThird car: (42, 31, right, 6), head h=42, tail τ=31, so span at t_1: [31, 42]? [τ, h] = [31, 42]\n\nAt T: [31 + 6 Δt, 42 + 6 Δt]\n\nNow for freeway 4, same as freeway 3: three cars identical to freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: one car (0, -11, right, 6), same as first car on freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 6: same, (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 7: same, (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 8: same, (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nSo freeways 5 to 8 each have one car like the first one on freeway 3.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nStart with freeway 1 and 2: as I said, no collision possible, since cars are always left of 0.\n\nFreeway 1: span at T: [-60 -36Δt, -25 -36Δt], both ends negative and decreasing, so always less than 0, so 0 never in span. Similarly freeway 2.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: span at T: [-11 + 6Δt, 0 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -11 +6Δt <= 0 <= 6Δt\n\nWhich is 0 <= 6Δt and -11 +6Δt <=0, so Δt >=0 and Δt <= 11/6 ≈1.833\n\nSince Δt integer (turns), so for Δt = 0,1\n\nAt Δt=0: span [-11,0], 0 included? 0 <=0 is true, and -11<=0 true, so yes, 0 in [-11,0].\n\nAt Δt=1: span [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], 0 in it? -5<=0<=6 yes.\n\nAt Δt=2: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, Δt=3: [7,18], etc., no.\n\nSecond car: span at T: [-47 +6Δt, -36 +6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -47+6Δt <=0 <= -36+6Δt\n\nSo 0 <= -36+6Δt and -47+6Δt <=0\n\nFirst: -36+6Δt >=0 => Δt >=6\n\nSecond: -47+6Δt <=0 => Δt <= 47/6≈7.833\n\nSo for Δt=6,7\n\nAt Δt=6: span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nAt Δt=7: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nAt Δt=8: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], no.\n\nThird car: span [31+6Δt, 42+6Δt], both positive and increasing, so min is 31>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4, same as freeway 3.\n\nNow freeways 5,6,7,8: each has only one car like first car on freeway 3: (0,-11,right,6), so span at T: [-11+6Δt, 6Δt]\n\n0 in span when -11+6Δt <=0 <=6Δt, so Δt >=0 and Δt <= 11/6≈1.833, so Δt=0,1.\n\nAt Δt=0: span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=1: [-5,6], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=2: [1,12], no\n\nNow, for each freeway, the dangerous times when there is a car at x=0.\n\nSummarize:\n\nFreeway 1: never dangerous\n\nFreeway 2: never\n\nFreeway 3: dangerous at Δt=0,1 (from first car), and at Δt=6,7 (from second car)\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3\n\nFreeway 5: dangerous at Δt=0,1\n\nFreeway 6: dangerous at Δt=0,1\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous at Δt=0,1\n\nFreeway 8: dangerous at Δt=0,1\n\nΔt is from t_1, so turn T = t_1 + Δt = 22 + Δt.\n\nNow, I start at turn 22, y=2.\n\nAt turn 22, Δt=0, I am on y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 is y=2? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2: we said never dangerous, so at turn 22, on y=2, no collision, good.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since I start at y=2, need to go to y=9, difference 7, so min H=7 if I can go up every turn without collision.\n\nBut I might not be able to, due to cars.\n\nNow, let's see the dangerous times for each row.\n\nI need to be on row y at turn T only if it's safe at that turn.\n\nSince I start at y=2 at t=22.\n\nLet me list for each row, when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car at x=0.\n\nFor y=1: freeway 1, always safe.\n\ny=2: freeway 2, always safe.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, dangerous at Δt=0,1,6,7\n\nSince Δt= T-22, so at turns: for y=3, dangerous when T-22 =0,1,6,7, i.e., turns 22,23,28,29\n\nSafe when not these times.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: freeway 4, same as y=3, dangerous at turns 22,23,28,29\n\ny=5: freeway 5, dangerous at Δt=0,1, so turns 22,23\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly y=6: dangerous turns 22,23\n\ny=7: dangerous turns 22,23\n\ny=8: dangerous turns 22,23\n\nNow, I start at t=22, y=2.\n\nAt t=22, y=2 is safe, as we said.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe always, no cars.\n\nThe actions: I can choose to stay, go up, or go down each turn.\n\nBut going down might not help since I need to go up.\n\nI should try to go up as much as possible, but avoid the dangerous times.\n\nStart from t=22.\n\nAt t=22, I am at y=2.\n\nI choose action for turn 22: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I choose U, I go to y=3 at t=23.\n\nBut at t=23, if I am on y=3, it is dangerous? Let's see.\n\nAt t=22, Δt=0.\n\nAfter action at t=22, I move to y_{23} for turn 23.\n\nAt turn T, I am on y_T.\n\nAt turn 22, I am on y=2.\n\nI choose a_{22}, which determines y_{23}.\n\nThen at turn 23, I am on y_{23}, and so on.\n\nAt each turn T, I need y_T to be safe, meaning no collision on that row at that turn.\n\nFor row y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, at t=22, y=2 is safe.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe direct way: go up to y=3 at t=23.\n\nBut at t=23, if I am on y=3, is it safe?\n\ny=3 is dangerous at turns 22,23,28,29.\n\nAt turn 23, Δt=1, which is dangerous for y=3.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=4 at t=23, y=4 is also dangerous at t=23.\n\nt=23 is dangerous for y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are dangerous at t=22 and t=23 only.\n\ny=3 and y=4 are also dangerous at t=28,29.\n\nBut at t=23, all rows from y=3 to y=8 are dangerous except y=1 and y=2.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are always safe.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, always safe, y=2 always safe.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nAt t=22, I am at y=2.\n\nIf I choose S, stay at y=2 for t=23? No.\n\nAction at turn T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nI choose a_T:\n\n- If U, y_{T+1} = y_T + 1\n\n- If D, y_{T+1} = y_T - 1\n\n- If S, y_{T+1} = y_T\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T.\n\nNow, start at t=22, y=2.\n\nI need to choose a_{22}, which sets y_{23}.\n\nSimilarly, then a_{23} sets y_{24}, and so on.\n\nI want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, at t=22, y=2 safe.\n\nIf I go up, a_{22} = U, then y_{23} = 3.\n\nThen at turn 23, I am at y=3.\n\nBut at turn 23, y=3 is dangerous (since Δt=1 for T=23, Δt=1, dangerous for y=3).\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, a_{22}=D, y_{23}=1, then at turn 23, y=1 is safe, but I go down, which is away from goal.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nIf I stay, a_{22}=S, y_{23}=2, then at turn 23, y=2 safe.\n\nBut I need to move up eventually.\n\nSince t=23 is dangerous for many rows, I should avoid being on rows 3-8 at t=23.\n\nSimilarly, at t=22, if I am on y=2, it's safe, but if I move to y=3 at t=23, it will be dangerous at t=23.\n\nSo, I should not move to a row that is dangerous at that turn.\n\nAt turn 22, I can choose to stay or go down, but going down not good.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=2 for one turn.\n\nThen at t=23, if I am at y=2, it's safe.\n\nThen I can go up at t=23 to y=3, but at turn 24, I am at y=3.\n\nLet's see the safe times.\n\nFirst, list for each row, the safe turns.\n\nSince turns are from t=22 onwards.\n\nSet T = turn number.\n\nT >= 22.\n\nFor row y=1: always safe\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: dangerous at T=22,23,28,29; safe when T not these.\n\ny=4: dangerous at T=22,23,28,29; same as y=3.\n\ny=5: dangerous at T=22,23; safe for T>=24\n\ny=6: dangerous at T=22,23; safe T>=24\n\ny=7: dangerous at T=22,23; safe T>=24\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=22,23; safe T>=24\n\nAnd y=9: always safe.\n\nI start at T=22, y=2.\n\nAt T=22, y=2 safe.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some T.\n\nSince min steps is 7, but I may need to wait.\n\nNow, at T=22, if I go up to y=3 at T=23? Action a_{22}: if U, y_{23} = 3.\n\nThen at turn T=23, I am at y=3, which is dangerous (since T=23 is dangerous for y=3).\n\nCollision.\n\nIf I go down to y=1, a_{22}=D, y_{23}=1, then at T=23, y=1 safe, but now I am at y=1, need to go up to 9, even farther.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf I stay, a_{22}=S, y_{23}=2, then at T=23, I am at y=2, safe.\n\nNow, at T=23, I am at y=2.\n\nI can choose a_{23}: if I go up, U, then y_{24} = 3.\n\nThen at turn T=24, I am at y=3.\n\nIs y=3 safe at T=24?\n\ny=3 dangerous at 22,23,28,29; T=24 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up from there.\n\nLet's see the path.\n\nStart: T=22, y=2\n\na_{22} = S (stay), so y_{23} = 2\n\nAt T=23, y=2, safe (since y=2 always safe)\n\nNow a_{23}: I can choose U, so y_{24} = 3\n\nThen at T=24, y=3, now T=24, not dangerous for y=3 (dangerous only 22,23,28,29), so safe.\n\nThen a_{24}: U, y_{25} =4\n\nAt T=25, y=4, now y=4 dangerous at 22,23,28,29; T=25 not, so safe.\n\na_{25}: U, y_{26}=5\n\nAt T=26, y=5, y=5 dangerous only at 22,23, so safe for T>=24, yes.\n\na_{26}: U, y_{27}=6\n\nAt T=27, y=6, safe (dangerous only 22,23)\n\na_{27}: U, y_{28}=7\n\nAt T=28, y=7, now y=7 dangerous at 22,23; T=28 not 22 or 23, so should be safe? y=7 is freeway 7, which is dangerous only at T=22 and T=23, as per above.\n\ny=7: freeway 7, dangerous at Δt=0,1, so T=22,23.\n\nT=28, Δt=6, not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=28 should be safe.\n\nBut at T=28, y=3 and y=4 are dangerous.\n\nBut I will be on y=7 at T=28.\n\ny=7 safe at T=28.\n\nSimilarly, a_{28}: U, y_{29}=8\n\nAt T=29, y=8, now y=8 dangerous at T=22,23; T=29 not, so safe.\n\nThen a_{29}: U, y_{30}=9\n\nAt T=30, y=9, safe, reached.\n\nNow, how many turns: actions from t=22 to t=29 inclusive? Let's list the turns.\n\nActions at turns: t=22, t=23, t=24, t=25, t=26, t=27, t=28, t=29.\n\nThat's 8 actions.\n\nAfter action at t=29, y_{30}=9.\n\nH=8 turns? But min possible is 7, since from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps up.\n\nIn this path, I stayed one extra turn at y=2.\n\nCan I do it in 7?\n\nIf I go directly, but at t=23, if I go to y=3, it is dangerous.\n\nPerhaps I can go to another row.\n\nAt t=22, I am at y=2.\n\nIf I go up immediately, to y=3 at t=23, but at t=23, y=3 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at t=23, but then I have to come back, worse.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=3 at a later time.\n\nBut y=3 is dangerous only at t=22,23,28,29.\n\nSo after t=23, it is safe until t=28.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nTo go from y=2 to y=9 in 7 steps, I need to increase y by 1 each turn for 7 turns.\n\nSo the sequence: start y_{22}=2\n\nThen after actions, y_{23}=3, y_{24}=4, ..., up to y_{29}=9.\n\ny_{29}=9, so actions from t=22 to t=28? Let's see.\n\nAt t=22, action a_{22} determines y_{23}\n\nIf I set y_{23}=3, y_{24}=4, ..., y_{29}=9.\n\nThen actions at t=22 to t=28, that's 7 actions.\n\ny_{29}=9.\n\nNow, at each turn, need to be safe.\n\nAt turn T=22: y=2, safe.\n\nT=23: y=3, but at T=23, y=3 is dangerous, collision.\n\nSimilarly, T=24: y=4, at T=24, y=4 should be safe? y=4 dangerous at 22,23,28,29; T=24 not, so safe.\n\nBut at T=23, y=3 is not safe.\n\nSo I cannot have y=3 at T=23.\n\nIn the direct 7-step path, y must be 3 at T=23, but it is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at T=24 is safe, etc.\n\nBut since I need y=3 at some point, but at T=23 it is not possible.\n\nI could be at y=3 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=2 for one turn, then go to y=3 at T=24, as I did earlier, but that takes 8 turns.\n\nCan I reach y=9 earlier?\n\nPerhaps go down first, but that seems worse.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 and y=2 are always safe, I can go to y=1 quickly, but that is down.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nPerhaps I can skip some rows or something, but I have to go through each, since I can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nI must pass through y=3 to y=8 to reach y=9.\n\nBut I can be on them at different times.\n\nIn the direct path, the only problem is at T=23 for y=3.\n\nIf I can be at y=3 at a safe time, but in the min time path, I have to be at y=3 at T=23 if I start at T=22 y=2 and go up each step.\n\nBut T=23 is not safe for y=3.\n\nSo I need to delay or something.\n\nPerhaps start by going up later.\n\nBut I am at y=2 at T=22.\n\nIf I stay at T=22, y=2, then at T=23, I can be at y=2 or y=3 or y=1.\n\nIf I go to y=3 at T=24, as before.\n\nBut that takes min 8 turns.\n\nCan I be at y=9 at T=29 with 7 actions? Actions from t=22 to t=28, y_{29}=9.\n\ny_{22}=2, y_{23}=?, ..., y_{29}=9.\n\nThe y values: y_{22}=2, y_{23} must be 1,2, or 3.\n\nTo reach y=9 in 7 steps, y_{23} must be 3, since from 2 to 9 in 7 steps, y increases by 1 each step.\n\ny_{23}=3, y_{24}=4, ..., y_{29}=9.\n\nSo y_T for T=23 to 29: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, at T=23, y=3 must be safe, but it is not.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach in 7 turns without collision.\n\nThus, min H is 8.\n\nIn my earlier path, with H=8, I reached at T=30.\n\nWith H=8 actions, from t=22 to t=29, y_{30}=9.\n\nIn that path, I had a_{22}=S, so y_{23}=2, then a_{23}=U, y_{24}=3, etc.\n\nBut at T=24, y=3 is safe, as we said.\n\nIn that path, I have to be careful at later times.\n\nIn the path: after a_{23}=U, y_{24}=3, at T=24, y=3 safe.\n\na_{24}=U, y_{25}=4, at T=25, y=4 safe.\n\na_{25}=U, y_{26}=5, T=26, y=5 safe.\n\na_{26}=U, y_{27}=6, T=27, y=6 safe.\n\na_{27}=U, y_{28}=7, T=28, y=7 safe.\n\na_{28}=U, y_{29}=8, T=29, y=8 safe.\n\na_{29}=U, y_{30}=9, T=30, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, at T=28, y=7, which is safe, as y=7 dangerous only at T=22,23.\n\nSimilarly T=29, y=8 safe.\n\nBut what about y=3 and y=4 at T=28 and T=29?\n\nAt T=28, y=3 and y=4 are dangerous, but I am not on them; I am on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=29, I am on y=8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, with this, I reach at T=30 with H=8 actions.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nH=7 is impossible, as we saw.\n\nPerhaps I can start by going up at T=22 but to a different row, but I can only go to y=3 or stay or down.\n\nNo choice.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=1 at some point, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nSo min H=8.\n\nBut in the actions, I have a_{22}=S, which is stay, but I could have gone down or something, but not useful.\n\nAnother idea: at T=22, I go up to y=3, but since at T=23 it is dangerous, I cannot be there at T=23.\n\nBut I have to be there at turn T=23 if I go up.\n\nUnless I don't go directly.\n\nBut I think 8 is min.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by going faster, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nUnless I am on y=9 earlier.\n\nFor example, if I start at y=2, and in 6 moves, I can be at y=8, but not 9.\n\ny_{22}=2, after k actions, y_{22+k} = 2 + net up.\n\nTo reach y=9, need net +7, so min 7 actions to y_{29}=9.\n\nBut as above, not possible.\n\nWith 7 actions, y_{29}=9.\n\ny_{22}=2, y_{23}=y_{22} + delta a, etc.\n\ny_{29} = y_{22} + sum of actions from t=22 to t=28.\n\nEach action contributes +1, -1, or 0.\n\nTo have y_{29} =9, and y_{22}=2, so sum of actions from t=22 to t=28 must be +7.\n\nSince each action changes y by at most 1, and I need to increase by 7 in 7 actions, so all actions must be U, and y increases by 1 each step: y_{23}=3, y_{24}=4, ..., y_{29}=9.\n\nNo choice; must be exactly that sequence for min time.\n\nBut at T=23, y=3 must be safe, which it is not.\n\nTherefore, impossible in 7 turns.\n\nThus min H=8.\n\nIn H=8, I have one extra action, which I used to stay at y=2 for one turn.\n\nI could stay at another row, but y=2 is fine.\n\nIn the path, I reached at T=30.\n\nNow, in the actions, for the sequence.\n\nIn my path: actions at t=22: S (stay, so y_{23}=2)\n\nt=23: U (up, y_{24}=3)\n\nt=24: U (y_{25}=4)\n\nt=25: U (y_{26}=5)\n\nt=26: U (y_{27}=6)\n\nt=27: U (y_{28}=7)\n\nt=28: U (y_{29}=8)\n\nt=29: U (y_{30}=9)\n\nNow, at each turn, position:\n\nT=22: y=2, safe\n\nT=23: y=2, safe (after action S, I am still at y=2 at turn 23)\n\nAt turn T=23, I am at y=2, and I choose action, which sets y_{24}.\n\nThen at T=24, I am at y=3, and so on.\n\nAll safe as above.\n\nBut I need to confirm if at any point I might be on a row when it is dangerous.\n\nFor example, at T=28, I am at y=7, which is safe, as y=7 dangerous only at 22,23.\n\nSimilarly, T=29, y=8 safe.\n\ny=3 is dangerous at T=28 and 29, but I am not on it.\n\nSo fine.\n\nBut in the car states, for y=3 and y=4, they have cars at T=28 and 29, but since I am not on those rows at those times, no collision.\n\nNow, the problem is to output the actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nt_1=22.\n\nSo actions: from t=22 to t=29, but H=8 actions.\n\nThe sequence should be for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, t_1=22, H=8, so actions at t=22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29.\n\nWith the actions above.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo Turn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 30, y=9.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier with H=8?\n\nFor example, if I go up immediately but avoid the danger.\n\nSuppose at t=22, I go up to y=3, but then at t=23, I must be on y=3, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=22, I go down to y=1, then at t=23, y=1 safe, but then I need to go up, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example: a_{22}=D, y_{23}=1\n\nThen at T=23, y=1 safe.\n\nThen a_{23}=U, y_{24}=2\n\nThen a_{24}=U, y_{25}=3\n\nBut at T=25, y=3 is safe? T=25, Δt=3, not dangerous for y=3.\n\nThen continue up, but I reached y=3 at T=25, later than before.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=31 or something, worse.\n\nSo the first path is better.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster in some way, but no.\n\nAnother thought: since y=1 is safe, and I can go to y=1 then up, but not faster.\n\nSo the min time is H=8 with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, I used S at first, but I could use U later or something, but same.\n\nNow, but I need to make sure about the later dangerous times.\n\nFor example, at T=28 and T=29, y=3 and y=4 are dangerous, but in my path, I am on y=7 and y=8 at those times, which are safe.\n\ny=7 at T=28: freeway 7, dangerous only at T=22,23, so T=28 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at T=29 safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list the turns when I am on each row.\n\nIn the path:\n\nT=22: y=2\n\nT=23: y=2 (after S action)\n\nT=24: y=3\n\nT=25: y=4\n\nT=26: y=5\n\nT=27: y=6\n\nT=28: y=7\n\nT=29: y=8\n\nT=30: y=9\n\nNow, for each, check safety:\n\nT=22, y=2: freeway 2, always safe, ok.\n\nT=23, y=2: same, ok.\n\nT=24, y=3: freeway 3, dangerous at T=22,23,28,29; T=24 not in, so safe.\n\nT=25, y=4: freeway 4, dangerous at 22,23,28,29; T=25 not, safe.\n\nT=26, y=5: freeway 5, dangerous only at 22,23; T=26 not, safe.\n\nT=27, y=6: freeway 6, dangerous only at 22,23; T=27 not, safe.\n\nT=28, y=7: freeway 7, dangerous only at 22,23; T=28 not, safe.\n\nT=29, y=8: freeway 8, dangerous only at 22,23; T=29 not, safe.\n\nT=30, y=9: no cars, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, is there a path with H=7? We saw no, because must be at y=3 at T=23, which is dangerous.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=3 at T=24, but that requires starting later.\n\nFor example, if I start at T=22 y=2, and I go to y=3 at T=24, I need to use one action to stay or something.\n\nWith H=7 actions, I must reach y=9 at T=29, which requires y_{29}=9, so y must increase each step from T=22 to T=29.\n\ny_{22}=2, y_{23}=3, ..., y_{29}=9.\n\nNo other way.\n\nHence impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 8.\n\nNow, for the actions, as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have action at turn 29: U, to go to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is reached at turn 30.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = S (since t_1=22)\n\nIn the action, for turn t, it is chosen at that turn.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, meaning action at turn t_1.\n\nIn this case, a_{22} = S\n\nThen Turn t_1 +1: a_{23} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 7: a_{29} = U\n\nSince H=8, actions from t=22 to t=29, which is t_1 to t_1 +7.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 22 + 8 -1 = 29, yes.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be listed.\n\nPerhaps I should write it clearly.\n\nBut is there another sequence?\n\nFor example, could I go up earlier to avoid the later danger, but in this case, the later danger is at T=28,29 for y=3,4, but I am not on them then.\n\nSuppose I try to go faster to higher rows.\n\nBut since I start at y=2, and rows above have danger at T=22,23, which I avoid by waiting.\n\nFor example, if I go directly: a_{22}=U, y_{23}=3, but at T=23, y=3 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\na_{22}=S, as before.\n\nI could go down to y=1 at some point, but not beneficial.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nNow, about the cars: in freeway 3 and 4, there is a second danger at T=28,29, but since I am not on those rows at that time, it's ok.\n\nIn my path, at T=28, I am on y=7, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 24 to 29, all U, but turn 23 is also U except turn 22 is S.\n\nNow, to write in box.\n\nBut the player position: start at (0,2) turn 22.\n\nAfter actions, at turn 23, position (0,2) after S.\n\nThen turn 24: (0,3), etc.\n\nReaches (0,9) at turn 30.\n\nMinimal turns H=8.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 2\\) on turn 22.\n- The goal is to reach \\(y = 9\\), requiring a net increase of 7 in the y-coordinate.\n- Due to car positions and their movements, being on \\(y = 3\\) at turn 23 would cause a collision because freeway 3 (and others) is dangerous at turns 22 and 23. A direct upward path in 7 turns (turns 22 to 28) is impossible because it requires being at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 23, which is unsafe.\n- The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8, achieved by staying at \\(y = 2\\) for one turn (to avoid the danger at turn 23) and then moving upward each subsequent turn.\n- The sequence ensures that the player is never on a freeway row when it is dangerous (i.e., when a car spans \\(x = 0\\) at that turn).\n\n### Safe Turns for Each Freeway Row:\n- \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\): Always safe (no collision possible).\n- \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\): Dangerous at turns 22, 23, 28, 29; safe otherwise.\n- \\(y = 5\\), \\(y = 6\\), \\(y = 7\\), \\(y = 8\\): Dangerous at turns 22 and 23; safe for turns \\(\\geq 24\\).\n- \\(y = 9\\): Always safe (no cars).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=22}^{29}\\) (8 actions) results in the player reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 30 without any collisions:\n- **Turn 22**: Stay (\\(S\\)) – Player remains at \\(y = 2\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 23**: Up (\\(U\\)) – Player moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 24.\n- **Turn 24**: Up (\\(U\\)) – Player moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 25 (safe, as \\(y = 3\\) is safe at turn 24).\n- **Turn 25**: Up (\\(U\\)) – Player moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 26 (safe, as \\(y = 4\\) is safe at turn 25).\n- **Turn 26**: Up (\\(U\\)) – Player moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 27 (safe, as \\(y = 5\\) is safe at turn 26).\n- **Turn 27**: Up (\\(U\\)) – Player moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 28 (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) is safe at turn 27).\n- **Turn 28**: Up (\\(U\\)) – Player moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 29 (safe, as \\(y = 7\\) is safe at turn 28).\n- **Turn 29**: Up (\\(U\\)) – Player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 30 (safe, no cars).\n\n### Verification:\n- At turn 28 and 29, \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) are dangerous, but the player is on \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) respectively, which are safe.\n- All actions are valid, and the y-coordinate changes as required within bounds.\n\nThus, the minimal \\(H = 8\\), and the action sequence is as follows.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 24, and I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 24.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t_1=24, with head and tail, direction, and speed. The collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves to a new row, they are not on that new row until the next turn. So if at turn T, they move from y to y+1, they are only on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1. Similarly for moving down.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn 24, and I need to compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head=12, tail=47, direction=left, speed=36\n\nDirection left means it's moving left, so as time increases, the span shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, direction right moves right.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail). For left-moving cars, head and tail decrease over time, for right-moving, they increase.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, both ends decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right: both increase.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, they have (head, tail) but in the span, it's [h, τ] for left, but since it's moving left, h and τ are both decreasing.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (12,47,left,36)\n\nBut head=12, tail=47? That seems odd because if it's moving left, and head is smaller than tail, but in the span, for left-moving, they say Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and then it decreases.\n\nBut if h=12 and τ=47, that would be from 12 to 47, which is to the right if we assume increasing x, but direction is left, so that might be inconsistent.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nNow, if direction is left, and it's moving left, the head should be the front, so if head is smaller, it should be that h < τ, meaning the car extends from left to right, but since it's moving left, the head (front) is at smaller x.\n\nPerhaps I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nAssume that x increases to the right.\n\nFor a left-moving car, it's moving towards decreasing x.\n\nThe head is the front, so for left-moving, head should be smaller than tail if tail is the rear, but tail might be larger if rear is to the right.\n\nIn the span, they have [h, τ], and for left-moving, it's from h to τ, with h and τ such that as time increases, both decrease.\n\nIn freeway 1: (12,47,left,36) so at t_1=24, span is [12,47], meaning from x=12 to x=47.\n\nSince direction is left, at future turn T, span is [12 - 36*(T-24), 47 - 36*(T-24)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut 12 to 47, that's a length of 35, and speed 36, which is faster than the length, so it might wrap around or something? No, the game doesn't mention wrapping, so I think the cars are on an infinite line, and collision only if 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nThe player is at x=0 always, I think, since it's a vertical move, and we're only concerned with when the player is at y=k for some k, and at that turn, if there's a car on freeway k where 0 is in its span.\n\nThe player moves vertically, so x is always 0, and we care about the row y.\n\nFor each freeway y from 1 to 8, there are cars, and at each turn, for the row the player is on, we check if 0 is in the car's span for that row.\n\nIf the player is not on a freeway, like at y=0 or y=9, no collision, but y=9 is the goal, so we need to reach (0,9).\n\ny=0 is safe, but we start from y=3 at turn 24.\n\nNow, let's list all cars at t_1=24.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=12, tail=47, dir=left, speed=36) so span at t: [12 - 36*(t-24), 47 - 36*(t-24)]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (12,47,left,36) so same span as above.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, span increases.\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,6) — head=12, tail=1? But tail=1, head=12, that seems tail smaller, but for right-moving, span should be [τ, h]? No.\n\nIn the update rule for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nLet's check the problem.\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_t1)]]\"\n\nIn the text: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor freeway 3, cars are given as (12,1,right,6), etc., but in the tuple, it's (head, tail, dir, speed), I think.\n\nLook at the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for the first car on freeway 3: head=12, tail=1, dir=right, speed=6.\n\nBut for right-moving, the span at t_1 is [τ, h]? According to the update rule.\n\nIn the update rule for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\", so for this car, τ=1, h=12, so span at t_1 is [1,12], and since dir=right, at time T, span is [1 + 6*(T-24), 12 + 6*(T-24)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-24,-35,right,6), so τ=-35, h=-24? Head and tail.\n\nτ=tail, h=head.\n\nSo for this car, tail=-35, head=-24, dir=right, so span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-35, -24], and at T, [-35 + 6*(T-24), -24 + 6*(T-24)]\n\nThird car: (54,43,right,6) — head=54, tail=43, so τ=43, h=54, dir=right, span at t_1 [43,54], at T [43 + 6*(T-24), 54 + 6*(T-24)]\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: (12,1,right,6) — only one car.\n\nFreeway 6: (12,1,right,6) — one car\n\nFreeway 7: (12,1,right,6) — one car\n\nFreeway 8: (12,1,right,6) — one car\n\nNow, freeways 1 and 2 have left-moving cars, freeways 3 to 8 have right-moving cars, mostly multiple on 3 and 4.\n\nI need to find a path from y=3 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nEach action takes one turn, and moving up or down changes y by 1 per turn, or stay keeps y.\n\nTo go from 3 to 9, I need to increase y by 6, so minimum 6 turns if I go up every turn, but I have to avoid collisions when on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=3 is a freeway, so at turn 24, I am on y=3, and I need to check if there is a collision at turn 24 for y=3.\n\nSimilarly for future turns.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and turn T, is there a car on k where 0 ∈ [low, high] for the span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to check each car on that freeway.\n\nBut for freeways with multiple cars, I need to see if any car covers x=0.\n\nNow, the player is on freeway y at turn T if at that turn, after the action, but the position is after the action.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, the player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen, they choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with clamping to [0,9].\n\nThen, at turn t, the player is on row y_t.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if at that turn, for row y_T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThe car positions are computed for turn T.\n\nWhen the player moves, at turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but for the collision at turn T, it's based on y_T, not y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, and you might move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that row at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, for turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, etc.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, so at some turn, y_t =9, and we need to be there without collision at that turn or previous.\n\nSince y=9 is not a freeway, no cars, so safe.\n\ny=0 also safe.\n\nNow, start at turn 24, y=3.\n\nFirst, I need to check if at turn 24, on freeway 3, is there a collision?\n\nFreeway 3 has three cars.\n\nAt turn T=24, for freeway 3:\n\nCar1: (12,1,right,6) → span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [1,12] since right-moving.\n\n0 is not in [1,12], since 1 to 12, x=0 not included.\n\nCar2: (-24,-35,right,6) → τ=-35, h=-24, span at t_1: [-35,-24], 0 not in this interval.\n\nCar3: (54,43,right,6) → τ=43, h=54, span [43,54], 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 24, on y=3, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for other turns, I need to see when it is safe to be on each row.\n\nBut I need to find a sequence of actions to move to y=9 quickly.\n\nSince I need to go up, from 3 to 9, I can go up as much as possible, but avoid rows when it is dangerous.\n\nI could stay or go down to avoid, but that might increase turns, so min turns might not be 6 if I have to detour or wait.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and for each turn, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nDefine t_rel = t - 24, so time relative to current.\n\nSet τ = t - 24, so at τ=0, turn 24.\n\nFor each freeway k, find for which τ, if the player is on k at relative time τ, it is unsafe.\n\nThat is, at absolute time t = 24 + τ, for freeway k, is there a car such that 0 in its span.\n\nNow, for each car, the span at time t = 24 + τ is:\n\nFor left-moving car: span = [h - s τ, tail - s τ] where τ = t - 24\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\n0 in span if low <= 0 <= high, and since the span is a closed interval, I assume.\n\nNow, let's handle each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car (h=12, tail=47, dir=left, s=36)\n\nSpan at τ: [12 - 36τ, 47 - 36τ]\n\n0 in span if 12 - 36τ <= 0 <= 47 - 36τ\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36τ <= 0 => 12 <= 36τ => τ >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 47 - 36τ => 36τ <= 47 => τ <= 47/36 ≈ 1.3056\n\nSo for τ in [1/3, 47/36], approximately [0.333, 1.3056]\n\nSince τ integer (turns discrete), τ=1 only? τ starts from 0.\n\nτ=0: 12 - 0 =12, 47-0=47, 0 not <=12? 12-0=12>0, so 0 not in [12,47]\n\nτ=1: 12-36= -24, 47-36=11, so span [-24,11], 0 is in [-24,11]? -24 <=0<=11, yes.\n\nτ=2: 12-72= -60, 47-72= -25, span [-60,-25], 0 not in, since -25<0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at τ=1.\n\nτ=1: absolute turn 24+1=25.\n\nNow freeway 2: same car as freeway 1, so same, unsafe only at τ=1, turn 25.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nCar1: (head=12, tail=1, dir=right, s=6) → since right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [1,12], so at time τ, span [1 + 6τ, 12 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 6τ <= 0 <= 12 + 6τ\n\nBut 1 + 6τ <=0? 6τ <= -1, impossible since τ>=0, 1+6τ >=1>0, so 0 not <= lower bound, so never true. Thus car1 never covers x=0.\n\nCar2: (-24,-35,right,6) → τ_tail=-35, h_head=-24? Tail=-35, head=-24.\n\nSpan at τ: [τ_tail + 6τ, head + 6τ] = [-35 + 6τ, -24 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 6τ <= 0 <= -24 + 6τ\n\nFirst: -35 + 6τ <=0 => 6τ <=35 => τ <= 35/6 ≈5.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 6τ => 24 <= 6τ => τ >=4\n\nSo τ >=4 and τ <=5.833, so τ=4,5\n\nFor τ=4: -35 +24= -11, -24+24=0, so span [-11,0], 0 is included? Since <= and >=, I assume inclusive, so 0 <=0 is true, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly τ=5: -35+30= -5, -24+30=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=6: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo car2 covers x=0 at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nCar3: (54,43,right,6) → tail=43, head=54, span at τ: [43 + 6τ, 54 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span? 43 +6τ <=0 <=54+6τ? But 43+6τ >=43>0, so 0 not <= lower bound, never true. So never covers x=0.\n\nThus for freeway 3, unsafe when car2 covers, at τ=4 and τ=5, so turns 24+4=28 and 24+5=29.\n\nAbsolute turns: τ=4 → turn 28, τ=5 → turn 29.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3, so also unsafe at τ=4 and τ=5, turns 28 and 29.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car (12,1,right,6) → head=12, tail=1, dir=right\n\nSpan at τ: [tail + 6τ, head + 6τ] = [1 + 6τ, 12 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span? 1+6τ <=0 <=12+6τ\n\n1+6τ <=0? 6τ <= -1, impossible, so never. So freeway 5 always safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same, one car (12,1,right,6), always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: (12,1,right,6), always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: (12,1,right,6), always safe.\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 each have only one car similar to car1 on freeway 3, which never covers x=0, so all always safe.\n\nNow freeway 1 and 2 are unsafe only at τ=1, turn 25.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 unsafe at τ=4 and 5, turns 28 and 29.\n\nFreeways 5-8 always safe.\n\nWe start at y=3 at τ=0.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3.\n\nAt τ=0, freeway 3 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe player can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe situations:\n\n- On freeway 1 or 2 at τ=1 (turn 25)\n\n- On freeway 3 or 4 at τ=4 or τ=5 (turns 28,29)\n\nSince we start at y=3, which is freeway 3, at τ=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up directly: U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 3 to 9 in 6 moves, so at turn 24+6=30, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check for each turn if we are on a freeway and if it is unsafe at that time.\n\nLet's simulate going up each turn.\n\nStart: turn 24, y=3, action: but at turn 24, we are at y=3, and we choose action for this turn.\n\nThe sequence starts from turn t_1=24.\n\nAt turn 24, we are at y=3, we choose a_{24}, which determines y_{25}.\n\nThen at turn 25, we are at y_{25}, and so on.\n\nIn terms of position: at turn t, position is y_t, after action a_t is applied, but y_t is before action? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, before action, position is (0, y_t)\n\nAfter choosing a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen at turn t, the position is y_t, and we check collision based on y_t and cars at turn t.\n\nSimilarly for next turn.\n\nFor the action sequence, we output a_t for t starting from t_1.\n\nNow, for direct up path:\n\nAssume actions all U from turn 24.\n\nTurn 24: at y=3, choose a_{24} = U, so y_{25} = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nBut at turn 24, we are on y=3, which is safe, as at τ=0.\n\nTurn 25: now at y=4, which is freeway 4.\n\nTime τ=1 (since t=25, τ=1)\n\nAt τ=1, freeway 4: is it unsafe? Freeway 4 unsafe at τ=4 and 5, not τ=1. τ=1 is turn 25, freeway 4 at τ=1.\n\nFor freeway 4, unsafe only at τ=4,5, so at τ=1, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 and 2 unsafe at τ=1, but we are on y=4, not y=1 or 2.\n\nSo turn 25, y=4, safe.\n\nNow action a_{25} = U, so y_{26} = 5\n\nTurn 26: y=5, which is freeway 5, always safe. Action U, y_{27}=6\n\nTurn 27: y=6, freeway 6, safe. Action U, y_{28}=7\n\nTurn 28: y=7, freeway 7, safe. But time τ= t-24, t=28, τ=4\n\nAt τ=4, freeway 7 is always safe, since no issue.\n\nAction U, y_{29}=8\n\nTurn 29: y=8, freeway 8, safe. Action U, y_{30}=9\n\nTurn 30: y=9, which is not a freeway, so safe, and we reached.\n\nBut at turn 28 and 29, we were on y=7 and y=8, which are safe.\n\nIn the path, at τ=4, turn 28, we are on y=7, which is freeway 7, always safe.\n\nSimilarly τ=5, turn 29, y=8, safe.\n\nBut freeway 3 and 4 are unsafe at τ=4 and 5, but we are not on them at that time.\n\nIn this path, we were on y=3 at τ=0, y=4 at τ=1, both safe for those rows at those times.\n\ny=5 at τ=2, safe; y=6 at τ=3, safe; y=7 at τ=4, safe; y=8 at τ=5, safe; y=9 at τ=6.\n\nτ=4 is turn 28, y=7; τ=5 turn 29, y=8; both safe.\n\nSo we reached in 6 turns: turns 24 to 29, actions U each time, to go from y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps.\n\nBut at turn 30, y=9, but we reach at turn when y_t=9.\n\nStart turn 24, y=3.\n\nAfter 1 U: turn 25, y=4\n\nAfter 2 U: turn 26, y=5\n\nAfter 3 U: turn 27, y=6\n\nAfter 4 U: turn 28, y=7\n\nAfter 5 U: turn 29, y=8\n\nAfter 6 U: turn 30, y=9\n\nYes, at turn 30, y=9.\n\nAnd all positions during turns 24 to 29 are safe as above.\n\nBut at turn 28, τ=4, freeway 7 is safe, similarly turn 29, freeway 8 safe.\n\nNow, is there a problem with freeway 3 or 4 at τ=4 and 5? But we are not on them.\n\nIn this path, we didn't encounter any unsafe situation.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 4 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, turn 25, we were on y=4.\n\nFreeway 4: at τ=1, cars: car1: [1+6*1, 12+6*1] = [7,18], no 0\n\nCar2: [-35+6*1, -24+6*1] = [-29,-18], no 0\n\nCar3: [43+6,54+6]=[49,60], no 0\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 1 and 2 unsafe at τ=1, but we were not on them.\n\nSo this path seems safe and takes 6 turns.\n\nBut the player starts at y=3 at turn 24, and after 6 actions, at turn 30, y=9.\n\nH=6 turns? From t=24 to t=29, that's 6 actions: actions at t=24,25,26,27,28,29 to reach y=9 at t=30.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, with y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nHere t_1=24, H=6, so actions from t=24 to 24+5=29, and y_{29} =? Let's see:\n\nAfter action at t=24: y_{25} =4\n\nt=25: y_{26} =5\n\n...\n\nt=28: action U, y_{29} =8? No.\n\nAt turn t, after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nPosition at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t=24, y=3\n\nAfter a_{24}=U, y_{25}=4\n\nAt turn t=25, position y=4\n\nAfter a_{25}=U, y_{26}=5\n\n...\n\nAt turn t=28, position y=7 (since after t=27 action, y_{28}=7? Let's index.\n\nSet t=24: position y_t = y_{24} =3\n\nChoose a_{24}, then y_{25} = y_{24} + Δy_{24}\n\nThen at t=25, position y_{25}, choose a_{25}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn t=24+k.\n\nTo reach y=9, since start from y=3, need to increase by 6, so after 6 up actions, at turn t=24+6=30, y_{30}=9.\n\nAt turn t=30, position is y=9, which is the goal.\n\nThe last action is at t=29, which sets y_{30}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=24 to t=29 inclusive, that's 6 actions.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{24 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 24 + H -1 =30, so 23 + H =30, H=7? No.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =24 + H -1\n\nSet equal to the turn when y=9, which is turn 30.\n\nSo 24 + H -1 =30, so 23 + H =30, H=7.\n\nI think I confused.\n\ny_{t} is position at turn t.\n\nAfter actions, at turn t=30, y=9.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t to set the next position.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, position at turn t_1 + H is 9? Let's see.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\nAfter first action at t_1, position at turn t_1 +1 is set.\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn t_1 + k.\n\nTo have position at some turn T be 9, with T = t_1 + k.\n\nThen k is the number of actions.\n\nIn the output, the sequence has H actions, from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's read.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at time t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, that is actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen after these H actions, the position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H should be 9? No.\n\nAfter action at time s, it sets y_{s+1}.\n\nSo after action at s, position at s+1 is set.\n\nSo for action at t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, these actions set positions at times (t_1 + t) +1 for each t.\n\nThe positions are set at t_1 +1 to t_1 + H.\n\nSpecifically, after action at t_1, y_{t_1 +1} set.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H} set.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd at turn t_1, position y_{t_1} is given, but we don't control it with action at t_1? At turn t_1, we are at y_{t_1}, and we choose action a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, we are at y_{t_1 +1}, choose a_{t_1 +1}, sets y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, up to after a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set to 9.\n\nThe last position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, start at turn t_1=24, y=3.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 24 + H, y=9.\n\nSince we start from y=3, to reach y=9, we need to increase by 6, so min H=6, with all U actions.\n\nThen at turn 24 + H = 24 + 6 = 30, y=9.\n\nThe actions are at turns 24,25,26,27,28,29, each U.\n\nIn the sequence: for t from 0 to 5 (since H=6, t=0 to H-1=5), actions at t_1 + t = 24 + t for t=0 to 5.\n\nIn the output, it should be Turn 24: a_{24}, Turn 25: a_{25}, ..., Turn 29: a_{29}, all U.\n\nAnd we need to confirm that at each turn from 24 to 29, the position is safe.\n\nAt turn 24: y=3, τ=0, freeway 3 safe as before.\n\nTurn 25: y=4, τ=1, freeway 4: at τ=1, as above, cars: [1+6,12+6]=[7,18], [-35+6,-24+6]=[-29,-18], [43+6,54+6]=[49,60], all not cover 0, safe.\n\nTurn 26: y=5, τ=2, freeway 5: car [1+12,12+12]=[13,24]? At τ=2, [1+6*2,12+6*2]=[13,24], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly turn 27: y=6, τ=3, freeway 6, similar, safe.\n\nTurn 28: y=7, τ=4, freeway 7: car [1+6*4,12+6*4]=[1+24,12+24]=[25,36], no 0, safe.\n\nTurn 29: y=8, τ=5, freeway 8: [1+30,12+30]=[31,42], no 0, safe.\n\nThen at turn 30, y=9, safe.\n\nSo all good, H=6.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer turns? From y=3 to y=9, min 6 steps up, so no, 6 is minimum.\n\nUnless we can go up faster, but no, only +1 per up.\n\nOr if we go down and then up, but that would take more turns, so 6 is min.\n\nIn this case, it works.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 3 at τ=4 and 5 unsafe, but in this path, at τ=4, we are on y=7, not y=3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for other paths, but this seems fine.\n\nThe problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1 and 2, they are unsafe at τ=1, but we are not on them.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, span [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11], which includes 0, so if on y=1 or 2 at τ=1, unsafe, but we are on y=4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the answer should be all U actions.\n\nBut let's see the output format.\n\nIt should be:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nBut in the sequence, from t=24 to 29, 6 actions.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there a time when we must not be on certain rows.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, if we were on y=1 or 2, it would be unsafe, but we are going up from y=3.\n\nWe could consider staying or something, but no need.\n\nSuppose at turn 24, we stay, y=3, then next turn go up, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at turn 24, then at turn 25, still y=3, but τ=1, freeway 3 at τ=1.\n\nIs freeway 3 unsafe at τ=1? Earlier, at τ=1, for freeway 3.\n\nτ=1, turn 25.\n\nFreeway 3 cars:\n\nCar1: [1+6*1,12+6*1]=[7,18], no\n\nCar2: [-35+6,-24+6]=[-29,-18], no\n\nCar3: [43+6,54+6]=[49,60], no\n\nSo at τ=1, freeway 3 safe.\n\nSimilarly, only unsafe at τ=4,5.\n\nSo even if we stay at y=3, it is safe at τ=1, but going up is faster.\n\nNo benefit to stay.\n\nSimilarly, other actions not needed.\n\nSo min H=6 with all U.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 3 and 4, there are cars that cover at τ=4,5, but we avoid by being higher.\n\nPerhaps if we go slower, we might hit, but here no.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me check if at some point we need to go down to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the player can be at y=0 or y=9, safe.\n\nBut here not needed.\n\nSo the minimal sequence is six U actions.\n\nBut in the output, we need to write the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=6.\n\nBut let me see if we can do in less than 6.\n\nFor example, if we start at y=3, after one action, y=4, etc., min to increase by 6 is 6 actions.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but no.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence is all U from turn 24 to 29.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7,8, only one car each, which never covers 0, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut just to be complete, for freeway 4 at τ=4.\n\nτ=4, turn 28.\n\nFreeway 4 car2: [-35 + 6*4, -24 + 6*4] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], and 0 is included, so if on y=4 at turn 28, collision.\n\nSimilarly at turn 29, τ=5, [-35+30, -24+30]=[-5,6], 0 in.\n\nBut in our path, at turn 28, we are on y=7, not y=4.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nI think no issue.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 24\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Unsafe Conditions\n- **Freeways 1 and 2**: Unsafe only at relative time \\(\\tau = 1\\) (absolute turn 25) due to a car spanning \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Freeways 3 and 4**: Unsafe at relative times \\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 5\\) (absolute turns 28 and 29) due to a car spanning \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Freeways 5, 6, 7, and 8**: Always safe, as no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at any time.\n\nThe player must avoid being on freeways 1 or 2 at turn 25, and on freeways 3 or 4 at turns 28 and 29.\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y = 9\\) Minimally\n- Starting from \\(y = 3\\) at turn 24, the minimal path to \\(y = 9\\) requires increasing \\(y\\) by 6, which takes exactly 6 turns with all \"U\" (up) actions.\n- The sequence of positions and turns:\n  - Turn 24: Position \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe at \\(\\tau = 0\\)).\n  - Action \\(a_{24} = U\\) → \\(y_{25} = 4\\).\n  - Turn 25: Position \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe at \\(\\tau = 1\\) as unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 4, 5\\)).\n  - Action \\(a_{25} = U\\) → \\(y_{26} = 5\\).\n  - Turn 26: Position \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, always safe).\n  - Action \\(a_{26} = U\\) → \\(y_{27} = 6\\).\n  - Turn 27: Position \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, always safe).\n  - Action \\(a_{27} = U\\) → \\(y_{28} = 7\\).\n  - Turn 28: Position \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, always safe; unsafe for freeway 3/4 but not on them).\n  - Action \\(a_{28} = U\\) → \\(y_{29} = 8\\).\n  - Turn 29: Position \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, always safe; unsafe for freeway 3/4 but not on them).\n  - Action \\(a_{29} = U\\) → \\(y_{30} = 9\\) (goal reached at turn 30).\n\nThis path achieves the goal in \\(H = 6\\) turns without any collisions. Since \\(y\\) must increase by 6 and each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, \\(H = 6\\) is minimal.\n\n### Output Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns 24 to 29 (6 actions) is all \"U\".\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,5) at turn t1=26 to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where a car is present at x=0. Specifically, for a car on freeway k, at turn T, its span includes x=0. The player is on freeway y_t at turn t, so for collision at turn T, we need y_T = k for some freeway with a car at x=0 at that turn.\n\nImportant point: when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T they are still on y_T, and at turn T+1 they are on y_{T+1}. So for collision, we care about the y-position at each turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=26, and for future turns, we calculate based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions at t1=26.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head h=-60, tail τ=-25, direction left, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, the span is [h, τ] = [-60, -25]. Direction left means it's moving left, so decreasing x.\n\nThe span update: for left-moving, at time T, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nHead and tail: for left-moving, head is at more negative x? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nHere h=-60, τ=-25, so at t1, the car is from x=-60 to x=-25. Since left-moving, it's moving to decreasing x, so at time T, position is [ -60 - 36*(T-26), -25 - 36*(T-26) ]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], which might be confusing.\n\nLook: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then \"Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 3, it has (24,13,right,6), so τ=24? But 24>13, so [τ,h] = [24,13]? That would be decreasing, but right-moving should be increasing.\n\nI think there's a inconsistency in notation.\n\nFor freeway 3: cars listed as (24,13,right,6), etc.\n\nBut for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] and then [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIf τ=24, h=13, then [τ,h] = [24,13], which is from 24 to 13, which is leftward, but direction is right. That doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps I misread.\n\nLook back at the car update rules:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says [h, τ] with h and τ, but in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nSo head h=-60, tail τ=-25.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h, τ] = [-60, -25], so from x=-60 to x=-25, and since left-moving, it moves left, so at T, [ -60 -36(T-26), -25 -36(T-26) ]\n\nNow for right-moving, example freeway 3: (24,13,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nBut here, τ=24, h=13, so [τ,h] = [24,13], which is from 24 to 13, which is decreasing x, but direction is right, so it should be increasing.\n\nThat can't be right. Probably a typo or misnaming.\n\nI think \"head\" and \"tail\" are relative to direction.\n\nIn the text: for left-moving, \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" and span [h, τ]\n\nFor right-moving, it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\"? No, in the update rule it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, head h is the front when moving left, so at left end, and tail τ at right end? In [h, τ], with h=-60, τ=-25, h<τ since -60<-25, so [h,τ] is from smaller to larger x? No, x from left to right, so smaller x is left.\n\nAssume x-axis, left is negative, right is positive.\n\nFor left-moving car on freeway 1: at t1, span [h, τ] = [-60, -25], so it occupies x from -60 to -25. Since moving left, at time T, it moves to more negative x.\n\nFor right-moving, on freeway 3: (24,13,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [24,13]? But 24>13, so [24,13] would be from 24 to 13, which is from right to left, decreasing x.\n\nBut direction is right, so it should be moving to increasing x.\n\nPerhaps for right-moving, τ is the tail and h is the head, but in the span [τ, h], with τ=24, h=13, τ>h, so [τ,h] = [24,13] is from 24 to 13, which is leftward, but moving right, so at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [24 +6(T-26), 13 +6(T-26)]\n\nSince 24>13, at T, the left end is min and right end max.\n\nAt t1, [24,13] means the car is from x=13 to x=24? But [24,13] with 24>13, it's not a standard interval.\n\nI think it's a mistake in the notation. Probably, the span is always given with the left endpoint and right endpoint, but for right-moving, the head is on the right.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's think of the position.\n\nFor a car, at t1, we have head and tail positions.\n\nFor left-moving, head is at smaller x, tail at larger x.\n\nFor right-moving, head is at larger x, tail at smaller x.\n\nThen for both, the span is from min to max x.\n\nBut in the update, for left-moving, as x decreases, both head and tail decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, both increase.\n\nIn the span notation, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h < τ, and it decreases.\n\nFor right-moving, if head is at larger x, tail at smaller, but in the given, for freeway 3, (24,13,right,6), so head=24, tail=13, so head > tail, so the car is from tail to head, from 13 to 24.\n\nThen for right-moving, span(t1) = [tail, head] = [13,24], and at T, [tail + s(T-t1), head + s(T-t1)] = [13 +6(T-26), 24 +6(T-26)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, freeway 1: head=-60, tail=-25, head < tail, so span [head, tail] = [-60,-25], at T, [head - s(T-t1), tail - s(T-t1)] = [-60 -36(T-26), -25 -36(T-26)]\n\nIn the text, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and τ is tail, h is head, so for freeway 3, τ=13? No, in the car state it's listed as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for freeway 3, (24,13,right,6), so head=24, tail=13.\n\nThen for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [13,24], yes, from tail to head.\n\nThen at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [13 +6(T-26), 24 +6(T-26)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, freeway 1: head=-60, tail=-25, span [h,τ] = [-60,-25], at T [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-60-36(T-26), -25-36(T-26)]\n\nOk, that makes sense.\n\nNow for freeway 3, there are three cars: (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFor each, we need to find when they occupy x=0.\n\nBut collision is when at turn T, for the freeway y_T, if there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=5 at t1=26.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, so once at y=9, no collision possible. But we need to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe position is (0,y), so x=0 always, y changes.\n\nThe goal is to have y=9 at some turn, say at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=0 to H-1, so after H turns, position at turn t1 + H.\n\nLet's see the sequence: actions from t=0 to H-1, so for t from t1 to t1 + H -1, actions applied, so position after H actions is at turn t1 + H.\n\nStart at turn t1, position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,5)\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd we need to reach exactly (0,9), so at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can achieve this without collision during the path, from turn t1 to t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nCollision can occur at each turn from t1 to t1 + H -1, I think, but at turn t1, we are at y=5, and we need to check if there is collision at t1.\n\nAt turn t, the player is on freeway y_t, and we need that for no car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nAt turn t1, we are given the state, so we need to check if at t1, on y=5, is there a car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly for each subsequent turn until we reach y=9.\n\nAt the turn when we reach y=9, since y=9 has no cars, no collision.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at some turn, and the actions are taken from turn t1 to t1 + H -1, resulting in position at turn t1 + H being (0,9).\n\nNow, during turns t1 to t1 + H -1, we are at various y positions, and we must avoid collision at each of those turns.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway at t1=26.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, h=-60, τ=-25, s=36\n\nAt time T, span: [ -60 -36(T-26), -25 -36(T-26) ]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval, so -60 -36(T-26) <= 0 <= -25 -36(T-26)\n\nSince the car is moving left, and at t1, it's at negative x, so it will pass x=0 at some point.\n\nSet -60 -36(T-26) <= 0 <= -25 -36(T-26)\n\nFirst inequality: -60 -36(T-26) <= 0 => -36(T-26) <= 60 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36(T-26) >= -60, but 36(T-26) is positive for T>26, so always true for T>26? Let's see.\n\n-60 -36(T-26) <= 0 => -36(T-26) <= 60\n\nDivide by -36, reverse inequality: T-26 >= -60/36 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666\n\nSince T-26 >=0 for T>=26, this is always true for T>=26.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -25 -36(T-26) => 25 +36(T-26) <=0 => 36(T-26) <= -25 => T-26 <= -25/36 ≈ -0.694, so T <= 26 - 0.694 = 25.306, so T <=25 since T integer.\n\nBut T >= t1=26, so for T>=26, 0 <= -25 -36(T-26) is false because right side is negative and decreasing.\n\n0 <= -25 -36(T-26)\n\nLeft is 0, right is -25 -36(T-26), which for T=26 is -25 <0, and decreases, so 0 <= negative number is false for all T.\n\nSo the inequality 0 <= -25 -36(T-26) is never true for any T, since right side is always negative for T>=26.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 1, at no time T>=26 is 0 in the span, because the car is entirely left of 0 and moving left, so it never reaches x=0.\n\nAt t1, span [-60,-25], both negative, so x=0 not in [-60,-25], and as it moves left, x decreases, so always negative, never reaches 0.\n\nSo no collision possible on freeway 1 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-60,-25,left,36), so identical, no collision possible.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,6) but as we said, head=24, tail=13, so span at t1 [13,24] since right-moving.\n\nDirection right, so span [τ, h] = [13,24]? τ=tail=13, h=head=24, so [13,24].\n\nAt T, [13 +6(T-26), 24 +6(T-26)]\n\nCollision if 0 in [13 +6(T-26), 24 +6(T-26)]\n\nBut 13 +6(T-26) >=13 >0 for T>=26, so the left end is at least 13>0, so 0 not in interval, since interval is positive.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nHead=-12, tail=-23? tail=-23, head=-12, so tail < head, span [tail, head] = [-23,-12] for right-moving? Direction right, so tail is left, head is right.\n\nIn notation, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-23,-12]? τ=tail=-23, h=head=-12, so [τ,h] = [-23,-12], which is from -23 to -12.\n\nAt T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-23 +6(T-26), -12 +6(T-26)]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-23 +6(T-26), -12 +6(T-26)]\n\nSet -23 +6(T-26) <= 0 <= -12 +6(T-26)\n\nFirst: -23 +6(T-26) <= 0 => 6(T-26) <= 23 => T-26 <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so T <= 26 + 3.833 = 29.833, so T<=29\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +6(T-26) => 12 <= 6(T-26) => 2 <= T-26 => T >= 28\n\nSo for T=28,29\n\nAt T=28: left end -23 +6(2) = -23+12= -11, right end -12+12=0\n\n0 <=0 is true, so at T=28, span [-11,0], so 0 is included? x=0 is at the right end.\n\nCollision if 0 in span, and since it's a closed interval, I assume, so yes, 0 is included when the right end is 0.\n\nSimilarly at T=29: left end -23 +6(3)= -23+18= -5, right end -12+18=6, so [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nFor T=30: left -23+24=1, right -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for this car, collision at T=28 and T=29.\n\nThird car on freeway 3: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nHead=-48, tail=-59? tail=-59, head=-48, so tail < head, span [τ,h] = [-59,-48]\n\nAt T, [-59 +6(T-26), -48 +6(T-26)]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-59 +6(T-26), -48 +6(T-26)]\n\n-59 +6(T-26) <= 0 <= -48 +6(T-26)\n\nFirst: -59 +6(T-26) <=0 => 6(T-26) <=59 => T-26 <=59/6≈9.833, T<=35.833, T<=35\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +6(T-26) => 48 <=6(T-26) => 8 <= T-26 => T>=34\n\nSo T=34,35\n\nAt T=34: left -59 +6(8)= -59+48= -11, right -48+48=0, so [-11,0], includes 0\n\nT=35: left -59+54= -5, right -48+54=6, [-5,6], includes 0\n\nT=36: left -59+60=1, right -48+60=12, [1,12], no 0.\n\nSo for freeway 3, cars cause collision at:\n\nFirst car: no collision, always positive\n\nSecond car: T=28,29\n\nThird car: T=34,35\n\nBut freeway 3 has multiple cars, so collision if any car has 0 in span at that turn.\n\nSo for freeway 3, collision at T=28,29,34,35.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3? \" (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6) \" identical to freeway 3.\n\nSo same collision times: T=28,29 for second car, T=34,35 for third car.\n\nNow freeway 5: only one car, \"(24,13,right,6)\" so head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at t1, moving right, so at T, [13+6(T-26), 24+6(T-26)], always >=13>0, so no collision at any T.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same, one car (24,13,right,6), no collision.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (24,13,right,6), no collision.\n\nFreeway 8: same, (24,13,right,6), no collision.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 have no collision.\n\nSo summary of dangerous freeways and times:\n\n- Freeway 3: collision at T=28,29,34,35\n\n- Freeway 4: collision at T=28,29,34,35\n\n- Other freeways: no collision at any time.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t1=26, y=5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe y-position changes by -1,0,+1 each turn.\n\nMinimal number of turns to go from y=5 to y=9 is 4 turns up, so H=4, but we need to avoid the collision times on the path.\n\nWith actions, from y=5, after one U, y=6; after two U, y=7; three U, y=8; four U, y=9. So in 4 turns, we can be at y=9 at turn 26+4=30.\n\nBut we need to check for collision during turns 26 to 29? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nStart at turn 26: y=5\n\nAfter action a_26, at turn 27, y_27 = y_26 + Δy_26\n\nSimilarly, after a_27, at turn 28, y_28, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 26 + H, y=9.\n\nWe need to avoid collision at each turn from 26 to 26 + H - 1? No.\n\nAt turn T, for T from 26 to 26 + H - 1, we are at position y_T, and we must not collide at that turn.\n\nAt turn 26 + H, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nFor example, with H=4, we want to be at y=9 at turn 30.\n\nDuring turns 26,27,28,29 we are at some y, and must avoid collision.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Turn 26: at y=5, which is freeway 5. Freeway 5 has no collision, safe.\n\n- Turn 27: if we go up, y=6; freeway 6, no collision, safe.\n\n- Turn 28: if up, y=7; freeway 7, no collision, safe.\n\n- Turn 29: if up, y=8; freeway 8, no collision, safe.\n\nThen turn 30: y=9, safe.\n\nIn this path, we never go to freeway 3 or 4, which have collisions at certain times.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are all safe at all times, as per above.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 have no collisions, so at any turn, on these freeways, no collision.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 have collisions only at specific times, but we are not on them.\n\nSo with four up actions, we can reach y=9 at turn 30, and no collision.\n\nBut is that minimal? H=4 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nActions from t=26 to t=29.\n\na_26: U, to y=6 at turn 27\n\na_27: U, to y=7 at turn 28\n\na_28: U, to y=8 at turn 29\n\na_29: U, to y=9 at turn 30\n\nAt each turn:\n\nTurn 26: at y=5, freeway 5, no car at x=0, safe.\n\nTurn 27: at y=6, freeway 6, no collision, safe.\n\nTurn 28: at y=7, freeway 7, no collision, safe.\n\nTurn 29: at y=8, freeway 8, no collision, safe.\n\nTurn 30: at y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nAnd we avoid freeways 3 and 4 entirely.\n\nBut freeway 3 and 4 have collisions at T=28,29,34,35, but at T=28 and 29, we are on y=7 and y=8, not on y=3 or 4, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other times not relevant.\n\nSo H=4 seems possible.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at turn 30.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? From y=5 to y=9, minimum 4 steps up, since each step changes by at most 1, so H=4 is minimal.\n\nWe could go faster? But actions only U,D,S, so maximum one step per turn, so yes, min H=4.\n\nBut what about staying or down? That would take more turns, so worse.\n\nSo H=4 should be achievable and minimal.\n\nBut let's double-check if at turn 26, on y=5, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 5 has car (24,13,right,6), at t1=26, span [13,24], x=0 not in, and since moving right, always x>=13>0, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the sequence, all safe.\n\nBut the car state for freeway 5 has one car, but at turn 28, for example, on freeway 7, car (24,13,right,6), at T=28, span [13 +6(28-26), 24+6(2)] = [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], not at 0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut freeway 3 and 4 have collisions, but we don't go there.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if we stay or something, but no need.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,5), and we move up directly.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut let's see the collision note: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd for the move, when we move to new y, at turn T, we are on y_T, and after action, at turn T+1 on y_{T+1}.\n\nIn this case, all fine.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot go up directly? For example, if at some turn, the freeway we are on has collision, but in this case, at turn 26, y=5 safe; turn 27 y=6 safe; etc.\n\nPerhaps at turn 28 and 29, freeway 3 and 4 have collision, but we are not on them.\n\nAnother thing: the player must avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nBut in this path, we are on safe freeways.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 faster? But no, because we need to change y from 5 to 9, 4 steps.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no, only +1,-1,0 per turn.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt1=26\n\nAfter action a_26 at turn 26, position at turn 27.\n\nWe need position at some turn to be (0,9).\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 26 + H.\n\nSet y_{26 + H} =9.\n\nStart y_26=5.\n\nWith U each time, after 4 U, y_{30} =5+4=9.\n\nYes.\n\nActions: a_{26} to a_{29}, each U.\n\nThen at turn 30, y=9.\n\nNow, the sequence should be for turns t1 to t1 + H -1, so from t=26 to t=29, 4 actions.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo Turn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nBut at turn 29, we are at y=8, and after U, at turn 30 y=9.\n\nNow, is there any issue with cars? For example, at turn 28, we are at y=7, which is freeway 7, car at [13+6(28-26),24+6(2)]=[25,36] not 0.\n\nSimilarly turn 29, y=8, freeway 8, car [13+6(3),24+6(3)]=[13+18,24+18]=[31,42] not 0.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut what about freeway 3 and 4 at T=28 and 29? But we are not on them, so no collision.\n\nPerhaps if we go down or stay, it takes more turns, so not minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we try to go through other paths, but since we can go directly up without problem, no need.\n\nBut is there a constraint that we must be on freeway when moving? No, the freeways are from y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nIn this case, y=5 to y=8 are freeways but safe.\n\ny=9 is not freeway, safe.\n\nSo I think H=4 is fine.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and we do at turn 30.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 3 and 4 at T=34,35, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the actions.\n\nBut the player starts at turn t1=26, position (0,5), and we take actions from there.\n\nPerhaps we need to specify the sequence.\n\nBut I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 26, on y=5, is there car? Freeway 5 has car, but at x=13 to 24, not 0, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: the car update, for freeway 5, only one car, but for freeway 3 and 4, multiple cars, but we don't care.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster? From y=5 to y=9, delta y=4, so min 4 turns, cannot be less.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nThus the sequence: all U for 4 turns.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nAnswer:\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and t_1=26.\n\nAlso, for the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, but in terms of turn, it's t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere H=4, so turns 26,27,28,29.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we need to include the position or something, but I think just actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it says the sequence of actions.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the box, only sequence, I think.\n\nThe answer format shows the actions.\n\nPerhaps H is implied.\n\nBut in the box, we put the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if there is any mistake.\n\nAnother point: at turn 28 and 29, freeway 3 and 4 have collision, but if we were on them, but we are not.\n\nSuppose we go down to y=4 or something, but that would take more turns, and y=4 is freeway 4, which has collision at T=28,29,34,35.\n\nFor example, at turn 28, if on y=4, collision, but we are on y=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at some point to avoid, but no need.\n\nI think H=4 is achievable.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions quickly.\n\nAt turn 28:\n\nFor freeway 4, second car: at T=28, span [-23 +6(28-26), -12 +6(2)] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], so x=0 is included, collision if on freeway 4.\n\nBut we are on freeway 7, not 4.\n\nSimilarly, third car at T=34,35, not now.\n\nFreeway 3 same.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=4, sequence U,U,U,U.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\n}\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so yes.\n\nSince t1=26, we can write Turn 26: U, etc.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 26\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The minimal number of turns to move from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 4, as each action changes the y-coordinate by at most 1 (via U, D, or S actions).\n- Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) and a car on that freeway occupies \\(x = 0\\) at turn \\(T\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) have no cars that occupy \\(x = 0\\) at any turn \\(T \\geq 26\\), so they are safe at all times.\n- Freeways \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) have collisions at turns \\(T = 28, 29, 34, 35\\), but the path avoids these freeways.\n- A sequence of four U actions moves the player directly from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in 4 turns:\n  - At turn 26: Player at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe).\n  - Action U: At turn 27, \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe).\n  - Action U: At turn 28, \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe; freeways 3 and 4 have collisions but player is not on them).\n  - Action U: At turn 29, \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, safe; freeways 3 and 4 have collisions but player is not on them).\n  - Action U: At turn 30, \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway, safe and goal reached).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 4\\) turns with no collisions.\n\n### Sequence of Actions\nThe actions are applied from turn \\(t_1 = 26\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 29\\), resulting in position (0, 9) at turn 30.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 6) at turn t_1 = 27. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, moving only vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay). The vertical position y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nThe player moves on the y-axis, and there are cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision occurs if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car that spans x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nThe car positions update over time. For left-moving cars, the span moves left at speed s, so for turn T, the head and tail decrease by s*(T - t_1). Similarly, for right-moving cars, head and tail increase by s*(T - t_1).\n\nt_1 is given as 27, which is the current turn. So for any future turn T, the time elapsed is (T - 27) turns.\n\nThe player's position at turn T is y_T, and collision happens if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car whose span includes x=0.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1}, they are only on y_T at turn T, and on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So if they move at turn T, they leave y_T and enter y_{T+1} at turn T+1. But for collision, it's checked at the turn when they are on that row.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, you are on y_T, and you take an action that changes y to y_{T+1} for the next turn. So during turn T, you are on row y_T, and collision is checked against cars on that row at turn T. Then at turn T+1, you are on row y_{T+1}, and collision is checked against cars on that row at turn T+1.\n\nIf you stay (S), you remain on the same row for both turns, so collision is checked at that row for each turn separately.\n\nThe goal is to go from y=6 to y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and there are no cars above y=8 (freeways are y=1 to 8), once at y=9, it should be safe, as long as we reach it.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, so it's safe.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=6, and needs to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns would be at least 3, since from 6 to 9 is +3, so three U actions in a row. But we need to avoid collisions with cars on rows 1-8 during the path.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car positions at turn t_1=27.\n\nFor each freeway, we have cars listed.\n\nFreeway k means row y=k.\n\nFor row 1: one car: head 48, tail 83, left direction, speed 36.\n\nSince it's left-moving, and head is 48, tail is 83? That seems odd because if it's moving left, head should be on the right, but typically for left-moving, head is left, but here head=48, tail=83, and left direction? Let me read.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] then at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the table, for row 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nIf it's left-moving, and [h, τ] = [48, 83], but 48 < 83, so if it's moving left, the head should be decreasing, so at time t_1, the car is from x=48 to x=83? But that would be moving right if head is higher, I think I'm confused.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nIt says: for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd for right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor row 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nBut for left-moving, it says span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48, 83], so the car occupies from x=48 to x=83 at t_1.\n\nSince it's moving left, at future T, it will be at [48 - s(T-t_1), 83 - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], so for example, row 3 has (30,19,right,6), so τ=19, h=30? Let's see.\n\nIn the table, for row 3: (30,19,right,6), so head=30, tail=19, direction=right.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [19, 30], so from x=19 to x=30 at t_1, and at T, [19 + s(T-t_1), 30 + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head and tail: for row 1, head=48, tail=83, left, so span [48,83], moving left.\n\nBut typically, head might be the front, so for left-moving, front is smaller x, but here head=48, tail=83, so if moving left, head should be left, so x=48 is left end, x=83 is right end? But the span is [48,83], which is from low to high, so left end is 48, right end is 83, moving left means decreasing both.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, like row 3, head=30, tail=19, but for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [19,30], so from 19 to 30, with head at 30, so moving right, head increases.\n\nOkay, consistent.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, for the row y_T, there is a car on that row such that 0 is in its span at that turn. That is, the car covers x=0 at time T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I assume, as position is (0, y_t).\n\nSo we need that for each turn, when the player is on a row between 1 and 8, no car on that row has span including 0 at that turn.\n\nNow, we start at turn t_1=27, y=6.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their positions over time.\n\nSince we care about when they cover x=0.\n\nFor each car, we can find when it covers x=0.\n\nBut for a given row, multiple cars, so we need the times when x=0 is covered on that row.\n\nSince the player moves row by row, we can think per row when it is safe to be there.\n\nLet t = 0 be relative to t_1, so at time τ = 0, it's turn 27.\n\nThen for future turn T, τ = T - 27.\n\nSo at time τ, turn is 27 + τ.\n\nPlayer position at time τ is y_τ.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some time H, so after H steps, at time τ=H, y_H =9.\n\nBut since we start at τ=0, after H actions, we are at time τ=H, position after H actions.\n\nLet’s define: at time τ (offset from t_1), after τ actions, we have position y_τ.\n\nAt τ=0, initial position, no action yet.\n\nThen action a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so after t actions, at time t, position y_t.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nPosition at turn t_1 + t after t actions.\n\nFor simplicity, let τ be the time offset, so at τ, turn is 27 + τ.\n\nPosition y_τ at time τ.\n\ny_τ depends on actions from τ=0 to τ-1.\n\nAction at time τ affects y_{τ+1}.\n\nFrom the dynamics: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut position at time t is y_t, before action a_t is taken? I need to clarify the timing.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, action a_t is taken, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} is the position for the next turn.\n\nBut for collision, it says \"at turn T\", and y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, position is y_T, and collision is checked based on y_T and the cars on that row at turn T.\n\nThen action a_T is taken, which may change y to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1, we take action a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nBut at turn t_1, position is given as (0,6), so before any action, at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =6.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} should be 9.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can reach y=9 in H turns.\n\nSince from 6 to 9, we need to increase y by 3, so H >=3.\n\nBut we may need to wait or move down to avoid collisions, so H could be more.\n\nNow, let's list for each row, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nFirst, for each car, find when it covers x=0.\n\nLet τ = T - 27, so at τ=0, it's now.\n\nFor row 1: one car: left-moving, h=48, τ=83? tail is τ, but in notation, it's tail, but I'll use \"tail\" for the end.\n\nCar on row 1: head=48, tail=83, left, s=36.\n\nSpan at time σ (relative time) is [48 - 36σ, 83 - 36σ]\n\nCover x=0 when 0 is in [48 - 36σ, 83 - 36σ]\n\nSo 48 - 36σ <= 0 <= 83 - 36σ\n\nSince 48 - 36σ <= 0 implies σ >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nAnd 0 <= 83 - 36σ implies 36σ <= 83, σ <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo for σ in [4/3, 83/36] ≈ [1.333, 2.305]\n\nSince σ is integer? Turns are discrete, so τ must be integer, as time increases by 1 per turn.\n\nτ is the time offset, integer.\n\nSo σ must be integer for turns.\n\nAt τ=1: 48 - 36*1 = 12, 83 - 36*1 = 47, so [12,47], 0 not in, since 0<12.\n\nAt τ=2: 48 - 72 = -24, 83 - 72 = 11, so [-24,11], which includes 0.\n\nAt τ=3: 48 - 108 = -60, 83 - 108 = -25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at τ=2, unsafe for row 1.\n\nτ=2 corresponds to turn 27+2=29.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: same as row 1? (48,83,left,36) identical to row 1.\n\nSo for row 2, also unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nNow row 3: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (30,19,right,6) head=30, tail=19, right, s=6.\n\nFor right-moving, span at σ: [τ + sσ, h + sσ] = [19 + 6σ, 30 + 6σ]\n\nCover x=0 when 19 + 6σ <= 0 <= 30 + 6σ\n\nBut 19 + 6σ <=0 implies σ <= -19/6 ≈ -3.166, but σ >=0, so impossible since 19+6σ >=19>0, so never <=0.\n\n0 <= 30 + 6σ always true since 30+6σ >=30>0.\n\nSo the inequality 19+6σ <=0 <=30+6σ cannot hold because left part false for σ>=0.\n\nThus, this car never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car on row 3: (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nhead=-6? tail=-17? Let's see.\n\nThe entry is (-6, -17, right, 6)\n\nFor right-moving, span at σ: [τ + sσ, h + sσ] = [-17 + 6σ, -6 + 6σ]\n\nCover x=0 when -17 + 6σ <= 0 <= -6 + 6σ\n\nFirst inequality: -17 + 6σ <=0 => 6σ <=17 => σ <= 17/6 ≈ 2.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -6 + 6σ => 6σ >=6 => σ >=1\n\nSo for σ in [1, 2.833], integer σ=1,2\n\nAt σ=1: [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0], 0 is included? -11 <=0 <=0, yes, since <=0 and >=0, so 0 is in.\n\nSimilarly, at σ=2: [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nAt σ=3: [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car on row 3: (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nSpan: [τ + sσ, h + sσ] = [-53 + 6σ, -42 + 6σ]\n\nCover 0: -53 + 6σ <= 0 <= -42 + 6σ\n\nFirst: -53 + 6σ <=0 => 6σ <=53 => σ <= 53/6 ≈ 8.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42 + 6σ => 6σ >=42 => σ >=7\n\nSo σ in [7, 8.833], integer σ=7,8\n\nNow for row 3, we have multiple cars, so unsafe when any car covers 0.\n\nFrom first car: never\n\nSecond car: unsafe at σ=1,2\n\nThird car: unsafe at σ=7,8\n\nSo row 3 unsafe at τ=1,2,7,8\n\nτ=1,2,7,8\n\nNow row 4: same as row 3? Cars: (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6) identical to row 3.\n\nSo row 4 unsafe at same times: τ=1,2,7,8\n\nNow row 5: only one car: (30,19,right,6)\n\nAs above, this car never covers x=0, since min x is 19 at σ=0, increasing.\n\nSo row 5 is always safe? No other cars.\n\nSimilarly, row 6: (30,19,right,6), same, never covers 0, so safe.\n\nRow 7: (30,19,right,6), same, safe.\n\nRow 8: (30,19,right,6), same, safe.\n\nRow 5 to 8 each have only one car, which doesn't cover 0, so all these rows are always safe.\n\nBut row 5 has (30,19,right,6), which as we saw, span min at σ=0 is 19, increasing, so never <=0, so yes, x=0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut row 3 and 4 have additional cars that do cover 0.\n\nNow, row 1 and 2 are unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nτ=2 is turn 29.\n\nNow, player starts at τ=0, y=6.\n\ny=6 is row 6, which is always safe, since no car covers 0 on row 6.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=7,8,9: rows 7 and 8 are also always safe, as above.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nThe only dangerous rows are y=1,2,3,4, but we start at y=6, going up to y=9, so we only need to pass through y=7 and y=8 to reach y=9.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are both always safe, as per above.\n\ny=6 is safe, y=7 safe, y=8 safe.\n\nWe don't need to go to lower rows, since we are at 6 and going to 9.\n\nSo, since all rows from 6 to 8 are safe at all times, and y=9 is safe, we can just go up directly.\n\nMinimal H=3: actions U,U,U.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=6.\n\nAfter first action (t=0, action a_{27}), we go to y=7 at τ=1.\n\nPosition at τ=1 is y=7.\n\nIs it safe? y=7, row 7, which is always safe, no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, turn 28, on row 7, safe.\n\nThen action at τ=1, a_{28}, say U, go to y=8 at τ=2.\n\nPosition at τ=2, y=8, row 8, safe.\n\nThen action at τ=2, a_{29}, U, go to y=9 at τ=3.\n\nPosition at τ=3, y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nBut at τ=2, when we are on y=8, it's safe, but we need to check if during these turns, we are on safe rows.\n\nAt τ=0, we are on y=6, which is safe.\n\nWe take action at each turn.\n\nAt turn τ=0 (turn 27), position y=6, safe.\n\nTake action U, so y_{τ=1} = y_{28} = 7.\n\nAt turn τ=1 (turn 28), position y=7, safe.\n\nTake action U, y_{29} = 8.\n\nAt turn τ=2 (turn 29), position y=8, safe.\n\nTake action U, y_{30} = 9.\n\nAt turn τ=3 (turn 30), position y=9, safe.\n\nNow, is there any collision? All positions during the path: at turn 27: y=6 safe, turn 28: y=7 safe, turn 29: y=8 safe, turn 30: y=9 safe.\n\nBut at turn 29, which is τ=2, we saw that row 1 and row 2 are unsafe, but we are on row 8, which is different, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, row 3 and 4 unsafe at τ=1,2,7,8, but we are on row 7 or 8, not on 3 or 4.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, we can reach in H=3 turns with actions U,U,U.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,6) at turn 27, and after 3 actions, at turn 30, position (0,9).\n\nBut let's confirm the action sequence.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1, so for H=3, actions at t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2, i.e., turn 27,28,29.\n\nAfter these, at turn 30, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nSo for turn 27: U, turn 28: U, turn 29: U.\n\nBut at turn 29, when we are on y=8, but row 8 is safe, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at any point we might be forced to be unsafe, but no.\n\nBut row 1 and 2 are unsafe at τ=2, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nSince we go directly up through safe rows, it should be fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which is achieved.\n\nMinimal H=3.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Not necessary, since we can go directly.\n\nBut let's see the car on row 3 and 4 unsafe at τ=1 and 2, but since we are not on those rows, no issue.\n\nPerhaps if we stayed or something, but no need.\n\nSo H=3, actions U,U,U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car states.\n\nRow 5: only one car, (30,19,right,6), which never covers 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly row 6,7,8.\n\nRow 3 and 4 have cars that cover 0 at τ=1,2,7,8, but we avoid them by not being on those rows.\n\nSince we start at 6 and go to 9, we don't go to lower rows.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps the player can move down, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSo minimal is H=3.\n\nBut let's see if at τ=2, turn 29, row 1 and 2 are unsafe, but we are on row 8, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps I should list the unsafe times for each row:\n\nRow 1: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 2: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 3: unsafe at τ=1,2,7,8\n\nRow 4: unsafe at τ=1,2,7,8\n\nRow 5: always safe\n\nRow 6: always safe\n\nRow 7: always safe\n\nRow 8: always safe\n\nPlayer path: start τ=0, y=6 (safe)\n\nAfter action U, at τ=1, y=7 (safe)\n\nAfter action U, at τ=2, y=8 (safe)\n\nAfter action U, at τ=3, y=9 (safe)\n\nNo issues.\n\nIf we did nothing, but we need to reach 9, so must move up.\n\nWith S, we stay, but y doesn't increase.\n\nSo U is necessary.\n\nPerhaps we could go up slower, but that increases H.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nSo for turn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nAnd then at turn 30, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, it's up to turn t_1 + H -1, since t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=3, actions at t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 27 + 3 -1 = 29.\n\nYes.\n\nAfter action at turn 29, position at turn 30 is y=9.\n\nNow, the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 27: U \\\\ Turn 28: U \\\\ Turn 29: U }\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\netc.\n\nSo here t_1=27.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nOne thing: at τ=1, turn 28, row 3 and 4 are unsafe, but we are on row 7, not row 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly at τ=2, row 1,2,3,4 unsafe, but we are on row 8.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps if we were to go through row 4 or something, but we don't.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are safe, and we start at 6, we can go directly.\n\nBut row 5 is safe, but we don't need to go to it.\n\nAnother thing: the player can only move to adjacent y, so from 6 to 7, etc.\n\nNo diagonal.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let's see the car on row 1 and 2, at τ=2, turn 29, unsafe.\n\nBut we are not there.\n\nPerhaps for completeness, let's see when row 8 is safe, but it is always safe.\n\nThe car on row 8 is (30,19,right,6), which at any σ, span [19+6σ, 30+6σ], min at σ=0 is 19, so always >0, so x=0 never covered, so safe always.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3 with three U actions.\n\nSo the sequence is U for turn 27, U for 28, U for 29.\n\nIn the output, it should be in the box as specified.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 27: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: U }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so probably with the turn numbers.\n\nSince t_1 is given, we use the numbers.\n\nPerhaps we can write it as:\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn 27 and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Safe Rows\n- **Row 1**: One car (head=48, tail=83, direction=left, speed=36). Unsafe at τ = 2 (turn 29) only.\n- **Row 2**: One car (head=48, tail=83, direction=left, speed=36). Unsafe at τ = 2 (turn 29) only.\n- **Row 3**: Three cars:\n  - (head=30, tail=19, direction=right, speed=6): Never covers x=0 (always safe).\n  - (head=-6, tail=-17, direction=right, speed=6): Unsafe at τ = 1 (turn 28) and τ = 2 (turn 29).\n  - (head=-42, tail=-53, direction=right, speed=6): Unsafe at τ = 7 (turn 34) and τ = 8 (turn 35).\n  Thus, row 3 is unsafe at τ = 1, 2, 7, 8.\n- **Row 4**: Three cars, identical to row 3. Unsafe at τ = 1, 2, 7, 8.\n- **Row 5**: One car (head=30, tail=19, direction=right, speed=6). Never covers x=0 (always safe).\n- **Row 6**: One car (head=30, tail=19, direction=right, speed=6). Never covers x=0 (always safe).\n- **Row 7**: One car (head=30, tail=19, direction=right, speed=6). Never covers x=0 (always safe).\n- **Row 8**: One car (head=30, tail=19, direction=right, speed=6). Never covers x=0 (always safe).\n\nThe player starts at y = 6 (row 6), which is always safe. The target is y = 9, which is not a freeway and thus always safe. To reach y = 9 from y = 6, the player must pass through y = 7 and y = 8. Rows 6, 7, and 8 are always safe at all times, as no car covers x=0 on these rows.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9)\n- The minimal number of turns required is H = 3, as the player needs to increase y by 3 units (from 6 to 9).\n- Actions: Three consecutive \"U\" (up) actions.\n  - At turn 27 (τ = 0), position is (0, 6). Action U moves to y = 7 at turn 28.\n  - At turn 28 (τ = 1), position is (0, 7). Action U moves to y = 8 at turn 29.\n  - At turn 29 (τ = 2), position is (0, 8). Action U moves to y = 9 at turn 30.\n\n### Collision Check\n- Turn 27: y = 6 (row 6), always safe (no car covers x=0).\n- Turn 28: y = 7 (row 7), always safe (no car covers x=0).\n- Turn 29: y = 8 (row 8), always safe (no car covers x=0).\n- Turn 30: y = 9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nAlthough rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 are unsafe at certain times (e.g., row 1 and 2 unsafe at turn 29; row 3 and 4 unsafe at turns 28 and 29), the player is not on these rows during the path. Thus, no collision occurs.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns 27 to 29 achieves the goal in H = 3 turns, which is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 27: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. For each freeway, there are cars with positions that move left or right at given speeds. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, the car's span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new y-position, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at the beginning of the turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. But to get to y=9, I need to be at y=8 and then move up to y=9. But y=8 is a freeway with cars.\n\ny=9 is the top, so when I'm at y=8, I can move up to y=9. At that point, when I move up, at the turn I move, I'm on y=8, so I need to not collide with cars on y=8 at that turn. Then after moving, I'm at y=9, and since there are no cars on y=9, I'm safe.\n\nThe player starts at y=7 at turn t1=28.\n\nI need to find actions from turn 28 onwards to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements.\n\nThe cars move with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left, so the head decreases by s per turn, tail decreases by s per turn. Similarly for right-moving, head and tail increase by s per turn.\n\nThe span is given at turn t1=28.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know when a car's span includes 0 at turn T.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all cars on that row.\n\nAlso, for the player, y_t is the position at the beginning of turn t, and after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t, performs action a_t, then moves to y_{t+1}, and during this turn, collision is checked based on y_t and the cars on that freeway at time t.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=0 for simplicity, but it's t1=28, so I'll use relative time.\n\nSet τ = t - t1, so at τ=0, turn t1=28.\n\nPlayer at y=7.\n\nI need to get to y=9, so I need to increase y by 2.\n\nBut I have to go through y=8, which has cars.\n\ny=7 also has cars, but I start there, so I need to make sure at τ=0, when I'm at y=7, I don't collide, but since I start there, it must be safe, I assume.\n\nThe car state is given, so at turn t1, position is given, so it should be safe at start.\n\nBut for future turns, I need to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions at τ=0, which is turn 28.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head=12, tail=47, direction left, speed 36. That seems odd. Head=12, tail=47? If left-moving, head should be less than tail? I think I have confusion about head and tail.\n\nLet me read the car update.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nHere head h and tail τ, but in the notation, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, but if left-moving, and it says [h, τ] → [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ], so if h < τ, then as it moves left, h decreases, τ decreases, so the car moves left.\n\nBut in this case, for freeway 1: head=12, tail=47, but 12 < 47, so [12,47], so left end 12, right end 47? But direction left, so moving left.\n\nTypically, head might be the front, but here it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, and since it moves left, if h is left end, it should be smaller, but 12 and 47, 12<47, so left end 12, right end 47, moving left.\n\nBut when it moves left, the left end decreases, right end decreases, so the car is moving left, meaning the position is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ], so if τ and h, with τ < h, then [τ, h], moving right.\n\nIn the notation for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so τ is left, h is right, I think.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], and it moves to [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ]. If h and τ are such that h < τ, then [h, τ] is from h to τ, with h left, τ right, moving left, so both decrease.\n\nIn freeway 1: head=12, tail=47, so h=12, τ=47, so [12,47], left end 12, right end 47. Moving left at speed 36.\n\nBut speed 36? That seems very fast. Per turn, it moves 36 units? But the grid is infinite, I think, since positions can be large.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same as freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars: (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] for each car.\n\nFirst car: τ=36, h=25? 36 and 25, but 36>25, but for right-moving, [τ, h] should have τ < h, I think, but here τ=36, h=25, 36>25, so τ > h, which might be inconsistent.\n\nLet's read the car state:\n\n\" (36, 25, right, 6) \" and it says for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so if τ=36, h=25, then [36,25], but 36>25, so this is from 36 to 25? That doesn't make sense, a car can't have left larger than right.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the notation.\n\nPerhaps for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the span, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ the tail, h the head, and τ < h.\n\nBut here for freeway 3, first car: (36,25,right,6) — 36 and 25, 36>25, so if head=36, tail=25, but for right-moving, head should be on the right, so if head=36, tail=25, then tail=25 < head=36, so [τ, h] = [25,36]? But it says (36,25), so it might be (head, tail) or (tail, head)?\n\nI think there's ambiguity.\n\nLet's look at the car state table:\n\nIt says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor left-moving: d=left, and span [h, τ] with h and τ, moving left.\n\nFor right-moving: d=right, span [τ, h] with τ and h, moving right.\n\nIn freeway 3, first car: head=36, tail=25, direction right, speed 6.\n\nSince direction right, span should be [τ, h] = [25,36]? But it says head=36, tail=25, so tail=25, head=36, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] = [25,36], so left end 25, right end 36, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=0, tail=-11, direction right, so tail=-11, head=0, span [tail, head] = [-11,0], moving right.\n\nThird car: head=-36, tail=-47, direction right, so tail=-47, head=-36, span [-47,-36], moving right.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 4 same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: only one car, (36,25,right,6) so head=36, tail=25, direction right, so span [25,36] at τ=0.\n\nFreeway 6: same, (36,25,right,6) span [25,36]\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same, all have the same car? Freeway 5 to 8 all have one car each, (36,25,right,6) so span [25,36] at τ=0.\n\nBut freeway 3 and 4 have three cars each.\n\nNow for freeway 1 and 2, left-moving car with span [12,47] at τ=0, speed 36 left.\n\nSpeed 36 is very high, so it moves fast.\n\nNow, for the player to be safe on a freeway at turn T, for that freeway, at turn T, no car should have 0 in its span.\n\nSo for a given freeway k, at time τ (relative to t1), the span for each car is computed.\n\nThen 0 should not be in any span for that freeway at that time.\n\nPlayer starts at y=7 at τ=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to be at y=8 at some point and move up.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, once I'm there, I'm safe, but to get there, I need to be on y=8 and move up.\n\nAt the turn I move up from y=8 to y=9, at that turn, I'm on y=8, so I need to avoid collision on y=8 at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I'm on other freeways, I need to avoid.\n\nThe minimal number of turns should be at least 2, since I need to increase y by 2, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nBut going down might not help, since I need to go up eventually.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each freeway to see when it is safe at position 0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, find the times τ when no car on k has 0 in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need the times when 0 is not covered by any car.\n\nSince the cars move linearly, I can find for each car the times when it covers 0, then the safe times are when no car covers 0.\n\nThen for each freeway, I have a set of safe times.\n\nPlayer must be on a freeway only at safe times for that freeway.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn τ, player is on y_τ, so y_τ must be a freeway that is safe at time τ, except if y_τ=0 or 9, but 0 and 9 have no cars, so always safe, but y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut the player starts at y=7, which is a freeway, and ends at y=9, not a freeway.\n\nDuring the path, when player is on y=k for k=1 to 8, it must be at a time when freeway k is safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the safe times.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, left-moving, span at τ=0: [12,47], speed 36 left.\n\nSo at time τ, span is [12 - 36τ, 47 - 36τ]\n\nCar covers 0 when 12 - 36τ ≤ 0 ≤ 47 - 36τ\n\nSince 12 - 36τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 47 - 36τ\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36τ ≤ 0 => 12 ≤ 36τ => τ ≥ 12/36 = 1/3\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 47 - 36τ => 36τ ≤ 47 => τ ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.305\n\nSo for τ in [1/3, 47/36], approximately [0.333, 1.305], the car covers 0.\n\nSince only one car, freeway 1 is unsafe when τ in [1/3, 47/36], and safe otherwise.\n\nτ is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nτ is turn offset, so integer.\n\nτ ≥ 0.\n\nAt τ=0: 12 - 0 =12, 47-0=47, 0 not in [12,47], since 0<12, so safe.\n\nAt τ=1: 12-36= -24, 47-36=11, span [-24,11], 0 is between -24 and 11, so 0 covered, unsafe.\n\nAt τ=2: 12-72= -60, 47-72= -25, span [-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=1: -24 to 11, 0 is in, yes.\n\nτ=0: 12 to 47, 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=1: -24 to 11, 0 in, unsafe.\n\nτ=2: -60 to -25, 0 not in, safe.\n\nNow, τ ≤ 47/36≈1.305, so for τ=1, unsafe, τ=2 safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ ≥1/3≈0.333, so τ=0 <1/3? τ=0: 12-0=12>0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nFor τ=0, since τ=0, span [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nUnsafe only at τ=1.\n\nBecause τ=1: -24 to 11, includes 0.\n\nτ=2: -60 to -25, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nFor τ>2, it will be more negative, so always safe for τ≥2.\n\nSimilarly, for τ<0, but we start from τ=0, so no need.\n\nSo freeway 1: unsafe at τ=1, safe at τ=0,2,3,...\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same car configuration. So unsafe only at τ=1.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars, all right-moving, speed 6.\n\nFirst car: head=36, tail=25, direction right, so span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [25,36]\n\nAt time τ, since moving right, span [25 + 6τ, 36 + 6τ]\n\nCovers 0 when 25 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ 36 + 6τ\n\nBut 25 + 6τ ≤ 0? 6τ ≤ -25, τ ≤ -25/6 ≈ -4.166, but τ≥0, so 25+6τ ≥25>0, so 0 < 25+6τ ≤ left end, so 0 not in [25+6τ, 36+6τ] for τ≥0. Since left end min 25, always >0, so never covers 0. Safe for this car.\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, direction right, span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? Tail=-11, head=0, so [tail, head] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt time τ, moving right: [-11 + 6τ, 0 + 6τ] = [-11 + 6τ, 6τ]\n\nCovers 0 when -11 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ 6τ\n\nFirst: -11 + 6τ ≤ 0 => 6τ ≤ 11 => τ ≤ 11/6 ≈ 1.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 6τ => τ ≥ 0, always true for τ≥0.\n\nSo for τ such that -11+6τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 6τ, which is τ ≤ 11/6 and τ ≥ 0.\n\nSince τ integer, τ=0,1.\n\nAt τ=0: span [-11,0], 0 is included, since upper bound 0, so 0 covered.\n\nAt τ=1: span [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nAt τ=2: span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1.\n\nSo covers 0 at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nThird car: head=-36, tail=-47, direction right, span [tail, head] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt time τ: [-47 + 6τ, -36 + 6τ]\n\nCovers 0 when -47 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 6τ\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 6τ ≤ 0 => 6τ ≤ 47 => τ ≤ 47/6 ≈ 7.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36 + 6τ => 6τ ≥ 36 => τ ≥ 6\n\nSo for τ in [6, 47/6] ≈ [6, 7.833], so τ=6,7.\n\nAt τ=6: span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt τ=7: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nAt τ=5: [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nAt τ=8: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo third car covers 0 at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nNow for freeway 3, we have three cars:\n\n- First car: never covers 0 for τ≥0\n\n- Second car: covers 0 at τ=0 and τ=1\n\n- Third car: covers 0 at τ=6 and τ=7\n\nTherefore, freeway 3 has collision at τ=0,1,6,7 when any car covers 0.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt τ=0: second car covers 0\n\nAt τ=1: second car covers 0\n\nAt τ=6: third car covers 0\n\nAt τ=7: third car covers 0\n\nAt other times, no car covers 0, so safe.\n\nFor example, τ=2: second car [1,12], no; third car [-17,-6] no; first car [25,36] no. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=3,4,5 safe.\n\nτ=8: first [25+48,36+48]= [73,84] no; second [ -11+48, 48] = [37,48] no; third [1,12] no. Safe.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe at τ=0,1,6,7; safe at τ=2,3,4,5,8,...\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, since same cars. So unsafe at τ=0,1,6,7; safe otherwise.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car, (36,25,right,6) head=36, tail=25, direction right, span [25,36] at τ=0.\n\nAt τ, [25 + 6τ, 36 + 6τ], all positive for τ≥0, min 25>0, so never covers 0. Always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same, one car, always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: same, one car [25,36] moving right, always 25+6τ ≥25>0, so never covers 0, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 all have only one car that never covers 0, so always safe.\n\nNow, player starts at y=7 at τ=0.\n\ny=7 is freeway 7, which is always safe, as above.\n\nBut at τ=0, for freeway 7, it is safe, since no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 is freeway 8, always safe.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, always safe.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, always safe.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which has unsafe times.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3, unsafe at τ=0,1,6,7.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, which is unsafe only at τ=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, unsafe only at τ=1.\n\nNow, player at τ=0, y=7, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 and move up.\n\nSince y=8 is always safe, I can be on y=8 at any time without issue.\n\nBut to get to y=8, I can move up from y=7.\n\nAt τ=0, I can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I move up at τ=0, from y=7 to y=8 at τ=1.\n\nAt the turn τ=0, I am on y=7, which is freeway 7, always safe, so no collision.\n\nThen after action, at τ=1, I am at y=8.\n\nNow, at τ=1, I am on y=8, which is freeway 8, always safe, so no collision.\n\nThen I can move up to y=9.\n\nIf at τ=1, I move up, then at τ=2, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, when I move up at τ=1 from y=8 to y=9, at that turn τ=1, I am on y=8, which is safe, so no collision.\n\nThen at τ=2, I am at y=9, done.\n\nSo in two moves: at τ=0, move U, to y=8 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, move U, to y=9 at τ=2.\n\nH=2 turns.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nAt τ=0, start at y=7, safe.\n\nAction U, so at τ=1, y=8.\n\nDuring τ=0, I was on y=7, safe.\n\nAt τ=1, I am on y=8, safe.\n\nThen action U at τ=1, move to y=9 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=1, I am on y=8 when I perform action, so collision check is on y=8 at τ=1, which is safe.\n\nThen I arrive at y=9 at τ=2.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut is freeway 8 safe at τ=1? Yes, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 safe at τ=0.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nFreeway 8: car at [25,36] at τ=0, at τ=1, [25+6,36+6]=[31,42], not including 0, yes.\n\nFreeway 7: similarly, always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=7, which is safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, I go directly to y=8 and then to y=9.\n\nBut is there a reason to wait or something? I don't think so, since I can go up immediately.\n\nBut let me check if at τ=0, if I stay or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nMinimal turns should be 2.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in 2 turns.\n\nBut let me see the car states again.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 have unsafe times, but I don't go there.\n\nI only need to be on y=7 and y=8, both always safe for the times I am there.\n\nAt τ=0, I am on y=7, safe.\n\nAt τ=1, I am on y=8, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the actions.\n\nBut the answer should be for turns starting from t1.\n\nt1=28.\n\nSo at turn 28, action U.\n\nThen at turn 29, action U.\n\nThen at turn 30, I am at (0,9).\n\nH=2 turns.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, I think.\n\nLet me see the task.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nAt τ=0, action a_{t1}, which affects y_{t1+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{t1} for turn t1, then a_{t1+1} for turn t1+1, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, y_{t1+H} should be 9? Let's see.\n\nPlayer position: at turn t, y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nSo at turn t1, y_{t1} =7.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} =7 + delta.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + delta, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe position after H actions.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t1 + H}.\n\nSet that y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, with H=2.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t1=28, y=7.\n\nAction a_{28} = U, so y_{29} = 7 +1 =8.\n\nThen at τ=1, turn 29, action a_{29} = U, so y_{30} =8 +1=9.\n\nSo at turn 30, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd we reached in H=2 turns.\n\nBut is there any collision?\n\nAt turn 28 (τ=0), player at y=7, which is freeway 7, and at τ=0, is it safe? Freeway 7 has one car with span [25,36] at τ=0, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, so we move, but during turn 28, we are on y=7 when action happens, safe.\n\nThen at turn 29 (τ=1), player at y=8, freeway 8, span at τ=1: since right-moving, [25+6*1, 36+6*1]=[31,42], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, move to y=9.\n\nAt turn 30, y=9, no cars.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut why are there other freeways with issues? I don't care since I don't go there.\n\nSo minimal H should be 2.\n\nBut let me see if H=1 is possible? To go from y=7 to y=9 in one action? But actions only change y by at most 1, so impossible. Minimum 2.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 1 and 2 are unsafe at τ=1, but I am not on them.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 4 unsafe at some times, but not relevant.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in this case H=2.\n\nBut let me see if for some reason I cannot go up immediately.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, if I were on a freeway that is unsafe, but here it is safe.\n\nAnother thing: the player update, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y_t, with y in [0,9], so at y=7, I can go up to 8, or down to 6, or stay.\n\nSimilarly at y=8, can go up to 9.\n\ny=9, if I stay, but I don't need.\n\nIn this case, going up directly is fine.\n\nBut let me check freeway 7 and 8 at other times, but since always safe, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm the car on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7: car (36,25,right,6), so head=36, tail=25, direction right, so span [25,36] at τ=0.\n\nAt τ, [25+6τ, 36+6τ], all >=25>0, so 0 never covered, yes.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 6,5 same.\n\nFreeway 4: has cars that cover 0 at τ=0,1,6,7, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, player starts at y=7, which is freeway 7, safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the turn is t1=28.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 28: a_{28} = U \\\\ Turn 29: a_{29} = U }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 28: a_{28} = U\n\nTurn 29: a_{29} = U\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut let me see if there is a problem at τ=1 on y=8.\n\nAt τ=1, freeway 8: car position [25+6,36+6]=[31,42], not 0.\n\nBut is there any other car? No, only one car.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I misread freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7: in the table, it has one car (36,25,right,6), same as 5 and 6.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7: it says (36,25,right,6), yes.\n\nAnd for freeway 8: same.\n\nIn the table:\n\n| 7 | (36,25,right,6) |\n\n| 8 | (36,25,right,6) |\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but at τ=0, for freeway 7, y=7, position 0, car at [25,36], not 0.\n\nBut the player is at (0,y), so for freeway y, we care about x=0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut why is the initial position given, and cars, but in this case no issue.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that at the start, it might be unsafe, but here it is safe.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=0, turn t1=28, player at (0,7), and freeway 7 has car at [25,36], which does not include 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=2 is possible.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be minimal H, and the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can write it.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions\", and in this sequence, no collision.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 1 and 2, at τ=1, they are unsafe, but I am on y=8 at τ=1, not on y=1 or 2.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nSo the sequence is two actions: U at turn 28, U at turn 29.\n\nThen at turn 30, position (0,9).\n\nSo in the box.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 28\\).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,8) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that when you move to a new freeway, you're not on it until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. I'm starting at y=8, so if I can move up to y=9 in one turn without colliding, that might be possible. But I need to check if at turn t1=29, when I'm at y=8, if I move up to y=9, what happens.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. The cars are on freeways 1 to 8, and I'm on freeway 8 now, but I want to go to 9.\n\nFreeway 9 is not listed, but y=9 is the target, and there are no cars on y=9 since cars are only on 1 to 8. So once I'm on y=9, I should be safe, and I need to be there at some turn.\n\nThe collision condition is only when I'm on a freeway with cars, and for that freeway, at that turn, 0 is in some car's span.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so no issue.\n\nNow, at turn t1=29, I'm at (0,8). If I take action U, I move to y=9 at turn t1+1=30.\n\nBut at turn t1=29, I'm on y=8. I need to check if there's a collision at turn t1=29 on y=8.\n\nFor freeway 8, there is one car: (42, 31, right, 6)\n\nDirection is right, so it's moving right, meaning span increases.\n\nThe car update: for right-moving, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAt turn t1, the span is given as (head, tail), but for right-moving, head is the front, so in the span, it should be from tail to head, I think.\n\nLook at the car state: for freeway 3, it has (42,31,right,6), but 42 and 31, if right-moving, head should be larger, but 42>31, so head=42, tail=31? But in the span, it says [τ, h] for initial, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] since it's moving to increasing x.\n\nIn the description: \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn freeway 3, (42,31,right,6), but 42>31, so if head=42, tail=31, then τ=31, h=42, so span at t1 is [31,42].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in freeway 1 and 2, it's (-24,11,left,36), and direction left, so for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ] with h > τ, since moving left, decreasing x.\n\nLeft-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1, (-24,11,left,36), so h=-24, τ=11? But -24 < 11, so if it's left-moving, head should be on the left, smaller x, so h=-24, τ=11, but h < τ, and span [h,τ] would be from smaller to larger? No.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h is head, which is leftmost? But in the example, (-24,11), if left-moving, -24 is left of 11 since x decreases left, so head at -24, tail at 11, but -24 < 11, so span from h to τ with h < τ? But [h,τ] with h<τ is increasing, but it's moving left, so decreasing x.\n\nPerhaps [h,τ] means from left to right, but with h left, so if moving left, h is decreasing.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAssume x-axis: left is negative, right is positive, as per the numbers.\n\nFor left-moving car: head is at smaller x, tail at larger x. So at t1, position: head h, tail τ, with h < τ, and span is [h, τ], meaning from x=h to x=τ.\n\nWhen it moves left, both decrease.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-24,11,left,36), so h=-24, τ=11, h<τ, so span at t1: [-24,11]\n\nThen at time T, span: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-24 - s(T-t1), 11 - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: head at larger x, tail at smaller. So at t1, span [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn freeway 3: (42,31,right,6), so head=42, tail=31, τ=31, h=42, span at t1: [31,42]\n\nThen at T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [31 + s(T-t1), 42 + s(T-t1)]\n\nNow back to the problem.\n\nAt turn t1=29, I am at (0,8), so on freeway y=8.\n\nFor freeway 8, there is one car: (42,31,right,6)\n\nSo at t1=29, span is [31,42] for this car.\n\nIs 0 in [31,42]? 0 is not between 31 and 42, so no collision at t1=29.\n\nNow, if I take action U at turn t1=29, I move to y=9 at turn t1+1=30.\n\nAt turn t1=29, I am on y=8, and I take action U, so at turn t1+1=30, I am on y=9.\n\nNow, during turn t1=29, I am on y=8, and we check collision for y=8 at that turn. Since 0 not in span, no collision.\n\nThen at turn t1+1=30, I am on y=9, and there are no cars on y=9, so no collision.\n\nSo I should be able to move up immediately to y=9 in one turn.\n\nBut the minimal H is the number of turns, I think H is the number of actions, so from t1 to t1+H-1, with H actions.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so for H=1, one action at t1, and I reach at t1+1? Let's see.\n\nThe position: at turn t, I am at y_t, after action a_t, I go to y_{t+1}.\n\nI start at turn t1=29, position y_{t1} =8.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, I go to y_{t1+1}.\n\nI want y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe turn indices.\n\nSet t1 as the current turn.\n\nAt time t1, I am at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,8)\n\nI take action a_{t1}, then at time t1+1, I am at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy.\n\nI want to reach (0,9), so y_{t1 + k} =9 for some k.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, and sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, such that after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at time t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, if I take no action, I stay, but I need to reach 9.\n\nIf I take action U at t1, then at t1+1, y=9.\n\nSo with one action, at time t1+1, I am at (0,9).\n\nH is the number of actions, so H=1.\n\nSequence: one action, a_{t1} = U.\n\nNow, I need to ensure no collision during the sequence.\n\nAt turn t1=29, I am on y=8, and as above, no collision since 0 not in car span on y=8.\n\nThen I take action U, so at turn t1+1=30, I am on y=9, no cars, no collision.\n\nBut the collision is checked at each turn when I am on a freeway.\n\nAt turn t1=29, on y=8, no collision.\n\nAt turn t1+1=30, on y=9, no cars, so no collision.\n\nSeems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: one car (42,31,right,6)\n\nAt T=29, span [31,42], 0 not in, good.\n\nAt T=30, what is the span? Since I am on y=9 at T=30, I don't care about y=8 at T=30.\n\nBut just to see, at T=30, for y=8 car: s=6, T-t1=1, so span [31 +6*1, 42 +6*1] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nBut since I'm not on y=8 at T=30, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but I'm only on y=8 at T=29 and y=9 at T=30.\n\ny=9 has no cars.\n\nSo it should be possible in one turn with action U.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I start at (0,8), so moving up directly seems fine.\n\nBut why is there information about other freeways? Maybe for other positions, but here I'm already at 8.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if moving up causes issue, but in this case, no.\n\nBut let me double-check the car states.\n\nFreeway 1: (-24,11,left,36) at t1=29\n\nSpan at T: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-24 -36(T-29), 11 -36(T-29)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFirst car: τ=31? In (42,31,right,6), head=42, tail=31, so τ=31, h=42, so [31 +6(T-29), 42 +6(T-29)]\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6), head=6, tail=-5? τ=-5, h=6, so [-5 +6(T-29), 6 +6(T-29)]\n\nThird car: (-30,-41,right,6), head=-30, tail=-41? τ=-41, h=-30, so [-41 +6(T-29), -30 +6(T-29)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 same as 3.\n\nFreeway 5: one car (42,31,right,6) same as above.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: same as above.\n\nNow, I only care when I am on a freeway.\n\nAt turn t1=29, I am on y=8.\n\nCar on y=8: (42,31,right,6), span at T=29: [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nIf I go to y=9 at T=30, no issue.\n\nBut is there a reason I cannot go directly? For example, if at T=29, 0 was in the span, but it's not.\n\nPerhaps for other turns, but with one action, I only have T=29 and T=30.\n\nMaybe I need to stay or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is vertical, but the cars are horizontal, so collision only when x=0 and y same as freeway, and 0 in car span.\n\nIn this case, fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at T=30, on y=9, but y=9 no cars.\n\nBut let me see the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nIn this case, I am moving from y=8 to y=9 at turn T=29, so at turn T=29, I am on y=8, and at turn T=30, on y=9.\n\nSo for cars on y=9, at turn T=29, if there were cars, 0 in span at T=29, but I am not on y=9 at T=29, so no collision. Similarly, at T=30, I am on y=9, and if 0 in span at T=30, collision, but no cars on y=9.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=1, action a_{t1} = U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format.\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\n\nSince H=1, only one action.\n\nt1=29.\n\nSo Turn 29: U\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=29, so actions at t1.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, so t=0 corresponds to t1 +0 =29.\n\nAction a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=1, only t=0, action at t1+0=29.\n\nThen after that, at time t1+H = t1+1=30, position (0,9).\n\nNow, but I think I might be missing something because there are many cars, but for this move, I don't interact with them.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, the car might be at 0 at some other time, but at T=29, it's not.\n\nMaybe I need to consider if I should wait or something, but since I can go directly, why not.\n\nBut let me check if at T=29, for y=8, is 0 in span? No.\n\nPerhaps the car spans are long, but 0 not in.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 3,4, etc., there are cars that might be near 0, but since I'm not on those freeways, no issue.\n\nFor example, on freeway 3, at T=29, second car: (6,-5,right,6), span at T=29: [-5 +6(0), 6 +6(0)] T-t1=0, so [-5,6]\n\n0 is in [-5,6], since -5 <=0<=6.\n\nBut I am not on freeway 3 at T=29, I am on y=8, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nOnly when I am on that y.\n\nSo for going directly to y=9, it seems safe.\n\nBut y=8 is the current freeway, and I'm moving away.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the path, but with one move, no path.\n\nMaybe the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint that prevents moving up from y=8.\n\ny=8 to y=9, and y=9 is not a freeway with cars, it's the target.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, but y=0 is the bottom, y=9 top.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, meaning roads with cars, while y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume.\n\nIn the collision, it says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nAlso, player can be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nIn this case, starting at y=8, going to y=9.\n\nSo I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut why is the car state given with multiple cars and different freeways? Maybe for other starting positions, but here it's given.\n\nPerhaps I misread the position.\n\n\"Player Position: (0, 8)\" at turn t1=29.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars, but at this turn, no collision.\n\nMaybe I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if for H=1, it works.\n\nPerhaps at the exact turn, something.\n\nAnother thought: when I take action U at turn T, I move to y+1 at time T+1.\n\nAt time T, I am on y, and we check collision for y at T.\n\nThen at time T+1, I am on y+1, check for y+1 at T+1.\n\nIn this case, T=t1=29, y=8, no collision at T=29.\n\nThen at T+1=30, y=9, no cars, no collision.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut let me verify the car on freeway 8 at T=29.\n\nFreeway 8: (42,31,right,6), span [31,42], 0 not in, yes.\n\nIf I were to stay or something, but no need.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 or others, but I don't go there.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: U\n}\n\nSince H=1, only one turn.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn: current turn is t1=29, so action at turn 29.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be for t from 0 to H-1, so only one line.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut I feel like maybe I missed something because the problem might be trickier with the cars moving.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=8 for another turn, but why? I can go up.\n\nSuppose I don't go up immediately, I stay or down, but that would take more turns to reach y=9, so worse.\n\nFor instance, if I go down to y=7, then I have to come back up, which takes at least 2 more actions, so H larger.\n\nSimilarly, staying at y=8, I need to go up eventually, but later might have collision, but now it's fine.\n\nSo minimal is to go up now.\n\nPerhaps at T=29, for y=8, it is safe, but at T=30, if I were there, it might not be, but I'm not staying.\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, at T=30, span [31+6,42+6]=[37,48], 0 not in, still safe, but I don't care.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways: for example, freeway 3 at T=30: cars spans.\n\nFirst car: [31+6,42+6]=[37,48]\n\nSecond car: [-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], 0 not in? [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\n-5+6=1, 6+6=12, so [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [-41+6, -30+6]=[-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly at T=29, second car was [-5,6], which includes 0, but I was not on y=3.\n\nNow, if I were to go to other y, but I don't need to.\n\nSo I think for this, direct move is best.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=1, action U at turn 29.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: U\n}\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nIn the box.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it properly.\n\nSince it's a sequence, but only one.\n\nMaybe I should write the turn number.\n\nt1=29.\n\nSo\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: U\n}\n\nBut let me see if the player can move to y=9 directly.\n\ny=8 to y=9, yes, with U.\n\nAnd y=9 is reachable.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 29\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\nAt turn 29, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 has the state (42, 31, right, 6). For a right-moving car, the span at turn \\(T\\) is given by \\([\\tau + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\\), where \\(\\tau = 31\\) (tail), \\(h = 42\\) (head), and \\(s = 6\\). At turn \\(T = 29\\):\n- Span = \\([31 + 6(29 - 29), 42 + 6(29 - 29)] = [31, 42]\\).\n- Since 0 is not in \\([31, 42]\\), there is no collision at turn 29.\n\nTaking action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 29 moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 30. At turn 30, the player is on \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars, so no collision occurs.\n\nThus, with one action (\\(H = 1\\)), the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 30. No other sequence of actions can achieve the goal in fewer turns, as moving down or staying would require additional turns to reach \\(y = 9\\), increasing \\(H\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 29: \\(U\\)\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: U\n}",
