Internal obstacle at (6, 4).\n- **Food**:\n  - (2, 5): value = +1, life_span = 10\n  - (2, 2): value = +1, life_span = 10\n  - (6, 6): value = +1, life_span = 10\n\n### Possible Moves:\nSince the snake is currently moving Left (L), the possible moves are:\n- Continue Left (L): (2, 3)\n- Turn Up (U): (3, 4)\n- Turn Down (D): (3, 2)\n- **Cannot** turn Right (R) because it would reverse the current direction (Left to Right is instant reverse, which is forbidden).\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **Left (L) to (2, 3)**:\n   - (2, 3) is not a wall or obstacle.\n   - No food at (2, 3).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (3, 4)**:\n   - (3, 4) is not a wall or obstacle.\n   - No food at (3, 4).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (3, 2)**:\n   - (3, 2) is not a wall or obstacle.\n   - No food at (3, 2).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- The closest food is at (2, 2) and (2, 5).

There's also an internal obstacle at (6,4).\n2. **Snake**: \n   - Current position: Only the head is at (3,2). Since it's a single segment, it's both the head and the tail.\n   - Current direction: Down (D).\n3. **Food Items**: \n   - (2,5): value=1, life_span=9\n   - (2,2): value=1, life_span=9\n   - (6,6): value=1, life_span=9\n   - (2,1): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Initial Observations\n\n- The snake is currently at (3,2) and moving downward (D). \n- Since the snake is only one segment long, the tail is also at (3,2).\n- The possible moves from (3,2) are:\n  - Up (U): (3,3)\n  - Down (D): (3,1)\n  - Left (L): (2,2)\n  - Right (R): (4,2)\n\nHowever, since the current direction is Down (D), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Up (U) on the next turn. So, U is not an option.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n#### Option 1: Continue Down (D) to (3,1)\n- Check for walls: y=0 is a wall, but (3,1) is not on y=0, so it's safe.\n- Check for obstacles: (6,4) is an obstacle, but (3,1) is not (6,4), so safe.\n- Check for food: \n  - (2,1) is food, but (3,1) is not (2,1), so no food here.\n- Outcome: Moves to (3,1), no food eaten, snake remains length 1.\n\n#### Option 2: Left (L) to (2,2)\n- Check for walls: x=0 is a wall, but x=2 is not x=0, so safe.\n- Check for obstacles: (6,4) is irrelevant here.\n- Check for food: \n  - (2,2) is food. \n  - Since the snake is only one segment, the tail is at (3,2). Moving to (2,2) means the head moves onto the food, and the tail moves away from (3,2) to (2,2) (but since the snake grows, the tail stays at (3,2) and a new segment is added at (2,2)).\n  - However, the snake is length 1, so the tail is the head. After eating, the snake becomes length 2: head at (2,2), tail at (3,2).\n  - **Tail Reward Danger**: The head is at (2,2), and the tail is at (3,2). The tail has no food (since the food was at (2,2) and was eaten). So, no immediate danger.\n- Outcome: Moves to (2,2), eats food, length increases to 2, score +1.\n\n#### Option 3: Right (R) to (4,2)\n- Check for walls: x=7 is a wall, but x=4 is not x=7, so safe.\n- Check for obstacles: (6,4) is irrelevant.\n- Check for food: No food at (4,2).\n- Outcome: Moves to (4,2), no food eaten, snake remains length 1.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- **Down (D)**: Safe, but no immediate reward.\n- **Left (L)**: Eats food, increases length, and score. No immediate danger.\n- **Right (R)**: Safe, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Only relevant if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food. In this case, after moving Left, the head is at (2,2), tail at (3,2). The tail does not have food, so no danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) to (2,2) to eat the food and increase the score. \n\n### Verification\n\n- **Food at (2,2)**: \n  - Value: +1\n  - Life Span: 9 (but since it's turn 1, it will disappear at turn 10 if not eaten).\n- **Movement**: \n  - Current direction is D, moving L is allowed (not an instant reverse).\n  - New head position: (2,2).\n  - Snake grows to length 2: [(2,2), (3,2)].\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe optimal move is to go Left (L).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

These are the edges of the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (6, 4) — a single wall inside the grid at this coordinate.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (2, 2), body segment at (3, 2).\n   - **Direction**: Currently moving Left (L). This means the snake was moving left in the previous turn.\n4. **Food**:\n   - (2, 5): value = 8, life_span = 1\n   - (6, 6): value = 8, life_span = 1\n   - (2, 1): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n**Note on Food Values**: The values seem unusually high (8, 8, 9), which might be a typo since typically food values are +1 or -1. Assuming these are positive foods with values as given.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot move Right (R) in the next turn.\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Left (L)**:\n   - Current head: (2, 2)\n   - New head position: (2 - 1, 2) = (1, 2)\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (1, 2) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Snake body is at (3, 2), not (1, 2).\n   - Safe move.\n   - Food: No food at (1, 2).\n   - Outcome: Moves left, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Up (U)**:\n   - New head position: (2, 2 + 1) = (2, 3)\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is a wall, (2, 3) is not a wall.\n     - Body: No body at (2, 3).\n   - Safe move.\n   - Food: No food at (2, 3).\n   - Outcome: Moves up, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Down (D)**:\n   - New head position: (2, 2 - 1) = (2, 1)\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is a wall, (2, 1) is not a wall.\n     - Body: No body at (2, 1).\n   - Food: There is food at (2, 1) with value 9, life_span 1.\n     - To eat this food, the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, the body is at (3, 2), not on (2, 1), so no need for the body to move away first.\n   - Eating food:\n     - Value: +9 (high reward).\n     - Length increases by 1: new body segment added where the tail was.\n     - New snake positions: [(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)].\n     - Check for Tail Reward Danger:\n       - After eating, tail is at (3, 2).\n       - New head is at (2, 1), adjacent to tail at (3, 2)? \n         - Adjacent means sharing an edge: (2,1) is adjacent to (2,2), (1,1), (3,1), (2,0). Not directly adjacent to (3,2).\n       - So no immediate collision danger.\n   - Safe and high-reward move.\n\n### Evaluating Food Lifespans\n\nAll foods have life_span = 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. So this is the last chance to eat them.\n\n- (2,5): Not reachable this turn (need at least 3 moves up).\n- (6,6): Far away, not reachable.\n- (2,1): Reachable by moving Down.\n\n### Decision\n\n- Moving Down allows eating high-value food (9) before it disappears.\n- No immediate collision risks.\n- Other moves don't offer immediate rewards.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- After eating, the snake grows, making future movements slightly more constrained.\n- Need to ensure that future moves don't trap the snake, but at length 3, it's manageable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to eat the high-value food at (2,1).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 3\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake cannot go beyond these borders.\n   - Internal obstacle: (6,4). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (2,1)\n   - Body segments: (2,2), (3,2)\n   - So, the snake's full body is: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Down (\"D\"). This means the last move was from (2,2) to (2,1) (since moving down decreases the y-coordinate).\n5. **Food**:\n   - (2,5): value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - (6,6): value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - Wait, the format seems a bit off. The food is given as (x, y, life_span, value), so:\n     - Food at (2,5): life_span = 7, value = +1\n     - Food at (6,6): life_span = 7, value = +1\n   - Both foods are positive (+1), and they'll disappear after 7 turns from their spawn (but current turn is 3, so they'll disappear at turn 10 if not eaten).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is D (down), the snake cannot move Up (U) next, as that would be the opposite direction.\n   - Opposite of D is U, so U is forbidden.\n   - Allowed moves: D, L, R\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**:\n   - Current head position: (2,1)\n   - Possible moves from (2,1):\n     - D: (2,0) → y=0 is a border wall → cannot move D (would collide with wall)\n     - L: (1,1) → check if (1,1) is a wall or obstacle:\n       - Walls: x=0 is border, x=7 is border, y=0/y=7 are borders. (1,1) is not a border.\n       - Internal obstacles: only (6,4) → (1,1) is clear.\n     - R: (3,1) → check:\n       - Not a border or obstacle.\n\n   So, possible non-reverse moves that don't hit walls: L, R\n\n3. **Body Collisions**:\n   - Snake body segments: (2,2), (3,2)\n   - Moving to:\n     - L: (1,1) → not in body segments → safe\n     - R: (3,1) → not in body segments → safe\n   - Both L and R are safe from body collisions.\n\n4. **Food Considerations**:\n   - Food positions:\n     - (2,5): far from current head (2,1)\n     - (6,6): also far\n   - No immediate food to eat in the next move, so no need to consider eating food this turn.\n   - Also, no food is under the snake's body currently (body is at (2,2) and (3,2); food is at (2,5) and (6,6)).\n\n5. **Tail Reward Danger**:\n   - Tail is at (3,2) (last segment).\n   - Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n     - Head at (2,1), tail at (3,2):\n       - Distance: |2-3| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2 (not adjacent; adjacent would be distance 1)\n     - So, no adjacency, no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Choosing Between L and R\n\nBoth L and R are safe moves. Now, let's think about future moves:\n\n- Current head direction is D, but we can't continue D (would hit wall), and can't reverse to U.\n- Choosing L or R will set the new direction.\n\nWhich is better?\n\n1. **Move L to (1,1)**:\n   - Next moves: from (1,1), possible directions (since coming from (2,1), can't reverse to R immediately):\n     - U: (1,2)\n     - D: (1,0) → wall\n     - L: (0,1) → wall\n     - So, only U is possible next move if we go L now.\n   - This might limit options next turn.\n\n2. **Move R to (3,1)**:\n   - Next moves: from (3,1), coming from (2,1), can't reverse to L immediately:\n     - U: (3,2) → currently body is at (3,2), but by next turn, the tail will have moved (since snake moves forward, tail segment at (3,2) will move to where (2,2) was, assuming body follows).\n       - Current body: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2)]\n       - After moving R to (3,1), new body: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n       - So next turn, tail is at (2,2), and (3,2) is empty.\n       - Moving U to (3,2): is (3,2) occupied next turn? No, because tail moves from (3,2) to (2,2).\n       - So U is safe.\n     - D: (3,0) → wall\n     - R: (4,1) → safe\n     - So next turn after R, can choose U or R.\n\nMoving R seems to give more options next turn (U or R), whereas moving L only allows U next turn. So R is more flexible.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food\n\nJust to confirm, no food is at (1,1) or (3,1), so no eating this turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween L and R, R is better because it provides more options for the next move. \n\nHowever, let me think about the path towards food:\n\n- Food at (2,5): to reach it, need to go up. Currently at (2,1), so need to go U eventually.\n- Food at (6,6): need to go right and up.\n- Moving R now can help in reaching (6,6), but moving L might be better to eventually go up towards (2,5).\nBut (2,5) is closer in terms of y-coordinate (distance 4 in y vs (6,6) distance 5 in y and 4 in x).\n\nBut since no food is immediately accessible, and R gives more options next turn, R seems better.\n\nWait, another consideration: after moving R to (3,1), next turn can go U to (3,2), then can go L to (2,2) or R to (4,2), etc., moving towards (2,5).\n\nAlternatively, moving L to (1,1), then U to (1,2), then R to (2,2), etc., also towards (2,5).\n\nBoth paths can reach food, but R gives more immediate options next turn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving R to (3,1)?\n\n- Next body after R: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n- Next possible moves from (3,1): U to (3,2) (safe), R to (4,1) (safe)\n- No immediate collision risks.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (1,1):\n\n- Next body: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n- Next move only U to (1,2) (safe)\n- Then can go R to (2,2) (but (2,2) is body, but by then it would have moved? Wait:\n   - After L to (1,1), body is [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n   - Then U to (1,2), body is [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]\n   - Then can go R to (2,2) (but (2,1) is body, but (2,2) is empty)\n   - Seems okay.\n\nBoth paths seem safe, but R gives more options next turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter considering all factors, moving **Right (R)** seems the best immediate action as it provides more flexibility for future moves without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action for the snake to take at Turn \\( t_0 = 4 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n- **Border Walls:** x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n- **Internal Obstacle:** There's one at (6, 4). So, the snake cannot move to (6, 4).\n\n**2. Snake's Current Position and Direction:**\n- **Positions (head first):** [(3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2)]\n  - Head: (3, 1)\n  - Body segments: (2, 1), (2, 2)\n- **Current Direction:** R (Right). This means the snake was moving to the right to reach (3, 1) from (2, 1).\n\n**3. Food Items:**\nThere are three food items on the grid:\n  1. (2, 5) - Value: 1, Life Span: 6\n  2. (6, 6) - Value: 1, Life Span: 6\n  3. (5, 4) - Value: 1, Life Span: 10\n\nAll foods are positive (value = +1), and none are negative in this scenario.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3, 1), the snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, we must consider:\n- **No instant reverse:** The current direction is R (Right), so the opposite direction is L (Left). Therefore, the snake cannot move Left next.\n- **Wall collisions:** Cannot move outside the grid or into walls.\n- **Body collisions:** Cannot move into any body segment except the tail (since the tail will move forward).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n**1. Up (U) - (x, y+1) = (3, 2)**\n- Check if (3, 2) is a wall: No.\n- Check if (3, 2) is a body segment: Current body segments are (2,1) and (2,2). (3,2) is not in the body.\n- Valid move.\n\n**2. Down (D) - (x, y-1) = (3, 0)**\n- y=0 is a border wall. Cannot move here.\n- Invalid move.\n\n**3. Left (L) - (x-1, y) = (2, 1)**\n- Opposite of current direction (R). Instant reverse is not allowed.\n- Invalid move.\n\n**4. Right (R) - (x+1, y) = (4, 1)**\n- Check if (4, 1) is a wall: No.\n- Check if (4, 1) is a body segment: No.\n- Valid move.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: Up (U) or Right (R).\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nNow, let's see which of these moves is better in terms of:\n- Eating positive food.\n- Avoiding risks (collisions, getting trapped, etc.).\n\n**Move Up (U) to (3, 2):**\n- Is there food at (3, 2)? Checking the food positions:\n  - (2,5), (6,6), (5,4) — no, (3,2) has no food.\n- After moving, the new snake positions would be: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1)] (tail (2,2) is removed).\n- Future considerations: Moving up doesn't immediately eat food, but it might be a safe move to position for future food.\n\n**Move Right (R) to (4, 1):**\n- Is there food at (4, 1)? No.\n- New snake positions: [(4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)] (tail (2,2) is removed).\n- Future considerations: Similar to Up, no immediate food, but moves the snake towards the right side where some food is located (e.g., (5,4), (6,6)).\n\n### Checking for Food Accessibility\n\nLet's see where the foods are and how to reach them:\n\n1. (2, 5):\n   - Currently at (3,1). To reach (2,5), need to go left then up several times, but left is not allowed now (instant reverse from R). So, not immediately accessible.\n   \n2. (6, 6):\n   - Far to the right and up. From (3,1), need to go right to increase x, then up to increase y.\n   \n3. (5, 4):\n   - Right and up. From (3,1), right to (4,1), then (5,1), then up to (5,2), (5,3), (5,4).\n\nBetween Up and Right, moving Right seems to be a step towards (5,4) and (6,6), whereas Up doesn't directly help in reaching food quickly.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n**Tail Reward Danger:**\n- This is when the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has positive food. Eating it would kill the snake because the head and newly grown tail would collide.\n- Current tail is at (2,2). Adjacent cells to tail: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3).\n- Head is at (3,1). Adjacent to head: (3,2), (4,1), (2,1), (3,0) — but (3,0) is a wall.\n- Adjacent to both head and tail: (2,1) is part of the body, not tail's position. (3,2) is adjacent to tail but not head's current position unless we move there.\n- Currently, no immediate tail reward danger unless we move to (3,2) where tail is at (2,2), but (3,2) is adjacent to tail (distance is 1), but (2,2) doesn't have food on it (food is at (2,5), etc.). So, no danger here.\n\n### Decision Between U and R\n\nBoth moves are safe in terms of immediate collisions. Now, which one is better strategically?\n\n- **Up (U) to (3,2):**\n  - Moves towards the center, but not directly towards any food.\n  - Next moves could be to go towards (2,5), but that would require going left, which might not be possible if coming from right.\n  \n- **Right (R) to (4,1):**\n  - Moves towards (5,4) and (6,6).\n  - From (4,1), next could go right to (5,1), then up to (5,2), etc., towards (5,4).\n  - Or from (4,1), could go up to (4,2), then right to (5,2), etc.\n\nMoving Right seems more aligned with reaching the food at (5,4) and (6,6) in the future.\n\n### Verifying Immediate Food Opportunities\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately by moving in a certain direction? Currently, no food is adjacent to the head (3,1):\n\n- Adjacent to (3,1):\n  - (3,2), (4,1), (2,1), (3,0) — none of these have food.\n  \nSo, no immediate food to eat; the decision is based on future pathing.\n\n### Checking for Traps or Dead Ends\n\nIs there any risk of getting trapped by moving Right?\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), the snake is at [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1)].\n\nPossible next moves from (4,1):\n- Direction would be R (since we moved right to get there), so can't move L next.\n- Possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nFrom (4,1):\n- U to (4,2): safe\n- D to (4,0): wall, invalid\n- R to (5,1): safe\n\nSo, no immediate trap.\n\nSimilarly, moving Up to (3,2) also doesn't lead to an immediate trap.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween U and R, moving Right seems more advantageous as it progresses the snake towards the food at (5,4) and (6,6), whereas moving Up doesn't provide a clear path to food in the immediate future.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn (t₀)**: 5\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - Internal obstacle: (6, 4)\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (4, 1)\n   - Body: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1)] \n     - So, the snake is moving right (direction R), with the head at (4,1), next segment at (3,1), and tail at (2,1).\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: R (right)\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (2, 5): value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - (6, 6): value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - (5, 4): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Snake Movement Constraints\n\n- **Current Direction**: R (right)\n- **Cannot reverse**: Since the snake is moving right (R), it cannot immediately go left (L) next turn.\n- Possible moves: U (up), D (down), R (right)\n\n### Possible Actions and Their Outcomes\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move (U, D, R):\n\n1. **Move Right (R)**:\n   - New head position: (4+1, 1) = (5, 1)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a wall, (5,1) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Current body segments are at (3,1) and (2,1). (5,1) is not in the body.\n   - Food at (5,1)? No food listed there.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Move Up (U)**:\n   - New head position: (4, 1+1) = (4, 2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is the top wall, (4,2) is safe.\n     - Body: (4,2) is not in the current body [(3,1), (2,1)].\n   - Food at (4,2)? No food listed there.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Move Down (D)**:\n   - New head position: (4, 1-1) = (4, 0)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is a wall, so (4,0) is a wall cell → collision!\n   - Outcome: Dies by hitting the wall. Invalid move.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nNow, let's look at the food items to see if any are reachable or beneficial to go for:\n\n1. **(2, 5)**: value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (4,1): |4-2| + |1-5| = 2 + 4 = 6\n   - Life_span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current).\n   - To reach (2,5) from (4,1) in one move is impossible (need at least 6 moves).\n   - Not reachable this turn.\n\n2. **(6, 6)**: value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |4-6| + |1-6| = 2 + 5 = 7\n   - Also cannot be reached in one move.\n   - Life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n\n3. **(5, 4)**: value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |4-5| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Cannot be reached in one move.\n   - Life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n\nNone of the food items can be eaten in the immediate next move because they're all more than one cell away.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail position: (2,1)\n- Is there food at (2,1)? Checking the food list:\n  - (2,5), (6,6), (5,4) → no, no food at (2,1).\n- Adjacent to tail: cells adjacent to (2,1) are (1,1), (3,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n  - Head is at (4,1), not adjacent to tail (distance is 2).\n- So, no danger from this rule currently.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the possible moves (U, R):\n\n- **Move Right (R)**:\n  - New head: (5,1)\n  - Next turn, cannot move left (reverse of R is L, which is forbidden).\n  - Future options from (5,1): U, D, R\n    - U: (5,2)\n    - D: (5,0) → wall, invalid\n    - R: (6,1)\n  \n- **Move Up (U)**:\n  - New head: (4,2)\n  - Next turn, cannot move down (reverse of U is D, forbidden).\n  - Future options from (4,2): U, L, R\n    - U: (4,3)\n    - L: (3,2) → current body is at (3,1) and (2,1), so (3,2) is safe\n    - R: (5,2)\n\nBetween R and U, both are safe. Which is better?\n\nLooking ahead:\n\n- Moving R to (5,1):\n  - Next possible moves: U to (5,2), R to (6,1)\n  - (6,1): is that safe?\n    - Walls: x=7 is wall, (6,1) is not a wall.\n    - Internal obstacle: (6,4) is not (6,1).\n    - Body: next body will be (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) → (6,1) not in body.\n    - Safe.\n\n- Moving U to (4,2):\n  - Next possible moves: U to (4,3), L to (3,2), R to (5,2)\n  - All seem safe.\n\nNo immediate advantage to either move in terms of food, since none are reachable this turn. Both moves are safe.\n\n### Choosing Between U and R\n\nSince both moves are safe and no food is immediately reachable, we can choose either. However, moving right (R) keeps the snake moving in the same direction, which might be simpler unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n\n- (5,4) is high value (9), but life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n- To reach (5,4) from (4,1), the path would be:\n  - Current: (4,1)\n  - Next: (4,2) (U), then (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) → but food will be gone by then.\n  \nSimilarly for other foods, they're too far and will disappear.\n\nSince no food is capturable this turn, and both U and R are safe, perhaps moving right is slightly better to keep options open for future moves towards the center where more food might spawn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Body\n\nThe rule mentions that food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrent body segments:\n- (4,1): head\n- (3,1)\n- (2,1)\n\nFood positions:\n- (2,5), (6,6), (5,4) → none under body.\n\nSo, no food under the body to consider.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth moving Up (U) and Right (R) are safe and equivalent in terms of immediate benefits since no food is reachable this turn. Moving Right maintains the current direction, which is a reasonable default when no better option is present.\n\nTherefore, the action is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So, the snake cannot move to these coordinates.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (6, 4).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (5, 1), then body at (4, 1), and tail at (3, 1).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving to the Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (2, 5): value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - (6, 6): value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - (5, 4): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake and food positions:\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head: (5, 1)\n  - Body: (4, 1)\n  - Tail: (3, 1)\n  \n  The snake is moving right, so its body is extending to the left.\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (2, 5): Far to the left and up.\n  - (6, 6): To the right and up, near the border.\n  - (5, 4): Directly above the head.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n\n1. **Current Direction**: Right (R).\n   - Cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) next turn.\n   - So, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (6, 1)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (6, 1)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - x=7 is a wall, but (6,1) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacle is at (6,4), not (6,1).\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - Current body: (4,1), (3,1). (6,1) is not part of the body.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - No food at (6,1).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5, 2)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5, 2)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - y=7 is far, no walls at (5,2).\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - Body at (4,1), (3,1). (5,2) is not part of the body.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - No food at (5,2).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5, 0)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5, 0)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - y=0 is a wall. (5,0) is on the wall.\n- **Outcome**: Wall collision → Death. Invalid move.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's consider the food positions and their values:\n\n1. **(2, 5)**: value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (5,1): |5-2| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps away.\n   - Life_span is 1, so it will disappear next turn. Cannot reach it in time.\n   \n2. **(6, 6)**: value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |5-6| + |1-6| = 1 + 5 = 6 steps away.\n   - Life_span is 1, cannot reach in time.\n   \n3. **(5, 4)**: value = 8, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |5-5| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3 steps away.\n   - Life_span is 1, cannot reach in time.\n\nNone of the food can be reached before they disappear, so eating food is not an option this turn.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states:\n> If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nCurrent tail is at (3,1). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (2,1), (4,1), (3,0), (3,2)\n\nHead is at (5,1), which is not adjacent to (3,1). So, no tail reward danger.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nFrom possible moves (R, U):\n\n- **Right (R)**:\n  - Moves to (6,1).\n  - Next turn, cannot move left (reverse), so possible moves: U, D, R.\n  - From (6,1), moving right would go to (7,1), which is a wall (x=7). So, not safe.\n  - Moving up from (6,1) to (6,2) is safe.\n  - Moving down to (6,0) is a wall (y=0).\n\n- **Up (U)**:\n  - Moves to (5,2).\n  - Next turn, cannot move down (reverse), so possible moves: U, L, R.\n  - From (5,2), moving up to (5,3) is safe.\n  - Moving left to (4,2) is safe.\n  - Moving right to (6,2) is safe.\n\n**Comparison**:\n- Moving Right now limits future moves more (next turn cannot go right again).\n- Moving Up keeps more options open for next turn.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nIf we move Up to (5,2), next turn we can consider moving towards the food at (5,4), but it will disappear by then. However, moving up gets us closer to the center, which might be safer in terms of avoiding walls.\n\nMoving Right to (6,1) brings us closer to the right wall, limiting space.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that no food is reachable this turn, the priority is to stay alive and keep options open. Moving Up seems better than moving Right because:\n\n1. It moves away from the bottom wall (y=0).\n2. It keeps more movement options open for the next turn.\n3. Moving Right would corner us near the right wall sooner.\n\n### Verifying Safety\n\n- Moving Up to (5,2):\n  - New snake positions: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]\n  - No body collisions.\n  - No wall collisions.\n  - No food eaten (none at (5,2)).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most strategic move is **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn (t₀)**: 7\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and the snake can't go beyond these borders.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (6,4). The snake can't move into this cell.\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (5,2)\n   - Body segments: (5,1), (4,1)\n   - So, the snake's length is 3.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Up (\"U\").\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (2,5): value=3, life_span=1\n   - (6,6): value=3, life_span=1\n   - (5,4): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (4,5): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,2) moving Up (\"U\"), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (5,1) — but this is the body segment immediately after the head, so moving here would cause a collision (unless it's the tail, which it isn't in this case since the tail is at (4,1)).\n- **Left (L)**: (4,2)\n- **Right (R)**: (6,2)\n\nBut we have to consider the \"no instant reverse\" rule. The current direction is Up, so the opposite is Down. Therefore, we cannot move Down next. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (5,3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body: Snake segments are at (5,1), (4,1). (5,3) is not occupied by body.\n     - Walls: (5,3) is within borders and not an internal obstacle.\n   - Check for food: No food at (5,3).\n   - Next positions:\n     - Head moves to (5,3).\n     - Body segments: (5,2), (5,1). Tail (4,1) is removed.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate gain.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (4,2)**:\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Body: (4,2) is not occupied by body (body is at (5,1), (4,1)).\n     - Walls: (4,2) is within borders and not an internal obstacle.\n   - Check food: No food at (4,2).\n   - Next positions:\n     - Head: (4,2)\n     - Body: (5,2), (5,1)\n   - Safe move, no immediate gain.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (6,2)**:\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Body: (6,2) is not occupied by body.\n     - Walls: (6,2) is within borders. Internal obstacle is at (6,4), so (6,2) is safe.\n   - Check food: No food at (6,2).\n   - Next positions:\n     - Head: (6,2)\n     - Body: (5,2), (5,1)\n   - Safe move, no immediate gain.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if any are reachable soon or if we should position ourselves to reach them:\n\n1. **(2,5)**: value=3, life=1\n   - Distance from (5,2): |5-2| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6. Too far to reach in next move.\n2. **(6,6)**: value=3, life=1\n   - Distance: |5-6| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5. Also too far.\n3. **(5,4)**: value=7, life=1\n   - Distance: |5-5| + |2-4| = 0 + 2 = 2. Could reach in 2 moves if we go up twice.\n   - Current move to (5,3), then next move to (5,4).\n   - But life_span is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn, including current). So at turn 8, it's gone. We can't reach it in time.\n4. **(4,5)**: value=10, life=1\n   - Distance: |5-4| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4. Also can't reach in time.\n\nAll food items will disappear after this turn, so we can't eat any of them in the next move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nWe need to ensure that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it would kill the snake.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,1). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (3,1), (5,1), (4,0), (4,2)\n\nHead is at (5,2). Adjacent to head:\n- (5,3), (5,1), (4,2), (6,2)\n\nIntersection of adjacent to head and adjacent to tail: (5,1), (4,2)\n\nNow, check if these cells have positive food:\n- (5,1): No food listed there.\n- (4,2): No food listed there.\n\nSo, no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince all food will disappear after this turn and none are adjacent to the head, we should choose a safe move that doesn't lead to a dead end and keeps options open for future moves.\n\nPossible safe moves:\n- U to (5,3)\n- L to (4,2)\n- R to (6,2)\n\nLet's consider future moves after each:\n\n1. **U to (5,3)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (5,3): U (to (5,4)), L (to (4,3)), R (to (6,3))\n   - (5,4) is an internal obstacle (6,4) is wall, but (5,4) is not listed as wall, but food is at (5,4) with life=1, which will be gone by then.\n   - Seems safe.\n\n2. **L to (4,2)**:\n   - Next moves from (4,2): U (to (4,3)), D (to (4,1) - tail is moving away), L (to (3,2)), R (to (5,2) - body is at (5,2) after move, but tail moves away, so (5,2) is now body segment (5,1) moves to (5,2), but original (5,2) is head moving to (4,2), so body is (5,2), (5,1). Wait, no: after moving to (4,2), body is (5,2), (5,1). So next head at (4,2), body (5,2), (5,1). Then moving R to (5,2) would collide with body. So R is not safe next move.\n   - So next moves would be U, D, L.\n\n3. **R to (6,2)**:\n   - Next moves from (6,2): U (to (6,3)), D (to (6,1)), L (to (5,2)), R (to (7,2) - x=7 is wall)\n   - L to (5,2): body is (5,2), (5,1), so (5,2) is body, collision.\n   - So next moves: U, D, R (but R is wall), so only U, D.\n\nMoving Up seems to keep the most options open for next moves.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Up (U)** seems the safest with the most future flexibility, as it doesn't immediately restrict future moves and avoids any potential collisions.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

This means the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (6, 4).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is at [(5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1)]. \n     - Head is at (5, 3).\n     - Body segments are at (5, 2) and (5, 1).\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving \"Up\" (U), meaning its last move was in the positive y-direction.\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are four pieces of food on the grid:\n     1. (2, 5): value = 2, life_span = 1\n     2. (6, 6): value = 2, life_span = 1\n     3. (5, 4): value = 6, life_span = 1\n     4. (4, 5): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the snake's current direction is U (Up), it cannot immediately move Down (D) in the next turn.\n   - So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move's safety and potential rewards.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (5, 4)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5, 4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - (5,4) is not a border wall (x=5, y=4; borders are at y=0 and y=7).\n    - (5,4) is not the internal obstacle at (6,4).\n    - So, no wall collision.\n  - **Body**:\n    - Current body segments are at (5,2) and (5,1).\n    - Moving to (5,4) doesn't overlap with any body segment.\n    - After moving, the tail will move forward, so the new body will be [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2)]. The tail at (5,1) is removed.\n    - No collision with body.\n- **Food at (5,4)**:\n  - There is food at (5,4) with value=6, life_span=1.\n  - Eating this food would:\n    - Increase score by +6.\n    - Increase length by +1 (new tail added where the current tail is, so new body would be [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)]).\n  - **Tail Reward Danger Check**:\n    - Current tail is at (5,1).\n    - Adjacent cells to head (5,3) are:\n      - Up: (5,4) - this is where we're moving.\n      - Down: (5,2) - body segment.\n      - Left: (4,3)\n      - Right: (6,3)\n    - The tail is at (5,1), which is not adjacent to the head (distance is 2 in y-direction).\n    - So, no danger from tail reward.\n  - **Conclusion**: Safe to eat, good reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (4, 3)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (4, 3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**:\n    - (4,3) is not a border wall.\n    - Not the internal obstacle (which is at (6,4)).\n    - Safe.\n  - **Body**:\n    - Current body segments are at (5,2) and (5,1).\n    - (4,3) is not overlapping with any body segment.\n    - New body would be [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)]. Tail at (5,1) is removed.\n    - No collision.\n- **Food**:\n  - No food at (4,3).\n  - **Adjacent Food**:\n    - (4,5) is nearby but not directly reachable in one move.\n    - Moving left doesn't eat any food immediately.\n  - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6, 3)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (6, 3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**:\n    - (6,3) is not a border wall.\n    - Not the internal obstacle (which is at (6,4)).\n    - Safe.\n  - **Body**:\n    - Current body segments are at (5,2) and (5,1).\n    - (6,3) is not overlapping with any body segment.\n    - New body would be [(6,3), (5,3), (5,2)]. Tail at (5,1) is removed.\n    - No collision.\n- **Food**:\n  - No food at (6,3).\n  - **Adjacent Food**:\n    - (6,6) is above and to the right, but not directly reachable.\n  - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\nNow, let's compare the possible moves:\n\n1. **Move Up (U)**:\n   - Eats food at (5,4) with value=6.\n   - Increases length by 1.\n   - Safe, no collisions.\n   - High reward.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**:\n   - No food eaten.\n   - Safe, but no immediate benefit.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**:\n   - No food eaten.\n   - Safe, but no immediate benefit.\n\nClearly, moving Up to eat the high-value food at (5,4) is the most advantageous move at this turn.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's ensure that eating the food at (5,4) doesn't cause a tail reward danger:\n\n- After eating:\n  - New body: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)].\n  - Tail is at (5,1).\n  - Head is at (5,4).\n  - Adjacent to head:\n    - Up: (5,5) - empty.\n    - Down: (5,3) - body segment.\n    - Left: (4,4) - empty.\n    - Right: (6,4) - wall (internal obstacle).\n  - Tail is at (5,1), which is not adjacent to head (distance is 3 in y-direction).\n  - So, no danger.\n\n### Checking Other Foods\n\nJust to ensure we're not missing anything:\n\n- Food at (2,5): life_span=1, so it will disappear next turn. Currently at turn 8, it will disappear at turn 9. Not reachable in one move from (5,3).\n- Food at (6,6): life_span=1, disappears at turn 9. Not reachable in one move.\n- Food at (4,5): life_span=9, so it will stay for a while. Not reachable in one move from (5,3).\n\nThus, the only food we can eat immediately is at (5,4).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven all the above analysis, the best immediate action is to move Up (U) to eat the high-value food at (5,4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n**Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (cannot move to these coordinates).\n- Internal obstacle: (6, 4) — cannot move here.\n\n**Snake**:\n- Positions (head first): [(5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1)]\n  - Head at (5, 4), direction is Up (U).\n  - Body segments at (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (2, 5): value = 1, life_span = 1\n2. (6, 6): value = 1, life_span = 1\n3. (4, 5): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Up, the snake cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move from (5, 4) to (5, 5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (5,5) is within bounds (x=5 is not 0 or 7; y=5 is not 0 or 7).\n     - Obstacles: (6,4) is not (5,5).\n     - Body: Snake body is at (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) — no collision.\n   - Food at (5,5)? No.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate benefit.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move from (5, 4) to (4, 4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,4) is within bounds.\n     - Obstacles: (6,4) is not (4,4).\n     - Body: Snake body is at (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) — no collision.\n   - Food at (4,4)? No.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate benefit.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move from (5, 4) to (6, 4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (6,4) is within bounds (x=6 is not 0 or 7; y=4 is not 0 or 7).\n     - Obstacles: (6,4) is an internal obstacle — **collision**.\n   - Cannot move here.\n\nSo, possible safe moves are U and L.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving towards any food is beneficial and safe.\n\n**Food at (2,5)**:\n- Distance from head (5,4): |5-2| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n- Life_span = 1, so it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current).\n- To reach (2,5) in one move, we'd need to move to (2,5) directly, which isn't possible from (5,4) in one move (would need to move left 3 times and up once).\n- Not reachable in one move, and will disappear after this turn. So, not useful.\n\n**Food at (6,6)**:\n- Distance from head (5,4): |5-6| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n- Life_span = 1, will disappear after this turn.\n- To reach (6,6) in one move, need to move right to (6,4) then up twice, but (6,4) is an obstacle.\n- Not reachable in one move, and will disappear. Not useful.\n\n**Food at (4,5)**:\n- Distance from head (5,4): |5-4| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Life_span = 8, so it will stay for several more turns.\n- To reach (4,5) in one move, need to move left to (4,4) then up to (4,5), or up to (5,5) then left to (4,5).\n- Not reachable in one move, but can plan to reach it in future moves.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if any food is adjacent to the tail and is positive:\n- Tail is at (5,1).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (4,1), (6,1), (5,0), (5,2).\n  - (5,0) is a wall.\n  - (5,2) is part of the snake's body.\n  - (4,1) and (6,1): no food listed there.\n- No food adjacent to tail that poses a danger.\n\n### Decision Between U and L\n\nBoth U and L are safe moves with no immediate food benefit. We should choose the move that positions the snake better for future moves towards the remaining food at (4,5).\n\n- **Move Up (U) to (5,5)**:\n  - Next moves could be L to (4,5) to reach the food.\n  - But from (5,5), moving L to (4,5) is possible unless there's an obstacle (no obstacle at (4,5)).\n  \n- **Move Left (L) to (4,4)**:\n  - Next moves could be U to (4,5) to reach the food.\n  - From (4,4), moving U to (4,5) is straightforward.\n\nBetween the two, moving Left (L) to (4,4) sets up a direct path to the food at (4,5) in the next move (U). Moving Up first would require an additional move to reach the food.\n\n### Verifying Safety After Move L to (4,4)\n\nAfter moving to (4,4), the snake's new positions would be:\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Body: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n- Tail: (5,1) moves away (since the snake didn't eat, length stays the same, tail moves forward).\n\nNext possible moves from (4,4):\n- Current direction would be L (since we moved left).\n- Cannot move R (reverse).\n- Possible moves: U, D, L.\n  - U to (4,5): reaches food (4,5), which is positive, and no collision.\n  - D to (4,3): safe but not towards food.\n  - L to (3,4): safe but not towards food.\n\nSo, moving L now allows us to move U next to eat the food safely.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to position the snake to reach the positive food at (4,5) in the next move.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - Internal obstacle: (6, 4) is also a wall.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (4, 4), then (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2).\n   - Current direction: Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6, 6): value=1, life_span=1\n   - (4, 5): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (3, 1): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (L). From the rules, we cannot instantly reverse direction, so we cannot move Right (R) next. Therefore, possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), or continue Left (L).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) - (x-1, y)\n- Current head: (4, 4)\n- New head position: (3, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (3,4) is not a wall (not in the wall list).\n  - Body: Snake body segments are at (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). (3,4) is not in these.\n- Food at (3,4)? No, no food there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) - (x, y+1)\n- New head position: (4, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,5) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (4,5) is not in [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2)].\n- Food at (4,5)? Yes, value=7, life_span=1.\n  - Can we eat it? \n    - The food is under the snake's body? No, the snake's body is at (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). (4,5) is not under the body.\n    - Tail reward danger: The tail is at (5,2). Is (4,5) adjacent to (5,2)? \n      - Distance: |4-5| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4. Adjacent means distance=1, so no.\n    - So, safe to eat.\n- Outcome: Eat positive food (+7), length increases by 1.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) - (x, y-1)\n- New head position: (4, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,3) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (4,3) is not in [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2)].\n- Food at (4,3)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nLooking at the food:\n1. (6,6): value=1, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (4,4): |6-4| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4 (Manhattan distance)\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n2. (4,5): value=7, life_span=1\n   - Reachable by moving Up.\n3. (3,1): value=10, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |3-4| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\nThe only food we can reach immediately is at (4,5) by moving Up, with a high value of 7.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Moving Up to (4,5) to eat the food:\n  - After eating, the snake grows by 1. The new tail will be where the current tail is after moving, which is (5,2) moves to (5,3) (since the body moves forward).\n  - New snake positions: [(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)]? Wait, no. Original body is (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). After moving head to (4,5), the body shifts: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), and tail (5,2) is removed unless we eat. But since we eat, tail stays, so new body is (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and a new segment is added where the head was before moving, which is (4,4), but that's already the first body segment. Hmm, need to clarify snake growth:\n    - Normally, when snake eats, the tail doesn't move, so length increases by 1.\n    - Original: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (5,2).\n    - Move head to (4,5), body becomes (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), and tail (5,2) stays because we ate, so new segment is added where the head was before moving, which is (4,4), but that's already the first body segment. This seems confusing.\n    - Maybe better to think: after moving head to (4,5), body is (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), and since we ate, tail (5,2) is not removed, so new body is (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), making length 5.\n    - So no immediate collision from growth.\n  - No tail reward danger as previously checked.\n  - No walls or body collision at (4,5).\n  \n- Other moves (Left or Down) don't eat food, so less beneficial unless avoiding danger, but no immediate danger in moving Up.\n\n### Checking Other Moves for Safety\n\n- Left to (3,4): safe, no food.\n- Down to (4,3): safe, no food.\nBut moving Up gives a high reward of +7, which is better than no reward.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nAll foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. So if we don't eat (4,5) now, it's gone next turn.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to (4,5) to eat the high-value food (+7) before it disappears, and this move is safe based on collision checks.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (6, 4).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body segments are at [(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)]. The head is at (4,5), and the tail is at (5,2).\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving \"U\" (Up), meaning the last move was upwards.\n4. **Food**:\n   - Only one piece of food is present at (3,1) with a value of 10 and a life span of 1. This means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Since the last move was \"U\" (Up), the snake cannot move \"D\" (Down) in the next turn. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n- **Wall and Body Collisions**: The snake cannot move into walls or its own body (except the tail under certain conditions).\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (4,5)\n\nGiven the head is at (4,5) and moving \"U\", let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (4,6)\n   - Check borders: y=6 is within bounds (since y=7 is a wall).\n   - Check internal walls: (4,6) is not an internal wall.\n   - Check body: The snake's body segments are at (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). (4,6) is not in this list.\n   - **Valid Move**.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (3,5)\n   - Check borders: x=3 is within bounds.\n   - Check internal walls: (3,5) is not an internal wall.\n   - Check body: (3,5) is not in the body segments.\n   - **Valid Move**.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (5,5)\n   - Check borders: x=5 is within bounds.\n   - Check internal walls: (5,5) is not an internal wall.\n   - Check body: (5,5) is not in the body segments.\n   - **Valid Move**.\n\nDown is not allowed because it's the reverse of the current direction \"U\".\n\n### Food Consideration\n\nThere's food at (3,1) with value 10 and life span 1. It's positive food (+1 score, length +1). \n\n- **Distance to Food**: The head is at (4,5), food is at (3,1). The Manhattan distance is |4-3| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5. It's quite far, and the food will disappear after this turn (life span 1, and it's the current turn). So, it's impossible to reach the food this turn.\n  \nSince the food is unreachable this turn, we don't need to consider it for the immediate move.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" occurs if:\n- The head is adjacent to the tail, and\n- The tail cell has positive food, and\n- The head moves to eat that food.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (5,2).\n- Head is at (4,5). The distance is |4-5| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4, which is not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1).\n- So, no immediate danger here.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince the food is unreachable, the primary goal is to avoid collisions and stay alive while positioning the snake for future food collection. Let's evaluate the valid moves:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (4,6)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (4,6) would be U (to (4,7) - but y=7 is a wall, so invalid), L (to (3,6)), R (to (5,6)).\n   - Moving up brings the head closer to the top wall, limiting future moves.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (3,5)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3,5) would be U (to (3,6)), D (to (3,4) - but current direction is U, so D is reverse and not allowed unless we change direction now), L (to (2,5)).\n   - Moves the head left, away from the right side where the internal wall is.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (5,5)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (5,5) would be U (to (5,6)), D (to (5,4) - but (5,4) is a body segment, so invalid), R (to (6,5)).\n   - Moving right towards the internal wall at (6,4), which might limit future moves.\n\n**Safety Check**:\n- Moving Up: Safe, but limits space.\n- Moving Left: Safe, opens more space.\n- Moving Right: Safe but towards the internal wall.\n\n**Optimal Choice**: Moving Left seems better as it opens more space and doesn't corner the snake.\n\n### Verifying Body Collision After Move\n\nAfter moving Left to (3,5), the new snake positions would be:\n- Head: (3,5)\n- Body: [(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)]\n- Tail: (5,2) moves away, so (5,2) is no longer part of the body.\n\nCheck if (3,5) collides with any body part:\n- (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3) - none are (3,5). So, no collision.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Food is unreachable.\n- Moving Left is safe and provides more maneuvering space.\n- No immediate dangers or collisions.\n\n**Action**: Move Left (L).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 12\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n   - Internal obstacle at (6, 4).\n3. **Snake Positions**: \n   - Head: (3, 5)\n   - Body segments: (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)\n   - So, the snake is 5 segments long.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L). This means the last move was from (4,5) to (3,5).\n5. **Food**:\n   - Only one food item: at (3, 1) with value = 1 (positive food) and life_span = 9.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head: (3,5)\n  - Next: (4,5) - right of head\n  - Then: (4,4) - below (4,5)\n  - Then: (5,4) - right of (4,4)\n  - Tail: (5,3) - below (5,4)\n\n- Food: (3,1) - same column as head, 4 rows below (since y decreases as we go down).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (L). The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R), but with constraints:\n\n1. **No instant reverse**: Cannot move Right (R) because that would be the opposite of Left (L).\n   - So, cannot move R.\n   - Possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's see where each possible move would take the head:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (3, 6)\n   - Check for walls: y=7 is wall, y=6 is not a border wall yet.\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - Snake body segments: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)\n     - (3,6) is not in the body.\n   - So, U is safe.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (3, 4)\n   - Check walls: y=0 is wall, y=4 is not.\n   - Check body collision:\n     - Body segments: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)\n     - (3,4) is not in the body.\n   - So, D is safe.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (2, 5)\n   - Check walls: x=0 is wall, x=2 is not.\n   - Check body collision:\n     - (2,5) is not in the body.\n   - So, L is safe.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nThere's only one food at (3,1), which is positive (value=1). It's currently at (3,1), and our head is at (3,5). \n\nTo reach the food:\n- Need to move down multiple times: from (3,5) to (3,4) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1).\n- But we're deciding only the immediate next move at t=12.\n\nCurrently, the food is not adjacent to the head, so no immediate eating possibility in this move.\n\n### Potential Future Moves Towards Food\n\nIf we want to head towards the food at (3,1), moving Down (D) would be the direct path. \n\nBut we should also consider if moving Down now could lead to any immediate dangers in future moves.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrently:\n- Tail is at (5,3).\n- Head is at (3,5).\n- Distance between head and tail: |3-5| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4 (not adjacent).\nSo, no immediate tail reward danger.\n\n### Checking Other Risks\n\nAre there any immediate risks in moving U, D, or L?\n\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,6):\n  - Next possible moves from (3,6): Can't go D (reverse), so U, L, R.\n  - Walls: y=7 is above, so next move U would hit wall.\n  - Not immediately dangerous, but limits future options.\n\n- Moving Down (D) to (3,4):\n  - Gets us closer to food at (3,1).\n  - Next moves: Can't go U (reverse), so D, L, R.\n  - Seems safe.\n\n- Moving Left (L) to (2,5):\n  - Next moves: Can't go R (reverse), so U, D, L.\n  - Moves away from food, but no immediate danger.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven that the food is at (3,1), moving Down (D) seems the most direct path towards it without immediate risks.\n\nOther options:\n- Up (U): Moves away from food, limits future moves.\n- Left (L): Moves away from food, not beneficial unless avoiding something, which we're not here.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food to Eat\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the head that we can eat now?\n- Head at (3,5).\n- Adjacent cells:\n  - U: (3,6) - no food.\n  - D: (3,4) - no food.\n  - L: (2,5) - no food.\n  - R: (4,5) - body segment, not food.\nSo, no immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) towards the positive food at (3,1), as it's the most direct path without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n   - Internal Obstacle: (6, 4) is a wall.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (3, 4), followed by (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4).\n   - Current Direction: Down (D).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (3, 1): value = 8, life_span = 1.\n   - (3, 5): value = 10, life_span = 1.\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Down (D). From the rules, we cannot make an instant reverse, so we cannot move Up (U) next. Therefore, possible moves are Left (L), Right (R), or continue Down (D).\n\nLet's explore each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) from (3,4) to (3,3)\n- New head position: (3, 3).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (3,3) is not a wall (x=3, y=3 is within bounds and not an internal wall).\n  - Body: The body segments are at (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4). (3,3) is not in this list.\n- Food at new head position: No food at (3,3).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) from (3,4) to (2,4)\n- New head position: (2, 4).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (2,4) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (2,4) is not in the body segments.\n- Food at new head position: No food at (2,4).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) from (3,4) to (4,4)\n- New head position: (4, 4).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,4) is not a wall.\n  - Body: The body segments are at (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4). (4,4) is the fourth segment (tail is at (5,4), so (4,4) is the segment before the tail).\n   - Wait, is (4,4) part of the body? Yes, it's the fourth segment in the list.\n   - But the tail is at (5,4), which will move forward when the head moves, so normally moving into the tail's current position is safe because the tail moves away. But here, we're moving into (4,4), which is not the tail.\n   - Moving into any body segment other than the tail is a collision.\n- Therefore, moving to (4,4) would collide with the body.\n- Outcome: Deadly collision, cannot choose this.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n\n1. **Food at (3,1)**:\n   - Value: 8 (positive).\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n   - Current distance from head (3,4) to (3,1): 3 units down (from y=4 to y=1).\n   - Cannot reach it in one move; would need multiple moves down.\n\n2. **Food at (3,5)**:\n   - Value: 10 (positive).\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n   - Current position: (3,5) is the second segment of the snake's body.\n   - From the rules: Food can be under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n     1. The body moves away.\n     2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n   - Currently, the head is at (3,4), moving Down to (3,3) would move the body segments:\n     - New body: head at (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4). The tail (5,4) is removed, new tail is (4,4).\n     - The food at (3,5) is now at the third segment (from head: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)).\n     - To eat it, we'd need to move the head to (3,5) next, but that would require moving Up from (3,3), but the current move is Down to (3,3), next move could be Up, but:\n       - After moving Down to (3,3), next move Up to (3,4), then Up to (3,5).\n       - But the food's life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn (turn 13). So we cannot eat it in time.\n   - Alternatively, if we move Left or Right now, the food at (3,5) is under the body and we can't eat it immediately.\n   - Also, from the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n     - Here, tail is at (5,4), head at (3,4), not adjacent (adjacent would be (4,4), (5,3), (5,5)), so not a concern here.\n   - Conclusion: Cannot eat (3,5) this turn, and it will disappear next turn.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving Right leads to a collision.\n- Moving Down is safe but doesn't eat food.\n- Moving Left is safe but doesn't eat food.\n- The positive food at (3,1) is too far to reach this turn.\n- The positive food at (3,5) is under the body and cannot be eaten this turn (life span 1, will disappear).\n\nBetween Down and Left, both are safe. Which is better?\n\nLooking ahead:\n- After moving Down to (3,3), next moves could aim for (3,1), but that's two moves down, and the food at (3,1) has life span 8, so it will stay for a while.\n- After moving Left to (2,4), we're closer to the left wall, limiting future options.\n\nMoving Down seems slightly better as it keeps more options open for future moves towards the food at (3,1).\n\n### Final Decision\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn (t₀)**: 14\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - Internal obstacle: (6, 4)\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (3, 3)\n   - Body segments: (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)\n   - So the full snake is: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)\n   - This means the snake was moving Down in the previous move.\n5. **Food**:\n   - (3, 1): value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - (3, 5): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head at (3,3)\n  - Next segment at (3,4)\n  - Then (3,5)\n  - Then (4,5)\n  - Then (4,4)\n  \n  So the snake looks like this (H for head, B for body):\n\n  ```\n  ... (4,4) is the tail\n  |\n  (3,3) H\n  (3,4) B\n  (3,5) B\n  (4,5) B\n  (4,4) B (tail)\n  ```\n\n- Food:\n  - (3,1): positive food (value=7)\n  - (3,5): positive food (value=9), but this is currently under the snake's body at (3,5)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Down (D), we cannot instantly reverse to Up (U) next turn. So possible moves are D, L, R.\n\nBut let's check each direction for validity:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (x, y-1)\n   - Current head: (3,3)\n   - Next position: (3,2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is a wall, but (3,2) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Is (3,2) in the snake's body? No, body is at (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4).\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (x-1, y)\n   - Next position: (2,3)\n   - Check:\n     - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (2,3) is not.\n     - Body: Is (2,3) in the body? No.\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (x+1, y)\n   - Next position: (4,3)\n   - Check:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a wall, but (4,3) is not.\n     - Body: Is (4,3) in the body? No.\n   - Valid move.\n\nSo possible actions: D, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see where the food is and if we can eat it:\n\n1. Food at (3,1):\n   - Value: +7 (positive)\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Currently not under the snake's body.\n   - To eat it, we need to move the head to (3,1).\n   - Current head is at (3,3). To reach (3,1), we need to move Down twice (from (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1)).\n   - But life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. So we cannot eat it this turn; it's impossible to reach in one move from (3,3).\n\n2. Food at (3,5):\n   - Value: +9 (positive)\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Currently under the snake's body at (3,5).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The body must move away from (3,5), and then the head must move onto (3,5).\n     - Currently, the body at (3,5) is the third segment. The tail is at (4,4).\n     - If the snake moves such that the tail moves away from (4,4), but the body at (3,5) is not the tail, so moving won't immediately free (3,5).\n     - Actually, to free (3,5), the segment after it (which is (4,5)) must move, but that's not the tail.\n     - It seems complicated to free (3,5) in one move to eat it this turn. Probably not possible.\n\nGiven that, neither food can be eaten this turn because their life spans are 1 and we can't reach them in one move.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Our tail is at (4,4).\n- Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n  - Head at (3,3), tail at (4,4).\n  - Adjacent means one coordinate is the same and the other differs by 1, or both differ by 1 (diagonal).\n  - (3,3) and (4,4): both x and y differ by 1, so diagonal adjacency.\n  - But the rule might imply only orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right), not diagonal. Need to clarify.\n  - Assuming orthogonal adjacency: (3,3) is adjacent to (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), (4,3). Not (4,4).\n  - So no adjacency to tail in orthogonal sense.\n  - Therefore, no tail reward danger currently.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince we can't eat any food this turn, our goal is to move to a safe position that allows future food collection.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Down (D) to (3,2)**:\n   - Next head position: (3,2)\n   - Future options from (3,2):\n     - Can go Left to (2,2), Right to (4,2), or Down to (3,1) (but (3,1) has food that will be gone next turn).\n   - Not near any immediate dangers.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (2,3)**:\n   - Next head position: (2,3)\n   - Future options: Up to (2,4), Down to (2,2), Left to (1,3) (but x=0 is wall, so Left would be to (1,3)).\n   - Not near any immediate dangers.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4,3)**:\n   - Next head position: (4,3)\n   - Future options: Up to (4,4) (tail is at (4,4), but tail will move), Down to (4,2), Right to (5,3).\n   - Moving Right towards the internal obstacle at (6,4), but not immediately problematic.\n\nAll moves seem safe. Now, let's think about future food opportunities. Currently, no food is reachable this turn, but next turn new food may spawn. \n\nLooking at the current food:\n- (3,1) will disappear next turn, so not useful.\n- (3,5) is under body and will disappear, so not useful.\n\nNo immediate gain from moving towards current food.\n\nPerhaps we should choose a move that keeps the snake in a position where it can explore more of the board. Moving Down to (3,2) seems okay, but it's moving towards the bottom wall (y=0). Moving Left or Right keeps more options open.\n\nBetween Left and Right:\n- Left to (2,3): more space to the left side.\n- Right to (4,3): closer to the internal obstacle at (6,4), but not immediately problematic.\n\nMaybe Left is slightly better to explore more space.\n\nBut also, the snake's body is currently making a sort of \"U\" shape:\n- From head (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5) to (4,5) to (4,4).\nMoving Left would keep the snake more compact, while moving Right might stretch it further.\n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (3,2) would start moving away from the body.\n\nGiven that all moves are safe and no food is immediately accessible, any of D, L, R is fine. Maybe Down is slightly better to start moving away from the current body positions.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nLet me double-check if any move leads to immediate danger next turn:\n\n1. **Down to (3,2)**:\n   - Next head\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to visualize the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7 (left and right borders), y=0, y=7 (bottom and top borders).\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (6, 4) — a single wall inside the grid at this coordinate.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (3, 2), followed by body segments at (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), and tail at (4, 5).\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving **Down (D)**. This means the last move was from (3, 3) to (3, 2), so the previous direction was Down.\n4. **Food**:\n   - **Positive Food at (3, 1)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 6.\n   - **Positive Food at (3, 5)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 8.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's sketch a rough representation (top-left is (0,0), x increases to the right, y increases downward):\n\n```\ny=7: -----------------\n...\ny=5: ... S S ... (food at (3,5) is under the snake's body segment)\ny=4: ... S   ...\ny=3: ... S   ...\ny=2: H S ...   ... (H is head at (3,2))\ny=1: F ...   ... (F is food at (3,1))\ny=0: -----------------\n     x=0 ... x=7\n```\n\n- The snake's head is at (3,2), moving Down (from (3,3) to (3,2)).\n- The body segments are at (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and the tail is at (4,5).\n- There's food at (3,1) (below the head) and (3,5) (under a body segment).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current head direction is **Down (D)**, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Down (D)**: From (3,2) to (3,1).\n   - Checks:\n     - Is (3,1) a wall? No.\n     - Is (3,1) occupied by the snake's body? No.\n     - Is there food at (3,1)? Yes (value +1).\n     - Would eating this food cause a collision?\n       - Current length is 5 (positions: head + 4 body segments).\n       - After eating, length becomes 6. The new tail would be at (4,5) (since the tail moves forward).\n       - The head moves to (3,1), new body segments: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n       - Next turn, the tail moves from (4,5), so the new tail is at (3,5) or depends on the previous tail movement. Wait, the tail is at (4,5), and the segment before is (3,5). After moving, the tail would be at (3,5), and the head is at (3,1). No immediate collision.\n     - **No collision risk**, safe to eat.\n2. **Turn Left (L)**: From (3,2) to (2,2).\n   - Checks:\n     - Is (2,2) a wall? No.\n     - Is (2,2) occupied by the snake's body? No.\n     - Is there food at (2,2)? No.\n     - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n3. **Turn Right (R)**: From (3,2) to (4,2).\n   - Checks:\n     - Is (4,2) a wall? No.\n     - Is (4,2) occupied by the snake's body? No.\n     - Is there food at (4,2)? No.\n     - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n4. **Turn Up (U)**: From (3,2) to (3,3).\n   - Checks:\n     - Is (3,3) a wall? No.\n     - Is (3,3) occupied by the snake's body? Yes (second segment).\n     - Moving into the body is deadly unless it's the tail that will move away.\n     - Here, (3,3) is not the tail (tail is at (4,5)), so it's a body collision.\n     - **Deadly move**, cannot choose Up.\n\n### Evaluating Food at (3,5)\n\nThe food at (3,5) is currently under the snake's body segment. To eat it:\n- The body must move away from (3,5), and then the head must move onto it.\n- Currently, the head is at (3,2), so it's not adjacent to (3,5).\n- Even if we move towards it, we can't eat it immediately because the body is still on it.\n- Therefore, it's not an immediate option for eating.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states:\n> If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (4,5).\n- Head is at (3,2), which is not adjacent to (4,5) (adjacent would be (3,5), (4,4), (4,6), (5,5)).\n- So, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven the options:\n1. **Down (D)**: Move to (3,1), eat positive food (+1), safe.\n   - Pros: Immediate reward, safe.\n   - Cons: None.\n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (2,2), no reward.\n   - Pros: Keeps options open.\n   - Cons: No immediate gain.\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (4,2), no reward.\n   - Similar to Left.\n4. **Up (U)**: Deadly, cannot choose.\n\nBetween Down, Left, and Right, Down is the most advantageous as it gives an immediate +1 reward without any risk.\n\n### Verifying Down Move\n\nLet's simulate the Down move:\n- Current head: (3,2), direction D.\n- Move to (3,1):\n  - Food at (3,1): eat it.\n  - New length: 6.\n  - New positions: head at (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n  - Next turn, tail moves from (4,5). The segment before is (3,5), so tail moves to (3,5).\n  - No collision between head at (3,1) and any body segment.\n\n### Checking Immediate Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is D (from (3,3) to (3,2)).\nNext move cannot be U (opposite of D), but we're not choosing U anyway, so no issue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to eat the positive food at (3,1), which is safe and beneficial.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

This means the snake cannot move outside the grid (i.e., cannot have x < 0, x > 7, y < 0, or y > 7).\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (6, 4), which the snake cannot pass through.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body segments are at [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)].\n     - **Head**: (3,1) - This is the first element in the list.\n     - **Tail**: (4,5) - This is the last element in the list.\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving **Down (D)**. This means in the previous move, the head moved from (3,2) to (3,1).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are two food items:\n     - **Food 1**: Position (3,5), value = +1, life span = 7 turns.\n     - **Food 2**: Position (3,6), value = +1, life span = 10 turns.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body and the food positions to better understand the scenario.\n\n- **Snake Body**:\n  - Head: (3,1)\n  - Body: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n  - Tail: (4,5)\n  \n  So, the snake is mostly vertical from (3,1) to (3,5) and then makes a right turn to (4,5).\n\n- **Food Positions**:\n  - (3,5): This is currently occupied by the snake's body (the segment before the tail).\n  - (3,6): This is below the (3,5) segment, which is also part of the snake's body (since the snake goes up to (3,5) and then to (4,5)).\n\nWait a minute, this seems confusing. If the snake's positions are [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)], then:\n\n- (3,5) is the second-to-last segment.\n- (4,5) is the tail.\n\nSo, the food at (3,5) is under the snake's body (specifically, the segment at (3,5)), and the food at (3,6) is just below (3,5), which is not currently occupied by the snake.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: The current direction is Down (D), so the snake cannot move Up (U) next, as that would be the reverse direction.\n   - Allowed moves: Down (D), Left (L), Right (R).\n\n2. **Wall and Body Collisions**:\n   - **Down (D)**: (3,1) -> (3,0). But y=0 is a border wall, so this is invalid.\n   - **Left (L)**: (3,1) -> (2,1). Need to check:\n     - Is (2,1) a wall? No walls at (2,1) except borders (x=0,7 or y=0,7), and x=2 is not a border.\n     - Is (2,1) part of the snake's body? The body segments are at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). (2,1) is not in this list, so it's safe.\n   - **Right (R)**: (3,1) -> (4,1). Need to check:\n     - Is (4,1) a wall? No.\n     - Is (4,1) part of the snake's body? No, body is at higher y-values or at (4,5). So safe.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: Left (L) or Right (R). Down (D) is invalid due to wall, and Up (U) is invalid due to no instant reverse.\n\n### Evaluating Food Consumption\n\nNow, let's see if moving Left or Right can lead to eating food in the near future.\n\n1. **Food at (3,5)**:\n   - Currently under the snake's body at (3,5).\n   - To eat this, the snake must:\n     - Move the body away from (3,5), then move the head onto (3,5).\n   - Currently, the head is at (3,1), far from (3,5). It would take several moves to reach there, and the food's life span is 7 turns.\n   - Not immediately relevant for the next move.\n\n2. **Food at (3,6)**:\n   - Position (3,6) is just below (3,5).\n   - Currently, the tail is at (4,5), and the segment before tail is at (3,5).\n   - To eat (3,6), the snake would need to move its head to (3,6) after moving the body away.\n   - Currently, the head is at (3,1). To reach (3,6), the snake would need to move down several steps.\n   - However, moving down now is not possible (would hit wall at (3,0)).\n   - Also, the tail is at (4,5), so moving the head to (3,6) would require the tail to move away first, which isn't immediate.\n\nGiven this, neither food is immediately accessible in the next move. So, the immediate goal is to avoid collisions and position the snake for future food collection.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule called \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n  \nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (4,5).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6).\n- Head is at (3,1), which is not adjacent to the tail (distance is |3-4| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5, not adjacent).\n- So, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Deciding Between Left (L) and Right (R)\n\nNow, let's decide between moving Left to (2,1) or Right to (4,1).\n\n**Option 1: Left (L) to (2,1)**\n- New head position: (2,1).\n- Body segments will follow: new body will be [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)].\n- Tail was at (4,5), which will now be gone, and the new tail is (3,5).\n- This moves the snake towards the left side of the grid.\n- No immediate food in this direction.\n\n**Option 2: Right (R) to (4,1)**\n- New head position: (4,1).\n- Body segments: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)].\n- New tail is (3,5).\n- This moves the snake towards the right side of the grid.\n- No immediate food here either.\n\nBoth moves seem safe. Now, let's think about future possibilities:\n\n- Moving Left (L) to (2,1):\n  - Next moves could be Left again to (1,1), or Down to (2,0) (invalid, wall), or Up to (2,2).\n  - Up to (2,2) would be possible, then can continue upwards or right.\n\n- Moving Right (R) to (4,1):\n  - Next moves could be Right to (5,1), or Down to (4,0) (invalid), or Up to (4,2).\n  - Up to (4,2) seems reasonable, then can continue.\n\nNeither seems significantly better than the other in terms of immediate gains. However, moving Right might be slightly better because:\n\n- The internal obstacle is at (6,4), which is on the right side but higher up. Moving right now doesn't immediately confront that.\n- Moving left takes us towards the left wall (x=0), which might limit future movement sooner.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Threats\n\nLet's ensure that neither move leads to a dead end or immediate danger in the next steps.\n\n- After Left to (2,1):\n  - Next move Up to (2,2): Then can go Left to (1,2) (wall at x=0), Right to (3,2) (body at (3,1) which is behind), or Up to (2,3).\n  - Seems manageable.\n\n-\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",
