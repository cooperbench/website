        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6). The snake is just a single segment at (3,3), so it's only the head. The head is currently moving left, so direction is L.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (3,5) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (2,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1. Life span is 10, meaning they disappear after 10 turns, including this one, so they'll be gone by turn 10 if not eaten.\n\nSince the snake is only one segment, eating food will make it grow. Also, because it's alone, there's no body to collide with except itself, but since it's just one cell, moving onto itself isn't possible yet. The tail collision rule might not apply until it grows.\n\nThe snake positions are given as [(3,3)], so head is at (3,3), and since it's the only segment, it's also the tail.\n\nHead direction is L, so it's moving left. That means from (3,3), moving left would go to (2,3).\n\nPossible moves: I can go U (up), D (down), L (left), or R (right). But since current direction is L, I cannot instantly reverse to R on this turn. The rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Since this is turn 0, and I'm choosing the action for turn 0, I think I need to choose a direction that isn't opposite to the current one if it were moving, but at turn 0, it's stationary? No, it has a direction, so I should respect that.\n\nThe head direction is given as L, so I think it was moving left to get to (3,3), but since it's the start, maybe it's just the initial direction. I should assume that for the next move, I can choose any direction except the opposite, which is R.\n\nLet me read: \"Snake Head Direction: L\" and \"Current Turn: t1=0\". So on turn 0, the snake is at (3,3) with direction L. Now, I need to choose an action for turn 0.\n\nThe action I choose will move the snake to a new position on turn 0. Since it's a turn-based game, each turn I move one step.\n\nIn the state, snake positions are given for turn 0, so at the start of turn 0, it's at (3,3). Then I choose an action, and after moving, it's at a new position.\n\nSimilarly, food life span decreases each turn, including current.\n\nFor turn 0, I need to choose where to move.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3):\n\n- Up: (3,4)\n\n- Down: (3,2)\n\n- Left: (2,3)  // since direction is L, this is forward\n\n- Right: (4,3)  // but this is opposite to current direction, so I cannot choose Right because of no instant reverse rule.\n\nThe rule says: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So for turn 0, since current direction is L, I cannot choose R for turn 0.\n\nTherefore, possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nL is in the same direction, U and D are perpendicular.\n\nNow, let's see the grid boundaries. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So grid is from x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7, but walls are at those lines, meaning I cannot go to cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Similarly, internal obstacle at (4,6), so I cannot go there.\n\nSince the snake is at (3,3), let's see what cells are valid:\n\n- Up: (3,4) - y=4, which is between 0 and 7, and not a wall cell. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=4 is fine. x=3 is between 0 and 7.\n\nSimilarly, down: (3,2) - y=2, fine.\n\nLeft: (2,3) - x=2, fine.\n\nRight: (4,3) - but cannot because of reverse rule, and also, it might be valid, but I can't go there now.\n\n(4,3) is not a wall, since walls are at x=0,7, y=0,7, and (4,6) is obstacle, but (4,3) is fine.\n\nBut I can't go right because of direction.\n\nSo for turn 0, actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (1,2) value 1, life 10\n\n- (3,5) value 1, life 10\n\n- (2,2) value 1, life 10\n\n(1,2) is at x=1,y=2\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5\n\n(2,2) is at x=2,y=2\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go:\n\n- U to (3,4): not food\n\n- D to (3,2): not food, but (3,2) is empty? Food is at (1,2), (3,5), (2,2). (3,2) has no food, I think.\n\n- L to (2,3): not food\n\nNone of the adjacent cells have food directly. (2,2) is food, but from (3,3), moving to (2,3) or (3,2) doesn't reach (2,2). (2,2) is diagonally adjacent, but I can only move orthogonally, not diagonally.\n\nSo no food immediately adjacent.\n\nI need to think about the path to food.\n\nSince the snake is short, I should aim to eat food to grow, but prioritize long-term survival.\n\nThink 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under snake, but here, snake is at (3,3), and food is elsewhere, so no issue.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\nBorder cells are walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls. But the corners are included.\n\nFor movement, I can only be on cells where 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <= 6, I think? Let's see.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x must be from 1 to 6 inclusive? For example, (1,1) should be playable, (6,6), etc.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake at (3,3).\n\nFood at (1,2), (3,5), (2,2).\n\n(3,5) is directly above, but from (3,3), up is (3,4), then (3,5) is two steps up.\n\n(2,2) is down-left, so I need to go left to (2,3) then down to (2,2), or down to (3,2) then left to (2,2).\n\n(1,2) is further left.\n\nAll food has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to think about the path and potential dead ends or risks.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can go towards food, but must avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so I need to consider body collisions later.\n\nBut for now, no body.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves for turn 0.\n\nActions: U, D, L (R not allowed)\n\nIf I go L to (2,3): then at (2,3), direction would be L if I choose L, or if I choose U or D, direction changes.\n\nAfter moving, the head direction updates to the direction I moved.\n\nSo if I move L, new head direction is L.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, from (2,3), I can go to food at (2,2) by moving down, or to (1,2) by moving left.\n\n(2,2) is food, so if I go to (2,2), I eat it.\n\nBut let's plan multiple turns.\n\nI need to output actions for several turns, but the answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1=0 for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions for those turns.\n\nLook at answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nAnd t1=0, so I need to output actions for turn 0, turn 1, turn 2, etc., for at least 5 turns? But it doesn't specify how many, but since I need to think ahead, I should provide a sequence.\n\nBut the food might be eaten or disappear, so I need to simulate.\n\nPerhaps I should decide the first move and then plan accordingly.\n\nSince the snake is small, I can go for the nearest food.\n\nDistances:\n\nTo (2,2): from (3,3), I can go down to (3,2) then left to (2,2), or left to (2,3) then down to (2,2). Both are 2 steps.\n\nTo (3,5): up to (3,4) then (3,5), 2 steps.\n\nTo (1,2): from (3,3), need to go left twice then down, or down then left twice, etc., at least 3 steps.\n\n(1,2) is at x=1,y=2, from (3,3), delta x=2, delta y=1, so min steps 3, e.g., left, left, down or down, left, left, etc.\n\nBut (2,2) is closer.\n\n(2,2) and (3,5) are both 2 steps away.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), (3,5) at (3,5).\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,2), which is near (2,2).\n\nI should consider the area.\n\nSince the snake is only one segment, after eating one food, it becomes two segments, and so on.\n\nBut I need to avoid the tail reward danger, but for now, tail is the head itself, so if I eat food at tail, it might be dangerous, but let's see the rule.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,3), and if there were food under tail, but there isn't, and after moving, tail moves.\n\nWhen I eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nBut for now, no food under tail.\n\nSo for turn 0, I need to choose a direction.\n\nLet me consider going towards (2,2) or (3,5).\n\nFirst, suppose I go left to (2,3) on turn 0.\n\nThen at (2,3), now head direction is L.\n\nFood at (2,2) is below, so I can go down to (2,2) on turn 1.\n\nThen, at (2,2), I eat the food, since it's positive, length becomes 2, and new tail is at the previous position, which is (2,3)? Let's think.\n\nInitial: turn 0 start, snake at [(3,3)]\n\nI move left to (2,3), so after move, snake positions: head at (2,3), tail was (3,3) but since no growth, tail moves? When no food eaten, snake moves, head to new position, tail removed.\n\nStandard snake: when no food, move to new cell, head added, tail removed. When food eaten, head added, tail not removed, so length increases.\n\nHere, at turn 0, I move to a new cell. If that cell has food, I eat it, else not.\n\nIn this case, from (3,3) move to, say, (2,3). Is there food at (2,3)? Food is at (1,2), (3,5), (2,2), not at (2,3), so no food eaten. Snake now at [(2,3)] only? But it was one segment, moved to new position, so still one segment at (2,3).\n\nPositions: start at [(3,3)], after moving to (2,3), snake is now [(2,3)], since only head.\n\nThen on turn 1, from (2,3), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3) but R is opposite to current direction L? Current direction after turn 0 is L, since I moved left.\n\nAfter moving to (2,3), head direction is L.\n\nSo for turn 1, I cannot move right to (3,3) because that's opposite.\n\nSo possible: U, D, L.\n\n(2,2) has food, so I can go D to (2,2), and eat it.\n\nThen after eating, snake grows: head at (2,2), and tail is the previous position, which is (2,3)? Let's sequence.\n\nAt turn 1 start: snake at [(2,3)]\n\nI move D to (2,2). Since (2,2) has food, I eat it, so head moves to (2,2), and tail does not move, so snake becomes [(2,2), (2,3)] with head at (2,2) and tail at (2,3).\n\nLength 2.\n\nDirection after move is D.\n\nNow, food at (2,2) is eaten, so removed.\n\nRemaining food: (1,2) and (3,5), both with life span decreasing.\n\nLife span was 10 at turn 0, so at turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0, it decreases to 9, and so on.\n\nBut since I ate (2,2) on turn 1, it's gone.\n\nNow, from (2,2), head direction D, I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3) - but that's the tail position, but in snake, moving to tail is allowed because the tail will move away, but only if it's the very end and it moves.\n\nRule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nHere, tail is at (2,3), and I can move up to (2,3), because when I move, the tail will move to the next position, but in this case, when I move head to (2,3), which is current tail, and since I eat no food, the tail should move, but the head is moving to the tail position.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIf I move head to a cell occupied by the tail, and no food, then after move, head is at that cell, and tail moves to its next, so the cell is free, no collision.\n\nOnly if I move to a body segment that is not the tail, it collides.\n\nIn this case, from (2,2), moving U to (2,3) is allowed, and since tail is at (2,3), after move, head at (2,3), tail at (2,2)? Positions: before move, snake [(2,2), (2,3)] head at (2,2), tail at (2,3).\n\nI move head to (2,3). But (2,3) is occupied by tail.\n\nSince no food eaten, head moves to (2,3), and tail is removed, so the new snake is head at (2,3), and the body was (2,2) to (2,3), but after removing tail and adding head at (2,3), it becomes just [(2,3)]? No.\n\nStandard: the body segments follow the head.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, the segment that was head becomes body, and the tail segment is removed if no growth.\n\nHere, snake: segments [head, body] = [(2,2), (2,3)] with (2,2) head, (2,3) tail.\n\nI move head to (2,3). Since (2,3) is the current tail position, and I move there, no food, so after move, the new head is at (2,3), and the previous head (2,2) becomes body, and the tail (2,3) is removed. So new snake is just [(2,3)] with head at (2,3), and the cell (2,2) is empty.\n\nNo collision because the tail was there but moved away.\n\nIf I had moved to a body segment not tail, it would collide.\n\nBut here, moving to tail is ok.\n\nSimilarly, I can move to other directions.\n\nFrom (2,2) with direction D, possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,3) - tail, ok\n\n- D to (2,1) - down, but y=1, is it wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is not wall, fine.\n\n- L to (1,2) - which has food\n\n- R to (3,2) - right, but current direction D, R is not opposite, opposite to D would be U, I think.\n\nDirections: U and D are vertical, L and R horizontal, so opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up).\n\nSo I cannot move U, but moving L, R, or D are allowed.\n\nL and R are perpendicular, not opposite.\n\nOpposite means directly reverse.\n\nSo from direction D, opposite is U.\n\nSo I can move D, L, or R.\n\nCannot move U.\n\nIn this case, from (2,2) dir D, I can go:\n\n- D to (2,1)\n\n- L to (1,2)  // food\n\n- R to (3,2)\n\nIf I go L to (1,2), I eat the food there.\n\nThen snake grows: head to (1,2), tail stays, so snake becomes [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: snake at [(2,2), (2,3)] with head (2,2)\n\nMove to (1,2), which has food, so eat, head to (1,2), tail not removed, so new positions: body was (2,2) becomes body, (2,3) is tail, add head (1,2), so [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] with head (1,2), tail (2,3).\n\nLength 3.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut back to turn 0.\n\nI was simulating if I go left on turn 0.\n\nBut there are other choices.\n\nI could go down on turn 0.\n\nFrom (3,3) dir L, I go D to (3,2).\n\nNo food at (3,2), so snake now at [(3,2)] dir D.\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,2) dir D, can go D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) (but not opposite, opposite to D is U, so U not allowed).\n\n(2,2) has food, so I can go L to (2,2) and eat.\n\nThen snake grows to [(2,2), (3,2)] head (2,2) dir L.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nThen I can go to (1,2) from there.\n\nOr I could go up on turn 0.\n\nFrom (3,3) dir L, go U to (3,4).\n\nNo food, snake at [(3,4)] dir U.\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,4) dir U, can go U to (3,5) which has food, so eat, snake grows to [(3,5), (3,4)] head (3,5) dir U.\n\nThen I have food at (1,2) and (2,2) still, but (2,2) is there.\n\n(2,2) has food, not eaten yet.\n\nIn all cases, I can eat one food soon.\n\nBut I need to think about the long-term and risks.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (4,6), which might be a problem later.\n\nSince all food is positive and same value, I should aim to eat as many as possible.\n\nBut with life span, they disappear after 10 turns.\n\nTurn 0, life span 10, so they last until turn 10, meaning they disappear at the end of turn 10 or before turn 11? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life span is given, then after action, it decreases.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food with life span 10 at turn t1=0, after turn 0, life span becomes 9; after turn 1, 8; ... after turn 9, life span 1; after turn 10, life span 0, so it disappears, I think at the start of turn 11 or after the decrease.\n\nTypically, at the end of each turn, life span decreases, and if 0, removed.\n\nBut for simplicity, it will be gone by turn 10 if not eaten.\n\nSince turn 0 to turn 10 is 11 turns? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 0, life span 10.\n\nAfter turn 0, decrease to 9.\n\nAfter turn 1, to 8.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 9, to 1.\n\nAfter turn 10, to 0, so removed before turn 11.\n\nSo available from turn 0 to turn 10 inclusive? At turn 10, before decrease, life span is 1, so I can eat it on turn 10, and it decreases after, but since I eat it, it's removed.\n\nIf I don't eat, after turn 10 action, it decreases to 0 and removed.\n\nSo food can be eaten on turns when life span >0, i.e., from turn 0 to turn 10.\n\n10 turns of availability? From turn 0 to turn 10, 11 turns, but life span decreases each turn, starting from 10 down to 0 after 10 decreases.\n\nAt turn t, before action, life span is L, then after action and movement, decrease.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves to food cell during move, it eats it.\n\nSo for a food with life span N at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears after t+N-1 turn, i.e., not available on turn t+N.\n\nHere N=10, t=0, so can be eaten on turns 0 to 9, disappears after turn 9? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 0: life span 10, can be eaten, after turn 0, life span 9\n\nTurn 1: life span 9, can be eaten, after turn 1, life span 8\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: life span 1, can be eaten, after turn 9, life span 0, removed.\n\nTurn 10: not available.\n\nSo available from turn 0 to turn 9 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly for all food.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nI should go for the food that might be harder to reach later.\n\n(3,5) is at y=5, and there's an obstacle at (4,6), which is above, but (4,6) might block some paths.\n\n(1,2) and (2,2) are close to each other.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can eat (2,2) or (3,5) in two turns.\n\nBut let's think about the grid.\n\nThe grid has walls at borders, and obstacle at (4,6).\n\nFor long-term, I need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nFor example, if I go to the bottom-left, where (1,2) and (2,2) are, I might be in a smaller area.\n\nTop-right has the obstacle.\n\nLet's list all cells.\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is obstacle.\n\nSo cells: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\n(4,6) blocked.\n\nFood at (1,2), (2,2), (3,5).\n\n(2,2) and (1,2) are at bottom-left, (3,5) at top.\n\nFrom (3,3), if I go up to (3,5), I can eat it soon, but then I'm at (3,5), with snake length 2, and I have to go down or left/right.\n\nBut (4,6) is blocked, so from (3,5), I can go down to (3,4), or left to (2,5), or right to (4,5), but (4,5) is free, since obstacle is (4,6).\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nIf I go to (2,2), I can eat (1,2) next, then I'm at (1,2) with length 3, and I have to go up or right, since left and down are walls or out.\n\nFrom (1,2), I can go up to (1,3), right to (2,2) but that's body if snake is there, etc.\n\nBut let's simulate both.\n\nFirst, option 1: go up on turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nNo food, snake at [(3,4)] dir U\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4) dir U, move U to (3,5) eat food, snake grows to [(3,5), (3,4)] head (3,5) dir U\n\nNow, remaining food: (1,2) and (2,2), life span 9 and 9 (after turn 0 and 1, life span decreased to 9 at start of turn 1? Let's track life span.\n\nAt turn 0 start: food life span 10\n\nAfter turn 0 action: if not eaten, life span decreases to 9\n\nSimilarly, after each turn.\n\nAt turn 1 start: food (1,2) life span 9, (2,2) life span 9, (3,5) eaten.\n\nI ate (3,5) on turn 1, so it's gone.\n\nNow at turn 1, after eating, snake at [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nHead at (3,5) dir U.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U to (3,6) but y=6, is it wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 is not wall, but y=6 is within 1 to 6, y=6 is playable, since walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are playable, except borders are walls, so y=6 is not border, x=6 is not border.\n\nx=0,7 walls, y=0,7 walls, so cells (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n\n(4,6) is obstacle, but (3,6) is free.\n\nSo from (3,5), U to (3,6) is possible.\n\nD to (3,4) but that's the body, (3,4) is occupied by body, not tail, tail is at (3,4), but head is at (3,5), body is (3,4), so (3,4) is body segment.\n\nIf I move down to (3,4), it's a body segment, not tail, so collision, die.\n\nL to (2,5)\n\nR to (4,5)\n\nAnd U to (3,6)\n\nCurrent direction U, so opposite is D, which is down, to body, which is invalid anyway.\n\nSo I can move U, L, or R.\n\nCannot move D.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), no food, then snake moves, tail removed, so head to (3,6), body was (3,5) becomes body, tail (3,4) removed, so new snake [(3,6), (3,5)] head (3,6) dir U.\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nBut (3,6) is near the top, and obstacle at (4,6), so I can go left or right.\n\nBut food is at (1,2) and (2,2), far away.\n\nLife span 9, so I have time.\n\nFrom (3,5), I could move L to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n\nSay I move L to (2,5) on turn 1 after eating? Turn 1 I already moved to (3,5) and ate.\n\nAt turn 1, after action, snake at [(3,5), (3,4)] dir U.\n\nNow turn 2, I need to move from (3,5) dir U.\n\nGo L to (2,5), no food, snake moves: head to (2,5), body (3,5) from head, tail (3,4) removed, so snake [(2,5), (3,5)] head (2,5) dir L.\n\nThen from there, I can go down towards (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is food, I can go (2,5) to (2,4) to (2,3) to (2,2), but (2,2) might be eaten by then or not.\n\nSimilarly, I could have gone down first from (3,3).\n\nBut let's consider the other option: go left on turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3), no food, snake at [(2,3)] dir L\n\nTurn 1: from (2,3) dir L, move D to (2,2) eat food, snake grows to [(2,2), (2,3)] head (2,2) dir D\n\nNow turn 2 start: food remaining (1,2) life span 8? Let's track turns.\n\nTurn 0: start, life span 10 for all food.\n\nAfter turn 0 action: if not eaten, life span decrease to 9.\n\nI moved to (2,3), no food eaten, so after turn 0, food (1,2), (2,2), (3,5) all life span 9.\n\nTurn 1: I move to (2,2), eat (2,2), so (2,2) removed. After turn 1, life span of remaining food decreases to 8.\n\nSo at turn 2 start: food (1,2) and (3,5) with life span 8.\n\nSnake at [(2,2), (2,3)] head (2,2) dir D.\n\nFrom (2,2) dir D, can move: D to (2,1), L to (1,2) food, R to (3,2) (since opposite to D is U, so U not allowed, but L and R are ok).\n\n(1,2) has food, so I can go L to (1,2) and eat.\n\nThen snake grows: head to (1,2), tail not removed, so snake [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] head (1,2) dir L.\n\nNow I have eaten two foods, length 3.\n\nRemaining food (3,5) with life span 8.\n\nFrom (1,2), I need to go to (3,5), which is far.\n\nI can go up or right.\n\nBut right to (2,2) is body, so cannot, only up or left or down.\n\nFrom (1,2) dir L, possible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1), L to (0,2) but x=0 is wall, cannot, R to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nGo U to (1,3) or D to (1,1).\n\nSay go U to (1,3), no food, snake moves: head to (1,3), body (1,2) from head, tail (2,3) removed, so snake [(1,3), (1,2)] head (1,3) dir U.\n\nThen continue to (1,4), etc., to go to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) has life span 8, so I have 8 turns to eat it.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can go to (2,3), then (3,3), etc.\n\nBut it might take many turns, and I need to avoid the body.\n\nSince the snake is longer, I have to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nThe bottom-left area might be cramped with walls.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), if I go down to (1,1), then I'm at corner, might be risky.\n\nBetter to go up.\n\nBut let's compare to if I went to (3,5) first.\n\nIn the first option, when I ate (3,5) on turn 1, I was at (3,5) with body at (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 2, I could move L to (2,5) or R to (4,5) or U to (3,6).\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then on turn 3, from (3,6) dir U, can go U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, cannot; D to (3,5) body; L to (2,6); R to (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo only L to (2,6).\n\nGo to (2,6), no food, snake [(2,6), (3,6)] head (2,6) dir L.\n\nThen from (2,6), can go down to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (2,2), I need to go down to y=2.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,5), if on turn 2 I go L to (2,5), then to (2,4), (2,3), (2,2) to eat it on turn 5 or so.\n\nBut (2,2) might have low life span.\n\nAt turn 2, (2,2) life span 7 (after decreases), so I have time.\n\nBut in the second option, when I ate (2,2) and (1,2) by turn 2, I have length 3 at (1,2), and (3,5) is far.\n\nThe distance from (1,2) to (3,5) is |3-1| + |5-2| = 2+3=5, so at least 5 moves, but with body, it might take more.\n\nLife span of (3,5) at turn 2 start is 8, so I can reach it by turn 7 or 8.\n\nBut I need to find a path.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat all three foods.\n\nBut with the snake growing, I need a path that doesn't trap me.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle might block.\n\nAnother idea: since (3,5) is near the obstacle, and (1,2) is far, it might be better to eat (3,5) first while the snake is short, so I can access it easily.\n\nIf I eat (2,2) and (1,2) first, I'm in bottom-left with length 3, and to go to (3,5), I have to traverse the grid, which might be harder with longer snake.\n\nFor example, from (1,2) with length 3, I go up to (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), then right to (2,6), (3,6), but (3,6) to (3,5) is down, but (3,5) might be food.\n\nBut at (3,6), I can go down to (3,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, I can go directly.\n\nBut it might be possible.\n\nHowever, the area around (4,6) obstacle might be tight.\n\nSince the snake is short at start, I should go for the food that is riskier to reach later.\n\n(3,5) is at y=5, and obstacle at (4,6), so from (3,5), I can go left or right, but not up because (3,6) is available, but then down is body if I go up.\n\nBut I can go left to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut let's see if there is a dead end near (3,5).\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,6), then I can only go left or right, since up is wall, down to body if snake there.\n\nBut with short snake, it's ok.\n\nWhereas (1,2) is near corner, which can be a dead end if snake is long.\n\nFor instance, from (1,2), I can only go up or down, not left or right in some cases.\n\nBut down to (1,1) is corner, then only up or right, but right might be body.\n\nSo bottom-left can be risky with long snake.\n\nTherefore, it might be better to eat (3,5) first, then the others.\n\nI could eat (2,2) first, then from there go to (3,5), then to (1,2).\n\n(2,2) is central.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, I should decide the first few moves.\n\nAlso, for turn 0, I have to choose one action.\n\nLet me choose to go up to (3,4) on turn 0 to set up for eating (3,5).\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nNo food eaten, snake at [(3,4)] dir U\n\nAfter turn 0, food life span decrease to 9 for all.\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5) eat food, snake grows to [(3,5), (3,4)] head (3,5) dir U\n\nRemaining food (1,2) and (2,2) with life span 9, after decrease to 8? At turn 1 start, life span 9, after turn 1 action, if not eaten, decrease to 8, but I ate (3,5), so only (1,2) and (2,2) remain, and after turn 1, their life span decrease to 8.\n\nNow from (3,5) dir U, I can move L to (2,5) or R to (4,5) or U to (3,6).\n\nMoving U to (3,6) might lead to a dead end, so better to go left or right.\n\nLet's go left to (2,5) to head towards (2,2).\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,5) no food, snake moves: head to (2,5), body (3,5) from head, tail (3,4) removed, so snake [(2,5), (3,5)] head (2,5) dir L\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,5) dir L, can move L to (1,5), D to (2,4), U to (2,6), R to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nOpposite to L is R, which is to body, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible: L, D, U.\n\n(2,4) is below, towards (2,2).\n\nGo D to (2,4), no food, snake moves: head to (2,4), body (2,5) becomes body, tail (3,5) removed, so snake [(2,4), (2,5)] head (2,4) dir D\n\nTurn 3: from (2,4) dir D, can move D to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4), U to (2,5) body, cannot.\n\nOpposite U not allowed.\n\nSo D, L, R.\n\n(2,3) is below, go D to (2,3), no food, snake moves: head to (2,3), body (2,4) becomes body, tail (2,5) removed, snake [(2,3), (2,4)] head (2,3) dir D\n\nTurn 4: from (2,3) dir D, can move D to (2,2) which has food, eat it.\n\nMove D to (2,2), eat food, snake grows: head to (2,2), tail not removed, so body was (2,3) becomes body, (2,4) is tail, add head (2,2), so snake [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] head (2,2) dir D\n\nNow, food at (2,2) eaten, removed.\n\nRemaining food (1,2) with life span, at turn 4 start, what is life span?\n\nTurn 0: life 10\n\nAfter turn 0: 9\n\nAfter turn 1: 8 for (1,2) and (2,2), but (2,2) eaten on turn 4? Let's track.\n\nAt turn 4 start: since after turn 3, life span decreased.\n\nStart turn 0: life 10\n\nAfter turn 0: life 9 (all)\n\nAfter turn 1: life 8 (for (1,2) and (2,2))\n\nAfter turn 2: life 7\n\nAfter turn 3: life 6\n\nAt turn 4 start, life span 6 for (1,2)\n\nI eat (2,2) on turn 4, so it's gone.\n\nAfter turn 4, life span of (1,2) decreases to 5.\n\nSnake at [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] head (2,2) dir D\n\nFrom here, I can go to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is left, but from (2,2), moving L to (1,2) would eat it, but (1,2) is adjacent left.\n\nMove L to (1,2), eat food, grow.\n\nThen snake becomes longer.\n\nBut let's see the position.\n\nFrom (2,2) dir D, moving L to (1,2) is possible, since not opposite (opposite is U).\n\nSo on turn 4, after moving to (2,2), I can on turn 5 move L to (1,2) to eat.\n\nIn turn 4, I moved to (2,2) and ate, so positions are as above.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,2) head dir D, move L to (1,2) eat food, so head to (1,2), tail not removed, snake grows to [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] head (1,2) dir L\n\nNow all food eaten, snake length 4.\n\nThen I need to move without food, but that's fine.\n\nBut I have to avoid collisions.\n\nFrom (1,2), dir L, but L to (0,2) wall, cannot; R to (2,2) body, collision; U to (1,3); D to (1,1).\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nSay go U to (1,3), no food, snake moves: head to (1,3), body (1,2) from head, tail (2,4) removed, so new snake [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] head (1,3) dir U\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut in this sequence, I ate all three foods by turn 5.\n\nTurn 0: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: U to (3,5) eat\n\nTurn 1: L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 2: D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 3: D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 4: D to (2,2) eat\n\nThen turn 5: from (2,2) move L to (1,2) eat\n\nIn turn 5, I moved from (2,2) to (1,2).\n\nBut at turn 4, after eating (2,2), snake is at [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] with head at (2,2).\n\nOn turn 5, I move L to (1,2) and eat (1,2).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the direction: at turn 4, after moving to (2,2) with action D, head direction is D.\n\nThen turn 5, move L to (1,2), which is left, so direction changes to L.\n\nNo problem.\n\nI could have eaten (1,2) earlier, but in this case, it worked.\n\nNow, is there a risk? At the end, when I go to (1,2), I am at corner, but since I ate the food, and moved away, it should be fine.\n\nIf I had gone to (3,5) first and then to (1,2), it might take longer, but in this sequence, I ate all by turn 5.\n\nTurn 5 I ate (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) was available until turn 9, so I had time.\n\nIn this sequence, on turn 0 I went up.\n\nBut on turn 0, I could go down or left.\n\nIf I go left on turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: L to (2,3) no food\n\nTurn 1: D to (2,2) eat\n\nThen turn 2: L to (1,2) eat? From (2,2) dir D, on turn 2, I can move L to (1,2) to eat (1,2).\n\nThen snake grows to [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] head (1,2) dir L\n\nThen I need to go to (3,5).\n\nFrom (1,2), I can go U to (1,3), then to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), then right to (2,6), (3,6), then down to (3,5) to eat on turn 8 or so.\n\nLife span of (3,5) at turn 2 start is 8, after decreases.\n\nAfter turn 0: life 9\n\nAfter turn 1: life 8 for (1,2) and (3,5), (2,2) eaten.\n\nAt turn 2 start, (1,2) life 8, (3,5) life 8.\n\nI eat (1,2) on turn 2, so (3,5) remains with life 8.\n\nAfter turn 2, life span 7 for (3,5).\n\nThen from (1,2) I go to (3,5).\n\nPath: from (1,2) to (3,5), I need to go to x=3, y=5.\n\nFrom (1,2), go U to (1,3) on turn 3, no food.\n\nSnake: before move, [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] head (1,2)\n\nMove U to (1,3), no food, so head to (1,3), body (1,2) from head, tail (2,3) removed, snake [(1,3), (1,2)] head (1,3) dir U? After move, direction U.\n\nPositions: head at (1,3), body at (1,2), tail was (2,3) removed, and (2,2) is body, but since tail removed, the segments are [(1,3), (1,2)]? No.\n\nSnake positions: before move: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] indices: head (1,2), then body (2,2), then tail (2,3)\n\nMove head to (1,3), no food, so new head (1,3), previous head (1,2) becomes body, tail (2,3) removed, so new body segments: (1,2) is now body, and (2,2) is still body? The body segments are in order.\n\nAfter move, the new position is head at new cell, and the body segments follow the path.\n\nOriginal: positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] meaning head at (1,2), next segment at (2,2), tail at (2,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (1,3), no growth, so head moves to (1,3), the segment at (1,2) becomes the first body segment, the segment at (2,2) becomes the second body segment, and the tail at (2,3) is removed. So new positions: head at (1,3), then body at (1,2), then body at (2,2). But (2,2) is not adjacent to (1,2)? (1,2) to (2,2) is adjacent right, but in the list, it should be connected.\n\nAfter move, snake should be [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] with head (1,3), tail (2,2).\n\nYes, segments are connected.\n\nThen on turn 4, from (1,3) dir U, move U to (1,4), no food, snake moves to [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] head (1,4) dir U, tail (2,2) removed? No.\n\nBefore move: [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] head (1,3)\n\nMove to (1,4), no food, new head (1,4), previous head (1,3) becomes body, tail (2,2) removed, so new snake [(1,4), (1,3)] head (1,4) dir U? And the segment at (1,2) is removed with tail? Tail is (2,2), removed, and (1,2) is still there? Positions: after move, head at (1,4), body at (1,3) (previous head), and the segment at (1,2) was connected to (1,3), but since tail removed, the body is only the previous head position.\n\nWhen tail is removed, the last segment is gone, so only the head and the remaining body.\n\nBefore move: segments S0: (1,3) head, S1: (1,2), S2: (2,2) tail\n\nAfter move head to (1,4), no food: new head at (1,4), S0 becomes body at (1,3), S1 at (1,2) is still body, but S2 tail removed. So positions: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)? (1,3) to (1,2) is adjacent, yes.\n\nSo snake [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] head (1,4) dir U.\n\nThen turn 5: move U to (1,5), no food, snake moves to [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] head (1,5) dir U, tail (1,2) removed? Before: head (1,4), body (1,3), tail (1,2)\n\nMove to (1,5), new head (1,5), body (1,4), tail (1,2) removed, so snake [(1,5), (1,4)] head (1,5) dir U.\n\nI think I messed up.\n\nAfter turn 3, after moving to (1,3), snake is [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] head (1,3)\n\nOn turn 4, move U to (1,4), no food: new head (1,4), previous head (1,3) becomes body, tail (2,2) removed, so the body segments: (1,3) is now first body, and since tail removed, no other body? The segment at (1,2) was part of body, but when tail is removed, it's gone.\n\nStandard: when no growth, head moves to new cell, all segments shift, tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo positions: new head position, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n\nSo from [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] head at (1,3)\n\nMove head to (1,4), so new head at (1,4), then the body segment that was at (1,3) moves to where? The body segments move towards the head.\n\nAfter head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nSo from positions: head was at (1,3), moves to (1,4)\n\nThen the segment that was at (1,2) moves to (1,3)\n\nThe segment that was at (2,2) moves to (1,2)\n\nThen tail was at (2,2), so it moves to (1,2), and the cell (2,2) is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head at (1,4), body at (1,3), tail at (1,2)\n\nYes, [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nSimilarly, on turn 5, move U to (1,5), no food: head to (1,5), body from (1,4) to (1,4)? Head was (1,4) to (1,5), then body at (1,3) moves to (1,4), tail at (1,2) moves to (1,3), so [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo reach (3,5), from (1,5), I need to go right to (2,5), (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut it will take several turns, and life span decreases.\n\nIn the first sequence, I ate all by turn 5, which is better.\n\nIn the first sequence with going up first, I ate (3,5) on turn 1, (2,2) on turn 4, (1,2) on turn 5.\n\nTurn 5: ate (1,2).\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions from turn 0.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nTurn 0: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: U to (3,5) eat\n\nThen I said turn 1: L to (2,5), but turn 1 is already used for moving to (3,5).\n\nAfter turn 1, on turn 2, I moved L to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 2: D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 3: D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 4: D to (2,2) eat\n\nThen turn 5: L to (1,2) eat\n\nIn turn 5, from (2,2) to (1,2), with head direction D, moving L is perpendicular, ok.\n\nBut after eating (2,2) on turn 4, snake is at [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] head (2,2) dir D.\n\nThen turn 5 move L to (1,2), which is left, so direction L.\n\nAnd (1,2) has food, eat, grow to [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] head (1,2) dir L.\n\nThen I can continue moving, but no more food, so I need to go to safe area.\n\nFor example, turn 6: from (1,2) dir L, can move U to (1,3) or D to (1,1), since L and R not possible.\n\nSay U to (1,3), etc.\n\nBut since the question is to maximize score, I have eaten all food, score 3.\n\nIf I go for (2,2) first, I might eat faster.\n\nTurn 0: from (3,3), go D to (3,2)\n\nNo food, snake at [(3,2)] dir D\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,2) dir D, move L to (2,2) eat, snake grows to [(2,2), (3,2)] head (2,2) dir L\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,2) dir L, move L to (1,2) eat, snake grows to [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2)] head (1,2) dir L\n\nThen I need to go to (3,5).\n\nFrom (1,2), turn 3: move U to (1,3), as before.\n\nBut to reach (3,5), it might take until turn 8 or later.\n\nLife span of (3,5) at turn 0:10, after turn 0:9, turn1:8, turn2:7, turn3:6, etc.\n\nAt turn 8, it might be gone or low.\n\nFor example, to go from (1,2) to (3,5), min steps: from (1,2) to (1,5) 3 up, then to (3,5) 2 right, total 5 moves, but with body, it takes more because I need to move the tail.\n\nIn turn 2, after eating (1,2), snake at [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2)] head (1,2)\n\nTurn 3: move U to (1,3), no food, snake moves to [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] head (1,3) dir U? After move, head to (1,3), body (1,2), tail (3,2) removed, so positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), and (2,2) is still there? Shift: head to (1,3), body from (1,2) moves to (1,2)? Better: segments shift.\n\nHead was (1,2) moves to (1,3)\n\nThen body segment that was at (2,2) moves to (1,2)\n\nTail at (3,2) moves to (2,2)\n\nSo new snake [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] head (1,3) dir U\n\nTurn 4: move U to (1,4), no food, snake to [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] head (1,4) dir U\n\nTurn 5: move U to (1,5), no food, snake to [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] head (1,5) dir U\n\nTurn 6: move U to (1,6), no food, snake to [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] head (1,6) dir U\n\nTurn 7: from (1,6) dir U, move R to (2,6), no food, snake to [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] head (2,6) dir R\n\nTurn 8: move R to (3,6), no food, snake to [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6)] head (3,6) dir R\n\nNow (3,5) is below, but from (3,6), move D to (3,5) to eat.\n\nTurn 9: move D to (3,5) eat, since food there.\n\nLife span: at turn 9, before move, life span of (3,5) is? Start turn 0:10, after each turn decrease.\n\nAfter turn 0:9\n\nAfter turn 1:8\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 8:2\n\nAt turn 9 start, life span 2? After turn 8, life span decreases to 2 for (3,5).\n\nAt turn 9, I can eat it, life span still 2 before eat, after eat it's gone.\n\nIf I don't eat, after turn 9, life span 1, then after turn 10, 0 removed.\n\nSo on turn 9 I can eat it.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate (2,2) on turn 1, (1,2) on turn 2, and (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nAte all, but later for (3,5).\n\nIn the first sequence, I ate (3,5) on turn 1, (2,2) on turn 4, (1,2) on turn 5, so all by turn 5, better.\n\nIf I go left on turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: L to (2,3) no food\n\nTurn 1: D to (2,2) eat\n\nThen turn 2: L to (1,2) eat\n\nThen same as above, need to go to (3,5), which takes to turn 9 or so.\n\nWorse.\n\nTherefore, going up first to eat (3,5) quickly, then down to (2,2) and (1,2) is better.\n\nIn the first sequence, after eating (3,5), I went left and down to (2,2).\n\nI could go directly from (3,5) to (2,2), but need to move.\n\nNow for the answer, I should output the sequence for several turns.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, and in my sequence, by turn 5 I have eaten all, but I can output up to turn 5.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U (to eat (3,5))\n\nThen on turn 1 after move, I need to choose for turn 2.\n\nIn my earlier, I moved L to (2,5) on turn 2? Turn 1 I moved U to (3,5), so for turn 2, I moved L to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 2: D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 3: D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 4: D to (2,2) eat\n\nThen turn 5: L to (1,2) eat\n\nBut on turn 5, I move to (1,2), which is fine.\n\nTo avoid the corner, but since I eat and move, it should be ok.\n\nI could after eating (2,2) go to other directions, but (1,2) is there, so I should eat it.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to list actions.\n\nAlso, the initial direction is L, and I moved U, which is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: in this case, no food under tail, so no issue.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: L\n\nTurn 3: D\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nIn turn 4, I moved D to (2,2), which is down, from (2,3).\n\nAnd turn 5 L to (1,2).\n\nIn the grid, (2,2) to (1,2) is left, yes.\n\nTo be precise, let's write the actions.\n\nSince the snake head direction changes, but I think it's fine.\n\nI could output for 5 turns or more.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have up to turn 5.\n\nPerhaps I can stop after turn 5, since all food eaten.\n\nBut I need to think ahead, but output the actions.\n\nAnother thing: in the food, there is (1,2), (3,5), (2,2), all with value 1.\n\nIn my sequence, I ate them all.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (2,2) first, but it takes longer for (3,5).\n\nI think the first sequence is optimal.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating all available positive food while avoiding collisions and dead ends. The grid has walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). The snake starts at position (3,3) with direction left (L). The food locations are (1,2), (2,2), and (3,5), each with a value of +1 and a life span of 10 turns (available until turn 9).\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Immediate Goal**: Eat the food at (3,5) first, as it is the farthest and riskier to reach later when the snake is longer. This also avoids potential dead ends in the bottom-left corner.\n- **Secondary Goal**: After eating (3,5), navigate toward (2,2) and then (1,2) to consume all food efficiently.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - The initial moves avoid reversing direction and steer clear of walls and obstacles.\n  - After growth, the snake must not collide with its body. Moving to the tail cell is safe since the tail moves forward.\n  - The bottom-left area (near (1,2)) is cramped; eating there last minimizes risk with a longer snake.\n- **Turn-by-Turn Simulation**: \n  - Start at turn 0: Snake is at (3,3), direction L.\n  - Food life span decreases after each turn (including turn 0), so they disappear after turn 9.\n  - Plan 5+ turns ahead to eat all food by turn 5.\n\n### Planned Moves (5 turns):\n1. **Turn 0**: Move Up (U) to (3,4). \n   - Why: Current direction is L; moving U is perpendicular and allowed. No food at (3,4), so no growth. Snake now at [(3,4)], direction U. Food life span decreases to 9 after this turn.\n   \n2. **Turn 1**: Move Up (U) to (3,5). \n   - Why: (3,5) has food; eat it for +1 score. Snake grows to length 2: positions [(3,5), (3,4)], direction U. Food (3,5) removed. Remaining food: (1,2) and (2,2) with life span 8 after this turn.\n\n3. **Turn 2**: Move Left (L) to (2,5). \n   - Why: From (3,5) direction U, moving L is allowed (not opposite). No food at (2,5), so snake moves: head to (2,5), tail removed. Snake now at [(2,5), (3,5)], direction L. Food life span decreases to 7 after this turn.\n\n4. **Turn 3**: Move Down (D) to (2,4). \n   - Why: From (2,5) direction L, moving D is allowed (perpendicular). No food at (2,4), so snake moves: head to (2,4), tail removed. Snake now at [(2,4), (2,5)], direction D. Food life span decreases to 6 after this turn.\n\n5. **Turn 4**: Move Down (D) to (2,3). \n   - Why: From (2,4) direction D, moving D continues downward. No food at (2,3), so snake moves: head to (2,3), tail removed. Snake now at [(2,3), (2,4)], direction D. Food life span decreases to 5 after this turn. (2,2) is now adjacent below.\n\n6. **Turn 5**: Move Down (D) to (2,2). \n   - Why: From (2,3) direction D, moving D is forward. (2,2) has food; eat it for +1 score. Snake grows to length 3: positions [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)], direction D. Food (2,2) removed. Remaining food: (1,2) with life span 4 after this turn. (1,2) is adjacent left.\n\n### Beyond Turn 5:\n- **Turn 6**: Move Left (L) to (1,2) to eat the last food (life span 4, still available). Snake grows to length 4: positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)], direction L.\n- **Post-Food Strategy**: After eating all food, move to open areas (e.g., up to (1,3) or down to (1,1)) to avoid collisions. The grid has space, and with no food, focus on survival.\n\nThis sequence eats all food by turn 6 (turn 5 for (2,2), turn 6 for (1,2)), maximizing score (+3) with minimal risk. It avoids the obstacle at (4,6) and leverages the snake's short length to access (3,5) early. All moves respect movement constraints and collision rules.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: L \\\\\nTurn 3: D \\\\\nTurn 4: D \\\\\nTurn 5: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 1, and the grid has walls on the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). The snake is just one segment at (3,4), so it's only the head. The head direction is Up, meaning it's moving upwards.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 9\n\n- (3,5) with value 1 and life span 9\n\n- (2,2) with value 1 and life span 9\n\n- (5,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food has positive value +1, so no negative food here. Life spans are high, around 9 or 10, so they'll last many turns.\n\nSince the snake is only one segment, eating any food will make it grow to length 2. But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nThe grid size: from walls, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so it's an 8x8 grid, but cells are from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n\nBorder walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the snake can be on cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6. Similarly, food is given at (1,2), (3,5), etc., all within 1 to 6, so playable grid is 6x6? x from 1 to 6 inclusive, that's 6 cells, similarly y from 1 to 6, so 6x6 grid.\n\nx=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6. Yes, 6x6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which is within bounds.\n\nSnake head at (3,4), direction Up.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,2): value 1, life 9\n\n- (3,5): value 1, life 9\n\n- (2,2): value 1, life 9\n\n- (5,2): value 1, life 10\n\nAll at y=2 except (3,5) at y=5.\n\n(3,5) is directly above the head, since head is at (3,4) and moving Up, so if it moves Up to (3,5), it can eat that food immediately.\n\nBut I need to think about the consequences.\n\nSince the snake is length 1, eating food will make it length 2. After eating, the head moves to the food cell, and since it grows, the tail stays where it was, but since it was only one segment, after eating, the head is at the food, and the tail is at the previous head position.\n\nLet's clarify snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves away from the end.\n\nBut when eating, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail doesn't move, effectively the snake grows.\n\nBut here, since it's length 1, if it eats, it becomes length 2 with head at food and tail at previous position.\n\nNow, for turn 1, head at (3,4), direction Up, so it can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is U, it cannot move D (down) immediately, because that would be reverse.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R. D is not allowed.\n\nNow, moving U to (3,5) has food, so it would eat it.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\n(3,5) has food, so moving there eats it.\n\nBut let's see the Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills. But here, no tail yet, so not applicable.\n\nAfter eating, snake becomes two segments: head at (3,5), tail at (3,4).\n\nThen, direction is still U, I assume? Or does direction change based on move?\n\nThe head direction is given, but when you move, you set a new direction.\n\nIn the input, it says \"Snake Head Direction: U\" for this turn.\n\nAfter moving, the direction will be the direction you moved.\n\nFor example, if I move U, new direction is U; if I move L, new direction is L, etc.\n\nNow, back to moving U: to (3,5), which has food, so eat it. Snake grows to length 2: positions [(3,5), (3,4)].\n\nNew head direction U.\n\nLife span of that food was 9, but since eaten, it's gone.\n\nOther foods are still there.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nIf I don't move U, I could move L or R.\n\nMove L to (2,4) or R to (4,4).\n\n(2,4) has no food, similarly (4,4) no food.\n\n(3,5) has food, so moving U gives immediate reward.\n\nBut is it safe? After eating, head at (3,5), tail at (3,4). Now, possible next moves.\n\nFrom (3,5), direction U, so can move U, L, R, not D (reverse).\n\nU to (3,6): but y=6 is wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is playable? Let's see.\n\nBorder walls: y=0 or y=7 are walls. So y from 1 to 6 are free, except internal obstacles.\n\ny=6 is not y=0 or y=7, so it should be free, unless internal obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), not (3,6), so (3,6) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, x from 1 to 6.\n\nSo from (3,5), move U to (3,6): no food there, I think. Food is at (1,2), (2,2), (3,5) eaten, (5,2). (3,6) no food.\n\nThen snake moves: head to (3,6), tail moves from (3,4) to... when not eating, tail moves, so positions: head at (3,6), tail at (3,5)? Let's think.\n\nAfter turn 1: snake ate, so positions: head (3,5), body (3,4) — since length 2, it's body segment.\n\nThen turn 2: move U to (3,6), no food, so head moves to (3,6), tail moves away, so the segment at (3,4) becomes the tail, and it moves? No.\n\nSnake movement: when moving, the head moves to new cell. If no food, the tail is removed from the end. So from positions [(3,5), (3,4)], if move to (3,6), no food, so new positions: head at (3,6), and the body segment was (3,5), but since tail moved, the segment at (3,4) is removed, so now snake is just [(3,6), (3,5)]? Positions are head first, then body.\n\nInitially after eating: positions [(3,5), (3,4)] with head at (3,5).\n\nMove to (3,6): head moves to (3,6), and since no food, tail is removed, so the last segment (3,4) is removed, and the new tail is where the body was? The body segment (3,5) becomes the new tail position, but since head moved to (3,6), positions become [(3,6), (3,5)].\n\nYes, so length 2, head at (3,6), tail at (3,5).\n\nThen from there, direction U, can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (3,7): but y=7 is wall, so collision, die. Cannot move U.\n\nL to (2,6): no food, or R to (4,6): but (4,6) is internal obstacle, so wall, collision.\n\nSo from (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7) wall, invalid; D to (3,5) but (3,5) is current tail, and since direction is U, moving D is reverse, not allowed? No instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so cannot move D immediately.\n\nPossible: U, L, R.\n\nU to wall, invalid.\n\nL to (2,6): let's check if wall. (2,6): x=2, y=6, not border wall (x=0,7 or y=0,7), and not internal obstacle (only (4,6)), so (2,6) should be free.\n\nR to (4,6): (4,6) is internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo only possible move from (3,6) is L to (2,6).\n\nThen snake moves to (2,6), no food, so positions: head to (2,6), tail to (3,6)? From [(3,6), (3,5)], move head to (2,6), no food, so tail removed, positions [(2,6), (3,6)].\n\nThen from there, direction L (since moved left), so can move U, D, L, not R (reverse).\n\nBut (2,6) is near top-left? y=6 is high, x=2.\n\nFood is all at low y, like y=2.\n\nMoving to (3,5) on turn 1 might lead to a dead end if I go up.\n\nBut I don't have to go up immediately; from (3,5), I could move left or right.\n\nBack to turn 1: at (3,4), direction U.\n\nOptions: U to (3,5) with food.\n\nL to (2,4) no food.\n\nR to (4,4) no food.\n\nIf I move U and eat (3,5), then on turn 2, from (3,5), I can choose to move L, R, or U, but not D.\n\nMove L to (2,5): no food there? Food at (1,2), (2,2), etc., (2,5) no food.\n\nSimilarly, move R to (4,5): no food.\n\nOr move U to (3,6), which we saw is risky.\n\nBut from (3,5), if I move L to (2,5), then positions: head to (2,5), no food, so tail moves from (3,4) to? After eating on turn 1, positions [(3,5), (3,4)].\n\nMove to (2,5), no food, so head to (2,5), tail removed, positions [(2,5), (3,5)].\n\nThen from (2,5), direction L (since moved left), can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU to (2,6): no food\n\nD to (2,4): no food? (2,4) might be empty.\n\nL to (1,5): no food\n\nR to (3,5) but (3,5) is current body, and moving there would cause collision, but (3,5) is the body segment, not the tail.\n\nIn this case, positions [(2,5), (3,5)], so (3,5) is the tail, I think? Head is (2,5), body is (3,5), so tail is (3,5).\n\nIf I move R to (3,5), which is the tail, but in snake game, moving to the tail is usually allowed because the tail moves away, so it's only collision if it's a body segment that doesn't move away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo from [(2,5), (3,5)], if I move R to (3,5), which is the tail, it should be ok because the tail will move forward when the head moves.\n\nIf I move to (3,5), head moves to (3,5), but (3,5) is current tail, and since no food, tail moves away, so the cell is free, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to a body segment that is not tail, collision.\n\nHere, (3,5) is tail, so moving to it is safe if no food, or if food, but no food here.\n\nSo from (2,5), moving R to (3,5) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nBack to turn 1 decision.\n\nIf I eat (3,5) on turn 1, I get +1, snake length 2.\n\nThen I need to plan where to go.\n\nThere is food at (2,2) and (1,2), etc., all at y=2.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go down, but current direction U, so I cannot move D immediately because of no instant reverse.\n\nSo from (3,5), I can only move U, L, or R, not D.\n\nMoving U to (3,6) is dangerous as we saw, only one exit via L to (2,6).\n\nMoving L to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n\nFrom there, I can then move down towards the food.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), after moving L from (3,5), I can then move D to (2,4), since direction is L, moving D is not reverse, it's perpendicular.\n\nNo instant reverse only forbids opposite direction, so from direction L, I can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nU up, D down, L left, R right.\n\nSo from L direction, I can move U, D, or L, not R.\n\nSimilarly, from U direction, I can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nSo from (2,5) with direction L, I can move D to (2,4).\n\nThen to (2,3), (2,2) which has food.\n\n(2,2) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,5) if I move R to (4,5), then I can move down to (4,4), (4,3), etc., but food at (5,2), not directly.\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2.\n\nBut there's an internal obstacle at (4,6), which might affect paths.\n\nSince all food is at bottom, it might be better to not eat the top food yet and go down first.\n\nBut the food at (3,5) has life span 9, so it will be there for 8 more turns after this, since life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nTurn t1=1, life span 9, so after turn 1, if not eaten, life span 8, and so on.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can go down to eat the bottom foods.\n\nAt turn 1, head at (3,4), direction U.\n\nInstead of moving U, I could move L or R to avoid eating (3,5) now and go down.\n\nFor example, move L to (2,4).\n\nThen no food, so snake still length 1, positions [(2,4)], head at (2,4), new direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can move L, U, D, not R (reverse).\n\nMove D to (2,3): no food.\n\nThen to (2,2) which has food.\n\n(2,2) has food, so move to (2,2) on turn 3 or something.\n\nLet's plan the turns.\n\nTurn 1: at (3,4), direction U.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,5), eat food, length 2, head at (3,5), tail at (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen turn 2: from (3,5), cannot move D, so options: U, L, R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), as before, then only L to (2,6) possible, then from (2,6) I can move D or L or U.\n\nBut y=6 is high, food is low, so I might get stuck or have to come back, wasting moves.\n\nFrom (3,5), move L to (2,5), no food, so positions [(2,5), (3,5)]? After move: head to (2,5), no food, so tail at (3,4) removed, but snake was [(3,5), (3,4)], move head to (2,5), no food, so new positions: head (2,5), and the previous head (3,5) becomes body, but since tail moved, the last segment (3,4) is removed, so positions [(2,5), (3,5)].\n\nYes.\n\nThen turn 2: head at (2,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nCan move U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), not R.\n\n(2,4) is below, which is towards food.\n\nMove D to (2,4), no food, positions [(2,4), (2,5)]? Head to (2,4), no food, tail removed, so from [(2,5), (3,5)], tail (3,5) removed, head to (2,4), so positions [(2,4)].\n\nWhen moving to (2,4), no food, and snake was length 2, so after move, length 2 but tail removed, so only one segment? No.\n\nPositions: before move: [(2,5), (3,5)] — head (2,5), body (3,5).\n\nMove head to (2,4), no food, so new head (2,4), and the body (3,5) is removed since tail moves, but since it's the only body segment, it is removed, so new positions just [(2,4)], length 1.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard snake: when snake moves and no food eaten, the head moves to new cell, the tail moves from the last cell, so the snake length remains the same.\n\nFor length 2: positions [head, tail].\n\nAfter moving to a new cell with no food, new head position, and the old tail position is vacated, so new positions [new head, old head], since the tail was the old head, it is now the new tail.\n\nExample: start [A, B] with A head, B tail.\n\nMove to C, no food: new head C, new tail is B? No: the segment that was head becomes body, and tail remains.\n\nBut when moving, the tail moves away from its position.\n\nAfter move, the new body is the previous head, and new tail is the previous tail only if not moved, but it moves.\n\nWhen you move the head to a new cell:\n\n- If no food, the tail is removed from the grid, so the snake shortens? No, the tail cell is vacated, but the snake doesn't shorten; the segment that was tail is removed, and the new tail is the segment before the tail.\n\nFor a snake of length L, positions [p0, p1, p2, ..., p_{L-1}] with p0 head.\n\nWhen moving to new cell q:\n\n- If q has no food, then new positions: [q, p0, p1, ..., p_{L-2}] , so the last position p_{L-1} is removed, and q is new head, p0 becomes first body, etc.\n\nFor length 2: positions [p0, p1] with p0 head, p1 tail.\n\nMove to q, no food: new positions [q, p0] , with q head, p0 tail.\n\nThe cell p1 is vacated.\n\nFor length 1: positions [p0].\n\nMove to q, no food: since no tail to move, new positions [q], and p0 vacated.\n\nIf eat food, then new positions [q, p0] for length 2, and q has food.\n\nBack to our case.\n\nTurn 1: start, snake at [(3,4)], length 1.\n\nMove U to (3,5), which has food, so eat, new positions: [(3,5), (3,4)] with head (3,5), tail (3,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 2: from (3,5), move L to (2,5), no food there, so new positions: head (2,5), and since no food, tail removed, so new positions [(2,5), (3,5)] with (2,5) head, (3,5) tail.\n\nDirection now L.\n\nTurn 3: from (2,5), move D to (2,4), no food, so new positions: head (2,4), tail removed, so [(2,4), (2,5)]? From [(2,5), (3,5)], move head to (2,4), no food, so new head (2,4), and the previous head (2,5) becomes the new tail, and the old tail (3,5) is removed. So positions [(2,4), (2,5)] with head (2,4), tail (2,5).\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 4: from (2,4), move D to (2,3), no food, positions [(2,3), (2,4)].\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 5: move D to (2,2), which has food, so eat, new positions: head to (2,2), and since food, grow, so tail not removed, add new segment, so positions [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]? After move to food, head at (2,2), and the previous positions: since eaten, the tail doesn't move, so from [(2,3), (2,4)] before move? Turn 4 positions [(2,3), (2,4)] head (2,3), tail (2,4).\n\nMove to (2,2) with food, so new head (2,2), and the previous tail stays, so new positions [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] with head (2,2), body (2,3), tail (2,4).\n\nLength 3.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I ate two foods: (3,5) on turn 1 and (2,2) on turn 5.\n\nBut I could have gone directly to (2,2) without eating (3,5).\n\nAt turn 1, instead of moving U, move L to (2,4).\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,4), no food, so snake still [(2,4)], length 1, direction L.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,4), can move L, U, D, not R.\n\nMove D to (2,3), no food, positions [(2,3)], direction D.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (2,2), which has food, eat, so positions [(2,2), (2,3)], length 2, direction D.\n\nThen on turn 3, I have eaten (2,2) and I'm at (2,2) with tail at (2,3).\n\nCompared to previous, I ate (2,2) on turn 3 instead of turn 5, and I didn't eat (3,5) yet, which is still there.\n\nLife span of (3,5) is 9, turn 1, so after turn 1, life 8, turn 2 life 7, etc., so it will last until turn 9.\n\nTurn 1: life 9, after turn 1 decrease, so at start of turn 2, life 8, etc. Disappears after N turns, so at turn N+1 it's gone.\n\nFood life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t+L-1? Let's see.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, when state is given, life span is L, meaning it has L turns left, including current turn.\n\nAfter current turn, if not eaten, countdown to L-1, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (3,5) at turn 1, life span 9, so after turn 1, if not eaten, life span 8 at turn 2 start, and so on, until after turn 9, if not eaten, it disappears, so available from turn 1 to turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the first path, I ate (3,5) on turn 1 and (2,2) on turn 5.\n\nIn the second, I ate (2,2) on turn 3, and (3,5) is still available for later.\n\nAlso, there is (1,2) and (5,2) food.\n\n(1,2) has life 9, (2,2) life 9, (5,2) life 10.\n\nAfter eating (2,2) on turn 3, I can go to eat (1,2) or (3,5) or (5,2).\n\nBut (3,5) is at (3,5), which is above.\n\nWith snake at (2,2), tail at (2,3), direction D.\n\nCan move L to (1,2) which has food, but Tail Reward Danger?\n\nHead at (2,2), tail at (2,3), which is adjacent? (2,2) and (2,3) are adjacent vertically.\n\nTail is at (2,3), which has no food; the food is at (1,2), which is different cell.\n\nTail Reward Danger: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n\nHere, tail cell is (2,3), which has no food, so no danger.\n\n(1,2) has food, so moving L to (1,2) would eat it.\n\nAre they adjacent? (2,2) to (1,2) is left, adjacent.\n\nBut tail is at (2,3), not at (1,2).\n\nSo no issue.\n\nMove to (1,2), eat food, grow to length 3, positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3)? After eating, from [(2,2), (2,3)] move to (1,2) with food, so new head (1,2), previous tail stays, so positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)].\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (4,6), but it might not affect bottom area.\n\nAnother option: at turn 1, move R to (4,4) instead.\n\nThen go to (5,2) or something.\n\nBut (5,2) has life 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut let's consider the risks.\n\nIf I eat (3,5) on turn 1, I go to (3,5), which is near the top, and the grid has walls at top, so I might get trapped if I'm not careful.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), if I move U to (3,6), then only left to (2,6), then from (2,6) I can move D to (2,5), etc., but it takes turns to come down.\n\nWhereas if I go down first, I can eat multiple foods quickly.\n\nMoreover, with snake longer, it might be harder to maneuever in tight spaces.\n\nBut at the bottom, y=2, there are three foods: (1,2), (2,2), (5,2).\n\n(1,2), (2,2), and (5,2), with (3,5) separate.\n\n(2,2) and (1,2) are adjacent, so I can eat both in sequence.\n\n(5,2) is on the right.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) is not near, so probably ok.\n\nSo perhaps it's better to go for the bottom foods first, since they are closer and I can eat them faster.\n\nFrom (3,4), to go to (2,2), for example.\n\nAt (3,4), direction U.\n\nIf I move L to (2,4), as before, then D to (2,3), then D to (2,2) eat on turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, I could move D, but I cannot because no instant reverse; current direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nSo only L or R or U.\n\nU is to food, but I want to avoid that for now.\n\nMove L to (2,4).\n\nOr move R to (4,4).\n\nIf I move R to (4,4), no food, snake still [(4,4)], direction R.\n\nThen turn 2: can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nMove D to (4,3), no food.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (4,2), but (4,2) has no food; food is at (5,2), not (4,2).\n\n(4,2) empty, I think.\n\nThen to (5,2), I need to move R from (4,2) to (5,2), but on turn 3 at (4,2), direction D (since moved down), so can move L, R, D, not U.\n\nR to (5,2) has food, eat.\n\nBut from (4,4), I could move directly towards (5,2), but (5,2) is at (5,2), from (4,4) I can move R to (5,4)? (5,4) no food, then D to (5,3), then D to (5,2), eat on turn 4 or something.\n\nLet's calculate turns.\n\nPath to (5,2):\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4), no food, positions [(4,4)], direction R.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,4), no food, positions [(5,4)], direction R.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (5,3), no food, positions [(5,3)], direction D.\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2), eat food, positions [(5,2), (5,3)], length 2.\n\nAte (5,2) on turn 4.\n\nBut (5,2) has life 10, so ok.\n\nCompared to going left: to (2,2) on turn 3.\n\n(2,2) life 9, turn 3 is fine.\n\nAlso, (1,2) nearby.\n\nBut (3,5) is at top with life 9, I can eat it later.\n\nNow, the grid is 6x6, with walls and obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which might block some paths to top-right, but since foods are at left and bottom, not critical.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival and maximizing score.\n\nSince all food is +1, and no negative, I can eat all, but need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, with snake growing, space decreases.\n\nBut grid 6x6, maximum cells 36, but with walls and obstacle, playable cells: x 1-6, y 1-6, 36 cells, minus one obstacle (4,6), so 35 cells, but walls are borders, so no, the borders are walls, so the playable area is cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle (4,6), so cells available: 36 - 1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake can occupy up to 35 cells, but with food appearing, it might be less.\n\nBut for now, snake short.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat foods efficiently.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but how many turns? It says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output actions for a sequence.\n\nThe user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn t1.\n\nBut how many? It might be open-ended, but for this state, I can plan a path.\n\nSince the snake is at (3,4), and foods at (1,2), (2,2), (3,5), (5,2), I can eat (2,2) first, then (1,2), then go to (5,2) or (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is closer in terms of steps, but direction.\n\nLet's find the shortest path to each food.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (2,2): Manhattan distance |3-2| + |4-2| = 1+2=3 moves.\n\nTo (1,2): |3-1| + |4-2| =2+2=4 moves.\n\nTo (3,5): |3-3| + |4-5| =0+1=1 move, but with eating.\n\nTo (5,2): |3-5| + |4-2| =2+2=4 moves.\n\nBut with direction constraint.\n\nTo (3,5) is 1 move up.\n\nTo (2,2): if I move L to (2,4), then D to (2,3), then D to (2,2), 3 moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,2): move R to (4,4), R to (5,4), D to (5,3), D to (5,2), 4 moves.\n\nBut I can move directly if possible, but with direction.\n\nAt (3,4), direction U, to go to (2,2), I have to go left and down, but I can't go down directly, so must go left first or right, but left is towards (2,2).\n\nSo move L to (2,4), then down.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,2), move right then down.\n\nBut (3,5) is very close, but eating it might force me to go up and risk.\n\nSince life span is long, I can delay eating (3,5) and eat the bottom foods first.\n\nThen later, when I have space, eat (3,5).\n\nFor example, after eating (2,2) and (1,2), I can go up to (3,5).\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the Tail Reward Danger, but for now, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no body, so no issue.\n\nSo for turn 1, I think it's better not to eat (3,5) now, and go for (2,2).\n\nSo move L to (2,4).\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,4), direction L, move D to (2,3).\n\nTurn 3: from (2,3), direction D, move D to (2,2), eat food.\n\nThen snake length 2, positions [(2,2), (2,3)]? After eating, head at (2,2), tail at (2,3), direction D.\n\nNow, from here, I can move to (1,2) which is adjacent left.\n\nHead at (2,2), tail at (2,3), move L to (1,2), which has food, so eat.\n\nThen positions: head to (1,2), with food, so grow, positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)].\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, I have eaten two foods, length 3.\n\nNext, I can go to (5,2) or to (3,5).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is right and down? (1,2) to (5,2) is |5-1| + |2-2| =4 in x, same y, so move right.\n\nFrom (1,2), direction L, so I can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nL to (0,2) but x=0 is wall, cannot.\n\nU to (1,3), D to (1,1) but y=1 not wall, y=0 wall, so y=1 is playable? Walls y=0 or y=7, so y=1 is free.\n\nSimilarly x=1 free.\n\nSo from (1,2), move U to (1,3), or D to (1,1), or L but wall, not possible, or R to (2,2) but (2,2) is current body, not tail.\n\nPositions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)], so head (1,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3).\n\n(2,2) is body segment, not tail.\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), it would be collision because (2,2) is occupied by body and not moving away immediately.\n\nThe tail is at (2,3), which will move when I move, but (2,2) is a body segment that will stay or move depending.\n\nWhen I move, the head moves to new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo if I move to (2,2), which is currently occupied by the first body segment, after I move, that segment will move to the head's old position or something.\n\nSpecifically, if I move to a cell that will be vacated, it might be ok, but in standard snake, moving to a body segment causes collision, except the tail if it moves.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut for other body segments, it's collision.\n\nHere, (2,2) is not the tail; tail is (2,3).\n\nSo moving to (2,2) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (1,3) or (1,1) or L to wall invalid.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nMove D to (1,1) or U to (1,3).\n\nSay move U to (1,3), no food, so positions: head to (1,3), no food, so tail moves: the tail (2,3) is removed, and body segments move: the segment at (2,2) moves to the previous head position (1,2)? Let's see.\n\nPositions before move: [head (1,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3)]\n\nMove head to (1,3), no food.\n\nNew head: (1,3)\n\nThe first body segment (2,2) moves to the old head position (1,2)\n\nThe tail (2,3) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(1,3), (1,2)] with head (1,3), tail (1,2)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen I can move to other places.\n\nBut I want to go to (5,2) or (3,5).\n\nFrom (1,3), I can move right, etc.\n\nBut it might take many moves.\n\nFrom (1,2) after eating, instead of moving U, I could move D to (1,1), then to (2,1), etc., but not directly to right.\n\nSince I need to go to (5,2), I should have gone right from the start or something.\n\nBut at (1,2), I can only move U or D, not R directly.\n\nSo to go right, I need to go up or down first.\n\nFor example, move U to (1,3), then R to (2,3), but (2,3) might be occupied.\n\nIn the position above, after moving to (1,3), positions [(1,3), (1,2)], tail at (1,2).\n\nThen move R to (2,3), no food, positions: head to (2,3), body (1,3) moves to (1,2)? New head (2,3), body (1,3) moves to old head (1,3)? Standard: new head (2,3), the previous body (1,3) becomes new body at its position or moves?\n\nPositions before: [ (1,3), (1,2) ] head (1,3), tail (1,2)\n\nMove to (2,3), no food.\n\nNew head (2,3)\n\nThe body segment that was at (1,3) moves to the old head position? No, the body segments follow the head.\n\nThe segment that was at (1,3) moves to where the head was, but the head was at (1,3), so it stays? Confusion.\n\nBetter to think: the snake moves by adding a new head and removing the tail if no food.\n\nSo from positions [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n\nMove to D, no food: new positions [D, A, B] and C removed.\n\nIf B was body, it is now at A, etc.\n\nIn this case: positions before move: head (1,3), body (1,2) — for length 2, it's [head, tail].\n\nIn [(1,3), (1,2)], head (1,3), tail (1,2).\n\nMove to (2,3), no food: new head (2,3), and the previous head (1,3) becomes the new tail? New positions [ (2,3), (1,3) ] with head (2,3), tail (1,3).\n\nThe cell (1,2) is vacated.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut to go to (5,2), it will take time.\n\nFrom the beginning, if I go to (5,2) first.\n\nTurn 1: at (3,4) direction U, move R to (4,4), no food, positions [(4,4)], direction R.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,4), no food, positions [(5,4)], direction R.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (5,3), no food, positions [(5,3)], direction D.\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2), eat food, positions [(5,2), (5,3)], length 2, direction D.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go left to (4,2), etc., to eat other foods.\n\nBut (2,2) and (1,2) are on left.\n\n(3,5) at top.\n\nNow, comparing the two strategies:\n\n- If I go left first: eat (2,2) on turn 3, then (1,2) on turn 4, for example.\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,4), no food, positions [(2,4)], direction L.\n\nTurn 2: move D to (2,3), no food, positions [(2,3)], direction D.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (2,2), eat, positions [(2,2), (2,3)], direction D.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (1,2), eat, positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)], direction L.\n\nThen from here, as before, I can only move U or D.\n\nMove U to (1,3), etc.\n\nAte two foods by turn 4.\n\n- If I go right to (5,2): eat on turn 4, only one food.\n\n- If I eat (3,5) on turn 1, then on turn 2 move L to (2,5), then down to (2,2) on turn 5, as earlier, ate two foods by turn 5.\n\nBut in the left strategy, I ate two by turn 4.\n\nAlso, in left strategy, I have (3,5) still available.\n\nSo better to go for the cluster of foods at bottom left first.\n\nMoreover, (1,2) and (2,2) are adjacent, easy to eat both quickly.\n\n(5,2) is alone.\n\nSo for turn 1, I should move L to (2,4).\n\nThen proceed to (2,2).\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nBut how many? The user didn't specify, but since it's \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 turns of actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=1.\n\nSo plan actions for turn 1 to, say, turn 5 or 6.\n\nAfter that, the state changes, but I can plan a path.\n\nAlso, after eating (1,2) and (2,2), I can go to (3,5) or (5,2).\n\n(3,5) is closer in x, but higher y.\n\nFrom (1,2) after eating, positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)], head at (1,2), direction L.\n\nAs above, can move U to (1,3) or D to (1,1).\n\nSay I move U to (1,3), positions [(1,3), (1,2)] or as before.\n\nTo go to (3,5), I need to go right and up.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), move R to (2,3), but at that point, (2,3) might be empty.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 4, I am at (1,2) with body, so move U to (1,3), positions [(1,3), (1,2)] if length 2, but after eating (1,2), length 3, but when I move, if no food, length might decrease? No, when moving no food, length same.\n\nFrom turn 4: after eating (1,2), positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] head (1,2), direction L.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (1,3), no food (assume), so new head (1,3), the body (2,2) moves to old head position (1,2)? Positions: new head (1,3), the previous head (1,2) becomes body, so now body at (1,2), and the previous body (2,2) moves to where? The segments: the first body segment (2,2) moves to the position of the head, but the head was at (1,2), so (2,2) moves to (1,2), but (1,2) is occupied? No, in terms of positions.\n\nThe snake: segments are at positions. When head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nSo before move: segment 0: (1,2) head, segment 1: (2,2), segment 2: (2,3) tail.\n\nMove head to (1,3), no food.\n\nNew segment 0: (1,3) new head\n\nSegment 1: moves to position of old segment 0, which is (1,2)\n\nSegment 2: moves to position of old segment 1, which is (2,2)\n\nThen tail old segment 2 at (2,3) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), body (2,2) — so [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]\n\nHead (1,3), tail (2,2)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 6: from (1,3), can move U to (1,4), D to (1,2) but (1,2) is body, collision, L to wall, R to (2,3)? (2,3) might be free.\n\n(2,3) is not occupied now, since tail was removed.\n\nPositions: head (1,3), body (1,2), tail (2,2)\n\n(2,3) is free.\n\nMove R to (2,3), no food, so new head (2,3), body moves: segment (1,2) moves to (1,3)? New head (2,3), segment (1,2) moves to old head (1,3), segment (2,2) moves to old segment (1,2) position? Old segment (1,2) was at (1,2), so segment (2,2) moves to (1,2).\n\nThen tail removed.\n\nNew positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2)]? New head (2,3), then body at (1,3), then tail at (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is position.\n\nThen I can move to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut it's getting messy.\n\nTo reach (3,5), from (1,3) move R to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (3,5), but (3,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nBut in this case, by turn 6 or so, I can be at (3,3), then U to (3,4), then U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut (3,5) life span 9, turn 1 to 9, so on turn 6 it might still be there if not eaten.\n\nTurn 1 life 9, after turn 1 life 8, ..., after turn 5 life 4, at turn 6 life 3, so available.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) life 10, available longer.\n\nBut for the action sequence, I think for turn 1, move L.\n\nThen for turn 2, move D.\n\nTurn 3, move D to eat (2,2).\n\nThen for turn 4, move L to eat (1,2).\n\nThen for turn 5, from there, I can move U or D, say move U to (1,3) to start heading towards (3,5).\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) is not in the way for now.\n\nSo let's define the sequence.\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2: from (2,4), direction L, move D to (2,3)  // since I want to go down\n\nTurn 3: from (2,3), direction D, move D to (2,2) eat food\n\nAfter this, positions [(2,2), (2,3)] head (2,2), tail (2,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (1,2) eat food, so positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] head (1,2), direction L.\n\nTurn 5: from (1,2), can move U or D (since direction L, cannot R, L to wall)\n\nMove U to (1,3) no food, so positions: new head (1,3), body (1,2) moves to? From [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] head (1,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nMove to (1,3), no food: new head (1,3), body (2,2) moves to old head (1,2), tail (2,3) moves to old body (2,2) position? New positions: head (1,3), then body at (1,2) (since (2,2) moved to (1,2)? Old segment (2,2) moves to position of old head (1,2), so at (1,2)\n\nThen segment (2,3) moves to position of old segment (2,2), which was (2,2), so at (2,2)\n\nBut (2,2) was position, so new body at (1,2), new tail at (2,2)\n\nPositions: [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] with head (1,3), body (1,2), tail (2,2)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 6: from (1,3), move R to (2,3) or something.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output up to turn 5 or more.\n\nThe user might expect actions for the immediate turns with the plan.\n\nSince the food life is long, this should be fine.\n\nAnother option: after eating (2,2) on turn 3, instead of moving directly to (1,2), I could go to (3,5) first, but (3,5) is at (3,5), from (2,2) I need to go up and right.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) direction D, move U not possible reverse, so move L to (1,2) or R to (3,2) or U to (2,3) but (2,3) is tail.\n\nPositions [(2,2), (2,3)] head (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nMove U to (2,3): (2,3) is tail, so moving to tail is allowed, no food, so new positions [(2,3), (2,2)] head (2,3), tail (2,2)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (2,3), move U to (2,4), no food, positions [(2,4), (2,3)], etc.\n\nThen to (3,4), (3,5), but (3,4) might be free.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nGoing to (1,2) first is better since it's adjacent.\n\nSo I think the sequence is good.\n\nFor the output, I'll provide actions for turn 1 to turn 5.\n\nTurn 1: move L\n\nTurn 2: move D\n\nTurn 3: move D (to (2,2) eat)\n\nTurn 4: move L (to (1,2) eat)\n\nTurn 5: move U (to (1,3))\n\nThen beyond, but I can stop at turn 5.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks, but in this path, no immediate risks.\n\nWhat about the internal obstacle? (4,6) is not on the path.\n\nAnd walls are borders.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nIf I had eaten (3,5) on turn 1, I might be forced to go to (3,6) which has limited moves, but I could avoid that by moving left or right from (3,5), but still, it delays eating other foods.\n\nSo not optimal.\n\nTherefore, for turn 1, action: L\n\nThen sequence as above.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n**Current State (Turn 1):**\n- **Grid**: 6x6 playable area (x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6) with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Snake**: Single segment (length 1) at head position (3,4), moving Up (U).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,2): Value +1, Life Span 9 (available until turn 9).\n  - (2,2): Value +1, Life Span 9 (available until turn 9).\n  - (3,5): Value +1, Life Span 9 (available until turn 9).\n  - (5,2): Value +1, Life Span 10 (available until turn 10).\n\n**Key Considerations for Long-Term Survival and Score Maximization:**\n- **Immediate Decision (Turn 1)**: The snake can move U (to (3,5) with food), L (to (2,4)), or R (to (4,4)). Moving D is invalid (no instant reverse from current U direction).\n  - Moving U to (3,5) gives +1 score but positions the snake near the top wall (y=6), increasing risk. From (3,5), the only safe immediate moves are L or R (U leads to (3,6), which has limited escape routes and wall collision risk). This delays access to the cluster of food at y=2.\n  - Moving L or R avoids immediate eating but allows the snake to descend toward the dense food cluster at (1,2) and (2,2). Since all food is positive and has long life spans (9-10 turns), prioritizing efficiency is better than rushing the top food.\n- **Food Cluster at Bottom-Left**: (1,2) and (2,2) are adjacent, allowing two foods to be eaten quickly with minimal movement. This is more efficient than targeting isolated food like (5,2) or (3,5) first.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No negative food exists, so all food is safe to eat except for Tail Reward Danger. With the snake short (length 1-3 in the plan), this danger is irrelevant.\n  - The internal obstacle (4,6) is not near the planned path and poses no threat.\n  - Walls are avoided by staying within x=1-6, y=1-6.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turns 1-3**: Head directly to (2,2) by moving L then D twice. Eat (2,2) on turn 3 for +1.\n  - **Turn 4**: Move L to (1,2) and eat for another +1. Snake grows to length 3.\n  - **Turn 5**: Move U to (1,3) to avoid walls and start maneuvering toward remaining food (e.g., (3,5) or (5,2)).\n  - **Beyond Turn 5**: After turn 5, the snake can safely navigate to (3,5) or (5,2) using available life spans. (3,5) is closer (Manhattan distance 3 from (1,3)) and can be eaten by turn 8-9, well within its life span.\n\n**Why this sequence?**\n- **Score Efficiency**: Eats two foods by turn 4 (vs. one food if moving to (3,5) or (5,2) first).\n- **Risk Minimized**: Avoids top row (y=6) where movement is constrained near walls. Path stays in open areas with multiple escape routes.\n- **Life Span Utilization**: All food has high life spans; (3,5) and (5,2) can be targeted after turn 5 without loss.\n- **Direction Constraints Honored**: No instant reverse moves; all actions are valid given the current direction.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe following actions are planned for turns 1 to 5, thinking 5+ turns ahead for survival and score:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: L (left)  \nTurn 2: D (down)  \nTurn 3: D (down)  \nTurn 4: L (left)  \nTurn 5: U (up)  \n} \n\n**Explanation of Each Action:**\n- **Turn 1 (Move L to (2,4))**: Avoids eating (3,5) prematurely. Positions snake closer to (2,2) food cluster. Direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 2 (Move D to (2,3))**: Continues descent toward (2,2). No food eaten; snake remains length 1. Direction changes to D.\n- **Turn 3 (Move D to (2,2))**: Eats food (+1 score), snake grows to length 2. Positions: head (2,2), tail (2,3). Direction changes to D.\n- **Turn 4 (Move L to (1,2))**: Eats adjacent food (+1 score), snake grows to length 3. Positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3). Direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 5 (Move U to (1,3))**: Moves away from walls and toward center grid for flexibility. No food eaten. Positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), tail (2,2). Direction changes to U.\n\n**Next Steps (Beyond Turn 5 for Context):**\n- **Turn 6**: From (1,3), move R to (2,3) (safe, as (2,3) is not occupied).\n- **Turn 7**: Move R to (3,3) to approach (3,5).\n- **Turn 8**: Move U to (3,4).\n- **Turn 9**: Move U to (3,5) to eat food (within life span 9).\n- This path ensures survival and maximizes score by leveraging food density and avoiding high-risk areas. After turn 5, reassess based on food life spans and snake position.",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 2, and the snake is at position (2,4) with direction L, which means it's moving left. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the edges, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, the borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those are walls, so the snake can be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls are specified as border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, internal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: only [(2,4)], so the snake has only one segment? That means it's just the head, no body yet. Snake positions are given as a list, and here it's only one element, so yes, the snake is of length 1, just the head at (2,4).\n\nDirection is L, so it was moving left to get to (2,4), I assume. Since it's the head direction.\n\nNow food positions:\n\n- (1,2) with value 8 and life span 1? That seems odd. Let me read the food format.\n\nIt says: Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ), etc.\n\nIn the input: (1,2,8,1) – I think this means (x,y,value,life_span). So (1,2) with value 8 and life span 1.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5,8,1), (2,2,8,1), (5,2,9,1).\n\nLife span 1 means it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so with life span 1, after this turn (turn 2), it should disappear, meaning it can be eaten only on this turn if the head is on it.\n\nLife span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L on turn T, it will disappear after turn T + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose a food spawns at turn S with life span N. Then on turn S, life span is N. After turn S, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears at the end of that turn. But it can be eaten during the turn when life span >0.\n\nThe rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor example, if life span is 1 on turn T, it means on turn T, it can be eaten, but after turn T, it disappears, so not available on turn T+1.\n\nSimilarly, if life span is 2 on turn T, it can be eaten on turn T and T+1, and disappears after turn T+1.\n\nIn this case, all foods have life span 1 except one with 9? Let's list:\n\n- (1,2): value 8, life span 1\n\n- (3,5): value 8, life span 1\n\n- (2,2): value 8, life span 1\n\n- (5,2): value 9, life span 1? No, it says (5,2,9,1), so value 9, life span 1.\n\nAll have life span 1 except the last one is (5,2,9,1), which I think means x=5,y=2, value=9, life_span=1.\n\nBut it says \"Life-span\" and then \"value\", so (x,y,value,life_span).\n\nIn the input: (1,2,8,1) so (x,y,value,life_span) = (1,2,8,1)\n\nSimilarly, (3,5,8,1) , (2,2,8,1) , (5,2,9,1)\n\nSo all foods have life span 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn, turn 2. So they must be eaten now or never.\n\nBut the snake is at (2,4), and foods are at (1,2), (3,5), (2,2), (5,2). (2,2) is directly below (2,4), since y decreases down? I need to confirm the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in such grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upwards, I think. U (up) is y+1, so higher y is up, lower y is down.\n\nSo current snake head: (2,4)\n\nFoods:\n\n- (1,2): left and down from head\n\n- (3,5): right and up\n\n- (2,2): directly down, same x, y=2\n\n- (5,2): right and down\n\nNow, life span all 1, so only available on this turn, turn 2.\n\nThe snake can move U, D, L, R, but with direction constraint. Current direction is L, so it was moving left. Now, for the next move, it cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Opposite of L is R, so it cannot move right immediately.\n\nPossible moves from (2,4):\n\n- U: (2,5)\n\n- D: (2,3)\n\n- L: (1,4)\n\n- R: (3,4) but cannot because opposite direction? Current direction is L, so moving right would be opposite, so not allowed. So R is invalid.\n\nCannot move opposite on next turn, so from L, cannot go R.\n\nSo valid moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, the foods are only available this turn, so if the snake moves to a food cell, it eats it.\n\nBut the snake has no body, only head, so no collision risk except walls.\n\nAlso, since no body, the \"tail reward danger\" doesn't apply because there is no tail.\n\nSnake positions: only one segment, so no body, no tail.\n\nIf it eats food, positive food, length increases by 1, so after eating, it will have a body.\n\nBut for now, at turn 2, when moving, if it moves to a food cell, it eats it.\n\nPossible moves to food:\n\n- Move L to (1,4): not a food, foods are at (1,2), (3,5), (2,2), (5,2). (1,4) is empty, I assume.\n\n- Move D to (2,3): not food, (2,2) is food but (2,3) is not.\n\n- Move U to (2,5): not food.\n\nNone of the immediate moves land on food. Foods are at (1,2), (2,2), (3,5), (5,2).\n\nFrom (2,4):\n\n- L to (1,4) - empty\n\n- D to (2,3) - empty\n\n- U to (2,5) - empty\n\n- R to (3,4) - but R is invalid, so not possible.\n\nSo no direct move to food this turn. But the foods are at different positions.\n\n(2,2) is directly below, but to reach (2,2), I need to move down twice, but since life span is 1, after this turn, it disappears, so I cannot reach it this turn.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is two steps left and down, etc.\n\nSo for turn 2, I cannot eat any food because no food is adjacent to (2,4) that I can move to.\n\nAdjacent cells: (2,4) neighbors: (2,5) U, (2,3) D, (1,4) L, (3,4) R (invalid).\n\nNone of these have food. Foods are at (1,2), which is not adjacent, (3,5) not adjacent, (2,2) not adjacent ( (2,2) is down two, so not adjacent), (5,2) far away.\n\nSo indeed, on turn 2, the snake cannot eat any food because no food is on an adjacent cell it can move to.\n\nTherefore, for turn 2, I must move to an empty cell: U, D, or L.\n\nAfter moving, since no food eaten, length remains 1.\n\nThen, all foods disappear after turn 2, since life span 1, and turn 2 is current, after turn 2, they are gone.\n\nBut then no food on the board? But the game must continue, I assume new food spawns or something, but the state doesn't say anything about new food spawning. I need to consider that food may spawn later, but for now, after turn 2, no food.\n\nBut the AI needs to think ahead, but with no food, it's just survival, but score doesn't increase.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nLife span: for food at (1,2) with life span 1 on turn 2, it can be eaten on turn 2, and after turn 2, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut since no adjacent food, snake can't eat any this turn.\n\nSo after turn 2, all foods are gone.\n\nThen for future turns, new food might appear, but the problem doesn't specify how food spawns. It only gives the current food state.\n\nIn the context, I think we have to assume that food will spawn at some points, but it's not given. For planning, I need to work with the current state.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns starting from turn 2.\n\nBut with no food, what to do?\n\nPerhaps I misread the food life span.\n\nLet's read the input again.\n\nFood Positions: (1,2,8,1) — (x,y,value,life_span)\n\nLife span 1, on turn 2.\n\nFor example, (5,2,9,1) value 9, life span 1.\n\nBut all have life span 1.\n\nPerhaps the life span is the remaining life, so on turn 2, life span 1 means it has one turn left, so it disappears after this turn.\n\nSo after turn 2, no food.\n\nBut the snake must survive, and new food might appear, but it's not specified.\n\nFor the purpose of this, I think I need to move to a safe position and wait for food, but since no food, score doesn't increase.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score by eating positive food, so I need to be in a position to eat when food appears.\n\nBut I don't know when or where food will appear.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nPerhaps in this state, since no food can be eaten, I just move safely for now.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions.\n\nSnake at (2,4), direction L.\n\nGrid walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area 1 to 6 in x and y? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nNow, from (2,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,5): y=5, within bounds, not wall.\n\n- D to (2,3): y=3, ok.\n\n- L to (1,4): x=1, not wall, since x=0 is wall, x=1 is not.\n\n- R to (3,4): but R is invalid because opposite to L.\n\nSo only U, D, L.\n\nNow, all are safe since no body, only head.\n\nI need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nBut with no food, it's tricky.\n\nPerhaps the life span is misinterpreted.\n\nAnother idea: the food life span might be the total life span, and we need to know when it spawned, but the state doesn't give spawn time, only current life span.\n\nThe input says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" with current values, so life span is the remaining life.\n\nFor example, (1,2,8,1) means at turn 2, this food has life span 1, so it will disappear after turn 2.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo after turn 2, no food.\n\nFor turn 2, I must choose a move: U, D, or L.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, I should choose a move that keeps me safe and central or something.\n\nBut let's see the food at (2,2) for example. If I could reach it, but I can't this turn.\n\nPerhaps for turn 2, I move towards a food, but since I can't eat it, and it disappears, it's useless.\n\nSo I should just move to a safe cell.\n\nThen for turn 3, no food, so I move again, and so on.\n\nBut the answer format requires output for multiple turns, but with no food, it's just moving around.\n\nBut the game might have food spawning later, but it's not specified.\n\nPerhaps I should assume that food will spawn at random or something, but for planning, I need to focus on the current state.\n\nAnother thought: the snake is only one segment, so after moving, if I don't eat, length is still 1.\n\nBut when I eat, I grow.\n\nBut here, no eating on turn 2.\n\nLet's list all food positions clearly:\n\n- Food at (1,2): value 8, life span 1\n\n- Food at (3,5): value 8, life span 1\n\n- Food at (2,2): value 8, life span 1\n\n- Food at (5,2): value 9, life span 1\n\nAll with life span 1 on turn 2.\n\nNone adjacent to (2,4).\n\nSo no eating on turn 2.\n\nAfter turn 2, all food gone.\n\nFor turn 2 action, I choose one of U, D, L.\n\nThen for turn 3, no food, so I move from the new position.\n\nBut I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nPerhaps for the purpose of this problem, since no food can be eaten, I just survive and move.\n\nBut let's see the grid size: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area from (1,1) to (6,6), but internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is wall.\n\nAvailable cells: all (x,y) for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (4,6).\n\nSnake at (2,4).\n\nAfter moving, say to (2,5), then direction is U.\n\nThen from there, I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut with no food, no score increase.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that after this, food may appear, but I don't know where.\n\nTo maximize long-term survival, I should stay in open areas.\n\nFor example, moving to the center might be better.\n\nCurrent position (2,4), y=4 is center, x=2 is left side.\n\nIf I move L to (1,4), I am near the wall, which might be risky if I have a body later.\n\nSimilarly, move U to (2,5), or D to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is closer to some food positions, but food is gone.\n\nSince all food disappears, it doesn't matter.\n\nBut there is food at (2,2) which is below, with value 8, but I can't reach it this turn.\n\nLife span 1, so only this turn.\n\nSo for turn 2, I must move to an empty cell.\n\nLet's choose to move D to (2,3), for example, to go towards the area where food was, but it's gone.\n\nOr move U to (2,5), away.\n\nBut (2,5) is closer to (3,5), but (3,5) is food, but I can't reach it.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (3,5) is not adjacent, it's diagonal, not possible in one move.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for the next turns, I need to plan without food.\n\nBut the AI should think about potential food spawns, but it's not specified.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the life span is not 1, but let's read the input again.\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1,2,8,1) - (3,5,8,1) - (2,2,8,1) - (5,2,9,1)\"\n\nAnd \"Current Turn: t1=2\"\n\nSo on turn 2, life span 1 for all, so they disappear after turn 2.\n\nUnless \"life span\" means something else, but from the rules, it seems clear.\n\nPerhaps for the food at (2,2), it is under the snake? Snake is at (2,4), not at (2,2), so no.\n\nThe rule says \"Food can spawn under the snake's body\", but here snake has no body, only head, and head is at (2,4), food at (2,2) is not under it.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nI think I have to accept that on turn 2, no food can be eaten, so I move to an empty cell.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, with no food, I just move safely.\n\nBut when food appears, I need to be ready, but since it's not specified, for the answer, I can output moves for a few turns assuming no food or something.\n\nPerhaps in the context, new food spawns at some point, but for now, I'll focus on the current state.\n\nLet's look at the food values: most are 8, one is 9 at (5,2), but all life span 1.\n\nBut I can't reach any.\n\nSo for turn 2, I choose a move.\n\nLet's say I move D to (2,3), so new position (2,3), direction D.\n\nThen turn 3, from (2,3), I can move U, D, L, R, but current direction D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n\nSo valid moves: D, L, R.\n\nCells: D to (2,2), but (2,2) had food, but after turn 2, it's gone, so empty.\n\nL to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\nAll empty.\n\nSay I move D to (2,2), but no food there now.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved to (2,2) on turn 2, but I couldn't because not adjacent in one move.\n\nOn turn 2, from (2,4), I can only move to adjacent cells, not to (2,2).\n\nSo for turn 2, action: D to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 3, from (2,3), direction D, can move D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\nSay move to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 4, from (2,2), direction D, can move D to (2,1), but y=1, is it wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is not wall, it's playable.\n\nSimilarly, L to (1,2), R to (3,2), U to (2,3) but U is opposite to D, so invalid if current direction is D.\n\nCurrent direction after moving D to (2,2) is D, so cannot move U.\n\nSo valid: D, L, R.\n\nD to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this seems pointless without food.\n\nPerhaps I misread the food life span.\n\nLet's read the input carefully: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1,2,8,1) - (3,5,8,1) - (2,2,8,1) - (5,2,9,1)\"\n\nAnd \"Current Turn: t1=2\"\n\nBut in the food list, it's written as (1,2,8,1), which is (x,y,value,life_span).\n\nLife span 1 on turn 2.\n\nBut for the food at (2,2), it is at (2,2), snake at (2,4), so not the same cell.\n\nUnless the snake is on (2,2), but it's not.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the snake position is not just the head; it says \"Snake Positions: [(2,4)]\", which is a list with one element, so only head.\n\nDirection L.\n\nI think I have to proceed.\n\nPerhaps the life span is the total life, and it decreases, but with life span 1, it's only for this turn.\n\nBut let's check the value; all values are positive, no negative food here.\n\nAll food has value 8 or 9, so positive.\n\nBut unavailable.\n\nSo for turn 2, I need to choose a move.\n\nTo think ahead, I should move to a position where I can have more options later.\n\nFor example, moving to the center.\n\nCurrent (2,4), x=2, y=4.\n\nGrid x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so center is around (3.5,3.5), so (3,4) or (4,4) etc.\n\nBut I can't move R to (3,4) because opposite direction.\n\nSo I can move U to (2,5), D to (2,3), or L to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is near left wall, (2,5) near top, (2,3) is better, y=3 is more central.\n\ny from 1 to 6, so y=3 or 4 is center, x=2 is left.\n\nMoving D to (2,3) keeps x, y decreases.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nOr move L to (1,4), then I am at edge.\n\nMove U to (2,5), y=5, near top wall.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), but not affecting now.\n\nSo moving D to (2,3) seems reasonable, towards the center in y-direction.\n\nThen for turn 2, action: D\n\nThen on turn 3, position (2,3), direction D, so can move D, L, R.\n\nCells: D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\nAll empty.\n\nSay I move R to (3,3), to go towards center.\n\nThen new position (3,3), direction R.\n\nThen turn 4, from (3,3), can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move L (opposite to R).\n\nSo valid: U, D, R.\n\nU to (3,4), D to (3,2), R to (4,3).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut still no food.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can output a few moves.\n\nBut the AI should think 5+ turns ahead, but with no food, it's about positioning.\n\nBut when food spawns, I can eat.\n\nSince it's not specified, I'll assume that for now, I just move to stay alive.\n\nBut let's see if there's a mistake.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (2,2) has life span 1, but if the snake was on it, but it's not.\n\nOr perhaps for the next turns.\n\nI think I have to accept it.\n\nPerhaps the life span is not 1; let's read the input again.\n\n\" (1,2,8,1) \" and it says \"Life-span\" in the description, so life span 1.\n\nBut in the list, for (5,2,9,1), value 9, life span 1.\n\nBut all the same.\n\nPerhaps the value is the life span or something, but no, it says value and life span.\n\nFor example, (1,2,8,1) means value 8, life span 1.\n\nI think I should proceed with the move.\n\nSo for turn 2, I'll move D to (2,3).\n\nThen for turn 3, from (2,3), direction D, I can move to (3,3) for example.\n\nBut let's think about the grid.\n\nWalls: borders and (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is occupied, so when moving near there, avoid.\n\nBut not now.\n\nAlso, for long-term, avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go to (1,4), it might be a dead end if I have body.\n\nBut now no body, so ok.\n\nSo I think moving D is fine.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output actions for turn 2,3,4,etc.\n\nBut how many turns? The answer format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I need to plan for at least 5 turns from now.\n\nTurn t1=2, so turns 2,3,4,5,6,7 at least.\n\nBut with no food, I can just move in a way that keeps me safe.\n\nFor example, from (2,4) move D to (2,3) on turn 2.\n\nTurn 3: from (2,3), direction D, move R to (3,3) (new direction R)\n\nTurn 4: from (3,3), direction R, can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2), or R to (4,3). Say move U to (3,4) to go up.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,4), direction U, can move U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4), cannot move D.\n\n(3,5) is a food position, but food is gone, so empty.\n\nMove to (3,5).\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5), direction U, can move U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5), cannot move D.\n\nU to (3,6): y=6, but walls at y=7, so y=6 is playable, not wall.\n\nMove to (3,6).\n\nTurn 7: from (3,6), direction U, can move U to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid. L to (2,6), R to (4,6), but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid. D to (3,5) but D is opposite to U, invalid.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nValid moves: U, L, R.\n\nU to (3,7): y=7 is wall, so collision, deadly, cannot move there.\n\nL to (2,6): x=2,y=6, not wall, ok.\n\nR to (4,6): (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (2,6).\n\nSo on turn 7, must move L to (2,6).\n\nBut this is forced.\n\nFrom turn 5, when at (3,4), if I move U to (3,5), then at (3,5), then turn 6 move U to (3,6), then turn 7 only L to (2,6).\n\nAt (2,6), direction L (since moved L from (3,6)? On turn 6 from (3,5) to (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 7 from (3,6) move L to (2,6), so new position (2,6), direction L.\n\nThen turn 8, from (2,6), direction L, can move L to (1,6), D to (2,5), U to (2,7) but y=7 wall, invalid, R to (3,6) but R opposite to L, invalid.\n\nValid: L, D.\n\nL to (1,6), D to (2,5).\n\n Etc.\n\nBut I ended up near the top-left corner, which might be risky with a body.\n\nBut since no body now, it's ok, but for future, better to stay central.\n\nSo for turn 4, from (3,3), instead of moving U, I could move to (3,2) or something.\n\nLet's think from the beginning.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,4) move D to (2,3)  // down to (2,3), direction D\n\nTurn 3: from (2,3) move R to (3,3)  // right to (3,3), direction R\n\nTurn 4: from (3,3) move U to (3,4)  // up to (3,4), direction U\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,4) move R to (4,4)  // right to (4,4), direction R (since from (3,4) to (4,4) is R? From (3,4) to (4,4) is east, so R.\n\nCurrent direction was U from previous, but after moving to (4,4), the direction is R.\n\nLet's clarify direction.\n\nWhen the snake moves to a cell, the new head direction is the direction it moved from previous position.\n\nFor example, at turn 2 start, position (2,4), direction L.\n\nAfter moving D, new position (2,3), new direction D.\n\nThen from (2,3) move R to (3,3), new position (3,3), new direction R.\n\nThen from (3,3) move U to (3,4), new position (3,4), new direction U.\n\nThen from (3,4) move R to (4,4), new position (4,4), new direction R.\n\nThen turn 6: from (4,4), direction R, can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4), cannot move L.\n\nSay move U to (4,5).\n\nNew position (4,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5), direction U, can move U to (4,6), but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid. L to (3,5), R to (5,5), D to (4,4) but D opposite, invalid.\n\nValid: L or R.\n\nSay move L to (3,5).\n\nPosition (3,5), direction L.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,5), direction L, can move L to (2,5), D to (3,4), U to (3,6), cannot move R.\n\nU to (3,6), position (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 9: from (3,6), direction U, can move U to (3,7) wall, L to (2,6), R to (4,6) wall, D to (3,5) opposite, so only L to (2,6).\n\nAgain, similar issue.\n\nTo avoid that, from (4,5), on turn 7, move R to (5,5) instead of L.\n\nThen at (5,5), direction R (since moved R from (4,5)? From (4,5) to (5,5) is R, so direction R.\n\nThen turn 8: from (5,5), direction R, can move R to (6,5), U to (5,6), D to (5,4), cannot move L.\n\nR to (6,5) near right wall, U to (5,6), D to (5,4).\n\nSay move D to (5,4).\n\nPosition (5,4), direction D.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBetter to stay away from walls.\n\nFor turn 2, instead of moving D, move L to (1,4).\n\nThen at (1,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 3: from (1,4), direction L, can move L to (0,4) but x=0 wall, invalid; D to (1,3), U to (1,5), cannot move R.\n\nValid: U or D.\n\nSay move D to (1,3).\n\nPosition (1,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 4: from (1,3), direction D, can move D to (1,2), L to (0,3) wall invalid, R to (2,3), cannot move U.\n\nValid: D or R.\n\nD to (1,2), position (1,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 5: from (1,2), direction D, can move D to (1,1), L to (0,2) wall invalid, R to (2,2), cannot move U.\n\nValid: D or R.\n\nD to (1,1), position (1,1), direction D.\n\nThen at corner, risky.\n\nMove R to (2,2) on turn 4 or 5.\n\nBut still near edge.\n\nSo moving to (1,4) is worse.\n\nMoving U to (2,5) on turn 2.\n\nPosition (2,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 3: from (2,5), direction U, can move U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5), cannot move D.\n\nU to (2,6), position (2,6), direction U.\n\nTurn 4: from (2,6), direction U, can move U to (2,7) wall invalid, L to (1,6), R to (3,6), cannot move D.\n\nValid: L or R.\n\nSay move R to (3,6), position (3,6), direction R.\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,6), direction R, can move R to (4,6) but (4,6) wall, invalid; U to (3,7) wall invalid; D to (3,5), cannot move L.\n\nValid: only D to (3,5).\n\nPosition (3,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 6: from (3,5), direction D, can move D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5), cannot move U.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAgain, not great.\n\nSo moving D to (2,3) initially seems better, as it keeps me lower and more central.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (3,3), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut with the internal wall at (4,6), it might block the top-right.\n\nTo maximize options, moving to (3,3) is good.\n\nSo for turn 2, action D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 3, action R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4, from (3,3), direction R, can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2), R to (4,3)\n\nSay move U to (3,4) to go up.\n\nTurn 5, from (3,4), direction U, can move U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\nSay move R to (4,4) to go right.\n\nTurn 6, from (4,4), direction R, can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4)\n\nSay move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7, from (4,5), direction U, can move U to (4,6) wall, L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\nMove R to (5,5) to avoid wall.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a plan.\n\nBut since no food, no score, but survival is key.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output for turn 2 to say turn 7.\n\nBut the AI should prioritize long-term survival, so moving to open areas is good.\n\nPerhaps there is a food that can be eaten later, but all disappear after turn 2.\n\nUnless the life span is longer for some.\n\nLook at the food: (5,2,9,1) has value 9, life span 1, same as others.\n\nAll life span 1.\n\nI think I have to go with it.\n\nSo for turn 2, I'll move D.\n\nThen the actions.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, for the first turn, turn 2, action.\n\nThen turn 3, etc.\n\nSince the snake is short, no risk, so any move is safe.\n\nBut to be specific.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards the high-value food, but it's at (5,2), which is far, and life span 1, so not possible.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nTurn 2: D (down) to (2,3)\n\nTurn 3: R (right) to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4: U (up) to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5: R (right) to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6: U (up) to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: R (right) to (5,5)  // since U to (4,6) is wall, so from (4,5) move R to (5,5)\n\nFrom (4,5), after moving U to (4,5) on turn 6, direction U.\n\nThen turn 7, from (4,5), direction U, can move L to (3,5), R to (5,5), not U or D.\n\nMove R to (5,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 8, from (5,5), direction R, can move R to (6,5), U to (5,6), D to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut for 5 turns ahead from turn 2, up to turn 7.\n\nTurn 2 to turn 7 is 6 turns, but the thinking is 5+ turns ahead, so output for a few turns.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the state, the food at (2,2) might be eatable if the snake moves down, but on turn 2, from (2,4) to (2,3) is not eating, and on turn 3, if I move D to (2,2), but food is gone.\n\nUnless the life span decreases after the turn or something.\n\nThe rule: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn 2, life span 1, it can be eaten during turn 2, but after that, it disappears.\n\nSo on turn 3, no food.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo I'll go with the plan.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 2 and Beyond\n\n**Current State (Turn 2):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (2,4), no body segments (length 1).\n- **Direction**: Moving left (L).\n- **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Food**: All food has life span 1 and will disappear after this turn. Positions:\n  - (1,2): value 8, life span 1\n  - (3,5): value 8, life span 1\n  - (2,2): value 8, life span 1\n  - (5,2): value 9, life span 1\n\n**Immediate Constraints on Turn 2:**\n- No food is adjacent to the snake head (at (2,4)). Adjacent cells are:\n  - Up: (2,5) – empty\n  - Down: (2,3) – empty\n  - Left: (1,4) – empty\n  - Right: (3,4) – invalid (opposite direction to current L)\n- Cannot eat any food this turn due to no adjacent access; all food disappears after Turn 2.\n- Valid moves: U (up to (2,5)), D (down to (2,3)), L (left to (1,4)).\n- Since the snake has no body, no collision risks exist except walls. Survival is prioritized, so move to a central area for flexibility.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- After Turn 2, no food is present. Maximizing score requires being positioned to eat future food (not specified, but assumed to spawn randomly).\n- Avoid walls and internal obstacles; stay in open areas (center of grid: x=3-4, y=3-4) to maximize movement options.\n- Current position (2,4) is left-of-center. Move down to (2,3) on Turn 2 to approach the y-center, then right toward the grid center.\n- From Turn 3 onward, move to maintain central positioning and avoid dead ends (e.g., near walls or (4,6)).\n- Direction constraints must be respected each turn (no instant reverse).\n- No food until it spawns, so focus on survival and positioning.\n\n**Planned Actions (Turns 2-7):**\n- **Turn 2: Move D (down)** to (2,3). Reason: Moves toward y-center, avoids edges, and allows future right/left movement. Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 3: Move R (right)** to (3,3). Reason: Heads toward grid center (x=3-4,y=3-4), direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 4: Move U (up)** to (3,4). Reason: Adjusts to y-center; avoids moving down toward bottom wall. Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 5: Move R (right)** to (4,4). Reason: Continues to grid center; positions near open areas for future food access. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 6: Move U (up)** to (4,5). Reason: Avoids potential dead ends; moves away from bottom wall. Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 7: Move R (right)** to (5,5). Reason: From (4,5), moving up to (4,6) is blocked (wall), and left to (3,5) is less central. Moving right keeps options open and avoids walls. Direction becomes R.\n\n**Path Visualization (Grid: x=1-6, y=1-6, obstacle at (4,6)):**\n- Turn 2: (2,4) → (2,3) [D]\n- Turn 3: (2,3) → (3,3) [R]\n- Turn 4: (3,3) → (3,4) [U]\n- Turn 5: (3,4) → (4,4) [R]\n- Turn 6: (4,4) → (4,5) [U]\n- Turn 7: (4,5) → (5,5) [R]\n\nThis path keeps the snake in central, open areas, minimizing wall risk and maximizing future food opportunities. Beyond Turn 7, continue moving to stay central (e.g., from (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), or R to (6,5) if safe).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: D \\\\\nTurn 3: R \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: R \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 3, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). The snake has only one segment? Snake positions are given as [(2,3)], which is just the head. But that can't be right because snakes have length; maybe it's a single cell snake? Let me check.\n\nSnake positions: [(2,3)]. That's one position. So, the snake is of length 1 at position (2,3). Head direction is D (down). Food positions: there are four food items:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (3,5) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (2,2) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (5,2) with value 1 and life span 8\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1, and they all increase length by 1 when eaten.\n\nSince the snake is length 1, there is no body to worry about yet. Also, no tail collision issues since there's no tail.\n\nThe grid size: from walls, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x=0 to x=7 is 8 cells, similarly y=0 to y=7 is 8 cells. But walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n\nBorder cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7 are walls. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Internal obstacle at (4,6), which is also a wall.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n\nx=1 to x=6, that's 6 cells? x=1,2,3,4,5,6. Similarly y=1 to 6. But (4,6) is an obstacle, so not playable.\n\nNow, snake is at (2,3), head direction down.\n\nI need to plan 5+ turns ahead. So for turn 3,4,5,6,7,8, etc., but since food has life span, I should consider up to turn 10 or so to account for food disappearing.\n\nCurrent turn t=3.\n\nFood life spans:\n\n- (1,2): life span 7, so disappears after turn 7? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 3, life span 7 means it has 7 turns left including this one, so it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify the life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1? For example, at turn t, life span N, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone on turn t+N.\n\nStandard way: if countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t with life span L, it has L turns left, including turn t. So after L turns, it disappears. For example, if L=1, it disappears after this turn; if L=2, it lasts this turn and next, etc.\n\nIn this case, all food has life span 7 or 8 at turn 3.\n\n- (1,2): value 1, life span 7 at turn 3 → present from turn 3 to turn 9 (since 3+7-1=9? Let's think).\n\nTurn 3: life span 7, so it has 7 turns to live: turns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Gone after turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5): life span 7, present turns 3 to 9.\n\n(2,2): life span 7, turns 3 to 9.\n\n(5,2): life span 8, so turns 3 to 10 (since 8 turns from turn 3: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).\n\nNow, snake is at (2,3), head direction down. Since it's moving down, possible moves: from (2,3), moving down would be to (2,2), but (2,2) has food? Let's see.\n\nAvailable moves from (2,3):\n\n- Up: (2,4) but y=4, within 1-6, but direction is down, so moving up might be opposite? But the rule is \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is down, so I cannot move up immediately.\n\nDirections: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nCurrent head direction: D (down).\n\nSo, from (2,3), moving:\n\n- U: (2,4) - but this is opposite to down? Down is decreasing y, up is increasing y, so yes, opposite.\n\nCurrent direction D, so moving U would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nMoving L: (1,3)\n\nMoving R: (3,3)\n\nMoving D: (2,2)\n\nNow, (2,2) has food, as per the list: (2,2,7,1) is food.\n\nBut moving to (2,2) would eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n\nSince snake is length 1, no body issues.\n\nAlso, (2,2) is not a wall; walls are borders and (4,6), so (2,2) should be free except for the food.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves from (2,3):\n\n- U: (2,4) - but reverse not allowed, so invalid.\n\n- D: (2,2) - valid, and has food.\n\n- L: (1,3) - valid, no food mentioned, but is it within bounds? x=1, y=3, x=1 is not wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so x=1 is playable, y=3 playable. (1,3) not in food list, so empty.\n\n- R: (3,3) - valid, no food, empty.\n\nAlso, (1,2) has food, but not adjacent directly; adjacent cells from (2,3) are (2,4) U, (2,2) D, (1,3) L, (3,3) R.\n\n(1,2) is diagonal? Not directly adjacent; to go to (1,2), I need to move left then down or something.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is far, (5,2) far.\n\nNow, since I need to maximize score, I should eat food when possible.\n\nBut also avoid risks and think long-term.\n\nCurrently, moving to (2,2) would eat the food at (2,2).\n\nIf I eat it, snake grows to length 2.\n\nThen, the head is at (2,2), and tail is at (2,3) for that moment, but when I move to (2,2), I eat, so new head at (2,2), and since length increases, the tail stays at (2,3)? Let's see the movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, if it eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so snake grows by one.\n\nIf not, head moves to new cell, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (2,2) and eat, head is at (2,2), and body is at (2,3). Snake positions: head (2,2), body (2,3).\n\nThen, from there, I can move.\n\nBut (2,2) is now occupied by head, so no issue.\n\nNow, the food at (2,2) is eaten, so it disappears.\n\nNow, other food: (1,2) is adjacent to (2,2)? (2,2) to (1,2) is left move.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) to (1,2) is possible if I move left.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst decision: at turn 3, from (2,3) with direction down.\n\nPossible actions: D to (2,2) eat food, or L to (1,3), or R to (3,3).\n\nMoving U not allowed.\n\nNow, if I move D to (2,2), I eat and grow to length 2.\n\nThen turn 4, from (2,2), direction was down to get there, so current direction D.\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: (2,3) - but (2,3) is now the tail, so moving there might be risky? But since tail will move, it might be ok, depending on where I go next.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": only if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is at (2,3), no food.\n\nSo, from (2,2), direction D (since I moved down to get there).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (2,3) - to tail cell. Since tail will move, it should be safe, as long as after move, head and tail don't collide, but since tail moves, it should be ok.\n\n- D: (2,1) - y=1, playable.\n\n- L: (1,2) - and (1,2) has food!\n\n- R: (3,2) - no food.\n\nIf I move L to (1,2), I eat the food there, since it's positive.\n\nThen snake grows to length 3, head at (1,2), body: (2,2) and (2,3)? When I move from (2,2) to (1,2), I eat, so head at (1,2), and tail remains, so body segments: (2,2) and (2,3). But (2,3) is the tail, (2,2) is the first body segment.\n\nSnake positions after eating: head at (1,2), then body at (2,2), and tail at (2,3).\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move.\n\nBut (1,2) is near the wall? x=1, y=2, not wall, since walls are x=0, y=0, etc.\n\nx=1 is not wall.\n\nNow, back to turn 3.\n\nIf I don't eat at (2,2), I could go left or right.\n\nBut (2,2) has food, and it's positive, so eating it gives +1 and growth.\n\nSince no immediate risk, I should eat it.\n\nMoreover, not eating might miss the opportunity, and food might disappear later, but it has life span to turn 9, so plenty of time.\n\nBut why not eat now?\n\nI could go to (1,3) or (3,3), but no food there, so no point.\n\n(1,3) is empty, (3,3) empty.\n\nBut (1,2) is below (1,3), so from (1,3) I could move down to (1,2) to eat, but that might take an extra turn.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3), I could go to other places.\n\nBut since (2,2) is directly below, I can eat now with no risk.\n\nAlso, after eating, I can go to (1,2) next turn to eat another food.\n\nSo let's simulate.\n\nPlan for turn 3: Move D to (2,2), eat food.\n\nNow, snake positions: head at (2,2), body: since length was 1, now length 2, so positions: [(2,2), (2,3)] head first, so head (2,2), tail (2,3).\n\nHead direction: I moved down to (2,2), so current direction D.\n\nTurn 4: from (2,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (2,3) - which is the tail. Moving to tail cell is safe because tail will move away. After move, head at (2,3), but tail was at (2,3) and will move, but when head moves to (2,3), since it's the tail, and tail moves, but the cell is now head, and tail moves to where? Let's think carefully.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail moves away.\n\nIf I move head to the current tail position, since tail will move to the previous position of the segment before it, which is (2,2) in this case? Positions: head (2,2), tail (2,3).\n\nIf I move head up to (2,3), which is tail.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (2,3), but (2,3) was tail, so now head is at (2,3), and since no food eaten, tail moves to where? The body segment at (2,2) moves to the previous head position? Snake positions: before move, segments: index 0: head (2,2), index 1: tail (2,3).\n\nMove head to (2,3). Since (2,3) was occupied by tail, and head moves there, but tail needs to move. Since no growth, the tail segment is removed, and the new tail is the segment that was before it, but there's only one body segment.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,3), the new head is at (2,3), and the body segment at (2,2) becomes the new tail? Let's see.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo before move: segment 0: (2,2) head, segment 1: (2,3) tail.\n\nHead moves to new position, say (x,y).\n\nIf (x,y) is not food, then the tail is removed, and each body segment moves to the position of the segment ahead.\n\nSpecifically: new head at (x,y), then segment 1 (which was tail) moves to where segment 0 was, but segment 0 was head, so segment 1 moves to (2,2)? Positions:\n\nAfter head moves to new cell, the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1 for i>0.\n\nSo for i=1, it moves to where i=0 was.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to (2,3), which was where tail was.\n\nThen, after move: new head at (2,3), and the segment that was at (2,2) moves to where? The body segments shift: the first body segment (which was at (2,2)) moves to the previous head position, but head position changed.\n\nGeneral: when head moves to a new cell, the body follows, so the segment that was at head position becomes the new neck, and so on, tail is removed if no growth.\n\nSpecifically: if no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo before move: positions: [ (2,2) head, (2,3) tail ]\n\nHead moves to (2,3). (2,3) was the tail position.\n\nAfter move: the head is now at (2,3). The body segment that was at (2,2) moves to the position where the head was, but head was at (2,2), so it moves to (2,2)? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard: the snake is a list of segments. When moving, the head is added at the new position, and if no food eaten, the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo for a snake of length L, positions: S0, S1, ..., S_{L-1} where S0 head, S_{L-1} tail.\n\nMove head to new position New.\n\nIf no eat, new positions: [New, S0, S1, ..., S_{L-2}] and S_{L-1} is removed.\n\nIn this case, L=2, positions: S0=(2,2), S1=(2,3)\n\nMove head to (2,3). New head position (2,3).\n\nSince no eat, new positions: [ (2,3), (2,2) ] and S1=(2,3) is removed? S1 is tail.\n\nNew head at New = (2,3), then S0 becomes the new body segment at its position, but S0 was (2,2), so it stays, and tail S1 is removed.\n\nNew positions: head at New = (2,3), and the segment S0 is now at (2,2) as body, but since tail is removed, the new snake has only one segment? Length decreases?\n\nNo: when you add new head, and remove tail, for L=2, positions before: [S0, S1]\n\nAfter: [New, S0] and S1 removed.\n\nSo New head at (2,3), S0 at (2,2) becomes the tail, so new positions: [(2,3), (2,2)] with head (2,3), tail (2,2).\n\nBut (2,3) was where tail was, but now head is there, and tail is at (2,2).\n\nSo the snake has moved, and it's now vertical with head at (2,3), tail at (2,2).\n\nIn terms of collision, since the tail moved away, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to a different cell.\n\nBack to point: moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, from (2,2), moving U to (2,3) is safe.\n\nBut in this position, (2,3) has no food, so it would be an empty move.\n\nOther moves: D to (2,1) - y=1, playable, no food.\n\nL to (1,2) - which has food, so I can eat it.\n\nR to (3,2) - no food.\n\nSo at turn 4, if I am at (2,2) with direction D, I can move L to (1,2) to eat the food there.\n\nThen, after eating, snake grows: head at (1,2), body at (2,2), and previous tail at (2,3) but since I ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3). Length 3.\n\nHead direction: I moved left to (1,2), so direction L.\n\nNow, from (1,2), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nPossible moves: U: (1,3), D: (1,1), L: but x=1, L would be (0,2) which is wall, x=0 is wall, so not possible. R: (2,2) but (2,2) is body, so collision if I move there.\n\n(2,2) is occupied by body, so I cannot move there; it would be collision.\n\nU: (1,3) is empty, I think.\n\nD: (1,1) empty.\n\nR: (2,2) body, not allowed.\n\nL: wall, not allowed.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nIf I move U to (1,3), or D to (1,1).\n\nNow, let's see the food situation.\n\nOther food: (3,5) at (3,5), and (5,2) at (5,2).\n\n(2,2) is eaten, (1,2) eaten if I go there.\n\nIn this path, at turn 4, I eat (1,2).\n\nThen at turn 5, from (1,2), I have to move U or D.\n\nSay I move U to (1,3), then from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut (3,5) is at (3,5), which is a bit far, and (5,2) at (5,2).\n\nAlso, there is internal obstacle at (4,6), but (4,6) is wall, not playable.\n\nNow, back to turn 3 choice.\n\nIf at turn 3, I don't move down to (2,2), but say move left to (1,3).\n\nThen at turn 3, move L to (1,3), no food eaten, so snake still length 1, head at (1,3), direction L (since I moved left).\n\nThen turn 4, from (1,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U: (1,4), D: (1,2) - and (1,2) has food, L: (0,3) wall, not possible, R: (2,3) - which is where I was, but empty now.\n\nSo I can move D to (1,2) to eat food, or U to (1,4), or R to (2,3).\n\nIf I move D to (1,2), eat, grow to length 2, head at (1,2), tail at (1,3)? Positions: after move to (1,2) with eat, head (1,2), body (1,3) since previous position.\n\nPrevious head was at (1,3), move to (1,2) eat, so new head (1,2), body (1,3), tail (1,3)? No: when eat, head moves to new cell, tail doesn't move, so for length 1 to 2, head at (1,2), tail at (1,3).\n\nThen direction from moving down to (1,2), so direction D.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut in this case, I ate (1,2) at turn 4, whereas if I moved down at turn 3, I ate (2,2) at turn 3 and (1,2) at turn 4, so I get two foods faster.\n\nAlso, (2,2) is still there, I can eat it later.\n\nBut if I go to (1,3) first, I might not eat (2,2) immediately.\n\nBut (2,2) has life span to turn 9, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut eating sooner is better to grow and have more mobility.\n\nNow, another food is at (3,5), which is at x=3,y=5.\n\nAnd (5,2) at x=5,y=2.\n\nAlso, internal wall at (4,6), not relevant immediately.\n\nNow, the snake is currently at (2,3), and I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nLet me consider the grid.\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (4,6) is wall.\n\nSo cells: (1,1) to (6,6), minus (4,6).\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (1,2): value 1, life to turn 9\n\n- (2,2): value 1, life to turn 9\n\n- (3,5): value 1, life to turn 9\n\n- (5,2): value 1, life to turn 10\n\nAll positive.\n\nSnake at (2,3), direction down.\n\nOptions for turn 3:\n\n1. Move D to (2,2): eat food, grow to length 2, head at (2,2), tail at (2,3), direction D.\n\nThen turn 4: from (2,2), I can move L to (1,2) to eat another food, since (1,2) is adjacent.\n\nMove L to (1,2), eat, grow to length 3, head at (1,2), body at (2,2), tail at (2,3), direction L.\n\nThen turn 5: from (1,2), as before, I can only move U to (1,3) or D to (1,1), since L wall, R body.\n\nIf I move U to (1,3), then head at (1,3), direction U (since I moved up).\n\nSnake positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), tail (2,2)? After moving from (1,2) to (1,3), no eat, so head to (1,3), body: the segment at (2,2) moves to (1,2)? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 4: positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nMove to (1,3) no eat: new head at (1,3), then body: segment at (2,2) moves to previous head position (1,2), and tail at (2,3) moves to where? Since no eat, tail is removed.\n\nPositions before move: [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ] head to tail.\n\nMove head to (1,3), no eat.\n\nNew positions: head at (1,3), then the first body segment moves to where head was, (1,2), so at (1,2), and the tail segment (2,3) moves to where the first body was? No.\n\nStandard: new head at New, then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo: new head at (1,3)\n\nThen the segment that was at index 1 ( (2,2) ) moves to index 0's old position (1,2)\n\nThen the segment that was at index 2 ( (2,3) ) moves to index 1's old position (2,2)\n\nBut since no growth, we don't add a segment, so the last segment is removed? For length L, after move no eat, new length L, positions: [New, S0, S1, ..., S_{L-2}]\n\nS0 is the old head position.\n\nIn this case, L=3, positions before: S0=(1,2), S1=(2,2), S2=(2,3)\n\nMove head to (1,3), no eat.\n\nNew head: (1,3)\n\nThen S0 becomes body at its position (1,2)\n\nS1 becomes body at its position, but we need to move it to S0's position? No.\n\nAfter head moves to New, the new body segments are the old positions except the tail is removed if no eat.\n\nSo: new positions: [ New, old S0, old S1, ..., old S_{L-2} ] but since no eat, we remove the tail, so for L=3, we have [New, old S0] and old S1 and old S2 are not included? I'm messing up.\n\nBetter to think: the snake moves by adding a new head and removing the tail if no food.\n\nSo positions: add new head at New, remove the tail segment.\n\nTherefore, for L=3, after move no eat, new positions: [New, old head, old body] but old body is the segment after head.\n\nIn list [S0=head, S1=body, S2=tail]\n\nAfter move to New no eat: new head at New, then S0 becomes the neck, S1 becomes the next, and S2 is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [New, S0, S1]\n\nS2 is gone.\n\nIn this case, from [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ] head to tail.\n\nMove head to (1,3), no eat.\n\nNew head at (1,3)\n\nThen S0 = (1,2) becomes body\n\nS1 = (2,2) becomes body\n\nS2 = (2,3) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), body (2,2), so tail at (2,2).\n\nHead at (1,3), tail at (2,2).\n\nThen from (1,3), direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U: (1,4), D: (1,2) but (1,2) is body, collision, L: (0,3) wall, R: (2,3) - is (2,3) occupied? In new positions, cells occupied: (1,3), (1,2), (2,2). (2,3) is empty now.\n\nSo R to (2,3) is possible.\n\nU to (1,4) possible.\n\nD to (1,2) body, not possible.\n\nL wall not possible.\n\nSo from (1,3), I can go U to (1,4) or R to (2,3).\n\nIf I go R to (2,3), then head to (2,3), which was empty, no food, so no eat, then new positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), tail (1,2)? After move to (2,3) no eat, new head (2,3), old head (1,3) becomes body, old body (1,2) becomes tail, old tail (2,2) removed? Positions before move: [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2) ]\n\nMove head to (2,3), no eat.\n\nNew head (2,3)\n\nThen old head (1,3) becomes body at (1,3)\n\nOld body (1,2) becomes body at (1,2)\n\nOld tail (2,2) removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,2) ] head to tail.\n\nTail at (1,2).\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move to other places.\n\nBut this is getting messy.\n\nBack to turn 3, if I eat both (2,2) and (1,2) quickly, I have a snake of length 3 by turn 4.\n\nThen I need to go towards other food.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is up and right.\n\nFrom (1,2) after eating, at turn 5, I can move U to (1,3), then from there to (2,3) or (1,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,2) is already eaten, so not available.\n\nAnother food is at (3,5) and (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is on the bottom row.\n\nAlso, there might be risks of dead ends or something.\n\nSince the snake is small, I should eat the nearby food first to grow.\n\nThe food at (2,2) is very close, so eating it at turn 3 seems best.\n\nThen at turn 4, eat (1,2).\n\nThen at turn 5, from (1,2), I have to move U to (1,3) since D to (1,1) or U, but (1,1) is playable.\n\n(1,1) is bottom-left corner.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can go to (2,3) or (1,4).\n\nNow, to reach (3,5), which is at x=3,y=5.\n\nFrom current position, after turn 5, I might be at (1,3) or (1,4).\n\nLet's plan a path to (3,5).\n\nAlso, (5,2) is at bottom, but it has longer life span, to turn 10.\n\nNow, for long-term, after eating the two foods at left, I can head right and up to (3,5).\n\nFor example, from (1,3) at turn 5 (if I moved U from (1,2)), then at turn 5, from (1,3), I can move R to (2,3), then turn 6 from (2,3) to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (3,5) to eat at turn 8 or so.\n\nLet's calculate turns.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (2,2), eat (2,2), score +1, length 2, positions: head (2,2), tail (2,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (1,2), eat (1,2), score +1, length 3, positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3), direction L.\n\nTurn 5: from (1,2), move U to (1,3) (since D to (1,1) is possible but not towards food, so better U to go up), no eat, positions after move: head to (1,3), no eat, so new head (1,3), body at (1,2), tail at (2,2)? Before move: [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ]\n\nMove head to (1,3) no eat.\n\nNew head (1,3)\n\nOld head (1,2) becomes body\n\nOld body (2,2) becomes body\n\nOld tail (2,3) removed.\n\nSo positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), body (2,2), tail at (2,2).\n\nCells occupied: (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)\n\nFrom (1,3), direction U (moved up).\n\nTurn 6: possible moves from (1,3): U to (1,4), D to (1,2) but (1,2) body, collision, L wall, R to (2,3) - (2,3) is empty, no food.\n\nSo move R to (2,3), no eat.\n\nNew positions: head to (2,3), no eat, so new head (2,3), body at (1,3), tail at (1,2)? Before move: [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2) ]\n\nMove head to (2,3) no eat.\n\nNew head (2,3)\n\nOld head (1,3) becomes body\n\nOld body (1,2) becomes body\n\nOld tail (2,2) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), body (1,2), tail at (1,2).\n\nTail at (1,2).\n\nDirection: from (1,3) moved right to (2,3), so direction R.\n\nTurn 7: from (2,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2) but (2,2) is not occupied? Positions: (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), so (2,2) empty? (2,2) was tail but removed, so empty.\n\nD to (2,2) - possible, no food.\n\nL to (1,3) but (1,3) is body, collision.\n\nR to (3,3) - possible, no food.\n\nU to (2,4) possible.\n\nI want to go to (3,5), so I should go up or right.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), so from (2,3), I can go to (3,3) then to (3,4) then to (3,5).\n\nOr U to (2,4) then to (3,4), etc.\n\nSay move R to (3,3) at turn 7.\n\nFrom (2,3) move R to (3,3), no eat, positions: new head (3,3), body (2,3), tail (1,3)? Before move: [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,2) ]\n\nMove head to (3,3) no eat.\n\nNew head (3,3)\n\nOld head (2,3) becomes body\n\nOld body (1,3) becomes body\n\nOld tail (1,2) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), body (2,3), body (1,3), tail at (1,3).\n\nTail at (1,3).\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3) body, collision, R to (4,3).\n\n(3,4) is on the way to (3,5).\n\nMove U to (3,4), no eat, positions: new head (3,4), body (3,3), tail (2,3)? Before: [ (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) ]\n\nMove to (3,4) no eat: new head (3,4), body (3,3), body (2,3), tail at (2,3).\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 9: from (3,4), move U to (3,5), eat food at (3,5), since it's there.\n\nEat, grow to length 4? Current length 3, eat, so length 4.\n\nPositions: head at (3,5), body at (3,4), body at (3,3), tail at (2,3).\n\nNow, I have eaten three foods: (2,2), (1,2), (3,5).\n\nBut (5,2) is still there, life to turn 10.\n\nNow at turn 9, I am at (3,5), need to go to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move down and right.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (4,6), but (4,6) is wall, not in path.\n\ny=5 to y=2, so down.\n\nBut snake body might be in the way.\n\nPositions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), tail (2,3).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, collision.\n\nU to (3,6) but y=6, y=6 is playable? y=6 is not wall, since walls y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is ok.\n\ny=6 is within 1 to 6.\n\nBut (3,6) might be empty.\n\nL to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\nPossible moves from (3,5): U (3,6), D (3,4) body, not possible, L (2,5), R (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is near obstacle (4,6), but (4,5) is playable.\n\nI need to go to (5,2), so down and right.\n\nBut directly down is blocked by body.\n\nSo I might need to go left or right first to avoid body.\n\nFor example, move R to (4,5) at turn 9? Turn 9 I just ate at (3,5), so at turn 9 end.\n\nTurn 10: from (3,5), after eating, direction U? I moved up to (3,5), so direction U.\n\nTurn 10: from (3,5), move to, say, R to (4,5), no food, positions: new head (4,5), body (3,5), body (3,4), tail (3,3)? Before move: [ (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3) ] length 4.\n\nMove head to (4,5) no eat: new head (4,5), body (3,5), body (3,4), body (3,3), tail (2,3) removed? New positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) ] tail at (3,3).\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,5), move D to (4,4) or something to go down.\n\nBut (5,2) is at (5,2), life span to turn 10, so at turn 10 it is present, turn 11 gone? Life span at turn 3 is 8, so present turns 3 to 10, gone after turn 10, so on turn 10 it is still there, but on turn 11 it is gone.\n\nTurn 10: (5,2) is present.\n\nBut I am at (4,5) on turn 10 end? Turn 10 action.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at (3,5) after eating.\n\nTurn 10: I move from (3,5) to (4,5), but (4,5) is not (5,2), so I don't eat (5,2) yet.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is far.\n\nFrom (4,5) at turn 10, I need to go to (5,2), but it's multiple moves away.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) to (5,5) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2), but that takes turns, and (5,2) disappears after turn 10, so on turn 10 it is there, but I can only eat it if I am on it on turn 10.\n\nOn turn 10, if I can move directly to (5,2), but from (3,5) on turn 10, I cannot reach (5,2) in one move; it's two cells away.\n\nMinimum two moves: e.g., to (4,5) then to (5,5) or something, but (5,2) is at y=2.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (5,2), it's |dx|=2, |dy|=3, so at least 3 moves, but since diagonal not possible, more.\n\nShortest path: e.g., (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2), 5 moves, or shorter (3,5) to (3,4) but body, or (3,5) to (4,5) to (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2) to (5,2), still many.\n\nCannot reach (5,2) from (3,5) in one or two moves; it takes at least 3 moves (e.g., right, down, down, but not direct).\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,2) by turn 10; it will disappear.\n\nIn this plan, I missed (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) has value, so I should try to eat it earlier.\n\nBack to turn 3.\n\nAt turn 3, instead of eating (2,2), I could go towards (5,2).\n\nFor example, move R to (3,3) at turn 3.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go down to (3,2) or to (4,3), etc.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), so from (3,3), I can go to (4,3), (5,3), then (5,2), or directly down if possible.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt turn 3, move R to (3,3), no eat, snake still length 1, head at (3,3), direction R.\n\nTurn 4: from (3,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U (3,4), D (3,2), L (2,3), R (4,3).\n\n(3,2) has no food, but (5,2) is at (5,2).\n\nI can move D to (3,2), then to (4,2), then to (5,2).\n\nOr move R to (4,3), then down, etc.\n\nSay move D to (3,2) at turn 4, no eat.\n\nHead at (3,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,2), move R to (4,2), no food? (4,2) empty, I think.\n\nThen turn 6: from (4,2), move R to (5,2), eat food at (5,2), since life span 8, present at turn 6.\n\nEat, grow to length 2, head at (5,2), tail at (4,2)? Positions: after eat, head (5,2), body (4,2), since previous head at (4,2).\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen I have eaten (5,2) at turn 6.\n\nBut I missed the other foods: (1,2), (2,2), (3,5) are still there, but I can go back.\n\n(1,2) and (2,2) have life to turn 9, (3,5) to turn 9.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can go left to (4,2), but body, or down to (5,1) or up to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut to eat (2,2), I need to go left.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nFor example, from (5,2) at turn 6, move U to (5,3), then to (4,3), etc, to (2,3), then down to (2,2) to eat.\n\nBut (2,2) is at (2,2), and I am at (5,2), so multiple turns.\n\nBut since life span long, possible.\n\nHowever, in the first plan, I ate three foods by turn 9, but missed (5,2).\n\nIn this plan, I eat (5,2) at turn 6, but might eat fewer others.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating sooner is better for growth, but also for score.\n\nBut in terms of risk, with longer snake, more body to avoid.\n\nBut at the beginning, it's fine.\n\nAnother option: at turn 3, I could move to (2,2) and eat, then at turn 4, instead of moving left to (1,2), I could move right or up to go towards (5,2) or (3,5).\n\nFor example, after eating (2,2) at turn 3, at turn 4 from (2,2) with direction D, I can move R to (3,2) instead of L.\n\n(3,2) no food, but then I can go to (4,2), (5,2) to eat (5,2) at turn 6 or earlier.\n\nTurn 4: from (2,2) move R to (3,2), no eat, positions: head to (3,2), tail to (2,2)? After move no eat, length 2, new head (3,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3) removed? Before: head (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nMove to (3,2) no eat: new head (3,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3) removed, so positions [(3,2), (2,2)] tail at (2,2).\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,2), move R to (4,2), no eat, new head (4,2), body (3,2), tail (2,2) removed? New positions: head (4,2), body (3,2), tail at (3,2)? Before move: [ (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nMove to (4,2) no eat: new head (4,2), body (3,2), old tail (2,2) removed, so positions [(4,2), (3,2)] tail at (3,2).\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 6: from (4,2), move R to (5,2), eat food (5,2), grow to length 3, head at (5,2), body at (4,2), tail at (3,2)? After eat, head (5,2), body (4,2), and since ate, tail stays, so body also (3,2), positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), body (3,2), tail at (3,2).\n\nLength 3.\n\nThen I have eaten (2,2) and (5,2), but missed (1,2) and (3,5).\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), I can go left, but body might be in way.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can move to (5,3) or (4,2) body, etc.\n\nTo eat (1,2), need to go to (1,2), which is far.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is up.\n\nBut (1,2) life to turn 9, so I can go there.\n\nFor example, move U to (5,3), then to (5,4), etc, but to go left, I need to go to (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), then down to (1,2).\n\nBut at (1,3), I can move down to (1,2) to eat.\n\nBut many turns.\n\nSimilarly for (3,5).\n\nIn terms of number, eating both (2,2) and (1,2) early gives two foods quickly, and I can still reach (3,5) by turn 9, as in first plan, and (5,2) is missed but it's only one.\n\n(5,2) has same value, but I can't get it in time if I go for others.\n\nBut in first plan, I got three foods by turn 9, in this I got two by turn 6, but (5,2) eaten, so also three, but (3,5) not eaten yet.\n\nIn second plan, by turn 6 I have eaten (2,2) and (5,2), so two foods, length 3.\n\nThen I can go to (3,5).\n\nFrom (5,2) at turn 6, move U to (5,3), turn 7 to (5,4), turn 8 to (5,5), turn 9 to (5,6) or to (4,5), but (3,5) is at (3,5), so from (5,4) move L to (4,4), then to (3,4), then to (3,5) at turn 10, but (3,5) life to turn 9, so on turn 10 it is gone, so I miss it.\n\nIf I go directly, from (5,2) turn 6, to (4,2) but body, or to (5,3) turn 6, then to (4,3) turn 7, to (3,3) turn 8, to (3,4) turn 9, to (3,5) turn 10, but (3,5) gone after turn 9, so on turn 10 not there, so I miss it.\n\nSo I can only eat two foods: (2,2) and (5,2), and miss (1,2) and (3,5).\n\nWhereas in the first plan, I eat (2,2), (1,2), (3,5) by turn 9, so three foods.\n\nBetter to eat the two at left first, then go to (3,5).\n\nAnd (5,2) is too far to reach in time, since from (3,5) at turn 9, I cannot reach (5,2) by turn 10.\n\nSo I should accept that I can't eat (5,2) and focus on the other three.\n\nMoreover, after eating (3,5) at turn 9, I can explore other areas for new food, but since no new food mentioned, perhaps no more food, or I need to survive.\n\nThe state only has these foods, no new spawn mentioned, so I think only these four.\n\nSo maximum score is 3, since (5,2) can't be reached in time.\n\nBut is there a way to eat (5,2) earlier?\n\nFor example, at turn 3, move R to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then to (4,2), (5,2) by turn 6, as before, but then I have only one food eaten, and I need to go to (1,2) or (2,2), but they are far.\n\nFrom (5,2) at turn 6, to (1,2): for example, to (4,2) body, or to (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2) at turn 12, but (1,2) gone after turn 9, so missed.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) gone after turn 9.\n\nSo I can only eat one food if I go directly to (5,2).\n\nNot good.\n\nAt turn 3, move to (2,2) eat, then turn 4 move D to (2,1) or something to go down, but (2,1) no food, then to (3,1), etc to (5,2), but similar issue, I might miss (1,2) and (3,5).\n\nFor example, turn 3: move D to (2,2) eat, length 2.\n\nTurn 4: from (2,2) move D to (2,1), no eat, positions: head to (2,1), body to (2,2), tail (2,3) removed, so [(2,1), (2,2)] tail at (2,2).\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,1) move R to (3,1), no eat, etc, to (5,1), then up to (5,2) at turn 7 or so, eat (5,2), but missed (1,2) and (3,5).\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the best is to eat (2,2) and (1,2) first, then go to (3,5).\n\nNow, in the first plan, at turn 5 after eating (1,2), I moved U to (1,3), but I could move D to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is a corner, might be risky, but no immediate danger.\n\nMoving U to (1,3) is better to go towards center or (3,5).\n\nIn the path to (3,5), I went through (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).\n\nAt turn 6, from (1,3) I moved R to (2,3), which is fine.\n\nBut when I reach (3,5) at turn 9, I eat it.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nCurrent turn t1=3.\n\nI need to provide actions starting from turn 3.\n\nHow many turns? At least 5, but since I have a plan, I can provide up to when I eat the third food or so.\n\nBut the format is to list actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince it says \"...\" I can provide a sequence.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to specify the action for each turn.\n\nAlso, for turn 3, action.\n\nNow, from above, best action is to move D to (2,2) at turn 3.\n\nThen turn 4 move L to (1,2) to eat.\n\nThen turn 5 move U to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 6 move R to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 7 move R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 8 move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 9 move U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 9, when I move to (3,5), I eat the food.\n\nNow, after that, no more food, but I can continue moving to survive, but since no food, score doesn't increase.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions.\n\nIn the positions, after turn 9, head at (3,5), body at (3,4), (3,3), tail at (2,3)? From earlier.\n\nAfter turn 8: I was at (3,4) before turn 9.\n\nLet's list the actions and positions step by step for the sequence.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (2,2) - eat (2,2), positions: head (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nTurn 4: move L to (1,2) - eat (1,2), positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nTurn 5: move U to (1,3) - no eat, positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), body (2,2)  // tail at (2,2)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (2,3) - no eat, positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), body (1,2)  // tail at (1,2)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 7: from (2,3) move R to (3,3) - no eat, positions: head (3,3), body (2,3), body (1,3)  // tail at (1,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3) move U to (3,4) - no eat, positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), body (2,3)  // tail at (2,3)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 9: from (3,4) move U to (3,5) - eat (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), body (3,3), tail (2,3)  // since ate, tail stays\n\nNow, after turn 9, I can stop or continue.\n\nBut the action is for turns starting from t1=3.\n\nI need to output for at least 5 turns, up to turn 8 or so.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should provide a sequence.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns, I can provide 5 actions: turns 3 to 7 or 3 to 8.\n\nBut in turn 9 I eat, so I can include.\n\nTo be safe, let's provide turns 3 to 8, which is 6 turns.\n\nBut turn 8 is included.\n\nt1=3, so turns 3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nAt turn 8, I am at (3,4), moving to (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nBut for the answer, I only need actions, not positions.\n\nNow, about the direction: I need to ensure no reverse moves.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 3: move D (down) from (2,3) to (2,2) - current direction D, move D, ok.\n\nAfter move, direction D.\n\nTurn 4: from (2,2) move L (left) - current direction D, move L is perpendicular, not reverse, so ok. Reverse would be U, but I move L, so fine.\n\nAfter move to (1,2), direction L.\n\nTurn 5: from (1,2) move U (up) - current direction L, move U is perpendicular, ok.\n\nAfter move, direction U.\n\nTurn 6: from (1,3) move R (right) - current direction U, move R perpendicular, ok.\n\nAfter move, direction R.\n\nTurn 7: from (2,3) move R to (3,3) - current direction R, move R same, ok.\n\nAfter move, direction R.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3) move U to (3,4) - current direction R, move U perpendicular, ok.\n\nAll good.\n\nI could include turn 9 move U to (3,5), but not necessary.\n\nSince the food at (5,2) is there, but I can't reach it, no issue.\n\nIn the beginning, I thought about tail reward danger, but not applicable since no tail or food on tail.\n\nSo, for the answer:\n\nTurn 3: D\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nBut I need to output in the boxed format.\n\nAlso, for turn 9, I could add, but 5+ turns, 6 actions are fine.\n\nt1=3, turns to t1+5=8, so 6 turns.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned multiple turns ahead. The snake starts at position (2,3) with direction down (D) at turn 3. The goal is to eat positive food items efficiently while avoiding collisions and considering food life spans. All food has a value of +1 and increases snake length when eaten.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Life Spans**: \n  - (1,2): Present from turn 3 to 9 (life span 7, disappears after turn 9).\n  - (2,2): Present from turn 3 to 9 (life span 7).\n  - (3,5): Present from turn 3 to 9 (life span 7).\n  - (5,2): Present from turn 3 to 10 (life span 8, disappears after turn 10).\n- **Immediate Opportunities**: \n  - (2,2) is directly below the snake at (2,3) and can be eaten on turn 3 by moving down (D).\n  - (1,2) is adjacent to (2,2) and can be eaten on turn 4 by moving left (L) from (2,2).\n  - (3,5) is reachable by turn 9 with a path through (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), and (3,4).\n  - (5,2) is too far to reach by turn 10 without sacrificing other food, as it requires at least 4 moves from the closest point in the plan (e.g., from (3,5) at turn 9, it takes 3+ moves, missing the turn 10 deadline). Thus, it is not feasible to eat (5,2) without missing other opportunities.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - With a short snake initially, collision risks are low. After growth, the body must be avoided, but the path chosen minimizes this (e.g., moving to tail cells is safe as the tail moves away).\n  - No instant reverse moves are allowed, and the plan adheres to this.\n  - Walls and obstacles are avoided; the only internal obstacle at (4,6) is not on the path.\n- **Long-Term Plan (5+ Turns)**: \n  - Eat (2,2) on turn 3 for immediate growth (+1 score, length 2).\n  - Eat (1,2) on turn 4 for another +1 (length 3).\n  - Navigate to (3,5) via (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), and (3,4) to eat it on turn 9 (+1, length 4).\n  - This secures 3 points by turn 9, missing (5,2) due to distance and life span.\n  - After turn 9, no food remains, so focus shifts to survival by avoiding walls and body collisions.\n\n### Action Plan (Turns 3 to 8):\n- **Turn 3 (from (2,3))**: Move down (D) to (2,2) to eat the food there. This is safe, grows the snake, and starts the path toward other food. Direction after move: D.\n- **Turn 4 (from (2,2))**: Move left (L) to (1,2) to eat the adjacent food. Direction after move: L.\n- **Turn 5 (from (1,2))**: Move up (U) to (1,3). This avoids the body at (1,2) and moves toward the center for better mobility. Direction after move: U.\n- **Turn 6 (from (1,3))**: Move right (R) to (2,3). This continues the path toward (3,5) and avoids walls. Direction after move: R.\n- **Turn 7 (from (2,3))**: Move right (R) to (3,3). This approaches (3,5) efficiently. Direction after move: R.\n- **Turn 8 (from (3,3))**: Move up (U) to (3,4). This sets up for eating (3,5) on turn 9. Direction after move: U.\n\nThis sequence eats two food by turn 4 and positions the snake to eat the third by turn 9. All moves comply with movement constraints (no instant reverse) and avoid collisions. Thinking beyond turn 8:\n- Turn 9: Move up (U) from (3,4) to (3,5) to eat the food.\n- Beyond: Survive by navigating open areas (e.g., to (3,6), (4,5), etc.), but no more food is available.\n\nThe plan maximizes score by securing 3 points while ensuring survival through turn 9 and beyond.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: D \\\\\nTurn 4: L \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: R \\\\\nTurn 7: R \\\\\nTurn 8: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 4, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders and an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,2), then body at (2,3). Since there are only two segments, the snake is of length 2. Head direction is down, which is D. That means from (2,2) moving to (2,1) or something? Let's clarify directions.\n\nDirections: U is (x, y+1), D is (x, y-1), L is (x-1, y), R is (x+1, y). So down decreases y.\n\nHead at (2,2) with direction D, so last move was down to (2,2)? Snake positions are given as [(2,2), (2,3)]. Since head is first, (2,2) is head, (2,3) is the body segment.\n\nIf head direction is D, that means it was moving down to reach (2,2). But (2,2) to (2,3) – if head is at (2,2) and direction is D, which is down, that would imply it came from above, so from (2,3) to (2,2)? Positions: [(2,2), (2,3)] means head is (2,2), next segment is (2,3), so the tail is at (2,3).\n\nSince direction is D, down, that means the snake was moving downwards, so from a higher y to lower y. So from (2,3) to (2,2), that makes sense: moved down from (2,3) to (2,2) at some point.\n\nNow, for the next move, I can choose to move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is D, I cannot move U (up) immediately, because that would be reverse. So possible moves from (2,2) are: D (down to (2,1)), L (left to (1,2)), R (right to (3,2)). Cannot move U to (2,3) because that's reverse and also it's occupied by the body, but the rule is no instant reverse, so even if it were empty, I couldn't move up because it's opposite to current direction D.\n\nNo instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to the current direction on the next turn. So from D, I cannot choose U. I can choose D, L, or R.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (3,5) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (5,2) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (6,5) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has positive value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (1,2), life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (1,2), life span 6 at turn 4. So it will disappear after turn 4 + 6 - 1? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t when it spawns, life span N, it will be gone after N turns, meaning it can be eaten up to turn t + N - 1.\n\nRule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nSo for food appearing at turn T with life span N, at turn T, countdown is N, decreases to N-1 at T+1, ..., to 0 at T+N, and disappears at turn T+N+1? I need to clarify.\n\nTypically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n\nBut the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n\nLet me read: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for example, at turn t, food has life span L, countdown starts at L, decreases by 1 each turn.\n\nAfter L decreases, when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo if at turn T, countdown is C, it disappears when C=0 after the decrease.\n\nBut in the state, food is given with life span, which is the current countdown.\n\nIn this case, turn 4, food at (1,2) has life span 6, so countdown=6 at turn 4.\n\nAfter turn 4, countdown becomes 5.\n\nAfter turn 5, countdown=4, ..., after turn 9, countdown=0, and it disappears, so it can be eaten from turn 4 to turn 9? At turn 9, before the move, countdown=1, after move and eating, if head moves to it, it can be eaten, then after that, countdown decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nBut since it's eaten, it's gone anyway.\n\nThe point is, with life span 6 at turn 4, it will be available until turn 4 + 6 - 1 = turn 9? Let's think:\n\n- Turn 4: countdown=6, available\n\n- Turn 5: countdown=5, available\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 9: countdown=1, available\n\n- Turn 10: countdown=0, disappears, not available.\n\nSo last chance to eat is turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,5): life span 6 at turn 4, available until turn 9.\n\n(5,2): life span 7, available until turn 4+7-1=10? Turn 4:7, turn5:6, ..., turn10:1, turn11:0 gone, so until turn 10.\n\nGeneral: available from turn T to T + L - 1, where L is life span at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, life span L, then it can be eaten on turns T, T+1, ..., T+L-1, and disappears at turn T+L.\n\nFor (1,2): L=6 at t=4, can be eaten t=4 to t=9 (6 turns)\n\nt=4,5,6,7,8,9: that's 6 turns, yes.\n\nt=4: available, t=9: available, t=10: gone.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5): L=6 at t=4, available t=4 to 9\n\n(5,2): L=7 at t=4, available t=4 to 10\n\n(6,5): L=10 at t=4, available t=4 to 13\n\nAll have value +1, so all good to eat.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival and score.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so snake cannot go there. Also internal obstacle at (4,6), so cannot go there.\n\nSnake: head at (2,2), body at (2,3). Since length 2, tail is at (2,3).\n\nPossible moves from (2,2):\n\n- D: down to (2,1). But y=0 is wall, so (2,1) is within bounds? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is not wall, but let's see coordinates.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls, similarly x=0 or x=7 are walls.\n\nSo (2,1): x=2 between 1 and 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are free, except internal obstacles.\n\nSimilarly y=1 to y=6.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are free, but internal obstacles.\n\n(2,1): x=2, y=1. y=1 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is free. Similarly, (1,2) etc.\n\nNow, (2,1) is not occupied by wall or obstacle. Is it occupied by snake? Snake is at (2,2) and (2,3), so (2,1) is empty.\n\nBut let's list possible moves:\n\nFrom head (2,2):\n\n- D: down to (2,1). Is this valid? (2,1): not wall, not snake body except tail, but tail will move.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,2), body (2,3). If I move down to (2,1), new head will be (2,1), and the body will move: the segment at (2,3) will move to where the head was, (2,2), so new positions: [(2,1), (2,2)].\n\nNo collision because the tail moves away.\n\n- L: left to (1,2). (1,2) is not wall, not snake, so ok. New positions: head (1,2), body (2,2)? Current positions: head (2,2), body (2,3). After moving left to (1,2), head is (1,2), then the body segment moves to previous head position (2,2), so new snake: [(1,2), (2,2)].\n\n- R: right to (3,2). (3,2) is free? x=3, y=2. Not wall, not snake. New head (3,2), body moves to (2,2), so [(3,2), (2,2)].\n\nCannot move U to (2,3) because it's reverse and also occupied.\n\nNow, there is food at (1,2), which is directly left of head.\n\nIf I move L to (1,2), I eat the food there.\n\nFood at (1,2) has value +1, life span 6.\n\nIf I eat it, snake grows: since positive food, length increases by one.\n\nSo from length 2, after eating, length 3.\n\nNew positions: head moves to (1,2), which has food, so it eats, then the body: the tail doesn't move? Rule: when eating, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays for that turn.\n\nSnake growth: after moving head to food cell, the tail does not move, so snake gains one segment.\n\nIn this case, current snake: positions [(2,2), (2,3)]\n\nAfter moving to (1,2) and eating: head is (1,2), and since we ate, we add a new segment at the previous tail position, so the body becomes (2,2) and (2,3) stays, so new snake: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nSimilarly, if no eat, tail moves.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nI need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there is a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (2,3), head is at (2,2). Are they adjacent? (2,2) and (2,3) are adjacent vertically.\n\nBut the food is at (1,2), not on the tail. Tail cell is (2,3), which has no food, I think. Food is only at the positions listed: (1,2), (3,5), etc., not at (2,3), so no issue.\n\nNow, for turn 4, I need to choose action.\n\nPossible actions: L, D, R.\n\nIf I move L, I eat the food at (1,2) immediately.\n\nBut I should think long-term.\n\nThere are other foods: (3,5) is north-east, (5,2) is east, (6,5) is east-north.\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5, (5,2) at x=5,y=2, (6,5) at x=6,y=5.\n\nSince head at (2,2), moving L to (1,2) eats food, but then I'm at (1,2) with longer snake.\n\nMoving R to (3,2) or D to (2,1).\n\n(3,2) is empty, no food.\n\n(2,1) empty.\n\nAfter that, I need to go to other foods.\n\nBut let's think about the grid.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7 walls, and (4,6) obstacle.\n\nSo the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is occupied, so cannot go there.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I need to eat as much food as possible while surviving.\n\nBut with only two segments, it's easy to move, but after eating, snake grows, harder to maneuver.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nRows y from 1 to 6, columns x from 1 to 6.\n\ny=1 bottom, y=6 top? Directions: U increases y, D decreases y, so y=1 is down, y=6 is up, I think. In coordinates, (x,y), U (x,y+1) so increasing y is up, decreasing y is down.\n\nSo y=1 is south, y=6 is north.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 west, x=6 east.\n\nBut walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so boundaries.\n\nNow, snake head (2,2), body (2,3) so at y=2 and y=3, x=2.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (1,2): west of head, value 1, life until turn 9\n\n- (3,5): east-north, at (3,5), life until turn 9\n\n- (5,2): east, at (5,2), life until turn 10\n\n- (6,5): east-north, at (6,5), life until turn 13\n\nAll have plenty of life, so no immediate rush except that (1,2) is right next to me.\n\nBut if I eat (1,2), I grow to length 3, and I'm at (1,2), which is corner, x=1,y=2.\n\nx=1 is not wall, but adjacent to x=0 wall.\n\nFrom (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1), R to (2,2) but (2,2) will be body after move? After moving to (1,2) and eating, snake is [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nSo positions: head (1,2), segment (2,2), segment (2,3)\n\nFrom (1,2), I can move U to (1,3), but (1,3) is empty, or D to (1,1), or R to (2,2), but (2,2) is the body segment, so if I move to (2,2), head touches body, collision, death.\n\nCannot move to a cell occupied by body.\n\nAfter the move, when head moves, if it moves to a body cell, it collides.\n\nIn this case, from (1,2), moving R to (2,2) would be moving to the body segment at (2,2), so instant death.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (0,2) but x=0 is wall, cannot.\n\nMoving U to (1,3) or D to (1,1).\n\n(1,3) is empty, but y=3, x=1.\n\n(2,3) is body, so (1,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly (1,1) free.\n\nBut if I move U to (1,3), new head (1,3), then body moves: since no eat, tail moves away.\n\nAfter moving U to (1,3), head to (1,3), body from (2,2) to (1,2)? Positions: current [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nHead moves to (1,3), so new head (1,3), then body segments move: first segment (2,2) moves to previous head position (1,2)? No.\n\nThe body follows: the segment that was behind head moves to where head was.\n\nSnake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo from positions: [head, body1, body2] = [A, B, C]\n\nAfter head moves to new position H', new positions: [H', A, B] if no growth, or [H', A, B, C] if growth with tail staying.\n\nIn this case, after eating at turn 4: snake is [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ]\n\nAt turn 5, if I move U to (1,3), no food there, so head to (1,3), then body: (2,2) moves to (1,2), and (2,3) moves to (2,2)? Let's sequence.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (1,2), index 1: (2,2), index 2: tail (2,3)\n\nMove head to (1,3). (1,3) is empty, no food, so no growth.\n\nThen new head is (1,3).\n\nThe body segment at index 1, (2,2), moves to the previous position of index 0, which is (1,2).\n\nThe tail segment at index 2, (2,3), moves to the previous position of index 1, which is (2,2).\n\nSo new snake: [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]\n\nTail at (2,2).\n\nIf I had moved D to (1,1), new snake [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2)]\n\nBut back to turn 4 choice.\n\nIf I move L on turn 4, I eat food, grow to length 3, at (1,2).\n\nThen from there, I can only move U or D, not R because (2,2) is body.\n\nMoving U to (1,3) or D to (1,1).\n\nBoth are safe, but I'm on the edge.\n\nFor example, from (1,2) move U to (1,3), then to (1,4), etc., but y=6 is wall, so up to (1,6).\n\nBut at (1,6), I can move R to (2,6), etc.\n\nBut there is food at (3,5) and (6,5), which are at y=5, so I need to go east.\n\nBut from (1,2) after moving U, I'm at (1,3), which is closer to (3,5)? (1,3) to (3,5) is not direct.\n\nIf I don't eat at (1,2) now, I can go to other foods.\n\nFor example, move R to (3,2) on turn 4.\n\nFrom (2,2) move R to (3,2), no food there, so snake moves to [(3,2), (2,2)] , tail at (2,2)? Positions: head to (3,2), body (2,3) moves to (2,2), so new snake [(3,2), (2,2)] , length 2, tail at (2,2).\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move U, D, L, R, but current direction after move: I moved R, so direction is R, cannot move L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), R to (4,2), or L but cannot because reverse.\n\nL is left to (2,2), but (2,2) is now the tail, so if I move to (2,2), it might be ok, because tail will move.\n\nCurrent positions: head (3,2), tail (2,2)\n\nIf I move L to (2,2), head moves to (2,2), which is occupied by tail. But when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by tail, and no food, it might be ok because tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail cell is safe, as long as it's only the tail and it moves.\n\nIn this case, moving to (2,2) which has tail, but since it's the tail, and no food, it should be safe.\n\nNew head at (2,2), tail moves away to where? Current positions: [(3,2), (2,2)] , head moves to (2,2), so new head (2,2), then the body segment (which is the tail) moves to previous head position (3,2)? Let's see.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (3,2), index 1: tail (2,2)\n\nHead moves to (2,2). (2,2) is occupied by tail, but it's the tail cell.\n\nAfter move, new head is (2,2), and the tail moves to the previous position of head, which is (3,2), so new snake [(2,2), (3,2)] , which is fine, no collision.\n\nBut in this case, I moved back to previous position, not useful.\n\nBetter to move to new cells.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move to (3,3) or (3,1) or (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is free, but there is food at (5,2), which is east.\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2, so from (3,2), moving R to (4,2), then to (5,2) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, food at (3,5), which is north, so move U.\n\nBut (3,5) is at y=5, so from (3,2), move U to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (3,5) to eat.\n\nAlso, there is internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nNow, back to turn 4.\n\nAnother option: move D to (2,1) on turn 4.\n\nFrom (2,2) move D to (2,1), no food, so new snake [(2,1), (2,2)] , tail at (2,2).\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1), D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, cannot, R to (3,1), U to (2,2) but (2,2) is tail, so can move to it, but not useful.\n\nMove to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nBut food at (1,2) is still there, but I moved away.\n\nI need to think about the path to all foods.\n\nAlso, since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate multiple moves.\n\nLet me list the food with positions and expiration:\n\n- F1: (1,2), value +1, expire turn 9\n\n- F2: (3,5), value +1, expire turn 9\n\n- F3: (5,2), value +1, expire turn 10\n\n- F4: (6,5), value +1, expire turn 13\n\nAll expire late, so I have time.\n\nBut F1 is very close, at (1,2), adjacent.\n\nIf I eat it now, I get +1 score, but I'm at (1,2) with length 3, which might be constraining.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I can come back later, but it might be risky or I might forget.\n\nSince life span is long, I can leave it for now and go for other foods.\n\nBut let's see the distances.\n\nFrom current position (2,2) to:\n\n- F1 (1,2): distance 1 (Manhattan or steps)\n\n- F2 (3,5): |3-2| + |5-2| =1+3=4 steps\n\n- F3 (5,2): |5-2| + |2-2| =3+0=3 steps\n\n- F4 (6,5): |6-2| + |5-2| =4+3=7 steps\n\nF3 is closer at 3 steps, F2 at 4, F1 at 1, F4 at 7.\n\nF1 is closest, but eating it might put me in a corner.\n\nI could go for F3 first, at (5,2).\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move R to (3,2), then R to (4,2), then R to (5,2) to eat on turn 6? Let's see turns.\n\nTurn 4: move from (2,2)\n\nIf I move R to (3,2) on turn 4, snake to [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nTurn 5: from (3,2), move R to (4,2), snake to [(4,2), (3,2)]  (since no eat, length 2)\n\nTurn 6: move to (5,2), which has food, eat, so grow to length 3, positions: head to (5,2), body (4,2) and (3,2)? Current before move: head (4,2), body (3,2)\n\nMove head to (5,2), eat, so new head (5,2), body segments: (4,2) moves to (4,2)? When eating, head moves to food, and tail does not move, so new segment added.\n\nCurrent positions before move: [(4,2), (3,2)]  head (4,2), tail (3,2)\n\nMove head to (5,2), eat food, so head is (5,2), and since ate, the tail stays, so new positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)] length 3.\n\nThen I have eaten F3 at turn 6.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to F2 at (3,5).\n\nFrom (2,2), on turn 4, if I move U, but I cannot because direction is D, and no instant reverse, so I cannot move U from (2,2) with current direction D.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, so I can only move D, L, R, not U.\n\nSo from (2,2), I cannot move U directly.\n\nTo go to (3,5), I need to go north.\n\nFor example, move R to (3,2) first, then from there move U.\n\nBut (3,5) is at y=5, from (3,2) move U to (3,3), then (3,4), then (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut at (3,5), there is food, so I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, F4 at (6,5) is farther.\n\nAlso, F1 at (1,2) can be eaten later.\n\nNow, the danger of tail reward: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nCurrently, tail at (2,3), head at (2,2), adjacent. But tail cell (2,3) has no food, so no issue.\n\nIf later, tail has food, but food only on specific cells.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but in this state, food positions are given, and (2,3) is not listed, so no food there.\n\nSo for now, no such danger.\n\nBut after eating, snake grows, positions change.\n\nLet's think about the map and possible paths.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (4,6) blocks that cell, so near top-right.\n\ny=6 is north, x=4.\n\n(4,6) is obstacle, so I cannot go there.\n\nFor example, to go to (3,5) or (6,5), I need to avoid (4,6).\n\n(3,5) is adjacent to (4,5), (3,6), etc., but (4,6) is blocked.\n\nBut (3,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is free.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat all foods if possible.\n\nBut with the snake growing, it might be hard to navigate.\n\nAlso, the grid is small, 6x6 playable area, 36 cells, but with obstacle, 35 free cells.\n\nSnake starts length 2, each food adds length, so after eating 4 foods, length 6, but there are 35 cells, so possible, but need to avoid dead ends.\n\nBut I don't have to eat all, just maximize.\n\nBut since all positive, better to eat all if safe.\n\nBut I need to plan a path.\n\nStart from turn 4, position (2,2).\n\nOption 1: move L to (1,2) and eat F1 immediately.\n\nThen at (1,2) with length 3: positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nFrom here, I can only move U or D, say move U to (1,3) on turn 5.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (1,3), no food, so snake to [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]  head (1,3), body (1,2), tail (2,2)\n\nThen turn 6: from (1,3), I can move U to (1,4), or R to (2,3) but (2,3) is not occupied now? Positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), tail (2,2)\n\n(2,3) is free, so I can move to (2,3) or (1,4) or D to (1,2) but (1,2) is body, cannot.\n\nMove U to (1,4) or R to (2,3) or L to (0,3) wall, cannot.\n\nSay move R to (2,3) on turn 6.\n\nNew head (2,3), no food, so snake to [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2)]  tail at (1,2)\n\nThen turn 7: from (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), D to (2,2), R to (3,3), L to (1,3) but (1,3) is body, cannot.\n\n(1,3) is body segment, so cannot move L.\n\nMove U, D, or R.\n\nSay move U to (2,4) or R to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut I need to go to F2 at (3,5).\n\nFrom (2,3), move U to (2,4), then U to (2,5), then L to (3,5)? (2,5) to (3,5) is R, but (3,5) is at x=3,y=5.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (3,5) is not adjacent, diagonal, not possible, must move orthogonally.\n\nSo from (2,3), move U to (2,4), then U to (2,5), then from (2,5) move R to (3,5) to eat F2 on turn 9 or something.\n\nLet's count turns.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (1,2), eat, snake len 3: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (1,3), no eat, snake [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]  head (1,3), tail (2,2)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (2,3), no eat, snake [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2)]  head (2,3), tail (1,2)\n\nTurn 7: move U to (2,4), no eat, snake [(2,4), (2,3), (1,3)]  head (2,4), tail (1,3)\n\nTurn 8: move U to (2,5), no eat, snake [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]  head (2,5), tail (2,3)\n\nTurn 9: move R to (3,5), eat F2, grow to len 4, snake [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]  since ate, tail (2,3) stays.\n\nThen I have eaten F1 and F2 by turn 9.\n\nF2 expires turn 9, so just in time.\n\nThen from here, I can go to other foods.\n\nBut I have F3 at (5,2) and F4 at (6,5).\n\n(5,2) is south-east, (6,5) north-east.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (4,5) or (3,6) or (2,5) or (3,4).\n\n(3,6): y=6, but y=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall, so y=6 is free, but (4,6) is obstacle, so (3,6) is free.\n\nMove to (4,5) or (3,6), etc.\n\nBut F4 at (6,5), so move R to (4,5), then to (5,5), then to (6,5) to eat F4.\n\nF4 at (6,5), life until turn 13, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, F3 at (5,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nBut after eating F2 at (3,5), snake is at [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)], so body occupies (2,3) to (2,5) and head (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,5), moving D to (3,4) or L to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, cannot, or R to (4,5), or U to (3,6).\n\nMove R to (4,5) on turn 10, then to (5,5) turn 11, then to (6,5) turn 12, eat F4.\n\nBut F3 at (5,2) is still there, expire turn 10, so on turn 10 it is available last.\n\nTurn 10: F3 can be eaten.\n\nBut from turn 9, I'm at (3,5), and F3 at (5,2), which is 3 steps away: |5-3| + |2-5| =2+3=5 steps, so I can reach in 5 turns, but turn 9 to turn 10 is only one turn, so I can only move to adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 9 after eating, to (5,2) on turn 10 is impossible, too far.\n\nSo I cannot eat F3 after turn 10, and from turn 9 position, I can't reach it by turn 10.\n\nTherefore, if I eat F1 and F2, I might miss F3.\n\nF3 expire turn 10, so must be eaten by turn 10.\n\nOn turn 4, if I go directly to F3.\n\nFor example, turn 4: move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,2), eat F3, grow to len 3: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)] assuming previous positions.\n\nTurn 4: move R to (3,2), snake [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,2), snake [(4,2), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 6: move to (5,2), eat, snake [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nNow, at (5,2) with len 3.\n\nF2 at (3,5) expire turn 9, F1 at (1,2) expire turn 9, F4 at (6,5) expire turn 13.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can go to F2 at (3,5).\n\n|3-5| + |5-2| =2+3=5 steps, but I have 4 turns to eat by turn 9? Turn 6,7,8,9: 4 turns to move.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (3,5): need to go left and up.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,2) but (4,2) is body? Positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), tail (3,2)\n\n(4,2) is body, so cannot move to (4,2).\n\nMove U to (5,3), or D to (5,1), or R to (6,2).\n\nSay move U to (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nThen to (5,4) turn 8, then to (5,5) turn 9, then to (5,6) or to (4,5), but F2 is at (3,5).\n\nFrom (5,4) move L to (4,4), then to (3,4), then to (3,5) on turn 10, but turn 10 is too late, F2 expires turn 9.\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 6, to (3,5) in 3 moves? Minimum moves: from (5,2) to (3,5): difference x:2, y:3, so min 5 moves, but with obstacles, might be more.\n\nDirect path: (5,2) to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, cannot.\n\n(4,2) is occupied, so must go around.\n\nFor example, move U to (5,3) turn 7.\n\nThen move U to (5,4) turn 8.\n\nThen move L to (4,4) turn 9.\n\nBut (4,4) to (3,5) not adjacent.\n\nFrom (5,4) turn 8, move L to (4,4), then turn 9 move U to (4,5), then turn 10 move L to (3,5), too late.\n\nFrom (5,4) turn 8, move L to (4,4) no, (4,4) is free.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5) or L to (3,4).\n\nTo reach (3,5), from (5,4) turn 8, I need to be at (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nBut from (5,4) to (3,5) is |2| + |1| =3 moves, so turn 8 to turn 9 only one move, can only go to adjacent, (4,4) or (5,5) or (6,4) or (5,3), none is (3,5), so impossible to reach (3,5) from (5,4) in one move.\n\nSimilarly, from turn 6 position (5,2), I can only reach cells within 3 moves by turn 9.\n\n(3,5) is 3 steps away in Manhattan, but due to body, it might take more.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), move U to (5,3) turn 7.\n\nThen move U to (5,4) turn 8.\n\nThen move L to (4,4) turn 9, but (4,4) not (3,5).\n\nOr from (5,3) turn 7, move L to (4,3) turn 8.\n\nThen from (4,3) move U to (4,4) or L to (3,3), etc., not to (3,5) in one step.\n\nTo reach (3,5) on turn 9, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 8, like (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), or (4,5).\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 6, can I reach one of those by turn 8?\n\nFor example, (4,5): from (5,2) to (4,5): |1| + |3| =4 moves, but only 2 moves: turn 7 and 8.\n\nTurn 7: move from (5,2) to say (5,3) or (4,2) but (4,2) body, cannot, so only (5,3) or (5,1) or (6,2).\n\nSay (5,3) turn 7.\n\nTurn 8: from (5,3) move U to (5,4) or L to (4,3), etc., not (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is two steps away from (5,2), but not reachable in two moves because must move orthogonally.\n\n(5,2) to (4,2) blocked, to (5,3) then to (4,3) or (5,4), not (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is not adjacent to (5,2), so min moves 3: e.g., (5,2)->(5,3)->(5,4)->(4,4) or something, not directly.\n\nManhattan distance |5-4| + |2-5| =1+3=4, so at least 4 moves from (5,2) to (4,5).\n\nSimilarly to (3,5): |5-3| + |2-5| =2+3=5 moves.\n\nSo from turn 6, with 3 moves to turn 9, I can only reach cells within 3 moves, but (3,5) is 5 away, impossible to reach by turn 9.\n\nTherefore, if I go to F3 first on turn 6, I cannot reach F2 by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, F1 at (1,2) expire turn 9, from (5,2) it's far, |5-1| + |2-2| =4 moves, but with turns, from turn 6 to turn 9, 3 moves, can reach (2,2) or something, but not (1,2) if not careful.\n\nFrom (5,2) turn 6, move L to (4,2) but body, cannot, so must move U or D or R.\n\nSay move U to (5,3) turn 7, then to (5,4) turn 8, then to (5,5) turn 9, far from (1,2).\n\nOr move D to (5,1) turn 7, then L to (4,1) turn 8, then L to (3,1) turn 9, still not (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is 4 moves away, cannot reach in 3 moves.\n\nSo if I eat F3 first, I miss both F1 and F2, since they expire turn 9.\n\nF2 at (3,5) expire turn 9, F1 at (1,2) expire turn 9.\n\nOnly F4 left, which is far.\n\nBut I can eat F1 and F2 if I go that way.\n\nEarlier when I ate F1 and F2, I missed F3, but F3 expire turn 10, later than turn 9.\n\nIn the first scenario, when I ate F1 and F2 by turn 9, F3 is still available until turn 10.\n\nFrom position after eating F2 at turn 9: at (3,5) with snake [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n\nF3 at (5,2), expire turn 10.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (5,2): |3-5| + |5-2| =2+3=5 moves, but I have only one turn to move, turn 10.\n\nOn turn 9, I am at (3,5), need to eat F3 on turn 10 at (5,2), which is not adjacent, distance 5, impossible.\n\nSo I cannot reach F3 from there by turn 10.\n\nTherefore, if I go for F1 and F2, I eat them by turn 9, but miss F3.\n\nIf I go for F3, I eat it by turn 6, but miss F1 and F2.\n\nBut F4 is still available later.\n\nBut with F4, life until turn 13, I can eat it after.\n\nBut I want to eat as many as possible.\n\nPerhaps I can eat F1 later or first, but not both clusters.\n\nAnother option: on turn 4, instead of eating F1 or going to F3, I can go towards F2.\n\nBut to go to F2, I need to go north.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move R to (3,2), then U to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut F2 at (3,5), so from (2,2) move R to (3,2) turn 4.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,2) move U to (3,3), snake [(3,3), (3,2), (2,2)]? After turn 4: [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,3), no food, snake [(3,3), (3,2)]\n\nThen turn 6: move U to (3,4), snake [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (3,5), eat F2, grow to len 3: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 7.\n\nF2 eaten turn 7.\n\nThen F1 at (1,2) expire turn 9, F3 at (5,2) expire turn 10, F4 at (6,5) expire turn 13.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to F1 or F3.\n\nF1 at (1,2): from (3,5) to (1,2): |3-1| + |5-2| =2+3=5 moves, expire turn 9, so must eat by turn 9.\n\nTurn 7 to turn 9: 3 moves, can I reach?\n\nFrom (3,5) turn 7, move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5), etc.\n\nSay move D to (3,4) turn 8.\n\nThen move D to (3,3) turn 9.\n\nBut (3,3) not (1,2), and F1 at (1,2) not eaten.\n\nMove L to (2,5) turn 8, then D to (2,4) turn 9, still not.\n\nTo reach (1,2) in two moves from (3,5)? Impossible, min 4 moves.\n\nSo cannot reach F1 by turn 9 from here.\n\nF3 at (5,2) expire turn 10, from (3,5) to (5,2): |2| + |3| =5 moves, but from turn 7 to turn 10, 4 moves: turn 8,9,10.\n\nTurn 7: at (3,5)\n\nTurn 8: move to say (4,5)\n\nTurn 9: move to (5,5)\n\nTurn 10: move to (5,4) or (5,6), not (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is south, so need to move down.\n\nFrom (3,5) move D to (3,4) turn 8.\n\nThen D to (3,3) turn 9.\n\nThen D to (3,2) turn 10.\n\nThen from (3,2) to (5,2) not adjacent.\n\nOr from (3,3) turn 9, move R to (4,3) turn 10, not (5,2).\n\nCannot reach (5,2) by turn 10 from (3,5) in 3 moves.\n\nTurn 8,9,10: three moves.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (5,2): min 5 moves, impossible in 3.\n\nSo I can only eat F2 and then F4 or something, but miss F1 and F3.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps on turn 4, I move D to (2,1), but then I'm farther from foods.\n\nMove D to (2,1) turn 4, snake [(2,1), (2,2)]\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut F1 at (1,2) is nearby, I can move U to (2,2) but (2,2) is tail, can move, but not useful, or move L to (1,1) turn 5, then U to (1,2) turn 6 to eat F1.\n\nTurn 6: at (1,2) eat, then grow.\n\nBut F2 and F3 might be missed.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo the key is to eat F3 first since it's in the middle and has later expire, or eat F1 first and then F3.\n\nBut F1 expire turn 9, F3 expire turn 10.\n\nIf I eat F1 on turn 4, I'm at (1,2) with len 3.\n\nThen from there, I can go directly to F3 at (5,2).\n\nFrom (1,2) to (5,2): same y, so I can move right.\n\nBut with snake body, it might be blocked.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (1,2), eat, snake [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move from (1,2), can move U to (1,3) or D to (1,1), say move D to (1,1) to go south, but F3 is at y=2, so better to move right, but I can't because (2,2) is body.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nMove U to (1,3) turn 5, snake [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]\n\nTurn 6: from (1,3), move R to (2,3), no food, snake [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nTurn 7: from (2,3), move R to (3,3), snake [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3)]\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3), move D to (3,2), snake [(3,2), (3,3), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 9: from (3,2), move R to (4,2), snake [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 10: move R to (5,2), eat F3, grow to len 4: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)]\n\nF3 eaten on turn 10, just in time.\n\nNow, F2 at (3,5) expire turn 9, already missed, since turn 10 is too late.\n\nF2 expire turn 9, so not eaten.\n\nF4 at (6,5) can be eaten later.\n\nBut I have F1 and F3.\n\nMissed F2.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to F3 first, I can eat F3 on turn 6, then from there try to go to F1 or F2.\n\nF1 expire turn 9, from (5,2) turn 6, to (1,2) in 4 moves: turn 7,8,9,10.\n\nBut must eat by turn 9.\n\nFrom (5,2) turn 6, move L to (4,2) but body, cannot, so move U to (5,3) turn 7.\n\nThen move L to (4,3) turn 8.\n\nThen move L to (3,3) turn 9.\n\nThen from (3,3) to (1,2) not adjacent, and F1 at (1,2) not eaten on turn 9.\n\nMove from (5,3) turn 8 to (4,3), then turn 9 to (3,3), not (1,2).\n\nTo reach (1,2) on turn 9, I need to be at (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nFrom (5,2) turn 6, it's 4 moves away, so on turn 9 I can be there if I move directly.\n\nBut with body, from (5,2) turn 6, snake [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nCan move U to (5,3) turn 7, snake [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nThen move L to (4,3) turn 8, snake [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nThen move L to (3,3) turn 9, snake [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n\nNot (1,2).\n\nMove from (5,3) turn 7 to (5,4) turn 8, then to (4,4) turn 9, not better.\n\nOr from (5,2) turn 6, move D to (5,1) turn 7, then L to (4,1) turn 8, then L to (3,1) turn 9, then to (2,1) turn 10, not (1,2).\n\nTo go west, I need to move L, but from (5,2) I can only move U, D, R initially, since (4,2) body.\n\nThen after moving U or D, I can move L, but it's slow.\n\nCannot reach (1,2) by turn 9 from (5,2) in 3 moves.\n\nSimilarly for F2.\n\nSo the only way to eat both F1 and F3 is to eat F1 first and then go to F3, eating F3 on turn 10 as above, but missing F2.\n\nF2 is at (3,5), which is north, not on the way.\n\nPerhaps on turn 4, I don't eat F1, but move R to (3,2), then on turn 5 move U to (3,3), then on turn 6 move U to (3,4), then on turn 7 move U to (3,5) to eat F2, as I had earlier.\n\nThen at (3,5) turn 7 with len 3.\n\nThen F1 at (1,2) expire turn 9, from (3,5) to (1,2) min 4 moves, turn 8,9,10, but must eat by turn 9, so only two moves: turn 8 and 9.\n\nFrom (3,5) turn 7, move L to (2,5) turn 8, then move D to (2,4) turn 9, not (1,2).\n\nOr move D to (3,4) turn 8, then D to (3,3) turn 9, not (1,2).\n\nCannot.\n\nF3 at (5,2) expire turn 10, from (3,5) to (5,2) min 5 moves, turn 8,9,10 only 3 moves, impossible.\n\nSo no way to eat F2 and F3.\n\nTherefore, the best is to eat F1 and F3, missing F2, or eat F2 and F3 if possible, but F2 and F3 are not easy to combine with F1.\n\nF2 and F3: from start, go to F2 first, eat on turn 7, then to F3, but F3 expire turn 10, from (3,5) turn 7 to (5,2) in 3 moves by turn 10? Turn 8,9,10.\n\nFrom (3,5) turn 7, move to (4,5) turn 8, then to (5,5) turn 9, then to (5,4) turn 10, not (5,2).\n\nMove down: to (3,4) turn 8, then to (3,3) turn 9, then to (3,2) turn 10, then to (4,2) etc, not (5,2).\n\nFrom (3,3) turn 9, move R to (4,3) turn 10, not (5,2).\n\nCannot reach (5,2) in 3 moves from (3,5).\n\nSo only possible to eat F1 and F3, or F2 and F4, etc.\n\nBut F4 is far.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 4, move R to (3,2), then on turn 5 move R to (4,2), then on turn 6 move to (5,2) eat F3.\n\nThen from there, F1 is missed, but F4 can be eaten.\n\nF4 at (6,5), expire turn 13, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat F2 if I go north first.\n\nBut let's see F4.\n\nPerhaps I can eat F1 immediately and then have more time for others.\n\nBut with the snake longer, it might be harder.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nThe grid has an obstacle at (4,6), so the area is divided, but not really, since I can go around.\n\nFor example, to go from left to right, I can go below or above.\n\ny from 1 to 6, (4,6) blocked, but I can go to y=5 or lower.\n\nBut let's decide on a plan.\n\nSince F1 is very close, and I can eat it safely, and then go to F3, missing F2, but eating two foods.\n\nThen F4 can be eaten later.\n\nF2 is at (3,5), which might be risky because of the obstacle, but not necessarily.\n\nBut in terms of score, eating two is better than one, and F4 is available.\n\nIf I don't eat F1, and go to F3, I eat one food, then I might eat F4, but miss F1 and F2.\n\nSo eating F1 and F3 gives two, same as eating F3 and F4, but F4 is farther.\n\nEating F1 and F3 is more efficient.\n\nIn the first case, when I eat F1 on turn 4, then go to F3 by turn 10, I have snake len 4.\n\nThen I can go to F4 at (6,5).\n\nFrom (5,2) after eating F3, positions [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)] from earlier.\n\nTurn 10: at (5,2) after eating.\n\nThen move U to (5,3) turn 11, then U to (5,4) turn 12, then R to (6,4) turn 13, but F4 at (6,5), so not.\n\nMove to (5,3) turn 11, then to (5,4) turn 12, then to (5,5) turn 13, then to (6,5) turn 14, but F4 expire turn 13, so on turn 13 it must be eaten.\n\nTurn 13: last chance.\n\nOn turn 13, if I am at (6,5) or adjacent.\n\nFrom (5,2) turn 10, to (6,5) in 3 moves: turn 11,12,13.\n\nMin moves: |5-6| + |2-5| =1+3=4 moves, so impossible to reach by turn 13 with 3 moves.\n\nTurn 11,12,13: three moves.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (6,5): e.g., (5,2)->(5,3)->(5,4)->(5,5) or (6,4), not (6,5).\n\nTo (6,5) directly not possible, so min 4 moves, cannot reach in 3.\n\nSo after eating F3 on turn 10, I cannot reach F4 by turn 13.\n\nF4 expire turn 13, so last eat turn 13.\n\nFrom turn 10 position, I can reach (6,5) by turn 13 only if I start closer.\n\nBut from (5,2) it's too far.\n\nIf I eat F1 and F2 first, then from (3,5) turn 9, F4 at (6,5) expire turn 13, from turn 9 to turn 13, 4 moves: turn 10,11,12,13.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (6,5): |3| + |0| =3 moves, so possible.\n\nTurn 9: at (3,5)\n\nTurn 10: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 11: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 12: move R to (6,5), eat F4 on turn 12.\n\nYes, turn 12.\n\nF4 expire turn 13, so on turn 12 it can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, I have eaten F1, F2, and F4, but missed F3.\n\nF3 is missed.\n\nIn the F1 and F2 case, I can eat F4.\n\nBut F3 is missed.\n\nSince F3 has later expire, I can go to it after, but from (3,5) turn 9, F3 at (5,2) expire turn 10, cannot reach as before.\n\nSo only three foods possible: F1, F2, F4.\n\nOr F1, F3, but then F4 not reachable.\n\nLet's list the options:\n\n- Option A: Eat F1 on turn 4, then F2 on turn 9, then F4 on turn 12. Score 3.\n\n- Option B: Eat F3 on turn 6, then F4 on turn 12 or something, but F4 expire turn 13, from (5,2) turn 6, to (6,5) min 4 moves, turn 7,8,9,10 to (6,5) by turn 10, but F4 expire turn 13, so can be later.\n\nFrom (5,2) turn 6, move U to (5,3) turn 7, to (5,4) turn 8, to (5,5) turn 9, to (6,5) turn 10, eat F4 on turn 10.\n\nThen I have F3 and F4, but missed F1 and F2. Score 2.\n\nWorse than option A.\n\nOption C: Go to F2 first. Turn 4 move R to (3,2), turn 5 move U to (3,3), turn 6 move U to (3,4), turn 7 move U to (3,5) eat F2, then turn 8 move to (4,5), turn 9 to (5,5), turn 10 to (6,5) eat F4, then F1 is missed, F3 can be eaten if I go down, but F3 at (5,2), from (6,5) turn 10, to (5,2) min 4 moves, expire turn 10, last chance turn 10, so if not at (5,2) on turn 10, cannot eat.\n\nOn turn 10 at (6,5), not (5,2), so miss F3.\n\nSo only F2 and F4, score 2.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo best is option A: eat F1, then F2, then F4.\n\nIn option A, I eat F1 on turn 4, F2 on turn 9, F4 on turn 12.\n\nAnd F3 is missed, but that's ok.\n\nI can eat F3 instead of F2, but F2 is on the way to F4.\n\nIn option A, when I go to F2, I can then go to F4.\n\nF3 is south, not on the way.\n\nSo let's finalize the moves for option A.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (1,2) to eat F1.\n\nSnake now: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nHead at (1,2), direction after move: I moved L, so direction L.\n\nNow, from (1,2), I need to go to F2 at (3,5).\n\nFirst, I need to get out of the left column.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (1,3)  (since moving D to (1,1) might lead to dead end, better up to go towards F2)\n\nSnake: move U to (1,3), no food, so new positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), tail (2,2) -> [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]\n\nTurn 6: from (1,3), move R to (2,3)  (now (2,3) is free, no body)\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), tail (1,2) -> [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nTurn 7: from (2,3), move U to (2,4)  (towards y=5)\n\nPositions: head (2,4), body (2,3), tail (1,3) -> [(2,4), (2,3), (1,3)]\n\nTurn 8: from (2,4), move U to (2,5)  (now at y=5)\n\nPositions: head (2,5), body (2,4), tail (2,3) -> [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 9: from (2,5), move R to (3,5) to eat F2.\n\n(3,5) has food, so eat, grow to len 4: new head (3,5), body segments: since ate, tail stays, so positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n\nNow, F4 at (6,5), same y=5.\n\nTurn 10: from (3,5), move R to (4,5)  (no food)\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,4) -> [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nTurn 11: from (4,5), move R to (5,5)  (no food)\n\nPositions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5) -> [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 12: from (5,5), move R to (6,5) to eat F4.\n\nEat, grow to len 5.\n\nAnd F4 eaten on turn 12, before expire turn 13.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, I have eaten three foods: F1, F2, F4.\n\nF3 at (5,2) is not eaten, but that's fine.\n\nIn this path, on turn 6, I moved to (2,3), which might be under the snake earlier, but now it's free.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) is not in the way.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is for the current turn and future turns, but it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but how many turns?\n\nIt says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn t1.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output.\n\nLooking back: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1 Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nAnd \"each action in {U, D, L, R}\"\n\nBut it doesn't say for how many turns. Probably I need to output for the immediate decision, but since it says think ahead, perhaps output a sequence.\n\nIn this case, for turn 4, I decided to move L.\n\nBut to show the plan, I can output a few turns.\n\nSince the state is given for turn t1, and I need to act, but the action is for turn t1, and perhaps the future actions are planned, but might change based on new state.\n\nBut in this case, since no new food spawns, and I have a plan, I can output multiple turns.\n\nTo be safe, I should output for turn 4 and perhaps a few more.\n\nBut the instruction says \"maximize score\" and \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I think outputting a sequence is fine.\n\nIn the plan above, from turn 4 to turn 12, but that's 9 turns, too many.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I need to specify the action for turn t1, and the AI will be given new state each turn.\n\nBut since this is a one-time response, I think I should output the action for turn t1 only.\n\nBut the answer format shows multiple turns.\n\nLet me read: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1 Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nAnd in the example, it might be implied to show the sequence.\n\nBut for this, I can output for turn 4 to, say, turn 9 or something.\n\nSince I have a plan, I can list the actions.\n\nBut to be concise, for turn 4, I choose L.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a better move.\n\nAnother possibility: on turn 4, move R to (3,2), then go to F3 on turn 6, then from there, since F1 is close, but I can't reach it in time, as before.\n\nMove D to (2,1), then I can eat F1 later, but same issue.\n\nSo moving L to eat F1 immediately seems best for long-term, as it allows me to eat F2 and F4 later.\n\nMoreover, in the path, I avoided risks, no dead ends.\n\nAlso, on turn 9, when I move to (3,5), it is safe.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: at no point is the head adjacent to tail with food on tail, so no issue.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n\nTherefore, for turn 4: move L\n\nThen the sequence as above.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output in the box.\n\nPerhaps I should output the action for turn 4 and the next few to show the plan.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", outputting 5 actions might be sufficient.\n\nTurn 4 to turn 8, for example.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: U (from (1,2) to (1,3))\n\nIn my earlier plan, turn 5: move U to (1,3)\n\nBut from (1,2), after moving L on turn 4, direction is L, so I can move U, D, or L, but not R (reverse).\n\nMoving U is fine.\n\nThen turn 6: move R to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 7: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 8: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 9: move R to (3,5) to eat, but that's turn 9.\n\nFor 5 turns: turn 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nActions: turn4 L, turn5 U, turn6 R, turn7 U, turn8 U\n\nThen turn9 R, but I don't need to output turn9.\n\nIn the answer, I can list from turn4 to as far as I want, but perhaps 5 actions.\n\nSince the state might change, but here no new food, so fixed.\n\nI think outputting turn4 action is key.\n\nBut to demonstrate thinking, I'll output a sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nThen implicitly to (2,5), then turn9 R to (3,5).\n\nBut for the box.\n\nIn the current state, turn t1=4, so start from there.\n\nAlso, snake head direction after each move might be needed for no reverse, but in the action, I just need to specify the move.\n\nIn the answer format, only the action.\n\nSo I think:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{U} }\n\nBut turn 8 U to (2,5), which is fine.\n\nTo be precise, in the sequence, after turn8 U, I am at (2,5), then I can move R on turn9.\n\nBut since I don't output turn9, it's ok.\n\nI could output fewer.\n\nSince the question is to act for turn t1, and think ahead, but output only turn t1 action.\n\nBut the format suggests multiple.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for this, moving L on turn4 is the decision.\n\nBut let's see if moving R or D is better.\n\nIf I move R on turn4 to (3,2), then I can go to F3 on turn6, but then I miss F1 and F2, only eat F3 and possibly F4, but F4 might be eaten, score 2, worse.\n\nIf I move D to (2,1), then I am farther, might eat F1 later, but same as before.\n\nSo L is best.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must think multiple turns ahead, considering food expiration, potential collisions, and the snake's growth. The current state (turn 4) has the snake at positions [(2, 2), (2, 3)] with head direction down (D). The available foods are all positive (+1 value) with the following positions and life spans:\n- (1, 2): expires after turn 9 (life span 6 at turn 4)\n- (3, 5): expires after turn 9 (life span 6 at turn 4)\n- (5, 2): expires after turn 10 (life span 7 at turn 4)\n- (6, 5): expires after turn 13 (life span 10 at turn 4)\n\nThe grid has walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4, 6). The snake must avoid these and body collisions.\n\n### Analysis and Plan\n- **Immediate decision (turn 4)**: From (2, 2), possible moves are L (to (1, 2)), D (to (2, 1)), or R (to (3, 2)). Moving U is impossible due to no instant reverse (current direction D).\n  - Moving L to (1, 2) eats the food immediately, increasing length to 3 and scoring +1. This is prioritized because (1, 2) is adjacent and expires soon (turn 9), and not eating it now may risk missing it later due to the snake's growth or path constraints.\n  - Moving R or D avoids eating now but may lead to missing (1, 2) or other foods, as the snake must cover more distance with limited turns before expirations.\n- **Long-term plan (5+ turns)**: After eating (1, 2), the snake heads towards (3, 5) to eat by turn 9, then to (6, 5) to eat by turn 12. (5, 2) is skipped because it is not efficiently reachable without missing other foods, and (6, 5) has a later expiration.\n  - Path to (3, 5): From (1, 2), move up (U) to avoid the left edge and align with (3, 5). Then, move right (R) and up (U) to reach (3, 5) by turn 9.\n  - Path to (6, 5): From (3, 5), move right (R) along y=5 to (6, 5) by turn 12, avoiding the obstacle at (4, 6) by staying at y=5.\n- **Risks avoided**:\n  - No tail reward danger: The tail (initially at (2, 3)) never has food, and in the path, head and tail are not adjacent with food on the tail cell.\n  - Collisions: Movements avoid walls, the obstacle, and body segments. When moving to the tail cell (e.g., in early turns), it is safe as the tail moves away.\n  - Dead ends: The path stays clear of constrained areas (e.g., after turn 4, moving away from the left edge quickly).\n- **Score maximized**: Eating (1, 2), (3, 5), and (6, 5) yields +3 score. (5, 2) is not eaten due to inefficiency and expiration conflict, but 3 foods are better than alternatives (e.g., eating only 2 foods).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence for turns 4 to 8 executes the first part of the plan (to (2, 5) by turn 8), with turn 9 eating (3, 5) and beyond to (6, 5). Actions are chosen to align with the grid and no-reverse rule.\n\n- **Turn 4 (t1)**: Move L to (1, 2) to eat food, increasing length to 3. New snake: [(1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)].\n- **Turn 5**: Move U to (1, 3) to head towards (3, 5). No food, so snake moves to [(1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2)].\n- **Turn 6**: Move R to (2, 3) to exit the left edge. No food, snake: [(2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2)].\n- **Turn 7**: Move U to (2, 4) to continue towards y=5. No food, snake: [(2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3)].\n- **Turn 8**: Move U to (2, 5) to reach y=5. No food, snake: [(2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3)].\n- **Beyond (not output but part of plan)**: \n  - Turn 9: Move R to (3, 5) to eat food, increasing length to 4. Snake: [(3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3)].\n  - Turn 10: Move R to (4, 5). Snake: [(4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4)].\n  - Turn 11: Move R to (5, 5). Snake: [(5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5)].\n  - Turn 12: Move R to (6, 5) to eat food, increasing length to 5.\n\nThis plan eats 3 foods safely and avoids all risks.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{U} }",
