Safe move.\n   - **Down (D)**: (2, 4)\n     - Wall (internal obstacle). Invalid move.\n   - **Right (R)**: (3, 5)\n     - Opposite to current direction (L).

The least \"risky\" action (though still fatal) is to move **Left (L)** into the wall, as it is the only non-reverse direction that doesn't involve colliding with the body.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{L}",
