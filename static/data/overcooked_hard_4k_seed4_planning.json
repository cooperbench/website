        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 0 (start of the game). We need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) for the next several turns to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nEnvironment Details:\n- The grid is 8x5? (from the tile coordinates, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4)\n- Kitchen Counters: many positions, all empty at the start.\n- Onion Dispensers: at (3,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: at (0,2)\n- Pot: at (3,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: at (7,2)\n\nRecipe Information:\n- Only Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n\nCurrent State:\n- Alice: at (3,3), facing down (D), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (3,1), facing down (D), holding nothing.\n\nGoal: Make and serve onion soup (3 onions) to get the reward of 20.\n\nPlan:\nWe have two pots. We can use one or both. However, since we are at the beginning and we have two players, we can coordinate to fill one pot quickly and then serve.\n\nSteps for one soup:\n1. Get onions from the onion dispensers and put them into a pot until the pot has 3 onions.\n2. Wait for the pot to cook (5 turns).\n3. Get a plate from the plate dispenser.\n4. Use the plate to serve the soup from the pot (which gives a soup in a plate).\n5. Deliver the soup to the serving counter.\n\nBut note: we have two players. We can have one player focus on getting the plate and serving, while the other focuses on getting onions.\n\nHowever, the pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). The plate dispenser is at (0,2). The serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nWe can assign:\n- Alice: closer to the onion dispensers? Alice is at (3,3) and the onion dispenser is at (3,4) and (4,4). So Alice can get onions.\n- Bob: at (3,1) is closer to the plate dispenser? Actually, (3,1) is above the pots (which are at (3,0) and (4,0)) and the plate dispenser is at (0,2). Bob might be closer to the plate dispenser? Let's see the distances.\n\nBut note: we need to fill a pot first. So let's choose one pot, say the one at (3,0).\n\nPlan for Alice:\n- Alice is at (3,3). To get an onion, she needs to go to an onion dispenser. The closest is (3,4) or (4,4). Since she is at (3,3), (3,4) is one step up? But note: the grid coordinates: (x,y). Moving up increases y? According to the move: U (x, y+1). So (3,3) with U goes to (3,4). But (3,4) is an onion dispenser. However, to interact, she must be adjacent and facing it. So if she moves to (3,4) then she is on the dispenser? But dispensers are non-empty tiles? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So dispensers are not walkable? Actually, the rules say:\n\n\"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo Alice cannot stand on the dispenser. She must stand adjacent and face it. Therefore, for the onion dispenser at (3,4), she can stand at (3,3) and face up? But at (3,3) she is adjacent to (3,4) above her. So if she is at (3,3) and facing up (U), then she can interact to get an onion.\n\nSimilarly, for the pot at (3,0): if she is at (3,1) and facing down, she can interact with the pot.\n\nSo plan for Alice:\n1. At (3,3), facing down. She can change orientation to up (U) and then interact? But note: the action set includes changing orientation without moving? Yes, but we can also move and change orientation at the same time? Actually, the move action changes both position and orientation. The change orientation action is separate and doesn't move.\n\nBut the action set per turn: \n- Move (L/R/U/D): changes position and orientation to that direction.\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): only changes orientation, no move.\n\nSo to get an onion, Alice can:\n- Option 1: Change orientation to U (so now facing up) and then Interact (I). But she is at (3,3) and the dispenser is at (3,4) above. Since she is adjacent and facing it, she can interact to grab an onion.\n\nSo in one turn: change orientation to U and then interact? But wait, each turn only one action. So:\n\nTurn 0: Alice can do 'U' (which is change orientation to U) OR 'I'? But note: the action set: each turn she chooses one of {U, D, L, R, I, S}. \n\nBut the move action (U, D, L, R) moves and changes orientation. The change orientation action is not explicitly listed? Actually, the description says:\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\"\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me re-read:\n\n\"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one. [This is ambiguous]\"\n\nActually, the second bullet might be meant to be a separate action? But the list of actions is: Move, Change Orientation, Interact, Stay.\n\nBut in the answer format, we use U, D, L, R for move? And for change orientation, how is it represented? The problem says: \"each action \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, L, R, I, S\\}\\)\". So there are only six actions: U, D, L, R, I, S.\n\nBut how do we change orientation without moving? The description says there is a \"Change Orientation\" action, but in the set it is represented by U, D, L, R? Then how do we distinguish between move and change orientation?\n\nI think I found the issue. The problem states:\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\"\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is confusing. Actually, reading carefully: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This implies that if you try to move but the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move? But that is for the move action? Or is there a separate change orientation action?\n\nLooking back: \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can: ... Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis seems to describe the move action? Actually, the move action changes position and orientation, but only if the adjacent tile in the direction is empty. Otherwise, it doesn't move? But the change orientation action is separate: it only changes orientation and doesn't move.\n\nBut in the list of actions, we have U, D, L, R for both move and change orientation? How to represent?\n\nI think the problem has a flaw. But note the answer format: the actions are in {U, D, L, R, I, S}. And the problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D)\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)\" are two different things. But how to specify which one?\n\nThis is critical. Let me re-read the problem:\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThe second one is poorly worded. I think the intention is:\n\n- When a player chooses a direction (U, D, L, R) as an action, it is a move action. But if the adjacent tile in that direction is not walkable (empty), then the player does not move but still changes orientation to that direction.\n\nSo effectively, the same action U, D, L, R can either:\n- Move and change orientation (if the adjacent tile is empty and walkable), or\n- Only change orientation (if the adjacent tile is not walkable).\n\nThis is common in grid games.\n\nTherefore, the action U means: try to move up. If the tile above is empty, then move up and face up. If not, then just face up without moving.\n\nSimilarly for D, L, R.\n\nSo for Alice at (3,3) facing down, to face up and interact with the dispenser above (which is at (3,4)):\n\n- If she does U: she tries to move up to (3,4). But (3,4) is an onion dispenser, which is not walkable? So she cannot move. Then she just changes orientation to up.\n\nThen in the next turn, she can do I: interact, which will grab an onion from the dispenser because she is at (3,3) (adjacent to (3,4)) and facing up.\n\nAlternatively, she can do I in the same turn? But she is facing down at turn 0, so if she does I, she would interact with the tile below her? But the tile below is (3,2). What is at (3,2)? From the tile types: (3,2) is a kitchen counter (which is in the list: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)). So kitchen counter at (3,2). But it is empty? So if she interacts facing down, she would try to interact with (3,2). But since it's an empty kitchen counter, she cannot pick up anything? So that would be a no-op.\n\nSo for Alice:\nTurn 0: Action U -> since (3,4) is not walkable, she doesn't move but changes orientation to up. Now she is at (3,3) facing up.\nTurn 1: Action I -> she interacts with the dispenser above and gets an onion. Now she is holding an onion.\n\nThen she needs to go to a pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). She is at (3,3). To get to (3,0), she needs to go down three steps: (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (3,0). But note: (3,2) is a kitchen counter, which is not walkable? So she cannot walk on it.\n\nTherefore, she must go around? Or is there a path?\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nWe know the non-empty tiles: \n- Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n- Onion Dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\nSo the walkable tiles are the empty tiles. We don't have a full grid, but we can infer that the central area might be walkable.\n\nSpecifically, Alice is at (3,3). What tiles are around?\n- (3,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? So it's empty? Then (3,3) is walkable.\n\nBelow her: (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable.\nAbove: (3,4) is an onion dispenser -> not walkable.\nLeft: (2,3) - is it empty? Not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters at y=3 are (0,3) and (7,3). So (2,3) and (3,3) and (4,3) etc. are empty? Similarly, right: (4,3) is empty.\n\nSo Alice can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3) or down? But down to (3,2) is not walkable. So she can only move left or right? But she needs to go down to the pot.\n\nAlternative path: go to (2,3) then (2,2) is a kitchen counter? (2,2) is in the kitchen counter list -> not walkable. So she cannot go down from (2,3) either.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3): right, then (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable.\n\nSo how can she get to the pots? The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The row above the pots (y=1) must be walkable? Bob is at (3,1) and that tile is not listed as a kitchen counter? So (3,1) is empty and walkable.\n\nBut to get to (3,1) from (3,3), she must go through (3,2) which is blocked. So she must go around.\n\nPossible path: \n(3,3) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. \n(3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) ? (1,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters at y=2: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (1,2) is not listed -> walkable? Similarly, (0,2) is a plate dispenser -> not walkable.\n\nSo from (1,3), she can go down to (1,2) (walkable) then to (1,1) -> (1,1) is not in the kitchen counter list? Kitchen counters at y=1: (0,1) and (7,1). So (1,1) is empty. Then (1,0) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. So she can go to (1,1) and then right to (2,1) -> (2,1) is empty? Then (3,1) -> then to (3,0)? But (3,0) is a pot -> not walkable.\n\nSo to interact with the pot at (3,0), she must be at (3,1) and face down.\n\nSo the path for Alice from (3,3) to (3,1) is long: \n(3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1). That's 5 moves.\n\nBut note: Bob is already at (3,1). And players cannot walk through each other. So if Bob is at (3,1), Alice cannot go to (3,1) until Bob moves.\n\nTherefore, we need to coordinate and have Bob move away if needed.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the other pot at (4,0). The path to (4,1) might be similar.\n\nBut note: from (3,3) to (4,3) is one step right. Then (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked by kitchen counter. So again, she must go around: (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) blocked -> so then (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) is not in the kitchen counter? Kitchen counters at (6,0) and (6,4) -> so (6,2) is empty? Then (6,1) -> (6,0) blocked, but we don't need to go to (6,0). Then from (6,1) to (5,1) -> (4,1). Then to the pot at (4,0) by standing at (4,1) and facing down.\n\nThis path: (3,3)->(4,3)->(5,3)->(6,3)->(6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> 6 moves? But again, (4,1) might be occupied by Bob? Bob is at (3,1). So if Bob moves, we can free up (3,1) or (4,1).\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob help with the onions? Bob is at (3,1) which is above the pot at (3,0). He can also get onions? But he is far from the onion dispensers.\n\nBut Bob is closer to the plate dispenser? Plate dispenser at (0,2). Bob is at (3,1). He can go to (0,2) to get a plate? But then he can serve the soup once it's cooked.\n\nSo let's assign:\n- Alice: get onions and put them in a pot.\n- Bob: get plates and serve the soup.\n\nBut we need to choose a pot. Let's choose the pot at (3,0) for now.\n\nFor Alice to get an onion and put it in the pot, she must travel a long path. But we can break it down:\n\nFirst, Alice gets an onion:\nTurn 0: Alice does U -> changes orientation to up (since cannot move up to dispenser).\nTurn 1: Alice does I -> gets an onion.\n\nNow she is holding an onion and at (3,3) facing up.\n\nThen she needs to go to the pot at (3,0). But the direct path is blocked. She must go via the left or right.\n\nLet's go left:\nTurn 2: Alice moves left to (2,3). Action L: moves left to (2,3) and faces left.\nTurn 3: Alice moves left to (1,3). Action L.\nTurn 4: Alice moves down to (1,2). Action D: moves down to (1,2) and faces down.\nTurn 5: Alice moves down to (1,1). Action D.\nTurn 6: Alice moves right to (2,1). Action R.\nTurn 7: Alice moves right to (3,1). Action R. But Bob is at (3,1). So if Bob is still there, she cannot move. Therefore, Bob must have moved by turn 7.\n\nNow, Bob at (3,1) can move to free up (3,1). Bob can move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1) or down? But down to (3,0) is not walkable.\n\nSo Bob can move right to (4,1) at some point.\n\nBut Bob also has a role: get a plate. So Bob should go to the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nBob at (3,1) can go to (0,2):\n- (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2). But (0,2) is a plate dispenser -> not walkable. So he must stand adjacent and face it.\n\nThe plate dispenser at (0,2). Adjacent tiles: (0,1) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable), (0,3) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable), (1,2) is walkable.\n\nSo Bob must be at (1,2) and face left to interact with the plate dispenser.\n\nPath for Bob:\n- From (3,1): move left to (2,1) -> move left to (1,1) -> move up to (1,2). Then face left and interact.\n\nBut note: Bob is at (3,1) facing down. \n\nTurn 0 for Bob: we can have him move left to (2,1) and face left.\nTurn 1: move left to (1,1) and face left.\nTurn 2: move up to (1,2) and face up? But then to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2) which is to his left, he must face left. So at (1,2) he can change orientation to left without moving? But if he does L, it will try to move left to (0,2) which is not walkable -> so he will just change orientation to left.\n\nThen Turn 3: interact to get a plate.\n\nBut then he has a plate and needs to go to the pot at (3,0) to serve when the soup is cooked? But the soup isn't cooked yet.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can get the plate later when the soup is almost cooked.\n\nBut let's think: the soup requires 3 onions. Alice is getting one onion now. She needs to make two more trips? That would be inefficient. We have two players, so Bob can also get onions? But Bob is far from the onion dispensers.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob also get onions? But then who gets the plate?\n\nBut note: the cooking time is 5 turns after the third onion is put. So if we put three onions quickly, we can have the soup cook while Bob gets the plate.\n\nBut Alice is the only one getting onions? She has to make three trips. Each trip: \n- Get onion: 2 turns (if she stays at (3,3) to get the next one) but after putting the onion in the pot, she must go back to get another onion.\n\nSo first onion: \n- Alice: turn0: U (face up), turn1: I (get onion). Then she travels to the pot: 7 turns (as above) to reach (3,1) and then turn8: face down and interact to put onion in pot at (3,0). So by turn8, first onion in.\n\nBut then she must go back to (3,3) to get another onion. The return path: from (3,1) to (3,3) is blocked, so she must go around: (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). That's 6 moves. Then at (3,3) she can get another onion in 2 turns (face up and interact). So second onion by turn8+6+2 = turn16. Then travel back to pot: 7 turns? But she is at (3,3) and the pot is at (3,0), same path. So by turn23, second onion in.\n\nThen third onion: again, back to (3,3): 6 turns, get onion: 2 turns, back to pot: 7 turns -> third onion by turn23+6+2+7 = turn38. Then the soup starts cooking at turn38 and takes 5 turns, ready at turn43. Then Bob can serve it.\n\nThis is too slow.\n\nWe need to use both players to get onions.\n\nBut Bob is at (3,1). He can also get onions? But he is far. The onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). Bob is at (3,1). He must travel to (3,3) or (4,3) to be adjacent to a dispenser.\n\nPath for Bob to get an onion:\n- From (3,1) to (3,3): blocked at (3,2) -> so must go around: (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) blocked? (5,2) is a kitchen counter. So then (5,1)->(5,0) blocked? So he must go up from (5,1) to (5,2) is blocked, so he cannot go that way. He must go the other way: (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). 6 moves. Then get onion in 2 turns: face up and interact. Then put the onion in the pot: but then he has to go back to the pot at (3,0): from (3,3) to (3,1) is 2 moves? But blocked, so the long path: 7 moves. So one onion by Bob takes 6+2+7 = 15 turns.\n\nStill slow.\n\nAlternative plan: use the kitchen counters to store onions. Alice can get an onion and place it on a kitchen counter near the pot. Then Bob can pick it up and put it in the pot.\n\nFor example, we can use the kitchen counter at (2,2) or (5,2) but they are blocked. Or (0,0) is far. The kitchen counters near the pot: look at (2,0) is kitchen counter, (5,0) is kitchen counter, but they are at the same row as the pots. We might use the kitchen counter at (2,1) or (4,1)? But (2,1) is not in the kitchen counter list? Only the ones listed are kitchen counters. The list: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). \n\nSo near the pot at (3,0): we have kitchen counters at (2,0) and (0,1) and (2,2) etc. But no kitchen counter at (3,1) or (4,1) or (2,1). (2,1) is walkable and empty? So we can't use it for storage.\n\nThe only storage is the kitchen counters, which are fixed. The closest kitchen counter to the pot at (3,0) is (2,0) or (0,1) or (2,2). (2,2) is at (2,2) which is above (2,1). But (2,1) is walkable.\n\nSo Alice can put an onion on (2,2) if it's empty. But (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so she can place an item there.\n\nHow? She must be at an adjacent empty tile and face the kitchen counter. The adjacent tiles to (2,2) are (2,1) (down), (2,3) (up), (1,2) (left), (3,2) (right). But (2,1) and (2,3) and (1,2) and (3,2) are empty? (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable. (2,3) is empty. (1,2) is empty. (2,1) is empty.\n\nSo Alice can be at (2,3) and face down to interact with (2,2). Or at (1,2) and face right, or at (2,1) and face up.\n\nSimilarly for the pot.\n\nSo new plan:\n\nAlice gets onions and places them on a kitchen counter near the onion dispenser or near the pot? We want to minimize travel.\n\nSince the onion dispenser is at (3,4), Alice can get an onion and then place it on a kitchen counter at (2,4) or (1,4) or (0,4) but those are kitchen counters? (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) are kitchen counters. So (2,4) is a kitchen counter. So she can place the onion on (2,4) if she is at (2,3) and facing up? But (2,4) is above (2,3). \n\nBut (2,3) is empty and walkable.\n\nSo Alice at (3,3) with onion:\n- Move left to (2,3): action L.\n- Then face up and interact with the kitchen counter at (2,4)? But (2,4) is a kitchen counter, so she can place the onion there.\n\nThen she is free to get another onion.\n\nThen Bob can later go to (2,3) and face up to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter, then go to the pot and put it in.\n\nBut Bob is at (3,1), which is far.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can carry the onion to a kitchen counter near the pot. For example, at (2,2) (kitchen counter). She can be at (2,1) or (2,3) or (1,2) or (3,2) but (3,2) is kitchen counter and not walkable.\n\nSo from (3,3) with onion, she can go to (2,3) (move left), then to (2,2) is not walkable, so she must go to (2,3) then to (1,3) then to (1,2) then to (1,1) then to (2,1). Then at (2,1) she can face up to interact with the kitchen counter at (2,2) and place the onion.\n\nThen she is at (2,1) holding nothing. Then she can go back to get another onion: (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). 5 moves. Then get onion in 2 turns. Then carry it to (2,2) again: 5 moves and 1 turn to place. So for two onions: first onion: from (3,3) to (2,3) (1 move), then to (1,3) (1), (1,2) (1), (1,1) (1), (2,1) (1) -> 5 moves, then place: 1 turn (interact) -> total 6 turns for first onion placed at (2,2). Then back: 5 moves to (3,3). Then get onion: 2 turns. Then carry: 5 moves to (2,1) and 1 interact -> 6 turns. Total for two onions: 6+5+2+6 = 19 turns. Then she needs to get a third onion: 5+2 =7 turns to get and carry to (2,1) and place, then the kitchen counter at (2,2) has three onions? But kitchen counters can hold only one item? The rules don't specify, but typically in Overcooked, counters hold one item per counter. So we cannot stack three onions on (2,2). We need three different counters.\n\nBut there are many kitchen counters. We can use (2,2) for one onion, (1,4) for another, but that is far.\n\nAlternatively, after the first onion is placed at (2,2), Bob can pick it up and put it in the pot. Then the kitchen counter is free again.\n\nBut Bob is at (3,1). He can go to (2,1) and face up to interact with (2,2) to pick up the onion. Then he is holding an onion. Then he can face down to interact with the pot at (3,0)? But he is at (2,1), not adjacent to (3,0). He must be at (3,1) and face down to interact with (3,0).\n\nSo he needs to move to (3,1) with the onion. From (2,1) to (3,1) is one move right. Then at (3,1) face down and interact to put the onion in the pot.\n\nSo for one onion from the kitchen counter to the pot: \n- Bob at (3,1) -> move left to (2,1) (1 move), face up and interact to pick up onion from (2,2) (1 turn: interact), then move right to (3,1) (1 move), face down and interact to put in pot (1 turn). Total 4 turns.\n\nThen the kitchen counter at (2,2) is free.\n\nBut Alice is placing onions on (2,2) one by one.\n\nSo overall plan:\n\n- Alice focuses on getting onions and placing them on (2,2).\n- Bob focuses on taking onions from (2,2) and putting them in the pot at (3,0).\n\nAlice's loop:\n1. Get an onion from (3,4): at (3,3) face up and interact (2 turns).\n2. Carry the onion to (2,1): \n   - (3,3) -> (2,3) (L)\n   - (2,3) -> (1,3) (L)\n   - (1,3) -> (1,2) (D)\n   - (1,2) -> (1,1) (D)\n   - (1,1) -> (2,1) (R) -> 5 moves.\n3. At (2,1) face up and interact to place the onion on (2,2) (1 turn).\n\nTotal per onion: 2+5+1 = 8 turns.\n\nBob's loop (for one onion):\n1. At (3,1) -> move left to (2,1) (1 move).\n2. Face up and interact to pick up onion from (2,2) (1 turn).\n3. Move right to (3,1) (1 move).\n4. Face down and interact to put in pot (1 turn).\n\nTotal per onion: 4 turns.\n\nBut they start at the same time. And we have to synchronize.\n\nAlso, the kitchen counter (2,2) can hold only one onion at a time.\n\nSo Alice and Bob must coordinate so that when Alice places an onion, Bob picks it up quickly to free the counter.\n\nBut Alice takes 8 turns per onion, while Bob takes 4 turns per onion. So Bob can do two cycles in the time Alice does one? But we only need three onions.\n\nLet's simulate turns:\n\nTurn 0:\n- Alice: at (3,3) facing down. Action: U (try move up, but can't, so face up).\n- Bob: at (3,1) facing down. We need to assign an action. Bob should move to (2,1) to be ready to pick up the onion that Alice will bring. But Alice hasn't brought it yet. Or Bob can wait.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can start by going to (2,1) and wait.\n\nTurn 0:\n- Alice: U (face up)\n- Bob: L (move left to (2,1) and face left? But then he is at (2,1) facing left. He needs to face up to interact with (2,2). So after moving, he is at (2,1) facing left. Then he can change orientation to up by doing U? But that would try to move up to (2,2) which is not walkable, so he would just face up.\n\nSo for Bob:\nTurn 0: L (move to (2,1), facing left)\nTurn 1: U (face up, without moving)\n\nThen he is ready to interact with (2,2).\n\nMeanwhile, Alice:\nTurn 0: U (face up)\nTurn 1: I (get onion) -> holding onion.\nTurn 2: L (move left to (2,3), facing left)\nTurn 3: L (move left to (1,3), facing left)\nTurn 4: D (move down to (1,2), facing down)\nTurn 5: D (move down to (1,1), facing down)\nTurn 6: R (move right to (2,1), facing right) -> but Bob is at (2,1)? At turn6, Bob is at (2,1) since turn0 and turn1. So if Bob is still at (2,1), Alice cannot move to (2,1) because players cannot walk through each other.\n\nSo we have a conflict at (2,1) at turn6.\n\nBob must vacate (2,1) when Alice is coming.\n\nBob can, after being at (2,1) and facing up, if there's no onion on (2,2), he can move away. But there is no onion yet. So after turn1, Bob is at (2,1) facing up. He can do nothing (stay) for several turns, but then when Alice is coming, he must move.\n\nAlice will arrive at (2,1) at turn6. So at turn6, Bob should not be at (2,1).\n\nBob can, after turn1, move back to (3,1) at turn2.\n\nTurn 2 for Bob: R (move to (3,1), facing right).\n\nThen at turn6, Alice can move to (2,1) without conflict.\n\nThen Alice at turn6: at (2,1) facing right. She needs to face up to place the onion on (2,2). So turn7: U (face up) \nTurn8: I (interact to place onion on (2,2))\n\nThen the kitchen counter (2,2) has an onion.\n\nThen at turn8, Bob can start his work. Bob is at (3,1) facing right. \nTurn8: Bob: L (move to (2,1), facing left) \nTurn9: U (face up) -> now facing the onion on (2,2)\nTurn10: I (pick up onion)\nTurn11: R (move to (3,1), facing right)\nTurn12: D (face down)\nTurn13: I (interact to put onion in pot at (3,0))\n\nNow the pot has one onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice after placing the onion at turn8, she is at (2,1) holding nothing. She can start the next trip. \nTurn8: Alice is at (2,1) after placing, so she is free to move.\nShe needs to go back to (3,3) to get another onion.\n\nPath: (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). 5 moves.\nTurn8: Alice moves left to (1,1) (action L)\nTurn9: U (move to (1,2), facing up)\nTurn10: U (move to (1,3), facing up)\nTurn11: R (move to (2,3), facing right)\nTurn12: R (move to (3,3), facing right)\nTurn13: U (face up) -> because she needs to face up to interact with the dispenser.\nTurn14: I (get onion)\n\nThen carry to (2,1): \nTurn14: after getting onion, she is at (3,3) holding onion, facing up.\nTurn15: L ( to (2,3) )\nTurn16: L ( to (1,3) )\nTurn17: D ( to (1,2) )\nTurn18: D ( to (1,1) )\nTurn19: R ( to (2,1) )\nTurn20: U (face up)\nTurn21: I (place on (2,2))\n\nSo at turn21, the second onion is on (2,2).\n\nBob, after putting the first onion in the pot at turn13, is at (3,1) holding nothing. He can then go to (2,1) to get the second onion when it's available.\n\nBut the second onion is placed at turn21. So Bob can wait or go to (2,1) in advance.\n\nBob at turn13: at (3,1) facing down (after interact).\nHe can then:\nTurn14: S (stay) or move to (2,1) to be ready. But if he moves to (2,1) at turn14, then he is there and can face up. But the onion won't be there until turn21.\n\nSo he can wait at (3,1) until turn20, then move to (2,1) at turn20 or turn21.\n\nLet's have Bob:\nTurn14: S (stay)\n...\nUntil turn20: move to (2,1) with action L (at turn20: move to (2,1) and face left)\nTurn21: U (face up) \nThen at turn21, Alice places the onion, so at turn22, Bob can interact to pick it up.\n\nBut at turn21, Alice is at (2,1) and does I to place. Then immediately after, at turn21, the onion is on (2,2). Then Bob at turn21 is at (2,1) and does U to face up. Then at turn22, Bob can do I to pick up.\n\nThen Bob:\nTurn22: I (pick up onion)\nTurn23: R (move to (3,1), facing right)\nTurn24: D (face down)\nTurn25: I (put in pot) -> now the pot has two onions.\n\nThen for the third onion, Alice will deliver at turn21. Then she goes for the third onion.\n\nAlice after turn21: at (2,1) holding nothing. She goes to (3,3) to get the third onion.\n\nSame as before: 5 moves to (3,3) and then 2 turns to get onion, then 5 moves back to (2,1) and 1 turn to place.\n\nFrom turn21:\nTurn22: Alice: L ( to (1,1) )\nTurn23: U ( to (1,2) )\nTurn24: U ( to (1,3) )\nTurn25: R ( to (2,3) )\nTurn26: R ( to (3,3) )\nTurn27: U (face up)\nTurn28: I (get onion)\nTurn29: L ( to (2,3) )\nTurn30: L ( to (1,3) )\nTurn31: D ( to (1,2) )\nTurn32: D ( to (1,1) )\nTurn33: R ( to (2,1) )\nTurn34: U (face up)\nTurn35: I (place on (2,2)) -> third onion on (2,2) at turn35.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob after turn25 (put second onion) is at (3,1) holding nothing. He can then wait and go to (2,1) at turn34 or turn35.\n\nBob:\nTurn26: S\n...\nTurn34: move to (2,1) with L\nTurn35: U (face up)\nTurn36: I (pick up onion)\nTurn37: R ( to (3,1) )\nTurn38: D (face down)\nTurn39: I (put in pot) -> now the pot has three onions at turn39.\n\nThen the soup starts cooking at turn39. It will be ready at turn39 + 5 = turn44.\n\nThen someone needs to get a plate and serve the soup.\n\nBob is at (3,1) holding nothing after putting the onion. He can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nPath for Bob to (0,2):\n- (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> then at (1,2) face left to interact with plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nActions:\nTurn40: Bob move left to (2,1) (action L)\nTurn41: move left to (1,1) (L)\nTurn42: move up to (1,2) (U) -> now at (1,2) facing up.\nBut to interact with (0,2) which is left, he must face left. So turn43: L (face left, without moving)\nTurn44: I (get plate)\n\nThen he needs to go to the pot at (3,0) to serve the soup. But the soup is ready at turn44. He is at (1,2) holding a plate.\n\nPath to (3,1): (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1). 3 moves.\nTurn45: D ( to (1,1) )\nTurn46: R ( to (2,1) )\nTurn47: R ( to (3,1) )\nTurn48: D (face down)\nTurn49: I (serve the soup) -> delivers the soup, gets the reward.\n\nBut the soup has been ready since turn44, and he serves at turn49, which is fine as long as it doesn't burn? The rules don't mention burning, so it should be okay.\n\nThen the total turns for one soup is 49.\n\nBut we are to plan for the next several turns, say H turns. We don't have to do the whole soup, but we should start the process.\n\nSince the planning is for Alice, and optionally Bob, but the answer format is for Alice's actions. The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only shows actions for Alice? The boxed answer only has Alice's actions.\n\nLet me read: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"\n\nBut the answer format only has turns for Alice. So we only output Alice's actions.\n\nSo for Alice, we need to output her actions for the next H turns. What is H? The problem says \"next several turns (say, H turns)\", but H is not specified. We can choose a reasonable H, say 10 or 20.\n\nBut to be effective, we should at least get the first onion and start moving.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's output Alice's actions for the first 10 turns.\n\nBased on the above, Alice's actions for the first 10 turns:\n\nTurn 0: U (face up)\nTurn 1: I (grab onion)\nTurn 2: L (move left to (2,3))\nTurn 3: L (move left to (1,3))\nTurn 4: D (move down to (1,2))\nTurn 5: D (move down to (1,1))\nTurn 6: R (move right to (2,1))  // assuming Bob has moved away\nTurn 7: U (face up)\nTurn 8: I (place onion on (2,2))\nTurn 9: L (move left to (1,1))  // start of second trip\nTurn10: U (move up to (1,2))\n\nBut we are at turn0 to turn10.\n\nFor the answer, we output from turn t1=0 for Alice.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: I\nTurn 2: L\nTurn 3: L\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: D\nTurn 6: R\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: I\nTurn 9: L\nTurn10: U\n\nBut at turn6, when Alice moves to (2,1), we assumed Bob is not there. We need to coordinate with Bob. But since we are only planning for Alice, we hope that the real Bob will move away.\n\nAlternatively, we can have a more robust plan that avoids dependency on Bob, but it's hard.\n\nSince the problem says \"optionally Bob\", we can also suggest Bob's actions, but the answer format doesn't have a slot for Bob. So we only output Alice's actions.\n\nTherefore, we'll output the above.\n\nNote: at turn8, Alice places the onion on (2,2), which is a kitchen counter. Then she starts the next trip.\n\nThis is a reasonable start.\n\nSo the answer for Alice for turns 0 to 10:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 0:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 1:  I \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2:  L \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3:  L \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4:  D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5:  D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6:  R \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8:  I \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9:  L \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns\". We have planned 11 actions (from turn0 to turn10). The turn0 is the current turn, and we plan for t=0 to t=10, which is 11 turns.\n\nThe problem says: \"at turn t1\", so t1=0, and we plan for the next H turns. So the actions are for turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. So if H=11, we have 11 actions.\n\nBut typically, we might choose a smaller H. However, to show the initial part of the plan, 10 or 11 turns are fine.\n\nWe'll output for 11 turns.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes in *Overcooked*, Alice and Bob must coordinate to efficiently prepare and serve onion soup (requiring 3 onions, cooking for 5 turns, and yielding a 20-point reward). Given the current state (turn 0) and game constraints, the plan focuses on Alice collecting onions and placing them on the kitchen counter at (2,2) for Bob to retrieve and add to a pot. This leverages Alice's proximity to the onion dispenser at (3,4) and Bob's ability to manage pot interactions and future serving.\n\n### Key Coordination Points:\n- **Alice's Role:** Collect onions from (3,4) and place them on the kitchen counter at (2,2) to avoid multiple long trips to the pot. Each onion requires:\n  1. Moving to the dispenser and grabbing an onion.\n  2. Navigating to (2,1) (adjacent to (2,2)) to place the onion.\n- **Bob's Role (Recommended but Not Output):** \n  - Move to (2,1) and face up to pick up onions from (2,2) when available.\n  - Transport onions to the pot at (3,0) (stand at (3,1), face down, and interact).\n  - After all onions are in the pot, get a plate from (0,2) and serve the cooked soup at (3,0).\n- **Pathing:** Alice's path to (2,2) avoids non-walkable tiles (e.g., kitchen counter at (3,2)):\n  - (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (2,1).\n  - Return path for more onions: (2,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).\n\n### Alice's Action Plan for Turns 0 to 10:\n- **Turns 0–1:** Grab the first onion (face up and interact with dispenser).\n- **Turns 2–6:** Move to (2,1) to place the onion on (2,2) (assumes Bob vacates (2,1) by turn 6).\n- **Turns 7–8:** Place the onion on (2,2) (face up and interact).\n- **Turns 9–10:** Start the second onion trip (move toward (1,2)).\n\nAlice's actions are optimized for initial onion gathering and storage, with Bob handling pot filling and serving. This sequence ensures efficient use of turns and sets up the soup preparation within 10+ turns.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 0: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 1: & I \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2: & L \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: & L \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: & D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: & D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: & R \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: & I \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: & L \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

The only recipe provided is Recipe 1: 3 onions, which takes 5 turns to cook and yields 20 reward.\n\nEnvironment details:\n- Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n- Pots at (3,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving counter at (7,2)\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice (me): at (3,3), facing U (up), holding nothing. Action history: S, S, U (so in the last three turns: turn0: S, turn1: S, turn2: U). Since we are at turn3, we are about to choose the action for turn3.\n- Bob: at (6,1), facing R (right), holding nothing. Action history: R, R, R (so in the last three turns: turn0: R, turn1: R, turn2: R). Bob has moved right three times and is now at (6,1).\n\nThe grid is 8x5? (from the tile list, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4). But note the positions: Alice at (3,3), Bob at (6,1).\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob, but the problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" but the answer format only specifies actions for Alice? Actually, the task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" but the answer format only shows one action per turn? Let me read again.\n\nThe task: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" and the answer format is:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\n\nBut note: the problem says \"for both players\", but the answer format only has one action per turn? It might be that we are only to plan for Alice? But the task says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\" and \"plan ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\".\n\nLooking at the answer format: it only shows one action per turn. However, the problem states: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". This might imply that we are to plan for both, but the format only has one line per turn? \n\nBut note: the action history for both players is provided, and we are to plan for both? However, the answer format does not specify which player. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" and the answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nIt does not specify which player the action is for. But the context is that we are controlling Alice? The task says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", and we are to plan for Alice. But then what about Bob? The problem says \"and optionally Bob\", meaning we can also plan Bob's actions? But the answer format doesn't have two actions per turn.\n\nThis is ambiguous. However, in the context of the problem, we are probably only to output Alice's actions, and assume Bob is controlled by another agent (the teammate) and we have to collaborate. But the problem says \"plan for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", meaning we might be able to control both? But the answer format doesn't have two actions per turn.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we are to output a joint plan? But the format doesn't specify. \n\nLooking at the problem again: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" and the answer format is a sequence of actions. Since the problem says \"for Alice\", I think we are to output only Alice's actions. We have to assume that Bob will act independently, but we can coordinate by our actions.\n\nBut note: the task says \"optimize coordination\", so we have to consider Bob's actions as well. However, we cannot control Bob? The problem says \"optionally Bob\", meaning we can choose to also plan for Bob? But if we do, how to represent two actions per turn? The answer format doesn't allow it.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think we should only output Alice's actions, and assume Bob will act in a way that we can predict or coordinate with. But we don't know Bob's policy. However, we can assume Bob is rational and will cooperate? But we don't have Bob's plan.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect that we plan for both and output two actions per turn? But the format doesn't show that. The example answer format only has one action per turn.\n\nI think the intended interpretation is that we are only controlling Alice. So we output Alice's actions, and we must assume that Bob is an independent agent. However, we can use the history to predict Bob's next moves? But we don't have a model for Bob.\n\nGiven the constraints, we must plan for Alice and hope that Bob will coordinate. Alternatively, we can plan for both and then output only Alice's actions? But then the plan must be robust to Bob's actions? That seems too vague.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", meaning we can assume Bob is also trying to maximize the reward. So we can plan assuming Bob will do the optimal thing? But we don't know Bob's state.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan for both players? But the answer format doesn't allow two actions. So I think we are only to output Alice's actions.\n\nBut then how to collaborate? We can choose actions for Alice that are best given that Bob is also acting optimally? We can simulate the joint actions? But we don't know what Bob will do.\n\nGiven the challenge, I will plan for both players and then output only Alice's actions. For Bob, I will assume he will act optimally to achieve the goal. Then, when outputting, we only show Alice's actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan a sequence for Alice that is independent of Bob? But that might not be optimal.\n\nGiven the time, let me try to plan a joint plan and then extract Alice's actions.\n\nGoal: we want to make a soup of 3 onions and deliver it. We have two pots: (3,0) and (4,0). The recipe takes 5 turns to cook.\n\nWe need 3 onions and then a plate to serve.\n\nCurrent state: both players are empty-handed.\n\nAlice is at (3,3) facing up. Bob is at (6,1) facing right.\n\nThe onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). The plate dispenser is at (0,2). The serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nPlan:\n\nWe need to get onions to a pot. Since there are two pots and two players, we can use both. But note: one recipe requires 3 onions in one pot. So we can use one pot to make one soup.\n\nAlternatively, we can make two soups? But the recipe is the same, and we have two pots. However, we don't have enough information about the cooking time? But we know the recipe: 5 turns for 3 onions.\n\nBut we are at turn 3. We can plan for one soup first.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Get onions and put in a pot.\n\n2. Wait for the soup to cook (5 turns).\n\n3. Get a plate and serve the soup.\n\nBut we have two players. We can divide the work.\n\nLet me assign:\n\nAlice: get an onion and put it in the pot at (3,0). Then, after the pot is filled, get a plate and serve.\n\nBut the pot requires 3 onions, so we need three trips? But we have two players.\n\nAlternatively, we can have both players get onions and put them in the same pot? But the pot can hold up to 3 ingredients. So if we use one pot, we need three onion deliveries.\n\nBut we can also use both pots? Then we can make two soups? But we only have one plate dispenser? And one serving counter? We can do sequentially.\n\nBut the reward is per soup, so two soups would yield 40. But let's see if we can do that.\n\nHowever, we are at turn 3 and we are planning for H turns? We don't know H, but we can plan until we deliver one soup? Or as far as needed.\n\nBut the problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". So we have to choose H? We can set H to be the time to deliver one soup? Or two? Let's compute the minimum steps.\n\nFirst, for one soup:\n\n- Get three onions to the pot. Each onion requires: going to the dispenser, grabbing, then going to the pot and putting.\n\nBut note: the dispenser is at (3,4) and (4,4). The pot is at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nAlice is at (3,3). She can move down to (3,2) and then? To get an onion: she must be adjacent to the dispenser and facing it. The onion dispenser at (3,4) is above (3,3)? But she is at (3,3) and facing U. So if she moves up to (3,4)? But (3,4) is an onion dispenser, which is non-empty, so she cannot walk onto it. She must stand adjacent and face it.\n\nAdjacent to (3,4): the tiles are (3,3), (2,4), (4,4), (3,5) [but y=5 is out of bound? The grid: y from 0 to 4? So (3,4) is at the top? Then adjacent: (3,3) below, (2,4) left, (4,4) right. There is no (3,5).\n\nSo to interact with (3,4) from (3,3): Alice is at (3,3) and facing U (up) - that is towards (3,4). So she is adjacent and facing it. So she can interact to grab an onion? But she must be empty-handed.\n\nCurrently, Alice is at (3,3), facing U, holding nothing. So she can interact now to grab an onion from (3,4). Then she would be holding an onion.\n\nThen, she can move down to the pot at (3,0). How? From (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1) to (3,0). But note: at (3,0) is a pot. She must be adjacent and facing the pot to put the onion in.\n\nAt (3,0), the adjacent tiles: (3,1) above, (2,0) left, (4,0) right. So she can stand at (3,1) and face down (D) to interact with the pot? Or stand at (2,0) or (4,0) and face left or right? But (2,0) is a kitchen counter? And (4,0) is a pot? (4,0) is also a pot, but that's a different pot.\n\nSo for the pot at (3,0), the adjacent empty tiles are (3,1) and (2,0) and (4,0)? But (2,0) is a kitchen counter? According to the tile list: (2,0) is a kitchen counter? Yes: Kitchen Counter: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), ...]. So (2,0) is a kitchen counter, which is non-empty? Actually, the problem says \"non-empty tile\" meaning it has an item? But the kitchen counter can be empty? The problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and in the current state: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter: All kitchen counters are empty.\" So (2,0) is a kitchen counter tile, but currently empty? So is it walkable? The rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But a kitchen counter is a tile type that is non-empty only if it has an item? Otherwise, it is walkable? The rules say: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and \"Kitchen Counter\" is a different type. The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and \"non-empty\" probably means that the tile has an item? Or the tile type is not empty? Let me check.\n\nThe rules: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then other types (Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter) are non-empty? But the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning non-empty as in having an item? Or the tile type? The tile types are fixed. The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" This is ambiguous.\n\nBut in the Interact action: \"Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\" So the tile they are standing on must be an empty tile? So the player must be on an empty tile? Then, the non-empty tiles (like dispenser, pot, etc.) cannot be walked on? Because they are non-empty? That makes sense.\n\nSo: the grid has different tile types. The walkable tiles are only the empty tiles? But what about kitchen counters? The problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it can be occupied or not? But the tile itself is non-empty? Or when it has an item, it becomes non-empty? The rule: \"non-empty tile\" in the context of walking? Probably, the tile types that are not \"Empty Tile\" are non-empty and cannot be walked on? Because the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are the ones that are not empty? So only empty tiles are walkable.\n\nBut then, how to interact with a kitchen counter? You must stand on an adjacent empty tile and face the kitchen counter.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo in the grid, the walkable tiles are only the empty ones? And the non-empty tiles (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are obstacles? But note: the kitchen counter is listed as a tile type, and it can be empty? But the tile type is \"Kitchen Counter\", which is not an empty tile? So it is non-empty? Then it is not walkable.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me re-read:\n\n\"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" -> so only these are walkable.\n\nThen, the others (Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter) are non-empty tiles? So players cannot walk on them.\n\nSo the player must be on an empty tile to interact with an adjacent non-empty tile.\n\nTherefore, for Alice to get an onion from (3,4): she must stand on an adjacent empty tile. The adjacent empty tiles to (3,4) are (3,3), (2,4), (4,4). But (2,4) and (4,4) are kitchen counters? (2,4) is a kitchen counter? The list: Kitchen Counter: ... (2,4) is in the list. So (2,4) is a kitchen counter, non-walkable. Similarly, (4,4) is an onion dispenser? Onion dispenser at (3,4) and (4,4)? (4,4) is an onion dispenser, so non-walkable. The only adjacent empty tile to (3,4) is (3,3). So Alice must be at (3,3) and face up to interact with (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, for the pot at (3,0): adjacent empty tiles? The tiles around (3,0): (3,1), (2,0), (4,0). But (2,0) and (4,0) are non-walkable: (2,0) is kitchen counter, (4,0) is a pot. So only (3,1) is adjacent and walkable? But (3,1) is not in the kitchen counter list? Let me check the kitchen counter list: it includes (0,0) to (7,0) only some? (3,0) is a pot, so not a kitchen counter. (3,1) is not in the kitchen counter list? The list: Kitchen Counter: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)].\n\nSo (3,1) is not in the list? Then it must be an empty tile? Because the only non-empty tiles are the ones listed? The tile types are given by the lists. So if (3,1) is not in any of the non-empty tile lists, then it is an empty tile? So walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is not listed? So empty? And (2,1) is not in the list? Also empty.\n\nSo for pot (3,0), the adjacent tile (3,1) is empty and walkable. So Alice can stand at (3,1) and face down (D) to interact with the pot.\n\nSimilarly, for the other pot at (4,0), she can stand at (4,1) and face down.\n\nNow, back to Alice: at (3,3) facing U. She can interact to get an onion from (3,4). Then she is holding an onion. Then she needs to go to (3,1) to put the onion in the pot at (3,0). How? From (3,3) to (3,2) to (3,1). Then at (3,1), face down (D) and interact to put the onion in the pot.\n\nBut note: moving down: from (3,3) to (3,2): is (3,2) walkable? (3,2) is in the kitchen counter list? The list: (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes: \"Kitchen Counter: ... (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)\". So (3,2) is a kitchen counter, non-walkable. So she cannot move down to (3,2).\n\nProblem: the path is blocked. How to get from (3,3) to (3,1)? The direct path is blocked by the kitchen counter at (3,2).\n\nAlternative path: go left or right.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) go left to (2,3). Is (2,3) walkable? Not in the kitchen counter list? The list: (0,3) and (7,3) are kitchen counters. So (2,3) is not listed? So empty. Then from (2,3) go down to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, in the list. So cannot go down to (2,2). Then from (2,3) go down? (2,2) is blocked, so she can go to (2,3) and then? To (2,4)? But (2,4) is a kitchen counter? Yes. Or to (1,3)? Let me see: (1,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? The list has (0,3) and (7,3). So (1,3) is empty? Yes.\n\nSo possible path: \n- From (3,3) move left to (2,3) [empty]\n- Then move left to (1,3) [empty]\n- Then move down to (1,2) [is (1,2) empty? Not in kitchen counter list? The list: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) are kitchen counters. (1,2) is not listed? So empty? Yes.\n- Then move down to (1,1) [empty? Yes, not in list]\n- Then move down to (1,0) [but (1,0) is a kitchen counter? In the list: (1,0) is a kitchen counter? Yes: (1,0) is in the list. So cannot go to (1,0). Then from (1,1) to (2,1) [empty? Not in list? Yes] then to (3,1) [empty? Yes].\n\nBut that is long: 5 moves? And then to (3,1) to put the onion.\n\nBut we have Bob. Bob is at (6,1) facing right. He can help.\n\nBob can get onions and put in a pot? Or get plates.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). Bob is at (6,1). He can go to (0,2) to get a plate? But that is far.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the pot at (4,0) which is closer to the onion dispenser at (4,4)? But the path from (4,4) to (4,0) is blocked at (4,2)? Because (4,2) is a kitchen counter.\n\nSo similarly, the vertical paths are blocked at y=2 for x=3 and x=4.\n\nSo we need to go around.\n\nGiven the time, let's plan for one soup in the pot at (3,0) or (4,0). We choose one.\n\nLet me choose pot at (3,0).\n\nWe need three onions.\n\nAlice can get one onion now: at turn3, she is at (3,3) facing U, so she can interact to get an onion. Then she is holding an onion.\n\nThen she must go to (3,1) to put it in the pot. How? She can go left to (2,3), then down to (2,1)? But from (2,3) to (2,2) is blocked? (2,2) is kitchen counter. So she must go (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1). That's 5 moves? Plus the interact to get the onion, so 6 actions to put one onion? That is too long.\n\nAlternatively, she can go right to (4,3). Is (4,3) empty? Not in kitchen counter list? Yes. Then down to (4,2) is blocked? (4,2) is kitchen counter. So then right to (5,3) [empty? (5,3) not in list? But the list has (5,2) kitchen counter, but (5,3) is not listed? So empty. Then down to (5,2) is blocked. So she has to go to (5,3) then to (5,4)? (5,4) is kitchen counter? Yes. Or to (6,3)? (6,3) not in list? Empty. Then down to (6,2) [empty? The list has (6,4) and (6,0) and (6,1)? (6,1) is not in the kitchen counter list? The list: (6,0) kitchen counter, (6,4) kitchen counter. (6,1) and (6,2) and (6,3) are not in the list? So empty. So she can go (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (6,0) is kitchen counter, so cannot. Then to (5,1) [empty? Yes] -> (4,1) [empty] -> (3,1) [empty]. That's 7 moves? Even longer.\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nPerhaps use the other pot? Or have Bob help.\n\nBob is at (6,1) facing right. He can move right to (7,1)? But (7,1) is a kitchen counter? In the list: (7,1) is kitchen counter, so he cannot walk onto it. So he must change orientation or move in other directions.\n\nHe can move up to (6,2) [empty? Yes] or down to (6,0) [kitchen counter, no]. So only up to (6,2).\n\nFrom (6,2), he can move left to (5,2) [kitchen counter, no] or right to (7,2) [serving counter, non-walkable]. Or up to (6,3) [empty].\n\nSo he is a bit stuck.\n\nBut he can go to the onion dispenser? The onion dispenser at (3,4) and (4,4) are far.\n\nAlternatively, he can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2). But that is far.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's try to have Alice and Bob work on different tasks.\n\nAlice is close to the onion dispenser. She can get one onion and put it in the pot, but the path to the pot is blocked. However, there are kitchen counters that can be used to temporarily store items? For example, Alice can place the onion on a kitchen counter near the pot, and then Bob can pick it up and put it in the pot.\n\nBut we need to deliver three onions to the same pot.\n\nPlan for one soup:\n\n1. Alice gets an onion from (3,4) at turn3: she is at (3,3) facing U, so she can interact (I) to grab an onion.\n\n2. Then, she needs to move to a kitchen counter near the pot to drop the onion. For example, the kitchen counter at (2,0) or (1,0) or (0,0)? But those are at the bottom. Or at (3,2) is a kitchen counter, but (3,2) is adjacent to (3,3)? (3,2) is at (3,2), which is below (3,3). But Alice is at (3,3) and (3,2) is adjacent below. But (3,2) is a kitchen counter, so non-walkable, but she can interact with it to place the onion? But to interact, she must be on an adjacent empty tile and facing the kitchen counter. She is at (3,3), which is above (3,2), so if she faces down (D), she can interact with (3,2) to place the onion there, because she is holding an item and the kitchen counter is empty (current state: all kitchen counters are empty).\n\nSo after grabbing the onion, she can turn to face down (D) and then interact to place the onion on (3,2).\n\nThen, the onion is on (3,2).\n\nThen, Alice is free to get another onion.\n\nSimilarly, she can place multiple onions on the kitchen counter at (3,2)? But the kitchen counter can hold only one item? The rules don't specify, but typically in Overcooked, a counter holds one item. So we can use multiple counters.\n\nThere is a kitchen counter at (2,2) and (4,2) and (5,2) as well.\n\nSo we can use these as buffers.\n\nThen, Bob can be in charge of taking the onions from the counters and putting them in the pot.\n\nBob is at (6,1). He can move to (6,2) [empty] then to (5,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable. So he can only go up to (6,3) or down to (6,0) which is blocked. So from (6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (5,3) [empty] to (5,2) is blocked, so to (4,3) [empty] etc. to get to the counters at y=2.\n\nBut it's far.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can do both: get onions and put them in the pot via the counters.\n\nFor example, after placing the onion on (3,2), she can get another onion from (3,4): she is at (3,3) after placing, facing down? After placing, she is still at (3,3) holding nothing. Then she can face up and interact to get another onion. Then place it on another counter, e.g., (4,2) or (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is adjacent to (2,3) and (3,2)? Alice is at (3,3), she can move left to (2,3) [empty], then face down to interact with (2,2) to place the onion.\n\nSimilarly for (4,2): she can move right to (4,3) [empty], then face down to interact.\n\nBut then, to put the onions in the pot, someone has to move them from the counter to the pot.\n\nFor example, to put an onion from (3,2) into the pot at (3,0): a player must be at (3,1) or (2,2) or (4,2) or (3,3)? But (2,2) and (4,2) are kitchen counters, not walkable. (3,3) is above. So only (3,1) is adjacent empty tile.\n\nFrom (3,1), facing up (U) to interact with (3,2) to pick up the onion? But (3,2) is the kitchen counter with the onion. Then, after picking up, the player can move to face down (D) to interact with the pot at (3,0).\n\nSimilarly for other counters.\n\nBut Alice is at (3,3) or (2,3), not at (3,1).\n\nSo she would have to go to (3,1) to do that.\n\nHow to get to (3,1)? As before, via a detour.\n\nFrom (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1). That's 5 moves.\n\nThen at (3,1), she can face up to interact with (3,2) to pick up the onion, then face down to interact with the pot to put it in.\n\nSo many turns.\n\nAlternatively, have Bob help. Bob is at (6,1). He can move to (3,1) to help.\n\nPath for Bob: (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) is blocked, so he must go around: (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1). That's 6 moves for Bob to reach (3,1).\n\nThen he can do the job.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nGiven the time, we must start acting.\n\nAt turn3, Alice can grab an onion.\n\nThen at turn4, she can face down and interact to place it on (3,2).\n\nThen at turn5, she can face up and interact to grab another onion.\n\nThen at turn6, she can move left to (2,3) and face down to interact with (2,2) to place the onion there.\n\nThen at turn7, she can move back to (3,3) and face up to grab a third onion.\n\nThen at turn8, she can place it on (4,2) or on (3,2) but (3,2) already has one? We placed one on (3,2) and one on (2,2). So we can use (4,2) for the third.\n\nTo place on (4,2): from (3,3) move right to (4,3) [empty], then face down and interact to place on (4,2).\n\nThen we have three onions on counters: (3,2), (2,2), (4,2).\n\nThen, Alice can go to (3,1) to start putting them in the pot.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (3,1): long path.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can be moving to (3,1) to help.\n\nBut it will take many turns.\n\nThen, after the onions are in the pot, it takes 5 turns to cook, then someone must get a plate and serve.\n\nThis seems very long.\n\nPerhaps use the serving counter or other, but I think it's the only way.\n\nGiven the constraints, let's start with Alice's actions for the next few turns.\n\nFor turn3: Alice is at (3,3) facing U, holding nothing. She can interact to grab an onion from (3,4). So action: I.\n\nThen for turn4: she can change orientation to down (D) to face the kitchen counter (3,2) below her. Action: D (change orientation to down).\n\nThen for turn5: she can interact to place the onion on (3,2). Action: I.\n\nThen for turn6: she can change orientation to up (U) to face the onion dispenser again. Action: U.\n\nThen for turn7: interact to grab another onion. Action: I.\n\nThen for turn8: move left to (2,3). Action: L.\n\nThen for turn9: change orientation to down (D) to face the kitchen counter (2,2). Action: D.\n\nThen for turn10: interact to place the onion on (2,2). Action: I.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this is only for the first two onions, and we haven't put any in the pot yet.\n\nBob can be doing something. For example, at turn3, Bob is at (6,1) facing right. He can move up to (6,2) (action U), then at turn4 move up to (6,3) (U), then at turn5 move left to (5,3) (L), then turn6 left to (4,3) (L), then turn7 left to (3,3) (L). But at turn7, Alice is at (3,3) and Bob wants to move to (3,3)? But players cannot walk onto each other. So at turn7, Alice is at (3,3) and Bob at (4,3), if Bob moves left to (3,3), it is occupied by Alice, so he cannot. So he must wait or go around.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we only output Alice's actions, we can output a sequence for Alice.\n\nBut the plan must be for H turns. We can choose H=10 or so.\n\nBut the reward won't be obtained within 10 turns because the soup takes 5 turns to cook after the third onion is put in.\n\nSo perhaps we plan until the soup is cooking, and then continue.\n\nBut the problem says to maximize the total reward, so we might need to plan beyond.\n\nGiven the time, I will output Alice's actions for the next few turns to start the process.\n\nAt turn3: I (grab onion)\nAt turn4: D (face down to interact with kitchen counter)\nAt turn5: I (place onion on (3,2))\nAt turn6: U (face up to grab another onion)\nAt turn7: I (grab second onion)\nAt turn8: L (move left to (2,3))\nAt turn9: D (face down to interact with (2,2))\nAt turn10: I (place onion on (2,2))\nAt turn11: R (move right to (3,3))\nAt turn12: U (face up)\nAt turn13: I (grab third onion)\nAt turn14: R (move right to (4,3))\nAt turn15: D (face down to interact with (4,2))\nAt turn16: I (place onion on (4,2))\n\nThen, Alice can go to (3,1) to start moving onions to the pot.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (3,1): \n- Turn17: L ( to (3,3) )\n- Turn18: L ( to (2,3) )\n- Turn19: D? But (2,2) is kitchen counter, so cannot move down. So turn19: D (change orientation down? But to move, she must go to (1,3) or (2,4)? (2,4) is kitchen counter. So turn19: L to (1,3)\n- Turn20: D to (1,2) [assuming (1,2) is empty]\n- Turn21: D to (1,1)\n- Turn22: R to (2,1)\n- Turn23: R to (3,1)\n\nThen at (3,1), she can face up (U) to interact with (3,2) to pick up the onion.\n\nTurn24: U (face up)\nTurn25: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\nTurn26: D (face down to interact with pot at (3,0))\nTurn27: I (put onion in pot)\n\nThen similarly for the other onions.\n\nThis is taking too many turns. We need a better plan.\n\nPerhaps use only one kitchen counter and have multiple onions on it? But the counter can hold only one item, so not possible.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can get an onion and then go directly to (3,1) by the detour, carrying the onion.\n\nFor example, after grabbing the onion at turn3, at turn4: move left to (2,3)\nTurn5: move left to (1,3)\nTurn6: move down to (1,2)\nTurn7: move down to (1,1)\nTurn8: move right to (2,1)\nTurn9: move right to (3,1)\nTurn10: face down (D)\nTurn11: interact to put onion in pot.\n\nThen for the second onion, she can go back.\n\nBut that's 11 turns for one onion.\n\nThen she needs to do that three times, 33 turns, plus cooking time, etc.\n\nThis is not efficient.\n\nGiven the time constraints of the response, I will output a short sequence for Alice to start the process, and hope that Bob will help.\n\nSo for the next few turns:\n\nTurn3: I  # grab onion\nTurn4: D  # face down to be ready to place on (3,2)\nTurn5: I  # place onion on (3,2)\nTurn6: U  # face up to grab another\nTurn7: I  # grab second onion\nTurn8: L  # move left to (2,3)\nTurn9: D  # face down to place on (2,2)\nTurn10: I # place on (2,2)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, we need to output for Alice only.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify H, we can output for the next 5 turns or 10 turns.\n\nI think for practicality, I'll output for the next 5 turns: turns 3 to 7.\n\nTurn3: I\nTurn4: D\nTurn5: I\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: I\n\nThen she has two onions on counters and is about to place the third.\n\nBut this is not optimal, but it's a start.\n\nPerhaps have Alice and Bob work on different pots.\n\nFor example, Alice uses the pot at (3,0) and Bob uses the pot at (4,0).\n\nBut Bob is far away.\n\nBob can go to the other onion dispenser at (4,4).\n\nBob is at (6,1). He can move to (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), then to (4,4) is not walkable, so he must be at (4,3) and face up to interact with (4,4).\n\nSo turn3: Bob moves U to (6,2)\nTurn4: U to (6,3)\nTurn5: L to (5,3)\nTurn6: L to (4,3)\nTurn7: U (face up)\nTurn8: I (grab onion)\n\nThen he can put it in the pot at (4,0) by going to (4,1) and facing down.\n\nBut to (4,1): from (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked, so he must go around: (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1). Many turns.\n\nSo not better.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will output for Alice the sequence to grab and place two onions, and assume that we can continue later.\n\nSo for turns 3 to 7:\n\nTurn3: I  # grab onion from (3,4)\nTurn4: D  # change orientation to down to face (3,2)\nTurn5: I  # place onion on (3,2)\nTurn6: U  # change orientation to up to face (3,4)\nTurn7: I  # grab second onion\n\nThen for turns 8-10, we can output later, but the answer should be for a sequence.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify H, we can choose H=5 or H=10.\n\nI think for this response, I'll output for the next 5 turns: turns 3 to 7.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: I\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: I\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: I\n}\n\nThis is a start, and in practice, we would continue the plan in subsequent turns.\n\nBut for the sake of the problem, this might be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice after grabbing the second onion go directly to the pot area, but it takes many turns.\n\nI think the above is reasonable for the first few turns.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes in *Overcooked*, Alice and Bob must collaborate efficiently to prepare and deliver a soup of 3 onions, which rewards 20 points and cooks in 5 turns. Given the current game state at turn 3:\n\n- Alice is at (3, 3), facing up (U), holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (6, 1), facing right (R), holding nothing.\n- All kitchen counters are empty, and all pots are empty.\n- Onion dispensers are at (3, 4) and (4, 4), the plate dispenser is at (0, 2), pots are at (3, 0) and (4, 0), and the serving counter is at (7, 2).\n\n### Coordination Plan\nThe optimal strategy involves Alice focusing on gathering onions and using the kitchen counter at (3, 2) as temporary storage, while Bob should move toward the plate dispenser at (0, 2) to fetch a plate for future serving. This leverages Alice's proximity to the onion dispenser at (3, 4) and Bob's position to handle plate retrieval, ensuring parallel task execution. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Alice collects onions and stores them on the kitchen counter at (3, 2)**:\n   - At turn 3, Alice interacts (I) with the onion dispenser at (3, 4) to grab an onion.\n   - She then faces down (D) to interact with the kitchen counter at (3, 2) and places the onion there.\n   - She repeats this to collect and store a second onion.\n\n2. **Bob moves toward the plate dispenser**:\n   - Bob should move up (U) to (6, 2), then left (L) repeatedly to reach (0, 2). This avoids non-walkable tiles (e.g., kitchen counters) and is efficient given his starting position and orientation.\n\n3. **Future turns (beyond the planned sequence)**:\n   - Alice will collect a third onion, then move to (3, 1) via a detour (e.g., (3, 3) → (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (1, 2) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (3, 1)) to access the pot at (3, 0).\n   - She will move stored onions from (3, 2) to the pot at (3, 0) by facing up (U) to pick up from the counter and down (D) to interact with the pot.\n   - Once the pot has 3 onions, it cooks automatically in 5 turns.\n   - Bob will grab a plate from (0, 2) and deliver the cooked soup to the serving counter at (7, 2) for 20 points.\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Efficiency**: Alice starts gathering onions immediately using her position and orientation, minimizing initial moves. Storing onions on (3, 2) avoids long detours to the pot early on.\n- **Collaboration**: Alice handles onion gathering, while Bob fetches plates, dividing labor based on proximity.\n- **Constraints**: Paths avoid non-walkable tiles (e.g., kitchen counters at y=2), and players do not block each other in this sequence.\n- **Reward Maximization**: This sets up the first soup for delivery. With more turns, additional soups can be made for higher rewards.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (Turns 3 to 7)\nAlice's actions for turns 3 to 7 focus on collecting and storing two onions, enabling Bob to start moving toward the plate dispenser. This sequence ensures rapid progress toward recipe completion.\n\n```\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: I\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: I\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: I\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Turn 3 (I)**: Alice interacts with the onion dispenser at (3, 4) (adjacent and facing it) to grab an onion.\n- **Turn 4 (D)**: Alice changes orientation to down (D) to face the kitchen counter at (3, 2).\n- **Turn 5 (I)**: Alice interacts to place the onion on the empty kitchen counter at (3, 2).\n- **Turn 6 (U)**: Alice changes orientation to up (U) to face the onion dispenser at (3, 4) again.\n- **Turn 7 (I)**: Alice interacts to grab a second onion.\n\nAfter turn 7, Alice will be at (3, 3), holding the second onion, and can continue by moving left to (2, 3) to store it on another kitchen counter (e.g., at (2, 2)) or begin moving toward the pot. Bob should execute: Turn 3: U, Turn 4: U, Turn 5: L, Turn 6: L, Turn 7: L (reaching (3, 3) but since Alice is there, he may need to wait or adjust—coordination avoids conflict). This plan maximizes the likelihood of delivering the first soup quickly.",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 6 (t1=6). We need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob, but the task is to plan for Alice) for the next several turns to maximize the reward.\n\nGoal: Deliver soup recipes. The only recipe we have is Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n\nEnvironment details:\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (3,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice: at (2,3), facing left (L), holding one onion.\n- Bob: at (5,3), facing left (L), holding nothing.\n\nKitchen counters are all empty, and pots are empty.\n\nWe need to make soup with 3 onions. Since we have one onion already with Alice, we need two more onions and then cook them in a pot. After cooking, we need a plate to serve the soup and then deliver it at (7,2).\n\nPlan:\n1. Alice is at (2,3) holding an onion. We need to put that onion into a pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The closest pot is at (3,0) or (4,0). From (2,3) to (3,0): \n   - First, we need to move down to (2,2). Then left to (1,2)? But note: the grid has kitchen counters at (2,2) and (3,2) etc. Let me check the tile types.\n\nTile types for kitchen counters: \n   (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\nSo (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable? But note the rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and kitchen counters are non-empty? Actually, the rules say \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and they are listed as non-empty? But in the current state, it says \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter: All kitchen counters are empty.\" So the tile is still there and we cannot walk on it? \n\nThe rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those that have an object (like a dispenser, pot, counter with item, etc.). But the kitchen counter itself is a tile that is non-empty? Actually, the rule says \"non-empty tiles\" meaning tiles that are occupied by an object. The tile types are fixed, and we can only walk on empty tiles. The grid has:\n- Empty tiles: walkable.\n- Dispensers, Pots, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter: non-empty, so we cannot walk on them.\n\nBut note: the player can only move to an empty tile. So we must avoid non-empty tiles.\n\nSo the grid layout:\n\nWe have the following non-empty tiles (from the list):\n\nKitchen Counters: \n  (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\nOnion Dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\nPlate Dispenser: (0,2)\nPots: (3,0), (4,0)\nServing Counter: (7,2)\n\nSo the walkable tiles are the rest.\n\nNow, Alice at (2,3). Adjacent tiles: \n- Left: (1,3) -> is that walkable? (1,3) is not in the non-empty list -> so it's walkable? But wait, the non-empty list includes kitchen counters? (0,3) and (7,3) are non-empty, but (1,3) is not listed -> so it's empty? Similarly, (2,3) is not listed as non-empty? Actually, (2,3) is not in the non-empty list, so it is walkable? But Alice is standing on (2,3) and it's empty? The non-empty list is for tiles that are non-empty (i.e., have an object). So (2,3) is empty -> walkable.\n\nBut note: (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so we cannot step on it.\n\nSo from (2,3), we can move to:\n- Left: (1,3) -> empty? (1,3) is not in the non-empty list -> so yes.\n- Right: (3,3) -> not in non-empty? -> yes, but let me check: non-empty at (3,2) and (4,2) are below, but (3,3) is not listed -> so empty.\n- Down: (2,2) -> non-empty (kitchen counter) -> cannot move down.\n- Up: (2,4) -> non-empty (kitchen counter) -> cannot move up.\n\nSo Alice can only move left to (1,3) or right to (3,3). \n\nWe want to go to a pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). We are at (2,3). How to get to (3,0)? We need to go down to (2,2) but that is blocked. So we must go around.\n\nPossible path: \nOption 1: \n  (2,3) -> right to (3,3) -> then down to (3,2) is blocked? (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. So we cannot go down from (3,3) to (3,2). Then how?\n\nAlternative: from (3,3) we can go right to (4,3) -> then down? (4,3) is empty? (4,3) is not in non-empty -> so yes. Then from (4,3) we can go down to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter) -> blocked.\n\nSo we must go via the sides? \n\nLooking at the grid, the central area might be blocked by kitchen counters? Let me visualize:\n\nRow y=4: non-empty at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) and also onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) -> so (3,4) and (4,4) are non-empty. So row y=4: only (3,4) and (4,4) are non-empty? But also the kitchen counters at (0,4), (1,4), etc. So the walkable tiles in row 4 are only (3,4) and (4,4) are non-empty? Then (3,4) and (4,4) are onion dispensers -> non-empty. So row y=4: no walkable tile? But wait, the player at (2,3) and (5,3) are at y=3.\n\nRow y=3: non-empty at (0,3) and (7,3). So (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) are walkable? Because not listed as non-empty.\n\nRow y=2: non-empty: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) -> so entire row? Then we cannot walk on row y=2.\n\nRow y=1: non-empty: (0,1) and (7,1). So (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) are walkable.\n\nRow y=0: non-empty: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0) and pots at (3,0) and (4,0) -> so (3,0) and (4,0) are non-empty (pots). So row y=0: only (3,0) and (4,0) are non-empty? But also the kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), etc. So the walkable tiles in row0? None? Because all are non-empty? Actually, the pots are at (3,0) and (4,0) and kitchen counters at the others. So row0: no walkable tile.\n\nBut we need to access the pots. How? The pots are non-empty, so we can stand adjacent and face them to interact.\n\nSo to use a pot at (3,0), we must stand on an adjacent empty tile and face the pot. Adjacent to (3,0): \n- Left: (2,0) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot stand.\n- Right: (4,0) -> pot -> non-empty -> cannot stand.\n- Up: (3,1) -> is that walkable? (3,1) is not in non-empty list? In row y=1: non-empty are (0,1) and (7,1). So (3,1) is walkable.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,0), adjacent: (4,1) is walkable.\n\nSo the access to pot (3,0) is from (3,1) above, and for (4,0) from (4,1) above.\n\nSo we need to get to (3,1) or (4,1) to use the pots.\n\nNow, how to get from (2,3) to (3,1) or (4,1)? \n\nWe cannot go through row2 because it's blocked. So we must go via row3 to row1? But row3 and row1 are connected? We can go from (3,3) to (3,2)? No, (3,2) is non-empty. So we must go around the kitchen counters.\n\nLooking at the grid, the only way to get to row1 is by going to the sides? For example:\n\nFrom (2,3) we can go left to (1,3) -> then down to (1,2) -> but (1,2) is not listed as non-empty? Wait, the non-empty kitchen counters at row2: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (1,2) is not listed -> so it's empty? Then we can go to (1,2). Then from (1,2) we can go down to (1,1) -> which is walkable. Then from (1,1) we can go right to (2,1)? (2,1) is walkable? Then to (3,1). \n\nAlternatively, from (2,3) go right to (3,3) -> then right to (4,3) -> then down? (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked. So we must go left? Or go to (5,3) but Bob is there? We cannot walk through Bob.\n\nBob is at (5,3). So we must avoid that.\n\nSo let's plan for Alice:\n\nOption: \n1. Alice moves left from (2,3) to (1,3). \n2. Then down to (1,2) -> this tile is not non-empty? We check: (1,2) is not in the non-empty list -> so it's walkable.\n3. Then down to (1,1) -> walkable.\n4. Then right to (2,1) -> walkable? (2,1) not in non-empty -> yes.\n5. Then right to (3,1) -> walkable? yes.\n\nAt (3,1), we are adjacent to the pot at (3,0) and we are facing? We need to face down to interact with the pot.\n\nBut note: after moving to (3,1), we are at (3,1) and we can change orientation to face down (D) and then interact.\n\nBut we are holding an onion. So we can add it to the pot.\n\nSimilarly, we can do the same for (4,1) but (3,0) is closer in terms of steps.\n\nAlternatively, after step (1,3) we could go right? But we started left.\n\nBut we have Bob at (5,3). We can also use Bob to help.\n\nThe task says we can optionally plan for Bob, but the primary is to plan for Alice. However, we can assume Bob will cooperate.\n\nLet me see Bob's state: Bob at (5,3) facing left, holding nothing. We can have Bob get an onion and put it in a pot.\n\nBut we are at turn 6. We need to plan for several turns. The cooking time is 5 turns, so we need to start cooking as soon as possible.\n\nPlan for both:\n\nIdeal: \n- Alice puts her onion into a pot (say at (3,0)) as soon as possible.\n- Bob gets an onion from the dispenser and puts it into the same pot.\n- Then we need one more onion: either Alice or Bob gets it.\n\nBut note: the pot starts cooking automatically at 3 ingredients.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Alice moves to (3,1) and puts the onion in the pot at (3,0). \n   Steps: \n   - Turn 6: Alice moves left to (1,3). \n   - Turn 7: Alice moves down to (1,2). \n   - Turn 8: Alice moves down to (1,1). \n   - Turn 9: Alice moves right to (2,1). \n   - Turn 10: Alice moves right to (3,1). \n   - Turn 11: Alice changes orientation to face down (if not already) and then interacts to put the onion.\n\nBut at turn 11, we put the first onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can be getting onions.\n\nBob is at (5,3). He can go to the onion dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4). But (3,4) and (4,4) are non-empty, so he must stand adjacent. The adjacent tiles to (3,4): \n- Down: (3,3) -> walkable? yes, at (3,3) we can face up to interact? But (3,4) is above (3,3). So if Bob is at (3,3), facing up, he can interact to get an onion.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,4): from (4,3) facing up.\n\nSo Bob can:\n- Turn 6: move left to (4,3) -> but Alice is moving to (1,3) at turn6, so (4,3) is free? Bob is at (5,3). He can move left to (4,3) at turn6.\n- Turn7: Bob moves left to (3,3) -> but note: at turn7, Alice is at (1,2) and Bob at (3,3) is free? Then Bob can move to (3,3).\n- Turn8: Bob changes orientation to face up (U) and then interact to get an onion? But he must be at (3,3) and facing up to interact with (3,4).\n\nBut wait: the onion dispenser is at (3,4). Bob at (3,3) is adjacent and can face up to interact.\n\nSo at turn8: Bob faces up and then interact? But we can only do one action per turn. So:\n\nTurn6: Bob moves left to (4,3)\nTurn7: Bob moves left to (3,3)\nTurn8: Bob changes orientation to U (if not already) and then we cannot interact until next turn? Or can we change orientation and then interact in the same turn? No, one action per turn.\n\nAction per turn: either move, change orientation, interact, or stay.\n\nSo at turn8, Bob must change orientation to face up (if he is not already). His current orientation is left (from history). So he is at (3,3) and facing left? Then he must change to up.\n\nTurn8: Bob changes orientation to U.\n\nTurn9: Bob interacts to get an onion from (3,4).\n\nThen Bob is holding an onion. He then needs to go to the pot at (3,0) to put it. But the pot is at (3,0). He is at (3,3). He must go to (3,1) to interact with the pot? How? \n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,1): \n- He cannot go down to (3,2) because (3,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter). \n- So he must go around: \n  - Left to (2,3) -> but (2,3) is free? Then down to (2,2) -> blocked. \n  - Alternatively: go left to (2,3) -> then left to (1,3) -> then down to (1,2) -> then down to (1,1) -> then right to (2,1) -> then right to (3,1). \n\nThis is long.\n\nAlternatively, go right to (4,3) -> then down? (4,3) to (4,2) blocked. Then same issue.\n\nBut note: we have two pots. We can use the pot at (4,0) as well.\n\nBob can go to (4,1) to access (4,0). How to get to (4,1) from (3,3)? \n- Move right to (4,3) at turn9? But at turn9, Bob is getting an onion at (3,3) (if he interacts at turn9). Then at turn10, he can move right to (4,3). \n- Then turn11: move down? (4,3) to (4,2) blocked. So he must go around: \n  - From (4,3) move right to (5,3) -> but then he is at (5,3) and then down? (5,3) to (5,2) blocked. \n  - Or from (4,3) move down? not possible.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,3) after getting the onion, Bob can go left to (2,3) -> then left to (1,3) -> down to (1,2) -> down to (1,1) -> then right to (2,1) -> (3,1) -> then put in the pot at (3,0). But that is 6 moves? \n\nBut we want to put the onion quickly.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob put the onion in the pot at (4,0) by going to (4,1). How? From (3,3) to (4,3) then ... but then to (4,1) we must go around the same way.\n\nSo it's symmetric.\n\nBut note: Alice is going to put her onion in (3,0) at turn11. Then the pot has one onion. We need two more.\n\nWe have two players. We can have Bob get an onion and put it in the same pot? Then we need a third onion.\n\nAfter Alice puts her onion, she can go get another onion.\n\nBut Alice is at (3,1) after putting the onion. She can then go to get another onion.\n\nFrom (3,1) to the onion dispenser at (3,4): \n- She must go up to (3,2)? blocked. So she must go around: \n  - Left to (2,1) -> up? to (2,2) blocked. \n  - Alternatively: up from (3,1) is blocked? Then she must go left to (2,1) -> then up to (2,2) blocked? So then to (1,1) -> up to (1,2) -> then up to (1,3) -> then right to (2,3) -> then right to (3,3). \n\nSo from (3,1) to (3,3): \n  - Turn11: Alice is at (3,1) after putting onion. She then moves left to (2,1)\n  - Turn12: left to (1,1)\n  - Turn13: up to (1,2)\n  - Turn14: up to (1,3)\n  - Turn15: right to (2,3)\n  - Turn16: right to (3,3)\n\nThen at (3,3) she can face up and interact to get an onion at turn17.\n\nThat is too slow.\n\nAlternatively, after putting the onion at turn11, Alice can move to (4,1) to get to the other side? But (4,1) is adjacent to (4,0) pot. But she doesn't have an item? Then she can go to the onion dispenser from (4,1) by going up? (4,1) to (4,2) blocked. So same problem.\n\nSo it's inefficient for Alice to get the second onion.\n\nWe should have Bob get two onions? Or we use both pots? But we have only two pots and we want to make one soup with 3 onions.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob get one onion and then put it in the same pot, and then Alice gets the third onion? \n\nBut Bob is getting one onion at turn9. Then he needs to put it. How? He is at (3,3). He can go to (3,1) via the long path? \n\nTurn9: Bob gets onion at (3,3). \nTurn10: Bob moves left to (2,3)\nTurn11: Bob moves left to (1,3)\nTurn12: Bob moves down to (1,2)\nTurn13: Bob moves down to (1,1)\nTurn14: Bob moves right to (2,1)\nTurn15: Bob moves right to (3,1)\nTurn16: Bob faces down and interacts to put onion.\n\nThen at turn16, the pot has two onions (Alice's onion at turn11 and Bob's at turn16). Then we need a third onion.\n\nThen Alice can be free to get the third onion? But at turn11, Alice is at (3,1) and holding nothing. She can go get an onion.\n\nBut to get an onion, she must go to (3,3) or (4,3). From (3,1) to (3,3) is blocked. So she must go around: \nTurn11: Alice moves left to (2,1)\nTurn12: left to (1,1)\nTurn13: up to (1,2)\nTurn14: up to (1,3)\nTurn15: right to (2,3)\nTurn16: right to (3,3)\nTurn17: face up and interact to get onion.\n\nThen she is holding an onion. Then she must go back to the pot at (3,0). So from (3,3) to (3,1): \nTurn18: move left to (2,3)\nTurn19: left to (1,3)\nTurn20: down to (1,2)\nTurn21: down to (1,1)\nTurn22: right to (2,1)\nTurn23: right to (3,1)\nTurn24: face down and interact to put the third onion.\n\nThen the pot starts cooking at turn24. Cooking takes 5 turns. So at turn29, it is cooked. Then we need to serve it.\n\nBut this is too long and inefficient.\n\nWe need a better plan.\n\nAlternative plan: use the pot at (4,0) for Bob.\n\nAt turn6:\n- Alice: move left to (1,3)\n- Bob: move left to (4,3)\n\nTurn7:\n- Alice: move down to (1,2)\n- Bob: move up? or to get onion? Bob is at (4,3). He can move up? (4,4) is onion dispenser -> non-empty, so he cannot move up. He can move left to (3,3) to get onion from (3,4) or right to (5,3) but that's where he came from? Or down? blocked.\n\nSo Bob should go to (4,3) and then face up to get onion from (4,4). But at (4,3), he can face up and interact.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn6:\n- Alice: L (to 1,3)\n- Bob: L (to 4,3)\n\nTurn7:\n- Alice: D (to 1,2)\n- Bob: U (change orientation to face up) -> but he was facing left? So he changes to up.\n\nTurn8:\n- Alice: D (to 1,1)\n- Bob: I (interact with (4,4) to get an onion) -> now Bob holds an onion.\n\nThen Bob can go to (4,1) to put the onion in the pot at (4,0). How?\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,1): blocked at (4,2). So he must go around:\n- Turn8: Bob is at (4,3) holding onion.\n- Turn9: Bob moves left to (3,3)\n- Turn10: Bob moves left to (2,3)\n- Turn11: Bob moves left to (1,3)\n- Turn12: Bob moves down to (1,2)\n- Turn13: Bob moves down to (1,1)\n- Turn14: Bob moves right to (2,1)\n- Turn15: Bob moves right to (3,1)\n- Turn16: Bob moves right to (4,1) -> (4,1) is walkable? Yes.\n- Turn17: Bob faces down and interacts to put onion in (4,0) pot.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice is at (1,1) at turn8. She can go to (3,1) to put her onion in the pot at (3,0) or (4,0)? She is holding an onion and can put in either pot.\n\nBut the pot at (3,0) is closer? \n\nFrom (1,1) to (3,1):\n- Turn9: Alice moves right to (2,1)\n- Turn10: Alice moves right to (3,1)\n- Turn11: Alice faces down and interacts to put onion in (3,0) pot.\n\nSo at turn11, pot at (3,0) has one onion (from Alice).\n\nThen Alice is free. She can go get another onion for the same pot.\n\nFrom (3,1) to get an onion:\n- She must go to an onion dispenser. The closest is (3,4) or (4,4). From (3,1) to (3,3): blocked. So she must go around:\n  - Turn11: after putting, she is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n  - Turn12: move left to (2,1)\n  - Turn13: left to (1,1)\n  - Turn14: up to (1,2)\n  - Turn15: up to (1,3)\n  - Turn16: right to (2,3)\n  - Turn17: right to (3,3)\n  - Turn18: face up and interact to get onion.\n\nThen she has an onion. Then she must go back to (3,1) to put it in the pot:\n  - Turn19: move left to (2,3)\n  - Turn20: left to (1,3)\n  - Turn21: down to (1,2)\n  - Turn22: down to (1,1)\n  - Turn23: right to (2,1)\n  - Turn24: right to (3,1)\n  - Turn25: face down and interact.\n\nThen the pot at (3,0) has two onions at turn11 and turn25. We need a third.\n\nThis is even worse.\n\nWe need to use both players to fill one pot quickly.\n\nNew idea: Alice goes to put her onion in the pot at (3,0) as before. Bob goes to get an onion and then meets Alice on the way? But not efficient.\n\nAnother idea: Alice drops her onion on a kitchen counter near the pot, then goes to get another onion, then they both put.\n\nBut there are kitchen counters near the pots? For example, at (2,0) and (5,0) but those are non-empty and we cannot use them? We can use a kitchen counter to store an item.\n\nKitchen counters are at: (0,0), (1,0), etc., but also at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) -> which are above the pots.\n\nFor example, (2,2) is a kitchen counter and it's empty (since all are empty). So Alice can place her onion on (2,2) and then go get another onion.\n\nBut (2,2) is adjacent to (2,3)? (2,3) is above (2,2) -> so if Alice is at (2,3) and facing down, she can interact with (2,2) to place an item? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter.\n\nBut currently, Alice is at (2,3) at turn6 holding an onion. She can:\n\nTurn6: face down (D) -> because currently she is facing left. So she must change orientation to down.\nTurn7: interact to place the onion on (2,2). Then she is empty-handed.\n\nThen she can go to get another onion.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,3) -> then to (3,4) is non-empty, so she can go to (3,3) and face up to get onion from (3,4).\n\nSteps for Alice after placing onion on (2,2):\n- Turn6: change orientation to D (down)\n- Turn7: interact to place onion on (2,2) kitchen counter.\n- Turn8: move right to (3,3)\n- Turn9: change orientation to U (up) if not already? She moved right, so now facing right? So she must change to up.\n- Turn10: interact to get onion from (3,4).\n\nThen she has an onion again. Then she can go to the pot to put it. But the pot is at (3,0). She is at (3,3). How to get to (3,1)? Blocked. So again the long path.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the onion, she can place it on another kitchen counter near the pot? For example, at (3,1) there is no kitchen counter. The kitchen counters are at (2,2), (3,2), etc., and (3,2) is adjacent to (3,3) above. So at (3,3), she can face down and interact to place an item on (3,2) if it's empty.\n\nTurn10: after getting onion, she is at (3,3) holding an onion.\nTurn11: face down (D)\nTurn12: interact to place onion on (3,2).\n\nThen she is free to get the third onion.\n\nThen, separately, Bob can be assigned to take the onions from the kitchen counters and put them in the pot.\n\nBob is at (5,3). He can go to (2,2) to pick up the onion Alice placed, then go to (3,1) to put it in the pot? But (3,1) is for pot (3,0).\n\nLet's coordinate:\n\nAfter Alice places the onion on (2,2) at turn7, then at turn8 she goes to (3,3) and by turn10 she has another onion and places it on (3,2) at turn12.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can start by going to (2,2) to pick up the onion.\n\nBob at (5,3) at turn6:\n- Turn6: move left to (4,3)\n- Turn7: move left to (3,3)\n- Turn8: move left to (2,3)\n- Turn9: change orientation to down (D) to face (2,2)\n- Turn10: interact to pick up the onion from (2,2)\n\nThen he is holding an onion. Then he can go to (3,1) to put it in the pot at (3,0).\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,1): how? He is at (2,3) after turn8. Then turn9 he is facing down. Turn10 he picks up. Turn11: move left to (1,3)? Or down? cannot. So he must go around:\n- Turn11: move left to (1,3)\n- Turn12: move down to (1,2)\n- Turn13: move down to (1,1)\n- Turn14: move right to (2,1)\n- Turn15: move right to (3,1)\n- Turn16: face down and interact to put onion in pot.\n\nThen the pot has one onion (from Bob).\n\nThen we have another onion on (3,2). Bob after putting is at (3,1) holding nothing. He can go to (3,2) to pick up the onion? But (3,2) is adjacent to (3,1) below? So at (3,1), he can face up to interact with (3,2)? (3,2) is above (3,1) -> so if he faces up, he can interact.\n\nTurn17: Bob change orientation to up (U)\nTurn18: interact to pick up onion from (3,2)\nThen he has the onion. Then he can immediately interact to put it in the pot? He is at (3,1) and the pot is at (3,0) below. So he must face down. So after picking up, he is holding the onion and at (3,1) facing up. Then he must change to down.\n\nTurn19: change orientation to down\nTurn20: interact to put onion in pot.\n\nThen the pot has two onions (from Bob's first onion and this onion). We need a third.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice after placing on (3,2) at turn12, she can go to get a third onion.\n\nTurn12: Alice at (3,3) after placing on (3,2)? At turn12 she placed on (3,2) and is at (3,3) facing down? Then she can move to (4,3) and get an onion from (4,4).\n\nTurn13: Alice move right to (4,3)\nTurn14: change orientation to up (U)\nTurn15: interact to get onion from (4,4)\nThen she has the third onion. Then she must put it in the pot. She is at (4,3). To put in the pot at (3,0) or (4,0)? The pot at (4,0) is closer. She can go to (4,1) to put it.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,1): blocked. So she must go around:\nTurn16: move left to (3,3)\nTurn17: move left to (2,3)\nTurn18: move left to (1,3)\nTurn19: move down to (1,2)\nTurn20: move down to (1,1)\nTurn21: move right to (2,1)\nTurn22: move right to (3,1)\nTurn23: move right to (4,1)\nTurn24: face down and interact to put in pot at (4,0) -> but the pot at (4,0) is not the same as (3,0) that we are filling.\n\nWe are filling the pot at (3,0) with two onions, and she is putting the third onion in (4,0) pot? That would start a new soup.\n\nSo we want all three in one pot.\n\nSo she should put it in the (3,0) pot. From (4,1) she can go to (3,1) and face down to put in (3,0) pot.\n\nBut at turn24, she is at (4,1). \nTurn25: move left to (3,1)\nTurn26: face down (if not already) and interact to put in (3,0) pot.\n\nThen at turn26, the pot at (3,0) gets the third onion and starts cooking.\n\nCooking takes 5 turns, so ready at turn31.\n\nThen we need to serve it.\n\nBut this is still long.\n\n Given the complexity, and since we are only required to plan for Alice for the next several turns (H turns, we can choose H reasonably), let's focus on the immediate actions to get the first onion in the pot.\n\nSimplest: Alice goes to put her onion in the pot at (3,0) as in the first plan, but we'll only plan for say 5 turns for Alice.\n\nAt turn6, Alice is at (2,3) holding onion, facing left.\n\nWe want to go to (3,1) to access the pot at (3,0).\n\nPath: (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1)\n\nSo:\nTurn6: move L to (1,3)\nTurn7: move D to (1,2)\nTurn8: move D to (1,1)\nTurn9: move R to (2,1)\nTurn10: move R to (3,1)\nTurn11: face D and interact to put onion.\n\nBut we are to plan for Alice only, and for the next several turns. Let's say we plan for 5 turns: turns 6 to 10.\n\nSo turns:\nTurn6: L\nTurn7: D\nTurn8: D\nTurn9: R\nTurn10: R\n\nThen at turn11, she can interact.\n\nBut during these turns, Bob can be doing something to help, but we are not planning for Bob.\n\nThis is a safe plan to get the first onion in.\n\nThen after that, we can have a subsequent plan for the next steps.\n\nSo for now, let's output 5 turns for Alice.\n\nAnswer for Alice from turn6 to turn10:\n\nTurn6: L\nTurn7: D\nTurn8: D\nTurn9: R\nTurn10: R\n\nThen at turn11, she will interact to put the onion.\n\nBut the action at turn10 is R to (3,1), and then at turn11 she must face down and interact. But we are only planning up to turn10.\n\nWe can include turn11 in the plan if we extend H.\n\nSince the task says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\", we can choose H=5.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: L\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: D\nTurn 9: R\nTurn 10: R\n}\n\nThis gets Alice to (3,1) by turn10, ready to interact on turn11.\n\nTo be more efficient in subsequent turns, we might have Alice then go get another onion, but for now, this is a start.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob must coordinate to prepare and deliver a 3-onion soup, which yields a reward of 20 after cooking for 5 turns. The current state shows Alice holding one onion at (2, 3), and Bob holding nothing at (5, 3). The pots are empty, and all kitchen counters are empty. The immediate goal is for Alice to deposit her onion into a pot (e.g., at (3, 0)) as quickly as possible, allowing Bob to gather additional onions and fill the pot to start cooking. Alice's path to the pot at (3, 0) requires navigating around non-walkable tiles (kitchen counters) by moving left, down, down, right, and right to reach (3, 1), where she can interact with the pot on a subsequent turn.\n\n### Action Plan for Alice (Turns 6-10)\n- **Turn 6: Move left (L)** to (1, 3). This avoids the kitchen counter at (2, 2) and positions Alice for downward movement.\n- **Turn 7: Move down (D)** to (1, 2). This continues the path toward the lower row.\n- **Turn 8: Move down (D)** to (1, 1). Alice is now in row y=1, which is walkable.\n- **Turn 9: Move right (R)** to (2, 1). Alice moves east toward the pot's access point.\n- **Turn 10: Move right (R)** to (3, 1). Alice is now adjacent to the pot at (3, 0) and can interact with it on turn 11 by facing down and using \"I\" to deposit the onion.\n\n### Coordination with Bob\n- **Bob's Role**: While Alice moves to the pot, Bob should gather onions. From (5, 3), Bob can move left to (4, 3), then left to (3, 3), face up, and interact with the onion dispenser at (3, 4) to grab an onion. He can then deposit it into the same pot or help gather a third onion.\n- **Next Steps**: After Alice deposits her onion (turn 11), she should either gather another onion or assist Bob. Once the pot has 3 onions, cooking starts automatically. After 5 turns, one player must grab a plate from (0, 2), serve the cooked soup, and deliver it to (7, 2).\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Efficiency**: This path is the shortest route for Alice to reach a pot, minimizing turns to deposit the first onion.\n- **Synergy**: Bob can start gathering onions immediately, allowing the pot to be filled faster.\n- **Reward Maximization**: Getting the first onion into the pot quickly initiates the cooking process sooner, enabling earlier delivery and reward collection.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: L \\\\\nTurn 7: D \\\\\nTurn 8: D \\\\\nTurn 9: R \\\\\nTurn 10: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current game state and plan actions for Alice to maximize rewards by delivering soup. The goal is to deliver recipes, specifically Recipe 1 which requires 3 onions and gives 20 reward after 5 turns of cooking.\n\nCurrent turn: t_1 = 9\n\nAlice's position: (1, 3), orientation: Left, holding nothing. Her action history: L, I, D, I, L. But since we're at turn 9, these are past actions, not part of the future plan.\n\nBob's position: (4, 3), orientation: Up, holding one onion. His action history: U, L, L, U, I.\n\nTile types:\n\n- Kitchen Counter: various positions, including (2,2) which has an onion.\n\n- Onion Dispenser: (3,4) and (4,4)\n\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pot: (3,0) and (4,0)\n\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\nNo tomato dispensers, so we can only make onion soup since Recipe 1 is 3 onions.\n\nRecipe 1: 3 onions, cook time 5 turns, reward 20.\n\nPots are empty, so we need to fill a pot with 3 onions to start cooking.\n\nAlice is at (1,3) holding nothing. Bob is at (4,3) holding one onion.\n\nThere's an onion on the kitchen counter at (2,2), which Alice or Bob could pick up if they go there.\n\nSince Bob is already holding an onion, he can directly go to a pot to add it. But he needs to add two more onions to a pot to start cooking.\n\nAlice is empty-handed, so she can grab an onion from a dispenser or from the counter.\n\nLet me sketch the grid to visualize positions.\n\nThe grid isn't fully specified, but from tile lists, I can infer walkable areas. Players can only be on empty tiles, and move to adjacent empty tiles.\n\nKey positions:\n\n- Alice: (1,3)\n\n- Bob: (4,3)\n\n- Kitchen counter with onion: (2,2)\n\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\nAlso, kitchen counters at other positions, but only (2,2) has an item, so others are empty and can be used for storage.\n\nNow, to deliver a soup, we need to:\n\n1. Get three onions into a pot.\n\n2. Wait for it to cook for 5 turns.\n\n3. Get a plate.\n\n4. Use the plate to serve the soup from the pot.\n\n5. Take the soup to the serving counter at (7,2) to deliver.\n\nSince there are two pots, we could potentially use both, but let's start with one soup for now to maximize efficiency.\n\nBob is holding one onion, so he can add it to a pot soon. But he's at (4,3), and pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). So (4,0) is directly below (4,3), but (4,3) to (4,0) might not be direct; there could be obstacles.\n\nThe grid isn't fully mapped, but from tile types, we know which tiles are counters, dispensers, etc. Players can only move on empty tiles, so I need to assume the layout.\n\nTypically in Overcooked, the grid is such that players can move around. Let me list all tile positions mentioned to infer.\n\nKitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\nOnion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4) — these are at y=4.\n\nPlate dispenser: (0,2)\n\nPot: (3,0), (4,0)\n\nServing counter: (7,2)\n\nNow, Alice at (1,3), Bob at (4,3).\n\n(1,3) is a kitchen counter? From list: (0,3) and (7,3) are kitchen counters, but (1,3) is not listed, so it must be empty tile. Similarly, (4,3) is not listed, so empty tile.\n\nKitchen counters are at specific points; other tiles are empty or other types.\n\nDispensers and pots are also tiles, but players can't stand on them; they interact from adjacent tiles.\n\nPlayers can only stand on empty tiles.\n\nSo for (1,3): not in kitchen counter list, not dispenser, not pot, so likely empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nNow, to move to interact with objects.\n\nFirst, let's get onions into a pot.\n\nBob is at (4,3) holding an onion. He can go south to (4,2)? (4,2) is a kitchen counter, so he can't stand on it. Players can only stand on empty tiles.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down to (4,2) only if (4,2) is empty, but (4,2) is listed as kitchen counter, so it's not empty; it's a counter tile, which is not walkable. Players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles.\n\nTile types: empty tiles are walkable, others are not.\n\nSo (4,2) is kitchen counter, so not walkable. Bob at (4,3) can move left, right, up, or down? Down to (4,2) is not possible since it's a counter.\n\nSimilarly, positions: let's see y-levels.\n\ny=0: kitchen counters at (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(5,0),(6,0),(7,0); pots at (3,0),(4,0) — pots are separate tiles, not walkable.\n\ny=1: kitchen counters at (0,1),(7,1); others? Not specified, so probably empty tiles except these.\n\nBut we need the full grid; I think I have to assume that tiles not listed in the non-empty types are empty.\n\nFrom the lists:\n\n- Kitchen counters: the positions given are occupied, so not walkable.\n\n- Dispensers: occupied, not walkable.\n\n- Pot: occupied, not walkable.\n\n- Serving counter: occupied, not walkable.\n\nSo only tiles not in any of these lists are empty and walkable.\n\nFor example, at y=3: kitchen counters at (0,3) and (7,3), so (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) should be empty, except (0,3) and (7,3) are counters.\n\n(0,3) and (7,3) are counters, so not walkable. (1,3) to (6,3) should be empty if not listed.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nAlice at (1,3) empty, Bob at (4,3) empty.\n\nNow, to reach a pot, for example (4,0).\n\nBob at (4,3). To get to (4,0), he needs to go down, but (4,2) is a kitchen counter, so he can't go directly down. He must go around.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) : is it empty? Not listed in counters, so probably empty.\n\nCounters at y=1: (0,1) and (7,1), so (1,1) to (6,1) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: kitchen counters at (2,2),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2), so all of these are occupied, not walkable.\n\ny=4: onion dispensers at (3,4),(4,4), and kitchen counters at (0,4),(1,4),(2,4),(5,4),(6,4),(7,4), so only (3,4) and (4,4) are dispensers, but dispensers are not walkable, so at y=4, tiles like (3,4) is dispenser, not walkable, similarly (4,4) not walkable. (0,4) to (2,4) counters, (5,4) to (7,4) counters, so no empty tiles at y=4 except possibly between, but all covered.\n\nLet's list all non-empty tiles:\n\n- Kitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)  // these are at y=4, x=3 and 4\n\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)  // at (0,2)\n\n- Pot: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\nSo empty tiles are all positions not in the above lists.\n\nFor example, at y=0: (3,0) and (4,0) are pots, not walkable, (0,0) to (2,0) counters, (5,0) to (7,0) counters, so no empty at y=0.\n\ny=1: counters at (0,1) and (7,1), so (1,1) to (6,1) should be empty, except if there are other things, but not listed, so empty.\n\ny=2: counters at (2,2),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2), and plate dispenser at (0,2), so at y=2, (0,2) plate dispenser, (1,2) not listed, so empty? (1,2) not in lists, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) not listed, empty? Lists: at y=2, we have (0,2) plate dispenser, (2,2) kitchen counter, (3,2) kitchen counter, (4,2) kitchen counter, (5,2) kitchen counter. So (1,2) and (6,2) not listed, so empty tiles.\n\nAlso (7,2) is serving counter, not empty.\n\nSo empty tiles at y=2: (1,2), (6,2)\n\ny=3: kitchen counters at (0,3) and (7,3), so (1,3) to (6,3) not listed, so empty. Alice at (1,3), Bob at (4,3), both empty.\n\ny=4: onion dispensers at (3,4),(4,4), kitchen counters at (0,4),(1,4),(2,4),(5,4),(6,4),(7,4), so all positions covered, no empty tiles at y=4.\n\ny=1: (1,1) to (6,1) empty.\n\ny=2: (1,2), (6,2) empty.\n\ny=3: (1,3) to (6,3) empty.\n\ny=0: no empty, all occupied.\n\ny=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) empty? (0,1) and (7,1) counters, so yes, (1,1) to (6,1) empty.\n\nNow for pots: to interact with pot at (3,0), a player must be on an adjacent empty tile and facing it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (3,0): up (3,1), down not exist or out of bound, left (2,0), right (4,0), but (2,0) and (4,0) are counters and pot, not empty, so only possible from (3,1) if facing down.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0), only from (4,1) facing down.\n\n(3,1) and (4,1) are empty tiles at y=1.\n\nSimilarly, for onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), but no empty tiles at y=4, so players must be at y=3 adjacent and facing up.\n\nFor example, to interact with (3,4), player at (3,3) facing up.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4), at (4,3) facing up.\n\nBob is at (4,3), orientation Up, so he can interact with (4,4) onion dispenser, but he is holding an onion already, so he can't grab another since he can only hold one item.\n\nAction: Interact with dispenser only if empty-handed.\n\nBob is holding an onion, so he can't grab from dispenser.\n\nHe can add to a pot or place on a counter.\n\nSimilarly, plate dispenser at (0,2), adjacent empty tiles: left? (0,2) is at (0,2), so adjacent: (0,1), (0,3), (1,2), but (0,1) is kitchen counter, not empty, (0,3) is kitchen counter, not empty, (1,2) is empty, so only from (1,2) facing left.\n\nServing counter at (7,2), adjacent: (7,1) kitchen counter not empty, (7,3) kitchen counter not empty, (6,2) empty, so from (6,2) facing right.\n\nKitchen counter at (2,2) has an onion, so to pick it up, player must be adjacent and facing it. (2,2) is at (2,2), adjacent tiles: (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2). But (2,1) is empty (y=1), (2,3) is at y=3, (2,3) not listed, so empty? y=3: (1,3) to (6,3) empty, so (2,3) empty. (1,2) empty, (3,2) is kitchen counter, not empty.\n\nSo for (2,2), possible interaction from (2,1) facing up, or (2,3) facing down, or (1,2) facing right, or (3,2) but (3,2) is counter, not empty, so not accessible. Only from (2,1), (2,3), or (1,2).\n\n(2,1) at y=1, (2,3) at y=3, (1,2) at y=2.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nAlice at (1,3), orientation Left, holding nothing.\n\nBob at (4,3), orientation Up, holding one onion.\n\nKitchen counter at (2,2) has an onion.\n\nTo make soup, we need 3 onions in a pot.\n\nBob can add his onion to a pot. He is at (4,3), orientation Up. Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). To reach (4,0), he needs to go to (4,1) and face down.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he can't move directly down.\n\nHe must go left or right to go around.\n\nFor example, to (4,1), he can go down from (4,3) to (4,2) not possible, so he needs to go to a different y.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move left to (3,3) or right to (5,3), or up, but y=4 no empty tiles, so he can only move left or right or down? Down to (4,2) not possible.\n\nAvailable moves from (4,3): adjacent tiles: (4,2) not empty, (4,4) not empty, (3,3) empty, (5,3) empty. So he can move left to (3,3) or right to (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, Alice at (1,3) can move left to (0,3) but (0,3) counter not walkable, or down to (1,2) empty, or up not possible, or right to (2,3) empty.\n\n(1,2) is empty, as we said.\n\nNow, to get onions to a pot.\n\nSince Bob is holding an onion, he should go to a pot to add it.\n\nBut he needs to get to (4,1) or (3,1) to interact with pot.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can go to (3,3) or (5,3).\n\nSay he goes to (3,3), then from there, he can go down to (3,2) but (3,2) is kitchen counter not walkable, so he can't. He needs to go to (3,1) or (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move down? (3,2) not empty, so he can only move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3) or up not possible, so no direct down.\n\nHe must go to a row where he can access y=1.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), move left to (2,3), then from (2,3) he can move down to (2,2) not possible, or to (2,1)? (2,1) is empty at y=1.\n\n(2,3) to (2,2) not possible, but (2,3) to (2,1) is not adjacent; he needs to move to (2,2) but can't, so he must go through other tiles.\n\nFrom (2,3), adjacent: (2,2) not empty, (2,4) not empty (kitchen counter at (2,4)? y=4, (2,4) is kitchen counter, not empty), (1,3), (3,3).\n\nSo from (2,3), he can move to (1,3) or (3,3) or down not possible, up to (2,4) not possible.\n\nSo to get to y=1, he needs to go to a tile like (1,2) or (3,1), etc.\n\nLet's find a path to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), empty tile.\n\nFrom (4,3), Bob can move left to (3,3), then from (3,3) he can move down? No, (3,2) not empty. So from (3,3) move to (3,2) not possible, so he can move to (2,3) or (4,3) or (3,4) not possible.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move down to (3,2) no, or left to (2,3), or right to (4,3), or up not.\n\nNo vertical move from y=3 to y=1 directly; he needs to go to a tile where he can access the row below.\n\nFor example, at y=2, there are empty tiles at (1,2) and (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,3), Bob can move right to (5,3), then from (5,3) he can move down to (5,2) but (5,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so no.\n\n(5,2) is kitchen counter, not empty.\n\nThe only empty tiles at y=2 are (1,2) and (6,2).\n\nSo to get to y=1, players can be at (1,1), (2,1), etc., and from there they can interact with pots if adjacent.\n\nFor pot at (3,0), it can be interacted from (3,1) facing down.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0) from (4,1) facing down.\n\n(3,1) and (4,1) are empty.\n\nSo Bob at (4,3) can go to (4,1) by first going to (5,3) or (3,3), but from there to y=2 or y=1.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move to (3,3), then from (3,3) to (3,2) not possible, but he can move to (2,3), then from (2,3) to (1,3), then from (1,3) to (1,2), since (1,2) is empty.\n\nFrom (1,2), he can move to (1,1), then from (1,1) to (2,1), then to (3,1), then to (4,1).\n\nThat's a long path.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (3,3), then to (3,2) not possible, so only via (1,2) or (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is at x=6,y=2, empty.\n\nFrom (4,3), if he moves right to (5,3), then to (6,3), then to (6,2), then from (6,2) to (6,1), then to (5,1), then to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly long.\n\nBut there might be a shorter way.\n\nPerhaps he can go directly to (3,1) or (4,1) from above if there's a path.\n\nSince (2,2) is a counter with an onion, and Alice is near, perhaps Alice can pick that onion.\n\nLet's think of the most efficient way.\n\nFirst, there's an onion on the counter at (2,2). Alice is at (1,3), which is close to (2,2).\n\nAlice at (1,3), orientation Left.\n\nShe can move down to (1,2), which is adjacent to (2,2).\n\nFrom (1,2), she can face right to interact with (2,2) to pick up the onion.\n\nThen she would be holding an onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can go to a pot to add his onion.\n\nBut Bob needs to get to a pot position.\n\nLet's plan for Alice first.\n\nAlice at (1,3), holding nothing.\n\nAction: she can move down to (1,2). That would be action D.\n\nThen at (1,2), she needs to face right to interact with (2,2). Currently orientation is Left, so she needs to change orientation to Right.\n\nThen interact.\n\nSo sequence for Alice: Move D to (1,2), then change orientation to R, then Interact to pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nBut actions are per turn, so she can do one action per turn.\n\nAlso, Bob can act simultaneously, but for planning, I need to specify actions for Alice, and optionally for Bob, but the task is to plan for Alice, but it says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I should plan for Alice, and assume Bob will cooperate or I can suggest for Bob.\n\nThe task is to plan a sequence for Alice, but to maximize reward, I need to coordinate, so I might need to assume Bob's actions or plan for both.\n\nThe answer format is for Alice's actions, but it says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I can include Bob's actions if needed.\n\nLet's see the task: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"\n\nSo I can plan actions for both to coordinate.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, I need to specify for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 = 9.\n\nSo at turn 9, I start planning actions from turn 9 onwards for H turns. H is not specified, but I can choose a reasonable H, say until we deliver a soup or something.\n\nBut cooking takes 5 turns, so H should be at least 10 or so to see the delivery.\n\nBut let's start with immediate actions.\n\nFirst, Alice should pick up the onion from the counter at (2,2).\n\nAlice at (1,3), orientation L.\n\nTo reach (1,2) and face right.\n\nFrom (1,3), she can move down to (1,2) with action D.\n\nThen at (1,2), she is facing? When she moves, her orientation changes to the direction she moves. Action Move changes position and orientation.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\"\n\nSo if she moves D, she goes to (1,2) and orientation becomes Down.\n\nBut to interact with (2,2), she needs to be at (1,2) facing right, because (2,2) is to her right.\n\nSo after moving down to (1,2), orientation is Down, not Right.\n\nThen she needs to change orientation to Right, which is an action.\n\nThen Interact.\n\nSo three actions: Move D, Change orientation to R, then Interact.\n\nBut Change orientation is an action like R or L, but for orientation, not move.\n\nThe actions are: Move L/R/U/D (which moves and changes orientation), or Change Orientation L/R/U/D (which only changes orientation if not moving, but since adjacent tile not empty, it doesn't move), or Interact, or Stay.\n\nFor Change Orientation, it only changes orientation if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, but since she's not moving, it's just to face a different direction for interaction.\n\nIn this case, at (1,2), she can change orientation to R to face right, then interact with (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, if she can move directly, but moving R from (1,2) would go to (2,2), but (2,2) is not empty, it's a counter, so she can't move there; she can only interact from adjacent.\n\nSo sequence for Alice to pick up onion: turn 9: Move D to (1,2), orientation Down\n\nTurn 10: Change orientation to R (now facing right)\n\nTurn 11: Interact to pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nNow she is holding an onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is at (4,3) holding an onion, orientation Up.\n\nBob should go to a pot to add the onion.\n\nBut he needs to reach (3,1) or (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move left to (3,3) with action L (move left, orientation left).\n\nThen from (3,3), he can move to where? To get to y=1.\n\nHe can move to (2,3) or (4,3), or down not possible.\n\n(3,3) to (3,2) not possible.\n\nSo he needs to go to (2,3) or (4,3), but that doesn't help.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move left to (2,3), then from (2,3) to (1,3), then to (1,2), then to (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nAt (3,1), he can face down to interact with pot at (3,0).\n\nBut that's many moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (4,3) move right to (5,3), then to (6,3), then to (6,2), then to (6,1), then to (5,1), then to (4,1).\n\nAlso long.\n\nBut there is an empty tile at (6,2), and (6,1) is empty.\n\nSince Alice is going to (1,2), which is closer to the pot on the left, pot at (3,0), but (3,0) is at bottom left.\n\nPerhaps both can use the same pot or different.\n\nTo save time, Bob can add his onion to the kitchen counter or something, but that might not be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: Bob is at (4,3), and there is an onion dispenser at (4,4), but he is holding an onion, so he can't grab. He could place the onion on a kitchen counter for later use.\n\nBut there are kitchen counters, e.g., at (3,2), but (3,2) is a counter, but to place item, he needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), he can face up to interact with (4,4), but (4,4) is dispenser, not a counter; he can only interact with dispensers to grab, not to place.\n\nTo place an item, he needs a kitchen counter that is empty.\n\nFor example, kitchen counter at (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied? No, (3,2) is a kitchen counter tile, but it may have an item or not.\n\nThe non-empty kitchen counter is only (2,2) has an onion, others are empty, so he can place on other counters.\n\nFor example, at (3,2), it is empty, so he can place an item there.\n\nBut to interact with (3,2), he needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nFrom (4,3), (3,2) is diagonally, not adjacent; adjacent are (4,2) not empty, (4,4) not, (3,3), (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can face down to interact with (3,2), but (3,2) is below (3,3), so if he is at (3,3) facing down, he can interact with (3,2) if it is interactable.\n\n(3,2) is a kitchen counter, which can be interacted with to pick up or place items.\n\nSo yes, from (3,3) facing down, he can interact with (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, from (2,3) facing down with (2,2), etc.\n\nSo Bob can go to (3,3) and face down to place his onion on (3,2) if it's empty.\n\nThen he can go grab another onion or something.\n\nBut we need to get onions to pot.\n\nSince the pot needs 3 onions, and Bob has one, Alice can get one from counter, and we need one more.\n\nThere are onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nAlice will have an onion soon, she can go to a pot.\n\nLet's coordinate.\n\nFirst, for turn 9:\n\nAlice: Move D to (1,2)  // position (1,2), orientation Down\n\nBob: he should move towards a pot or place the onion.\n\nTo save time, Bob can go to (3,3) and place the onion on a counter near the pot for efficiency.\n\nBut let's assume we use pot at (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nSay pot at (3,0).\n\nThen (3,1) is the interaction point.\n\nBob at (4,3) can move left to (3,3) with action L (move left, orientation left).\n\nThen at (3,3), he can change orientation to Down, then interact to place onion on (3,2) if it's empty.\n\n(3,2) is a kitchen counter, and it's empty since only (2,2) has onion, so yes.\n\nThen he is free to grab another item.\n\nBut we need to add to pot directly.\n\nSince Alice is going to have an onion, she can go to the pot area.\n\nAlice after picking up onion at (2,2), she will be at (1,2) holding onion.\n\nThen she can go to (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nAt (3,1), she can face down to add onion to pot at (3,0).\n\nSimilarly, Bob can do the same with his onion.\n\nBut Bob is at (4,3), far.\n\nAnother idea: Bob can add his onion to pot at (4,0) from (4,1).\n\nBut to reach (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3), to (4,2) not possible, so to (3,3) or (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,3), to (6,3), to (6,2), to (6,1), to (5,1), to (4,1).\n\nLong.\n\nFrom (3,3), to (3,2) not, to (2,3), to (1,3), to (1,2), to (1,1), to (2,1), to (3,1), to (4,1) – even longer.\n\nSince (4,1) is at (4,1), and (3,1) is at (3,1), both empty.\n\nThe shortest path for Bob to (4,1) is via (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) that's 5 moves, or via (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) 7 moves, worse.\n\nSo via (6,2) is better.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (5,3) move R, then to (6,3) move R, then to (6,2) move D, then to (6,1) move D, then to (5,1) move L, then to (4,1) move L.\n\n5 actions to reach (4,1).\n\nThen at (4,1), change orientation to D to face down, then interact to add onion to pot at (4,0).\n\nSo 6 actions for Bob to add onion.\n\nBut Alice can add her onion faster.\n\nFirst, let's complete Alice's actions.\n\nAt turn 9: Alice move D to (1,2), orientation Down\n\nTurn 10: Alice change orientation to R (facing right)\n\nTurn 11: Alice interact I to pick up onion from (2,2), now holding onion.\n\nThen she needs to go to (3,1) to add to pot.\n\nFrom (1,2), she can move down to (1,1) with D, orientation Down.\n\nThen from (1,1), move right to (2,1) with R, orientation Right.\n\nThen from (2,1), move right to (3,1) with R, orientation Right.\n\nAt (3,1), she is facing right, but to interact with pot at (3,0), she needs to face down.\n\nSo change orientation to D, then interact.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 12: Alice move D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 13: Alice move R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 14: Alice move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 15: Alice change orientation to D (facing down)\n\nTurn 16: Alice interact I to add onion to pot at (3,0)\n\nNow the pot has one onion.\n\nBut we need three.\n\nBob has one onion, but he is far.\n\nThere is another onion on dispenser, but we need to grab.\n\nAlso, the onion on counter is taken.\n\nBob can add his onion to the same pot.\n\nBob at turn 9: move R to (5,3)  // from (4,3)\n\nTurn 10: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 11: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 12: move D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 13: move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 14: move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 15: change orientation to D (facing down)\n\nTurn 16: interact I to add onion to pot at (4,0)? But he is at (4,1), facing down, adding to (4,0), which is a different pot.\n\nIf we want to add to (3,0), he needs to be at (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,1), to (3,1) is adjacent, move L to (3,1), then face down to add to (3,0).\n\nBut at turn 14 he is at (4,1), so turn 15: move L to (3,1), orientation Left\n\nTurn 16: change orientation to D (facing down)\n\nTurn 17: interact I to add to pot at (3,0)\n\nBut Alice adds at turn 16, so at turn 16, pot has one onion from Alice.\n\nThen Bob adds at turn 17, pot has two onions.\n\nWe need one more onion.\n\nThere is no other onion; we need to grab from dispenser or counter.\n\nKitchen counters are empty except (2,2) which is taken.\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nAlice or Bob can grab an onion.\n\nAfter Alice adds onion at turn 16, she is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can go to grab an onion.\n\nBob is adding at turn 17, then he is free.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nFirst, at turn 16, pot has one onion (from Alice).\n\nTurn 17, Bob adds, pot has two onions.\n\nThen we need a third onion.\n\nAlice at (3,1) after adding, she can go to the onion dispenser.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move up to (3,2) not possible, so move to (3,0) not, move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1) or up not.\n\n(3,1) adjacent: (3,0) not empty, (3,2) not empty, (2,1), (4,1).\n\nSo move to (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nTo get to onion dispenser, e.g. (3,4), she needs to be at (3,3) facing up.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,3): not direct, need to go to (2,1) or (4,1), then to (2,2) not, so to (2,3) or something.\n\nFrom (3,1) move to (2,1), then to (2,2) not, so to (1,1) or (2,0) not, so to (1,1) then to (1,2), then to (1,3), then to (2,3), then to (3,3).\n\nLong.\n\nFrom (3,1) move to (4,1), then to (5,1), etc, worse.\n\nShortest to (3,3): from (3,1) move to (2,1) with L, then from (2,1) move to (2,2) not possible, so move to (1,1) if not, (2,1) to (1,1) move L, then from (1,1) to (1,2) move U? y increases up, so move U to (1,2) orientation Up.\n\nThen from (1,2) to (1,3) move U, orientation Up.\n\nThen from (1,3) to (2,3) move R, orientation Right.\n\nThen to (3,3) move R, orientation Right.\n\nThen at (3,3), change orientation to U to face up, then interact to grab onion from (3,4).\n\nMany actions.\n\nBob might be closer to the dispenser.\n\nBob after adding onion at turn 17, he is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nThen he can go to (3,3) to grab onion.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,3): similar issue.\n\nMove to (2,1) or (4,1), then to (2,2) not, so to (2,3) via (1,1) etc.\n\nFrom (3,1) move to (2,1) with L, then to (1,1) with L, then to (1,2) with U, then to (1,3) with U, then to (2,3) with R, then to (3,3) with R.\n\nThen at (3,3), change to U, interact.\n\n6 actions.\n\nThen he grabs onion at turn 23 or something, then needs to go back to pot to add.\n\nBut the pot has two onions, we need to add the third to start cooking.\n\nCooking starts when third ingredient added.\n\nSo after adding third onion, cooking starts for 5 turns.\n\nThen after cooking, need plate to serve, then deliver.\n\nBut this seems inefficient.\n\nAnother idea: since Bob is at (4,3) initially, and there is an onion on counter at (2,2), but Alice is getting it.\n\nBob can go directly to the onion dispenser to grab another onion, but he is holding one, so he can't.\n\nHe must place it or add it.\n\nPerhaps Bob should place his onion on a counter near the dispenser or pot.\n\nFor example, at turn 9, Bob move L to (3,3), orientation Left.\n\nTurn 10: change orientation to D (facing down)\n\nTurn 11: interact to place onion on (3,2) if empty.\n\nThen he is empty-handed.\n\nTurn 12: change orientation to U to face up, then interact to grab onion from (3,4) dispenser.\n\nAt (3,3), facing up, he can interact with (3,4) to grab onion.\n\nSo turn 12: change orientation to U\n\nTurn 13: interact to grab onion from (3,4)\n\nNow he has an onion.\n\nThen he can go to the pot.\n\nBut he is at (3,3), holding onion.\n\nTo add to pot at (3,0), he needs to be at (3,1) facing down.\n\nFrom (3,3), to (3,1): move to (2,3) or (4,3), then to (2,2) not, so to (2,3) then to (1,3), to (1,2), to (1,1), to (2,1), to (3,1).\n\n7 moves.\n\nOr from (3,3) to (3,2) not, so no short way.\n\nStill long.\n\nAlice can grab the onion from dispenser faster.\n\nAlice at (1,3) at turn 9.\n\nInstead of going to (2,2), she can go to the onion dispenser.\n\nFor example, to (3,4) dispenser.\n\nFrom (1,3), she can move right to (2,3), then to (3,3), then face up to grab from (3,4).\n\nSequence: turn 9: move R to (2,3), orientation Right\n\nTurn 10: move R to (3,3), orientation Right\n\nTurn 11: change orientation to U (up)\n\nTurn 12: interact to grab onion from (3,4)\n\nNow she has an onion at turn 12.\n\nThen she can go to pot.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,1) as before, long way.\n\nOr to (3,0) pot, but need to be at (3,1).\n\nSo to (2,3) or (4,3), then down.\n\nSame issue.\n\nPerhaps the players can work on different pots.\n\nFor example, Alice and Bob each add to a different pot, but we need 3 onions per pot.\n\nBut with only two players, it might be slower for one pot.\n\nSince there are two pots, we can use both, but we need to deliver multiple soups.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on one soup to deliver.\n\nBack to the onion on counter at (2,2).

After interact, orientation might be left, but move D changes to down.\n\nTurn 27: move R to (2,1)  // orientation Right\n\nTurn 28: move R to (3,1)  // orientation Right\n\nTurn 29: change orientation to D\n\nTurn 30: interact to serve soup from pot (but soup is ready at turn 26, so at turn 30 it's ok)\n\nThen she has soup on plate.\n\nThen deliver to (7,2).\n\nTurn 31: move R to (4,1)  // orientation Right\n\nTurn 32: move R to (5,1)  // orientation Right\n\nTurn 33: move R to (6,1)  // orientation Right\n\nTurn 34: move U to (6,2)  // orientation Up\n\nTurn 35: change orientation to R (right)\n\nTurn 36: interact to deliver at (7,2)\n\nBut this is for Alice only, and I have actions up to turn 36.\n\nFor Bob, I need to coordinate, but since the task is for Alice, I can output Alice's actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, I should start from turn 9.\n\nAlso, for the first few turns, Bob's actions affect, but for Alice's plan, I can assume Bob cooperates as above.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps I can plan for Alice to focus on one thing.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can let Bob add his onion to the pot directly if possible, but he is far.\n\nSince the grid has a kitchen counter with onion, Alice can use that and grab from dispenser.\n\nBut let's stick with the first approach.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output Alice's actions from turn 9.\n\nSo based on above:\n\nTurn 9: D  // move down to (1,2)\n\nTurn 10: R  // change orientation to right to face (2,2)\n\nIn actions, R can be move or change orientation. In the list, actions are U,D,L,R for move or change orientation, I for interact, S for stay.\n\nWhen a player performs a move action, it changes position and orientation.\n\nIf they perform a change orientation action, it only changes orientation if not moving.\n\nFor turn 10, Alice is at (1,2), she needs to face right, so she does a change orientation to right, which is action R.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nSo sequence for Alice:\n\nTurn 9: D  // move down to (1,2), orientation down\n\nTurn 10: R  // change orientation to right (now facing right)\n\nTurn 11: I  // interact to pick up onion from (2,2), now holding onion\n\nTurn 12: D  // move down to (1,1), orientation down\n\nTurn 13: R  // move right to (2,1), orientation right\n\nTurn 14: R  // move right to (3,1), orientation right\n\nTurn 15: D  // change orientation to down? Action D, but if she does move D, from (3,1) down to (3,0) not possible, so she must do change orientation to down, which is action D.\n\nIn the action list, \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" So for change orientation, she uses the direction to face.\n\nSo turn 15: D  // change orientation to down\n\nTurn 16: I  // interact to add onion to pot at (3,0), now holding nothing\n\nThen turn 17: U  // change orientation to up (to face (3,2))\n\nTurn 18: I  // interact to pick up onion from (3,2), now holding onion (assuming Bob placed it)\n\nTurn 19: D  // change orientation to down\n\nTurn 20: I  // interact to add onion to pot at (3,0), now holding nothing, pot has 2 onions\n\nThen she goes for plate.\n\nTurn 21: L  // move left to (2,1), orientation left\n\nTurn 22: L  // move left to (1,1), orientation left\n\nTurn 23: U  // move up to (1,2), orientation up\n\nTurn 24: L  // change orientation to left (to face (0,2))\n\nTurn 25: I  // interact to grab plate from (0,2), now holding plate\n\nThen turn 26: D  // move down to (1,1), orientation down\n\nTurn 27: R  // move right to (2,1), orientation right\n\nTurn 28: R  // move right to (3,1), orientation right\n\nTurn 29: D  // change orientation to down\n\nTurn 30: I  // interact to serve soup from pot, now holding soup on plate\n\nThen deliver:\n\nTurn 31: R  // move right to (4,1), orientation right\n\nTurn 32: R  // move right to (5,1), orientation right\n\nTurn 33: R  // move right to (6,1), orientation right\n\nTurn 34: U  // move up to (6,2), orientation up\n\nTurn 35: R  // change orientation to right (to face (7,2))\n\nTurn 36: I  // interact to deliver soup at (7,2)\n\nThis is for Alice, and I assumed Bob placed an onion on (3,2) and added the third onion.\n\nBut for the plan, I need to specify only Alice's actions.\n\nAlso, for the soup to be cooked, it started at turn 21 when third onion added, ready at turn 26, so serving at turn 30 is fine.\n\nBut in this sequence, at turn 20, pot has 2 onions, third added by Bob at turn 21.\n\nSo Alice is free from turn 21 to get plate.\n\nThe sequence is long, but for the answer, I can output for a few turns or until the soup is served.\n\nSince H is not specified, I can output for 10 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see the action history.\n\nAlice action history: L, I, D, I, L for past turns, but we start from turn 9.\n\nFor turn 9 onwards.\n\nPerhaps for immediate coordination.\n\nAnother idea: since Bob is at (4,3) holding onion, and Alice is at (1,3), she can go to the plate dispenser to get a plate early, but we need soup first.\n\nNot useful.\n\nOr, Alice can go to the onion dispenser to grab an onion while Bob adds his.\n\nBut Bob is slow to add.\n\nLet's assume the grid allows faster movement, but from the tile list, the path is limited.\n\nPerhaps from (4,3) Bob can move down if possible, but (4,2) is not empty.\n\nI think I have to accept the path.\n\nFor the answer, I'll output Alice's actions as above for the first few turns.\n\nSince the task is to plan for Alice, and optionally Bob, but the answer format is for actions, I can include both.\n\nBut the boxed answer might be for Alice only.\n\nLet's read the answer format: it shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc, and it says \"for Alice\", so probably only Alice's actions.\n\nSo I'll output Alice's actions.\n\nBased on the first part.\n\nTurn 9: D  // move down to (1,2)\n\nTurn 10: R  // change orientation to right\n\nTurn 11: I  // pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nThen she has onion, and can go to pot.\n\nTurn 12: D  // move down to (1,1)\n\nTurn 13: R  // move right to (2,1)\n\nTurn 14: R  // move right to (3,1)\n\nTurn 15: D  // change orientation to down\n\nTurn 16: I  // add onion to pot\n\nThen she can wait or get another onion.\n\nBut for H=10, I can stop at turn 18 or something.\n\nPerhaps for the next 5 turns.\n\nBut let's say for H=10 turns, from turn 9 to turn 18.\n\nSo turn 9 to 18:\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: R\n\nTurn 11: I\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: I\n\nThen at turn 17, she can change orientation to up to prepare for (3,2), but if Bob places onion there.\n\nTurn 17: U  // change orientation to up\n\nTurn 18: I  // interact with (3,2) to pick up, if there is onion.\n\nBut in the plan, I need to specify.\n\nSince we don't control Bob, for Alice's plan, she can assume the onion is there or not.\n\nTo be safe, after adding at turn 16, she can go to grab from dispenser.\n\nBut it's far.\n\nI think for the sake of the task, I'll output the sequence as above for Alice.\n\nSo for turn 9 to say turn 16.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should coordinate to prepare and deliver Recipe 1 (3 onions, reward 20) as efficiently as possible. Based on the current game state at turn \\( t_1 = 9 \\):\n\n- Alice is at (1, 3), holding nothing, facing left.\n- Bob is at (4, 3), holding one onion, facing up.\n- There is an onion on the kitchen counter at (2, 2), which Alice can pick up quickly.\n- Both pots are empty, so the priority is to add three onions to a pot (e.g., the pot at (3, 0)) to start cooking (5-turn cook time).\n- After cooking, a plate is needed to serve the soup, and it must be delivered to the serving counter at (7, 2).\n\nAlice's actions are optimized to:\n1. Pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (2, 2) by moving to (1, 2), facing right, and interacting.\n2. Move to the pot interaction tile at (3, 1) and add the onion.\n3. Cooperate with Bob, who will place his onion on the kitchen counter at (3, 2) for Alice to use, allowing her to add a second onion to the same pot quickly.\n4. After Bob adds the third onion (starting the cook at turn 21), Alice fetches a plate from the plate dispenser at (0, 2).\n5. Once the soup is cooked (ready at turn 26), Alice serves it and delivers it to the serving counter.\n\nBob's actions (for coordination):\n- Turn 9: Move left to (3, 3).\n- Turn 10: Change orientation down to face (3, 2).\n- Turn 11: Interact to place onion on (3, 2).\n- Turn 12: Change orientation up to face (3, 4).\n- Turn 13: Interact to grab onion from dispenser.\n- Then, move to (3, 1) and add the onion to the pot at (3, 0) at turn 21 (third onion added, cooking starts).\n\nAlice's action sequence for turns 9 to 36 is planned to complete one soup delivery by turn 36, yielding a reward of 20. The sequence accounts for movement and interaction constraints, with orientation changes where necessary. Actions are optimized for minimal turns, with Bob assisting to place an onion for Alice and add the third onion.\n\n**Alice's Action Sequence (for turns 9 to 36):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: R \\\\\nTurn 11: I \\\\\nTurn 12: D \\\\\nTurn 13: R \\\\\nTurn 14: R \\\\\nTurn 15: D \\\\\nTurn 16: I \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: I \\\\\nTurn 19: D \\\\\nTurn 20: I \\\\\nTurn 21: L \\\\\nTurn 22: L \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: L \\\\\nTurn 25: I \\\\\nTurn 26: D \\\\\nTurn 27: R \\\\\nTurn 28: R \\\\\nTurn 29: D \\\\\nTurn 30: I \\\\\nTurn 31: R \\\\\nTurn 32: R \\\\\nTurn 33: R \\\\\nTurn 34: U \\\\\nTurn 35: R \\\\\nTurn 36: I\n}\n\n**Explanation of Key Actions:**\n- **Turns 9-11:** Alice moves down to (1, 2), faces right, and picks up the onion from (2, 2).\n- **Turns 12-16:** Alice moves to (3, 1), faces down, and adds the onion to the pot at (3, 0).\n- **Turns 17-18:** Alice faces up and picks up the onion Bob placed on (3, 2) at turn 11.\n- **Turns 19-20:** Alice faces down and adds the second onion to the pot.\n- **Turns 21-25:** Alice moves to (0, 2), faces left, and grabs a plate (Bob adds the third onion at turn 21, starting the cook).\n- **Turns 26-30:** Alice moves back to (3, 1), faces down, and serves the soup (cooked at turn 26) onto her plate.\n- **Turns 31-36:** Alice moves to (6, 2), faces right, and delivers the soup to (7, 2) for reward.\n\nThis sequence assumes Bob follows the coordination plan above. Total reward of 20 is achieved at turn 36. For longer horizons, additional soups can be prepared, but this focuses on delivering one efficiently.",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 13. We need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice for the next H turns (let's say H=10, so up to turn 23) to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current state:\n\n**Alice:**\n- Position: (2,1)\n- Orientation: D (down)\n- Holding: nothing\n- Action History: L, D, D, R, D (most recent is D)\n\n**Bob:**\n- Position: (6,3)\n- Orientation: U (up)\n- Holding: nothing\n- Action History: I, R, R, U, I (most recent is I)\n\n**Non-empty Kitchen Counters:**\n- (2,2): contains an onion\n- (6,4): contains an onion\n\n**Pots:**\n- Both pots at (3,0) and (4,0) are empty.\n\n**Recipe Information:**\n- Only Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n\n**Tile Types:**\n- Onion Dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\n**Goal:** We want to make and deliver as many onion soups as possible. Since the recipe requires 3 onions, we need to get 3 onions into a pot, wait 5 turns for cooking, then serve it with a plate.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\n- Alice is at (2,1) facing down. She is not holding anything.\n- Bob is at (6,3) facing up, not holding anything.\n- There are two onions already on counters: one at (2,2) and one at (6,4).\n\n**Plan:**\n\nWe can use the existing onions to save time. We have two onions already on counters. We need one more onion and then put them in a pot. Also, we need to get a plate to serve.\n\nSince there are two pots, we can start two soups, but we only have two onions so far. We need to collect one more onion.\n\n**Possible Strategy:**\n\n1. Alice can pick up the onion from the counter at (2,2) and then put it into a pot. But note: she is at (2,1) and the counter is at (2,2). She is facing down. Currently, (2,1) is above (2,2) so if she moves down to (2,2), she would be on the counter? But note: counters are non-empty tiles? Actually, the kitchen counter is a tile that you can walk on? According to the rules:\n\n  - \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is listed as a non-empty tile? Actually, the rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and the kitchen counter is a tile type. But note: the kitchen counter can be empty or occupied. In this case, (2,2) is occupied (has an onion). So, is (2,2) walkable? The rules don't explicitly say, but typically in Overcooked, counters are walkable and you can place items on them. However, the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and a kitchen counter with an item is non-empty? Or is the counter always walkable and the non-empty refers to having an item? The rule says: \"non-empty tile\" meaning a tile that is not of type \"Empty Tile\"? But the tile types include Kitchen Counter, which is a distinct type. And the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\" meaning non-empty as in having an item? Or non-empty as in not an empty tile? Let me re-read:\n\n  - The grid has tile types: Empty Tile, Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter.\n\n  - The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and then in the Interact description: \"if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile\".\n\n  This implies that non-empty tiles (like dispensers, pots, counters) are not walkable? But that doesn't make sense because in Overcooked, players can walk on counters. Alternatively, perhaps \"non-empty\" in the walk rule refers to having an item? But that would be confusing because the tile itself is a type.\n\n  Clarification from the rules: \n  - \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\n  I think \"non-empty tiles\" here means tiles that are not of type \"Empty Tile\". So, players can only walk on Empty Tiles? But that would make the grid very restricted. Alternatively, perhaps the walk rule applies only to obstacles? The rules don't list any obstacles. \n\n  Let me look at the provided tile types:\n\n  - Kitchen Counter: listed as a tile type and also as having items. So, a Kitchen Counter tile is a specific tile that you can interact with. And the rule for interaction says: you must stand on an adjacent empty tile and face the tile.\n\n  Therefore, players cannot stand on a Kitchen Counter? They must stand on an adjacent empty tile to interact. Similarly for other non-empty tiles (dispensers, pots, serving counters).\n\n  So, the grid must have empty tiles for players to move on. The non-empty tiles (like counters, dispensers, etc.) are obstacles that you cannot walk on? But then how do you get to the plate dispenser at (0,2)? It must be adjacent to an empty tile.\n\n  Looking at the list of kitchen counters: they are at specific coordinates. The rest of the grid must be empty? Or are there walls? The rules don't mention walls.\n\n  Given the interaction rule, it's clear that players must be adjacent to a non-empty tile to interact. So, we can assume that non-empty tiles (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are not walkable. Players can only walk on empty tiles.\n\n  Therefore, Alice at (2,1) is on an empty tile. The kitchen counter at (2,2) is adjacent to her (south). She is facing down (towards (2,2)). So, she can interact with (2,2) without moving? But the rule says: \"standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and facing the tile\". She is already adjacent and facing it. So, she can interact to pick up the onion.\n\n  Similarly, Bob at (6,3) is facing up. The kitchen counter at (6,4) is south of him? (6,4) is below (6,3). He is facing up (north) so not facing (6,4). He would need to turn or move to interact with (6,4).\n\n**Revised Plan:**\n\n1. Alice can immediately pick up the onion from (2,2) by interacting (I). She is at (2,1), adjacent and facing down (towards (2,2)). So, she can do that on turn 13.\n\n2. Then, she can move to a pot to put the onion. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). How to get there? From (2,1), she can move right to (3,1) and then down to (3,0) or (4,0). But note: (3,1) is empty? We don't have a full map, but we can assume that tiles not listed as non-empty are empty. So, (3,1) should be empty. Then from (3,1) she can face down to interact with the pot at (3,0). Or she can move to (4,1) and then down to (4,0)? Let's plan the moves.\n\n   - Turn 13: Alice does I (interact with (2,2)) to pick up the onion. Now she is holding an onion.\n   - Then, she needs to go to a pot. The pot at (3,0) is closer. So:\n        Turn 14: Move right to (3,1) -> now at (3,1), facing? After moving right, her orientation becomes right? The rules say: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So, when she moves right, she will be at (3,1) and facing right. But to interact with the pot at (3,0) (which is south of her), she needs to face down. So:\n        Turn 15: Change orientation to D (or move down? But moving down from (3,1) to (3,0) is not possible because (3,0) is a pot (non-empty tile). So she must interact from (3,1) facing down.\n\n        So: Turn 15: Change orientation to D (if she isn't already facing down? But after moving right, she is facing right). So she needs to turn to face down.\n\n        Turn 16: Interact (I) to put the onion into the pot at (3,0). Now the pot has 1 onion. Alice is now holding nothing.\n\n3. Meanwhile, Bob can pick up the onion at (6,4). He is at (6,3) facing up. He needs to face down to interact with (6,4). So:\n        Turn 13: Bob can change orientation to D (down) to face (6,4). Or he can move down? But (6,4) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) so he cannot walk there. He must interact from (6,3) facing down. Currently, he is facing up, so he must turn.\n        Turn 13: Bob changes orientation to D (down). Then, Turn 14: Bob interacts (I) to pick up the onion from (6,4). Now he is holding an onion.\n\n4. Then Bob can take that onion to a pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). Bob is at (6,3). He can go to (4,0) or (3,0). Let's choose (4,0). The path: from (6,3) to (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1) to (5,0) to (4,0)? But (5,0) is a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters include (5,0). So (5,0) is non-empty and not walkable. Alternatively, we can go: (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (4,0). But (4,2) is a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are at: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). So (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty -> not walkable.\n\n   So the path for Bob: \n        (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) ... but (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable. \n        Alternatively: (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> but (5,2) is kitchen counter -> not walkable.\n\n   We need to avoid counters. The empty tiles are the ones not listed. So, for example, (3,1) is empty? We see that (3,1) is not in the kitchen counter list, so it should be empty.\n\n   How about:\n        (6,3) -> (5,3) [empty? we don't have a list of empty, but assuming it's not a counter, so empty] -> (4,3) [empty] -> (4,2) is a counter -> cannot go. \n        Then we can go from (4,3) to (3,3) [empty?] -> (3,2) is a counter -> stuck.\n\n   Alternatively, go down from (6,3) to (6,2)? But (6,2) is not a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters do not include (6,2). So (6,2) should be empty. Then from (6,2) to (5,2) is a counter -> cannot. Then from (6,2) to (6,1) [empty?] -> (6,1) is not a counter -> then (6,0) is a counter. Then from (6,1) to (5,1) [empty?] -> (5,1) is not a counter? The counters include (5,0) and (5,2) and (5,4) but not (5,1). So (5,1) is empty. Then (5,1) to (4,1) [empty?] -> (4,1) is not a counter -> then (4,1) to (4,0) [pot] -> adjacent. So:\n\n        Bob at (6,3): \n            Turn 13: change orientation to D (to face down for interaction with (6,4))\n            Turn 14: I (pick up onion from (6,4))\n            Then, he needs to go to (4,0) pot:\n                Turn 15: move down to (6,2) -> now facing down? (after moving down, orientation becomes down)\n                Turn 16: move down to (6,1)\n                Turn 17: move left to (5,1) -> orientation left\n                Turn 18: move left to (4,1) -> orientation left\n                Turn 19: change orientation to D (to face the pot at (4,0) which is south)\n                Turn 20: I (put onion in pot at (4,0))\n\n   But note: we are planning for Alice, but Bob is controlled by the teammate. We can optionally plan for Bob? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But we are to output only Alice's actions? Or we can coordinate? The task says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we can assume we can control Bob? But the answer format only shows Alice's actions? Let me check:\n\n  \"Answer Format: \n      Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n      ... \n\n  Where each action a_t ∈ {U, D, L, R, I, S}.\"\n\n  It only shows Alice's actions. So we only output Alice's actions. But we can assume Bob will act optimally? Or we have to plan for Alice assuming Bob might not be controlled? The problem says: \"optimize coordination\", so we can assume we control both? But the output is only for Alice.\n\n  Since we are only required to output Alice's actions, we focus on Alice. But we need to consider Bob's potential actions to avoid conflicts and to coordinate.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". The \"optionally\" suggests we might output Bob's actions? But the answer format doesn't have Bob. So I think we only output Alice.\n\n  Therefore, we plan Alice's actions and hope that Bob will do the right thing. Alternatively, we can assume Bob is controlled by a separate agent and we have to account for his possible actions? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n  Since we are to maximize the total reward, we should try to coordinate. We can plan for Alice and suggest what Bob should do, but we only output Alice's actions.\n\n  Let me refocus: we are to output a sequence of actions for Alice.\n\n  So, for Alice:\n\n  Turn 13: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\n  Then, she needs to go to a pot. The closest pot is at (3,0). From (2,1) to (3,0):\n\n        (2,1) -> (3,1) [right] -> then (3,1) to (3,0) is blocked. So she must interact from (3,1) facing down to the pot at (3,0).\n\n        Steps:\n          Turn 13: I (pick up onion) -> now holding onion.\n          Turn 14: R (move right to (3,1)) -> now at (3,1), facing right.\n          Turn 15: D (change orientation to down) -> now facing down towards (3,0)\n          Turn 16: I (put onion in pot at (3,0)) -> now pot has 1 onion, Alice holding nothing.\n\n  Now, the pot at (3,0) has 1 onion. We need two more. There is another onion at (6,4) but Bob might get it. Also, we can get more onions from the dispensers.\n\n  After putting the onion, Alice can get another onion. There are two options:\n\n  Option 1: Go to the onion dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4) to get a new onion and put it in the same pot.\n\n  Option 2: There is another pot at (4,0). We might start a second soup? But we only have two onions so far (one in the pot and one on the counter at (6,4) which Bob might get). We need more onions.\n\n  Since we are only controlling Alice, let her get another onion.\n\n  From (3,1), she can go to (3,2) but (3,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) -> not walkable. So she must go around.\n\n        (3,1) -> (4,1) [right] -> then (4,1) to (4,2) is blocked (kitchen counter). Then go to (4,1) to (4,0) is blocked (pot). So how to go up?\n\n        Alternative: from (3,1) go to (3,2) is blocked. Then she must go left to (2,1) and then up? \n\n        From (3,1) move left to (2,1) [Turn 17: L] -> at (2,1), facing left.\n        Then from (2,1) move up to (2,2) is blocked (kitchen counter with onion? but we already took the onion? Actually, we took the onion from (2,2) so now it is empty? But the tile is still a kitchen counter -> non-empty tile? Or does \"non-empty\" refer to having an item? \n\n        The rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning tiles that are not of type \"Empty Tile\". The kitchen counter is a tile type and you cannot walk on it regardless of having an item. So (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot walk.\n\n        So Alice must go from (2,1) to (1,1)? But we don't know the map. The kitchen counters include (0,1) and (1,0) and (2,0). So (1,1) might be empty? Let's assume it is.\n\n        Steps for Alice to go to (3,4) (onion dispenser):\n\n          From (3,1) to (3,0) is blocked (pot). So:\n            Turn 17: move left to (2,1) [from (3,1) after turn 16, she is at (3,1) and facing down? After turn 16: she did I at (3,1) facing down, so after interaction she is still at (3,1) facing down? Then turn 17: move left to (2,1) -> now at (2,1), facing left.\n\n          Turn 18: move up to (2,2) is blocked. So move left to (1,1) [L? but she is at (2,1) and facing left, so moving left would go to (1,1). Assuming (1,1) is empty. Then at (1,1), facing left.\n\n          Turn 19: move up to (1,2) [if empty] -> then (1,2) to (1,3) -> (1,4) is a kitchen counter -> cannot go. Alternatively, from (1,1) move up? But (1,1) to (1,2) must be empty? Then (1,2) to (1,3) -> (1,3) is not in the counter list? Then (1,3) to (1,4) is blocked? (1,4) is a kitchen counter. So we can go to (2,3) from (1,3)? \n\n          This is getting complex. We need a better route.\n\n        Alternatively, from (2,1) we can go down? But (2,0) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. So we go left to (1,1) and then up? But we are trying to go north to the onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). \n\n        Actually, the onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). We can go via the top. From (2,1) to (2,2) is blocked, but we can go:\n\n          (2,1) -> (1,1) [left] -> (1,1) -> (1,2) [up] -> (1,2) -> (1,3) [up] -> (1,3) -> (2,3) [right] -> (2,3) -> (3,3) [right] -> (3,3) -> (3,4) [up] -> but (3,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty, so we cannot walk there. So we must be adjacent to (3,4) to interact. So we can go to (3,3) and face up to interact.\n\n        Steps from (2,1) after turn 17:\n\n          Turn 18: L (move left to (1,1)) -> at (1,1), facing left.\n          Turn 19: U (move up to (1,2)) -> at (1,2), facing up.\n          Turn 20: U (move up to (1,3)) -> at (1,3), facing up.\n          Turn 21: R (move right to (2,3)) -> at (2,3), facing right.\n          Turn 22: R (move right to (3,3)) -> at (3,3), facing right.\n          Turn 23: change orientation to U (to face up towards (3,4))\n          Turn 24: I (grab an onion from dispenser)\n\n        This is 11 turns from turn 13 (turns 13-24) and we are only at getting the second onion. Then she needs to go back to the pot. That's too long.\n\n  Option 2: After putting the onion in the pot at turn 16, Alice can go to the onion dispenser at (4,4) via a different route? Or use the existing onion on the counter at (6,4) but Bob is closer.\n\n  Alternatively, after Alice puts the onion in the pot at (3,0), she can go to the other onion dispenser at (4,4) but that is also far.\n\n  Let me check the distance from (3,1) to (4,4):\n\n        (3,1) -> (4,1) [right] -> then (4,1) to (4,2) blocked -> so same problem.\n\n  We need to go around the counters. The map might have a gap at the top? For example, from (3,1) we can go to (3,2) blocked, so we go to (4,1) then (5,1) then (5,2) blocked -> not working.\n\n  How about going down? But (3,0) is a pot and (4,0) is a pot, so we are stuck at the bottom.\n\n  The only way is to go left and up as before.\n\n  This seems inefficient. Maybe we should get Bob involved.\n\n  However, since we are only controlling Alice, we must focus on her actions.\n\n  Revised plan for Alice:\n\n  After putting the onion in the pot at (3,0) at turn 16, instead of going for a new onion, she can go get a plate and be ready to serve? But the soup is not cooked yet. We only have one onion in the pot. We need two more. Also, the cooking hasn't started.\n\n  Alternatively, she can go to the other pot and start another soup? But we don't have onions.\n\n  Given the constraints, perhaps the best is to get the onion from (6,4) but Bob is closer and might get it. We don't control Bob.\n\n  Let me think about Bob's action history: I, R, R, U, I. The most recent is I (interact). He is at (6,3) and facing up. The last interaction might have been with what? He was at (6,3) and facing up. The adjacent tile to the north of (6,3) is (6,4)? But (6,4) is a kitchen counter with an onion. So his last interaction at turn 12 (since turn 13 is current) was with (6,4)? But he is not holding anything now. So he might have tried to interact but the counter has an onion, so he would pick it up? But the state says he is holding nothing. And the counter at (6,4) still has an onion. So his last interaction might have failed? Or he did something else.\n\n  The action history: I at turn 8, then R, R, U, I at turn 12. So at turn 12 he did I. He was at (6,3) facing up. So he tried to interact with (6,4) which is south of him? (6,4) is below (6,3). He is facing up (north), so he is not facing (6,4). Therefore, his interaction would fail? Because to interact with (6,4) he must face south. So at turn 12, his interaction failed.\n\n  So Bob is still at (6,3) facing up, and the onion at (6,4) is still there.\n\n  Therefore, Alice might go for that onion after she puts her onion in the pot.\n\n  New plan for Alice:\n\n  After putting the onion in the pot at (3,0) at turn 16, she can go to (6,4) to pick up that onion and put it in the pot.\n\n  How to get from (3,1) to (6,4)?\n\n        (3,1) -> (4,1) [R] -> (5,1) [R] -> (6,1) [R] -> (6,2) [U] -> (6,3) [U] -> then at (6,3) she can interact with (6,4) by facing south.\n\n        But (6,3) to (6,4) is south. So:\n\n          Turn 17: R (move to (4,1), facing right)\n          Turn 18: R (move to (5,1), facing right)\n          Turn 19: R (move to (6,1), facing right)\n          Turn 20: U (move to (6,2), facing up)\n          Turn 21: U (move to (6,3), facing up)\n          Turn 22: change orientation to D (to face down towards (6,4))\n          Turn 23: I (pick up onion from (6,4))\n\n        Then, she needs to take it to a pot. The nearest pot might be (4,0) or (3,0). Let's choose (4,0). From (6,3) to (4,0):\n\n          (6,3) -> (5,3) [L] -> (4,3) [L] -> (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. So she must go down:\n\n          From (6,3) to (6,2) [D] -> (6,1) [D] -> (5,1) [L] -> (4,1) [L] -> then at (4,1) face down to (4,0).\n\n          So after turn 23:\n            Turn 24: D (move down to (6,2), facing down)\n            Turn 25: D (move down to (6,1), facing down)\n            Turn 26: L (move left to (5,1), facing left)\n            Turn 27: L (move left to (4,1), facing left)\n            Turn 28: D (change orientation to down) to face (4,0)\n            Turn 29: I (put onion in pot at (4,0))\n\n        This is very long.\n\n  Given the time, we might only be able to get two onions in pots. But we need three for a soup.\n\n  Alternatively, after Alice puts the first onion in the pot at (3,0) at turn 16, she can go to the onion dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4) to get a new onion, but as we saw, the route is long.\n\n  But let's calculate the steps for the shorter route to (3,4) from (3,1) via the left side: we had 7 moves to get to (3,3) and then interact. That's turn 23 to interact with the dispenser. Then she can put it in the pot at (3,0) by going back: from (3,3) to (3,2) blocked, so she must go (3,3)->(2,3)->(2,2) blocked-> (2,1)->(3,1). Then from (3,1) face down to (3,0) to interact. So:\n\n        Turn 24: move left to (2,3) [L]\n        Turn 25: move down to (2,2) blocked -> cannot. So she must go (3,3)->(4,3)->(4,2) blocked-> not working.\n\n        Alternatively, (3,3) -> (3,2) is blocked, so she has to go left to (2,3) then down to (2,2) blocked, so then down to (2,1) via (2,3)->(2,2) blocked -> she can go (2,3)->(1,3)->(1,2)->(1,1)->(2,1). Then from (2,1) to (3,1) and then interact with the pot.\n\n        This is even longer.\n\n  Given the complexity, and since we are at turn 13 and we are planning for 10 turns (up to turn 23), we might only be able to do:\n\n        Turn 13: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n        Turn 14: R (move to (3,1))\n        Turn 15: D (face down)\n        Turn 16: I (put onion in pot at (3,0))\n\n        Then, for the next 7 turns (turns 17-23), she can try to get to the onion at (6,4) or to an onion dispenser. But she might not make it in 7 turns.\n\n  Alternatively, after turn 16, she can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate. But the soup is not ready. And we only have one onion in the pot. We need to get more onions.\n\n  Given the constraints, perhaps the best is to have Alice help put another onion in the same pot. But she would need to get an onion.\n\n  However, there is an onion at (6,4) and Bob is there. We can hope that Bob picks it up and brings it to the pot. But we don't control Bob.\n\n  Since we have to plan only Alice's actions, and we want to maximize the reward, we should focus on what Alice can do to complete the soup.\n\n  Let's try to have Alice get a plate and be ready to serve the soup once it's cooked. But the soup in the pot at (3,0) only has one onion. It needs two more and then cook for 5 turns. That will take time.\n\n  Alternatively, after turn 16, Alice can go to an onion dispenser to get a new onion and put it in the same pot. But as seen, it takes many turns.\n\n  Given the time, I propose the following for Alice for turns 13-23 (11 turns):\n\n  Turn 13: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n  Turn 14: R (move to (3,1))\n  Turn 15: D (change orientation to down)\n  Turn 16: I (put onion in pot at (3,0))  [now pot has 1 onion]\n  Then, she can try to get to the onion dispenser at (4,4) but let's see if there's a shorter way.\n\n  One more idea: after turn 16, she can go to the kitchen counter at (2,0)? But it is a counter and might be empty. She can't walk there.\n\n  How about she goes to (1,1) and then up to (1,2), etc. to the onion dispenser. But it's long.\n\n  Perhaps she can wait for Bob to bring the onion from (6,4) and in the meantime, she gets a plate.\n\n  So:\n\n        After turn 16, Alice goes to the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\n        From (3,1) to (0,2):\n\n          (3,1) -> (2,1) [L] -> (1,1) [L] -> (0,1) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. So she must go up before going left.\n\n          (3,1) -> (3,2) blocked. So she goes left to (2,1) [done in turn 17: L]\n\n          Then from (2,1) to (2,0) is a counter -> blocked. So she goes up to (2,2) blocked. So she goes left to (1,1) [turn 18: L]\n\n          Then from (1,1) to (1,0) is a counter -> blocked. So she goes up to (1,2) [turn 19: U]\n\n          Then from (1,2) to (0,2) is west. (0,2) is the plate dispenser. So she needs to be at (0,1) or (0,3) or (1,2) adjacent and facing west. She is at (1,2) and can face west to interact with (0,2). But (0,2) is west of (1,2). \n\n          So after turn 19: at (1,2), facing up (from move up). She needs to face west (left) to interact with (0,2).\n\n          Turn 20: change orientation to L (west)\n          Turn 21: I (grab a plate from dispenser)\n\n        Then she is holding a plate. Now, she can wait for the soup to be ready. But the soup only has one onion. It needs two more.\n\n        She can then go to the serving counter at (7,2) to deliver, but she has no soup.\n\n  This doesn't help.\n\n  Given the complexity, perhaps the most efficient thing is for Alice to get the onion from (6,4) after turn 16, even though it takes many turns. We'll plan for 20 turns (up to turn 33) but the problem says \"next several turns\", so let's do 10 turns for now.\n\n  We output Alice's actions for turns 13 to 23 (11 actions).\n\n  Plan A (10 actions):\n\n  Turn 13: I  [pick up onion from (2,2)]\n  Turn 14: R  [move to (3,1)]\n  Turn 15: D  [face down]\n  Turn 16: I  [put onion in pot at (3,0)]\n  Turn 17: L  [move to (2,1), face left]\n  Turn 18: U  [face up? or move? Let's move up to (2,2) is blocked, so we move left to (1,1) -> action: L]\n  Actually, from (2,1) facing left (after move left), she is at (2,1) facing left. Then to move to (1,1), she can move left: Turn 18: L [ to (1,1)]\n  Turn 19: U [ to (1,2), face up]\n  Turn 20: U [ to (1,3), face up]\n  Turn 21: R [ to (2,3), face right]\n  Turn 22: R [ to (3,3), face right]\n  Turn 23: U [ to (3,4)? blocked. So instead, at (3,3) she can face up to interact with (3,4) onion dispenser. But she needs to interact, so we can do at turn 23: change orientation to U.\n\n  Then on turn 24 she can interact.\n\n  But we are only required to plan up to turn 23.\n\n  So for turns 13-23:\n\n      Turn 13: I\n      Turn 14: R\n      Turn 15: D\n      Turn 16: I\n      Turn 17: L  [ to (2,1) ]\n      Turn 18: L  [ to (1,1) ]\n      Turn 19: U  [ to (1,2) ]\n      Turn 20: U  [ to (1,3) ]\n      Turn 21: R  [ to (2,3) ]\n      Turn 22: R  [ to (3,3) ]\n      Turn 23: U  [ change orientation to up? or move up? but (3,4) is blocked, so she can't move up. So she should change orientation to up to prepare for interaction. So action: U (which is change orientation to up) ]\n\n  But note: the action set includes U for move up or change orientation to up? The rules distinguish:\n\n        - Move (U) means move up and change orientation to up.\n        - Change orientation (U) means change orientation to up without moving.\n\n  The action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S} and they include both move and change orientation. Specifically, when you do U, if you can move up (the adjacent tile in that direction is empty), then you move and change orientation. Otherwise, if the adjacent tile is not empty, then you only change orientation.\n\n  In this case, at (3,3), the tile to the north (3,4) is an onion dispenser (non-empty), so she cannot move there. Therefore, when she does U at turn 23, it will only change her orientation to up.\n\n  This is correct because then on the next turn (turn 24) she can interact with the dispenser.\n\n  So for 10 turns, we have turns 13 to 22 (10 actions) or 13 to 23 (11 actions)? The turn numbering:\n\n        Turn 13: first action\n        ...\n        Turn 13+9 = turn 22: 10th action\n\n  So if we want exactly 10 actions, we go to turn 22.\n\n  But the problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\", and H is not specified. Let's assume H=10, so turns 13 to 22 (10 actions).\n\n  Therefore, for Alice:\n\n      Turn 13: I\n      Turn 14: R\n      Turn 15: D\n      Turn 16: I\n      Turn 17: L\n      Turn 18: L\n      Turn 19: U\n      Turn 20: U\n      Turn 21: R\n      Turn 22: R   [ at (3,3) ]\n\n  Then on turn 23, she can change to U and interact, but that's beyond 10 turns.\n\n  Given the challenges, and since the pot has only one onion, we might not complete a soup in the near future. \n\n  Alternatively, after turn 16, Alice can try to go to (6,4) to get the onion there, but it's also far.\n\n  Considering the time, and to have a complete plan within 10 turns, I will output the first 10 actions including the initial interaction and move towards the second onion source.\n\n  Final decision for Alice for turns 13-22 (10 actions):\n\n      Turn 13: I   # pick up onion from (2,2)\n      Turn 14: R   # move to (3,1)\n      Turn 15: D   # face down to interact with pot\n      Turn 16: I   # put onion in pot at (3,0)\n      Turn 17: L   # move west to (2,1)\n      Turn 18: L   # move west to (1,1)\n      Turn 19: U   # move north to (1,2)\n      Turn 20: U   # move north to (1,3)\n      Turn 21: R   # move east to (2,3)\n      Turn 22: R   # move east to (3,3)\n\n  Then, on turn 23, she can face north and interact with the onion dispenser.\n\n  This is a plan to get a second onion for the pot.\n\n  We hope that Bob will pick up the onion at (6,4) and deliver it to the pot.\n\n  With two onions in the pot, we only need one more to start cooking.\n\n  But this is beyond our 10 turns.\n\n  Given the constraints, this is a feasible plan.\n\n  So we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: I\nTurn 14: R\nTurn 15: D\nTurn 16: I\nTurn 17: L\nTurn 18: L\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: R\nTurn 22: R\n}\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice should focus on contributing to a 3-onion soup by utilizing the available onion on the kitchen counter at (2,2) and then moving toward an onion dispenser to gather additional ingredients. The pot at (3,0) is the closest and should be prioritized. Bob is positioned near the onion on the kitchen counter at (6,4), and while Alice cannot control Bob directly, it is reasonable to assume he will handle that onion given his proximity and orientation. Alice's actions should avoid conflicts and efficiently sequence her movements.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 13 to 22):\n- **Turn 13 (I)**: Alice is at (2,1) facing down, adjacent to the kitchen counter at (2,2) which holds an onion. She interacts to pick up the onion.\n- **Turn 14 (R)**: Move right to (3,1), now facing right, positioning herself above the pot at (3,0).\n- **Turn 15 (D)**: Change orientation to down to face the pot at (3,0).\n- **Turn 16 (I)**: Interact to place the onion into the pot at (3,0). The pot now has 1 onion.\n- **Turn 17 (L)**: Move left to (2,1), now facing left, to start navigating toward the onion dispensers at (3,4)/(4,4).\n- **Turn 18 (L)**: Move left to (1,1), now facing left.\n- **Turn 19 (U)**: Move up to (1,2), now facing up.\n- **Turn 20 (U)**: Move up to (1,3), now facing up.\n- **Turn 21 (R)**: Move right to (2,3), now facing right.\n- **Turn 22 (R)**: Move right to (3,3), now facing right, adjacent to the onion dispenser at (3,4). On the next turn (beyond this sequence), she can face up and interact to grab an onion.\n\n### Coordination & Reasoning:\n- **Pot Utilization**: The pot at (3,0) is targeted first for efficiency. After Alice adds the onion from (2,2), the pot has 1 onion. Bob is expected to pick up the onion at (6,4) and deliver it to a pot (ideally (3,0) or (4,0)), bringing the total to 2 onions. Alice will gather a third onion to complete the recipe.\n- **Efficiency**: This plan ensures Alice spends minimal time idle. By moving toward the onion dispenser after depositing her onion, she prepares for the next ingredient.\n- **Conflict Avoidance**: Alice's path avoids Bob's location (6,3) and uses empty tiles (verified by the absence of non-empty tiles in her path).\n- **Long-Term Synergy**: Once the soup is cooking (after 3 onions and 5 turns), Alice can focus on plate retrieval and serving. Bob can assist with additional tasks.\n\nThis sequence sets up the soup preparation efficiently within 10 turns, leveraging Alice's current state and likely Bob actions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: I\nTurn 14: R\nTurn 15: D\nTurn 16: I\nTurn 17: L\nTurn 18: L\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: R\nTurn 22: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes. The only recipe given is Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns. There are no tomato dispensers, so we can only make onion soup. The onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4), and the plate dispenser is at (0,2). Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), and the serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nCurrent turn is t=16. Alice is at (3,1) facing right, holding nothing. Bob is at (3,3) facing left, holding nothing. Action history shows what they've been doing, but I need to focus on future actions.\n\nKey constraints: Players can carry one item at a time, can't walk through each other or non-empty tiles. Interaction requires being adjacent and facing the tile.\n\nCurrent non-empty kitchen counters: (2,2) has an onion, and (6,4) has an onion. So there are onions already on counters that can be picked up.\n\nPots are all empty, so we need to fill them with three onions each to start cooking.\n\nCooking time is 5 turns for the recipe. After cooking, we need to serve with a plate to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nSince there are two pots, we can cook two soups, but we need to manage the ingredients and plates.\n\nFirst, let's plan to make at least one soup as efficiently as possible.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), which is above the pots at (3,0) and (4,0). She's facing right, so towards (4,1), but (4,1) might be empty or not. The grid isn't fully described, but from tile types, I can infer walkable tiles.\n\nList all relevant positions:\n\n- Kitchen counters: various positions, but only some have items.\n\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n\nAlice at (3,1): one step up from (3,0) pot? (3,1) is directly above (3,0), since y=1 is above y=0? Typically, in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement says: U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=4 is top? Let's see the positions.\n\nFor example, (3,1) to (3,0) is down, since D (x, y-1) from y=1 to y=0.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) to (3,4) would be up? U (x, y+1) from y=3 to y=4.\n\nBut onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4), so y=4 is top row.\n\nBob at (3,3), which is below (3,4), so he can go up to get an onion.\n\nAlice at (3,1), above the pots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nTo interact with a pot, say (3,0), Alice needs to be adjacent and facing it. From (3,1), if she moves down to (3,0), but (3,0) is a pot, which is not empty, so she can't walk onto it. She must be adjacent, like on (3,1) or (4,0) or (2,0), but (2,0) is a kitchen counter, which might be empty or not.\n\nKitchen counters are at (0,0),(1,0),etc., but not all are occupied. Only (2,2) and (6,4) have onions.\n\n(2,0) is a kitchen counter, and it might be empty since not listed as non-empty. Similarly, (3,0) is pot, so not walkable.\n\nSo for Alice to interact with pot (3,0), she needs to be on an adjacent empty tile and facing it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (3,0) are: up (3,1), down - but y= -1? No, grid probably from y=0 to 4, so adjacent are: (3,1) north, (2,0) west, (4,0) east, and south would be out of bound or something. Similarly, (4,0) has (3,0) west, (5,0) east? (5,0) is kitchen counter.\n\nList adjacent tiles:\n\nFor pot (3,0):\n\n- North: (3,1) - this is empty tile? (3,1) is where Alice is, and it should be walkable, I think, since players can be there.\n\nTile types: only dispensers, pots, counters are non-empty, so (3,1) is not listed, so it should be an empty tile, walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) should be empty.\n\n- South: no, since y=0 is bottom.\n\n- West: (2,0) - kitchen counter, which is non-empty, so not walkable.\n\n- East: (4,0) - but (4,0) is another pot, also non-empty.\n\n(4,0) is a separate pot.\n\nSo for pot (3,0), the only adjacent empty tile is north: (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, for pot (4,0), adjacent empty tiles: north (4,1), and possibly west (3,0) but that's a pot, not empty, or east (5,0) kitchen counter.\n\n(5,0) is a kitchen counter, non-empty if occupied, but currently not listed with item, so it might be empty counter, but counters are non-empty tiles, meaning you can't walk on them.\n\nTile types: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and others are not walkable.\n\nSo for interaction, player must be on an empty tile adjacent to the target tile.\n\nFor pot (3,0), the adjacent empty tiles are only (3,1), since (2,0) is counter (non-walkable), (4,0) is pot (non-walkable), and south is out of bound.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0), adjacent empty tiles: (4,1) north, and (3,0) is pot, (5,0) is counter, so only (4,1).\n\nAlso, (3,1) is adjacent to both (3,0) and (4,0)? (3,1) is north of (3,0), and also adjacent to (4,0) if diagonal? No, adjacent means cardinal directions only, I think.\n\nIn grid, adjacent usually means sharing an edge, so (3,1) is adjacent to (3,0) (south), and to (4,1), etc., but not to (4,0) directly; (4,0) is diagonal from (3,1), so not adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,1), it can interact with (3,0) by facing south.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,1), it can interact with (4,0) by facing south.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), facing right (east). To interact with (3,0), she needs to face south. Since she's on (3,1), adjacent to (3,0), and facing it.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nNow, Bob is at (3,3), facing left (west). Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). (3,3) is directly below (3,4), so he can go up to (3,4) or interact from (3,3) by facing north? (3,3) to (3,4) is up, U (x, y+1).\n\nBut to interact with dispenser at (3,4), he needs to be on an adjacent empty tile and facing it.\n\nAdjacent to (3,4): south (3,3), east (4,4), west (2,4)? (2,4) is kitchen counter, non-walkable.\n\n(4,4) is dispenser, so not walkable.\n\nSo only south (3,3) is adjacent empty tile for (3,4).\n\nSimilarly for (4,4), adjacent empty tiles: south (4,3), and west (3,4) dispenser, east (5,4)? (5,4) is kitchen counter, non-walkable.\n\n(4,3) should be empty tile.\n\nBob at (3,3), which is adjacent to (3,4) south? (3,3) is below (3,4), so if y increases up, (3,4) is north of (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can face north to interact with (3,4) dispenser.\n\nSimilarly, he could move to (4,3) to interact with (4,4).\n\nBut currently at (3,3), facing west.\n\nAlso, there is a kitchen counter at (2,2) with an onion, and (6,4) with an onion.\n\n(6,4) is a kitchen counter with onion, so it can be picked up.\n\nNow, we need to fill a pot with three onions. Since pots are empty, we can start.\n\nAlice is near the pots, Bob is near the onion sources.\n\nAlso, plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nTo maximize reward, since cooking takes 5 turns, we should start cooking as soon as possible.\n\nCurrent turn t=16. If we add three onions to a pot at turn t, it starts cooking, and will be ready at t+5, so turn 21.\n\nThen we need to serve it with a plate.\n\nSimilarly for second pot.\n\nBut we have limited onions and plates.\n\nOnion dispensers provide infinite onions, I assume, since they are sources.\n\nPlayers can grab from dispensers.\n\nThere are also onions on counters: (2,2) and (6,4), so we can use those to save time.\n\nBut players need to pick them up.\n\nNow, let's plan for Alice and Bob.\n\nFirst, Alice is at (3,1), holding nothing. She can go to the onion sources or use existing onions.\n\nBut onion sources are at (3,4) and (4,4), which are far; she is at (3,1), so she would need to move up.\n\nBob is closer at (3,3).\n\nPerhaps Bob should handle onions, and Alice handle the pot or plates.\n\nBut Alice is right above the pots.\n\nSince there is an onion on counter at (2,2), which is nearby.\n\n(2,2) is kitchen counter with onion. Alice is at (3,1). (2,2) is one left and one up? From (3,1) to (2,2): left to (2,1), then up to (2,2)? But (2,2) is counter, not walkable, so to pick up from (2,2), she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (2,2): north? (2,3), south (2,1), east (3,2), west (1,2)? But (1,2) not specified, probably empty or counter.\n\nTile types: kitchen counters include (2,2), so (2,2) itself is not walkable, but adjacent empty tiles.\n\nFor (2,2) counter:\n\n- North: (2,3) - should be empty, not listed.\n\n- South: (2,1) - not listed, probably empty.\n\n- East: (3,2) - which is a kitchen counter? Tile types: kitchen counters include (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), etc. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter, non-walkable.\n\n- West: (1,2) - not listed, but (0,2) is plate dispenser, (1,2) might be empty or counter? Kitchen counters are at (0,0),(1,0),etc., but (1,2) not listed, so probably empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) not listed, empty.\n\nSo for (2,2), adjacent empty tiles: (2,1), (2,3), and (1,2), (3,2) are counters, so not walkable, so only (2,1) south and (2,3) north? And west (1,2) if it exists.\n\nPositions: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4.\n\n(1,2): not in kitchen counter list, so it should be empty tile.\n\nKitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\nSo (1,2) is not listed, so it is an empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) not listed, empty.\n\n(2,3) not listed, empty.\n\n(3,2) is kitchen counter, so non-walkable.\n\nSo for (2,2) counter, adjacent empty tiles: (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), and (3,2) is counter, so not adjacent for interaction? Adjacent means sharing edge, so (2,2) has (1,2) west, (3,2) east, (2,1) south, (2,3) north.\n\nBut (1,2) and (2,1) and (2,3) are empty, so players can stand there to interact.\n\nSimilarly for other counters.\n\nBack to Alice at (3,1). She can go to (2,1) or (2,2) directly? No, (2,2) not walkable, so she needs to move to (2,1) or (3,2) but (3,2) is counter, not walkable.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move left to (2,1), then she is at (2,1), facing south or wherever, but to interact with (2,2), she needs to face north, since (2,2) is north of (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is south of (2,2), so from (2,1), facing north to interact.\n\nSimilarly, she could go to (1,2) or (2,3), but (2,1) is closer.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (2,1): move left (L), then she is at (2,1), then she can change orientation to face north, then interact to pick up the onion from counter (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) has an onion, so she can pick it up if she is empty-handed.\n\nAlice is holding nothing, so yes.\n\nThen she can take that onion to a pot.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0), close to (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,1), she can go to (3,1), then to (3,0) is down, but (3,0) not walkable, so from (3,1), she can face south to interact with pot (3,0).\n\nSince she is on (3,1), adjacent to (3,0).\n\nSimilarly for (4,0).\n\nBut let's sequence actions.\n\nFirst, for Alice at turn 16:\n\nShe is at (3,1), facing right.\n\nTo go to (2,1), she needs to move left. Since she is facing right, moving left might require changing orientation or just move.\n\nAction: she can move left (L), which changes position to (2,1) and orientation to left? No.\n\nPlayer actions: Move (L/R/U/D) changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y) and orientation left, similarly for others.\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\nSo when she moves, it changes both position and facing.\n\nShe can also change orientation without moving: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But if she just changes orientation, she doesn't move.\n\nFor efficiency, she can directly move left to (2,1), which will also make her face left.\n\nThen from (2,1), she is at (2,1), facing left, but to interact with (2,2) north, she needs to face up.\n\nSo she needs to change orientation to up (U), which changes facing to up without moving, since (2,2) is not empty tile? Change orientation: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" It's a bit confusing.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it means that when you choose to change orientation, you don't move, but the condition is that if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, you can still change orientation, but since you're not moving, it's fine. You can always change orientation, I believe.\n\nThe text: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it means that if you try to move in a direction where the adjacent tile is not empty, you don't move, but for change orientation, it's separate.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Each player can: Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\nSo move action changes both.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is poorly worded. I think \"Change Orientation\" is a separate action that only changes facing, without moving. The \"no move if...\" might be a mistake or for move action.\n\nLet's see the full text:\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it should be that for change orientation, it never moves, so the \"if\" part might be redundant or misphrased.\n\nPerhaps it means that for change orientation, you specify a direction, and it changes your orientation to that direction, and you don't move, regardless of adjacent tiles.\n\nSimilarly, for move, if you try to move to a non-empty tile, you don't move, but you might change orientation? The move action says it changes position and orientation, so if you can't move because tile not empty, you might not change position, but orientation might change? The text doesn't specify.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nLet me assume that for move action, if the target tile is not empty or not walkable, the move fails, and no change, but the orientation might still change? The text doesn't say.\n\nTo simplify, I think in Overcooked, if you try to move into a wall or object, you don't move, but your orientation changes to that direction.\n\nSimilarly for change orientation, it only changes facing.\n\nBut here the description is messy.\n\nFor this task, I'll assume:\n\n- Move action: you attempt to move in the direction. If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, you move there and face that direction. If not, you don't move, but you face that direction.\n\n- Change Orientation action: you change your facing to the specified direction without moving, regardless of adjacent tiles.\n\nThat seems reasonable.\n\nFor example, if you are at (3,1) facing right, and you choose Move Left, you move to (2,1) and face left.\n\nIf you choose Change Orientation Left, you stay at (3,1) and face left.\n\nSimilarly, if you are facing a wall and choose Move, you don't move but face that direction.\n\nBack to Alice.\n\nAt turn 16, Alice at (3,1) facing right.\n\nTo pick up onion from (2,2), she can:\n\nOption 1: Move Left to (2,1), facing left. Then, she is at (2,1) facing left, but (2,2) is north, so she needs to face up. So she can Change Orientation Up (U), now facing up. Then Interact (I) to pick up onion from (2,2) north.\n\nAfter that, she is holding an onion.\n\nThen she can go to a pot, say (3,0). From (2,1), she can move right to (3,1), facing right. Then from (3,1), she can face south to interact with (3,0), but she is facing right, so she needs to Change Orientation Down (D) to face south, then Interact to add ingredient to pot.\n\nSince she is holding onion, and pot is empty, she can add it.\n\nBut adding one onion, pot needs three.\n\nSimilarly, she could go to (4,0) but similar.\n\nNow, Bob is at (3,3) facing left.\n\nHe can get onions from dispensers or counters.\n\nThere is onion at (6,4), kitchen counter.\n\nBob at (3,3), he can go up to (3,4) to get onion from dispenser.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move up (U) to (3,4)? But (3,4) is dispenser, not walkable, so he cannot move to (3,4). He must interact from (3,3).\n\nAt (3,3), he is facing left. To interact with (3,4) north, he needs to face up. So he can Change Orientation Up (U), now facing up. Then Interact to grab an onion from dispenser (3,4).\n\nThen he is holding an onion.\n\nHe can then take it to a pot. Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), which are at y=0, he is at y=3, so he needs to go down.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,2), but (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he can't go directly down.\n\nAdjacent tiles: from (3,3), he can move down to (3,2)? (3,2) is counter, not empty, so he cannot move there.\n\nHe can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3), etc.\n\n(2,3) should be empty, not listed.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) empty.\n\nThen from there, he can go down to (2,2) or (4,2), but (2,2) has onion, but he might pick it up or not.\n\n(2,2) has an onion, but Alice is going for it, so better not conflict.\n\nBob can go to (4,3), then down to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he can't.\n\nTo get to y=1 or y=0, he needs to go around.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), move right to (4,3), facing right. Then from (4,3), he can move down to (4,2)? No, (4,2) counter. So he can move down to (4,2) only if empty, but not, so he can't.\n\nHe needs to go to (4,1) or something.\n\n(4,1) should be empty.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down to (4,2)? No, not possible. Or move left/right, but to go down, he can go to (3,3) then to (3,2) no, or to (4,3) then to (5,3) or (3,3).\n\nThe only way down is via (3,1) or (4,1), but (3,1) is occupied by Alice or not.\n\nPaths: from (3,3), he can move east to (4,3), then from (4,3), he can move south? D to (4,2) not possible, so he must go to (5,3) or something.\n\n(5,3) not listed, probably empty.\n\nThen from (5,3), move down to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSimilarly, all (x,2) for x=2,3,4,5 are counters except possibly others.\n\n(2,2),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2) are all kitchen counters, so the row y=2 is mostly counters, not walkable.\n\nTo go from y=3 to y=1, he needs to go through y=3 to x where y=1 is accessible, like (3,1) or (4,1).\n\nFor example, from (3,3), move west to (2,3), then from (2,3) move down to (2,2)? No, (2,2) counter. Move down to (2,1)? (2,1) is empty, and (2,2) is counter, so from (2,3) he can move down to (2,2) only if empty, not, so he can move down to (2,2) no.\n\nFrom (2,3), he can move down to (2,2)? Target tile (2,2) is not empty, so he cannot move there.\n\nHe can only move to empty tiles.\n\nSo from (2,3), he can move south to (2,2) only if (2,2) empty, but it's not, so he cannot.\n\nSimilarly, he can move east to (3,3) or west to (1,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (2,1), for example, he can go from (2,3) to (2,2) no, so he must go to (1,3) or (3,3), then to (1,2) or (3,1), etc.\n\nLet's list walkable tiles.\n\nEmpty tiles are all except the specified non-empty tiles.\n\nNon-empty tiles: dispensers, pots, counters with items or not? Counters are always non-walkable, I think, even if empty.\n\nTile types: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it's listed separately, so I think counters are non-walkable regardless of having item or not.\n\nSimilarly, dispensers and pots are not walkable.\n\nSo only empty tiles are walkable.\n\nFor example, (3,1) is empty, so walkable.\n\n(2,1) empty.\n\n(2,3) empty.\n\n(1,2) empty.\n\netc.\n\nTo go from (3,3) to a pot, say (3,0), Bob needs to go down to y=1 first.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move west to (2,3), then from (2,3) move south to (2,2)? No, (2,2) counter, not walkable. Move to (2,1) directly? Not adjacent, must move one step at a time.\n\nFrom (2,3), he can move south only to (2,2) if empty, not, so he can move south? No, because (2,2) not empty.\n\nHe can move east to (3,3) or west to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) should be empty.\n\nFrom (1,3), he can move south to (1,2)? (1,2) is empty, as not listed as counter.\n\n(1,2) not in kitchen counter list, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,2) he can move south to (1,1) or east to (2,2) no, or west to (0,2) but (0,2) is plate dispenser, not walkable.\n\nFrom (1,2), he can move east to (2,2)? No, not walkable. Move south to (1,1), then to (1,0) but (1,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he can go to (2,1) or something.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nThe grid has gaps. For example, from (3,3) to (3,1), he can go to (3,2) but not, so he must go around, like to (4,3) then to (4,2) no, to (4,3) then to (5,3) then to (5,2) no, to (5,3) then to (5,4)? (5,4) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nPerhaps he can go to (4,3) then move down to (4,2) no, or to (4,3) then to (4,4) but (4,4) dispenser not walkable.\n\nBetter to go to (2,3) or (4,3), then to (2,4) or (4,4) no, or to (1,3) as I said.\n\nFrom (3,3), move west to (2,3), then move west to (1,3), then from (1,3) move south to (1,2), then from (1,2) move east to (2,1)? Not adjacent; from (1,2) to (2,1) is diagonal, not allowed.\n\nFrom (1,2) he can move south to (1,1), then from (1,1) move east to (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) is empty.\n\nThen from (2,1) he can go to (3,1) etc.\n\nBut this is long.\n\nFrom (3,3) move east to (4,3), then move east to (5,3), then south to (5,2) no, to (5,3) then to (6,3) or (4,3).\n\n(6,3) should be empty.\n\nThen from (6,3) move south to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed, but (6,4) is counter, (6,0) counter, so (6,2) might be empty or not? Kitchen counters include (6,0) and (6,4), but not (6,2), so (6,2) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) not listed, empty.\n\nFrom (6,3) move south to (6,2), then to (6,1), then to (6,0) but (6,0) counter not walkable, so to (5,0) or (7,0) but both counters.\n\nTo reach pots, from (6,2) he can go to (5,2) no, or to (7,2) but (7,2) is serving counter, not walkable.\n\nSo the only access to pots is from above, (3,1) and (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is empty, I think.\n\nSo Bob needs to go to (3,1) or (4,1) to interact with pots.\n\nBut (3,1) might be occupied.\n\nSimilarly, Alice is there.\n\nFor now, let's have Bob get onions from the dispenser since he is close.\n\nAt t=16, Bob at (3,3) facing left.\n\nHe can change orientation to up (U) to face north, then interact (I) to grab an onion from (3,4) dispenser.\n\nThen he is holding an onion.\n\nThen he can go down to deliver to a pot.\n\nBut as above, it takes time to go down.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can get the onion from (2,2) quickly.\n\nThen they can both work on filling a pot.\n\nAlso, there is another onion at (6,4), but it's far.\n\nLet's plan for one soup first.\n\nSequence for Alice at t=16:\n\n- Move Left to (2,1), facing left. (action L)\n\nThen at (2,1), facing left, but need to face north to interact with (2,2).\n\nSo Change Orientation Up (U), facing up.\n\nThen Interact (I) to pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nNow she has onion.\n\nThen she can go to pot (3,0).\n\nFrom (2,1), move Right to (3,1), facing right.\n\nThen from (3,1), she is at (3,1), facing right. To interact with (3,0) south, she needs to face down.\n\nSo Change Orientation Down (D), facing down.\n\nThen Interact (I) to add onion to pot (3,0).\n\nNow pot (3,0) has one onion.\n\nAlice is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can get another onion.\n\nBob can do similar.\n\nFor Bob at t=16:\n\nHe is at (3,3) facing left.\n\nChange Orientation Up (U), facing up.\n\nThen Interact (I) to grab onion from (3,4) dispenser.\n\nNow he has onion.\n\nThen he needs to go to a pot.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move west to (2,3), facing west.\n\nThen from (2,3), move south to (2,2)? No, not possible. Move west to (1,3), facing west.\n\nThen from (1,3), move south to (1,2), facing south.\n\nThen from (1,2), move south to (1,1), facing south? Move D to (1,1), position (1,1), facing down.\n\nThen from (1,1), move east to (2,1), facing east.\n\nThen from (2,1), move east to (3,1), facing east.\n\nBut Alice might be at (3,1), so they might collide.\n\nPlayers cannot walk through each other, so if Alice is at (3,1), Bob cannot move there.\n\nAt this point, Alice might have moved away.\n\nLet's timeline the actions.\n\nTurn t=16:\n\nAlice actions: L (move left to (2,1), face left)\n\nBob actions: U (change orientation up, face up) or should he move? I need to specify both.\n\nThe task is to plan for Alice, and optionally for Bob. But to coordinate, I should suggest for both.\n\nThe answer format is for Alice only, I think, but it says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I can include Bob's actions for coordination.\n\nBut the output format shows only actions for Alice, like \"Turn t: a_t\" for Alice.\n\nLet's see the answer format: it shows \"Turn t: a_t\" for Alice, no mention of Bob.\n\nSo I think I need to plan only for Alice, assuming Bob will act reasonably, or based on history.\n\nAction history: Alice: R, D, R, I, I – most recent at end, so last action was I (interact), but at turn 15 or earlier.\n\nSimilarly Bob: U, I, L, L, L – last action L (move left or change orientation? Action history is actions taken, but not specified which type.\n\nBut for planning, I need to assume Bob's behavior.\n\nPerhaps I should plan Alice's actions to collaborate with Bob's likely actions.\n\nFrom history, Alice took R, D, R, I, I. She was at some position, moved right, down, right, then interact twice. Since she is at (3,1) now, and pots are below, she might have interacted with pot or something.\n\nBob took U, I, L, L, L. He was at (3,3), moved up? U could be move or orientation change.\n\nActions are from the list U,D,L,R,I,S.\n\nU could be move up or change orientation up, but in the context, it's the action taken.\n\nFor example, if he was at (3,3) and took U, if he moved up to (3,4) but can't, so likely he changed orientation or failed move.\n\nBut position is given, so at turn 16, he is at (3,3), so last actions didn't move him.\n\nBob's history: U, I, L, L, L – most recent L.\n\nIf he was at (3,3) and took L, if he moved left, to (2,3), but he is at (3,3), so perhaps he tried to move but couldn't, or changed orientation.\n\nSimilarly for Alice.\n\nBut current position is given, so for planning, we start from current state.\n\nTo simplify, let's focus on Alice and assume Bob will get onions from dispenser.\n\nAlice can get the onion from (2,2) and put in pot.\n\nThen she can get another onion.\n\nThere is another onion at (6,4), but far.\n\nOr she can go to dispenser.\n\nBut Bob is closer to dispenser.\n\nLet's have Alice work on the pot and plates, Bob on onions.\n\nFirst, for Alice at t=16:\n\nAction: L (move left to (2,1), face left)\n\nThen t=17: Change orientation to up (U), face up\n\nt=18: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nt=19: Move right to (3,1), face right\n\nt=20: Change orientation down (D), face down\n\nt=21: Interact (I) to add onion to pot (3,0)\n\nPot (3,0) now has one onion.\n\nAlice at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can get another onion. The closest is from dispenser or the other counter.\n\n(6,4) has onion, but far.\n\nOr she can go to (3,4) or (4,4), but Bob is there.\n\nBob can get onions.\n\nAssume Bob is getting onions.\n\nAt t=16, Bob at (3,3) facing left.\n\nIf he changes orientation to up (U), face up, then interact to grab onion.\n\nBut he needs to do that.\n\nFor coordination, I'll suggest Bob's actions too, but since output is for Alice, I'll plan Alice's actions and assume Bob will help.\n\nPerhaps Alice can go for plates after putting the onion.\n\nPlates are at (0,2).\n\nFrom (3,1), it's far.\n\nOr after the pot has three onions, we need a plate to serve.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so after adding third onion, 5 turns later it's ready.\n\nBut we need to add three onions first.\n\nLet's estimate.\n\nAfter Alice adds one onion at t=21, pot has one.\n\nBob can add more.\n\nBob at t=16: suppose he changes orientation to up (U), face up\n\nt=17: interact (I) grab onion from (3,4)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen he needs to go to pot.\n\nShortest path: from (3,3) move west to (2,3) (L), face left\n\nt=18: move west to (1,3) (L), face left? When he moves, he changes position and orientation.\n\nAt t=17 after interact, he is at (3,3) holding onion.\n\nt=18: move west to (2,3), face west\n\nt=19: move west to (1,3), face west\n\nt=20: move south to (1,2), face south (D)\n\nt=21: move south to (1,1), face south (D)\n\nt=22: move east to (2,1), face east (R)\n\nt=23: move east to (3,1), face east (R)\n\nBut at t=23, Alice might be there, and pot has one onion, but Bob can add his onion.\n\nAt t=21, Alice is adding onion, so at t=22, Alice is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nBob at t=23 arrives at (3,1), but Alice is there, so he can't move to (3,1) if occupied.\n\nPlayers cannot walk onto each other.\n\nSo when Bob tries to move to (3,1) at t=23, if Alice is there, he can't.\n\nConflict.\n\nAlice can move away.\n\nAfter t=21, Alice is at (3,1) after adding onion, she can move to (4,1) or something to let Bob access.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, pot needs three onions.\n\nWith one from Alice, Bob can bring one, but we need another.\n\nThere is onion at (6,4).\n\nOr another player can get it.\n\nBut only two players.\n\nAlice can get another onion after.\n\nBut time is passing.\n\nSince there are two pots, we can work on both.\n\nBut let's focus on one pot first to get a soup cooked quickly.\n\nAlice can put the onion, then go to get a plate while Bob gets more onions.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (0,2): need to go left and up.\n\nFor example, move west to (2,1), then to (1,1), then to (1,2), but (1,2) is empty, then from (1,2) she can interact with plate dispenser at (0,2)? (0,2) is plate dispenser, so to interact, she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nAdjacent to (0,2): east (1,2), south (0,1), but (0,1) is kitchen counter, non-walkable, north (0,3) kitchen counter, non-walkable, so only east (1,2) is adjacent empty tile.\n\nSo from (1,2), facing west, she can interact to grab plate.\n\nThen she can hold the plate and wait for soup to be cooked.\n\nBut cooking not started yet.\n\nFirst, let's have Alice add one onion to pot at t=21 as above.\n\nThen from t=22, she can go for plate.\n\nBut pot has only one onion, need two more.\n\nBob can add one soon, but it takes time.\n\nAt t=16, if Bob starts getting onion.\n\nt=16: Bob U (change orientation up, face up) – assume he does this.\n\nt=17: I (grab onion)\n\nt=18: L (move west to (2,3), face left)\n\nt=19: L (move west to (1,3), face left)\n\nt=20: D (move south to (1,2), face down)  -- to (1,2), facing down\n\nt=21: D (move south to (1,1), face down)\n\nt=22: R (move east to (2,1), face right)\n\nt=23: R (move east to (3,1), face right)\n\nAt t=23, he is at (3,1) holding onion.\n\nAt t=21, Alice is at (3,1) after adding onion, so at t=22, Alice can move to (4,1) to avoid conflict or to access other pot.\n\nFor example, at t=22: Alice move right to (4,1), face right\n\nThen at (4,1), she can face down to interact with pot (4,0) later.\n\nBut pot (4,0) is empty.\n\nAt t=23, Bob at (3,1) facing right, he can change orientation down (D) to face south, then interact to add onion to pot (3,0).\n\nPot (3,0) now has two onions.\n\nThen he needs another onion.\n\nSimilarly, Alice at (4,1) can do something.\n\nBut we need a third onion for pot (3,0).\n\nThere is onion at (6,4), or Bob can get another from dispenser.\n\nBut (6,4) is kitchen counter with onion, at (6,4).\n\nBob at (3,1) after adding onion at t=24, he is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nHe can go to (6,4) to get that onion, but it's far.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,4): move east to (4,1), then to (5,1), but (5,1) not listed, empty? Then to (6,1), then to (6,2), then to (6,3), then to (6,4) but (6,4) counter not walkable, so at (6,3) face north to interact with (6,4) counter.\n\nSimilarly, long way.\n\nAlice can get it.\n\nAlice at (4,1) at t=22.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), she can go to (6,4).\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nPerhaps it's better to use the onion on (6,4) for the pot.\n\nOr have one player focus on filling the pot, other on plates.\n\nBut cooking not started yet.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can get the onion from (6,4) while Bob handles the first pot.\n\nBut Alice is at (3,1) at t=21.\n\nAt t=21: Alice just added onion, at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nt=22: Alice move right to (4,1), face right\n\nt=23: from (4,1), she can move right to (5,1)? (5,1) should be empty, move R to (5,1), face right\n\nt=24: move right to (6,1), face right\n\nt=25: move up to (6,2)? (6,2) should be empty, move U to (6,2), face up\n\nt=26: move up to (6,3), face up\n\nt=27: at (6,3), change orientation north to face up, but she is facing up after move, so no need, then interact to pick up onion from (6,4) counter north.\n\nThen she has onion.\n\nThen she can take it to pot (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nFrom (6,3) to (3,1) is far.\n\nAt t=28: move south to (6,2), face down\n\nt=29: move south to (6,1), face down\n\nt=30: move west to (5,1), face left\n\nt=31: move west to (4,1), face left\n\nt=32: at (4,1), she can add to pot (4,0) or (3,0).\n\nBut pot (3,0) has two onions, so she can add to that.\n\nAt (4,1), she can face down to interact with (4,0) or move to (3,1).\n\nBut at t=32, Bob might be there.\n\nThis is taking too many turns, and the pot is not full yet.\n\nAt t=23, Bob added onion, pot has two at t=24.\n\nThen at t=24, Bob is at (3,1) holding nothing, he can go to dispenser to get another onion.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,4): move up to (3,2) no, so move left to (2,1), then to (2,2) no, to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (3,4) no, from (3,3) face north interact.\n\nShortest: from (3,1) move up to (3,2) not possible, so move left to (2,1), then to (2,2) no, move to (2,3) U from (2,1) to (2,2) no, so from (2,1) move up to (2,2) not possible, so only to (2,3) or (1,1), etc.\n\nFrom (3,1) move left to (2,1), face left\n\nt for Bob: at t=24 after adding, at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nt=25: move left to (2,1), face left\n\nt=26: move up to (2,2) not possible, so move west to (1,1)? From (2,1) move west to (1,1), face west\n\nt=27: move north to (1,2), face north? Move U to (1,2), position (1,2), face up\n\nt=28: move north to (1,3), face up\n\nt=29: move east to (2,3), face right? Move R to (2,3), face right\n\nt=30: move east to (3,3), face right\n\nt=31: at (3,3), change orientation up (U), face up\n\nt=32: interact (I) grab onion from dispenser\n\nThen he has onion, then go back to pot.\n\nt=33: move south? From (3,3) move down not possible, so move west to (2,3), face west\n\nt=34: move west to (1,3), face west\n\nt=35: move south to (1,2), face south\n\nt=36: move south to (1,1), face south\n\nt=37: move east to (2,1), face east\n\nt=38: move east to (3,1), face east\n\nt=39: change orientation down (D), face down\n\nt=40: interact add onion to pot.\n\nPot has three onions at t=40, then cooking starts, ready at t=45.\n\nThen serve.\n\nBut this is too slow, and we have only H turns to plan, but H is not specified, so perhaps for a few turns, but we need to start cooking.\n\nThere is a better way: use the onion on (6,4).\n\nAt t=16, Alice can go directly to (6,4) to get that onion.\n\nBut she is at (3,1), far.\n\nBob is closer to (6,4)? Bob at (3,3), (6,4) is at x=6,y=4.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (6,4): move east to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (6,3), then from (6,3) face north to interact with (6,4).\n\nSo Bob can do that faster.\n\nAt t=16 Bob: move east to (4,3), face right\n\nt=17: move east to (5,3), face right\n\nt=18: move east to (6,3), face right\n\nt=19: change orientation up (U), face up\n\nt=20: interact pick up onion from (6,4) counter\n\nThen he has onion, then go to pot.\n\nFrom (6,3) to (3,1): move west to (5,3), then to (4,3), then to (3,3), then to (2,3), etc., same as before, long.\n\nFrom (6,3) move south to (6,2), face down\n\nt=21: move south to (6,1), face down\n\nt=22: move west to (5,1), face left\n\nt=23: move west to (4,1), face left\n\nt=24: at (4,1), he can add to pot (4,0) or (3,0).\n\nBut at t=24, Alice might have put one onion in (3,0).\n\nBut let's assume Alice puts one onion in (3,0) at t=21 as before.\n\nThen Bob can add to (3,0) or start (4,0).\n\nBut (3,0) has one, so he can add to it.\n\nAt t=24, Bob at (4,1) with onion, he can move left to (3,1), but if Alice is there, conflict.\n\nAlice at t-21 at (3,1), after adding, she can move to (4,1) at t=22, so at t=24, she might be elsewhere.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate.\n\nPerhaps for the first soup, Alice can add one onion, then Bob adds one from the counter quickly, but he needs to get it.\n\nAnother idea: at t=16, Alice goes to (2,2) to get onion as before, puts in pot at t=21.\n\nThen at t=22, Alice moves to (4,1) to avoid conflict.\n\nThen Bob, who has been getting the (6,4) onion, arrives at (4,1) at t=24 with onion, he can add to pot (4,0) or (3,0).\n\nSay at t=24: Bob at (4,1) with onion, he can change orientation down (D), face down, then interact to add to pot (4,0).\n\nPot (4,0) has one onion.\n\nBut we want to fill one pot first.\n\nPot (3,0) has one from Alice, so Bob can add to it.\n\nAt t=24, Bob at (4,1), he can move left to (3,1) if empty, then add to (3,0).\n\nAt t=22 Alice moved to (4,1), so at t=23 she can move to (5,1) or something.\n\nLet's define Alice actions only for now.\n\nFor Alice, at t=16 to t=21: as before, get onion from (2,2) and put in pot (3,0) at t=21.\n\nThen at t=22: move right to (4,1), face right\n\nThen at t=23: she can move right to (5,1), face right\n\nt=24: move right to (6,1), face right\n\nt=25: move up to (6,2), face up\n\nt=26: move up to (6,3), face up\n\nt=27: change orientation up if not, but facing up, so interact (I) to pick up onion from (6,4) counter.\n\nThen she has onion.\n\nThen she can take it to pot (4,0) or (3,0).\n\nSay to (4,0).\n\nFrom (6,3) move south to (6,2), face down\n\nt=28: move south to (6,1), face down\n\nt=29: move west to (5,1), face left\n\nt=30: move west to (4,1), face left\n\nt=31: at (4,1), change orientation down (D), face down\n\nt=32: interact (I) to add onion to pot (4,0)\n\nNow pot (4,0) has one onion, but we have only two onions so far, and pot (3,0) has one.\n\nWe need to add more.\n\nBob can add another to (3,0).\n\nBut Bob might be adding one soon.\n\nAt t=16, if Bob gets onion from dispenser and adds to (3,0) around t=24, as earlier, then pot (3,0) has two at t=24, then Alice adds to (4,0) at t=32, but (4,0) has one, not full.\n\nThen we need a third onion for (3,0).\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nPerhaps Alice after putting the first onion, she goes to get a plate, while Bob fills the pot.\n\nBut with the onion on (6,4), it can be used.\n\nLet's assume that Bob will get onions from the dispenser and add to the pot.\n\nFor example, at t=16, Bob changes orientation to up, interacts to grab onion at t=17.\n\nThen he goes to the pot as before, arriving at t=23 at (3,1), adds onion at t=24, pot (3,0) has two if Alice added one at t=21.\n\nAt t=21 Alice added, so at t-21 pot has one, Bob adds at t=24, pot has two.\n\nThen at t=24, Bob is at (3,1) holding nothing, he can go back to get another onion, but it takes time.\n\nAlice at t=22 moved to (4,1), then she can go to the plate dispenser.\n\nPlate at (0,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (0,2): move west to (3,1), but occupied or not, to (2,1), then to (1,1), then to (1,2).\n\nFrom (1,2) she can grab plate from (0,2) dispenser.\n\nThen she can hold the plate for when soup is ready.\n\nBut soup not ready yet.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, but pot not full.\n\nAt t=24, pot (3,0) has two onions, need one more.\n\nIf Bob gets another onion, he can add at t=40 as before, then cooking starts at t=40, ready at t=45.\n\nThen Alice with plate can serve.\n\nBut she needs to be there.\n\nAlice at t=22: from (4,1) move west to (3,1), but at t=22 she is at (4,1), Bob at (3,3) or something.\n\nAt t=22, Alice at (4,1), move west to (3,1), but at t-23 Bob might be moving to (3,1), so conflict possible.\n\nTo avoid, Alice can go directly to (1,2) for plate.\n\nFrom (4,1) move west to (3,1), face left -- but if empty, at t=22: move left to (3,1), face left\n\nBut at t=21 Alice was at (3,1), moved to (4,1) at t=22, so at t=22 (3,1) is empty.\n\nt=22: Alice move left to (3,1), face left -- from (4,1) move left to (3,1), face left.\n\nThen t=23: move left to (2,1), face left\n\nt=24: move down? To (2,0) not possible, or to (1,1): from (2,1) move west to (1,1), face west\n\nt=25: move north to (1,2), face north? Move U to (1,2), position (1,2), face up\n\nt=26: at (1,2), change orientation west (L), face west, then interact (I) to grab plate from (0,2) dispenser.\n\nThen she has plate.\n\nThen she can wait near the pot for soup to be ready.\n\nBut cooking not started.\n\nWith Bob adding the third onion at t=40, ready at t=45.\n\nThen at t=45, Alice can serve if she is there.\n\nBut she is at (1,2) with plate, need to go to (3,0) to serve.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,0): move east to (2,2) no, so move south to (1,1), then east to (2,1), then east to (3,1), then face down to interact with pot (3,0).\n\nAt t=45: move south to (1,1), face south\n\nt=46: move east to (2,1), face east\n\nt=47: move east to (3,1), face east\n\nt=48: change orientation down (D), face down\n\nt=49: interact (I) to serve soup from pot (3,0), if cooked.\n\nAt t=40 cooking started, ready at t=45, so at t=45 it is ready, she can serve at t=49.\n\nBut reward at turn 49.\n\nThis is too slow, and we have only planned for one soup.\n\nThere must be a better way.\n\nSince there are two onion dispensers, and two players, they can work on different tasks.\n\nFor example, Alice can fill one pot, Bob fill the other, but ingredients are onions only.\n\nOr Alice can handle one pot, Bob the other.\n\nBut Alice is near pots, Bob near dispensers.\n\nAt t=16, Alice at (3,1), she can move to (4,1) and start with pot (4,0).\n\nBut similar.\n\nPerhaps they can use the existing onions on counters to save time.\n\nFor example, Alice gets (2,2) onion, puts in pot (3,0).\n\nBob gets (6,4) onion, puts in pot (4,0).\n\nThen both pots have one onion.\n\nThen Alice can get another onion from dispenser, Bob too.\n\nBut Alice is at (3,1) after putting, she can go to (3,4) to get onion, but far.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,4): move up not possible, so to (2,1), (2,3), (3,3), then interact with (3,4).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBob at (3,3) can get from dispenser easily.\n\nLet's define a plan for Alice only for the next few turns, say H=10 turns.\n\nThen at t=16 to t=26.\n\nAt t=16: Alice move L to (2,1), face left\n\nt=17: change orientation U, face up\n\nt=18: interact I, pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nt=19: move R to (3,1), face right\n\nt=20: change orientation D, face down\n\nt=21: interact I, add onion to pot (3,0)\n\nNow pot has one onion.\n\nThen t=22: move R to (4,1), face right\n\nt=23: change orientation D, face down\n\nt=24: interact I, but pot (4,0) is empty, so if she interacts, she might add nothing, or it does nothing? Interact with pot: if holding ingredient, add it; if holding plate, serve soup. But she is holding nothing, so interact might do nothing or not allowed.\n\nSo she should not interact yet.\n\nInstead, she can go to get another onion or plate.\n\nBut for H=10, up to t=26.\n\nt=22: move R to (4,1), face right\n\nt=23: move R to (5,1), face right\n\nt=24: move R to (6,1), face right\n\nt=25: move U to (6,2), face up\n\nt=26: move U to (6,3), face up\n\nThen at t=27 she can interact to get onion from (6,4).\n\nBut H=10 might be to t=26, so at t=26 she is at (6,3), facing up.\n\nThen she can continue.\n\nBut for the output, I need to list actions for Alice from t=16 to some t.\n\nSince the task says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\", but H not specified, so perhaps for a short sequence to start the process.\n\nPerhaps Alice can go for the plate directly after putting the onion.\n\nBut plate is at (0,2), far from (3,1).\n\nFrom t=21 at (3,1), t=22 move L to (2,1), face left\n\nt=23 move L to (1,1), face left\n\nt=24 move U to (1,2), face up\n\nt=25 at (1,2), change orientation L, face west\n\nt=26 interact I, grab plate from (0,2)\n\nThen she has plate.\n\nThen she can wait or go back.\n\nBut cooking not started, so she might need to drop the plate or something, but players can hold items.\n\nBut if she holds the plate, she can't get onions.\n\nSo better to have one player hold plate when soup is almost ready.\n\nSince cooking time is 5 turns, when the third onion is added, cooking starts, so she can be ready to serve after 5 turns.\n\nBut in this case, third onion at t=40, so she can get plate around t=26, then wait or do something else.\n\nBut she can only hold one item.\n\nSo after getting plate, she can stay or move near the serving area.\n\nServing counter is at (7,2), but soup is in pot, so to serve, she needs to take the soup from pot with plate.\n\nInteract with pot while holding plate to serve cooked soup.\n\nSo she needs to be at the pot with plate when soup is cooked.\n\nSimilarly, for delivery.\n\nSo for now, let's plan Alice's actions to get the plate.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 16: L (move left to (2,1), face left)\n\nTurn 17: U (change orientation up, face up)\n\nTurn 18: I (interact with (2,2) to pick up onion)\n\nTurn 19: R (move right to (3,1), face right)\n\nTurn 20: D (change orientation down, face down)\n\nTurn 21: I (interact with (3,0) to add onion)\n\nTurn 22: L (move left to (2,1), face left)\n\nTurn 23: D (move down? To (2,0) not possible, or to (1,1): from (2,1) move west to (1,1), face west)\n\nAction: from (2,1), move west to (1,1), which is L if facing west, but after turn 22, she is at (2,1) facing left (west), so move L to (1,1), face left.\n\nTurn 24: U (move up to (1,2), face up) -- to (1,2), facing up.\n\nThen at (1,2), facing up, but to interact with (0,2) west, she needs to face west.\n\nTurn 25: L (change orientation left, face west)\n\nTurn 26: I (interact with (0,2) to grab plate)\n\nThen she has plate.\n\nBob can work on filling the pot with two more onions.\n\nBut with this, the pot has only one onion, so Bob needs to add two.\n\nBut it will take time.\n\nPerhaps Alice can help with onions after getting the plate, but she is holding plate, so she can't.\n\nShe can place the plate on a counter for later.\n\nBut that might not be efficient.\n\nFor the sake of the task, I'll output this sequence for Alice for 11 turns, from t=16 to t=26.\n\nActions:\nTurn 16: L\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: I\nTurn 19: R\nTurn 20: D\nTurn 21: I\nTurn 22: L\nTurn 23: L  (from (2,1) to (1,1))\nTurn 24: U  ( to (1,2))\nTurn 25: L  (change orientation left)\nTurn 26: I  (grab plate)\n\nBut at turn 24, she moved U to (1,2), facing up.\n\nThen turn 25 L to change to face west.\n\nTurn 26 I to grab plate.\n\nYes.\n\nThen she can stay or move back.\n\nBut for the plan, I think this is a reasonable start.\n\nTo maximize reward, but with one pot having one onion, and Alice with plate, Bob can add onions.\n\nBut since we need to deliver soup, this sequence gets Alice ready with a plate when the soup is cooked later.\n\nSimilarly, for Bob, he can start filling the pot.\n\nBut for the answer, only Alice's actions.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob must coordinate to efficiently fill a pot with three onions, start cooking, and serve the cooked soup. Given the current state at turn 16:\n- Alice is at (3,1) facing right, holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (3,3) facing left, holding nothing.\n- Kitchen counter at (2,2) has an onion, and (6,4) has an onion, but both are far from the pots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n- Onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4), near Bob.\n- Plate dispenser is at (0,2), which Alice can access after contributing to the pot.\n\nThe optimal plan focuses on Alice retrieving the onion from (2,2) to add to pot (3,0), then moving to get a plate from (0,2) to prepare for serving. Bob, being closer to the onion dispensers, should handle gathering additional onions to fill the pot. Alice's actions for the next 11 turns (t=16 to t=26) are planned to:\n1. Pick up the onion from kitchen counter (2,2) quickly.\n2. Add it to pot (3,0) to start partial filling.\n3. Navigate to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to secure a plate for future serving.\n\nThis sequence ensures Alice is positioned to serve the soup once cooked (after 5 turns from when the pot has three onions), while Bob can efficiently gather and add the remaining onions. Alice's path avoids conflicts with Bob, who is expected to gather onions from the dispensers and add them to the pot.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 16: L**  \n  Move left to (2,1) and face left. This positions Alice to interact with the onion on (2,2).\n\n- **Turn 17: U**  \n  Change orientation to face up (north) without moving. This prepares Alice to interact with (2,2).\n\n- **Turn 18: I**  \n  Interact with (2,2) to pick up the onion. Alice is now holding an onion.\n\n- **Turn 19: R**  \n  Move right to (3,1) and face right. This moves Alice toward pot (3,0).\n\n- **Turn 20: D**  \n  Change orientation to face down (south) without moving. This prepares Alice to interact with pot (3,0).\n\n- **Turn 21: I**  \n  Interact with (3,0) to add the onion to the pot. Pot (3,0) now has one onion. Alice is now empty-handed.\n\n- **Turn 22: L**  \n  Move left to (2,1) and face left. This starts the path to the plate dispenser.\n\n- **Turn 23: L**  \n  Move left to (1,1) and face left. Continues movement west.\n\n- **Turn 24: U**  \n  Move up to (1,2) and face up. Alice is now adjacent to the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\n- **Turn 25: L**  \n  Change orientation to face left (west) without moving. This prepares Alice to interact with (0,2).\n\n- **Turn 26: I**  \n  Interact with (0,2) to grab a clean plate. Alice is now holding a plate and can later serve the soup.\n\n### Coordination with Bob:\n- Bob should use turns 16 onward to:\n  1. Change orientation to face up and interact with (3,4) to grab an onion.\n  2. Navigate to pot (3,0) and add the onion (arriving around turn 23–24, depending on path).\n  3. Repeat to gather a third onion and add it to the pot (around turn 30–40).\n- Once pot (3,0) has three onions (e.g., by turn 40), cooking starts and finishes at turn 45.\n- Alice, holding the plate, can then serve the soup from pot (3,0) around turn 45–50 for a reward of 20.\n\nThis plan maximizes efficiency by leveraging Alice's proximity to the existing onion and plate dispenser, while Bob handles onion gathering. The total reward is optimized by preparing for timely serving after cooking.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: L \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: I \\\\\nTurn 19: R \\\\\nTurn 20: D \\\\\nTurn 21: I \\\\\nTurn 22: L \\\\\nTurn 23: L \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: L \\\\\nTurn 26: I\n}",

We need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) for the next several turns to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current state:\n\n**Alice**:\n- Position: (3, 1)\n- Orientation: L (left, so facing (2,1))\n- Holding: nothing\n- Action History: I, R, D, I, L (most recent last: so the last action was L, which is a move left? But note that the position is (3,1) and orientation is L. The action history may include both moves and orientation changes. However, the position and orientation are given, so we can rely on that.)\n\n**Bob**:\n- Position: (5, 3)\n- Orientation: R (right, so facing (6,3))\n- Holding: one onion\n- Action History: L, U, I, R, R (most recent last: two R's? The last two actions were R and R. But note: the position is (5,3) and orientation R. So the last action R might have been a move to the right? But then position would be (6,3). However, the position is (5,3). So let me clarify:\n\nThe action history is for the passed several turns (at most 5). The most recent action is at the end. So Bob's history: \n- The last action was R (which could be a move or an orientation change). Since his position is (5,3) and he is facing R, it's possible that the last action was an orientation change to R without moving? Because if he moved R from (5,3) to (6,3), then he would be at (6,3). But he is at (5,3). So the last action R must be an orientation change? Similarly, the action before that was R (which might have been a move or orientation) and then I, U, L.\n\nGiven the constraints, we cannot walk through non-empty tiles. Also, note that changing orientation doesn't move.\n\nSo Bob's last action: R (orientation change to right) from some previous orientation? But his current orientation is R. So the last action set his orientation to R.\n\nSimilarly, Alice's last action was L. She is at (3,1) and facing L. So her last action might have been a move left from (4,1) to (3,1) and then changed orientation? Or it might have been an orientation change? But note: the action L in the history could be a move or an orientation change. However, her position is (3,1) and facing L. The action history: I, R, D, I, L. The last action L: if it was a move, then she moved left to (3,1). If it was an orientation change, then she was already at (3,1) and turned left.\n\nBut without knowing the previous state, we focus on the current state.\n\n**Non-empty Kitchen Counters**:\n- (2,2): contains an onion\n- (6,4): contains an onion\n\n**Pots**: both at (3,0) and (4,0) are empty.\n\n**Dispensers**:\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n\n**Serving counter**: (7,2)\n\n**Recipe**: Only one recipe is mentioned: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n\nGoal: We want to make and deliver as many onion soups as possible.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Bob is holding an onion. He is at (5,3) facing right (R). He can use that onion to put into a pot or place it on a counter.\n\n- Alice is at (3,1) facing left (L). She is holding nothing.\n\nThe pots are empty. We need to fill a pot with 3 onions and then cook it (which takes 5 turns) and then serve it.\n\nSteps for one soup:\n\n1. Collect 3 onions (from dispensers or counters) and put them into a pot.\n2. Wait 5 turns for cooking (the pot will automatically cook once 3 ingredients are added).\n3. Then, get a plate (from plate dispenser or counter) and use it to pick up the cooked soup from the pot.\n4. Deliver the soup to the serving counter (7,2).\n\nWe have two onions already on counters: one at (2,2) and one at (6,4). Also, Bob is holding one onion. So we have 3 onions already? But we need to get them into a pot.\n\nBut note: Bob is holding one onion, and there are two onions on counters. We also have onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) if we need more.\n\nHowever, we can use the existing onions to fill a pot.\n\nWhich pot? We have two pots: (3,0) and (4,0). They are adjacent? Actually, (3,0) and (4,0) are two separate pots. They are side by side.\n\nPlan:\n\nFirst, we need to get the onions into one of the pots. Since Alice is at (3,1) and the pot at (3,0) is directly below her, she is in a good position to start working on the pot at (3,0).\n\nBut note: Alice is facing left. To interact with the pot at (3,0), she must be adjacent and facing it. She is at (3,1) and the pot is at (3,0). So she is adjacent (above the pot). But she is facing left (towards (2,1)), not down. So she cannot interact with the pot until she faces down.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (5,3) with an onion. He can move to the pot at (4,0) or (3,0)? But he is at (5,3). How to get to the pot? The grid layout isn't fully described, but we know the tile types at specific coordinates.\n\nWe need to consider the layout. We have:\n\n- Kitchen counters at many positions, which are walkable? Actually, the tile types: empty tiles are walkable, but dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are non-empty? But note: the player can stand on an empty tile adjacent to these. So the grid must have empty tiles for movement.\n\nWe don't have a full grid, but we can infer from the positions.\n\nLet me sketch the grid:\n\nWe know:\n- Row y=0: kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0); pots at (3,0) and (4,0). So (3,0) and (4,0) are pots, and the rest are kitchen counters? But note: the kitchen counters are at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0). So the row y=0 is non-empty except possibly the pots? Actually, pots are also non-empty. So the entire row y=0 is non-empty? Then players cannot stand on y=0. They must be on adjacent tiles (y=1) to interact.\n\nSimilarly, row y=4: kitchen counters at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) and onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). So row y=4 is non-empty.\n\nRow y=1: kitchen counters at (0,1) and (7,1). The rest? We don't know. But Alice is at (3,1) so it must be an empty tile? Similarly, row y=2: plate dispenser at (0,2), kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2)? No, kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So row y=2: (0,2) is plate dispenser, (1,2) we don't know? But if it's not listed, it might be empty? Similarly, (6,2) and (7,2) we know (7,2) is serving counter. And (6,2) is not listed? So it might be empty.\n\nWe need to be cautious.\n\nBut for movement, we can only move on empty tiles. We know the positions of non-empty tiles.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\nAlice: (3,1) -> this is an empty tile? Because it's not listed in any non-empty type.\n\nBob: (5,3) -> not listed in non-empty, so empty.\n\nTo interact with the pot at (3,0), Alice must be at an adjacent empty tile and facing the pot. Adjacent tiles to (3,0): (3,1) (above), (2,0) (left) but (2,0) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) so cannot stand, (4,0) (right) is a pot (non-empty) so cannot stand, and (3,-1) doesn't exist. So the only adjacent empty tile is (3,1). So Alice must be at (3,1) and facing down to interact with the pot at (3,0).\n\nSimilarly, for the pot at (4,0): adjacent empty tiles: (4,1) (above), (3,0) and (5,0) are non-empty, so only (4,1). So a player must be at (4,1) and facing down.\n\nNow, Alice is at (3,1) and facing left. She needs to face down to interact with the pot (3,0).\n\nBob is at (5,3) with an onion. He can go to (4,1) to put his onion in the pot at (4,0)? But how? He is at (5,3). He must move to (4,1). The path: from (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1) to (4,1)? But we must check if those tiles are empty.\n\nWe know:\n- Row y=3: kitchen counters at (0,3) and (7,3). So (5,3) is empty? Yes. (5,2) is a kitchen counter? We have kitchen counter at (5,2) -> so (5,2) is non-empty. So Bob cannot move to (5,2). Then how can he get to (4,1)? Alternative path: (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> but (4,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, kitchen counter at (4,2). So non-empty. Then (4,1) is adjacent to (4,2) but (4,2) is non-empty so he cannot stand on (4,2). So he cannot go directly to (4,1) from above? Then how? He might need to go around.\n\nWe have a kitchen counter at (5,2) and (4,2) and (3,2) and (2,2). So row y=2 is blocked by counters? Then Bob must go around the counters. For example, go to (6,3) -> (6,2) is not listed? We have serving counter at (7,2) and kitchen counters at (5,2), (6,2) is not listed? Actually, we have kitchen counters at (5,2) and (6,2) is not in the list. But we have kitchen counter at (6,0) and (6,4). So (6,2) might be empty? Similarly, (6,1) and (6,3) might be empty.\n\nWe don't have a full grid. But we can assume that any tile not listed as non-empty is empty.\n\nSo for Bob at (5,3):\n- To the right: (6,3) -> not listed as non-empty, so empty? Then he can move right to (6,3).\n- Then from (6,3): down to (6,2)? (6,2) is not listed, so empty? Then move to (6,2). Then left to (5,2)? But (5,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so cannot. Then he must go down to (6,1)? (6,1) is not listed, so empty? Then to (6,1). Then left to (5,1)? (5,1) not listed -> empty. Then to (4,1)? (4,1) not listed -> empty. So that path: (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1). That's 5 moves? And then at (4,1) he must face down to interact with the pot at (4,0).\n\nBut that is a long path. Alternatively, he could go left to (4,3) -> (4,3) is not listed, so empty? Then from (4,3) down to (4,2)? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so he cannot go down to (4,2). Then he must go left to (3,3) -> (3,3) not listed -> empty. Then down to (3,2)? (3,2) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. Then to (3,1) but (3,1) is occupied by Alice? And then to (3,0) is non-empty. So no. So the only way is via (6,3) and then down to (6,2) and then to (6,1) and then to (5,1) and then to (4,1). That's 5 moves.\n\nBut we have an onion on the kitchen counter at (6,4). Bob is at (5,3). He could pick up that onion? But he is already holding one onion. He can only carry one at a time. So he cannot pick up another.\n\nAlternatively, he could place his onion on a counter and then go get another one? But we already have two onions on counters and one in hand, so we have three. So we don't need more.\n\nBut we need to get them to a pot.\n\nSince we have two pots, we can use both? But the recipe requires 3 onions per soup. We have three onions: one in Bob's hand, one at (2,2), and one at (6,4). We can use one pot for one soup.\n\nBut note: the pot at (3,0) is more accessible to Alice. Alice is at (3,1). She can start working on that pot.\n\nPlan for Alice and Bob:\n\nOption 1: Use the pot at (3,0). We need to put three onions into it.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Alice: currently at (3,1) facing left. She can turn to face down (D) to be ready to interact with the pot. But the action for changing orientation: we have to specify the orientation change. The action set: U, D, L, R, I, S. So to change orientation to down, she uses D? But note: the action D can be a move down or an orientation change? How do we specify?\n\nImportant: The action description says:\n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation. So if she moves down, she would go to (3,0) but (3,0) is a pot -> non-empty, so she cannot move there. So if she does D, it would try to move down? But the adjacent tile (3,0) is non-empty, so she cannot move. Then the action D in this context would be an orientation change? The problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But actually, the action set is the same for move and orientation change? The rule says: if the adjacent tile in the direction is not empty, then it becomes an orientation change. So:\n\n- If the player uses an action L/R/U/D and the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then the player moves and changes orientation to that direction.\n- If the adjacent tile is not empty, then the player only changes orientation to that direction.\n\nSo for Alice at (3,1) facing left. If she does D (down), then the adjacent tile below (3,0) is a pot -> non-empty, so she cannot move. Therefore, she changes her orientation to down.\n\nSo action: D (for Alice) -> now she is at (3,1) facing down.\n\n2. Now she is facing the pot. She can interact? But she is holding nothing. She cannot add an ingredient. So she needs to get an onion.\n\nWhere can she get an onion? There is an onion at (2,2). How to get to (2,2) from (3,1)? \n\nPath: (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2). But (2,1) is not listed as non-empty? So it's empty. Then (2,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) so she cannot stand on it. But she can stand on (2,1) or (1,2) or (3,2) but (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, non-empty. So to interact with (2,2), she must be adjacent and facing it. Adjacent tiles to (2,2): (2,1) (below), (2,3) (above), (1,2) (left), (3,2) (right). But (3,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter) so she cannot stand there. (2,3) is not listed? So empty? Then she can stand at (2,1) or (2,3) or (1,2).\n\nBut currently she is at (3,1). She can move left to (2,1) and then face up to interact with (2,2). But note: at (2,1), the counter (2,2) is above her, so she needs to face up.\n\nSo:\n\n- Alice: move left to (2,1) -> action L. Now at (2,1) and facing left? Because when she moves left, she changes orientation to left? But the rule: move changes position and orientation. So when she moves left, she becomes at (2,1) and facing left.\n\nBut to interact with (2,2) which is above, she must face up. So then she needs to change orientation to up (U). Then interact (I).\n\nBut she is holding nothing, so she can pick up the onion from the counter.\n\nSo steps for Alice:\n\nTurn 20: D (changes orientation to down, at (3,1) facing down) -> now she is facing the pot but cannot interact because she has nothing.\n\nTurn 21: L (moves left to (2,1) and faces left)\n\nTurn 22: U (changes orientation to up, because the tile above (2,2) is non-empty? (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so non-empty. So if she does U, she cannot move up (because (2,2) is non-empty) so she only changes orientation to up.\n\nNow at (2,1) facing up.\n\nTurn 23: I (interact with (2,2) which is above her) -> picks up the onion.\n\nNow Alice is holding an onion.\n\nThen she needs to go back to the pot at (3,0). So from (2,1) to (3,1) and then put the onion in the pot.\n\nTurn 24: R (moves right to (3,1) and faces right)\n\nBut now she is at (3,1) and the pot is at (3,0) below her. But she is facing right. So she must face down.\n\nTurn 25: D (changes orientation to down, because (3,0) is non-empty -> so only orientation change to down)\n\nTurn 26: I (interact) -> puts the onion into the pot at (3,0). Now the pot has one onion.\n\nBut we need two more onions.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is at (5,3) with an onion. He can go to the pot at (3,0) or (4,0). But the pot at (3,0) is being used. He can use the other pot? Or he can contribute to the same pot.\n\nBut we want to make one soup quickly. So let's use the same pot.\n\nHow can Bob get to (3,0)? He must be at (3,1) and face down. But (3,1) is occupied by Alice? Not always. We must coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to (4,1) and put his onion in the pot at (4,0). Then we have two pots with one onion each? But that would require two more onions for each pot. We only have one onion left (at (6,4)). So that might not be efficient.\n\nBetter to put all three onions in one pot.\n\nSo Bob should bring his onion to the pot at (3,0). But he is at (5,3). How to get to (3,1)? The path: (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) is non-empty? (3,2) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. So he cannot go down at (3,3). Then he must go (5,3) -> (5,2) is non-empty? (5,2) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. So he must go around: (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1). That's 6 moves. And then at (3,1) he must face down to interact.\n\nBut note: Alice might be at (3,1) at some point? We must avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can place his onion on a counter near the pot? For example, the kitchen counter at (2,0) is non-empty? Actually, we have kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), etc. But (2,0) is adjacent to the pot? The pot is at (3,0). The kitchen counter at (2,0) is adjacent? But (2,0) is a kitchen counter, so we can place items on it. But Bob is at (5,3). How to get to (2,0)? It's far.\n\nThere is a kitchen counter at (0,1) and (7,1) and (2,2) (which we already used) and (5,2) and (6,4). The closest counter to the pot might be (2,0) but that is non-empty? We don't know if it's occupied. The non-empty kitchen counters we know: (2,2) has an onion (which Alice will take) and (6,4) has an onion. And others? The problem says: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" lists (2,2) and (6,4) as having an onion. So the other kitchen counters are empty? Then Bob can place his onion on a counter near the pot.\n\nFor example, the kitchen counter at (0,0) is non-empty? The list of non-empty ones only mentions (2,2) and (6,4). So others are empty? Then he can use (1,0) or (0,1) or (7,0) etc. But which one is accessible and close to the pot?\n\nThe pot at (3,0): adjacent empty tile is (3,1). The kitchen counters adjacent to (3,1)? The tile (3,1) is adjacent to: (3,0) (pot), (2,1), (4,1), (3,2) (kitchen counter). But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and it is empty? Because the non-empty ones are only (2,2) and (6,4). So (3,2) is empty. So Bob can place his onion on (3,2)? But (3,2) is adjacent to (3,1) and (3,3) and (2,2) and (4,2). So if Bob goes to (3,3) and faces down, he can interact with (3,2)? But (3,2) is below (3,3). So he must be at (3,3) and facing down to interact with (3,2). But (3,3) is empty? We assume so.\n\nSo Bob can:\n\n- Move to (3,3): from (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3). That's two moves.\n\n- Then face down (D) to change orientation to down (because (3,2) is non-empty? Actually, (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so when he does D at (3,3), he cannot move down, so he changes orientation to down.\n\n- Then interact (I): since he is holding an onion and the counter (3,2) is empty, he places the onion on (3,2).\n\nThen Alice, who will be at (3,1) at some point, can pick it up easily? Because (3,2) is adjacent to (3,1) and (3,3). So if Alice is at (3,1) and facing up, she can interact with (3,2).\n\nBut note: Alice will be at (3,1) after she puts her first onion in the pot (at turn 26). Then she can turn up to face (3,2) and pick up the onion that Bob placed.\n\nThen she puts that onion in the pot. Then we need one more onion.\n\nWe have one onion left at (6,4). Bob, after placing his onion at (3,2), can go get that onion and bring it? But it's far.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go get the onion from (6,4) and bring it to the pot? But that would take time.\n\nBut we have an onion at (6,4). How to get it? Bob is free after placing his onion at (3,2). He can go to (6,4) and pick it up.\n\nBut (6,4) is a kitchen counter with an onion. Bob must be adjacent and facing it to pick it up.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (6,4): (6,3), (6,5) (out of bound?), (5,4), (7,4). We have kitchen counters at (5,4) and (7,4) -> non-empty. So the only adjacent empty tile is (6,3). So Bob must be at (6,3) and facing up to interact with (6,4).\n\nBob's path after placing the onion at (3,2):\n\nHe is at (3,3). He can go to (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (6,3). Then at (6,3) he must face up (U) to interact with (6,4) and pick up the onion. Then he must bring it back to the pot area. He can place it on (3,2) again? Or directly to the pot? But the pot at (3,0) requires him to be at (3,1) and face down. But (3,1) might be occupied by Alice.\n\nAlternatively, he can go to (3,1) when Alice is not there? But we need to coordinate.\n\nMeanwhile, after Alice puts the second onion (the one from Bob that was on (3,2)) into the pot, the pot will have two onions. Then she needs the third onion.\n\nSo Bob should bring the third onion to (3,2) again? Then Alice picks it up and puts it in the pot.\n\nSo let's outline the sequence:\n\nAt turn 20:\n\nAlice: D (change orientation to down at (3,1)) \nBob: ? We can control Bob? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for Bob too? It says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", meaning we can provide actions for both? But the answer format only shows one action per turn? But it says \"for Alice\" and then \"optionally Bob\", so I think we have to specify for Alice and if we want to coordinate with Bob, we must also specify Bob's actions? But the answer format is one line per turn with an action? How to specify for both?\n\nLooking at the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nIt only shows one action per turn. But the problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So it might be ambiguous. But the context: we are to plan for Alice. And Bob is the teammate, but we are not controlling Bob? Or we are? The problem says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we might need to assume Bob is controlled by another agent? But then we cannot plan Bob's actions? However, the task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\".\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think we should only plan for Alice, but we can assume that Bob will act in a coordinated way? Or we can plan for both? But the answer format doesn't support two actions per turn.\n\nRe-reading: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". And the answer format is per turn, with one action. So it must be that we are only planning Alice's actions? Or we are to output a joint action? But the format doesn't say.\n\nLooking at the example: the current state shows action history for both separately. But the answer format only has one action per turn. So I think we are only to plan Alice's actions. And Bob will be controlled by his own agent? But then we cannot control Bob. So we must plan Alice's actions assuming Bob will act reasonably? But the problem says \"optimize coordination\", so we need to anticipate Bob's actions.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think we must plan for Alice and suggest or assume Bob's actions for coordination.\n\nBut the output format only has one action per turn for Alice? The action notation is the same as in the history, which was per player. So the answer format might be only for Alice.\n\nThe task: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice\"\n\nSo I think we only output Alice's actions.\n\nThen we must plan Alice's actions and hope that Bob will coordinate.\n\nBut we can use the existing onions and Bob's current onion to fill the pot.\n\nBob is holding an onion. He is at (5,3). He can move towards the pot. But we don't control him. However, in the plan, Alice can do her part and then Bob might naturally come to help? But it's uncertain.\n\nTo maximize the chance, Alice should focus on the pot at (3,0) and use the onion at (2,2) and then the onion at (6,4) might be picked up by Bob or Alice.\n\nBut Alice can only carry one item at a time.\n\nAlternative plan for Alice:\n\n1. Turn 20: D (change orientation to down at (3,1)) -> now facing the pot.\n2. But she has nothing, so she cannot interact. She needs to get an onion.\n3. The closest onion is at (2,2). So she goes to (2,2) to pick it up.\n\nAs before: \nTurn 20: D (orientation down)\nTurn 21: L (move left to (2,1), facing left)\nTurn 22: U (orientation up, because cannot move up to (2,2))\nTurn 23: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\n4. Then she returns to (3,1):\nTurn 24: R (move right to (3,1), facing right)\nTurn 25: D (orientation down)\nTurn 26: I (put onion in pot at (3,0)) -> now pot has 1 onion.\n\n5. Now she needs more onions. The next closest onion is at (6,4). But it's far. Or the one on (6,4) and also Bob has one.\n\nBut Bob has one and he might bring it. So Alice can wait? Or she can go to the kitchen counter at (3,2) and see if Bob places his onion there.\n\nBut we don't control Bob.\n\nAnother onion source: the onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). But (3,4) is an onion dispenser. Alice can get an onion from there.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can go down? But y=0 is blocked. She must go up.\n\nPath to (3,4): (3,1) -> (3,2) is non-empty -> cannot. So she must go around: (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) is non-empty -> cannot. So she must go (3,1) -> (3,0) is non-empty -> cannot. This is a problem.\n\nHow to get to (3,4) from (3,1)? The row y=2 is blocked by kitchen counters from x=2 to x=5. So she must go via y=3.\n\nFrom (3,1) -> (3,2) blocked. So move right to (4,1) -> (4,1) is empty? Assume yes. Then (4,1) -> (4,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. Then move to (4,0) is non-empty. So she must go up to (4,3)? (4,3) is empty? Then to (4,4) is onion dispenser -> non-empty, so cannot stand. But she can interact from (4,3) if facing down.\n\nSo:\n\n- Turn 26: after putting the onion, she is at (3,1) facing down? No, after interacting, she is still at (3,1) facing down.\n- Turn 27: R (move right to (4,1), facing right)\n- Turn 28: U (change orientation to up? But the tile above (4,2) is non-empty, so she changes orientation to up. But she needs to go to (4,3). So she should move up? But to move up, she must be able to go to (4,2) -> non-empty, so she cannot move up. So she must change orientation to up without moving? Then she is facing up at (4,1).\n\n- Then she cannot move up. She must go to (5,1) first? (5,1) is empty? Assume yes. Then from (4,1) move right to (5,1) -> action R. Then at (5,1) facing right.\n\n- Then from (5,1) move up to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot. So she must go to (5,0) non-empty. So she is stuck at (5,1). Then she can move to (6,1) -> (6,1) empty. Then to (6,2) empty. Then to (6,3) empty. Then to (6,4) is non-empty, so from (6,3) she can face up to interact with (6,4) to pick up the onion there.\n\nBut that is a long path: from (3,1) to (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) then interact. That's 5 moves to (6,3) and then orientation and interact.\n\nThen she must bring it back to the pot. Another 5+ moves.\n\nThis is not efficient.\n\nSince Bob has an onion and is at (5,3), he might be closer to the pot at (4,0) or (3,0). But he is at (5,3), and the only accessible pot is via (4,1) for (4,0) or (3,1) for (3,0). But (3,1) is occupied by Alice initially.\n\nPerhaps the best is to assume that Bob will bring his onion to the pot at (3,0) by the time Alice has placed her onion.\n\nFor example, if Bob starts moving immediately to (3,1), it will take him 6 moves as previously calculated, but during turns 20-26, Alice is busy getting and placing the first onion. At turn 26, she has placed the first onion and is at (3,1) facing down.\n\nIf Bob is moving during turns 20-25, he might arrive at (3,1) at turn 26? But then they would collide.\n\nTurn 20:\nAlice: D (at (3,1) facing down)\nBob: say, he moves right to (6,3) -> action R.\n\nTurn 21:\nAlice: L to (2,1)\nBob: move down to (6,2) -> action D.\n\nTurn 22:\nAlice: U (orientation up at (2,1))\nBob: move down to (6,1) -> action D.\n\nTurn 23:\nAlice: I (picks up onion at (2,2))\nBob: move left to (5,1) -> action L.\n\nTurn 24:\nAlice: R to (3,1) (facing right)\nBob: move left to (4,1) -> action L.\n\nTurn 25:\nAlice: D (orientation down at (3,1))\nBob: move left to (3,1) -> but (3,1) is occupied by Alice? So he cannot move there. He must wait or change.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTo avoid, Alice should vacate (3,1) after placing the onion.\n\nAfter Alice places the onion at turn 26, she can move away to let Bob use the spot.\n\nFor example, after turn 26: Alice is at (3,1) facing down. She can move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\nThen Bob can come to (3,1) and face down and put his onion.\n\nThen the pot will have two onions.\n\nThen Alice can get the third onion from (6,4) or from a dispenser.\n\nBut getting from (6,4) is far.\n\nThere is an onion at (6,4), so Bob, after placing his onion, can go get it? But then Alice would have to put it in the pot.\n\nThis is complex.\n\nGiven the time constraints, let's plan for Alice to do as much as possible.\n\nSimpler plan: Alice focuses on the pot at (3,0) and uses the onion at (2,2) and then if Bob doesn't come, she goes to get an onion from the dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4), but as we saw, it's hard to reach.\n\nBut wait, the onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). How to access them?\n\nFor (3,4): adjacent empty tile must be (3,3) or (2,4) or (4,4) non-empty, or (3,5) out of bound. So only (3,3) and (2,4), (4,4) is non-empty, (2,4) is kitchen counter? We have kitchen counter at (2,4) -> non-empty. So only (3,3) is empty and adjacent. So a player must be at (3,3) and facing down to interact with (3,4).\n\nSimilarly for (4,4): only (4,3) is empty and adjacent.\n\nAlice at (3,1) can go to (3,3):\n\n- (3,1) -> (3,2) is non-empty, cannot. So she must go via (4,1) -> (4,2) non-empty, cannot. So she must go to (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) non-empty, cannot. So she must go to (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3). That's many moves.\n\nThis is not efficient.\n\nPerhaps the best is to use the onion on (6,4) for the third onion.\n\nAlice can go to (6,4) after placing the first onion.\n\nFrom (3,1) after turn 26: \n- Turn 27: R to (4,1) (facing right)\n- Turn 28: R to (5,1) (facing right) -> but (5,1) is empty? Assume yes.\n- Turn 29: R to (6,1) (facing right)\n- Turn 30: U to (6,2) (facing up? Because move up would be to (6,2) but (6,2) is empty? So she moves to (6,2) and faces up.\n- Turn 31: U to (6,3) (facing up) -> moves to (6,3) and faces up.\n- Turn 32: U orientation change? The tile above (6,4) is out of bound? Or (6,4) is at y=4, so above it is (6,5) which doesn't exist. So to interact with (6,4) from (6,3), she must face up. So action U: but (6,4) is above, non-empty, so she changes orientation to up.\n- Turn 33: I (interact) -> picks up the onion from (6,4).\n\nThen she has the onion. She needs to return to the pot at (3,0).\n\nPath back:\n- (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1). Then face down and interact.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 34: D (move down to (6,2), facing down)\n- Turn 35: D (move down to (6,1), facing down)\n- Turn 36: L (move left to (5,1), facing left)\n- Turn 37: L (move left to (4,1), facing left)\n- Turn 38: L (move left to (3,1), facing left)\n- Turn 39: D (change orientation to down, because (3,0) non-empty)\n- Turn 40: I (put onion in pot)\n\nThen the pot has two onions (one from her first trip, and this one). And Bob's onion is missing? We don't know.\n\nBut if Bob has put his onion in the pot during this time, then the pot would have three onions and start cooking.\n\nBut since we don't control Bob, we assume that he might have put it.\n\nAt least, with Alice's actions, we have two onions in the pot.\n\nThen we need one more.\n\nBut Bob might have delivered his onion or not.\n\nTo complete the soup, we need three onions.\n\nSo after turn 40, the pot has two onions. Alice can then get another onion from the dispenser.\n\nThe closest dispenser is at (3,4) or (4,4). From (3,1), she can go to (3,3) to access (3,4).\n\nBut how to get to (3,3) from (3,1)? (3,2) is blocked. So she must go around: (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,3) via (4,2) is blocked, so (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3).\n\nThat's many moves.\n\n (3,1) to (4,1) to (4,3) cannot because (4,2) blocked. So (4,1) to (5,1) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3).\n\nSo:\n- Turn 41: R to (4,1) (facing right)\n- Turn 42: U orientation change? Or move up? Cannot move up. So U to change orientation up.\n- Then she needs to move to (5,1): action R at turn 43.\n- Then from (5,1) to (5,2) blocked, so to (5,3): action U at turn 44? But (5,1) to (5,2) blocked, so she must move right to (6,1) then up to (6,2) then (6,3) then left to (5,3) etc. This is taking too many turns.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since we are at turn 20 and the cooking takes 5 turns, we want to get the soup cooking as soon as possible.\n\nPerhaps a better initial plan: Alice, instead of going for the onion at (2,2), she can go to (3,3) and face down to interact with the kitchen counter at (3,2) to see if it's empty or not. But currently, (3,2) is empty (not listed as non-empty). So she can't pick up anything from it.\n\nI think the most efficient is to assume that Bob will bring his onion to the pot. So Alice should focus on the pot and let Bob contribute.\n\nAlice's actions:\n\nTurn 20: D (change orientation to down at (3,1) to face the pot)\nThen she can wait for Bob to come and put his onion? But she can't do anything while waiting.\n\nThen when Bob comes, she moves away.\n\nBut we must output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for the first few turns, Alice does nothing but change orientation to be ready.\n\nBut that wastes turns.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate, but the soup is not ready yet.\n\nToo early.\n\nGiven the constraints, let's plan for Alice to get the onion from (2,2) and put it in the pot, then move to (2,1) or (4,1) to let Bob use (3,1), then after Bob puts his onion, she can put the third onion if she can get it.\n\nBut to get the third onion, it's far.\n\nPerhaps after the first onion, she goes to (3,3) to get an onion from the dispenser at (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,3): not direct. She must go to (4,1) -> (4,3) via (4,2) blocked, so to (5,1) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3).\n\nLong.\n\nI think the best is to do the first part and then assume Bob will do his part.\n\nSo for Alice, for the next 7 turns (H=7? But the planning horizon is not specified, so let's do as many as reasonable.\n\nAlice's actions for turns 20 to 26:\n\nTurn 20: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 21: L (move left to (2,1), facing left)\nTurn 22: U (change orientation to up, to face the counter at (2,2))\nTurn 23: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\nTurn 24: R (move right to (3,1), facing right)\nTurn 25: D (change orientation to down, to face the pot)\nTurn 26: I ( put onion in the pot at (3,0))\n\nNow the pot has one onion.\n\nThen she can move away to let Bob use the spot.\n\nTurn 27: L ( move left to (2,1), facing left) or R to (4,1) to avoid blocking.\n\nSay turn 27: L to (2,1) facing left.\n\nThen if Bob comes to (3,1) and puts his onion, the pot will have two.\n\nThen Alice can try to get the third onion from (6,4) or from a dispenser.\n\nBut for now, we output up to turn 26 or 27.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify H, so we can output a sequence until she delivers the soup, but that will be many turns.\n\nPerhaps we can output until she places the first onion.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we need to complete the soup.\n\nGiven the complexity and the instructions, I think for this response, I'll output Alice's actions for the next 7 turns (turns 20 to 26) as above.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 20: D\nTurn 21: L\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: I\nTurn 24: R\nTurn 25: D\nTurn 26: I\n\nThen at turn 26, the pot has one onion.\n\nAfter that, she can for example move to (2,1) on turn 27: L\n\nBut since the horizon is not specified, we can stop at turn 26.\n\nBut let's see if we can do more.\n\nAfter turn 26, she is at (3,1) facing down. She can move to (2,1) on turn 27: L.\n\nThen at (2,1) facing left. She can then wait or go to (1,1) if available, but not necessary.\n\nTo get the third onion, if Bob doesn't come, she can go to (6,4) as previously described, but it will take many turns.\n\nPerhaps she can go to the onion dispenser at (3,4) via (3,3).\n\nFrom (2,1) on turn 27, she can move to (2,0) is non-empty, cannot. So move to (2,2) is non-empty, cannot. So move to (1,1) if empty.\n\nAssume (1,1) is empty (not listed as non-empty).\n\nTurn 27: from (2,1) move left to (1,1), facing left.\nThen from (1,1) to (1,2)? (1,2) not listed, assume empty.\nTurn 28: U (move up to (1,2), facing up)\nThen from (1,2) to (1,3)? (1,3) empty.\nTurn 29: U to (1,3), facing up.\nThen to (1,4) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot. So she must go right to (2,3) -> (2,3) empty.\nTurn 30: R to (2,3), facing right.\nThen to (3,3) empty.\nTurn 31: R to (3,3), facing right.\nThen at (3,3), she can face down to interact with the onion dispenser at (3,4) below.\nTurn 32: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 33: I (grab an onion from the dispenser)\n\nThen she has an onion. She needs to return to the pot.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,1): cannot go directly because (3,2) blocked. So go to (4,3) -> (4,2) blocked, so to (5,3) -> (5,2) blocked, etc. Long way.\n\nSo not efficient.\n\nGiven the time, I think the initial 7 turns are reasonable.\n\nSo I'll box the sequence for turns 20 to 26.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice should focus on collecting an onion from the kitchen counter at (2, 2) and delivering it to the pot at (3, 0) to initiate the cooking process for an onion soup (which requires 3 onions). This leverages her current position (3, 1) and proximity to the onion at (2, 2) and the pot. Bob, holding an onion, is expected to independently contribute by delivering his onion to the same pot or a nearby counter for Alice to use later, ensuring coordination for efficient soup completion. However, this plan only specifies Alice's actions to avoid overcomplicating the sequence, assuming Bob will act rationally based on his state (e.g., moving toward the pot or counters).\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (Turns 20 to 26):\n- **Turn 20 (t₁ = 20)**: Alice changes orientation to down (`D`) to face the pot at (3, 0), preparing for future interaction. She cannot interact yet as she holds nothing.\n- **Turn 21**: Alice moves left (`L`) to (2, 1), now facing left, positioning herself adjacent to the kitchen counter at (2, 2).\n- **Turn 22**: Alice changes orientation to up (`U`) to face the kitchen counter at (2, 2), as moving up is blocked by the counter.\n- **Turn 23**: Alice interacts (`I`) to pick up the onion from (2, 2). She is now holding an onion.\n- **Turn 24**: Alice moves right (`R`) to (3, 1), now facing right, returning to the tile adjacent to the pot.\n- **Turn 25**: Alice changes orientation to down (`D`) to face the pot at (3, 0), as moving down is blocked.\n- **Turn 26**: Alice interacts (`I`) to place the onion into the pot at (3, 0). The pot now contains 1 onion.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Efficiency**: This minimizes movement by using the closest available onion (at (2, 2)) and leverages Alice's starting position. The sequence takes 7 turns to deliver the first onion, setting up the pot for Bob's onion (already in hand) and the remaining onion at (6, 4) to complete the soup.\n- **Coordination with Bob**: Bob, at (5, 3) holding an onion, is expected to move toward the pot at (3, 0) or place his onion on a nearby counter (e.g., (3, 2)) during this time. Alice vacates (3, 1) after Turn 26 to avoid blocking Bob. Once the pot has 3 onions, it cooks in 5 turns, after which either player can serve it using a plate from (0, 2).\n- **Reward Optimization**: Completing one onion soup yields 20 points. This sequence initiates the cooking process quickly, allowing parallel actions (e.g., Bob fetching the third onion or a plate) to maximize deliveries within the time limit.\n\n### Next Steps (Beyond Turn 26):\n- Alice should move away from (3, 1) (e.g., to (2, 1) or (4, 1)) to let Bob access the pot. If the pot is not filled by Bob, Alice can fetch the onion from (6, 4) or an onion dispenser, though this is less efficient. Once the soup is cooked, Alice or Bob should grab a plate from (0, 2) and serve it at (7, 2).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ I}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 23 (t1=23). We need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob, but the task is to plan for Alice) for the next several turns to maximize the total reward from delivered soup.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current state:\n\n### Environment:\n- **Kitchen Counters** (for temporary storage): \n  - (2,2): has an onion\n  - (6,4): has an onion\n- **Onion Dispensers**: at (3,4) and (4,4)\n- **Plate Dispenser**: at (0,2)\n- **Pots**: at (3,0) and (4,0) - both empty\n- **Serving Counter**: at (7,2)\n\n### Players:\n- **Alice** (us): \n  - Position: (3,1)\n  - Orientation: D (down, so facing (3,0))\n  - Holding: nothing\n  - Action History: I, L, U, I, D (most recent is D, meaning she moved down to (3,1) from (3,2)? Let's reconstruct)\n\nReconstructing Alice's recent moves (from history: I, L, U, I, D):\n- We don't have the exact starting point, but we know she is at (3,1) at turn 23.\n- The actions are in order: first I, then L, then U, then I, then D.\n\nSimilarly, Bob:\n- Position: (6,1)\n- Orientation: D (facing (6,0))\n- Holding: one onion\n- Action History: R, R, R, D, D\n\n### Goal:\nWe want to make and serve soup. The only recipe we know is:\n- Recipe 1: 3 onions -> reward 20, cooking time 5 turns.\n\nSince we have two pots, we can cook two soups. However, we have limited ingredients.\n\n### Current Ingredients:\n- Bob is holding one onion.\n- Kitchen counters have two onions: one at (2,2) and one at (6,4).\n\nSo we have a total of 3 onions (one with Bob, two on counters). We can make one full soup of 3 onions.\n\nBut note: there are onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) so we can get more onions.\n\n### Planning:\nWe need to coordinate to get 3 onions into a pot and then serve the soup after cooking.\n\nSteps for one soup:\n1. Get three onions into a pot (say at (3,0) or (4,0)).\n2. Wait for the pot to cook (5 turns).\n3. Get a plate and serve the soup.\n\nBut we have two players and we can do things in parallel.\n\n### Analysis of current positions:\n\nAlice at (3,1) facing down (so facing (3,0)):\n- (3,0) is a pot and is adjacent and in front of her. She can interact with the pot. But the pot is empty. Since she is holding nothing, she cannot add an ingredient. She could serve if there was cooked soup? But there isn't.\n\nBob at (6,1) holding an onion, facing down (so facing (6,0)). (6,0) is a kitchen counter? Let's check the tile types: \n- Kitchen counters are at: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), ... so (6,0) is a kitchen counter.\n\nBob is facing (6,0) which is a kitchen counter. He can place the onion there? But we don't necessarily want to. We want to put onions in a pot.\n\n### Immediate actions:\n\nWe are at turn 23. We need to plan for Alice.\n\nWhat can Alice do?\n- She is at (3,1) facing down (towards (3,0) which is a pot). She can:\n  - Interact (I): but she is holding nothing and the pot is empty -> nothing happens? (The interact action for pot when holding nothing and pot is empty does nothing? The rules say: for pot, interact can add ingredient if holding one and pot not full, or serve if holding plate and pot has cooked soup. Otherwise, probably nothing.)\n\nSo if she interacts now, it does nothing.\n\nAlternatively, she can move. Since she is at (3,1), the adjacent tiles are:\n- Up: (3,2) -> what is (3,2)? From the tile list: (3,2) is a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters include (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (3,2) is a kitchen counter. But we don't know if it has an item? The non-empty kitchen counters are only (2,2) and (6,4). So (3,2) is empty.\n\nShe can move up to (3,2) and then she would be on the kitchen counter? But note: players can only stand on empty tiles. The kitchen counter is a non-empty tile? Actually, the tile types are distinct. The \"Kitchen Counter\" is a tile type that is non-empty? But the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and \"Empty Tile\" is walkable. The Kitchen Counter is a tile type that is not empty? Actually, the tile types are:\n\n- Empty Tile: walkable.\n- Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter: non-empty? But note: the rule says \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and the Kitchen Counter is listed as a tile type. So we cannot walk on it? But then how do we interact? We must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nSo the grid has tiles that are either empty (walkable) or objects (non-empty, not walkable). So:\n\n- Alice is at (3,1) which is an empty tile? Because it's not listed in any of the non-empty tiles. Similarly, (3,2) is a kitchen counter, so non-empty -> cannot walk on it.\n\nTherefore, Alice cannot move up to (3,2). Similarly, the adjacent tiles:\n\n- Down: (3,0) is a pot -> non-empty -> cannot walk.\n- Left: (2,1) -> not listed in any non-empty, so empty? Let's check the non-empty tiles: the kitchen counters are at the positions listed. (2,1) is not in the list, so it is empty and walkable.\n- Right: (4,1) -> not listed -> empty.\n- Up: (3,2) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot walk.\n\nSo Alice can only move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\nWhat about changing orientation? She can change orientation without moving, but only if the adjacent tile in that direction is non-empty? Actually, the rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is confusing. Let me read again:\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it means: when you change orientation, you don't move, but you can change orientation regardless? The condition \"if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" might be a mistake? Because the rule for moving is that you change position and orientation, but for change orientation only, you don't move. So I think you can change orientation even if the adjacent tile in that direction is non-empty? Because you are not moving.\n\nBut the rule says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This might be for the move action? Actually, the move action says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and then it says \"Specifically, L (x-1, y), ...\". Then the change orientation action: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This seems to imply that if you try to change orientation to a direction where the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move? But that doesn't make sense because you are not moving. I think there might be a misinterpretation.\n\nLooking back: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is confusing. I think it means that if you use the change orientation action, you do not move (regardless of the adjacent tile) and only change your orientation. The condition might be for the move action? Let me read the entire rule:\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think the second sentence is meant for the move action: meaning that when you try to move, if the adjacent tile in the direction is not empty, then you don't move? But the first rule for move says it changes position and orientation. So I think the move action only succeeds (moves and changes orientation) if the adjacent tile in the direction is empty. Otherwise, it fails? But the rule doesn't explicitly say that.\n\nBut then the change orientation action: it says \"No move if ...\", which is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the change orientation action is intended to change orientation without moving, but the condition might be that if you are trying to change orientation to face a non-empty tile? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the rule description. Let me assume that:\n\n- Move action: you attempt to move in a direction. If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then you move and your orientation becomes that direction. Otherwise, you don't move and your orientation changes? Or you don't move and orientation doesn't change? The rule doesn't specify.\n\nBut the rule for change orientation says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This might mean that when you use the change orientation action, you don't move (so your position remains) and your orientation changes to the specified direction, but if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then ... what? The sentence is incomplete.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will rely on the fact that in the game, you can change orientation without any condition. So for Alice, she can change orientation to any direction without moving.\n\nBut for now, let's stick to the immediate needs.\n\n### Strategy:\n\nWe want to make a soup with 3 onions. We have:\n- Bob holding 1 onion.\n- Two onions on counters: at (2,2) and (6,4).\n\nWe can use one of the pots, say (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nAlice is at (3,1) and can interact with (3,0) if she is facing it. She is currently facing down (towards (3,0)), but she is holding nothing, so she can't add an ingredient.\n\nOption 1: Alice can go to the kitchen counter at (2,2) to pick up the onion there.\n\nBut (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so she must be adjacent and facing it to interact. How to get there?\n\nFrom (3,1):\n- Move left to (2,1). Then (2,1) is adjacent to (2,2) which is to the right? So if she moves to (2,1), she will be facing left (if she moved left) or she can change orientation.\n\nBut note: when you move, your orientation changes to the direction of the move. So if she moves left to (2,1), she will be facing left (so west, towards (1,1)). Then she needs to change orientation to right (east) to face (2,2). Then she can interact to pick up the onion.\n\nAlternatively, she can change orientation to face up (north) at (3,1) and then move up? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty, so she cannot move up. So she must go via (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nPlan for Alice:\n1. Move left to (2,1). Then she is at (2,1) and facing left (west).\n2. Change orientation to right (east) to face (2,2). \n3. Interact to pick up the onion from (2,2).\n\nThen she is holding an onion. Now she can go to a pot to put it in.\n\nThe nearest pot is at (3,0) or (4,0). From (2,1), she can move right to (3,1) and then face down to (3,0). But note: (3,0) is adjacent to (3,1). So:\n4. Move right to (3,1) -> now at (3,1) and facing right (east) because she moved right? Then she must change orientation to down (south) to face (3,0).\n5. Then interact to put the onion into the pot.\n\nBut note: the pot at (3,0) is currently empty. After she puts one onion, it will have one.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is at (6,1) holding an onion and facing down (south) towards (6,0). (6,0) is a kitchen counter. He can place the onion on the kitchen counter? But we don't want that. We want him to put it in a pot.\n\nThe nearest pot to Bob is (4,0) or (3,0). From (6,1), he can move left to (5,1) then (4,1) and then down to (4,0) is blocked because (4,0) is a pot? So he must be adjacent and facing the pot.\n\nAlternatively, he can go to (5,1) and then change orientation to down to face (5,0) (which is a kitchen counter, not a pot) -> not useful.\n\nTo get to a pot, Bob should go to (4,1) and then face down to (4,0) and put the onion.\n\nBut note: we are only planning for Alice. However, the problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". We can suggest for Bob, but the task is primarily for Alice.\n\nBut to maximize efficiency, we should consider both.\n\nSince we are only required to output Alice's actions, we can focus on Alice and hope Bob will do something reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, we can assume Bob will act optimally? But we don't control Bob.\n\nGiven Bob's action history: R, R, R, D, D. He was at ... and then moved right three times, then down twice. Now at (6,1) holding an onion and facing down. He might be about to place the onion on (6,0) if he interacts. But we don't want that.\n\nWe can try to coordinate by having Alice do her part and then Bob might adjust.\n\nBut to be safe, let's plan Alice's actions and hope Bob will contribute.\n\n### Revised plan for Alice:\n\nWe need to get three onions into a pot. We have:\n- Bob has one onion. We hope he puts it in a pot.\n- We can get the onion at (2,2) and put in a pot.\n- Then we need one more onion. We can get it from the dispenser or from (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) is far. Alternatively, we can get a fresh onion from the dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4).\n\nSince we are at (3,1), the dispenser at (3,4) is not too far.\n\nBut let's break down:\n\nStep 1: Alice picks up the onion at (2,2) as described.\n\nThen she puts it in the pot at (3,0). Then the pot has one onion.\n\nNow, we need two more. Bob has one, so if Bob puts his onion in the same pot, then we have two. Then we need one more.\n\nBut Bob is at (6,1). He can go to (3,0) but that's far. Alternatively, he can put his onion in the pot at (4,0) and then we have two pots with one each? Then we need two more onions to complete one soup.\n\nAlternatively, we can have both players work on one pot.\n\nBut let's see the distances.\n\nAfter Alice puts her onion in (3,0), she can then go to the onion dispenser at (3,4) to get another onion.\n\nHow to get to (3,4) from (3,1)? \n- (3,1) -> (3,2) is blocked. So she must go left or right.\n- From (3,1), move left to (2,1), then up to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty, so she can't walk on it. So she must go around.\n\nThe grid: \nRow 0: kitchen counters and pots (non-empty)\nRow 1: empty tiles? (3,1) is empty, (2,1), (4,1), etc.\nRow 2: kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) -> non-empty, so we cannot walk on row2 except the empty tiles? But there are no empty tiles on row2? The only tiles on row2 are kitchen counters? Then we must go around row2.\n\nHow to get to row3 and row4?\n\nLooking at the kitchen counters: (0,3) and (7,3) are kitchen counters, so row3 has kitchen counters at (0,3) and (7,3). What about (1,3), (2,3), ...? They are not listed, so they are empty.\n\nSimilarly, row4: kitchen counters at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). So (3,4) and (4,4) are onion dispensers, which are non-empty.\n\nSo the walkable tiles are the ones not in the non-empty list.\n\nTo go from (3,1) to (3,4):\n- Option: go left to (2,1), then up to (2,2) -> blocked. Cannot.\n- Go right to (4,1), then up? (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- So we must go to row3? \n  From (3,1) move down? (3,0) is blocked. \n  So we must go left or right to go around row2.\n\nThe only gaps in row2 are? The kitchen counters are from (2,2) to (5,2). So (1,2) and (6,2) might be empty? But we don't have information. The kitchen counters listed are (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (1,2) and (6,2) are not listed -> empty? And (0,2) is a plate dispenser -> non-empty, so (0,2) is blocked.\n\nSo to get to row3:\n- From (3,1), move left to (2,1), then left to (1,1) -> then up to (1,2) -> which is empty? Yes, because not listed as non-empty. Then from (1,2) move up to (1,3). (1,3) is empty? Because kitchen counters are only at (0,3) and (7,3). Then from (1,3) move right to (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) is an onion dispenser, so we need to be at (3,3) and face up to (3,4) to interact? But (3,3) is empty? Yes.\n\nSo the path for Alice to (3,4):\n1. Move left from (3,1) to (2,1)\n2. Move left to (1,1)\n3. Move up to (1,2)\n4. Move up to (1,3)\n5. Move right to (2,3)\n6. Move right to (3,3)\n7. Change orientation to up (north) to face (3,4)\n8. Interact to get an onion.\n\nThat's 7 moves just to get an onion, and then she has to come back to the pot.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice puts the first onion in the pot, she could go to the onion at (6,4) which is on a kitchen counter. But (6,4) is far.\n\nBut note: there is an onion at (6,4) on a kitchen counter. How to get there?\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,4):\n- We have to go around. For example: \n  (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> but (6,1) is occupied by Bob? At turn 23, Bob is at (6,1). But Bob might move.\n  Then from (6,1) to (6,2) is blocked because (6,2) is a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters at row2: (2,2) to (5,2) and (0,2) and (7,2) is serving counter? The serving counter is at (7,2). The kitchen counters at row2 are (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (6,2) is not listed -> empty? Then she can go to (6,2) and then to (6,3) (if empty) and then to (6,4)? But (6,4) is a kitchen counter and non-empty. So she must be at (6,3) and face up to (6,4) to interact.\n\nBut (6,3) is empty? Because kitchen counters are at (0,3) and (7,3) only. So (6,3) is empty.\n\nSo path to (6,4) from (3,1):\n1. Move right to (4,1)\n2. Move right to (5,1)\n3. Move right to (6,1) -> but Bob is there at turn 23. Players cannot walk through each other. So if Bob is still at (6,1), Alice cannot move there.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, go around:\n- From (3,1) move right to (4,1), then down? (4,0) is a pot -> blocked. Then up? (4,2) blocked. So she must go to row3 and then to the right.\n\nBut that is even longer.\n\nGiven the complexity, and that Bob has an onion and is near the pot at (4,0), it might be better to have Bob put his onion in (4,0) and then Alice can put her onion in (4,0) too? But she is at (3,1) and (4,0) is adjacent to (4,1). So she can go to (4,1) and face down to (4,0).\n\nBut first, she needs to pick up an onion.\n\nAlternative plan for Alice:\n\n1. Pick up the onion at (2,2) as before:\n   a. Move left to (2,1) -> now at (2,1), facing left.\n   b. Change orientation to right (east) to face (2,2).\n   c. Interact to pick up onion.\n\n2. Instead of putting in (3,0), put in (4,0) to be near Bob's potential action.\n   - From (2,1), move right to (3,1) -> now at (3,1), facing right (east).\n   - Move right to (4,1) -> at (4,1), facing right (east).\n   - Change orientation to down (south) to face (4,0) (the pot).\n   - Interact to put onion.\n\nThen the pot at (4,0) has one onion.\n\nNow, Bob is at (6,1) with an onion. We hope he will come to (4,1) and put his onion in (4,0). But (4,1) is now occupied by Alice? At step 2, Alice is at (4,1) after moving there. Then after she puts the onion, she can move away.\n\nBut Bob might not come immediately.\n\nThen Alice can go to the kitchen counter at (6,4) to get the onion there? But that is far and Bob is at (6,1) blocking the way.\n\nAlternatively, after putting the onion in (4,0), Alice can go to the onion dispenser at (4,4) to get another onion.\n\nPath from (4,1) to (4,4):\n- (4,1) to (4,2) is blocked (kitchen counter).\n- So go around: move right to (5,1) -> then up? (5,2) is blocked. Move to (5,1) then to (6,1) but Bob is there? Or move to (5,1) then to (5,0)? (5,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot walk. So must go up via row3.\n  - From (4,1) move right to (5,1) [if Bob moves away?] or if not, then left to (3,1), then up via the left path as before.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nGiven the time, and that we are at turn 23, and cooking takes 5 turns, we want to start cooking as soon as possible.\n\n### Optimized plan:\n\nWe have two pots. We can have one pot with three onions.\n\nBob has one onion. If he puts it in a pot, then we only need two more.\n\nAlice can get the onion at (2,2) and put in the same pot, then get one more from the dispenser.\n\nBut the dispenser is at (3,4) or (4,4), which is not too far if we go via row3.\n\nBut let's calculate the number of turns:\n\nFor Alice to do:\n1. Move to (2,1): 1 move (left from (3,1)).\n2. Change orientation to right: 1 action.\n3. Interact to pick up onion at (2,2): 1 action. Now holding onion.\n4. Move right to (3,1): 1 move.\n5. Move right to (4,1): 1 move.\n6. Change orientation to down: 1 action.\n7. Interact to put onion in pot at (4,0): 1 action. Now the pot has one onion.\n\nTotal: 7 actions.\n\nThen, Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing.\n\nNow, if Bob is at (6,1) and he moves to (4,1) to put his onion, he might be blocked by Alice. So Alice should move away.\n\nAfter step 7, Alice can move away, say to (3,1) or (5,1) to let Bob in.\n\nBut Bob might not be controlled by us.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can go to get another onion. The nearest is the dispenser at (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (4,4):\n- Cannot go up because (4,2) is blocked.\n- So go to row3: \n  a. Move right to (5,1) -> but (5,1) is empty? And (5,0) is kitchen counter -> blocked for moving down, but we are moving to (5,1). Then from (5,1), move up? (5,2) is blocked. So then move to (6,1) if Bob is not there, but if Bob is there, then cannot.\n  b. Or move left to (3,1), then to (3,0) blocked, so then to (2,1), then to (1,1), then up to (1,2), then to (1,3), then to (2,3), to (3,3), to (4,3), then to (4,4) is blocked, so at (4,3) change orientation to up to face (4,4) and interact.\n\nThat's many moves.\n\nBut if Bob is still at (6,1), then Alice can use the left path.\n\nBut let's assume Bob will move away. We hope he will go to (4,1) to put his onion in the pot.\n\nAfter Alice moves away from (4,1), say to (3,1), then Bob can move to (4,1) and put his onion in the pot. Then the pot has two onions.\n\nThen Alice can go to get the third onion.\n\nBut where to get the third onion? We have one at (6,4) on the kitchen counter. Or from the dispenser.\n\nThe dispenser is closer to the left path.\n\nAlternatively, use the onion at (6,4) that is already available.\n\nBut to get to (6,4) from (3,1) or (4,1), it's far.\n\nGiven the complexity, and to start cooking as soon as possible, we should focus on getting three onions into one pot quickly.\n\nSince Bob has one onion and is near the pot at (4,0), if he puts it in, then we only need two more. Alice can put one from (2,2) and then we have two in the pot, then she or Bob can get the third.\n\nBut Bob is already holding one, so after he puts it, he can go get another.\n\nBut we are planning for Alice.\n\nSo for Alice, after she puts her onion in the pot (at (4,0)), she can go to the onion dispenser at (4,4) to get a third onion.\n\nBut the path is long.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice puts the onion in the pot at (4,0), she can go to the kitchen counter at (6,4) to pick up the onion there, but that requires going to (6,4) which is blocked by Bob at (6,1) initially.\n\nSo let's assume that Bob will move to put his onion in the pot at (4,0) soon.\n\nThen after Alice has put her onion, she can move away to let Bob in, and then she can go to the dispenser.\n\nBut the dispenser at (4,4) is closer than (3,4) from (4,1).\n\nPath from (4,1) to (4,4) via row3:\n- Move to (4,1) -> already there.\n- Move left to (3,1) -> 1 move.\n- Move left to (2,1) -> 1 move.\n- Move left to (1,1) -> 1 move.\n- Move up to (1,2) -> 1 move.\n- Move up to (1,3) -> 1 move.\n- Move right to (2,3) -> 1 move.\n- Move right to (3,3) -> 1 move.\n- Move right to (4,3) -> 1 move.\n- Change orientation to up -> 1 action.\n- Interact to get onion from (4,4) -> 1 action.\n\nTotal: 9 actions to get the onion.\n\nThen she has to come back to put it in the pot.\n\nThis is too long.\n\nAlternatively, after the pot has two onions (one from Alice and one from Bob), Alice can go to the kitchen counter at (6,4) to get the third onion.\n\nBut to get to (6,4) from (4,1):\n- Move right to (5,1) -> 1 move (if Bob has moved from (6,1)?)\n- Move right to (6,1) -> 1 move (if not blocked)\n- Then move up to (6,2) -> 1 move ( (6,2) is empty? Yes)\n- Move up to (6,3) -> 1 move\n- Change orientation to up -> 1 action\n- Interact to pick up onion from (6,4) -> 1 action.\n\nSo 5 actions to get the onion.\n\nThen she has to come back to (4,1) to put it in the pot at (4,0):\n- Move down to (6,2) -> 1 move (orientation changes? But we can ignore for now)\n- Move down to (6,1) -> 1 move\n- Move left to (5,1) -> 1 move\n- Move left to (4,1) -> 1 move\n- Change orientation to down -> 1 action\n- Interact to put onion -> 1 action.\n\nTotal to get the third onion and put it: 11 actions.\n\nAnd that's if Bob has moved from (6,1).\n\nThis is not efficient.\n\n### Better idea:\n\nUse the two onions on the counters and have both players put in the same pot.\n\nAlice gets the onion from (2,2) and puts in the pot at (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nBob gets the onion from (6,4) and puts in the same pot.\n\nBut Bob is at (6,1) holding an onion. He can put that onion in the pot at (4,0) if he goes to (4,1) and faces down.\n\nThen he is free to go to (6,4) to get the other onion.\n\nSo for Bob:\n- Put his current onion in (4,0): \n  a. Move left to (5,1) -> 1 move\n  b. Move left to (4,1) -> 1 move\n  c. Change orientation to down -> 1 action\n  d. Interact to put onion. -> 1 action. Now the pot has one onion (if Alice hasn't put any) or two if Alice put one.\n\nThen he can go to (6,4) to get the onion there.\n\nBut Alice is also getting one.\n\nTo avoid duplication, we can assign.\n\nBut for Alice, we are planning.\n\nGiven the time constraints, and that we are at turn 23, and we want to plan for Alice for the next few turns (say H=10 turns), we can do the following:\n\nImmediate actions for Alice:\n\nTurn 23: Move left to (2,1)\nTurn 24: Change orientation to right (to face (2,2))\nTurn 25: Interact to pick up onion from (2,2)\nTurn 26: Move right to (3,1)\nTurn 27: Move right to (4,1)\nTurn 28: Change orientation to down (to face (4,0))\nTurn 29: Interact to put onion in (4,0)\n\nThen the pot at (4,0) has one onion (from Alice).\n\nThen Alice can move away to let Bob in. For example:\n\nTurn 30: Move left to (3,1)\n\nThen if Bob puts his onion, the pot will have two.\n\nThen Alice can go to the onion dispenser at (4,4) to get a third onion, but it's far. Instead, she can wait or do something else.\n\nAlternatively, after turn 29, Alice can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate for when the soup is ready.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). From (4,1), after put the onion, she is at (4,1). To (0,2):\n\n- Move left to (3,1)\n- Move left to (2,1)\n- Move left to (1,1)\n- Move up to (1,2) -> now at (1,2), which is adjacent to (0,2)? (0,2) is to the left. So change orientation to left and interact.\n\nBut (0,2) is a plate dispenser. She can grab a plate if she is empty-handed.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 30: Move left to (3,1)\nTurn 31: Move left to (2,1)\nTurn 32: Move left to (1,1)\nTurn 33: Move up to (1,2)\nTurn 34: Change orientation to left (west) to face (0,2)\nTurn 35: Interact to grab a plate.\n\nThen she holds a plate. The soup in the pot at (4,0) will be ready at turn 23 + 5 = turn 28 for the start of cooking? Let's see:\n\nWe put the first onion at turn 29 by Alice. Bob might put one at say turn 24-27 if he acts fast, but we don't control him.\n\nAssume that by turn 29, the pot has one onion. When will it have three? We don't know.\n\nPerhaps it's better to have Alice help with the third onion.\n\nBut for now, with the time, I'll plan the first few actions for Alice to at least put one onion in the pot and then get a plate.\n\nSo for the next 7 turns (H=7):\n\nTurn 23: L (move left to (2,1))\nTurn 24: R (change orientation to right) - but the action for change orientation to right is 'R'? But 'R' is also move right. How to distinguish?\n\nThe actions are: U, D, L, R for move and change orientation? And also for move, it changes orientation to that direction.\n\nThe action set is: U, D, L, R, I, S.\n\n- If you use U, D, L, R: it is a move action, which moves in that direction and changes your orientation to that direction.\n- There is no separate change orientation action? But the rules listed \"Change Orientation\" as a separate action.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nIn the rules:\n\n\"Player Actions per Turn\"\n- Move (L/R/U/D): ...\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): ...\n- Interact (I)\n- Stay (S)\n\nSo the action set includes specifying the action type. But in the answer format, we only have to output U, D, L, R, I, S.\n\nHow to output a change orientation action?\n\nPerhaps the change orientation action is also represented by U, D, L, R but without moving? But then how to differentiate from move?\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nLooking at the rules: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nIt seems that the same letters are used for both move and change orientation. But then how do we specify which one?\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. In many games, the move action also changes orientation to the direction of the move. For change orientation only, you might use the same letter but it doesn't move if you are not moving? But the rule says \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)\" as a separate action.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"each action \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, L, R, I, S\\}\\)\", so only these symbols.\n\nSo perhaps the action 'U' can mean either:\n- If you are trying to move, it means move up.\n- But for change orientation, how is it represented?\n\nPerhaps the change orientation action is not explicitly in the set. Let me read the rules again.\n\n\" Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n  - **Move** (L/R/U/D): ...\n  - **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): ...\n  - **Interact (I)**\n  - **Stay (S)**\"\n\nBut in the action set for output, it's only U, D, L, R, I, S.\n\n So how to output a change orientation action? It must be that the same letter is used, and the game engine knows from the context? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will assume that the only actions are:\n- U, D, L, R: which are move actions (which also change orientation to that direction).\n- I: interact\n- S: stay\n\nAnd that there is no separate change orientation action. Because if you want to change orientation without moving, you might use the same letter but then it would be a move action and if the move is blocked, it might fail and orientation might change? The rules are not clear.\n\nTo avoid risk, in this game, we can always use move actions to change orientation by moving to an empty adjacent tile. If there is no adjacent tile in that direction, then the move fails and orientation might not change? But the rules don't specify.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that:\n- When you use U, D, L, R, you are attempting to move in that direction. If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, you move and your orientation becomes that direction. If not, you don't move and your orientation does not change? Or changes? The rule doesn't say.\n\nFor simplicity, in many games, if you try to move and it's blocked, you don't move and your orientation changes to that direction? Or not.\n\nBut the rule for move says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and then it says the position change. It doesn't mention what happens if blocked.\n\nFor the sake of this problem, I will assume that move actions can only be done if the adjacent tile is empty, and if not, the action fails and nothing happens (no move and orientation not changed). But then how to change orientation without moving?\n\nThe change orientation action is separate, but it's not in the action set for output.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\n Perhaps the 'S' action can be used to change orientation? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the change orientation action is not available, and players can only change orientation by moving.\n\nSo if you want to face a different direction, you must move in that direction if possible.\n\nIn that case, for Alice to face (2,2) from (2,1), she must move east, but (3,1) is empty, so she would move to (3,1) and face east. But then she is not at (2,1) anymore.\n\nSo she cannot interact with (2,2) from (2,1) without moving away.\n\nTherefore, to interact with (2,2), she must be at (2,1) and facing east. So at (2,1), if she does 'R' (move right), she will move to (3,1) and face east, which is away from (2,2).\n\nSo she cannot face (2,2) from (2,1) because to face east, she must move east.\n\nThis means she cannot interact with (2,2) from (2,1) because the only way to face east is to move east, which takes her away.\n\n Therefore, the only way to interact with (2,2) is from the south or north? (2,2) is at (2,2). The adjacent tiles are (2,1) to the south, (2,3) to the north, (1,2) to the west, and (3,2) to the east.\n\n (2,1) is empty, (2,3) is empty? (2,3) is not in the non-empty list, so empty. (1,2) is empty, (3,2) is kitchen counter -> non-empty.\n\nSo Alice can be at (2,1) and face north to (2,2) or at (2,3) and face south to (2,2), or at (1,2) and face east to (2,2), or at (3,2) but (3,2) is non-empty, cannot stand.\n\nSo from (2,1), if she faces north, she can interact with (2,2).\n\nHow to face north from (2,1)? \n- She can use a change orientation action to face north. But if that action is not available, then she must have moved north to (2,2) but (2,2) is non-empty, cannot move there.\n\nSo she must have the change orientation action.\n\nGiven the answer format only includes U, D, L, R, I, S, I think we must assume that U, D, L, R can also represent change orientation when the move is not possible.\n\nBut the rule says for change orientation: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This suggests that when you use U, D, L, R, if the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move (change orientation only).\n\nSo in effect, the action U means: if the tile above is empty, move up and face up; if not, then change orientation to up without moving.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo in this case, for Alice at (2,1), if she does 'U' (up), then since (2,2) is not empty, she doesn't move but changes her orientation to up (north), so she faces (2,2).\n\nThen she can interact.\n\nSo in the action sequence, we can use 'U' for change orientation to up when the move is not possible.\n\nSo for Alice to pick up the onion at (2,2) from (2,1):\n- At (2,1), orientation is left (because she moved left to get there).\n- Action 'U' (up): since (2,2) is not empty, she doesn't move but changes orientation to up.\n- Then 'I' to interact, picks up the onion.\n\n Similarly for other orientations.\n\nSo we can use that.\n\n### Final decision:\n\nFor the next few turns, have Alice put one onion in the pot and then get a plate.\n\nSequence for Alice:\n\nTurn 23: L (move left to (2,1)) -> now at (2,1), orientation left (west)\nTurn 24: U ( since (2,2) is not empty, change orientation to up (north) to face (2,2) )\nTurn 25: I (interact to pick up onion from (2,2)) -> now holding onion.\nTurn 26: R ( move right to (3,1) -> if (3,1) is empty, she moves and faces east)\nTurn 27: R ( move right to (4,1) -> moves and faces east)\nTurn 28: D ( since (4,0) is not empty, she doesn't move but changes orientation to down (south) to face (4,0) )\nTurn 29: I ( interact to put onion in pot at (4,0) -> now holding nothing.\n\nThen she can go to get a plate.\n\nTurn 30: L ( move left to (3,1) -> faces west)\nTurn 31: L ( move left to (2,1) -> faces west)\nTurn 32: L ( move left to (1,1) -> faces west)\nTurn 33: U ( move up to (1,2) -> if (1,2) is empty, she moves and faces north)\nTurn 34: L ( change orientation to west? But she is at (1,2), and to face (0,2) which is west, so she can do 'L' (left): since (0,2) is not empty, she doesn't move but changes orientation to west.\nTurn 35: I ( interact to grab a plate from the plate dispenser at (0,2))\n\nBut this is for 13 turns, and we might not need to plan that far.\n\nSince the task says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\", we can choose H=6 or 7.\n\nFor the answer, we can output the first few actions.\n\nGiven that, I'll output for turns 23 to 29 (7 actions).\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 23: L\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: I\nTurn 26: R\nTurn 27: R\nTurn 28: D\nTurn 29: I\n\nThen she has put one onion in the pot at (4,0).\n\nWe hope Bob will add his onion soon.\n\nThen she can proceed to get a plate.\n\nBut for the answer, we stop at turn 29.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: L\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: I\nTurn 26: R\nTurn 27: R\nTurn 28: D\nTurn 29: I\n}\n\nThis is for turns 23 to 29 (7 actions).\n\nNote: This assumes that during these turns, Bob doesn't block Alice's moves. For example, at turn 26, when Alice moves to (3,1), it must be empty. Currently, at turn 23, (3,1) is where Alice is, and she is moving away, so at turn 26, when she moves back to (3,1), it should be empty unless Bob moves there.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) must be empty at turn 27.\n\nAt turn 23, Bob is at (6,1), so (4,1) is empty.\n\nWe hope Bob doesn't move to (4,1) in the next few turns.\n\nIf he does, then the move might fail, and we may need to adjust, but we are only planning for Alice.\n\nSo this is a reasonable plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice should focus on contributing to the completion of an onion soup in the pot at (4,0). Given the current state, Bob is holding an onion and positioned near the same pot, making (4,0) the optimal choice for collaboration. Alice will retrieve the onion from the kitchen counter at (2,2) and deliver it to the pot at (4,0). This sequence ensures efficient coordination with Bob, who is expected to add his onion to the same pot, enabling the soup to start cooking sooner. Once the soup is cooking, Alice can later retrieve a plate for serving (not included in this sequence due to the short planning horizon).\n\n### Action Sequence for Alice (Turns 23 to 29)\n- **Turn 23 (L)**: Move left from (3,1) to (2,1). This positions Alice adjacent to the kitchen counter at (2,2). Orientation changes to left (west) due to the move.\n- **Turn 24 (U)**: Change orientation to up (north) to face (2,2). Since (2,2) is non-empty, this action does not move Alice but changes her orientation to interact with the counter.\n- **Turn 25 (I)**: Interact to pick up the onion from (2,2). Alice is now holding an onion.\n- **Turn 26 (R)**: Move right from (2,1) to (3,1). This moves Alice toward the pot at (4,0). Orientation changes to right (east).\n- **Turn 27 (R)**: Move right from (3,1) to (4,1). Alice is now adjacent to the pot at (4,0). Orientation changes to right (east).\n- **Turn 28 (D)**: Change orientation to down (south) to face (4,0). Since (4,0) is non-empty, this action does not move Alice but prepares her to interact with the pot.\n- **Turn 29 (I)**: Interact to place the onion into the pot at (4,0). The pot now contains one onion (combined with Bob's expected contribution, it will have two, accelerating progress toward the required three).\n\n### Rationale\n- **Efficiency**: This sequence (7 actions) ensures Alice delivers an onion to the pot quickly, leveraging existing resources (onion at (2,2)) and positioning.\n- **Coordination**: By targeting (4,0), Alice aligns with Bob's location and held onion, increasing the likelihood of rapid pot filling.\n- **Cooking Start**: With two onions added (Alice's and Bob's), only one more onion is needed to start cooking (5-turn cook time). Alice or Bob can fetch the third onion (e.g., from (6,4) or a dispenser) in subsequent turns.\n- **Constraints Adherence**: All moves avoid non-empty tiles and account for orientation changes for interactions. Bob's position (6,1) does not block Alice's path in this sequence.\n- **Reward Maximization**: Completing the onion soup yields 20 points. Starting cooking early is critical given the game turn (23), with soup ready by turn 28 + 5 = 33 if filled promptly.\n\n### Next Steps (Beyond Turn 29)\n- Alice should move away from (4,1) (e.g., to (3,1)) to allow Bob access to the pot.\n- Alice can then fetch a plate from (0,2) to be ready for serving.\n- Bob should add his onion to (4,0) and fetch the third onion (e.g., from (6,4)).\n- After cooking, serve the soup at (7,2) for the reward.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: L \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: I \\\\\nTurn 26: R \\\\\nTurn 27: R \\\\\nTurn 28: D \\\\\nTurn 29: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 26. The goal is to maximize the reward by delivering soups. The only recipe is 3 onions, which cooks in 5 turns and gives 20 reward.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice: at (1,1), facing left (L), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (6,2), facing up (U), holding nothing.\n\nKitchen counters with items:\n- (2,2): onion\n- (6,4): onion\n- (7,1): onion\n\nPots: both empty (at (3,0) and (4,0))\n\nRecipe: only one recipe, 3 onions, reward 20, cooking time 5 turns.\n\nPlan: We need to make a 3-onion soup and deliver it. Since there are already 3 onions on counters, we can use those. We don't need to get onions from the dispensers.\n\nSteps:\n1. Collect the onions from the counters and put them into a pot.\n2. Wait for the soup to cook (5 turns).\n3. Then, get a plate, serve the soup, and deliver it.\n\nBut note: we have two players. We can parallelize.\n\nHowever, the pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The serving counter is at (7,2). The plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nAlso note: the players cannot walk through each other or non-empty tiles.\n\nLet's assign tasks:\n\nOption 1:\n- Alice: pick up onion from (2,2) (which is adjacent to (1,1)? Let's see the grid.\n\nGrid coordinates: \nWe have a grid from (0,0) to (7,4) I assume? The counters and dispensers are given.\n\nAlice at (1,1). The kitchen counter at (2,2) is one step right and one down? Actually, from (1,1) to (2,2): \n- (1,1) to (2,1) is right, then (2,1) to (2,2) is down? But note: the grid is such that moving right increases x, up increases y? The problem says: L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1). So y increases upward? Then (1,1) to (2,2) is right and up? But (2,2) is at (x=2, y=2). So from (1,1) to (2,2): we can go right then up? But that would be (1,1) -> R to (2,1) -> then U to (2,2). But (2,1) is not listed as a counter, so it must be an empty tile? We don't have a map of all tiles, but we know the non-empty ones. We assume the rest are empty.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (6,2). The kitchen counter at (7,1) is one right and one down? (6,2) -> R to (7,2) -> then D to (7,1)? But (7,2) is a serving counter, which is non-empty? So we cannot walk on it? Also, note: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. So Bob cannot go to (7,2) because it's a serving counter? But the serving counter is a tile that is non-empty? Actually, the rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So Bob cannot step on (7,2) because it's a serving counter. Therefore, Bob cannot go to (7,1) directly from (6,2) because (7,2) is in the way? But (7,1) is adjacent to (6,1)? Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,2), Bob can go down to (6,1) (if that tile is empty) and then right to (7,1). But is (6,1) empty? We don't have a full grid, but we know the non-empty tiles: counters, dispensers, etc. The non-empty tiles listed are the ones that are not empty. So (6,1) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, the counter at (6,4) is at (6,4). Bob is at (6,2). He can go up to (6,3) and then (6,4)? But (6,3) is not listed, so empty? But we must check if there are any obstacles.\n\nHowever, note that Bob is facing up. To interact with a counter, he must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nPlan for Alice:\n- She is at (1,1). The counter at (2,2) is adjacent? Adjacent means horizontally or vertically adjacent. (1,1) and (2,2) are diagonal? Not adjacent. So she must move to (1,2) or (2,1) to be adjacent to (2,2). But (2,2) is at (2,2). \n  - From (1,1), if she goes right to (2,1), then she is at (2,1) and (2,2) is above her. Then she can face up and interact to pick up the onion.\n  - Alternatively, from (1,1) she goes up to (1,2), then right to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a counter, so she cannot walk on it. So she must stand next to it.\n\nSo:\n- Alice: move right to (2,1) -> now at (2,1). Then change orientation to up (U) to face (2,2). Then interact (I) to pick up the onion.\n\nThen, she is holding an onion. Next, she needs to put it in a pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). From (2,1), she can go down to (2,0)? But (2,0) is a kitchen counter? Yes, it's in the list. So she cannot step on it. So she must go to (3,0) from (2,1) by going right to (3,1) (if empty) then down to (3,0). But (3,0) is a pot, which is non-empty? Actually, we can walk on empty tiles only. The pot is non-empty? But the rules: we can interact with adjacent non-empty tiles. We don't walk on the pot. So we must be adjacent to the pot.\n\nSo from (2,1):\n- Move right to (3,1). (3,1) is not listed as non-empty, so empty? Then from (3,1), the pot is at (3,0) which is below. So face down (D) and interact to put the onion in the pot.\n\nBut note: we can only put an ingredient if the pot is not full. Currently, both pots are empty.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can get another onion and put it in the same pot? But we need 3 onions. We have 3 onions on counters. So we can assign:\n\n- Alice: gets the onion at (2,2) and puts it in a pot (say, the one at (3,0)).\n- Bob: gets the onion at (7,1) and puts it in the same pot? Or at (6,4) and then put in the pot.\n\nBut Bob is at (6,2). He can go to (7,1) by: down to (6,1) (if empty), then right to (7,1). Then face? (7,1) is a counter. He is at (7,1)? No, he is at (6,1) and then moves right to (7,1) but (7,1) is a counter, so he cannot step on it. So he must stand adjacent? Actually, to interact with (7,1), he must be adjacent and facing it. So he can stand at (6,1) and face right (R) to interact with (7,1). Similarly, he can stand at (7,0) or (7,2) but (7,2) is serving counter (non-empty) and (7,0) is a kitchen counter? (7,0) is in the list? Yes, (7,0) is a kitchen counter, so non-empty. So the only adjacent tile to (7,1) that is empty is (6,1). So Bob must be at (6,1) and facing right to pick up the onion at (7,1).\n\nSo Bob:\n- Move down from (6,2) to (6,1). Then face right (R) and interact to pick up the onion at (7,1).\n\nThen, Bob is holding an onion. Now he needs to put it in a pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). He is at (6,1). He can go left to (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) and then down to (3,0)? But (3,0) is a pot, so he cannot step on it. So from (3,1), face down and interact to put in the pot at (3,0).\n\nBut note: Alice is also going to (3,1) to put her onion? There might be conflict.\n\nAlternatively, we can use two pots? But we only need one soup. So we should put all three in the same pot.\n\nWe have a third onion at (6,4). Bob could get that one? But he is at (6,1) after picking up (7,1). Then he would have to go to (6,4) which is up. But then he is holding an onion, so he can't pick up another. So the third onion must be picked up by someone else.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice puts her onion in the pot, she can go get the third onion? But the third onion is at (6,4) or (7,1) but (7,1) is taken by Bob? Actually, Bob is getting (7,1). The onions on counters are: (2,2), (6,4), (7,1). So (7,1) is taken by Bob, (2,2) by Alice, then (6,4) is left.\n\nSo after Alice puts her onion in the pot at (3,0), she can go to (6,4) to get the third onion? But that is far. Alternatively, Bob, after putting his onion, can go get the third one? But Bob would be at (3,1) after putting, then he can go to (6,4)? Also far.\n\nWe have two players. We can have one player (Alice) handle the first two onions? But she can only carry one at a time.\n\nBetter: \n- Alice gets onion from (2,2) and puts in pot (3,0).\n- Bob gets onion from (7,1) and puts in the same pot (3,0).\n- Then, Alice (or Bob) gets the third onion from (6,4) and puts in the pot.\n\nBut who? Let's see the positions after the first two puts.\n\nAfter Alice puts at (3,0): she is at (3,1) holding nothing.\nAfter Bob puts at (3,0): he is at (3,1) holding nothing? But they both are at (3,1)? Then they would be on the same tile? That's not allowed. So we must avoid that.\n\nSo we need to coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to the other pot? But we want one pot with three onions.\n\nSo we can have Bob put his onion in the same pot but at a different time? But the pot is at (3,0). Both players can interact with it from (3,1). But if both are at (3,1) at the same time, that's not allowed because they cannot occupy the same tile.\n\nSo we must sequence the actions so they are not at the same place at the same time.\n\nPlan:\n\nTurn 26 (current turn is 26, so we start planning from turn 26 onwards):\n\nAlice (at (1,1), facing left, holding nothing):\n- Move right to (2,1) -> action: R\n\nBob (at (6,2), facing up, holding nothing):\n- Move down to (6,1) -> action: D\n\nTurn 27:\n- Alice: now at (2,1), facing left? But she just moved right so now she is facing right? Actually, the move action also changes orientation. When you move, you also change orientation to the direction of movement. So after moving right, Alice is facing right (R). But to interact with (2,2) which is above, she needs to face up. So she must change orientation to up (U) OR move up? But moving up from (2,1) to (2,2) is not possible because (2,2) is a counter (non-empty). So she must change orientation to up (U) and then interact (I). So two actions: first U (to face up), then I (to pick up). But we can only do one action per turn. So we have to break it.\n\nAt turn 27, Alice can only do one action: change orientation to up (U). Then at turn 28, interact (I) to pick up the onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (6,1) after moving down. He is facing down? Because he moved down. But to interact with (7,1) which is to his right, he must face right. So he must change orientation to right (R) at turn 27.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 26:\n- Alice: R (move right to (2,1))\n- Bob: D (move down to (6,1))\n\nTurn 27:\n- Alice: U (change orientation to face up, so she can interact with (2,2))\n- Bob: R (change orientation to face right, so he can interact with (7,1))\n\nTurn 28:\n- Alice: I (pick up onion from (2,2)) -> now holding onion\n- Bob: I (pick up onion from (7,1)) -> now holding onion\n\nNow, both are holding an onion. They need to put them in a pot.\n\nAlice at (2,1), holding onion. She needs to go to a pot. The pot at (3,0) is adjacent from (3,1). So she must move to (3,1). From (2,1), move right to (3,1). Then face down to interact with (3,0).\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (6,1), holding onion. He needs to go to (3,1) to put in the same pot? But that is far. Alternatively, he can put in the pot at (4,0)? But we want to put both in the same pot? Actually, we can put in different pots, but then we have two pots with one onion each, which is not useful. We need three in one pot.\n\nSo let's put both in the same pot (3,0). Then we only need one more onion.\n\nSo Bob must go to (3,1) to put his onion. But that is a long path: (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1). Then face down and interact.\n\nBut note: Alice is also going to (3,1) at the same time? We need to avoid collision.\n\nTurn 28 after actions:\n- Alice: at (2,1), holding onion. She will move right to (3,1) at turn 29.\n- Bob: at (6,1), holding onion. He will start moving left.\n\nBut Bob has a long way. So:\n\nTurn 29:\n- Alice: move right (R) to (3,1)\n- Bob: move left (L) to (5,1)\n\nTurn 30:\n- Alice: now at (3,1), holding onion. She needs to put it in the pot. But to interact, she must face down. Currently, after moving right, she is facing right. So she must change orientation to down (D) and then interact. But that's two actions. So at turn 30, she can change orientation to down (D).\n- Bob: move left to (4,1)\n\nTurn 31:\n- Alice: interact (I) to put the onion in the pot at (3,0). Now the pot has one onion. Alice is now holding nothing.\n- Bob: move left to (3,1). But wait, Alice is at (3,1) at turn 30? At turn 30, Alice is at (3,1) and she changes orientation to down. Then at turn 31, she interacts and remains at (3,1). Then Bob cannot move to (3,1) at turn 31 because Alice is there.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo we must have Bob wait or take a different path? Or have Alice move away after putting.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob put in the other pot? But then we have two pots with one onion each. Then we need two more onions for each. But we only have one onion left (at (6,4)). So that won't work.\n\nWe must have both onions in the same pot. So we need to have Bob arrive at (3,1) when Alice is not there.\n\nAfter Alice puts the onion at turn 31, she can move away at turn 32. Then Bob can come at turn 32 or 33.\n\nBut Bob is at (4,1) at turn 31. He can move to (3,1) at turn 32 only if Alice moves away at turn 32.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 31:\n- Alice: I (put onion in pot at (3,0)) -> now the pot has one onion. Alice at (3,1) holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (4,1), holding onion. He cannot move to (3,1) because Alice is there. So he must wait? Or move to (4,0)? But (4,0) is a pot, non-empty? He can't step on it. So he must wait at (4,1). Action: Stay (S).\n\nTurn 32:\n- Alice: move away, say up to (3,2) (if empty). (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, in the list: (3,2) is a kitchen counter. So she cannot go there. Then left to (2,1)? But (2,1) is empty? We assume so. Or down? But (3,0) is a pot, so she can't go down. So only directions: left to (2,1) or up to (3,2) but (3,2) is counter -> blocked. So only left to (2,1). So Alice: move left (L) to (2,1).\n- Bob: now move left to (3,1) (since Alice left (3,1)).\n\nTurn 33:\n- Alice: now at (2,1). She can start going to get the third onion at (6,4). But that's far. Alternatively, she can wait? Or we can have Bob put his onion and then go get the third? But Bob is at (3,1) and needs to put.\n- Bob: at (3,1), holding onion. He must face down (D) to interact with the pot. Currently, after moving left, he is facing left? So he must change orientation to down (D).\n\nTurn 34:\n- Bob: interact (I) to put onion in pot. Now the pot has two onions.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice can be heading to get the third onion. The third onion is at (6,4). Alice at (2,1) at turn 33. She needs to go to (6,4). That is: right to (3,1) but Bob is there at turn 33? At turn 33, Bob is at (3,1) and changing orientation. Then at turn 34, Bob is still at (3,1) when he interacts. So Alice cannot go to (3,1) at turn 33 or 34.\n\nSo Alice must go around? Or wait. Alternatively, Bob can get the third onion after he puts his? But Bob is closer to (6,4) than Alice? Bob is at (3,1) after putting, and (6,4) is at (6,4). Alice is at (2,1). Both are about the same distance? But Bob is at (3,1) and (6,4) is (3 steps right and 3 up?).\n\nBut we also have the onion at (6,4). Bob is at (3,1) at turn 34 (after putting). Then he can go to (6,4) by: \n- Turn 35: move right to (4,1)\n- Turn 36: move right to (5,1)\n- Turn 37: move right to (6,1)\n- Then, to get to (6,4): \n  - Turn 38: up to (6,2) -> but (6,2) is Bob's starting position? We don't know if it's empty, but it should be. Then turn 39: up to (6,3), turn 40: up to (6,4). Then face? He needs to pick up the onion at (6,4). He is at (6,4) but that's the counter? No, he must stand adjacent. The counter at (6,4) is a kitchen counter. He must stand adjacent to it. The adjacent tiles: (5,4), (6,3), (6,5) [but y=5? The grid only to y=4?], (7,4). \n  - (7,4) is a kitchen counter? Yes, in the list. (5,4) is a kitchen counter? (5,4) is in the list: (5,4) is a kitchen counter. (6,3) is not listed, so empty. So Bob can stand at (6,3) and face up (U) to interact with (6,4)? But (6,4) is at the same x and y+1? From (6,3), facing up would be (6,4) which is the counter. So yes.\n\nBut note: (6,3) is empty, so Bob can go to (6,3) and then face up to interact.\n\nBut that would be many turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice get the third onion. Alice is at (2,1) at turn 34. She can go to (6,4) via:\n- Turn 34: move right to (3,1) -> but Bob is at (3,1) until turn 34? At turn 34, Bob is at (3,1) and interacts (putting onion). Then at turn 35, Bob moves away? But we haven't planned Bob beyond turn 34.\n\nWe need to plan for both.\n\nBut note: we are only planning for Alice? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But to maximize, we must consider both. However, the answer format only lists actions for Alice? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\". So we only output Alice's actions? But then Bob might block. We have to assume Bob will cooperate? The task is to help Alice collaborate with Bob. So we should plan for both? But the answer format only has one sequence. \n\nLooking back: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". It says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only shows one set of actions. So I think we only output Alice's actions and assume Bob will be controlled by another agent? Or we have to assume Bob is following a similar plan? \n\nThe problem: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\" and \"optimize coordination\". So we must consider both. But the answer format only lists one sequence. Perhaps we plan Alice's actions and assume Bob is doing the optimal thing? But we don't control Bob? \n\nRe-read: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". The \"optionally\" might mean we can also plan for Bob? But the answer format doesn't have two sequences. The boxed answer only has one set of actions. \n\nLooking at the answer format: it's a sequence of actions for turns, labeled by turn, and the action. It doesn't specify which player. But the task says \"for Alice\", so I think only Alice's actions.\n\nBut then how to collaborate? We must assume Bob is also trying to maximize the reward and will act accordingly? Or we have to plan Alice's actions considering Bob's possible actions? \n\nThe problem states: \"based on the current game state and action history of both players\". So we know Bob's history and state. We can predict Bob's actions? Or we must plan only for Alice.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think we are to output only Alice's actions. But then we must assume Bob will do the right thing? Or we must plan Alice's actions to avoid blocking and to coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan for Alice and note that Bob should do certain things? But the answer format doesn't allow that.\n\nI think for this task, we plan Alice's actions and assume Bob will be controlled by the same planning system? But the problem says \"teammate (Bob)\" and we are to help Alice collaborate. So perhaps we plan for both? But the answer format only has one sequence. \n\nRe-examining the answer format: it says \"Where each action \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, L, R, I, S\\}\" and it's a sequence labeled by turn. It doesn't specify player. But the initial state has two players. And the task says \"for Alice\". So I think we output only Alice's actions.\n\nTherefore, we plan Alice's actions and hope that Bob will do his part. But to avoid blocking, we must be cautious.\n\nAlternative plan: Alice gets the first onion, puts it, then gets the third onion while Bob gets the second and puts it.\n\nBut Bob might not get the second? We have to assume Bob is also trying to help.\n\nGiven Bob's action history: D, D, R, I, U. Most recent: U. He is at (6,2) facing up. We don't know his goal.\n\nTo be safe, we plan Alice to get two onions? But she can only carry one at a time.\n\nWe have to use the counters for intermediate storage? For example, Alice gets an onion and puts it on a counter near the pot? But there are counters.\n\nBut we already have onions on counters. We can use the same counters.\n\nBut let's try to have Alice get the onion at (2,2), put it in the pot, then go get the onion at (6,4) and put it in the pot. Then we need Bob to put one onion.\n\nBut Bob is at (6,2) initially. He can easily get the onion at (7,1) and put it in the pot.\n\nSo we plan Alice to do:\n- Get onion from (2,2) and put in pot.\n- Then go to (6,4) and get that onion and put in the same pot.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can get the onion from (7,1) and put in the pot.\n\nSo Alice's actions:\n\nTurn 26: R (move right to (2,1))\nTurn 27: U (face up to face (2,2))\nTurn 28: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\nTurn 29: R (move right to (3,1))\nTurn 30: D (face down to face pot at (3,0))\nTurn 31: I (put onion in pot) -> now pot has one onion.\n\nThen Alice needs to go to (6,4) to get the onion there. From (3,1), she can go:\n- Turn 32: R to (4,1)\n- Turn 33: R to (5,1)\n- Turn 34: R to (6,1)\n- Turn 35: U to (6,2) -> but (6,2) is the serving counter? No, (6,2) is not listed as non-empty? We have non-empty tiles: kitchen counters at (0,0) to (7,4) as per list, but (6,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counter list: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). So (6,2) is not in the list, so it is empty. So she can move to (6,2).\n- Turn 36: U to (6,3) -> empty?\n- Turn 37: U to (6,4) -> but (6,4) is a kitchen counter, so she cannot step on it. So she must stop at (6,3) and interact with (6,4) which is above.\n\nSo at turn 37: she is at (6,3). Then she must face up (U) to interact.\n\nTurn 38: U (face up)\nTurn 39: I (pick up onion from (6,4))\n\nThen she is holding an onion. She needs to put it in the pot at (3,0). So she must go back.\n\nFrom (6,3):\n- Turn 40: D to (6,2) [move down]\n- Turn 41: D to (6,1)\n- Turn 42: L to (5,1)\n- Turn 43: L to (4,1)\n- Turn 44: L to (3,1)\n- Turn 45: D (face down to face pot)\n- Turn 46: I (put onion)\n\nThen the pot has two onions from Alice and one from Bob? We hope Bob has put one.\n\nBob should have put the onion from (7,1) in the pot. Bob is at (6,1) at turn 26-28: \n- Turn 26: D (down to (6,1))\n- Turn 27: R (face right)\n- Turn 28: I (pick up onion from (7,1))\n\nThen he needs to put it in the pot. He can go to (3,0) via:\n- Turn 29: L to (5,1) [move left from (6,1) to (5,1))\n- Turn 30: L to (4,1)\n- Turn 31: L to (3,1)\n- Turn 32: D (face down)\n- Turn 33: I (put in pot)\n\nSo by turn 33, Bob has put his onion in the pot. So the pot has two onions by turn 33. Then Alice puts her second onion at turn 46, so the pot gets the third onion at turn 46. Then the cooking starts.\n\nThe cooking time is 5 turns. So at turn 46+5 = turn 51, the soup is cooked.\n\nThen someone needs to serve it: get a plate, serve the soup, and deliver.\n\nBut that is far in the future. And we are only planning for several turns. The horizon H is not specified. We can choose H=20 or so? But the problem says \"next several turns\", so perhaps we plan until Alice has put the third onion? But that is turn 46, which is 20 turns from turn 26? 46-26=20 turns. So H=20.\n\nBut then we haven't delivered. But we can plan only part of the process.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize reward, so we should complete the soup.\n\nHowever, with H=20, from turn 26 to turn 45 (20 actions: t=26 to 45 inclusive is 20 turns? 26 to 45 is 20 turns? 45-26+1=20 turns. So we can plan until turn 45.\n\nAt turn 45, Alice is at (3,1) and has just moved there, and needs to face down and interact at turn 46, which is beyond.\n\nSo perhaps we plan until she puts the third onion.\n\nBut let's count the turns for Alice:\n\nTurn 26: R\n27: U\n28: I\n29: R\n30: D\n31: I  -> put first onion\n32: R\n33: R\n34: R\n35: U\n36: U\n37: U  -> now at (6,3)\n38: U (face up)  -- to interact with (6,4)\n39: I  -- pick up onion\n40: D  -- move down to (6,2)\n41: D  -- to (6,1)\n42: L  -- to (5,1)\n43: L  -- to (4,1)\n44: L  -- to (3,1)\n45: D  -- face down\n46: I  -- put onion\n\nSo from turn 26 to 46: 21 actions. But turn 26 is the first action we plan. The current turn is 26, and we are to plan the next actions. So at turn 26, we plan actions for turns 26,27,28,..., up to H-1? The task says: \"over next several turns(say, H turns)\" and \"sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\)\" — wait, the indexing is confusing.\n\nIt says: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\)\" — so for t from 1 to H-1, actions at t1+1 to t1+H-1. That means we are planning from turn t1+1 to turn t1+H-1, which is H-1 actions. But then what about turn t1? The current turn is t1, and we are to plan starting from t1? The text says: \"at turn t1, plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns\". And in the answer format, it starts with \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\".\n\nSo we plan for turn t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1+H-1 for some H.\n\nWe can choose H. Since the cooking takes time, we might not be able to deliver within a small H. But we can plan until Alice has contributed to the soup.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's plan for Alice to put the first onion and then start heading for the third, but we may not reach.\n\nBut with H=10, for example.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice get the onion from (2,2) and put it, then get the onion from (7,1) if Bob doesn't, but that might not be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can get the onion from (2,2) and put it on a counter near the pot, then get another onion, but there are no dispensers nearby.\n\nOr, after putting the first onion, she can go to the plate dispenser to get a plate for future serving? But the soup is not cooked yet.\n\nPrioritize: we need to fill the pot with three onions.\n\nSince there are two pots, we can fill one pot with three onions.\n\nThe onions on counters are three, so one player can gather them.\n\nBut with two players, it's faster.\n\nFor Alice, we can do:\n\nTurn 26: R ( to (2,1) )\nTurn 27: U (face up)\nTurn 28: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\nTurn 29: R ( to (3,1) )\nTurn 30: D (face down)\nTurn 31: I (put in pot at (3,0)) -> pot has one onion.\n\nThen, instead of going to (6,4), she can go to (7,1) to get that onion, but (7,1) is far and Bob might be getting it.\n\nBob is at (6,2) and can easily get (7,1) as we saw.\n\nSo assume Bob gets (7,1) and puts it in the pot.\n\nThen Alice can get the onion from (6,4).\n\nBut as above.\n\nFor the sake of completing the plan within a horizon, let's plan Alice's actions for 10 turns: from turn 26 to 35.\n\nTurn 26: R ( to (2,1) )\nTurn 27: U (face up)\nTurn 28: I (pick up onion)\nTurn 29: R ( to (3,1) )\nTurn 30: D (face down)\nTurn 31: I (put in pot)\nTurn 32: R ( to (4,1) )\nTurn 33: R ( to (5,1) )\nTurn 34: R ( to (6,1) )\nTurn 35: U ( to (6,2) ) \n\nThen she is at (6,2) at turn 35.\n\nBob, if he is rational, should have picked up the onion at (7,1) and may be on his way to the pot.\n\nThen Alice can continue to (6,3) and (6,4) in subsequent turns.\n\nBut we stop at turn 35 for now.\n\nThis is not complete, but within 10 turns.\n\nWe can choose H=10.\n\nSo for Alice, actions from turn 26 to 35 (10 actions).\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 26: R\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: I\nTurn 29: R\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: I\nTurn 32: R\nTurn 33: R\nTurn 34: R\nTurn 35: U\n\nBut at turn 35, she is at (6,2), holding nothing, and the onion at (6,4) is still there.\n\nThen she can be in position to get it.\n\nBob should have put his onion by turn 33, so the pot has two onions. Then when Alice gets the third, she can put it.\n\nBut we only planned until turn 35.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan until she gets the third onion.\n\nBut for the answer, we'll output the above.\n\nBut let's make sure about the move to (6,2) at turn 35: (6,2) is empty? Yes, as per earlier.\n\nSo this is a partial plan.\n\nTo maximize reward, we need the soup to be cooked and delivered, but that requires more turns.\n\nGiven the constraints, we output Alice's actions for the next 10 turns as above.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: R\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: I\nTurn 29: R\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: I\nTurn 32: R\nTurn 33: R\nTurn 34: R\nTurn 35: U\n}\n\nThis gets Alice to (6,2) by turn 35, ready to go up to (6,3) and get the onion from (6,4) in the following turns.\n\nAnd we assume Bob will have put his onion in the pot by then.\n\nSo the pot will have two onions, and Alice will get the third.\n\nThen after turn 35, she can continue to get the third onion and put it.\n\nBut beyond our plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob must collaborate to prepare and deliver a 3-onion soup, which requires collecting three onions, placing them in a pot, cooking for 5 turns, and then delivering the cooked soup. Given the current game state at turn 26, the following actions for Alice are planned to efficiently gather ingredients and fill the pot at (3,0), while assuming Bob will handle the onion at (7,1) and contribute to the same pot. Alice will first pick up the onion from (2,2), place it in the pot, then head toward (6,4) to collect the third onion.\n\n### Key Coordination Assumptions:\n- **Bob's Role**: Bob is expected to pick up the onion from (7,1) and deliver it to the pot at (3,0) by around turn 33. This is feasible based on Bob's position (6,2) and orientation (U), allowing him to move down to (6,1), face right, interact to grab the onion, and then move left to (3,1) to deposit it.\n- **Pot Usage**: Both players should use the same pot (3,0) to consolidate ingredients. After Alice's first onion (turn 31) and Bob's onion (expected by turn 33), the pot will have two onions. Alice will then retrieve the third onion from (6,4) to complete the recipe.\n- **Pathing**: Alice's path avoids conflicts with Bob. After placing her first onion, she moves right toward (6,4), while Bob moves left to the pot. By turn 35, Alice reaches (6,2), positioning her to collect the third onion in subsequent turns.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 26 to 35):\n- **Turn 26**: Move right (R) to (2,1) to approach the onion at (2,2).\n- **Turn 27**: Change orientation to up (U) to face the kitchen counter at (2,2).\n- **Turn 28**: Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (2,2).\n- **Turn 29**: Move right (R) to (3,1) to approach the pot at (3,0).\n- **Turn 30**: Change orientation to down (D) to face the pot.\n- **Turn 31**: Interact (I) to place the onion in the pot at (3,0). The pot now has one onion (plus Bob's expected contribution soon).\n- **Turn 32**: Move right (R) to (4,1) to start heading toward the third onion at (6,4).\n- **Turn 33**: Move right (R) to (5,1), continuing the path.\n- **Turn 34**: Move right (R) to (6,1), nearing (6,4).\n- **Turn 35**: Move up (U) to (6,2), positioning to access the onion at (6,4) in future turns.\n\n### Expected Outcome by Turn 35:\n- Alice is at (6,2), holding nothing, ready to move up to (6,3) and interact with the onion at (6,4).\n- Bob should have delivered the onion from (7,1) to the pot by turn 33, giving the pot two onions.\n- Alice can then collect the third onion (turn 36 onwards), place it in the pot (around turn 46), and the soup will cook for 5 turns. Delivery can occur once cooked, using the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nThis plan optimizes coordination by leveraging existing onions on counters, minimizing redundant movements, and assuming Bob's cooperation. The pot will start cooking with three onions by turn 46, yielding a reward of 20 upon delivery.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: R\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: I\nTurn 29: R\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: I\nTurn 32: R\nTurn 33: R\nTurn 34: R\nTurn 35: U\n}",

We need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) for the next several turns (H turns) to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nGiven the environment and current state:\n\n- **Tile Types**:\n  - Kitchen Counters at various positions, some of which have onions: (2,2) has an onion, (6,4) has an onion, (7,1) has an onion.\n  - Onion Dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n  - Plate Dispenser at (0,2).\n  - Pots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n  - Serving Counter at (7,2).\n\n- **Recipe Information**:\n  - Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward: 20; cooking time: 5 turns.\n\n- **Current Game State**:\n  - Turn: 29\n  - Alice (you):\n    - Position: (1,2)\n    - Orientation: R (right)\n    - Holding: nothing\n    - Action History: U, L, U, I, R (most recent last: so last action was R)\n  - Bob:\n    - Position: (4,3)\n    - Orientation: L (left)\n    - Holding: nothing\n    - Action History: I, U, U, L, L (most recent last: last two actions were L, L)\n\n- **Non-empty Kitchen Counters**:\n  - (2,2): onion\n  - (6,4): onion\n  - (7,1): onion\n\n- **Pots**: Both are empty.\n\nObjective: We want to deliver as many soups as possible. The only recipe we can make is with 3 onions. Since there are onions already on kitchen counters, we can use those to avoid going to the dispenser every time.\n\nPlan:\n\nWe need to fill a pot with 3 onions, let it cook (which takes 5 turns), and then serve it. We have two pots, so we can potentially cook two soups simultaneously.\n\nHowever, note that the pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The serving counter is at (7,2). We also have a plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nSteps for one soup:\n\n1. Get three onions (either from dispensers or from kitchen counters that have onions).\n2. Put each onion into a pot until the pot has 3 onions (which will start cooking immediately when the third is added).\n3. Wait for the cooking (5 turns) - during this time, we can prepare for the next soup or get plates.\n4. Get a plate (from the plate dispenser at (0,2) or from a kitchen counter if one is available, but currently none have plates).\n5. Once the soup is cooked, use the plate to serve the soup from the pot (by interacting with the pot while holding a plate).\n6. Deliver the soup to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nBut note: we have onions already on counters at (2,2), (6,4), and (7,1). We can use these to save time.\n\nLet's assign tasks:\n\nAlice is at (1,2). She is close to:\n  - The plate dispenser at (0,2) is adjacent to her left? (1,2) to (0,2) is left. But note: she is facing right. So she would need to turn left to face the plate dispenser? Actually, she is at (1,2) and the plate dispenser is at (0,2). So she is adjacent to the west. She is facing right (east) so she is not facing the plate dispenser. She would need to turn left (to face west) and then interact.\n\nAlternatively, she can pick up the onion at (2,2) which is adjacent to her? (1,2) to (2,2) is one step to the right. She is facing right, so she is facing (2,2). So she can move right to (2,2) and then interact? But note: (2,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. She can pick up the onion if she is adjacent and facing it.\n\nBut wait: to interact, she must be on an adjacent empty tile and facing the tile. (2,2) is a kitchen counter. The adjacent tiles are (1,2) (west), (2,1) (south), (2,3) (north), (3,2) (east). So Alice is at (1,2) which is adjacent to (2,2) to the east? Actually, (1,2) is west of (2,2). So to face (2,2), Alice must be facing east (which she is). And (1,2) is an empty tile? We don't have a list of empty tiles, but we know that players can only stand on empty tiles. So (1,2) is empty. Therefore, Alice can interact from (1,2) facing east to (2,2) and pick up the onion.\n\nSo:\n\nAlice at (1,2) facing east: she can interact to pick up the onion from (2,2).\n\nBob is at (4,3) facing left (west). He is near the onion dispensers? (3,4) and (4,4) are below him? (4,3) is above (4,4). So to get to (4,4), he can move down. But note: he is facing west. He can move down? But he is facing west, so he can change orientation or move.\n\nAlternatively, there is an onion at (6,4) and (7,1). Bob is at (4,3). He can go to (6,4) or (7,1) to pick up an onion.\n\nBut note: we need three onions for a pot. We have three onions on counters. So we can use those without going to the dispensers.\n\nLet's collect the available onions:\n\n- (2,2): onion (close to Alice)\n- (6,4): onion (closer to Bob? Bob is at (4,3): he can go to (4,4) then to (5,4) then to (6,4). But note: (5,4) is a kitchen counter? Yes, but it is empty? The non-empty ones are listed, so (5,4) is empty? Actually, the non-empty kitchen counters are only the three we listed. So (5,4) is an empty kitchen counter? But we can walk on empty tiles, and kitchen counters are walkable? Actually, the rules say: players can only stand on empty tiles. And kitchen counters are non-empty when they have an item? But the tile type is kitchen counter. The rule says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" -> but note: non-empty tiles are defined as having an item? Actually, the tile itself is a type. The rule says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile\" meaning a tile that has an item? Or the tile that is not of type empty? The rule says: \"if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile\". So the tile being interacted with must be non-empty (meaning it has an item? or it is a dispenser, pot, etc.?). Actually, the tile types are fixed: dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters are non-empty? But the rule says \"non-empty tile\" in the context of interaction. And kitchen counters can be empty or occupied.\n\nBut for walking: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" -> non-empty tiles meaning tiles that are not of type \"Empty Tile\"? Because the tile types are: empty, dispenser, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter. The rule says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then for the others, they are not walkable? Actually, the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as? The rule says: \"non-empty tiles\" in the context of interaction? But for movement, it says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and then in the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\".\n\nI think \"non-empty tiles\" for movement refers to tiles that are not empty? So only empty tiles are walkable. But then how do we interact with dispensers, etc.? We stand on an adjacent empty tile. So all the dispensers, pots, counters are not walkable. Therefore, the grid has:\n\n- Only empty tiles are walkable.\n- Other tiles (dispensers, pots, counters) are not walkable, but we can interact with them from adjacent empty tiles.\n\nTherefore, (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so it is not walkable. Alice is at (1,2) (which is an empty tile) and adjacent to (2,2) to the east. She is facing east, so she can interact to pick up the onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (4,3) is on an empty tile. He is adjacent to (4,4) to the south? (4,4) is an onion dispenser? But we don't need to go to the dispenser because we have onions on counters. However, (4,3) is adjacent to (3,3) to the west? But (3,3) is not mentioned. What is at (3,3)? We don't have the full grid, but we know the positions of non-empty counters and dispensers. We can assume that (3,3) is an empty tile? But we don't have a map. We have to rely on the given tile types.\n\nActually, the given tile types only list specific coordinates. So we can assume that any coordinate not listed as a non-empty tile (dispenser, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter) is either an empty tile or a wall? But the problem doesn't specify walls. We have to assume that the grid is as described.\n\nGiven the kitchen counters are at specific positions, and dispensers, etc., we can assume that the rest are empty tiles? Not necessarily: the rules say there are empty tiles. But we don't have a full grid. We have to work with the information given.\n\nWe know that (2,2) is a kitchen counter and it has an onion. So Alice can pick it up from (1,2) by interacting (since she is adjacent and facing east).\n\nSimilarly, the onion at (7,1): Bob is at (4,3). How can he get to (7,1)? He would need to move to (4,2), then (5,2) (which is a kitchen counter? The list says kitchen counter at (5,2) -> but we don't know if it has an item? The non-empty ones are only the three listed. So (5,2) is a kitchen counter without an item? Then it is non-walkable? So Bob cannot walk on (5,2). How to get to (7,1)? We need to know the grid.\n\nThis is a problem. We don't have a full grid. We have to assume that the only non-empty tiles (non-walkable) are the ones listed in the tile types? But note: the tile types list all the kitchen counters, dispensers, pots, serving counters. So any coordinate not in that list is an empty tile? But the kitchen counters are listed as a set, so even if they are empty, they are still kitchen counters and non-walkable? The rule says: players can only stand on empty tiles. So kitchen counters are not empty tiles -> they are non-walkable.\n\nTherefore, the grid has:\n\n- Empty tiles: not listed in any of the non-empty tile types? Actually, the tile types are given as sets. So we can assume that any coordinate not in any of those sets is an empty tile.\n\nBut we don't have the entire grid. We know:\n\n- Kitchen Counters: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)]\n\n- Onion Dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\nSo for example, (1,2) is not in any of these, so it is an empty tile. Similarly, (4,3) is not in any, so empty. (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n\nNow, let's find a path for Bob to (7,1). (7,1) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable). We need to stand on an adjacent empty tile and face it. Adjacent tiles to (7,1): (7,0) is a kitchen counter, (7,2) is a serving counter, (6,1) is not listed? Let's see:\n\n- (6,1): not in any list? So it's an empty tile? Similarly, (8,1) is out of bounds? We assume the grid is 8x5? From the coordinates, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4.\n\nSo adjacent to (7,1): \n- West: (6,1) -> not in any list -> empty tile.\n- North: (7,2) -> serving counter -> non-walkable.\n- South: (7,0) -> kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n- East: out of bounds? (assuming grid is 0-7 in x, 0-4 in y)\n\nSo the only adjacent empty tile to (7,1) is (6,1). Bob at (4,3) can move to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, listed -> non-walkable. So he cannot go to (4,2). He can go to (3,3)? Not listed -> empty. Then to (2,3)? Not listed -> empty. Then to (1,3)? Not listed -> empty. Then to (0,3) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. Alternatively, he can go down to (4,4)? (4,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-walkable. So he cannot step on (4,4). He must go around.\n\nPossible path for Bob to (6,1):\n\n(4,3) -> (5,3) [if empty? not listed -> empty] -> (6,3) [empty?] -> (6,2) [empty?] -> (6,1) [empty].\n\nCheck:\n\n- (5,3): not listed -> empty\n- (6,3): not listed -> empty\n- (6,2): not listed -> empty? But (6,0) is kitchen counter, (6,4) is kitchen counter -> so (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) are not listed -> empty.\n\nSo Bob can move: right (east) to (5,3), then down to (5,2) is kitchen counter -> cannot. So he must go (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1). Then from (6,1) he can face east to interact with (7,1) (the kitchen counter with onion).\n\nBut (6,1) is adjacent to (7,1) to the east. So he must face east to interact.\n\nSimilarly, for the onion at (6,4): (6,4) is a kitchen counter with onion. Adjacent empty tiles: (6,3) (north), (5,4) (west) -> but (5,4) is a kitchen counter? Yes, and non-walkable. (7,4) is kitchen counter. (6,5) out of bounds. So only (6,3) is adjacent? (6,3) is above (6,4). So Bob at (4,3) can go to (5,3) -> (6,3) and then face south to interact with (6,4).\n\nBut note: (6,4) has an onion, so he can pick it up from (6,3) by facing south.\n\nSimilarly, Alice is at (1,2) and can pick up the onion at (2,2) by interacting (facing east).\n\nWe have three onions: one at (2,2), one at (6,4), one at (7,1). We can use all three for one pot? But note: the pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). We need to bring the onions to the pot.\n\nPlan for one soup:\n\n1. Alice picks up the onion at (2,2) from (1,2) by interacting (I). Then she can move to the pot at (3,0) or (4,0) to put it in.\n\nHow to get to (3,0)? Alice at (1,2) holding an onion.\n\nPath: (1,2) -> (1,1) [if empty?] -> (1,0) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she cannot go down to (1,1) if it's empty? We don't know (1,1). Not listed -> empty. Then (1,0) is adjacent, but non-walkable. So she must go east? (2,2) is non-walkable. She can go to (0,2): plate dispenser -> non-walkable. So from (1,2), she can go north? (1,3) -> not listed -> empty. Then (1,4) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she can go to (1,3) [empty] then to (2,3) [empty]? Then to (3,3) [empty]? Then down to (3,2) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she can go to (3,3) -> (4,3) -> but Bob is at (4,3) at the moment? And players cannot walk through each other.\n\nAlternatively, she can go east to (2,2) is blocked, so she must go north to (1,3) then east to (2,3) then east to (3,3) then south to (3,2) is blocked? (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she cannot go south from (3,3) to (3,2). Then how to get to (3,0)? She must go via (4,3) -> (5,3) -> etc. But that is long.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,2) she can go down to (1,1) [empty]? Then east to (2,1) [if empty]? Then east to (3,1) [empty?] then south to (3,0) is pot -> non-walkable. So she can stand on (3,1) and face south to interact with the pot at (3,0).\n\nSimilarly for (4,0): she can stand on (4,1) and face south.\n\nSo let's assume:\n\nAlice at (1,2) -> move down to (1,1) [if empty? We assume it is] -> then move right to (2,1) [empty] -> then right to (3,1) [empty]. Now at (3,1), she is adjacent to the pot at (3,0) to the south. She faces south and interacts to put the onion in the pot.\n\nBut note: she is holding an onion, so putting it in the pot is valid.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can pick up the onion at (6,4) or (7,1). Which one is closer? Bob is at (4,3). \n\nTo (6,4): \n- He can move to (5,3) [empty] -> (6,3) [empty]. Then at (6,3), he can face south to interact with (6,4) to pick up the onion. Then he needs to go to a pot. The pot at (4,0) is closer? He can go from (6,3) to (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) is blocked -> so he must go (4,3) to (4,4) is dispenser -> blocked. So he must go (6,3) to (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) [empty] -> (3,2) is blocked -> then (3,3) to (3,4) is dispenser? (3,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-walkable. So he can go to (3,3) -> (2,3) [empty] -> (1,3) [empty] -> (0,3) is kitchen counter -> blocked. Or from (3,3) to (3,2) is blocked. How to get to (3,0)? He can go to (3,1) via? (3,3) -> (3,2) blocked. Alternative: (4,3) -> (4,2) blocked -> so he must go around? (6,3) to (6,2) [empty] -> (6,1) [empty] -> (5,1) [empty?] -> (4,1) [empty] -> then at (4,1) he can face south to interact with pot at (4,0).\n\nSo Bob at (4,3) -> move to (5,3) -> (6,3) [now at (6,3)] -> interact (facing south) to pick up onion from (6,4). Then move to (6,2) [down? from (6,3) to (6,2) is south] -> (6,1) -> (5,1) [if empty] -> (4,1). Then at (4,1) face south to put onion in pot at (4,0).\n\nBut note: we have two pots. We can use both.\n\nHowever, we have three onions. We can put two in one pot and one in another? But we need three in one pot to start cooking. So we should focus on one pot first.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the three available onions to fill one pot.\n\nSo:\n\n- Alice picks up the onion at (2,2) and brings it to pot at (3,0).\n- Bob picks up the onion at (7,1) and brings it to pot at (3,0) or (4,0). Let's choose (3,0) to fill one pot faster.\n- Then we need a third onion. The one at (6,4) or (7,1)? Bob is going to (7,1) first? Or we can have Alice get two onions? But she can only carry one at a time.\n\nSo:\n\nStep 1: Alice picks up the onion at (2,2) from (1,2) by interacting (I). Then she moves to (3,1) to put it in pot (3,0).\n\nStep 2: Bob picks up the onion at (7,1) by going to (6,1) and facing east to interact. Then he moves to (3,1) to put it in the same pot? But (3,1) is occupied by Alice? They can't be on the same tile. And (3,1) is only one tile. So they must coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can put it in the other pot at (4,0). But then we have two pots with one onion each, which doesn't start cooking.\n\nSo we need to bring all three to one pot. How?\n\nAfter Alice puts her onion in pot (3,0), she can go get another onion. The next closest onion is at (7,1) or (6,4). But Bob is going for one of them.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can get two onions? He can only carry one at a time.\n\nSo let's assign:\n\n- Alice: picks up onion at (2,2) and puts it in pot (3,0).\n- Bob: picks up onion at (6,4) and puts it in pot (3,0) or (4,0). But if he puts in (4,0), then we have two pots with one onion each -> not good.\n\nBetter: both put in the same pot. But they cannot be at the same tile at the same time.\n\nSo we choose pot (3,0). Alice puts first onion. Then Bob comes and puts his onion. Then someone (Alice or Bob) gets the third onion.\n\nBut after Alice puts her onion, she is at (3,1). She can then move to get the third onion. The third onion is at (7,1) or (6,4) or (7,1) is still available.\n\nThe onions are on counters: (2,2) will be taken by Alice, (6,4) by Bob, and (7,1) remains.\n\nSo after Alice puts her onion, she can go to (7,1) to get the third onion.\n\nBut the path from (3,1) to (7,1): \n(3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1). Then at (6,1) face east to interact with (7,1) to get the onion. Then she must return to (3,1) to put it in the pot.\n\nBob, after putting his onion (from (6,4)) into the pot, can also go for the third onion? But it might be faster for Alice to do it if she is closer? But Alice is at (3,1) and Bob is at (4,1) (after putting his onion in the pot at (3,0)? Or he might be at (4,1) if he puts in (4,0)? Let's decide to use only one pot for now.\n\nLet's use pot (3,0) for the first soup.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Alice at (1,2): I (to pick up onion from (2,2)). Now holding onion.\n   - Then she moves: D (to (1,1)) -> R (to (2,1)) -> R (to (3,1)). Then at (3,1) facing? She was at (2,1) and moved right to (3,1), so facing east. She needs to face south to interact with pot (3,0). So she must change orientation to D (south) then I.\n   - Actions: I, D, R, R, D (change orientation to face south), I.\n\nBut note: after moving to (3,1), she is facing east. To interact with (3,0) which is south, she must face south. So she can do: after moving to (3,1), then turn south (D) then interact (I).\n\n2. Bob at (4,3): he can go to (5,3) -> (6,3) -> then at (6,3) face south (D) to interact with (6,4) to pick up onion. Then he needs to go to (3,1) to put it in the pot. But Alice is at (3,1) at this time? We need to sequence.\n\n   Bob's actions: \n   - Move R to (5,3) [from (4,3) to (5,3): R]\n   - Move D to (6,3)? No, (5,3) to (6,3) is R. So: R (to (5,3)), R (to (6,3)).\n   - Then change orientation to D (south) and I to pick up onion from (6,4). Now holding onion.\n   - Then he needs to go to (3,1). Path: from (6,3) to (6,2) (D) -> (6,1) (D) -> (5,1) (L) -> (4,1) (L) -> (3,1) (L). But at (3,1), Alice is already there? And they cannot occupy the same tile.\n\nWe must avoid that.\n\nSo after Alice puts her onion, she should move away to let Bob put his.\n\nAlice's sequence:\n\nTurn 29: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\nTurn 30: D (to (1,1))\nTurn 31: R (to (2,1))\nTurn 32: R (to (3,1)) [now at (3,1) facing east]\nTurn 33: D (change orientation to south) [still at (3,1), facing south]\nTurn 34: I (put onion in pot (3,0)) [now pot has 1 onion, Alice holds nothing]\n\nThen Alice should move away. For example, she can move to (4,1) to free up (3,1) for Bob.\n\nTurn 35: R (to (4,1)) [facing east]\n\nBob's sequence (we can plan for Bob too, but the task is to plan for Alice, and optionally Bob. But the problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both, but the answer format is for Alice only? The instruction says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", and the answer format only shows actions for Alice? Actually, the example answer format only has actions for Alice. But we need to coordinate.\n\nSince we are only required to output Alice's actions, we can assume Bob will act optimally? Or we can state what we expect Bob to do.\n\nBut to be safe, we plan only Alice's actions and assume Bob will do something reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan for Alice and suggest what Bob should do, but the output is only Alice's actions.\n\nSo for Alice, after she puts the onion and moves to (4,1), she can then go to get the third onion.\n\nThe third onion is at (7,1) or (6,4) but (6,4) will be taken by Bob. So (7,1) is available.\n\nAlice at (4,1) can go to (5,1) -> (6,1). Then at (6,1) face east to interact with (7,1) to get the onion. Then she must go back to (3,1) to put it in the pot.\n\nBut note: after she moves to (4,1) at turn 35, then:\n\nTurn 36: R (to (5,1))\nTurn 37: R (to (6,1)) [facing east]\nTurn 38: I (pick up onion from (7,1)) [now holding onion]\nTurn 39: L (to (5,1))? Wait, (6,1) to (5,1) is west, so L if facing west? She is facing east after moving to (6,1). So she can change orientation to west (L) then move west? Or move west without changing orientation? The move actions are L/R/U/D which change position and orientation. Specifically, L: (x-1, y) and orientation left. So if she moves L from (6,1), she goes to (5,1) and faces left.\n\nSo:\nTurn 39: L (to (5,1), facing west)\nTurn 40: L (to (4,1), facing west)\nTurn 41: L (to (3,1), facing west) [now at (3,1) facing west]\nTurn 42: D (change orientation to south) [facing south]\nTurn 43: I (put onion in pot (3,0)) [now pot has 3 onions, cooking starts]\n\nBut at turn 34, the pot had one onion (from Alice). Then Bob should have put his onion around the same time? But we don't control Bob.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can get the third onion immediately after her first delivery, but Bob might be on the way.\n\nTo minimize time, it might be better for Alice to get the third onion while Bob is bringing his.\n\nBut we must avoid blocking.\n\nLet's estimate Bob's actions:\n\nBob at (4,3) at turn 29.\n\nTurn 29: R (to (5,3))\nTurn 30: R (to (6,3))\nTurn 31: D (change orientation to south) [or can he interact without changing orientation? He is at (6,3) and the onion is at (6,4) south. He is facing east? After moving to (6,3) by two R moves, he is facing east. So he must turn south (D) then interact.\nTurn 32: I (pick up onion)\nThen he needs to go to (3,1) to put it in the pot. But at turn 32, Alice is at (3,1)? Alice's turn 32: she is at (3,1) and then at turn 33 she turns south, turn 34 interacts. So at turn 32, Alice is at (3,1). Bob is at (6,3) holding onion. He moves:\nTurn 33: D (to (6,2)) [facing south? Move D: goes down and faces down]\nTurn 34: D (to (6,1)) [facing down]\nTurn 35: L (to (5,1), facing left)\nTurn 36: L (to (4,1), facing left) -> but at turn 36, Alice is at (4,1)? Alice's turn 35: she moves to (4,1). So at turn 36, Alice is at (4,1) and Bob wants to move to (4,1)? Conflict.\n\nSo at turn 36, Bob cannot move to (4,1) because Alice is there.\n\nWe need to coordinate.\n\nAfter Alice puts the onion at turn 34, she moves to (4,1) at turn 35. Then at turn 36, she moves to (5,1). Then Bob can move to (4,1) at turn 36.\n\nBob's turn 35: he is at (5,1) facing left? Let's see:\n\nBob:\nTurn 33: move D to (6,2)\nTurn 34: move D to (6,1) [facing down]\nTurn 35: move L to (5,1) [facing left]\nTurn 36: move L to (4,1) [facing left] -> now at (4,1) at turn 36.\n\nBut at turn 36, Alice is also moving to (5,1) from (4,1) (Alice turn 36: R to (5,1)). So they cross: Alice from (4,1) to (5,1) and Bob from (5,1) to (4,1) at the same turn? Is that allowed? The rules don't say explicitly, but typically in such games, players move simultaneously? Or sequentially? The problem doesn't specify the order of player actions. We must assume that actions are taken simultaneously.\n\nSo if both move in the same turn, they might swap positions without conflict? Or they might block if they try to move to the same tile. In this case, Alice moves from (4,1) to (5,1) and Bob moves from (5,1) to (4,1). That is a swap. Typically in Overcooked, players can swap by moving through each other? But the constraint says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" So they cannot occupy the same tile, but swapping might be allowed if the game allows passing. However, the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" So if Alice is at (4,1) and Bob at (5,1), and both move towards each other, they would end up on the same tile? Or the move fails? The rule doesn't specify. To be safe, we should avoid this.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can wait a turn.\n\nBut we are only controlling Alice. So we can have Alice at turn 36 do something else.\n\nAfter Alice is at (4,1) at turn 35, instead of moving east at turn 36, she can move up or down? But she needs to go east to get the onion at (7,1).\n\nShe can wait at (4,1) for Bob to pass.\n\nAlice's turn 36: Stay (S) so that Bob can move to (4,1) at his turn 36.\n\nThen Alice turn 37: move R to (5,1)\n\nThen Bob can then from (4,1) move to (3,1) at his turn 37, then turn south and interact to put onion.\n\nBob's sequence:\n\nTurn 36: move L to (4,1)\nTurn 37: move L to (3,1) [facing left]\nTurn 38: D (turn south)\nTurn 39: I (put onion in pot (3,0)) [now pot has 2 onions]\n\nThen Alice is on her way to get the third onion.\n\nAlice at turn 37: R to (5,1)\nTurn 38: R to (6,1)\nTurn 39: I (facing east to interact with (7,1)) [picks up onion]\nTurn 40: L (to (5,1)) [facing west]\nTurn 41: L (to (4,1)) [facing west]\nTurn 42: L (to (3,1)) [facing west]\nTurn 43: D (turn south)\nTurn 44: I (put onion in pot (3,0)) [now 3 onions, cooking starts at turn 44]\n\nThen the soup will be ready at turn 44 + 5 = turn 49.\n\nMeanwhile, after Bob puts his onion at turn 39, he can go to get a plate or another onion for the next soup.\n\nBut we are planning for Alice.\n\nSo far, we have used two of the three available onions. We have one more at (7,1) but Alice took it. The onions on counters were three: (2,2), (6,4), (7,1). All used.\n\nNow, after the soup is cooking, we need to serve it.\n\nWe need a plate. The plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nAlice is at (3,1) after putting the third onion. She can go to get a plate.\n\nPath: (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) [empty] -> then at (1,2) she can face west to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nThen she needs to be at (3,1) to interact with the pot (3,0) to serve the soup (by using the plate), then deliver to (7,2).\n\nBut the soup won't be ready until turn 49. So she has time.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can get the plate.\n\nBut since we are planning Alice, we can have Alice do it.\n\nAfter turn 44, Alice is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can go to (1,2) to get a plate.\n\nActions:\nTurn 45: L (to (2,1)) [facing west]\nTurn 46: L (to (1,1)) [facing west]\nTurn 47: U (to (1,2)) [facing up? Move U: goes to (1,2) and faces up? But she was facing west. Move U: changes orientation to up and moves up. So at (1,2) facing up.\nThen she needs to face west to interact with (0,2). So:\nTurn 48: L (change orientation to left/west) [still at (1,2)]\nTurn 49: I (grab plate) [now holding plate]\n\nThen she must go back to (3,1) to serve the soup. But the soup is ready at turn 49. So at turn 49, she grabs the plate, then moves to (3,1).\n\nTurn 50: R (to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she must go: from (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1).\nTurn 50: D (to (1,1)) [facing down]\nTurn 51: R (to (2,1)) [facing right]\nTurn 52: R (to (3,1)) [facing right]\nTurn 53: D (turn south)\nTurn 54: I (serve the soup from pot (3,0)) [now holding a soup in plate]\n\nThen deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,2): \n(3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) [empty] -> (7,2) is serving counter. She can stand at (6,2) and face east to interact with (7,2) to deliver.\n\nBut (6,2) is not listed in any non-empty tile? So it's empty and walkable.\n\nActions:\nTurn 55: R (to (4,1)) [facing right]\nTurn 56: R (to (5,1)) [facing right]\nTurn 57: R (to (6,1)) [facing right]\nTurn 58: U (to (6,2)) [facing up]\nTurn 59: R (change orientation to right? Or move? She needs to face east to interact with (7,2). So at (6,2) she can turn right (R) to face east.\nTurn 60: I (deliver soup) -> reward 20.\n\nThis is a long sequence. We are at turn 60.\n\nBut we also have Bob who can help. For example, Bob can get the plate earlier.\n\nSince the task is to maximize reward, and we have two pots, we can start a second soup.\n\nBut we used all three available onions. We need to get more onions from the dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nBob is free after turn 39. He can get more onions.\n\nBut we are only planning for Alice, and for a limited horizon H. The problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H. Let's say H=20 turns, so up to turn 49.\n\nBut we want to deliver as many as possible.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's focus on getting one soup delivered as fast as possible with Alice's actions.\n\nWe have to output Alice's actions from turn 29 onward.\n\nLet's summarize a plan for Alice:\n\nTurn 29: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\nTurn 30: D (to (1,1))\nTurn 31: R (to (2,1))\nTurn 32: R (to (3,1))\nTurn 33: D (turn south)\nTurn 34: I (put onion in pot (3,0))\nTurn 35: R (to (4,1))   [free up (3,1) for Bob]\nTurn 36: S (stay to let Bob move to (4,1)? Or we can assume Bob will wait and we don't need to stay. But to avoid potential conflict, we can stay one turn.\nTurn 36: S\nThen at turn 37, she can move to (5,1)\nBut Bob might be moving to (4,1) at turn 36, so if Alice stays at (4,1) at turn 36, then at turn 37 she can move to (5,1) while Bob moves to (3,1).\n\nAlternatively, without staying:\n\nTurn 35: R (to (4,1))\nTurn 36: R (to (5,1))\nTurn 37: R (to (6,1))\nTurn 38: I (pick up onion from (7,1)) [facing east? At (6,1) after moving right, she is facing east. So she can interact to pick up onion from (7,1).]\nTurn 39: L (to (5,1)) [facing west]\nTurn 40: L (to (4,1)) [facing west]\nTurn 41: L (to (3,1)) [facing west]\nTurn 42: D (turn south)\nTurn 43: I (put onion in pot (3,0)) [now 3 onions, cooking starts at turn 43]\n\nThen she can go for a plate.\n\nTurn 44: U (turn north) [still at (3,1), now facing north? Or move? She is at (3,1) facing south after interact. To move, she can change orientation or move. But to leave, she can move north to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she must move west or east. \nFrom (3,1), she can move west to (2,1). She is facing south, so to move west, she can turn west or move west. Move L: would go to (2,1) and face west.\n\nTurn 44: L ( to (2,1), facing west)\nTurn 45: L ( to (1,1), facing west)\nTurn 46: U ( to (1,2), facing north)\nTurn 47: L (turn west to face the plate dispenser at (0,2))\nTurn 48: I (grab plate)\nThen the soup will be ready at turn 43 + 5 = turn 48. So at turn 48, the soup is ready, and Alice is at (1,2) grabbing a plate.\n\nThen she must go back to the pot.\n\nTurn 49: D ( to (1,1), facing down)\nTurn 50: R ( to (2,1), facing right)\nTurn 51: R ( to (3,1), facing right)\nTurn 52: D (turn south)\nTurn 53: I (serve soup, now holding soup in plate)\n\nThen deliver to (7,2):\n\nTurn 54: R ( to (4,1), facing right)\nTurn 55: R ( to (5,1), facing right)\nTurn 56: R ( to (6,1), facing right)\nTurn 57: U ( to (6,2), facing up)\nTurn 58: R (turn east to face (7,2))\nTurn 59: I (deliver soup)\n\nThis is up to turn 59.\n\nBut we might want to have Bob help with the delivery to save time.\n\nSince the horizon is not fixed, we can output until turn 49 or so.\n\nBut the task says to maximize reward, and we are at turn 29, and the first soup is delivered at turn 59, which is 30 turns later. We might be able to do better.\n\nAlternatively, after the pot has 3 onions, Alice can immediately go for a plate while the soup is cooking, which is what we did.\n\nBut we can start the second soup with Bob.\n\nHowever, for the answer, we output Alice's actions for the next H turns. Let's choose H=20, so turns 29 to 48.\n\nSo from turn 29 to turn 48 (20 actions).\n\nWe have:\n\nTurn 29: I\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: R\nTurn 32: R\nTurn 33: D  (change orientation to south)\nTurn 34: I  (put first onion)\nTurn 35: R  (to (4,1))\nTurn 36: R  (to (5,1))\nTurn 37: R  (to (6,1))\nTurn 38: I  (pick up onion from (7,1))\nTurn 39: L  (to (5,1))\nTurn 40: L  (to (4,1))\nTurn 41: L  (to (3,1))\nTurn 42: D  (turn south)\nTurn 43: I  (put third onion, cooking starts)\nTurn 44: L  (to (2,1))\nTurn 45: L  (to (1,1))\nTurn 46: U  (to (1,2))\nTurn 47: L  (turn west)\nTurn 48: I  (grab plate)\n\nAt turn 48, she has a plate, and the soup is ready (since cooking started at turn 43, ready at turn 48). Then she can serve it in the next turns, but we stop at turn 48.\n\nSo this is 20 actions.\n\nWe must output in the format.\n\nBut note: at turn 33, the action is 'D' to change orientation to south. Then at turn 34, 'I' to interact.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 42, 'D' to change orientation, then 'I' at 43.\n\nAlso, at turn 47, 'L' to change orientation, then 'I' at 48.\n\nThis seems reasonable.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: I\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: R\nTurn 32: R\nTurn 33: D\nTurn 34: I\nTurn 35: R\nTurn 36: R\nTurn 37: R\nTurn 38: I\nTurn 39: L\nTurn 40: L\nTurn 41: L\nTurn 42: D\nTurn 43: I\nTurn 44: L\nTurn 45: L\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: L\nTurn 48: I\n}\n\nThis gets the onion from (2,2), puts it in the pot, then gets the onion from (7,1) and puts it in the pot (after Bob has put one, we assume), then goes to get a plate. The soup will be ready to serve at turn 48, and she has the plate, so she can serve in the next turn.\n\nWe assume Bob has put one onion in the pot between turns 34 and 43.\n\nIf Bob doesn't, then the pot would have only two onions when Alice puts the third. But in our plan, we have Alice put the first and the third. Bob should put the second. We hope he does.\n\nTo make it more robust, we could have Alice get two onions, but that might be slower.\n\nGiven the constraints, this is a plan for Alice.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should collaborate to prepare and deliver a 3-onion soup (reward: 20) as efficiently as possible. The current state shows three onions available on kitchen counters at (2,2), (6,4), and (7,1), and both pots are empty. Alice is near the onion at (2,2), while Bob is closer to the onions at (6,4) and (7,1). The plan focuses on Alice collecting the onion at (2,2) and (7,1), while Bob collects the onion at (6,4) to fill the pot at (3,0). Once the pot has 3 onions, cooking starts automatically (5 turns). Alice will then fetch a plate from (0,2) to serve and deliver the soup.\n\n### Optimized Plan for Alice (Turns 29-48, 20 Actions):\n- **Turns 29-34**: Alice picks up the onion at (2,2) and delivers it to the pot at (3,0). She interacts to grab the onion, moves to (3,1), faces south, and interacts to deposit it.\n- **Turns 35-38**: Alice moves to (6,1) and picks up the onion at (7,1) (Bob is expected to deposit the onion from (6,4) at the pot during this time).\n- **Turns 39-43**: Alice returns to (3,1) and deposits the third onion into the pot (cooking starts at turn 43).\n- **Turns 44-48**: Alice moves to the plate dispenser at (0,2), faces west, and grabs a plate (soup finishes cooking at turn 48, ready to serve).\n\nBob should:\n- Collect the onion at (6,4) and deposit it at (3,0) by turn 42 to ensure the pot fills efficiently.\n- After depositing, Bob can fetch another onion for a second soup or assist with serving.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: I\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: R\nTurn 32: R\nTurn 33: D\nTurn 34: I\nTurn 35: R\nTurn 36: R\nTurn 37: R\nTurn 38: I\nTurn 39: L\nTurn 40: L\nTurn 41: L\nTurn 42: D\nTurn 43: I\nTurn 44: L\nTurn 45: L\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: L\nTurn 48: I\n}\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Turn 29**: Alice (at (1,2), facing east) interacts to pick up the onion from (2,2).\n- **Turns 30-32**: Alice moves down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then right to (3,1).\n- **Turn 33**: Alice changes orientation to south (to face the pot at (3,0)).\n- **Turn 34**: Alice interacts to deposit the onion into the pot (now 1 onion).\n- **Turns 35-37**: Alice moves right to (4,1), (5,1), then (6,1) (facing east).\n- **Turn 38**: Alice interacts to pick up the onion from (7,1) (facing east).\n- **Turns 39-41**: Alice moves left to (5,1), (4,1), then (3,1) (facing west).\n- **Turn 42**: Alice changes orientation to south (to face the pot).\n- **Turn 43**: Alice interacts to deposit the onion (pot now has 3 onions; cooking starts).\n- **Turns 44-45**: Alice moves left to (2,1) then (1,1) (facing west).\n- **Turn 46**: Alice moves up to (1,2) (facing north).\n- **Turn 47**: Alice changes orientation to west (to face the plate dispenser at (0,2)).\n- **Turn 48**: Alice interacts to grab a plate (soup finishes cooking; ready to serve next turn).\n\nThis sequence ensures the soup is ready by turn 48, with Alice holding a plate to serve immediately. Bob should deposit his onion by turn 42 to avoid delays. The total reward of 20 is achievable within ~20 turns, and a second soup can be started using the remaining pot.",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 32 (t1=32). We need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice for the next several turns (H turns) to maximize the total reward. Since the problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", we are primarily controlling Alice, but we might assume Bob is cooperating and we can suggest actions for him too? However, the answer format only specifies actions for Alice. But note: the task says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". Since the answer format only shows actions for one player, and the problem says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", we should focus on Alice's actions, but we can assume Bob is acting optimally in coordination.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both? But the answer format only shows one set of actions. Let me re-read: \"Answer Format: ... Where each action a_t ...\" and it shows a sequence of actions without specifying the player. But the task says \"for Alice\". So I think we are only to output Alice's actions.\n\nBut note: the environment and state include Bob. So we must consider Bob's actions as well to avoid conflicts and to coordinate. We can assume that Bob is controlled by an optimal partner? However, we are only to output Alice's actions. So we must plan Alice's actions in anticipation of what Bob might do (based on his current state and history) to maximize the total reward.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow us to plan for both, but the answer format is ambiguous. Looking at the format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nIt doesn't specify which player. But the task says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So if we plan for both, how to represent? The problem doesn't specify. Therefore, I think we are only to output Alice's actions.\n\nBut note: the action history for both players is provided, so we can use that to model Bob's behavior. However, we don't have a model of Bob. We can assume that Bob will act optimally? Or we can try to coordinate by having Alice do actions that set up for Bob? Since we are to maximize the total reward, we must consider the team.\n\nGiven the constraints, I think the intended approach is to plan Alice's actions, but in a way that coordinates with Bob. We can assume that Bob will continue to act in a way that is cooperative (since we are both trying to maximize the total reward). So we can plan for both and then output only Alice's part? But we must output the actions for Alice.\n\nAlternatively, we might have to make assumptions about Bob's actions. However, the problem states: \"optimize coordination, planning, and decision-making based on the current game state and action history of both players.\" So we must use Bob's state and history.\n\nLet me analyze the current state:\n\n### Current State\n- Alice: (1,3), facing Up, holding nothing.\n- Bob: (3,3), facing Up, holding one onion.\n\n### Environment:\n- Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n- Pots at (3,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving counter at (7,2)\n- Kitchen counters with onions at (2,2), (6,4), (7,1)\n\n### Recipe:\nOnly one recipe: 3 onions -> 20 reward, cooks in 5 turns.\n\n### Current Pots:\nBoth pots are empty.\n\n### Goal:\nWe want to deliver as many soups as possible to get rewards. Since the recipe requires 3 onions, we need to put 3 onions in a pot, wait 5 turns, then serve with a plate.\n\n### Strategy:\nWe have two pots. We can use both. We also have onions available at dispensers and on counters.\n\nSince Bob is already holding an onion, he can put it in a pot. Alice is free and holding nothing.\n\nWe note that there are onions on counters that we can use to avoid going to the dispenser every time.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. We need to get onions into the pots. There are two pots at (3,0) and (4,0). They are currently empty.\n\n2. We can use the onions on the counters to speed up the process.\n\n3. We need plates to serve the soup. The plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nSteps:\n\n- Bob is at (3,3) holding an onion. He can move down to (3,2) and then to (3,1) and then to (3,0) to put the onion in the pot. But note: from (3,3) to (3,0) requires moving down three times. However, there might be obstacles? The grid is not fully described, but we know the non-empty tiles. The kitchen counters are at specific points. We must avoid non-empty tiles. The path from (3,3) to (3,0) is: (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (3,0). What is at (3,2)? We have a kitchen counter at (3,2) but it is non-empty? Actually, the non-empty kitchen counters are listed, but (3,2) is a kitchen counter? The tile types say kitchen counters at [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), ...]. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter. But the non-empty ones are listed: (2,2) has an onion, (6,4) has an onion, (7,1) has an onion. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter but currently empty? Because it's not listed in the non-empty section. So we can walk on (3,2) only if it's empty? Actually, players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. Since (3,2) is a kitchen counter and it's empty, it is walkable? But note: the tile type \"Kitchen Counter\" is a non-empty tile? Actually, the rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and a kitchen counter is a tile that can be occupied by an item. If it is occupied (has an item), then it is non-empty and not walkable. If it is empty, then it is walkable? The rules say: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then there are other tiles. But the rules for movement: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\" and constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if a tile is a kitchen counter and has an item, then it's non-empty and cannot be walked on. If it's empty, then it's walkable? But the tile type is still a kitchen counter, but we can walk on it when it's empty? I think so, because the rule only forbids non-empty tiles. So (3,2) is empty -> walkable.\n\nTherefore, Bob can move: D (to (3,2)), then D (to (3,1)), then D (to (3,0)). Then he can interact to put the onion in the pot at (3,0). Then he is free.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can pick up an onion from a nearby counter and put it in a pot.\n\nBut note: there is an onion at (2,2) which is adjacent to Alice? Alice is at (1,3). The counter at (2,2) is at (2,2). How to get there? From (1,3), Alice can move: R (to (2,3)), then D (to (2,2)). Then she can pick up the onion from the counter (if she is facing it and adjacent). At (2,2), she would be standing on the counter? No, because the counter is at (2,2). She must be adjacent and facing it. So she can stand at (2,3) and face down to interact with (2,2)? Or stand at (1,2) and face right? But (1,2) is not necessarily empty? We don't know the full grid. Alternatively, she can stand at (2,3) and face down to interact with (2,2). That would work because (2,3) is adjacent to (2,2) and she would be facing it.\n\nSo plan for Alice:\n\nTurn 32: Move R (to (2,3))\nTurn 33: Move D (to (2,2)) -> but wait, (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? Then it is non-empty? So she cannot walk onto it. Therefore, she must interact with it from an adjacent tile.\n\nSo better: at (1,3), she can move R to (2,3). Then at (2,3), she is adjacent to (2,2) (which is below her). So she can change orientation to D (if not already) and then interact. But note: her current orientation is U. So at (2,3), she is facing up? Then she must turn to face down to interact with (2,2).\n\nAlternatively, she can move D from (1,3) to (1,2) and then R to (2,2) but (2,2) is non-empty (has an onion) so she cannot walk on it.\n\nSo the correct way: \n- Move R to (2,3) [turn 32]\n- Then change orientation to D [turn 33] (if she is not already facing down) - currently at (2,3) she is facing? After moving R, her orientation becomes R? The move action changes orientation: when you move, you change your position and also your orientation to the direction of movement? The rules say: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when she moves R, she ends up at (2,3) facing Right. Then she is adjacent to (2,2) but not facing it (she is facing right). So she must change orientation to Down to face (2,2). Then interact.\n\nAlternatively, after moving R to (2,3), she is at (2,3) facing right. Then she can do a Change Orientation to D (turn 33), then Interact (turn 34) to pick up the onion from (2,2).\n\nBut note: the counter at (2,2) is below her. She is at (2,3) and (2,2) is directly below. So facing down is required.\n\nAfter picking up the onion, she can then move to a pot to put it. The nearest pot is at (3,0) or (4,0). From (2,3), she can move: D to (2,2) but (2,2) is now? After she picks up the onion, (2,2) becomes empty? Then she can walk on it? But note: the tile (2,2) is a kitchen counter. When it has an item, it's non-empty and cannot be walked on. When she picks up the item, it becomes empty and then walkable? The rules don't explicitly say, but typically in Overcooked, when a counter is emptied, it becomes walkable? However, the rules state: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if it becomes empty, then it's walkable. So after she picks up the onion at (2,2), the tile becomes empty and she can then walk on it? But she is at (2,3) and the counter is at (2,2). She hasn't moved onto it. To get to the pot, she can go: from (2,3) to (2,2) [if now empty] then to (2,1) then to (2,0) then to (3,0). But (2,0) is a kitchen counter? And we don't know if it's empty. The non-empty kitchen counters are listed: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) are kitchen counters, but are they empty? The non-empty ones are: (2,2) (which we are about to empty), (6,4), (7,1). So (2,0) is not listed as non-empty, so it's empty? Then walkable. So path: (2,3) -> D to (2,2) [now empty] -> D to (2,1) [what is (2,1)? We don't have any tile type listed at (2,1). It must be an empty tile?] -> D to (2,0) [kitchen counter, empty] -> R to (3,0) [pot]. Then interact to put the onion.\n\nBut note: (2,1) is not listed as any special tile, so it must be an empty tile? Yes, because the only non-empty tiles are the ones listed (dispensers, pots, counters, etc.) and the rest are empty? The tile types are: \n- Empty Tile: not listed in the others? So (2,1) is empty.\n\nAlternatively, she could go: (2,3) -> R to (3,3) -> D to (3,2) -> D to (3,1) -> D to (3,0). This path might be shorter? Because (3,0) is directly below (3,3). But at (3,3) is Bob? Bob is at (3,3) at turn 32. So if Alice moves to (3,3) at turn 32, that would conflict? Because players cannot walk through each other. So we must avoid.\n\nTherefore, the first path is better.\n\nBut let's see Bob's situation. Bob is at (3,3) holding an onion. He can start moving down to put it in the pot at (3,0). So:\n\nBob's potential actions:\nTurn 32: D (to (3,2))\nTurn 33: D (to (3,1))\nTurn 34: D (to (3,0))\nTurn 35: I (put onion in pot)\n\nNow, if Alice does:\nTurn 32: R (to (2,3)) -> now at (2,3)\nTurn 33: Change orientation to D (to face down) -> now facing D\nTurn 34: I (pick up onion from (2,2)) -> now holding onion\nTurn 35: D (to (2,2)) -> now at (2,2) [which is now empty]\nTurn 36: D (to (2,1))\nTurn 37: D (to (2,0))\nTurn 38: R (to (3,0)) -> but at (3,0) is the pot and Bob might be there? At turn 35, Bob put his onion and then he might move away? But we don't know what Bob will do. We are only controlling Alice. We must avoid conflicts.\n\nAt turn 35, Bob is at (3,0) and has just put the onion. Then he might move away. But if he stays, then at turn 38, Alice cannot move to (3,0) if Bob is there. So we need to coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can use the other pot at (4,0). From (2,2), she can go: R to (3,2) [if empty?] then R to (4,2) [if empty?] then D to (4,1) then D to (4,0). But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and is empty? Yes, because only (2,2) had an onion and we took it. So (3,2) is empty and walkable? Then:\nAfter turn 34 (Alice holding onion at (2,3))? Actually, after turn 34, she is at (2,3) holding onion? No: at turn 34, she did I and picked up the onion, so she is still at (2,3) but now holding an onion. Then at turn 35, she can move R to (3,3) but Bob was at (3,3) at turn 32. By turn 35, Bob has moved: at turn 32: Bob moved D to (3,2); turn 33: D to (3,1); turn 34: D to (3,0); turn 35: I (at (3,0)). So at turn 35, Bob is at (3,0) and Alice is at (2,3). Then at turn 35, Alice can move R to (3,3) because Bob is not there? Bob is at (3,0). So (3,3) is free? Then:\nTurn 35: Alice moves R to (3,3)\nTurn 36: moves R to (4,3) [if (4,3) is empty? We don't know. But (4,3) is not listed as a non-empty tile, so it should be empty?]\nTurn 37: moves D to (4,2) [kitchen counter, empty?]\nTurn 38: moves D to (4,1) [empty?]\nTurn 39: moves D to (4,0) [pot]\nTurn 40: I (put onion)\n\nBut this is longer. Alternatively, from (3,3) she can move D to (3,2) [turn 36] then D to (3,1) [turn 37] then D to (3,0) [turn 38] but at (3,0) Bob might still be there? Bob at turn 35 is at (3,0) and after putting the onion, he might stay or move. We don't control Bob. So to avoid conflict, using the other pot (4,0) is safer.\n\nBut note: the pot at (3,0) now has one onion (from Bob). So if Alice puts her onion there, it becomes two. Then we need one more onion to complete. Alternatively, she can put it in (4,0) to start a new pot.\n\nWhich is better? We can complete the pot at (3,0) faster if Alice adds her onion there. Then we only need one more onion. But Bob is free after turn 35. He can get another onion and put it in (3,0). Then the pot at (3,0) would have three onions and start cooking.\n\nBut if Alice puts her onion in (4,0), then we have two pots with one onion each. Then we need two more onions for each. It would take longer.\n\nSo better to put in (3,0). So:\n\nAfter Alice picks up the onion at (2,2) at turn 34, she is at (2,3) holding onion. Then:\n\nTurn 35: move R to (3,3) [Bob is at (3,0) at this turn, so no conflict]\nTurn 36: move D to (3,2) [empty kitchen counter? Yes, so walkable]\nTurn 37: move D to (3,1) [empty tile?]\nTurn 38: move D to (3,0) [pot]. But at turn 38, Bob might have left (3,0). Bob at turn 35: I (put onion) -> then he is free. He can move away. For example, he might move U to (3,1) at turn 36? Then at turn 37, he might move again. So at turn 38, (3,0) might be free. But we cannot be sure. Alternatively, we can have Alice wait until Bob leaves? But we don't control Bob.\n\nTo avoid conflict, we can have Alice go to (4,0) if Bob is blocking. But we don't know Bob's actions. Since we are only controlling Alice, we must plan her actions and hope Bob cooperates.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice get another onion and put it in (4,0) to start a new pot. Then we have two pots with one onion each. Then we can use the onions on the counters to complete them.\n\nThere are onions at (6,4) and (7,1). But they are far.\n\nBut note: Bob is free after turn 35. He can get an onion and put it in (3,0) to complete the third one. So if Alice puts her onion in (3,0) at turn 38, then the pot at (3,0) has two onions. Bob can then get an onion and put it in (3,0). How?\n\nBob after turn 35: at (3,0) holding nothing. He can move U to (3,1) [turn 36], then U to (3,2) [turn 37], then U to (3,3) [turn 38]. Then he can go to an onion dispenser? The nearest is at (3,4) and (4,4). From (3,3), he can move U to (3,4) [turn 39] and then I to get an onion [turn 40]. Then he can go back: D to (3,3) [turn 41], D to (3,2) [turn 42], D to (3,1) [turn 43], D to (3,0) [turn 44], I [turn 45]. Then the pot has three onions and starts cooking at turn 45. It will be ready at turn 50.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice after putting the onion in (3,0) at turn 38 is free. She can then get a plate to serve later? Or get another onion for the other pot.\n\nBut we have two pots. We can also use the other pot at (4,0). So Alice, after putting the onion in (3,0) at turn 38, can then move to get another onion and put it in (4,0). But she is at (3,0). She can move U to (3,1) [turn 39], then R to (4,1) [turn 40], then U to (4,2) [turn 41], then U to (4,3) [turn 42], then R to (5,3) [turn 43]? Then to the onion dispenser? Or she can pick up an onion from a counter? The counter at (6,4) is at (6,4). That is far. Or (7,1) is at (7,1). From (3,0) to (7,1): \n(3,0) -> (4,0) [but (4,0) is a pot, but she can walk on it? Only if it's empty? But we haven't put anything in it? So it's empty and she can walk? But the pot is a non-empty tile? Actually, the pot is a tile that can be interacted with. But when it has no ingredients, is it empty? The rules don't say. But typically, pots are walkable when not cooking? But in Overcooked, pots are not walkable? Let me check the rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and a pot is a tile type. But when it's empty, is it considered non-empty? The rules don't specify. But the pot is always a tile that you can interact with, so it might be considered non-walkable? However, the rules for movement: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" So \"empty\" here might mean walkable? And the pot is not an empty tile? So players cannot walk on pots? Similarly, dispensers and counters? Only empty tiles are walkable? But the rules say: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then there are other tiles (dispensers, pots, counters) which are not empty. So they are not walkable? \n\nThis is critical. Let me re-read:\n\n\"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nBut what is a non-empty tile? The rules don't define, but from context, an empty tile is one type. The others (dispensers, pots, counters) are not empty. So they are non-empty? Therefore, players cannot walk on them. So the pots at (3,0) and (4,0) are non-empty tiles? Then players cannot walk on them. So when Alice is at (3,0) after putting the onion, she is on the pot? But she got there by interacting? Actually, no: she moved to (3,0) and then interacted? But the move to (3,0) requires that (3,0) is walkable? But it's a pot, so non-walkable? \n\nThis is a contradiction. How do players interact with pots? They must be adjacent and facing the pot. So they cannot stand on the pot. Therefore, to interact with a pot at (3,0), the player must stand on an adjacent empty tile and face the pot. Adjacent tiles: (3,1) [above], (4,0) [right], (2,0) [left], (3,-1) [below] but that doesn't exist. So the adjacent tiles are (3,1), (4,0), (2,0). But (4,0) and (2,0) are kitchen counters? And (3,1) is an empty tile? So to put an onion in the pot at (3,0), the player must stand at (3,1), (2,0), or (4,0) and face the pot.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0): adjacent tiles are (4,1), (3,0), (5,0). (5,0) is a kitchen counter.\n\nTherefore, when we said Bob moves to (3,0) and interacts, that is incorrect. He must stand adjacent. So:\n\nBob at (3,3) holding onion. He wants to put in pot at (3,0). He must stand at (3,1) and face down? Or at (2,0) or (4,0). The easiest is (3,1) and face down.\n\nSo:\nBob:\nTurn 32: D to (3,2) [from (3,3) to (3,2)]\nTurn 33: D to (3,1) [now at (3,1)]\nTurn 34: Change orientation to D? (if not already) -> but after moving down twice, he is facing down? The move action changes orientation to the direction of movement. So after turn 32: moved D, so facing down. Then turn 33: moved D, so still facing down. So at (3,1) facing down, adjacent to the pot at (3,0). Then turn 34: I to put onion.\n\nSimilarly, Alice: after picking up the onion at (2,2) at turn 34, she is at (2,3) holding onion. She can go to (3,1) to put the onion in the same pot? But Bob is at (3,1) at turn 34. So conflict.\n\nAlice should go to (2,0) or (4,0) to put the onion in the pot at (3,0). (2,0) is a kitchen counter and is empty? We know it's empty because not listed in non-empty. So she can stand on it? But it's a kitchen counter tile. When empty, is it walkable? The rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if it's empty, then it's walkable? I think so. So:\n\nAlice at (2,3) at turn 34 (after interact). Then:\nTurn 35: move D to (2,2) [which is now empty, so walkable? and she can walk on it?]\nTurn 36: move D to (2,1) [empty tile]\nTurn 37: move D to (2,0) [kitchen counter, empty, so walkable]\nThen she is at (2,0) which is adjacent to the pot at (3,0). But she needs to face east? So:\nTurn 38: change orientation to R (right) to face the pot at (3,0)\nTurn 39: I to put onion.\n\nBut at turn 39, she puts the onion. Now the pot at (3,0) has two onions (from Bob and Alice).\n\nThen we need one more onion. Bob is free at turn 34 (after putting his onion). He can go get another onion.\n\nBob at turn 34: at (3,1) after putting onion. He can move to get an onion from a dispenser or a counter.\n\nCounters with onions: (6,4) and (7,1) and (7,1) is closer? (7,1) is at (7,1). From (3,1), he can move: R to (4,1) [turn 35], R to (5,1) [turn 36], R to (6,1) [turn 37], D to (6,0) [turn 38]? Then to (7,1) is not adjacent. Or from (6,1) to (7,1): move R to (7,1) [turn 38]. Then he can pick up the onion at (7,1) if he is facing it? He is at (7,1) but the counter is at (7,1)? He is standing on it? But the counter has an onion, so non-empty? Then he cannot walk on it. So he must stand adjacent. The adjacent tiles to (7,1) are: (7,0), (7,2), (6,1), (8,1) [but (8,1) is out of bounds?]. So he can stand at (7,0) or (7,2) or (6,1). But (7,0) is a kitchen counter? And we don't know if empty. (7,0) is listed as a kitchen counter tile, and not in non-empty, so empty. So he can stand at (7,0) and face up? Or (7,2) and face down? Or (6,1) and face right.\n\nLet's try: from (6,1) [at turn 37], he can move R to (7,1) but cannot because it's non-empty. So he must change orientation to face east and interact from (6,1)? But (7,1) is east of (6,1). So at (6,1), he can face east and interact to pick up the onion from (7,1)? But the rule: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\" So (6,1) is adjacent to (7,1) (right). So he can face east and interact.\n\nSo:\nBob:\nTurn 35: move R to (4,1)\nTurn 36: move R to (5,1)\nTurn 37: move R to (6,1)\nTurn 38: change orientation to R (if not already) -> after moving right, he is facing right? So after turn 37, he is at (6,1) facing right. Then turn 38: I to pick up onion from (7,1)\n\nThen he is holding an onion. Then he can go back to put it in the pot at (3,0). From (6,1) to (3,1): \nTurn 39: L to (5,1)\nTurn 40: L to (4,1)\nTurn 41: L to (3,1)\nThen at (3,1) facing left? But he needs to face down to interact with the pot at (3,0). So:\nTurn 42: change orientation to D\nTurn 43: I to put onion.\n\nThen the pot at (3,0) has three onions at turn 43. It starts cooking and will be ready at turn 48.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice after turn 39 (put onion) is at (2,0) holding nothing. She can then go to get a plate to serve the soup when ready.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). From (2,0) to (0,2):\n(2,0) -> (1,0) [kitchen counter, empty?] -> (0,0) [kitchen counter, empty?] -> then to (0,1) [kitchen counter, empty?] -> then to (0,2) [plate dispenser]. But (0,0), (1,0), (0,1) are kitchen counters and empty, so walkable? Then:\nTurn 40: move L to (1,0)\nTurn 41: move L to (0,0)\nTurn 42: move U to (0,1)\nTurn 43: move U to (0,2) [plate dispenser]\nThen she can interact to pick up a plate? But only if she is facing the dispenser. She is at (0,2), and the dispenser is at (0,2)? Then she is standing on it? No, the dispenser is a tile. She must be adjacent. The plate dispenser is at (0,2), so she must stand adjacent. The adjacent tiles are (0,1), (0,3), (1,2). (0,3) is out of the grid? We have grid up to y=4? The grid is from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 4? (0,3) is within bounds? We don't have a full grid map, but Alice was at (1,3) initially, so (0,3) should be there. But is it empty? We don't know. Alternatively, she can stand at (1,2) and face west? \n\nBetter to stand at (0,1) and face north? Or at (1,2) and face west.\n\nFrom (2,0), she can go:\n(2,0) -> (2,1) [empty] -> (2,2) [empty kitchen counter] -> (2,3) [empty] -> (1,3) [empty] -> (0,3) [if exists and empty] -> then face south to interact with (0,2)? But (0,3) to (0,2) is south.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,0) to (2,1) to (2,2) to (1,2) [kitchen counter, empty] then face west to interact with (0,2).\n\nLet's do:\nAlice at (2,0) after turn 39.\nTurn 40: U to (2,1)\nTurn 41: U to (2,2)\nTurn 42: L to (1,2) [if empty and walkable? (1,2) is not listed as a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are listed: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), ... so (1,2) is not listed? Then it must be an empty tile? So walkable.\nTurn 43: change orientation to W (left) to face west towards (0,2)\nTurn 44: I to pick up plate.\n\nThen she has a plate. The soup will be ready at turn 48. She needs to be at the serving counter at (7,2) with the plate and soup.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (7,2):\nLong path. But she has time: from turn 44 to 48, 4 turns. She can start moving.\n\nBut the serving counter is at (7,2). To interact, she must be adjacent and facing it. Adjacent tiles: (7,1), (7,3), (6,2), (8,2). (7,1) has an onion on the counter? But she doesn't need to pick it up. She can stand at (6,2) and face east, or (7,1) and face north, or (7,3) and face south.\n\n(6,2) is a kitchen counter? And it's empty? Because not listed as non-empty. So she can stand on it.\n\nPath from (1,2) to (6,2): \n(1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (4,2) -> (5,2) -> (6,2). All these are kitchen counters except (2,2) we know is empty, (3,2) empty, etc. So walkable when empty.\n\nSo:\nTurn 44: after picking up plate, she is at (1,2) holding plate.\nTurn 45: R to (2,2)\nTurn 46: R to (3,2)\nTurn 47: R to (4,2)\nTurn 48: R to (5,2)\nTurn 49: R to (6,2) [kitchen counter, empty]\nThen she needs to face east to interact with serving counter at (7,2). So:\nTurn 50: change orientation to R (east)\nTurn 51: I to serve the soup.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 48. She can serve it as soon as it's ready, but she is not in position until turn 50. So she can start moving earlier? But she picked up the plate at turn 44. She has from turn 44 to when the soup is ready (turn 48) to get to a position to serve. But she arrives at (6,2) at turn 49, and the soup is ready at turn 48. So at turn 48, the soup is ready, but she is at (5,2) at turn 48. Then at turn 49: move to (6,2), then turn 50: face east, turn 51: serve. But the soup might burn? The rules don't say anything about burning. It just cooks in 5 turns and then is ready. So it should be okay to serve later.\n\nAlternatively, she can be in position earlier? But she has to pick up the plate first. The plate dispenser is at (0,2), and she picks it up at turn 44. Then she has to move. She cannot be faster.\n\nBob could serve? But we are controlling Alice.\n\nNow, the total reward: one soup for 20 points.\n\nBut we have two pots. We can also start another soup. But time is limited. We are only planning for H turns. What is H? The problem says \"next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H? Or we should do until we serve one soup? Let's say we plan until we serve the first soup, so H=51-32+1=20 turns? But the problem doesn't specify H. We should plan for a reasonable horizon.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we should aim for multiple soups. But one soup takes about 20 turns (from turn 32 to 51). So in the near term, we can only serve one.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice and Bob work on two soups simultaneously.\n\nFor example, after Alice puts her onion in the pot at (3,0) (at turn 39), she can go to the other pot at (4,0) and put an onion there? But she is not holding anything. She would need to get another onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is getting the third onion for (3,0). After that, he can start on (4,0).\n\nBut let's focus on Alice's actions for now.\n\nRevised plan for Alice:\n\nObjective: get one soup as fast as possible, and then start the next.\n\nBut since we are at turn 32, and we want to plan for Alice.\n\nLet me outline Alice's actions for the next 10 turns or so, then adjust.\n\nBut we must output a sequence.\n\nGiven the complexity, and the fact that we are only controlling Alice, I'll plan for Alice to contribute to the first soup and then prepare for the next.\n\nBut the immediate goal: put an onion in the pot at (3,0) to make it two, then let Bob complete it. Then Alice can work on the other pot.\n\nSo:\n\nAlice at (1,3), turn 32.\n\nTurn 32: R to (2,3)\nTurn 33: D (to face down? But after move R, she is facing right. So she can either move D or change orientation. But to interact with (2,2), she needs to be facing down. So:\nOption A: \nTurn 33: change orientation to D (so she faces down)\nTurn 34: I to pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nBut after turn 32: R to (2,3), facing right. Then turn 33: change orientation to D. Then turn 34: I.\n\nThen she has onion.\n\nThen to put it in the pot at (3,0), she can go via (2,2) if empty. So:\n\nTurn 35: D to (2,2) [now empty]\nTurn 36: D to (2,1)\nTurn 37: D to (2,0) [kitchen counter, empty]\nTurn 38: change orientation to R (to face the pot at (3,0))\nTurn 39: I to put onion.\n\nThen she is free at (2,0).\n\nThen she can go to the plate dispenser to get a plate for when the soup is ready.\n\nBut the soup won't be ready until after Bob adds the third onion and then 5 turns cooking. Bob will add the third onion at turn 43 (as above), so cooking from turn 43 to 48. So Alice has time.\n\nFrom (2,0), she can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2):\n\nTurn 40: U to (2,1)\nTurn 41: U to (2,2)\nTurn 42: L to (1,2) [empty tile]\nTurn 43: L to (0,2) [but she cannot walk on the plate dispenser? So she must stand adjacent. So better to stop at (0,1) or (1,2) and interact.\n\nFrom (2,0) to (0,2) via counters:\n\nTurn 40: U to (2,1)\nTurn 41: U to (2,2)\nTurn 42: L to (1,2)\nThen at (1,2), she can change orientation to W (left) to face the plate dispenser at (0,2). Then interact.\n\nSo:\nTurn 43: change orientation to W\nTurn 44: I to pick up plate.\n\nThen she holds a plate. She needs to wait until the soup is ready at turn 48. Then she can go to the pot at (3,0) to get the soup? But to get the soup from the pot, she needs to have a plate and interact with the pot when it has cooked soup. The rules: for pot, \"Serve soup (if player is holding a clean plate and pot has cooked soup).\" So she can interact with the pot to serve the soup? But then she will be holding the soup in the plate, and then she needs to deliver it to the serving counter.\n\nSo after getting the plate, she can go to the pot at (3,0) to serve the soup when ready.\n\nBut at turn 44, she is at (1,2) holding a plate. The soup will be ready at turn 48. She can move to a spot near the pot to be ready.\n\nThe pot at (3,0): adjacent tiles are (3,1), (2,0), (4,0). She can stand at (2,0) or (3,1) or (4,0). (2,0) is close.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (2,0):\n(1,2) -> (2,2) [turn 45: R to (2,2)]\n-> (2,1) [turn 46: D to (2,1)]\n-> (2,0) [turn 47: D to (2,0)]\n\nThen at turn 48, the soup is ready. She is at (2,0) facing down? After moving down to (2,0), she is facing down. But to interact with the pot at (3,0), she needs to face east. So:\nTurn 48: change orientation to R (east)\nTurn 49: I to serve the soup -> now she is holding a soup in a plate.\n\nThen she needs to deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (2,0) to (7,2): \n(2,0) -> (3,0) but cannot walk on pot. So she must go around. \n(2,0) -> (2,1) [turn 50: U to (2,1)]\n-> (2,2) [turn 51: U to (2,2)]\n-> (3,2) [turn 52: R to (3,2)]\n-> (4,2) [turn 53: R to (4,2)]\n-> (5,2) [turn 54: R to (5,2)]\n-> (6,2) [turn 55: R to (6,2)]\nThen at (6,2), she can face east to interact with the serving counter at (7,2):\nTurn 56: change orientation to R\nTurn 57: I to deliver.\n\nThis is many turns. And we are only at turn 32. We need to output a sequence for Alice. How many turns? The problem doesn't specify H. We can output until she serves or for a fixed H.\n\nBut to maximize, we should do the first part and then we can output a few turns.\n\nAlternatively, after she has the plate, she can go directly to the serving counter area and wait, but then when the soup is ready, she is far from the pot.\n\nBetter to serve the soup immediately after it's ready and then deliver.\n\nBut the delivery takes time.\n\nWe can have Bob serve the soup? But we control Alice.\n\nGiven the time, I'll plan for Alice to put the onion and then get a plate and be ready to serve, but only output the first 10 turns or so.\n\nBut the problem says to maximize the total reward, so we should complete the soup.\n\nLet's calculate the turns from turn 32:\n\nAlice:\n32: R to (2,3)\n33: D (change orientation to down) -> but the action is either move or change orientation. We can use 'D' for move down or for change orientation down? The actions are: U, D, L, R for move or change orientation? The rules distinguish: \"Move (L/R/U/D)\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)\". But in the action set, it's the same symbols. So how to represent? The action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So U can mean move up or change orientation up? But the effect depends on whether the adjacent tile in that direction is empty or not.\n\nRule for change orientation: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> this seems like a mistake in the rule description. Let me read carefully:\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThat doesn't make sense. It should be: Change Orientation (L/R/U/D) changes only the orientation, no move, regardless of the adjacent tile.\n\nBut the rule says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is confusing.\n\nLooking back: \n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis suggests that if you try to change orientation to a direction where the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move? But that doesn't make sense because change orientation shouldn't move.\n\nI think there is a typo in the rules. Probably, the \"Change Orientation\" action only changes orientation and never moves, regardless of the adjacent tile.\n\nBut the action is listed as L/R/U/D, same as move. So how to differentiate? The rules don't explicitly say, but in the action set, it's the same symbols. This is ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps the action 'U' can mean either:\n- If the player intends to move, and the tile in that direction is empty, then move.\n- If the tile is not empty, then it becomes a change orientation.\n\nBut the rules say: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nLet me read the rules again:\n\n\" Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.  \n- **Interact (I):** ...\n- **Stay (S):** Do nothing.\"\n\nFor \"Change Orientation\", the \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" might be a mistake. It should simply change orientation without moving, and the condition is not needed.\n\nIn standard Overcooked, there is a separate action for changing orientation without moving.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that:\n- When a player issues U/D/L/R, if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then it is a move (and the orientation changes to that direction).\n- If the adjacent tile is not empty, then it is a change orientation (and the orientation changes to that direction) and no move.\n\nThis is how it is often implemented.\n\n So for example, if a player is at (x,y) and issues 'U', then:\n- if (x, y+1) is empty, then move to (x,y+1) and face up.\n- if (x, y+1) is not empty, then stay at (x,y) and change orientation to up.\n\n So in effect, the action 'U' can mean move up if possible, otherwise turn up.\n\n Similarly for other directions.\n\n This matches the rule: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\n So for Alice at (1,3) turn 32, if she does 'R' (move right), then (2,3) is empty? We don't know, but likely empty. So she moves to (2,3) and faces right.\n\n Then at (2,3), if she does 'D', then (2,2) is below her. (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion, so non-empty. Therefore, if she does 'D', since (2,2) is not empty, she will not move, but change orientation to down.\n\n That is perfect for then interacting with (2,2) in the next turn.\n\n So:\nTurn 32: R ( move to (2,3), face right)\nTurn 33: D ( since (2,2) is non-empty, she doesn't move, but changes orientation to down. Now she is at (2,3) facing down)\nTurn 34: I ( interact with (2,2) below her, so she picks up the onion)\n\n Then proceed as before.\n\n So the sequence for Alice:\n\nTurn 32: R\nTurn 33: D  (this is a change orientation to down, because (2,2) is non-empty)\nTurn 34: I  (pick up onion)\nTurn 35: D  (now (2,2) is empty, so she can move down to (2,2))\nTurn 36: D  ( move to (2,1)? (2,1) is empty, so move down to (2,1), face down)\nTurn 37: D  ( move to (2,0)? (2,0) is a kitchen counter and empty, so walkable. Move to (2,0), face down)\n But at (2,0), she is facing down. To interact with the pot at (3,0) to the east, she needs to face east. So:\nTurn 38: R  ( change orientation to east? But if she does 'R', then the adjacent tile to the east is (3,0), which is a pot, non-empty. So she won't move, but change orientation to east.\nTurn 39: I  ( interact with (3,0) to put onion)\n\n Then she is at (2,0) holding nothing, facing east.\n\n Then she can go to get a plate.\n\nTurn 40: U  ( move to (2,1)? (2,1) is empty, so move north to (2,1), face north)\nTurn 41: U  ( move to (2,2), face north)\nTurn 42: L  ( change orientation to west? Because the adjacent tile to the west is (1,2), which is empty, so she would move west to (1,2) and face west? But we want her to go to (1,2) anyway.\n So: 'L' at (2,2): adjacent west is (1,2), empty, so she moves to (1,2) and faces west.\nTurn 43: L  ( now at (1,2), adjacent west is (0,2), which is the plate dispenser, non-empty. So she doesn't move, but changes orientation to west.\nTurn 44: I  ( interact with (0,2) to pick up a plate)\n\n Then she is at (1,2) holding a plate, facing west.\n\n Then she can wait or move to near the pot. The soup will be ready at turn 48, so she can head to (2,0) to be ready.\n\nTurn 45: R  ( change orientation to east? Because adjacent east is (2,2), empty, so she moves to (2,2) and faces east)\nTurn 46: D  ( move to (2,1), face south)\nTurn 47: D  ( move to (2,0), face south)\nTurn 48: R  ( change orientation to east, because (3,0) is east and non-empty, so she turns east without moving)\nTurn 49: I  ( interact with (3,0) to serve the soup, but only if the soup is ready. At turn 48 the soup is ready, so at turn 49 she can serve. Now she is holding a soup in a plate.)\n\n Then she needs to deliver to (7,2).\n\n But this is getting long. We can stop here or continue. Since the problem asks for a sequence, and H is not specified, we can output until turn 49 or so.\n\n But to maximize, we should complete the delivery. However, for the answer, we can output the first 10 actions for Alice.\n\n Given the complexity, I'll output the actions for Alice for turns 32 to 44 (13 actions) to get to the point where she has the plate.\n\n But to serve the soup, we need more.\n\n Alternatively, after she puts the onion (turn 39), she could help with the other pot.\n\n But let's output a sequence until she serves the soup.\n\n Continuing from turn 49: she is at (2,0) holding the soup in a plate, facing east.\n\n Then to deliver to (7,2):\n\n She can move to (3,0) but cannot. So she must go up.\n\nTurn 50: U  ( move to (2,1), face north)\nTurn 51: U  ( move to (2,2), face north)\nTurn 52: R  ( move to (3,2), face east)\nTurn 53: R  ( move to (4,2), face east)\nTurn 54: R  ( move to (5,2), face east)\nTurn 55: R  ( move to (6,2), face east)\nTurn 56: I  ( interact with serving counter? But she is at (6,2), and the serving counter is at (7,2), which is east. She is facing east, so she can interact to deliver.\n\n So at turn 56, she delivers the soup for 20 points.\n\n Then she is free.\n\n So the sequence for Alice from turn 32 to turn 56 is 25 actions.\n\n But we are at turn 32, so we need to output actions for turns 32 to 56 for Alice.\n\n This is long, but we can do it.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might expect a shorter plan. But to maximize, we should do the full delivery.\n\n Since the answer format is for Alice's actions, and we have a clear plan, I'll output the sequence.\n\n So Alice's actions:\n\nTurn 32: R  ( to (2,3) )\nTurn 33: D  ( change orientation to down )\nTurn 34: I  ( pick up onion from (2,2) )\nTurn 35: D  ( move to (2,2) )\nTurn 36: D  ( move to (2,1) )\nTurn 37: D  ( move to (2,0) )\nTurn 38: R  ( change orientation to east )\nTurn 39: I  ( put onion in pot at (3,0) )\nTurn 40: U  ( move to (2,1) )\nTurn 41: U  ( move to (2,2) )\nTurn 42: L  ( move to (1,2) )\nTurn 43: L  ( change orientation to west )\nTurn 44: I  ( pick up plate from (0,2) )\nTurn 45: R  ( move to (2,2) )  [ from (1,2) move east to (2,2) ]\nTurn 46: D  ( move to (2,1) )\nTurn 47: D  ( move to (2,0) )\nTurn 48: R  ( change orientation to east )\nTurn 49: I  ( serve soup from pot at (3,0) ) -> now holding soup in plate\nTurn 50: U  ( move to (2,1) )\nTurn 51: U  ( move to (2,2) )\nTurn 52: R  ( move to (3,2) )\nTurn 53: R  ( move to (4,2) )\nTurn 54: R  ( move to (5,2) )\nTurn 55: R  ( move to (6,2) )\nTurn 56: I  ( deliver soup at (7,2) )\n\n This is 25 actions.\n\n But note: at turn 49, we assume the soup is ready. It is ready at turn 48? The soup started cooking when the third onion is put, which is at turn 43 (by Bob), so ready at turn 48. At turn 49, Alice serves it.\n\n Also, at turn 44, she picks up the plate, and then moves to (2,0) to be ready.\n\n This plan assumes that Bob does his part: he puts his onion at turn 34, then gets another onion and puts it at turn 43.\n\n If Bob doesn't, then the soup won't be ready. But we have to assume cooperation.\n\n Since we are only controlling Alice, this is the best we can do.\n\n So I'll output the sequence for Alice from turn 32 to turn 56.\n\n But the problem might want a shorter horizon. However, to maximize, we complete the delivery.\n\n If H is shorter, we might not complete, but the problem says \"next several turns\", so we can choose H=25.\n\n Alternatively, we can output until the soup is served, which is turn 49, but then she hasn't delivered. The reward is only when delivered.\n\n So we include until delivery.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 32: R\nTurn 33: D\nTurn 34: I\nTurn 35: D\nTurn 36: D\nTurn 37: D\nTurn 38: R\nTurn 39: I\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: L\nTurn 43: L\nTurn 44: I\nTurn 45: R\nTurn 46: D\nTurn 47: D\nTurn 48: R\nTurn 49: I\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: R\nTurn 53: R\nTurn 54: R\nTurn 55: R\nTurn 56: I\n}\n\n Note: This plan assumes that the soup is ready at turn 49 and that the path is clear (no obstacles from Bob or others). In practice, we might need to adjust, but given the information, this is a good plan.\n\n We also note that after turn 56, Alice is free, and we can start on the next soup, but that is beyond the plan.\n\n This should yield at least 20 points.\n\n Let me know if you see any issue.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should collaborate to prepare and deliver an onion soup (3 onions) to the serving counter. The pot at (3,0) is prioritized for efficiency. Alice's role involves retrieving an onion from the kitchen counter at (2,2), placing it in the pot at (3,0), fetching a plate, serving the soup when ready, and delivering it. Bob (cooperatively) places his held onion in the pot, fetches a third onion, and completes the pot. The soup cooks in 5 turns after the third onion is added (by Bob at turn 43, ready at turn 48). Alice serves the soup at turn 49 and delivers it at turn 56 for a reward of 20.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (turns 32 to 56):\n- **Turn 32 (R)**: Move right to (2,3), facing right.\n- **Turn 33 (D)**: Change orientation to down (since (2,2) is non-empty), now facing down.\n- **Turn 34 (I)**: Interact to pick up onion from (2,2).\n- **Turn 35 (D)**: Move down to (2,2) (now empty), facing down.\n- **Turn 36 (D)**: Move down to (2,1), facing down.\n- **Turn 37 (D)**: Move down to (2,0), facing down.\n- **Turn 38 (R)**: Change orientation to east (facing pot at (3,0)).\n- **Turn 39 (I)**: Interact to place onion in pot at (3,0) (pot now has 2 onions).\n- **Turn 40 (U)**: Move up to (2,1), facing up.\n- **Turn 41 (U)**: Move up to (2,2), facing up.\n- **Turn 42 (L)**: Move left to (1,2), facing left.\n- **Turn 43 (L)**: Change orientation to west (facing plate dispenser at (0,2)).\n- **Turn 44 (I)**: Interact to pick up plate from (0,2).\n- **Turn 45 (R)**: Move right to (2,2), facing right.\n- **Turn 46 (D)**: Move down to (2,1), facing down.\n- **Turn 47 (D)**: Move down to (2,0), facing down.\n- **Turn 48 (R)**: Change orientation to east (facing pot at (3,0); soup ready).\n- **Turn 49 (I)**: Interact to serve soup (now holding soup in plate).\n- **Turn 50 (U)**: Move up to (2,1), facing up.\n- **Turn 51 (U)**: Move up to (2,2), facing up.\n- **Turn 52 (R)**: Move right to (3,2), facing right.\n- **Turn 53 (R)**: Move right to (4,2), facing right.\n- **Turn 54 (R)**: Move right to (5,2), facing right.\n- **Turn 55 (R)**: Move right to (6,2), facing right.\n- **Turn 56 (I)**: Interact to deliver soup at serving counter (7,2) for 20 reward.\n\n### Key Coordination with Bob:\n- **Bob's actions (assumed cooperative)**:\n  - Turn 32-34: Move down to (3,1) and place onion in pot at (3,0) (pot has 1 onion initially, 2 after Alice).\n  - Turn 35-43: Fetch third onion from (7,1) and place in pot at turn 43 (pot starts cooking).\n  - Soup ready at turn 48; Bob moves away to avoid blocking.\n\nThis sequence ensures efficient use of time and resources, delivering one soup within 25 turns. Further turns can focus on additional soups for more reward.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 32: R\nTurn 33: D\nTurn 34: I\nTurn 35: D\nTurn 36: D\nTurn 37: D\nTurn 38: R\nTurn 39: I\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: L\nTurn 43: L\nTurn 44: I\nTurn 45: R\nTurn 46: D\nTurn 47: D\nTurn 48: R\nTurn 49: I\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: R\nTurn 53: R\nTurn 54: R\nTurn 55: R\nTurn 56: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 36. The goal is to maximize the reward by delivering soups. The only recipe available is 3 onions, which cooks in 5 turns and gives 20 reward.\n\nKey elements:\n- Alice is at (1,2) facing right, holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (6,2) facing down, holding one onion.\n\nKitchen Counters with items:\n- (2,2): onion\n- (6,4): onion\n- (7,1): onion\n\nPots: both at (3,0) and (4,0) are empty.\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). Plate dispenser at (0,2). Serving counter at (7,2).\n\nSince the recipe requires 3 onions, we need to get three onions into a pot. We have several onions already on counters and Bob is holding one.\n\nPlan:\n1. We have three onions available on counters and Bob is holding one. We can use these to fill a pot quickly.\n2. We have two pots at (3,0) and (4,0). We can choose one to use.\n3. We need to deliver the soup once cooked, which requires a plate and then taking the soup to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nSteps:\n\nImmediate actions for Alice and Bob:\n\nBob is at (6,2) holding an onion. He can go to a pot to put the onion. The nearest pot is at (3,0) or (4,0). From (6,2), he can move left to (5,2), then (4,2) and then down to (4,1) and then to (4,0). Alternatively, he can go to (5,2) then (4,2) then (3,2) then down to (3,1) and then (3,0). But note that (3,2) and (4,2) are kitchen counters, which are non-empty? Actually, the tile types say that (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) are kitchen counters. But the non-empty ones are only (2,2) (onion), (6,4) (onion), (7,1) (onion). So (3,2) and (4,2) are empty and walkable? Actually, the kitchen counters are tiles that can hold items but are also walkable. The problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\". Since the kitchen counters at (3,2) and (4,2) are not listed as non-empty, they are empty and walkable.\n\nSo Bob can go from (6,2) to (5,2) (left), then (4,2) (left), then (4,1) (down), then (4,0) (down). Then he can interact to put the onion in the pot at (4,0). That would be 3 moves and then interact.\n\nAlternatively, he could go to (3,0) similarly: (6,2)->(5,2)->(4,2)->(3,2)->(3,1)->(3,0). That's 4 moves. So the pot at (4,0) is closer.\n\nBut note: we have onions on counters. We can also have Alice or Bob pick them up to use.\n\nAlice is at (1,2) facing right, holding nothing. She can pick up the onion at (2,2) which is adjacent to her right? She is at (1,2) and (2,2) is to her right. She is facing right, so she can interact with (2,2) to pick up the onion. Then she can take that onion to a pot.\n\nBut note: if Bob is going to put his onion in the pot at (4,0) in 3 moves, then we only need two more onions. We have two onions on counters at (6,4) and (7,1) and one at (2,2). The one at (2,2) is very close to Alice.\n\nWe have two pots. We can use one pot for a 3-onion soup.\n\nOption: use the pot at (4,0). Bob can put his onion there. Then we need two more.\n\nAlice can pick up the onion at (2,2) right now (she is at (1,2) facing right, so she can interact with (2,2) to pick up the onion). Then she can go to the pot at (3,0) or (4,0) to put it. But note that if Bob is going to (4,0), then Alice can go to (3,0) to put her onion. Then we need one more onion.\n\nWe have onions at (6,4) and (7,1). Bob, after putting his onion at (4,0), can go to one of these to get another onion and put it in the same pot? But that pot would then have two onions (one from Bob and one from Alice) and then we need a third.\n\nAlternatively, we can have someone else get the third onion.\n\nBut note: we have two players. We need to coordinate.\n\nDetailed plan for the next few turns:\n\nTurn 36 (current turn we are planning for):\n\nAlice: she is at (1,2) facing right. The kitchen counter at (2,2) has an onion. Since she is adjacent and facing it, she can interact to pick it up. So action: I.\n\nBob: he is at (6,2) facing down. He needs to go to the pot at (4,0). He can move left to (5,2). So action: L.\n\nAfter turn 36:\n- Alice: holding one onion, still at (1,2) (because interact doesn't move).\n- Bob: at (5,2), facing down (he moved left, so his orientation becomes L? But note: the move action changes both position and orientation. When he moves left, he becomes at (5,2) and facing left? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So if he moves left, he ends up facing left.\n\nBut for the next move, he needs to go to (4,2). So he is now at (5,2) facing left. He can move left again to (4,2). Then down to (4,1), then down to (4,0).\n\nTurn 37:\nAlice: she is holding an onion. She needs to put it in a pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The closer one is (3,0) or (4,0)? From (1,2) to (3,0): she can go right to (2,2) (but (2,2) is a kitchen counter and currently has an onion? But she just picked up the onion so now (2,2) is empty? Actually, after she picks up the onion, the counter becomes empty. So she can walk on it? Yes, because it's a kitchen counter tile and now empty. So she can go: right to (2,2), then down to (2,1), then right to (3,1) (but (3,1) is what? The grid: we don't have a full grid, but we know (3,0) is a pot and (3,1) must be walkable? The tiles are not specified, but we can assume that the path is clear. Actually, the kitchen counters are at specific points, but the rest are empty? We don't have a full map, but we can assume that the tiles between are empty and walkable.\n\nAlternatively, she can go from (1,2) down to (1,1) then right to (2,1), (3,1), then down to (3,0). But that might be longer.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,0):\n- Option 1: right to (2,2), then down to (2,1), then right to (3,1), then down to (3,0). That's 3 moves.\n- Option 2: down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), (3,1), then down to (3,0). That's 3 moves.\n\nBut note: she is at (1,2) and just did an interact. So for turn 37, she can start moving.\n\nBut we have two pots. We can use the pot at (3,0) for Alice and (4,0) for Bob? But we want to put all three onions in one pot to make one soup.\n\nAlternatively, we can have both Alice and Bob put their onions in the same pot. Let's choose the pot at (4,0) because Bob is going there.\n\nSo Alice should also go to (4,0). But (4,0) is one tile. Only one player can be there at a time. So we cannot have both at the same pot at the same time.\n\nBetter: Alice goes to pot at (3,0) and Bob to (4,0). Then we have two pots each with one onion. We need to get a third onion into one of them.\n\nBut we want one soup, so we should put two onions in one pot and then the third in the same pot.\n\nSo after Bob puts his onion in (4,0) and Alice puts hers in (3,0), then we have two pots with one onion each. Then we need to move one onion from one pot to the other? But we cannot move from pot to pot. We would have to take it out and then put it in the other pot? But that would require a player to interact to get the onion from the pot and then go to the other pot and put it. But the pot with one onion is not cooked, so we can take the onion out? Actually, the pot is not cooking until it has three. So we can take an ingredient out? The problem doesn't specify if we can remove an ingredient. But typically in Overcooked, you can remove an ingredient from a pot that hasn't started cooking. So let's assume we can.\n\nBut that would be inefficient. Better to put two onions in one pot and then the third in that same pot.\n\nSo let's decide: we will use the pot at (4,0) for the soup. Bob is already going there with one onion. Then we need two more in that pot.\n\nAlice can put her onion in the same pot? But she is at (1,2) and the pot at (4,0) is a bit far. She can go to (4,0) and put her onion. But Bob is also going there. We need to avoid conflict.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can put his onion in (4,0), then go get another onion and put it, and then Alice can put the third.\n\nBut we have onions available: one at (6,4) and one at (7,1). Also, after Alice picks up the onion at (2,2), she can go to (4,0) to put it. Then Bob can go to get another onion from one of the counters and put it in the same pot.\n\nSo plan:\n\nTurn 36:\n- Alice: interact to pick up onion from (2,2) -> now holding onion.\n- Bob: move left to (5,2) -> now at (5,2) facing left.\n\nTurn 37:\n- Alice: start moving to (4,0). Path: from (1,2) to (2,2) (right) -> now at (2,2). Orientation: right? After moving right, she faces right.\n- Bob: move left to (4,2) -> now at (4,2) facing left.\n\nTurn 38:\n- Alice: move down to (2,1) -> facing down? Actually, move down changes to facing down.\n- Bob: move down to (4,1) -> facing down.\n\nTurn 39:\n- Alice: move right to (3,1) -> facing right.\n- Bob: move down to (4,0) -> facing down.\n\nNow Bob is at (4,0) facing down. He needs to face the pot to interact. The pot is at (4,0) and he is standing at (4,0)? But the pot is a tile. The player must be on an adjacent empty tile and facing the pot. So Bob cannot be standing on the pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The player must stand next to them. So Bob should be at (4,1) and face down to interact with (4,0). Similarly for Alice.\n\nI think I made a mistake. The player must be adjacent to the tile and facing it. So to interact with the pot at (4,0), the player must be at (4,1) (above it), or (3,0) (left) or (5,0) (right) but (5,0) is a kitchen counter? Actually, (5,0) is a kitchen counter tile. Is it empty? The non-empty counters are only (2,2), (6,4), (7,1). So (5,0) is empty and walkable? But we don't have information about (5,0). We know the list of kitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), ... So (5,0) is a kitchen counter. But it is not listed as non-empty, so it is empty and walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) and (4,1) are not listed as any special tile, so they are empty tiles.\n\nSo to interact with (4,0), the player can be at (4,1) (facing down), or (3,0) (facing right) or (5,0) (facing left). But (3,0) is a pot and (5,0) is a kitchen counter. So the only adjacent empty tile above the pot is (4,1). Similarly, for (3,0), the adjacent tiles are (3,1) above, (2,0) left, and (4,0) right. (2,0) is a kitchen counter and (4,0) is a pot, so the only adjacent empty tile is (3,1).\n\nTherefore, to interact with a pot, the player must stand on the tile above it and face down.\n\nSo for pot at (4,0): stand at (4,1) and face down.\n\nFor pot at (3,0): stand at (3,1) and face down.\n\nSo Bob at turn 39: he is at (4,1) and then he moves down to (4,0)? But (4,0) is a pot and he cannot walk onto it. So that move is invalid.\n\nCorrection: Bob must not move down to (4,0). Instead, at turn 38, Bob is at (4,1) (after moving down from (4,2) to (4,1)). Then at turn 39, he should not move but change orientation to face down? Or interact? But he is at (4,1) and if he faces down, then he can interact with (4,0). But the action is either move or interact or change orientation.\n\nSo at turn 39, Bob can change orientation to down? But that doesn't move him. Then he can interact at the same turn? No, each turn one action.\n\nSo he can do:\n\nAt turn 39: Bob can face down (action: D for change orientation to down) so that he is facing the pot. Then at turn 40, he can interact to put the onion.\n\nBut we want to be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 39, he can interact? But he is at (4,1) and facing down? Currently after move down to (4,1) at turn 38, he is facing down (because he moved down). So at turn 39, he can immediately interact with the pot at (4,0) because he is adjacent (above) and facing down.\n\nSo turn 39: Bob can do I to put the onion in the pot.\n\nSimilarly, for Alice, to put an onion in the pot at (4,0), she must be at (4,1) facing down.\n\nBut at turn 39, Alice is at (3,1) facing right. She is not at (4,1) and not facing down.\n\nSo she needs to go to (4,1) and face down.\n\nTurn 39: Alice can move right to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) and facing right? After moving right, she faces right. Then she needs to change orientation to down to face the pot? Or she can move down? But moving down would try to go to (4,0) which is not allowed.\n\nSo after moving to (4,1), she is facing right. Then she must change orientation to down to face the pot. Then interact.\n\nBut Bob is also going to be at (4,1) at turn 38 and 39? At turn 38, Bob is at (4,1). At turn 39, Bob is interacting at (4,1) so he is still there. Then at turn 39, Alice is moving to (4,1)? But two players cannot be on the same tile. So we have a conflict.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid having both players at (4,1) at the same time.\n\nAlternative: use the pot at (3,0) for Alice.\n\nSo let's adjust:\n\nTurn 36:\n- Alice: I (pick up onion from (2,2)) -> now holding onion, still at (1,2) facing right.\n- Bob: L (move left to (5,2)) -> now at (5,2) facing left.\n\nTurn 37:\n- Alice: move right to (2,2) -> now at (2,2) facing right.\n- Bob: move left to (4,2) -> now at (4,2) facing left.\n\nTurn 38:\n- Alice: move down to (2,1) -> facing down.\n- Bob: move down to (4,1) -> facing down.\n\nTurn 39:\n- Alice: move right to (3,1) -> facing right. Now she is at (3,1) and the pot at (3,0) is below her. So she needs to face down to interact.\n- Bob: I (interact with pot at (4,0) to put onion) -> now the pot at (4,0) has one onion. Bob is now holding nothing.\n\nTurn 40:\n- Alice: change orientation to down (action D) so she faces the pot at (3,0).\n- Bob: now he is free. We need to get a third onion for the pot at (4,0). He can go to the nearest onion counter. The onions are at (6,4) and (7,1). (7,1) is closer? Bob is at (4,1). To (7,1): he can go right to (5,1) (but (5,0) is a kitchen counter, but (5,1) is not specified, so probably empty), then (6,1), (7,1). Or up to (4,2), then right to (5,2), (6,2), (6,1) then (7,1). But (7,1) is a kitchen counter with an onion. He must stand adjacent and facing it to pick up.\n\nBut (7,1) is at the bottom. The adjacent tiles: above is (7,2) which is a serving counter. Left is (6,1). Right is (8,1) but not exist? So he must stand at (6,1) and face right to interact with (7,1).\n\nSimilarly, the onion at (6,4): he can go to (6,3) and face up? But (6,4) is a kitchen counter. Adjacent: above (6,5) not exist? Below (6,3). Left (5,4). Right (7,4). So he can stand at (6,3) and face up, or (5,4) face right, or (7,4) face left.\n\nThe closest for Bob: from (4,1) to (7,1): move right to (5,1), (6,1) (then face right to interact with (7,1)).\n\nOr to (6,4): move up to (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) then left to (5,4)? Or from (4,1) to (4,2) then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). Then face right to interact with (6,4)? But (6,4) is to the right of (5,4).\n\nDistance to (7,1): 3 moves to (7,1) but then he must also get to (6,1) to interact? Actually, to get to (6,1) from (4,1): move right twice to (6,1). Then interact facing right.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,4): from (4,1) to (4,2) (up), then (5,2) (right), (5,3) (up), (5,4) (up) then at (5,4) he can face right to interact with (6,4). That's 4 moves.\n\nSo (7,1) is closer. But note: (7,1) is a kitchen counter with an onion. He can pick it up if he is empty-handed.\n\nSo Bob: at turn 40, he can move right to (5,1).\n\nBut let's continue with Alice.\n\nTurn 40:\n- Alice: at (3,1) facing down (after changing orientation). Then she can interact to put the onion in the pot at (3,0). But we want the onion in the same pot as Bob's? We have two pots: (3,0) and (4,0). Bob put one in (4,0). We want two more in (4,0) to make three. So Alice should put her onion in (4,0) as well.\n\nBut we had a conflict at (4,1). Now at turn 39, Bob is at (4,1) and interacts, then at turn 40, he moves away. Then Alice can come to (4,1).\n\nRevised plan for Alice to put in (4,0):\n\nAfter turn 38:\n- Alice at (2,1) facing down.\n- Bob at (4,1) facing down.\n\nTurn 39:\n- Bob: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> now pot has one onion, Bob holding nothing.\n- Alice: move right to (3,1) -> facing right.\n\nTurn 40:\n- Bob: move right to (5,1) -> facing right (to start heading to (6,1) for (7,1)).\n- Alice: move right to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) facing right.\n\nTurn 41:\n- Bob: move right to (6,1) -> facing right.\n- Alice: change orientation to down (D) to face the pot at (4,0).\n\nTurn 42:\n- Bob: interact (I) to pick up the onion from (7,1) (he is at (6,1) facing right, adjacent to (7,1) which is a kitchen counter with onion). Now Bob holds an onion.\n- Alice: interact (I) to put her onion in the pot at (4,0). Now the pot has two onions (Bob's first and Alice's).\n\nNow the pot at (4,0) has two onions. We need one more.\n\nBob is holding an onion and can put it in the same pot. He is at (6,1). He can go to (4,1) to put it.\n\nPath: from (6,1) to (5,1) (left), then (4,1) (left). Then at (4,1), face down and interact.\n\nTurn 43:\n- Bob: move left to (5,1) -> facing left.\n- Alice: after putting the onion, she is holding nothing. She can go to get a plate for when the soup is ready.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2). From (4,1) to (0,2): \n- Up to (4,2), left to (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2). That's 5 moves.\n\nBut the soup will cook in 5 turns after the third onion is put. So we have time.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can put the third onion quickly.\n\nAfter turn 42:\n- Bob is at (6,1) holding an onion.\n- Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing.\n\nTurn 43:\n- Bob: move left to (5,1) -> facing left.\n- Alice: she can move to let Bob access the pot? Or she can go to get another onion? But we only need one more onion. Bob has it. So Alice should get out of the way.\n\nAlice can move up to (4,2) to free (4,1).\n\nTurn 43:\n- Bob: move left to (5,1) -> at (5,1) facing left.\n- Alice: move up to (4,2) -> facing up.\n\nTurn 44:\n- Bob: move left to (4,1) -> at (4,1) facing left.\n- Alice: she can stay or start going for a plate.\n\nTurn 45:\n- Bob: change orientation to down (D) to face the pot.\n- Alice: ...\n\nBut Bob can interact at turn 45? He is at (4,1) and if he faces down at turn 44, then at turn 45 he can interact.\n\nBut we can do better: at turn 44, when Bob moves to (4,1), he is facing left. He can interact at the same turn? No, because to interact with the pot, he must face down. So he must change orientation first.\n\nSo turn 44: Bob moves to (4,1) -> facing left.\nTurn 45: Bob changes orientation to down (D).\nTurn 46: Bob interacts to put the onion.\n\nThat's two more turns.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 44, Bob can change orientation to down while still at (5,1)? But he is not adjacent to the pot. He must be adjacent and facing. So he must be at (4,1) and facing down.\n\nSo it takes two actions: move to (4,1) and then change to down, then interact.\n\nBut note: when he moves to (4,1) from (5,1), he is moving left, so after moving he is facing left. Then he needs an extra turn to face down.\n\nAlternatively, he can move to (4,1) and then interact immediately if he is facing down? But he is not, because moving left makes him face left.\n\nSo it must take an extra turn.\n\nTo save time, we can have Alice put the third onion? But Alice is not holding an onion.\n\nAfter turn 42, Alice is free. She can go to get the onion from (6,4) or (7,1) but Bob is already getting one from (7,1) and now holds it.\n\nSo we stick with Bob putting the third onion.\n\nNow, the soup: once the third onion is put at turn 46, the soup starts cooking. It takes 5 turns to cook. So it will be ready at turn 51.\n\nThen someone needs to get a plate, put it in the pot to get the soup, and then deliver to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nWe can have Alice start getting plates.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2). Alice is at (4,2) at turn 43.\n\nPath to (0,2): (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (0,2). That's 4 moves left.\n\nThen she can grab a plate by interacting with the plate dispenser at (0,2). Then go to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup.\n\nAfter grabbing the plate, she must go to (4,1) to interact with the pot.\n\nFrom (0,2) to (4,1): \n- Right to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) -> that's 4 moves to (4,2). Then down to (4,1) -> 5 moves total.\n\nSo if she starts at turn 43 at (4,2):\n\nTurn 43: Alice move left to (3,2) -> facing left.\nTurn 44: move left to (2,2) -> facing left.\nTurn 45: move left to (1,2) -> facing left.\nTurn 46: move left to (0,2) -> facing left.\nTurn 47: interact (I) to take a plate -> now holding plate.\nTurn 48: move right to (1,2) -> facing right.\nTurn 49: move right to (2,2) -> facing right.\nTurn 50: move right to (3,2) -> facing right.\nTurn 51: move right to (4,2) -> facing right.\nTurn 52: move down to (4,1) -> facing down.\nTurn 53: interact (I) to serve the soup from the pot at (4,0) -> now holding soup in plate.\nThen she needs to deliver to serving counter at (7,2). From (4,1) to (7,2): \n- Up to (4,2) -> then right to (5,2), (6,2), (7,2). So from (4,1) to (4,2) (up), then (5,2) (right), (6,2) (right), (7,2) (right). 4 moves.\nThen interact to serve.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 51. She arrives at (4,1) at turn 53? Actually, at turn 52 she moves to (4,1). Then turn 53 she interacts to get the soup. Then she can go to serve.\n\nBut we can optimize the plate getting.\n\nNote: Bob is free after he puts the third onion. He can also help.\n\nAfter Bob puts the third onion at turn 46, he is at (4,1) holding nothing. He can go to get a plate.\n\nPath for Bob to plate dispenser: from (4,1) to (4,2) (up), then left to (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (0,2). 5 moves.\n\nThen interact to get plate. Then return: (0,2) to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), then down to (4,1). 5 moves. Then interact to get the soup.\n\nTotal: 5 to go, 5 to return, plus interact. So 11 turns. The soup is ready at turn 51, so he can get the plate by turn 46+5=51, then at turn 51 he is at (0,2) getting plate? Then he needs 5 moves back to (4,1) by turn 56, then interact at turn 57. Then go to serve.\n\nBut Alice is also going for the plate. We should coordinate to avoid both going.\n\nSince Alice is closer to the plate dispenser at turn 43 (she is at (4,2) and the dispenser is at (0,2), 4 moves away), and Bob is at (4,1) at turn 46, also 5 moves away, but turn 46 is later.\n\nSo Alice should get the plate.\n\nBut Alice's journey: she starts at turn 43 at (4,2). She moves left 4 times to (0,2) by turn 46? \n\nTurn 43: from (4,2) move left to (3,2) [turn 43]\nTurn 44: (3,2) to (2,2)\nTurn 45: (2,2) to (1,2)\nTurn 46: (1,2) to (0,2)\nTurn 47: interact to get plate.\n\nThen turn 48: move right to (1,2)\n...\nShe arrives at (4,2) at turn 51? \nTurn 48: (0,2) to (1,2)\nTurn 49: to (2,2)\nTurn 50: to (3,2)\nTurn 51: to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 52: down to (4,1)\nTurn 53: interact to get soup.\n\nThe soup is ready at turn 51 (since third onion at turn 46, then 5 turns: 47,48,49,50,51 -> ready at turn 51). So at turn 53, she can get the soup.\n\nThen she needs to deliver: from (4,1) to (4,2) (turn 54: up), then to (5,2) (turn 55), (6,2) (turn 56), (7,2) (turn 57). Then at turn 58, she can interact to serve.\n\nBut we are only planning for several turns, say H=10 or so. We might not need to go that far.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we want to deliver as soon as possible.\n\nWe have another onion on the counter at (6,4) and (7,1) is taken, but (6,4) is still there. We could start a second soup? But the recipe is only 3 onions. We have only one recipe.\n\nThe recipe information says only one recipe: 3 onions.\n\nSo one soup is enough for now.\n\nBut we can plan for the first soup.\n\nSince we are at turn 36 and we want to plan for the next, say, 10 turns? But the soup delivery will take more than 10 turns. We need to specify H.\n\nThe problem says: \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". Let's assume H=10 for now.\n\nSo we plan for turns 36 to 45.\n\nIn these turns, we can put two onions in the pot and get the third.\n\nFrom turn 36 to 42: we have Bob put one onion, Alice put one onion, and Bob is getting the third.\n\nAt turn 42: Bob is at (6,1) holding the third onion.\n\nThen turn 43: Bob moves to (5,1)\nTurn 44: to (4,1)\nTurn 45: changes orientation to down.\n\nSo we can plan up to turn 45.\n\nBut we also have Alice: at turn 42, she is at (4,1) and just put her onion, so she is free. She can go to get a plate.\n\nSo for the next 10 turns (t36 to t45), we can have:\n\nTurn 36: Alice I, Bob L\nTurn 37: Alice R, Bob L\nTurn 38: Alice D, Bob D\nTurn 39: Alice R, Bob I   [Bob puts first onion]\nTurn 40: Alice R, Bob R   [Alice to (4,1), Bob to (5,1)]\nBut wait, at turn 39: Alice moves to (3,1) and Bob interacts. Then turn 40: Alice moves to (4,1) and Bob moves to (5,1). But at turn 40, Alice is at (4,1) and Bob is at (5,1). Then turn 41: Alice changes to down (D), Bob moves to (6,1). Then turn 42: Alice I (puts onion), Bob I (picks up onion from (7,1)). Then turn 43: Alice can move up to (4,2) to free space, Bob moves left to (5,1). Turn 44: Alice moves left to (3,2), Bob moves left to (4,1). Turn 45: Alice moves left to (2,2), Bob changes orientation to down (D).\n\nSo let's write the actions:\n\nTurn 36: Alice: I, Bob: L\nTurn 37: Alice: R, Bob: L\nTurn 38: Alice: D, Bob: D\nTurn 39: Alice: R, Bob: I\nTurn 40: Alice: R, Bob: R\nTurn 41: Alice: D (change orientation to down), Bob: R\nTurn 42: Alice: I (put onion), Bob: I (pick up onion from (7,1))\nTurn 43: Alice: U (move up to (4,2)), Bob: L (move left to (5,1))\nTurn 44: Alice: L (move left to (3,2)), Bob: L (move left to (4,1))\nTurn 45: Alice: L (move left to (2,2)), Bob: D (change orientation to down)\n\nThis gets us to turn 45. The pot has two onions (from Bob and Alice), and Bob is at (4,1) facing down, holding the third onion. On turn 46, he can interact to put it, starting the cooking.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice is on her way to get a plate.\n\nBut we must output only Alice's actions? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But we are controlling both? The task is to help Alice collaborate with Bob, so we might need to specify both, but the answer format only shows actions for Alice? \n\nThe answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nIt doesn't specify for whom. But the context is \"for Alice\". The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\".\n\nBut we need to coordinate with Bob. Since Bob is the teammate, we assume we can control both? Or only Alice?\n\nThe problem: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\" and \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both.\n\nBut the answer format doesn't have Bob. So probably we only output Alice's actions, and assume Bob is controlled separately? Or we output only Alice's.\n\nTo be safe, I think we output only Alice's actions, and assume Bob will act optimally as well. But the problem says we can optionally plan for Bob.\n\nGiven the answer format, it might be only Alice.\n\nBut in the example, the action history includes both.\n\nPerhaps we need to specify Alice's actions, and Bob will be controlled by another agent.\n\nSince the task is to maximize reward, and we are to plan for Alice, we must assume Bob will cooperate or we have to consider his actions.\n\nTo simplify, I'll plan only Alice's actions and assume Bob will do his part as per the coordination.\n\nBut in the initial plan, we are specifying both.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", I think we can include Bob in the plan, but the answer format might not allow.\n\nLooking at the answer format, it only has one action per turn, which is for Alice.\n\nSo probably, we only output Alice's actions, and we assume that Bob will act in a coordinated way based on the plan.\n\nTherefore, in the plan, we only specify Alice's actions.\n\nSo for Alice, from turn 36 to 45:\n\nTurn 36: I (pick up onion at (2,2))\nTurn 37: R (move to (2,2))\nTurn 38: D (move to (2,1))\nTurn 39: R (move to (3,1))\nTurn 40: R (move to (4,1))\nTurn 41: D (change orientation to down to face pot)\nTurn 42: I (put onion in pot at (4,0))\nTurn 43: U (move to (4,2) to get out of the way)\nTurn 44: L (move to (3,2))\nTurn 45: L (move to (2,2))\n\nThen she can continue to (1,2) and (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nBut at turn 45, she is at (2,2).\n\nWe are planning for H=10 turns, from turn 36 to 45? That's 10 actions.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 36: I\nTurn 37: R\nTurn 38: D\nTurn 39: R\nTurn 40: R\nTurn 41: D\nTurn 42: I\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: L\nTurn 45: L\n\nThis is for 10 turns.\n\nBut note: at turn 39, when Alice moves to (3,1), Bob is at (4,1) and interacts. No conflict.\n\nAt turn 40, Alice moves to (4,1) but Bob is moving to (5,1), so they are not on the same tile.\n\nThen at turn 41, Alice changes orientation at (4,1), Bob moves to (6,1).\n\nTurn 42: Alice interacts at (4,1), Bob interacts at (6,1) to pick up onion.\n\nThen Alice moves up to (4,2) and Bob moves to (5,1).\n\nSo it works.\n\nWe might want to start the plate getting earlier, but with H=10, this is fine.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice is as above.\n\nBut let's double-check the positions:\n\nt36: Alice at (1,2) I -> picks up onion, still at (1,2)\nt37: R -> moves to (2,2), facing right\nt38: D -> moves to (2,1), facing down\nt39: R -> moves to (3,1), facing right\nt40: R -> moves to (4,1), facing right\nt41: D -> changes orientation to down (still at (4,1))\nt42: I -> interacts with pot at (4,0) (since facing down and adjacent) -> puts onion, now pot has two onions (Bob put one at t39, Alice at t42)\nt43: U -> moves to (4,2), facing up\nt44: L -> moves to (3,2), facing left\nt45: L -> moves to (2,2), facing left\n\nThen she can continue to get the plate.\n\nBut we stop at turn 45.\n\nThis should be good.\n\nBut we must ensure that Bob's actions are consistent. Since we are not controlling Bob, we assume he will do the logical thing: put his onion and then get the third one.\n\nIn the plan, we have Bob put at t39 and then move to get the third.\n\nSo it should work.\n\nTherefore, the actions for Alice from turn 36 to 45.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should collaborate to prepare and deliver a 3-onion soup, which yields a reward of 20. The pot at (4,0) is chosen for cooking, as it is accessible. Alice will pick up the onion from (2,2), place it in the pot at (4,0), then move toward the plate dispenser at (0,2) to prepare for serving. Bob (handled separately) will place his held onion in the pot, then fetch the third onion from (7,1) and add it to start cooking. Alice's actions are optimized for efficiency and coordination with Bob's expected movements.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 36 to 45)\n- **Turn 36 (t₁)**: `I`  \n  Alice interacts to pick up the onion from (2,2). She is at (1,2) facing right, adjacent to (2,2), and empty-handed.\n- **Turn 37**: `R`  \n  Alice moves right to (2,2), now holding an onion and facing right.\n- **Turn 38**: `D`  \n  Alice moves down to (2,1), facing down, en route to the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 39**: `R`  \n  Alice moves right to (3,1), facing right, to approach the pot.\n- **Turn 40**: `R`  \n  Alice moves right to (4,1), facing right, now adjacent to the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 41**: `D`  \n  Alice changes orientation to down to face the pot at (4,0), preparing to interact.\n- **Turn 42**: `I`  \n  Alice interacts to place her onion in the pot at (4,0). The pot now contains 2 onions (Bob added one earlier at his turn 39).\n- **Turn 43**: `U`  \n  Alice moves up to (4,2), facing up, to clear space for Bob to add the third onion.\n- **Turn 44**: `L`  \n  Alice moves left to (3,2), facing left, starting her journey to the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- **Turn 45**: `L`  \n  Alice moves left to (2,2), facing left, continuing toward the plate dispenser.\n\n### Coordination and Expected Outcome\n- **Bob's Role**:  \n  - Bob places his held onion in the pot at (4,0) on his turn 39 (after moving to (4,1)).  \n  - Bob then fetches the onion from (7,1) (turns 40–42) and adds it to the pot on his turn 46, starting the 5-turn cook time.  \n- **Post-Plan (Beyond Turn 45)**:  \n  - Alice proceeds to (0,2) to grab a plate (by turn 47), returns to (4,1) by turn 53, and serves the cooked soup (ready at turn 51) at the serving counter (7,2) by turn 58 for the 20-point reward.  \n- **Efficiency**: This sequence ensures the pot is filled quickly (2 onions by turn 42), and Alice initiates plate retrieval early, minimizing delivery time.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 36: I \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 37: R \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 38: D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 39: R \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 40: R \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 41: D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 42: I \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 43: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 44: L \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 45: L\n}",

The only recipe we have is Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward: 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice: at (1,1), facing down (D), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (6,3), facing up (U), holding one onion.\n\nNon-empty counters:\n- (2,2): onion\n- (6,4): onion\n- (7,1): onion\n\nPots: both at (3,0) and (4,0) are empty.\n\nThe plan should cover several turns (H turns). Since the cooking time is 5 turns, we should plan for at least 5 turns beyond the time we start cooking, but we can start with a shorter horizon and adjust.\n\nWe need to make a soup of 3 onions. There are onions on counters and Bob is holding one. Also, there are onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nSteps to make a soup:\n1. Put 3 onions into a pot. The pot will then cook for 5 turns.\n2. After 5 turns, the soup is ready. Then we need a plate to serve it.\n3. Take the plate to the pot, interact to get the soup, then take it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nWe have two pots at (3,0) and (4,0). We can use one of them.\n\nSince Bob is already holding an onion and is at (6,3), he can go to a pot to put his onion. However, the pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), which are on the bottom row. Bob is at (6,3). He can move down to (6,2) and then left to (5,2), (4,2) and then down to (4,1) and then left to (4,0) or (3,0). But note that (4,2) and (5,2) are kitchen counters (non-empty? Actually, the tile types say kitchen counters are at those positions, but the non-empty ones are only listed with items. The counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) are kitchen counters. But only (2,2) has an onion. The others are empty? The non-empty kitchen counters are only (2,2), (6,4), (7,1). So (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) are empty and can be used to place items.\n\nBut we don't need to use them right now. Bob can go to the pot at (4,0) by moving left and down.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the onions that are already on counters to save time.\n\nPlan:\n\nWe have onions at:\n- (2,2): onion\n- (6,4): onion\n- (7,1): onion\n\nBob is at (6,3) holding an onion. He can go to one of the pots to put his onion. Let's choose the pot at (4,0) because it's closer? Or (3,0) might be equally close.\n\nDistance for Bob to (4,0):\nFrom (6,3): \n- Option 1: down to (6,2) [empty tile? The grid: (6,2) is a serving counter? No, serving counter is at (7,2). The tiles: (6,2) is not listed as a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are at specific positions. Actually, the grid is 8x5? We don't have the full grid, but we know the positions of non-empty tiles. We must assume that any tile not listed as a non-empty type is empty? Actually, the tile types are given. We have:\n\nTile types:\n- Kitchen Counter: [(0,0), (1,0), ...] -> we can see that (0,0) to (7,0) are not all kitchen counters? Actually, the list is given. So (6,0) is a kitchen counter? Yes, but that's at the bottom. The path must avoid non-empty tiles (like dispensers, counters with items? Actually, the rule: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles? But note, kitchen counters without items are walkable? The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And non-empty tiles are defined as having an item? Or by type?\n\nThe rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as tiles that are not empty? But the tile types include dispensers, pots, etc. which are not empty? Actually, the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\". So non-empty tiles are those that are not of type \"Empty Tile\". So dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters (regardless of having an item) are non-empty? But the kitchen counter without an item is still a kitchen counter tile, so it's non-empty? Then we cannot walk on it.\n\nLooking back at the rules: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" So only empty tiles are walkable. All others (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are non-walkable.\n\nTherefore, the grid has:\n- Walkable: empty tiles (not listed in any of the non-empty types)\n- Non-walkable: dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters (even if they don't have an item, because they are of a non-empty type)\n\nSo the positions of non-empty tiles (by type) are fixed and cannot be walked on.\n\nTherefore, we have to navigate around them.\n\nLet me sketch a grid:\n\nWe have x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4.\n\nKitchen Counters at: \n(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0) -> bottom row\n(0,1), (7,1) -> left and right of row 1\n(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) -> row 2\n(0,3), (7,3) -> row 3\n(0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) -> top row\n\nOnion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4) -> top row, but they are dispensers, so non-walkable.\n\nPlate dispenser: (0,2) -> row 2, left.\n\nPot: (3,0), (4,0) -> bottom row, but note (3,0) and (4,0) are pots? But the kitchen counters at (3,0) and (4,0) are not listed? The kitchen counters are at (0,0) to (7,0) except (3,0) and (4,0) are pots? The pot list is separate. So (3,0) and (4,0) are pots, so they are non-walkable.\n\nServing counter: (7,2) -> at row 2, right.\n\nSo the walkable tiles are the ones not in the above lists.\n\nFor example, row 0: only (3,0) and (4,0) are pots, so they are non-walkable. The rest (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0) are kitchen counters -> non-walkable. So the entire row 0 is non-walkable? Then how do we access the pots? We can only interact with adjacent tiles. So we must stand next to the pot.\n\nSimilarly, row 4: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) are kitchen counters, and (3,4), (4,4) are dispensers -> all non-walkable.\n\nSo the grid:\n\nRow 0: all non-walkable (kitchen counters and pots)\nRow 1: (0,1) and (7,1) are kitchen counters -> non-walkable. The rest (1,1) to (6,1) are walkable? But (1,1) is Alice's position, which is empty? So yes.\n\nRow 2: (0,2) is plate dispenser -> non-walkable. (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) are kitchen counters -> non-walkable. (7,2) is serving counter -> non-walkable. So only (1,2) and (6,2) are walkable? Because (0,2) is non-walkable, (1,2) is not listed as any non-empty tile? So it's empty -> walkable. Similarly, (6,2) is not listed? So walkable.\n\nRow 3: (0,3) and (7,3) are kitchen counters -> non-walkable. The rest (1,3) to (6,3) are walkable? Bob is at (6,3), which is walkable.\n\nRow 4: all non-walkable.\n\nSo the walkable grid:\n\nWe can represent the grid with (x,y) and mark walkable:\n\nRow 0: none\nRow 1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) -> but (0,1) and (7,1) are non-walkable, so yes.\nRow 2: (1,2) and (6,2) only? Because (0,2) is plate dispenser, (2,2) is kitchen counter (and has an onion, but that doesn't affect walkability), (3,2) to (5,2) are kitchen counters, (7,2) is serving counter. So only (1,2) and (6,2) are walkable.\nRow 3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) -> because (0,3) and (7,3) are non-walkable.\nRow 4: none\n\nBut note: we can stand on (1,1) and interact with (1,0) which is a kitchen counter? But (1,0) is non-walkable and adjacent? Similarly, we can stand on (1,1) and face down to interact with (1,0)? But (1,0) is a kitchen counter. However, the rule says: to interact, the player must be on an adjacent empty tile and facing the tile. So we can be at (1,1) and face down to interact with (1,0). Similarly, for pots at (3,0) and (4,0): we can stand at (3,1) and face down to interact with (3,0), or at (4,1) and face down.\n\nNow, the onions on counters are at:\n- (2,2): kitchen counter -> we can interact with it from adjacent walkable tiles. Adjacent walkable tiles to (2,2): (2,1) and (2,3) and (1,2) and (3,2). But (3,2) is non-walkable (kitchen counter). Similarly, (2,1) is walkable? (2,1) is in row1, which is walkable. (2,3) is in row3, walkable. (1,2) is walkable. So we can interact from (2,1) facing up? Because (2,2) is above (2,1) -> so if we are at (2,1) and face up, we can interact with (2,2). Similarly, from (1,2) facing right, or from (2,3) facing down.\n\nSimilarly for (6,4): kitchen counter at (6,4) -> row4, non-walkable. Adjacent walkable: (6,3) is directly below. So we can stand at (6,3) and face up to interact.\n\nSimilarly, (7,1): kitchen counter at (7,1) -> row1. Adjacent walkable: (6,1) to the left? and (7,0) and (7,2) are non-walkable. So only (6,1) is adjacent and walkable. So we must be at (6,1) and face right to interact.\n\nNow, let's plan:\n\nWe need 3 onions in a pot. We have:\n- Bob already holding an onion -> he can put it in a pot.\n- Onions at (2,2), (6,4), (7,1).\n\nWe also have onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) but they are at the top and non-walkable, so we can grab from adjacent. Adjacent to (3,4): (3,3) and (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3). So we can stand at (3,3) and face up to grab an onion from (3,4). Similarly for (4,3) and (4,4).\n\nBut we already have onions available, so we might not need to use the dispensers.\n\nLet's assign tasks:\n\nOption 1: Bob goes to put his onion in a pot. Then we need two more onions. Alice can pick up the onion at (2,2) and put it in the same pot. Then we need one more. Bob or Alice can pick up the onion at (7,1) or (6,4) and put it in the pot.\n\nBut note: the onion at (6,4) is at the top, and Bob is at (6,3) -> he can easily pick it up: at (6,3) facing up and interact to pick up the onion from (6,4). But he is already holding an onion? So he cannot pick up another. So he must put his current onion first.\n\nSo:\n\nStep 1: Bob puts his onion in a pot.\n\nBob is at (6,3). He can go to a pot. The closest pot? (4,0) or (3,0). He is at (6,3). He can go:\n- Down to (6,2) [walkable? (6,2) is walkable? Yes, from row2: (1,2) and (6,2) are walkable. So (6,2) is walkable. Then from (6,2) he can go down? But row1 at (6,1) is walkable. Then from (6,1) he can go left to (5,1), (4,1). Then at (4,1) he can face down to interact with the pot at (4,0).\n\nAlternatively, he can go from (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (4,2)? But (4,2) is non-walkable (kitchen counter). So he cannot go to (4,2). So he must go down to (4,3) then down to (4,2) is blocked. So the only way is to go down to row1 and then left.\n\nSo Bob's path to (4,0):\nFrom (6,3):\n- Move down to (6,2) [turn 1: D]\n- Then down to (6,1) [turn 2: D] -> now at (6,1)\n- Then left to (5,1) [turn 3: L]\n- Then left to (4,1) [turn 4: L]\n- Then face down (if not already) and interact to put the onion into the pot at (4,0) [turn 5: I]\n\nBut Bob's orientation: currently facing up (U). At (6,3) he moved down? Then at (6,2) he is facing down? Then at (6,1) he is facing down? Then when he moves left to (5,1), he will change orientation to left? Then at (4,1) he is facing left? But to interact with (4,0) which is below, he needs to face down. So he must change orientation to down at (4,1) and then interact.\n\nSo Bob's actions:\nTurn 39: Bob moves D to (6,2) -> orientation becomes D (because moving down)\nTurn 40: Bob moves D to (6,1) -> orientation D\nTurn 41: Bob moves L to (5,1) -> orientation L\nTurn 42: Bob moves L to (4,1) -> orientation L\nTurn 43: Bob changes orientation to D (because he needs to face down to interact with (4,0)) -> action D (to face down) -> note: changing orientation without moving. Then he can interact.\nBut the actions: he can do a move or a change orientation or interact. So at turn 43, he can do an orientation change to D? But the action for changing orientation to down is D? But D is also move down. How do we specify?\n\nThe actions: \n- Move: L/R/U/D (which change position and orientation)\n- Change Orientation: L/R/U/D (without moving, only if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty? Actually, the rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is confusing.\n\nRe-read: \n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it's: \n- If you use L/R/U/D and the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty (i.e., not walkable? or not empty tile?), then you don't move, only change orientation. Otherwise, you move? \n\nBut the rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" meaning that when you do a change orientation action, you only change orientation and do not move, but the condition is that the adjacent tile in the direction you want to change to is not empty? Or is that condition for when you try to move?\n\nActually, the rule for movement: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" meaning if you use a move action, you move in that direction and change your orientation to that direction. But if the adjacent tile in that direction is not walkable, then you cannot move? So the move action fails? Or the rule doesn't specify.\n\nSimilarly, for change orientation: it's a separate action that only changes orientation without moving, regardless of adjacent tiles? But the rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This seems to imply that if you try to move and the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move? But that would be for movement, not for change orientation.\n\nI think there is a confusion in the description.\n\nLooking back: \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can: Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1). Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nSo the \"Change Orientation\" action: when you do L/R/U/D for change orientation, if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then you don't move (so you only change orientation). But if it is empty, then you move? That doesn't make sense because then it's the same as a move.\n\nI think the description is poorly worded. I believe the intended meaning is:\n\n- When you use a move action (L/R/U/D), you attempt to move in that direction and change your orientation to that direction. If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty (walkable), then you move. Otherwise, you don't move (but still change orientation? or not?).\n\nBut the rule for movement doesn't specify what happens when blocked.\n\nSimilarly, for change orientation: it's a separate action that only changes your orientation to the specified direction without moving, and it doesn't depend on adjacent tiles.\n\nBut the rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This seems to imply that for change orientation, you don't move (so it's always just orientation change) and the condition about adjacent tile might be a mistake? Or it means that if you use a change orientation action, you do not move (regardless) and only change orientation, and the condition about adjacent tile is irrelevant? \n\nI think it's a typo. In many games, change orientation is a separate action that doesn't move and doesn't require any condition. So I'll assume that.\n\nSo actions:\n- Move: L/R/U/D -> if the adjacent tile in that direction is walkable, then move and change orientation to that direction. If not, then the move fails (no move, but does the orientation change? The rule doesn't specify. To be safe, we assume that if the move is blocked, the player doesn't move and the orientation changes to the direction? Or the orientation doesn't change? The rule doesn't say. But the rule says \"Move: changes position and orientation\" only if the move is successful. So if blocked, no change in position and orientation? \n\nBut then how to change orientation without moving? We have the \"Change Orientation\" action.\n\nThe rule: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is confusing. It might mean that when you use a change orientation action, you don't move (so the \"no move\" part) and the condition \"if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" is not relevant? Or it might be that the change orientation action is only allowed if the adjacent tile in the new direction is not empty? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think we should interpret as:\n\n- Move actions (L/R/U/D): attempt to move in that direction. If the adjacent tile in that direction is an empty tile (walkable), then move and change orientation to that direction. Otherwise, the move fails (no move, and no orientation change? or orientation change? The rule doesn't specify. But typically, if you try to move and are blocked, you don't move and your orientation doesn't change. But the rule says \"changes position and orientation\" only when you move. So if blocked, nothing happens? \n\n- Change Orientation actions (L/R/U/D): change the orientation to that direction without moving, regardless of adjacent tiles.\n\nBut the rule for change orientation says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" which is confusing. I think it might be a mistake. We'll assume that change orientation actions always change orientation without any condition.\n\nSo for Bob at (6,3) facing U:\n\nTo move down to (6,2): he can do action D (move down). Since (6,2) is walkable, he moves to (6,2) and his orientation becomes D.\n\nThen from (6,2) facing D, he can move down to (6,1): action D -> moves to (6,1), orientation D.\n\nThen from (6,1) facing D, he wants to go left to (5,1). He can do action L: which is a move left. Since (5,1) is walkable? (5,1) is in row1, which is walkable. So he moves to (5,1) and orientation becomes L.\n\nThen from (5,1) facing L, he can move left to (4,1): action L -> moves to (4,1), orientation L.\n\nNow at (4,1) facing L. To interact with the pot at (4,0) which is below, he needs to face down. So he must change orientation to down. He can do action D (which is a move down? Or a change orientation? We have two actions: move and change orientation. But the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. How do we differentiate between move and change orientation? \n\nThe action set is the same symbols for both? This is ambiguous.\n\nLooking at the answer format, it's just one letter per action. And the actions are: Move (L/R/U/D) and Change Orientation (L/R/U/D) and Interact (I) and Stay (S).\n\nSo how to specify? The rule doesn't say how to denote change orientation vs move. But the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So probably, when you do U/D/L/R, it is a move action. And there is no separate change orientation action? But that contradicts the rule.\n\nRe-read the rule: \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can: Move (L/R/U/D): ... Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): ... Interact (I): ... Stay (S): ...\"\n\nBut then the action set is listed as {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So how to differentiate? The rule must mean that the actions L/R/U/D can be either a move or a change orientation, depending on the context? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. The rule says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): ...\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): ...\", meaning that both are represented by the same symbols? But then how does the game know?\n\nIn the action history, we see actions like R, D, etc. and they are moves? Because the players changed position.\n\nIn Alice's history: R, R, D, I, I -> she moved right twice, then down, then interacted twice.\n\nBob: R, D, D, U, U -> moved right, down, down, up, up.\n\nSo it seems that L/R/U/D are always move actions? Then how do we change orientation without moving?\n\nThe rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This suggests that when you do L/R/U/D, if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then you don't move (so you change orientation only). If it is empty, you move and change orientation.\n\nSo in effect, the same action L/R/U/D can either move (if the tile is empty) or change orientation (if the tile is not empty).\n\nSo for example, if you are facing a wall and you try to move towards it, you don't move but your orientation changes to that direction.\n\nIn our case, for Bob at (4,1) facing left (L). He wants to face down. The adjacent tile in the down direction is (4,0) which is a pot -> not empty. So if he does action D (which is a move down), since the tile below is not empty, he doesn't move but changes orientation to down.\n\nSo he can do: at (4,1) facing L, he does action D -> since (4,0) is not empty, he doesn't move but changes orientation to D.\n\nThen he can interact (action I) to put the onion in the pot.\n\nSo Bob's actions for the next few turns:\n\nTurn 39: Bob moves D (down) to (6,2) -> orientation D\nTurn 40: Bob moves D (down) to (6,1) -> orientation D\nTurn 41: Bob moves L (left) to (5,1) -> orientation L\nTurn 42: Bob moves L (left) to (4,1) -> orientation L\nTurn 43: Bob does D (which because the tile below is not empty, he doesn't move but changes orientation to D)\nTurn 44: Bob does I (interact) to put the onion in the pot at (4,0)\n\nNow, the pot at (4,0) has one onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice is at (1,1) holding nothing. She can go to the onion at (2,2). How to get there?\n\nAlice at (1,1) facing down (D).\n\nThe onion at (2,2) is at a kitchen counter. To interact, she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nAdjacent walkable tiles to (2,2): (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2). But (3,2) is non-walkable. So (2,1), (2,3), (1,2) are walkable.\n\nThe closest: (2,1) is below (2,2). So if she goes to (2,1) and faces up, she can interact.\n\nPath for Alice:\nFrom (1,1) to (2,1): she can move right to (2,1). But (2,1) is walkable? Yes, row1 is walkable from (1,1) to (6,1). So:\nTurn 39: Alice moves R to (2,1) -> orientation R (because she moved right)\nBut she needs to face up to interact with (2,2). So at (2,1) she is facing right. She can change orientation to up by doing U. But if she does U (move up), the tile above (2,2) is non-walkable? (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so not empty. So if she does U at (2,1), she will not move (because (2,2) is not empty) but will change orientation to up.\n\nThen she can interact.\n\nSo Alice:\nTurn 39: R -> moves to (2,1), orientation R\nTurn 40: U -> since (2,2) is not empty, she doesn't move but changes orientation to U\nTurn 41: I -> picks up the onion from (2,2)\n\nNow she is holding an onion. She needs to put it in the pot. The pot at (4,0) is being used by Bob? But Bob will have put his onion at turn 44. Then the pot will have one onion. We need two more.\n\nAlice can go to the pot at (4,0) to put her onion.\n\nFrom (2,1) facing up, she can move down? But she is facing up. To go to (4,0), she can go right to (3,1) and then to (4,1). But (3,1) is walkable? Yes, row1. Then at (4,1) she can face down and interact.\n\nPath:\nTurn 42: Alice moves R to (3,1) -> orientation R\nTurn 43: Alice moves R to (4,1) -> orientation R\nThen she needs to face down. At (4,1) facing right, she can do D: since (4,0) is not empty, she will change orientation to down without moving.\nTurn 44: Alice does D -> changes orientation to down\nTurn 45: Alice does I -> puts the onion in the pot at (4,0). Now the pot has 2 onions.\n\nWe need one more onion. We have onions at (6,4) and (7,1). Bob is at (4,1) after putting his onion, and he is holding nothing. So Bob can go to pick up another onion.\n\nThe onion at (7,1) is on a kitchen counter. To pick it up, we need to be at (6,1) facing right.\n\nBob is at (4,1) after turn 44. He can go to (6,1):\nFrom (4,1) facing down (after turn 44, he just did I, so orientation is down? No, after he did I at turn 44, he is still at (4,1) and orientation down? Then he can move right to (5,1) and then to (6,1).\n\nActions for Bob after turn 44 (he is at (4,1) facing down):\nTurn 45: Bob moves R to (5,1) -> orientation R\nTurn 46: Bob moves R to (6,1) -> orientation R\nThen at (6,1) facing right, he can interact with (7,1) which is to the right? (7,1) is adjacent and to the right. But (7,1) is a kitchen counter with an onion. So he can do I to pick up the onion.\n\nBut note: (7,1) is at (7,1), which is to the right of (6,1). So yes, he is facing right and adjacent, so he can interact.\n\nTurn 47: Bob does I -> picks up the onion from (7,1)\n\nThen Bob is holding an onion. He needs to put it in the pot at (4,0). He can go back to (4,1) and put it.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (4,1):\nTurn 48: Bob moves L to (5,1) -> orientation L\nTurn 49: Bob moves L to (4,1) -> orientation L\nThen he needs to face down to interact with the pot. So:\nTurn 50: Bob does D -> changes orientation to down (because (4,0) is not empty)\nTurn 51: Bob does I -> puts the onion in the pot.\n\nNow the pot at (4,0) has 3 onions. It will start cooking automatically at the turn when the third onion is added, which is turn 51. Then it will cook for 5 turns. So it will be ready at turn 56.\n\nMeanwhile, we can prepare a plate. We need a plate to serve the soup.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). Alice is free after turn 45 (she put her onion at turn 45). She is at (4,1) facing down. She can go to get a plate.\n\nPath to (0,2): \nFrom (4,1) to (0,2). But (0,2) is a plate dispenser. To interact, she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nAdjacent walkable tiles: (0,1) is a kitchen counter? Non-walkable. (0,3) is kitchen counter, non-walkable. (1,2) is walkable. So she must be at (1,2) and face left to interact with (0,2).\n\nHow to get to (1,2) from (4,1):\nFirst, from (4,1) she can go left to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). Then from (1,1) to (1,2): but (1,2) is above (1,1). So at (1,1) she can move up? But (1,2) is walkable? Yes. So:\nAlice at (4,1) after turn 45 (orientation down):\nTurn 46: move L to (3,1) -> orientation L\nTurn 47: move L to (2,1) -> orientation L\nTurn 48: move L to (1,1) -> orientation L\nThen at (1,1) facing left, she can move up to (1,2): action U. Since (1,2) is walkable, she moves to (1,2) and orientation U.\nThen at (1,2) facing up, she needs to face left to interact with (0,2). So she can do action L: since (0,2) is not empty (it's a dispenser), she will change orientation to left without moving.\nThen interact.\n\nSo:\nTurn 49: Alice moves U to (1,2) -> orientation U\nTurn 50: Alice does L -> changes orientation to left (because (0,2) is not empty)\nTurn 51: Alice does I -> grabs a plate. Now she is holding a plate.\n\nThen she can wait for the soup to be ready at turn 56. The soup is at (4,0). She is at (1,2). She can go to (4,1) to get the soup.\n\nPath from (1,2) to (4,1):\nFirst, down to (1,1): action D -> moves to (1,1), orientation D\nThen right to (2,1), (3,1), (4,1).\n\nActions:\nTurn 52: Alice moves D to (1,1) -> orientation D\nTurn 53: Alice moves R to (2,1) -> orientation R\nTurn 54: Alice moves R to (3,1) -> orientation R\nTurn 55: Alice moves R to (4,1) -> orientation R\nThen she needs to face down to interact with the pot to get the soup. So:\nTurn 56: Alice does D -> changes orientation to down (since (4,0) is not empty)\nTurn 57: Alice does I -> picks up the soup (if the soup is ready). Since the soup started cooking at turn 51, and cooking time is 5 turns, so at turn 56 it has been 5 turns? Turn 51 is when the third onion is put, so the cooking starts at the beginning of turn 52? Or at the end of turn 51? We need to check when the pot starts cooking.\n\nThe rule: \"add ingredient (if pot is not full and player is holding ingredient) → cooks automatically at 3 ingredients.\"\n\nSo when the third ingredient is added, the cooking starts immediately. Then it takes 5 turns to cook. So the soup will be ready at turn 51 + 5 = 56. So at turn 57, Alice can interact to get the soup.\n\nThen she needs to deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) holding the soup, she can go to (7,2). But (7,2) is a serving counter. Adjacent walkable tiles: (7,1) is non-walkable, (7,3) is non-walkable, (6,2) is walkable. So she must be at (6,2) and face right to interact with (7,2).\n\nPath from (4,1) to (6,2):\nFirst, from (4,1) to (5,1), (6,1), then up to (6,2). But (6,2) is above (6,1). So:\nAlice at (4,1) after turn 57 (orientation down? After I, she is still at (4,1) and orientation down? Then:\nTurn 58: move R to (5,1) -> orientation R\nTurn 59: move R to (6,1) -> orientation R\nThen at (6,1) facing right, she can move up to (6,2): action U. (6,2) is walkable, so she moves to (6,2) and orientation U.\nThen she needs to face right to interact with (7,2). So she can do action R: since (7,2) is not empty, she changes orientation to right without moving.\nThen interact.\n\nSo:\nTurn 60: Alice moves U to (6,2) -> orientation U\nTurn 61: Alice does R -> changes orientation to right\nTurn 62: Alice does I -> delivers the soup, gets 20 reward.\n\nThis is a long sequence. But we are only asked to plan for the next several turns, say H=10 or so? We can start with the first few actions.\n\nWe are at turn 39. We need to output actions for Alice for turns 39, 40, ... and optionally Bob? But the task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But in the answer format, it only shows one action per turn for Alice? Or do we need to specify both?\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but the answer format only shows one action per turn, labeled by turn. And it says \"for Alice\". So probably only Alice's actions.\n\nBut we must coordinate with Bob. So we assume that we control Alice and can suggest Bob's actions, but the output is only for Alice.\n\nThe task: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\" and \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only shows Alice's actions per turn.\n\nSo I think we only output Alice's actions.\n\nBut then we have to assume Bob will do what we expect? Or we can only control Alice.\n\nWe must plan Alice's actions based on the state and expected Bob behavior.\n\nBut in the current state, Bob is holding an onion and we expect him to go to the pot to put it. We can plan for Alice accordingly.\n\nSo for the first few turns, Alice's actions:\n\nAt turn 39: Alice moves R to (2,1)\nAt turn 40: Alice changes orientation to up (by doing U, which doesn't move because (2,2) is not empty) -> orientation becomes U\nAt turn 41: Alice interacts to pick up the onion at (2,2)\n\nThen she can start moving to the pot.\n\nBut Bob might be moving to the pot at the same time.\n\nWe need to avoid collision? The rule: players cannot walk onto each other.\n\nAt turn 39, Bob is at (6,3) and we plan for him to move down to (6,2). Alice is at (1,1) moving to (2,1). No conflict.\n\nTurn 40: Alice at (2,1) doing U (no move). Bob at (6,2) moving down to (6,1). No conflict.\n\nTurn 41: Alice at (2,1) picks up onion. Bob at (6,1) moving left to (5,1). Alice then at turn 42: moves R to (3,1). Bob at (5,1) moving left to (4,1). Then turn 43: Alice moves R to (4,1) -> but Bob is also moving to (4,1) at the same turn? That would be a collision.\n\nProblem: at turn 42, Bob moves from (5,1) to (4,1). Alice moves from (3,1) to (4,1) at the same time? They both try to move to (4,1) at turn 43? (If we count the turns)\n\nLet's align the turns:\n\nTurn 39:\n- Alice: R -> to (2,1)\n- Bob: D -> to (6,2)\n\nTurn 40:\n- Alice: U -> changes orientation to up (stays at (2,1))\n- Bob: D -> to (6,1)\n\nTurn 41:\n- Alice: I -> picks up onion at (2,2) (still at (2,1))\n- Bob: L -> to (5,1)\n\nTurn 42:\n- Alice: R -> to (3,1)\n- Bob: L -> to (4,1)\n\nTurn 43:\n- Alice: R -> to (4,1) but (4,1) is occupied by Bob? Bob is at (4,1) at the end of turn 42. So at turn 43, Alice tries to move to (4,1) which is occupied by Bob -> collision? The rule says players cannot walk onto each other. So Alice cannot move to (4,1) if Bob is there.\n\nTherefore, we need to avoid that.\n\nAlice can wait one turn or take a different path.\n\nAt turn 42, Alice is at (3,1). Instead of moving right to (4,1) which will be occupied by Bob, she can change orientation or wait.\n\nBut she needs to put the onion in the pot. She can go to the other pot at (3,0)? But the pot at (3,0) is adjacent to (3,1). So she can put the onion in (3,0) from (3,1) facing down.\n\nSo at turn 43, Alice at (3,1) can do D to change orientation to down (since (3,0) is not empty), then interact to put the onion in (3,0).\n\nThen the pot at (3,0) has one onion. Bob is putting his onion in (4,0). Then we have two pots with one onion each. We need to concentrate on one pot.\n\nWe can have one pot with two onions and then add the third.\n\nBut it might be inefficient. Alternatively, Alice can wait for Bob to leave (4,1).\n\nAt turn 43, Bob is at (4,1) and he will do D (to face down) and then I at turn 44 to put the onion. Then at turn 44, Bob is still at (4,1) but after putting, he is free. Then Alice can move to (4,1) at turn 44.\n\nSo:\n\nAdjust Alice's actions:\n\nTurn 42: Alice moves R to (3,1) -> orientation R\nThen turn 43: Alice does S (stay) to avoid collision? Or she can change orientation to down and interact with (3,0) to put the onion in the other pot.\n\nBut if she puts in (3,0), then we have two pots with one onion each. Then we need to put two more in one of them. It might be better to use the same pot.\n\nSo she can wait at (3,1) for one turn.\n\nTurn 43: Alice does S (stay)\nThen turn 44: Bob has put his onion and is still at (4,1). But he will leave to get another onion? Not immediately. At turn 44, Bob does I to put the onion, then he is at (4,1) holding nothing.\n\nThen at turn 44, Alice can move to (4,1)? But Bob is there. So she cannot.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 44, Bob will do I and stay at (4,1). Then Alice cannot move to (4,1).\n\nSo Alice must use the other pot.\n\nLet's use the pot at (3,0) for Alice.\n\nAt turn 43: Alice at (3,1) facing right. She can change orientation to down: action D -> changes to down\nTurn 44: Alice does I -> puts the onion in (3,0)\n\nNow pot (3,0) has one onion, and pot (4,0) has one onion (from Bob).\n\nWe need to put two more onions in one pot. Let's choose pot (4,0).\n\nBob is at (4,1) holding nothing. He can go to get another onion, say at (7,1) or (6,4). He is close to (7,1).\n\nAlice is at (3,1) holding nothing. She can also go to get an onion.\n\nBut we need to coordinate.\n\nBob can go to (7,1) to pick up the onion there.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (6,1): two moves.\nThen interact with (7,1) from (6,1) facing right.\n\nAlice can go to (6,4) to pick up the onion? But (6,4) is at the top. From (3,1) to (6,4): long path.\n\nAlternatively, there is an onion at (6,4) which is closer to Bob? Bob is at (4,1), and (6,4) is at (6,4). To pick up from (6,4), stand at (6,3) facing up.\n\nBob can go to (6,3) from (4,1): \n- Move to (5,1), (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3). But (6,2) is walkable, (6,3) is walkable.\n\nActions for Bob after turn 44 (he is at (4,1) facing down):\nTurn 45: R to (5,1) -> orientation R\nTurn 46: R to (6,1) -> orientation R\nTurn 47: U to (6,2) -> orientation U\nTurn 48: U to (6,3) -> orientation U\nThen at (6,3) facing up, he can interact with (6,4) to pick up the onion: turn 49: I.\n\nThen he can put it in the pot at (4,0).\n\nMeanwhile, Alice can go to (7,1) to get the onion there? But Bob is using that path? Or she can go to the dispenser to get a new onion.\n\nBut we have an onion at (7,1) on the counter.\n\nAlice is at (3,1) after turn 44. She can go to (7,1) to pick up the onion, but it's far.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,1): right to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). But (4,1) is occupied by Bob until turn 44. At turn 45, Bob moves to (5,1), so (4,1) is free.\n\nAlice at turn 45: move R to (4,1) -> orientation R\nTurn 46: move R to (5,1) -> orientation R\nTurn 47: move R to (6,1) -> orientation R\nThen at (6,1) facing right, she can interact with (7,1) to pick up the onion: turn 48: I.\n\nThen she is holding an onion. She can put it in the pot at (4,0) or (3,0). Let's put it in (4,0) to have two onions there.\n\nSo from (6,1) to (4,1): \nTurn 49: move L to (5,1) -> orientation L\nTurn 50: move L to (4,1) -> orientation L\nThen face down and interact.\n\nBut Bob is also coming with an onion to put in the same pot.\n\nThis might be messy.\n\nGiven the complexity, for the first few turns, we output Alice's actions for turns 39 to about 45 or so.\n\nFor turn 39 to 41: Alice picks up the onion at (2,2) as before.\n\nThen turn 42: move to (3,1)\nTurn 43: change orientation to down (D action) to face the pot at (3,0)\nTurn 44: interact to put the onion in (3,0)\n\nThen she is free. She can then go to get another onion.\n\nBut since we are only planning for a few turns, we can stop at turn 44 or 45.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 39: R  (move right to (2,1))\nTurn 40: U  (change orientation to up, because (2,2) is not empty)\nTurn 41: I  (pick up onion from (2,2))\nTurn 42: R  (move right to (3,1))\nTurn 43: D  (change orientation to down, because (3,0) is not empty)\nTurn 44: I  (put onion in pot at (3,0))\n\nThen she is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nThis is 6 actions.\n\nWe can output these.\n\nBob will put his onion in (4,0) by turn 44, so we have two onions in two pots.\n\nThen we can continue later to put the third onion in one of the pots.\n\nBut for now, this is a partial plan.\n\nTo maximize the reward, we should try to fill one pot as soon as possible.\n\nAlternative plan: Alice goes to (7,1) to pick up the onion there and put it in the pot, but it's farther.\n\nGiven the current state, the above plan is reasonable.\n\nSo Alice's actions for turns 39 to 44:\n\nTurn 39: R\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: I\nTurn 42: R\nTurn 43: D\nTurn 44: I\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 39: R\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: I\nTurn 42: R\nTurn 43: D\nTurn 44: I\n}\n\nThis is for turns 39 to 44, 6 turns.\n\nWe can extend if needed, but the task says \"over next several turns\", so this is acceptable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob must collaborate to deliver a soup recipe (specifically, the 3-onion recipe with a 20-point reward). The current game state shows both players are free to collect onions and fill a pot. Alice should prioritize gathering an available onion and depositing it into a pot, while Bob (already holding an onion) should deposit his onion into a pot. This plan focuses on Alice's actions for the next 6 turns (turns 39 to 44), leveraging her position and available resources. Bob is expected to move toward the pot at (4,0) to deposit his onion during this time.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan:\n- **Turn 39: Move right (R)** to (2,1). This positions Alice adjacent to the kitchen counter at (2,2) which holds an onion.\n- **Turn 40: Change orientation to up (U)**. Since (2,2) is a non-empty tile, this action changes Alice's orientation to up without moving, allowing her to face the onion on (2,2).\n- **Turn 41: Interact (I)** to pick up the onion from (2,2). Alice is now holding an onion.\n- **Turn 42: Move right (R)** to (3,1). This moves Alice closer to the pot at (3,0) while avoiding Bob's path to (4,0).\n- **Turn 43: Change orientation to down (D)**. Since (3,0) is a non-empty tile, this action changes Alice's orientation to down without moving, facing the pot.\n- **Turn 44: Interact (I)** to deposit the onion into the pot at (3,0). Alice is now empty-handed, and the pot has one onion.\n\n### Coordination with Bob:\n- Bob (at (6,3) holding an onion) is expected to:\n  - Move down to (6,2) on turn 39.\n  - Move down to (6,1) on turn 40.\n  - Move left to (5,1) on turn 41.\n  - Move left to (4,1) on turn 42.\n  - Change orientation to down on turn 43 (since (4,0) is non-empty).\n  - Deposit his onion into the pot at (4,0) on turn 44.\n- This ensures both pots receive one onion each by turn 44. Alice and Bob can then work to add a third onion to one pot (e.g., using the onion at (6,4) or (7,1)) and start cooking, but this is beyond the current planning horizon.\n\n### Why this plan?\n- **Efficiency**: Alice collects a readily available onion from (2,2) in minimal turns, while Bob deposits his onion. Using separate pots initially avoids collisions and speeds up ingredient collection.\n- **Reward Potential**: Filling pots early sets up the 3-onion soup (5-turn cook time), enabling delivery by turn 56+ for 20 points.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: Alice moves to (3,1) instead of (4,1) on turn 42, preventing overlap with Bob (who moves to (4,1) on turn 42).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 39: R \\\\\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: I \\\\\nTurn 42: R \\\\\nTurn 43: D \\\\\nTurn 44: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current game state and plan actions for Alice to maximize rewards. The goal is to deliver soup recipes. The only recipe given is Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns. There are no tomato dispensers, so we can only make onion soup.\n\nKey elements:\n\n- **Dispensers**: Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\n- **Pots**: At (3,0) and (4,0).\n\n- **Serving Counter**: At (7,2).\n\n- **Kitchen Counters**: Some have onions: (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4). All have onions, so we can use these for ingredients.\n\nAlice is at (3,1) facing right, holding nothing. Bob is at (5,3) facing up, holding nothing.\n\nAction history: Alice's recent actions: I, I, R, D, R. Bob's: U, U, L, U, I. But since we're at turn 42, and we need to plan from t1=42 onwards, the history might give context, but I should focus on the current state.\n\nSince pots are empty, we need to fill a pot with 3 onions to start cooking. Cooking takes 5 turns, then we need to serve it with a plate.\n\nPlayers can carry one item at a time, so coordination is key.\n\nAvailable onions: On kitchen counters at (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4). Also, we can get onions directly from dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nBut using onions from counters might be faster than going to dispensers, depending on positions.\n\nAlice is at (3,1). Let me sketch the grid mentally. Positions:\n\n- Rows: y=0 to y=4? From tile list, y=0 to 4.\n\n- Columns: x=0 to 7.\n\nAlice at (3,1). Facing right, which is increasing x.\n\nBob at (5,3) facing up, which is increasing y.\n\nPots at (3,0) and (4,0) on the bottom row.\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) on top row.\n\nKitchen counters with onions: (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4).\n\n(6,4) and (5,4) are near the onion dispensers, since (4,4) and (3,4) are dispensers, (5,4) and (6,4) are counters with onions.\n\nSimilarly, (7,1) is near serving counter (7,2), and (2,2) is near plate dispenser (0,2).\n\nTo make soup, we need to put 3 onions in a pot. Pot will cook for 5 turns, then someone needs to grab a plate, serve the soup from the pot, and deliver to serving counter.\n\nSince cooking takes time, we should start cooking as soon as possible.\n\nAlso, we can use onions from counters to save time.\n\nAlice is at (3,1). She is one step above pot at (3,0). Since she's facing right, and (3,0) is below her? Positions: (3,1) is above (3,0), so if she faces down, she can interact with pot.\n\nBut she's facing right now.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (5,3), which is above (5,2), but (5,2) is a kitchen counter? Tile types: kitchen counters include (5,2)? From list: kitchen counters are at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), etc. Yes, (5,2) is a kitchen counter, but currently no item on it? Non-empty counters are listed: (2,2) has onion, (6,4) has onion, (7,1) has onion, (5,4) has onion. (5,2) is empty, I think.\n\nNon-empty kitchen counters are specified: (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4) have onions. Others are empty or not mentioned.\n\nNow, plan for Alice. Since Bob is also there, we can assume Bob will cooperate, but the task is to plan for Alice, optionally for Bob. I think I should focus on Alice, but consider Bob's position for coordination.\n\nThe answer format is for Alice's actions, but since it's collaboration, I might suggest actions for both, but the format says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but the boxed answer might be only for Alice? Let me check.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" but the answer format shows only turns with actions, probably for Alice. It says \"for Alice\" in the boxed part.\n\nLook: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\" and it says \"each action a_t\" for Alice, I think. But it might be ambiguous.\n\nReading: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but in answer format, it's listed as turns with actions, without specifying player. Probably, since it's Alice's actions, we list hers.\n\nTo be safe, I'll plan for Alice, and assume Bob will act reasonably.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we need both to work together.\n\nPerhaps I should define a plan for both.\n\nSince the task is to help Alice collaborate, I can plan Alice's actions with the expectation that Bob will do complementary tasks.\n\nGiven the state, let's see what needs to be done.\n\nObjective: Get a pot cooking with 3 onions.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0), both empty.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), so she can easily access pot at (3,0) by moving down or facing down.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (5,3), which is not close to pots; (5,3) to (3,0) or (4,0) is a bit far.\n\n(5,3) to (4,0): x from 5 to 4, y from 3 to 0, so 2 steps down and 1 left, or something. But there might be obstacles.\n\nGrid: Let me map the tiles.\n\nList of all tiles might help, but I have positions.\n\nFrom tile types, we know what is walkable.\n\nEmpty tiles are walkable, but dispensers, pots, counters are not walkable, but players can be adjacent to interact.\n\nPlayers can only walk on empty tiles, I think.\n\nFrom rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And non-empty tiles include dispensers, pots, counters, etc., which are fixed.\n\nSo, players move on empty tiles.\n\nAlice at (3,1), which is empty? Not listed in non-empty, so yes.\n\n(3,1) is not in kitchen counter list or others, so it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (5,3), empty.\n\nNow, Alice can move to interact with things.\n\nFirst, to fill a pot, we need onions.\n\nOnions available on counters: (2,2), (7,1), (5,4), (6,4).\n\n(7,1) has onion, and serving counter is at (7,2), so close.\n\n(5,4) and (6,4) are near onion dispensers.\n\n(2,2) is near plate dispenser (0,2).\n\nAlice is at (3,1). Let's see distances.\n\nTo (2,2): from (3,1) to (2,2): one left and one up, but since she has to move step by step, and orientation matters for interact.\n\nInteract requires facing the tile and adjacent.\n\nSo for Alice to pick up onion from (2,2), she needs to be adjacent and face it.\n\n(2,2) is kitchen counter with onion.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (2,2): (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), (2,3), but need to see if those are empty and walkable.\n\n(3,2) is a kitchen counter, which is not walkable, so players cannot be on (3,2), but can be adjacent on empty tiles.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2): not listed, so empty? Kitchen counters include (0,1), (7,1), etc., but (1,2) not in list, so probably empty.\n\nTile types: kitchen counters are at specific positions, so other tiles are either empty or other types.\n\nFrom list: kitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\nAlso, dispensers: onion at (3,4), (4,4), plate at (0,2), pots at (3,0), (4,0), serving at (7,2).\n\nSo, for example, tiles like (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), etc., are not listed, so they are empty and walkable.\n\n(5,3) is Bob's position, empty.\n\nBack to Alice at (3,1).\n\nTo reach (2,2) which has onion: (2,2) is kitchen counter, so Alice needs to be on an adjacent empty tile and face (2,2).\n\nAdjacent to (2,2): possible positions: (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), (2,3).\n\n(3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so cannot be there.\n\n(2,1): is this empty? Not listed, so yes, empty.\n\n(1,2): empty? Not listed, so empty.\n\n(2,3): not listed, empty.\n\nSo Alice can be at (2,1), (1,2), or (2,3) to interact with (2,2).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFrom (3,1), to go to (2,1): move left (L), then she would be at (2,1) facing left if she moves left, but orientation changes with move or separately.\n\nActions: Move actions change position and orientation to the direction moved. Change orientation only changes facing without moving if adjacent tile is not empty, but for interact, she needs to be adjacent and facing.\n\nFirst, Alice at (3,1), facing right.\n\nShe can move down to (3,0), but (3,0) is a pot, which is not empty, so she cannot move there. Players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles.\n\nSo to interact with pot at (3,0), she needs to be adjacent and face it.\n\nAdjacent to (3,0): (3,1), (4,0), (2,0), (3,-1) but y=-1 invalid, so (3,1) above, (4,0) right, (2,0) left.\n\n(4,0) is pot, not walkable, (2,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so only possible adjacent tile is (3,1) itself? No, (3,1) is where she is.\n\nShe is at (3,1), which is adjacent to (3,0) below.\n\nSince she is at (3,1), and (3,0) is directly below, if she faces down, she can interact with it.\n\nCurrently she is facing right, so she needs to change orientation to down or move down, but move down to (3,0) is not possible since it's not empty.\n\nSo she can only change orientation to down without moving, then interact.\n\nSimilarly for other objects.\n\nSo for pot at (3,0), from (3,1), she can face down and interact.\n\nSimilarly, for other positions.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nTo start cooking, we need to add onions to a pot.\n\nAlice is close to pot at (3,0), so she could be the one to add ingredients, but she needs to have onions.\n\nShe is holding nothing, so she needs to get an onion first.\n\nNearest onions: on counters.\n\n(2,2) has onion, which is close: from (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nTo pick up from (2,2), she needs to be adjacent and face it.\n\nPossible adjacent tiles: (2,1), (1,2), or (2,3).\n\n(2,1) is directly below (2,2), (1,2) left, (2,3) above.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move left to (2,1) — that's one move L, which would put her at (2,1) facing left.\n\nThen from (2,1), (2,2) is above her, so she needs to face up to interact with (2,2).\n\nAfter moving to (2,1) facing left, she can change orientation to up (U), then interact (I) to pick up onion.\n\nSimilarly, she could go to (1,2) or (2,3), but (2,1) is closer.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (2,1): move L, to (2,1) facing left.\n\nThen from there, to face (2,2) which is up, so change orientation to U.\n\nThen interact I to pick up onion.\n\nThen she has onion.\n\nThen she can go to pot at (3,0).\n\nFrom (2,1), to (3,1) move R to (3,1) facing right.\n\nThen at (3,1), face down to interact with pot (3,0).\n\nSince pot is empty, adding onion will start the pot with one onion.\n\nBut we need three onions.\n\nSo she needs to get more onions or Bob can help.\n\nSimilarly, there are other onions on counters.\n\nBob is at (5,3), holding nothing.\n\nHe can also get onions.\n\nFor example, (7,1) has onion, which is close to Bob? (5,3) to (7,1): x from 5 to 7, y from 3 to 1, so down and right.\n\n(6,1) is empty, (7,1) is kitchen counter with onion, so Bob can be at (6,1) or (7,2) or (7,0) but (7,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable, (7,2) is serving counter, not walkable.\n\nAdjacent to (7,1): (6,1), (7,0), (7,2), (8,1) invalid, so only (6,1) is possible, since (7,0) and (7,2) not walkable.\n\n(7,0) is kitchen counter, not empty, so players cannot be there. Only empty tiles for players.\n\nSo for (7,1), only adjacent empty tile is (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is empty, I think. Not listed, so yes.\n\nBob at (5,3), he can move to (6,1) via (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he needs to go around.\n\nFrom (5,3), he can move down to (5,2)? No, (5,2) not empty, cannot move there.\n\nMove left to (4,3)? (4,3) not listed, probably empty.\n\nMove right to (6,3)? (6,3) not listed, empty.\n\nMove up to (5,4)? (5,4) is kitchen counter with onion, not empty, cannot move there.\n\nSo from (5,3), possible moves: L to (4,3), R to (6,3), D to (5,2) not possible, U to (5,4) not possible. So only L or R or S or change orientation.\n\nHe can move L to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n\nThen from there to (6,1).\n\nFor example, from (5,3) move R to (6,3) facing right.\n\nThen from (6,3) move down to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed, but kitchen counters include (6,0), (6,4), not (6,2)? Kitchen counters: from list, (6,0), (6,4), and (2,2), etc., no (6,2), so (6,2) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) empty.\n\nSo from (6,3) move D to (6,2) facing down, then D to (6,1) facing down.\n\nThen at (6,1), face left to interact with (7,1) which has onion.\n\n(7,1) is to the right of (6,1), so if he faces right, he can interact.\n\nSimilarly, he could go to other onions.\n\nBut let's think about efficiency.\n\nSince Alice is near pot and near (2,2) onion, she can start by getting that onion and adding to pot.\n\nBob can get another onion from somewhere.\n\nFor example, (5,4) has onion, which is closer to Bob? (5,4) is kitchen counter with onion.\n\nBob at (5,3), (5,4) is directly above, but (5,4) not empty, so he cannot move there.\n\nTo interact with (5,4), he needs to be adjacent: possible (5,3), (4,4), (5,5) invalid, (6,4).\n\n(5,3) is where he is, so from (5,3), (5,4) is above, so if he faces up, he can interact with (5,4).\n\nCurrently he is facing up, because action history U,U,L,U,I, last action I, but orientation is U, as per state.\n\nBob position (5,3), orientation U, holding nothing.\n\nSo at (5,3), facing up, (5,4) is directly above, so he can interact (I) to pick up onion from (5,4), since he is adjacent and facing it.\n\nIs that possible? (5,4) is kitchen counter with onion, and Bob at (5,3) facing up, so yes, he can interact to pick up the onion.\n\nThen he would be holding an onion.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can do her thing.\n\nSo let's plan turn by turn.\n\nFirst, at turn 42:\n\nAlice is at (3,1) facing right, holding nothing. She can move to get the onion at (2,2).\n\nTo do that, she needs to be at (2,1) or (1,2) or (2,3) and face (2,2).\n\nClosest is (2,1): move left (L) to (2,1), facing left.\n\nThen, she needs to face up to interact with (2,2).\n\nSo after moving to (2,1), she can change orientation to up (U), then interact (I).\n\nBut each turn one action.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 42: Alice moves L to (2,1), now at (2,1) facing left.\n\nThen turn 43: Alice changes orientation to U (up), now facing up at (2,1).\n\nThen turn 44: Alice interacts (I) with (2,2) to pick up onion, now holding onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can act. But we're planning for Alice, so I'll focus on Alice's actions, and assume Bob will do something reasonable.\n\nSince we need to maximize reward, perhaps we should coordinate.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan Alice's actions.\n\nAfter Alice has onion, she can go to the pot to add it.\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move right to (3,1), facing right.\n\nThen at (3,1), face down to interact with pot (3,0).\n\nSo turn 45: Alice moves R to (3,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 46: Alice changes orientation to D (down), facing down.\n\nTurn 47: Alice interacts (I) with pot (3,0) to add onion. Now pot has one onion, Alice holding nothing.\n\nPot at (3,0) now has one onion.\n\nWe need two more onions for the pot.\n\nAlice can get another onion.\n\nThere is onion at (7,1), but far, or at (5,4), (6,4), etc.\n\n(6,4) has onion, but far from Alice.\n\nBob is at (5,3), and he can pick up onion from (5,4) as I thought earlier.\n\nSince he is facing up at (5,3), he can interact directly to pick up from (5,4).\n\nIn the current state, Bob can act on his turn.\n\nBut since we're at turn 42, and actions are simultaneous or sequential? In Overcooked, turns are simultaneous, I think, but the planning is per player.\n\nThe action history shows separate actions, so probably players act sequentially in the game model.\n\nThe state is given at turn 42, and we plan actions from t1=42 onwards.\n\nFor Alice, we plan her sequence.\n\nBob will act based on his own or collaboration.\n\nTo be precise, I should only plan for Alice.\n\nBut to make it work, I can suggest what Bob should do.\n\nSince the task is to help Alice collaborate, I'll plan Alice's actions with the assumption that Bob will handle other tasks.\n\nAfter Alice adds one onion, she can get another onion.\n\nNearest available onion: (7,1) or others.\n\n(2,2) is now empty, since she took the onion.\n\nOther onions: (7,1), (6,4), (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is near Bob.\n\n(6,4) also.\n\n(7,1) is south-west.\n\nAlice at (3,1) after adding onion.\n\nShe can go to (7,1) to get onion, but it's far.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,1): need to go right and down, but y=1, x from 3 to 7.\n\nTiles: (4,1) empty, (5,1) empty, (6,1) empty, (7,1) counter.\n\nTo interact with (7,1), she needs to be at (6,1) and face right.\n\n(6,1) is adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,1), move R to (4,1) facing right, then R to (5,1) facing right, then R to (6,1) facing right, then face right to interact with (7,1)? (7,1) is to the right of (6,1), so if at (6,1) facing right, she can interact.\n\nBut (6,1) to (7,1) is east, so facing right.\n\nBut that's multiple moves.\n\nSimilarly, there is onion at (5,4) and (6,4), but (5,4) and (6,4) are at y=4, top row.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (5,4): need to go up and right.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nFor example, kitchen counters at (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), etc.\n\n(3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so from (3,1), she can move up to (3,2)? No, not empty, cannot.\n\nSo she needs to go around.\n\nMove right to (4,1), then up to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter, cannot.\n\nThen to (4,3)? (4,3) empty, then to (5,3), but Bob might be there or not.\n\nAt turn 42, Bob is at (5,3), but he will move.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nSince Bob is near (5,4), he can get that onion and bring it to the pot.\n\nSimilarly for (6,4).\n\nAlice can get the onion from (7,1) or from dispenser.\n\nBut dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4), which are also at top.\n\n(3,4) onion dispenser, from (3,1) to (3,4): directly above, but (3,2) is counter, not walkable, so she needs to go around, e.g., to (2,1) or (4,1), then to (2,2) but (2,2) now empty, or to (2,3), etc.\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can use the onion from (7,1), but it's farther.\n\nOr, since there are multiple onions on counters, and pots, perhaps use both players to fill the pot faster.\n\nBut Alice just added one onion, now pot has one, need two more.\n\nBob can add one quickly.\n\nBob at (5,3) facing up, can interact to pick up onion from (5,4) on turn 42.\n\nThen he has onion, and he can go to pot to add it.\n\nPots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nFrom (5,3) to (4,0): for example, move down to (5,2)? Not possible, (5,2) counter.\n\nMove left to (4,3), then down to (4,2) not possible, so to (4,1), then to (4,0) not possible.\n\nTo add to pot at (4,0), he needs to be adjacent, e.g. at (4,1) and face down.\n\n(4,1) is empty.\n\nFrom (5,3), he can move left to (4,3) facing left.\n\nThen move down to (4,2)? (4,2) counter, cannot.\n\nThen to (4,1) directly from (4,3)? Move down from (4,3) to (4,2) not possible, so he can move down only if tile below empty, but (4,2) not empty.\n\nSo from (4,3), he can only move left to (3,3) or right to (5,3), or up to (4,4) not empty, or down not possible.\n\n(4,4) is onion dispenser, not empty.\n\nSo from (4,3), possible moves: L to (3,3), R to (5,3), U to (4,4) not possible, D to (4,2) not possible. So only L or R or change orientation or S.\n\nThen to reach (4,1), he needs to go to (3,3) or (5,3), then to (3,2) not possible, etc.\n\nFrom (5,3), he can move down to (5,2) not possible, so he can only move left or right.\n\nMove left to (4,3), then from (4,3) move down not possible, so move left to (3,3), then from (3,3) move down to (3,2) not possible, (3,2) counter.\n\nSo he can only go to (3,3), then to (3,4)? (3,4) dispenser not empty.\n\nThe only way down is via y=1 row.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) move right to (6,3), then down to (6,2), then down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), but (5,1) empty, then to (4,1), etc.\n\nComplicated.\n\nSince Alice is at (3,1), and pot at (3,0), she can stay there and let Bob bring onions to her or to the pot.\n\nBut players can place items on kitchen counters for storage.\n\nFor example, Bob can get onion and place it on a counter near the pot, then Alice can pick it up and add to pot.\n\nKitchen counters near pot: for example, (2,0) is kitchen counter, but has no item? Non-empty counters are listed, (2,0) not mentioned, so empty or no item.\n\nKitchen counters are tiles, some have items, some empty.\n\nNear (3,0) pot, adjacent counters: (2,0) kitchen counter, (4,0) pot, (3,1) is empty tile where Alice is.\n\n(2,0) is kitchen counter, which can hold items.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0), (5,0), etc.\n\nBut (2,0) is adjacent to pot (3,0)? (2,0) left of (3,0), (4,0) right, but both are not empty tiles.\n\nPlayers can place items on empty kitchen counters.\n\nFor example, there is a kitchen counter at (3,2), but it has no item? Not listed as non-empty, so empty.\n\n(3,2) is a kitchen counter tile, and since not listed as non-empty, it has no item, so Alice or Bob can place items there.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2), (5,2), etc.\n\n(3,2) is directly above (3,1), but (3,2) is counter, not walkable, but Alice at (3,1) can interact with (3,2) if she faces up.\n\n(3,2) is above (3,1), so from (3,1), facing up, she can interact with (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, for the pot below.\n\nSo, strategy: Alice can stay at (3,1) and coordinate.\n\nBut let's make a plan.\n\nFirst, at turn 42, Bob can pick up onion from (5,4) since he is facing up at (5,3), so he can I to pick up.\n\nThen he has onion.\n\nHe can go towards the pot.\n\nFor example, move left to (4,3), facing left.\n\nThen down not possible, so move left to (3,3), facing left.\n\nThen from (3,3), (3,2) is kitchen counter below, which is empty, so he can face down to interact with (3,2) and place the onion there, if he wants to store it.\n\nThen Alice can pick it up from below at (3,1).\n\nBut Alice is at (3,1).\n\nLet's timeline.\n\nTurn 42:\n\nAlice: move L to (2,1), facing left. (as I thought earlier)\n\nBob: interact I with (5,4) to pick up onion, now holding onion.\n\nThen turn 43:\n\nAlice: change orientation to U at (2,1), facing up.\n\nBob: now at (5,3) holding onion, facing? After interact, orientation might stay or not, but usually in such games, orientation doesn't change on interact, so still facing up.\n\nHe can move left to (4,3), facing left.\n\nThen turn 44:\n\nAlice: interact I with (2,2) to pick up onion, now holding onion.\n\nBob: at (4,3) facing left, move left to (3,3), facing left.\n\nThen turn 45:\n\nAlice: at (2,1) holding onion, she can move R to (3,1), facing right.\n\nBob: at (3,3) holding onion, facing left. He can change orientation to down to face (3,2), then interact to place onion on (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is kitchen counter, empty, so he can place the onion there.\n\nSo Bob places onion on (3,2).\n\nThen turn 46:\n\nAlice: at (3,1) facing right, holding onion. She can change orientation to down to face pot (3,0), but she is holding onion, so she can interact to add to pot.\n\nPot has one onion from earlier? No, not yet.\n\nAt turn 44, Alice picked up onion, but hasn't added to pot yet.\n\nAt turn 45, Alice moves to (3,1), but at turn 45, Bob is placing onion on (3,2).\n\nLet's keep track.\n\nAt turn 47: Alice can interact with pot.\n\nBut let's list Alice's actions.\n\nFor Alice:\n\nTurn 42: move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 43: change orientation U (to face up)\n\nTurn 44: interact I to pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nTurn 45: move R to (3,1), facing right\n\nAt (3,1), she can now interact with pot below or counter above.\n\nPot has no onion yet, so she can add her onion.\n\nBut she needs to face down.\n\nTurn 46: change orientation D to face down\n\nTurn 47: interact I with pot (3,0) to add onion. Now pot has one onion, Alice holding nothing.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob placed an onion on (3,2) at some turn.\n\nAt turn 45, Bob placed onion on (3,2).\n\nSo now on (3,2) there is an onion.\n\nAlice at (3,1) after adding to pot at turn 47, holding nothing.\n\nShe can pick up the onion from (3,2) above her.\n\nFrom (3,1), facing down after interact, but (3,2) is above, so she needs to face up.\n\nTurn 48: change orientation U to face up\n\nTurn 49: interact I with (3,2) to pick up onion\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen she can add to pot again.\n\nTurn 50: change orientation D to face down\n\nTurn 51: interact I with pot to add second onion.\n\nPot now has two onions.\n\nWe need one more onion.\n\nBob can get another onion, e.g. from (6,4) or (7,1) or dispenser.\n\nFor example, after placing onion, Bob is at (3,3) holding nothing, he can go to (6,4) or something.\n\nBut let's focus on Alice.\n\nAfter adding second onion, Alice can get the third onion.\n\nThere is onion at (7,1) or (6,4) etc.\n\n(7,1) has onion, but far.\n\n(6,4) has onion, at (6,4).\n\nAlice at (3,1), she can go to (6,4) but far.\n\nBob can bring it.\n\nSince we need to start cooking as soon as possible, with three onions.\n\nCurrently at turn 51, pot has two onions, need one more.\n\nIf Alice goes to (7,1), for example.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,1): move right four times to (7,1)? But (7,1) not walkable, so to (6,1), then interact.\n\n(6,1) is empty.\n\nFrom (3,1) move R to (4,1), then R to (5,1), then R to (6,1), each move.\n\nThen at (6,1), face right to interact with (7,1) to pick up onion.\n\nThen back to (3,1) to add to pot.\n\nBut that's many turns.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (3,1): move left three times.\n\nThen at (3,1) face down and interact.\n\nSo many turns.\n\nBob can do it faster.\n\nBut for Alice, since she is at the pot, she can stay and let Bob bring the last onion.\n\nOr, there is onion at (5,4) or (6,4), but Bob might be getting it.\n\nAnother onion at (6,4), which is kitchen counter with onion.\n\nAlice can go there, but far.\n\nPerhaps use the second pot at (4,0), but let's fill one first.\n\nSince cooking takes 5 turns, we should start as soon as possible.\n\nAt turn 42, if Bob adds an onion to the pot quickly.\n\nBob at (5,3) facing up, can interact to pick up from (5,4) on turn 42.\n\nThen he has onion.\n\nTo add to pot, he can go to (4,1) and face down to pot (4,0).\n\nPot at (4,0) is empty.\n\nFrom (5,3), how to reach (4,1).\n\nAs before, difficult because of counters at y=2.\n\nHe can go to (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), then (5,1), then (4,1).\n\nFrom (5,3) move R to (6,3) on turn 43.\n\nThen move D to (6,2) on turn 44.\n\nThen move D to (6,1) on turn 45.\n\nThen move L to (5,1) on turn 46.\n\nThen move L to (4,1) on turn 47.\n\nThen at (4,1) face down to pot (4,0) on turn 48.\n\nThen interact to add onion on turn 49.\n\nBut at this point, Alice has already added one onion to (3,0) at turn 47, so different pot.\n\nWe can use both pots, but recipe is the same, and we need to deliver.\n\nBut let's stick to one pot for now.\n\nTo save time, Alice can add the first onion to (3,0) at turn 47 as before.\n\nThen for the second onion, instead of Bob placing on counter, he can add directly if possible.\n\nBut he is slow.\n\nAt turn 42, after Bob picks up onion from (5,4), he can move towards (3,1) or the area.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (4,3) on turn 43.\n\nThen to (3,3) on turn 44.\n\nThen at (3,3), he can face down to interact with (3,2) or directly.\n\n(3,2) is counter, he can place onion there as before.\n\nThen Alice can pick it up and add.\n\nBut from turn 44, Alice is at (3,1) with onion, she adds on turn 47.\n\nBob places onion on (3,2) on turn 45, say.\n\nThen Alice picks it up on turn 48-49 and adds on turn 50-51.\n\nThen for third onion, similar.\n\nBut there is another onion at (6,4) or (7,1).\n\nBob can get it after placing.\n\nAfter turn 45, Bob at (3,3) holding nothing, he can go to (6,4) to get onion.\n\n(6,4) has onion.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (6,4): move right to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (6,3), then at (6,3), face up to interact with (6,4) if possible.\n\n(6,4) is above (6,3), so if at (6,3) facing up, can interact.\n\n(6,3) is empty.\n\nFrom (3,3) move R to (4,3) on turn 46.\n\nThen move R to (5,3) on turn 47.\n\nThen move R to (6,3) on turn 48.\n\nThen change orientation U to face up on turn 49, then interact I to pick up onion from (6,4) on turn 50.\n\nThen he has onion, he can go to (3,1) to add to pot.\n\nFrom (6,3) to (3,1): move left to (5,3), to (4,3), to (3,3), then down not possible, so to (3,2) not possible, so to (2,3)? (2,3) empty, then to (2,2) not, to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nLong way.\n\nFrom (6,3) move D to (6,2) on turn 51, then D to (6,1) on turn 52, then L to (5,1) on turn 53, L to (4,1) on turn 54, L to (3,1) on turn 55, but (3,1) may have Alice, players cannot occupy same tile.\n\nBut Alice might not be there.\n\nAt turn 55, Alice might be elsewhere.\n\nThis is taking too many turns.\n\nBetter to have Alice get the third onion from somewhere closer or use the onion at (7,1).\n\n(7,1) has onion.\n\nAlice at (3,1) after adding second onion at turn 51, holding nothing.\n\nShe can go to (7,1) to get onion.\n\nFrom (3,1) move R to (4,1) turn 52, R to (5,1) turn 53, R to (6,1) turn 54, then at (6,1) face right (if not facing) to interact with (7,1) turn 55, pick up onion.\n\nThen move back L to (5,1) turn 56, L to (4,1) turn 57, L to (3,1) turn 58, then face down turn 59, interact to add third onion turn 60.\n\nThen pot starts cooking at turn 60.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so ready at turn 65.\n\nThen someone needs to get a plate and serve the soup, then deliver.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (0,2): far, or Bob can do it.\n\nBut let's see the total turns.\n\nThis seems inefficient.\n\nAnother idea: since there are onions on counters, and Alice is at (3,1), she can have Bob get onions and bring them to a counter near her, so she can add them quickly.\n\nFor example, the counter at (3,2) above her.\n\nBob can get onions and place on (3,2), then Alice picks up and adds to pot below.\n\nSimilarly for the third onion.\n\nBob can get onion from (7,1) or (5,4) etc.\n\nFor example, at turn 42, Bob picks up from (5,4) as before.\n\nThen he places on (3,2) at turn 45 as before.\n\nAlice picks up from (3,2) at turn 49 and adds to pot at turn 51 for the second onion.\n\nThen for third onion, Bob can get from (6,4).\n\nAt turn 45, Bob at (3,3) after placing, holding nothing.\n\nHe can go to (6,4).\n\nFrom (3,3) move R to (4,3) turn 46, R to (5,3) turn 47, R to (6,3) turn 48.\n\nThen face U turn 49, interact with (6,4) turn 50, pick up onion.\n\nThen he has onion, he can go back to (3,3) to place on (3,2).\n\nFrom (6,3) move L to (5,3) turn 51, L to (4,3) turn 52, L to (3,3) turn 53.\n\nThen at (3,3) face D turn 54, interact with (3,2) to place onion turn 55.\n\nThen Alice at (3,1) can pick it up: face U turn 56, interact turn 57 to pick up, then face D turn 58, interact turn 59 to add to pot.\n\nPot has third onion at turn 59.\n\nStart cooking at turn 59.\n\nReady at turn 64.\n\nThen for serving.\n\nBut we need to get a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice or Bob can get it.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), she can go to (0,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (0,2): move left to (2,1), then to (1,1)? (1,1) empty, then to (0,1) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nTo interact with plate dispenser at (0,2), she needs to be adjacent, e.g. at (0,1), (0,3), (1,2), or (-1,2) invalid.\n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(0,3) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(1,2) is empty? Not listed, so empty.\n\nSo she can be at (1,2) and face left to interact with (0,2).\n\n(0,2) is plate dispenser.\n\nFrom (3,1), move L to (2,1) turn 60, then U to (2,2) but (2,2) was kitchen counter, but now empty, and it's not walkable? Kitchen counters are not walkable, so she cannot move to (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move U to (2,2)? No, not empty.\n\nSo she can move to (1,1) first.\n\n(1,1) empty.\n\nFrom (3,1) move L to (2,1) turn 60, then from (2,1) move L to (1,1) turn 61, then from (1,1) move U to (1,2) turn 62, now at (1,2) facing up.\n\nThen change orientation L to face left turn 63, then interact I with (0,2) to grab plate turn 64.\n\nNow holding plate.\n\nThen she needs to go back to pot to serve the soup.\n\nSoup ready at turn 64? If cooked from turn 59, ready at turn 64? Cooking time 5 turns, so if added third onion at turn 59, cooking starts at turn 59, so ready at turn 64.\n\nAt turn 64, Alice is at (0,2) grabbing plate.\n\nThen she needs to go to pot at (3,0).\n\nFrom (1,2) move D to (1,1) turn 65, then R to (2,1) turn 66, then R to (3,1) turn 67.\n\nThen at (3,1) face D turn 68, interact with pot to serve soup (if holding plate and soup cooked), so turn 69.\n\nThen she has soup on plate, now deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,2): move R to (4,1) turn 70, R to (5,1) turn 71, then U to (5,2) not possible, (5,2) counter.\n\nSo move to (6,1) first.\n\nFrom (5,1) move R to (6,1) turn 72, then U to (6,2) turn 73, now at (6,2) facing up.\n\nServing counter at (7,2), adjacent tile (6,2) is empty, so at (6,2) face R to interact with (7,2) turn 74, deliver soup turn 75.\n\nReward at turn 75.\n\nBut this is many turns, and we might do better.\n\nBob can help with getting plate or something.\n\nSince cooking takes time, we can get the plate while cooking.\n\nFor example, after the pot is cooking, Alice or Bob can get the plate.\n\nIn the above, pot starts cooking at turn 59.\n\nFrom turn 59, Alice can go get plate.\n\nAt turn 59, Alice is at (3,1) after adding third onion.\n\nShe can immediately go to get plate.\n\nTurn 60: move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 61: move L to (1,1)\n\nTurn 62: move U to (1,2) facing up\n\nTurn 63: change orientation L to face left\n\nTurn 64: interact I with (0,2) to grab plate\n\nNow holding plate at turn 64.\n\nSoup ready at turn 64, so she can go back to serve.\n\nTurn 65: move D to (1,1) facing down\n\nTurn 66: move R to (2,1) facing right? Move R from (1,1) to (2,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 67: move R to (3,1) facing right\n\nTurn 68: change orientation D to face down\n\nTurn 69: interact I with pot to serve soup, now holding soup on plate.\n\nThen deliver to (7,2).\n\nTurn 70: move R to (4,1) facing right\n\nTurn 71: move R to (5,1) facing right\n\nTurn 72: move R to (6,1) facing right\n\nTurn 73: change orientation U to face up (since (6,2) is above, but she needs to be at (6,2) or adjacent to (7,2))\n\nServing counter at (7,2), adjacent tiles: (6,2), (7,1), (7,3), (8,2) invalid.\n\n(7,1) is kitchen counter with onion, not empty, so players cannot be there.\n\n(7,3) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(6,2) is empty, as not listed.\n\nSo only (6,2) can be used to interact with (7,2).\n\nFrom (6,1), move U to (6,2) turn 73, facing up.\n\nThen at (6,2), face right to interact with (7,2) turn 74, then interact turn 75 to deliver.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at turn 64, soup is ready, but Alice is far, so she serves at turn 69, which is after ready, but it's ok, as long as served.\n\nBut we can have Bob serve if he is closer, but Bob might be elsewhere.\n\nTo save time, after the pot is cooking, Alice can go get the plate, and Bob can be near the pot to serve when ready.\n\nBut in this case, Bob might not be there.\n\nLet's assume Bob is cooperative.\n\nPerhaps start with a different plan.\n\nAnother idea: since there are onions on counters, Alice can add them to the pot directly if she has them, but she needs to get them first.\n\nAlice at (3,1) can quickly get the onion from (7,1) with Bob's help.\n\nBut let's think of a shorter sequence.\n\nNotice that at (7,1) there is an onion, and serving counter is at (7,2), so if we make soup near there, but pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), not near.\n\nOnly pots at bottom.\n\nSo we have to use those pots.\n\nPerhaps use the pot at (4,0) as well, but same issue.\n\nOr, have Bob start filling the other pot.\n\nBut let's focus on one soup for now.\n\nTo minimize time to first delivery.\n\nSince the recipe reward is 20, and we can make multiple, but with H turns, we need to see how many we can make.\n\nThe planning horizon H is not specified; it says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\", but not given, so we need to plan for enough turns to complete at least one soup delivery.\n\nProbably H=20 or something, but not specified.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list actions for Alice for a sequence.\n\nPerhaps plan until the soup is delivered.\n\nBut it might be long.\n\nWith coordination, we can do better.\n\nLet's have Alice handle the pot at (3,0) and Bob handle getting onions or plates.\n\nAt turn 42:\n\nAlice: since she is at (3,1) facing right, she can immediately face down to interact with pot, but pot is empty, and she has no item, so interact with pot does nothing or invalid.\n\nShe needs to have an ingredient to add.\n\nSo she must get an onion first.\n\nSo my initial plan is reasonable.\n\nPerhaps she can get onion from (3,2) but (3,2) has no item, empty.\n\nOr from dispenser, but far.\n\nSo let's stick with getting from (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) has onion, so she can get it as planned.\n\nThen add to pot.\n\nThen for the second onion, since Bob can place on (3,2), she picks up.\n\nThen for third, Bob brings another.\n\nBut in the timeline, pot starts cooking at turn 59.\n\nThen Alice gets plate, etc.\n\nBut we can have Bob get the plate while cooking.\n\nAfter Bob places the second onion or something.\n\nLet's outline Alice's actions only.\n\nFor Alice:\n\nTurn 42: L (move left to (2,1))\n\nTurn 43: U (change orientation to up)\n\nTurn 44: I (interact with (2,2) to pick up onion)\n\nTurn 45: R (move right to (3,1))\n\nTurn 46: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 47: I (interact with pot (3,0) to add onion, now pot has 1 onion, Alice holding nothing)\n\nNow, assume that Bob places an onion on (3,2) at some point.\n\nAt turn 47, Alice at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can interact with (3,2) above to pick up if there is onion.\n\nBut at this turn, Bob may not have placed it yet.\n\nAssume that by turn 48, there is onion on (3,2).\n\nFor example, Bob placed it at turn 45 or earlier.\n\nIn my earlier timeline, at turn 45, Bob places on (3,2).\n\nSo at turn 48, Alice can face up to pick up.\n\nTurn 48: U (change orientation to up)\n\nTurn 49: I (interact with (3,2) to pick up onion)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nTurn 50: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 51: I (interact with pot to add second onion, pot has 2 onions)\n\nThen for third onion, she can go to (7,1) or other.\n\nBut let's say she goes to (7,1).\n\nTurn 52: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nTurn 53: R ( to (5,1))\n\nTurn 54: R ( to (6,1))\n\nTurn 55: R (change orientation to right? At (6,1) facing right after move, so to interact with (7,1), she is facing right, so she can interact.\n\nAfter move to (6,1) facing right, and (7,1) is to the right, so she can interact immediately if facing correct.\n\nTurn 54: move R to (6,1), facing right.\n\nThen turn 55: I (interact with (7,1) to pick up onion)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nTurn 56: L (move left to (5,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 57: L ( to (4,1))\n\nTurn 58: L ( to (3,1))\n\nTurn 59: D (change orientation to down, if not facing down)\n\nTurn 60: I (interact with pot to add third onion, now pot has 3 onions, cooking starts)\n\nCooking starts at turn 60.\n\nNow Alice holding nothing.\n\nShe can go get plate.\n\nTurn 61: L (move left to (2,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 62: L ( to (1,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 63: U (move up to (1,2), facing up)  -- move U from (1,1) to (1,2)\n\nTurn 64: L (change orientation to left to face (0,2))\n\nTurn 65: I (interact with plate dispenser (0,2) to grab plate)\n\nNow holding plate.\n\nSoup ready at turn 65 (since cooking started turn 60, 5 turns: turn 60,61,62,63,64 ready at turn 65).\n\nAt turn 65, soup is ready.\n\nAlice is at (1,2) with plate, she needs to go to pot to serve.\n\nTurn 66: D (move down to (1,1), facing down)\n\nTurn 67: R (move right to (2,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 68: R ( to (3,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 69: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 70: I (interact with pot to serve soup, now holding soup on plate)\n\nThen deliver to (7,2).\n\nTurn 71: R (move right to (4,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 72: R ( to (5,1))\n\nTurn 73: R ( to (6,1))\n\nTurn 74: U (move up to (6,2), facing up)\n\nTurn 75: R (change orientation to right to face (7,2))\n\nTurn 76: I (interact to deliver soup)\n\nReward at turn 76.\n\nBut this is for Alice only, and we assumed Bob helped with one onion.\n\nTo make it work, we need to specify Alice's actions.\n\nFor the answer, we can list Alice's actions for, say, 20 turns or until key point.\n\nBut the task is to maximize reward, so perhaps deliver as soon as possible.\n\nWith Bob helping, it can be faster.\n\nFor example, if Bob adds the first onion.\n\nAt turn 42, Bob can add onion to pot if he has it, but he doesn't.\n\nHe can get from (5,4) and add.\n\nBut as before, it takes time.\n\nAt turn 42, Bob interact I with (5,4) pick up onion.\n\nThen he needs to go to (4,1) to add to pot (4,0).\n\nFrom (5,3) move L to (4,3) turn 43.\n\nThen to (4,2) not possible, so to (3,3) turn 44, etc., slow.\n\nAlice can add to (3,0) faster.\n\nSo my initial plan is ok.\n\nPerhaps use the onion on (7,1) for the third onion, but Alice is getting it.\n\nOr, Bob can get the plate while Alice adds onions.\n\nBut let's accept the plan and list Alice's actions for the first few turns to start.\n\nSince H is not specified, I'll list actions until she adds the first onion or something.\n\nBut the task is to maximize reward, so we need a complete plan for delivery.\n\nPerhaps for Alice, we can plan her actions for the next H turns, say H=10, but not specified.\n\nIn the context, perhaps list actions until the soup is cooking or delivered.\n\nI think for the answer, we can list a sequence of actions for Alice based on the state.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can go to the onion dispenser to get onions directly, but dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), from (3,1) to (3,4), but (3,2) in between not walkable, so she needs to go around, e.g. to (2,1), to (2,2) not, to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (3,4) not, so to (4,4) or something.\n\nFrom (3,1) move U to (3,2) not possible, so move L to (2,1), then U to (2,2) not possible, so move to (2,3) first.\n\nFrom (2,1) move U not possible, so move to (1,1), then to (1,2), then to (1,3), then to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (3,4) not, so to (4,3), then to (4,4) not, so to (4,3) face up to interact with (4,4) if at (4,3).\n\n(4,3) to (4,4) north, so face up.\n\nBut long way, not better than using counter onions.\n\nSo I think using the counter onion at (2,2) is best for Alice.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll list Alice's actions for the next few turns to add the first onion and position for second.\n\nBut to be complete, let's assume Bob will handle the other onions and plate, and Alice adds to pot.\n\nBut for the sequence, I'll list for Alice.\n\nPerhaps the planning is for immediate actions.\n\nI think I should provide a sequence for Alice to contribute to the collaboration.\n\nSo for turn 42 to turn 47 as above.\n\nThen beyond, depending on state.\n\nBut for the answer, list a sequence.\n\nLet's say for H=10 turns, from t1=42 to 51.\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: I\n\nTurn 45: R\n\nTurn 46: D\n\nTurn 47: I\n\nThen at turn 47, she added onion, holding nothing.\n\nThen she can wait or get another onion.\n\nTurn 48: S (stay) or move to prepare.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll stop at turn 47.\n\nOr continue.\n\nSince there is onion on (3,2) if Bob placed, but we can't assume.\n\nIn the state, (3,2) is empty, so no item.\n\nSo Alice needs to get another onion.\n\nSo from turn 48, she can go to (7,1) or other.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll list the actions to add the first onion.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: I\n\nTurn 45: R\n\nTurn 46: D\n\nTurn 47: I\n\nThen for turn 48 onwards, it depends.\n\nBut the task is to plan a sequence, so perhaps list for 10 turns or so.\n\nI think for the purpose, this is fine.\n\nTo maximize, Alice can after adding, go to the plate dispenser to get plate for future use, but she can hold only one item, and plate is for after cooking.\n\nSo not efficient.\n\nShe can stay near the pot.\n\nI think I'll go with this.\n\nSo Alice's actions:\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: I\n\nTurn 45: R\n\nTurn 46: D\n\nTurn 47: I\n\nThen for the sequence, list these.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's write it.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should collaborate efficiently to fill a pot with 3 onions, cook the soup, and deliver it to the serving counter. Given the current game state at turn 42, Alice is well-positioned to start adding onions to the pot at (3,0) while Bob can gather additional onions and handle plate retrieval. The optimal plan focuses on Alice adding the first onion to the pot quickly, then coordinating with Bob (who is assumed to act cooperatively) to supply more onions via the kitchen counter at (3,2) for efficient access. Alice will then prepare to serve the soup by fetching a plate once cooking starts.\n\n### Key Coordination Points:\n- **Pot at (3,0)**: Alice is adjacent at (3,1) and can interact after facing down.\n- **Onion Sources**: Use onions from kitchen counters (e.g., (2,2) for Alice's first onion) to save time over dispensers. Bob can grab onions from (5,4) or (6,4) and place them on (3,2) for Alice.\n- **Cooking and Serving**: Cooking takes 5 turns after the third onion is added. Alice should fetch a plate from (0,2) during cooking to serve immediately when ready.\n- **Bob's Role (Assumed)**: \n  - Turn 42: Bob interacts with (5,4) to pick up an onion (since he is facing up at (5,3)).\n  - Bob moves to (3,3) and places the onion on (3,2) by turn 45.\n  - Bob fetches another onion (e.g., from (6,4)) and places it on (3,2) by turn 55 for the third onion.\n  - Bob can also help with serving or fetching if needed, but Alice's actions are optimized around this support.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (turns 42 to 69):\nAlice's actions are planned to:\n1. Pick up the onion from (2,2) efficiently.\n2. Add it to the pot at (3,0).\n3. Pick up onions from (3,2) (placed by Bob) for the second and third additions.\n4. Fetch a plate during cooking and serve the soup.\n\nThe sequence is designed for minimal movement and orientation changes, leveraging Alice's current position and facing. After adding the third onion at turn 60, cooking starts. Alice then fetches the plate (turns 61-65), serves the soup (turns 68-69), and delivers it (not fully listed here, as H is limited).\n\n- **Turn 42**: Move left (L) to (2,1). *Reason: Position to access onion at (2,2).*\n- **Turn 43**: Change orientation up (U). *Reason: Face (2,2) to interact.*\n- **Turn 44**: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (2,2). *Reason: Acquire first onion for the pot.*\n- **Turn 45**: Move right (R) to (3,1). *Reason: Return to position adjacent to pot.*\n- **Turn 46**: Change orientation down (D). *Reason: Face pot at (3,0) for interaction.*\n- **Turn 47**: Interact (I) to add onion to pot. *Reason: Pot now has 1 onion; Alice holds nothing.*\n- **Turn 48**: Change orientation up (U). *Reason: Face kitchen counter at (3,2) to pick up onion (placed by Bob by now).*\n- **Turn 49**: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (3,2). *Reason: Acquire second onion for the pot.*\n- **Turn 50**: Change orientation down (D). *Reason: Face pot at (3,0) for interaction.*\n- **Turn 51**: Interact (I) to add onion to pot. *Reason: Pot now has 2 onions; Alice holds nothing.*\n- **Turn 52**: Change orientation up (U). *Reason: Face (3,2) for third onion (Bob places it around turn 55; Alice waits or reorients).*\n- **Turn 53**: Stay (S) or adjust. *Reason: Wait for Bob to place onion on (3,2); no efficient action this turn.*\n- **Turn 54**: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (3,2). *Reason: Acquire third onion (assumed placed by Bob).*\n- **Turn 55**: Change orientation down (D). *Reason: Face pot at (3,0).*\n- **Turn 56**: Interact (I) to add onion to pot. *Reason: Pot now has 3 onions; cooking starts.*\n- **Turn 57**: Move left (L) to (2,1). *Reason: Begin moving toward plate dispenser at (0,2).*\n- **Turn 58**: Move left (L) to (1,1). *Reason: Continue movement to (0,2).*\n- **Turn 59**: Move up (U) to (1,2). *Reason: Position adjacent to plate dispenser.*\n- **Turn 60**: Change orientation left (L). *Reason: Face plate dispenser at (0,2).*\n- **Turn 61**: Interact (I) to grab plate. *Reason: Acquire plate for serving; soup is cooking (ready at turn 65).*\n- **Turn 62**: Move down (D) to (1,1). *Reason: Start returning to pot.*\n- **Turn 63**: Move right (R) to (2,1). *Reason: Continue to pot area.*\n- **Turn 64**: Move right (R) to (3,1). *Reason: Position adjacent to pot.*\n- **Turn 65**: Change orientation down (D). *Reason: Face pot at (3,0).*\n- **Turn 66**: Interact (I) to serve soup. *Reason: Pick up cooked soup (ready at turn 65).*\n- **Turn 67**: Move right (R) to (4,1). *Reason: Start moving toward serving counter at (7,2).*\n- **Turn 68**: Move right (R) to (5,1). *Reason: Continue movement.*\n- **Turn 69**: Move right (R) to (6,1). *Reason: Position to access serving counter.*\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- **Cooking Start**: Turn 56 (third onion added).\n- **Soup Ready**: Turn 61 (5-turn cooking).\n- **Serving**: Alice serves at turn 66 and can deliver to (7,2) by turn 74 for a reward of 20. With Bob's help, this sequence ensures the first soup is delivered efficiently, and the pot can be reused for more recipes.\n\nThis plan optimizes Alice's actions for coordination and speed, leveraging Bob for onion supply. For brevity, actions are listed up to turn 69, but Alice can continue to deliver the soup (e.g., move to (6,2) and interact with (7,2)).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 45: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 47: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 49: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 50: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 51: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 52: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 53: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 54: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 55: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 57: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 62: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 63: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 64: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 65: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 66: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 67: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 68: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 69: \\text{ R}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes. The only recipe given is Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward: 20; time to cook: 5 turns. Since there are no tomato dispensers, we can only make onion soup. The reward for delivering this soup is 20 points.\n\nThe game state at turn 46:\n\n- Alice is at (3,1), facing left (L), holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (3,3), facing up (U), holding one onion.\n\nThere are onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), a plate dispenser at (0,2), pots at (3,0) and (4,0), and a serving counter at (7,2).\n\nKitchen counters have onions on them at (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), and (5,4). All pots are empty.\n\nAction history: For Alice, recent actions: R, U, I, R, L. For Bob: I, L, L, U, I. But I'm not sure how relevant that is for planning future actions.\n\nI need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice for the next H turns. H isn't specified, so I should choose a reasonable horizon. Since cooking takes 5 turns, and we need to gather ingredients, cook, and serve, H should be at least 10-15 turns to complete a full cycle.\n\nThe goal is to deliver as many soups as possible. Since we have multiple onions on counters, and dispensers, we can use those to fill pots.\n\nFirst, let's assess the current items:\n\n- Bob is holding an onion. He could put it in a pot or on a counter, but since pots are empty, putting it in a pot might be best.\n\n- There are onions on counters: (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4). Alice or Bob can pick these up to use in pots.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0). Serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nPlayers can only carry one item at a time, so coordination is key.\n\nPossible high-level plan:\n\n1. Fill the pots with onions to start cooking soups.\n\n2. While soups are cooking, get plates to serve them.\n\n3. Deliver the soups to the serving counter.\n\nSince cooking takes 5 turns, once a pot has 3 onions, it starts cooking automatically, and after 5 turns, it's ready to serve. Then someone needs to bring a plate to serve the soup and take it to the serving counter.\n\nThere's a plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlso, we can use the onions on counters to save time instead of going to dispensers each time.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- Alice at (3,1). From (3,1), she can move to adjacent tiles. Since she's facing left, the tile to her left is (2,1). What is (2,1)? The grid isn't fully described, but from the tile types, (2,1) isn't listed, so it might be an empty tile. Similarly, (3,1) is not listed in any special tile, so it's probably empty.\n\nTile types:\n\n- Kitchen counters at various positions, but (3,1) isn't listed, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) where Bob is, not listed, so empty.\n\nNow, Alice at (3,1), facing left. She can interact with the tile to her left, which is (2,1). But (2,1) isn't specified, so it might be empty or something else. The only tiles mentioned are the special ones; others are empty by default.\n\nIn the tile types, it lists specific coordinates for counters, dispensers, etc. Anything not listed should be empty tiles.\n\nSo (2,1) should be empty. Therefore, Alice cannot interact with (2,1) because it's empty; interact only works with non-empty tiles.\n\nTo interact, she needs to be adjacent and facing the tile.\n\nFor example, to interact with a pot, she needs to be next to it and facing it.\n\nSimilarly for counters.\n\nAlice at (3,1). What is around her?\n\n- Left: (2,1) - empty tile, I assume.\n\n- Right: (4,1) - not listed, so empty.\n\n- Up: (3,2) - listed as a kitchen counter? Kitchen counters include (3,2)? Let's check.\n\nKitchen counters: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)]\n\nSo (3,2) is a kitchen counter. And it has something? Non-empty kitchen counters: (2,2) has onion, (6,4) onion, (7,1) onion, (5,4) onion. (3,2) is listed as a kitchen counter, but not mentioned as non-empty, so it should be empty, meaning no item on it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is a kitchen counter but not mentioned, so empty.\n\nBack to Alice at (3,1), facing left. Up from her is (3,2), which is a kitchen counter, but since she's at (3,1), to interact with (3,2), she needs to be facing up and adjacent.\n\nCurrently, she is at (3,1), facing left, so not facing up. To interact with (3,2), she needs to move up or change orientation.\n\nFirst, let's think about what to do.\n\nBob is at (3,3), holding an onion, facing up.\n\nAbove him at (3,4) is an onion dispenser, but he already has an onion, so he might not need to interact with it now.\n\nHe could put the onion in a pot.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0), which are below Alice and Bob.\n\nAlice at (3,1), so down is (3,0), which is a pot? (3,0) is listed as a kitchen counter? No, pots are at (3,0) and (4,0)? Let's see tile types.\n\nPot: [(3,0), (4,0)]\n\nAnd kitchen counters include (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), so (3,0) and (4,0) are pots, not kitchen counters.\n\nSo (3,0) is a pot.\n\nAlice at (3,1), which is directly above (3,0). Since she is at (3,1), the tile below her is (3,0), a pot.\n\nBut to interact with it, she needs to be facing down towards it.\n\nCurrently, she is facing left, so not facing down.\n\nShe could change orientation to face down, then interact.\n\nBut she is holding nothing, so if she interacts with the pot, what happens? If the pot is empty, and she has no item, I think she can't add anything; she might be able to serve if there was soup, but there isn't.\n\nInteract with pot:\n\n- If player holding ingredient, can add to pot if not full.\n\n- If player holding clean plate, can serve soup if cooked.\n\nBut Alice has nothing, so she can't add or serve. So interacting with pot now might do nothing.\n\nSimilarly, Bob has an onion, so he could add it to a pot.\n\nBob at (3,3), facing up. Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), which are down from him.\n\nHe needs to move down to access them.\n\nSimilarly, there are onions on counters that can be picked up.\n\nLet's list available onions:\n\n- On counter at (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4)\n\nAlso, Bob is holding one onion.\n\nTo make a soup, we need 3 onions in a pot.\n\nSince there are two pots, we can cook two soups simultaneously.\n\nBut we need to gather ingredients.\n\nFirst, Bob can add his onion to a pot.\n\nHe is at (3,3), facing up. To go to a pot, he needs to go down.\n\n(3,2) is a kitchen counter below him, but since it's empty, he can walk on it? Kitchen counters are walkable, I think, since they are counters where items can be placed, but players can walk on them? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But tiles can be empty or have objects, but the tile itself is walkable if it's an empty tile or a counter, I think.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- Empty Tile: Walkable space.\n\n- Dispensers, Pots, etc. are non-empty tiles, but players can be adjacent to interact, but cannot walk on them? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nWhat defines a non-empty tile? I think it means tiles that have objects like dispensers, pots, counters, etc., as opposed to empty tiles which have nothing.\n\nIn the tile types, it lists specific tiles for each type, so any coordinate not listed might be empty tile, but listed coordinates are non-empty.\n\nFor example, (3,2) is a kitchen counter, so it is a non-empty tile, meaning players cannot walk on it. Players can only be on empty tiles or interact from adjacent empty tiles.\n\nThe rules: \"Players can carry one item at a time. Players cannot walk onto/through each other. Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nSo, non-empty tiles cannot be walked on; players must be on empty tiles and interact with adjacent non-empty tiles.\n\nFor example, to interact with a pot at (3,0), a player must be on an adjacent empty tile, like (3,1) or (2,0) or (4,0), but (2,0) is a kitchen counter, which is non-empty, so not walkable, so only (3,1), (4,0)? (4,0) is a pot, non-empty, not walkable.\n\nLet's list the adjacent tiles to pot at (3,0):\n\n- Left: (2,0) - kitchen counter, non-empty, not walkable\n\n- Right: (4,0) - pot, non-empty, not walkable\n\n- Up: (3,1) - empty tile, since not listed, so walkable\n\n- Down: (3,-1)? Out of bound, I assume grid is 0 to 7 in x and 0 to 4 in y? From the coordinates, y from 0 to 4.\n\n(3,0) is at bottom, so no down.\n\nSo only tile above (3,1) can be used to interact with pot at (3,0).\n\nSimilarly for other tiles.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), which is directly above pot at (3,0). To interact, she needs to face down towards (3,0).\n\nCurrently she is facing left.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (3,3), above him is (3,4) which is onion dispenser, but he has an onion, so no need.\n\n(3,3) down is (3,2), which is a kitchen counter. Since (3,2) is non-empty, Bob cannot walk on it; he can interact with it if adjacent and facing.\n\nBut he is at (3,3), so (3,2) is below him, so to interact, he needs to face down.\n\nBut (3,2) has no item, since not listed in non-empty counters, so empty counter, so he can place or pick up, but nothing to pick up.\n\nHe could move to access the pot.\n\nFirst, let's get the pots filled.\n\nBob is holding an onion, so he can add it to a pot.\n\nThe nearest pot is (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nFrom Bob's position (3,3), he can go down to (3,2)? (3,2) is a kitchen counter, not walkable, so he cannot move to (3,2).\n\nHe must go around.\n\nWhat tiles are around (3,3)?\n\n- Left: (2,3) - not listed, so empty tile? Kitchen counters include (2,4) and (2,2), but (2,3) not listed, so empty.\n\n- Right: (4,3) - not listed, empty.\n\n- Up: (3,4) - onion dispenser, non-empty, not walkable.\n\n- Down: (3,2) - kitchen counter, non-empty, not walkable.\n\nSo Bob can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), he can go down to (2,2)? (2,2) is a kitchen counter with onion, non-empty, not walkable, so he can interact with it from (2,3) or (2,1), etc.\n\nSimilarly, to reach the pots, he needs to go down.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), he can go right to (4,3), then down to (4,2)? (4,2) is a kitchen counter, not walkable, so he can't move to (4,2).\n\nHe can go to (4,3), then from there, (4,2) is down, but not walkable, so he can interact with (4,2) if facing down, but (4,2) is a counter, not a pot.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nTo access (3,0), from (3,1) which is empty.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0), from (4,1) or (3,0) but (3,0) not walkable.\n\n(4,1) not listed, so should be empty.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), which is good for pot (3,0).\n\nBob at (3,3), he can move to (4,3) or (2,3), then to (4,4) or (2,4), but (4,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable.\n\n(4,4) is dispenser, so not walkable.\n\nHe can go to (4,3), then to (5,3)? (5,3) not listed, empty? Kitchen counters at (5,2), (5,4), but (5,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nThen from (5,3), he can go down to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nThis is messy; I need a map.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nAssume x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4.\n\nList all non-empty tiles:\n\n- Kitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\nOther tiles are empty and walkable.\n\nFor example, (0,2) is plate dispenser, which is non-empty, so not walkable.\n\nPlayers can be on empty tiles like (1,1), (1,2), etc., as long as not listed.\n\nAlice at (3,1): empty tile.\n\nBob at (3,3): empty tile.\n\nTo access pot at (3,0), only from (3,1) or (2,0) or (4,0), but (2,0) and (4,0) are non-empty, so only from (3,1) above.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0), only from (4,1) above, or (3,0) or (5,0), but non-empty, so only (4,1).\n\n(4,1) not listed, so empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, to access kitchen counter at (2,2), can be from (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2) but (3,2) non-empty, so from (2,1), (2,3), or (1,2), (3,2) is adjacent but not walkable, so players must be on empty tiles adjacent.\n\nFor (2,2), adjacent empty tiles: (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2) is counter, so not, (1,2) not listed, so empty? Yes.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nAlice at (3,1), facing left. She can interact with pot at (3,0) if she faces down, but she has nothing, so no point. She can pick up an onion from a counter or go to a dispenser.\n\nThere is an onion on (7,1) counter, which is close to her? (7,1) is at x=7,y=1.\n\nAlice at (3,1), so she is at same y, but x different.\n\nShe can move right to (4,1), then to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut there are onions on counters at (2,2), (7,1), etc.\n\n(7,1) is a kitchen counter with onion, and it's at (7,1).\n\nAlice at (3,1), so she can move right along y=1.\n\nTiles at y=1: (0,1) is kitchen counter, non-empty; (1,1) not listed, empty; (2,1) not listed, empty; (3,1) empty; (4,1) empty; (5,1) not listed, empty; (6,1) not listed, empty; (7,1) kitchen counter with onion.\n\nSo Alice can move right to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then to (7,1)? (7,1) is non-empty, so she can't walk on it; she must be adjacent to interact.\n\nFrom (6,1), she can interact with (7,1) if facing right.\n\n(6,1) is empty, (7,1) is east of it.\n\nSimilarly, she can interact with pot at (3,0) from (3,1) by facing down.\n\nBut again, she has nothing.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, she can pick one up.\n\nFor example, the onion at (7,1) is close.\n\nShe is at (3,1), facing left. To go to (7,1), she can move right multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3), holding an onion. He can add it to a pot.\n\nThe pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), which are below.\n\nFrom (3,3), to reach (3,1), he needs to go down, but (3,2) is a counter, blocking the way.\n\nHe can go left to (2,3), then down to (2,2)? (2,2) is counter, not walkable, so from (2,3) he can interact with (2,2) if facing down, but (2,2) has an onion, so he could pick it up, but he is already holding an onion, so he can't pick up another item since he can carry only one.\n\nHe can place his onion on a counter or in a pot.\n\nTo place on a counter, for example at (2,2), but (2,2) has an onion already, so it's occupied, he can't place there. Counters can hold one item, so if occupied, can't place.\n\nSimilarly, empty counters can be used.\n\nBut he wants to put it in a pot.\n\nSo he needs to go to (3,1) or (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can go right to (4,3), then down to (4,2)? (4,2) is counter, not walkable, so he can go to (4,3), then to (5,3) (empty), then to (5,2)? (5,2) counter, not walkable, or to (5,4) but (5,4) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can go down? No, (4,2) is south, not walkable.\n\nHe can go to (3,4) but not walkable.\n\nPerhaps he needs to go to (4,4) but not walkable.\n\nThe way down is blocked at y=2 for x=3 and 4 because of counters.\n\nHe can go to (2,3) or (4,3), then to (2,4) or (4,4), but dispensers.\n\nOr to (1,3) or (5,3), etc.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), move left to (2,3).\n\nAt (2,3), he is above (2,2) counter, which has an onion. He can interact with it if facing down, but since he has an onion, he can't pick up, and the counter is occupied, so he can't place.\n\nThen he can move down? (2,2) not walkable, so he can move to (1,3) or (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is kitchen counter with onion? (2,4) is listed as kitchen counter, but not in non-empty, so it might be empty.\n\nNon-empty kitchen counters: (2,2) has onion, (6,4) has onion, (7,1) has onion, (5,4) has onion. (2,4) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) not listed as non-empty, so empty.\n\nSo at (2,3), he can move up to (2,4)? (2,4) is kitchen counter, non-empty tile, so not walkable. Players cannot walk on non-empty tiles.\n\n(2,4) is a kitchen counter, so non-empty, not walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is empty, so he can be there.\n\nFrom (2,3), he can move left to (1,3) or right to (3,3), or down? South is (2,2), not walkable, so only left or right or up? Up is (2,4), not walkable.\n\nSo only horizontal move at y=3 for some x.\n\nTo reach the lower area, he needs to go to a row where he can go down.\n\nFor example, at x=1, y=3, (1,3) not listed, empty.\n\nThen down to (1,2)? (1,2) not listed, empty? Kitchen counters at (0,1), (0,3), but (1,2) not listed, so empty.\n\nThen from (1,2), he can go down to (1,1)? (1,1) not listed, empty; (1,0) is kitchen counter, non-empty.\n\nSo from (1,1), he can interact with (1,0) or (0,1) etc.\n\nBut to reach pot, for example at (3,0), he can go to (3,1) from the east or west.\n\nFrom (2,3), he can move left to (1,3), then down to (1,2), then down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then right to (3,1).\n\n(2,1) not listed, empty; (3,1) empty.\n\nFrom (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, he can go directly from (3,3) to (4,3), then to (5,3), then down to (5,2)? (5,2) not walkable, so to (5,3), then to (6,3)? (6,3) not listed, empty, then down to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed, but (6,0) kitchen counter, (6,4) kitchen counter, (6,2) not listed, so empty? Then to (6,1), then to (5,1), etc to (4,1) or (3,1).\n\nBut this is long.\n\nSince Alice is already at (3,1), she can stay there for the pot.\n\nBob can add his onion to a pot by coming to (3,1) or (4,1).\n\nBut it's far for Bob.\n\nHe can place his onion on an empty counter for later use.\n\nFor example, there is an empty counter at (3,2) or (4,2), etc.\n\n(3,2) is kitchen counter, no item, so empty.\n\nBob at (3,3), facing up. (3,2) is below him, so he can face down and interact to place the onion on (3,2) if it's empty.\n\nSince (3,2) has no item, he can place it.\n\nThen he is free to move.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can pick it up or something.\n\nBut let's coordinate.\n\nFirst, to start cooking, we need to fill a pot with 3 onions.\n\nBob has one, and there are onions on counters, so we can use those.\n\nFor example, the onion at (2,2) is close to (3,1).\n\nAlice at (3,1), she can move left to (2,1)? (2,1) not listed, empty, so she can move left to (2,1).\n\nAt (2,1), she is adjacent to (2,2) kitchen counter with onion, and she can face right or up? (2,2) is east and up? Positions: (2,1) at y=1, (2,2) at y=2, so (2,2) is north of (2,1), so to interact, she needs to face north.\n\nSimilarly, she is adjacent to (1,1) west, (3,1) east, (2,0) south? (2,0) is kitchen counter, non-empty.\n\nFrom (2,1), she can face north to interact with (2,2).\n\nSince (2,2) has an onion, she can pick it up if she is empty-handed, which she is.\n\nSo she can do that.\n\nThen she will be holding an onion.\n\nSimilarly, she can then add it to the pot at (3,0) from (3,1).\n\nBob can add his onion directly or place it.\n\nBut Bob is at (3,3), he can place his onion on (3,2) which is empty.\n\nLet's plan step by step.\n\nTurn 46: Alice is at (3,1), facing left, holding nothing.\n\nBob at (3,3), facing up, holding onion.\n\nFirst, for Alice: she can move left to (2,1) to be adjacent to (2,2) counter with onion.\n\nAction for Alice: Move left (L). Since she is at (3,1), moving left to (2,1).\n\nAfter move, she is at (2,1), facing? Move action changes position and orientation to the direction moved. Rules: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\"\n\nSo if she moves left, she goes to (2,1) and faces left.\n\nThen from there, to interact with (2,2), which is north, she needs to face up. So she can change orientation to up, or move up, but (2,2) not walkable, so she must change orientation or move to a tile where she is facing it.\n\nAt (2,1), (2,2) is north, so to interact, she needs to be facing up.\n\nShe can change orientation to up (U), then interact (I).\n\nSimilarly, for Bob, he can place his onion on (3,2) counter.\n\nHe is at (3,3), facing up. (3,2) is south of him? (3,3) at y=3, (3,2) at y=2, so (3,2) is south.\n\nHe needs to face down to interact.\n\nSo he can change orientation to down (D), then interact (I) to place the onion on (3,2), assuming it's empty.\n\nThen he is free.\n\nLet's write the actions.\n\nBut I need to plan for Alice only, the task is to plan for Alice, and optionally for Bob, but since Bob is controlled by teammate, I think I should plan for Alice, and assume Bob will cooperate or I can suggest.\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I can plan for both to coordinate.\n\nTo maximize, it's better to coordinate.\n\nAlso, the action sequence is for Alice, but I can include Bob's actions for clarity.\n\nIn the answer format, it's for Alice, so I think I should output only Alice's actions, but to plan, I need to consider Bob.\n\nPerhaps I can plan Alice's actions based on what Bob might do.\n\nBut it's ambiguous.\n\nLet's read: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice\" and \"optionally for Bob\", but in the answer format, it only shows Alice's actions.\n\nBut to be clear, I'll plan for Alice, and assume Bob is rational.\n\nSince Bob has an onion, he will likely try to put it in a pot or use it.\n\nSimilarly, from action history, Bob's recent actions: I, L, L, U, I. Last action I, which might be interact, and he was at (3,3), facing U, so he might have interacted with (3,4) dispenser, but he already has onion, so perhaps he didn't take, or something. But he is holding onion, so last action I might be something else.\n\nNot important.\n\nLet's start with turn 46.\n\nI need to specify actions from turn 46 onwards.\n\nTurn t1=46, so actions for t=46,47,48,etc.\n\nFirst action is for turn 46.\n\nAlice at (3,1), facing L.\n\nI think Alice should go to pick up the onion at (2,2).\n\nSo for turn 46: Alice moves left to (2,1). Action L.\n\nAfter this, she is at (2,1), facing left.\n\nThen for turn 47: she needs to face up to interact with (2,2). So change orientation to up, action U.\n\nThen turn 48: interact with (2,2) to pick up onion. Action I.\n\nNow she is holding an onion.\n\nThen she can go to the pot at (3,0).\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move right to (3,1). Action R for turn 49.\n\nAt (3,1), she is facing right (since moved right).\n\nPot at (3,0) is south, so she needs to face down to interact.\n\nTurn 50: change orientation to down, action D.\n\nTurn 51: interact with pot to add onion. Action I.\n\nNow one onion in pot at (3,0).\n\nBut we need three.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can add his onion.\n\nBob at (3,3), facing U, holding onion.\n\nHe can place it on (3,2) for Alice to pick up or add directly.\n\nTo add directly, he needs to go to (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nSay he moves left to (2,3) on turn 46.\n\nThen from (2,3), he can move down? No, can't to (2,2).\n\nMove to (1,3) or something, but it's long.\n\nSince Alice is at (3,1) after some turns, he can come later.\n\nBob can place the onion on (3,2) now.\n\nTurn 46 for Bob: change orientation to down (D) to face (3,2).\n\nTurn 47: interact (I) to place onion on (3,2).\n\nThen (3,2) now has onion.\n\nBob is free.\n\nThen Alice, after adding her onion to pot, can pick up this onion from (3,2).\n\nAlice after turn 51 at (3,1), holding nothing (after adding onion).\n\n(3,2) is north of (3,1), so she can face up to interact.\n\nTurn 52: change orientation to up, U.\n\nTurn 53: interact with (3,2) to pick up onion, I.\n\nThen she has another onion, can add to pot again.\n\nBut pot at (3,0) has one onion, she can add another.\n\nAfter picking up, she is at (3,1), holding onion, pot south.\n\nTurn 54: face down, D.\n\nTurn 55: interact with pot, I. Now two onions in pot.\n\nNeed one more.\n\nThere is another onion at (7,1), or Bob can get one.\n\nBob is now at (3,3), holding nothing, after placing onion.\n\nHe can go to a dispenser or pick up another onion.\n\nFor example, onion at (5,4) or (6,4), etc.\n\nOr he can go to plate dispenser.\n\nBut first, let's fill the pot.\n\nAlice has added two onions, need one more.\n\nShe can go to (7,1) to get the onion there.\n\nFrom (3,1), move right to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then interact with (7,1).\n\n(7,1) is east of (6,1).\n\nAlice at (3,1) after turn 55.\n\nTurn 56: move right to (4,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 57: move right to (5,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 58: move right to (6,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 59: interact with (7,1) to pick up onion. Since (7,1) is east, and she is at (6,1) facing right, so she is facing it, so I.\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen she needs to go back to (3,1) to add to pot.\n\nTurn 60: move left to (5,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 61: move left to (4,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 62: move left to (3,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 63: face down, D.\n\nTurn 64: interact with pot, I. Now three onions in pot at (3,0). Cooking starts automatically at turn 64.\n\nCooking time is 5 turns, so ready at turn 69.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can do other things.\n\nBut this is taking many turns for one soup.\n\nThere are onions on counters that are closer or Bob can help.\n\nFor example, there is onion at (5,4), but y=4, far.\n\nOr at (6,4), etc.\n\nSince Bob is free, he can get an onion and add to the pot.\n\nAfter Bob placed onion on (3,2), he is at (3,3), facing down or something.\n\nAfter placing, he is at (3,3), orientation down.\n\nHe can move to get another onion.\n\nFor example, he can go to onion dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4).\n\n(3,4) is north of (3,3), but he is facing down, so turn for Bob: change orientation to up, U, then interact with dispenser to get onion.\n\nThen he can add to pot.\n\nBut to add to pot, he needs to go to (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move left to (2,3), then down to (2,2)? Not, so to (2,3), then to (1,3), down to (1,2), down to (1,1), right to (2,1), right to (3,1).\n\nMany moves.\n\nOr he can place it on a counter near the pot.\n\nBut let's see if Alice can use the onion on (7,1) faster.\n\nFrom above, Alice takes from turn 56 to 64 to get the onion from (7,1) and add, 9 turns, plus before that.\n\nFrom turn 46 to 55 she added two onions, 10 turns for two, then 9 for one, total 19 turns to start cooking at turn 64.\n\nBut we have another pot at (4,0).\n\nAlso, there are onions on counters that Bob can bring.\n\nFor example, the onion at (2,2) was used, but there are others.\n\nList available onions: on counters at (2,2) - used by Alice, (6,4), (7,1), (5,4).\n\n(7,1) is at (7,1), (5,4) at (5,4), (6,4) at (6,4).\n\nBob can pick up one of these.\n\nFor example, onion at (6,4), Bob at (3,3), he can go to (6,4).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (6,4): first move right to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (6,3), then interact with (6,4)? (6,4) is north of (6,3), so from (6,3) face up to interact.\n\n(6,3) not listed, empty.\n\nSo turn for Bob: from (3,3), move right to (4,3), facing right.\n\nMove right to (5,3), facing right.\n\nMove right to (6,3), facing right.\n\nThen change orientation to up, U.\n\nInteract with (6,4) to pick up onion.\n\nThen he can add to pot or place.\n\nBut to add to pot, he needs to go to (4,1) for pot (4,0).\n\nPot (4,0) can be accessed from (4,1).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut it's far.\n\nSince Alice is working on pot (3,0), Bob can work on pot (4,0).\n\nFor example, Bob can add his onion to pot (4,0).\n\nBut he needs to reach (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), move right to (4,3), then he can go down? (4,2) south, not walkable, so he can go to (5,3), then to (5,2)? Not, so to (5,3), then to (6,3), then to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed, empty, then to (6,1), then to (5,1), to (4,1).\n\nLong.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down? No.\n\nAnother way: at (4,3), he can interact with (4,2) if facing down, but (4,2) is counter, empty, so he can place the onion there for later.\n\nThen later Alice or he can pick up.\n\nBut let's focus on Alice's actions.\n\nI think for efficiency, Alice should not go to (7,1) because it's far; instead, use onions closer or have Bob help.\n\nThere is onion at (7,1), but also at (5,4), etc.\n\nAlice can add the onion from (3,2) that Bob placed.\n\nIn the earlier plan, after Alice adds two onions to pot, she can pick up the onion from (3,2) that Bob placed.\n\nIn turn 53, she picks up from (3,2), then adds to pot at turn 55.\n\nThen for the third onion, instead of going to (7,1), she can use another nearby onion.\n\nBut the only other nearby is (2,2) but she already took that.\n\n(3,2) she used.\n\nOr there is onion at (7,1), or Bob can bring one.\n\nBut Bob can bring the onion from (5,4) or something.\n\nSince cooking takes 5 turns, once a pot has 3 onions, it starts cooking, so we can start cooking with one pot and prepare the other.\n\nLet's start with one soup.\n\nMinimal turns to start cooking one soup.\n\nBob has one onion, he can add it to pot directly if he can reach (3,1) or (4,1).\n\nBut he can't directly, so he places it on (3,2).\n\nAlice picks it up and adds to pot.\n\nBut Alice needs to add three, so she needs two more.\n\nShe can take from (2,2) first.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 46: Alice move L to (2,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 47: Alice change orientation U to face up for (2,2).\n\nTurn 48: Alice interact I to pick up onion from (2,2), now holding onion.\n\nTurn 49: Alice move R to (3,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 50: Alice change orientation D to face down for pot (3,0).\n\nTurn 51: Alice interact I to add onion to pot. Pot now has one onion.\n\nAlice holding nothing.\n\nTurn 52: Alice change orientation U to face up for (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) may have onion if Bob placed it.\n\nAssume Bob cooperates.\n\nFor Bob at turn 46: since he is facing U, but to place on (3,2), he needs to face down.\n\nTurn 46 Bob: change orientation D to face down.\n\nTurn 47 Bob: interact I to place onion on (3,2), assuming it was empty.\n\nNow (3,2) has onion.\n\nBob holding nothing.\n\nTurn 48 Bob: he can go to get another onion or something.\n\nBack to Alice.\n\nAfter turn 51, Alice at (3,1), facing down, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 52: Alice change orientation U to face up.\n\nTurn 53: Alice interact I with (3,2) to pick up onion, now holding onion.\n\nTurn 54: Alice change orientation D to face down.\n\nTurn 55: Alice interact I with pot to add onion. Pot now has two onions.\n\nNeed one more.\n\nAlice holding nothing.\n\nNow, she can go to (7,1) for the onion there.\n\nTurn 56: Alice move R to (4,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 57: Alice move R to (5,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 58: Alice move R to (6,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 59: Alice interact I with (7,1) to pick up onion, now holding.\n\nTurn 60: Alice move L to (5,1)? From (6,1) move left to (5,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 61: Alice move L to (4,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 62: Alice move L to (3,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 63: Alice change orientation D to face down.\n\nTurn 64: Alice interact I with pot to add onion. Now three onions, cooking starts.\n\nCooking will finish at turn 64 + 5 = turn 69.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can prepare for serving or start another soup.\n\nFor serving, we need a plate. Plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice or Bob can get a plate.\n\nBut Alice is busy now.\n\nBob is free after turn 47.\n\nBob at (3,3), holding nothing.\n\nHe can go to plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (0,2): move left to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (0,3)? (0,3) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nFrom (1,3), move down to (1,2), then to (0,2)? (0,2) is plate dispenser, not walkable, so interact from adjacent.\n\n(0,2) is at (0,2), adjacent empty tiles: (0,1), (0,3) not walkable, (1,2) west.\n\n(1,2) is empty tile.\n\nSo from (1,2), face east to interact with (0,2).\n\nBob at (3,3), move left to (2,3), facing left.\n\nMove left to (1,3), facing left.\n\nMove down to (1,2), facing down? Move down to (1,2), which is south, so facing down.\n\nAt (1,2), (0,2) is west, so he needs to face west to interact.\n\nSo change orientation to left (L), then interact.\n\nSequence for Bob:\n\nTurn 48 Bob: move L to (2,3), facing left (since moved left).\n\nTurn 49 Bob: move L to (1,3), facing left.\n\nTurn 50 Bob: move D to (1,2), facing down.\n\nAt (1,2), facing down, but (0,2) is west, so need to face west.\n\nTurn 51 Bob: change orientation L to face left.\n\nTurn 52 Bob: interact I with plate dispenser to get plate.\n\nNow holding clean plate.\n\nHe can then go to the pot to serve when ready, but cooking finishes at turn 69, so he has time.\n\nHe can go to (3,1) or near the pot.\n\nBut pot at (3,0), served from (3,1).\n\nHe can wait or do something else.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice is done at turn 64, she can help with other things.\n\nBut let's see the soup cooking.\n\nAfter adding the third onion at turn 64, cooking starts, ready at turn 69.\n\nAt turn 69, Bob can serve the soup if he has a plate and is at (3,1).\n\nBob has a plate, at turn 52 he has it.\n\nHe is at (1,2) after turn 52.\n\nHe needs to go to (3,1).\n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,1): move right to (2,2)? Not walkable, so move down to (1,1)? (1,1) empty, then right to (2,1), then right to (3,1).\n\nTurn 53 Bob: move D to (1,1), facing down.\n\nTurn 54 Bob: move R to (2,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 55 Bob: move R to (3,1), facing right.\n\nThen he is at (3,1), facing right.\n\nPot at (3,0) south, so he needs to face down.\n\nBut cooking finishes at turn 69, so he can wait or change orientation later.\n\nHe can stay there until turn 69.\n\nThen at turn 69, face down and interact to serve.\n\nBut he needs to be there at the right time.\n\nSimilarly, after serving, he needs to deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nBut first, let's complete the soup delivery.\n\nFor Alice, after turn 64, she is at (3,1), holding nothing, facing down.\n\nShe can start on another soup.\n\nFor example, fill the other pot at (4,0).\n\nThere are onions on counters, like at (5,4) or (6,4).\n\nOr she can go to dispenser.\n\nBut let's focus on the first soup for now.\n\nI think for Alice's actions, from turn 46 to 64 as above.\n\nBut H is not specified, so I can output a sequence until she adds the third onion.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we should plan for serving and more soups.\n\nSince the sequence is for Alice, and Bob can be assumed to cooperate.\n\nIn the answer, only Alice's actions.\n\nSo for Alice, from turn 46:\n\nTurn 46: L (move left to (2,1))\n\nTurn 47: U (change orientation up to face (2,2))\n\nTurn 48: I (interact with (2,2) to pick up onion)\n\nTurn 49: R (move right to (3,1))\n\nTurn 50: D (change orientation down to face pot (3,0))\n\nTurn 51: I (interact to add onion to pot)\n\nTurn 52: U (change orientation up to face (3,2))\n\nTurn 53: I (interact to pick up onion from (3,2), assuming Bob placed it)\n\nTurn 54: D (change orientation down to face pot)\n\nTurn 55: I (interact to add second onion to pot)\n\nTurn 56: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nTurn 57: R (move right to (5,1))\n\nTurn 58: R (move right to (6,1))\n\nTurn 59: I (interact with (7,1) to pick up onion)\n\nTurn 60: L (move left to (5,1)? From (6,1) move left to (5,1), facing left)\n\nAfter turn 59, she is at (6,1), facing right? When she moved to (6,1) on turn 58, she moved R, so facing right. Then on turn 59, she interacted, no move, so still at (6,1), facing right.\n\nThen turn 60: move left to (5,1), which is moving left, so position to (5,1), orientation left.\n\nTurn 61: L (move left to (4,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 62: L (move left to (3,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 63: D (change orientation down to face pot)\n\nTurn 64: I (interact to add third onion)\n\nNow cooking starts.\n\nAfter this, Alice can go to get a plate or something.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can stop here or continue.\n\nSince the soup will be served by Bob, Alice can work on the other pot.\n\nFor example, she can go to onion dispenser or pick up another onion.\n\nThere is onion at (5,4) or (6,4).\n\nShe is at (3,1) after turn 64, facing down.\n\nTurn 65: U (change orientation up to face north, but (3,2) may be empty now)\n\n(3,2) had onion, but she picked it up, so empty.\n\nShe can go to (4,4) dispenser or something.\n\nMove right to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut let's assume she goes to get an onion for the other pot.\n\nFor example, to (6,4) onion.\n\nFrom (3,1), move right to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then up? (6,1) to (6,2)? (6,2) is empty? Then to (6,3), then interact with (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is onion dispenser.\n\nBut she needs to be empty-handed to grab.\n\nShe is holding nothing.\n\nTurn 65: Alice move R to (4,1), facing right\n\nTurn 66: move R to (5,1), facing right\n\nTurn 67: move R to (6,1), facing right\n\nTurn 68: move U to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed, empty, so move U to (6,2), facing up\n\nTurn 69: move U to (6,3)? (6,3) empty, facing up\n\nTurn 70: change orientation U to face up? At (6,3), facing up, (6,4) north, so she can interact.\n\nTurn 70: interact I with (6,4) to get onion.\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen she can go to pot at (4,0).\n\nPot at (4,0) accessed from (4,1).\n\nFrom (6,3), move down to (6,2), facing down\n\nMove down to (6,1), facing down\n\nMove left to (5,1), facing left\n\nMove left to (4,1), facing left\n\nThen face down to interact with pot (4,0).\n\nBut this is many turns.\n\nShe can add to the pot directly if she goes to (4,1).\n\nBut let's not extend too far.\n\nPerhaps a better way.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, like at (5,4), but (5,4) is kitchen counter with onion, so she can pick it up if adjacent.\n\n(5,4) at (5,4), adjacent tiles, e.g. (5,3), (4,4), etc.\n\nFrom (3,1), shorter to go to (5,4)? Not really.\n\nOr she can use the onion on (5,4) counter.\n\nBut (5,4) is at (5,4), so from (3,1) to (5,4): move to (5,1), then to (5,2)? (5,2) not walkable, so to (5,1), then to (5,0)? (5,0) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo to (5,3) first.\n\nFrom (3,1) move right to (4,1), (5,1), then up to (5,2)? Not, so to (6,1), then to (6,2), then to (6,3), then to (5,3)? (5,3) empty, then interact with (5,4) if facing up.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nI think for now, I'll output Alice's actions until she adds the third onion, and assume Bob handles the serving.\n\nTo deliver the soup, after cooking, Bob serves at turn 69, then takes it to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) with soup on plate, move to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then interact with (7,2)? (7,2) is serving counter.\n\n(7,2) is at (7,2), (6,1) is at (6,1), not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent to (7,2): (7,1), (7,3), (6,2), (8,2) out of bound.\n\n(7,1) is kitchen counter with onion, non-empty.\n\n(7,3) kitchen counter, non-empty.\n\n(6,2) empty tile? Not listed, so empty.\n\nSo from (6,2), face east to interact with (7,2).\n\nBob at (3,1) with soup, move to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then to (6,2), then interact.\n\nBut let's not detail.\n\nFor Alice, after turn 64, she can be part of another soup.\n\nBut since the task is to plan for Alice, I'll provide a sequence for H=20 turns or so.\n\nBut H not specified, so perhaps until she contributes to a soup.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll provide the sequence for Alice from turn 46 to turn 64 as above.\n\nThen the soup is cooking, and reward will be obtained later.\n\nBut to maximize, with two pots, we can cook two soups.\n\nAlice can start filling the other pot.\n\nBut in the sequence above, from turn 46 to 64, 19 actions, but turns from 46 to 64 inclusive is 19 turns? Turn 46 to turn 64 is 19 actions (46,47,...,64).\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\nAction for turn t: a_t\n\nTurn 46: L\n\n47: U\n\n48: I\n\n49: R\n\n50: D\n\n51: I\n\n52: U\n\n53: I\n\n54: D\n\n55: I\n\n56: R\n\n57: R\n\n58: R\n\n59: I\n\n60: L\n\n61: L\n\n62: L\n\n63: D\n\n64: I\n\nAt turn 64, she adds the third onion.\n\nCooking starts.\n\nThen for turn 65 onwards, she can go to get a plate or for another onion.\n\nBut I think this is fine for now.\n\nTo reduce turns, she could have used a closer onion, but (7,1) is the only other listed, and (5,4) is far too.\n\nOr Bob could have brought the third onion.\n\nBut for Alice's actions, this works.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice:\n\nTurn 46: L\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: I\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nTurn 50: D\n\nTurn 51: I\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: I\n\nTurn 54: D\n\nTurn 55: I\n\nTurn 56: R\n\nTurn 57: R\n\nTurn 58: R\n\nTurn 59: I\n\nTurn 60: L\n\nTurn 61: L\n\nTurn 62: L\n\nTurn 63: D\n\nTurn 64: I\n\nIn turn 53, she interacts with (3,2) to pick up onion, which assumes Bob placed it there by turn 47 or so.\n\nIf Bob doesn't place it, she can't pick up, but we assume cooperation.\n\nTo be safe, she can go directly to another source.\n\nBut I think it's reasonable.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should coordinate to fill a pot with three onions as quickly as possible to start cooking Recipe 1 (3 onions, 5-turn cook time, 20 reward). Given the current game state at turn 46, Alice is at (3,1) holding nothing, and Bob is at (3,3) holding an onion. The plan focuses on Alice using available onions on kitchen counters (e.g., at (2,2) and (7,1)) and leveraging Bob's onion (placed on (3,2) for Alice to use) to efficiently fill the pot at (3,0). Bob is assumed to cooperate by placing his onion on (3,2) early and later assisting with serving.\n\n### Key Coordination Points:\n- **Bob's Role:** At turn 46, Bob should change orientation down (D) and interact (I) to place his onion on the empty kitchen counter at (3,2) by turn 47. This allows Alice to pick it up efficiently. Bob can then fetch a plate from (0,2) to serve the soup once cooked.\n- **Cooking and Serving:** After Alice adds the third onion to the pot at (3,0) at turn 64, cooking starts and finishes at turn 69. Bob (with a plate) can serve the soup at turn 69 and deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2) for the 20-point reward.\n- **Efficiency:** Alice's sequence minimizes movement by using nearby onions (e.g., (2,2) and (7,1)) and avoids unnecessary trips to dispensers. The second pot at (4,0) can be started after this sequence for additional rewards.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (Turns 46 to 64):\n- **Turn 46 (L)**: Move left to (2,1) to access onion at (2,2). Position: (2,1), Orientation: Left.\n- **Turn 47 (U)**: Change orientation up to face (2,2) for interaction.\n- **Turn 48 (I)**: Interact to pick up onion from (2,2). Now holding onion.\n- **Turn 49 (R)**: Move right to (3,1) to access pot at (3,0). Position: (3,1), Orientation: Right.\n- **Turn 50 (D)**: Change orientation down to face pot (3,0).\n- **Turn 51 (I)**: Interact to add onion to pot (3,0). Pot now has 1 onion. Holding nothing.\n- **Turn 52 (U)**: Change orientation up to face (3,2) (where Bob places onion).\n- **Turn 53 (I)**: Interact to pick up onion from (3,2) (Bob's onion). Now holding onion.\n- **Turn 54 (D)**: Change orientation down to face pot (3,0).\n- **Turn 55 (I)**: Interact to add onion to pot (3,0). Pot now has 2 onions. Holding nothing.\n- **Turn 56 (R)**: Move right to (4,1) toward onion at (7,1). Position: (4,1), Orientation: Right.\n- **Turn 57 (R)**: Move right to (5,1). Position: (5,1), Orientation: Right.\n- **Turn 58 (R)**: Move right to (6,1) to access (7,1). Position: (6,1), Orientation: Right.\n- **Turn 59 (I)**: Interact with (7,1) to pick up onion. Now holding onion.\n- **Turn 60 (L)**: Move left to (5,1) toward pot. Position: (5,1), Orientation: Left.\n- **Turn 61 (L)**: Move left to (4,1). Position: (4,1), Orientation: Left.\n- **Turn 62 (L)**: Move left to (3,1). Position: (3,1), Orientation: Left.\n- **Turn 63 (D)**: Change orientation down to face pot (3,0).\n- **Turn 64 (I)**: Interact to add onion to pot (3,0). Pot now has 3 onions; cooking starts (finishes turn 69).\n\n### Outcome and Next Steps:\n- **Cooking:** Soup in pot (3,0) starts cooking at turn 64 and will be ready at turn 69.\n- **Serving (Bob's Task):** Bob should be at (3,1) by turn 69 with a clean plate (obtained earlier). He can serve the soup and deliver it to (7,2) for 20 points.\n- **Further Optimization:** After turn 64, Alice can start filling the second pot at (4,0) using onions from counters (e.g., (5,4) or (6,4)) or dispensers to cook another soup. Bob can handle serving while Alice prepares the next recipe.\n\nThis sequence ensures one soup is started by turn 64 with minimal turns, leveraging teamwork for high efficiency. The total reward is maximized by preparing multiple soups sequentially.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 46: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 47: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 48: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 49: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 50: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 51: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 52: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 53: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 54: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 55: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 56: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 57: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 58: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 59: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 60: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 61: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 62: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 63: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 64: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

There are no tomato dispensers, so we can only make onion soup.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 50.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), facing left, holding nothing. Her action history: L, U, I, R, L. But since we're planning from turn 50, the history might give context, but I need to focus on future actions.\n\nBob is at (3,3), facing down, holding one onion. His action history: I, D, R, L, D.\n\nThere are kitchen counters with onions: (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4). Also, pots at (3,0) and (4,0) are empty.\n\nServing counter is at (7,2).\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nSince we need to make onion soup, which requires 3 onions in a pot, and it cooks in 5 turns. Then someone needs to get a plate, serve the soup, and deliver it to (7,2).\n\nAlice is holding nothing, at (3,1). Bob is holding one onion, at (3,3).\n\nThe grid isn't fully described, but from the tile types, I can infer walkable areas. Empty tiles are walkable, but I need to know the layout.\n\nListed tiles:\n\n- Kitchen Counter: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\n- Onion Dispenser: (3,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pot: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\nI assume all other tiles are empty and walkable, unless specified.\n\nPlayers cannot walk onto non-empty tiles, so counters, dispensers, pots are not walkable, but players can interact with them when adjacent and facing them.\n\nAlice at (3,1): let's see adjacent tiles.\n\n(3,1) is a kitchen counter? No, kitchen counters are listed, (0,1) and (7,1) are kitchen counters, but (3,1) is not listed, so it should be empty. Similarly, (3,3) is not listed, so empty.\n\nPositions:\n\n- Alice: (3,1), empty tile, I assume.\n\n- Bob: (3,3), empty tile.\n\nNow, Alice facing left, so she is oriented towards (2,1), I think. Coordinates: x from left to right, y from bottom to top? Usually in grids, y increases up, but here U is y+1, so y increases up.\n\nSo at (3,1), left is (2,1), right (4,1), up (3,2), down (3,0).\n\n(3,0) is a pot, since pots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\n(3,2) is a kitchen counter? Kitchen counters include (3,2), yes, from list: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) are kitchen counters.\n\nSo (3,2) is a kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): not listed, so empty.\n\n(4,1): not listed, empty.\n\n(3,0): pot, not walkable.\n\nAlice at (3,1), facing left, so towards (2,1). (2,1) is empty? Not listed, so should be walkable and empty tile.\n\nBut to interact, she needs to be adjacent and facing the tile.\n\nCurrently, she can interact with tiles she is facing if adjacent.\n\nShe is at (3,1), facing left, so she can interact with (2,1) if it's interactable, but (2,1) is not listed as any special tile, so it's an empty tile, no interaction possible. Interact is for non-empty tiles like dispensers, pots, counters.\n\nSo at (3,1), adjacent tiles: (2,1) empty, (4,1) empty, (3,2) kitchen counter above, (3,0) pot below.\n\nSince she is facing left, towards (2,1), which is empty, so no interaction possible now.\n\nShe can move or change orientation.\n\nBob at (3,3), facing down, holding onion.\n\n(3,3) adjacent: (2,3), (4,3), (3,4), (3,2).\n\n(3,4) is onion dispenser, (3,2) is kitchen counter, (2,3) and (4,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nFacing down, towards (3,2), which is kitchen counter.\n\nKitchen counter at (3,2) has something? The non-empty kitchen counters are listed: (2,2) has onion, (6,4) has onion, (7,1) has onion, (5,4) has onion. (3,2) is not mentioned as having an item, so it might be empty or not specified. The state says \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" and lists only those with items, so others are probably empty.\n\nSimilarly, pots are all empty.\n\nGoal: to deliver onion soup as fast as possible to get the 20 reward.\n\nWe need to fill a pot with 3 onions. Pots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nThere are onions on counters: (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4). And Bob has one onion.\n\nAlso, onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nSince we need 3 onions per soup, and we have onions available.\n\nFirst, Alice is at (3,1). She can move to interact with something.\n\nOne pot is directly below her at (3,0). She is at (3,1), pot at (3,0), so if she faces down, she can interact with the pot.\n\nCurrently she is facing left, so she needs to change orientation or move.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3), facing down towards (3,2), which is a kitchen counter. If it has an item, he could pick it up, but according to state, (3,2) is not listed as non-empty, so it might be empty. The non-empty ones are specified, so (3,2) is empty kitchen counter, I think. So no item to pick up.\n\nHe can place his onion there or move.\n\nTo maximize efficiency, we should use the existing onions on counters to save time, instead of getting from dispensers.\n\nOnions on counters: (2,2), (7,1), (5,4), (6,4).\n\n(2,2) is close to Alice? Alice at (3,1), (2,2) is left and up.\n\n(3,1) to (2,2): need to go left to (2,1) then up to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter, not walkable, so to interact, she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nAdjacent positions to (2,2): (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2).\n\n(2,1) is empty, (2,3) not listed, probably empty, (1,2) not listed, empty, (3,2) kitchen counter.\n\nSo Alice can be at (2,1) and face up to interact with (2,2), or at (1,2) face right, etc.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, pots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nNow, Alice is empty-handed, so she can pick up items.\n\nBob has an onion, so he can place it in a pot or on a counter.\n\nSince we need to fill a pot, let's get onions into one pot.\n\nFor example, pot at (3,0).\n\nAlice is at (3,1), directly above it.\n\nIf she faces down, she could interact to add an ingredient, but she has nothing, so she can't add anything. She needs to hold an onion first.\n\nSo she should get an onion.\n\nNearest onion? On counter at (2,2) or (7,1).\n\n(2,2) is closer: from (3,1) to (2,1) left, then face up to interact with (2,2) to pick up onion.\n\n(2,1) is adjacent to (2,2), and if she is at (2,1) facing up, she can interact with (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, (7,1) is farther.\n\nBob is at (3,3) with onion. He could go down to the pot at (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nBut (3,0) is below Alice, so if Bob goes to (3,0), he might be in the way.\n\n(3,0) is a pot, not walkable, so he needs to be adjacent to interact.\n\nFor pot at (3,0), adjacent positions: (3,1), (2,0), (4,0), (3,-1) but y=-1 not exist, so only (3,1), (2,0), (4,0).\n\n(2,0) is kitchen counter? Kitchen counters at (2,0), which is non-empty? Listed: (2,0) is kitchen counter, but not specified with item, so empty or not? Non-empty counters are listed, (2,0) not in non-empty list, so it should be empty kitchen counter.\n\nSimilarly, (4,0) is pot.\n\nSo for pot (3,0), adjacent: (3,1) empty, (2,0) kitchen counter, (4,0) pot.\n\n(4,0) is another pot, not walkable, so only (3,1) and (2,0) are possible interaction points.\n\n(2,0) is kitchen counter, so player can stand on (2,0)? No, players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles, but kitchen counters are non-empty tiles? Tile types: kitchen counters are non-empty, so not walkable. Players can only stand on empty tiles.\n\nSo for pot (3,0), the only adjacent empty tile is (3,1), since (2,0) and (4,0) are occupied.\n\n(2,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable, (4,0) is pot, not walkable, so (3,1) is the only tile adjacent to (3,0).\n\nSimilarly for (4,0), adjacent: (4,1), (3,0), (5,0). (3,0) pot, (5,0) kitchen counter, so only (4,1) is adjacent empty tile.\n\nBack to Alice at (3,1). She can interact with pot (3,0) below her by facing down, but she has nothing to add.\n\nFirst, she needs an onion.\n\nGo to (2,2) to pick up onion.\n\nFrom (3,1), move left to (2,1). Then, at (2,1), she needs to face up to interact with (2,2) which has an onion.\n\n(2,1) to (2,2) is up, so face up then interact.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can add his onion to a pot.\n\nHe is at (3,3) with onion. He can go to (3,2)? (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he can't stand there.\n\nHe can go down to (3,2)? No, (3,2) occupied.\n\nTo interact with pot, he needs to be at adjacent tile.\n\nFor example, to access pot (3,0), he needs to be at (3,1), but Alice is there now.\n\nIf Alice moves, he can go there.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,0), he can go to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is empty, I assume.\n\nBob at (3,3), can move down to (3,2)? No, (3,2) not walkable. So he can only move to empty tiles: (2,3), (4,3), (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSo possible moves: left to (2,3), right to (4,3), or down to (3,2) but not possible, or up to (3,4) not possible. So only left or right, or change orientation, or stay.\n\nHe is facing down, towards (3,2), which is kitchen counter. If it had an item, he could interact, but it's empty, so no.\n\nSo he should move to a position to interact with something.\n\nFor example, he can go to (3,1) to access the pot, but Alice is there.\n\nOr go to (4,1) for pot (4,0).\n\nOr he can place his onion on a kitchen counter for later use.\n\nBut since we need to fill a pot, better to add it directly if possible.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, Alice should pick up an onion from (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move left to (2,1). That's one action: move L.\n\nThen at (2,1), she needs to face up to interact with (2,2). Since she was facing left, she may need to change orientation to up.\n\nAfter moving left to (2,1), her position is (2,1), orientation? When moving, orientation changes to the direction moved, unless it's a change orientation action.\n\nPlayer actions: Move (L/R/U/D) changes position and orientation to that direction.\n\nChange orientation (L/R/U/D) changes only orientation, no move if adjacent tile not empty.\n\nInteract, stay.\n\nSo if Alice moves left to (2,1), she moves to (2,1) and now faces left (since she moved left).\n\nBut to interact with (2,2) which is up, she needs to face up.\n\nSo at (2,1), she needs to change orientation to up, then interact.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 50: Alice moves L to (2,1), now at (2,1) facing left.\n\nThen turn 51: she changes orientation to U (up), now facing up towards (2,2).\n\nThen turn 52: interact to pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nNow she is holding an onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can do something.\n\nBob at (3,3), holding onion, facing down.\n\nHe can go to (4,1) to access pot (4,0).\n\nFirst, from (3,3) to (4,1): need to move right to (4,3), then down to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter? Kitchen counters include (4,2), yes, not walkable.\n\nSo from (3,3), he can move right to (4,3). (4,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nThen at (4,3), he can move down? Down to (4,2) but (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he can't move down.\n\nHe can only move left to (3,3), right to (5,3)? (5,3) not listed, empty, or up to (4,4), but (4,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSo at (4,3), he can move to (5,3) or back to (3,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (4,1), he needs to go around.\n\nPerhaps via (5,3) or other tiles.\n\nList the grid.\n\nAssume the grid is 8x5? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4.\n\nTiles:\n\n- Row y=0: (0,0)KC, (1,0)KC, (2,0)KC, (3,0)Pot, (4,0)Pot, (5,0)KC, (6,0)KC, (7,0)KC\n\n- y=1: (0,1)KC, (1,1)? not listed, empty, (2,1)? empty, (3,1) empty (Alice here), (4,1)? empty, (5,1)? not listed, probably empty, (6,1)? empty, (7,1)KC with onion\n\n- y=2: (0,2)Plate dispenser, (1,2)? empty, (2,2)KC with onion, (3,2)KC empty, (4,2)KC, (5,2)KC, (6,2)? empty, (7,2)Serving counter\n\n- y=3: (0,3)KC, (1,3)? empty, (2,3)? empty, (3,3) empty (Bob here), (4,3)? empty, (5,3)? empty, (6,3)? empty, (7,3)KC\n\n- y=4: (0,4)KC, (1,4)KC, (2,4)KC, (3,4)Onion disp, (4,4)Onion disp, (5,4)KC with onion, (6,4)KC with onion, (7,4)KC\n\nBob at (3,3), to reach (4,1) for pot (4,0).\n\n(4,1) is at y=1, x=4.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1): one way is right to (4,3), then since can't go down to (4,2), need to go to (5,3) or (3,3), etc.\n\nPerhaps go to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(5,2) is KC, so not walkable.\n\nThen to (5,3), can move down? (5,2) not walkable, so no.\n\nOnly possibility is to go to (6,3) or something.\n\nFrom (3,3), move right to (4,3).\n\nThen from (4,3), he can move right to (5,3) (empty).\n\nThen from (5,3), he can move down? Down to (5,2) not possible, so move right to (6,3)? (6,3) not listed, probably empty.\n\nThen from (6,3), move down to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed, should be empty.\n\nThen from (6,2), move left to (5,2)? But (5,2) is KC, not walkable.\n\n(6,2) to (5,2) left, but (5,2) occupied, so can't move left to it.\n\nFrom (6,3), he can move down to (6,2) if empty.\n\nAssume (6,2) is empty.\n\nThen from (6,2), he can move left to (5,2)? No, not walkable.\n\nOr down to (6,1)? (6,1) not listed, empty.\n\nThen from (6,1), move left to (5,1)? (5,1) not listed, empty.\n\nThen to (4,1), or left to (4,1).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (5,1), then to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is empty.\n\nSo path: (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1)\n\nThat's many moves.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,3) left, then to (1,3)? Not efficient.\n\nBob could go to (3,2) but not walkable, so he can interact with (3,2) if he is at (3,3) facing down, but (3,2) is kitchen counter, and it's empty, so he could place his onion on it, but since it's empty, he can place item.\n\nKitchen counter: if player is holding item and counter is empty, can place item.\n\nSo Bob at (3,3), facing down towards (3,2), which is empty kitchen counter, so he can interact to place his onion on (3,2).\n\nThat might be quicker.\n\nThen Alice or someone can pick it up later.\n\nBut for now, to fill the pot.\n\nSince Alice is getting an onion, she can add to pot (3,0).\n\nBob can add his onion to pot (4,0) or something.\n\nBut pot (4,0) is far for Bob.\n\nLet's have Bob place his onion on a counter near a pot.\n\nFor example, on (3,2), which is above pot (3,0).\n\n(3,2) is kitchen counter, empty, so Bob can place onion there.\n\nThen Alice can pick it up or use it.\n\nBut Alice is at (2,1) after her actions.\n\nLet's sequence the actions.\n\nTurn 50: Alice moves L to (2,1), now at (2,1) facing left.\n\nBob: he can interact to place onion on (3,2). He is at (3,3), facing down, so he can interact directly with (3,2) since adjacent and facing it.\n\nSo turn 50 for Bob: interact (I) to place onion on (3,2). Now (3,2) has onion, and Bob is empty-handed.\n\nThen turn 51: Alice at (2,1), she changes orientation to U (up) to face (2,2).\n\nTurn 51 Bob: since he is empty, he can do something. But let's plan Alice first.\n\nTurn 52: Alice interacts to pick up onion from (2,2). Now she has onion.\n\nNow at (2,1) with onion, facing up.\n\nShe can go to pot (3,0) to add onion.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (3,1) right, then face down to interact with pot.\n\n(2,1) to (3,1) is right move.\n\nTurn 53: Alice moves R to (3,1), now at (3,1) facing right (since moved right).\n\nBut she needs to face down to interact with pot (3,0).\n\nSo turn 54: change orientation to D (down).\n\nTurn 55: interact to add onion to pot (3,0).\n\nNow pot (3,0) has one onion.\n\nBut we need three onions.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is at (3,3) empty-handed after placing onion on (3,2).\n\nHe can pick up another onion or something.\n\nOn (3,2) there is now an onion, placed by Bob.\n\nBob can pick it up, but he just placed it, not efficient.\n\nHe can go to other onions.\n\nFor example, onion at (7,1) or (5,4), etc.\n\nBut let's get onions to the pot.\n\nAlice added one onion to (3,0), so two more needed.\n\nThere is onion on (3,2), which is adjacent to (3,1).\n\nAlice is at (3,1) after adding onion, facing down.\n\nShe can pick up the onion from (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is above her, so she needs to face up.\n\nCurrently facing down, so change orientation to up.\n\nTurn 56: Alice change orientation to U (up) to face (3,2).\n\nThen turn 57: interact to pick up onion from (3,2). Now she has onion again.\n\nThen turn 58: she can add it to pot, but she is facing up, need to face down.\n\nSo turn 58: change orientation to D.\n\nTurn 59: interact to add second onion to pot (3,0).\n\nNow pot has two onions.\n\nNeed one more.\n\nThen Alice can get another onion.\n\nFor example, from (7,1) or others.\n\nBut Bob is available.\n\nBob at (3,3) empty-handed.\n\nHe can go to (3,2) to pick up, but it was just taken, empty now.\n\nOr go to other counter.\n\nFor instance, onion at (7,1).\n\nBut far.\n\nOnion at (5,4) or (6,4).\n\n(5,4) is at y=4, x=5.\n\nBob at (3,3), to (5,4): move right to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (5,4)? (5,4) is KC with onion, not walkable, so need to be adjacent.\n\nAdjacent to (5,4): (5,3), (5,5) not exist, (4,4), (6,4).\n\n(4,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable, (6,4) KC with onion.\n\n(5,3) is empty, so he can be at (5,3) and face down to interact with (5,4)? (5,4) is at same x, y=4, so if at (5,3) y=3, facing down to (5,4).\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly for (6,4) from (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) may not be accessible directly.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (5,3): move right to (4,3), then to (5,3).\n\nTwo moves.\n\nThen at (5,3), face down to interact with (5,4) to pick up onion.\n\nThen he can go to pot.\n\nBut pot (3,0) or (4,0).\n\n(4,0) is closer for him? (5,3) to (4,1) for (4,0).\n\n(4,0) adjacent is (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is empty.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (4,1): not direct, need to go to (5,2) but not walkable, so to (6,3) or (5,4) not, so to (4,3), then to (4,2) not, so to (4,3) to (4,4) not, so only to (3,3) or (5,3), etc.\n\nFrom (5,3), move left to (4,3), then down? To (4,2) not possible, so move to (4,3), then to (3,3), then to (3,2) not, so stuck.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down? No, (4,2) KC.\n\nSo he needs to go to (3,3) or (4,4) not, or (5,3), then to (6,3), etc. as before to reach (4,1).\n\nLong way.\n\nPerhaps use the onion at (7,1) which is closer to the serving area.\n\nBut let's think about cooking.\n\nAfter adding three onions, the pot starts cooking automatically, takes 5 turns.\n\nThen after 5 turns, it can be served with a plate.\n\nSo we need to get a plate ready.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice or Bob can get a plate.\n\nCurrently, after Alice adds the second onion, pot has two onions, need one more.\n\nBob can add the third onion.\n\nBut Bob needs to get an onion first.\n\nSince there is onion on (7,1), which is kitchen counter at (7,1).\n\n(7,1) is at x=7,y=1.\n\nAdjacent positions: (7,0) KC, (7,2) serving counter, (6,1), (8,1) not exist, so only (6,1) and perhaps (7,1) itself but not walkable.\n\nSo player can be at (6,1) and face right to interact with (7,1).\n\n(6,1) is empty? Not listed, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (6,0) is KC, etc.\n\nBob at (3,3), to go to (6,1).\n\nPath: for example, (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1).\n\nThen at (6,1), face right to interact with (7,1) to pick up onion.\n\nThen he can go to a pot.\n\nBut pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), far.\n\nHe could go to (4,1) for pot (4,0).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1).\n\nThen at (4,1), face down to add to pot (4,0).\n\nBut pot (3,0) has two onions, so better to add there.\n\nPot (3,0) can only be accessed from (3,1).\n\nSo if Alice is not there, Bob can go to (3,1).\n\nBut Alice might be using it.\n\nLet's coordinate.\n\nAfter Alice has added two onions to (3,0), she is at (3,1) facing down.\n\nThen she goes to get another onion.\n\nNearest onion: (7,1) or (5,4) etc.\n\n(7,1) might be closer.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,1): along y=1, (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (7,1)? But (7,1) not walkable, so to (6,1).\n\n(3,1) to (4,1) right, then to (5,1) right, then to (6,1) right, then at (6,1) face right to interact with (7,1).\n\nBut (7,1) has onion, so she can pick it up.\n\nThen back to (3,1) to add to pot.\n\nBut that's many moves.\n\nThere is onion at (5,4) and (6,4), but at y=4.\n\nAlice at (3,1) to (5,4): not direct.\n\nBob is free, so let Bob get the third onion.\n\nBob at (3,3), he can go to (7,1) as above.\n\nBut far.\n\nHe can go to (2,2) but onion was taken, or (3,2) empty.\n\nOr he can go to onion dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4) to get a new onion.\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nBob at (3,3), facing down, but (3,4) is above.\n\nHe can move up to (3,4)? (3,4) not walkable, but he can be at (3,3) and face up to interact with (3,4) dispenser.\n\nHe is at (3,3), (3,4) is above, so if he faces up, he can interact to grab an onion if empty-handed.\n\nSince he is empty-handed after placing onion.\n\nTurn 50 Bob placed onion on (3,2), so empty.\n\nTurn 51, Bob at (3,3), he can change orientation to U (up) to face (3,4).\n\nThen turn 52: interact to grab onion from dispenser.\n\nNow he has onion.\n\nThen he can go to pot (3,0) to add it.\n\nBut to add to (3,0), he needs to be at (3,1) and face down.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,1): need to go down, but (3,2) not walkable, so he can't move directly down.\n\nHe can only move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nThen from there, down if possible, but no, so he needs to go around, like to (2,3) to (2,2) not, or to (2,1), etc.\n\nFrom (3,3) move down not possible, so move left to (2,3) (empty).\n\nThen from (2,3), move down to (2,2) not possible, or to (2,4)? (2,4) KC, not walkable.\n\n(2,3) to (1,3)? (1,3) not listed, empty.\n\nThen to (1,2), etc., to reach (3,1) indirectly.\n\nLong way.\n\nFrom (3,3) move right to (4,3), then to (4,4) not, or to (5,3), etc., same issue.\n\nSo it's difficult for Bob to reach the pot area quickly because of the counters blocking.\n\nTherefore, better to use the existing onions on counters for the pot, and have Bob help with getting the plate or something.\n\nLet's list the onions available:\n- (2,2) has onion, but Alice will take it.\n- (3,2) has onion, placed by Bob.\n- (7,1) has onion\n- (5,4) has onion\n- (6,4) has onion\n\nAlice can take from (2,2), then from (3,2), then we need one more.\n\nBob can take from (7,1) and bring it.\n\nBut Bob is at (3,3).\n\nFirst, let's have Alice get the first two onions quickly.\n\nFrom turn 50:\n\nTurn 50:\n- Alice: move L to (2,1)  // now at (2,1) facing left\n- Bob: interact I to place onion on (3,2)  // now (3,2) has onion, Bob empty\n\nTurn 51:\n- Alice: change orientation to U (up)  // facing (2,2)\n- Bob: change orientation to U (up) to face (3,4) for later, but he can do something else. Since he is empty, he can move or wait.\n\nTurn 52:\n- Alice: interact I to pick up onion from (2,2)  // now holding onion\n- Bob: let's say he moves to (4,3) to start going to (7,1) or something. But let's see.\n\nAfter Alice picks onion, she can go to (3,1) to add to pot.\n\nTurn 53:\n- Alice: move R to (3,1)  // now at (3,1) facing right (since moved right)\n\nTurn 54:\n- Alice: change orientation to D (down) to face pot (3,0)\n\nTurn 55:\n- Alice: interact I to add onion to pot (3,0)  // pot has one onion, Alice empty\n\nNow she can pick up the onion on (3,2).\n\nTurn 56:\n- Alice: change orientation to U (up) to face (3,2)  // since at (3,1), (3,2) above\n\nTurn 57:\n- Alice: interact I to pick up onion from (3,2)  // now holding onion\n\nTurn 58:\n- Alice: change orientation to D (down) to face pot\n\nTurn 59:\n- Alice: interact I to add second onion to pot (3,0)  // pot has two onions, Alice empty\n\nNow need third onion.\n\nBob is at, say, turn 51 Bob: after placing onion, at turn 51, he changed to face up or something.\n\nAt turn 50 Bob placed onion.\n\nTurn 51 Bob: he can move to (4,3) for example.\n\nTurn 51: Alice changed orientation, Bob move R to (4,3)  // now at (4,3) facing right\n\nTurn 52: Alice interact, Bob move R to (5,3)  // at (5,3) facing right\n\nTurn 53: Alice move to (3,1), Bob move R to (6,3)  // at (6,3) facing right\n\nTurn 54: Alice change orient, Bob move D to (6,2)  // assume (6,2) empty, at (6,2) facing down\n\nTurn 55: Alice add onion, Bob move D to (6,1)  // at (6,1) facing down\n\nTurn 56: Alice change to up, Bob change orientation to R (right) to face (7,1)\n\nTurn 57: Alice pick up from (3,2), Bob interact I to pick up onion from (7,1)  // Bob holding onion\n\nTurn 58: Alice change to down, Bob can start moving to (3,1)\n\nBut Bob at (6,1) with onion, to (3,1) far.\n\nHe can add to pot (4,0) instead.\n\nPot (4,0) at (4,0), adjacent (4,1).\n\nBob at (6,1), can go to (5,1) to (4,1).\n\nTurn 58: Alice changing to down, Bob move L to (5,1)  // left to (5,1), facing left\n\nTurn 59: Alice add onion, pot (3,0) has two, Bob move L to (4,1)  // to (4,1), facing left\n\nTurn 60: Bob change orientation to D (down) to face pot (4,0)\n\nTurn 61: Bob interact to add onion to pot (4,0)  // but this is for pot (4,0), not (3,0)\n\nPot (3,0) has two, we need third for (3,0).\n\nBob adding to (4,0) starts a new pot, which also needs three onions.\n\nBut we have only one onion left on counters? (5,4) and (6,4) have onions.\n\nAfter Bob adds to (4,0), it has one onion.\n\nThen we need to fill either pot.\n\nBut let's focus on one soup first.\n\nFor pot (3,0), we need third onion.\n\nAlice is empty at turn 59, at (3,1).\n\nShe can go to get another onion, say from (7,1) but Bob just took it, or from (5,4).\n\n(5,4) at x=5,y=4.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (5,4): path via (4,1) to (5,1) to (5,2) not walkable, so to (6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (6,4) not, or to (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,1) move right to (4,1) turn 60.\n\nThen to (5,1) turn 61.\n\nThen to (6,1) turn 62.\n\nThen at (6,1), she can go to (6,2) turn 63, then to (6,3) turn 64, then at (6,3) face down to interact with (6,4) to pick up onion turn 65.\n\nThen back to (3,1) to add, many turns.\n\nSince there is onion at (5,4), from (5,3) face down.\n\nBut (5,3) is at y=3.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (5,3) etc.\n\nStill long.\n\nBob has onion at (4,1), he can go to (3,1) but Alice is there, and (3,1) is only access to pot (3,0).\n\nIf Alice moves away, Bob can add.\n\nBut Alice is at (3,1) at turn 59.\n\nTurn 60: Alice can move away, e.g. to (4,1), but Bob is at (4,1) at turn 59? Let's synchronize.\n\nAt turn 59:\n- Alice at (3,1), just added second onion, empty, facing down.\n- Bob at (4,1), holding onion, facing left (from moving left).\n\nTurn 60:\n- Alice: move R to (4,1)  // but (4,1) has Bob, players cannot walk through each other, so Alice cannot move to (4,1) if Bob is there.\n\nPositions: at turn 59, Alice at (3,1), Bob at (4,1), so (4,1) occupied, Alice can move to (2,1) or (3,0) not, or (3,2) not, or (4,1) occupied, so only possible move left to (2,1) or up to (3,2) not, or down not, or right to (4,1) occupied. So only move left to (2,1) or stay or change orientation.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can move or interact.\n\nTo free (3,1) for Bob to add onion to pot (3,0).\n\nAlice can move left to (2,1).\n\nTurn 60:\n- Alice: move L to (2,1)  // now at (2,1) facing left\n- Bob: at (4,1), he can move to (3,1) since Alice moved, so move L to (3,1)  // now at (3,1) facing left (since moved left)\n\nTurn 61:\n- Alice: at (2,1), she can do nothing or get another onion, but let's see Bob.\n- Bob: at (3,1), facing left, but to interact with pot (3,0), he needs to face down. So change orientation to D (down)\n\nTurn 62:\n- Bob: interact I to add onion to pot (3,0)  // now pot has three onions, cooking starts. Bob empty.\n\nNow the soup is cooking at turn 62, will be ready at turn 62 + 5 = turn 67.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice and Bob can prepare to serve.\n\nNeed a clean plate to serve the soup.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice is at (2,1), can go to (0,2).\n\n(0,2) is plate dispenser.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (0,2): via (2,2) not walkable, so to (1,1) or (1,2).\n\n(2,1) to (1,1) left, then to (1,2) up, then at (1,2) face left to interact with (0,2).\n\n(1,2) should be empty.\n\nTurn 62: Alice at (2,1), after moving left at turn 60.\n\nTurn 62: Alice move L to (1,1)  // assuming (1,1) empty, at (1,1) facing left\n\nTurn 63: Alice change orientation to U (up) to face (1,2)? (1,2) is at y=2, so from (1,1) facing up to (1,2), but (1,2) is a tile, which may be empty or not.\n\n(1,2) not listed, so empty tile, but to interact with (0,2), she needs to be at a tile adjacent to (0,2) and facing it.\n\n(0,2) adjacent tiles: (0,1), (0,3), (1,2), (-1,2) not, so (0,1) KC, (0,3) KC, (1,2) empty.\n\nSo she can be at (1,2) and face left to interact with (0,2).\n\nAt (1,1), she can move up to (1,2) if empty.\n\nTurn 63: Alice move U to (1,2)  // now at (1,2) facing up (since moved up)\n\nThen turn 64: change orientation to L (left) to face (0,2)\n\nTurn 65: interact to grab plate from dispenser. Now holding plate.\n\nThen she needs to go back to pot (3,0) to serve the soup.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,1).\n\nPath: (1,2) to (2,2) not, so to (1,1) down, then to (2,1) right, then to (3,1) right.\n\nTurn 66: Alice move D to (1,1)  // at (1,1) facing down\n\nTurn 67: move R to (2,1)  // at (2,1) facing right\n\nTurn 68: move R to (3,1)  // at (3,1) facing right\n\nTurn 69: change orientation to D (down) to face pot\n\nTurn 70: interact to serve soup, but soup is ready at turn 67, so she can serve at turn 70 if she arrives.\n\nBut at turn 70, soup is ready for 3 turns, but no issue, as long as served.\n\nThen after serving, she has soup on plate, need to deliver to serving counter (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,2): via (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2) to (7,2)? (7,2) serving counter, not walkable, so adjacent.\n\nServing counter (7,2) adjacent: (7,1), (7,3), (6,2), (8,2) not.\n\n(7,1) KC, (7,3) KC, so only (6,2) empty.\n\nSo at (6,2), face right to interact with (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,2): (3,1) to (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2).\n\nThen at (6,2) face right to serve.\n\nBut Alice at (3,1) after serving soup? After serving soup at turn 70, she is at (3,1) with the soup on plate.\n\nThen move to deliver.\n\nTurn 71: move R to (4,1)  // facing right\n\nTurn 72: move R to (5,1)  // facing right\n\nTurn 73: move R to (6,1)  // facing right\n\nTurn 74: move U to (6,2)  // now at (6,2) facing up\n\nTurn 75: change orientation to R (right) to face (7,2)\n\nTurn 76: interact to deliver soup, reward 20.\n\nMany turns.\n\nBob can help with getting the plate or delivering.\n\nFor example, after the pot is filled, Bob can get the plate.\n\nAt turn 62, pot starts cooking, Bob is at (3,1) empty after adding onion.\n\nHe can go to get plate.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (0,2): similar path.\n\n(3,1) to (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,2) then interact.\n\nTurn 62: Bob move L to (2,1)  // to (2,1) facing left\n\nTurn 63: move L to (1,1)  // to (1,1) facing left\n\nTurn 64: move U to (1,2)  // to (1,2) facing up\n\nTurn 65: change orientation to L (left) to face (0,2)\n\nTurn 66: interact to grab plate  // holding plate\n\nThen he needs to go back to (3,1) to serve the soup when ready.\n\nSoup ready at turn 67.\n\nTurn 67: Bob at (1,2) with plate, need to go to (3,1).\n\nTurn 67: move D to (1,1)  // facing down\n\nTurn 68: move R to (2,1)  // facing right\n\nTurn 69: move R to (3,1)  // facing right\n\nTurn 70: change orientation to D (down) to face pot\n\nTurn 71: interact to serve soup  // now holding soup\n\nThen deliver to (7,2).\n\nTurn 72: move R to (4,1)  // etc., same as before.\n\nBut at turn 71, soup is served, while ready at 67, so 4 turns late, but ok.\n\nAlice can be doing something else, like starting another soup.\n\nBut for now, let's optimize for one soup.\n\nTo save time, since there are onions on (5,4) and (6,4), we can have Alice or Bob get them for another pot.\n\nBut let's focus on the sequence for Alice.\n\nThe task is to plan for Alice, optionally for Bob, but the answer format is for Alice's actions.\n\nThe user said: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but the answer format only shows actions for Alice, I think.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice\" and the answer format is for turns with actions, probably for Alice.\n\nIt says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but in the box, it's turn t: action, so likely for Alice only.\n\nI need to provide only Alice's actions.\n\nBob will be controlled separately, but for planning, I assume Bob cooperates or I can suggest.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to specify Alice's actions based on what Bob might do.\n\nTo simplify, I can plan Alice's actions assuming Bob is helping, but since I don't control Bob, I should plan Alice to be efficient regardless.\n\nPerhaps have Alice fill the pot and get the plate, while Bob does something else.\n\nBut Bob might not be optimal.\n\nSince the state is given, and action history, I can predict Bob's action, but it's limited.\n\nAction history for Bob: I, D, R, L, D, most recent D.\n\nAt turn 50, Bob position (3,3), facing down, holding onion.\n\nAfter history, he might continue down, but can't, so he might move left or right.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll plan Alice's actions independently.\n\nLet's have Alice focus on getting the soup delivered quickly.\n\nFrom current state, turn 50.\n\nAlice at (3,1), facing left, holding nothing.\n\nInstead of going to (2,2), she can go directly to an onion closer or to the plate.\n\nBut (2,2) is close.\n\nShe can face down to interact with pot, but has nothing.\n\nOr she can go to (7,1) for onion, but far.\n\nBest to pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nSo turn 50: Alice move L to (2,1)  // to (2,1) facing left\n\nThen at (2,1), she needs to face up to interact with (2,2).\n\nTurn 51: change orientation U to face up\n\nTurn 52: interact I to pick up onion from (2,2)  // now holding onion\n\nThen go to (3,1) to add to pot.\n\nTurn 53: move R to (3,1)  // to (3,1) facing right\n\nTurn 54: change orientation D to face down\n\nTurn 55: interact I to add onion to pot (3,0)  // pot has one onion, Alice empty\n\nNow, instead of picking from (3,2), which may not have onion yet, she can go to another onion.\n\nFor example, to (3,2) if Bob placed it.\n\nBut Bob may not have placed it.\n\nIn the initial plan, I had Bob place it, but since I don't control Bob, I can't rely on that.\n\nSo assume Bob does his own thing.\n\nAlice can go to (7,1) for another onion.\n\nBut far.\n\nThere is onion on (7,1), (5,4), etc.\n\n(7,1) is at (7,1), from (3,1) to (7,1) via (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n\nTurn 56: move R to (4,1)  // to (4,1) facing right\n\nTurn 57: move R to (5,1)  // to (5,1) facing right\n\nTurn 58: move R to (6,1)  // to (6,1) facing right\n\nTurn 59: change orientation R to face right (towards (7,1))\n\nTurn 60: interact I to pick up onion from (7,1)  // holding onion\n\nThen back to (3,1)\n\nTurn 61: move L to (5,1)  // to (5,1) facing left? When moving left, orientation left.\n\nMove L from (6,1) to (5,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 62: move L to (4,1)  // to (4,1) facing left\n\nTurn 63: move L to (3,1)  // to (3,1) facing left\n\nTurn 64: change orientation D to face down\n\nTurn 65: interact to add second onion to pot  // pot has two onions\n\nThen she needs a third onion.\n\nShe can go to (5,4) or something, but even farther.\n\nOr Bob might add one, but not reliable.\n\nSince there is onion on (5,4), she can get it.\n\nBut let's see if she can use the onion dispensers.\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nAlice at (3,1), to (3,4): above, but (3,2) not walkable, so need to go around.\n\nFor example, to (2,1) to (2,3) etc.\n\nLong.\n\nSo perhaps for the third onion, it's better to have it from a counter or Bob.\n\nBut to make it work, let's assume that Bob adds an onion or something.\n\nSince the pot at (4,0) is empty, and there are onions, we can have two pots cooking, but that might take longer for one soup.\n\nFocus on one.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can go get a plate first, while Bob fills the pot.\n\nBut Bob may not fill it.\n\nAt turn 50, Bob has onion, at (3,3), facing down.\n\nIf he faces down, and (3,2) is empty, he can place onion on (3,2), which is likely.\n\nFrom history, he did I, D, R, L, D, so he might continue.\n\nBut let's not assume.\n\nFor Alice, to be efficient, she can pick up onion from (2,2), add to pot, then since there is onion on (3,2) if Bob places it, or she can go to the plate dispenser directly after adding one onion, but we need three onions.\n\nPerhaps Alice and Bob can work on different tasks.\n\nLet's define a sequence for Alice only for H turns, say H=20, to get the soup delivered.\n\nBut it might take more than 20 turns.\n\nFrom turn 50, by turn 70 or so.\n\nBut let's calculate the minimum turns for Alice to deliver soup.\n\nFirst, get three onions to the pot.\n\nBut Alice alone would take many turns.\n\nWith Bob helping, faster.\n\nSince the task is to plan for Alice, and optionally Bob, but the answer is for Alice, I'll provide Alice's actions, and suggest what Bob should do.\n\nBut in the box, only actions for Alice.\n\nI think for the sequence, I'll write Alice's actions assuming Bob cooperates as per the initial plan.\n\nOtherwise, it might not be optimal.\n\nPerhaps the environment will simulate Bob.\n\nBut for this response, I'll provide Alice's actions for the next turns.\n\nLet's go back to the first plan with Bob placing onion on (3,2).\n\nSo at turn 50:\n- Alice: move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 51:\n- Alice: change orientation U\n\nTurn 52:\n- Alice: interact I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nTurn 53:\n- Alice: move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 54:\n- Alice: change orientation D\n\nTurn 55:\n- Alice: interact I (add onion to pot)\n\nTurn 56:\n- Alice: change orientation U\n\nTurn 57:\n- Alice: interact I (pick up onion from (3,2), assumed placed by Bob)\n\nTurn 58:\n- Alice: change orientation D\n\nTurn 59:\n- Alice: interact I (add second onion)\n\nThen for the third onion, Alice can go to (7,1) or have Bob bring it.\n\nBut for Alice, she can stay or something.\n\nAfter turn 59, Alice empty at (3,1), she can go to get plate.\n\nTurn 60: move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 61: move L to (1,1)\n\nTurn 62: move U to (1,2)\n\nTurn 63: change orientation L\n\nTurn 64: interact I (grab plate)\n\nThen when soup is ready, she can serve, but soup starts cooking when third onion added.\n\nThird onion not added yet.\n\nAt turn 59, only two onions in pot.\n\nWe need third onion.\n\nIf Bob adds it, good, otherwise Alice must.\n\nBut in sequence for Alice, after turn 59, she can go to (7,1) for onion.\n\nTurn 60: move R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 61: move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 62: move R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 63: change orientation R\n\nTurn 64: interact I (pick up onion from (7,1))\n\nTurn 65: move L to (5,1)  // from (6,1) move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 66: move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 67: move L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 68: change orientation D\n\nTurn 69: interact I (add third onion)  // now pot has three, cooking starts at turn 69, ready at 74.\n\nThen she needs to get plate, but she is at (3,1), just added onion, so empty.\n\nTurn 70: move L to (2,1)\n\n etc. to get plate, then back to serve at turn 75 or later, then deliver.\n\nBut late.\n\nAfter adding second onion at turn 59, she can go get plate, then when soup has three onions, she can serve.\n\nBut third onion may not be there.\n\nTo save time, have Alice get the plate while the pot is being filled.\n\nFor example, after adding the first onion, she goes for plate.\n\nBut then the pot has only one onion, and we need to add more.\n\nBob can add.\n\nBut let's finalize a sequence for Alice.\n\nI think for this response, I'll provide Alice's actions for the next 10 turns or so, to start the process.\n\nThen she can continue.\n\nBut the user says \"over next several turns(say, H turns)\", so I need to choose H.\n\nLet's say H=10.\n\nFrom turn 50 to 59.\n\nAlice actions:\n\nTurn 50: move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 51: change orientation U\n\nTurn 52: interact I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nTurn 53: move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 54: change orientation D\n\nTurn 55: interact I (add to pot (3,0))\n\nTurn 56: change orientation U\n\nTurn 57: interact I (pick up onion from (3,2), assuming it has onion from Bob)\n\nTurn 58: change orientation D\n\nTurn 59: interact I (add second onion)\n\nThen at turn 60, she can go for the third onion or for plate.\n\nBut for H=10, up to turn 59.\n\nSo sequence for Alice from turn 50 to 59.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 57, she interacts with (3,2), which may not have onion if Bob didn't place it, but in the state, it might be empty.\n\nBut in the initial state, (3,2) is empty, but Bob might place it.\n\nTo be safe, after adding first onion, she can go to another counter.\n\nBut let's assume that Bob places the onion as per common sense.\n\nOtherwise, the planning is hard.\n\nI think for the purpose, I'll provide the sequence.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 50: L\n\nTurn 51: U (change orientation up)\n\nTurn 52: I (interact with (2,2) to pick up onion)\n\nTurn 53: R (move to (3,1))\n\nTurn 54: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 55: I (interact with pot to add onion)\n\nTurn 56: U (change orientation up to face (3,2))\n\nTurn 57: I (interact with (3,2) to pick up onion, assuming placed)\n\nTurn 58: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 59: I (add second onion to pot)\n\nThen for turn 60 onwards, she can go to get the third onion or the plate.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll put up to turn 59.\n\nH is several, say 10 turns.\n\nSo actions from turn 50 to 59 for Alice.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 50: L\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: I\nTurn 53: R\nTurn 54: D\nTurn 55: I\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: I\nTurn 58: D\nTurn 59: I\n}\n\nBut Turn 51 U is change orientation, not move, since she is at (2,1), and U is change orientation to up.\n\nSimilarly, Turn 54 D is change orientation.\n\nTurn 56 U is change orientation.\n\nIn the action list, U can be move or change orientation, depending on context, but in the action, it's specified as Move or Change Orientation.\n\nIn the action set, it's {U, D, L, R, I, S}, and U can be move up or change orientation up, based on the action type.\n\nBut in the sequence, we specify the action, and it's clear from the context whether it's move or change orientation.\n\nFor example, if she is on a tile, and does U, it could be move up if possible, or change orientation if not possible.\n\nBut in this case, at (2,1), after move L to there, she can move up? Up to (2,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she cannot move up, so U would be change orientation to up.\n\nSimilarly, at (3,1), she can move up to (3,2)? (3,2) not walkable, so cannot move up, so U is change orientation.\n\nSo in the sequence, Turn 51: U is change orientation to up.\n\nTurn 54: D at (3,1), down to (3,0) not walkable, so change orientation down.\n\nTurn 56: U at (3,1), cannot move up, so change orientation up.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nFor the third onion, Bob or Alice can get it later.\n\nSo for now, I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should coordinate to prepare and deliver onion soup (Recipe 1: 3 onions, reward 20, cooking time 5 turns). Given the current game state at turn 50, the plan focuses on filling the pot at (3,0) with onions as efficiently as possible, leveraging existing onions on kitchen counters to minimize movement. Alice will handle adding the first two onions to the pot, while Bob is expected to place his held onion on the kitchen counter at (3,2) for Alice to use, and then fetch the third onion. After the pot is filled, Alice will obtain a clean plate from the dispenser at (0,2), serve the cooked soup, and deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2) for the reward.\n\n### Key Assumptions and Coordination:\n- Bob cooperates by placing his onion on (3,2) at turn 50 (via interact action) and later fetches the third onion from a nearby counter (e.g., (7,1)) to add to the pot. This is inferred from Bob's action history (ending with \"D\" indicating a downward focus) and the need for teamwork.\n- The pot at (3,0) is used for cooking, as it is directly accessible from Alice's position.\n- Existing onions on counters are utilized: (2,2) for Alice's first onion, and (3,2) for the second (after Bob places it).\n- Alice's sequence is optimized for minimal turns, with Bob handling complementary tasks.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence for Turns 50 to 59:\nThe sequence below plans Alice's actions for the next 10 turns (H=10), ensuring she adds two onions to the pot quickly. This sets up the soup to start cooking by turn 59, with the third onion to be added by Bob shortly after.\n\n- **Turn 50: Move L to (2,1)**  \n  Alice moves left to access the onion on (2,2). She now faces left at (2,1).\n\n- **Turn 51: Change orientation U to face up**  \n  Alice changes orientation to face (2,2) for interaction. She cannot move up to (2,2) as it is a kitchen counter.\n\n- **Turn 52: Interact I to pick up onion from (2,2)**  \n  Alice picks up the onion, now holding it.\n\n- **Turn 53: Move R to (3,1)**  \n  Alice moves right to position herself above the pot at (3,0). She now faces right.\n\n- **Turn 54: Change orientation D to face down**  \n  Alice changes orientation to face the pot at (3,0) for interaction.\n\n- **Turn 55: Interact I to add onion to pot (3,0)**  \n  Alice adds her onion to the pot. The pot now has 1 onion, and Alice is empty-handed.\n\n- **Turn 56: Change orientation U to face up**  \n  Alice changes orientation to face the kitchen counter at (3,2), where Bob is expected to have placed an onion.\n\n- **Turn 57: Interact I to pick up onion from (3,2)**  \n  Alice picks up the onion from (3,2) (placed by Bob at turn 50). She now holds an onion.\n\n- **Turn 58: Change orientation D to face down**  \n  Alice changes orientation to face the pot at (3,0) again.\n\n- **Turn 59: Interact I to add onion to pot (3,0)**  \n  Alice adds the second onion to the pot. The pot now has 2 onions.\n\n### Next Steps Beyond Turn 59:\n- Bob should add the third onion to the pot at (3,0) by turn 60–61 (e.g., by moving to (3,1) and interacting). This starts the soup cooking at turn 61, ready by turn 66.\n- Alice should then fetch a clean plate from (0,2) (turns 60–65), return to serve the soup at turn 66–67, and deliver to (7,2) by turn 70–75 for the reward.\n- With this coordination, the soup can be delivered by turn 75, earning 20 points. Alice and Bob can then start a new soup using the other pot or available onions.\n\nThis plan maximizes efficiency by minimizing Alice's movement and leveraging Bob's actions for parallel tasking. If Bob does not cooperate, Alice may need to fetch the third onion herself, but the sequence above is optimal under expected teamwork.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 50: L \\\\\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: I \\\\\nTurn 53: R \\\\\nTurn 54: D \\\\\nTurn 55: I \\\\\nTurn 56: U \\\\\nTurn 57: I \\\\\nTurn 58: D \\\\\nTurn 59: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 54. The goal is to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the environment and current state:\n\n**Tile Types:**\n- Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n- Onion Dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)   [Note: no tomato dispensers]\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\n**Recipe Information:**\n- Only one recipe: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n\n**Current Game State (turn 54):**\n- Alice:\n  - Position: (3,1)\n  - Orientation: L (left)\n  - Holding: one onion\n  - Action History: L, U, I, R, L (most recent last: so last action was L)\n\n- Bob:\n  - Position: (3,3)\n  - Orientation: L (left)\n  - Holding: nothing\n  - Action History: D, I, U, R, L (most recent last: last action was L)\n\n**Non-empty Kitchen Counters:**\n- (2,2): onion\n- (6,4): onion\n- (7,1): onion\n- (5,4): onion\n\n**Pots:**\n- Both pots (at (3,0) and (4,0)) are empty.\n\n**Objective:**\nWe need to deliver as many onion soups as possible to the serving counter (7,2) to get the reward of 20 per soup.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Each pot requires 3 onions to start cooking (which takes 5 turns).\n- After cooking, we need a plate to serve the soup and then deliver it to the serving counter.\n- Players can carry only one item at a time.\n\n**Current Resources:**\n- There are onions already placed on several kitchen counters: (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4). Also, Alice is holding one onion.\n- There are two pots available at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\n**Plan:**\nWe have two pots. We can start two soups simultaneously. Each soup requires 3 onions.\n\nTotal onions needed for two soups: 6 onions.\nWe have:\n- Alice holding 1 onion.\n- On counters: 4 onions (at (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4)).\n- We can get more onions from the dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nSo we have 1 (held) + 4 (on counters) = 5 onions. We need one more onion for two soups.\n\nBut note: we can also use the dispensers to get more onions.\n\nHowever, let's think about the steps:\n\nWe need to:\n1. Collect onions and put them into the pots until each pot has 3 onions (then cooking starts automatically).\n2. After 5 turns of cooking, the soup is ready. Then we need to get a plate, use it on the pot to get the soup (which is now a plate with soup), and then deliver it to the serving counter (7,2).\n\nBut note: we are at turn 54 and we are planning for the next several turns (say H turns). Since the cooking takes 5 turns, we can only get one soup delivered if we start now? But we can start two soups and have one delivered within H if H is long enough? However, the problem doesn't specify H, so we should aim to start as many soups as possible and deliver them as soon as they are ready.\n\nBut let's consider the immediate actions:\n\nWe have two players: Alice and Bob.\n\nAlice is at (3,1) holding an onion. She is facing left (so she is facing (2,1)?). But note that (3,1) is adjacent to (3,0) (down) and (3,2) (up) and (2,1) (left) and (4,1) (right). However, the tile to her left (2,1) is not necessarily a non-empty tile? We don't have the full grid, but we know the non-empty tiles. We know that (3,0) is a pot and (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Actually, we have the list of kitchen counters: (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (3,2) is in the list.\n\nBut note: Alice is at (3,1) and facing left (L) which is towards (2,1). What is at (2,1)? We don't have any non-empty tile at (2,1) in the provided lists. So (2,1) is an empty tile? Actually, the non-empty tiles we have are the dispensers, pots, serving counter, and kitchen counters. Since (2,1) is not listed, it must be an empty tile. Therefore, if Alice wants to interact with a non-empty tile, she must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nCurrently, Alice is adjacent to:\n- Below: (3,0) is a pot.\n- Above: (3,2) is a kitchen counter.\n\nBut she is facing left (towards (2,1)), which is an empty tile. So she cannot interact with the pot or the kitchen counter without changing orientation.\n\nBob is at (3,3) facing left (towards (2,3)). What is at (2,3)? Not listed, so empty. He is adjacent to:\n- Above: (3,4) is an onion dispenser? Actually, (3,4) is an onion dispenser. But he is at (3,3) and facing left (2,3). So he is not facing the dispenser. Also, he is adjacent to (3,4) (up) and (3,2) (down). (3,4) is an onion dispenser and (3,2) is a kitchen counter.\n\nImmediate possibilities:\n\nAlice (at (3,1) holding an onion) can:\n- Move down to (3,0) to get next to the pot? But note: to interact with the pot, she must be adjacent and facing it. Currently, if she moves down to (3,0), she would be on the pot tile? But the pot is a non-empty tile and players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. Therefore, she cannot move to (3,0). Instead, she must stand adjacent and face the pot to interact.\n\nSo Alice can:\n- Change orientation to face down (towards the pot at (3,0)) and then interact to put the onion in the pot? But note: she is at (3,1) and the pot is at (3,0) which is below her. So if she faces down (D) then she is facing (3,0). Then she can interact (I) to put the onion into the pot.\n\nAlternatively, she could move to (2,1) or (4,1) but that might not be necessary.\n\nSimilarly, Bob (at (3,3) holding nothing) can:\n- Change orientation to face up (towards the onion dispenser at (3,4)) and then interact to get an onion? But note: he is adjacent to (3,4) above? Actually, (3,3) and (3,4) are adjacent vertically. So if he faces up (U), then he can interact to grab an onion from the dispenser.\n\nBut wait: the dispenser is at (3,4) and Bob is at (3,3). So he is adjacent and if he faces up (towards (3,4)), then he can interact to get an onion.\n\nAlternatively, Bob could go to a kitchen counter to pick up an onion that is already there? There is one at (3,2) which is below him. But he is facing left. He could change orientation to down (to face (3,2)) and then interact to pick up the onion? But wait, (3,2) is a kitchen counter and it is currently empty? We have non-empty kitchen counters: (2,2) has an onion, (6,4), (7,1), (5,4). (3,2) is a kitchen counter but we don't have it listed as non-empty, so it must be empty? Therefore, there is no onion at (3,2). So Bob cannot pick up an onion from (3,2).\n\nTherefore, Bob's options:\n- He can go to a kitchen counter that has an onion? The closest one might be (2,2) or (3,2) is empty so not. (2,2) is adjacent to (3,2) but Bob is at (3,3). He would need to move to (3,2) and then to (2,2) but that might take two moves. Alternatively, he can get an onion from the dispenser at (3,4) which is adjacent.\n\nSo let's plan:\n\nWe have two pots. We want to fill both with 3 onions. We have 5 onions available (1 held by Alice and 4 on counters) and we can get more from the dispensers.\n\nBut note: the onions on the counters are at:\n- (2,2): onion\n- (6,4): onion\n- (7,1): onion\n- (5,4): onion\n\nWe can assign tasks to Alice and Bob.\n\nFirst, Alice is at (3,1) holding an onion. She can put that onion into the pot at (3,0) by facing down and interacting.\n\nThen, after putting the onion, she is empty-handed. Then she can go to a kitchen counter to pick up an onion? Or to a dispenser? But the dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4) which are a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the onions on the counters to fill the pots.\n\nBut note: the pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The kitchen counters with onions are at (2,2), (7,1), (5,4), (6,4). (7,1) is close to (3,0)? Not really. (2,2) is above (3,0). Actually, (2,2) is two steps away: from (3,0) to (3,1) to (2,1) to (2,2). But we can't walk through non-empty tiles.\n\nWe need to design a sequence of actions for both players.\n\nProposal:\n\nShort-term goal: \n- Alice puts her onion into the pot at (3,0).\n- Bob gets an onion from the dispenser at (3,4) and then brings it to a pot.\n\nBut note: we have two pots. We can use both.\n\nLet me map the grid for clarity (approximate):\n\nRow y=4: [Kitchen, Kitchen, OnionDispenser, OnionDispenser, Kitchen, Kitchen] ... at x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7? Actually, the grid is from x=0 to 7 and y=0 to 4? We have y=0 to 4.\n\nLet me sketch:\n\ny=4: (0,4): kitchen, (1,4): kitchen, (2,4): kitchen, (3,4): onion dispenser, (4,4): onion dispenser, (5,4): kitchen (with onion), (6,4): kitchen (with onion), (7,4): kitchen.\n\ny=3: (0,3): kitchen, (3,3): Bob, (7,3): kitchen.\n\ny=2: (0,2): plate dispenser, (2,2): kitchen (with onion), (3,2): kitchen, (4,2): kitchen, (5,2): kitchen, (7,2): serving counter.\n\ny=1: (0,1): kitchen, (3,1): Alice (facing left), (7,1): kitchen (with onion).\n\ny=0: (0,0): kitchen, (1,0): kitchen, (2,0): kitchen, (3,0): pot, (4,0): pot, (5,0): kitchen, (6,0): kitchen, (7,0): kitchen.\n\nNow, Alice at (3,1) holding an onion. She can put it in the pot at (3,0) by facing down and interacting.\n\nBob at (3,3) holding nothing. He can get an onion from the dispenser at (3,4) by moving up to (3,4)? But wait: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. The dispenser is non-empty, so he cannot step on (3,4). Instead, he must stand adjacent and face it. He is at (3,3) and (3,4) is above. So he can face up and interact to grab an onion. Then he can carry that onion to a pot.\n\nWhich pot? (3,0) is the closest? But (4,0) is also available. But note that Alice is about to use (3,0). We can use both.\n\nAfter Alice puts her onion in (3,0), that pot will have 1 onion. Then we need 2 more for that pot.\n\nBob can put his onion in the same pot? Or in the other pot? Let's use both.\n\nPlan for Alice:\nTurn 54: Alice should face down (D) to be able to interact with the pot at (3,0). But note: the action is to change orientation? The actions are: Move (which changes position and orientation) or Change Orientation (which just changes orientation without moving). Since she is on an empty tile and the adjacent tile (3,0) is non-empty, if she tries to move down she cannot (because non-empty). So she must use a change orientation action to face down.\n\nSo for Alice at turn 54:\n- Action: D (change orientation to down) -> now she is facing the pot at (3,0).\n\nThen, at turn 55, she can interact (I) to put the onion in the pot.\n\nAfter that, the pot at (3,0) will have 1 onion. She will be empty-handed.\n\nThen she can go to pick up an onion from a nearby counter? The closest onion on a counter is at (2,2) or (7,1). (2,2) is two steps away: (3,1) to (3,2) [but (3,2) is a kitchen counter, which is non-empty? Actually, kitchen counters are non-empty only if they have an item. We have (3,2) is a kitchen counter but it is empty? Because in the non-empty list we only have (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4). So (3,2) is empty. Therefore, Alice can move to (3,2) and then to (2,2) to pick up the onion at (2,2). But note: (3,2) is a kitchen counter, which is non-empty? But the rule says: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. However, a kitchen counter without an item is walkable? Actually, the rule says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" It doesn't explicitly say if it's walkable when empty. But typically in Overcooked, counters are walkable. The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as having an item? Or as being a dispenser, pot, etc.? Actually, the tile types are fixed. The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those that are not empty. And the tile types: empty tile is walkable, but dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are non-empty? But then how do we get to them? We must be adjacent to interact. So we cannot walk onto them. Therefore, Alice cannot walk onto (3,2) because it is a kitchen counter (non-empty tile) even if it is empty? \n\nWait, the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other. Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And non-empty tiles are defined as: dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters? Or only when they are occupied? Actually, the rule says: \"non-empty tiles\" meaning tiles that are not of type \"Empty Tile\". So all the listed types (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are non-empty and hence not walkable.\n\nTherefore, Alice cannot step on (3,2) because it is a kitchen counter (non-empty). Similarly, she cannot step on (2,2) because it has an onion? Actually, even without an item, the kitchen counter is non-empty? The rule says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is a tile type. So we cannot walk on it.\n\nSo Alice must navigate around non-empty tiles. The grid has walkable tiles only where not listed? We don't have a full grid, so we must assume that any tile not in the non-empty tile list is empty and walkable.\n\nBut the non-empty tiles are the ones listed: kitchen counters (even without items), dispensers, pots, serving counters. So they are all non-empty and hence not walkable.\n\nTherefore, the walkable tiles are the ones not in that list.\n\nSo for Alice at (3,1), she can move to adjacent empty tiles. What are the adjacent tiles?\n- Left: (2,1) -> not listed, so empty -> walkable.\n- Right: (4,1) -> not listed? We have kitchen counters at (0,1) and (7,1) but (4,1) is not listed -> so empty -> walkable.\n- Up: (3,2) -> is listed as a kitchen counter -> non-empty -> not walkable.\n- Down: (3,0) -> pot -> non-empty -> not walkable.\n\nSo Alice can only move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (3,3) can move to:\n- Left: (2,3) -> not listed -> empty -> walkable.\n- Right: (4,3) -> not listed -> empty -> walkable.\n- Up: (3,4) -> onion dispenser -> non-empty -> not walkable.\n- Down: (3,2) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> not walkable.\n\nSo Bob can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nNow, to get to the onion at (2,2): \n- (2,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) so we cannot step on it. But we can stand adjacent to it and face it to interact. The adjacent tiles are: (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2). But (1,2) is not listed? We don't have it, so it's empty? And (3,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter) so not walkable. So the only adjacent empty tiles are (2,1) and (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, the onion at (7,1) is on a kitchen counter at (7,1). Adjacent empty tiles: (7,0) is kitchen counter (non-empty) -> not walkable? Actually, (7,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. (6,1) -> not listed? We don't have (6,1) in the non-empty list, so empty. (7,2) is serving counter -> non-empty. So the only adjacent empty tile to (7,1) is (6,1).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nGiven this, let's plan:\n\nWe want to fill the two pots as quickly as possible.\n\nPot at (3,0): requires 3 onions.\nPot at (4,0): requires 3 onions.\n\nWe have:\n- Alice holding 1 onion: she can put it in (3,0) by facing down from (3,1) and then interacting.\n- Then she is empty. She can then go to (2,1) and then face down? But (2,1) is above (2,0) which is a kitchen counter? (2,0) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. And (2,1) is adjacent to (2,2) (which has an onion) to the right? Actually, (2,1) is below (2,2). So from (2,1), she can face up (U) to face (2,2) and interact to pick up the onion? Then she can carry that onion back to the pot at (3,0) by going to (3,1) and then facing down to interact.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can get an onion from the dispenser at (3,4) by facing up from (3,3) and interacting. Then he can carry it to the pot at (4,0). How? He would need to go from (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,2) but (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so he cannot step there. So he must go around? The path: (3,3) -> (4,3) (right) -> (4,2) is blocked, so then (4,3) -> (5,3) [if (5,3) is empty? We don't have (5,3) listed, so empty] -> (5,2) is kitchen counter -> non-empty -> blocked. Alternatively, (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,4) but (5,4) is kitchen counter (with onion) -> non-empty -> blocked. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to (4,3) and then down? (4,3) to (4,4) is blocked (onion dispenser). So he must go left or right? \n\nActually, from (3,3), Bob can go right to (4,3). Then from (4,3), he can go down? But down is (4,2) which is a kitchen counter -> blocked. So he must go to (5,3) [if empty] and then to (5,2) is blocked? So it seems difficult to get to the pots from (3,3) without going through non-empty tiles? \n\nWait, the pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The only adjacent empty tiles are above them: (3,1) and (4,1). Because (3,0) has above (3,1) and left (2,0) is kitchen counter (blocked), right (4,0) is pot (blocked), below (3,-1) doesn't exist. Similarly for (4,0): above (4,1), left (3,0) blocked, right (5,0) kitchen counter blocked.\n\nSo to access the pots, we must be at (3,1) for pot (3,0) and (4,1) for pot (4,0).\n\nNow, Bob is at (3,3). How can he get to (4,1)? \n\nPath: (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) is blocked? (5,2) is kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot step. Alternatively, (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) is blocked (kitchen counter) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) blocked? Then to (3,1) -> (4,1). \n\nBut (2,1) is empty and walkable. (2,3) is empty and walkable. So:\nBob: \n- Move left to (2,3) [turn 54: L? But he is facing left, so if he moves left he goes to (2,3)? But note: moving changes the position and orientation. The move action: L (x-1, y) and also sets orientation to L. Similarly for others.\n\nBut we can plan:\n\nBob at (3,3) facing left. \n- Turn 54: move left to (2,3) [now at (2,3) and facing left].\n- Then turn 55: move down to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot move there. So he must move down? But down from (2,3) is (2,2) -> blocked. So he cannot move down.\n\nThen what? From (2,3) he can move left? To (1,3) [if empty] -> we don't have (1,3) listed -> empty? Then (1,3) -> (1,2) [if empty] -> not listed -> empty. Then (1,2) -> (1,1) [if empty] -> not listed -> empty. Then (1,1) -> (2,1) [if empty] -> (2,1) is empty. Then (2,1) -> (3,1) [if empty] -> (3,1) is currently occupied by Alice? But Alice might move.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go from (3,3) to (4,3) and then to (4,4) is blocked, so (4,3) to (5,3) -> (5,3) to (5,4) is blocked (kitchen counter with onion) -> then to (6,3) [if empty] -> then (6,3) to (6,2) is blocked? (6,2) is not listed? We have (5,2) and (6,0) but not (6,2). So (6,2) is empty? Then (6,2) to (6,1) [empty?] -> (6,1) to (7,1) blocked? And then to (7,0) blocked? This seems long.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can get an onion from the dispenser and then drop it on a kitchen counter closer to the pot? For example, at (3,2) is a kitchen counter but empty. He can put the onion there, and then Alice or himself can pick it up later.\n\nBut let's think of a coordinated plan:\n\nSince it's complicated, let's focus on one pot first.\n\nPlan for Alice:\n- Turn 54: Change orientation to down (D) to face the pot at (3,0).\n- Turn 55: Interact (I) to put the onion in the pot at (3,0). Now the pot has 1 onion and Alice is empty.\n- Turn 56: Move left to (2,1) [because (3,2) is blocked, so she moves left to (2,1)].\n- Turn 57: Change orientation to up (U) to face (2,2) [which has an onion]. \n- Turn 58: Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (2,2). Now Alice is holding an onion.\n- Turn 59: Move right to (3,1).\n- Turn 60: Change orientation to down (D) to face the pot at (3,0).\n- Turn 61: Interact (I) to put the onion in the pot. Now pot has 2 onions.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can do:\n\n- Turn 54: Change orientation to up (U) to face the dispenser at (3,4).\n- Turn 55: Interact (I) to grab an onion from the dispenser. Now Bob is holding an onion.\n- Turn 56: Move right to (4,3).\n- Turn 57: Move down? Blocked. So move right to (5,3).\n- Turn 58: Move down to (5,2)? Blocked (kitchen counter). So he can't. Instead, from (4,3) he can move down? Blocked. So he must go to (5,3) and then to (5,4) is blocked. So he can go to (6,3) [if empty] -> not listed, so empty.\n- Turn 56: move right to (4,3)\n- Turn 57: move right to (5,3)\n- Turn 58: move down to (5,2)? Blocked. So he can move to (6,3) [if available] -> (6,3) is not listed -> empty.\n- Turn 58: move right to (6,3)\n- Turn 59: move down to (6,2) [empty?]\n- Turn 60: move down to (6,1) [empty?] -> then to (6,0) is kitchen counter -> blocked. Alternatively, from (6,1) he can move left to (5,1) [empty?] -> then to (5,0) blocked? Not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can drop the onion at a kitchen counter that is empty and closer, such as (3,2). But (3,2) is adjacent to (3,1) and (3,3) but he cannot step on (3,2). He can stand at (3,3) and face down to (3,2) and interact to place the onion. But he is at (3,3) and (3,2) is below him. So after grabbing the onion at turn 55, at turn 56 he can change orientation to down (D) to face (3,2) and then interact (I) to place the onion on (3,2). Then the onion is at (3,2) which is close to the pot.\n\nThen Alice, after she is done with the first two onions, can pick up that onion from (3,2) and put it in the pot.\n\nSo revised plan for Bob:\n- Turn 54: U (change orientation to up) [to face the dispenser at (3,4)]\n- Turn 55: I (interact) -> grab onion.\n- Turn 56: D (change orientation to down) [to face the kitchen counter at (3,2)]\n- Turn 57: I (interact) -> place onion on (3,2).\n\nThen the onion is on (3,2).\n\nMeanwhile, Alice is doing her sequence:\n\nAlice:\n- Turn 54: D (change orientation to down)\n- Turn 55: I (put onion in pot at (3,0)) -> pot has 1, Alice empty.\n- Turn 56: L (move left to (2,1))\n- Turn 57: U (change orientation to up to face (2,2))\n- Turn 58: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n- Turn 59: R (move right to (3,1))\n- Turn 60: D (change orientation to down)\n- Turn 61: I (put onion in pot) -> pot has 2.\n\nNow, the pot at (3,0) has 2 onions. We need one more. And there is an onion at (3,2) placed by Bob.\n\nAlice is at (3,1) after turn 59? At turn 59: she moves to (3,1). Then at turn 60 she changes orientation to down and at turn 61 she puts the onion. Then she is empty.\n\nThen she can pick up the onion at (3,2). How? She is at (3,1) and (3,2) is above. She can:\n- Turn 62: U (change orientation to up) to face (3,2)\n- Turn 63: I (pick up the onion from (3,2))\n\nThen she is holding an onion. Then she can put it in the pot:\n- Turn 64: D (change orientation to down) to face (3,0)\n- Turn 65: I (put onion in pot) -> now pot has 3 onions. Cooking starts.\n\nSo at turn 65, the pot at (3,0) starts cooking. It will be ready at turn 65 + 5 = turn 70.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob after placing the onion at (3,2) at turn 57 is empty and at (3,3). He can then go to get another onion from the dispenser and either put it in the other pot (at (4,0)) or in the same pot? But we have another pot at (4,0) that is empty.\n\nBob can then get an onion for the other pot.\n\nBob after turn 57 (at (3,3) empty):\n- Turn 58: U (face up to dispenser)\n- Turn 59: I (grab onion)\n- Then he needs to put it in the pot at (4,0). To do that, he must be at (4,1) and facing down? But he is at (3,3). How to get to (4,1)?\n\nPath: (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) blocked? So he must go around: (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,4) blocked -> (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (6,0) blocked -> (5,1) [if empty] -> (4,1). \n\nThis is long. Alternatively, he can drop the onion at a kitchen counter near (4,0), such as (4,1) but (4,1) is empty? And it's a kitchen counter? Actually, (4,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are at specific locations: (0,0), (1,0), ... (7,4). We don't have (4,1) in the list, so it is not a kitchen counter? Then it is an empty tile? So he cannot drop an item there because only kitchen counters can store items.\n\nTherefore, he must use an existing kitchen counter. The closest empty kitchen counter to (4,0) is? We have kitchen counters at (5,0), (6,0), (5,2), etc. (5,0) is adjacent to (4,0)? (5,0) is to the right of (4,0). But (5,0) is a kitchen counter. Bob can stand at (5,1) [if empty] and face down to (5,0) and interact to place the onion? But (5,0) is a kitchen counter and it is currently empty? Because the non-empty ones are only (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4). So (5,0) is empty.\n\nSo Bob can:\n- After grabbing the onion at turn 59, move to (4,3) [turn 58: move right to (4,3)? But at turn 58 he is doing U (orientation) and then at turn 59 I (interact), then at turn 60 he can move right to (4,3). Then turn 61 move right to (5,3). Then turn 62 move down to (5,2) blocked? So he can move to (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) [if empty]. (5,1) is empty? Then from (5,1) he can face down (D) to (5,0) and interact to place the onion on (5,0).\n\nThen that onion is on (5,0). But then someone has to pick it up and put it in the pot at (4,0). \n\nAlternatively, after the first pot is filled, Alice can help with the second pot.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are only planning for Alice, we might focus on one soup for now.\n\nBut the problem says we can optionally plan for Bob. However, the answer format is for Alice's actions. The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only shows actions for Alice? Let me read: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice\". And the answer format is for Alice: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nSo we only need to output Alice's actions.\n\nWe can assume that Bob will act independently, but we don't control him. So we must plan for Alice only, and hope that Bob will cooperate? Or we can assume we control both? The task says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\" and \"plan ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both, but the answer format only specifies Alice? \n\nLooking at the answer format: it only shows actions for Alice? The boxed part only has turns for Alice.\n\nSo I think we only output Alice's actions.\n\nTherefore, we plan for Alice only, and assume Bob will do reasonable things.\n\nSo for Alice, we focus on filling the pot at (3,0) to get one soup.\n\nAlice's actions:\n\nTurn 54: D (change orientation to down to face the pot)\nTurn 55: I (put onion in pot) -> pot has 1\nTurn 56: L (move left to (2,1))\nTurn 57: U (change orientation to up to face (2,2))\nTurn 58: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\nTurn 59: R (move right to (3,1))\nTurn 60: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 61: I (put onion in pot) -> pot has 2\n\nNow, we need one more onion. There is an onion at (7,1) and (6,4) and (5,4), but they are far. Also, there is one at (3,2) if Bob placed it. But we don't control Bob.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can go to an onion dispenser to get another onion? The closest is (3,4) or (4,4). From (3,1), she can go:\n- To (3,2) blocked, so she must go via (2,1) or (4,1). Let's go to (4,1): \n  - Turn 62: R (move right to (4,1))\n  - Then to (4,2) blocked, so she must go up? But up from (4,1) is (4,2) blocked. So she has to go to (5,1) [if empty] -> then to (5,0) blocked? Not good.\n\nAlternatively, go left to (2,1) then up? (2,1) to (2,2) blocked. So she can go to (1,1) [if empty] -> then to (1,2) [empty] -> then to (1,3) [empty] -> then to (1,4) which is kitchen counter -> blocked. Or from (1,2) to (0,2) which is plate dispenser -> blocked.\n\nThis is not efficient.\n\nPerhaps after turn 61, Alice can go to (3,2) to see if there is an onion? But she cannot step on (3,2). She can stand at (3,1) and face up to (3,2) and interact to pick up if there is an onion. But we don't know if Bob placed one there.\n\nBut in the plan, we can try:\n\nAfter turn 61, Alice is at (3,1) empty.\n- Turn 62: U (change orientation to up to face (3,2))\n- Turn 63: I (interact to pick up any onion on (3,2))\n\nIf there is an onion (placed by Bob), then she gets it. Then:\n- Turn 64: D (face down)\n- Turn 65: I (put in pot) -> pot has 3, cooking starts.\n\nIf there isn't, then she does nothing? Then she can go to another onion source.\n\nBut to be safe, we can plan for the case where there is an onion at (3,2) (hoping Bob placed it).\n\nSo Alice's actions for the next 10 turns:\n\nTurn 54: D\nTurn 55: I\nTurn 56: L\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: I\nTurn 59: R\nTurn 60: D\nTurn 61: I\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: I   [if there's an onion at (3,2), she picks it up; otherwise, nothing]\nTurn 64: D\nTurn 65: I   [if she picked up an onion, she puts it in the pot; otherwise, nothing]\n\nThis will complete the first pot if the onion is there.\n\nThen, after that, she can help with the second pot or get a plate.\n\nBut since we are only planning for Alice and the horizon H is not specified, we can stop at turn 65 or continue.\n\nAlternatively, after the first two onions, if there's no onion at (3,2), she might go to (7,1) to get the onion there.\n\nBut let's stick to this plan for now.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice:\n\nTurn 54: D\nTurn 55: I\nTurn 56: L\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: I\nTurn 59: R\nTurn 60: D\nTurn 61: I\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: I\nTurn 64: D\nTurn 65: I\n\nThis is 12 actions.\n\nBut we started at turn 54 and go to turn 65 (which is 12 turns).\n\nWe can output this.\n\nNote: at turn 65, if everything goes well, the pot at (3,0) will have 3 onions and start cooking. Then at turn 70, it will be ready. Then Alice or Bob can get a plate and serve it.\n\nBut that is beyond the immediate plan.\n\nSo for now, we output Alice's actions from turn 54 to turn 65.\n\nBut the problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H=12.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: D\nTurn 55: I\nTurn 56: L\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: I\nTurn 59: R\nTurn 60: D\nTurn 61: I\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: I\nTurn 64: D\nTurn 65: I\n}\n\nThis is a plan for Alice to contribute to filling the first pot.\n\nIf we want to be more efficient, we could try to involve the other onions, but given the movement constraints, this seems reasonable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should focus on filling the pot at (3,0) with 3 onions as quickly as possible to start cooking a soup (reward: 20 after 5 turns of cooking). Alice currently holds an onion and is positioned at (3,1), adjacent to the pot. Bob is at (3,3) and can assist by fetching onions and placing them on the kitchen counter at (3,2) for Alice to use. The plan prioritizes using the onion Alice is holding and the onion on the kitchen counter at (2,2), while relying on Bob to supply additional onions to (3,2) for efficiency.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 54 to 65):\n- **Turn 54 (D)**: Change orientation to down (faces pot at (3,0)).\n- **Turn 55 (I)**: Interact to place held onion into pot at (3,0). Pot now has 1 onion.\n- **Turn 56 (L)**: Move left to (2,1) (empty tile).\n- **Turn 57 (U)**: Change orientation to up (faces kitchen counter at (2,2) with onion).\n- **Turn 58 (I)**: Interact to pick up onion from (2,2). Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 59 (R)**: Move right to (3,1) (empty tile).\n- **Turn 60 (D)**: Change orientation to down (faces pot at (3,0)).\n- **Turn 61 (I)**: Interact to place onion into pot. Pot now has 2 onions.\n- **Turn 62 (U)**: Change orientation to up (faces kitchen counter at (3,2)). (Assumes Bob has placed an onion here by now.)\n- **Turn 63 (I)**: Interact to pick up onion from (3,2) (placed by Bob). Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 64 (D)**: Change orientation to down (faces pot at (3,0)).\n- **Turn 65 (I)**: Interact to place onion into pot. Pot now has 3 onions, starting cooking (ready at turn 70).\n\n### Rationale:\n- **Coordination with Bob**: Bob should:\n  - Turn 54: Change orientation to up (faces onion dispenser at (3,4)).\n  - Turn 55: Interact to grab an onion.\n  - Turn 56: Change orientation to down (faces kitchen counter at (3,2)).\n  - Turn 57: Interact to place onion on (3,2).\n  - Repeat this to supply more onions for the second pot or additional soups.\n- **Efficiency**: Alice's path minimizes movement by leveraging nearby resources (pot at (3,0) and onion at (2,2)). Bob's role in placing onions at (3,2) ensures Alice can quickly access them without detours.\n- **Reward Maximization**: Filling the pot by turn 65 allows soup delivery by turn 70. With two pots, this plan enables parallel cooking if Bob fills the second pot (e.g., using onions from dispensers or counters).\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- By turn 65, the pot at (3,0) starts cooking (ready at turn 70). Alice can then help with the second pot (at (4,0)) or retrieve plates from (0,2) for serving. This sequence ensures at least one soup is delivered, with potential for more if Bob continues fetching onions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: D\nTurn 55: I\nTurn 56: L\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: I\nTurn 59: R\nTurn 60: D\nTurn 61: I\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: I\nTurn 64: D\nTurn 65: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes. The only recipe given is Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward: 20; cooking time: 5 turns. There are no tomato dispensers, so we can only make onion soup. Tomato dispensers are listed as none, and onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). Plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nCurrent game state at turn 57:\n\n- Alice (me): Position (3,1), orientation Down, holding nothing. Action history: R, L, U, I, D. So she moved right, left, up, interacted, down. Since she's at (3,1) facing down, and the tile below is (3,0), which is a pot. (3,0) is a pot, as per the tile types.\n\n- Bob: Position (4,3), orientation Right, holding one onion. Action history: R, L, U, I, R.\n\nNon-empty kitchen counters:\n\n- (2,2): onion\n\n- (6,4): onion\n\n- (7,1): onion\n\n- (5,4): onion\n\n- (3,2): onion\n\nAll pots are empty. Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nThe goal is to make onion soup since that's the only recipe. Soup requires 3 onions in a pot, then it cooks for 5 turns, then someone needs to serve it with a plate to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nAlice is at (3,1) facing down, which is towards (3,0), a pot. But the pot is empty, and she's holding nothing, so she can't interact with it yet.\n\nBob is at (4,3) holding an onion. He's facing right, so towards (5,3). What's at (5,3)? The grid isn't fully specified, but from the tile types, we know the positions of counters, dispensers, etc. Let me sketch a quick grid based on the tile types.\n\nList all tiles:\n\n- Kitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\n- Empty tiles: probably all other tiles not listed, but players can only walk on empty tiles or interact with adjacent objects.\n\nPlayers can only be on empty tiles, I think. The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and \"Interact with a non-empty tile if standing on an empty tile adjacent and facing it.\"\n\nSo, for example, Alice at (3,1), which might be an empty tile since not listed in non-empty types. Similarly, Bob at (4,3), likely empty.\n\nNow, Alice is at (3,1) facing down to (3,0), which is a pot. But pot is empty, she has nothing, so interact might do nothing? Or she could add ingredient if she had one, but she doesn't.\n\nBob has an onion and is at (4,3) facing right to (5,3). (5,3) is not listed, so probably an empty tile or something. But he could interact with something if he faces it.\n\nHe's holding an onion, so he might want to put it in a pot or on a counter.\n\nThere are multiple onions on counters already: at (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2). All have onions.\n\n(3,2) is a kitchen counter with onion, and Alice is at (3,1), which is above it. (3,1) to (3,2) is south, but Alice is facing down, which is south, so (3,0) is south of her, (3,2) is south? No.\n\nCoordinates: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Typically in grids, (0,0) might be bottom-left or top-left. In the tile list, (0,0) is kitchen counter, (0,1) is kitchen counter, (0,2) is plate dispenser, (0,3) kitchen counter, (0,4) kitchen counter. Similarly, y increases up or down?\n\nIn the move actions: L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y), U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1). So U increases y, D decreases y, so y=0 is bottom, y=4 is top? For example, onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), which is top row.\n\nServing counter at (7,2), which is right side.\n\nAlice at (3,1), orientation D (down, so decreasing y). So (3,1) to (3,0) is down.\n\n(3,2) is at y=2, which is above y=1? Since U is y+1, so y=1 to y=2 is up, so (3,2) is north of (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is Bob, y=3.\n\nNow, Alice at (3,1) facing down (south) to (3,0), which is a pot.\n\nIf she wants to interact with (3,2), which is north, she needs to face up.\n\nBut (3,2) has an onion on the counter, and she's holding nothing, so she could pick it up if she faces it.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (4,3) holding onion, facing right (east) to (5,3). What is at (5,3)? Not listed, so probably empty tile. He could move or interact with something else.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0), both empty.\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nTo make soup, we need to put 3 onions in a pot. Cooking takes 5 turns, then serve with plate.\n\nThere are onions on counters that can be used, and onion dispensers if needed.\n\nBut we have onions on counters: (2,2), (3,2), (5,4), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4) is listed twice? No: kitchen counters with onion: (2,2), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2). So five onions on counters.\n\n(5,4) and (6,4) are both listed, but (5,4) is kitchen counter with onion, (6,4) also.\n\nBob has one onion already.\n\nSo we have at least 6 onions available: 5 on counters + Bob holding one.\n\nWe can make two soups, since each requires 3 onions.\n\nBut pots are empty now, so we can start cooking.\n\nFirst, we need to get onions into pots.\n\nAlice is near pot at (3,0), and there's an onion on (3,2) counter above her.\n\nShe could pick up that onion and put it in the pot.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can put his onion in a pot.\n\nBut he's at (4,3), which is not near pots; pots are at y=0.\n\nHe needs to go down.\n\nAlso, after putting onions, we need to serve, which requires plates.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nNow, action plan for Alice starting from turn 57.\n\nI need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice, and optionally for Bob, but the task says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but in the answer format, it seems only Alice's actions are listed? Let me check.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice\"\n\nAnd answer format: Turn t: a_t for Alice, I think.\n\nIt says: \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but in the answer, it might be only Alice, or both? The format shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" which is probably Alice's action.\n\nBut to coordinate, I might need to assume Bob's actions too, but I think for the plan, I should output Alice's actions, and suggest what Bob should do, but the output is only Alice's actions.\n\nRe-reading: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice\" and the answer format is for Alice.\n\nBut to maximize reward, coordination is key, so I need to consider what Bob is likely to do based on his state.\n\nThe task says: \"optimize coordination, planning, and decision-making based on current game state and action history of both players.\"\n\nBut for the output, I think I only provide Alice's actions.\n\nPerhaps I should plan assuming Bob will cooperate or something.\n\nFrom action history, Bob just took R (right) at last action, and he's at (4,3) facing right, holding onion.\n\nHe might be heading to a pot or to deposit onion.\n\nSimilarly, Alice action history: D (down), and she's at (3,1) facing down, so she just moved down to (3,1) and is facing the pot at (3,0).\n\nShe could interact to add something, but she has nothing, so interact might do nothing? Or if the pot is empty, interact with empty pot does nothing, I assume.\n\nThen she needs to get an item.\n\nThere's an onion on (3,2), which is directly north of her at (3,1).\n\nSince she is at (3,1), and (3,2) is adjacent north, but she is facing down, so to interact with (3,2), she needs to face up.\n\nThen she can pick up the onion from the counter.\n\nAfter that, she can turn down and interact to put it in the pot.\n\nBut she is at (3,1), pot at (3,0), so to interact with pot, she needs to be adjacent and facing it. Since she is at (3,1), which is adjacent to (3,0) (south), and facing down, she can interact.\n\nSimilarly for (3,2) north.\n\nSo possible actions for Alice:\n\n- Turn up to face (3,2), then interact to pick up onion.\n\n- Or move, but she can stay and change orientation.\n\nActions: she can move or change orientation or interact or stay.\n\nIf she changes orientation to up, she can then interact with (3,2) to pick up onion.\n\nThen, she can change orientation to down to face the pot, and interact to add onion.\n\nBut the pot is empty, so adding one onion starts the process, but it needs three.\n\nWith multiple onions available, she might need to do this multiple times or coordinate with Bob.\n\nBob has an onion and is at (4,3).\n\n(4,3) to pots: (3,0) or (4,0) are at y=0, so he needs to go down.\n\nHe could go to (4,2) or something.\n\n(4,2) is a kitchen counter, but it might be empty? Non-empty counters listed are only specific ones, so (4,2) might be empty or have nothing, but it's a kitchen counter tile, which can hold items.\n\nIn non-empty, (4,2) is not listed, so probably empty kitchen counter.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) has onion, etc.\n\nBob could move down to (4,2), then to (4,1), etc., to reach a pot.\n\nSince he has an onion, he might want to put it in a pot directly or on a counter near pot.\n\nBut there are counters with onions already.\n\nTo start cooking, we should fill a pot as soon as possible.\n\nAlice is near pot (3,0) and onion at (3,2).\n\nShe can quickly get that onion and put it in the pot.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can bring his onion to the other pot or same pot.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0), adjacent.\n\n(3,0) and (4,0) are both pots.\n\nAlice can handle (3,0) pot.\n\nFirst, Alice actions:\n\nAt turn 57, she is at (3,1), facing down, holding nothing.\n\nOption 1: Interact. But with what? She is facing (3,0), which is an empty pot. If she interacts, since she has nothing, and pot is empty, probably nothing happens. Or maybe she can't interact? The interact action requires her to have an item to add or plate to serve, but pot is empty, so no soup to serve, and she has no item, so interact might be invalid or do nothing. I think it's safe to assume interact does nothing in this case.\n\nSo better to change orientation or move.\n\nTo pick up onion from (3,2), she needs to face up.\n\nSo action at turn 57: change orientation to Up (U), so now facing north.\n\nThen, at turn 58, she can interact (I) to pick up onion from (3,2) counter.\n\nNow she is holding an onion.\n\nThen, at turn 59, she can change orientation to Down (D) to face south towards pot (3,0).\n\nThen at turn 60, interact (I) to add onion to pot.\n\nNow pot (3,0) has one onion.\n\nBut we need three.\n\nThere are other onions: for example, on (2,2), or Bob can bring his.\n\nBut Alice is holding nothing after adding, so she can get another onion.\n\n(3,2) had an onion, but she just picked it up, so now (3,2) is empty, I assume.\n\nCounters can be used for storage, but when she picks up, it becomes empty.\n\nNow, to get another onion, she could go to another counter or to dispenser.\n\nNearest onion might be on (2,2) or (4,2), but (4,2) might be empty.\n\n(2,2) has an onion, as per state.\n\n(2,2) is at x=2,y=2, Alice at (3,1).\n\nTo reach (2,2), she needs to go left and up.\n\nFrom (3,1), move left to (2,1)? (2,1) what is it? Not listed, probably empty tile.\n\nThen from (2,1), she can face up to (2,2) and interact.\n\nBut (2,2) is kitchen counter with onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can bring his onion to the pot.\n\nSince Bob has an onion, and he is at (4,3), he can move down to (4,2), then to (4,1), then to (4,0) or (3,0) or (5,0), but (5,0) is kitchen counter, not pot.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nSo Bob can go directly to (4,0) to add his onion.\n\nBut he needs to be adjacent and facing.\n\nHe is at (4,3), facing right.\n\nFirst, he needs to change orientation or move down.\n\nAssuming Bob will cooperate, I should consider his actions for coordination.\n\nBut I only plan Alice's actions, so for Alice, after adding one onion to pot, she can get another onion to add.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), after adding onion at turn 60, she is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can move left to (2,1) at turn 61.\n\nThen at (2,1), she needs to face up to (2,2) to interact.\n\nSo turn 62, change orientation to Up (U) if not facing, but she just moved left, orientation might be left? When moving, orientation changes to the direction moved.\n\nImportant: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\"\n\nSo if she moves left, she goes to (x-1,y) and faces left.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nIn her action history, she has moves and interacts.\n\nAt turn 57, she is at (3,1) facing down.\n\nIf she changes orientation to U, she stays at (3,1) but faces up.\n\nThen interact to pick up from (3,2).\n\nThen change orientation to D (down) to face pot.\n\nInteract to add.\n\nNow at (3,1) facing down, holding nothing.\n\nNext, to get to (2,2), which has onion.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), she at (3,1).\n\nShe can move left to (2,1). When she moves left, she goes to (2,1) and faces left.\n\n(2,1) is adjacent to (2,2) north? (2,2) is at y=2, (2,1) at y=1, so (2,2) is north of (2,1).\n\nSince she moved left to (2,1), she is facing left (west).\n\nTo interact with (2,2), which is north, she needs to face up.\n\nSo at (2,1), she can change orientation to Up (U) to face north.\n\nThen interact to pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nThen she has onion, and can go to a pot to add it.\n\nBut which pot? (3,0) is near, but she is at (2,1), which is adjacent to (2,0)? (2,0) is a kitchen counter, not a pot.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move right to (3,1), and when moving right, she faces right (east).\n\nAt (3,1), she can face down to (3,0) and interact to add onion.\n\nBut (3,0) already has one onion, adding second.\n\nThen similarly for third.\n\nBut this takes many turns.\n\nBob can add his onion to the same pot or different.\n\nSince there are two pots, we can use both.\n\nBut cooking time is 5 turns, so if we start one pot earlier, it can be cooking while we prepare the second.\n\nCurrently at turn 57, Alice can start by adding an onion to (3,0) quickly.\n\nThen Bob can add his to (4,0) or same.\n\nLet's estimate turns.\n\nFirst, for Alice:\n\nTurn 57: Change orientation to Up (U) to face (3,2)\n\nTurn 58: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (3,2)\n\nTurn 59: Change orientation to Down (D) to face (3,0)\n\nTurn 60: Interact (I) to add onion to pot (3,0). Now pot has one onion.\n\nAlice at (3,1), holding nothing.\n\nNow, to get another onion, she can go to (2,2).\n\nTurn 61: Move Left (L) to (2,1), now at (2,1) facing left.\n\nTurn 62: Change orientation to Up (U) to face north towards (2,2)\n\nTurn 63: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nNeed to add to pot. (2,0) is kitchen counter, not pot. Nearest pot is (3,0) at (3,0).\n\nFrom (2,1), move right to (3,1) at turn 64. When moving right, she goes to (3,1) facing right.\n\nThen at (3,1), she needs to face down to interact with (3,0).\n\nTurn 65: Change orientation to Down (D) to face south.\n\nTurn 66: Interact (I) to add onion to pot (3,0). Now pot has two onions.\n\nAlice holding nothing.\n\nNeed third onion. Where to get? (3,2) is empty, (2,2) she just emptied. Other onions at (5,4), (6,4), etc., far away.\n\n(7,1) has onion, but that's far.\n\nOr (5,4), etc.\n\nBob has an onion and can add it.\n\nBut let's see Bob's position.\n\nBob at (4,3), holding onion, facing right.\n\nHe can move down to add to pot.\n\nFor example, he can move down to (4,2) at some turn.\n\nBut we need to coordinate.\n\nSince Alice is near, she can get onion from another counter, but the closest might be (3,2) but empty, or (4,2) which might be empty.\n\n(4,2) is a kitchen counter, not listed in non-empty, so probably empty.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is kitchen counter, not listed, empty.\n\nSo onions are at (5,4), (6,4), (7,1), (5,4) is listed, but (5,4) is at (5,4), which is top-right.\n\n(6,4) also.\n\n(7,1) is bottom-right.\n\nAll far from Alice.\n\nBob is at (4,3) with onion, he can add to (4,0) pot quickly.\n\nFor example, Bob can move down to (4,2) at turn t, then to (4,1), then to (4,0)? (4,0) is a pot, but can he stand on it? Pots are non-empty tiles, so players cannot walk onto them. Only adjacent to interact.\n\nSo from (4,1), he can face down and interact to add to pot (4,0).\n\nSimilarly for (3,0) from (3,1).\n\nSo for Bob, from (4,3) facing right.\n\nHe needs to go down.\n\nFirst, change orientation to down or move down.\n\nMove down: from (4,3) move down to (4,2), now at (4,2) facing down.\n\nThen move down to (4,1), at (4,1) facing down.\n\nThen at (4,1), facing down, he can interact with (4,0) to add onion if he is holding one.\n\nHe is holding onion.\n\nSo in three moves: down to (4,2), down to (4,1), then interact with (4,0).\n\nBut at (4,1), he is adjacent to (4,0) and facing it, so interact should work.\n\nNow, for Alice, after adding second onion to (3,0), she can let Bob add the third or get it herself.\n\nBut Bob can add to (4,0) instead, starting another pot.\n\nThen we have two pots with one onion each, need to add more.\n\nBut onions are available.\n\nAlice can go to a dispenser or to another counter.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, she can pick one.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) after turn 66, she is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nNearest onion might be (7,1) or (5,4), but (7,1) is at (7,1), which is far.\n\n(3,2) is empty, (2,2) empty, (5,2) might be empty.\n\nCounters with onions: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), and (3,2) and (2,2) are now empty after Alice took them.\n\nIn the state, (3,2) had onion, she took it at turn 58, so empty.\n\n(2,2) she took at turn 63, empty.\n\nOther onions: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is onion, (6,4) is onion, (7,1) is onion.\n\n(5,4) and (6,4) are both at y=4, top row.\n\n(7,1) at bottom.\n\nAlice at (3,1), so (7,1) is closer? (7,1) is at x=7,y=1, Alice at x=3,y=1, so same y, distance 4 in x.\n\nTo (5,4), x=5,y=4, difference |5-3|=2, |4-1|=3, total 5, but with obstacles.\n\nPath: from (3,1) to (7,1) can be all right moves if no obstacles.\n\nTiles: (4,1) what is it? Not listed, probably empty.\n\n(5,1) not listed, empty.\n\n(6,1) not listed, empty.\n\n(7,1) is kitchen counter with onion.\n\nBut (7,1) is a counter, so Alice can stand on adjacent empty tile and interact.\n\nFor example, (6,1) or (7,2) or (7,0), but (7,0) is kitchen counter, not empty.\n\n(7,2) is serving counter.\n\nAdjacent empty tiles to (7,1): (6,1), (7,0) is counter, not empty, so only (6,1) west or (7,2) north, but (7,2) is serving counter, not empty tile? Serving counter is non-empty, so players cannot stand on it.\n\nEmpty tiles are walkable, non-empty are not.\n\nSo to interact with (7,1), Alice needs to be on an adjacent empty tile and facing it.\n\nAdjacent positions: north (7,2) is serving counter, not empty; south (7,0) is kitchen counter, not empty; east? x=8 not exist; west (6,1).\n\nSo only (6,1) is adjacent empty tile to (7,1).\n\nSimilarly, for (5,4), at (5,4), adjacent empty tiles might be (5,3), (4,4), (6,4), etc., but (4,4) is onion dispenser, not empty, (6,4) is kitchen counter with onion, not empty.\n\n(5,4) is kitchen counter, so players cannot stand on it.\n\nAdjacent tiles: north (5,5) not exist; south (5,3); east (6,4) kitchen counter; west (4,4) onion dispenser; so only (5,3) south is empty tile, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for other counters.\n\nBack to Alice.\n\nAfter adding second onion to (3,0) at turn 66, she is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can go to (7,1) to get that onion.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,1): move right three times: to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n\nAt (6,1), she needs to face east to interact with (7,1), since (7,1) is east of (6,1).\n\n(6,1) to (7,1) is east, so face right.\n\nThen interact to pick up onion.\n\nThen she has onion, and can go to a pot to add it.\n\nBut to which pot? (3,0) has two onions, so she can add there for the third.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (3,1) is three left moves, then at (3,1) face down and interact.\n\nBut that takes many turns.\n\nShe could add to (4,0) if it's closer, but (4,0) is at (4,0), from (6,1) she can go to (4,1) then down or something.\n\nBut (4,0) is pot, from (4,1) she can interact if facing down.\n\nBut she is at (6,1), so first move to (4,1) or directly.\n\nPath to (3,0) or (4,0).\n\nSince (3,0) has two, better to complete that.\n\nBut let's see time.\n\nFirst, Bob can add his onion to (3,0) for the third.\n\nBob is at (4,3) with onion, he can go to (3,1) or something to add to (3,0).\n\nBut (3,1) is occupied by Alice? No, Alice is moving.\n\nAt turn 57, Alice is at (3,1), Bob at (4,3).\n\nIf Alice moves away, Bob can come.\n\nBut let's sequence actions.\n\nI am planning only Alice's actions, so I need to output for Alice.\n\nAlso, cooking time: once three onions are in, cooking starts and takes 5 turns.\n\nThen serve with plate.\n\nPlates from (0,2).\n\nServing at (7,2).\n\nSo after cooking, someone needs to get plate, pick up soup, and deliver.\n\nFor now, let's focus on filling the pot.\n\nTo save turns, Alice can let Bob add the third onion while she starts another action.\n\nBut for Alice's plan, she should be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: Alice, after adding first onion to (3,0) at turn 60, instead of going to (2,2), she can stay and Bob adds his onion to the same pot.\n\nBut Bob needs to come.\n\nAt turn 57, Bob is at (4,3) with onion.\n\nHe can move down to add to (4,0) or to (3,0).\n\nTo (3,0), he needs to be at (3,1) or (2,0) or (4,0), but (2,0) is counter, not empty, (4,0) is pot.\n\nTo interact with (3,0), he needs to be at (3,1), (2,0), (4,0), or (3,-1) not exist.\n\n(2,0) is kitchen counter, not empty, so players cannot stand there.\n\n(4,0) is pot, not empty.\n\n(3,1) is the only adjacent empty tile to (3,0), similarly for (4,0), (4,1) is adjacent.\n\nSo for (3,0), only (3,1) can be used to interact.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0), only (4,1).\n\nSo Alice is at (3,1), so for Bob to add to (3,0), he needs to be at (3,1), but it's occupied by Alice.\n\nPlayers cannot walk through each other, so if Alice is at (3,1), Bob cannot go there.\n\nAlice needs to move away for Bob to access.\n\nBut if she moves, she can let Bob add.\n\nFor example, after Alice adds first onion at turn 60, she can move to let Bob add.\n\nBut at that point, Bob might not be there.\n\nLet's assume Bob is moving towards the pot.\n\nFrom Bob's action history: R,L,U,I,R. Last action R (right) at turn 56 or something, but turn 57 is current, action history is previous actions.\n\nGame turn 57, action history is for the past few turns.\n\nFor Alice, actions: R,L,U,I,D – so at turn 56, she did D (down) to (3,1) and facing down.\n\nFor Bob, R,L,U,I,R – last action R, so at turn 56, he moved right or changed orientation? Action history: \"R, L, U, I, R\" with most recent last, so at turn 56, he did R (right), so he was at some position and moved right to (4,3), facing right.\n\nHe might be heading to the right, perhaps to (5,3) or to a counter.\n\nBut he has an onion, so he might want to deposit it.\n\nHe could be going to (5,4) which has onion, but he has one, so he might place it or something.\n\n(5,4) has onion on counter, he can interact to place or pick up, but he has onion, so he can place it on an empty counter.\n\nBut he might be going to a pot.\n\nTo optimize, let's have Alice fill one pot quickly with the nearby onions.\n\nFirst, for (3,0) pot:\n\n- Alice adds one onion from (3,2) as above.\n\n- Then, she can add another from (2,2), but it takes time.\n\nThere is onion on (3,2), she can take it, but (3,2) is north, she can take it first.\n\nThen for the second, (2,2) is close.\n\nBut after adding two, Bob can add the third from his position.\n\nBob with onion can go to (3,1) to add, but Alice is there.\n\nSo Alice, after adding the second onion, can move away to let Bob in.\n\nFor example, after adding second onion at turn 66, she is at (3,1), she can move right to (4,1) at turn 67.\n\nThen at (4,1), she can face down to interact with (4,0) if she has something, but she has nothing.\n\nOr she can go to get another item.\n\nAt (4,1), she is not holding anything, so she can do something else.\n\nThen Bob can move to (3,1) and add his onion to (3,0).\n\nBut Bob needs to be at (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down to (4,2), then left to (3,2), but (3,2) is counter? (3,2) is kitchen counter, not empty, so he cannot stand on it.\n\nTo go to (3,1), from (4,3), move down to (4,2), then down to (4,1), then left to (3,1).\n\nAt (4,1), if Alice is there, he cannot move to (3,1) if occupied.\n\nPlayers cannot occupy the same tile.\n\nSo coordination is needed.\n\nTo avoid conflict, Alice can work on one pot, Bob on another.\n\nFor example, Alice handles (3,0) pot, Bob handles (4,0) pot.\n\nAlice at (3,1) can add onions to (3,0).\n\nBob at (4,3) can add his onion to (4,0).\n\nFirst, for Bob to add to (4,0): he needs to be at (4,1) facing down.\n\nFrom (4,3) facing right, he can move down to (4,2) (turn, say, 57 for Bob, but we don't control).\n\nFor Alice, she can focus on filling (3,0).\n\nWith onions on (3,2) and (2,2), she can add two onions quickly.\n\nThen for the third, she can get from elsewhere or Bob can add to (4,0) and start cooking there.\n\nThen Alice can get the third for (3,0) later.\n\nBut let's calculate the sequence for Alice only.\n\nAlice actions:\n\nTurn 57: Change orientation to Up (U) to face (3,2)\n\nTurn 58: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (3,2)\n\nTurn 59: Change orientation to Down (D) to face (3,0)\n\nTurn 60: Interact (I) to add onion to pot (3,0). Pot now has 1 onion.\n\nAlice at (3,1), holding nothing.\n\nTurn 61: Move Left (L) to (2,1), now at (2,1) facing left.\n\nTurn 62: Change orientation to Up (U) to face (2,2)\n\nTurn 63: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nNow holding onion, at (2,1) facing up.\n\nNeed to add to pot (3,0).\n\nTurn 64: Move Right (R) to (3,1), now at (3,1) facing right.\n\nTurn 65: Change orientation to Down (D) to face (3,0)\n\nTurn 66: Interact (I) to add onion to pot (3,0). Pot now has 2 onions.\n\nAlice at (3,1), holding nothing.\n\nNow for third onion, she can go to (7,1) or other.\n\nBut (7,1) is far.\n\nShe can go to onion dispenser at (3,4) or (4,4) to get a new onion.\n\n(3,4) is above, at y=4.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,4): move up three times.\n\nBut (3,2) is a counter, not empty, so she cannot move to (3,2). Players can only move to empty tiles.\n\nFrom (3,1), move up to (3,2)? (3,2) is kitchen counter, non-empty, so she cannot walk onto it. She can only be on empty tiles.\n\nSo to go up, she needs to go around or to other empty tiles.\n\nFor example, to reach (3,4), she can go to (4,1), then (4,2), but (4,2) is kitchen counter, not empty.\n\nList empty tiles or walkable path.\n\nThe grid: rows y=0 to y=4, x=0 to 7.\n\ny=0: x=0,1,2,5,6,7 kitchen counters; x=3,4 pots; so empty at x=4? x=3 and4 are pots, so not empty. y=0: tiles (0,0) counter, (1,0) counter, (2,0) counter, (3,0) pot, (4,0) pot, (5,0) counter, (6,0) counter, (7,0) counter. So no empty tiles at y=0.\n\ny=1: (0,1) counter, (1,1)? not listed, probably empty, (2,1)? not listed, empty, (3,1) Alice, but empty tile, (4,1) not listed, empty, (5,1) not listed, empty, (6,1) not listed, empty, (7,1) counter. So empty tiles at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n\ny=2: (0,2) plate dispenser, (1,2)? not listed, probably empty, (2,2) counter, (3,2) counter, (4,2) counter, (5,2) counter, (6,2)? not listed, empty, (7,2) serving counter. So empty tiles at (1,2), (6,2), and possibly (7,2) but serving counter, not empty.\n\n(7,2) serving counter, non-empty, so not walkable.\n\nSo at y=2, empty tiles: (1,2), (6,2)\n\ny=3: (0,3) counter, (1,3)? not listed, empty, (2,3)? not listed, empty, (3,3)? not listed, empty, (4,3) Bob, empty, (5,3)? not listed, empty, (6,3)? not listed, empty, (7,3) counter. So empty tiles at (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\ny=4: (0,4) counter, (1,4) counter, (2,4) counter, (3,4) onion dispenser, (4,4) onion dispenser, (5,4) counter with onion, (6,4) counter with onion, (7,4) counter. So no empty tiles at y=4, all non-empty.\n\nTo get to onion dispenser at (3,4), Alice needs to be on adjacent empty tile and facing it.\n\nAdjacent to (3,4): south (3,3) is empty tile.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4), adjacent south (4,3) but Bob is there, or (3,4) west, or (5,4) east, but (5,4) counter, not empty, so for (4,4), adjacent south (4,3) is empty.\n\nBut Bob is at (4,3), so occupied.\n\nAlice can go to (3,3) to interact with (3,4) dispenser.\n\n(3,3) is empty.\n\nFrom Alice position at (3,1) after turn 66.\n\nShe can move up to (3,2)? But (3,2) is counter, not empty, cannot move there.\n\nSo she needs to go around.\n\nFrom (3,1), move right to (4,1) (empty), then move up to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter, not empty, cannot move there.\n\n(4,2) is counter, so not walkable.\n\nFrom (4,1), she can move up? (4,1) to (4,2) not possible.\n\nOnly to (4,0) but pot, not empty, or (3,1) occupied, or (5,1), or (4,1) to (4,0) not, to (4,2) not, so only left/right/up/down to empty tiles.\n\nFrom (4,1), adjacent: north (4,2) counter, not empty; south (4,0) pot, not empty; east (5,1) empty; west (3,1) may be occupied.\n\nAt turn 67, she is at (3,1), if she moves right to (4,1), then at (4,1), she can move east to (5,1), or west back, or north not, south not.\n\nSo to (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,1), she can move up to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter, not empty, cannot.\n\nMove to (5,0) counter, not.\n\nSo only left/right on y=1, or down not, up not.\n\nFrom (5,1), she can move east to (6,1), or west to (4,1).\n\nTo reach higher y, she needs to go to where there are empty tiles at y=2 or3.\n\nFor example, at y=2, (1,2) and (6,2) are empty.\n\nFrom (6,1), she can move up to (6,2) since (6,2) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,1) to (1,2).\n\nBut Alice is at (3,1), so she can move to (6,1) then to (6,2).\n\nFrom (6,2), she can go to y=3.\n\n(6,2) to (6,3) move up, (6,3) empty.\n\nThen to (6,4)? (6,4) counter, not empty.\n\nOr to (5,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (3,3) to access dispenser (3,4).\n\nFrom Alice at (3,1), she can move right to (4,1), then to (5,1), then to (6,1), then to (6,2) (move up), then to (6,3) (move up), then to (5,3) (move left), then to (4,3)? But (4,3) has Bob, may be occupied, then to (3,3) (move left).\n\nAt (3,3), she can face north to interact with (3,4) dispenser to grab onion.\n\nThis is many moves.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,3) directly not possible because (3,2) blocked.\n\nSo path: (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) if empty, but Bob there, or (3,3) if she can go left from (4,3), but (4,3) occupied.\n\nSo she can go to (5,3) then to (4,3) only if empty, but Bob is there, so she can go to (3,3) from (4,3) not, so from (5,3) move left to (4,3) if empty, else not.\n\nBut at turn 67, Bob is at (4,3), so (4,3) occupied.\n\nShe can go to (2,3) or something.\n\nFrom (6,3), she can move left to (5,3), then to (4,3) not possible, so to (3,3) directly from (4,3) not, (3,3) is west of (4,3), but from (5,3), she can move left to (4,3) if empty, or to (3,3) not adjacent.\n\n(5,3) to (4,3) is west, (4,3) to (3,3) is west.\n\nSo she needs to go to (4,3) first, but occupied.\n\nSo at this point, she cannot reach (3,3) because (4,3) is occupied by Bob.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) dispenser adjacent to (4,3), occupied.\n\nSo she cannot access the dispensers easily with Bob there.\n\nBetter to use the onions on counters.\n\nFor example, (7,1) has onion.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move right to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1).\n\nAt (6,1), she can face east to interact with (7,1) counter to pick up onion.\n\nThen she has onion.\n\nThen she can go back to (3,1) to add to pot.\n\nBut (3,0) has 2 onions, so she can add the third.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (3,1): move left to (5,1), (4,1), (3,1).\n\nThen at (3,1) face down and interact.\n\nBut this takes turns.\n\nSince (4,0) is empty, she could add to (4,0) from (4,1) or (3,1), but (3,1) is adjacent to (4,0)? (3,1) to (4,0) is not adjacent; adjacent are (3,0) south, (2,1) west, (4,1) east, (3,2) north, all not (4,0).\n\n(4,0) is adjacent to (4,1) north, (3,0) west, (5,0) east.\n\n(5,0) is kitchen counter, not empty, so only (4,1) can be used.\n\nFrom Alice at (6,1), she can go to (4,1) to add to (4,0) if she has onion.\n\nBut she has onion from (7,1), so she can add to (4,0) instead.\n\nBut (4,0) is empty, so she can start a new pot.\n\nThen (3,0) has 2, needs one more.\n\nBob can add his to (3,0).\n\nBut let's define Alice's actions.\n\nTo save time, after adding second onion to (3,0) at turn 66, she can go to (7,1) to get onion for the third.\n\nTurn 67: Move Right (R) to (4,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 68: Move Right (R) to (5,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 69: Move Right (R) to (6,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 70: Change orientation to East? She is facing right, which is east, and (7,1) is east, so she can interact.\n\nAt (6,1), facing east, (7,1) is east, so interact.\n\nTurn 70: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (7,1) counter.\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen she can go to (3,1) to add to (3,0) pot.\n\nTurn 71: Move Left (L) to (5,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 72: Move Left (L) to (4,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 73: Move Left (L) to (3,1), facing left.\n\nNow at (3,1) facing left, but to interact with (3,0) south, she needs to face down.\n\nTurn 74: Change orientation to Down (D) to face south.\n\nTurn 75: Interact (I) to add onion to pot (3,0). Now pot has 3 onions, cooking starts.\n\nCooking starts at turn 75, takes 5 turns, so ready at turn 80.\n\nThen it can be served.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), holding nothing.\n\nNow, to serve, she needs a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nShe can go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nBut (0,2) is plate dispenser, she needs to be adjacent and facing to grab plate.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (0,2): west not, east (1,2) empty, north (0,3) counter, south (0,1) counter, so only (1,2) can be used.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (1,2): first to (2,1), then to (1,1), then to (1,2)? (1,2) is at y=2, (1,1) at y=1.\n\nFrom (3,1) move left to (2,1), facing left.\n\nThen from (2,1) move left to (1,1), facing left.\n\nThen from (1,1) move up to (1,2)? (1,2) is empty, so move up to (1,2), facing up.\n\nAt (1,2), she can face west to interact with (0,2) dispenser.\n\n(0,2) is west of (1,2), so face left.\n\nThen interact to grab plate.\n\nThen she has clean plate.\n\nThen she needs to pick up the cooked soup from the pot.\n\nPot at (3,0), she at (1,2), far.\n\nShe can go back to (3,1).\n\nFrom (1,2) move down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then right to (3,1).\n\nAt (3,1) face down and interact with pot to serve soup, if cooked.\n\nBut cooking started at turn 75, ready at turn 80.\n\nAt turn 75, she is at (3,1), after adding.\n\nThen she can start going for plate immediately.\n\nTurn 76: Move Left (L) to (2,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 77: Move Left (L) to (1,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 78: Move Up (U) to (1,2), facing up.\n\nTurn 79: Change orientation to Left (L) to face west towards (0,2)\n\nTurn 80: Interact (I) to grab plate from dispenser. Now holding plate.\n\nCooking finishes at turn 80, so soup is ready.\n\nThen she needs to pick up soup.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,1): move down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then right to (3,1).\n\nTurn 81: Move Down (D) to (1,1), facing down.\n\nTurn 82: Move Right (R) to (2,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 83: Move Right (R) to (3,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 84: Change orientation to Down (D) to face south to (3,0)\n\nTurn 85: Interact (I) to serve soup from pot. Since she has plate and pot has cooked soup, she picks up the soup on plate.\n\nNow holding soup on plate.\n\nThen deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,2): move right to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then to (6,2) or directly.\n\n(7,2) is serving counter, adjacent empty tile is (6,2) or (7,1) or (7,3), but (7,1) counter, (7,3) counter, so only (6,2) west.\n\nSo to (6,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) move right to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then up to (6,2).\n\nAt (6,2) face east to (7,2) and interact to deliver.\n\nTurn 86: Move Right (R) to (4,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 87: Move Right (R) to (5,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 88: Move Right (R) to (6,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 89: Move Up (U) to (6,2), facing up.\n\nTurn 90: Change orientation to Right (R) to face east to (7,2)\n\nTurn 91: Interact (I) to deliver soup for reward.\n\nThis is many turns, and we have only one soup.\n\nBut Bob can be doing things.\n\nFor example, Bob can fill the other pot.\n\nAt turn 57, Bob has onion, he can go to (4,0) to add it.\n\nFrom (4,3) move down to (4,2) not possible, (4,2) counter, so move down to (4,2) not, so he needs to go to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3) move down to (4,2) not possible, so move to adjacent empty.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down to (4,2) not, so only left/right/up/down to empty tiles.\n\nAt (4,3), adjacent: north (4,4) dispenser, not empty; south (4,2) counter, not empty; east (5,3) empty; west (3,3) empty.\n\nSo he can move west to (3,3) or east to (5,3).\n\nThen from there, to go down, he can go to (3,2) not, or (5,2) not, so to y=1.\n\nFor example, move west to (3,3), then down to (3,2) not possible, so move to (2,3) or (3,3) to (2,3) left, then to (2,2) not, etc.\n\nIt's messy.\n\nFrom (4,3), move south not possible, so he can move down by going to (5,3), then to (5,2) not, so to (5,1) via (6,3) or something.\n\nComplicated.\n\nPerhaps for this plan, Alice can focus on one soup, but it takes about 35 turns for one soup, from turn 57 to 91, 34 turns, and reward 20.\n\nBut we can do better with coordination.\n\nSince there are many onions, Alice can let Bob handle one pot while she handles another.\n\nBut for Alice's actions, let's make a shorter plan.\n\nAt turn 57, Alice is at (3,1) facing down, she can interact, but does nothing, so better to change orientation to up to pick up onion from (3,2).\n\nThen add to pot.\n\nBut for the third onion, since Bob has one, she can move away after adding second, so Bob can add his.\n\nFor example:\n\nAlice turn 57: U (change orientation to up)\n\nTurn 58: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n\nTurn 59: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 60: I (add onion to (3,0), pot has 1)\n\nTurn 61: L (move left to (2,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 62: U (change orientation to up)\n\nTurn 63: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nTurn 64: R (move right to (3,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 65: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 66: I (add onion to (3,0), pot has 2)\n\nNow at turn 66, pot has 2 onions, Alice at (3,1) facing down, holding nothing.\n\nShe can move away to let Bob add the third.\n\nFor example, move right to (4,1) at turn 67.\n\nThen at (4,1), she can face down to interact with (4,0) but she has nothing, so do nothing or wait.\n\nBut Bob can move to (3,1) to add his onion.\n\nBob at (4,3) with onion.\n\nIf he moves down, but (4,2) blocked, so he can move to (3,3), then to (3,2) not, to (2,3), etc., or to (5,3), then to (5,2) not, to (6,3), then to (6,2), then to (6,1), then to (5,1), etc. to (4,1), but Alice is there.\n\nIt's difficult.\n\nPerhaps for this response, I'll output Alice's actions for the first few turns to start cooking, and assume Bob will help.\n\nBut the task is to plan for Alice.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can go for a plate while the soup is cooking.\n\nAfter adding the second onion at turn 66, she can go directly to get a plate, then when soup is ready, serve.\n\nBut cooking not started yet.\n\nCooking starts when third onion added.\n\nWith 2 onions, not cooking.\n\nSo she needs to add the third or have Bob add it.\n\nTo save time, let's have Alice add the first onion, then go for a plate, but that might not be efficient.\n\nI think I need to accept that for Alice, she can complete the pot with the nearby onions, and for the third, it takes time, but with Bob's help, it can be faster.\n\nBut for the plan, I'll output Alice's actions for H turns, say H=10 or something, but not specified.\n\nThe task says \"over next several turns(say, H turns)\", so I can choose H.\n\nLet's say H=10 for simplicity.\n\nSo from turn 57 to 66 for Alice to add two onions, as above.\n\nThen for turn 67 onwards, she can start going for plate or something.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nAlice actions:\n\nTurn 57: U  // change orientation to up\n\nTurn 58: I  // interact with (3,2) to pick up onion\n\nTurn 59: D  // change orientation to down\n\nTurn 60: I  // interact with (3,0) to add onion, pot has 1\n\nTurn 61: L  // move left to (2,1), facing left\n\nTurn 62: U  // change orientation to up\n\nTurn 63: I  // interact with (2,2) to pick up onion\n\nTurn 64: R  // move right to (3,1), facing right\n\nTurn 65: D  // change orientation to down\n\nTurn 66: I  // interact with (3,0) to add onion, pot has 2\n\nNow at turn 66, pot has 2 onions.\n\nFor turn 67, she can move to (4,1) to free (3,1) for Bob.\n\nTurn 67: R  // move right to (4,1), facing right\n\nThen at (4,1), she can wait or do something.\n\nBut with H=10, up to turn 66+10=76, but turn 67 is t1+10? t1=57, so turns 57 to 66 are 10 turns? 57 to 66 is 10 actions? Turn t1: a_t1, t1+1: a_t1+1, ..., up to t1+H-1.\n\nH turns means H actions, from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, H=10, turns 57 to 66.\n\nSo for Alice, from turn 57 to 66:\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: I\n\nTurn 59: D\n\nTurn 60: I\n\nTurn 61: L\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: I\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: D\n\nTurn 66: I\n\nAfter this, pot at (3,0) has 2 onions, and Alice is at (3,1) facing down, holding nothing.\n\nBob can add the third onion if he comes.\n\nThen cooking can start.\n\nAlice can then go for a plate.\n\nBut beyond H=10, not planned.\n\nPerhaps for the soup to be cooked, she can start moving towards plate dispenser.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at turn 66 she is at (3,1), she can move left to (2,1) at turn 67 if H larger.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide the 10 turns as above.\n\nTo make it shorter, she can do less.\n\nAt turn 57, she can directly interact with (3,0), but does nothing, so not good.\n\nOr move, but she is near the onion.\n\nAnother idea: she can change orientation to up and interact in one turn if possible, but each action is separate.\n\nActions are per turn, so she needs to change orientation then interact.\n\nSo the sequence is reasonable.\n\nI think for the response, I'll output the sequence for Alice as above.\n\nThen the pot has 2 onions, and with Bob's onion, he can add to make 3.\n\nThen cooking starts.\n\nAlice can be free to get plate.\n\nBut for the plan, only Alice's actions are listed.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should coordinate to fill the pot at (3,0) with 3 onions as quickly as possible to start cooking Recipe 1 (3 onions, reward 20, cooking time 5 turns). Alice is positioned near the pot at (3,0) and an onion on the kitchen counter at (3,2), making it efficient for her to retrieve and add onions to the pot. Bob is holding an onion and can contribute by adding it to the same pot or another pot after Alice moves away. Alice's actions focus on adding two onions to the pot at (3,0) using nearby onions from (3,2) and (2,2), then moving to free up space for Bob to add the third onion.\n\n### Key Coordination Points:\n- **Alice's Role:** Add onions to pot (3,0) using onions from (3,2) and (2,2). After adding the second onion, move to (4,1) to allow Bob access to (3,1) for adding his onion.\n- **Bob's Role (Inferred for Coordination):** Bob should move to (3,1) and add his onion to pot (3,0) to complete the third ingredient. With the pot full at 3 onions, cooking starts automatically (takes 5 turns). Bob can then assist with serving or filling another pot.\n- **Efficiency:** This plan adds two onions in 10 turns, and with Bob's contribution, cooking can start by turn 67 (if Bob acts promptly). Alice can then focus on obtaining a plate from (0,2) to serve the soup once cooked.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (H = 10 Turns)\nAlice starts at (3,1), facing down, holding nothing. The sequence optimizes movement and interactions to minimize turns:\n- Turns 57-58: Pick up onion from (3,2) by facing up and interacting.\n- Turns 59-60: Add onion to pot (3,0) by facing down and interacting.\n- Turns 61-63: Move to (2,1) and pick up onion from (2,2) by facing up and interacting.\n- Turns 64-66: Return to (3,1) and add the second onion to pot (3,0).\n- Turn 67: Move right to (4,1) to free (3,1) for Bob, allowing him to add his onion.\n\nAfter this sequence, pot (3,0) has 2 onions, and Alice is at (4,1) facing right. Bob (at (4,3) with onion) can now move to (3,1) via (4,2) → (4,1) → (3,1) (but (4,2) is blocked; he must use (3,3) → (2,3) → (2,2) → etc. to reach (3,1)). With Bob's onion added, cooking starts. Alice can then head to (0,2) for a plate to serve the soup when ready.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 57: U \\\\\nTurn 58: I \\\\\nTurn 59: D \\\\\nTurn 60: I \\\\\nTurn 61: L \\\\\nTurn 62: U \\\\\nTurn 63: I \\\\\nTurn 64: R \\\\\nTurn 65: D \\\\\nTurn 66: I \\\\\nTurn 67: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 61. The goal is to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nEnvironment details:\n- The recipe we know is Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n- There are no tomato dispensers, so we can only use onions for this recipe.\n- Onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4).\n- Plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n- Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n- Serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nCurrent game state:\n- Alice is at (2,1), facing Up, holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (3,3), facing Up, holding nothing.\n\nThere are several kitchen counters with onions already placed:\n- (2,2): onion\n- (6,4): onion\n- (7,1): onion\n- (5,4): onion\n- (3,2): onion\n- (4,2): onion\n\nAll pots are empty.\n\nSince we need to make a soup of 3 onions, we can use the onions that are already on the counters. This will save time.\n\nPlan:\nWe have two players. We can assign tasks to both.\n\nThe steps to make a soup and deliver:\n1. Get three onions into a pot. We can pick up onions from the counters or dispensers.\n2. Wait for the pot to cook (5 turns).\n3. Get a plate (from dispenser or counter) and use it to serve the soup from the pot.\n4. Deliver the soup to the serving counter.\n\nBut note: there are two pots. We can use both to make multiple soups? However, we are only planning for the next several turns (say H turns, let's assume H is around 10-15? We are not given H, but we can plan a sequence that leads to a delivery as soon as possible).\n\nSince the pots are empty, we can start by putting onions in one of the pots.\n\nWe have many onions on counters. We can use them.\n\nLet's assign roles:\n- Alice can focus on getting the pot filled and then the plate and delivery.\n- Bob can help by bringing onions to the pot or getting a plate.\n\nBut note: Alice is at (2,1) and Bob at (3,3).\n\nAvailable onions on counters that are close:\n- For Alice: \n  - (2,2) is adjacent to (2,1) and (2,2) has an onion. Alice is at (2,1) and facing Up. (2,1) is adjacent to (2,2) to the North? \n    The grid: (2,1) is at row 1, column 2? But note: the coordinates are (x,y). The move: U (x, y+1). So (2,1) moving U goes to (2,2). \n    But (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. So Alice can pick it up by interacting? However, to interact with (2,2), she must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nCurrent position: (2,1), facing Up. So she is facing (2,2) which is above her. So she can interact to pick up the onion from (2,2) without moving? \n\nBut note: the interaction rule: \n  - Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\n\nAlice is standing on (2,1) which is an empty tile? We don't know the type of (2,1). But typically, the player positions are on empty tiles. So (2,1) is an empty tile? And (2,2) is adjacent (above) and she is facing it. So she can interact to pick up the onion from the counter.\n\nSo at turn 61, Alice can do 'I' to pick up the onion from (2,2).\n\nBut wait: the counter is at (2,2). When she interacts, she will pick up the onion? Yes, because she is empty-handed and the counter has an onion.\n\nAfter picking up, she is holding an onion.\n\nThen she needs to put it in a pot. The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The closest pot to (2,1) is (3,0). How to get there?\n\nFrom (2,1) to (3,0): \n  - First, move right to (3,1) [action R]\n  - Then move down to (3,0) [action D]? But (3,0) is a pot. She can't stand on it. So she must stand adjacent and face it to interact.\n\nSo after picking up the onion, she can move:\n  - R to (3,1) -> now at (3,1), facing? We need to change orientation to face the pot at (3,0) which is down.\n\nBut note: after moving, her orientation changes to the direction of movement? The move action changes position and orientation. Specifically, when moving, the orientation becomes the direction of the move.\n\nAlternatively, she can change orientation without moving? But the change orientation action is separate. However, we have to use the actions: U, D, L, R (which move and change orientation) or we can use the same letter to change orientation without moving? The problem says:\n\n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation.\n- **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n\nBut note: the change orientation action is also represented by L/R/U/D? But with a condition: if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then you don't move? Actually, the description is a bit ambiguous. \n\nLooking back: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut actually, the problem states two types of actions: \n- Move (which changes position and orientation) \n- Change Orientation (which only changes orientation and does not move if the adjacent tile is not empty). \n\nBut in the action set we are to choose from, it's the same set: {U, D, L, R, I, S}. How do we differentiate? \n\nThe key is in the description of Move: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation.\" meaning that if you choose L/R/U/D and the adjacent tile in that direction is empty and walkable, you move. Otherwise, if the adjacent tile is not empty (so you cannot move), then it becomes a change orientation? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" meaning that if you try to move but the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move and only change orientation? \n\nSo the same action (e.g., D) can either be a move (if the tile below is empty) or just a change of orientation (if the tile below is not empty). \n\nSo for Alice at (2,1) holding an onion, to get to the pot at (3,0):\n\nStep 1: Move right to (3,1) -> action R. Now at (3,1), facing right.\nStep 2: Now she needs to face down to interact with the pot at (3,0). Since (3,0) is below (3,1) and (3,0) is a pot (non-empty), she cannot move down. So if she does D, she will not move (because the adjacent tile down is non-empty) but will change orientation to down. Then she can interact.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 61: Alice does I (to pick up onion from (2,2)) -> now holding onion.\n- Turn 62: Alice does R (moves to (3,1), facing right).\n- Turn 63: Alice does D (cannot move down because (3,0) is non-empty? Actually, (3,0) is a pot and non-empty, so she cannot move there. So this D action will only change her orientation to down without moving. Now she is at (3,1), facing down, adjacent to the pot at (3,0).\n- Turn 64: Alice does I (to put the onion into the pot at (3,0)).\n\nNow the pot at (3,0) has 1 onion. We need 3.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is at (3,3) facing up. He is near several onion counters: (3,2) and (4,2) have onions. Also, (3,4) is an onion dispenser? But we have onions on counters, so we can use them.\n\nBob can help by bringing an onion to the same pot.\n\nBob at (3,3) can move to (3,2) (which is one step down? Remember: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So (3,3) to (3,2) is down? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. Bob is at (3,3), facing up. To go to (3,2) he needs to move down.\n\nBut note: (3,2) is a kitchen counter, so Bob cannot stand on it. He must stand adjacent to it to pick up the onion? Actually, to pick up from the counter, he must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nHe is at (3,3) and (3,2) is below him. So he can do:\n- Turn 61: Bob does D (moves to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty, so he cannot move there. So if he does D, he will only change orientation to down? Then he is facing (3,2). Then he can interact to pick up the onion.\n\nBut wait: he is at (3,3) and (3,2) is adjacent and below. He is facing up. If he does D, he will try to move down. Since (3,2) is non-empty, he doesn't move and only changes orientation to down. Then he is at (3,3) facing down. Now he can interact to pick up the onion from (3,2).\n\nSo Bob's actions:\n- Turn 61: D (changes orientation to down, doesn't move) -> now facing down at (3,3).\n- Turn 62: I (picks up onion from (3,2)) -> now holding onion.\n\nThen Bob needs to go to the pot at (3,0). From (3,3) to (3,0): \n  - He is at (3,3) holding onion. He needs to go to (3,0). But he cannot go through (3,2) because it's non-empty? Actually, (3,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty, so he cannot walk on it. He must go around? \n\nThe grid: \n  (3,3) is his current position. (3,2) is blocked. So he can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3). Then go down.\n\nBut note: there might be other counters. We have kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) in that row. So row 2 is blocked? \n\nAlternatively, he can move to (4,3) then (4,2) is a kitchen counter? (4,2) is also a counter with an onion. So he cannot step on (4,2). Then he can go (4,3) -> (4,2) is blocked, so he must go (4,3) to (4,1)? But we don't know the state of (4,1). We know the kitchen counter list: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). \n\nSo (4,1) is not in the list, so it should be an empty tile? Similarly, (2,1) is where Alice was, so empty. (3,1) is empty? (We don't have it in the kitchen counter list, so yes.)\n\nSo Bob can:\n  - From (3,3): move right to (4,3) [action R] -> now at (4,3), facing right.\n  - Then move down to (4,2)? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty -> cannot move. So if he does D, he will change orientation to down without moving. Then he is at (4,3) facing down.\n  - Then move down again? But (4,2) is below and blocked, so he must move around? Actually, he can go to (4,1) by going down twice? But how? \n\nWait: from (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked, so he cannot go down from (4,3). He must go to (5,3) or (3,3) is blocked? Alternatively, he can go to (4,4)? But (4,4) is an onion dispenser? Non-empty? But dispensers are non-empty? Actually, dispensers are not walkable? The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and dispensers are non-empty? \n\nBut note: the dispenser is at (4,4). So Bob at (4,3) cannot go up to (4,4) because it's non-empty? So he is stuck? \n\nAlternatively, from (3,3) he can go left to (2,3). Then (2,3) is not a kitchen counter? We don't have (2,3) in the kitchen counter list, so it's empty. Then from (2,3) he can go down to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. So then he must go (2,3) to (2,2) is blocked, so he goes to (1,3) or (3,3)? \n\nThis is getting messy. \n\nAlternatively, Bob can use the other pot at (4,0) to put the onion? Then we can have two pots being filled? But we only have one recipe and one serving counter. However, we can have two soups? But the recipe is the same. \n\nBut let's think: we have only one plate dispenser? And we need plates to serve. So we might not be able to serve two soups at the same time? \n\nGiven the time, maybe we focus on one pot for now.\n\nBut note: we have many onions. We can fill both pots? \n\nBut the goal is to maximize the reward. Each soup gives 20. So we should aim to make as many as possible.\n\nHowever, the cooking time is 5 turns. We are at turn 61. We can plan for about 15 turns? So we can make one soup and maybe start another.\n\nBut let's focus on one soup first.\n\nBob can go to a pot that is accessible. The pot at (4,0) is near. Bob is at (3,3) holding an onion. How to get to (4,0)?\n\nPath for Bob from (3,3) to (4,0):\n  - Move right to (4,3) [action R] -> now at (4,3), facing right.\n  - Then move down? (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked by kitchen counter? (4,2) has an onion and is a counter -> non-empty. So he cannot move down. \n  - So he must go to (5,3) -> (5,3) is not a kitchen counter? We don't have (5,3) in the list -> empty. \n    - Action: R to (5,3) [but from (4,3) to (5,3) is right? So action R? But he is at (4,3) and facing right? Then R will move to (5,3).\n  - Then from (5,3) move down to (5,2)? (5,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. \n  - Then move down? Not possible. So go to (5,4)? But (5,4) is a kitchen counter? Yes, it is in the list -> blocked. \n  - Then go to (6,3)? We don't have (6,3) in the list -> empty. \n    - From (5,3) move right to (6,3) [action R].\n  - Then from (6,3) move down to (6,2)? (6,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? We have kitchen counters at (6,0), (6,4) -> so (6,2) is empty? Then move down to (6,2) [action D].\n  - Then down to (6,1) [action D] -> empty? \n  - Then down to (6,0) -> but (6,0) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. So we cannot go to (6,0). \n\nThis is taking too long. \n\nAlternatively, from (4,3) Bob can go to (4,4)? But (4,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty, cannot step. \n\nSo the only way is to go left to (3,3) then down? But (3,2) is blocked. \n\nWe need to use the empty tiles. \n\nLooking at the grid: \n  Row 3: (0,3) is kitchen counter, (1,3) not in list -> empty, (2,3) not in list -> empty, (3,3) Bob, (4,3) empty, (5,3) empty, (6,3) empty, (7,3) kitchen counter.\n\nRow 2: (0,2) plate dispenser, (1,2) not in list? -> empty? But we don't know. The kitchen counters are only at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (1,2) is empty. Similarly, (6,2) is empty? \n\nSo Bob can:\n  - From (3,3): move left to (2,3) [action L] -> at (2,3), facing left.\n  - Then move down to (2,2)? But (2,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. So if he does D, he changes orientation to down without moving -> now facing down at (2,3).\n  - Then he can interact with (2,2)? But (2,2) is below him and adjacent. He is facing down. So he can interact to pick up the onion? But wait, he is already holding an onion! He cannot pick up another. \n\nHe is holding an onion. He needs to put it in a pot. So he cannot pick up another.\n\nSo he must go to a pot. \n\nBut to go to (3,0) or (4,0), he must go around the counters. \n\nThe only way is to go to row 1 or row 0? \n\nFrom (2,3): \n  - Move left to (1,3) [action L] -> at (1,3), facing left.\n  - Then move down to (1,2) [action D] -> (1,2) is empty? -> yes, not in kitchen counter list.\n  - Then move down to (1,1) [action D] -> empty? \n  - Then move down to (1,0) -> (1,0) is kitchen counter -> blocked. \n  - Then move right to (2,0) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\nNot working.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,2) he can move right to (2,2) but blocked.\n\nSo the path to the pots might be blocked by the counters. \n\nBut wait: the pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The kitchen counters are at (2,0), (3,0)? No, (3,0) is a pot, so not a kitchen counter. The kitchen counters are at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0). So (3,0) and (4,0) are pots, so non-empty but not kitchen counters? But the rule: players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles. So they are non-empty, so cannot be walked on. \n\nBut we can walk on empty tiles. The row above the pots: row 1. \n\nWe have empty tiles at (3,1) and (4,1)? \n\nSo Bob can go to (3,1) and then face down to interact with the pot at (3,0). \n\nHow to get to (3,1) from (3,3)? \n  - (3,3) to (3,2) is blocked by kitchen counter at (3,2). \n  - So he must go around: \n      (3,3) -> (4,3) [R] -> (4,3) to (4,2) blocked -> (4,3) to (4,4) blocked -> so then (4,3) to (5,3) [R] -> (5,3) to (5,2) blocked -> (5,3) to (5,4) blocked -> (5,3) to (6,3) [R] -> (6,3) to (6,2) [D] -> (6,2) to (6,1) [D] -> (6,1) to (6,0) blocked -> (6,1) to (5,1) [L] -> (5,1) to (4,1) [L] -> (4,1) to (3,1) [L].\n\nThat's 9 moves! Too long.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,3) to (2,3) [L] -> (2,3) to (2,2) blocked -> (2,3) to (1,3) [L] -> (1,3) to (1,2) [D] -> (1,2) to (1,1) [D] -> (1,1) to (2,1) [R] -> (2,1) to (3,1) [R]. \n\nThat's 5 moves. \n\nBut then Bob is at (3,1) and can face down to interact with the pot at (3,0).\n\nSo for Bob to deliver the onion to (3,0) would take at least 5 moves (plus the interaction). \n\nBut we are at turn 61, and we want to plan for several turns. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the pot at (4,0) and have Bob go to (4,1) and then down to interact. \n\nHow to get to (4,1) from (3,3)? \n  - (3,3) -> (4,3) [R] \n  - (4,3) cannot go down to (4,2) -> blocked. \n  - So go (4,3)->(5,3) [R] \n  - (5,3)->(5,2) blocked -> (5,3)->(5,4) blocked -> (5,3)->(6,3) [R]\n  - (6,3)->(6,2) [D]\n  - (6,2)->(6,1) [D]\n  - (6,1)->(5,1) [L]\n  - (5,1)->(4,1) [L] -> 5 moves.\n\nSame as above.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since we have two players, we can have Alice fill the pot at (3,0) and Bob fill the pot at (4,0) independently? \n\nBut then we need plates for both. \n\nBut let's see: we have one plate dispenser at (0,2). \n\nAlternatively, we can have one player focus on filling one pot and the other on getting plates and serving.\n\nBut currently, both are empty-handed and near onions.\n\nRevised plan for Alice: \n  - Turn 61: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n  - Turn 62: R (move to (3,1), facing right)\n  - Turn 63: D (change orientation to down, because (3,0) is below and non-empty -> no move, now facing down)\n  - Turn 64: I (put onion in pot (3,0)) -> now the pot has 1 onion.\n\nThen Alice can get another onion to put in the same pot. Where to get? \n  - She is at (3,1), facing down. She can move up to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. But she cannot move up to (3,2) because it's non-empty. So she can change orientation to up? \n  - Turn 65: U (try to move up: (3,2) is non-empty, so only change orientation to up) -> now facing up at (3,1).\n  - Turn 66: I (interact with (3,2)? But (3,2) is above her and adjacent. She is facing up. So she can pick up the onion from (3,2) -> now holding onion.\n  - Turn 67: D (change orientation to down) -> facing down.\n  - Turn 68: I (put onion in pot (3,0)) -> now the pot has 2 onions.\n\nThen she needs one more onion. The nearest is (4,2) or (2,2) but (2,2) is empty now? Because she took the onion at (2,2) at turn 61. And (3,2) she took at turn 66. So (4,2) has an onion.\n\nTo get to (4,2) from (3,1):\n  - She is at (3,1). (4,2) is at right and up. \n  - Move right to (4,1) [action R] -> at (4,1), facing right.\n  - Then change orientation to up (because (4,2) is above) -> action U (cannot move up because (4,2) is non-empty, so only change orientation to up) -> now facing up.\n  - Interact to pick up onion from (4,2) [I].\n  - Then change orientation to down [D] -> facing down.\n  - Interact with the pot at (4,0)? But she is at (4,1) and the pot at (4,0) is below. So she can put it in (4,0) pot? \n\nBut we were filling (3,0). She can put it in (3,0) by going back to (3,1) and then down orientation.\n\nBut (3,0) pot already has 2 onions. She needs to put the third onion in (3,0). \n\nSo after picking up the onion at (4,2), she should go to (3,1) and face down to interact with (3,0).\n\nSteps:\n  - After picking up onion at (4,2): \n        Turn ?: move left to (3,1) [L] -> at (3,1), facing left.\n        Then D (change orientation to down) -> facing down.\n        Then I (put in pot (3,0)).\n\nBut then the pot at (3,0) will have 3 onions and start cooking at that turn.\n\nMeanwhile, what about Bob? Bob can start filling the other pot (4,0) or help with plates.\n\nBut let's see the timeline.\n\nAlice's actions for the first onion (already planned for turns 61-64):\n  T61: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n  T62: R (move to (3,1))\n  T63: D (face down)\n  T64: I (put in pot (3,0)) -> pot has 1\n\nThen for the second onion:\n  T65: U (face up)  [because she is at (3,1) and wants to interact with (3,2) above]\n  T66: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n  T67: D (face down)\n  T68: I (put in pot (3,0)) -> pot has 2\n\nThen for the third onion from (4,2):\n  T69: R (move to (4,1), facing right)\n  T70: U (face up) [to face (4,2)]\n  T71: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n  T72: L (move left to (3,1), facing left)\n  T73: D (face down)\n  T74: I (put in pot (3,0)) -> now pot has 3, and cooking starts at turn 74.\n\nCooking time is 5 turns, so it will be ready at turn 79.\n\nThen we need to serve it.\n\nNow, who will get the plate? The plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nAlice is at (3,1) after putting the last onion. She can go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nPath from (3,1) to (0,2):\n  - (3,1) -> (2,1) [L] -> (1,1) [L] -> (0,1) [L] -> then (0,1) to (0,2): move up? But (0,2) is plate dispenser, non-empty, so she cannot move there. \n  - So she must stand at (0,1) and face up to interact with (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nSteps:\n  T75: L (move to (2,1), facing left)\n  T76: L (move to (1,1), facing left)\n  T77: L (move to (0,1), facing left)\n  T78: U (change orientation to up, because (0,2) is above) -> cannot move up (since (0,2) non-empty), so only change orientation.\n  T79: I (get plate from (0,2))\n\nNow she is holding a plate. She needs to go back to the pot at (3,0) to serve the soup.\n\nThe soup is ready at turn 79. She can serve it at turn 80 or later.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (3,0):\n  - (0,1) -> (1,1) [R]\n  - (1,1) -> (2,1) [R]\n  - (2,1) -> (3,1) [R]\n  - Then at (3,1) face down and interact.\n\nSteps:\n  T80: R (move to (1,1), facing right)\n  T81: R (move to (2,1), facing right)\n  T82: R (move to (3,1), facing right)\n  T83: D (face down)\n  T84: I (serve the soup from pot (3,0) -> now she is holding the soup on a plate.\n\nThen she needs to deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,2):\n  - (3,1) -> (4,1) [R]\n  - (4,1) -> (5,1) [R] -> (5,1) is empty? \n  - (5,1) -> (6,1) [R]\n  - (6,1) -> (7,1) [R] -> but (7,1) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> non-empty, cannot move. \n  - So cannot go to (7,1). \n\nAlternative: go up to (3,2) blocked, so go to (3,1) to (3,2) blocked, so go via row 2? But row 2 is mostly blocked by counters. \n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,2) [U] -> (6,2) is empty? \n  - T85: R from (3,1) to (4,1)\n  - T86: R to (5,1)\n  - T87: R to (6,1)\n  - T88: U to (6,2) -> now at (6,2), facing up.\n  - Then move right to (7,2) [R] -> (7,2) is serving counter, non-empty? But serving counter is walkable? The rule doesn't say. But typically, counters are not walkable. \n\nThe rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and serving counter is non-empty? Or is it empty? The serving counter is for delivering, so probably non-empty in the sense of being a counter. So cannot walk on it.\n\nSo she must stand adjacent and face it. (7,2) is at column 7, row 2. Adjacent tiles: (7,1), (7,3), (6,2), (8,2) [but 8 is out]. (6,2) is where she is? She is at (6,2) and (7,2) is to the right. She is facing up? After moving U to (6,2), she is facing up. So she needs to face right.\n\nSteps from (6,2):\n  T89: R (try to move right to (7,2) -> cannot because non-empty, so only change orientation to right) -> facing right.\n  T90: I (deliver the soup to (7,2)) -> reward 20.\n\nThis is turn 90.\n\nBut we started at turn 61 and we planned until turn 90, which is 30 turns. We might want a shorter plan or to involve Bob.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob has been idle? We haven't planned for Bob.\n\nBob can help by getting the second onion for the pot or by getting a plate earlier.\n\nBut let's see if we can make it faster with Bob's help.\n\nAlternative plan with both players:\n\nAlice focuses on the pot at (3,0) and Bob on the pot at (4,0).\n\nFor Alice (as before) to put three onions in (3,0).\n\nFor Bob to put three onions in (4,0).\n\nBob is at (3,3). He can pick up the onion at (3,2) then go to (4,1) and put it in (4,0).\n\nSteps for Bob:\n  T61: D (face down) -> because (3,2) is below, so he can interact.\n  T62: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n  T63: R (move to (4,3), facing right)\n  T64: D (face down) [because (4,2) is below and blocked, so only change orientation]\n  T65: D again? But (4,2) is still below and blocked. He needs to go to (4,1). How? \n        He is at (4,3). He cannot go down. He can go right to (5,3) [R] -> then down to (5,2) blocked -> not helpful.\n\nSo Bob must take the long way to (4,1) as before, which is 5 moves. \n\nAlternatively, he can use the onion at (4,2) which is closer to (4,0). But to pick up (4,2) he must be at (4,1) or (4,3) or (3,2) or (5,2). But (4,3) is above, (4,1) is below, (3,2) and (5,2) are beside.\n\nBob at (3,3) holding nothing:\n  T61: R (move to (4,3), facing right)\n  T62: D (face down) -> because (4,2) is below, blocked, so only change orientation.\n  T63: I (interact with (4,2)? He is at (4,3) facing down, and (4,2) is adjacent and below. So he can pick up the onion from (4,2) -> now holding onion.\n  T64: then he needs to put it in (4,0). But he is at (4,3). How to get to (4,1) to face (4,0)? \n        He cannot go down to (4,2) -> blocked. So he must go around: \n        R to (5,3) [T64]\n        D to (5,2) blocked -> so only face down? Not helpful.\n        Instead, go R to (5,3) [T64]\n        then R to (6,3) [T65]\n        then D to (6,2) [T66]\n        then D to (6,1) [T67]\n        then L to (5,1) [T68]\n        then L to (4,1) [T69]\n  T70: D (face down) -> now at (4,1) facing down, adjacent to (4,0) pot.\n  T71: I (put onion in (4,0)) -> one onion in (4,0)\n\nThen he needs two more onions. He can get from nearby counters, e.g., (5,2) or (3,2) or (2,2) etc.\n\nBut this is very long.\n\nGiven the time constraints, it might be better to have Bob help with the same pot or with plates.\n\nPlan with both players cooperating on one soup:\n\nAlice: \n  T61: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n  T62: R (move to (3,1))\n  T63: D (face down)\n  T64: I (put in pot (3,0)) -> 1 onion\n\nAlice then gets second onion from (3,2):\n  T65: U (face up)\n  T66: I (pick up from (3,2))\n  T67: D (face down)\n  T68: I (put in pot (3,0)) -> 2 onions\n\nAlice then gets third onion from (4,2):\n  T69: R (move to (4,1))\n  T70: U (face up)\n  T71: I (pick up from (4,2))\n  T72: L (move to (3,1))\n  T73: D (face down)\n  T74: I (put in pot (3,0)) -> 3 onions, cooking starts at T74.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate and bring it back.\n\nBob at (3,3) at T61:\n  T61: L (move to (2,3)) -> facing left.\n  T62: L (move to (1,3)) -> facing left.\n  T63: D (move to (1,2)) -> (1,2) is empty? -> yes, move down, facing down.\n  T64: then he needs to get the plate from (0,2). He is at (1,2). (0,2) is to the left. \n        T64: L (move to (0,2)? But (0,2) is non-empty (plate dispenser), so cannot move. So if he does L, he will change orientation to left without moving. Then he is at (1,2) facing left. \n        T65: I (interact with (0,2) to get a plate) -> now holding a plate.\n\nThen Bob needs to go to the pot at (3,0) to serve the soup when it's ready.\n\nThe soup will be ready at T74+5 = T79.\n\nBob is at (1,2) at T65 holding a plate.\n\nPath to (3,0):\n  - (1,2) -> (2,2) blocked -> cannot. \n  - So he must go down to (1,1) [D] -> then right to (2,1) [R], then to (3,1) [R].\n\nSteps:\n  T66: D (move to (1,1), facing down)\n  T67: R (move to (2,1), facing right)\n  T68: R (move to (3,1), facing right)\n  T69: D (face down) -> now facing the pot at (3,0)\n  Then he waits until the soup is ready.\n\nThe soup is ready at T79. So at T79, he can interact to serve the soup.\n\nBut note: the soup becomes ready at the beginning of turn 79? Or after the actions of turn 79? Typically, the cooking starts at the turn when the third onion is put in (T74) and then we count 5 turns: T75, T76, T77, T78, T79 -> ready at turn 79.\n\nSo at T79, Bob can do I to serve the soup.\n\nThen he is holding the soup on a plate.\n\nThen he needs to deliver to (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,2):\n  - As before, he can go:\n        T80: R to (4,1)\n        T81: R to (5,1)\n        T82: R to (6,1)\n        T83: U to (6,2)\n        T84: R (face right) [since (7,2) is to the right, and he cannot move there, so change orientation]\n        T85: I (deliver)\n\nBut this is long.\n\nAlternatively, after serving the soup at T79, Alice can be the one to deliver? But Alice is free from T74 onwards.\n\nAt T74, Alice is at (3,1) after putting the last onion. She can then go to (0,2) to get a plate for the next soup, or she can help with delivery.\n\nBut Bob is the one holding the soup after serving.\n\nTo save time, we can have Alice get the plate and Bob deliver, but Bob's path to delivery is long.\n\nAlternatively, after Bob serves the soup at T79, he can give the soup to Alice? But there's no direct way to hand over. They would have to use a counter.\n\nFor example, Bob can place the soup on a kitchen counter, and Alice picks it up and delivers.\n\nBut we have to find an empty kitchen counter. The kitchen counters are mostly occupied by onions, but we have used some. For example, (2,2) is empty now (because Alice took the onion at T61). (3,2) is empty (Alice took at T66). (4,2) is empty (Alice took at T71). \n\nSo (2,2) is empty. Bob can go to (2,1) and face up to interact with (2,2) and place the soup there.\n\nSteps for Bob after serving the soup at (3,0) at T79:\n  - He is at (3,1) holding the soup.\n  - T80: L (move to (2,1), facing left)\n  - T81: U (face up) [to face (2,2)]\n  - T82: I (place the soup on (2,2)) -> now the soup is on (2,2), and Bob is empty.\n\nThen Alice can be directed to pick it up and deliver.\n\nWhere is Alice at T79? \n  - Alice's last action was at T74: I (put last onion in pot). Then she is at (3,1). \n  - From T75 to T79, she can be doing nothing or moving to help.\n\nWe can plan Alice to be at (2,1) or nearby.\n\nAlice at T75: \n  - She is at (3,1). \n  - We can have her move to (2,1) at T75: L (move to (2,1), facing left)\n  - Then at T76: U (face up) to face (2,2) -> which is empty now.\n  - But at T79, the soup is not placed yet. Bob places it at T82.\n\nSo Alice can wait or do other things.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can go to the plate dispenser to get a plate for the next soup while waiting for the first soup to cook.\n\nBut then she won't be available to pick up the soup from the counter.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since we are only to plan for several turns (say 10-15 turns), we might only plan until the soup is cooked or until the plate is obtained.\n\nBut the problem says to maximize the reward, and we can only deliver one soup in the near future.\n\nSo let's plan for Alice only for the next 10 turns (until turn 71) and see.\n\nAlice's actions for turns 61 to 71:\n\n  T61: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n  T62: R (move to (3,1))\n  T63: D (face down)\n  T64: I (put in pot (3,0)) \n  T65: U (face up)\n  T66: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n  T67: D (face down)\n  T68: I (put in pot (3,0)) \n  T69: R (move to (4,1))\n  T70: U (face up)\n  T71: I (pick up onion from (4,2)) \n\nThen at T71, she is holding the third onion. The next actions would be to move to (3,1) and put it in the pot, which is two more turns.\n\nBut we stop at T71.\n\nFor Bob, we can plan similarly for a few turns.\n\nBob's actions for turns 61 to 71:\n\n  T61: L (move to (2,3))\n  T62: L (move to (1,3))\n  T63: D (move to (1,2))\n  T64: L (face left) [because (0,2) is left, and he can't move there, so change orientation to left]\n  T65: I (get plate from (0,2))\n  T66: D (move to (1,1))\n  T67: R (move to (2,1))\n  T68: R (move to (3,1)) -> but at T68, Alice is at (3,1) putting the second onion? Then at T69, Alice moves to (4,1), so (3,1) is free at T69? \n\nBut players cannot walk onto each other. So if Bob tries to move to (3,1) at T68, and Alice is there, he cannot. \n\nAlice is at (3,1) from T64 to T68? \n  T64: Alice at (3,1) after putting onion, then T65: U (face up) at (3,1), T66: I at (3,1), T67: D at (3,1), T68: I at (3,1) (putting second onion), then T69: R to (4,1).\n\nSo at T68, Alice is at (3,1) doing I. Then after T68, she is still at (3,1) until T69 when she moves to (4,1).\n\nSo at T68, when Bob tries to move to (3,1), Alice is there -> collision, so Bob cannot move there. \n\nBob should wait or find an alternative.\n\nAt T68, Bob can stay at (2,1) and wait. \n\nSo:\n  T68: S (stay) at (2,1)\n\nThen T69: when Alice moves to (4,1), (3,1) is free. So Bob can move to (3,1) at T69.\n\nThen T70: Bob does D (face down) to face the pot.\n\nThen at T71, the pot only has 2 onions, so he cannot serve yet. He can wait.\n\nBut we are only planning until T71.\n\nGiven the complexity and the coordination issue, perhaps we only plan for Alice for the next 10 turns, and let the adaptive system handle Bob.\n\nSince the question asks for Alice (and optionally Bob), we can just plan for Alice.\n\nSo for Alice, turns 61 to 71 (11 turns):\n\n  T61: I \n  T62: R\n  T63: D\n  T64: I\n  T65: U\n  T66: I\n  T67: D\n  T68: I\n  T69: R\n  T70: U\n  T71: I\n\nThis has her pick up the third onion at T71.\n\nThen the next actions would be to move to (3,1) and put it in the pot, which is:\n\n  T72: L (move to (3,1))\n  T73: D (face down)\n  T74: I (put in pot)\n\nBut that is beyond our plan.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan for 10 actions (H=10), so turns 61 to 70.\n\nAlice's actions for 10 turns (61 to 70):\n\n  T61: I \n  T62: R\n  T63: D\n  T64: I\n  T65: U\n  T66: I\n  T67: D\n  T68: I  -> at this point, the pot has 2 onions.\n  T69: R\n  T70: U  -> now at (4,1) facing up, ready to interact with (4,2) at T71.\n\nSo we stop at T70.\n\nThis is a partial plan, but it's progressing.\n\nTo maximize reward, we might want to have Alice and Bob work on different tasks, but given the coordination challenge, we'll just output Alice's actions for the next 10 turns.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 61: I\nTurn 62: R\nTurn 63: D\nTurn 64: I\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: I\nTurn 67: D\nTurn 68: I\nTurn 69: R\nTurn 70: U\n}\n\nNote: This is for Alice only. Bob's actions are not planned here, but in practice, we would coordinate. However, the task says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so we can just do Alice.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice will focus on gathering onions from nearby kitchen counters and placing them into the nearest pot at (3, 0) to cook a soup (Recipe 1: 3 onions, reward 20). The pot will automatically start cooking once filled. Alice is positioned at (2, 1) with multiple onions available on adjacent counters, allowing her to efficiently collect and deposit ingredients without unnecessary movement. Bob can independently assist by gathering a plate from (0, 2) for future serving, but since coordination is complex and the task emphasizes Alice's actions, only her plan is detailed here.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 61 to 70):\n- **Turn 61: I**  \n  Alice interacts with the kitchen counter at (2, 2) (facing Up) to pick up an onion.\n- **Turn 62: R**  \n  Alice moves right to (3, 1), now facing Right, positioning herself near the pot at (3, 0).\n- **Turn 63: D**  \n  Alice changes orientation to Down (cannot move down to (3, 0) as it's non-empty), now facing the pot.\n- **Turn 64: I**  \n  Alice interacts with the pot at (3, 0) to place the onion. Pot now has 1 onion.\n- **Turn 65: U**  \n  Alice changes orientation to Up (cannot move up to (3, 2) as it's non-empty), now facing the kitchen counter at (3, 2).\n- **Turn 66: I**  \n  Alice interacts with the kitchen counter at (3, 2) to pick up an onion.\n- **Turn 67: D**  \n  Alice changes orientation to Down, facing the pot again.\n- **Turn 68: I**  \n  Alice interacts with the pot at (3, 0) to place the onion. Pot now has 2 onions.\n- **Turn 69: R**  \n  Alice moves right to (4, 1), now facing Right, positioning herself near the kitchen counter at (4, 2).\n- **Turn 70: U**  \n  Alice changes orientation to Up (cannot move up to (4, 2) as it's non-empty), now facing the kitchen counter.\n\n### Outcome:\n- By Turn 70, Alice has placed 2 onions in the pot and is ready to pick up a third onion from (4, 2) on Turn 71. After placing it (Turn 72–74), the pot will start cooking (ready by Turn 79). Bob can concurrently fetch a plate from (0, 2) for serving. This plan efficiently uses pre-placed onions and minimizes movement, setting up a soup delivery for +20 reward within 10–15 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 61: I\nTurn 62: R\nTurn 63: D\nTurn 64: I\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: I\nTurn 67: D\nTurn 68: I\nTurn 69: R\nTurn 70: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 64 (t1 = 64). We are to plan a sequence of actions for Alice for the next several turns (H turns) to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the environment and the current state:\n\n**Tile Types:**\n- Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n- Onion Dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\n**Recipe:**\nOnly Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n\n**Current Game State (turn 64):**\n- Alice (me): at (2,1), facing Down (D), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (2,3), facing Down (D), holding one onion.\n\n**Non-empty Kitchen Counters:**\n- (6,4): onion\n- (7,1): onion\n- (5,4): onion\n- (3,2): onion\n- (4,2): onion\n- (2,0): onion\n\n**Pots:**\n- Both pots (at (3,0) and (4,0)) are empty.\n\n**Goal:** Deliver as many soups as possible to the serving counter (7,2) to get rewards.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Each soup requires 3 onions and must be cooked in a pot for 5 turns.\n- We need to put 3 onions in a pot, then after 5 turns, the soup is ready. Then, someone must pick up a plate (from the plate dispenser at (0,2)), use it on the pot to get the soup, and then deliver it to the serving counter (7,2).\n\n**Current resources:**\nThere are onions scattered on several kitchen counters and also Bob is holding one. Additionally, we can get more onions from the dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe have two pots. We should try to fill both pots as soon as possible to cook two soups simultaneously. However, we are at turn 64 and we need 5 turns to cook. So if we start a soup at turn t, it will be ready at turn t+5.\n\nLet's see what we can do immediately.\n\n**Alice (at (2,1), facing D):**\n- She can move: U, D, L, R, or interact (if facing an adjacent non-empty tile). Currently, she is facing down, so the tile below her is (2,0). (2,0) is a kitchen counter and it has an onion. But note: to interact, she must be adjacent and facing the tile. She is at (2,1) and facing down, so (2,0) is adjacent and she is facing it. However, she is holding nothing. The interaction with a kitchen counter that has an item: if she is empty-handed, she can pick up the item. So she can pick up the onion at (2,0) by pressing 'I'. But note: she must be adjacent and facing. She is at (2,1) and facing down -> adjacent to (2,0) and facing it. So she can do that.\n\nAlternatively, she could move. But picking up the onion seems useful because we need onions for the soup.\n\n**Bob (at (2,3), holding an onion, facing down):**\n- He is above the kitchen counter at (2,2). But (2,2) is a kitchen counter? The list says kitchen counters include (2,2). However, we don't know if it is occupied. The non-empty ones are listed and (2,2) is not in the non-empty list, so it is empty. So Bob cannot interact with (2,2) because it is empty and he is holding an onion? Actually, he can place his onion on the empty kitchen counter. But that might not be the best. Alternatively, he could move towards a pot to put his onion in.\n\nBut note: the pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). Bob is at (2,3). He is 3 steps away from the nearest pot (say (3,0)): he would need to move down twice and then right? But there's a kitchen counter at (2,2) which is between him and the pot. He cannot walk through non-empty tiles? Actually, (2,2) is a kitchen counter and it is empty, so it is walkable? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those with dispensers, pots, counters (but counters are walkable when empty? Actually, the rules say \"Empty Tile\" is walkable. But the tile types: kitchen counters are non-empty? Actually, the tile types are fixed. The rules say:\n\n- **Empty Tile:** Walkable space.\n- **Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter** are non-empty? But the rules also say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning that they cannot walk on any tile that is not an empty tile? Actually, no: the rule says \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\". So non-empty tiles (by type) are not walkable? But wait, the kitchen counters are listed as non-empty? Actually, the kitchen counters are tiles that can have items, but the tile itself is a type. The rules don't explicitly say that kitchen counters are not walkable. Let me re-read:\n\nThe grid has tile types. The rules say:\n- **Empty Tile:** Walkable.\n- **Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter:** These are non-empty? But the rule for movement: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\" and then the constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning that if the tile they are trying to move to is non-empty (i.e., not an empty tile), then they cannot move there.\n\nBut note: the kitchen counter is a tile type that is non-empty? Actually, the problem states: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is listed in the non-empty tile types? But the movement rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So we can only walk on empty tiles? Then the kitchen counters are not walkable? But then how do we interact with them? We have to be adjacent and facing.\n\nSo the grid has:\n- Walkable tiles: only empty tiles? But the players start at (2,1) and (2,3). Are these empty? (2,1) is not listed as any non-empty tile, so it must be an empty tile? Similarly, (2,3) is not listed as a non-empty tile? But the non-empty tile list is the list of tiles that are of type kitchen counter, etc. Actually, the environment details list the positions of each type. So:\n\n- The entire grid is made of tiles. Some tiles are of type Kitchen Counter, Onion Dispenser, etc. But the movement rule: we can only move to empty tiles? Actually, no: the rule says \"non-empty tiles\" meaning tiles that are occupied by an object? But the environment lists the positions of each type. The movement constraint says: cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles. So we must assume that only the tiles that are of type \"Empty Tile\" are walkable? But the environment doesn't list empty tiles. It lists only the non-empty ones. So any tile not in the non-empty lists is an empty tile? That must be the case.\n\nTherefore, the grid:\n- (2,1): not in any non-empty list -> empty -> walkable.\n- (2,3): not in any non-empty list -> empty -> walkable.\n\nBut the kitchen counters are at specific positions. For example, (2,0) is a kitchen counter. So that tile is non-empty and not walkable. Similarly, (2,2) is a kitchen counter (listed in the kitchen counter positions) -> non-empty -> not walkable.\n\nSo Bob is at (2,3). He cannot move down to (2,2) because that's a kitchen counter (non-empty). He can only move left, right, or up? But (2,3) is at the bottom? The grid coordinates: \n- (0,0) is top-left? The movement: U (y+1) -> up increases y? That's unusual. Normally, in grids, y increases downward. But the problem says: \n  - U: (x, y+1) -> so moving up increases y? Then the grid is like: \n    - (0,0) at bottom? \n  - D: (x, y-1) -> down decreases y.\n\nBut the recipe and the positions: \n- Pots at (3,0) and (4,0): so row 0 is the bottom? \n- Alice at (2,1): so row 1 is above row 0? \n- Bob at (2,3): row 3 is above row 1? \n\nBut if U is (x, y+1) and D is (x, y-1), then:\n- (x, y) -> U -> (x, y+1) is one step upward? But then the y-axis is increasing upward? That's non-standard. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grid is drawn with (0,0) at the top-left and then:\n- U: (x, y-1) would be up? But the problem says: U: (x, y+1). \n\nThis is confusing. Let me clarify with the action history:\n\nAlice's action history: U, U, I, D, I. \n- She was at some position and did U (which moves to (x, y+1)) twice, then I, then D (to (x, y-1)), then I.\n\nBob's action history: L, U, I, L, D.\n\nBut without knowing previous positions, it's hard. We must rely on the current positions.\n\nGiven the positions: \n- Alice at (2,1) and Bob at (2,3). The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). So row 0 is the bottom row? Then (2,0) is below (2,1). \n\nSo to go from (2,1) to (2,0), Alice would move down (D: (x, y-1) -> from (2,1) to (2,0)). \n\nSimilarly, Bob at (2,3): to go to (2,2) would be down (D: (2,2) = (2,3-1)). But (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so he cannot walk there. \n\nTherefore, Bob must go around? The kitchen counters are at (2,2) and (3,2) and (4,2) and (5,2) in that row. So the row y=2 is blocked by kitchen counters. Therefore, to get from (2,3) to the pots at (3,0) or (4,0), Bob must go around the kitchen counters. \n\nThe empty tiles: we need a path. Let's sketch the grid:\n\nWe know:\n- Row y=0: kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0) and pots at (3,0) and (4,0). So the pots are also at y=0? But the rule says non-empty tiles are not walkable. So the entire row y=0 is non-walkable? Then how do we get to the pots? We don't walk on the pot tile? We interact from an adjacent tile.\n\nTo interact with a pot at (3,0), we must be at an adjacent empty tile and facing the pot. The adjacent tiles to (3,0) are:\n- (3,1) (above), (2,0) (left), (4,0) (right), (3,-1) (below) -> but (3,-1) is out of bounds. \nBut (2,0) and (4,0) are kitchen counters (non-walkable). So the only adjacent tile is (3,1). Similarly for (4,0): adjacent tile is (4,1). \n\nSo to use the pot at (3,0), we must stand at (3,1) and face down (because the pot is at (3,0) which is below (3,1) in terms of y? But note: (3,1) is above (3,0) because y=0 is the bottom? So if we are at (3,1) and we face down (which is decreasing y) we face (3,0). So that works.\n\nSimilarly, for the pot at (4,0), we use (4,1).\n\nNow, the tile (3,1): is it empty? It is not in any non-empty list? So it is an empty tile -> walkable. Similarly, (4,1) is not listed -> empty.\n\nSo the plan for Bob: he is at (2,3) and wants to get to (3,1) or (4,1) to put his onion in a pot.\n\nPath for Bob from (2,3) to (3,1):\n- He cannot go down to (2,2) because that's a kitchen counter. So he must go left or right? \n- The grid: we don't have a full map, but we know the positions of non-empty tiles.\n\nAssume the grid is 8x5? (from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 4). \n\nNon-empty tiles (by type) are fixed. So any tile not in the lists is empty.\n\nBob at (2,3). He can move:\n- Left: (1,3) -> is that empty? We don't have any non-empty tile at (1,3) -> so empty -> walkable.\n- Right: (3,3) -> is that non-empty? We have kitchen counters at (0,3) and (7,3) but not (3,3) -> so empty? Actually, the kitchen counters are only at the positions listed. So (3,3) is not listed -> empty -> walkable.\n- Up: (2,4) -> is that non-empty? We have kitchen counters at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4). So (2,4) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. \n- Down: (2,2) -> kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n\nSo Bob can move left to (1,3) or right to (3,3). \n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,1):\n- Option: go right to (3,3), then down? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So he cannot go down from (3,3) to (3,2). \n- Alternatively, go left to (1,3), then down? (1,2) is not listed as a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters at y=2 are (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (1,2) is not listed -> empty. So he can go left to (1,3), then down to (1,2) (if (1,2) is empty? yes), then right to (2,2)? but (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So he cannot go to (2,2). \n\nHe must go from (1,2) to (1,1) or (1,0)? (1,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So he can go down to (1,1) (if empty) and then right to (2,1) (which is empty, and Alice is there but if Alice moves, then it becomes available) and then right to (3,1). \n\nBut note: at (2,1) is Alice. So if Bob moves to (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) but (2,1) is occupied by Alice? We cannot walk onto each other. So if Alice stays at (2,1), Bob cannot go to (2,1). \n\nAlternatively, Bob can go from (1,2) to (0,2)? (0,2) is a plate dispenser -> non-walkable? The dispenser is non-empty -> non-walkable. So he cannot go to (0,2). \n\nSo the only way is to go to (1,1) and then to (2,1) if Alice moves away? \n\nAlternatively, Bob can go from (2,3) to (3,3) and then to (4,3) and then down? Let's see:\n- (4,3): not listed -> empty.\n- Then down to (4,2): (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n- So he cannot go down from (4,3). \n\nThen Bob must go from (3,3) to (3,4)? (3,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-walkable? So he cannot go up to (3,4). \n\nSo the only path for Bob to reach (3,1) is:\n(2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) is non-walkable (onion dispenser) -> dead end? \n\nWait, (4,3) is empty? Then from (4,3) he can go left to (3,3) again? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,3) he can go to (3,2) is blocked. \n\nSo the only viable path is via the left: \n(2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) [if Alice moves] -> (3,1). \n\nBut Alice is at (2,1). So if Alice moves away, Bob can go to (2,1). \n\nAlternatively, Bob can go from (1,1) to (0,1)? (0,1) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So he cannot. \n\nTherefore, Bob must go to (1,1) and then wait for Alice to leave (2,1) so he can go to (2,1) and then to (3,1). \n\nThis is complicated and might take many turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the kitchen counters to store items and have Alice and Bob work on different tasks.\n\nLet's think about the immediate actions:\n\nAt turn 64:\n\nAlice is at (2,1) facing down. She can interact with (2,0) which is a kitchen counter that has an onion. She is empty-handed, so she can pick up that onion. So action: 'I'. Then she will be holding an onion.\n\nBob is at (2,3) holding an onion. He cannot move down because (2,2) is blocked. He can move left to (1,3) or right to (3,3). \n\nBut note: there is a kitchen counter at (3,2) that has an onion. But Bob cannot interact with it from (2,3) because he is not adjacent and facing. \n\nWhat if Bob moves right to (3,3)? Then he is above the kitchen counter at (3,2). He would be at (3,3) and the kitchen counter is at (3,2) which is below him? So if he faces down, he is facing (3,2). But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and it has an onion. Since he is holding an onion, he cannot pick up (because he is not empty-handed). But he can place his onion on the kitchen counter? Only if the counter is empty. But the counter at (3,2) already has an onion. So he cannot place. \n\nSimilarly, the kitchen counter at (4,2) has an onion. \n\nSo Bob cannot place his onion on those. \n\nBut there are empty kitchen counters? The list of non-empty kitchen counters only lists the ones that are occupied. The kitchen counter positions include (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) and others. We don't know which are empty. The non-empty ones are listed: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2), (4,2), (2,0). So the others are empty. For example, (2,2) is a kitchen counter but not listed as non-empty -> so it is empty. Similarly, (5,2) is empty? And others.\n\nSo Bob can place his onion on an empty kitchen counter. The closest empty kitchen counter to Bob? At (2,3), the adjacent ones? He cannot step on (2,2) but he can interact with it if he is at (2,3) and facing down? (2,2) is below (2,3). He is at (2,3) and facing down -> so he is facing (2,2). And (2,2) is an empty kitchen counter? Yes. So he can place his onion on (2,2) by pressing 'I'. Then he would be empty-handed.\n\nThis is a good idea because then he is free to move. But we need onions for the soup, so storing it temporarily is okay.\n\nSo at turn 64:\n\nAlice: 'I' to pick up the onion at (2,0). She will then hold an onion.\nBob: 'I' to place his onion on the kitchen counter at (2,2). Then he will be empty-handed.\n\nBut note: after Bob places the onion, the kitchen counter (2,2) becomes non-empty.\n\nThen at turn 65:\n\nAlice is holding an onion. She is at (2,1). She can move to (3,1) (right) to be adjacent to the pot at (3,0). Then she can face down and interact to put the onion in the pot.\n\nBut to move right from (2,1) to (3,1): is (3,1) empty? Yes. And no one is there. So she can move right.\n\nBob is at (2,3) and empty-handed. He can then move left to (1,3) or right to (3,3). But we want him to help. He could go to an onion dispenser to get more onions? Or to a plate dispenser? \n\nBut we need to fill the pot. We have two pots. We can fill one pot with three onions. Currently, after Alice puts her onion in the pot at (3,0), the pot will have one onion. We need two more. There are onions on kitchen counters: at (2,0) is now gone (picked by Alice), but there are others: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2), (4,2), (2,0) was one but taken, and Bob placed one at (2,2). So we have onions at: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2), (4,2), (2,2).\n\nThe closest onion to the pot at (3,0) is at (3,2) and (4,2) and (2,2). \n\nBob can pick up the onion at (2,2) by interacting: he is at (2,3), facing down (if he didn't change orientation). He can press 'I' to pick it up? But he just placed it, so he is facing down and adjacent. But he is at (2,3) and the counter at (2,2) is below him. So if he is facing down, he can interact. But he placed it in the previous turn, so now the counter has an onion. He can pick it up? Yes, if he is empty-handed. He is. So he can pick it up.\n\nThen he would be holding an onion again. Then he can move to (3,3) and then to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and non-walkable. So he cannot step there. He must go to (3,1) to put it in the pot? But to get to (3,1), he must go from (2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked, so he must go to (4,1) via (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked. \n\nAlternatively, from (2,3) he can go to (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1). But (2,1) might be occupied by Alice? \n\nThis is messy.\n\nAlternatively, after Bob places the onion at (2,2), he can move left to (1,3) and then down to (1,2) and then right to (1,1) and then down? (1,1) to (1,0) is blocked. So he can only go to (1,1) and then right to (2,1) if available. \n\nBut Alice is going to move to (3,1) at turn 65? \n\nLet's plan step by step for a few turns:\n\nTurn 64:\n- Alice: I (to pick up onion at (2,0))\n- Bob: I (to place the onion at (2,2))\n\nAfter turn 64:\n- Alice: at (2,1), holding onion, facing down? She just did an interact, so she didn't move. Orientation is still down? The action 'I' doesn't change orientation? The problem doesn't say. But typically, interacting doesn't change orientation. So she is still facing down.\n- Bob: at (2,3), holding nothing, facing down? He just placed the onion.\n\nTurn 65:\n- Alice: she is at (2,1) holding an onion. She wants to put it in the pot at (3,0). She must be at (3,1) and facing down. So she needs to move right to (3,1). Action: R (move right). Then she will be at (3,1) and facing right? Because when you move, you change orientation to the direction of movement. The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So if she moves right, she will be facing right. But to interact with the pot at (3,0) which is below her, she needs to face down. So after moving to (3,1), she must change orientation to down? But she can only do one action per turn. So she can either move or change orientation or interact. So she cannot do both move and change orientation in one turn.\n\nTherefore, at turn 65:\n- Alice: R (move right to (3,1)) -> now at (3,1), facing right.\n- Then at turn 66: she must change orientation to down (action: D? But the orientation change: to face down, she uses the action 'D'? But 'D' is also move down. The actions for changing orientation are the same as move? The problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" \n\nWait, the actions are:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): changes position and orientation.\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): changes only orientation, no move. But it does not move only if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty? Actually, the description: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> that seems confusing. \n\nLet me read carefully:\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous. But the parenthetical says \"L/R/U/D\", the same as move. And it says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" meaning that if you try to change orientation to a direction where the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then you don't move? But that doesn't make sense because changing orientation shouldn't move at all.\n\nLooking back: \n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. The problem says:\n\n\"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one. \n- Interact (I): ... \n- Stay (S): ...\"\n\nThe \"Change Orientation\" action: it says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This suggests that when you try to change orientation, if the adjacent tile in the direction you want to face is not empty, then you don't move? But that doesn't make sense because changing orientation shouldn't move. \n\nPerhaps it's a typo. I think it means that the Change Orientation action does not cause a move, regardless. The condition might be for something else? \n\nAlternatively, it might mean that if you use a movement action (like pressing 'L') and the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move but only change orientation? That is a common mechanic. \n\nThe problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and then \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is confusing. But let me interpret based on common sense and typical Overcooked mechanics:\n\nIn Overcooked, pressing a direction key:\n- If the adjacent tile in that direction is walkable, you move there and face that direction.\n- If it is not walkable, you turn to face that direction without moving.\n\nSo the action for moving is the same as changing orientation: you press the direction. And if you can move, you move and face; if you cannot move, you just face that direction.\n\nSo the action set is: {U, D, L, R, I, S}. \n\nPressing 'U' (for example):\n- If the tile above is walkable, you move there and face up.\n- If not, you just face up without moving.\n\nSo there is no separate \"Change Orientation\" action. The movement actions also serve to change orientation when movement is blocked.\n\nTherefore, for Alice at (2,1) facing down at turn 65: she wants to face down at (3,1) to interact with the pot below. But she is at (3,1) and facing right. She can press 'D' to face down. Since the tile below (3,0) is a pot (non-walkable), she cannot move down, so she just turns to face down.\n\nThen at turn 66, she can press 'I' to interact with the pot at (3,0) and add her onion.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 65: Alice: R (moves to (3,1) and faces right)\nTurn 66: Alice: D (tries to move down but cannot because (3,0) is non-walkable, so she turns to face down)\nTurn 67: Alice: I (interact with pot at (3,0) to add onion)\n\nThat's three turns for Alice to put one onion in the pot.\n\nBut we have only planned for Alice. We need to coordinate with Bob.\n\nAlternatively, after turn 64, Alice is at (2,1) holding an onion. Instead of moving right, she could move up? But that might not help.\n\nOr, she could drop the onion on a kitchen counter closer to the pot? For example, she could move to (3,1) and then drop the onion on (3,1)? But (3,1) is an empty tile, not a kitchen counter. She can only drop on kitchen counters. The kitchen counters are at specific positions. The closest kitchen counter to (3,1) is (3,2) but that already has an onion. Or (2,2) which is empty? But (2,2) is at (2,2) which is above her. She would have to move up to (2,2) but (2,2) is non-walkable. So she cannot.\n\nSo the above plan is necessary.\n\nFor Bob at turn 65:\nAfter turn 64, Bob is at (2,3) facing down, empty-handed. The kitchen counter at (2,2) now has an onion (the one he placed). He can press 'I' to pick it up? But he is facing down and adjacent, so he can. But then he is holding an onion again. Then he has the same problem as before: he is stuck at (2,3) with an onion.\n\nAlternatively, after placing the onion at (2,2) at turn 64, at turn 65 he can move left to (1,3) (which is empty) and face left? Or he can move right to (3,3) (empty) and face right.\n\nThen at turn 66, he can move down from (1,3) to (1,2) (empty) and then to (1,1) (empty) and then to (2,1) if Alice has moved away. But Alice is at (2,1) until turn 65 when she moves to (3,1). So at turn 65, Alice moves to (3,1), so (2,1) becomes empty. So at turn 66, Bob can move from (1,2) to (1,1) and then to (2,1) at turn 67? \n\nThis is slow.\n\nAlternatively, Bob could go to the plate dispenser to get plates? But we don't have soup ready yet.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's focus on filling one pot quickly.\n\nWe have two players. We can have one player (Alice) start filling the pot, and the other player (Bob) gather more onions.\n\nBut Bob is at (2,3). The onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4). He can go there to get onions.\n\nPath for Bob to (3,4):\n- From (2,3): move right to (3,3) (empty) -> then move up to (3,4) but (3,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-walkable. So he cannot walk on it. He can stand next to it and face it to interact.\n\nSo from (3,3), he can face up (U) to face (3,4) and then interact to grab an onion.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 65 for Bob: R (move to (3,3), facing right) -> but after move, he faces right. Then he needs to face up.\nTurn 66: U (try to move up to (3,4) but cannot because non-walkable, so he turns to face up)\nTurn 67: I (grab an onion)\n\nThen he is holding an onion. Then he can go to a pot or kitchen counter.\n\nBut the pot at (3,0) is being filled by Alice. She will have put one onion by turn 67. We need two more.\n\nBob can bring his onion to the kitchen counter near the pot, e.g., at (5,2) or (2,2) is already occupied. Or he can try to put it in the pot himself.\n\nBut to put it in the pot, he needs to be at (3,1) or (4,1) and facing down.\n\nFrom (3,3) holding an onion:\n- Move down? (3,2) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So he cannot move down.\n- Move left to (2,3) -> then he is back.\n- Move right to (4,3) -> then down to (4,2) is blocked.\n\nSo again, he must go the long way around: (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) is blocked -> cannot. Or (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1). This is 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, he can place the onion on a kitchen counter closer, like at (3,2) but it's already occupied. Or at (4,2) occupied. Or at (5,2) empty? Yes. But how to get there from (3,3)? He would need to go to (4,3) -> (5,3) -> then face down to (5,2) and interact to place the onion. \n\nPath:\n- Turn 68: move right to (4,3)\n- Turn 69: move right to (5,3)\n- Turn 70: face down (D) to face (5,2)\n- Turn 71: interact to place the onion on (5,2)\n\nThen the onion is at (5,2), which is relatively close to the pot at (4,0) but not very close.\n\nThis is taking too many turns.\n\nGiven the time constraints, we should focus on one pot and have both players contribute to filling it.\n\nAfter turn 64:\n- Alice is holding an onion and at (2,1)\n- Bob is empty at (2,3)\n\nAt turn 65:\n- Alice: R (move to (3,1), facing right)\n- Bob: U (try to move up to (2,4) but cannot because (2,4) is kitchen counter -> so he turns to face up. But we want him to go to the onion dispenser? Or he can move left to (1,3) to start the journey to the pot area.\n\nBut let's have Bob start moving to (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) is now empty because Alice moved to (3,1) -> (3,1) is occupied by Alice, so he can go to (2,1) and then to (3,1) is occupied, so he must wait or go to (4,1) for the other pot.\n\nThis is complex.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the existing onions on the counters. For example, there is an onion at (3,2) and (4,2) and (2,2) (placed by Bob). Alice can after putting her onion in the pot, go to (3,2) to pick up the onion there? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and she would need to be at (3,1) and face up to (3,2) or at (3,3) and face down, etc.\n\nAlice after turn 67 (when she puts the onion in the pot) is at (3,1) facing down, holding nothing. Then she can move to (3,2)? But (3,2) is non-walkable. She can only interact if adjacent. She is at (3,1) and (3,2) is above her (y+1). So if she faces up, she is not facing the counter. She would need to move to a tile adjacent to (3,2) and facing it. The adjacent tiles to (3,2) are: (3,1) (below), (3,3) (above), (2,2) (left), (4,2) (right). (3,1) is below and (3,3) is above.\n\nSo at (3,1), she can face up (U) to face (3,2) which is above. Then she can interact to pick up the onion.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 68: Alice: U (face up) [since she cannot move up to (3,2) because it's non-walkable, so she turns to face up]\nTurn 69: Alice: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n\nThen she has an onion. Then she can turn around and put it in the pot:\n\nTurn 70: D (face down)\nTurn 71: I (put onion in the pot at (3,0))\n\nSo by turn 71, the pot has two onions.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can bring the third onion.\n\nThere is an onion at (4,2). Bob can be directed to get it.\n\nAfter turn 64, Bob is at (2,3) empty-handed. He can move to (3,3) and then face down to (3,2) to pick up the onion? But (3,2) has an onion, but if Alice is going to pick it up at turn 69, then it will be gone.\n\nAlternatively, there is onion at (4,2). Bob can go to (4,3) and face down to (4,2) to pick it up.\n\nPath for Bob:\nTurn 65: R (move to (3,3), facing right)\nTurn 66: R (move to (4,3), facing right)\nTurn 67: D (face down to (4,2))\nTurn 68: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n\nThen he is holding an onion. Then he can move to (4,1) to put it in the pot at (4,0) or in the same pot at (3,0)? The pot at (3,0) is the one we are filling. He can use the pot at (4,0) but that would start another soup, which is also good.\n\nBut the serving counter is at (7,2), so either pot is fine.\n\nBut let's focus on finishing one soup quickly.\n\nBob can go to (4,1) and face down to put the onion in the pot at (4,0):\n\nFrom (4,3) holding onion:\nTurn 69: D (try to move down to (4,2) -> cannot, so turn to face down)\nTurn 70: D again? But to move to (4,2) is not possible. He must go around to (4,1). How? (4,2) is blocked, so he must go to (5,3) -> (5,2) is blocked, or to (3,3) -> then down to (3,2) blocked.\n\nSo again, the only way is the long way around: (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) is blocked, cannot. Or (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1). This is many moves.\n\nAlternatively, he can put the onion on a kitchen counter near the pots, like at (5,2) if empty.\n\nTurn 69: move right to (5,3)\nTurn 70: face down (D)\nTurn 71: I (place onion on (5,2))\n\nThen later, Alice or Bob can pick it up and put it in a pot.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since we are only planning for Alice, we can plan Alice's actions and assume Bob will be controlled by someone else. But the task is to plan for Alice and optionally for Bob, but the answer format only has actions for Alice? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but the answer format only has turns for Alice.\n\nLet me check the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo only Alice's actions.\n\nTherefore, we only need to output a sequence of actions for Alice.\n\nSo at turn 64, Alice's action: I (to pick up the onion at (2,0))\n\nThen for subsequent turns, we plan for Alice to deliver that onion to the pot and then gather more.\n\nBut we have to assume Bob will do reasonable things.\n\nFor Alice:\n\nTurn 64: I (pick up onion from (2,0))\n\nThen she is at (2,1) holding onion.\n\nTurn 65: R (move right to (3,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 66: D (face down, because she cannot move down)\n\nTurn 67: I (interact with pot at (3,0) to add onion) -> pot now has 1 onion.\n\nThen she is empty-handed.\n\nTurn 68: U (face up, to face the kitchen counter at (3,2) which has an onion)\n\nTurn 69: I (pick up the onion from (3,2))\n\nThen she is holding an onion.\n\nTurn 70: D (face down)\n\nTurn 71: I (put onion in the pot at (3,0)) -> pot has 2 onions.\n\nThen she needs one more onion. There is one at (4,2). She can go to (4,1) and face up to (4,2) to pick it up.\n\nFrom (3,1) after turn 71, she is at (3,1) facing down.\n\nTurn 72: R (move to (4,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 73: U (face up to (4,2))\n\nTurn 74: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n\nThen she has an onion.\n\nTurn 75: D (face down)\n\nTurn 76: I (put in the pot at (4,0)? But the pot at (4,0) is empty. We are filling the pot at (3,0). To put in (3,0), she must be at (3,1) and face down. But she is at (4,1). \n\nShe can move left to (3,1):\n\nTurn 76: L (move left to (3,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 77: D (face down) [if not already facing down? After move left, she faces left]\n\nTurn 78: I (put in the pot at (3,0)) -> now the pot has 3 onions and cooking starts.\n\nThen after 5 turns, the soup is ready at turn 64 + 78 + 5 = turn 147, but we are only planning for a few turns. H is not specified, but we are to plan for several turns. Let's say we plan for 15 turns.\n\nBut the cooking takes 5 turns, so during that time, Alice can get plates and be ready to serve.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nAlice at (3,1) after turn 78.\n\nShe needs to get a plate: go to (0,2).\n\nPath: (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) is kitchen counter, non-walkable. So she must go up? (3,1) to (3,2) not walkable. So to (2,1) -> (1,1) -> then to (0,1) not walkable. Then how to reach (0,2)? (0,2) is a plate dispenser, non-walkable. She must be adjacent to interact.\n\nThe adjacent tiles to (0,2) are: (0,1) (below), (0,3) (above), (1,2) (right). (0,1) and (0,3) are kitchen counters, non-walkable. (1,2) is empty? Yes. So she can go to (1,2) and face left to (0,2).\n\nFrom (1,1) she can move up to (1,2) (empty).\n\nSo from (3,1):\n- Move left to (2,1)\n- Move left to (1,1)\n- Move up to (1,2)\n- Face left (L) to face (0,2)\n- Interact to grab a plate.\n\nThen she can go back to the pot to serve the soup.\n\nBut this is many turns.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are only to plan for Alice for the next several turns (say 10-15 turns), and at turn 64, we can plan for 10 turns.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 64: I (pick up onion at (2,0))\nTurn 65: R (move to (3,1))\nTurn 66: D (face down)\nTurn 67: I (put onion in pot at (3,0))\nTurn 68: U (face up)\nTurn 69: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\nTurn 70: D (face down)\nTurn 71: I (put onion in pot at (3,0))  // now 2 onions in pot\nTurn 72: R (move to (4,1))\nTurn 73: U (face up)\nTurn 74: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n\nThen she has an onion and the pot at (3,0) has 2 onions. She can put this onion in the pot at (3,0) or start on the other pot.\n\nTurn 75: L (move left to (3,1))\nTurn 76: D (face down)\nTurn 77: I (put in pot at (3,0)) // now 3 onions, cooking starts\n\nThen for the next turns, she can get a plate.\n\nBut we are at turn 64+13 = turn 77. We can stop or plan a few more.\n\nBut the planning horizon H is not specified. Let's assume H=10 turns from t1=64, so up to turn 74.\n\nSo for 10 turns:\n\nTurn 64: I\nTurn 65: R\nTurn 66: D\nTurn 67: I\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: I\nTurn 70: D\nTurn 71: I\nTurn 72: R\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: I\n\nThis is 11 actions (turns 64 to 74 inclusive).\n\nSince turn 64 is the first action, and we want up to turn 64+H-1. If H=10, then from turn 64 to turn 73 (10 actions). But the problem says: plan a sequence for the next several turns, say H turns. It doesn't specify H, so we can choose.\n\nAlternatively, output until she has put the second onion in the pot.\n\nBut in the above, at turn 71 she puts the second onion.\n\nSo turns 64 to 71: 8 turns.\n\nThen she can be directed to get the third onion.\n\nBut in the interest of time, we'll plan for 10 turns as above.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: I\nTurn 65: R\nTurn 66: D\nTurn 67: I\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: I\nTurn 70: D\nTurn 71: I\nTurn 72: R\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: I\n}\n\nThis assumes that the onion at (3,2) and (4,2) are still there. Given that Bob might take them, but we have to assume they are there or that Alice can get them.\n\nIf in practice they are taken, Alice can adapt.\n\nBut for the plan, this is a reasonable start.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice should focus on filling the pot at (3,0) with onions, as it is the closest pot and requires 3 onions for Recipe 1 (reward 20). The current game state has onions available on kitchen counters at (3,2) and (4,2), and Alice can efficiently gather these after depositing her initial onion. The sequence optimizes Alice's path and interactions to minimize turns, assuming Bob may assist independently (e.g., by gathering additional onions or plates).\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (turns 64 to 74):\n- **Turn 64 (t₁): I**  \n  Alice interacts with the kitchen counter at (2,0) (facing down) to pick up an onion. She is now holding an onion.\n\n- **Turn 65: R**  \n  Alice moves right to (3,1) and faces right. This positions her adjacent to the pot at (3,0).\n\n- **Turn 66: D**  \n  Alice faces down (unable to move down to (3,0) as it is non-walkable) to orient toward the pot.\n\n- **Turn 67: I**  \n  Alice interacts with the pot at (3,0) (facing down) to add the onion. The pot now has 1 onion, and she is empty-handed.\n\n- **Turn 68: U**  \n  Alice faces up (unable to move up to (3,2)) to orient toward the kitchen counter at (3,2), which has an onion.\n\n- **Turn 69: I**  \n  Alice interacts with the kitchen counter at (3,2) (facing up) to pick up an onion. She is now holding an onion.\n\n- **Turn 70: D**  \n  Alice faces down to reorient toward the pot at (3,0).\n\n- **Turn 71: I**  \n  Alice interacts with the pot at (3,0) (facing down) to add the onion. The pot now has 2 onions.\n\n- **Turn 72: R**  \n  Alice moves right to (4,1) and faces right. This positions her adjacent to the kitchen counter at (4,2).\n\n- **Turn 73: U**  \n  Alice faces up (unable to move up to (4,2)) to orient toward the kitchen counter at (4,2), which has an onion.\n\n- **Turn 74: I**  \n  Alice interacts with the kitchen counter at (4,2) (facing up) to pick up an onion. She is now holding a third onion for the pot.\n\n### Next Steps (beyond turn 74):\n- Alice should return to (3,1) (move left) and face down to add the third onion to the pot at (3,0), starting the 5-turn cooking process.\n- While the soup cooks, Alice can fetch a plate from the dispenser at (0,2) and return to serve the soup at the serving counter (7,2) for 20 reward.\n- Bob can independently gather onions from dispensers or counters to fill the second pot at (4,0), leveraging existing onions (e.g., at (2,2), (5,4), (6,4), or (7,1)).\n\nThis sequence ensures Alice efficiently uses nearby resources, minimizes movement, and sets up for soup completion. Coordination with Bob is implicit (e.g., he might fill the pot faster using counters like (2,2)).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 64: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 65: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 66: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 67: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 68: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 69: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 70: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 71: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{I}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current game state and plan actions for Alice to maximize the reward from delivering soup recipes. The recipe given is for 3 onions, which takes 5 turns to cook and gives a 20-point reward. There are no tomato dispensers, so we can only make onion soup.\n\nKey elements from the game state:\n\n- Alice is at (3,1), facing down (D), holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (3,3), facing up (U), holding nothing.\n- Pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), both empty.\n- Serving counter is at (7,2).\n- Onion dispensers are at (3,4) and (4,4).\n- Plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n- Kitchen counters have onions on several tiles: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2), (4,2), (2,0), (2,2). But players can interact with kitchen counters to pick up or place items.\n\nAlice and Bob need to work together to get onions into a pot, let it cook, then serve it using a plate.\n\nCooking time is 5 turns for the onion soup recipe. Once three onions are in a pot, it starts cooking automatically.\n\nPlayers can carry only one item at a time.\n\nTo interact with something, a player must be on an adjacent empty tile and facing the tile.\n\nLet me sketch a map based on the tile types:\n\n- Grid is probably 8x5 or something? Let's list all positions:\n\nKitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\nOnion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n\nPlate dispenser: (0,2)\n\nPots: (3,0), (4,0)\n\nServing counter: (7,2)\n\nNow, current positions:\n\nAlice: (3,1) facing D\n\nBob: (3,3) facing U\n\nKitchen counters with onions: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2), (4,2), (2,0), (2,2)\n\n(3,2) and (4,2) have onions, and they are kitchen counters. Alice is at (3,1), which is above (3,2). Since she's facing down, and (3,2) is directly below her, she might be able to interact with it if she's adjacent and facing it.\n\nLet's confirm adjacency. (3,1) and (3,2) are adjacent vertically. Alice is at (3,1) facing D, which is towards (3,2). So she should be able to interact with the kitchen counter at (3,2) since it has an onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3) facing U, so he could interact with (3,2) if he moves or faces it, but (3,2) is below him? Positions: (3,3) is at y=3, (3,2) is at y=2, so if Bob is facing up, that's towards higher y, so towards (3,4), not (3,2). Facing U means north, I assume y increases up? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n\nThe move actions: L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y), U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1). So U increases y, D decreases y. So (0,0) is probably bottom-left, with y increasing up.\n\nIn standard coordinates, y+1 might be up or down; here U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning higher y is north.\n\nSo Alice at (3,1) facing D (down, y-1), so towards (3,0).\n\nBob at (3,3) facing U (up, y+1), so towards (3,4).\n\nNow, kitchen counter at (3,2) has an onion. Alice is at (3,1), which is directly above (3,2)? y=1 is above y=2? No.\n\ny=1 and y=2: if y increases up, then y=1 is below y=2. Let's think:\n\n- (x,y): U increases y, so higher y is north.\n\nSo (3,1) is south of (3,2) because y=1 < y=2.\n\nAlice at (3,1) facing D (down, decreasing y), so she is facing south, towards lower y. But (3,2) is north of her, at higher y.\n\nTo interact with (3,2), which is directly north, she needs to be facing north (U), but she is facing south (D). So she cannot interact with it directly now.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (3,3) facing U (north), so he is facing (3,4), which is an onion dispenser.\n\nBut (3,2) is south of Bob, at lower y.\n\nFor Alice to interact with (3,2): she is at (3,1), which is adjacent to (3,2) since same x, y differs by 1. But to interact, she needs to be on an empty tile adjacent to the target and facing it.\n\n(3,1) is her position, which is empty I assume? Players can be on empty tiles.\n\nThe tile she is on is empty, I think, since she's standing there.\n\nThe target is (3,2), which is a kitchen counter with an item, so it's non-empty.\n\nTo interact with (3,2), she needs to be on a tile adjacent to it and facing it. Adjacent tiles to (3,2) are (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2).\n\n(3,1) is directly south, (3,3) north, (2,2) west, (4,2) east.\n\nAlice is on (3,1), which is adjacent to (3,2). But she is facing down (south), away from (3,2), which is north. So she is not facing (3,2); she is facing away. Therefore, she cannot interact with it right now. She needs to change orientation to face north.\n\nThe action \"Change Orientation\" allows her to change facing without moving, if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty? No, let's read.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it means that when you try to change orientation, if you also try to move, but for orientation change, it might not move if the tile isn't empty, but orientation change should just change facing without moving, I think.\n\nRe-reading: \"Each player can: Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when you move, you change both position and orientation to the direction you moved.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This seems poorly worded.\n\nI think \"Change Orientation\" is a separate action that only changes facing, without moving, but the condition \"no move if adjacent tile not empty\" might be a mistake.\n\nLooking back: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nPerhaps it means that if you use Change Orientation, you don't move, and it changes your orientation, but the \"no move if...\" part might be for the move action? I think there's confusion.\n\nLet me read the action definitions again.\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\nSo when you move, you go to the adjacent tile in that direction and face that direction.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous. I think it means that Change Orientation is an action that changes your orientation to the specified direction without moving, but only if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty? That doesn't make sense for orientation change.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo or misphrasing. In many games, changing orientation doesn't depend on the adjacent tile; it just changes facing.\n\nBut here it says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one,\" which suggests that for orientation change, it might attempt to move but doesn't if tile not empty, but that contradicts the name \"Change Orientation.\"\n\nI think it's better to interpret based on common sense. Probably, \"Change Orientation\" allows you to face a different direction without moving, regardless of adjacent tiles. The \"no move if...\" might be a mistake or for something else.\n\nLet me read the full sentence: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nPerhaps it means that for the orientation change action, if the adjacent tile in the new direction is not empty, you don't move (but you still change orientation?), but since it's orientation change, you shouldn't move at all.\n\nI think this is confusing. In the context, for Interact, it requires being adjacent and facing, so orientation matters.\n\nTo simplify, I'll assume that \"Change Orientation\" action changes only the facing, without moving, and it doesn't care about adjacent tiles. The \"no move if...\" might be a red herring or misstated.\n\nPerhaps for orientation change, if you specify a direction, and the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, you might move, but the action says \"Change Orientation\" not \"Move or Change\".\n\nI think it's safer to assume that Change Orientation only changes facing, no move.\n\nSimilarly, for Move, it changes position and orientation.\n\nFor Interact, it requires being on an empty tile adjacent to the target and facing it.\n\nBack to Alice.\n\nAlice at (3,1) facing D (south). She wants to interact with (3,2), which is north. So she needs to face north. She can use Change Orientation to U to face up.\n\nThen, she can Interact to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, Bob can do things.\n\nAlso, there are many onions on kitchen counters, so we can use those instead of going to dispensers, saving time.\n\nThe goal is to make onion soup and serve it.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0), both empty.\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nCooking time 5 turns.\n\nSince we start at turn 67, and we need to plan actions for Alice for the next H turns. H is not specified, but since cooking takes 5 turns, we need at least that many turns to cook and serve, so H should be around 10 or so to complete a soup.\n\nBut we need to coordinate with Bob.\n\nFirst, let's list available onions on counters: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2), (4,2), (2,0), (2,2)\n\n(3,2) and (4,2) are close to Alice and Bob.\n\nAlice at (3,1), Bob at (3,3).\n\n(3,2) is directly between them.\n\nAlice can pick up onion from (3,2) by facing north and interacting.\n\nSimilarly, Bob could pick up from (4,2) or others.\n\nBut let's think about the pots.\n\nPots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nTo put an onion in a pot, a player needs to be holding an onion, be adjacent to the pot, and facing it.\n\nFor example, to access pot at (3,0), adjacent tiles are (3,1), (2,0), (4,0)? Let's see.\n\n(3,0) has adjacent tiles: north (3,1), south? y-1, but y=0, probably bottom, so no south. West (2,0), east (4,0).\n\n(2,0) and (4,0) are kitchen counters, and (3,1) is empty? (3,1) is where Alice is, but she is on it, so it's occupied? No, players can be on empty tiles, and the tile is empty when no item, but player is on it.\n\nFor interaction, the player needs to be on an empty tile adjacent to the target.\n\nSo for pot at (3,0), adjacent empty tiles are (3,1), and also (2,0) and (4,0) but (2,0) and (4,0) are kitchen counters, which are non-empty if they have items, but in terms of tile type, kitchen counter is a tile that can have items, but for adjacency, it is a tile.\n\nThe pot is at (3,0), so to interact with it, a player must be on a tile adjacent to (3,0) and facing (3,0).\n\nAdjacent tiles to (3,0) are: (3,1) to the north, (2,0) to the west, and (4,0) to the east.\n\n(2,0) is a kitchen counter, and it has an onion, so it's occupied, meaning a player cannot stand on it because it's not empty. Similarly, (4,0) is a kitchen counter, but from the list, (4,0) is not listed as having an item; only specific kitchen counters have onions listed.\n\n\"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" lists: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2), (4,2), (2,0), (2,2). So (2,0) has an onion, so it's occupied. (4,0) is not listed, so it might be empty, meaning no item, so a player can stand on it? But kitchen counter is a tile type, not necessarily empty.\n\nTile types: Empty tile is walkable, Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter are specific tiles.\n\nPlayers can walk on empty tiles, but not on non-empty tiles like dispensers, pots, etc., unless specified.\n\nFrom constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But non-empty tiles refer to tiles with items or fixed objects?\n\nLet's read: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\"\n\nDispensers, Pots, etc., are not empty; they are fixed objects.\n\nKitchen Counter: it can be empty or have an item. If it has an item, it is non-empty and cannot be walked on. If empty, it can be walked on? But the tile type is Kitchen Counter, which is not an Empty Tile.\n\nI think there's a distinction between tile types and whether they are occupied.\n\nTile types:\n- Empty Tile: walkable, no item.\n- Dispensers: source for items, fixed, cannot be walked on.\n- Pot: fixed, cannot be walked on.\n- Serving Counter: fixed, cannot be walked on.\n- Kitchen Counter: can have items placed on it; if no item, it might be walkable? But the description says \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nAlso, for interaction, to pick up from kitchen counter, player must be adjacent and facing.\n\nBut can a player stand on a kitchen counter if it has no item? The text doesn't specify.\n\nLet's assume that only Empty Tiles are walkable, and all other tile types (Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter) are not walkable, meaning players cannot stand on them. They can only be adjacent to interact.\n\nFor example, to interact with a pot, player must be on an adjacent empty tile.\n\nSimilarly for kitchen counter.\n\nIn this case, for pot at (3,0), the adjacent tiles are (3,1), (2,0), (4,0).\n\n(3,1) is an empty tile? What is the tile type at (3,1)?\n\nThe tile types are not fully listed; only the special tiles are given.\n\nFor example, kitchen counters are listed at positions, so other positions might be empty tiles.\n\nLet's infer the grid.\n\nList all positions with non-empty tiles or special.\n\nBut we have coordinates; probably the grid is from (0,0) to (7,4) or something.\n\nKitchen counters at: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\nOnion dispensers at (3,4), (4,4)\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2)\n\nPots at (3,0), (4,0)\n\nServing counter at (7,2)\n\nAlice at (3,1), Bob at (3,3)\n\n(3,1) is not in the kitchen counter list, so it might be an empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is not listed, so empty tile.\n\n(3,2) is a kitchen counter with onion, so not walkable.\n\nFor pot at (3,0), adjacent tiles:\n- North: (3,1) - empty tile, Alice is there\n- West: (2,0) - kitchen counter with onion, not walkable\n- East: (4,0) - kitchen counter, but not listed as having item, so it might be empty, but since it's a kitchen counter tile, it's not walkable. Kitchen counter is a tile type that is not empty, so players cannot stand on it.\n\nTherefore, the only adjacent tile to pot (3,0) that is walkable is (3,1).\n\nSimilarly for other pots and objects.\n\nSo for pot (3,0), players can only access it from (3,1) by facing down (south).\n\nSimilarly, for pot (4,0), adjacent walkable tile might be (4,1), but (4,1) is not specified; let's see if it's empty.\n\n(4,1) not in any list, so probably empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is empty, as Alice is there.\n\nBack to Alice.\n\nAlice at (3,1) facing D (south). Since she is on (3,1), which is adjacent to pot (3,0) to the south, and she is facing south, she can interact with the pot right now.\n\nThe pot is empty, so if she has an ingredient, she can add it, but she has nothing.\n\nShe can also interact with (3,2) to the north, but she is not facing north.\n\nFirst, she needs an item.\n\nThere is a kitchen counter at (3,2) with an onion, which is north of her.\n\nTo interact with it, she needs to face north.\n\nSo for Alice, at turn t1=67, she can:\n\n- Change orientation to U to face north, then she can interact to pick up the onion from (3,2).\n\nSince she is at (3,1), and (3,2) is adjacent north, facing north allows interact.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3) facing U (north). He is on (3,3), which is empty tile.\n\nHe can interact with things.\n\nFor example, (3,2) is south of him, so he could face south and interact, but (3,2) has an onion, and he has nothing, so he could pick it up if he faces south.\n\nBut Alice is closer to (3,2), so she can get it.\n\nThere are other onions.\n\nAlso, Bob is at (3,3), facing U, towards (3,4), which is an onion dispenser. But (3,4) is an onion dispenser, so he can grab an onion from there if he interacts.\n\nSince he is at (3,3), facing U, and (3,4) is adjacent north, he can interact to grab an onion from the dispenser.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4).\n\nBut there are onions on counters, so it might be faster to use those.\n\nBut dispensers are also sources.\n\nLet's plan to make a soup.\n\nWe need to put three onions into a pot.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nAlice can get an onion from (3,2) and put it into the pot at (3,0).\n\nSimilarly, Bob can get another onion.\n\nBut we need three.\n\nAlso, after cooking, we need a plate to serve.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nServing at (7,2).\n\nCooking time 5 turns.\n\nSince we start at turn 67, if we start cooking now, it finishes at turn 72, then serve.\n\nBut we need to have the pot filled.\n\nCurrently, both pots empty.\n\nAlice can immediately start by picking up the onion from (3,2).\n\nTo do that, she needs to face north.\n\nSo at turn 67, Alice can change orientation to U.\n\nThen at turn 68, she can interact to pick up the onion from (3,2).\n\nNow, she is holding an onion.\n\nThen, she can turn south or move to access the pot.\n\nShe is at (3,1), facing north after interact? After picking up, she is still at (3,1), facing whatever she was, but after interact, orientation might stay the same.\n\nTypically in such games, orientation doesn't change after interact.\n\nSo after picking up, she is at (3,1), facing north.\n\nBut to access pot at (3,0), she needs to face south.\n\nSo she can change orientation to D.\n\nThen interact with pot to add the onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can do something.\n\nBut Bob is at (3,3), facing U. He can interact with the onion dispenser at (3,4) to grab an onion.\n\n(3,4) is adjacent north, he is facing it, so he can interact to grab an onion.\n\nThen he can go south to add to a pot.\n\nBut let's coordinate.\n\nThere is another onion at (4,2), which is a kitchen counter.\n\n(4,2) is adjacent to (4,1) and (4,3), etc.\n\nAlice can handle one pot, Bob another, but we only need one soup for now, since reward is per soup.\n\nBut we can make multiple, but let's start with one.\n\nTo save time, Alice can use the onion from (3,2), put into pot (3,0).\n\nThen we need two more onions.\n\nBob can get one from (3,4) or from (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is closer to Alice or Bob?\n\nAlice is at (3,1), (4,2) is east and north.\n\nBob at (3,3), (4,2) is east and south.\n\nAlso, there is onion at (4,2), kitchen counter.\n\nIf Bob moves to (4,3) or something.\n\nBut let's list actions.\n\nFirst, for Alice at turn 67:\n\n- She is at (3,1) facing D. To pick up from (3,2), she needs to face U.\n\nSo action for turn 67: Change orientation to U. (action U for change orientation? But U can be move or orientation change?\n\nThe actions are: Move (L/R/U/D), Change Orientation (L/R/U/D), Interact (I), Stay (S).\n\nSo for Change Orientation, we specify the direction to face.\n\nSo Alice can do Change Orientation U to face up.\n\nThen, at turn 68, she can Interact to pick up onion from (3,2).\n\nNow holding onion, at (3,1), facing U? After change orientation, she is facing U, then interact, she might still face U.\n\nThen, to add to pot (3,0), she needs to face D. So at turn 69, Change orientation D to face down.\n\nThen at turn 70, Interact with pot to add onion.\n\nNow pot at (3,0) has one onion.\n\nWe need two more.\n\nBob can contribute.\n\nBob is at (3,3), facing U. He can Interact with onion dispenser at (3,4) since he is adjacent and facing it.\n\nAt turn 67, Bob can Interact to grab an onion from (3,4).\n\nThen he has an onion.\n\nNow, to add to a pot, he can go to (3,2) or directly to (3,1) but (3,2) is occupied with kitchen counter, cannot stand on.\n\nTo access pot (3,0), he needs to be at (3,1) and face south.\n\nBut Alice is at (3,1), and players cannot be on the same tile.\n\nSo only one player can be at (3,1) at a time.\n\nSimilarly for other pots.\n\nPot (4,0) is available.\n\nBob can add to pot (4,0).\n\nFirst, Bob at (3,3) after grabbing onion, he needs to go to a position to access a pot.\n\nFor pot (4,0), adjacent tile is (4,1), which should be empty.\n\n(4,1) not listed, so empty tile.\n\nBob is at (3,3), he needs to move to (4,1).\n\nPath: from (3,3) to (4,1).\n\nHe can move right to (4,3), then down to (4,2)? But (4,2) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\nSo he cannot go to (4,2).\n\nHe can go down to (3,2)? (3,2) not walkable.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move right to (4,3), assuming (4,3) is empty.\n\n(4,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nThen from (4,3), move down to (4,2)? No, (4,2) not walkable.\n\nHe needs to go to (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (4,1): directly? Not adjacent.\n\nHe can go to (3,2) but not walkable.\n\nSo he must go via other tiles.\n\nFor example, move right to (4,3) — at (3,3), move R to (4,3), facing east.\n\nThen from (4,3), he can move down to (4,2)? But (4,2) is kitchen counter, cannot move onto it.\n\nMove to (5,3) or something, but better to go to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at y=1, x=4.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down to (4,2) only if walkable, but not.\n\nHe can move left to (3,3) but already there.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down? No, (4,2) not walkable.\n\nPerhaps move to (5,3), then down to (5,2), but (5,2) is kitchen counter, has no item? (5,2) is in kitchen counter list, but not listed with item, so it might be empty, but since it's kitchen counter tile, it's not walkable.\n\nKitchen counter tiles are not walkable, regardless of having item or not.\n\nOnly empty tiles are walkable.\n\nSo from (4,3), adjacent tiles: north (4,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable; south (4,2) kitchen counter, not walkable; west (3,3); east (5,3) — (5,3) not listed, so empty? But (5,3) might be empty tile.\n\nList: (0,3) is kitchen counter, (7,3) kitchen counter, so (5,3) not listed, so empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) empty.\n\nSo Bob at (4,3), he can move east to (5,3), or west to (3,3), or down? No down, since (4,2) not walkable.\n\nTo reach (4,1), he needs to go around.\n\nFor example, go to (5,3), then down to (5,2)? (5,2) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nGo to (3,3), then down to (3,2)? Not walkable.\n\nThe only way to access (4,1) might be from above or sides, but (4,1) has adjacent: north (4,2) not walkable, south? (4,0) kitchen counter, not walkable, west (3,1), east (5,1).\n\n(3,1) is where Alice is, (5,1) might be empty.\n\n(5,1) not listed, so empty tile.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), from north is blocked, from south is pot or counter, so only from west or east.\n\nFrom (3,1) or (5,1).\n\n(3,1) is occupied by Alice now.\n\n(5,1) can be accessed.\n\nBob at (3,3), he can move to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (5,2)? (5,2) kitchen counter, not walkable, so cannot move down from (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,3), he can move down only if (5,2) walkable, not.\n\nPerhaps move to (5,4), but (5,4) is kitchen counter with onion? (5,4) has onion, not walkable.\n\nList: kitchen counters with onions include (5,4), so not walkable.\n\nBob can go to (4,3), then to (3,3), etc., but stuck.\n\nTo reach (4,1), he needs to go via (3,1) or (5,1).\n\nSince Alice is at (3,1), he can go to (5,1).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (5,1): for example, move right to (4,3), then right to (5,3), then down? Cannot, so move to (6,3) or something.\n\n(6,3) not listed, so empty.\n\nBut let's find a path.\n\nFrom (3,3) move R to (4,3)\n\nFrom (4,3) move R to (5,3)\n\nFrom (5,3) move U? to (5,4), but (5,4) kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\nMove D to (5,2)? not walkable.\n\nMove R to (6,3) — (6,3) empty?\n\nThen from (6,3) move D to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed, kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), etc., not (6,2), so (6,2) might be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) empty, then move to (6,1), etc.\n\nBut it's far.\n\nFor pot (4,0), the access point is (4,1).\n\n(4,1) can be reached from (3,1) or (5,1) or from above, but above (4,2) not walkable, so only from west or east.\n\n(3,1) is one, (5,1) is another.\n\n(5,1) is empty.\n\nBob can go to (5,1) to access pot (4,0).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (5,1): he can move east to (4,3), then east to (5,3), then south to (5,2)? not possible, so he needs to go to (6,3) or something, then down.\n\nFrom (5,3) move R to (6,3) — (6,3) empty.\n\nThen from (6,3) move D to (6,2) — assume empty.\n\nThen from (6,2) move D to (6,1) — (6,1) not listed, so empty.\n\nThen from (6,1) move L to (5,1) — (5,1) empty.\n\nThen at (5,1), he can face west to interact with pot (4,0).\n\nBut this is many moves.\n\nSince there is an onion at (4,2), which is close, but (4,2) is kitchen counter with onion, so Bob can pick it up if he is adjacent and facing.\n\nBob at (3,3), he can move to (4,3), then face south to interact with (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is south of (4,3), so if he is at (4,3) facing S, he can interact with kitchen counter (4,2) to pick up the onion.\n\nThen he has an onion.\n\nThen he can go to (4,1) to add to pot, but (4,1) is below, but not directly accessible; he needs to go to (5,1) or (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3), he can go to (5,3), etc to (5,1).\n\nBut it's easier to use the onion he has and add to a pot that Alice is not using.\n\nAlice is using pot (3,0), so Bob can use pot (4,0).\n\nBut accessing (4,0) requires being at (4,1).\n\n(4,1) can be reached from (3,1) or (5,1).\n\n(3,1) is occupied.\n\nSo Bob can go to (5,1).\n\nFrom his position.\n\nFirst, let's define actions for Alice.\n\nAt turn 67: Alice change orientation to U (face north)\n\nTurn 68: Alice interact with (3,2) to pick up onion. Now holding onion, at (3,1), facing U.\n\nTurn 69: Alice change orientation to D (face south)\n\nTurn 70: Alice interact with pot (3,0) to add onion. Now pot has one onion, Alice holding nothing.\n\nWe need two more onions for the pot.\n\nBob can get one.\n\nBob at turn 67: he is at (3,3) facing U, so he can interact with onion dispenser at (3,4) to grab an onion. Action: Interact.\n\nTurn 67: Bob I, grabbing onion from dispenser, now holding onion.\n\nThen he needs to add it to a pot.\n\nHe can add to pot (4,0).\n\nTo do that, he needs to be at (4,1) or other access point, but only (4,1) is available.\n\nSo he needs to move to (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,3) holding onion, move to (4,3): action Move R to (4,3), facing east.\n\nThen from (4,3), he can move to (5,3): Move R to (5,3), facing east.\n\nThen from (5,3), move to (6,3): Move R to (6,3), facing east.\n\nThen from (6,3), move down to (6,2): Move D to (6,2), facing south.\n\n(6,2) is empty? Yes.\n\nThen from (6,2), move down to (6,1): Move D to (6,1), facing south.\n\nThen from (6,1), move left to (5,1): Move L to (5,1), facing west.\n\nNow at (5,1), he can face west to interact with pot (4,0), but he is at (5,1), facing west after move, so he is facing (4,1)? (4,1) is west of (5,1), but pot is at (4,0), which is south-west? Not directly adjacent.\n\n(5,1) is adjacent to (4,1) west, (5,0) south, (5,2) north, (6,1) east.\n\n(5,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(5,2) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo (5,1) adjacent to (4,1) west.\n\n(4,1) is empty tile, and it is adjacent to pot (4,0) south.\n\nBut Bob is at (5,1), to interact with pot (4,0), he needs to be on a tile adjacent to (4,0), which is only (4,1), as we said.\n\nHe is not on (4,1), he is on (5,1).\n\nSo he needs to move to (4,1).\n\nFrom (5,1), move west to (4,1): Move L to (4,1), facing west.\n\nNow at (4,1), he can face south to interact with pot (4,0).\n\nSo he needs to change orientation to D or move down, but moving down to (4,0) not possible, so change orientation to D.\n\nThen interact.\n\nBut this is many turns.\n\nSince there is an onion at (4,2), which is close to (4,3), Bob can pick that up instead.\n\nAt turn 67, Bob is at (3,3) facing U.\n\nInstead of interacting with dispenser, he can move to (4,3) first.\n\nTurn 67: Bob Move R to (4,3), now at (4,3), facing east.\n\nThen at turn 68, he can change orientation to S (south) to face (4,2).\n\nThen interact to pick up onion from kitchen counter (4,2).\n\nThen he has onion, at (4,3).\n\nThen he can go to (4,1) via similar path, but (4,1) is below, not directly accessible.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,1): no direct path, need to go around.\n\nSame issue.\n\nPerhaps Alice and Bob can both use the same pot, but only one can access at a time.\n\nFor pot (3,0), only (3,1) can access.\n\nAlice is there, but after she adds the onion, she moves away, then Bob can come.\n\nAfter Alice adds onion at turn 70, she is at (3,1), holding nothing.\n\nShe can move away to let Bob add another onion.\n\nFor example, Alice can move to (2,1) or (4,1), etc.\n\n(2,1) not listed, might be empty.\n\n(4,1) empty.\n\nSay Alice moves east to (4,1) at turn 71.\n\nThen Bob can come to (3,1) to add onion.\n\nBut Bob is far.\n\nBob can get an onion quickly.\n\nAnother idea: Bob can pick up the onion from (4,2) as I said.\n\nLet's timeline.\n\nTurn 67:\nAlice: Change Orientation U (to face north)\nBob: Move R to (4,3)  // now at (4,3) facing east\n\nTurn 68:\nAlice: Interact with (3,2) to pick up onion. Holding onion, at (3,1) facing north? After interact, orientation unchanged, so facing U.\nBob: Change Orientation S (to face south) to face (4,2)\n\nTurn 69:\nAlice: Change Orientation D (to face south) to face pot\nBob: Interact with (4,2) to pick up onion. Holding onion, at (4,3) facing S.\n\nTurn 70:\nAlice: Interact with pot (3,0) to add onion. Pot now has 1 onion. Alice holding nothing, at (3,1) facing D.\nBob: Needs to go to (3,1) to add to same pot, but Alice is there.\n\nSo Alice can move away at turn 71.\n\nTurn 71: Alice Move R to (4,1)  // for example, to (4,1), facing east.\n\nNow (3,1) empty.\n\nBob at (4,3) holding onion, needs to go to (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,3) to (3,1): directly not adjacent.\n\nMove west to (3,3): Move L to (3,3), facing west.\n\nThen from (3,3) move down to (3,2)? not possible.\n\nMove to (3,3), then to (2,3) or something.\n\n(2,3) not listed, might be empty.\n\nFrom (3,3) move L to (2,3), facing west.\n\nThen from (2,3) move D to (2,2)? (2,2) kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\nMove to (2,3), then to (2,4)? (2,4) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo from (3,3), he can only move to (4,3) or (3,4) but (3,4) not walkable, or (2,3) if empty.\n\nAssume (2,3) empty.\n\nThen from (2,3), he can move down to (2,2)? not possible.\n\nThe only way to (3,1) is from (3,2) but not walkable, or from sides.\n\n(3,1) has adjacent: north (3,2) not walkable, south (3,0) not walkable, west (2,1), east (4,1).\n\n(2,1) and (4,1) are access points.\n\n(4,1) is where Alice is going.\n\nBob can go to (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) might be occupied.\n\nLet's say Alice moves to (4,1) at turn 71.\n\nThen (3,1) is free.\n\nBob at (4,3) holding onion, he can move west to (3,3): Move L to (3,3), facing west.\n\nThen from (3,3) move down? Cannot, so move to (2,3): Move L to (2,3), facing west.\n\nThen from (2,3) move down to (2,2)? not possible.\n\nFrom (2,3) move down to (2,1) if possible, but not adjacent.\n\n(2,3) to (2,2) not, to (2,1) not adjacent.\n\nPositions: (2,3) to (2,2) is south, but (2,2) not walkable.\n\nSo he can move to (1,3) or (2,4), but not down.\n\nTo reach (2,1), he needs to go via (1,1) or (3,1), but (3,1) is the target.\n\nFrom (2,3) move left to (1,3) if empty.\n\n(1,3) not listed, kitchen counters at (0,3), (7,3), so (1,3) might be empty.\n\nThen from (1,3) move down to (1,2)? (1,2) not listed, might be empty.\n\nThen from (1,2) move down to (1,1)? (1,1) not listed, might be empty.\n\nThen from (1,1) move right to (2,1)? (2,1) empty.\n\nThen at (2,1), he can face east to interact with (3,1)? (3,1) is the tile, but he needs to interact with the pot.\n\nPot is at (3,0), from (2,1), he is not adjacent to (3,0).\n\n(2,1) adjacent to (2,0), (2,2), (1,1), (3,1).\n\n(2,0) is kitchen counter with onion, (2,2) kitchen counter with onion, (1,1) empty, (3,1) empty.\n\nTo interact with pot (3,0), he needs to be on (3,1) and face south.\n\nSo he must be on (3,1).\n\nBob needs to get to (3,1).\n\nFrom his position, the shortest way is through (3,2) but not possible, so from (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,4) not, so to (2,3) to (2,2) not, so he must go down to lower y.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) move to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1), but (4,1) and (3,1) may be occupied.\n\nThis is taking too many turns.\n\nPerhaps use the other onion sources.\n\nThere is an onion at (2,0), but (2,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so player can pick it up from adjacent.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) or (3,0) but (3,0) not walkable, so from (2,1) or (1,0) etc.\n\nBut far.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can put one onion, then Bob puts one in the same pot, but Alice needs to move away.\n\nAfter Alice adds at turn 70, she moves at turn 71 to (4,1).\n\nThen Bob can go to (3,1).\n\nBut how does Bob get there quickly?\n\nBob is at (4,3) at turn 70.\n\nTurn 70: Bob at (4,3) holding onion.\n\nHe can move west to (3,3): Move L to (3,3), facing west.\n\nTurn 71: from (3,3), he can move to (3,2) not, so move to (2,3) or (4,3), but let's say he moves to (2,3): Move L to (2,3), facing west.\n\nThen turn 72: from (2,3), move to (2,4) not, or (1,3): Move L to (1,3), facing west.\n\nThen turn 73: move down to (1,2): Move D to (1,2), facing south.\n\nTurn 74: move down to (1,1): Move D to (1,1), facing south.\n\nTurn 75: move right to (2,1): Move R to (2,1), facing east.\n\nTurn 76: move right to (3,1): Move R to (3,1), facing east.\n\nNow at (3,1), he can change orientation to D to face south, then interact with pot to add onion.\n\nBut this is many turns, and the pot has only one onion so far, cooking not started.\n\nWe need three onions.\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nUse the onion on (7,1) or others, but farther.\n\nPerhaps both players can work on different tasks.\n\nSince there are many onions on counters, Alice can add one, then pick up another from nearby and add.\n\nAfter Alice adds at turn 70, she is at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nThere is onion at (2,2) or (4,2), but (2,2) is kitchen counter at (2,2), onion there.\n\nAlice at (3,1), she can move to (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nSay move to (2,1): Move L to (2,1), facing west.\n\nThen at (2,1), she can face north to interact with (2,2)? (2,2) is north of (2,1), so change orientation U, then interact to pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nThen she has onion, then she can move back to (3,1) or add to pot.\n\nBut to add to pot, she needs to be at (3,1).\n\nFrom (2,1), move east to (3,1), then face south, interact.\n\nSimilarly for other onions.\n\nBut let's calculate turns.\n\nAlso, we need to start cooking as soon as possible.\n\nAnother idea: use both pots, but we only need one soup for now.\n\nBut we can make two soups for more reward, but let's focus on one first.\n\nBob can get a plate or something.\n\nLet's list the onions on counters: (3,2), (4,2), (2,2), (2,0), etc.\n\n(2,0) has onion, but to access, from (2,1) or (1,0), etc.\n\nPerhaps Alice can add one onion to pot, then Bob adds one from (4,2) to the other pot, but then we have two pots with one onion each, not good.\n\nBetter to fill one pot first.\n\nSo for pot (3,0), Alice adds one at turn 70.\n\nThen at turn 71, Alice moves to (4,1) to free (3,1).\n\nThen Bob comes to (3,1) to add his onion.\n\nBut Bob needs to reach (3,1).\n\nFrom earlier, Bob at (4,3) at turn 70.\n\nTurn 71: Bob Move L to (3,3), facing west.\n\nNow at (3,3), he can move down? Not, so he can move to (3,4) but not walkable, or to (4,3), or to (2,3).\n\nSay turn 72: Bob Move L to (2,3), facing west.\n\nTurn 73: Bob Move D to (2,2)? Not possible.\n\nHe can move to (2,3), then to (1,3), etc, as before.\n\nShortest path: from (3,3) to (3,2) not, so he must go to (4,3) or (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), he can move to (2,4) not, or (1,3), then to (1,2), etc.\n\nAssume (1,3) is empty, (1,2) empty, (1,1) empty, (2,1) empty.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,3): 1 move\n\n(2,3) to (1,3): 1 move\n\n(1,3) to (1,2): 1 move (move D)\n\n(1,2) to (1,1): 1 move D\n\n(1,1) to (2,1): 1 move R\n\n(2,1) to (3,1): 1 move R\n\nSo 6 moves to reach (3,1) from (3,3).\n\nFrom (4,3) to (3,3) is one move, so from (4,3) to (3,1) via that path: to (3,3), then to (2,3), to (1,3), to (1,2), to (1,1), to (2,1), to (3,1) — 6 moves from (4,3), but (4,3) to (3,3) is one, then 5 more to (3,1), total 6 from (4,3).\n\nPositions: start from (4,3) turn 70.\n\nTurn 71: Move L to (3,3)  // at (3,3)\n\nTurn 72: Move L to (2,3)  // at (2,3)\n\nTurn 73: Move L to (1,3)  // at (1,3)\n\nTurn 74: Move D to (1,2)  // at (1,2)\n\nTurn 75: Move D to (1,1)  // at (1,1)\n\nTurn 76: Move R to (2,1)  // at (2,1)\n\nTurn 77: Move R to (3,1)  // at (3,1)\n\nThen turn 78: Change orientation D to face south\n\nTurn 79: Interact with pot to add onion.\n\nBut at turn 70, pot has 1 onion, at turn 79 adds second, so cooking not started yet.\n\nThen we need third onion.\n\nAlice can get it.\n\nAfter Alice moves to (4,1) at turn 71, she is at (4,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can pick up the onion from (4,2) if possible.\n\n(4,2) is north of (4,1), but (4,1) to (4,2) is adjacent, but (4,2) is kitchen counter, so she can interact if facing north.\n\nAt turn 71: Alice at (4,1), after moving from (3,1), she is facing east (since moved R to (4,1)).\n\nTo interact with (4,2), she needs to face north.\n\nTurn 72: Alice Change orientation U to face up.\n\nTurn 73: Interact with (4,2) to pick up onion. Holding onion.\n\nNow she has onion, but to add to pot (3,0), she needs to be at (3,1) and face south.\n\n(3,1) is free, so she can move west to (3,1): Move L to (3,1), facing west.\n\nTurn 74: at (3,1), Change orientation D to face south.\n\nTurn 75: Interact with pot to add onion.\n\nSo at turn 75, pot has 2 onions from Alice's actions, but Bob is adding at turn 79, so not synchronized.\n\nAt turn 70, pot has 1 onion (from Alice).\n\nAt turn 75, Alice adds another, so 2 onions.\n\nThen at turn 79, Bob adds third, so at turn 79, pot has 3 onions, cooking starts.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so at turn 84, cooked.\n\nThen serve.\n\nBut Bob added at turn 79, so cooking from turn 79 to 84.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice can get a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice at (3,1) after adding at turn 75, holding nothing.\n\nShe can go to (0,2) to get plate.\n\nPath from (3,1) to (0,2).\n\n(3,1) to (2,1) to (1,1) to (0,1) or to (0,2).\n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she can go to (0,2) directly? (0,2) is plate dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSo she needs to be adjacent to (0,2) to interact.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (0,2): north (0,3) kitchen counter, south (0,1) kitchen counter, east (1,2), west none.\n\n(1,2) might be empty.\n\nSo from (1,2), she can face west to interact with (0,2).\n\nFirst, Alice at (3,1), move west to (2,1): Move L to (2,1), facing west.\n\nTurn 76: at (2,1), move west to (1,1): Move L to (1,1), facing west.\n\nTurn 77: at (1,1), move north to (1,2): Move U to (1,2), facing north.\n\nAt (1,2), she can interact with plate dispenser at (0,2) since adjacent and facing west? (0,2) is west of (1,2), so she needs to face west.\n\nTurn 78: Change orientation L to face west.\n\nTurn 79: Interact to grab plate. Holding plate.\n\nThen she can go to the pot to serve, but the soup is not cooked yet.\n\nCooking starts at turn 79, ends turn 84.\n\nAlice has plate at turn 79, she can hold it until ready.\n\nBut she needs to serve at serving counter.\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nShe can go there.\n\nBut let's see the cooking.\n\nCooking from turn 79 to 84.\n\nAt turn 84, cooked.\n\nAlice can be near the pot to serve when cooked.\n\nAt turn 79, she is at (1,2) holding plate.\n\nShe can move to the pot area.\n\nTo serve, she needs to be at (3,1) with plate and interact with pot when soup is cooked.\n\nInteract with pot to serve if holding plate and soup cooked.\n\nSo she can go to (3,1).\n\nPath from (1,2) to (3,1): (1,2) to (2,2) not walkable, so to (1,1) or (1,3), etc.\n\n(1,2) to (2,2) not, so move south to (1,1): Move D to (1,1), facing south.\n\nTurn 80: at (1,1), move east to (2,1): Move R to (2,1), facing east.\n\nTurn 81: move east to (3,1): Move R to (3,1), facing east.\n\nNow at (3,1), facing east, but to interact with pot south, need to face south.\n\nTurn 82: Change orientation D to face south.\n\nThen at turn 84, when cooked, she can interact to serve, getting the soup on plate.\n\nThen she needs to deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (7,2).\n\nPath: for example, (3,1) to (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2) to (7,2)? But (7,2) serving counter, not walkable, so need to be adjacent.\n\nAdjacent to (7,2): west (6,2), east none, north (7,3) kitchen counter, south (7,1) kitchen counter with onion.\n\nSo only from (6,2).\n\n(6,2) empty.\n\nSo Alice can go to (6,2), face east, interact.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (6,2): (3,1) to (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2).\n\nTurn 82: at (3,1) facing D.\n\nAfter turn 82, she is facing south, but not cooking done yet.\n\nAt turn 84, she interacts to serve.\n\nTurn 84: Alice interact with pot to serve, now holding soup on plate.\n\nThen move to (6,2).\n\nTurn 85: Move R to (4,1), facing east? Move to (4,1) from (3,1) is east, so Move R to (4,1), facing east.\n\nTurn 86: Move R to (5,1), facing east.\n\nTurn 87: Move R to (6,1), facing east.\n\nTurn 88: Move U to (6,2), facing north. (since U increases y)\n\nAt (6,2), face east to interact with serving counter (7,2).\n\nTurn 89: Change orientation R to face east.\n\nTurn 90: Interact to deliver soup.\n\nReward 20.\n\nBut this takes many turns, and Bob is not used efficiently.\n\nMoreover, we have only one soup.\n\nWith Bob, he can get the plate or something.\n\nBut let's see if we can start cooking earlier.\n\nAlternative plan: use the onions on counters near the pots.\n\nFor example, onion at (2,0), kitchen counter, can be picked up from (2,1) or (1,0) or (3,0) but not walkable, so from (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) from (2,1) or (1,2) or (3,2) etc.\n\nAlice at (3,1), she can move to (2,1) at turn 71.\n\nTurn 71: Alice Move L to (2,1), facing west.\n\nThen at (2,1), she can face north to interact with (2,2) if she wants, but (2,2) has onion.\n\nOr she can face south to interact with (2,0)? (2,0) is south of (2,1), so she can interact with (2,0) to pick up onion.\n\n(2,0) is kitchen counter with onion, south of (2,1).\n\nAlice at (2,1), facing south, can interact to pick up onion.\n\nThen she has onion, and she is at (2,1), which is adjacent to pot (3,0) east, so she can face east and move to (3,1), then face south to add to pot.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nSince the pot is at (3,0), and (2,0) is adjacent but not walkable, so only from (3,1).\n\nSo Alice needs to be at (3,1).\n\nBack to the first plan but with Bob helping sooner.\n\nAnother idea: Bob can get the third onion and add it while Alice gets the plate.\n\nBut let's assume that for the first few turns, Alice adds one onion, then moves, Bob adds one, but Bob takes time to arrive.\n\nPerhaps at turn 67, both start with what they can do.\n\nTurn 67:\nAlice: Change Orientation U  // to face north for (3,2)\nBob: Change Orientation D  // to face south for (3,2), but (3,2) is north of him? Bob at (3,3) facing U, to face (3,2) he needs to face south.\n\nTurn 67 Bob: Change Orientation D to face south.\n\nThen turn 68 Alice: Interact with (3,2) to pick up onion. // now Alice holding onion\n\nTurn 68 Bob: Interact with (3,2) to pick up onion, but (3,2) has only one onion? Kitchen counter can have multiple items? Probably not, each counter has one item or can be empty.\n\nThe list says \"contains a onion\", so likely one item per counter.\n\nSo only one player can pick up from (3,2).\n\nIf Alice picks it at turn 68, it's gone, Bob can't pick.\n\nSo Bob should pick from (4,2) or dispenser.\n\nTurn 67 Bob: Move R to (4,3)  // as before\n\nThen turn 68 Bob: Change Orientation S to face south for (4,2)\n\nTurn 69 Bob: Interact with (4,2) to pick up onion.\n\n etc.\n\nI think it's better to have Alice handle the pot (3,0) and Bob handle getting a plate or something.\n\nLet's calculate the minimum turns to start cooking.\n\nAlice can add one onion quickly.\n\nThen she can add a second from another counter.\n\nFor example, after adding first onion at turn 70, she moves to (4,1) at turn 71.\n\nThen at (4,1), she can pick up from (4,2).\n\nTurn 72: Alice Change Orientation U to face north (at (4,1))\n\nTurn 73: Interact with (4,2) to pick up onion.\n\nHolding onion.\n\nThen she can add to pot, but she is at (4,1), which is adjacent to pot (4,0) south.\n\nPot (4,0) is empty.\n\nShe can add to pot (4,0) instead.\n\nTurn 74: Change Orientation D to face south.\n\nTurn 75: Interact with pot (4,0) to add onion.\n\nNow pot (4,0) has one onion.\n\nSimilarly, she can add more.\n\nBut we have two pots with one onion each.\n\nNot good.\n\nShe can go back to (3,1) to add to (3,0).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (3,1): Move L to (3,1), facing west.\n\nTurn 76: at (3,1), Change orientation D to face south.\n\nTurn 77: Interact with pot (3,0) to add onion. Now pot (3,0) has 2 onions.\n\nThen we need third onion.\n\nBob can add it.\n\nBob at (3,3) or wherever.\n\nAt turn 67, Bob can go to get an onion from dispenser or counter.\n\nTurn 67 Bob: Move R to (4,3)  // at (4,3) facing east\n\nTurn 68 Bob: Change Orientation S to face south\n\nTurn 69 Bob: Interact with (4,2) to pick up onion  // if not taken, but Alice took it at turn 73, so conflict.\n\nAssume Alice takes (3,2) onion, Bob takes (4,2) onion.\n\nTurn 69 Bob has onion at (4,3).\n\nThen he can go to (4,1) to add to pot (4,0), but (4,1) may be occupied.\n\nOr to (3,1) for (3,0).\n\nBut let's say for pot (3,0) with 2 onions, Bob adds third.\n\nBob at (4,3) holding onion.\n\nHe can go to (3,1) via (3,3) etc, but slow.\n\nMove to (3,3): Move L to (3,3), facing west.\n\nThen to (2,3), etc.\n\nOr directly, he can move to (3,2) not, so no.\n\nI think the initial plan with Alice adding two and Bob adding one is better, but Bob is slow.\n\nPerhaps Bob can be the one to get the plate while Alice fills the pot.\n\nLet's have Alice fill the pot with three onions using the nearby counters.\n\nFor example, onions at (3,2), (4,2), (2,2), all near.\n\nAlice at (3,1) after adding first onion.\n\nTurn 70: Alice added onion to pot, at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nTurn 71: Alice Move L to (2,1), facing west.\n\nTurn 72: Alice Change Orientation U to face north for (2,2)\n\nTurn 73: Alice Interact with (2,2) to pick up onion. Holding onion.\n\nTurn 74: Alice Move R to (3,1), facing east.\n\nTurn 75: Alice Change Orientation D to face south.\n\nTurn 76: Alice Interact with pot to add onion. Now pot has 2 onions.\n\nTurn 77: Alice Move R to (4,1), facing east.  // free (3,1) for third onion\n\nNow she needs third onion.\n\nShe can get from (4,2).\n\nAt (4,1), turn 78: Change Orientation U to face north.\n\nTurn 79: Interact with (4,2) to pick up onion. Holding onion.\n\nTurn 80: Move L to (3,1), facing west.\n\nTurn 81: Change Orientation D to face south.\n\nTurn 82: Interact with pot to add onion. Now pot has 3 onions at turn 82, cooking starts.\n\nCooking from turn 82 to 87.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can get the plate.\n\nAt turn 67, Bob can go to plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nBob at (3,3) facing U.\n\nTurn 67 Bob: Change Orientation D to face south  // to go down\n\nThen move down, but cannot to (3,2), so move left to (2,3): Move L to (2,3), facing west.\n\nTurn 68 Bob: Move L to (1,3), facing west.\n\nTurn 69 Bob: Move D to (1,2), facing south.  // (1,2) empty\n\nAt (1,2), he can interact with plate dispenser at (0,2) by facing west.\n\nTurn 70: Change Orientation L to face west.\n\nTurn 71: Interact to grab plate. Holding plate.\n\nThen he can go to the pot to serve when cooked.\n\nCooking starts at turn 82, ends 87.\n\nBob can be at (3,1) at turn 87 to serve.\n\nFrom (1,2) holding plate, to (3,1).\n\nTurn 72: Move D to (1,1), facing south.\n\nTurn 73: Move R to (2,1), facing east.\n\nTurn 74: Move R to (3,1), facing east.\n\nAt (3,1), facing east, need to face south for pot.\n\nTurn 75: Change Orientation D to face south.\n\nThen at turn 87, interact to serve.\n\nBut cooking ends at turn 87, so at turn 87, he can interact.\n\nThen he has soup on plate.\n\nThen deliver to serving counter.\n\nServing counter at (7,2), from (3,1) to (6,2) as before.\n\nBut Bob is holding the soup, so he can deliver.\n\nTurn 88: Move R to (4,1), facing east.\n\nTurn 89: Move R to (5,1), facing east.\n\nTurn 90: Move R to (6,1), facing east.\n\nTurn 91: Move U to (6,2), facing north.\n\nTurn 92: Change Orientation R to face east.\n\nTurn 93: Interact to deliver.\n\nReward at turn 93.\n\nTotal turns from 67 to 93, 26 turns for one soup.\n\nBut we can do better with coordination.\n\nAlice can get the plate after adding the onions.\n\nOr both can work on filling faster.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, Alice can add all three quickly if she can access them.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), she can pick (3,2) onion, add to pot, then pick (2,2) onion, add, then pick (4,2) onion, add.\n\nBut to pick (2,2), she needs to be at (2,1), etc.\n\nAs in the sequence above, it took until turn 82 to start cooking.\n\nWith Bob's help, he can add the third onion faster.\n\nFor example, at turn 67, Bob goes to (4,3) and picks onion from (4,2) at turn 69.\n\nThen he has onion, and he can go to (3,1) when free.\n\nAlice adds first at turn 70.\n\nTurn 71 Alice moves to (4,1).\n\nTurn 72 Bob at (4,3) holding onion, move to (3,3): Move L to (3,3), facing west.\n\nTurn 73 Bob move to (2,3): Move L to (2,3), facing west.\n\nThen he needs to go down, but can't, so he must go to (2,1) via (1,3) etc.\n\nSame problem.\n\nPerhaps Bob can add to pot (4,0) from (4,1).\n\nAt turn 67 Bob: Move R to (4,3)  // at (4,3)\n\nTurn 68: Change Orientation S to face south\n\nTurn 69: Interact with (4,2) pick up onion\n\nTurn 70: Move to (4,1) but how? From (4,3) to (4,1), no direct, so move to (5,3) etc.\n\nFrom (4,3) move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 71: Move D to (5,2)? not possible\n\nMove to (5,3) to (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1)\n\nTurn 70: at (4,3) after interact, holding onion.\n\nTurn 71: Move R to (5,3), facing east\n\nTurn 72: Move R to (6,3), facing east\n\nTurn 73: Move D to (6,2), facing south\n\nTurn 74: Move D to (6,1), facing south\n\nTurn 75: Move L to (5,1), facing west\n\nTurn 76: Move L to (4,1), facing west\n\nNow at (4,1), he can face south to interact with pot (4,0).\n\nTurn 77: Change Orientation D to face south\n\nTurn 78: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0).\n\nBut pot (4,0) has one onion, while Alice has two in (3,0), so not helpful.\n\nI think it's best to have Alice fill the pot herself and Bob get the plate, as in the earlier sequence.\n\nFor the answer, I'll outline a sequence for Alice only, as per the task, but the task says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I can include Bob's actions to coordinate.\n\nThe task: \"plan a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=1}^{H-1} for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"\n\nSo I can include Bob's actions.\n\nBut for the answer format, it's for Alice, but we can state Bob's for coordination.\n\nThe format is only for Alice's actions.\n\nLet's read: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\" and \"Answer Format: Turn t1: a_{t1} etc for Alice.\"\n\nSo only Alice's actions.\n\nI need to plan for Alice, assuming Bob is doing something, but I have to specify Alice's actions.\n\nWith Bob's actions implied or coordinated.\n\nIn the plan, I need to specify what Alice does, and assume Bob is cooperating.\n\nFor example, Alice can focus on filling the pot, and Bob on getting the plate.\n\nFrom the current state, Alice can:\n\nTurn 67: Change Orientation U (to face north for (3,2))\n\nTurn 68: Interact with (3,2) to pick up onion\n\nTurn 69: Change Orientation D (to face south for pot)\n\nTurn 70: Interact with pot (3,0) to add onion (pot has 1)\n\nTurn 71: Move L to (2,1) (facing west)\n\nTurn 72: Change Orientation U (face north for (2,2))\n\nTurn 73: Interact with (2,2) to pick up onion\n\nTurn 74: Move R to (3,1) (facing east)\n\nTurn 75: Change Orientation D (face south)\n\nTurn 76: Interact with pot to add onion (pot has 2)\n\nTurn 77: Move R to (4,1) (facing east)\n\nTurn 78: Change Orientation U (face north for (4,2))\n\nTurn 79: Interact with (4,2) to pick up onion\n\nTurn 80: Move L to (3,1) (facing west)\n\nTurn 81: Change Orientation D (face south)\n\nTurn 82: Interact with pot to add onion (pot has 3, cooking starts)\n\nNow cooking from turn 82 to 87.\n\nAlice at (3,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can go get a plate.\n\nPlate at (0,2).\n\nTurn 83: Move L to (2,1) (facing west)\n\nTurn 84: Move L to (1,1) (facing west)\n\nTurn 85: Move U to (1,2) (facing north)\n\nTurn 86: Change Orientation L (face west for (0,2))\n\nTurn 87: Interact to grab plate\n\nHolding plate.\n\nCooking done at turn 87, but she is at (1,2), far from pot.\n\nShe needs to go back to serve.\n\nTurn 88: Move D to (1,1) (facing south)\n\nTurn 89: Move R to (2,1) (facing east)\n\nTurn 90: Move R to (3,1) (facing east)\n\nAt (3,1), facing east, need to face south for pot.\n\nTurn 91: Change Orientation D (face south)\n\nTurn 92: Interact with pot to serve (get soup on plate)\n\nNow holding soup.\n\nThen deliver to (7,2).\n\nTurn 93: Move R to (4,1) (facing east)\n\nTurn 94: Move R to (5,1) (facing east)\n\nTurn 95: Move R to (6,1) (facing east)\n\nTurn 96: Move U to (6,2) (facing north)\n\nTurn 97: Change Orientation R (face east)\n\nTurn 98: Interact with serving counter to deliver.\n\nReward at turn 98.\n\nMany turns.\n\nWith Bob, if he gets the plate earlier, he can serve at turn 87.\n\nFor example, from turn 67, Bob goes to get plate.\n\nTurn 67 Bob: Change Orientation D (face south)\n\nTurn 68 Bob: Move L to (2,3) (facing west)\n\nTurn 69 Bob: Move L to (1,3) (facing west)\n\nTurn 70 Bob: Move D to (1,2) (facing south)\n\nTurn 71 Bob: Change Orientation L (face west)\n\nTurn 72 Bob: Interact to grab plate\n\nHolding plate at turn 72.\n\nThen he can go to (3,1) to wait for cooking to finish.\n\nCooking starts at turn 82, ends 87.\n\nBob can be at (3,1) at turn 87.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (3,1):\n\nTurn 73: Move D to (1,1) (facing south)\n\nTurn 74: Move R to (2,1) (facing east)\n\nTurn 75: Move R to (3,1) (facing east)\n\nThen at (3,1), he can change orientation to D at some point.\n\nAt turn 87, he can interact to serve.\n\nThen he can deliver.\n\nBut he is holding the plate from turn 72, so for 15 turns, which is fine.\n\nThen at turn 87, serve, then deliver to (7,2) similarly.\n\nTurn 88: Move R to (4,1)\n\netc.\n\nBut with coordination, the soup is served faster.\n\nFor Alice's actions, I'll use the first part to fill the pot.\n\nSince the task is to plan Alice's actions, I'll plan for Alice to fill the pot and then get the plate, but it's slow.\n\nPerhaps Alice can fill the pot, and assume Bob gets the plate and serves.\n\nBut for the sequence, I need to output Alice's actions.\n\nSo for H turns, say H=20, from turn 67 to 86.\n\nBut cooking starts at turn 82, so not complete.\n\nPerhaps for Alice, she can do:\n\nTurn 67: U (change orientation to face up)\n\nTurn 68: I (interact with (3,2) to pick onion)\n\nTurn 69: D (change orientation to face down)\n\nTurn 70: I (add onion to pot)\n\nTurn 71: L (move left to (2,1))\n\nTurn 72: U (change orientation to face up)\n\nTurn 73: I (pick onion from (2,2))\n\nTurn 74: R (move right to (3,1))\n\nTurn 75: D (change orientation to face down)\n\nTurn 76: I (add onion to pot, now 2 onions)\n\nThen for third onion, she can get from (4,2) or other.\n\nTurn 77: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nTurn 78: U (change orientation to face up)\n\nTurn 79: I (pick onion from (4,2))\n\nTurn 80: L (move left to (3,1))\n\nTurn 81: D (change orientation to face down)\n\nTurn 82: I (add onion to pot, now 3, cooking starts)\n\nThen she can go for plate.\n\nTurn 83: L (move left to (2,1))\n\nTurn 84: L (move left to (1,1))\n\nTurn 85: U (move up to (1,2))  // U increases y, so from (1,1) to (1,2)\n\nTurn 86: L (change orientation to face west for (0,2), but she can interact at turn 87.\n\nBut H may be up to here.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll provide Alice's actions for the next 20 turns or so.\n\nBut let's include up to where she gets the plate.\n\nSince the reward is from delivered soup, and it takes time, perhaps the plan is to start the cooking.\n\nBut the task is to maximize reward, so we need to deliver.\n\nBut for the sequence, we can plan the actions.\n\nAnother idea: use the onion on (2,0) or others to save time, but not necessarily.\n\nI think I should go with the first plan.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 67: U (change orientation to face up)\n\nTurn 68: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n\nTurn 69: D (change orientation to face down)\n\nTurn 70: I (add onion to pot (3,0))\n\nTurn 71: L (move left to (2,1))\n\nTurn 72: U (change orientation to face up)\n\nTurn 73: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nTurn 74: R (move right to (3,1))\n\nTurn 75: D (change orientation to face down)\n\nTurn 76: I (add onion to pot, now 2 onions)\n\nTurn 77: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nTurn 78: U (change orientation to face up)\n\nTurn 79: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n\nTurn 80: L (move left to (3,1))\n\nTurn 81: D (change orientation to face down)\n\nTurn 82: I (add onion to pot, now 3 onions, cooking starts)\n\nThen she can stay or move to get plate.\n\nFor the sequence, I'll stop here for H=16 turns from 67 to 82, but t1=67, so actions from t1 to t1+15 for 16 turns? Let's define.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t1, t1+1, ..., up to H-1 turns, but H is not specified.\n\nSay for 10 turns or so.\n\nBut cooking starts at turn 82, which is t1+15, so for shorter H, not complete.\n\nPerhaps for the first few turns, get the pot filled.\n\nBut with the available onions, Alice can add one quickly.\n\nFor example, up to turn 70, she adds one onion.\n\nThen the plan can be shorter.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll provide the sequence to add one onion and position for more.\n\nBut let's box the answer for Alice's actions.\n\nAssume Bob is getting the plate or helping.\n\nFor Alice:\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: I\n\nTurn 69: D\n\nTurn 70: I\n\nThen she can wait or move.\n\nBut to maximize, she should continue.\n\nI think I'll go with the sequence above for 16 turns.\n\nSo actions for Alice:\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: I\n\nTurn 69: D\n\nTurn 70: I\n\nTurn 71: L\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: I\n\nTurn 74: R\n\nTurn 75: D\n\nTurn 76: I\n\nTurn 77: R\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: I\n\nTurn 80: L\n\nTurn 81: D\n\nTurn 82: I\n\nThis is for turns 67 to 82, 16 actions.\n\nThen cooking starts.\n\nFor the answer format.\n\nThe action history shows recent actions, but not relevant for planning.\n\nSo I'll write the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes in *Overcooked*, Alice and Bob must coordinate to fill a pot with three onions, allow it to cook for 5 turns, and then serve the cooked soup using a plate. Given the current game state at turn 67, the optimal plan focuses on Alice filling the pot at (3,0) using nearby onions on kitchen counters, while Bob retrieves a plate from the dispenser at (0,2) and handles serving. This leverages Alice's proximity to the pot and available onions, and Bob's position to efficiently gather the plate.\n\n### Key Coordination Points:\n- **Alice's Role:** Fill the pot at (3,0) by picking up onions from kitchen counters at (3,2), (2,2), and (4,2). Alice starts at (3,1) facing down, so she must adjust orientation to interact with counters and the pot.\n- **Bob's Role (Implied Coordination):** Bob should immediately head to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to grab a plate, then return to the pot area to serve the soup once cooked. Cooking starts when the third onion is added, and the soup is ready after 5 turns. Bob can then deliver to the serving counter at (7,2).\n- **Efficiency:** Using onions from kitchen counters saves time compared to dispensers. The pot at (3,0) is chosen for its accessibility from (3,1). Cooking starts at turn 82, and soup is ready at turn 87. Bob can serve around turn 87-88 and deliver by turn 93 for a 20-point reward.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (for turns 67 to 82):\nAlice's actions focus on collecting onions and adding them to the pot. After adding the third onion at turn 82, cooking begins. Alice can then assist with serving or prepare for the next recipe, but the sequence below covers the critical filling phase.\n\n- **Turn 67:** Change orientation to Up (U) to face the kitchen counter at (3,2) north of her position.\n- **Turn 68:** Interact (I) to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (3,2). Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 69:** Change orientation to Down (D) to face the pot at (3,0) south of her position.\n- **Turn 70:** Interact (I) to add the onion to the pot at (3,0). Pot now has 1 onion. Alice holds nothing.\n- **Turn 71:** Move Left (L) to (2,1), facing west, to access the kitchen counter at (2,2).\n- **Turn 72:** Change orientation to Up (U) to face the kitchen counter at (2,2) north of her position.\n- **Turn 73:** Interact (I) to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (2,2). Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 74:** Move Right (R) to (3,1), facing east, to return to the pot access point.\n- **Turn 75:** Change orientation to Down (D) to face the pot at (3,0).\n- **Turn 76:** Interact (I) to add the onion to the pot at (3,0). Pot now has 2 onions. Alice holds nothing.\n- **Turn 77:** Move Right (R) to (4,1), facing east, to access the kitchen counter at (4,2).\n- **Turn 78:** Change orientation to Up (U) to face the kitchen counter at (4,2) north of her position.\n- **Turn 79:** Interact (I) to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (4,2). Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 80:** Move Left (L) to (3,1), facing west, to return to the pot access point.\n- **Turn 81:** Change orientation to Down (D) to face the pot at (3,0).\n- **Turn 82:** Interact (I) to add the onion to the pot at (3,0). Pot now has 3 onions, and cooking starts automatically (will finish at turn 87).\n\n### Expected Outcome with Bob's Coordination:\n- **Cooking and Serving:** \n  - Cooking starts at turn 82 and completes at turn 87. \n  - Bob should have the plate by turn 72 (based on his actions) and be at (3,1) by turn 87 to serve the soup immediately. He can then deliver to (7,2) by turn 93 for the 20-point reward.\n- **Total Turns for Reward:** The soup is delivered around turn 93, yielding 20 points. Alice can use subsequent turns to start another recipe or assist Bob.\n- **Why This Plan Maximizes Reward:** \n  - Minimizes movement by using nearby onions on counters (e.g., (3,2), (2,2), (4,2)) instead of dispensers.\n  - Parallel actions: Alice fills the pot while Bob gets the plate, reducing idle time.\n  - Cooking starts by turn 82, which is efficient from the current state.\n\nThis sequence for Alice ensures the pot is filled quickly, and with Bob's help, the soup is delivered for maximum reward. For turns beyond 82, Alice can head to the plate dispenser or another onion source to prepare for the next recipe, but the core reward-generating action is covered.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: I \\\\\nTurn 69: D \\\\\nTurn 70: I \\\\\nTurn 71: L \\\\\nTurn 72: U \\\\\nTurn 73: I \\\\\nTurn 74: R \\\\\nTurn 75: D \\\\\nTurn 76: I \\\\\nTurn 77: R \\\\\nTurn 78: U \\\\\nTurn 79: I \\\\\nTurn 80: L \\\\\nTurn 81: D \\\\\nTurn 82: I\n}",

There are no tomato dispensers, so we can only make onion soup.\n\nKey elements:\n\n- Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4)\n\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n\n- Pots at (3,0) and (4,0)\n\n- Serving counter at (7,2)\n\n- Alice is at (4,1) facing up, holding nothing.\n\n- Bob is at (2,3) facing right, holding nothing.\n\nThere are onions on several kitchen counters: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2), (4,2), (2,0), (2,2), (0,3). But players can only interact if they are adjacent and facing the tile. Also, players can carry only one item at a time.\n\nThe goal is to deliver as many onion soups as possible. Since pots cook automatically with 3 ingredients, we need to put 3 onions in a pot, wait 5 turns for cooking, then serve it with a plate.\n\nSteps for one soup:\n\n1. Get three onions into a pot.\n\n2. Wait 5 turns for cooking.\n\n3. Get a plate.\n\n4. Serve the cooked soup at the serving counter.\n\nSince there are multiple onions on counters, we might not need to go to dispensers directly, which could save time.\n\nAlice and Bob can work together to do this faster.\n\nCurrent turn is t1 = 72.\n\nI need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice for the next H turns. H isn't specified, but since cooking takes 5 turns, I should plan for at least 10-15 turns to complete a delivery.\n\nFirst, let's look at positions:\n\nAlice: (4,1) facing up.\n\nFrom (4,1), she can move up to (4,2), but (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. Since it's a counter, she can't walk on it; she needs to be adjacent and facing to interact.\n\nTile types: kitchen counters are not walkable; they are obstacles except for interaction.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But kitchen counters are tiles that can have items, so they are non-empty when occupied, but even empty, they might be walkable? Let me check.\n\nThe rules say: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" And \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But tiles like counters are specific types.\n\nLooking back: \"Game Grid (2D Tile Types)\" – it lists tile types, and kitchen counter is one type. Then \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But \"non-empty\" might refer to tiles that have items or are not empty space.\n\nI think there's a confusion.\n\nLet me read carefully:\n\n\"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\"\n\n\"Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter\" are all non-empty tiles, I assume, meaning players cannot walk on them; they can only interact when adjacent and facing.\n\nYes, that makes sense. From the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And non-empty tiles include dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters when they have items or not? Actually, the tile itself is a type, so kitchen counter tile is always a non-empty tile, meaning not walkable, regardless of whether it has an item or not.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nConfirming with the rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And non-empty tiles are those that are not empty tiles, I think.\n\nAlso, \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo, for any tile that is not an empty tile, it's non-empty, and players must be on an adjacent empty tile to interact.\n\nTherefore, kitchen counters, dispensers, pots, serving counters are all non-empty tiles; players cannot walk on them, only interact from adjacent empty tiles.\n\nSimilarly, empty tiles are walkable.\n\nIn this map, we have positions of these tiles.\n\nNow, Alice is at (4,1). What is (4,1)? It's not listed in kitchen counters, pots, etc., so it should be an empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (2,3), not listed, so empty tile.\n\nNow, Alice is facing up, so she can interact with (4,2), which is a kitchen counter with an onion.\n\n(4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, as per \"Kitchen Counter on (4,2): contains a onion\".\n\nSo Alice is at (4,1), facing up, adjacent to (4,2) and facing it, so she can interact to pick up the onion if she is empty-handed.\n\nShe is holding nothing, so she can do that.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (2,3) facing right. (2,3) is an empty tile? (2,3) is not listed as a counter or anything, so yes. He is facing right, so he can interact with (3,3)? But (3,3) is not specified. Let's see the grid.\n\nI should sketch a grid.\n\nList all tile positions:\n\n- Kitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\nAlso, empty tiles elsewhere.\n\nNow, Alice at (4,1): (4,1) is not a kitchen counter, so empty tile.\n\nShe is facing up, so adjacent tiles: up is (4,2), which is kitchen counter with onion; down is (4,0), but (4,0) is a pot; left is (3,1), not listed, so probably empty; right is (5,1), not listed, empty.\n\nSince she is facing up, she can interact with (4,2) by pressing 'I'.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (2,3) facing right. Adjacent tiles: left (1,3)? (1,3) not listed, empty? But (0,3) is kitchen counter with onion, but (0,3) is not adjacent to (2,3); (2,3) to (0,3) is two steps away.\n\n(2,3) facing right: right would be (3,3). (3,3) not listed, so probably empty tile. To interact with something, he needs to be facing it and adjacent. Currently, he might not be adjacent to any non-empty tile except possibly (2,2) or (2,4), but he is facing right, so not facing them.\n\n(2,2) is kitchen counter with onion, but it's below him? Positions: (x,y), with L/R changing x, U/D changing y. U is y+1, D is y-1.\n\nSo at (2,3), facing right (east), so he can interact with (3,3) if it were non-empty, but (3,3) is not listed, so likely empty. He can interact with (2,2) only if he faces down, but he is facing right, so not facing (2,2). Similarly, (2,4) is kitchen counter, but he is at (2,3), so (2,4) is above, he would need to face up to interact.\n\nCurrently, with facing right, he can only interact with (3,3), which is empty, so 'I' might do nothing, or he can move.\n\nNow, back to Alice: she can immediately interact to pick up the onion from (4,2) since she is adjacent, facing, and empty-handed.\n\nThen, she would be holding an onion.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0). (4,0) is directly below her at (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,1), down is (4,0), which is a pot.\n\nBut she is facing up, not down, so to interact with the pot below, she needs to face down.\n\nSimilarly, Bob could be directed to do something.\n\nStrategy: we need to fill a pot with 3 onions.\n\nThere are onions available on counters, so we can use those instead of going to dispensers.\n\nFor example, onion on (4,2), which Alice can grab now.\n\nAlso, (3,2) has onion, (2,2) has onion, etc.\n\nPots at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nAlice at (4,1) can go down to interact with pot at (4,0) after getting the onion.\n\nBut she needs to face down first.\n\nSequence for Alice:\n\nTurn 72: she can press 'I' to interact with (4,2) and pick up the onion. Then she is holding an onion.\n\nThen, she needs to go to a pot to put it in. Pot at (4,0) is directly below.\n\nSo turn 73: she can change orientation to down (D? Wait, actions: Move or Change Orientation or Interact or Stay.\n\nChange orientation: if she changes to down, that would be an action.\n\nShe can move down to (4,0), but (4,0) is a pot, non-empty tile, so she cannot walk onto it. She must stay on empty tile and interact.\n\nSo from (4,1), to interact with (4,0), she needs to be facing down.\n\nSo turn 73: she can change orientation to down. Action: D? D is move down or change orientation down?\n\nThe actions are: Move (L/R/U/D) or Change Orientation (L/R/U/D) or Interact (I) or Stay (S).\n\nFrom the description: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So if she moves down, she changes position to (4,0) but since (4,0) is non-empty, she can't move there. \"Move: Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\" But if the adjacent tile is not empty, she can't move, I assume. The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if she tries to move to a non-empty tile, it should not be possible, or perhaps the action fails.\n\nBut the action history shows actions like I, U, etc., so probably if move is invalid, it might not happen, but we need to plan valid actions.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" The phrasing is a bit messy.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" That seems wrong.\n\nLet me read carefully:\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it's poorly worded. Probably it means: Change orientation to the specified direction without moving, but only if the adjacent tile in that direction is not an empty one? That doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps: Change orientation to direction, and if that direction has an adjacent tile that is not empty, something, but it's confusing.\n\nFrom context, \"Change Orientation\" should just change the facing direction without moving, regardless of tiles.\n\nBut the sentence says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" I think it might be a mistake.\n\nPerhaps it means that for move actions, if the adjacent tile is not empty, you don't move but may change orientation? I'm not sure.\n\nLet's read the full action description:\n\n\"Each player can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n- Interact (I): ...\n- Stay (S): Do nothing.\"\n\nThe \"Change Orientation\" part says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But it doesn't specify what it does.\n\nI think there might be a misinterpretation.\n\nPerhaps it's: Change Orientation action changes only the orientation, and the \"no move\" part is indicating that it doesn't move, but the condition is confusing.\n\nI believe the \"No move if...\" is a clause for the Move action, but it's listed under Change Orientation.\n\nLooking at the text: after Move description, it has a period, then Change Orientation, so it's separate.\n\nBut the Change Orientation description is incomplete.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo, and it should be that Change Orientation only changes facing, no move.\n\nIn many games, changing orientation is a separate action that doesn't move.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll assume that \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)\" changes the facing to that direction without moving.\n\nSimilarly, for Move, if the target tile is not empty, the move fails or is not possible, so we should not plan invalid moves.\n\nIn action history, we see actions like U, D, I, so players can attempt moves, but if invalid, nothing happens, I suppose.\n\nBut to be efficient, we should plan valid actions.\n\nFor Alice at (4,1), she can:\n\n- Move up: but (4,2) is kitchen counter, non-empty, so she cannot move there. Similarly, move down to (4,0) pot, cannot. Move left to (3,1) or right to (5,1), both likely empty, so possible.\n\n- Change orientation to U, D, L, R: this just changes facing.\n\n- Interact: since facing up, she can interact with (4,2).\n\n- Stay.\n\nSo for turn 72, best action is Interact to pick up onion from (4,2).\n\nThen she holds onion.\n\nNow to put it in a pot, say (4,0). She needs to be at (4,1) facing down to interact with (4,0).\n\nCurrently after turn 72, she is at (4,1), but orientation? After interact, she might still be facing up, or does interact change orientation? Probably not, orientation remains unless changed.\n\nAction history doesn't show orientation change, so orientation persists.\n\nAfter turn 72: she does 'I', picks up onion, still at (4,1) facing up.\n\nThen turn 73: she can change orientation to down, so action 'D' for change orientation down? But actions are specified as U,D,L,R for move or change orientation, but we need to distinguish.\n\nIn the answer format, actions are from {U, D, L, R, I, S}, so U,D,L,R can mean move or change orientation? But the list is the same symbols.\n\nProblem: the actions are given as symbols, but for U,D,L,R, it can be move or change orientation depending on context? But the description has separate: Move (L/R/U/D) and Change Orientation (L/R/U/D), but in the action set, it's the same letters.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"each action \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, L, R, I, S\\}\\)\", so U,D,L,R are used for both move and change orientation? But that's ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps in this context, U,D,L,R always mean move in that direction, and to change orientation, you use a different way? But the action list includes only these.\n\nLet's see the action history: Alice: R, D, I, U, U\n\nBob: I, L, L, I, R\n\nFor Alice, R: move right, D: move down, I: interact, U: move up, U: move up.\n\nSimilarly for Bob, I: interact, L: move left, L: move left, I: interact, R: move right.\n\nSo in history, U,D,L,R are used for move actions, not for change orientation separately. Change orientation might not be a separate action; instead, when you move, you change orientation to that direction, and if you can't move, you might change orientation? But the description has \"Change Orientation\" as a separate action.\n\nContradiction.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when you move, you change position and orientation to the direction moved.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is poorly worded.\n\nI think it means that Change Orientation action changes your orientation to the specified direction, and if you are trying to move but the tile is not empty, you don't move, but for Change Orientation, it's only orientation change.\n\nBut in the action set, both use U,D,L,R, so how to specify?\n\nPerhaps in the action sequence, when you write U, it could mean move up or change orientation up, but the context determines.\n\nBut in the history, all U,D,L,R are followed by position change, so they are move actions.\n\nFor example, Alice: R (probably moved right), D (moved down), U (moved up), etc.\n\nBob: L (moved left), L (moved left), R (moved right).\n\nSo in practice, U,D,L,R are used for move actions, and Change Orientation might be done by not moving or something, but it's not listed separately.\n\nThe action list is {U, D, L, R, I, S}, so S for stay, I for interact, and U/D/L/R for move in that direction.\n\nChange orientation might not be a direct action; you can only change orientation by moving or by using Change Orientation action, but since it's not in the list, perhaps it's not available.\n\nLet's read the rules again:\n\n\"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n- Interact (I): ...\n- Stay (S): Do nothing.\"\n\nAnd actions are from {U, D, L, R, I, S}, so U can mean Move U or Change Orientation U, but it's ambiguous.\n\nIn the action history, it's used for move, as positions change.\n\nFor Change Orientation, it might be that when you use U/D/L/R for change orientation, it's the same symbol, but you don't move.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to know what is intended.\n\nTo resolve, I think for planning, we can assume that U/D/L/R as actions can be used for move or for change orientation, but from the context, when a player is adjacent to a non-empty tile, they might use Change Orientation to face it, then interact.\n\nIn Alice's case, at (4,1) facing up, she can interact with (4,2) with 'I'.\n\nIf she wants to interact with (4,0), she needs to face down, so she can use 'D' for change orientation down, then 'I' to interact.\n\nSimilarly, 'D' could mean move down or change orientation down.\n\nBut if she is at (4,1), and she does 'D', if 'D' means move down, she cannot because (4,0) is non-empty, so move fails. If 'D' means change orientation down, then she changes facing to down.\n\nIn the rules, it's listed as separate actions, but with the same symbols, it's confusing.\n\nPerhaps the action 'D' can be interpreted based on whether a move is possible or not, but that's messy for planning.\n\nTo simplify, I think for this task, we can use U/D/L/R for move actions only, and for change orientation, it might not be needed separately, or we use it when necessary.\n\nBut in the action history, for Alice, she did 'D' which likely moved her down, but from where? Her position changed.\n\nLet's see Alice's action history: R, D, I, U, U\n\nTurn 72 is current, so history is previous actions.\n\nAction history is for past turns, with most recent at the end.\n\nFor Alice, action history: R (turn 67?), D (68), I (69), U (70), U (71). Turn 71 is U, so she moved up to (4,1) from (4,0)? Let's see.\n\nShe is at (4,1) now, orientation up.\n\nBefore that, she did U at turn 71, so she moved up to (4,1) from (4,0)? But (4,0) is a pot, non-empty, she can't be on it. Contradiction.\n\nPositions: she is at (4,1) now.\n\nIf at turn 71 she did U, moving up, she must have been at (4,0) but (4,0) is pot, not walkable, so she couldn't be there.\n\nPerhaps she was at (4,1) and moved U to (4,2), but (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she couldn't move there.\n\nProblem.\n\nLet's assume the grid has empty tiles around.\n\nFor example, (4,1) is empty, (3,1) is empty, (5,1) is empty, (4,0) is pot, (4,2) is counter, so from (4,1), moving U to (4,2) is invalid since not empty, so she stays at (4,1) but orientation changes to U? But the move action changes position and orientation, but if move invalid, position doesn't change, orientation might change or not?\n\nThe rules don't specify.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nTo avoid complexity, I'll assume that for move actions, if the target tile is empty and walkable, she moves and changes orientation; if not, she doesn't move, and orientation might change or not, but to be safe, let's assume orientation changes to the direction even if move invalid, but position same.\n\nBut that might not be efficient.\n\nFor Interact, she needs to be facing the tile.\n\nFor Alice at (4,1) facing up, she can interact with (4,2) with 'I'.\n\nShe can also move left to (3,1) or right to (5,1), both likely empty.\n\nOr move down, but (4,0) not empty, so if she does 'D', she might not move, but orientation changes to down.\n\nThen she can interact with (4,0).\n\nSimilarly, for planning, I think we can use 'D' to change orientation down if needed.\n\nBut in the sequence, we'll write the action.\n\nFor turn 72, Alice should do 'I' to pick up onion from (4,2).\n\nThen she has onion.\n\nThen she needs to put it in a pot. Pot at (4,0) below.\n\nSo turn 73: she can do 'D' to change orientation to down (assuming 'D' can mean change orientation when move is invalid or explicitly).\n\nSince (4,0) is below, and she is at (4,1), doing 'D' for move down is invalid, so she changes orientation to down.\n\nThen turn 74: she can do 'I' to interact with the pot and add the onion.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nBut let's involve Bob as well.\n\nBob is at (2,3) facing right, holding nothing.\n\nHe can move or interact.\n\nNear him, (2,2) is kitchen counter with onion below him, but he is facing right, so not facing it.\n\n(2,4) is kitchen counter with onion? (2,4) is listed as kitchen counter, but not specified with item, in \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" we have (2,4)? Let's see: \"Kitchen Counter on (6,4): contains a onion; ... on (2,4): \" (2,4) is in the list: \"Kitchen Counter on (2,4): \" it says \"Kitchen Counter on (5,4): contains a onion; \" but (2,4) is not listed in the non-empty section.\n\nThe non-empty kitchen counters are: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2), (4,2), (2,0), (2,2), (0,3)\n\n(2,4) is a kitchen counter but not listed as having item, so it might be empty or not, but since not mentioned, likely empty.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) has onion, (0,3) has onion, etc.\n\nBob at (2,3) facing right.\n\nHe can move up to (2,4), but (2,4) is kitchen counter, non-empty, cannot walk on. Move down to (2,2), also counter, cannot. Move left to (1,3)? If empty, possible. Move right to (3,3), if empty, possible.\n\nOr change orientation to interact with something.\n\nFor example, to interact with (2,2), he needs to face down.\n\nSo he can do 'D' to change orientation down, then 'I' to pick up onion if available.\n\nBut (2,2) has onion, so he can grab it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) above, he can face up and interact if it has item, but not listed, so probably no item.\n\n(0,3) has onion, but it's at (0,3), he is at (2,3), not adjacent directly; (1,3) is between, likely empty.\n\nSo for Bob, he can go to (2,2) to get onion.\n\nBut he needs to be at (2,3) facing down to interact with (2,2).\n\nCurrently facing right.\n\nSo turn 72 for Bob: he can do 'D' to change orientation to down, then turn 73 'I' to pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nBut I'm planning for Alice, but I can suggest for Bob or coordinate.\n\nThe task is to plan for Alice, but optionally for Bob, to maximize reward.\n\nSince both players can act, I should plan for both to collaborate.\n\nThe answer format is for Alice, but I can include Bob's actions if needed, or just assume they coordinate.\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I can plan for both.\n\nIn the output, it might be for Alice only, but to show coordination, I should include both.\n\nThe answer format shows only actions for Alice, like \"Turn t1: a_t1\" for Alice.\n\nLet's see: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice\" and \"Answer Format: Turn t1: a_{t1} Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1} ...\" so it seems only Alice's actions.\n\nBut to maximize, I need to consider what Bob does.\n\nPerhaps I can assume Bob is also acting rationally, or I can suggest.\n\nSince Bob's state is given, I can plan Alice's actions based on expected Bob actions.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's assume both are controlled, and I plan for both.\n\nBut the output should be for Alice only.\n\nI think for the plan, I'll provide Alice's actions, and describe what Bob should do, but in the box, only Alice's actions.\n\nTo be precise, I'll plan Alice's actions with the assumption that Bob is cooperating.\n\nFirst, let's fill a pot.\n\nThere are two pots: (3,0) and (4,0), both empty.\n\nAlice can start with the onion from (4,2).\n\nTurn 72: Alice does 'I' to pick up onion from (4,2). Now holding onion.\n\nPosition (4,1), orientation up (after interact, orientation may not change, so still up).\n\nThen she needs to put it in a pot, say (4,0).\n\nTo interact with (4,0), she needs to face down.\n\nSo turn 73: she can change orientation to down. How? With 'D' action. Since move down is invalid, 'D' can be change orientation down.\n\nThen turn 74: 'I' to add onion to pot.\n\nBut after turn 72, she is at (4,1), facing up.\n\nTurn 73: if she does 'D', assuming it changes orientation to down since move invalid.\n\nThen turn 74: 'I' to interact with (4,0), add onion. Now pot at (4,0) has one onion.\n\nAlice is empty-handed.\n\nBob can be getting another onion.\n\nBob at (2,3) facing right.\n\nTurn 72: Bob can change orientation to down with 'D' (change orientation).\n\nThen turn 73: 'I' to pick up onion from (2,2), now holding onion.\n\nThen he can go to a pot to add it.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0). (4,0) is being used, so he can use (3,0).\n\nFrom (2,3), to go to (3,0), he needs to move.\n\nFirst, after picking onion, he is at (2,3), facing down (after interact).\n\nThen he can move right to (3,3), if empty.\n\n(3,3) not listed, so likely empty.\n\nThen down to (3,2), but (3,2) is kitchen counter with onion, non-empty, cannot move there.\n\n(3,2) has onion, so he can interact but not move on.\n\nFrom (3,3), to interact with (3,2) below, he needs to face down.\n\nPositions: (2,3) to (3,3) is right, then to (3,2) is down, but (3,2) non-empty.\n\nSo from (2,3) after picking onion, he can move right to (3,3) (turn 74 for Bob? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 72: \n- Alice: I (pick onion from (4,2))\n- Bob: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 73:\n- Alice: D (change orientation to down)  // since at (4,1), move down invalid, so change orientation\n- Bob: I (pick onion from (2,2))  // now Bob holding onion\n\nTurn 74:\n- Alice: I (add onion to pot at (4,0))  // pot now has one onion, Alice empty\n- Bob: R (move right to (3,3))  // assuming (3,3) empty\n\nNow Bob at (3,3), holding onion, facing? After move right, orientation right.\n\nHe wants to add onion to pot at (3,0). (3,0) is below, so from (3,3), he needs to go down to interact.\n\nFirst, move down to (3,2), but (3,2) is counter, cannot move there.\n\nSo he must be at a tile adjacent to (3,0).\n\n(3,0) has adjacent tiles: above (3,1), left (2,0), right (4,0), below? y-1, but y=0, probably no below, or out of bound.\n\nAdjacent: north (3,1), south? if y increases up, U is y+1, so north is y+1, south y-1.\n\n(3,0) at y=0, so south might not exist or not walkable.\n\nAdjacent tiles: (3,1) north, (2,0) west, (4,0) east.\n\n(3,1) is likely empty, not listed.\n\n(2,0) is kitchen counter with onion, non-empty.\n\n(4,0) is pot, non-empty.\n\nSo to interact with (3,0), Bob can be at (3,1) facing down.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move down to (3,2) but cannot, so he needs to go to (3,1).\n\nHow to get to (3,1) from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move down? (3,2) not empty, cannot. Move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) to (3,1): he can move left to (2,3), then down to (2,2) cannot, not direct.\n\n(3,3) to (3,1): he can move down to (3,2) but invalid, so he must go around.\n\nFor example, move left to (2,3), then down? (2,2) not empty, cannot move to (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,3), he can move down only if (2,2) empty, but not, so he can only move left to (1,3) or right to (3,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (3,1), from (3,3), he can move left to (2,3), then move down? No, (2,2) blocked.\n\nMove right to (4,3), then down to (4,2) cannot, etc.\n\n(4,2) is counter, not empty.\n\nThe only way is to go to (3,1) from north or south, but (3,1) is at y=1, (3,3) at y=3.\n\nHe can move to (4,3) if empty, then to (4,2) cannot, or to (3,4) but (3,4) is onion dispenser, not empty.\n\nList empty tiles.\n\nAssume the grid has (3,1) empty, (3,3) empty.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move down to (3,2) but (3,2) is counter, not empty, cannot.\n\nMove left to (2,3), which is empty.\n\nFrom (2,3), he can move down to (2,2) cannot.\n\nMove left to (1,3), if empty.\n\n(1,3) not listed, likely empty.\n\nThen from (1,3), move down to (1,2)? (1,2) not listed, but (2,2) is counter at (2,2), so (1,2) might be empty.\n\nThen from (1,2), he can move right to (2,2) cannot.\n\nTo reach (3,1), he can go to (4,3) from (3,3), then to (4,2) cannot.\n\nPerhaps from (3,3) move down is invalid, so he can only move horizontally or to other directions where empty.\n\nFor example, move right to (4,3) if empty.\n\n(4,3) not listed, likely empty.\n\nThen from (4,3), move down to (4,2) cannot.\n\nMove down to (4,2) invalid.\n\nSo he is stuck at (3,3) or can move to other places.\n\n(3,1) can be accessed from (3,0) but not directly.\n\nPlayers can be at (3,1), which is adjacent north to (3,0) pot.\n\n(3,1) is not listed as any counter, so likely empty tile.\n\nHow to get to (3,1) from (3,3).\n\nOne way: from (3,3) move left to (2,3), then move left to (1,3), then move down to (1,2), then move down to (1,1) if exists, then move right to (2,1), then to (3,1), etc. Long way.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, Bob can put the onion on a counter first, then go to the pot area.\n\nBut it might be inefficient.\n\nAnother pot is at (4,0), but Alice is using it.\n\nBoth can use the same pot, but pot can hold multiple ingredients.\n\nPot can be used by both.\n\nPot at (4,0) already has one onion from Alice.\n\nBob can add to the same pot.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can go to (4,3), then to (4,2) cannot, so to (4,1) where Alice was.\n\n(4,1) is empty.\n\nFrom (3,3), move right to (4,3), then move down to (4,2) invalid, so he can move down only if (4,2) empty, not, so he can move down from (4,3) to (4,2) not possible, so he must move to (4,3) then to (5,3) or something.\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down? No, (4,2) below not empty.\n\nMove left to (3,3), or move up to (4,4) but (4,4) is onion dispenser, non-empty.\n\nSo from (3,3), the only moves are to (2,3), (4,3), or (3,4) if possible, but (3,4) is dispenser.\n\n(3,4) is onion dispenser, so non-empty, cannot move to.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) non-empty.\n\nSo Bob at (3,3) can only move to (2,3) left or (4,3) right or (3,2) down but invalid, so only horizontal to (2,3) or (4,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down to (4,2) invalid, or move right to (5,3) if empty.\n\n(5,3) not listed, likely empty.\n\nThen from (5,3), move down to (5,2), but (5,2) is kitchen counter, non-empty, cannot.\n\nSo he can go to (5,3), then to (6,3) etc, but not towards the pot.\n\nTo reach (3,1), he can go to (2,3), then to (1,3), then to (1,2), then to (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (3,1), assuming these tiles exist and are empty.\n\nBut it's many moves.\n\nSince there is a kitchen counter at (3,2) with onion, Bob at (3,3) can interact with it if he faces down.\n\nFrom (3,3), facing down, he can interact with (3,2) to pick up the onion or something, but he is holding an onion already, so he can place it on the counter if the counter is empty, but (3,2) has onion, so it's occupied, he can't place.\n\nInteract with counter: if player holding item and counter empty, place item; if player empty-handed and counter occupied, pick up item.\n\nHere, Bob holding onion, (3,2) occupied with onion, so he can't interact to pick up or place; it would do nothing or not possible.\n\nSo better to go to the pot area directly.\n\nFor now, to save time, Bob can add to the same pot at (4,0).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can go to (4,3), then to (4,2) cannot, so to (4,1).\n\nHow to get to (4,1)?\n\nFrom (3,3), move right to (4,3) (turn 74 Bob: R to (4,3))\n\nTurn 75: from (4,3), move down to (4,2) invalid, so he can do 'D' to change orientation down, then if he can interact with (4,2), but (4,2) has onion, he is holding onion, so he can't pick up, and counter occupied, can't place, so interact does nothing.\n\nThen he needs to move to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3), he can move down only if (4,2) empty, not, so he must move to other tile, like (5,3), then (5,2) not empty, or (4,4) not empty.\n\nThe only adjacent to (4,3) are (4,2) south, (4,4) north, (3,3) west, (5,3) east.\n\n(4,2) not empty, (4,4) not empty, (3,3) empty, (5,3) empty.\n\nSo he can move to (5,3) or back to (3,3).\n\nFrom (5,3), he can move down to (5,2) not empty, move up to (5,4) but (5,4) is kitchen counter with onion, not empty, so only to (4,3) or (6,3) if empty.\n\n(6,3) not listed, likely empty.\n\nThen to (6,2) but (6,2) not listed, (6,0) is counter, but (6,2) might be empty.\n\nThis is taking too long; I think for efficiency, since there are onions near the pots, Bob can go to (3,1) directly if possible.\n\nAssume that (3,1) is accessible via (2,1) or from above.\n\nAnother idea: Bob can deliver the onion to the pot at (3,0) by being at (3,1) facing down.\n\nBut to get to (3,1), from his position, it might be easier to go via the left side.\n\nBob at (2,3) after picking onion at turn 73.\n\nTurn 74: he can move left to (1,3), assuming (1,3) empty.\n\nThen turn 75: move down to (1,2), assuming (1,2) empty.\n\nThen turn 76: move down to (1,1), if exists and empty.\n\nThen turn 77: move right to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut this is many turns, not efficient.\n\nSince the pot at (4,0) has one onion, and Alice is there, Bob can add to it.\n\nAlice is at (4,1) after adding onion.\n\nAfter turn 74, Alice at (4,1), empty, facing down (after interact).\n\nShe can get another onion.\n\nFor example, (3,2) has onion, at (3,2), which is left of (4,1)? (4,1) to (3,2) is not adjacent; adjacent are (4,2) north, (4,0) south, (3,1) west, (5,1) east.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so from (4,1), she can move left to (3,1), then face north to interact with (3,2).\n\n(3,1) is likely empty.\n\nSo for Alice, after turn 74, she is at (4,1) facing down.\n\nTurn 75: move left to (3,1), so action 'L', move left, now at (3,1), orientation left.\n\nThen she can interact with (3,2) which is north, but she is facing left, so not facing.\n\nTurn 76: change orientation to up, with 'U' for move up or change? Move up to (3,2) invalid, so 'U' to change orientation up.\n\nThen turn 77: 'I' to pick up onion from (3,2).\n\nBut meanwhile, the pot needs two more onions.\n\nBob can add one.\n\nBut Bob is far.\n\nPerhaps use the onions on counters near the pots.\n\nFor example, (3,2) has onion, (4,2) has onion, but (4,2) is above (4,1), Alice can interact if facing up.\n\nAfter turn 74, Alice at (4,1) facing down.\n\nTurn 75: she can change orientation to up with 'U' (change orientation).\n\nThen turn 76: 'I' to pick up onion from (4,2), but (4,2) had onion, she picked it at turn 72, and it's not replenished, so after she picked it, it's empty now.\n\nAt turn 72, she picked onion from (4,2), so (4,2) is now empty, no item.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) has onion, not picked yet.\n\nSo (4,2) is empty.\n\nAlice at (4,1) facing down, can turn to up and interact, but (4,2) empty, so nothing.\n\nShe can go to (3,2).\n\nAs above.\n\nBut let's restart with a better plan.\n\nSince there are many onions on counters, Alice and Bob can each grab one and add to the pot quickly.\n\nAlice at (4,1) facing up, turn 72: 'I' to pick onion from (4,2) -- but (4,2) has onion, she picks it, now holding onion, (4,2) empty.\n\nThen she turns to face down: turn 73: 'D' to change orientation down (since move down invalid).\n\nTurn 74: 'I' to add onion to pot at (4,0). Pot now has 1 onion, Alice empty at (4,1) facing down.\n\nNow she can grab another onion from nearby, e.g. (3,2) has onion.\n\nTo do that, she needs to be at (3,1) or (4,2) but (4,2) empty, or (3,2) directly not possible.\n\nFrom (4,1), move left to (3,1): turn 75: 'L' move left to (3,1), orientation left.\n\nThen at (3,1), facing left, but (3,2) is north, so she needs to face up.\n\nTurn 76: 'U' to change orientation up (move up to (3,2) invalid).\n\nTurn 77: 'I' to pick onion from (3,2). Now holding onion.\n\nThen she can add to pot at (4,0) or (3,0).\n\nPot at (4,0) has 1 onion, so she can add to it.\n\nFrom (3,1), to interact with (4,0) east, but she is facing up, not east.\n\n(4,0) is at (4,0), south-east from (3,1)? Adjacent are north (3,2), south (3,0) but (3,0) is pot, non-empty, so she can interact with (3,0) if facing south, or with (4,0) if facing east.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can face south to interact with (3,0) pot.\n\nOr face east to interact with (4,0) pot.\n\nSince (4,0) has one onion, she can add to it.\n\nTurn 78: change orientation to east with 'R' (move right to (4,1) but (4,1) is empty, so if she does 'R', she moves right to (4,1), orientation right.\n\nThen at (4,1), facing right, but (4,0) is south, not adjacent in facing; from (4,1), (4,0) is below, so she needs to face down.\n\nTurn 79: 'D' to change orientation down.\n\nTurn 80: 'I' to add onion to (4,0).\n\nPot now has 2 onions.\n\nStill need one more.\n\nBob can provide the third onion.\n\nBob at (2,3) facing right.\n\nTurn 72: 'D' to change orientation down (to face (2,2))\n\nTurn 73: 'I' to pick onion from (2,2), now holding onion.\n\nThen he can go to (3,1) to add to pot.\n\nFrom (2,3), move left to (1,3): turn 74: 'L' move left to (1,3), orientation left.\n\nThen move down to (1,2): turn 75: 'D' move down to (1,2), orientation down.\n\nThen move down to (1,1), if exists and empty, turn 76: 'D' to (1,1).\n\nThen move right to (2,1): turn 77: 'R' to (2,1), orientation right.\n\nThen move right to (3,1): turn 78: 'R' to (3,1), orientation right.\n\nAt (3,1), facing right, he can interact with (4,0) if facing south, or with (3,0) if facing south.\n\nTo interact with (3,0), he needs to face south.\n\nTurn 79: 'D' to change orientation down.\n\nTurn 80: 'I' to add onion to (3,0) or (4,0)? He is at (3,1), facing down, can interact with (3,0) pot.\n\nBut (3,0) is empty pot, while (4,0) has 2 onions.\n\nHe can add to (4,0) by facing east and interacting, but from (3,1), (4,0) is not adjacent; adjacent are (3,2) north, (3,0) south, (2,1) west, (4,1) east.\n\n(4,0) is south-east, not adjacent directly.\n\nFrom (3,1), he can only interact with (3,0) south or (4,1) east.\n\n(4,1) is empty tile.\n\nTo interact with (4,0), he needs to be at (4,1) facing down.\n\nBut Alice might be there.\n\nAt turn 80, Alice is at (4,1) adding onion, so Bob can go to (4,1) later.\n\nBut let's see the timeline.\n\nAlso, the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions at turn 80, needs one more.\n\nBob can add to it if he has onion.\n\nAt turn 80, Bob is at (3,1) facing down, he can interact with (3,0) to add onion, but (3,0) is empty, so he would start a new pot, but we want to fill one pot first to cook.\n\nBetter to add to the existing pot at (4,0).\n\nSo Bob should go to (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), turn 81: move right to (4,1), action 'R', now at (4,1), orientation right.\n\nThen turn 82: change orientation to down with 'D' (move down invalid, so change).\n\nTurn 83: 'I' to add onion to (4,0).\n\nPot now has 3 onions at turn 83, cooking starts.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so at turn 88, it is cooked.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice and Bob can prepare for serving.\n\nFirst, get plates from dispenser at (0,2).\n\nThen serve at (7,2).\n\nAlso, after adding the third onion, Alice and Bob are free.\n\nBut let's calculate the turns.\n\nFirst, let's list Alice's actions from turn 72.\n\nTurn 72: 'I' pick onion from (4,2)\n\nThen turn 73: 'D' change orientation down (to face (4,0))\n\nTurn 74: 'I' add onion to (4,0)  // pot has 1\n\nTurn 75: 'L' move left to (3,1)  // now at (3,1), orientation left\n\nTurn 76: 'U' change orientation up (to face (3,2))\n\nTurn 77: 'I' pick onion from (3,2)  // holding onion\n\nNow to add to pot. She can add to (3,0) or (4,0).\n\n(3,0) is closer.\n\nFrom (3,1), facing up after interact? After 'I', orientation may not change, so facing up.\n\nTo interact with (3,0) south, need to face down.\n\nTurn 78: 'D' change orientation down\n\nTurn 79: 'I' add onion to (3,0)  // now (3,0) has 1 onion, but we want to fill one pot.\n\nShe added to (3,0) instead of (4,0).\n\nAt turn 74, (4,0) has 1 onion.\n\nIf she adds to (4,0) at turn 79, but from (3,1), she can go to (4,1).\n\nTurn 77 after picking onion, at (3,1) facing up.\n\nTurn 78: 'R' move right to (4,1), orientation right\n\nTurn 79: 'D' change orientation down (to face (4,0))\n\nTurn 80: 'I' add onion to (4,0)  // pot has 2 onions\n\nThen for Bob, he can add the third.\n\nBut in Alice's actions, she has done.\n\nBob at turn 73 has onion.\n\nHe needs to go to (4,1) to add.\n\nFrom (2,3), after turn 73: at (2,3) facing down (after interact)\n\nTurn 74: 'L' move left to (1,3), orientation left\n\nTurn 75: 'D' move down to (1,2), orientation down  // assume (1,2) empty\n\nTurn 76: 'D' move down to (1,1), orientation down  // assume (1,1) empty\n\nTurn 77: 'R' move right to (2,1), orientation right\n\nTurn 78: 'R' move right to (3,1), orientation right\n\nTurn 79: 'R' move right to (4,1), orientation right  // now at (4,1)\n\nBut at turn 79, Alice is also at (4,1) or moving?\n\nAt turn 79 Alice: from above, at turn 78 she moved to (4,1), so at turn 79 she is at (4,1) facing right, then she does 'D' to change orientation down.\n\nBob at turn 79 moves to (4,1), but players cannot walk onto each other, so if Alice is at (4,1), Bob cannot move there.\n\nConflict.\n\nTurn 79: Alice is at (4,1) doing 'D' change orientation.\n\nBob at turn 79 is moving to (4,1), but Alice is there, so he cannot move to (4,1), action fails or he stays.\n\nThen turn 80: Alice does 'I' to add onion, so (4,0) has 2 onions.\n\nBob at (4,1) cannot be, so he is at (3,1) or where.\n\nAt turn 78 Bob moved to (3,1), at turn 79 he tries to move to (4,1) but occupied, so he stays at (3,1) orientation right.\n\nThen turn 80: he can change orientation down 'D' to face (3,0)\n\nTurn 81: 'I' add onion to (3,0)  // (3,0) has 1 onion\n\nBut (4,0) has 2, not full.\n\nThen at turn 81, (4,0) has 2 onions, needs one more.\n\nAlice is empty at (4,1) after turn 80.\n\nShe can get another onion.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) or elsewhere.\n\n(2,2) has onion, but far.\n\nOr (5,4) has onion, but far.\n\nDispensers at (3,4), (4,4).\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nTo save time, since there are many onions on counters, Alice can get one quickly.\n\nFor example, at (4,1), she can go to (5,1) or something.\n\n(7,1) has onion, but far.\n\nKitchen counter on (7,1): contains onion.\n\nBut (7,1) is far from (4,1).\n\nAlice at (4,1) after turn 80, facing down.\n\nShe can move right to (5,1), then to (6,1), etc.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps after the first onion, Alice and Bob should coordinate to fill one pot quickly.\n\nFor example, Alice adds first onion to (4,0) at turn 74.\n\nThen she is at (4,1) empty.\n\nInstead of going to (3,2), she can stay and let Bob add, but Bob is slow.\n\nBob can add the second onion if he is closer.\n\nAt turn 73, Bob has onion at (2,3).\n\nHe can go directly to (4,1) via fewer moves.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,2) cannot, so to (4,3) then to (5,3) etc.\n\nOr to (3,3) then to (3,2) cannot, so he can go to (4,3) then to (5,3), then to (5,2) cannot, to (5,4) cannot, to (6,3) then to (6,2) if empty.\n\nAssume (6,2) empty, then to (6,1), then to (5,1), then to (4,1).\n\nMany turns.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,3) to (1,2) to (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1), 6 moves.\n\nAt turn 73 Bob has onion, turn 74 move to (1,3), turn 75 to (1,2), turn 76 to (1,1), turn 77 to (2,1), turn 78 to (3,1), turn 79 to (4,1).\n\nThen at turn 79, Alice is at (4,1) from turn 78, so at turn 79, Alice is at (4,1) changing orientation, Bob tries to move to (4,1) but occupied, so he stays at (3,1).\n\nThen turn 80 Alice adds onion to (4,0), (4,0) has 2.\n\nBob at (3,1) can add to (3,0) or to (4,0).\n\nTo add to (4,0), he needs to be at (4,1) facing down.\n\nTurn 80: Bob at (3,1) facing east (after move attempt), he can move to (4,1) but Alice is there, so cannot.\n\nTurn 81: Alice moves away or something.\n\nAfter turn 80, Alice is at (4,1) facing down, empty.\n\nShe can move away to let Bob in.\n\nTurn 81: Alice move right to (5,1), action 'R', to (5,1), orientation right.\n\nThen Bob at turn 81: move right to (4,1), 'R', to (4,1), orientation right.\n\nTurn 82: Bob 'D' change orientation down\n\nTurn 83: Bob 'I' add onion to (4,0) // pot has 3, cooking starts at turn 83.\n\nThen at turn 88, cooked.\n\nNow for serving, need a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice or Bob can get it.\n\nAlice is at (5,1), turn 81.\n\nShe can go to (0,2).\n\nFrom (5,1) to (0,2): move left to (4,1) but occupied, to (3,1) etc, or via other path.\n\nBob is at (4,1) after adding, turn 83, empty.\n\nHe can go to get plate.\n\nBut (0,2) is far.\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nAlso, there are onions on counters that can be used for another soup.\n\nBut first, let's focus on one delivery.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so from turn 83 to 88.\n\nAt turn 83, Bob at (4,1) empty.\n\nHe can go to (0,2) to get plate.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (0,2): move left to (3,1), then to (2,1), to (1,1), to (1,2), to (1,3), to (0,3) but (0,3) kitchen counter with onion, not empty, so cannot move to.\n\n(0,2) is plate dispenser, non-empty.\n\nTo reach (0,2), he needs to be at adjacent empty tile, like (0,1) or (1,2) or (0,3) but (0,3) not empty.\n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter with item? \"Kitchen Counter on (0,1): \" not listed in non-empty, so might be empty or not.\n\n\"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" lists specific ones, so (0,1) is kitchen counter but not listed, so likely empty or no item, but the tile is non-empty, so cannot walk on.\n\nKitchen counter tile is always non-empty tile, so players cannot walk on it, only interact from adjacent.\n\nSo to interact with (0,2) plate dispenser, adjacent tiles are (0,1), (0,3), (1,2).\n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter, non-empty, not walkable.\n\n(0,3) is kitchen counter with onion, non-empty, not walkable.\n\n(1,2) might be empty tile.\n\nSo players can be at (1,2) facing west to interact with (0,2).\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) needs to be empty and accessible.\n\nFrom (4,1), to (1,2): move left to (3,1), to (2,1), to (1,1), to (1,2).\n\nAssume (1,1) and (1,2) empty.\n\nBob at (4,1) turn 83.\n\nTurn 84: 'L' move left to (3,1), orientation left\n\nTurn 85: 'L' move left to (2,1), orientation left\n\nTurn 86: 'D' move down to (1,1), orientation down  // assume (1,1) empty\n\nTurn 87: 'U' move up to (1,2)? (1,2) is at y=2, U is y+1, so from (1,1) move U to (1,2), orientation up.\n\nAt (1,2), facing up, but to interact with (0,2) west, need to face west.\n\nTurn 88: 'L' change orientation left (move left to (0,2) invalid, so change orientation west)\n\nTurn 89: 'I' to grab plate from dispenser.\n\nNow holding plate.\n\nThen go to (4,0) to serve soup.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (4,0): many moves.\n\nTurn 90: move right to (2,2) cannot, so move down to (1,1), 'D' move down to (1,1)\n\nTurn 91: 'R' move right to (2,1)\n\nTurn 92: 'R' move right to (3,1)\n\nTurn 93: 'R' move right to (4,1)\n\nAt (4,1), facing right, need to face down to interact with (4,0).\n\nTurn 94: 'D' change orientation down\n\nTurn 95: 'I' to serve soup from pot to plate? Interact with pot: if player holding clean plate and pot has cooked soup, serve soup.\n\nAt turn 95, the soup is cooked since cooking started at turn 83, turn 88 cooked, so yes.\n\nThen turn 95: 'I' to serve, now holding soup in plate.\n\nThen deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (7,2): move right to (5,1), then to (6,1), then to (7,1), but (7,1) kitchen counter with onion, not empty, so cannot move to.\n\nAdjacent to (7,2) serving counter are (7,1), (7,3), (6,2).\n\n(7,1) counter, not walkable, (7,3) counter with onion?

She can move to other place, but for H=10, up to turn 81.\n\nBut let's say for 10 turns from 72 to 81.\n\nTurn 80: S or move.\n\nSince (3,0) has one onion, she can get another onion to add.\n\nFor example, (2,0) has onion, at (2,1) she can face down and interact.\n\nFrom (3,1), turn 80: 'L' move left to (2,1)\n\nTurn 81: 'D' change orientation down\n\nTurn 82: 'I' pick onion from (2,0)\n\netc.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide the sequence as above.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 72: I\n\nTurn 73: D\n\nTurn 74: I\n\nTurn 75: L\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: I\n\nTurn 78: D\n\nTurn 79: I\n\nThen for turn 80, she can stay or move, but let's say S for now.\n\nTo make it complete, up to turn 81.\n\nTurn 80: L  // move left to (2,1)\n\nBut I think for the box, I'll put the sequence from 72 to 79 or 81.\n\nSince the task is to maximize reward, with this, they can start cooking at (4,0) with 1 onion, not full, so not cooking.\n\nWith Alice's actions, at turn 74, (4,0) has 1, at turn 80 she adds to (3,0), so pots have 1 each, not cooking.\n\nBob needs to add more.\n\nBut since we plan only Alice, it's partial.\n\nPerhaps Alice should focus on one pot.\n\nFor example, after turn 74, she adds to (4,0), then she gets another onion and adds to (4,0) again.\n\nFrom turn 75, she moves to (3,1), gets onion from (3,2), then goes back to (4,1), adds to (4,0).\n\nTurn 75: L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 76: U to change orientation up\n\nTurn 77: I pick onion\n\nTurn 78: R move right to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: D change orientation down\n\nTurn 80: I add to (4,0)  // now (4,0) has 2 onions\n\nThen she can get a third onion.\n\nBut for H=10, it's ok.\n\nI think I should include the sequence in the box.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 72: I\n\nTurn 73: D\n\nTurn 74: I\n\nTurn 75: L\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: I\n\nTurn 78: R\n\nTurn 79: D\n\nTurn 80: I  // add to (4,0), now 2 onions\n\nThen turn 81: she can go to get another onion or let Bob add.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll provide up to turn 81 with action.\n\nTurn 81: S or move.\n\nSince the task is to plan for several turns, I'll do 10 turns: from turn 72 to 81.\n\nTurn 72: I\n\nTurn 73: D\n\nTurn 74: I\n\nTurn 75: L\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: I\n\nTurn 78: R\n\nTurn 79: D\n\nTurn 80: I\n\nTurn 81: S  // or something\n\nBut at turn 80 she adds, so at turn 81 she is at (4,1) facing down, empty, so she can move to (5,1) or stay.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nSo the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should collaborate to fill a pot with 3 onions as quickly as possible, allowing the soup to cook for 5 turns, and then deliver it using a plate from the dispenser. Given the current game state at turn 72, Alice is positioned at (4,1) facing up and holding nothing, with an onion available on the kitchen counter at (4,2). Bob is at (2,3) facing right and holding nothing, with an onion available on the kitchen counter at (2,2). The pots at (3,0) and (4,0) are empty, and the recipe requires 3 onions for a reward of 20, cooking in 5 turns.\n\n### Coordination Strategy:\n- **Alice's Role:** Alice should focus on adding onions to the pot at (4,0) using nearby onions from counters. Starting from her position, she can immediately pick up the onion from (4,2) and add it to the pot at (4,0). She can then gather another onion from (3,2) to add to the same pot, bringing it to 2 onions quickly. Bob can provide the third onion to the same pot.\n- **Bob's Role (for Coordination):** Bob should pick up the onion from (2,2), then move to (4,1) to add it to the pot at (4,0). This fills the pot to 3 onions, starting the cooking process. After cooking, Bob can fetch a plate from (0,2) and serve the soup at (7,2) while Alice continues gathering for the next soup.\n- **Optimization:** Using onions from nearby counters (e.g., (4,2) and (3,2)) saves time compared to dispensers. Alice's actions are planned for the next 10 turns (H=10), ensuring she contributes efficiently to filling the pot. By turn 82, the pot should have 3 onions (if Bob adds the third), and cooking starts. The soup will be ready by turn 87, allowing delivery shortly after.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (turns 72 to 81):\n- **Turn 72:** `I` - Alice interacts with (4,2) to pick up the onion. She is now holding an onion.\n- **Turn 73:** `D` - Alice changes orientation to down (facing (4,0)) since moving down is invalid (tile is non-empty).\n- **Turn 74:** `I` - Alice interacts with (4,0) to add the onion. Pot now has 1 onion; Alice is empty-handed.\n- **Turn 75:** `L` - Alice moves left to (3,1), changing orientation to left.\n- **Turn 76:** `U` - Alice changes orientation to up (facing (3,2)) since moving up is invalid (tile is non-empty).\n- **Turn 77:** `I` - Alice interacts with (3,2) to pick up an onion. She is now holding an onion.\n- **Turn 78:** `R` - Alice moves right to (4,1), changing orientation to right.\n- **Turn 79:** `D` - Alice changes orientation to down (facing (4,0)) since moving down is invalid.\n- **Turn 80:** `I` - Alice interacts with (4,0) to add the onion. Pot now has 2 onions; Alice is empty-handed.\n- **Turn 81:** `S` - Alice stays to avoid blocking Bob or to prepare for the next action. (Bob is expected to add the third onion here.)\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- By turn 80, the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions from Alice. Bob should add the third onion by turn 83 (after moving to (4,1)), starting the cooking process.\n- Cooking begins at turn 83 (if Bob adds on turn 83) and completes at turn 88.\n- Bob can then fetch a plate from (0,2) and serve the soup at (7,2) around turn 90-95, earning the first reward of 20.\n- Alice can use subsequent turns to gather more onions for another soup, e.g., from (2,0) or dispensers, to maximize rewards.\n\nThis plan leverages Alice's position for quick access to onions and the pot, minimizing movement. With Bob's help, one soup can be delivered within ~20 turns, and additional soups can be started for higher rewards.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 75: \\text{ L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 77: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 78: \\text{ R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 79: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 80: \\text{ I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 81: \\text{ S}\n}",

The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current state:\n\n- Alice (me): at (3,1), facing left (L), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (5,3), facing right (R), holding one onion.\n\nThere are several onions scattered on kitchen counters, but note that the recipe requires 3 onions and yields 20 reward after 5 turns of cooking.\n\nThere are two pots at (3,0) and (4,0). The pot at (4,0) already has 1 onion and 0 tomatoes (so it has one onion, needs two more to start cooking).\n\nSince there are no tomato dispensers, the only recipe we can make is the onion soup (3 onions).\n\nOur plan should be to complete the pot at (4,0) by adding two more onions and then serve the cooked soup.\n\nHowever, note that the pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). Alice is at (3,1). Bob is at (5,3) holding an onion.\n\nLet's look at the grid layout:\n\nImportant coordinates:\n\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4) and (4,4) -> so we can get onions from there if needed.\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (3,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\nKitchen counters with onions are listed, but we might use them if they are convenient, but note that we can also get onions from the dispensers.\n\nThe pot at (4,0) already has one onion. We need two more.\n\nBob is holding an onion and is at (5,3). He can move to deliver that onion to the pot at (4,0). How?\n\nBob's current position: (5,3), facing right. He is holding an onion. He can move to (4,3) then (4,2) then (4,1) then (4,0). But note the grid might have obstacles? We know the tile types, but we don't have a full grid. However, we know the non-empty tiles. Also, note that the kitchen counters are non-empty? Actually, kitchen counters are walkable? The rules say: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" but a kitchen counter is a tile that can be empty or occupied. The rule says non-empty tiles (which I think means tiles that are not of type Empty and also not dispensers? Actually, the rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined by having an object? Actually, the rules are a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut note: the kitchen counters are listed as tile types. The rule says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then other tiles (like dispensers, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter) are non-empty? Or are they walkable? Actually, the rules for movement: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\" and then \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other. Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nBut what is a non-empty tile? The rules don't explicitly say, but from context, I think non-empty means a tile that has an object (like an item on a counter) or a player? But the tile types themselves (like dispenser, pot) are fixed and are not walkable? Actually, the rules for interaction say: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nThis suggests that the fixed objects (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are non-empty tiles and cannot be walked on. Therefore, the grid has:\n\n- Empty tiles: walkable.\n- Non-empty tiles: dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters (and also if they have an item? Actually, no: the tile itself is non-empty because of its type, not because of the item on it. But the rule says \"non-empty tile\" meaning the tile type is not empty? Or the tile has content? The rule for interaction says \"non-empty tile\" meaning a tile that is of type that is not empty (i.e., has an object). So, we cannot walk on any tile that is a dispenser, pot, serving counter, or kitchen counter.\n\nTherefore, the movement is only on empty tiles.\n\nNow, let's try to map the grid:\n\nWe have kitchen counters at:\n(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)\n\nSo, the grid might be 8x5? (x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4) but we don't have all tiles defined.\n\nWe must assume that any tile not in the non-empty list (for fixed objects) is an empty tile? But note: the dispensers and pots are also non-empty. So:\n\n- Onion dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n- Serving counter: (7,2)\n\nSo, all these are non-empty and cannot be walked on.\n\nAlso, the kitchen counters are non-empty and cannot be walked on.\n\nTherefore, the walkable tiles are the ones not in the above lists and not occupied by a player.\n\nNow, let's see the positions:\n\nAlice at (3,1): which is not in any non-empty list? So it's an empty tile.\n\nBob at (5,3): also empty? But (5,3) is a kitchen counter? Wait, the kitchen counters include (5,4) and (5,0) and (5,2) but not (5,3). So (5,3) is empty? Actually, the kitchen counter list: ... (5,2), (0,3), (7,3) ... so (5,3) is not listed, so it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is not listed as any non-empty, so it's empty.\n\nNow, the pot at (4,0) is non-empty, so we cannot step on it. To interact with it, we must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nBob is at (5,3) and wants to go to (4,0). How?\n\nPath for Bob from (5,3) to (4,0):\n\n- From (5,3): can go left to (4,3) [if (4,3) is empty? (4,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters: ... (0,3), (7,3) ... so (4,3) is empty? Yes, so Bob can move to (4,3).\n- Then from (4,3): down to (4,2)? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter (from the list: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)). So (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot walk on. So he cannot go down from (4,3) to (4,2). Therefore, he must go around.\n\nAlternative route for Bob:\n\n- From (5,3): go down to (5,2)? But (5,2) is a kitchen counter -> cannot walk. So he cannot go down.\n- Go up? (5,4) is a kitchen counter -> cannot go up.\n- So only left to (4,3) is possible? Then from (4,3), he can go left to (3,3)? (3,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? The list: ... (0,3), (7,3) ... so (3,3) is empty? Then from (3,3), he can go down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> cannot. So he must go down from (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked, and down from (3,3) to (3,2) is blocked.\n\nWait, what about going to (4,3) then (3,3) then (2,3)? (2,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters: ... (0,3) ... so (2,3) is empty? Then from (2,3) down to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\nThis seems problematic. Let me list the non-walkable tiles (fixed):\n\n- Kitchen Counters: [ (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) ]\n- Onion Dispensers: (3,4), (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (3,0), (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: (7,2)\n\nSo the grid might look like:\n\nRow y=4: [Kitchen(0,4), Kitchen(1,4), Kitchen(2,4), Onion(3,4), Onion(4,4), Kitchen(5,4), Kitchen(6,4), Kitchen(7,4)]\nRow y=3: [Kitchen(0,3), ... what about (1,3)? Not listed -> empty. (2,3)? empty. (3,3)? empty. (4,3)? empty. (5,3)? empty. (6,3)? not listed -> empty. Kitchen(7,3)]\nRow y=2: [Plate(0,2) -> but wait, (0,2) is a plate dispenser? Actually, the plate dispenser is at (0,2). Then (1,2)? not listed -> empty? But wait, the kitchen counters are at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So:\n  (0,2): plate dispenser -> non-empty\n  (1,2): not listed -> empty\n  (2,2): kitchen counter -> non-empty\n  (3,2): kitchen counter -> non-empty\n  (4,2): kitchen counter -> non-empty\n  (5,2): kitchen counter -> non-empty\n  (6,2): not listed -> empty?\n  (7,2): serving counter -> non-empty\n\nRow y=1: [ (0,1): kitchen counter, (1,1): ? not listed -> empty, (2,1): ? not listed -> empty, (3,1): empty (Alice is here), (4,1): ? not listed -> empty, (5,1): ? not listed -> empty, (6,1): ? not listed -> empty, (7,1): kitchen counter ]\n\nRow y=0: [ (0,0): kitchen, (1,0): kitchen, (2,0): kitchen, (3,0): pot, (4,0): pot, (5,0): kitchen, (6,0): kitchen, (7,0): kitchen ]\n\nSo for Bob at (5,3) to get to (4,0):\n\n- He can go left to (4,3) -> empty, so possible.\n- Then from (4,3) he can go down? (4,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- So he must go left again to (3,3) -> empty.\n- Then from (3,3) down? (3,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- Then left to (2,3) -> empty.\n- Then down to (2,2) is blocked (kitchen counter). So he must go to (2,3) and then? He can go down to (2,1)? (2,1) is empty? Then from (2,1) to (3,1) -> but (3,1) has Alice? At the moment, Alice is at (3,1). But they cannot walk through each other.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3) he can go left to (1,3) -> empty, then down to (1,2)? (1,2) is empty? Then from (1,2) to (1,1) -> empty, then to (2,1) -> empty, then to (3,1) -> but occupied by Alice? Then to (4,1) -> empty, then to (4,0) is a pot -> cannot step, but he can interact from (4,1) if facing down? But (4,0) is below (4,1). So he would need to be at (4,1) and facing down.\n\nBut this is a very long path: at least 7 moves (5,3)->(4,3)->(3,3)->(2,3)->(1,3)->(1,2)->(1,1)->(2,1)->(3,1)->(4,1) and then interact. But that's 9 moves? And we are only planning for a few turns? And also, Bob is holding an onion, so he can only do one interaction (to put in the pot) at the end.\n\nBut note: we don't need to plan that long? We are only planning for the next H turns, and H is not specified. But we are to maximize reward, and the pot already has one onion, so if we put two more, it will cook in 5 turns and then we serve.\n\nAlternatively, we might use the onions that are already on the kitchen counters. For example, there is an onion at (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2), (2,0), (2,2), (0,3). But note: (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, and it's at (3,2) which is adjacent to (3,1) (where Alice is) and also adjacent to (3,3) and (2,2) and (4,2). But (3,2) is a kitchen counter, so to pick up the onion, one must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nAlice is at (3,1) and facing left (L). The kitchen counter at (3,2) is above her? So she is at (3,1) and (3,2) is north. If she faces up, she can interact to pick up the onion? But she is holding nothing, so she can pick it up.\n\nSimilarly, Bob might deliver his onion to a nearby kitchen counter and then we can have Alice pick it up and put in the pot? But the pot at (4,0) is near Alice.\n\nLet's consider a plan:\n\nGoal: get two more onions into the pot at (4,0).\n\nOption 1: Alice picks up an onion from a nearby kitchen counter and puts it in the pot. Then Bob brings his onion to the pot (or to a kitchen counter near the pot) and then Alice (or Bob) puts it in.\n\nBut Bob is far. Alternatively, Bob can put his onion on a kitchen counter near him, and then Alice can pick it up? But Alice is at (3,1).\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob drop his onion at a kitchen counter that is closer to the pot, but we need to see which one is accessible.\n\nLooking at the kitchen counters with onions: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2), (2,0), (2,2), (0,3). Some are near the pot:\n\n- (3,2): has an onion and is adjacent to (3,1) (where Alice is) and also (4,2) is adjacent to (4,1) which is near the pot.\n\nBut note: (3,2) is above Alice. She is at (3,1) and facing left. She can turn up to face (3,2) and interact to pick up the onion. Then she can move down to (3,0)? But (3,0) is a pot -> cannot step. So she must go to (4,1) (if she moves right to (4,1)) and then face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). But note: the pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). From (4,1) facing down, she can interact with (4,0). But she is holding an onion, so she can add it to the pot? But the pot is at (4,0) and she is at (4,1) and facing down -> adjacent and facing, so yes.\n\nSo plan for Alice:\n\n1. Turn to face up (U) to be facing (3,2) which is north of her. But note: her current orientation is left (L). To face up, she can change orientation to U without moving? The action \"Change Orientation\" is allowed. So she can do U to face up.\n2. Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (3,2).\n3. Then move right to (4,1) (if (4,1) is empty? It is, as per above).\n4. Then change orientation to down (D) to face the pot at (4,0).\n5. Interact (I) to add the onion to the pot.\n\nAfter step 5, the pot at (4,0) will have 2 onions (since it had one and we added one). Then we need one more.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is at (5,3) holding an onion. He can try to come to the pot? But it's far. Alternatively, he can put his onion on a kitchen counter near him and then we can have Alice pick it up? But that would require Alice to go to that counter, which is far.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to a kitchen counter near the pot? For example, the kitchen counter at (5,0) is near the pot? (5,0) is a kitchen counter and currently it might be empty? The non-empty kitchen counters are listed and they have onions, but (5,0) is not in the list of non-empty kitchen counters that have items? Wait, the list: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" meaning they have an item? The list says:\n\nKitchen Counter on (6,4): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (7,1): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (5,4): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (3,2): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (2,0): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (2,2): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (0,3): contains a onion;\n\nSo (5,0) is a kitchen counter but does not have an item? So it's empty? Bob can put his onion on (5,0). Then Alice can pick it up and put in the pot.\n\nHow Bob can get to (5,0):\n\nBob is at (5,3). (5,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) so he cannot go down. So he must go left to (4,3), then down? (4,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. So same problem as before.\n\nHe can go left to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down? blocked. Then left to (2,3), then down to (2,2) blocked. Then to (1,3), down to (1,2), then to (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (3,1) (but occupied by Alice at the start), then to (4,1), then to (5,1) -> empty? Then from (5,1) he can face down to interact with (5,0)? But (5,0) is a kitchen counter, so he can put the onion on it if it's empty.\n\nBut that's 9 moves for Bob? And we haven't even started cooking.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can put his onion on a kitchen counter that is closer to him. For example, at (5,4) there is already an onion? But we can put multiple items on a kitchen counter? The rules don't say, but typically in Overcooked, a kitchen counter can hold one item. But the list says (5,4) has an onion, so it's occupied. So Bob cannot put his onion on (5,4). Similarly, (6,4) is occupied. (7,3) is a kitchen counter? And it's not listed as having an item? The list of non-empty kitchen counters: ... (7,3) is not in the list? Wait, the list: \"Kitchen Counter on (0,3): contains a onion\" and then (7,3) is a kitchen counter but not listed as having an item? So it might be empty? Or is it not listed because it doesn't have an item? The section is \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\", so if it's not listed, it's empty? So (7,3) is empty? But (7,3) is a kitchen counter and empty, so Bob can put his onion there.\n\nBob is at (5,3) and (7,3) is two steps right? But (6,3) is empty? So he can go right to (6,3) and then right to (7,3). Then face the kitchen counter? The kitchen counter at (7,3): he is at (7,3) and the counter is the same tile? But the rule: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\" \n\nBut note: the kitchen counter is at (7,3) and he is standing on (7,3)? But (7,3) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty tile? So he cannot stand on it. Therefore, to interact with (7,3) (which is a kitchen counter), he must be on an adjacent empty tile and facing it.\n\nThe adjacent tiles to (7,3): \n- (7,4): kitchen counter (non-empty) -> not walkable\n- (7,2): serving counter (non-empty) -> not walkable\n- (6,3): empty\n\nSo he can stand on (6,3) and face right to interact with (7,3). Then he can place the onion on (7,3).\n\nSo Bob's plan:\n\n1. Move right to (6,3) -> one move.\n2. Change orientation to right (if not already) -> but he is facing right? At turn 77, Bob is at (5,3) facing right. So when he moves right to (6,3), he is still facing right? The move action also changes orientation? Actually, the move action says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when he moves right, he will be at (6,3) and facing right. Then he can interact (I) to place the onion on (7,3) (because he is adjacent to (7,3) and facing it).\n\nSo Bob can do: R (to move to (6,3)), then I (to place the onion on (7,3)).\n\nThen the onion is on (7,3). But now we have an onion at (7,3) which is far from the pot.\n\nThen Alice would have to go to (7,3) to pick it up? That is not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can put the onion on a kitchen counter that is closer to the pot. For example, (2,0) has an onion, so it's occupied. (5,0) is a kitchen counter and empty? So Bob can put it on (5,0). But how to get there? It's blocked by the kitchen counters at (5,2) and (5,0) is at y=0.\n\nBob must go via a long path: (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) [but Alice is there at the beginning] -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> then face down to (5,0) and interact to place the onion.\n\nThis is 10 moves? Too long.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps the best is to have Alice use the onion at (3,2) and then have Bob bring his onion to the pot by the long route, but that will take many turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob put his onion on a kitchen counter that is accessible and closer, and then have Alice pick it up on her way to get another onion? But we need two onions.\n\nBut note: there are many onions on counters. Alice can pick up the onion at (3,2) and put it in the pot, then go to another counter to get another onion? For example, the counter at (2,0) has an onion. How to get there from the pot area?\n\nAlice after putting the first onion in the pot at (4,0) (via (4,1)) is at (4,1) holding nothing. Then she can move left to (3,1), then up? (3,2) is above but we took the onion from (3,2) so it's empty now? Or does it have an onion? We picked it up, so it's empty. Then she can go to (2,0)? From (3,1) to (2,1) -> empty, then to (2,0) is a kitchen counter -> cannot step, but she can be at (2,1) and face down to interact with (2,0)? But (2,0) is below (2,1)? So she needs to be at (2,1) and facing down.\n\nBut (2,0) has an onion? Yes, the list says so. So she can pick it up.\n\nThen she can go back to (4,1) and put it in the pot.\n\nSo Alice's plan for two onions:\n\n1. Face up (U) at (3,1) to face (3,2).\n2. Interact (I) to pick up onion from (3,2).\n3. Move right to (4,1).\n4. Face down (D).\n5. Interact (I) to put onion in pot at (4,0). Now the pot has 2 onions.\n6. Move left to (3,1).\n7. Move left to (2,1).\n8. Face down (D) to face (2,0).\n9. Interact (I) to pick up onion from (2,0).\n10. Move right to (3,1).\n11. Move right to (4,1).\n12. Face down (D).\n13. Interact (I) to put the third onion in the pot.\n\nThen the pot will have 3 onions and start cooking.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can be doing something else? For example, getting a plate for when the soup is ready.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). Bob is at (5,3) initially, and after placing his onion somewhere, he can go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nBut let's see the timeline.\n\nAt turn 77:\n\nAlice is at (3,1), facing left, holding nothing.\n\nBob is at (5,3), facing right, holding an onion.\n\nWe are to plan actions for Alice for the next several turns. We can also suggest actions for Bob, but the task is to plan for Alice and optionally for Bob. But the answer format is only for Alice? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only shows actions for Alice? The example output only has \"Turn t: action\", without specifying the player. But the task is for Alice. So we only output Alice's actions.\n\nBut then how to coordinate? We must assume that Bob will act independently. However, the problem says \"collaborate\", so we might need to assume Bob's actions or hope that Bob is controlled by a good agent.\n\nBut in this case, we are only to output Alice's actions. So we focus on Alice.\n\nAlice can complete the pot by herself by getting two onions from the counters: one at (3,2) and one at (2,0) or (2,2) or (0,3) etc. The closest are (3,2) and then (2,0) or (2,2). (2,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, and it is at (2,2). Alice can pick it up from (2,1) by facing down? Or from (2,3) by facing down? Or from (1,2) by facing right? Or from (3,2) by facing left? But (3,2) is adjacent to (2,2)? No, they are not adjacent? (3,2) and (2,2) are adjacent horizontally? Yes, (2,2) and (3,2) are adjacent? Actually, (2,2) and (3,2) are next to each other at y=2, x=2 and x=3. But to interact with (2,2), Alice must be at an adjacent empty tile and facing it.\n\nFrom (3,1), after she has put the first onion, she is at (4,1) then moves to (3,1) and then to (2,1). At (2,1), she can face up to interact with (2,2)? (2,2) is north of (2,1). So yes.\n\nThe onion at (2,2) is available.\n\nSo revised plan for Alice:\n\n1. U (change orientation to up) to face (3,2) from (3,1).\n2. I (interact to pick up onion from (3,2)).\n3. R (move right to (4,1)).\n4. D (change orientation to down to face (4,0)).\n5. I (interact to add onion to pot; now pot has 2 onions).\n6. L (move left to (3,1)).\n7. L (move left to (2,1)).\n8. U (change orientation to up to face (2,2)).\n9. I (interact to pick up onion from (2,2); now she is holding an onion).\n10. R (move right to (3,1)).\n11. R (move right to (4,1)).\n12. D (change orientation to down).\n13. I (interact to add onion to pot; now pot has 3 onions and starts cooking).\n\nAfter step 13, the pot starts cooking. It will cook for 5 turns, so at turn 77+13 = turn 90, the soup is ready? But note: the cooking starts at the moment the third onion is added. So at the turn when the third onion is added, the cooking starts, and then it takes 5 turns. So at turn 77 + 13 = turn 90, the pot has just been filled and starts cooking. Then it will be ready at turn 90 + 5 = turn 95.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice can then go to get a plate to serve the soup.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). Alice is at (4,1) after step 13.\n\nShe can go to (0,2) to get a plate, but it's far. Alternatively, Bob can get the plate.\n\nBut since we are only planning for Alice, we can plan for her to get the plate after the soup is cooking.\n\nBut the soup won't be ready until turn 95, so we have time.\n\nAfter step 13, Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can go to the plate dispenser:\n\nFrom (4,1): \n- Move left to (3,1)\n- Move left to (2,1)\n- Move left to (1,1) [empty]\n- Move left to (0,1) -> but (0,1) is a kitchen counter -> cannot step. So she must go up from (1,1) to (1,2) [empty], then left to (0,2) is a plate dispenser -> cannot step. So to interact with (0,2), she must be adjacent and facing it. Adjacent tiles: (0,1) is kitchen counter (non-empty) -> not walkable, (0,3) is kitchen counter with onion -> not walkable, (1,2) is empty. So she can be at (1,2) and face left to interact with (0,2).\n\nSo:\n\n14. L (from (4,1) to (3,1))\n15. L (to (2,1))\n16. L (to (1,1))\n17. U (to (1,2))\n18. L (change orientation to left to face (0,2))? But when she moves, she changes orientation. When she moves up from (1,1) to (1,2), she will be facing up. Then she needs to change to left.\n\n19. I (to get a plate)\n\nThen she must go back to the pot to serve the soup.\n\nBut the soup won't be ready until turn 95, so she can wait or do other things.\n\nBut we are only planning for the next several turns. The problem doesn't specify H, but we should focus on the immediate steps to fill the pot.\n\nSince the cooking time is 5 turns, and we are at turn 77, if we can fill the pot by turn 77 + 13 = 90, then it will be ready at 95.\n\nBut Bob might be able to help by getting the plate.\n\nBut for now, we focus on Alice's actions to fill the pot.\n\nWe have 13 actions for Alice.\n\nHowever, note that Bob is holding an onion. We don't want him to waste it. He could put it in the pot if he can get there, but it's hard. Alternatively, he might put it on a kitchen counter that we can use later, but for the current plan, we are not using it.\n\nBut if Alice can fill the pot with two more onions from counters, then Bob's onion is extra. He can put it in the other pot at (3,0) to start another soup? But that would require two more onions.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on finishing the current pot.\n\nSo the plan for Alice for the next 13 turns:\n\nTurn 77: U (change orientation to up to face (3,2))\nTurn 78: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\nTurn 79: R (move right to (4,1))\nTurn 80: D (change orientation to down to face (4,0))\nTurn 81: I (put onion in pot; now pot has 2 onions)\nTurn 82: L (move left to (3,1))\nTurn 83: L (move left to (2,1))\nTurn 84: U (change orientation to up to face (2,2))\nTurn 85: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\nTurn 86: R (move right to (3,1))\nTurn 87: R (move right to (4,1))\nTurn 88: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 89: I (put onion in pot; now pot has 3 onions, cooking starts)\n\nThen the soup will be ready at turn 89 + 5 = 94.\n\nAfter that, Alice can go get a plate.\n\nBut we are only asked to plan for the next several turns. 13 turns is a lot, but it's a plan.\n\nWe must consider if there are shorter paths. For example, after putting the first onion, instead of going to (2,2), she could go to (2,0) which is closer? (2,0) is at (2,0), and she is at (3,1) after step 6 (turn 82: at (3,1)).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (2,1) (turn 83), then at (2,1) she can face down to (2,0) which is below. So:\n\nTurn 84: D (face down to (2,0))\nTurn 85: I (pick up onion from (2,0))\nThen same as before: turn 86: R to (3,1), turn 87: R to (4,1), turn 88: D, turn 89: I.\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nBut (2,0) is a kitchen counter with an onion, so it's available.\n\nEither (2,2) or (2,0) is fine.\n\nBut (2,2) is one step up from (2,1), and (2,0) is one step down? But she has to change orientation. Same.\n\nWe choose (2,0) because it's in the same column.\n\nSo revised:\n\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: I (pick onion from (3,2))\nTurn 79: R (to (4,1))\nTurn 80: D (face down)\nTurn 81: I (add to pot; now 2 onions)\nTurn 82: L (to (3,1))\nTurn 83: L (to (2,1))\nTurn 84: D (face down to (2,0))\nTurn 85: I (pick up onion from (2,0))\nTurn 86: R (to (3,1))\nTurn 87: R (to (4,1))\nTurn 88: D (face down)\nTurn 89: I (add to pot; now 3 onions, cooking starts)\n\nNow, what about Bob? He is holding an onion. We hope that he will put it somewhere useful, but we cannot control him. Perhaps he can put it in the other pot at (3,0). But (3,0) is near Alice. He can try to come to (3,0) via the long route, but it's inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, he can put it on a kitchen counter near him, like (7,3) or (5,0) if he can, but as discussed, it's hard.\n\nBut since we are only outputting Alice's actions, we do the above.\n\nBut note: when Alice is moving, she must not collide with Bob. At turn 77, Bob is at (5,3). He will move independently. We don't know what he will do, so we assume he will act reasonably.\n\nTo be safe, we might choose a path that avoids him.\n\nBut at the beginning, Alice is at (3,1) and Bob at (5,3), so they are not close. In the above plan, Alice moves in the left part of the map, so probably no collision.\n\nSo we output the 12 actions for Alice from turn 77 to turn 88? But the plan above has 13 actions (turns 77 to 89). Let's list:\n\n- Turn 77: U\n- Turn 78: I\n- Turn 79: R\n- Turn 80: D\n- Turn 81: I\n- Turn 82: L\n- Turn 83: L\n- Turn 84: D\n- Turn 85: I\n- Turn 86: R\n- Turn 87: R\n- Turn 88: D\n- Turn 89: I\n\nThat's 13 actions, taking us to turn 89.\n\nWe could stop at turn 89, as the pot is filled and cooking.\n\nBut the problem says \"over next several turns\", so 13 turns might be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan fewer turns, but then the soup won't be filled.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize reward, and filling the pot is essential.\n\nWe must also note that there is another pot at (3,0) that is empty. But we focus on the one that already has one onion.\n\nTherefore, we output the above sequence.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: I\nTurn 79: R\nTurn 80: D\nTurn 81: I\nTurn 82: L\nTurn 83: L\nTurn 84: D\nTurn 85: I\nTurn 86: R\nTurn 87: R\nTurn 88: D\nTurn 89: I\n}\n\nBut note: at turn 77, Alice is at (3,1), facing left. Action U: change orientation to up. Then she faces up, so she can interact with (3,2) which is above.\n\nThen I: interact, so she picks up the onion from (3,2).\n\nThen R: move right to (4,1), and now facing right? But then she needs to face down to interact with the pot. So at turn 80, we have D: change orientation to down.\n\nSimilarly, after putting the first onion, she moves left twice to (2,1), then changes orientation to down to face (2,0), then interacts to pick up.\n\nThen moves right twice to (4,1), changes to down, and interacts.\n\nThis should work.\n\nWe assume that the kitchen counter at (3,2) and (2,0) still have onions (they are listed in the state, and we are the first to take them).\n\nAlso, no one else takes them because Bob is far and we control Alice.\n\nSo this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice will focus on completing the onion soup in the pot at (4,0), which already contains 1 onion. She will retrieve two additional onions from nearby kitchen counters and add them to the pot. This will start the cooking process, and the soup will be ready in 5 turns after the third onion is added. The plan leverages Alice's current position and the available onions on kitchen counters at (3,2) and (2,0) for efficiency.\n\n### Plan for Alice (Turns 77 to 89):\n- **Turn 77 (U)**: Change orientation to up to face the kitchen counter at (3,2).\n- **Turn 78 (I)**: Interact to pick up the onion from (3,2).\n- **Turn 79 (R)**: Move right to (4,1).\n- **Turn 80 (D)**: Change orientation to down to face the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 81 (I)**: Interact to add the onion to the pot (pot now has 2 onions).\n- **Turn 82 (L)**: Move left to (3,1).\n- **Turn 83 (L)**: Move left to (2,1).\n- **Turn 84 (D)**: Change orientation to down to face the kitchen counter at (2,0).\n- **Turn 85 (I)**: Interact to pick up the onion from (2,0).\n- **Turn 86 (R)**: Move right to (3,1).\n- **Turn 87 (R)**: Move right to (4,1).\n- **Turn 88 (D)**: Change orientation to down to face the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 89 (I)**: Interact to add the onion to the pot (pot now has 3 onions; cooking starts and will finish in 5 turns).\n\n### Coordination Notes:\n- **Bob's Role**: Bob is holding an onion at (5,3). He should ideally place it on an accessible kitchen counter (e.g., empty ones like (5,0) or (7,3)) or use it for the other pot at (3,0) to start a new soup, but this is not part of Alice's direct plan. Alice's actions avoid Bob's initial position, minimizing collision risk.\n- **Post-Cooking**: After turn 89, Alice can fetch a plate from (0,2) while the soup cooks (ready at turn 94). Bob can assist by getting a plate earlier to serve the soup promptly at turn 94.\n- **Efficiency**: This sequence completes the soup in 13 turns, leveraging nearby resources. The total reward of 20 will be obtained upon delivery.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: I\nTurn 79: R\nTurn 80: D\nTurn 81: I\nTurn 82: L\nTurn 83: L\nTurn 84: D\nTurn 85: I\nTurn 86: R\nTurn 87: R\nTurn 88: D\nTurn 89: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes. The only recipe given is Recipe 1, which requires 3 onions, cooks in 5 turns, and gives a reward of 20. There are no tomato dispensers, so only onion soup is possible.\n\nThe game state at turn 80:\n\n- Alice is at (3,1), facing up (U), holding nothing.\n\n- Bob is at (4,3), facing left (L), holding nothing.\n\nThere are onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), and a plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The pot at (4,0) already has 1 onion, so it needs 2 more onions to start cooking.\n\nThere are many kitchen counters with onions already placed: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (3,2), (2,0), (2,2), (0,3), (5,2) all have onions. But since players can only carry one item at a time, and we need to add onions to the pot, we might use these existing onions instead of going to dispensers.\n\nThe serving counter is at (7,2).\n\nAlice's action history: L, I, D, I, U. Since it's the most recent actions, the last action was U, so she moved up to (3,1), I think. Let's see her position: she's at (3,1), and orientation U. Actions: L, I, D, I, U. Probably, she was moving around.\n\nSimilarly, Bob: R, R, D, I, L. He's at (4,3), facing L.\n\nNow, I need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice over the next H turns. H isn't specified, so I should choose a reasonable horizon. Since cooking takes 5 turns, and we need to add ingredients, get plates, and serve, H should be at least 10-15 turns to complete a soup delivery.\n\nBut I need to coordinate with Bob. The task says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I can suggest actions for both to optimize teamwork.\n\nFirst, goal: get the pot at (4,0) to have 3 onions so it starts cooking. Then after 5 turns, serve it.\n\nThe pot has 1 onion already, so we need 2 more onions.\n\nThere are onions on kitchen counters that we can use, so we don't necessarily need to go to dispensers.\n\nList of onion locations:\n\n- (6,4): onion\n\n- (7,1): onion\n\n- (5,4): onion\n\n- (3,2): onion\n\n- (2,0): onion\n\n- (2,2): onion\n\n- (0,3): onion\n\n- (5,2): onion\n\nAlice is at (3,1), which is near (3,2) that has an onion. (3,2) is directly south of (3,1)? Coordinates: (3,1) to (3,2) is down? Let's clarify the grid.\n\nAssuming (0,0) is bottom-left, increasing x right, y up? But in the tile list, (0,0) is kitchen counter, (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), etc. Typically in such grids, (0,0) might be bottom-left, but in Overcooked, it might be top-left. I need to be careful.\n\nLooking at positions:\n\n- Alice at (3,1)\n\n- Bob at (4,3)\n\n- Onion at (3,2): (3,2) is one step down from (3,1) if y increases up? But let's see the actions.\n\nAction move: L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y), U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1). So U increases y, D decreases y. So if (0,0) is bottom-left, then y increases up, so (3,1) to (3,2) is up, but U is (x,y+1), so moving U from (3,1) goes to (3,2). Similarly, D to (3,0).\n\nIn coordinates, (x,y), U: (x,y+1), so higher y is up.\n\nFrom (3,1), moving U to (3,2), D to (3,0), L to (2,1), R to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is directly above (3,1) if we think y increasing up.\n\n(3,2) has an onion on kitchen counter.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), facing U, so she is facing towards (3,2). But (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion.\n\nTo interact with a tile, player must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), and (3,2) is adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,1) and (3,2) are adjacent vertically.\n\nSince she is facing U, which is towards (3,2), she can interact with it.\n\nBut what can she do? Interact with kitchen counter: if she is empty-handed and counter has item, she can pick it up.\n\nAlice is holding nothing, and (3,2) has an onion, so she can pick it up by interacting.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (4,3), facing L, which is west, towards (3,3)? (4,3) facing L, so adjacent tile to left is (3,3). But (3,3) is not listed; let's see what tiles are there.\n\nKitchen counters are at specific points, but there might be empty tiles. (3,3) is not in the kitchen counter list, so it might be an empty tile or something else.\n\nTile types: we have the list, but not all positions are specified. Only non-empty tiles are listed, I think.\n\nThe environment details give tile types for specific coordinates.\n\nFor example, kitchen counters at various points, but (3,3) is not listed, so it might be an empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, dispensers, pots, serving counter are given.\n\nSo (3,3) is not mentioned, so it's likely an empty tile.\n\nBob at (4,3) facing L, so he is facing (3,3), which is an empty tile, so he can't interact with anything there since it's empty.\n\nHe could change orientation or move.\n\nNow, back to Alice: at (3,1), facing U, adjacent to (3,2) which has an onion on kitchen counter. She can interact to pick up the onion.\n\nThen, she would be holding an onion.\n\nThe pot at (4,0) needs two more onions. (4,0) is a pot.\n\nFrom (3,1), to go to (4,0), she needs to move down and right? (3,1) to (4,0): x from 3 to 4 (right), y from 1 to 0 (down). So she can go D to (3,0), then R to (4,0).\n\n(3,0) is a kitchen counter? List: kitchen counters include (3,0)? No, (3,0) is not listed. Kitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), etc. (3,0) and (4,0) are pots, so not kitchen counters.\n\nPots are at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nSo (3,0) is a pot, (4,0) is a pot.\n\nAlice at (3,1). To reach (4,0), she can go D to (3,0), but (3,0) is a pot, which is not empty, so she can't walk onto it. Players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles, only empty tiles.\n\nSo she can only stand on empty tiles adjacent to interact.\n\nTo interact with pot at (4,0), she needs to be on an adjacent empty tile and facing it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (4,0): (4,1) north, (3,0) west, (5,0) east, (4,-1) south but probably out of bound, so (4,1), (3,0), (5,0).\n\n(3,0) is a pot, so not walkable. (5,0) is a kitchen counter? Kitchen counters include (5,0)? Yes, (5,0) is listed as kitchen counter, so not walkable. (4,1) might be empty.\n\n(4,1) is not listed in any tile type, so it should be an empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (5,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable; (3,0) pot, not walkable.\n\nSo for pot at (4,0), the only adjacent empty tile might be (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, for (3,0), adjacent empty tiles could be (3,1), (2,0), (4,0) but (4,0) is pot, so not, (2,0) is kitchen counter, (3,1) is empty I think.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), which is empty, and she can face down to interact with (3,0) pot.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,0), from (4,1), face down.\n\nNow, Alice is at (3,1). She can interact with (3,2) kitchen counter to pick up onion by facing U and interacting.\n\n(3,2) is above her, she is facing U, so yes.\n\nAfter picking up onion, she is holding an onion.\n\nThen, she can move to add it to a pot.\n\nThe pot at (4,0) has 1 onion, so adding there makes sense.\n\nTo add to (4,0), she needs to be at (4,1) or other adjacent empty tile. But (4,1) is the only accessible one.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can go R to (4,1), which should be empty, then face D to interact with pot at (4,0).\n\nAt (4,1), facing down, she can interact to add ingredient if holding one.\n\nSimilarly, for the other pot.\n\nBut let's focus on (4,0) since it already has one onion.\n\nBob is at (4,3), holding nothing.\n\nHe can go to get another onion or use an existing one.\n\nThere is an onion at (5,4), which is near him? (4,3) to (5,4): not adjacent. (4,3) to (4,4) is up, but (4,4) is onion dispenser? Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is onion dispenser.\n\nBob at (4,3), facing L (west). He can change orientation or move.\n\nTo get an onion, he can go U to (4,4), but (4,4) is dispenser, not walkable, so he can't stand on it. He needs to be adjacent.\n\nAdjacent to (4,4): (4,3) south, (4,5) north? Probably out, (3,4) west, (5,4) east.\n\n(4,3) is where he is, empty tile? (4,3) is Bob's position, likely empty.\n\n(3,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable.\n\n(5,4) is kitchen counter with onion? Kitchen counter at (5,4) has onion, but kitchen counter is not walkable.\n\nSo for dispenser at (4,4), adjacent tiles: (4,3) south, (3,4) west, etc.\n\nBob is at (4,3), which is south of (4,4). He is facing L, but to interact with dispenser, he needs to face it. Since (4,4) is north, he needs to face U.\n\nHe can change orientation to U, then interact to grab an onion if empty-handed.\n\nSimilarly for other dispensers.\n\nBut there are onions on counters, so he might pick one up faster.\n\nFor example, (5,4) has an onion on kitchen counter, but (5,4) is the counter itself, not adjacent. He needs to be adjacent to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) kitchen counter, adjacent tiles: (5,3) south, (5,5) north, (4,4) west, (6,4) east.\n\n(4,4) is dispenser, not empty; (6,4) is kitchen counter with onion? Kitchen counter at (6,4) has onion, so not walkable.\n\n(5,3) might be empty; (5,5) probably out.\n\nBob at (4,3), he can go R to (5,3), which should be empty, then face U to interact with (5,4) kitchen counter to pick up onion.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), so from (5,3), facing north (U), he can interact with (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, other counters.\n\nBut let's plan for Alice first.\n\nAlice at (3,1), facing U.\n\nAction for Alice at turn 80: she can interact (I) to pick up onion from (3,2) kitchen counter.\n\nThen she will be holding an onion.\n\nThen, she needs to go to pot at (4,0) to add it.\n\nFrom (3,1), after interacting, she is still at (3,1). Then she can move R to (4,1), which is empty, then face D (down) to interact with pot at (4,0).\n\nAdding the onion.\n\nPot at (4,0) had 1 onion, after adding, it has 2 onions. Still not full, cooking not started.\n\nThen we need one more onion.\n\nBob can get another onion and add it.\n\nBob is at (4,3), facing L.\n\nHe can go to a nearby onion source.\n\nFor example, onion at (5,4) on kitchen counter.\n\nHe can move R to (5,3) — assuming (5,3) is empty, then face U to interact and pick up onion from (5,4).\n\nThen he can go to pot to add it.\n\nFrom (5,3), he can go L to (4,3), but (4,3) he just left, or directly? To go to (4,0), he needs to go down.\n\nFrom (5,3), he can go D to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable. So he must go around.\n\n(5,2) has onion, so not walkable. Adjacent empty tiles: (5,3) is where he might be, or (4,2), (6,2), etc.\n\n(4,2) is not listed, might be empty.\n\n(5,3) to (4,3) is left, (4,3) is empty, then from (4,3) to (4,2)? (4,2) might be empty, then to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) is not specified, so likely empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is empty.\n\nSo Bob: from (4,3), move R to (5,3) [if empty], then face U, interact to pick up onion from (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,3), move L to (4,3), then D to (4,2) [empty], then D to (4,1) [empty], then face D to interact with pot at (4,0) to add onion.\n\nAfter adding the third onion, the pot starts cooking automatically. Cooking time is 5 turns for this recipe.\n\nThen after 5 turns, someone needs to get a plate, serve the soup, and deliver to serving counter.\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nSo while the soup is cooking, one player can get a plate.\n\nNow, at turn 80, Alice can start by interacting to pick up onion.\n\nThen move to add it.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nBut let's sequence the actions.\n\nFirst, for Alice at turn 80:\n\nPosition: (3,1), facing U, holding nothing.\n\nShe can interact (I) to pick up onion from (3,2).\n\nAction: I\n\nAfter that, she is at (3,1), holding onion.\n\nThen turn 81: she can move R to (4,1).\n\nNow at (4,1), holding onion.\n\nThen she needs to face down to interact with pot.\n\nSo turn 82: change orientation to D? Or directly interact if she moves and faces, but each action is separate.\n\nAction: she can move to (4,1), then next turn face down, then interact.\n\nSince moving changes position and orientation? No.\n\nPlayer actions: Move (L/R/U/D) changes position and orientation to that direction.\n\nChange Orientation (L/R/U/D) changes only orientation if not moving.\n\nInteract (I) for interaction.\n\nSo if she moves R to (4,1), that changes her position to (4,1) and orientation to R (right).\n\nBut to interact with pot at (4,0), which is south, she needs to face down.\n\nSo after moving to (4,1) facing right, she needs to change orientation to D.\n\nThen interact.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 80: I (interact with (3,2) to pick up onion)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nTurn 81: move R to (4,1) - position (4,1), orientation R\n\nTurn 82: change orientation to D (since she needs to face down to interact with (4,0))\n\nTurn 83: I to add onion to pot\n\nAfter adding, pot at (4,0) has 2 onions. Still needs one more.\n\nNow Alice is at (4,1), holding nothing after adding.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob.\n\nBob at (4,3), facing L, holding nothing.\n\nHe can go to pick up an onion to add to the pot.\n\nNearest onion: perhaps from (5,4) kitchen counter.\n\nTurn 80 for Bob: he needs to act simultaneously.\n\nI need to specify actions for each turn for Alice, and optionally for Bob.\n\nThe task is to plan for Alice, but to coordinate, I should suggest Bob's actions too.\n\nAnswer format is only for Alice, I think. \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\", and the boxed answer is for Alice only.\n\nBut it says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I can include Bob if needed.\n\nTo be precise, the output should be Alice's actions, but since coordination is key, I might describe Bob's role.\n\nBut the answer format only shows turns with Alice's actions.\n\nPerhaps I should plan assuming Bob will cooperate, and sequence Alice's actions accordingly.\n\nI can plan Alice's actions to complement what Bob might do.\n\nFirst, at turn 80, Alice should interact to pick up the onion at (3,2).\n\nThen for Bob, at turn 80, he could start moving towards an onion source.\n\nFor example, Bob at (4,3) facing L. He can move to (5,3) to access (5,4).\n\nAction: move R to (5,3), which changes position to (5,3) and orientation to R.\n\nThen at (5,3), he can face U to interact with (5,4).\n\nBut let's not sequence Bob for now.\n\nBack to Alice.\n\nAfter Alice adds the onion at turn 83, pot has 2 onions.\n\nNow we need one more onion.\n\nAlice is at (4,1), holding nothing.\n\nShe could get another onion, but Bob might be closer to some.\n\nThere is an onion at (5,2) kitchen counter, for example.\n\n(5,2) is kitchen counter with onion.\n\nAlice at (4,1), she can go to (5,1)? (5,1) not specified, might be empty.\n\nThen to (5,2), but (5,2) is counter, not walkable, so she needs to be adjacent.\n\nAdjacent to (5,2): (5,1) south, (5,3) north, (4,2) west, (6,2) east.\n\n(5,1) might be empty, (5,3) might be empty, etc.\n\nFrom (4,1), Alice can move R to (5,1) if empty, then face U to interact with (5,2) to pick up onion.\n\nBut (5,2) has an onion, so she can pick it up.\n\nThen she can add to pot.\n\nBut the pot is at (4,0), from (5,1), she can move L to (4,1), then face D, interact with (4,0).\n\nBut Bob might be able to do it faster.\n\nLet's see Bob's position.\n\nAt turn 80, if Bob moves R to (5,3), then at turn 81, he can change orientation to U and interact to pick up onion from (5,4).\n\nThen he is holding onion.\n\nThen he can go to pot.\n\nFrom (5,3), holding onion, move L to (4,3), then D to (4,2), then D to (4,1), then face D and interact with (4,0) to add onion.\n\nThat would take several turns.\n\nTimeline:\n\nTurn 80:\n\nAlice: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n\nBob: move R to (5,3) (now at (5,3), facing R)\n\nTurn 81:\n\nAlice: move R to (4,1) (now at (4,1), facing R)\n\nBob: change orientation to U (to face (5,4)), then since he is at (5,3), facing U, he can interact? Interact requires facing the tile, which he is now facing U, so (5,4) is north, yes.\n\nSo Bob: I (pick up onion from (5,4))\n\nNow Bob holding onion.\n\nTurn 82:\n\nAlice: change orientation to D (to face down for pot)\n\nBob: move L to (4,3) (now at (4,3), facing L? Move L changes orientation to L, so facing left)\n\nBut he needs to go down to (4,2).\n\nTurn 83:\n\nAlice: I (add onion to pot at (4,0)) → now pot has 2 onions\n\nBob: from (4,3), move D to (4,2) (now at (4,2), facing D)\n\n(4,2) should be empty.\n\nTurn 84:\n\nAlice: now free, holding nothing.\n\nBob: move D to (4,1) (now at (4,1), facing D)\n\nTurn 85:\n\nBob: I (interact with pot at (4,0) to add onion) → now pot has 3 onions, cooking starts. Cooking time 5 turns, so at turn 85, cooking starts, will finish at turn 90 (since turn 85 + 5 = 90? Turns: if cooking starts at turn t, it finishes at t+5, so can serve at t+6.\n\nAt turn 85, Bob adds the onion, so cooking starts at turn 85.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so after 5 turns, at turn 90, it is cooked.\n\nThen someone can serve it with a plate.\n\nNow, from turn 84, Alice is free at (4,1), holding nothing.\n\nShe can go to get a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (0,2): need to go left and up.\n\nPath: (4,1) to (3,1) L, (2,1)? (2,1) not specified, empty, then (1,1)?, but (0,1) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nServing counter at (7,2), plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\n(0,2) is plate dispenser.\n\nTo access dispenser, need to be adjacent.\n\nAdjacent to (0,2): (0,1) south, (0,3) north, but (0,1) is kitchen counter, (0,3) is kitchen counter with onion? (0,3) has onion, but both not walkable.\n\n(1,2) east? (1,2) not listed, might be empty.\n\nSo probably (1,2) is adjacent to (0,2).\n\nSimilarly, (0,2) west might be out.\n\nSo from (4,1), Alice can go left to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), but (1,1) might be empty, then to (1,2)? (1,2) to access (0,2).\n\n(1,2) east of (0,2)? (0,2) to (1,2) is east, so (1,2) is adjacent east.\n\nAlice at (4,1), move L to (3,1), then L to (2,1)? (2,1) not specified, empty, then L to (1,1)? (1,1) not specified, empty, then U to (1,2)? (1,2) should be empty.\n\nThen at (1,2), she can face W (left) to interact with (0,2) dispenser to grab a plate.\n\nThen she is holding a clean plate.\n\nSimilarly, Bob might be free after adding onion.\n\nBut let's continue.\n\nAfter cooking is done, she can serve the soup.\n\nServing requires holding a plate and interacting with the pot to serve the soup onto the plate, then deliver to serving counter.\n\nFirst, to serve: when soup is cooked, a player with clean plate can interact with the pot to serve, which gives a soup in plate.\n\nThen take it to serving counter at (7,2) and interact to deliver.\n\nNow, Alice can get the plate while soup is cooking.\n\nCooking starts at turn 85, ends at turn 90.\n\nSo from turn 84, Alice is at (4,1).\n\nTurn 84: Alice move L to (3,1) (now at (3,1), facing L? Move L changes orientation to L)\n\nTurn 85: Alice move L to (2,1) (assuming (2,1) empty, now at (2,1), facing L)\n\nTurn 86: Alice move L to (1,1) (assuming (1,1) empty, now at (1,1), facing L)\n\nTurn 87: Alice move U to (1,2) (now at (1,2), facing U)\n\nAt (1,2), she needs to face W (left) to interact with (0,2).\n\nSince she moved U, she is facing U, so need to change orientation.\n\nTurn 88: change orientation to L (to face west, towards (0,2))\n\nTurn 89: I (interact to grab plate from dispenser)\n\nNow holding clean plate.\n\nSoup finishes at turn 90, so at turn 90, she can go back to serve.\n\nBut she is at (1,2), pot at (4,0).\n\nNeed to go to (4,1) to serve.\n\nPath: from (1,2) to (1,1) D, then to (2,1) R, (3,1) R, (4,1) R.\n\nThen at (4,1), face D to interact with pot.\n\nBut soup is ready at turn 90.\n\nTurn 90: she can start moving.\n\nBut at turn 89 she is at (1,2) after grabbing plate.\n\nTurn 90: move D to (1,1) (facing D)\n\nTurn 91: move R to (2,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 92: move R to (3,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 93: move R to (4,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 94: change orientation to D (to face down)\n\nTurn 95: I to serve soup from pot to plate. Now she has soup in plate.\n\nThen deliver to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (7,2): need to go right and up.\n\n(4,1) to (5,1) R, but (5,1) might be empty, then to (6,1)? (6,1) not specified, then to (7,1)? (7,1) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\nServing counter at (7,2).\n\nAdjacent tiles: (7,1) south, (7,3) north, (6,2) west, etc.\n\n(7,1) is kitchen counter, not walkable; (7,3) is kitchen counter with onion? (7,3) has onion, not walkable; (6,2) might be empty.\n\n(6,2) not listed, so empty tile probably.\n\nFrom (4,1), Alice can go to (5,1), then (6,1), but (6,1) to (7,2) not adjacent directly.\n\n(4,1) to (5,1) R, (5,1) to (5,2)? (5,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable. So need to go up or down.\n\nPerhaps (4,1) to (4,2) U, but (4,2) might be empty.\n\nThen (4,2) to (5,2) R, but (5,2) counter, not walkable.\n\nBetter: from (4,1), move U to (4,2) if empty.\n\nThen from (4,2), move R to (5,2)? No, (5,2) not walkable.\n\n(4,2) to (3,2) L, but (3,2) has onion, kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo the only way is to go to (5,1) or (4,2) but then to (5,3) or something.\n\nPath to (7,2): need to reach (6,2) or (7,3), but (7,3) not walkable.\n\nAdjacent to serving counter (7,2) is (6,2) west and (7,1) south, but (7,1) counter not walkable, so only (6,2) can be used to interact.\n\nSo Alice needs to be at (6,2), facing east to interact with (7,2).\n\n(6,2) is not listed, so should be empty.\n\nNow, from (4,1) to (6,2): one way is (4,1) to (5,1) R, (5,1) to (6,1) R, (6,1) to (6,2) U? (6,2) is north of (6,1)? Assuming y up.\n\n(6,1) to (6,2) U.\n\nThen at (6,2), face E to interact with serving counter.\n\n(6,1) might be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) empty.\n\nAfter serving soup at turn 95, Alice at (4,1), holding soup on plate.\n\nTurn 95: after I, she is at (4,1), holding soup.\n\nTurn 96: move R to (5,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 97: move R to (6,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 98: move U to (6,2) (facing U)\n\nNow at (6,2), need to face E to interact with (7,2) serving counter.\n\nTurn 99: change orientation to R (east)\n\nTurn 100: I to deliver soup, get reward.\n\nThis is taking many turns, and we might optimize.\n\nBob can help with getting plate or serving.\n\nFor example, while soup is cooking, Bob can get the plate.\n\nAt turn 85, after adding onion, Bob is at (4,1), holding nothing.\n\nHe can go to get plate.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,1) to (0,2), as before.\n\nBut Bob might be closer to something.\n\nAlso, there are other onions, but for now, one soup.\n\nSince cooking takes 5 turns, we can start another soup or something, but let's complete one first.\n\nFirst, to add the third onion faster.\n\nIn the earlier sequence, Bob adds at turn 85.\n\nBut Alice could add the second onion earlier.\n\nAlice adds at turn 83.\n\nThen from turn 84, she can get the third onion.\n\nFor example, at turn 84, Alice at (4,1), can go to (5,1) or to (3,2) but (3,2) has onion, but she can pick it up if it's still there, but she just picked it at turn 80, and it's gone, but there are other onions.\n\n(3,2) onion was picked by Alice at turn 80, so it's no longer there.\n\nOther onions available.\n\nNearest might be (5,2) at (5,2).\n\nAlice at (4,1), move R to (5,1) at turn 84.\n\nThen turn 85: change orientation to U (if not facing), at (5,1), after move R, she is facing R, so need to face U.\n\nTurn 85: change orientation to U\n\nTurn 86: I to pick up onion from (5,2) kitchen counter.\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen turn 87: move L to (4,1) (facing L)\n\nTurn 88: change orientation to D (if not, move to (4,1) facing L, need down)\n\nTurn 89: I to add onion to pot.\n\nBut at turn 89, she adds, so cooking starts at turn 89, earlier than before.\n\nThen finishes at turn 94.\n\nIn previous with Bob, cooking started at 85, finish 90.\n\nHere at 89, finish 94, later? 89+5=94, vs 85+5=90, so later if Alice does alone.\n\nBut with Bob, it was faster.\n\nAt turn 83, Alice added second onion, Bob can add third earlier.\n\nIn Bob sequence, he added at turn 85.\n\nFrom turn 80:\n\nTurn 80:\nAlice: I (pick onion from (3,2))\nBob: move R to (5,3)  // to access (5,4)\n\nTurn 81:\nAlice: move R to (4,1)  // to (4,1) facing R\nBob: I (pick onion from (5,4)) // at (5,3) facing U? At turn 80, Bob moved R to (5,3) facing R, so at turn 81, he can change orientation to U then I, or directly I if he changes orientation, but each action separate.\n\nTypically, he needs to face the tile.\n\nAt turn 81, Bob can change orientation to U (face north), then interact.\n\nBut in one turn, he can only do one action: either change orientation or interact, not both.\n\nSo he needs two turns: one to face, one to interact, or if he moves to face, but moving changes orientation.\n\nAt (5,3), facing R, he can on turn 81 change orientation to U, then on turn 82 interact to pick up onion.\n\nThen on turn 82, Alice is at turn 82 changing orientation to D.\n\nLet's list all turns.\n\nTurn 80:\n- Alice: I (pick onion from (3,2), now holding onion)\n- Bob: move R to (5,3) (now at (5,3), facing R)\n\nTurn 81:\n- Alice: move R to (4,1) (now at (4,1), facing R)\n- Bob: change orientation to U (to face (5,4))\n\nTurn 82:\n- Alice: change orientation to D (to face (4,0))\n- Bob: I (pick onion from (5,4), now holding onion)\n\nTurn 83:\n- Alice: I (add onion to (4,0), pot now has 2 onions)\n- Bob: move L to (4,3) (now at (4,3), facing L)\n\nTurn 84:\n- Alice: (free at (4,1), holding nothing)\n- Bob: move D to (4,2) (now at (4,2), facing D)\n\nTurn 85:\n- Alice: (can start moving to get plate)\n- Bob: move D to (4,1) (now at (4,1), facing D)\n\nTurn 86:\n- Bob: I (add onion to (4,0), pot has 3 onions, cooking starts at turn 86)\n\nCooking finishes at turn 91 (86+5).\n\nNow Alice from turn 84 at (4,1), she can go get plate.\n\nAs before, to (1,2) to get plate.\n\nTurn 84: Alice move L to (3,1) (facing L)\n\nTurn 85: move L to (2,1) (facing L)\n\nTurn 86: move L to (1,1) (facing L)\n\nTurn 87: move U to (1,2) (facing U)\n\nTurn 88: change orientation to L (face west to (0,2))\n\nTurn 89: I (grab plate, now holding plate)\n\nSoup finishes at turn 91.\n\nAlice at (1,2) with plate.\n\nShe needs to go back to serve.\n\nTurn 90: move D to (1,1) (facing D)\n\nTurn 91: move R to (2,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 92: move R to (3,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 93: move R to (4,1) (facing R)\n\nAt turn 91, soup is ready, but she arrives at (4,1) at turn 93.\n\nAt turn 93, she is at (4,1), facing R, need to face D to interact with pot.\n\nTurn 94: change orientation to D\n\nTurn 95: I (serve soup, now holding soup on plate)\n\nThen deliver to (7,2).\n\nTurn 96: move R to (5,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 97: move R to (6,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 98: move U to (6,2) (facing U)\n\nTurn 99: change orientation to R (face east to (7,2))\n\nTurn 100: I (deliver soup, reward 20)\n\nBut this is turn 100, and we started at 80, so 20 turns for one soup.\n\nWe can have Bob get the plate while Alice adds the onion, but Alice added second, Bob added third.\n\nAfter Bob adds at turn 86, he is at (4,1), holding nothing, he can get the plate.\n\nFrom (4,1), to (0,2), same path.\n\nOr since there are onions on counters, but for plate, only dispenser.\n\nBob could get plate earlier.\n\nFor example, after Bob picks onion at turn 82, he can go to add, but it takes time.\n\nTo save time, one player focuses on adding ingredients, the other on getting plate.\n\nBut we needed both for adding since two onions to add after Alice's first.\n\nAt turn 80, Alice picks onion, adds at turn 83.\n\nBob picks at turn 82, adds at turn 86.\n\nBetween, Alice can get plate.\n\nAt turn 84, Alice is free, she can go to get plate.\n\nBut she is at (4,1), far from (0,2).\n\nBob, after adding at turn 86, at (4,1), he can go get plate, but Alice is already going.\n\nPerhaps Bob can get the plate while the soup is cooking.\n\nCooking from turn 86 to 91.\n\nAt turn 86, Bob at (4,1), he can start moving to (0,2) to get plate.\n\nThen come back to serve.\n\nBut similar time.\n\nSince serving counter is at (7,2), and plate dispenser at (0,2), it's opposite ends.\n\nBut we have to do it.\n\nPerhaps use existing items, but plates need to be clean, from dispenser.\n\nAnother idea: there might be plates on counters, but not mentioned, only onions are on counters, no plates, so must get from dispenser.\n\nSo let's proceed with Alice getting the plate.\n\nTo reduce turns, Alice can start moving to get plate immediately after adding her onion.\n\nAt turn 83, after adding, she is at (4,1), holding nothing.\n\nTurn 83: Alice move L to (3,1)\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 83 Alice I to add, then turn 84 move L.\n\nIn the first sequence with Bob.\n\nSince the pot at (4,0) has 1 onion already, and we add two more, but there is another pot at (3,0) empty.\n\nBut let's focus on one soup first.\n\nFor the plan, I need to output Alice's actions.\n\nLet's define H, say 15 turns or so.\n\nFrom turn 80 to say 95.\n\nAt turn 80, Alice should interact to pick up the onion at (3,2).\n\nThen move to add to pot.\n\nThen since Bob is adding the third, Alice can go get plate.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 80: I (pick onion from (3,2))\n\nTurn 81: move R to (4,1)  // to (4,1) facing R\n\nTurn 82: change orientation to D  // face down\n\nTurn 83: I (add onion to (4,0))  // pot now 2 onions\n\nNow holding nothing.\n\nTurn 84: move L to (3,1)  // to (3,1) facing L\n\nTurn 85: move L to (2,1)  // to (2,1) facing L, assume (2,1) empty\n\nTurn 86: move L to (1,1)  // to (1,1) facing L\n\nTurn 87: move U to (1,2)  // to (1,2) facing U\n\nTurn 88: change orientation to L  // face west to (0,2)\n\nTurn 89: I (grab plate)  // now holding plate\n\nThen she needs to go back to serve after soup ready.\n\nSoup cooking starts when third onion added. If Bob adds at turn 86, ready at turn 91.\n\nAlice at turn 89 has plate, at (1,2).\n\nTurn 90: move D to (1,1)  // facing D\n\nTurn 91: move R to (2,1)  // facing R\n\nTurn 92: move R to (3,1)  // facing R\n\nTurn 93: move R to (4,1)  // facing R\n\nAt turn 91 soup ready, so at turn 93 she is at (4,1), can serve.\n\nTurn 94: change orientation to D  // face down\n\nTurn 95: I (serve soup, now has soup on plate)\n\nThen deliver.\n\nBut let's stop at turn 95 for now, as H=15 from 80 to 94? 80 to 94 is 15 turns? 80 to 81 is turn 1, up to turn 94 is 15 turns? Let's calculate.\n\nTurns: t1=80, then t1+1=81, ..., up to t1+t for t=1 to H-1? The sequence is for t from t1 to t1 + (H-1), so H actions.\n\nFor example, from turn 80 to turn 80+H-1.\n\nIf H=15, turns 80 to 94.\n\nAt turn 94, Alice is at (4,1) with soup on plate, just served.\n\nThen she can start delivering.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can plan up to turn 94.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 95 she serves, which is turn 80+15=95? t1=80, turn t1: a80, turn t1+1: a81, ..., turn t1+(H-1): a_{t1+H-1}\n\nFor H=15, actions from a80 to a94.\n\nAt a94, in my sequence, she is at (4,1) after moving R from (3,1), facing R, and she needs to face D to serve, but at turn 93 she is at (4,1) facing R, turn 94 change to D, then turn 95 I to serve.\n\nBut turn 94 is a94, which is change orientation.\n\nThen for delivery, it would be beyond.\n\nBut soup is ready at turn 91, so at turn 93 she is at (4,1), she can serve at turn 94 if she faces down.\n\nIn sequence:\n\nTurn 93: move R to (4,1)  // a93 for turn 93\n\nTurn 94: change orientation to D  // a94\n\nThen to serve, it would be turn 95, not in H=15.\n\nSince we have the onion on counter at (3,2), and Alice picks it, but there are many onions, perhaps Bob can add the third onion faster or something.\n\nAnother idea: Alice, after adding the second onion, instead of getting plate, she can get another onion for the other pot, but let's focus on delivering one soup first.\n\nPerhaps the third onion can be added by Bob earlier.\n\nBob is at (4,3) at turn 80, he can go to (4,1) faster or use a closer onion.\n\nFor example, there is onion at (7,1) kitchen counter.\n\n(7,1) has onion.\n\nBob at (4,3), to (7,1): far.\n\nOnion at (2,0), etc.\n\nBut (5,4) is close.\n\nOr (3,2) but Alice picked it.\n\nAt turn 80, Alice picks (3,2) onion, so gone.\n\nBob can pick from (2,2) which has onion.\n\n(2,2) kitchen counter with onion.\n\nBob at (4,3), facing L.\n\nHe can go to (2,2).\n\nPath: (4,3) to (3,3) L, then (2,3)? then to (2,2) D.\n\n(3,3) empty, (2,3) empty, (2,2) counter.\n\nAt (2,3), face D to interact with (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is south of (2,3).\n\nSo Bob turn 80: move L to (3,3) (facing L)\n\nTurn 81: move L to (2,3) (facing L)\n\nTurn 82: change orientation to D (face down)\n\nTurn 83: I (pick onion from (2,2))\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen to pot at (4,0): from (2,3) to (2,2) but not walkable, so to (2,1)? (2,1) empty, then to (3,1), (4,1).\n\nTurn 84: move D to (2,2)? No, (2,2) not walkable, so move to (2,1) if empty, move D to (2,1) (facing D)\n\nTurn 85: move R to (3,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 86: move R to (4,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 87: change orientation to D\n\nTurn 88: I (add onion)\n\nThen cooking starts at turn 88, later than before.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo first plan is better.\n\nFor Alice, to maximize, she can start getting plate early.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 89 she has plate, and soup ready at 91, she serves at 94 or so.\n\nBut for the action sequence, I'll output Alice's actions for H turns.\n\nSet H=12, for example.\n\nFrom turn 80 to 91.\n\nTurn 80: I\nTurn 81: R\nTurn 82: D (change orientation down)\nTurn 83: I (add onion)\nTurn 84: L (move to (3,1))\nTurn 85: L (move to (2,1))\nTurn 86: L (move to (1,1))\nTurn 87: U (move to (1,2))\nTurn 88: L (change orientation left)\nTurn 89: I (grab plate)\nTurn 90: D (move to (1,1))\nTurn 91: R (move to (2,1))\n\nAt turn 91, she is at (2,1), holding plate, soup ready at 91, but she is not at pot yet.\n\nThen she can continue to (3,1), (4,1), etc.\n\nBut with H=12, up to turn 91.\n\nNot complete.\n\nPerhaps Bob can serve, but I need Alice's actions.\n\nAnother idea: after Alice adds the second onion at turn 83, she can go to a closer onion to add the third, but it might not be faster.\n\nFor example, onion at (2,0) kitchen counter.\n\n(2,0) has onion.\n\nAlice at (4,1), turn 84 move L to (3,1), turn 85 move L to (2,1), then turn 86 move D to (2,0)? (2,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nShe needs to be at (2,1) or (1,0), etc.\n\nAt (2,1), she can face D to interact with (2,0) if it has item.\n\n(2,0) has onion, so she can pick it up.\n\nThen add to pot.\n\nTurn 84: move L to (3,1) (facing L)\n\nTurn 85: move L to (2,1) (facing L)\n\nTurn 86: change orientation to D (face down to (2,0))\n\nTurn 87: I (pick up onion from (2,0))\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nTurn 88: move R to (3,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 89: move R to (4,1) (facing R)\n\nTurn 90: change orientation to D\n\nTurn 91: I (add onion to (4,0), cooking starts at 91)\n\nThen she can get plate after.\n\nBut cooking starts later, at turn 91, ready at 96.\n\nThen get plate, etc.\n\nSlower for cooking to start.\n\nSo first approach is better to have cooking start earlier.\n\nI think the initial coordination with Bob adding third onion is fine.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide Alice's actions for H=15 turns, from turn 80 to 94.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 80: I  // pick onion from (3,2)\n\nTurn 81: R  // move to (4,1)\n\nTurn 82: D  // change orientation to down\n\nTurn 83: I  // add onion to (4,0), pot has 2 onions\n\nTurn 84: L  // move to (3,1)\n\nTurn 85: L  // move to (2,1), assume empty\n\nTurn 86: L  // move to (1,1), assume empty\n\nTurn 87: U  // move to (1,2)\n\nTurn 88: L  // change orientation to left (west)\n\nTurn 89: I  // grab plate from (0,2) dispenser\n\nTurn 90: D  // move to (1,1)\n\nTurn 91: R  // move to (2,1)\n\nTurn 92: R  // move to (3,1)\n\nTurn 93: R  // move to (4,1)\n\nTurn 94: D  // change orientation to down\n\nAt turn 94, she is at (4,1) facing down, ready to serve at turn 95.\n\nBut turn 94 is the last for H=15, since turns 80 to 94 is 15 actions (80,81,...,94).\n\nNumber of turns: from 80 to 94 inclusive is 15 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nThen she can serve next turn.\n\nFor the reward, it will be delivered soon after.\n\nTo have the sequence, this should work.\n\nIn this, Bob adds the third onion around turn 86, so soup ready at 91, and Alice is back at (4,1) at turn 93, so at turn 94 she faces down, turn 95 serves.\n\nBut with actions up to turn 94, she is positioned to serve.\n\nSimilarly, for delivery, it can be later.\n\nSo for the plan, this is a good sequence.\n\nAlice's action history has recent actions, but I think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice:\n\nTurn 80: I\n\nTurn 81: R\n\nTurn 82: D\n\nTurn 83: I\n\nTurn 84: L\n\nTurn 85: L\n\nTurn 86: L\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: L\n\nTurn 89: I\n\nTurn 90: D\n\nTurn 91: R\n\nTurn 92: R\n\nTurn 93: R\n\nTurn 94: D\n\nIn turn 88, L is change orientation to left, not move.\n\nSimilarly, turn 82 D is change orientation.\n\nIn the actions, D can be move or change orientation, but in context, when not moving, it's change orientation.\n\nIn the action list, Move (L/R/U/D) or Change Orientation (L/R/U/D), so we need to specify.\n\nIn the answer, actions are U,D,L,R,I,S, so U can be move up or change orientation up, depending on context, but the player action is one of these, and it's specified by the type.\n\nIn the description, player actions per turn: Move (L/R/U/D), Change Orientation (L/R/U/D), Interact (I), Stay (S).\n\nSo in the sequence, for example, when we say \"R\", it could be move right or change orientation right.\n\nTo avoid confusion, in the sequence, we need to indicate, but in the answer format, it's just the letter, so it should be clear from context.\n\nIn the move action, it changes position and orientation, while change orientation only changes orientation.\n\nIn the sequence, for example, turn 81: R (move right to (4,1), changing position and orientation to right)\n\nTurn 82: D (change orientation to down, no move)\n\nThen turn 83: I (interact)\n\nSimilarly, turn 84: L (move left to (3,1))\n\netc.\n\nIn turn 88: L (change orientation to left, no move)\n\nYes.\n\nFor the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should coordinate to complete the onion soup in the pot at (4,0), which already contains 1 onion, by adding 2 more onions. This will start the cooking process (5-turn cook time), after which the soup can be served and delivered for a reward of 20. Given the current state, Alice is well-positioned to pick up an onion from the kitchen counter at (3,2) immediately, while Bob should focus on obtaining the second onion (e.g., from (5,4)) and adding it to the pot. Alice can then prioritize getting a clean plate from the dispenser at (0,2) while the soup cooks, and return to serve and deliver it.\n\n### Key Coordination Points:\n- **Adding Ingredients**: Alice adds the second onion to the pot at (4,0) by turn 83. Bob adds the third onion by turn 86, starting the cook at turn 86 (ready at turn 91).\n- **Getting the Plate**: Alice fetches a plate during the cook time (turns 84-89).\n- **Serving and Delivery**: Alice serves the soup at turn 95 and delivers it by turn 100, but the sequence below focuses on Alice's actions up to turn 94 (H=15 turns), positioning her to serve the soup immediately after.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (turns 80 to 94):\n- **Turn 80**: `I` - Alice interacts with the kitchen counter at (3,2) to pick up an onion. She is at (3,1), facing up, so this is feasible.\n- **Turn 81**: `R` - Move right to (4,1), changing orientation to right.\n- **Turn 82**: `D` - Change orientation to down (to face the pot at (4,0)).\n- **Turn 83**: `I` - Interact with the pot at (4,0) to add the onion. Pot now has 2 onions.\n- **Turn 84**: `L` - Move left to (3,1), changing orientation to left (beginning the journey to get a plate).\n- **Turn 85**: `L` - Move left to (2,1), changing orientation to left (assume (2,1) is empty).\n- **Turn 86**: `L` - Move left to (1,1), changing orientation to left (assume (1,1) is empty).\n- **Turn 87**: `U` - Move up to (1,2), changing orientation to up.\n- **Turn 88**: `L` - Change orientation to left (to face the plate dispenser at (0,2)).\n- **Turn 89**: `I` - Interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2) to grab a clean plate.\n- **Turn 90**: `D` - Move down to (1,1), changing orientation to down.\n- **Turn 91**: `R` - Move right to (2,1), changing orientation to right (soup is now ready at turn 91, but Alice is en route).\n- **Turn 92**: `R` - Move right to (3,1), changing orientation to right.\n- **Turn 93**: `R` - Move right to (4,1), changing orientation to right.\n- **Turn 94**: `D` - Change orientation to down (to face the pot at (4,0) for serving).\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- By turn 94, Alice is at (4,1), facing down, holding a plate, and ready to serve the cooked soup at turn 95. Bob is expected to handle other tasks (e.g., adding the third onion) but is not critical for Alice's sequence. The soup delivery (turn 95-100) yields a reward of 20. If Bob cooperates optimally, this sequence maximizes efficiency for one soup delivery within the horizon.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 80: I \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: R \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: I \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: L \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: L \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: L \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: L \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: I \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: R \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: R \\\\ \\text{Turn } 93: R \\\\ \\text{Turn } 94: D \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current game state and plan actions for Alice to maximize the reward from delivering soup. The goal is to deliver as many soups as possible, especially the recipes that give higher rewards. Here, there's only one recipe mentioned: Recipe 1 requires 3 onions, 0 tomatoes, with a reward of 20 and cooking time of 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t1 = 84.\n\nPlayer states:\n\n- Alice (me): Position (4,1), orientation Down (D), holding nothing. Action history: U, I, R, D, I (most recent last).\n\n- Bob: Position (4,3), orientation Right (R), holding one onion. Action history: L, L, U, I, R.\n\nTile types:\n\n- Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4)\n\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n\n- Pots at (3,0) and (4,0)\n\n- Serving counter at (7,2)\n\n- Kitchen counters at various positions, many holding onions: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (2,0), (2,2), (0,3), (5,2) all have onions.\n\nPot state:\n\n- Pot at (4,0) has 2 onions and 0 tomatoes, not full, so cooking hasn't started. It needs one more onion to start cooking.\n\nSince the pot has 2 onions, adding one more onion will start the cooking process. After 5 turns, it will be cooked and can be served.\n\nAlice is at (4,1), which is above the pot at (4,0). Since she's facing down and (4,0) is directly below her, she can interact with it if she moves down or is already adjacent and facing it.\n\nBut Alice is at (4,1), and (4,0) is directly below, so she is adjacent vertically. Since she's facing down, she should be able to interact with the pot without moving, right? Let me confirm the interaction rules.\n\nInteract (I) requires: Player must be standing on an empty tile adjacent to the target tile and facing it.\n\nAlice is at (4,1), which is empty (since it's a position, and tile types include kitchen counters, but (4,1) isn't listed as a kitchen counter or anything, so it should be an empty tile). The grid isn't fully specified, but from the tile types, (4,1) isn't mentioned, so it's probably an empty tile.\n\nShe is adjacent to (4,0) below her, and she's facing down, so she can interact with the pot.\n\nBut she's holding nothing. What can she do with the pot? To add an ingredient, she needs to be holding an ingredient. She has nothing, so she can't add anything. To serve soup, she needs a plate with soup, but the pot isn't cooked yet.\n\nSo for Alice, interacting now might not do anything useful since she has no item.\n\nBob is at (4,3), holding one onion. (4,3) is above (4,2), but (4,2) isn't specified. Let's see the grid layout.\n\nPositions: Alice at (4,1), Bob at (4,3). Pot at (4,0) and (3,0).\n\n(4,1) to (4,0) is directly below, so Alice can access pot at (4,0) by facing down.\n\nBob is at (4,3), so to access pot at (4,0), he needs to move down to (4,2) or something. Let's sketch the grid mentally.\n\nAssume the grid is 8x5 or something, but not specified. From tile positions:\n\n- Kitchen counters at (0,0) to (7,0) except (3,0) and (4,0) are pots? No, pots are at (3,0) and (4,0), and kitchen counters include (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0) for y=0. So row y=0 has counters and pots.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut for positions, Alice at (4,1), which is not listed in any tile, so empty.\n\nBob at (4,3), not listed, so empty.\n\nNow, Bob is holding an onion. He could add it to the pot to complete the soup.\n\nBut he is at (4,3), and pot is at (4,0). He needs to get closer.\n\nFirst, he needs to be adjacent to the pot and facing it.\n\nSimilarly, Alice could help by getting an onion or a plate, but since the pot needs only one more onion, and Bob has it, it might be efficient for Bob to add it.\n\nBut Alice is closer to the pot? Alice is at (4,1), pot at (4,0). If she moves down to (4,0), but (4,0) is a pot tile, not walkable. Players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles.\n\nFrom rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and pots are non-empty tiles.\n\nSo Alice at (4,1) can only interact with (4,0) if she is adjacent and facing it, which she is, since (4,1) is adjacent to (4,0) vertically, and she faces down.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (4,3) is adjacent to (4,2) and (4,4), etc.\n\nTo interact with pot at (4,0), Bob needs to be at a position adjacent to it, like (4,1), (3,0), or (5,0), but (3,0) and (5,0) are pots or counters? (3,0) is a pot, (5,0) is a kitchen counter, both non-empty, so he can't stand there.\n\nAdjacent tiles: for pot at (4,0), adjacent positions are (4,1) above, (3,0) left, (5,0) right. But (3,0) and (5,0) are non-empty, so only (4,1) is a walkable adjacent tile.\n\nSo only from (4,1) facing down can one interact with pot at (4,0).\n\nAlice is currently at (4,1), facing down, so she can interact.\n\nBut she has no item, so she can't add anything.\n\nBob is at (4,3), holding an onion. He needs to go to (4,1) to interact with the pot.\n\nBut Alice is at (4,1), so Bob can't move to (4,1) because players can't walk through each other.\n\nSo Alice needs to move away so Bob can use the spot.\n\nAlternatively, Alice could pick up an item or do something else.\n\nFirst, let's think about completing this soup.\n\nPot at (4,0) has 2 onions, needs one more to start cooking. Cooking takes 5 turns, then it can be served.\n\nAfter serving, we get reward.\n\nBut we need to serve it with a plate.\n\nCurrently, no one has a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nAlso, there are onions on kitchen counters, but we might not need more onions immediately.\n\nSince Bob has an onion, and he can add it to the pot if he gets to (4,1).\n\nBut Alice is there, so she needs to move.\n\nAlice could move to free up (4,1) for Bob.\n\nAlice's orientation is down, so she can interact or move.\n\nIf she moves, say left, right, up, down, but down to (4,0) is not possible, since non-empty.\n\nSo she can move left to (3,1), right to (5,1), or up to (4,2)? (4,2) is not listed, so probably empty.\n\n(4,2): let's see, kitchen counters include (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)? Tile types: kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) are listed? Yes, from the list: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) are kitchen counters.\n\nTile types: \"Kitchen Counter: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (0, 1), (7, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (0, 3), (7, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)]\"\n\nSo (4,2) is a kitchen counter, non-empty? But it might have an item or not.\n\nNon-empty kitchen counters are listed separately: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter on (6,4): contains a onion; etc.\" and (4,2) is not in the non-empty list, so (4,2) is a kitchen counter but currently empty, I think.\n\nThe tile is a kitchen counter, which is a type of tile, and it can hold items. If it has an item, it's non-empty, else empty for interaction.\n\nBut for walking, kitchen counters are non-empty tiles, players cannot walk on them.\n\nFrom rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and kitchen counters are listed as tile types, so they are not empty tiles; they are obstacles.\n\nTile types: Empty Tile is walkable, others are not, except dispensers? Let's see.\n\n\"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\"\n\n\"Dispensers: Sources for items\" – but can players walk on dispensers? Not specified.\n\nRule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and \"non-empty tiles\" probably means tiles that are not empty, like dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters, which all have functions.\n\nAlso, from interaction: \"Interact effects depend on game state and tile type\" and for interact, player must be on adjacent empty tile.\n\nSo, only empty tiles are walkable; all other tiles are non-empty and not walkable.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Empty tiles: walkable\n\n- Dispensers: not walkable, but can be adjacent to interact\n\n- Pot: not walkable, adjacent interact\n\n- Serving counter: not walkable, adjacent interact\n\n- Kitchen counter: not walkable, adjacent interact\n\nIn this case, for position (4,1): not listed in any tile type, so it must be an empty tile, walkable.\n\n(4,2) is listed as kitchen counter, so not walkable; it's a tile where items can be placed.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) Bob is there, not listed, so empty tile? But Bob is on it, so occupied by player, but tile itself is empty.\n\nPlayers occupy tiles, so if a player is on a tile, it's occupied, but the tile type determines if it's walkable when empty.\n\nGenerally, only empty tiles are walkable, and players can be on them.\n\nFor (4,2): it's a kitchen counter tile, so not walkable; no player can be on it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,0) is pot, not walkable.\n\nSo back to Alice at (4,1), empty tile, facing down towards pot (4,0).\n\nShe can move left to (3,1), right to (5,1), or up to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she can only move to adjacent empty tiles.\n\nWhat is adjacent? (4,1) has neighbors: left (3,1), right (5,1), down (4,0) not walkable, up (4,2) not walkable because kitchen counter.\n\n(4,2) is kitchen counter, so not walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) and (5,1): are they empty?\n\n(3,1) not listed, so probably empty.\n\n(5,1) not listed, but (5,0) is kitchen counter, (5,2) is kitchen counter, but (5,1) not listed, so likely empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) not listed, empty.\n\nSo Alice can move left to (3,1) or right to (5,1).\n\nShe could change orientation or stay, but moving might be better.\n\nBob at (4,3), orientation right.\n\n(4,3) neighbors: left (3,3), right (5,3), down (4,2) not walkable, up (4,4) which is onion dispenser? Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), so (4,4) is dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSo Bob can move left to (3,3), right to (5,3), or down? (4,2) not walkable, so he can only move left or right, or change orientation.\n\nHe can also move up? (4,4) is dispenser, not walkable, so no, only left or right horizontally, since (4,2) down is kitchen counter.\n\ny-coordinates: y=4 is top? Not specified, but usually y increases up or down? From actions, U is y+1, D is y-1, so y=0 is bottom, y=4 is top.\n\nIn position, Alice at (4,1), Bob at (4,3), so y=3 is higher than y=1.\n\nPot at (4,0), y=0.\n\nSo for Bob at (4,3), he can move to (3,3) or (5,3), both likely empty tiles.\n\nHe is holding an onion, and he can add it to the pot if he gets to (4,1).\n\nBut to get to (4,1), he needs to go through (4,2), which is not walkable, so he can't go directly down.\n\nHe needs to go around.\n\nFor example, he can go left to (3,3), then down to (3,2)? (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(3,2) is kitchen counter, so not walkable.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,3), down to (5,2) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo there is no direct path down from y=3 to y=1 at x=4 because (4,2) is a kitchen counter blocking the way.\n\nHe has to go around via other columns.\n\nFor example, to the left: from (4,3) to (3,3), then to (3,2) not possible, so to (2,3)? But (2,3) not listed, probably empty, then to (2,2) kitchen counter not walkable, so he can go to (2,1) or something.\n\nThis might take multiple moves.\n\nSimilarly to the right.\n\nBut time is important; we want to add the onion soon to start cooking.\n\nAlice is at (4,1), and she can interact with the pot, but she has nothing. However, she could pick up an item from a kitchen counter or something.\n\nThere are onions on kitchen counters, but she is empty-handed, so she could pick up an onion if she goes to a counter with onion.\n\nBut the pot needs only one more onion, and Bob has it, so it's better for Bob to add it if possible.\n\nBut since Bob can't easily reach (4,1), Alice could get an onion from a nearby counter and add it herself.\n\nLet's see what kitchen counters have onions and are accessible.\n\nNon-empty kitchen counters: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (2,0), (2,2), (0,3), (5,2) all have onions.\n\nAlice is at (4,1). She can move to (3,1) or (5,1).\n\nFrom (5,1), she is adjacent to (5,0) kitchen counter, but (5,0) is a kitchen counter tile, and it might have an item or not.\n\nNon-empty kitchen counters include (5,0)? List: (2,0) has onion, but (5,0) is not in the non-empty list, so (5,0) is a kitchen counter but empty, no item.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) has onion, but (5,2) is at y=2, which is above.\n\nAlice at (4,1) can move to (5,1), then she is adjacent to (5,2) kitchen counter above, but to interact, she needs to be facing it. (5,2) is at (5,2), which is up from (5,1), so if she moves to (5,1) and faces up, she can interact with (5,2) if it has an item.\n\n(5,2) has an onion, so she could pick it up.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,1), she can interact with (3,2) if she faces up, but (3,2) is kitchen counter, and it has an item? Non-empty counters: (2,2) has onion, (3,2) is not listed as non-empty, so probably empty.\n\nNon-empty list: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (2,0), (2,2), (0,3), (5,2) — so (3,2) not listed, so no item.\n\nSimilarly, other counters.\n\nSo for Alice, if she moves to (5,1), she can face up and interact with (5,2) to pick up the onion there.\n\nThen she can go back to (4,1) and add the onion to the pot.\n\nBut (5,2) is at (5,2), Alice at (4,1) to (5,1) is one move right, then from (5,1) to interact with (5,2), she needs to face up, which might require a change orientation or move, but she can change orientation after moving.\n\nAction sequence: at turn t1, Alice can move right to (5,1), then at next turn, change orientation to up (U) or move, but to interact, she can face up and interact.\n\nBut she can only do one action per turn.\n\nAlso, Bob can be doing something.\n\nFirst, let's plan for Alice.\n\nSince the pot needs one onion, and Bob has one, but he is far, Alice can get an onion quickly.\n\nNearest onion on counter: (5,2) is at (5,2), which is close to (4,1).\n\nAlice at (4,1) to (5,1) is one move right.\n\nFrom (5,1), she can face up to interact with (5,2) kitchen counter.\n\n(5,2) is above (5,1), so facing up, she can pick up the onion.\n\nThen she can move left to (4,1), face down, and interact to add onion to pot.\n\nThat would take: turn 1: move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 2: change orientation U? Or directly interact? To interact with (5,2), she needs to face it, so if after moving to (5,1), she is facing right? When she moves, her orientation changes to the direction of move, I think.\n\nAction: Move (L/R/U/D) changes position and orientation.\n\nSo if she moves right to (5,1), her orientation becomes R.\n\nBut to interact with (5,2) which is up, she needs to face up, so she must change orientation to U.\n\nThen interact.\n\nSo actions:\n\n- Move R to (5,1): now at (5,1), orientation R.\n\n- Change orientation to U: now facing up.\n\n- Interact (I) to pick up onion from (5,2). Now holding onion.\n\nThen, she needs to go back to (4,1) to add to pot.\n\nFrom (5,1), move L to (4,1): now at (4,1), orientation? After move left, orientation L.\n\nThen, to interact with pot at (4,0) below, she needs to face down, so change orientation to D, then interact.\n\nSo that's two more actions.\n\nTotal for Alice to add onion: 4 actions: move R, face U, interact (pick up), move L, face D, interact (add) — that's 5 actions? Let's list:\n\n1. Move R to (5,1)  // position (5,1), orientation R\n\n2. Change orientation to U  // now facing up\n\n3. Interact: pick up onion from (5,2)  // now holding onion\n\n4. Move L to (4,1)  // position (4,1), orientation L (after move)\n\n5. Change orientation to D  // facing down\n\n6. Interact: add onion to pot at (4,0)\n\n6 actions, but we need to start from turn t1.\n\nAt turn t1, Alice can act immediately.\n\nBut Bob can also act; he might be able to add his onion if he finds a way.\n\nBob is at (4,3) holding onion.\n\nHe can't go down directly.\n\nHe can move left to (3,3) or right to (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move down to (3,2)? (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so he can't.\n\nSimilarly, to (2,3) or something.\n\nLet's find a path to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,1) is blocked at (4,2).\n\nSo he needs to go left or right.\n\nFor example, go to (3,3), then to (2,3) if empty, then to (2,2) not walkable, to (2,1)? (2,1) not listed, probably empty.\n\n(2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1).\n\n(3,1) is empty, as per earlier.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3) to (5,3), to (6,3) if empty, to (6,2) kitchen counter not walkable, etc.\n\nShortest way: to (3,3), then to (2,3)? (2,3) not listed, assume empty.\n\nThen from (2,3) to (2,2) not possible, so to (2,1) or (1,3), etc.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,2) not walkable, so he can move down to (2,2) only if it were empty, but it's not, so he must go to (1,3) or (3,3), but (3,3) he came from.\n\nPerhaps to (1,3) if empty.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nFrom (4,3), move left to (3,3), then move down? But (3,2) is not walkable, so he can only move to (2,3) if available, but (2,3) not specified.\n\nAssume the grid has empty tiles at (3,3), (2,3), (2,2) is kitchen counter, so (2,3) to (2,2) not possible, so he can go to (2,4) or (1,3), but (2,4) is kitchen counter? Kitchen counters include (2,4), which is non-empty, not walkable.\n\nKitchen counters: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) — so (2,4) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo from (4,3), Bob can move to (3,3) or (5,3).\n\nSay (3,3): then from there, he can move to (3,4)? (3,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable.\n\nOr move to (2,3), if (2,3) is empty.\n\nAssume (2,3) is empty tile.\n\nThen from (2,3), he can move to (2,4) not possible, or to (1,3), or to (2,2) not possible, or to (3,3).\n\nSo he can move to (1,3) if empty.\n\n(1,3) not listed, probably empty.\n\nThen from (1,3) to (1,2)? (1,2) not listed, but (1,1) or something.\n\nThis is taking too many moves.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,3), then to (1,2) if empty, then to (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (3,1), then to (4,1).\n\nMany moves.\n\nSimilarly for right side.\n\nBob would take at least 4-5 moves to reach (4,1), whereas Alice can add an onion in about 4-5 actions as I outlined.\n\nBut Alice can do it faster if she doesn't need to change orientation much.\n\nAnother idea: Alice is at (4,1), facing down. She can move left to (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), she can face up to interact with (3,2), but (3,2) has no item, so no.\n\nOr she can move to (3,1), then face down to interact with (3,0) pot? (3,0) is a pot, but it has no ingredients, I think.\n\nPot at (3,0): not mentioned in state, so probably empty or not started.\n\nPot state only mentioned (4,0) has 2 onions, so (3,0) is empty.\n\nSo not useful.\n\nAlice can go to (5,1) as before.\n\nBut to save time, since there is an onion at (7,1), which is closer? (7,1) is kitchen counter with onion.\n\nAlice at (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1)? (6,1) not listed, probably empty.\n\nThen to (7,1) kitchen counter, but she can't stand on it, so from (6,1), face left or right to interact with (7,1)? (7,1) is at (7,1), (6,1) is left of it? (7,1) x=7,y=1, (6,1) x=6,y=1, so adjacent horizontally.\n\nFrom (6,1), facing right, she can interact with (7,1) kitchen counter to pick up onion.\n\nBut (6,1) might not be empty; it could be.\n\nFirst, from (4,1) to (5,1) move R, then to (6,1) move R, then at (6,1) facing right (after move), interact with (7,1) to pick up onion.\n\nThen she needs to go back to (4,1) to add to pot.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (5,1) move L, to (4,1) move L, then face D, interact.\n\nMany moves.\n\n(5,2) is closer: only one move to (5,1), then interact with (5,2).\n\nAs I thought earlier.\n\nSince Bob has an onion, and he can't reach easily, Alice can add one quickly.\n\nBut there are many onions on counters, so it's fine.\n\nAnother option: Alice can stay at (4,1) and do nothing, but that's wasteful.\n\nOr she can change orientation, but not useful.\n\nPerhaps Bob can place his onion on a kitchen counter nearby, then Alice can pick it up and add, but that might not save time.\n\nFor example, Bob at (4,3) can move to (5,3), then face down to interact with (5,2) kitchen counter, but (5,2) has an onion already, so he can place his onion there if it's empty, but (5,2) is occupied with onion, so he can't place; he can only place on empty kitchen counter.\n\nKitchen counters that are empty: for example, (3,2) is kitchen counter, not in non-empty list, so empty.\n\nSo Bob can go to (3,3), face down to interact with (3,2) if he is at (3,3) facing down.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), (3,3) is above it, so from (3,3) facing down, he can interact with (3,2) kitchen counter.\n\nSince (3,2) is empty, he can place his onion there.\n\nThen Alice can pick it up from (3,1) or something.\n\nBut Alice is at (4,1), she can move to (3,1), face up to interact with (3,2) to pick up onion, then move back to (4,1), face down, add to pot.\n\nBut similar number of actions.\n\nLet's count actions for Alice to add onion from (5,2):\n\n- t1: move R to (5,1)  // at (5,1), ori R\n\n- t1+1: change ori to U  // face up\n\n- t1+2: interact, pick up onion from (5,2)  // now holding onion\n\n- t1+3: move L to (4,1)  // at (4,1), ori L\n\n- t1+4: change ori to D  // face down\n\n- t1+5: interact, add onion to pot at (4,0)\n\nAfter adding, the pot has 3 onions, cooking starts immediately, and will be ready in 5 turns.\n\nAt turn t1+5, cooking starts, so at turn t1+5 +5 = t1+10, it is cooked.\n\nThen we need to serve it with a plate.\n\nSo Alice or Bob needs to get a plate from dispenser at (0,2), then go to pot, pick up soup, then to serving counter at (7,2) to deliver.\n\nBut during cooking, we can prepare the plate.\n\nFirst, let's focus on adding the onion.\n\nBob can also help.\n\nBob is at (4,3), holding onion. He could go to another pot, but the other pot at (3,0) is empty, so he could start a new soup, but that might take longer.\n\nSince we have many onions, we can make multiple soups.\n\nBut recipe requires 3 onions, reward 20.\n\nFirst, complete the current pot.\n\nFor efficiency, Alice can add the onion as above.\n\nBut let's see if Bob can add it faster.\n\nBob at (4,3) can move to (5,3) for example.\n\nThen from (5,3), he can face down to interact with (5,2) kitchen counter, but (5,2) has an onion, so he can't place unless it's empty, or he can pick up? But he is holding an onion, so he can only place if the counter is empty.\n\n(5,2) has onion, so not empty, he can't interact to place.\n\nHe can move to (5,4)? (5,4) is kitchen counter with onion? Non-empty kitchen counters include (5,4) has onion, so not walkable.\n\nHe can go to (6,3) if empty, etc.\n\nIt's inefficient.\n\nSo probably, Alice should add the onion using a nearby counter onion.\n\nTo save actions, Alice at (4,1) can immediately interact with the pot, but since she has nothing, it might do nothing, or perhaps she can check, but no, to add ingredient, she needs to hold item.\n\nSo she must get an item first.\n\nPerhaps she can move to (5,1) and interact with (5,2) without changing orientation, but when she moves to (5,1), she is facing right, and (5,2) is up, not adjacent horizontally or vertically? (5,1) and (5,2) are adjacent vertically, so she needs to face up to interact.\n\nMust change orientation.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can change orientation to face right or left, then move, but not helpful.\n\nSo I think 4-5 actions to add the onion.\n\nBut let's include Bob in the plan.\n\nBob can be getting a plate or something.\n\nBob is at (4,3), holding onion. Since he can't add it easily, he can place it on a counter for later use or drop it to do something else.\n\nFor example, he can place the onion on an empty kitchen counter nearby.\n\nSay at (3,2), which is empty.\n\nBob at (4,3) move left to (3,3), then face down to interact with (3,2) kitchen counter, place onion.\n\nThen he is free to get a plate or other.\n\nActions for Bob:\n\n- Move L to (3,3)  // at (3,3), ori L (after move)\n\n- Change ori to D  // face down\n\n- Interact: place onion on (3,2)  // now empty-handed\n\nThen he can go to plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nBut (0,2) is far.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,3) move L, to (1,3) move L, to (0,3) kitchen counter with onion, not walkable, so from (1,3) to (0,3) not possible, but (0,2) is plate dispenser.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nBob at (1,3) can move down to (1,2)? (1,2) not listed, assume empty, then to (1,1) or to (0,2) not walkable.\n\nFrom (1,2), if he faces left, he can interact with (0,2) plate dispenser to grab plate.\n\nBut many moves.\n\nNot efficient for now.\n\nPerhaps Alice adds the onion, and Bob starts preparing for serving.\n\nBut let's first add the onion.\n\nI think Alice should do it as planned.\n\nAt turn t1=84, Alice actions:\n\nTurn 84: move R to (5,1)\n\nThen she is at (5,1), ori R.\n\nBut for the sequence, we need to output actions for Alice.\n\nThe task is to plan for Alice, and optionally Bob, but since we control Alice, we plan her actions.\n\nBob is teammate, we can suggest or assume he cooperates, but in this case, we only output Alice's actions.\n\nThe answer format is only for Alice, I think.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" but in answer format, only Alice's actions are listed.\n\nSo I think we only output Alice's actions.\n\nBob will act on his own, but we can assume he is rational.\n\nTo maximize reward, we need to coordinate, but for the plan, we focus on Alice.\n\nSo for Alice, to add the onion to the pot.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 84: Move R to (5,1)  // t1=84\n\nTurn 85: Change orientation to U (since to interact with (5,2) above)\n\nTurn 86: Interact to pick up onion from (5,2)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nTurn 87: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 88: Change orientation to D (facing down)\n\nTurn 89: Interact to add onion to pot at (4,0)\n\nAfter this, pot at (4,0) has 3 onions, cooking starts at turn 89.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, so cooked at turn 89 + 5 = turn 94.\n\nNow, at turn 89, Alice is at (4,1), holding nothing (since she added onion), facing down.\n\nShe can now get a plate to serve the soup later.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nShe needs to go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nPath from (4,1) to (0,2).\n\n(4,1) to (3,1) move L, then to (2,1)? (2,1) not listed, assume empty.\n\nThen to (1,1), then to (0,1) kitchen counter with item? (0,1) is kitchen counter, non-empty? Non-empty list has (0,3) and (7,1), but (0,1) not listed, so kitchen counter but empty.\n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter tile, not walkable.\n\nSo Alice can't go directly.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (2,0) kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\nSo she can go up or down.\n\ny=1 to y=2, but (4,2) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) to (3,1), then to (3,0) not walkable, so to (3,2) not walkable.\n\nMust go to (2,1) or (1,1).\n\nAssume (3,1) to (2,1) move L, (2,1) to (1,1) move L, then from (1,1) to (1,2) move U, then from (1,2) to (0,2) not walkable, but from (1,2) facing left, she can interact with (0,2) plate dispenser to grab a plate.\n\n(0,2) is plate dispenser, so from (1,2) facing west, she can interact.\n\nFirst, positions: (1,2) should be empty tile.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (3,1): move L\n\nTo (2,1): move L (assuming (2,1) empty)\n\nTo (1,1): move L\n\nTo (1,2): move U (to y+1)\n\nAt (1,2), orientation U? After move up, ori U.\n\nBut to interact with (0,2) which is left, she needs to face left.\n\nSo change ori to L, then interact.\n\nActions:\n\nFrom (4,1) after adding onion, at turn 89, position (4,1), ori D, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 90: move L to (3,1), ori L\n\nTurn 91: move L to (2,1), ori L (after move, but since moving left, ori L)\n\nTurn 92: move L to (1,1), ori L\n\nTurn 93: move U to (1,2), ori U\n\nTurn 94: change ori to L (face left)\n\nTurn 95: interact to grab plate from dispenser at (0,2), now holding clean plate.\n\nNow at turn 95, she has a plate, but the soup is cooked at turn 94? Cooking started at turn 89, cooked at turn 89+5=94.\n\nAt turn 94, soup is ready.\n\nAlice at turn 95 has plate, but she is at (1,2), need to go back to pot at (4,0) to serve the soup.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (1,1) move D, to (2,1) move R, to (3,1) move R, to (4,1) move R.\n\nAt (4,1), face down, interact to serve soup from pot.\n\nBut to serve soup, she needs to be holding a plate, and interact with pot to get the soup on plate, then go to serving counter.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. At pot with plate, interact to pick up soup, now holding soup on plate.\n\n2. Then go to serving counter at (7,2) to deliver.\n\nFirst, from current position.\n\nAt turn 95, Alice at (1,2), holding plate.\n\nTurn 96: move D to (1,1), ori D\n\nTurn 97: move R to (2,1), ori R\n\nTurn 98: move R to (3,1), ori R\n\nTurn 99: move R to (4,1), ori R\n\nNow at (4,1), ori R, but need to face down to interact with pot (4,0).\n\nTurn 100: change ori to D\n\nTurn 101: interact to serve soup from pot, now holding soup.\n\nThen to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (5,1) move R, to (6,1) move R, then to (6,2)? (6,2) not listed, but (6,0) kitchen counter, (6,1) empty? Assume (6,1) empty.\n\nThen from (6,1) to (7,1) kitchen counter with onion, not walkable, so can't go to (7,1).\n\nServing counter at (7,2), which is above (7,1)? (7,1) is kitchen counter, (7,2) is serving counter.\n\nFrom (6,1), she can move up to (6,2), but (6,2) is kitchen counter? Kitchen counters include (6,2)? List: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) — (6,2) not listed, so probably not a kitchen counter, might be empty.\n\nTile types: serving counter at (7,2), and kitchen counters at positions listed, so (6,2) not listed, so empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (7,2) is serving counter, not walkable.\n\nSo from (4,1) to (5,1) move R, to (6,1) move R, then to (6,2) move U, at (6,2) facing north, then face right to interact with (7,2) serving counter.\n\n(7,2) is east of (6,2), so face east, interact to deliver.\n\nActions:\n\nAfter picking up soup at turn 101, at (4,1), holding soup, ori D.\n\nTurn 102: move R to (5,1), ori R\n\nTurn 103: move R to (6,1), ori R\n\nTurn 104: move U to (6,2), ori U\n\nTurn 105: change ori to R (face east)\n\nTurn 106: interact to deliver soup at (7,2), get reward.\n\nBut this is many turns, and we started from t1=84.\n\nCooking started at turn 89, cooked at 94, served at turn 106, that's a long time.\n\nBob can help to get the plate or serve.\n\nFor example, while Alice is adding the onion, Bob can go get a plate.\n\nBob is at (4,3) initially, holding onion.\n\nAt turn 84, Bob can place his onion or move.\n\nSuppose at turn 84, Bob moves left to (3,3), then to (2,3), etc., to go to plate dispenser.\n\nBut it might be faster for Alice to get the plate after adding onion, but she is far.\n\nAnother idea: Alice, after adding onion at turn 89, can go directly to plate dispenser, but as above.\n\nSince there are multiple onions, Bob can start another soup at pot (3,0).\n\nFor example, Bob has an onion, he can go to (3,0) but can't stand on it.\n\nHe needs to be at (3,1) or (4,0) but (4,0) is occupied.\n\n(3,1) is empty, he can go there.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (3,3) move L, then to (3,2) not possible, so to (2,3) move L, to (2,2) not possible, to (2,1) move D, etc.\n\nTo reach (3,1), from (4,3) to (3,3) move L, then to (3,2) not possible, so he must go to (2,3) or (3,4) not possible, so to (2,3), then to (2,1) or (1,3).\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,1): move D to (2,2) not possible, so he can move to (1,3), then to (1,2), then to (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nMany moves.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps for now, focus on delivering the current soup quickly.\n\nSince the pot at (4,0) will be cooking for 5 turns, during that time, Alice or Bob can get a plate and be ready.\n\nAlice is at (4,1) after adding onion, she can immediately go for a plate.\n\nBut as calculated, it takes about 6 turns to get to (1,2) and grab plate (from turn 89 to 95), then soup ready at 94, so she can grab plate at 95, then go back to pot.\n\nBut at turn 94, soup is ready, but she is at (1,2) with plate, so she needs to go back to (4,1) to serve, which takes 4 moves, then interact, then go to serving counter.\n\nServe at pot: interact with pot while holding plate to get soup on plate.\n\nThen go to serving counter.\n\nIn the sequence above, she gets plate at turn 95, back to (4,1) at turn 99, serve soup at turn 101, then to serving counter at turn 106.\n\nTotal from t1=84 to 106, 22 turns for one soup.\n\nBut we can do better with Bob helping.\n\nFor example, Bob can get the plate while Alice is busy.\n\nAt turn 84, Bob is at (4,3), holding onion.\n\nHe can place the onion on a counter first.\n\nSay, move to (3,3) turn 84, face down turn 85, interact place onion on (3,2) turn 86.\n\nThen he is free.\n\nTurn 87, move to (2,3) if empty, turn 88 move to (1,3), turn 89 move to (1,2), turn 90 face left, turn 91 interact grab plate from (0,2).\n\nSo at turn 91, Bob has plate, at (1,2).\n\nThen he can go to pot at (4,0) to serve when ready.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (1,1) move D, to (2,1) move R, to (3,1) move R, to (4,1) move R, turn 92 to 95.\n\nAt (4,1), turn 96 face down, then when soup ready at turn 94, he can interact at turn 96 to get soup, if he is there at turn 96.\n\nSoup ready at 94, so at turn 94, if he is at (4,1) facing down, he can interact.\n\nBut in the sequence, he arrives at (4,1) at turn 95? Let's see:\n\nAfter grab plate at turn 91, at (1,2), ori L (after interact or move? After interact, orientation might be same, but he faced left to interact, so ori L.\n\nTurn 92: move D to (1,1), ori D\n\nTurn 93: move R to (2,1), ori R\n\nTurn 94: move R to (3,1), ori R\n\nTurn 95: move R to (4,1), ori R\n\nAt turn 95, at (4,1), ori R, but need face down for pot.\n\nSoup ready at turn 94, so at turn 95, he can change ori to D and interact.\n\nTurn 95: at (4,1), ori R, he can change to D turn 95, but one action per turn.\n\nTurn 95: move to (4,1), ori R\n\nThen turn 96: change ori to D\n\nTurn 97: interact to get soup from pot.\n\nThen he has soup on plate, need to go to serving counter at (7,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (5,1) move R, to (6,1) move R, to (6,2) move U, face R, interact.\n\nTurn 98: move R to (5,1), ori R\n\nTurn 99: move R to (6,1), ori R\n\nTurn 100: move U to (6,2), ori U\n\nTurn 101: change ori to R\n\nTurn 102: interact to deliver.\n\nDelivered at turn 102.\n\nWith Alice adding onion and Bob getting plate, we can deliver faster.\n\nIn this case, Alice adds onion by turn 89, cooking starts, ready at 94.\n\nBob gets plate by turn 91, then to pot by turn 95, serve at turn 97, deliver at turn 102.\n\nBut Alice is free after turn 89.\n\nAfter adding onion at turn 89, Alice can do other things, like start another soup.\n\nBut for now, let's plan Alice's actions.\n\nFirst, for Alice to add the onion:\n\nTurn 84: Move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 85: Change orientation to U\n\nTurn 86: Interact to pick up onion from (5,2)\n\nTurn 87: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 88: Change orientation to D\n\nTurn 89: Interact to add onion to pot at (4,0)  // cooking starts\n\nNow Alice is at (4,1), holding nothing, ori D.\n\nShe can then go to help with serving or start new soup.\n\nFor example, she can go to get a plate for the next soup or something.\n\nBut since Bob is handling the serving, she can prepare for another soup.\n\nFor instance, she can get an onion from a counter to start cooking at (3,0).\n\nNearest onion counters: (5,2) is now empty, since she took it, or other counters.\n\n(5,2) had onion, she took it, so now empty.\n\nOther onions at (2,2), (6,4), etc.\n\nShe is at (4,1), can move to (5,1), then to (6,1), then to (7,1) kitchen counter with onion, but from (6,1) facing right, she can interact with (7,1) to pick up onion.\n\nThen she can go to (3,1) or something to add to pot (3,0).\n\nBut pot (3,0) is empty.\n\nFirst, get onion.\n\nTurn 90: move R to (5,1), ori R\n\nTurn 91: move R to (6,1), ori R\n\nTurn 92: interact with (7,1) kitchen counter to pick up onion? She is at (6,1), facing east after move, and (7,1) is adjacent east, so she can interact to pick up onion from (7,1), if it has one. Yes, (7,1) has onion.\n\nTurn 92: interact, pick up onion, now holding onion.\n\nThen she can go to (3,1) to add to pot (3,0).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (5,1) move L, to (4,1) move L, to (3,1) move L.\n\nTurn 93: move L to (5,1), ori L\n\nTurn 94: move L to (4,1), ori L\n\nTurn 95: move L to (3,1), ori L\n\nNow at (3,1), facing left, but pot (3,0) is below, so need face down.\n\nTurn 96: change ori to D\n\nTurn 97: interact to add onion to pot (3,0)\n\nNow pot (3,0) has one onion.\n\nNeed two more to start cooking.\n\nBut she can add only one; she needs to get more.\n\nThis is inefficient.\n\nPerhaps after adding the first onion, she can stay or help Bob.\n\nBut since we are planning for Alice, and H might be short, let's set H, the horizon.\n\nThe task says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\", but H is not specified, so I need to choose a reasonable H, say 10 turns or something.\n\nSince cooking takes 5 turns, and serving, H=10 might be short.\n\nFor the answer, we can plan until she adds the onion or something.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we should plan for the sequence to deliver.\n\nBut with Bob helping, it might be faster.\n\nSince we only output Alice's actions, let's plan for Alice to complete the task as much as possible.\n\nFor the first part, Alice adds the onion in 5 actions.\n\nThen she can go get a plate.\n\nFrom turn 89: at (4,1), ori D\n\nTurn 90: move L to (3,1), ori L\n\nTurn 91: move L to (2,1), ori L (assume (2,1) empty)\n\nTurn 92: move L to (1,1), ori L\n\nTurn 93: move U to (1,2), ori U\n\nTurn 94: change ori to L\n\nTurn 95: interact to grab plate from (0,2)\n\nNow she has plate at (1,2).\n\nThen she can go back to pot.\n\nBut soup ready at turn 94, so at turn 95 she is at (1,2) with plate, need to go to (4,1).\n\nTurn 96: move D to (1,1), ori D\n\nTurn 97: move R to (2,1), ori R\n\nTurn 98: move R to (3,1), ori R\n\nTurn 99: move R to (4,1), ori R\n\nTurn 100: change ori to D\n\nTurn 101: interact to get soup from pot\n\nThen to serving counter.\n\nBut Bob might have done it.\n\nTo save, after Alice adds onion, she can wait at (4,1) for the soup to be ready, but she has no plate, so she needs to get plate first.\n\nIn the time, she can get the plate while cooking.\n\nBut from above, she gets plate at turn 95, soup ready at 94, so she misses it by one turn; at turn 94 soup ready, but she is at (1,2) getting plate, so at turn 95 she has plate, but soup is ready since turn 94, so she can go back and serve.\n\nAt turn 95, she has plate, soup ready, she can go to (4,1) and serve.\n\nFrom turn 95: at (1,2) with plate, ori L\n\nTurn 96: move D to (1,1), ori D\n\nTurn 97: move R to (2,1), ori R\n\nTurn 98: move R to (3,1), ori R\n\nTurn 99: move R to (4,1), ori R\n\nTurn 100: change ori to D\n\nTurn 101: interact to get soup\n\nThen deliver.\n\nBut if Bob is getting the plate, Alice can do something else.\n\nSince the task is to plan for Alice, and H is not specified, I'll plan for Alice to add the onion and then start getting the plate, for say 10 turns.\n\nBut let's see the action history.\n\nAlice action history: U, I, R, D, I\n\nMost recent last: I, D, R, I, U\n\nSimilarly Bob: L, L, U, I, R\n\nBut not sure what they were doing.\n\nPerhaps at turn 84, Alice can interact with pot, but since holding nothing, it does nothing, so better to move.\n\nI think the best is for Alice to add the onion as planned.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll output Alice's actions for the next few turns to add the onion.\n\nThen she can continue.\n\nBut to have a complete plan, let's say for H=6 turns.\n\nTurn 84: Move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 85: Change orientation to U\n\nTurn 86: Interact (pick up onion from (5,2))\n\nTurn 87: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 88: Change orientation to D\n\nTurn 89: Interact (add onion to pot)\n\nThen for turn 90 onwards, she can move towards plate dispenser.\n\nBut since H might be small, this might be fine.\n\nWe can include in the plan.\n\nAnother idea: Alice at (4,1) can move down, but can't, so she must move left or right.\n\nPerhaps she can change orientation to face right, then move to (5,1), then interact with (5,2) if she faces up, but same as before.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 84: R\nTurn 85: U  // change orientation to up\nTurn 86: I\nTurn 87: L\nTurn 88: D  // change orientation to down\nTurn 89: I\n}\n\nIn the action set, U can be move or change orientation? No, the actions are separate: Move (L/R/U/D) or Change Orientation (L/R/U/D) or Interact (I) or Stay (S).\n\nIn the list, it's the same symbols, but for change orientation, it's not move, so when we say U, it could be move up or change orientation to up.\n\nIn the action specification, it says:\n\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\n\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one. (This seems misphrased; it should be that change orientation doesn't move, only changes facing.\n\nFrom: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is confusing.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it's poorly worded. Probably it means: Change Orientation changes only the facing, without moving, regardless of adjacent tiles. The \"if\" might be a mistake.\n\nLook: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut for changing orientation, it shouldn't depend on adjacent tiles.\n\nPerhaps it's: when you use Change Orientation action, it only changes orientation, no move, and the condition is for something else.\n\nI think it's a typo or misphrased.\n\nFrom context, Move action changes position and orientation, Change Orientation action changes only orientation, no move.\n\nAnd Interact requires adjacency and facing.\n\nSo for Change Orientation, it just changes facing, no move.\n\nSimilarly, Move changes both.\n\nIn the action list, when we output, for example, \"U\" could be Move U or Change Orientation U, but in the sequence, we need to specify which.\n\nIn the answer format, it says each action \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, L, R, I, S\\}\\), which includes both move and change orientation for U/D/L/R, but it's ambiguous.\n\nProblem: U can mean move up or change orientation to up.\n\nBut in the set, it's the same symbol.\n\nPerhaps we need to infer from context, but it's not clear.\n\nLook at the action history: Alice action history: U, I, R, D, I\n\nFor example, U could be move up or change to up.\n\nBut from position, she is at (4,1), and previous actions.\n\nSimilarly, Bob.\n\nIn the description, it says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThe \"if\" clause is confusing. I think it means that Change Orientation action does not move, only changes orientation, and the \"if\" might be for move action or something.\n\nPerhaps it's: for Move action, if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, you don't move but may change orientation? But not specified.\n\nLet's read: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is messy.\n\nI think for simplicity, in many implementations, Move U means move up if possible, else not, and Change Orientation U means face up without moving.\n\nBut in the action set given, it's {U, D, L, R, I, S}, so U can be both.\n\nIn the sequence, when we say \"U\", it could be move or change orientation.\n\nFrom the context of the action history, we can see.\n\nFor example, Alice action history: U, I, R, D, I\n\nPosition: (4,1)\n\nIf U was move up, from where? But we don't have previous position.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (4,3).\n\nPerhaps for planning, we can use the actions as specified.\n\nTo avoid ambiguity, when we want to change orientation without moving, we use Change Orientation action, which is still U/D/L/R.\n\nIn the sequence, we output the action.\n\nFor Alice at turn 84, to change orientation to up, she uses \"U\" for change orientation, but \"U\" is also for move up.\n\nIn the list, it's the same.\n\nI think we have to use the symbols as given.\n\nFor example, in turn 85, she needs to change orientation to up, so she does Change Orientation U, which is \"U\".\n\nSimilarly for move.\n\nIn the sequence, it's fine.\n\nSo in the plan, for turn 85: U to change orientation to up.\n\nTurn 88: D to change orientation to down.\n\nIn the output, it's \"U\" or \"D\".\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 84: R  // move right to (5,1)\n\nTurn 85: U  // change orientation to up\n\nTurn 86: I  // interact with (5,2) to pick up onion\n\nTurn 87: L  // move left to (4,1)\n\nTurn 88: D  // change orientation to down\n\nTurn 89: I  // interact with pot to add onion\n\nThen for H=6, we can stop here.\n\nIf we want more, she can start moving towards plate dispenser.\n\nBut for the answer, I think this is sufficient.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 84: R\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: I\n\nTurn 87: L\n\nTurn 88: D\n\nTurn 89: I\n\nAnd for the box.\n\nBut in the turn numbers, t1=84, so turn 84 to turn 89.\n\nSince H is not specified, this should be ok.\n\nTo maximize reward, but with this, the soup starts cooking, and reward can be obtained later.\n\nI think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice should focus on adding the final onion to the pot at (4,0) to start cooking the soup, as it currently contains 2 onions and requires one more to begin cooking. Once started, the soup will cook for 5 turns and yield a reward of 20 when served. Alice is positioned at (4,1), facing down, and can efficiently retrieve an onion from the nearby kitchen counter at (5,2) and add it to the pot.\n\n### Plan for Alice (Turns 84 to 89)\n- **Turn 84 (Move R)**: Alice moves right to (5,1), changing her position and orientation to right. This positions her adjacent to the kitchen counter at (5,2) above her.\n- **Turn 85 (Change Orientation U)**: Alice changes orientation to face up, preparing to interact with the kitchen counter at (5,2).\n- **Turn 86 (I)**: Alice interacts with the kitchen counter at (5,2) to pick up the onion, as she is empty-handed and the counter contains an onion. She is now holding an onion.\n- **Turn 87 (Move L)**: Alice moves left to (4,1), changing her position and orientation to left. This positions her adjacent to the pot at (4,0) below her.\n- **Turn 88 (Change Orientation D)**: Alice changes orientation to face down, preparing to interact with the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 89 (I)**: Alice interacts with the pot at (4,0) to add the onion. The pot now has 3 onions, and cooking starts immediately (cooking time: 5 turns; soup ready at turn 94).\n\n### Coordination with Bob\nBob is holding an onion at (4,3) but cannot easily access the pot at (4,0) due to the kitchen counter at (4,2) blocking the path. Instead, Bob can:\n- Place his onion on an empty kitchen counter (e.g., at (3,2)) for later use in another soup.\n- Retrieve a plate from the dispenser at (0,2) during the cooking period (turns 89-94) to prepare for serving the soup at turn 94.\n- Serve the cooked soup by interacting with the pot at (4,0) when ready and delivering it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nThis plan ensures the soup starts cooking quickly, and Alice's actions are optimized for minimal turns. Bob should handle plate retrieval and serving to parallelize tasks and reduce total delivery time.\n\n### Action Sequence for Alice\n\\boxed{\nTurn 84: R \\\\\nTurn 85: U \\\\\nTurn 86: I \\\\\nTurn 87: L \\\\\nTurn 88: D \\\\\nTurn 89: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 88. The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n The only recipe is Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward: 20; cooking time: 5 turns.\n\n Current state:\n - Alice: at (6,1), facing R, holding nothing.\n - Bob: at (3,3), facing U, holding nothing.\n\n There are two pots at (3,0) and (4,0). The pot at (4,0) has 2 onions and is not full (so needs one more onion to start cooking).\n\n There are many onions scattered on kitchen counters (at (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (2,0), (2,2), (0,3), (5,2), (4,2)).\n There is a plate dispenser at (0,2) and a serving counter at (7,2).\n\n Since the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions, we need one more onion to complete the recipe and start cooking.\n\n Possible plan:\n Step 1: Get an onion and put it into the pot at (4,0) to complete the recipe and start cooking.\n Step 2: While the soup is cooking (which will take 5 turns), we can prepare for the next steps (like getting plates and delivering).\n\n However, note that we have two players. We can coordinate.\n\n Let's see the positions:\n - Alice is at (6,1). She can easily go to (7,1) which has an onion on the kitchen counter. She can pick it up and then go to the pot at (4,0) to add the onion.\n   But note: (7,1) is adjacent to (6,1) and she is facing R (right) so (7,1) is to her right? Actually, from (6,1) facing R, the adjacent tile to the right is (7,1). \n   So she can interact with (7,1) to pick up the onion? But note: the kitchen counter at (7,1) is non-empty (has an onion). So if she is at (6,1) and facing R, she is adjacent and facing the counter -> can interact to pick up.\n\n However, let's check the grid: \n   The kitchen counters are at (0,0) to (7,0) and others? Specifically, (7,1) is a kitchen counter and has an onion.\n\n But note: the grid also has walls? The description of the grid is not fully given, but we have the list of kitchen counters. We assume the grid is 8x5? (from the coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4).\n\n Steps for Alice:\n  Turn 88: Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (7,1). But note: she is at (6,1) and facing R -> so the tile to the right is (7,1). So she can do I to pick up the onion.\n\n  Then she needs to go to the pot at (4,0). How to get there? \n    From (6,1) after picking up, she is still at (6,1). Then she must move left (to (5,1)), then down to (5,0)? But note: the tile (5,0) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (5,0) is in the list of kitchen counters. But note: kitchen counters are walkable? The rules say \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and they are non-empty tiles? Actually, the rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But the kitchen counter is a tile that might be empty or occupied. In this case, the kitchen counter at (5,0) is not listed as having an item? The non-empty kitchen counters are listed and (5,0) is not in that list. So we assume it is empty and walkable.\n\n  Alternatively, we can check the list of non-empty kitchen counters: they are at (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (2,0), (2,2), (0,3), (5,2), (4,2). So (5,0) is not listed -> it's empty -> walkable.\n\n  So path for Alice: \n    After picking up the onion at (7,1) at turn 88, she is at (6,1) holding onion.\n    Turn 89: Move left to (5,1)\n    Turn 90: Move down to (5,0) -> now at (5,0)\n    Turn 91: Move left to (4,0) -> but wait, (4,0) is a pot. Can she walk on a pot? The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But the pot at (4,0) is non-empty (has 2 onions). So she cannot step on it. Therefore, she must stand adjacent and facing the pot to interact.\n\n  How to interact with the pot at (4,0) from (5,0)? \n    The pot is at (4,0) and she is at (5,0). The pot is to her left. So she must face left (L) and then interact.\n\n  So:\n    Turn 91: Change orientation to L (so she faces left towards (4,0)) and then interact? But note: we can only do one action per turn.\n\n  Alternatively, we can plan the moves so that she is already facing the right direction when she arrives.\n\n  Let's break down:\n    Turn 88: I (pick up onion from (7,1)) -> now holding onion, still at (6,1), facing R.\n    Turn 89: Move left to (5,1) -> now at (5,1), facing R (orientation doesn't change when moving? The problem says: Move action changes position and orientation? Actually, the move action says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when she moves left, she moves to (5,1) and her orientation becomes L? \n\n  The problem says: \n      \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" \n      and \n      \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" \n\n  So when she moves left, she moves to (5,1) and her orientation becomes left (L). \n\n  Then at turn 90: Move down to (5,0). Now she is at (5,0) and her orientation is down? Because moving down changes orientation to D? \n\n  Actually, the move action simultaneously changes the position and sets the orientation to the direction of the move. So:\n    Turn 89: Move left -> position becomes (5,1) and orientation becomes L.\n    Turn 90: Move down -> position becomes (5,0) and orientation becomes D.\n\n  Now at (5,0), she is facing down (south). The pot at (4,0) is to her left (west). So she needs to face left to interact.\n\n  Turn 91: Change orientation to L (so now facing left, towards (4,0)).\n  Turn 92: Interact (I) to add the onion to the pot.\n\n  Now the pot at (4,0) will have 3 onions and automatically start cooking. The cooking will take 5 turns (so from turn 92, it will be ready at turn 97).\n\n Meanwhile, Bob is at (3,3) facing U. He is holding nothing.\n\n We can have Bob get a plate and then be ready to serve the soup when it's done.\n\n How to get a plate? The plate dispenser is at (0,2). Bob is at (3,3). \n\n Path for Bob:\n   From (3,3) to (0,2):\n     One way: \n        Move left to (2,3) -> but (2,3) is not in the list of kitchen counters? Actually, we don't have a full grid layout, but we know the non-empty kitchen counters. We assume that any tile not listed as a non-empty tile (and not a dispenser, pot, etc.) is empty? Actually, the grid has:\n          - Empty tiles: walkable\n          - The listed dispensers, pots, serving counter, and kitchen counters (which are walkable when empty? but when non-empty, we cannot walk on them?).\n\n        The non-empty kitchen counters are listed, so we know which ones are occupied. The unoccupied kitchen counters are walkable? The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So only the non-empty tiles (which are the ones that are occupied by an item) are blocked? \n\n        The tile (2,3): is it a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters include (0,3) and (2,4) etc. but (2,3) is not in the list of kitchen counter positions? Actually, the list of kitchen counters is fixed: they are at [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (0, 1), (7, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (0, 3), (7, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)]. \n\n        So (2,3) is not a kitchen counter -> it's an empty tile? \n\n        Similarly, (1,3) and (0,3) are kitchen counters. But (0,3) is non-empty (has an onion) -> cannot walk. (2,3) is not a kitchen counter -> empty? \n\n        Actually, the tile types are fixed: the kitchen counter tiles are always there (even when empty). But the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those that have an item (like a dispenser, a pot, a serving counter, or a kitchen counter that has an item). Also, the dispensers and pots and serving counters are fixed and cannot be walked on? \n\n        The problem states: \n          - Dispensers, Pots, Serving Counters, and Kitchen Counters are non-empty tiles? Actually, the rule says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if ...\". And non-empty tiles are those that are not empty tiles? \n\n        But the grid has tile types: \n          - Empty Tile: Walkable space.\n          - Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter: these are non-empty tiles? \n\n        However, the rule for walking: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So all these (dispensers, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter) are non-empty and hence not walkable? \n\n        But wait: the kitchen counter is used for temporary storage and can be empty? Then when empty, is it walkable? The rule doesn't explicitly say. But the problem states: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is a tile type. \n\n        Looking at the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if the kitchen counter is empty, it is not non-empty? Then it is walkable? \n\n        We must assume that the tile types are fixed and only when they have an item they are non-empty? \n\n        The problem says: \"non-empty tile\" meaning a tile that has an item? But the dispensers and pots are always non-empty? \n\n        Actually, the dispensers are always sources and are non-empty? The pots can be empty or not? The serving counter is always there? \n\n        Clarification: \n          - The dispensers, pots, and serving counters are always non-empty (because they are interactive objects) and hence cannot be walked on? \n          - The kitchen counters: when they have an item, they are non-empty and cannot be walked on. When empty, they are walkable? \n\n        The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as tiles that have an item? \n\n        Given the non-empty kitchen counters are listed, we know which kitchen counters are non-empty. The others (kitchen counters without items) are empty? But note: the kitchen counter tile is still a kitchen counter, but without an item, so it might be considered empty? \n\n        However, the rule for interaction: the player must be on an empty tile adjacent to the non-empty tile and facing it. So the player must stand on an empty tile. \n\n        Therefore, we can assume that the kitchen counter, when empty, is not an obstacle? But the player cannot stand on it? Because it's not an empty tile? \n\n        This is ambiguous. But looking at typical Overcooked, counters are walkable? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and the others are non-empty? \n\n        To be safe, let's assume that the only walkable tiles are the empty tiles and the kitchen counters when they are empty? But the problem does not explicitly say kitchen counters are walkable when empty.\n\n        Given the constraints, we must rely on the list of non-empty tiles: the non-empty kitchen counters (with items) are non-empty and cannot be walked on. The empty kitchen counters (without items) are not listed and hence we assume they are walkable? \n\n        Actually, the problem states: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" meaning that they have an item. So the other kitchen counters (without items) are not non-empty? Then they are empty? \n\n        But note: the tile type is still a kitchen counter. The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if a kitchen counter is empty, it is not non-empty -> so it is walkable? \n\n        This is a bit confusing. Let me re-read: \n          \"Non-empty tiles\" are defined by having an item? Or by being a dispenser, pot, etc.?\n\n        The interaction rule: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if ...\". So the tile types that are non-empty: dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters that have an item? \n\n        And for walking: non-empty tiles (meaning the ones that are non-empty by having an item or being a fixed object?) \n\n        The problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and then defines tile types. It does not say that the fixed objects (dispensers, pots, serving counters) are non-empty. But they are not empty tiles? \n\n        We must assume that the fixed objects (dispensers, pots, serving counters) are always non-empty and cannot be walked on. The kitchen counters: when they have an item, they are non-empty and cannot be walked on; when empty, they are walkable? \n\n        However, the problem does not explicitly state that. \n\n        Given the complexity, let's look at the grid and the positions. We have to deliver the soup and we know the positions of the non-empty kitchen counters. We can avoid walking on them.\n\n        For Bob's path from (3,3) to (0,2):\n          (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) is blocked (because (0,3) has an onion). So we cannot go to (0,3). \n          Instead, we can go:\n            (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) -> but (2,2) has an onion (non-empty) -> blocked. \n            (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> but (0,1) is a kitchen counter? It is in the list, but is it non-empty? The non-empty ones are listed: (0,1) is not in the non-empty list? So we assume it's empty? Then walkable? \n\n        The non-empty kitchen counters are: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (2,0), (2,2), (0,3), (5,2), (4,2). \n        So (0,1) is a kitchen counter but not listed as non-empty -> so it's empty -> walkable? \n\n        But note: the kitchen counter at (0,1) is a tile that is a kitchen counter. The rule says we cannot walk on non-empty tiles. Since it's empty, we can walk? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is a tile type. And the rule for walking: non-empty tiles. So if it's empty, it's not non-empty? Then we can walk? \n\n        But in typical Overcooked, you can walk on counters? \n\n        Given the ambiguity, I think we must assume that the fixed objects (dispensers, pots, serving counters) are always non-empty and cannot be walked on. The kitchen counters: if they have an item, they are non-empty and cannot be walked on; if they are empty, they are walkable? \n\n        So Bob can go:\n          (3,3) -> (3,2) [but (3,2) is a kitchen counter? It is in the list of kitchen counters. And is it non-empty? The non-empty list includes (3,2)? No, the non-empty ones are (2,2) and (5,2) and (4,2) and (5,2) -> (3,2) is a kitchen counter but not non-empty -> so empty -> walkable? \n\n        Actually, the non-empty kitchen counters are explicitly listed. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter that is empty -> walkable.\n\n        Then Bob can go:\n          Turn 88: Bob is at (3,3) facing U. \n          To get to (0,2), we can plan:\n            Move left to (2,3) -> orientation becomes L. (turn 88 for Bob? But we are planning for Alice at turn 88, then turn 89, etc. and Bob will also act at each turn? \n\n        However, the problem says: plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob). But the answer format only has one sequence. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" meaning we might need to specify both? But the answer format only has one set of actions per turn. \n\n        Rethink: the problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" and the answer format has a sequence of actions. But it doesn't specify for which player. \n\n        Looking at the answer format: \n          Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n          ...\n\n        And the example in the problem statement only shows one action per turn. \n\n        But note: there are two players. How do we control both? \n\n        The problem says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\" and \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". \n\n        It might be that we are only to plan for Alice, and assume Bob will act independently? But that might not lead to optimal collaboration. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might expect a joint plan? But the answer format does not have two actions per turn. \n\n        Re-examining: the task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice\". So we are to plan only for Alice? But then Bob is controlled by someone else? \n\n        The problem states: \"optimize coordination, planning, and decision-making based on the current game state and action history of both players.\" \n\n        We are to assume we control both? But the answer format doesn't have two actions. \n\n        I think there might be a misunderstanding. The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". The \"optionally\" might mean that we can also plan for Bob if we wish, but the format is for one sequence. \n\n        Given the ambiguity, I will assume we are to plan only for Alice, and we can assume Bob will act in a way that we can predict (or we can assume Bob is also following a plan we set, but we only output Alice's actions). \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be that we are Alice and we are to plan our own actions, and we know Bob's state and history so we can predict Bob? \n\n        The problem does not specify. \n\n        Since the answer format only has one action per turn, I think we are to plan for Alice only. We can assume Bob will act independently and we can predict his actions? \n\n        But we are not given Bob's plan. \n\n        Alternatively, we can assume that Bob is controlled by an identical agent and we are to plan for both? But the output format doesn't allow two actions. \n\n        I think the intended interpretation is that we control both players, but the answer format only requires the actions for Alice? But that doesn't make sense. \n\n        Another possibility: the problem expects a sequence of actions for Alice, and we can describe what Bob should do in words? But the answer format is strict.\n\n        Given the confusion, I will plan for Alice only, and assume that Bob is controlled by the same algorithm and we can coordinate implicitly? \n\n        But note: we are given Bob's current state and history. We can use that to predict Bob's next actions? \n\n        However, the problem doesn't specify Bob's behavior. \n\n        Let me read the problem again: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\". So we are to assume that we can control both? \n\n        The answer format: it only shows one action per turn. \n\n        I think there might be a mistake in the problem. But since we must output in the given format, I will output only Alice's actions. \n\n        And for Bob, we assume he will act optimally? We can suggest a plan for Bob in the reasoning but output only Alice's actions.\n\n        Alternatively, we can plan for Alice and hope Bob does something reasonable? \n\n        Given the time, let's plan for Alice and also suggest what Bob should do.\n\n        Bob should go to get a plate and then be ready to serve the soup at turn 97.\n\n        Steps for Bob (suggested):\n          From (3,3) facing U:\n            Turn 88: Move left to (2,3) -> orientation L.\n            Turn 89: Move left to (1,3) -> orientation L. (But (1,3) is a kitchen counter? It is in the list of kitchen counters? The list: ... (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), ... -> (1,3) is not in the list? So it's not a kitchen counter? Then it's an empty tile? \n            Actually, the kitchen counters are listed at specific positions. (1,3) is not listed -> so it's an empty tile? \n\n            Then turn 90: Move down to (1,2) -> orientation D. (But (1,2) is not in the list of kitchen counters? -> empty)\n            Turn 91: Move left to (0,2) -> but (0,2) is the plate dispenser -> non-empty tile? So he cannot walk on it. Therefore, he must stop at (1,2) and then face left to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\n            Alternatively, he can go:\n              (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (2,2) is non-empty (has an onion) -> blocked. So he must go around? \n              (3,3) -> (3,2) [empty kitchen counter? so walkable] -> then (3,2) to (3,1) -> then (3,1) to (2,1) -> (2,1) is not a kitchen counter? -> empty -> then (1,1) -> (0,1) [kitchen counter, empty? -> walkable] -> then (0,1) to (0,2) is adjacent? But (0,2) is the plate dispenser, so he must stand adjacent and face it.\n\n            How about:\n              Turn 88: Move down to (3,2) -> now at (3,2) and facing D.\n              Turn 89: Move down to (3,1) -> facing D.\n              Turn 90: Move left to (2,1) -> facing L.\n              Turn 91: Move left to (1,1) -> facing L.\n              Turn 92: Move left to (0,1) -> facing L.\n              Now at (0,1), which is adjacent to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to the right? \n                (0,1) and (0,2) are adjacent vertically? Actually, (0,1) is at (x=0, y=1) and (0,2) is at (x=0, y=2) -> so they are adjacent vertically. \n                Bob is at (0,1) and the plate dispenser is at (0,2) which is above? So he needs to face up to interact.\n\n              Turn 93: Change orientation to U (facing up towards (0,2)).\n              Turn 94: Interact (I) to get a plate.\n\n            Then he holds a plate. He needs to go to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup when it's ready (at turn 97). \n\n            Path from (0,1) to (4,0):\n              (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) -> but (3,0) is a pot (non-empty) -> cannot walk. So he must go to (4,0) by standing adjacent? \n\n            How to get to a tile adjacent to (4,0)? \n              Adjacent tiles: (4,1), (3,0) [pot], (5,0) [kitchen counter, empty? -> (5,0) is a kitchen counter and not in non-empty list -> walkable], (4,-1) invalid.\n\n            So he can go to (5,0) or (4,1). \n\n            Let's go to (4,1):\n              From (0,1): \n                Turn 95: Move right to (1,1) -> facing R.\n                Turn 96: Move right to (2,1) -> facing R.\n                Turn 97: Move right to (3,1) -> facing R.\n                Turn 98: Move down to (3,0) -> blocked? (3,0) is a pot -> non-empty -> cannot walk. So we avoid.\n\n            Alternatively, go to (5,0) which is walkable (since not non-empty):\n              From (0,1) to (5,0):\n                (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,0)\n\n            Steps:\n              Turn 95: Move right to (1,1) -> R\n              Turn 96: Move right to (2,1) -> R\n              Turn 97: Move right to (3,1) -> R\n              Turn 98: Move down to (3,0) -> blocked -> cannot.\n\n            We must avoid (3,0). So go:\n              (0,1) -> (0,0) -> but (0,0) is a kitchen counter? It is in the list. Is it non-empty? The non-empty list doesn't include (0,0) -> so empty -> walkable? \n              Then (0,0) -> (1,0) [kitchen counter, empty?] -> (2,0) is non-empty (has an onion) -> blocked. \n\n            Alternatively, from (0,1) go to (1,1) -> (1,0) [kitchen counter, empty?] -> then (2,0) is blocked, so we cannot go that way.\n\n            Another way: go via (4,1):\n              (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> then down to (4,0) is blocked (because (4,0) is a pot). \n\n            So we can only stand at (4,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (4,0)? \n\n            How to get to (4,1):\n              From (0,1): \n                Turn 95: R to (1,1)\n                Turn 96: R to (2,1)\n                Turn 97: R to (3,1)\n                Turn 98: R to (4,1) -> now at (4,1), facing R.\n\n            Then at (4,1), the pot is at (4,0) which is below. So he must face down (D) to interact.\n\n            Turn 99: Change orientation to D.\n            Turn 100: Interact to serve the soup? But only if the soup is ready and he is holding a plate.\n\n            The soup started cooking at turn 92 and takes 5 turns -> ready at turn 97. So at turn 100, it is ready.\n\n        But note: we are only planning for a horizon H. How many turns? We are at turn 88. We can set H to 20? But the problem says \"over next several turns\". We can plan until the soup is delivered.\n\n        However, the problem doesn't specify H. We should plan until Alice has contributed to the goal.\n\n        Since Alice has already put the onion in the pot at turn 92, she can then help with getting another plate or something? But there is only one recipe cooking. \n\n        Alternatively, Alice can also get a plate and be ready to serve? \n\n        But Bob is already getting a plate. We only need one plate per soup.\n\n        So after Alice puts the onion, she can rest? Or help with the next soup? \n\n        There are two pots. The other pot at (3,0) is empty. We can start another soup? \n\n        But the recipe requires 3 onions. There are many onions around. \n\n        So Alice, after putting the onion in the pot at (4,0) at turn 92, can then go to get an onion for the next soup and put it in the pot at (3,0). \n\n        Steps for Alice after turn 92:\n          She is at (5,0) holding nothing (after interacting to put the onion in the pot at (4,0)).\n          She can go to a nearby kitchen counter that has an onion? The closest one: \n            (5,0) is at (5,0). There is an onion at (5,2) and (4,2) and (5,4) and (6,4) and (7,1) but (7,1) was used and now empty? No, we picked the onion at (7,1) at turn 88. But there are many others.\n\n          Let's pick (5,2): \n            From (5,0) to (5,2): \n              Move up to (5,1) -> then up to (5,2). But (5,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty (has an onion) -> so she cannot walk on it. She must stand adjacent and face it to pick up.\n\n          How to get to (5,2) from (5,0):\n            Turn 93: Move up to (5,1) -> orientation U.\n            Turn 94: Change orientation to U (if not already) but she is facing U from the move? Then she can interact with (5,2) which is above? \n              But (5,2) is adjacent to (5,1) and above. So she is at (5,1) facing U -> can interact to pick up the onion at (5,2).\n\n          Turn 94: Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (5,2).\n\n          Then she can take it to the pot at (3,0). How? \n            From (5,1) to (3,0): \n              She is at (5,1). \n              Move left to (4,1) -> then left to (3,1) -> then down to (3,0) blocked. So she must stand adjacent to the pot at (3,0). The adjacent tiles: (3,1) (above), (2,0) (left, but (2,0) is non-empty kitchen counter -> blocked), (4,0) (right, but (4,0) is occupied by the other pot that is cooking), (3,-1) invalid.\n\n            So the only adjacent tile is (3,1). \n\n            Path:\n              Turn 95: Move left to (4,1) -> facing L.\n              Turn 96: Move left to (3,1) -> facing L.\n              Now at (3,1), the pot is at (3,0) below. So she must face down (D) to interact.\n              Turn 97: Change orientation to D.\n              Turn 98: Interact to put the onion in the pot at (3,0). \n\n          Now the pot at (3,0) has 1 onion. It needs 2 more. \n\n        But we are already at turn 98. We can continue, but the horizon might be long.\n\n        Alternatively, we might focus on delivering the first soup and then the second.\n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that we are only required to plan for Alice, we can plan until she puts the onion in the first pot (turn 92) and then stop? But the problem says to maximize the total reward. We should at least plan until she contributes to one delivery? \n\n        However, she has already started the cooking of one soup. The delivery will be done by Bob at around turn 100.\n\n        We can plan for Alice to get a plate and help deliver? But Bob is already doing that.\n\n        Since we are controlling Alice, we can have her get a plate and then go to the serving counter? \n\n        After she puts the onion in the pot at (4,0) at turn 92, she can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate? Then go to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup? But the soup will be ready at turn 97, and she might not get there in time.\n\n        Alternatively, she can get a plate from the dispenser and then wait at the serving counter? But that doesn't help.\n\n        Or, she can get a plate and then serve the soup from the pot? \n\n        How about: \n          After turn 92, Alice is at (5,0). She can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) and then come back to serve the soup at (4,0) when it's ready? \n\n        But the distance: \n          (5,0) -> (5,1) -> ... to (0,2): similar to Bob's path, it would take at least 8 turns? Then she would be late (the soup is ready at turn 97, and she would be at (0,2) at around turn 96, then she has to go back to (4,0) which is 4-5 turns? So she would arrive at turn 100-101).\n\n        Meanwhile, Bob is already on his way to the pot at turn 98. So Bob might serve it first.\n\n        Therefore, to avoid duplication, we can have Alice start a new soup in the other pot.\n\n        Given the above, I will plan for Alice until she puts the onion in the first pot (turn 92) and then have her start gathering onions for the next soup. But we must output a sequence of actions for Alice.\n\n        How many turns? Let's say we plan for 10 turns: from turn 88 to turn 97 (10 actions: turns 88 to 97 inclusive is 10 turns? 88,89,...,97 -> 10 turns).\n\n        But turn 88 is the first action.\n\n        Alternatively, we can plan until she has put the onion in the pot.\n\n        Steps for Alice (turns 88 to 92):\n          Turn 88: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (7,1) -> now holding onion, at (6,1), facing R.\n          Turn 89: Move left to (5,1) -> now at (5,1), facing L (because moved left).\n          Turn 90: Move down to (5,0) -> now at (5,0), facing D.\n          Turn 91: Change orientation to L (to face left towards (4,0)) -> now facing L.\n          Turn 92: Interact (I) to put the onion in the pot at (4,0).\n\n        Then we stop? But we can plan more to be efficient.\n\n        The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns\". We can plan for a few more.\n\n        After turn 92, she is at (5,0), facing L, holding nothing.\n\n        She can go to pick up another onion from a nearby counter, say (5,2) which is above.\n\n          Turn 93: Move up to (5,1) -> facing U (because moved up).\n          Turn 94: Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (5,2) -> now holding onion. (Because (5,2) is above (5,1) and she is facing U -> adjacent and facing, so can interact)\n\n        Then she can go to the pot at (3,0) to put this onion? \n          From (5,1) to (3,1) (adjacent to the pot at (3,0)): \n            Turn 95: Move left to (4,1) -> facing L.\n            Turn 96: Move left to (3,1) -> facing L.\n            Turn 97: Change orientation to D (to face down towards the pot at (3,0)).\n            Turn 98: Interact (I) to put the onion.\n\n        This is 11 actions (turns 88 to 98). But the problem doesn't specify H.\n\n        Alternatively, we can plan for 10 turns (from turn 88 to 97) and then stop.\n\n        Let's do 10 turns: turns 88 to 97.\n\n        So the actions for Alice:\n\n        Turn 88: I\n        Turn 89: L (move left)\n        Turn 90: D (move down)\n        Turn 91: L (change orientation to left) [but note: the action L can be a move or an orientation change? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"]\n\n        How to specify a pure orientation change? The problem lists the actions as U, D, L, R, I, S. \n\n        For a pure orientation change (without moving), we use the same letter? But the problem distinguishes by the effect: if you do L and the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then you don't move and only change orientation? \n\n        But in this case, at turn 91: Alice is at (5,0) and wants to face left. The adjacent tile to the left is (4,0) which is a pot (non-empty) -> so she cannot move left. Therefore, if she does L, it will be an orientation change only.\n\n        So we can use:\n\n          Turn 91: L  (which will change her orientation to left without moving)\n\n        Then turn 92: I to interact.\n\n        Then turn 93: U (move up to (5,1)) -> becomes facing U.\n        Turn 94: I (interact with (5,2) above to pick up onion)\n        Turn 95: L (move left to (4,1)) -> becomes facing L.\n        Turn 96: L (move left to (3,1)) -> becomes facing L.\n        Turn 97: D (to change orientation to down, because we cannot move down from (3,1) since (3,0) is non-empty? So it will be an orientation change only)\n\n        But we want to put the onion in the pot at (3,0) at turn 98, which is beyond 97.\n\n        So for 10 turns (88 to 97), we have:\n\n          Turn 88: I\n          Turn 89: L (move left to (5,1))\n          Turn 90: D (move down to (5,0))\n          Turn 91: L (change orientation to left)\n          Turn 92: I (put onion in pot)\n          Turn 93: U (move up to (5,1))\n          Turn 94: I (pick up onion from (5,2))\n          Turn 95: L (move left to (4,1))\n          Turn 96: L (move left to (3,1))\n          Turn 97: D (change orientation to down, to prepare for interacting with the pot at (3,0))\n\n        Then at turn 98, she can interact to put the onion.\n\n        But we are only outputting up to turn 97.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output fewer turns? Or more? \n\n        Since the problem says \"several turns\", 10 turns is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the soup in the first pot (at (4,0)) is cooking and will be ready at turn 97. At turn 97, Bob might be at (4,1) or on his way? \n\n        We are not controlling Bob, so we hope he delivers it.\n\n        This plan for Alice: she has started one soup and is about to put the first onion in the second pot.\n\n        We are maximizing the total reward: one soup will be delivered (by Bob) and the second soup is started.\n\n        So the actions for Alice from turn 88 to turn 97 (10 actions) are as above.\n\n        However, we must ensure that the actions are valid at each step.\n\n        Let me verify:\n\n          Turn 88: Alice at (6,1) facing R. Interact (I) with (7,1) to pick up onion -> valid, becomes holding onion.\n          Turn 89: Move left to (5,1): valid? The tile (5,1) is empty? We assume so. And she can move left from (6,1) to (5,1). Now at (5,1), orientation L.\n          Turn 90: Move down to (5,0): valid? (5,0) is a kitchen counter but empty -> walkable. Now at (5,0), orientation D.\n          Turn 91: Change orientation: she does L. Since the adjacent tile to the left (4,0) is non-empty, she doesn't move and changes orientation to L. Now at (5,0), facing L.\n          Turn 92: Interact: she is at (5,0), facing L, and (4,0) is adjacent and to her left. She is holding an onion. The pot at (4,0) has 2 onions and is not full -> she can add. Now the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking. She is now holding nothing.\n          Turn 93: Move up to (5,1): valid? (5,1) is empty? Yes. Now at (5,1), orientation U (because moved up).\n          Turn 94: Interact: she is at (5,1), facing U, and the kitchen counter at (5,2) is above. It has an onion -> she can pick it up? Yes, if she is empty-handed. Now she holds an onion.\n          Turn 95: Move left to (4,1): valid? (4,1) is empty? We assume so. Now at (4,1), orientation L (because moved left).\n          Turn 96: Move left to (3,1): valid? (3,1) is empty? We assume so. Now at (3,1), orientation L.\n          Turn 97: Change orientation to D: since the adjacent tile below (3,0) is non-empty, she doesn't move and changes orientation to D. Now facing down.\n\n        Then at turn 98, she can interact to put the onion in the pot at (3,0).\n\n        This seems valid.\n\n        But note: at turn 94, when she interacts with (5,2), is (5,2) a non-empty tile? Yes, it has an onion. And she is adjacent and facing it -> valid.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence for Alice:\n\n        Turn 88: I\n        Turn 89: L\n        Turn 90: D\n        Turn 91: L\n        Turn 92: I\n        Turn 93: U\n        Turn 94: I\n        Turn 95: L\n        Turn 96: L\n        Turn 97: D\n\n        We output for turns 88 to 97.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we start at turn 88.\n\n        So:\n\n        Turn 88: I\n        Turn 89: L\n        Turn 90: D\n        Turn 91: L\n        Turn 92: I\n        Turn 93: U\n        Turn 94: I\n        Turn 95: L\n        Turn 96: L\n        Turn 97: D\n\n        However, the horizon H: we have planned for 10 turns (t=88 to 97, which is 10 actions).\n\n        We hope that Bob will deliver the first soup and then they can work on the second.\n\n        This plan maximizes the reward by starting two soups.\n\n        Let me check if there's a faster way? \n\n        Alternatively, after putting the onion in the first pot, Alice could go to the plate dispenser to get a plate and then serve the first soup? But she would be late. \n\n        But if she does that, she might be able to serve the soup at turn 97? Let's see:\n\n          After turn 92: at (5,0) holding nothing.\n          Turn 93: Move up to (5,1)\n          Turn 94: Move up to (5,2) -> blocked? (5,2) is non-empty -> cannot. So she must go around? \n          Instead, she can go:\n            (5,0) -> (6,0) [kitchen counter, empty?] -> (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (5,2) is non-empty -> cannot walk. \n\n          Alternatively, go to the plate dispenser via:\n            (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> then to (0,2) by facing up and interacting? \n\n          It would take at least 7 turns to get to (0,1) and then one turn to face up and one to interact -> 9 turns to get the plate at turn 101? Then go back to (4,0) -> at least 4 turns -> turn 105. \n\n          The soup is ready at turn 97, so it would be late.\n\n        Therefore, it's better to start the next soup.\n\n        So the plan is as above.\n\n        We output the actions for Alice from turn 88 to 97.\n\n        Note: we assume Bob is doing his part to get the plate and serve the first soup.\n\n        Final answer:\n\n        \\boxed{\n        Turn 88: I\n        Turn 89: L\n        Turn 90: D\n        Turn 91: L\n        Turn 92: I\n        Turn 93: U\n        Turn 94: I\n        Turn 95: L\n        Turn 96: L\n        Turn 97: D\n        }\n\n        But wait, the action history for Alice: \n          Action History: I, R, D, I, R\n\n        The most recent action is the last one: R (at turn 87). Then at turn 88, we are planning.\n\n        The plan starts at turn 88.\n\n        We have 10 actions.\n\n        We hope this is acceptable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should coordinate to complete the partially filled pot at (4,0) by adding the missing onion, start cooking the soup, and then initiate a second soup in the empty pot at (3,0). The current state shows the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions and needs 1 more to start cooking (which takes 5 turns). Alice is positioned near a kitchen counter with an onion at (7,1), and Bob is closer to the plate dispenser at (0,2). The plan focuses on Alice gathering onions for both pots, while Bob is expected to fetch a plate and serve the first soup when ready.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 88–97):\n- **Turn 88 (I)**: Alice interacts with (7,1) to pick up the onion (adjacent and facing right).\n- **Turn 89 (L)**: Moves left to (5,1), orientation updates to left.\n- **Turn 90 (D)**: Moves down to (5,0), orientation updates to down.\n- **Turn 91 (L)**: Changes orientation to left (to face pot at (4,0)) without moving (adjacent tile blocked).\n- **Turn 92 (I)**: Interacts to add onion to pot at (4,0). Pot now has 3 onions and starts cooking (ready at turn 97).\n- **Turn 93 (U)**: Moves up to (5,1), orientation updates to up.\n- **Turn 94 (I)**: Interacts with (5,2) to pick up onion (adjacent above and facing up).\n- **Turn 95 (L)**: Moves left to (4,1), orientation updates to left.\n- **Turn 96 (L)**: Moves left to (3,1), orientation updates to left.\n- **Turn 97 (D)**: Changes orientation to down (to face pot at (3,0)) without moving (adjacent tile blocked). Prepares to add onion to the second pot on the next turn.\n\n### Coordination with Bob:\n- **Bob's Expected Role**: \n  - Fetch a plate from (0,2) and position near (4,0) by turn 97 to serve the first soup (e.g., move to (4,1) and face down).\n  - Serve the soup at turn 97+ when cooked, earning 20 reward.\n- **Alice's Follow-up**: After turn 97, Alice will add the onion to pot (3,0) (turn 98), starting a second soup. Both players can then gather more onions/plates for additional recipes.\n\nThis plan starts one soup immediately and initiates a second, leveraging existing ingredients. Alice uses efficient paths and interactions, while Bob handles serving to maximize reward potential.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn 88: I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 89: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 90: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 91: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 92: I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 93: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 94: I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 95: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 96: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 97: D}\n}",

The goal is to maximize the total reward by delivering soup recipes.\n\nKey elements from the game state:\n- Alice is at (6,2), facing Up, holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (2,3), facing Left, holding one onion.\n- There are onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4), and a plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- Pots at (3,0) and (4,0). The pot at (4,0) has 2 onions and 0 tomatoes (so it needs one more onion to start cooking).\n- Serving counter at (7,2).\n- There are several kitchen counters with onions, but note that the pot at (4,0) only needs one more onion to be full and start cooking.\n\nRecipe 1: 3 onions -> reward 20, cooking time 5 turns.\n\nSince the pot at (4,0) already has 2 onions, adding one more onion will start the cooking. The cooking time is 5 turns, so we can plan to serve it after 5 turns.\n\nAlice is at (6,2) and Bob is at (2,3). Bob is holding an onion and is near the pot at (4,0)? Let's see the positions:\n\n- Bob is at (2,3). The pot at (4,0) is two steps right and three steps down? Actually, (2,3) to (4,0): \n  - x: 2 to 4 (right 2 steps)\n  - y: 3 to 0 (down 3 steps)\n\nBut note that Bob is facing left. He can move to (1,3) if that is empty? But we need to see the layout.\n\nLooking at the kitchen counters: they are at specific positions. We know that the grid is 8x5? (from the coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 4). But we don't have a full map, only the non-empty tiles.\n\nWe know that (6,2) is a kitchen counter? No, the kitchen counters are listed at: \n  [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (0,1), (7,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (0,3), (7,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)]\n\nSo:\n- Alice is at (6,2): this is not a kitchen counter (because kitchen counters are at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) in y=2? Actually, (6,2) is not in the list). So (6,2) is an empty tile? We can assume that any tile not in the non-empty list is empty.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (2,3): (2,3) is not a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters at y=3 are (0,3) and (7,3). So (2,3) is empty.\n\nNow, the pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). How can Bob get there? From (2,3) to (4,0):\n  - He can go down to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty, so occupied by an item) -> cannot walk on. \n  - Alternatively, he can go right to (3,3) -> is (3,3) empty? It's not in the kitchen counter list -> so empty? Then down to (3,2) -> but (3,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot walk on.\n\nSo Bob cannot go directly down from (2,3) to (4,0) because the path is blocked by kitchen counters? Let's see the map:\n\nWe can sketch a grid:\n\nRow y=4: [K, K, K, Onion, Onion, K, K, K]  -> K at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) and Onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4) (but dispensers are non-empty tiles, so we cannot walk on them? Actually, dispensers are walkable? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and dispensers are non-empty? So no, we cannot walk on dispensers.\n\nBut note: the rules say \"non-empty tiles\" meaning tiles that are not empty? The tile types are: empty, dispenser, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter. Only empty tiles are walkable? Actually, the rules state:\n\n- **Empty Tile:** Walkable space.\n- **Dispensers:** Sources for items (tomato/onion/clean plate). -> non-empty? So not walkable?\n- **Pot:** Cooks soup -> non-empty? Not walkable?\n- **Serving Counter:** Deliver cooked soup -> non-empty? Not walkable?\n- **Kitchen Counter:** Temporary item storage -> non-empty? Not walkable?\n\nSo only empty tiles are walkable? Then the entire grid is not walkable? That can't be. Actually, the rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning that non-empty tiles (which are the ones that are not empty) are obstacles. So empty tiles are walkable, and non-empty tiles (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are obstacles.\n\nBut note: the kitchen counter is non-empty only when it has an item? Actually, the tile type is \"Kitchen Counter\", which is a non-empty tile? Or is it that the tile is a kitchen counter and then it becomes non-empty when an item is placed? The rules say: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and in the non-empty kitchen counter list we have specific ones that have items.\n\nBut the problem states: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" meaning that they have items. So what about the tile itself? The tile is of type \"Kitchen Counter\" and is always non-empty? Or is it that the tile is a counter and then becomes non-empty when an item is placed? The rules don't specify.\n\nLooking at the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and the tile types. The dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are all non-empty tiles? Or are they only non-empty when they contain something?\n\nThis is critical. The problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and then lists \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" for those that have items. So I think the tile itself is of type \"Kitchen Counter\" and is always present (so non-empty in the sense of being a counter) and hence not walkable? But then the grid would be very sparse.\n\nAlternatively, the kitchen counter tile is a type of tile that is non-empty only when it has an item? But the problem lists the kitchen counters that are non-empty (i.e., have items). So the others (kitchen counters without items) are not listed? But the tile type list says \"Kitchen Counter\" as a tile type. So I think the kitchen counter is a fixed tile that is always there and is non-empty (so obstacle) regardless of whether it has an item or not.\n\nBut then how do we get to the pots? The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). They are non-empty? So we cannot walk on them. But we can interact with them from adjacent tiles.\n\nTherefore, the players can only walk on empty tiles and must be adjacent to non-empty tiles to interact.\n\nGiven that, let's see the path for Bob from (2,3) to near the pot at (4,0).\n\nThe pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). To interact with it, Bob must be on an adjacent empty tile and face the pot. The adjacent tiles to (4,0) are:\n  - (4,1) [below] -> is (4,1) empty? We don't have any non-empty tile at (4,1) in the lists? So it is empty? \n  - (3,0) and (5,0) are pots and kitchen counters? (3,0) is a pot and (5,0) is a kitchen counter? The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). The kitchen counters at (5,0). So (3,0) and (4,0) are non-empty, and (5,0) is non-empty.\n\nSo the only adjacent empty tile to (4,0) is (4,1). So Bob must be at (4,1) and face up to interact with the pot.\n\nSimilarly, the adjacent tiles to (4,1) are (4,0) [above] and (4,2) [below]? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) so not walkable. So (4,1) is only accessible from the sides? Let's see:\n\nTo get to (4,1):\n  - From the left: (3,1) -> is (3,1) empty? Not in non-empty list -> empty.\n  - From the right: (5,1) -> is (5,1) empty? Not in non-empty list -> empty.\n\nBut how to get to (3,1) or (5,1)? \n  - (3,1): adjacent to (3,0) [pot] and (3,2) [kitchen counter] -> so (3,1) is surrounded by non-empty? Then it's isolated? Similarly, (5,1): adjacent to (5,0) [kitchen counter] and (5,2) [kitchen counter] -> so also isolated?\n\nThis suggests that (4,1) might be inaccessible? That doesn't make sense. Perhaps I have the y-coordinates wrong? The rules say D decreases y? So (x, y-1) for down.\n\nBut the pot at (4,0) is at the bottom? Then (4,1) would be above (4,0)? But then (4,1) is adjacent to (4,0) and (4,2). And (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. So (4,1) is only accessible from the left or right? But (3,1) and (5,1) must be empty? But how to get to (3,1)? \n\nFrom Bob's position (2,3):\n  - He can go right to (3,3) -> empty? Then down to (3,2)? -> but (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so cannot go down. So he cannot get to (3,1) from above because (3,2) is blocking.\n\nSimilarly, from the other side? (5,1) is surrounded by non-empty.\n\nAlternatively, the pot at (4,0) might be accessible from (3,0) or (5,0) but those are non-empty? No, we cannot stand on them.\n\nWait, the rules say: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo the adjacent tile must be empty and adjacent to the non-empty tile. For the pot at (4,0), the adjacent empty tiles are:\n  - (4,1) [if we consider the grid as y increasing upward? But the move: D is (x, y-1) -> so down decreases y. So (4,0) is at the bottom? Then (4,1) is above? Then the tile above (4,0) is (4,1) and the tile below doesn't exist? Or y=0 is the bottom? Then (4,1) is above (4,0). The adjacent tiles are:\n      North: (4,1)\n      South: (4,-1) -> invalid\n      East: (5,0) -> kitchen counter (non-empty) -> so not empty\n      West: (3,0) -> pot (non-empty) -> not empty\n\nSo the only adjacent empty tile is (4,1). Therefore, the player must be at (4,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). But is (4,1) accessible?\n\nTo get to (4,1):\n  - From the left: (3,1) -> but how to get to (3,1)? \n      - (3,1) is adjacent to (3,0) [pot] and (3,2) [kitchen counter] -> so the only access is from (4,1) or (2,1) or (3,0) or (3,2) but the last two are non-empty. So we need to get to (3,1) from the left or right? \n      - (2,1): is it empty? Not in non-empty list -> empty? Then we can go from (2,1) to (3,1)? But how to get to (2,1)? \n          - From (2,0): kitchen counter -> non-empty\n          - From (2,2): kitchen counter -> non-empty\n          - So (2,1) is surrounded? Then inaccessible.\n\nSimilarly, from the right: (5,1) is surrounded by non-empty.\n\nTherefore, the pot at (4,0) is inaccessible? That can't be. There must be a way.\n\nPerhaps the grid is larger? Or maybe I have the coordinates wrong. The kitchen counters are at (0,0) to (7,0) at the bottom? And then at (0,1) and (7,1) at the next row? Then at y=2: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) -> so the middle of row y=2 has counters? Then row y=3: only (0,3) and (7,3) at the sides? And row y=4: counters on the sides and the onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4).\n\nSo the center of the grid might be walkable? For example, at y=3, we have (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) are empty? Because only (0,3) and (7,3) are non-empty.\n\nSimilarly, at y=1: we have (0,1) and (7,1) non-empty, so (1,1) to (6,1) are empty? \n\nBut then we can go from (2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,2)? -> but (4,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter) -> cannot go down to (4,2). So to get to (4,1), we need to go from the sides? For example, from (4,3) we can go down to (4,2) is blocked, so we go right to (5,3) then down to (5,2) is blocked? Or left to (3,3) then down? blocked.\n\nAlternatively, we go to (3,3) then to (3,2) is blocked. So we cannot get to row y=1? \n\nBut then how can we access the pots at (3,0) and (4,0)? They are at the bottom. The only adjacent empty tile for (4,0) is (4,1). And for (4,1) we can access from (4,2) but (4,2) is non-empty. So it seems impossible.\n\nThis suggests a misunderstanding. Perhaps the kitchen counters at (3,2) and (4,2) are at y=2, and we can be at (3,1) and (4,1) and then move up/down between y=1 and y=2? But we cannot because (3,2) and (4,2) are at y=2 and are non-empty, so the tile above them at y=1? (3,1) and (4,1) are empty? Then how to get to (4,1)? \n\nFrom (4,3) [empty] we can move down to (4,2) is blocked by a kitchen counter? So we cannot. \n\nUnless the kitchen counters are not obstacles? But the rules say non-empty tiles are obstacles. And a kitchen counter is a non-empty tile? Or is it that the kitchen counter is a type of tile that is walkable when empty? But the rules don't say that.\n\nLooking back at the rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and then the tile types. The dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are always non-empty? Or only when they have an item? \n\nThe problem says: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" for the ones that have an item. This implies that there are kitchen counters that are empty? And therefore walkable? But the rules say \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" which suggests it is a fixed tile. \n\nI think the intended meaning is that the kitchen counter is a fixed tile that is always present (so non-empty in the sense of being a counter) and hence not walkable. But then the grid is fragmented.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that only the tiles that are listed as \"non-empty\" (in the sense of having an item) are obstacles? But that doesn't match the rules. The rules say non-empty tiles are obstacles, and non-empty tiles are any tile that is not an empty tile? And empty tiles are only the ones that are not dispensers, pots, serving counters, or kitchen counters? \n\nSo the kitchen counters are always non-empty (even if they don't have an item) because they are counters? And therefore obstacles. \n\nBut then the pot at (4,0) is inaccessible. That doesn't make sense for gameplay.\n\nAlternatively, the only non-empty tiles that are obstacles are those that are occupied by an item? But the rules don't say that. The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and then define tile types.\n\nTo resolve, let's look at the action history and positions.\n\nAlice's action history: I, R, U, I, I -> and she is at (6,2) facing U. She must have been at (6,2) and interacted with something? The last action was 'I' and then before that 'I', then 'U', then 'R', then 'I'. \n\nBob's action history: L, U, I, D, L -> and he is at (2,3) facing L.\n\nGiven the complexity, I will assume that the only walkable tiles are the ones that are not in the list of non-empty tile types (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) and not blocked by items? But the rules say the non-empty tiles (which are these fixed types) are obstacles.\n\nBut then the grid has walkable tiles only at positions not in the kitchen counter list, not a dispenser, not a pot, not a serving counter.\n\nIn our case, the walkable tiles are:\n\nFor y=0: only the pots and kitchen counters -> no walkable.\ny=1: (0,1) and (7,1) are non-empty -> so walkable at (1,1) to (6,1)?\ny=2: kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) -> so walkable at (0,2)? but (0,2) is the plate dispenser -> non-empty. (1,2), (6,2), (7,2) -> (7,2) is serving counter -> non-empty. So only (1,2) and (6,2) might be walkable? But (6,2) is where Alice is, so it must be walkable.\n\nAlice is at (6,2) and it is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters at y=2 are (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2). So (6,2) is not a kitchen counter? And not a dispenser (plate dispenser is at (0,2)), not a pot (pots are at (3,0) and (4,0)), not a serving counter (at (7,2)). So (6,2) is empty? -> walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is not in any non-empty list -> walkable.\n\nSo to access the pot at (4,0), we need to be at (4,1). (4,1) is not in any non-empty list -> walkable. How to get to (4,1)? \n  - From (4,2): (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so we cannot walk from (4,2) to (4,1) because we would have to be on (4,2) to move down? But we can't stand on (4,2). \n  - From (3,1): if we can get to (3,1), then to (4,1). (3,1) is not in non-empty list -> walkable. How to get to (3,1)? \n      - From (3,0): non-empty -> can't.\n      - From (3,2): non-empty -> can't.\n      - From (2,1): walkable? -> not in non-empty list -> yes.\n      - From (4,1): already our target.\n\nSo how to get to (2,1)? \n  - (2,1) is not in non-empty list -> walkable.\n  - Adjacent: \n        north: (2,2) -> kitchen counter (non-empty) -> can't go north.\n        south: (2,0) -> kitchen counter (non-empty) -> can't go south.\n        east: (3,1) -> walkable.\n        west: (1,1) -> walkable? (1,1) is not in non-empty list -> walkable.\n\nThen (1,1) is walkable. How to get to (1,1)? \n  - From (1,0): kitchen counter -> can't.\n  - From (1,2): not in non-empty list -> walkable.\n  - From (0,1): kitchen counter -> can't.\n  - From (2,1): already considered.\n\nSo (1,2) is walkable. How to get to (1,2)? \n  - (1,2) is not in non-empty list -> walkable.\n  - Adjacent: \n        north: (1,3) -> walkable? not in non-empty -> yes.\n        south: (1,1) -> already considered.\n        east: (2,2) -> non-empty -> can't.\n        west: (0,2) -> plate dispenser -> non-empty -> can't.\n\nSo we can get to (1,2) from (1,3) or (1,1). \n\nNow, (1,3) is walkable? -> not in non-empty list -> yes. And (1,3) is adjacent to (1,2) and (1,4) -> (1,4) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. Also (0,3) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. (2,3) is walkable -> so (1,3) is accessible from (2,3) by moving left.\n\nTherefore, Bob can go from (2,3) to (1,3) to (1,2) to (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1). \n\nThat's 6 moves. But then he can interact with the pot at (4,0) by facing down.\n\nHowever, Bob is holding an onion. He can add it to the pot at (4,0) which already has 2 onions. That will make it full and start cooking. The cooking time for 3 onions is 5 turns.\n\nBut we are at turn 91. If we start cooking at turn 91 + (time for Bob to move to (4,1)) -> which is at least 6 turns (turn 97), then the soup will be ready at turn 97 + 5 = turn 102.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice is at (6,2) and can help by getting a plate and then serving the soup.\n\nPlate dispenser is at (0,2). Alice is at (6,2). How to get to (0,2)? \n  - The walkable tiles in row y=2: (1,2) and (6,2) are walkable, but between them? (2,2) to (5,2) are kitchen counters -> non-empty, so we cannot walk through. So Alice cannot go from (6,2) to (0,2) along y=2.\n\nAlternative paths: \n  - Go to (6,3) -> walkable? not in non-empty list -> yes. Then to (6,4) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty, can't. \n  - Go to (7,2) -> serving counter -> non-empty, can't.\n  - Go to (6,1) -> walkable? not in non-empty -> yes. Then to (6,0) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty, can't.\n  - Go to (5,2) -> kitchen counter -> can't.\n\nSo Alice is trapped at (6,2) and (6,3)? Let's see:\n\nFrom (6,2):\n  - North: (6,3) -> empty? -> walkable.\n  - South: (6,1) -> empty? -> walkable.\n  - East: (7,2) -> serving counter -> non-empty -> can't.\n  - West: (5,2) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> can't.\n\nSo Alice can go to (6,3) or (6,1).\n\n(6,3) is walkable. From (6,3):\n  - North: (6,4) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> can't.\n  - South: (6,2) -> already there.\n  - East: (7,3) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> can't.\n  - West: (5,3) -> walkable? not in non-empty -> yes.\n\nSo Alice can go west to (5,3). Then from (5,3):\n  - North: (5,4) -> kitchen counter (non-empty) -> can't.\n  - South: (5,2) -> kitchen counter -> can't.\n  - East: (6,3) -> already there.\n  - West: (4,3) -> walkable? -> not in non-empty -> yes.\n\nSo Alice can go to (4,3). Then to (3,3), (2,3) -> but (2,3) is where Bob was, and it's walkable.\n\nFrom (2,3), she can go to (1,3) -> walkable, then to (1,2) -> walkable, then to (1,1) -> walkable, then to (2,1) -> walkable, then to (3,1) -> walkable, then to (4,1) -> walkable. Then she is at (4,1).\n\nBut this is a long path: from (6,2) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (2,3) to (1,3) to (1,2) to (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1) -> 11 moves.\n\nAlternatively, from (6,2) she can go south to (6,1) -> then west to (5,1) -> walkable? (5,1) not in non-empty -> yes. Then west to (4,1). That's shorter: \n  - (6,2) -> D to (6,1) [1 move]\n  - then L to (5,1) [2 moves]\n  - then L to (4,1) [3 moves]\n\nSo only 3 moves to get to (4,1) from (6,2).\n\nBut is (5,1) walkable? We have non-empty at (5,0) [kitchen counter] and (5,2) [kitchen counter], but (5,1) is not listed -> so empty and walkable. Similarly, (4,1) is walkable.\n\nSo Alice can get to (4,1) in 3 moves.\n\nNow, at (4,1), she can face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). But currently, the pot only has 2 onions. After Bob adds his onion, it will have 3 and start cooking. Then after 5 turns, it will be cooked.\n\nAlice could also get a plate to serve the soup. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). From (4,1), how to get to (0,2)? \n  - First, go to (4,1) -> (4,2) is blocked, so she must go to (3,1) or (5,1). \n  - Let's go to (3,1) -> then (2,1) -> then (1,1) -> then (1,2) -> then (0,2) is the plate dispenser? But (0,2) is non-empty, so she must be adjacent and facing it. The adjacent empty tile to (0,2) is (0,1)? -> kitchen counter (non-empty) -> not walkable. Or (0,3) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty. Or (1,2) -> which is walkable. So she can be at (1,2) and face west to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (1,2): \n  - (4,1) -> U to (4,2) is blocked, so she must go west: \n        (4,1) -> L to (3,1) [1 move]\n        (3,1) -> L to (2,1) [2]\n        (2,1) -> U to (2,2) is blocked, so she must go west: (2,1) -> L to (1,1) [3]\n        (1,1) -> U to (1,2) [4]\n\nThen at (1,2), she can face west and interact to get a plate.\n\nThen she needs to bring the plate back to (4,1) to serve the soup.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (4,1):\n        (1,2) -> D to (1,1) [1]\n        (1,1) -> R to (2,1) [2]\n        (2,1) -> R to (3,1) [3]\n        (3,1) -> R to (4,1) [4]\n\nThen at (4,1), face down and interact to serve.\n\nBut the soup might not be ready yet.\n\nAlternatively, after the soup is cooked, Alice can serve it from (4,1) with a plate.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. Bob should move to (4,1) and add his onion to the pot at (4,0). This will start the cooking.\n   - Bob's current position: (2,3) facing Left.\n   - Path: (2,3) -> move Right to (3,3) [1]\n           (3,3) -> move Down to (3,2) is blocked, so he must go Down to (3,3) is already there? \n   We need to go down to (3,2) is blocked, so we go around? We established earlier that he can go to (1,3) then (1,2) then (1,1) then (2,1) then (3,1) then (4,1). But that's 5 moves from (2,3) to (4,1).\n\n   But there's a shorter way? From (2,3) to (3,3) is one move, then to (4,3) [2], then to (4,2) is blocked, then down? no. \n   From (4,3) he can go down to (4,2) is blocked. \n   So the only way is the long path.\n\n   However, we have a kitchen counter at (2,2) and (3,2) blocking the way. So he must take the path via (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) -> 5 moves.\n\n   Steps for Bob:\n        Turn 91: R (to (3,3))\n        Turn 92: L (orientation change to face left? But he needs to move down? But (3,2) is blocked. He must move west to (2,3) is not helpful. So he must go to (4,3) is not helpful. \n        Instead, from (2,3) -> move Left to (1,3) [1 move]\n        Turn 91: L (from (2,3) to (1,3)) [now at (1,3), facing left?]\n        Turn 92: D (to (1,2)) [now at (1,2), facing down?]\n        Turn 93: D (to (1,1)) [now at (1,1), facing down]\n        Turn 94: R (to (2,1)) [now at (2,1), facing right]\n        Turn 95: R (to (3,1)) [now at (3,1), facing right]\n        Turn 96: R (to (4,1)) [now at (4,1), facing right]\n\n   Then at turn 97: he can face down and interact. But he is facing right, so he needs to change orientation to down. \n        Turn 97: D (change orientation to down) -> then he is at (4,1) facing down, then interact.\n\n   But interact requires facing the pot. So after moving to (4,1), he is facing right. He must face down to interact. So:\n        Turn 97: D (change orientation to down)\n        Turn 98: I (interact to add onion)\n\n   So at turn 98, the onion is added. The pot starts cooking at turn 98. It will be ready at turn 98 + 5 = turn 103.\n\n2. Meanwhile, Alice can get a plate and be ready to serve at turn 103.\n\n   Alice is at (6,2) at turn 91.\n   She can go to (4,1) in 3 moves as discussed:\n        Turn 91: D (to (6,1)) [facing down? then she is at (6,1) facing down]\n        Turn 92: L (to (5,1)) [facing left? and move left to (5,1)]\n        Turn 93: L (to (4,1)) [facing left and move left to (4,1)]\n\n   But then she is at (4,1) at turn 93, and the soup won't be ready until turn 103. She can use the time to get a plate.\n\n   From (4,1) to the plate dispenser at (0,2):\n        Turn 94: L (to (3,1)) [facing left and move left to (3,1)]\n        Turn 95: L (to (2,1)) [facing left and move left to (2,1)]\n        Turn 96: U (to (2,2)) is blocked by kitchen counter? -> cannot. \n        Instead, from (2,1) to (1,1) is west: \n             Turn 96: L (to (1,1)) [facing left and move left to (1,1)]\n        Turn 97: U (to (1,2)) [facing up and move up to (1,2)]\n\n   Now at (1,2), she can face west to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2):\n        Turn 98: L (change orientation to left) [now facing west]\n        Turn 99: I (interact to get a plate) [now holding a plate]\n\n   Then she needs to return to (4,1) to serve the soup when ready.\n\n   From (1,2) to (4,1):\n        Turn 100: D (to (1,1)) [facing down? and move down to (1,1)]\n        Turn 101: R (to (2,1)) [facing right and move right]\n        Turn 102: R (to (3,1)) [facing right and move right]\n        Turn 103: R (to (4,1)) [facing right and move right]\n\n   Now at turn 103, she is at (4,1) holding a plate, and the soup is ready. \n        Turn 104: D (change orientation to down) to face the pot.\n        Turn 105: I (interact to serve the soup) -> this will deliver the soup and get the reward.\n\nBut note: at turn 98 when Bob adds the onion, the pot starts cooking. It will be ready at turn 103. So at turn 103, the soup is ready. Alice arrives at (4,1) at turn 103, but she is facing right. She needs to face down to interact. So:\n\n        Turn 104: D (face down)\n        Turn 105: I (serve)\n\nThis works.\n\nHowever, we can optimize: \n  - Alice can be at (4,1) earlier and wait? But she has to get the plate.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice gets the plate, she can wait at (4,1) for the soup to be ready. But she arrives at turn 103, which is when the soup is ready.\n\nBut what if the soup is ready at turn 103, and she is there at turn 103, then on turn 104 she changes orientation and turn 105 serves. \n\nBut we can have her face down when she arrives at (4,1) on turn 103? On turn 103 she moves right to (4,1) from (3,1), so she is facing right. She would need to change orientation to down on the same turn? But each turn only one action.\n\nSo turn 103: she moves to (4,1) and is facing right.\nTurn 104: change orientation to down.\nTurn 105: interact.\n\nAlternatively, on turn 103, after moving to (4,1), she can change orientation in the same turn? No, each turn only one action: either move or change orientation or interact.\n\nSo it takes two extra turns.\n\nBut Bob's actions:\n\n  - Turn 91: Bob moves L to (1,3)\n  - Turn 92: D to (1,2)\n  - Turn 93: D to (1,1)\n  - Turn 94: R to (2,1)\n  - Turn 95: R to (3,1)\n  - Turn 96: R to (4,1)\n  - Turn 97: D (face down)\n  - Turn 98: I (add onion) -> pot starts cooking at turn 98.\n\nThe soup is ready at turn 98 + 5 = turn 103.\n\nAlice:\n\n  - Turn 91: D to (6,1)\n  - Turn 92: L to (5,1)\n  - Turn 93: L to (4,1) -> now she is at (4,1) at turn 93, facing left? \n        But she doesn't have a plate. She needs to get a plate.\n\n  Then from (4,1) to get a plate:\n        Turn 94: L to (3,1)\n        Turn 95: L to (2,1)\n        Turn 96: L to (1,1)\n        Turn 97: U to (1,2)\n        Turn 98: L (face west) -> or can she interact without changing orientation? The dispenser is at (0,2) which is west of (1,2). She is at (1,2) and if she is facing west, then she can interact. But when she moves to (1,2) from (1,1) on turn 97, she is facing up? Because she moved up. So she needs to change orientation to west.\n\n        Turn 98: L (change orientation to west) \n        Turn 99: I (grab plate)\n\n  Then return:\n        Turn 100: D to (1,1) [facing down? and move down]\n        Turn 101: R to (2,1) [facing right and move]\n        Turn 102: R to (3,1) [facing right and move]\n        Turn 103: R to (4,1) [facing right and move]\n\n  Now at turn 103, she is at (4,1) facing right. The soup is ready.\n        Turn 104: D (face down)\n        Turn 105: I (serve)\n\nThis is 15 turns (from turn 91 to turn 105) and we get one soup served.\n\nBut we are only planning for the next several turns, say H turns. We might not need to plan the entire sequence until serving if H is small. But the problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H. Let's say we plan for the next 10 turns? But then we might not complete the soup.\n\nAlternatively, we can have a shorter plan to get the pot started and then plan again later.\n\nBut the immediate goal is to add the onion to the pot to start cooking. Bob is holding an onion and is the closest? But his path is long. Alice is free and might be able to get an onion from a kitchen counter to add to the pot? \n\nThere are onions on kitchen counters. For example, at (6,4) there is an onion. But (6,4) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so Alice cannot walk on it. She must be adjacent to interact. \n\nAlice is at (6,2). The kitchen counter at (6,4) is two steps up? But she can go to (6,3) and then face up to interact with (6,4)? \n  - Turn 91: U to (6,3) [now at (6,3) facing up?]\n  - Turn 92: U to (6,4) is blocked (kitchen counter) -> cannot move there. \n  - So at (6,3), she can face up and interact with (6,4) to pick up the onion? \n        Turn 92: I (while at (6,3) facing up) -> since (6,4) is adjacent and above, and she is facing up, she can pick up the onion.\n\nThen she is holding an onion. She can then go to the pot at (4,0) to add it. But the pot at (4,0) already has 2 onions, so adding one more will start cooking.\n\nBut how to get to (4,1) from (6,3)? \n  - Turn 93: D (to (6,2)) \n  - Then as before: D to (6,1), L to (5,1), L to (4,1) -> turns 94,95,96.\n  - Then at (4,1), face down and interact to add the onion.\n\nSo:\n  - Turn 91: U (to (6,3))\n  - Turn 92: I (pick up onion from (6,4)) -> now holding onion.\n  - Turn 93: D (to (6,2))\n  - Turn 94: D (to (6,1))\n  - Turn 95: L (to (5,1))\n  - Turn 96: L (to (4,1))\n  - Turn 97: D (face down)\n  - Turn 98: I (add onion) -> starts cooking at turn 98.\n\nThis is 8 turns for Alice to start the cooking. And she doesn't need Bob to move. Bob can stay or do something else.\n\nThen the soup is ready at turn 98+5=103.\n\nMeanwhile, after adding the onion, Alice can get a plate and be back to serve.\n\nAfter turn 98, Alice is at (4,1) facing down, holding nothing (since she added the onion). She can go to get a plate:\n  - From (4,1) to (1,2) as before: 5 moves (as above) to get to (1,2) and face west, then interact to get plate on turn 104, then back to (4,1) by turn 108, then serve on turn 109.\n\nBut this is long.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can get the plate. Bob is at (2,3) and not holding anything after he delivers the onion? But in this scenario, Bob hasn't moved. He is at (2,3) facing left, holding an onion. If Alice adds the onion, then Bob's onion is extra. He can put it on a kitchen counter or use it for another pot.\n\nBut the pot at (3,0) is empty? We don't know, but it's not mentioned, so probably empty.\n\nIn the interest of time, let's have Alice add the onion and then Bob get the plate.\n\nAfter Alice starts the cooking at turn 98, the soup will be ready at turn 103.\n\nBob can be assigned to get the plate. He is at (2,3) and can go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nPath for Bob from (2,3) to (0,2):\n  - (2,3) -> move Left to (1,3) [1 move]\n  - (1,3) -> move Left to (0,3) is blocked (kitchen counter) -> cannot.\n  - So he must go to (1,2) first: from (1,3) move Down to (1,2) [2 moves]\n  - Then at (1,2), face west and interact with (0,2) to get plate.\n\nSteps for Bob:\n  - Turn 91: L ( to (1,3) ) [facing left]\n  - Turn 92: D ( to (1,2) ) [facing down]\n  - Turn 93: L ( change orientation to left to face west) \n  - Turn 94: I ( get plate )\n\nThen he needs to deliver the plate to the serving counter? No, he needs to use it to serve the soup. The soup is at (4,0), so he needs to be at (4,1) with the plate and face down.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (4,1):\n  - (1,2) -> D to (1,1) [1]\n  - (1,1) -> R to (2,1) [2]\n  - (2,1) -> R to (3,1) [3]\n  - (3,1) -> R to (4,1) [4]\n  - Then face down and interact.\n\nSo:\n  - Turn 95: D ( to (1,1) )\n  - Turn 96: R ( to (2,1) )\n  - Turn 97: R ( to (3,1) )\n  - Turn 98: R ( to (4,1) )\n  - Turn 99: D ( face down )\n  - Turn 100: I ( serve ) -> but the soup is not ready until turn 103.\n\nSo he arrives at turn 98, but the soup is ready at turn 103. He can wait.\n\nThen at turn 103, the soup is ready, so he can interact on turn 100? But turn 100 is before 103. He must wait until turn 103.\n\nSo on turn 103, he can interact.\n\nBut he is at (4,1) from turn 98 to turn 103, and on turn 99 he faced down. So on turn 100 to 102 he can wait (stay). Then turn 103: I.\n\nThis works.\n\nBut note: Alice's action to add the onion is at turn 98, so the soup is ready at turn 103. Bob is at (4,1) by turn 98 and can wait.\n\nSummary of actions:\n\nAlice:\n  - Turn 91: U (from (6,2) to (6,3))\n  - Turn 92: I (pick up onion from (6,4))\n  - Turn 93: D ( to (6,2) )\n  - Turn 94: D ( to (6,1) )\n  - Turn 95: L ( to (5,1) )\n  - Turn 96: L ( to (4,1) )\n  - Turn 97: D ( face down )\n  - Turn 98: I ( add onion to pot at (4,0) )\n\nBob:\n  - Turn 91: L ( to (1,3) )\n  - Turn 92: D ( to (1,2) )\n  - Turn 93: L ( face west )\n  - Turn 94: I ( get plate from (0,2) )\n  - Turn 95: D ( to (1,1) )\n  - Turn 96: R ( to (2,1) )\n  - Turn 97: R ( to (3,1) )\n  - Turn 98: R ( to (4,1) )\n  - Turn 99: D ( face down )\n  - Turn 100: S ( wait )\n  - Turn 101: S ( wait )\n  - Turn 102: S ( wait )\n  - Turn 103: I ( serve the soup )\n\nThis is 13 turns for Bob and 8 for Alice. But we only need to plan for Alice. The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But it says \"for Alice\", and optionally for Bob. Since we are controlling Alice, we plan for Alice. For Bob, we can suggest or assume he will follow a plan.\n\nBut the answer format is only for Alice? The boxed answer is for Alice's actions.\n\nLet me read the task: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only shows actions for Alice? The boxed example has \"Turn t: action\", but it doesn't specify player. But the task says \"for Alice\", so probably only Alice's actions.\n\nThen we only output Alice's actions.\n\nSo for Alice, we plan to add the onion to the pot to start the cooking. And then she can be free to do something else, but the problem doesn't require beyond the planning horizon.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan for Alice to get the plate after adding the onion, but within a horizon of say 10 turns, she might not complete.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the immediate high-impact action is to start the cooking, we plan for Alice to add the onion to the pot.\n\nAlice's actions for the next 8 turns:\n\n  Turn 91: U\n  Turn 92: I\n  Turn 93: D\n  Turn 94: D\n  Turn 95: L\n  Turn 96: L\n  Turn 97: D\n  Turn 98: I\n\nBut note: at turn 92, when she is at (6,3) and facing up, she can interact with (6,4) to get the onion.\n\nThen she moves down to (6,2) at turn 93, down to (6,1) at turn 94, left to (5,1) at turn 95, left to (4,1) at turn 96, face down at turn 97, and interact to add onion at turn 98.\n\nThis is a solid plan.\n\nAlternatively, we could have a shorter horizon and only plan to get the onion and move towards the pot. But since we can plan several turns, 8 turns is acceptable.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: I\nTurn 93: D\nTurn 94: D\nTurn 95: L\nTurn 96: L\nTurn 97: D\nTurn 98: I\n}\n\nNote: This plan assumes that Bob will not block the path. But Bob is at (2,3) initially and moving to (1,3) on turn 91, then to (1,2) on turn 92, etc., so he is out of the way for Alice.\n\nAlice's path: \n  - (6,2) -> U to (6,3)\n  - Then I (facing up to (6,4))\n  - Then D to (6,2)\n  - Then D to (6,1)\n  - Then L to (5,1)\n  - Then L to (4,1)\n  - Then D (change orientation to down)\n  - Then I (interact with (4,0))\n\nThis should work.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice should start by grabbing an onion from the kitchen counter at (6,4) and then deliver it to the pot at (4,0), which already contains 2 onions. Adding the third onion will start the cooking process (5-turn cook time). This sets up a future soup delivery worth 20 points. Alice's path is optimized for efficiency, avoiding Bob's movement path.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 91-98):\n- **Turn 91: U** - Move up to (6,3), now adjacent to the kitchen counter at (6,4).\n- **Turn 92: I** - Interact while facing up to grab the onion from (6,4). Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 93: D** - Move down to (6,2) to start heading toward the pot.\n- **Turn 94: D** - Move down to (6,1), positioning to move left.\n- **Turn 95: L** - Move left to (5,1), continuing toward the pot.\n- **Turn 96: L** - Move left to (4,1), now adjacent to the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 97: D** - Change orientation to face down (toward the pot at (4,0)).\n- **Turn 98: I** - Interact to add the onion to the pot. The pot now has 3 onions and starts cooking (ready at turn 103).\n\n### Coordination with Bob:\nBob is holding an onion at (2,3). He can independently:\n1. Move to (1,3) on turn 91 (left), then to (1,2) (down) on turn 92.\n2. Face west and grab a plate from (0,2) on turns 93-94.\n3. Move to (4,1) via (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1) (turns 95-98).\n4. Face down and wait (turns 99-102), then serve the soup at turn 103.\n\nThis sequence ensures the soup is cooked and served by turn 103 for 20 points. Alice's actions focus on initiating the cook, while Bob handles plating and serving.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: I\nTurn 93: D\nTurn 94: D\nTurn 95: L\nTurn 96: L\nTurn 97: D\nTurn 98: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 94. The goal is to maximize the total reward by delivering soup recipes.\n\nKey observations from the game state:\n- There is only one recipe: Recipe 1 requires 3 onions, cooks in 5 turns, and gives a reward of 20.\n- There are two pots at (3,0) and (4,0). The pot at (4,0) already has 2 onions and is not full (so it can take one more onion to start cooking). The pot at (3,0) is empty.\n- There are many onions scattered on kitchen counters and two onion dispensers at (3,4) and (4,4). Also, a plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- Alice is at (6,2) holding nothing, facing Up.\n- Bob is at (3,3) holding nothing, facing Down.\n\nWe need to complete a soup in the pot at (4,0) by adding one more onion and then cook it for 5 turns. After cooking, we need to serve it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nSteps to complete the recipe in the pot at (4,0):\n1. Get an onion and put it into the pot at (4,0). Since there are onions on kitchen counters, we can pick one up instead of going to the dispenser.\n2. After the pot has 3 onions, it will start cooking. We then need to wait 5 turns for it to cook.\n3. After 5 turns, we need to get a plate, pick up the cooked soup, and deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\nHowever, note that we are at turn 94 and the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions. We can add the third onion and then it will cook for 5 turns. The soup will be ready at turn 94 + 5 = 99.\n\nBut we have two players. We can coordinate to do multiple tasks in parallel.\n\nLet's see what we can do with the two players:\n\nAlice is at (6,2) and Bob is at (3,3). \n\nFor the pot at (4,0) to start cooking, we need one onion. There are onions available at:\n- (6,4): onion\n- (7,1): onion\n- (5,4): onion\n- (2,0): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n- (0,3): onion\n- (5,2): onion\n- (4,2): onion\n- (3,2): onion\n\nAlice is at (6,2). She can move to (6,3) then (6,4) to pick up the onion at (6,4). Alternatively, she can move to (5,2) and pick up the onion there (which is adjacent to her current position? Let's see the grid).\n\nCurrent position of Alice: (6,2). Adjacent tiles: \n- Up: (6,3) -> is that walkable? We don't have a map, but we know the tile types. The kitchen counters are at specific locations. We know (6,0) and (6,4) are kitchen counters, but (6,3) is not listed as a kitchen counter, so it should be empty (walkable). Similarly, (5,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion, but Alice is at (6,2) and (5,2) is adjacent? Yes, to the left.\n\nBut note: to interact with a kitchen counter, the player must be adjacent and facing it. So if Alice is at (6,2) and facing Up, she cannot interact with (5,2) because she is not facing left. She would have to change orientation.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob get the onion since he is closer to some onions? Bob is at (3,3). There is an onion at (3,2) which is directly above him? Wait, (3,3) and (3,2) is one step up? But Bob is facing down. He can move up to (3,2) and pick up the onion there? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. So Bob can move up to (3,2) and then interact to pick up the onion? But note: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. The kitchen counter is non-empty? Actually, the kitchen counter is a tile that can hold an item, but the tile itself is walkable? The rules say: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But note: the kitchen counter tile is always a kitchen counter, but when it has an item, it is non-empty? \n\nThe rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as having an item? But the kitchen counter is a tile type that can be empty or occupied. So if a kitchen counter has an item, then it is non-empty and cannot be walked on? \n\nBut the rules also say: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\" This implies that the player does not stand on the non-empty tile. So non-empty tiles (like a kitchen counter with an item) cannot be walked on? \n\nTherefore, Bob cannot move to (3,2) because it is non-empty (has an onion). So he must stand adjacent and face it to interact.\n\nBob is at (3,3) and facing Down. He can interact with (3,2)? (3,2) is above him? He is facing down, so he is not facing (3,2). He must change orientation to Up and then interact? But he is at (3,3) and (3,2) is adjacent to the north. So if he changes orientation to Up, then he can interact with (3,2). However, note that the interaction requires the player to be on an empty tile adjacent to the target and facing the target. (3,3) is adjacent to (3,2) and (3,3) is an empty tile? We don't have a list of empty tiles, but we know the non-empty ones. The kitchen counters that are occupied are non-empty? Actually, the tile (3,3) is not listed as a kitchen counter, so it should be an empty tile. So Bob can interact with (3,2) by facing Up and pressing Interact.\n\nSimilarly, Alice at (6,2) can interact with (5,2) if she moves left to (5,2)? But (5,2) has an onion, so it is non-empty and cannot be walked on. Therefore, Alice must stand on an adjacent empty tile and face (5,2) to interact. The adjacent empty tiles to (5,2) are: (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), (6,2). So Alice is currently at (6,2), which is adjacent to (5,2). But she is facing Up, not Left. So she can change orientation to Left and then interact to pick up the onion at (5,2).\n\nAlternatively, she can go to (6,4) to pick up the onion there. (6,4) is a kitchen counter with an onion, so non-empty. She must stand adjacent and face it. She can move to (6,3) (which should be empty) and then face Up to interact with (6,4)? (6,4) is above (6,3). So if she moves to (6,3) and faces Up, she can interact.\n\nBut note: (6,3) is not listed as a kitchen counter, so it should be empty and walkable.\n\nPlan for the next few turns:\n\nWe need to get one onion into the pot at (4,0). We have two players. We can assign one player to get the onion and put it in the pot. The other player can start preparing for the next steps: getting plates and serving.\n\nHowever, the soup will take 5 turns to cook. So after putting the onion in the pot at turn 94 (or soon), the soup will be ready at turn 99. Then we need to serve it.\n\nBut we can also start another soup in the other pot? The pot at (3,0) is empty. We could make another soup? But note: we have only one recipe and it requires 3 onions. We have plenty of onions. We can make two soups? But we are at turn 94 and we don't know how long we are going to play, but we are only planning for H turns (let's say H=10 or so). But the problem says to plan a sequence for the next several turns.\n\nHowever, the reward for one soup is 20. We can potentially make two soups? But the second soup in the pot at (3,0) would require 3 onions. We can do that in parallel.\n\nBut let's focus on the immediate opportunity: the pot at (4,0) only needs one onion to start cooking. So we should do that first.\n\nOption 1: Bob picks up the onion at (3,2) and puts it in the pot at (4,0). How?\n- Bob is at (3,3) facing Down. He can:\n  - Change orientation to Up (so he is facing (3,2)) and then Interact to pick up the onion at (3,2). Then he will be holding an onion.\n  - Then he needs to go to the pot at (4,0). The pot is at (4,0). He is at (3,3). He can move: Down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is non-empty? He just picked up the onion, so now (3,2) becomes empty? When he picks up the onion, the kitchen counter becomes empty? Yes. So after picking up, (3,2) becomes empty and walkable? But note: the tile is still a kitchen counter, but now empty. So it becomes walkable? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So empty tiles are walkable.\n\nTherefore, after Bob picks up the onion at (3,2), that tile becomes empty and walkable. Then Bob can move:\n  - From (3,3) to (3,2) (Up) -> now (3,2) is empty so he can walk there? But he is at (3,3) and (3,2) is adjacent. He can move Up to (3,2) and then Right to (4,2). Then Down to (4,1) and then Down to (4,0). But (4,0) is a pot, which is non-empty? Actually, the pot is a tile that can have items. The rules don't explicitly say if the pot tile is walkable. But typically in Overcooked, players cannot stand on the pot. So the pot tile is non-empty? Therefore, Bob must stand adjacent to the pot and face it to interact.\n\nThe pot at (4,0). Adjacent empty tiles: \n- (3,0): pot? no, (3,0) is a pot too? The pots are at (3,0) and (4,0). So (4,0) is occupied by the pot. The adjacent tiles are:\n  - North: (4,1) -> is that empty? It's not listed as a kitchen counter, so it should be empty.\n  - East: (5,0) -> kitchen counter? Yes, (5,0) is a kitchen counter. But we don't know if it has an item? The non-empty kitchen counters are listed. (5,0) is not in the non-empty list? The non-empty ones are: (6,4), (7,1), (5,4), (2,0), (2,2), (0,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2). (5,0) is not in that list, so it must be empty? But the tile (5,0) is a kitchen counter (from the tile types list), so if it's not listed in non-empty, then it is empty. Therefore, (5,0) is an empty kitchen counter? Then it is walkable? Yes, because empty.\n\nBut to interact with the pot at (4,0), Bob can stand at (4,1) (north of the pot) and face down, or at (5,0) (east) and face left, or at (3,0) (west) but (3,0) is a pot? So non-empty? So he cannot stand on (3,0). Therefore, the available spots are (4,1) and (5,0).\n\nBob can go to (4,0) via:\n  - From (3,2): move Right to (4,2). Then Down to (4,1). Then he is at (4,1) and the pot is at (4,0) south of him. He can face Down and interact to add the onion.\n\nSo Bob's plan:\n- Turn 94: Change orientation to Up (to face (3,2)) and then Interact? But the action per turn is one of: U, D, L, R, I, S. So to change orientation to Up, he must use the action \"U\". But note the rule: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But changing orientation doesn't move, so it should be safe. So Bob can do:\n  - Turn 94: U (to change orientation to Up) -> now facing (3,2)\n  - Turn 95: I (interact to pick up onion from (3,2)) -> now holding onion\n  - Then he needs to move to (4,1). From (3,3) he is now at? Wait, he was at (3,3) at turn 94. Then at turn 94 he did U (change orientation, no move). Then at turn 95 he did I (interact) while at (3,3). Then at turn 96: move Right to (4,3)? But we don't know the grid. Alternatively, from (3,3) he can move:\n    - Turn 96: R (to (4,3))\n    - Turn 97: D (to (4,2)) -> but (4,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? The non-empty kitchen counters include (4,2). So (4,2) is non-empty? Therefore, he cannot walk to (4,2). So he must go around.\n\nAlternative route for Bob:\n  - After picking up the onion at (3,3) by facing up and interacting, he can move:\n    - Turn 96: D (to (3,2)) -> now (3,2) is empty (because he picked up the onion) so he can walk there? But note: after he picks up the onion, (3,2) becomes empty and walkable? Yes. So:\n      - Turn 96: D (move Down? But he is at (3,3). Moving Down would be to (3,2). So D to (3,2)\n    - Turn 97: R (to (4,2)) -> but (4,2) has an onion? It's non-empty? So he cannot walk to (4,2). Therefore, he must avoid (4,2). Instead, from (3,2) he can move:\n        - Turn 97: D (to (3,1)) -> but we don't know if (3,1) is empty? It's not listed as a kitchen counter, so it should be empty? Then from (3,1) he can move:\n        - Turn 98: R (to (4,1))\n    - Now at (4,1), facing? He needs to face Down to interact with the pot at (4,0). So:\n        - Turn 99: Change orientation to Down? So D? But D is move down? We have to use orientation change? The orientation change is done by using the direction without moving? The rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But if we are on an empty tile, then moving would occur? Actually, the action for changing orientation is the same as moving? How do we differentiate?\n\nThe actions are: Move (L/R/U/D) and Change Orientation (L/R/U/D). But the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So how do we change orientation without moving? The rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This implies that when you try to move and the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move but change orientation? But if the adjacent tile is empty, then you move? \n\nSo the same action (U, D, L, R) can either move or change orientation depending on whether the adjacent tile in that direction is empty.\n\nTherefore, to change orientation without moving, you must be facing a non-empty adjacent tile? \n\nFor Bob at (3,3) at turn 94, if he does U (which is up), then he would try to move to (3,4)? But (3,4) is an onion dispenser? The dispensers are non-empty? So he cannot move to (3,4). Therefore, doing U at (3,3) will change his orientation to Up without moving. Then at turn 95, he can do I to interact with (3,2) (which is now in front of him) to pick up the onion.\n\nThen at turn 96, he is at (3,3) and wants to go to (3,2). He can do D? But D would try to move down to (3,2). Since (3,2) is now empty (because he picked up the onion), it is walkable. So doing D at turn 96: move down to (3,2).\n\nThen at turn 97, he is at (3,2). He wants to go to (4,1). He can do:\n  - First, move right to (4,2)? But (4,2) has an onion? It's non-empty? So he cannot move to (4,2). Therefore, he must move down to (3,1) first? \n    - Turn 97: D (move down to (3,1)) -> assuming (3,1) is empty and walkable.\n    - Turn 98: R (move right to (4,1)) -> assuming (4,1) is empty.\n\nNow at (4,1), he needs to face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). So at turn 99, he does D? But D would try to move down to (4,0). But (4,0) is a pot and non-empty? So he cannot move, but it will change his orientation to Down? Then at turn 100, he can interact? But we want to put the onion as soon as possible.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 99, he can change orientation to down without moving by trying to move down (which fails and changes orientation). Then at turn 100, he can interact.\n\nBut we want to put the onion at turn 99? That would be the earliest? Actually, we are at turn 94 and the onion must be put as soon as possible.\n\nBut note: we have Alice. She is closer to some onions and the pot? Alice is at (6,2). She can pick up the onion at (5,2) or (6,4).\n\nOption for Alice to put the onion in the pot:\n  - Alice at (6,2) facing Up. She can change orientation to Left to face (5,2) (which has an onion) by doing L. But if she does L, she would try to move left to (5,2)? But (5,2) has an onion so non-empty? So she cannot move, and the action L will change her orientation to Left? \n      - Turn 94: L (change orientation to Left without moving)\n      - Turn 95: I (pick up onion from (5,2)) -> now holding onion\n  - Then she needs to go to the pot at (4,0). She is at (6,2). She can move:\n        - Turn 96: L (to (5,2))? But (5,2) is now empty? Because she picked up the onion? So she can move to (5,2) by doing L? But note: after she picks up, (5,2) becomes empty and walkable. So:\n          - Turn 96: L (move left to (5,2))\n          - Turn 97: L (to (4,2))? But (4,2) has an onion? Non-empty? So she cannot move. Therefore, she must go down first.\n        - From (6,2): after picking up, she is at (6,2). Then:\n          - Turn 96: D (to (6,1)) -> assuming (6,1) is empty? \n          - Turn 97: L (to (5,1)) -> empty?\n          - Turn 98: L (to (4,1)) -> empty?\n        - Now at (4,1), she can face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). \n          - Turn 99: D (to change orientation to down? because moving down to (4,0) is blocked) -> changes orientation to down.\n          - Turn 100: I (to add onion to the pot)\n\nBut this is slower than using Bob? Bob can have the onion in the pot by turn 100? Actually, Bob's plan would have:\n  - Turn 94: U (change orientation to Up) -> at (3,3) facing Up\n  - Turn 95: I (pick up onion from (3,2)) -> holding onion, (3,2) becomes empty\n  - Turn 96: D (move down to (3,2)) -> now at (3,2)\n  - Turn 97: D (move down to (3,1)) -> assuming (3,1) is empty\n  - Turn 98: R (move right to (4,1)) -> at (4,1)\n  - Turn 99: D (tries to move down to (4,0) but blocked, so changes orientation to Down) -> facing Down\n  - Turn 100: I (add onion to pot)\n\nSame as Alice.\n\nBut note: we can have Bob do it and Alice do something else. For example, Alice can start preparing for the serving: get a plate and be ready to serve when the soup is cooked.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). Alice is at (6,2). She can go to (0,2) to get a plate? But it's far.\n\nAlternatively, she can pick up a plate from the plate dispenser? But she is not holding anything. But the plate dispenser is at (0,2). She would need to go there.\n\nBut note: there might be plates on kitchen counters? The non-empty kitchen counters only have onions, no plates. So we have to get plates from the dispenser.\n\nAfter the soup is cooked (at turn 99 if we put the onion at turn 94? Actually, we put the onion at turn 100? So the soup will start cooking at turn 100 and be ready at turn 105.\n\nWe need to deliver the soup at turn 105 or later.\n\nSo we have time. We can have both players help to get the onion and then one can get the plate.\n\nBut to maximize, we can have Bob put the onion in the pot and then Alice get a plate and be ready to serve.\n\nBut Alice is at (6,2). She can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2). The path: from (6,2) to (0,2). The kitchen counters are at (0,0) to (7,0) and (0,4) etc. But we need to avoid non-empty tiles? But we can walk through empty tiles.\n\nThe grid is 8x5? We don't have the full grid, but we can assume a grid from (0,0) to (7,4). \n\nAlice can go:\n  - From (6,2): move Left repeatedly to (0,2). But (5,2) is non-empty? At the moment, yes. But after she picks up the onion at (5,2) if she does that? But we are considering if she doesn't pick up the onion.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice pick up the onion at (5,2) and then go to the pot? But that would be for the same pot? We only need one onion.\n\nBut we have two pots. We can start another soup in the other pot? The pot at (3,0) is empty. We can make another soup. But it will take 3 onions and then 5 turns to cook. So if we start now, it will be ready at turn 94 + 3 (to get the onions) + 5 = 102? But we are only planning for H turns (say 10 turns), so it might be beyond our planning horizon.\n\nBut the problem says to maximize the total reward. So we can plan to make two soups? But the second soup might not be delivered in the next 10 turns? We don't know how long the game will last.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, let's focus on delivering the one that is almost ready.\n\nSo the immediate plan:\n- Have Bob put the third onion in the pot at (4,0) as described.\n- Meanwhile, Alice can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate and then come back to be ready to serve the soup when it's cooked.\n\nBut the soup will be ready at turn 105 (if we put the onion at turn 100). Alice has 11 turns (from turn 94 to 105) to get the plate and come to the pot? That should be enough.\n\nHow long does it take for Alice to go to (0,2) and back? From (6,2) to (0,2): 6 steps left. Then pick up the plate (one interact). Then come back to (4,1) to serve? From (0,2) to (4,1): 4 right and 1 down? But she can go directly? The path might be blocked by counters? But we assume she can go along the top row? \n\nBut note: the kitchen counters at (0,2) is the plate dispenser? Actually, the plate dispenser is a type of dispenser. So (0,2) is non-empty? But we can interact with it to get a plate.\n\nAlice's plan:\n  - Turn 94: L (to change orientation to Left? because she is at (6,2) and (5,2) is non-empty? So if she does L, she will change orientation to Left without moving? \n  - Then turn 95: I? But she is facing (5,2) and can pick up the onion? But we don't want her to pick up the onion? We want her to go to the plate dispenser.\n\nSo she should not interact with (5,2). Instead, she can move left? But (5,2) is non-empty? So she cannot move left from (6,2) to (5,2). Therefore, she must go around? \n\nFrom (6,2), she can move:\n  - Down to (6,1) [if empty] -> turn 94: D\n  - Then Left to (5,1) -> turn 95: L\n  - Then Left to (4,1) -> turn 96: L\n  - Then Left to (3,1) -> turn 97: L\n  - Then Left to (2,1) -> turn 98: L\n  - Then Left to (1,1) -> turn 99: L\n  - Then Left to (0,1) -> turn 100: L\n  - Then Up to (0,2) -> turn 101: U\n\nBut (0,2) is the plate dispenser? She must stand adjacent to interact? But she is at (0,1) and (0,2) is above. So at (0,1) she can face Up and interact? But she is at (0,1) and (0,2) is adjacent. So:\n  - Turn 102: U (to change orientation to Up? or move? If she does U, she would try to move to (0,2). But (0,2) is a dispenser? Non-empty? So she cannot move, but the action U will change her orientation to Up? Then:\n  - Turn 103: I (to get a plate) -> now holding a plate.\n\nThen she needs to go back to the pot at (4,0). From (0,1) she can go:\n  - Turn 104: R (to (1,1))\n  - Turn 105: R (to (2,1))\n  - Turn 106: R (to (3,1))\n  - Turn 107: R (to (4,1))\n  - Then at (4,1), she can face Down and interact with the pot at (4,0) to pick up the soup? But only if the soup is cooked and she is holding a plate.\n\nThe soup will be ready at turn 105 (if put at turn 100). But she arrives at (4,1) at turn 107? So she is late.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the plate at turn 103, she can go to the serving counter? But the soup isn't ready until turn 105. And she is at (0,2) at turn 103? Then she can go to (4,1) by turn 107? But the soup is ready at turn 105. So we need someone to pick up the soup at turn 105.\n\nWe can have Bob do that? Bob is putting the onion in the pot at turn 100, then he is at (4,1). He can wait and then at turn 105, he can pick up the soup? But he needs a plate.\n\nSo Bob should get a plate? But he is busy putting the onion. After he puts the onion at turn 100, he is at (4,1) holding nothing. Then he can go to the plate dispenser? But that is far.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice get the plate earlier? But we are starting at turn 94.\n\nBut note: we have 5 turns of cooking time. We can get the plate during the cooking time.\n\nSo let's adjust:\n\n- Bob puts the onion at turn 100. Then the soup starts cooking at turn 100 and will be ready at turn 105.\n- Alice goes to get the plate and be back by turn 105.\n\nBut as above, she arrives at (4,1) at turn 107? That's too late.\n\nWe need a faster route for Alice.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (0,2): if she can go along the top? But (6,2) to (6,3) is possible? Then left? But there are kitchen counters at (5,2), (4,2), etc. that are non-empty? So she cannot walk on them. She must go around: either above or below.\n\nThe top row: y=4 has kitchen counters at (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4) and they are non-empty? (6,4) has an onion, so non-empty. So she cannot go to (6,4). Similarly, (5,4) has an onion.\n\nThe bottom row: y=0 has kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0). But (2,0) has an onion, so non-empty. (5,0) is empty? Yes, because not in the non-empty list. So she can go through the bottom.\n\nAlice's path to (0,2):\n  - From (6,2): \n      - Turn 94: D (to (6,1))\n      - Turn 95: D (to (6,0)) -> but (6,0) is a kitchen counter? And it is empty? (not in non-empty list) so walkable.\n      - Turn 96: L (to (5,0))\n      - Turn 97: L (to (4,0)) -> but (4,0) is a pot? Non-empty? So she cannot move to (4,0). Therefore, she must avoid.\n\nAlternative: \n  - From (6,0): \n      - Turn 96: L (to (5,0)) -> empty kitchen counter, walkable.\n      - Turn 97: L (to (4,0)) -> blocked? (4,0) is a pot. So she cannot move to (4,0). \n      - So from (5,0), she can move Up to (5,1) -> turn 97: U\n      - Then Left to (4,1) -> turn 98: L\n      - Then Left to (3,1) -> turn 99: L\n      - Then Left to (2,1) -> turn 100: L\n      - Then Left to (1,1) -> turn 101: L\n      - Then Left to (0,1) -> turn 102: L\n      - Then Up to (0,2) -> turn 103: U -> but (0,2) is the plate dispenser? Non-empty? So she cannot move to (0,2). Therefore, she must stop at (0,1) and then interact with (0,2) by facing Up and pressing Interact.\n\nSo:\n  - Turn 103: U (tries to move to (0,2) but blocked, so changes orientation to Up)\n  - Turn 104: I (gets a plate) -> holding plate.\n\nThen she needs to go back to (4,1) to serve the soup? The soup is ready at turn 105. She is at (0,1) at turn 104. Then:\n  - Turn 105: R (to (1,1))\n  - Turn 106: R (to (2,1))\n  - Turn 107: R (to (3,1))\n  - Turn 108: R (to (4,1))\n  - Then at (4,1), face Down and interact to pick up the soup? But the soup is in the pot at (4,0). She can pick it up if she is holding a plate and the soup is cooked.\n\nBut at turn 105, the soup is ready, but Alice is at (0,1) or on the way. So she won't be there until turn 108.\n\nBob, after putting the onion at turn 100, is at (4,1). He can go to get a plate? But it's far. Or we can have Bob get the plate while Alice is doing something else? \n\nBut we have two players. We can have Alice get the plate while Bob is putting the onion. Then after Bob puts the onion, he can also go to get a plate? But we only need one plate.\n\nBut Alice is already going for the plate.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob get the plate and Alice put the onion? But Alice is further from the pot.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps we can have one player (Alice) get the plate and the other (Bob) put the onion and then wait. Then when the soup is ready, Bob can pick it up if he has a plate? But he doesn't. So Alice must bring the plate to Bob or to the pot.\n\nBut Alice is far away.\n\nAnother idea: after the soup is cooked, we can have the player who is near pick it up and deliver it. But we need a plate.\n\nPerhaps we should have Bob get the onion and put it in the pot, and then immediately go to get a plate. He can be back by the time the soup is ready.\n\nBob's plan after turn 100 (after putting the onion):\n  - Turn 100: at (4,1) holding nothing.\n  - He can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2). The path: \n        - Turn 100: U (to (4,2))? But (4,2) has an onion? Non-empty? So cannot. \n        - So he must go up first? (4,1) to (4,2) is blocked? Then he can go left to (3,1) -> turn 100: L\n        - Turn 101: U (to (3,2)) -> now (3,2) is empty? Because he picked up the onion earlier? Yes, so walkable.\n        - Turn 102: U (to (3,3))\n        - Then left to (2,3)? But we don't know the grid. We need to go west.\n        - From (3,3): turn 103: L (to (2,3))\n        - Turn 104: L (to (1,3))\n        - Turn 105: L (to (0,3)) -> but (0,3) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? Non-empty? So cannot walk. Therefore, he must go down from (0,3) is blocked? So he should go via (0,4)? But (0,4) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? Non-empty. So cannot.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's focus on the near term: getting the onion into the pot as soon as possible and then worry about the plate.\n\nBut to maximize the reward, we must deliver the soup. So we need to coordinate both to achieve that.\n\nAnother idea: use a kitchen counter to store a plate in advance? But currently, there is no plate on any counter. We have to get it from the dispenser.\n\nPerhaps one player (Alice) goes to get a plate now and brings it to a kitchen counter near the pot? For example, leave it at (5,0) or (4,1)? But (4,1) is empty and not a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are specific tiles. The nearest kitchen counter to the pot at (4,0) is (5,0) or (3,0) is a pot? (5,0) is a kitchen counter and currently empty? Yes.\n\nSo Alice can:\n  - Go to the plate dispenser and get a plate.\n  - Then bring it to (5,0) and place it there.\n  - Then when the soup is ready, either player can pick up the plate from (5,0) and then pick up the soup.\n\nBut placing the plate on (5,0) is safe because it's empty.\n\nThen Bob, after putting the onion, can wait nearby. At turn 105, he can pick up the plate from (5,0) and then pick up the soup.\n\nLet's time it:\n\nAlice's journey to get the plate and place it at (5,0):\n  - From (6,2) to (0,1) as before: we had it taking 10 turns to get to (0,1) and then interact at turn 104 to get the plate. Then she is at (0,1) holding the plate.\n  - Then she needs to go to (5,0) to place the plate.\n        - Turn 105: R (to (1,1))\n        - Turn 106: R (to (2,1))\n        - Turn 107: R (to (3,1))\n        - Turn 108: R (to (4,1))\n        - Turn 109: D ( to (4,0)? blocked. So she can go to (5,0) from (4,1): \n             - Turn 109: R ( to (5,1) ) -> empty? \n             - Turn 110: D ( to (5,0) ) -> (5,0) is a kitchen counter and empty? Yes. So she can move there? But (5,0) is a kitchen counter and empty, so walkable? Yes. Then she is at (5,0).\n        - Then she can place the plate on (5,0) by interacting? But to interact, she must be adjacent and facing it? She is standing on (5,0). The rule: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\" \n\nBut she is standing on (5,0). She can interact to place the item she is holding? The rule for kitchen counter: \"Pick up items (if player is empty-handed and counter is occupied) or place items (if player is holding an item and counter is empty).\"\n\nBut how does the interaction work when standing on the tile? The rule says: \"standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile\" -> but if she is standing on the tile, it's not adjacent, it's the same. So probably she cannot interact with the tile she is standing on? \n\nTherefore, to place an item on (5,0), she must stand on an adjacent empty tile and face (5,0). The adjacent tiles to (5,0) are (5,1), (4,0), (6,0). (4,0) is a pot, non-empty. (6,0) is a kitchen counter and empty? (6,0) is in the kitchen counter list, and not in the non-empty list, so empty. (5,1) is empty? Assume so.\n\nSo she can stand on (5,1) and face down to interact with (5,0)? \n  - From (5,0) she is at turn 110: then she can move to (5,1) at turn 111: U\n  - Then at (5,1), turn 112: face Down (by trying to move down to (5,0) but blocked, so change orientation to Down? or by D action which might move her if possible? But (5,0) is below, and she is holding a plate, but the tile (5,0) is empty? No, she is not standing on it. She is at (5,1). \n  - Turn 112: D (tries to move down to (5,0) -> (5,0) is empty kitchen counter, so she can walk there? But then she would be standing on (5,0) again. \n\nThis is not working.\n\nShe can place the plate from (5,1) by facing down and pressing Interact. But the rule: she must be on an empty tile adjacent to the target (5,0) and facing it. (5,1) is adjacent to (5,0) (south). So if she faces down, then she can interact to place the plate on (5,0).\n\nSo:\n  - After arriving at (5,0) at turn 110? But she is at (5,0) and holding the plate. She wants to place it on the kitchen counter (5,0). But she is standing on it. So she cannot interact with it. Therefore, she must first move away.\n\n  - Turn 110: she is at (5,0) -> move Up to (5,1) [empty?] \n  - Then at (5,1), turn 111: face Down (by doing D, which would try to move down to (5,0). But (5,0) is empty? Yes, but she can move there? We don't want her to move, we want her to interact. So she must change orientation to Down without moving. But if she does D and the tile below is empty, she will move down. Therefore, she cannot change orientation to down without moving because the tile is empty.\n\n The only way to change orientation to down without moving is if the tile below is non-empty? But (5,0) is empty.\n\nSo she cannot face down without moving down. \n\n Therefore, the best is to move to (5,1) and then do nothing? But then how to place the plate? She must interact. So she can move to (5,1) and then face down and then interact? But to face down, she must use D, which would move her to (5,0) because it's empty.\n\n This is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, she can move to (6,0) and then face left to interact with (5,0)? \n  - From (5,0): turn 110: R ( to (6,0) ) -> (6,0) is empty kitchen counter.\n  - Then at (6,0), she can face Left ( by doing L, which would try to move left to (5,0). (5,0) is empty, so she would move left? So she cannot change orientation to left without moving.\n\n Therefore, it's impossible to place an item on a kitchen counter that is empty and adjacent to an empty tile? \n\n I think there is a misunderstanding. The player can interact with a kitchen counter to place an item by standing on an adjacent tile (not on the counter) and facing it. In this case, for (5,0), Alice can stand on (5,1) (north of it) and face south (down) to interact. But to do that, she must be on (5,1) and facing down.\n\n So she doesn't need to be on the counter. \n\n Therefore, after getting the plate, she can go to (5,1) and then face down and interact to place the plate on (5,0).\n\n So for Alice:\n  - After getting the plate at (0,1) at turn 104, she goes to (5,1):\n        - Turn 105: R to (1,1)\n        - Turn 106: R to (2,1)\n        - Turn 107: R to (3,1)\n        - Turn 108: R to (4,1)\n        - Turn 109: R to (5,1)\n  - Then at (5,1), holding the plate, she can interact with (5,0) by facing down and pressing Interact. But currently, she is at (5,1) and not facing down. She arrived by moving right, so she is facing east? Or does the orientation change with move? The rules don't specify, but typically in such games, moving does not change orientation? Or does it? The action history shows moves and interacts, but not orientation changes explicitly.\n\n The rules: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when you move, you also change your orientation to the direction of the move.\n\n Therefore, when she moves R to (5,1) at turn 109, she is now facing Right (east).\n\n To face down, she must change orientation to down. She can do that by trying to move down? If she does D at (5,1), she will move down to (5,0) because it's empty. That's not what we want.\n\n To change orientation to down without moving, she would need to try to move down when the tile below is non-empty? But (5,0) is empty. So she cannot.\n\n Therefore, the only way is to move to (5,1) and then at the next turn, she can do an action that changes orientation to down? But there's no separate orientation change action. The only way to change orientation is to try to move in a direction and if blocked, you change orientation.\n\n Since (5,0) is empty, she cannot be blocked when trying to move down.\n\n This is a limitation.\n\n Given the complexity and time, perhaps we should have Alice deliver the plate directly to the serving counter after getting it? But the soup isn't ready yet.\n\n Alternatively, we can have Alice get the plate and then wait near the pot. When the soup is ready, she can pick it up.\n\n But she can't pick up the soup without a plate? She will have the plate.\n\n So at turn 105, the soup is ready. If Alice is at (4,1) holding a plate, she can face down and interact to pick up the soup. Then she can deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\n So let's aim to have Alice at (4,1) with a plate at turn 105.\n\n How many turns does that take?\n\n Alice's journey:\n  - Start at (6,2) at turn 94.\n  - Get to (0,1) and get the plate: turns 94 to 104 as before (11 turns: turn 94 to 104 inclusive is 11 turns, so at turn 104 she has the plate at (0,1)).\n  - Then from (0,1) to (4,1): \n        - Turn 105: R to (1,1)\n        - Turn 106: R to (2,1)\n        - Turn 107: R to (3,1)\n        - Turn 108: R to (4,1) -> arrives at turn 108.\n\n So at turn 108, she is at (4,1) with a plate. The soup is ready at turn 105? No, the soup is put at turn 100, ready at turn 105. So at turn 105, the soup is ready, but Alice is at (0,1) only. She arrives at (4,1) at turn 108, three turns late.\n\n The soup can be picked up anytime after it's cooked, so it's not a problem if it waits. So at turn 108, Alice can pick up the soup.\n\n Then she can deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2):\n        - From (4,1): \n          - Turn 109: R to (5,1)\n          - Turn 110: R to (6,1)\n          - Turn 111: U to (6,2)\n          - Then she is at (6,2), and the serving counter is at (7,2) to the east.\n          - Turn 112: R to (7,2) -> but (7,2) is a serving counter, non-empty? So she cannot walk on it. Therefore, she must stand at (6,2) and face east to interact.\n          - So at (6,2), turn 112: change orientation to Right? She arrives at (6,2) at turn 111 by moving U, so she is facing Up? \n          - Turn 112: R ( to change orientation to Right) -> if she does R, she would try to move to (7,2) but it's non-empty, so she changes orientation to Right without moving.\n          - Turn 113: I ( to deliver the soup) -> reward.\n\n So the soup is delivered at turn 113.\n\n Now, the only thing is to have Bob put the onion in the pot at turn 100.\n\n So we need to plan for both players from turn 94 to about turn 100 for Bob and turn 113 for Alice.\n\n We'll plan for Alice first 10 turns or so.\n\n Bob's plan ( to put the onion in the pot at (4,0) ):\n  - Turn 94: U ( at (3,3) -> changes orientation to Up without moving)\n  - Turn 95: I ( picks up onion from (3,2) )\n  - Turn 96: D ( moves to (3,2) )\n  - Turn 97: D ( moves to (3,1) ) [assuming (3,1) is empty]\n  - Turn 98: R ( moves to (4,1) )\n  - Turn 99: D ( tries to move to (4,0) but blocked, so changes orientation to Down)\n  - Turn 100: I ( adds the onion to the pot)\n\nAlice's plan:\n  - Turn 94: D ( move to (6,1) )\n  - Turn 95: D ( move to (6,0) )\n  - Turn 96: L ( move to (5,0) )\n  - Turn 97: U ( move to (5,1) ) [because she cannot go to (4,0)]\n  - Turn 98: L ( move to (4,1) )\n  - Turn 99: L ( move to (3,1) )\n  - Turn 100: L ( move to (2,1) )\n  - Turn 101: L ( move to (1,1) )\n  - Turn 102: L ( move to (0,1) )\n  - Turn 103: U ( tries to move to (0,2) but blocked, so changes orientation to Up)\n  - Turn 104: I ( picks up a plate from the dispenser at (0,2) )\n  - Then continue:\n        - Turn 105: R ( to (1,1) )\n        - Turn 106: R ( to (2,1) )\n        - Turn 107: R ( to (3,1) )\n        - Turn 108: R ( to (4,1) )\n        - At (4,1), she is holding a plate. The soup is ready since turn 105. She can face down and interact to pick up the soup.\n        - Turn 109: D ( tries to move to (4,0) but blocked, so changes orientation to Down)\n        - Turn 110: I ( picks up the soup -> now holding a soup in a plate)\n        - Then deliver to (7,2):\n             - Turn 111: R ( to (5,1) )\n             - Turn 112: R ( to (6,1) )\n             - Turn 113: U ( to (6,2) )\n             - Turn 114: R ( tries to move to (7,2) but blocked, so changes orientation to Right)\n             - Turn 115: I ( deliver the soup)\n\n But the planning horizon might be short. The instructions say to plan for the next several turns, say H turns. We can plan for 10 turns for each player.\n\n So for Alice, from turn 94 to 103 (10 turns): \n   turns 94 to 102: move to (0,1)\n   turn 103: U (change orientation to Up)\n   turn 104: I (get plate) -> but turn 104 is beyond 10 turns from 94 (94+9=103).\n\n So up to turn 103: she arrives at (0,1) and changes orientation to Up.\n\n For Bob, from turn 94 to 100: we have 7 turns.\n\n So for the answer, we can output the next 10 turns for Alice (turns 94 to 103) and for Bob until turn 100 (7 turns).\n\n But the answer format is for Alice only? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\".\n\n So we must plan for Alice. For Bob, we can suggest but it's optional.\n\n Let's output Alice's actions for 10 turns.\n\nAlice's actions:\n  - Turn 94: D\n  - Turn 95: D\n  - Turn 96: L\n  - Turn 97: U\n  - Turn 98: L\n  - Turn 99: L\n  - Turn 100: L\n  - Turn 101: L\n  - Turn 102: L\n  - Turn 103: U  ( to change orientation to Up, because move to (0,2) is blocked)\n\n For Bob, we can output for the next 7 turns (94 to 100):\n  - Turn 94: U\n  - Turn 95: I\n  - Turn 96: D\n  - Turn 97: D\n  - Turn 98: R\n  - Turn 99: D\n  - Turn 100: I\n\n But the answer format might expect only Alice's actions? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\".\n\n However, to maximize the reward, we need both players to coordinate. But the task is to output for Alice.\n\n So we will output only Alice's actions for the next 10 turns.\n\n But note: the current turn is 94, so we plan for turns 94 to 103.\n\n Therefore, Alice's actions:\n\n Turn 94: D\n Turn 95: D\n Turn 96: L\n Turn 97: U\n Turn 98: L\n Turn 99: L\n Turn 100: L\n Turn 101: L\n Turn 102: L\n Turn 103: U\n\n This will get her to (0,1) facing Up, ready to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2) on turn 104.\n\n Meanwhile, we hope that Bob will put the onion in the pot by turn 100.\n\n If we are to include Bob's actions optionally, we can state them separately, but the answer format might not allow. The box should contain only the turns for Alice.\n\n So we output only Alice's actions.\n\n However, the user may expect only Alice's actions.\n\n Let's do as the answer format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should coordinate to complete the partially filled pot at (4,0) (containing 2 onions) by adding one more onion, allowing it to cook for 5 turns, and then serving the soup. Alice will retrieve a plate from the dispenser at (0,2) to prepare for serving, while Bob handles adding the final onion to the pot. Alice's path is optimized to avoid non-empty tiles and reach the plate dispenser efficiently.\n\n**Alice's Action Plan (Turns 94 to 103):**\n- **Turn 94 (D)**: Move down to (6,1). This avoids the non-empty (5,2) and starts the journey to the plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 95 (D)**: Move down to (6,0). (6,0) is an empty kitchen counter tile, so it is walkable.\n- **Turn 96 (L)**: Move left to (5,0). (5,0) is an empty kitchen counter tile.\n- **Turn 97 (U)**: Move up to (5,1). This avoids the non-walkable pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 98 (L)**: Move left to (4,1). (4,1) is an empty tile.\n- **Turn 99 (L)**: Move left to (3,1). (3,1) is empty and walkable.\n- **Turn 100 (L)**: Move left to (2,1). Continues the westward path.\n- **Turn 101 (L)**: Move left to (1,1). Nearing the plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 102 (L)**: Move left to (0,1). Arrives adjacent to the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- **Turn 103 (U)**: Change orientation to Up (facing (0,2)). This prepares Alice to interact with the plate dispenser on the next turn (Turn 104) to grab a plate.\n\n**Coordination with Bob:**  \nBob should add the final onion to the pot at (4,0) by Turn 100:\n- **Bob's Actions (Turns 94 to 100)**:  \n  - Turn 94: U (change orientation to Up to face (3,2)).  \n  - Turn 95: I (pick up onion from (3,2)).  \n  - Turn 96: D (move down to (3,2)).  \n  - Turn 97: D (move down to (3,1)).  \n  - Turn 98: R (move right to (4,1)).  \n  - Turn 99: D (change orientation to Down facing (4,0)).  \n  - Turn 100: I (add onion to the pot at (4,0)).  \n\nThis starts the soup cooking at Turn 100, ready by Turn 105. Alice will have a plate by Turn 104 and can return to (4,1) by Turn 108 to pick up the cooked soup and deliver it to the serving counter at (7,2).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 94: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 95: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 96: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 97: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 98: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 99: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 100: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 101: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 102: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 103: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",
