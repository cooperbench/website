        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t_1, which is given as t_0 = 0, so I'll use t for turns starting from 0. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. The car spans move left or right based on direction.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that y_T, there is a car whose span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T you move from y to y+1, you are still on y at turn T, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So you only check for collision on the freeway you are currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car state is given for turn t_1 = 0.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nDirection is right, so they are moving right. For right-moving cars, span is [tail, head], but in the update, it says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For the first car on freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -59? That seems odd because if it's right-moving, head should be larger than tail? But here head is -48, tail is -59, and -48 > -59, so if direction is right, head is the front, so for right-moving, head should be to the right, so larger x, but here x is negative? Let's see the coordinates.\n\nThe x-axis: cars are moving, and collision is at x=0. The player is always at x=0, I assume, since it's (0,y_t).\n\nFor a car, the span is the segment it occupies. For right-moving, at time t, Span(t) = [τ(t), h(t)], with h(t) > τ(t) since it's moving right.\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for freeway 1, first car: head = -48, tail = -59, direction right, speed 6.\n\nSince direction is right, and head = -48, tail = -59, which means at t=0, the car is from x=-59 to x=-48? But -59 to -48, since -59 < -48, and moving right, so as time increases, both head and tail increase.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=0, tail=-11, direction right, speed 6. So at t=0, from x=-11 to x=0.\n\nx=0 is included, so at t=0, on freeway 1, there is a car that includes x=0? But the player is on y=0 at t=0, not on freeway 1, so no collision yet. Collision only when player is on that freeway.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFor first car, head=-48, tail=-59. Since direction right, and head > tail? -48 > -59, yes, so span [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at t=0.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 3: (-48, -95, right, 48)  only one car.\n\nHead=-48, tail=-95, direction right, so span [-95, -48] at t=0.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-48, -59, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nHead and tail: for first, head=-48, tail=-59, so [-59, -48]? tail=-59, head=-48, so if right-moving, span [tail, head] = [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly, second: tail=-23, head=-12, span [-23, -12]\n\nThird: tail=13, head=24, span [13,24]\n\nBut tail=13, head=24, both positive, so at t=0, it's from 13 to 24, not near zero.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (-48, -59, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)  tail=13, head=24, so [13,24]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5 and 6.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48, -95, right, 48) same as freeway 3 and 4.\n\nThe player starts at y=0, needs to go to y=9. Since y=0 to y=9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so player must move up through each freeway.\n\nBut y=0 is the starting point, not a freeway with cars, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars.\n\nThe player can be on y=0 or y=9, which might be safe zones, but y=9 is the goal, and no cars there I assume.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9 turns if we move up every turn, but we might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns without colliding.\n\nSince we move one y-level at a time, and each move changes y by at most 1, we need at least 9 moves to increase y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut we can stay or move down, so H could be more.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to check when it is safe to be on that freeway, meaning that at that turn, no car on that freeway has span including 0.\n\nThe car spans change over time, so for each freeway, we need the times when x=0 is not occupied by any car on that freeway.\n\nSince cars move at constant speed, we can find for each freeway the set of times when it is safe.\n\nThen the player must be on each y from 1 to 8 at some point, and for each, at that turn, it must be safe for that y.\n\nAlso, the player can stay on a y or move around, but since we want min turns, we probably want to move up as much as possible, only waiting or moving down when necessary.\n\nBut moving down might be needed to avoid a car, then move up later.\n\nFirst, let's define the safety for each freeway over time.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t=0.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at time t, it is safe if for all cars on k, 0 is not in the span at time t.\n\nFor a car, the span at time T is given by the initial span at t_1=0, moved by s*T for right-moving or -s*T for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, I think? Let me check.\n\nDirection: all are \"right\", so all moving right.\n\nSo for right-moving car, initial span at t=0: [τ, h]\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s*T, h + s*T]\n\nAnd 0 is in span if τ + s*T <= 0 <= h + s*T\n\nSince h > τ for right-moving, so it's τ + s*T <= 0 and 0 <= h + s*T, which is equivalent to -h <= s*T <= -τ? Let's see.\n\n0 is in [τ + sT, h + sT] iff τ + sT <= 0 <= h + sT\n\nSince h + sT > τ + sT, so yes.\n\nSo for a car, 0 is covered when -h <= sT <= -τ? From τ + sT <= 0 <= h + sT\n\nFirst inequality: τ + sT <= 0 => sT <= -τ\n\nSecond: 0 <= h + sT => sT >= -h\n\nSince s > 0, T >=0, sT >=0, but -h could be positive or negative.\n\nsT >= -h and sT <= -τ\n\nSince sT >=0, if -h <=0, sT >= -h is always true if -h <=0, which is h >=0.\n\nSimilarly, if -τ >=0, etc.\n\nBut let's keep it as:\n\nsT >= -h and sT <= -τ\n\nThen T >= ceil(-h/s) and T <= floor(-τ/s) ? Since T integer.\n\nBut sT must be such that the inequalities hold for some T.\n\nFor a car, the times when it covers 0 are when sT is between -h and -τ inclusive.\n\nSince T integer, we need to find T where max( ceil(-h/s) , something) but let's compute for each car the interval of T where it covers 0.\n\nFor a car, it covers 0 when -h <= sT <= -τ\n\nSince s>0, T must satisfy ceil(-h/s) <= T <= floor(-τ/s) ? Let's think.\n\nsT >= -h and sT <= -τ\n\nSo T >= ceil(-h/s)  because T must be integer, and sT >= -h, so T >= ceil(-h/s)\n\nSimilarly, sT <= -τ, so T <= floor(-τ/s) because sT <= -τ, and since sT integer? s and T may not be integer, but s is speed, could be fractional? In the input, speeds are 6,48,12, all integers, and T integer, so sT integer.\n\ns is integer, T integer, so sT integer.\n\nThen sT >= -h and sT <= -τ\n\nBut h and τ are integers, so -h and -τ integers.\n\nsT >= -h means T >= ceil(-h/s) since sT integer.\n\nSimilarly, sT <= -τ means T <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nActually, since sT integer, T must satisfy that sT is integer between -h and -τ inclusive.\n\nBut -h and -τ may not be in order; since for right-moving, h > τ, so -h < -τ, because h > τ implies -h < -τ.\n\nExample: h = -48, τ = -59, then -h = 48, -τ = 59, so -h =48 < 59 = -τ.\n\nSo sT >= -h and sT <= -τ, with -h < -τ.\n\nSo sT must be >= -h and <= -τ, but since -h < -τ, this is impossible if -h < -τ, because sT cannot be both >=48 and <=59? sT >= -h =48 and sT <= -τ=59, so sT between 48 and 59 inclusive.\n\nYes.\n\nGenerally, for a car, the set of T where it covers 0 is when sT is in [ -h, -τ ] , and since -h <= -τ because h >= τ? No.\n\nh and τ: for right-moving, at t=0, span [τ, h] with τ < h, since moving right, tail left, head right.\n\nSo τ < h, thus -τ > -h.\n\nSo -h < -τ.\n\nThen sT >= -h and sT <= -τ.\n\nSince -h < -τ, the interval [ -h, -τ ] is from lower to upper, so sT must satisfy -h <= sT <= -τ.\n\nThen for integer sT, T must satisfy ceil(-h/s) <= T <= floor(-τ/s) ? Let's use inequalities.\n\nsT >= -h ⇒ T >= ceil(-h/s)\n\nsT <= -τ ⇒ T <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nAnd since -h <= -τ, ceil(-h/s) <= floor(-τ/s) must hold for there to be T.\n\nThen T from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s) inclusive.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nNow, for each car, we can find the time interval when it covers x=0.\n\nThen for a freeway, it is unsafe at time T if any car on that freeway covers x=0 at T.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nNow, let's do for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: two cars.\n\nCar A: head=-48, tail=-59, speed=6, right-moving.\n\nSo -h = -(-48) = 48\n\n-τ = -(-59) = 59\n\ns=6\n\nSo sT >= 48 and sT <= 59\n\n6T >= 48 and 6T <= 59\n\nT >= 48/6 = 8\n\nT <= 59/6 = 9.833, so T <= 9 since T integer.\n\n6T <=59, T <= floor(59/6) = floor(9.833) =9\n\n6T >=48, T >= ceil(48/6) = ceil(8) =8\n\nSo T=8,9\n\nFor T=8, 6*8=48 >=48, 48<=59\n\nT=9, 54 >=48, 54<=59\n\nT=10, 60>59, not <=59, so only T=8,9\n\nCar B: head=0, tail=-11, speed=6, right-moving.\n\n- h = -0 =0\n\n- τ = -(-11) =11\n\ns=6\n\nsT >=0 and sT <=11\n\n6T >=0, always true for T>=0\n\n6T <=11, T <= floor(11/6)=1.833, floor=1\n\nSo T=0,1? sT <=11, 6T<=11, T<=1 since T=1,6<=11; T=2,12>11 no\n\nsT >=0, T>=0\n\nSo T=0 and T=1\n\nAt T=0, sT=0 >=0 and 0<=11, yes.\n\nAt T=1,6<=11, yes.\n\nFor freeway 1, car B covers 0 at T=0 and T=1.\n\nCar A covers at T=8,9.\n\nSo freeway 1 is unsafe when either car covers, so unsafe at T=0,1,8,9.\n\nSafe when T not in {0,1,8,9}, for T>=0.\n\nT=0,1,8,9 unsafe.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, so also unsafe at T=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 3: one car: head=-48, tail=-95, speed=48, right-moving.\n\n- h = -(-48) =48\n\n- τ = -(-95) =95\n\ns=48\n\nsT >=48 and sT <=95\n\n48T >=48 => T>=1\n\n48T <=95 => T<= floor(95/48)=1.979, so T=1\n\n48*1=48 >=48 and 48<=95, yes\n\nT=2, 96>95, not <=95\n\nT=0, 0<48, not >=48\n\nSo only T=1 unsafe for freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as 3, unsafe only at T=1.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, speed=12, right-moving.\n\n- h =48\n\n- τ =59\n\ns=12\n\nsT >=48 and sT <=59\n\n12T >=48 => T>=4\n\n12T <=59 => T<= floor(59/12)=4.916, so T=4\n\nT=4, 12*4=48>=48 and 48<=59 yes\n\nT=5, 60>59 no\n\nSo only T=4\n\nSecond car: head=-12, tail=-23, speed=12, right-moving.\n\n- h = -(-12)=12\n\n- τ = -(-23)=23\n\ns=12\n\nsT >=12 and sT <=23\n\n12T >=12 => T>=1\n\n12T <=23 => T<= floor(23/12)=1.916, T=1\n\nT=1,12>=12 and 12<=23 yes\n\nT=2,24>23 no\n\nSo only T=1\n\nThird car: head=24, tail=13, speed=12, right-moving.\n\nTail=13, head=24, so τ=13, h=24\n\n- h = -24\n\n- τ = -13\n\ns=12\n\nsT >= -24 and sT <= -13\n\nsT >= -24, since sT=12T >=0 > -24 always true for T>=0\n\nsT <= -13? 12T <= -13? But 12T >=0, -13<0, so 12T <= -13 impossible for T>=0.\n\nThus, this car never covers x=0, because at t=0 it is from 13 to 24, all positive, moving right, so x increases, never reaches 0.\n\nSimilarly, for all T, span [13+12T, 24+12T] >0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSo only first two cars matter.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at T=1 (from second car) and T=4 (from first car)\n\nT=1 and T=4.\n\nFreeway 6 same as 5, unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nFreeway 7 same, unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nFreeway 8: one car, head=-48, tail=-95, speed=48, right-moving.\n\nSame as freeway 3 and 4: unsafe only at T=1.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe times:\n\ny=1: unsafe T=0,1,8,9\n\ny=2: same as y=1, T=0,1,8,9\n\ny=3: unsafe T=1\n\ny=4: unsafe T=1\n\ny=5: unsafe T=1,4\n\ny=6: unsafe T=1,4\n\ny=7: unsafe T=1,4\n\ny=8: unsafe T=1\n\nThe player starts at t=0, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, player chooses action, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_t is position at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, player is on y_t, and we check if at that turn, for freeway y_t, it is unsafe at time t. But only if y_t between 1 and 8.\n\nIf y_t =0 or 9, no car, so always safe.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, player is on a freeway k (1-8), and k is unsafe at T.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, but y clamped to 0-9, so cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to go to 9, and min steps is 9 if we go up every turn, but we may need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nNow, the sequence: we need to be on each y from 1 to 8 at some turn when it is safe.\n\nBut we can be on a y multiple times, but for min time, probably we go up directly unless blocked.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times per y:\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9 → safe for t=2,3,4,5,6,7 and t>=10? But t=10,11,... but we want min H, so probably small t.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: same as y=1, unsafe 0,1,8,9 safe 2-7,10+\n\ny=3: unsafe t=1 only, so safe t=0,2,3,4,... except t=1\n\ny=4: same, unsafe only t=1, safe otherwise\n\ny=5: unsafe t=1 and t=4, safe t=0,2,3,5,6,...\n\ny=6: same, unsafe 1,4\n\ny=7: same, unsafe 1,4\n\ny=8: unsafe only t=1, safe otherwise\n\nPlayer at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are around t=1 and t=4, and also y=1 and y=2 are unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nFirst, at t=0, player is on y=0, which is safe.\n\nNow, we need to move to y=1 at some point.\n\nBut y=1 is unsafe at t=0 and t=1.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=1 at t=0 or t=1.\n\nAt t=0, we are on y=0, not y=1.\n\nTo be on y=1, we need to be there at some turn when it is safe, i.e., not t=0,1,8,9.\n\nSimilarly for y=2.\n\nNow, since we start at y=0, if we move up at t=0, we go to y=1 at t=1? Let's see the timing.\n\nAt turn t, player position y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt the start of turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nThen during turn t, we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nAnd at turn t, we are on y_t, and we check collision for freeway y_t at time t.\n\nSo at t=0, y_0 = 0, which is not a freeway, so safe. We choose a_0.\n\nIf a_0 = U, then y_1 = y_0 +1 =1\n\nIf a_0 = S, y_1=0\n\nIf a_0 = D, but y=0, so D might not be allowed? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so at y=0, D would make y=-1, but clamped to 0, so if a_t = D at y=0, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, so stay at 0.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U would be clamped to 9.\n\nBut here we start at 0.\n\nNow, if at t=0 we choose U, then y_1 =1.\n\nThen at turn t=1, player is on y_1=1.\n\nBut y=1 is unsafe at t=1, so collision at t=1.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf we choose S at t=0, y_1=0, still at 0.\n\nThen at t=1, on y=0, safe.\n\nBut we need to move up eventually.\n\ny=1 is unsafe at t=0 and t=1, so we cannot be on y=1 at t=0 or t=1.\n\nSimilarly, since we are at y=0 at t=0 and t=1 if we stay, we need to go to y=1 at some t>=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=2, cannot be on at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow, also, for other y, they have unsafe times.\n\nWe need to plan a path.\n\nSince min H, we want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=1 is t=2, since at t=2, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 safe at t=2.\n\nBut we need to be on each y.\n\nLet me think of the turn when we arrive at each y.\n\nSet t as the turn when we are first on y, or something.\n\nDefine the time when we move to a new y.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0\n\nTo be on y=1, we need to choose U at some turn when y_t=0, then y_{t+1}=1, and at turn t+1, we are on y=1, so t+1 must be safe for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=2, after on y=1, choose U, then y_{t'+1}=2 for some t' when on y=1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut we can stay or move down, but for min time, we go up when possible.\n\nAlso, we can skip y or stay, but since we need to go through each, probably not skip.\n\ny must be integer, so we go through all y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 no issue.\n\nNow, let's list for each y, the safe times.\n\ny=1: safe for t not in {0,1,8,9}, so t=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nSimilarly y=2: same, safe t=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\ny=3: unsafe only t=1, so safe for all t except t=1, i.e., t=0,2,3,4,5,...\n\nBut at t=0, we are at y=0, not y=3, so when we are on y=3, it must be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: safe except t=1\n\ny=5: unsafe t=1 and t=4, safe otherwise: t=0,2,3,5,6,7,...\n\ny=6: same, safe except t=1,4\n\ny=7: same, safe except t=1,4\n\ny=8: unsafe only t=1, safe for t=0,2,3,4,5,...\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=1 at some point.\n\nEarliest possible: if we go to y=1 at t=2.\n\nThat is, at some turn, choose U from y=0 to be at y=1 at the next turn.\n\nFor example, at turn t, if y_t=0 and we choose U, then y_{t+1}=1, and at turn t+1, we are on y=1, so t+1 must be safe for y=1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nTo have y=1 at safe time, t+1 >=2, so t+1=2,3,4,5,6,7,... but min, so t+1=2, so at turn t=1, we choose U from y=0? Let's see.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\nIf we choose S or D, we stay at y=0 for t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, we can choose U, then y_2 =1.\n\nThen at turn t=2, we are on y=1, which is safe since y=1 safe at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, from there, we can go to y=2.\n\ny=2 safe at t=2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nSo at turn t=2, on y=1, we can choose U to go to y=2 at t=3.\n\ny_{t+1}, so if at turn t=2, y_2=1, choose U, then y_3=2.\n\nThen at turn t=3, on y=2.\n\nNow, y=2 safe at t=3? t=3 is in 2-7, yes safe.\n\nThen from y=2, we can go to y=3.\n\ny=3 safe except t=1, so at t=3, safe.\n\nAt turn t=3, on y=2, choose U, then y_4=3.\n\nAt turn t=4, on y=3.\n\nNow, y=3 is safe at t=4? Yes, since unsafe only t=1.\n\nThen to y=4: similar, y=4 safe except t=1, so at t=4, safe? Turn t=4, on y=3, choose U, y_5=4.\n\nAt turn t=5, on y=4.\n\ny=4 safe at t=5? Yes.\n\nBut we need to go to y=5.\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=1 and t=4.\n\nAt turn t=5, on y=4, we can choose U to go to y=5 at t=6.\n\nBut y=5 at t=6: is it safe?\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=1 and t=4, so at t=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nCurrently at t=5, y=4? Let's list the turns.\n\nStart t=0, y=0\n\nt=0: choose action, say S or U? We cannot choose U at t=0 because if U, y_1=1, but at t=1, on y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=0, we must choose S or D, but D same as S at y=0, so y_1=0.\n\nt=1: now at turn t=1, y=0, safe (since y=0 no car). We choose U, so y_2=1.\n\nt=2: at turn t=2, on y=1, which is safe (since safe at t=2). Choose U, so y_3=2.\n\nt=3: on y=2, safe (y=2 safe at t=3). Choose U, y_4=3.\n\nt=4: on y=3, safe? y=3 unsafe only t=1, so at t=4, safe. Choose U, y_5=4.\n\nt=5: on y=4, safe (y=4 unsafe only t=1). Choose U, y_6=5.\n\nt=6: on y=5, now y=5 unsafe at t=1 and t=4, so at t=6, safe? t=6 not 1 or 4, so safe. Then we can go to y=6.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe at t=1 and t=4, safe at t=6.\n\nAt turn t=6, on y=5, choose U, y_7=6.\n\nt=7: on y=6, safe (t=7 not 1 or 4). Choose U, y_8=7.\n\nt=8: on y=7, now y=7 unsafe at t=1 and t=4, safe at t=8? t=8 not 1 or 4, so safe. Then choose U, y_9=8.\n\nt=9: on y=8, now y=8 unsafe only at t=1, so at t=9, safe? Yes, since not t=1. Then choose U, y_10=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, which is at turn t=10, y=9.\n\nBut is y=9 the goal? At turn t=10, we are on y=9, which is the target.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? The sequence from t=0 to t=H-1, and at turn t=H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, from t=0 to t=9, we have actions, and at t=10, y=9.\n\nt=H-1 =10? Let's see.\n\nWe start at turn t_1 = t=0.\n\nAfter H turns, we have done actions from t=0 to t=H-1? The sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, we perform the last action, which sets position for turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the position at turn t_1 + H should be (0,9), I think.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" means that at turn t_1 + H, the position is (0,9), I believe.\n\nIn the dynamics, after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at some turn T, it means at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nNow, the actions are from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after these H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=0, so we need y_H =9.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, I have y_10=9, so H=10.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nH=10 turns.\n\nBut let's see if we can do better.\n\nIn the sequence above, I used t=0 to t=9 to go to y=10? No.\n\nt=0: start y=0\n\nt=1: y=0 (after a_0=S or D)\n\nt=2: y=1\n\nt=3: y=2\n\nt=4: y=3\n\nt=5: y=4\n\nt=6: y=5\n\nt=7: y=6\n\nt=8: y=7\n\nt=9: y=8\n\nt=10: y=9\n\nSo at turn 10, y=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9: a_0 to a_9.\n\na_0: at t=0, on y=0, choose S (or D, same), so y_1=0\n\na_1: at t=1, on y=0, choose U, y_2=1\n\na_2: at t=2, on y=1, choose U, y_3=2\n\na_3: at t=3, on y=2, choose U, y_4=3\n\na_4: at t=4, on y=3, choose U, y_5=4\n\na_5: at t=5, on y=4, choose U, y_6=5\n\na_6: at t=6, on y=5, choose U, y_7=6\n\na_7: at t=7, on y=6, choose U, y_8=7\n\na_8: at t=8, on y=7, choose U, y_9=8\n\na_9: at t=9, on y=8, choose U, y_10=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt each turn, when on freeway, check if unsafe.\n\nt=0: y=0, no freeway, safe\n\nt=1: y=0, no freeway, safe\n\nt=2: y=1, freeway 1, at t=2, safe as per earlier (unsafe only 0,1,8,9)\n\nt=3: y=2, freeway 2, at t=3, safe (similar)\n\nt=4: y=3, freeway 3, at t=4, unsafe? y=3 unsafe only t=1, so t=4 safe\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4, unsafe only t=1, t=5 safe\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5, unsafe at t=1 and t=4, t=6 not, safe\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6, unsafe t=1,4, t=7 safe\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe t=1,4, t=8 safe\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe only t=1, t=9 safe\n\nt=10: y=9, no freeway, goal.\n\nAll safe, and H=10, with 10 actions from t=0 to t=9.\n\nBut can we do with less than 10?\n\nMinimal possible is 9, if we go up every turn from t=0.\n\nBut at t=0, if we choose U, y_1=1, then at t=1, on y=1, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we start later, but we start at t=0.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster in some parts.\n\nFor example, from y=0 to y=1, we had to wait until t=2 to be on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5,6,7, they are unsafe at t=4, but in the sequence, we are on y=5 at t=6, which is after t=4.\n\nBut t=4 is unsafe for y=5,6,7, but we are not on them at that time.\n\nNow, can we be on y=1 earlier? No, because at t=1, y=1 unsafe, and we can't be there at t=0.\n\nUnless we move to y=1 at t=2, as above.\n\nSimilarly, at the end, we go to y=9 at t=10.\n\nBut y=8 is unsafe at t=8 or 9? y=8 unsafe only at t=1, so at t=9 safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on y=8 at t=9, which is fine.\n\nBut H=10 turns to reach y=9 at t=10.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce by not staying at y=0 for one turn.\n\nFor example, can we go directly to y=3 or something.\n\nBut we need to pass through y=1 and y=2.\n\nUnless we move faster, but we can only change y by 1 per turn, so we must go through each integer y.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nInstead of staying, we could go to y=1 at t=1, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps for y=1, since it is safe at t=2, but we can be on it later, but min time.\n\nt=2 is earliest possible to be on y=1 safely.\n\nSimilarly, from there to y=2 at t=3, etc.\n\nBut for y=3, it is safe at t=0, but we are not at y=3 at t=0.\n\nWe are at y=0.\n\nTo reach y=3, we need at least 3 up moves.\n\nSimilarly, the unsafe times might allow us to go faster in some segments.\n\nFor example, y=5 is unsafe at t=1 and t=4, but safe at t=0,2,3,5,...\n\nBut at t=0, we are at y=0, not y=5.\n\nIf we can reach y=5 quickly at a safe time.\n\nEarliest to reach y=5: if we go up every turn from t=0, we would be at y=5 at t=5? Let's see.\n\nt=0: y=0, if U, y_1=1 but unsafe at t=1.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo we start by staying at t=0, then at t=1 go to y=1? But t=1 unsafe for y=1.\n\nCannot go to y=1 at t=1.\n\nMust go to y=1 at t=2 or later.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=3 or later.\n\nThen y=3 at t=4 or later.\n\nIn my sequence, y=3 at t=4.\n\ny=4 at t=5.\n\ny=5 at t=6.\n\nBut y=5 is safe at t=2, for example, but at t=2, we are at y=1, not y=5.\n\nWe cannot jump.\n\nThe only way to save time is to avoid the unsafe times by going slower or faster in some parts, but since we have to pass each y, and the constraints are per y per time.\n\nAnother point: at t=4, y=5 is unsafe, but in my sequence, we are not on y=5 at t=4; we are on y=3 at t=4.\n\ny=3 is safe at t=4.\n\nBut we could be on a different y.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 faster if we go directly when possible.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point we can move up multiple times without waiting, but we have to for the beginning.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are both unsafe at t=0 and t=1, so we must delay going to y=1 until t=2 at earliest.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 and y=9: y=8 is unsafe at t=1, but safe at other times, so no problem.\n\nIn the end, to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 at some turn, then go up.\n\ny=8 safe except t=1.\n\nNow, in my sequence, we are on y=8 at t=9, go to y=9 at t=10.\n\nCan we be on y=8 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=8 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=8 is safe? y=8 unsafe only t=1, so t=8 safe, yes.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at t=8, we need to be at y=7 at t=7, and go up, etc.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at t=1 and t=4.\n\nAt t=7, safe.\n\nNow, let's see the earliest we can be at each y.\n\ny=1: earliest at t=2 (since cannot at t=0 or t=1)\n\ny=2: earliest at t=3 (from y=1 at t=2, go up at t=2 to be at y=2 at t=3)\n\ny=3: from y=2 at t=3, go up at t=3 to be at y=3 at t=4\n\ny=4: from y=3 at t=4, go up at t=4 to be at y=4 at t=5\n\ny=5: from y=4 at t=5, go up at t=5 to be at y=5 at t=6\n\nBut y=5 safe at t=2,3,5,... but at t=2, we are at y=1, not y=5.\n\nTo be at y=5 earlier, we need to start from y=0 earlier, but we cannot because of y=1 and y=2.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay at y=0 longer? But that would make it later.\n\nWe go down? But going down might help avoid, but in this case, since we need to go up, going down would waste time.\n\nFor example, at t=0, we go down? But at y=0, down still y=0.\n\nNot useful.\n\nPerhaps for later y.\n\nAnother idea: at t=4, y=5 is unsafe, but we might be on a different y.\n\nBut in the sequence, we are not forced to be on y=5 at t=4.\n\nIn fact, in my sequence, we avoid it.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=5 at t=3, for example.\n\nTo be at y=5 at t=3, we need to have moved up 5 times by t=3.\n\nBut from t=0 to t=3, we have 3 actions: a_0,a_1,a_2, which set y_1,y_2,y_3.\n\ny_0=0.\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy\n\nAfter a_1, y_2 = y_1 + Δy\n\nAfter a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy\n\nTo have y_3=5, we need to increase y by 5 in 3 moves, but each move at most +1, so maximum y_3=3 if all U, but y_3=3 at best.\n\nCannot reach y=5 by t=3.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to reach y=5 is t=5 if we go up every turn from start, but we cannot because of y=1 unsafe at t=1.\n\nWith delay, in my sequence we reach y=5 at t=6.\n\nt=6 is when on y=5.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go to y=1 at t=2, as before.\n\nThen to y=2 at t=3.\n\nThen to y=3 at t=4.\n\nNow, at t=4, we are on y=3.\n\nInstead of going to y=4 at t=5, we could go directly to y=5? No, must go through y=4.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but no, each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=4, we choose U, go to y=4 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, on y=4, choose U, go to y=5 at t=6.\n\nCannot reach y=5 before t=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t=7, etc.\n\nSo the sequence I have seems optimal: we waste one turn at the beginning waiting at y=0, then go up each turn.\n\nH=10, with y_10=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nt_1=0.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9.\n\nIn the sequence: at each turn, the action.\n\nAs above:\n\nTurn 0: S (or D, but S is fine, since D same at y=0)\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nThen after, at turn 10, y=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so t=0 to t=9 for H=10.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose H=9, then actions from t=0 to t=8, and y_9=9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=9.\n\nThen we must be at y=8 at t=8, and go up at t=8.\n\ny_9=9.\n\nNow, at t=8, we must be on y=8, which is freeway 8.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at t=1, so at t=8, safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=8, we need to have reached there.\n\nNow, from start, to go from y=0 to y=8 in 8 turns? From t=0 to t=8, 8 actions to increase y by 8, so we must go up every turn, no staying or down.\n\nBut at t=0, if we choose U, y_1=1, but at t=1, on y=1, unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we choose S at t=0, y_1=0, then at t=1, on y=0, choose U, y_2=1, but at t=2, on y=1, which is safe only if t=2 safe.\n\ny=1 safe at t=2, yes.\n\nBut then we need to go to y=2 at t=3, etc., up to y=8 at t=8.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=2, we go U at t=2 to y=3? No.\n\nAt turn t=2, on y=1, choose U, then y_3=2.\n\nThen at t=3, on y=2, choose U, y_4=3.\n\nAt t=4, on y=3, choose U, y_5=4.\n\nAt t=5, on y=4, choose U, y_6=5.\n\nNow at t=6, on y=5.\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=1 and t=4, not t=6, safe.\n\nThen choose U, y_7=6.\n\nAt t=7, on y=6, unsafe at t=1,4? t=7 safe, choose U, y_8=7.\n\nAt t=8, on y=7, safe? y=7 unsafe t=1,4, t=8 safe, then we need to be at y=8 to go to y=9, but at t=8 we are on y=7, so if we choose U, y_9=8, not 9.\n\ny_9=8, then we need another action to go to y=9.\n\nBut for H=9, we want y_9=9, but here y_9=8.\n\nIn this sequence, with actions from t=0 to t=8, but y_9=8, not 9.\n\nWe need to reach y=8 earlier.\n\nTo have y_8=8.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to t=7 set y_1 to y_8.\n\ny_0=0.\n\nAfter a_0 to a_7, y_8.\n\nTo have y_8=8, need 8 up moves in 8 actions.\n\nBut at t=0, if we choose U, y_1=1, but at t=1, collision on y=1.\n\nIf we choose S at t=0, y_1=0, then we have only 7 actions left (a1 to a7) to go from y=0 to y=8, which requires 8 up moves, impossible with 7 actions.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y=8 by t=8 with no collision.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10.\n\nIn my sequence, H=10 works.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, there is a car at (24,13,right,12), which I said never covers 0, correct.\n\nAnd for y=1 and y=2, unsafe at t=8,9, but in my sequence, at t=8, we are on y=7, not y=1 or 2, and at t=9, on y=8, not y=1 or 2.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=1 at t=3, for example, but that would be later, not better.\n\nSo H=10 seems minimal.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=0, I chose S, but we could choose D, same effect.\n\nBut S is better, I think.\n\nNow, the answer should be the actions.\n\nIn the format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nWith t_1=0.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nH=10, actions from t=0 to t=9.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to 9, which is 10 actions.\n\nTo write in box.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point we are on unsafe.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=0, safe\n\nt=2: y=1, freeway 1, t=2, not unsafe (unsafe 0,1,8,9), safe\n\nt=3: y=2, freeway 2, t=3, safe\n\nt=4: y=3, freeway 3, t=4, not t=1, safe\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4, t=5, not t=1, safe\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5, t=6, not t=1 or 4, safe\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6, t=7, safe\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7, t=8, safe\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8, t=9, not t=1, safe\n\nt=10: y=9, goal.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5, at t=4 unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 0\\) for one turn to avoid the unsafe conditions at \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) at turns \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = 1\\), and then moving up each subsequent turn. The car positions and unsafe times have been verified to ensure no collisions occur during the sequence.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- At turn \\(t = 0\\), the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway). Choosing \\(S\\) (stay) keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\) for turn \\(t = 1\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 1\\), the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).

Choosing \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn \\(t = 3\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 3\\), the player is at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe at \\(t = 3\\) as unsafe only at \\(t = 0, 1, 8, 9\\)). Choosing \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn \\(t = 4\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 4\\), the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe at \\(t = 4\\) as unsafe only at \\(t = 1\\)). Choosing \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(t = 5\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 5\\), the player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe at \\(t = 5\\) as unsafe only at \\(t = 1\\)).

Choosing \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn \\(t = 7\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 7\\), the player is at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe at \\(t = 7\\) as unsafe only at \\(t = 1, 4\\)). Choosing \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn \\(t = 8\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 8\\), the player is at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe at \\(t = 8\\) as unsafe only at \\(t = 1, 4\\)).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, at the turn when I'm at a certain y, if there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that turn, I crash. But note that when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only check for collision on the freeway I'm currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1, which is 1, and I need to find where they are at future turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t_1 = 1.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8:\n\n- Freeway 1: two cars: \n  - First: h = -42, τ = -53, d = right, s = 6\n  - Second: h = 6, τ = -5, d = right, s = 6? Wait, τ = -5, h=6? But if it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail, so [τ, h] = [-5, 6]? The notation says for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so it should be from tail to head increasing.\n\nLet's clarify the car span definition.\n\nFor left-moving: span is [h, τ] with h > τ, I assume? It says span(t1) = [h, τ] for left-moving, and it moves left, so h and τ decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ < h, and both increase with time.\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway 1, it has (-42, -53, right, 6) and (6, -5, right, 6).\n\nFor the first car: (-42, -53, right, 6). Since direction is right, span should be [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? But it's written as (h, τ) = (-42, -53), which might be a bit confusing.\n\nLook at the header: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be on the right, so h > τ.\n\nSimilarly for left, h should be on the left, so h < τ? No.\n\nLet's see the definition:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nIf it's moving left, the head is on the left, so h should be greater than τ, and as it moves left, both decrease, so span [h, τ] with h > τ, I think.\n\nFor example, if h=5, τ=0, moving left, at time t, position h - s(t-t1), τ - s(t-t1), so if s>0, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and it moves right, so τ and h increase.\n\nSo [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the input, for a car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but the order might not match the span.\n\nFor right-moving, head h is larger, tail τ is smaller, so (h, τ) with h > τ.\n\nFor left-moving, head h is smaller? No.\n\nProblem: the definition says for left-moving, span is [h, τ], and for right, [τ, h].\n\nBut in the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI think \"head\" means the front of the car, so for right-moving, head is the right end, for left-moving, head is the left end.\n\nSo for a right-moving car, head h > tail τ, and span is [τ, h].\n\nFor left-moving car, head h < tail τ, and span is [h, τ].\n\nIn this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the data.\n\nLook at freeway 1: both right, so for first car, h = -42, τ = -53, since right, h > τ? -42 > -53, yes.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=6, τ=-5, 6 > -5, yes.\n\nFreeway 2 same as 1.\n\nFreeway 3: (0, -47, right, 48), h=0, τ=-47, 0 > -47, right.\n\nFreeway 4 same.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars, all right: (-36,-47,right,12), (0,-11,right,12), (36,25,right,12). h>τ for each.\n\nSimilarly, 6 and 7 same as 5.\n\nFreeway 8: (0,-47,right,48)\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so span at time t is [τ + s(t-t1), h + s(t-t1)] for each car.\n\nt1 = 1.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T at that turn, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at time T, meaning min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nSince span is [left, right] or [right, left], but for right-moving, it's [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], and since τ < h, it's increasing.\n\nSimilarly for left, but here all right.\n\nSo for a car, at time T, the left end is τ + s(T-1), right end is h + s(T-1), and 0 is in span if τ + s(T-1) <= 0 <= h + s(T-1).\n\nNow, I start at turn t1=1, position y=0. I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y clamped to [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but avoiding collisions when on those y's at the turn when I'm there.\n\nThe key point is that when I move to a new y, I am not on that new y until the next turn, so for collision, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I check cars on freeway y_T at that exact turn T.\n\nIf I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I am on y, so I check freeway y at turn T. Then at turn T+1, I am on y+1, so I check freeway y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, I check the same freeway multiple times.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, so at some turn H, y_H = 9.\n\nSince I start at turn 1, y=0, and I need to get to (0,9), but x is always 0, I think, since player position is (0,y), and cars are on freeways, but x varies for cars.\n\nPlayer is at x=0 always? The position is (x,y), but in the player update, it only mentions y, and x is not mentioned, so I think player is always at x=0, and moves only in y direction.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player only changes y, x is fixed at 0.\n\nCars are on horizontal freeways at different y, moving in x-direction.\n\nCollision when player is at (0,y) and at that turn, on freeway y, there is a car where 0 is in its span, meaning the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=0, turn 1, I need to move up eventually.\n\ny=0 is safe, no freeway.\n\nAt turn 1, I am at y=0. I can choose action: if I go U, I move to y=1 at turn 2. If I stay S, I stay at y=0, but I need to move, so probably better to move up.\n\nBut I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway y=1 to 8, at which turns a car is at x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find the times T when for some car on that freeway, τ + s(T-1) <= 0 <= h + s(T-1).\n\nSince t1=1, time T, the offset is T-1.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1 = T - 1.\n\nSo at time T, for a car, left end = τ + s * Δt, right end = h + s * Δt, and 0 in span if left <= 0 <= right, i.e., τ + s Δt <= 0 and 0 <= h + s Δt.\n\nSince h and τ are such that τ < h for right-moving, so the inequalities are:\n\nτ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n- h / s <= Δt <= -τ / s ? Let's solve.\n\nFrom τ + s Δt <= 0, so s Δt <= -τ, so Δt <= -τ / s\n\nFrom 0 <= h + s Δt, so s Δt >= -h, so Δt >= -h / s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nAnd since τ <= h, -τ/s >= -h/s, so Δt must satisfy:\n\n- h / s <= Δt <= -τ / s\n\nΔt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nΔt = T - 1.\n\nNow, for each car on each freeway, I can find the interval of Δt when it covers x=0.\n\nThen for the freeway, if any car covers x=0 at that Δt, it's occupied.\n\nBut multiple cars, so I need the union over cars.\n\nThen, for each freeway, I can find the set of Δt when it is unsafe, i.e., some car at x=0.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nThen, when I am on that freeway at turn T, Δt = T-1, it must be safe at that Δt.\n\nNow, I start at turn 1, y=0, Δt=0 for T=1.\n\nBut at T=1, y=0, no freeway, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is safe.\n\nThe path: I need to go from y=0 to y=9, spending some time on each intermediate y, but I can skip some by moving fast, or stay to wait.\n\nSince I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, min turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9 turns: up every turn, but I might need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nBut detour down might not help since I need to go up eventually, and y=0 and y=9 are safe, so probably no need to go down, only up or stay.\n\nGoing down from y=0 is impossible since y=0, D would try to go to y=-1, but y clamped to 0, so D at y=0 does nothing, I think.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so if at y=0 and a_t = D, Δy = -1, but y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, so stay at 0.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U would stay at 9.\n\nSo actions D at y=0 or U at y=9 have no effect, only S or opposite move.\n\nBut since I need to go up, probably no point going down, except perhaps to avoid being on a freeway at bad time, but since I can stay at y=0, which is safe, I can wait there.\n\nSimilarly at y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is goal, once there, stop.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and their \"danger intervals\" for Δt.\n\nΔt = T - 1, and T is turn number.\n\nAt turn T, Δt = T - 1.\n\nFor each freeway, unsafe if at that Δt, any car has x=0 covered.\n\nFreeway 1: k=1, cars:\n\nCar A: h=-42, τ=-53, s=6, right\n\nΔt min = -h/s = -(-42)/6 = 42/6 = 7\n\nΔt max = -τ/s = -(-53)/6 = 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so Δt from 7 to 8 inclusive? Since Δt integer.\n\n- h/s = -(-42)/6 = 42/6 = 7\n\n- τ/s = -(-53)/6 = 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so Δt <= 8.833, since Δt integer, Δt <= 8\n\nAnd Δt >= ceil(-h/s) ? -h/s =7, exact, so Δt >=7\n\nΔt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(53/6) = floor(8.833) =8\n\nSo for Δt from 7 to 8 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, car B: h=6, τ=-5, s=6\n\n- h/s = -6/6 = -1\n\n- τ/s = -(-5)/6 = 5/6 ≈0.833\n\nSo Δt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-(-1))? -h/s = - (6)/6 = -1, so Δt >= -1\n\n- τ/s = -(-5)/6 = 5/6, so Δt <= floor(5/6) = 0? Since 5/6<1, floor=0\n\nΔt must satisfy Δt >= -h/s and Δt <= -τ/s\n\n- h/s = -6/6 = -1\n\n- τ/s = -(-5)/6 = 5/6 ≈0.833\n\nSo Δt >= -1 and Δt <= 0.833, so since Δt integer, Δt = -1, 0\n\nBut Δt = T-1, T is turn, T>=1, so Δt >=0? T=1, Δt=0; T=2, Δt=1, etc.\n\nΔt >=0, since T>=1, Δt>=0.\n\nT starts from 1, so Δt = T-1 >=0.\n\nFor car B, Δt >= -1 and Δt <=0.833, but Δt >=0, so only Δt=0.\n\nSimilarly, for car A, Δt=7,8.\n\nNow for freeway 1, unsafe when car A or car B has x=0.\n\nCar B at Δt=0, car A at Δt=7,8.\n\nSo unsafe at Δt=0,7,8.\n\nΔt=0: T=1\n\nΔt=7: T=8\n\nΔt=8: T=9\n\nT= turn number.\n\nAt turn T, Δt = T-1.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe at turns: when Δt=0, T=1; Δt=7, T=8; Δt=8, T=9.\n\nT=1,8,9.\n\nBut at turn T, for freeway to be unsafe, but we care about when we are on the freeway.\n\nNow, similarly for other freeways.\n\nFirst, let's list all.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, since cars identical: unsafe at T=1,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 3: k=3, car: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nh=0, τ=-47, s=48\n\n- h/s = -0/48 =0\n\n- τ/s = -(-47)/48 = 47/48 ≈0.979\n\nSo Δt >= 0 and Δt <= 0.979, so Δt=0\n\nThus unsafe only at Δt=0, T=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as 3, unsafe at T=1.\n\nNow freeway 5: k=5, three cars.\n\nFirst car: h=-36, τ=-47, s=12\n\n- h/s = -(-36)/12 = 36/12=3\n\n- τ/s = -(-47)/12 = 47/12 ≈3.9167\n\nSo Δt >=3 and Δt <=3.9167, so Δt=3\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, s=12\n\n- h/s = -0/12=0\n\n- τ/s = -(-11)/12=11/12≈0.9167\n\nΔt >=0 and Δt <=0.9167, so Δt=0\n\nThird car: h=36, τ=25, s=12? τ=25, h=36, both positive.\n\n- h/s = -36/12 = -3\n\n- τ/s = -25/12 ≈ -2.083\n\nΔt >= -h/s = -(-3) =3? Δt >= ceil(-h/s) but -h/s = -(-36)/12? -h/s = - (36)/12 = -3\n\nΔt >= -h/s = -3\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -25/12 ≈ -2.083\n\nSo Δt >= -3 and Δt <= -2.083, so Δt = -3, -2? But Δt >=0, so no solution? Let's see.\n\n- h/s = -36/12 = -3\n\n- τ/s = -25/12 ≈ -2.083\n\nΔt must satisfy Δt >= -h/s = -(-3)? No:\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nΔt >= -h / s\n\nΔt <= -τ / s\n\nHere h=36, s=12, so -h/s = -36/12 = -3\n\nτ=25, s=12, -τ/s = -25/12 ≈ -2.083\n\nSo Δt >= -3 and Δt <= -2.083\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt = -3 or -2? But Δt >=0, so no integer Δt satisfies. Thus this car never covers x=0, because at Δt=0, left end = τ + s*0 =25, right end=36, both >0, so x=0 not covered. Similarly for other times.\n\nIndeed, the car is at [25,36] at Δt=0, moving right, so it never reaches x=0 since min x is 25 at t1, increasing.\n\nSo only first and second car matter for freeway 5.\n\nFirst car: unsafe Δt=3\n\nSecond car: unsafe Δt=0\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe at Δt=0 and Δt=3, i.e., T=1 and T=4 (since Δt=3, T=4)\n\nΔt=0, T=1; Δt=3, T=1+3=4.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as 5, since identical cars, unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5, unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nNow freeway 8: k=8, car (0,-47,right,48), same as freeway 3, unsafe at T=1.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, unsafe at which turns (T):\n\n- y=1: unsafe at T=1,8,9\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=1,8,9 (same as y=1)\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=1\n\n- y=4: unsafe at T=1\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=1,4\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=1,4\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=1,4\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=1\n\ny=8 has only one car, unsafe at T=1.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at T=1 to y=9, avoiding being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on y, and y is between 1 and 8, and T is in the unsafe set for that y, I crash.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nI start at T=1, y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to increase y by 9, min turns is 9, if I go up every turn: U,U,U,...,U, 9 times.\n\nStart T=1, y=0\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1} = y_t + a_t, but at turn t, I am at y_t, choose a_t, then at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAt turn t, I am on freeway y_t (if y_t between 1 and 8), and check collision at that turn.\n\nFor the path: at each turn, y_t must be safe.\n\nStart: t=1, y=0, safe.\n\nI want to go to y=9.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn:\n\nt=1: y=0, safe, choose U, then y=1 at t=2\n\nt=2: y=1, now must check if safe at t=2.\n\nFor y=1, unsafe at T=1,8,9. t=2 not in {1,8,9}, so should be safe? Let's see the unsafe turns.\n\ny=1 unsafe at T=1,8,9.\n\nT=2 not unsafe, so at t=2, y=1, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=3: y=2, y=2 unsafe at T=1,8,9, t=3 not in, safe.\n\nt=4: y=3, y=3 unsafe only at T=1, t=4 not, safe.\n\nt=5: y=4, unsafe only at T=1, t=5 safe.\n\nt=6: y=5, y=5 unsafe at T=1,4. t=6 not, safe.\n\nt=7: y=6, unsafe at T=1,4, t=7 safe.\n\nt=8: y=7, y=7 unsafe at T=1,4, t=8 not 1 or 4, safe.\n\nt=9: y=8, y=8 unsafe only at T=1, t=9 not, safe.\n\nThen t=10: y=9, safe, goal.\n\nAfter 9 up actions, from t=1 to t=9, actions U each, then at t=10, y=9.\n\nLet's list turns and y:\n\nt=1: y=0, action U (to go to y=1)\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} set.\n\nAt turn t=1: position y=0, choose action a1.\n\nAfter a1, at turn t=2, position y2 = y1 + Δy1.\n\nAt each turn t, we have position y_t, and we check collision based on y_t and t.\n\nThen choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFor min H, we want min turns to reach y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nt=1: y1=0, safe (not freeway), choose a1=U, so y2=1\n\nt=2: y2=1, now on freeway 1, at t=2, is it unsafe? y=1 unsafe at T=1,8,9. t=2 not in, so safe. Choose a2=U, y3=2\n\nt=3: y3=2, on freeway 2, unsafe at T=1,8,9, t=3 not, safe. a3=U, y4=3\n\nt=4: y4=3, on freeway 3, unsafe only at T=1, t=4≠1, safe. a4=U, y5=4\n\nt=5: y5=4, freeway 4, unsafe only at T=1, t=5≠1, safe. a5=U, y6=5\n\nt=6: y6=5, freeway 5, unsafe at T=1,4. t=6≠1 and ≠4, so safe? t=6, Δt for freeway: at turn T, we use Δt=T-1.\n\nFor y=5, unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nT=1: Δt=0, T=4: Δt=3.\n\nt=6, Δt=5, not unsafe, so safe. a6=U, y7=6\n\nt=7: y7=6, freeway 6, unsafe at T=1,4, t=7 not, safe. a7=U, y8=7\n\nt=8: y8=7, freeway 7, unsafe at T=1,4, t=8 not, safe. a8=U, y9=8\n\nt=9: y9=8, freeway 8, unsafe only at T=1, t=9≠1, safe. a9=U, y10=9\n\nt=10: y10=9, safe, goal reached.\n\nSo in 9 actions, from t=1 to t=9, we go to y=9 at t=10.\n\nH is the number of turns? The sequence has actions from t=1 to t=9, H=9 actions, reach at turn t=10.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), which is at turn after actions.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nt_1=1.\n\nIn this case, with all U, we reach in 9 turns, no collision.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=8 or something?\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at T=1,4, t=8 not, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut for y=1 and y=2, unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nIn our path, at T=8, we are on y=7, not y=1 or 2.\n\nAt T=9, we are on y=8, not y=1 or 2.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe turns.\n\nFor example, at t=2, y=1: y=1 unsafe only at T=1,8,9. t=2 is not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 1, at t=1, it was unsafe, but at t=1, we were at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nSo the path seems fine.\n\nBut is there a way to do in less than 9? No, because from y=0 to y=9, must increase by 9, each action changes y by at most 1, so min 9 actions.\n\nThus H=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so H=9.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision condition.\n\nAt turn T, if on freeway y, and 0 in span for some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIn our case, for each point, it was safe.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=1, H=9, so actions for turn 1 to turn 9.\n\nEach action U.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 1, we start at y=0, choose U, go to y=1 at t=2.\n\nAt turn 9, we are at y=8, choose U, go to y=9 at t=10.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me check if at any point we might be unsafe.\n\nFor example, at t=8: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nt=8, not 1 or 4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=9: y=8, freeway 8 unsafe only at T=1, not t=9, safe.\n\nNow, what about the cars on freeway 1 at t=8: unsafe, but we are not on y=1 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", and we did.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if staying or something, but no need.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, unsafe at t=4.\n\nIn our path, at t=4, we are on y=3? Let's see:\n\nt=1: y=0\n\nt=2: y=1\n\nt=3: y=2\n\nt=4: y=3\n\nAt t=4, y=3, freeway 3, which is unsafe only at t=1, so at t=4, safe.\n\nFreeway 5 is unsafe at t=4, but we are on y=3, not y=5.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1\n\nt_1=1, H=9, so turns 1 to 9.\n\nActions all U.\n\nBut let me write.\n\nPerhaps I should list.\n\nBut is there a problem with y=1 at t=1? But at t=1, we are not on y=1, we are on y=0.\n\nAt t=2, we are on y=1, but t=2 not unsafe time for y=1.\n\nUnsafe times are t=1,8,9 for y=1.\n\nt=2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 3 at t=1, but we not on it.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1, car B: at t=1, Δt=0, span: for car B, h=6, τ=-5, s=6, so left end τ + s*0 = -5, right end h + s*0=6, so at t=1, x from -5 to 6, includes 0, so unsafe at t=1.\n\nBut at t=1, we are at y=0, not on freeway 1, so no collision.\n\nAt t=2, for freeway 1, car positions: Δt=1, left end = τ + s*1 = -5 +6=1, right end=6+6=12, so span [1,12], x=0 not included, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, car A at Δt=1: left= -53 +6*1= -47, right= -42+6= -36, both negative, not include 0.\n\nSo safe at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nAt t=8, for freeway 1, Δt=7, car A: left= -53 +6*7= -53+42= -11, right= -42+42=0? h=-42, s=6, Δt=7, right end h + s Δt = -42 + 42=0, left τ + s Δt = -53 +42= -11, so span [-11,0], so includes x=0? 0 is included, since <=0 and >= left? -11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, Δt=8, car A: left= -53 +48= -5? 6*8=48, -53+48= -5, right= -42+48=6, span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nBut in our path, we are not on y=1 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nAt t=8, we are on y=7, etc.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,0) turn 1, and after 9 actions, at turn 10, (0,9).\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from turn 1 to turn 9.\n\nNow, output:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., with t_1 given as 1.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nSince H=9.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? No, because must increase y by 9.\n\nUnless I can skip some, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so no.\n\nPerhaps by staying, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nSo min H=9.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 1, if I stay, but that doesn't help, since I need to move up.\n\nSo all U is fine.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 5 at t=4: unsafe.\n\nBut in our path, at t=4, we are on y=3, not y=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, but we are on y=3 at t=4.\n\nFreeway 3 is safe at t=4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list the y at each turn to confirm.\n\nTurn t | y_t | action a_t | next y\n\nt=1: y=0, a=U, y2=1\n\nt=2: y=1, a=U, y3=2\n\nt=3: y=2, a=U, y4=3\n\nt=4: y=3, a=U, y5=4\n\nt=5: y=4, a=U, y6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, a=U, y7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, a=U, y8=7\n\nt=8: y=7, a=U, y9=8\n\nt=9: y=8, a=U, y10=9\n\nAt each t, y_t is safe as above.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=5, freeway 5, unsafe at t=1 and t=4, not t=6, so safe.\n\nAt t=4, y=3, freeway 3, unsafe only t=1, not t=4, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, and the actions are all U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it out.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", let's see.\n\nIt says: a sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1 +1}, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nIn this case, t_1=1, H=9, so actions for turn 1 to turn 9, which is a_{1} to a_{9}.\n\nAll U.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 1: a_{1} = U\n\nTurn 2: a_{2} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving to new y.\n\nIn the collision note, it says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in our case, since we are moving each turn, at each turn we are on one freeway, and we move to next, so we are never on two freeways at once.\n\nFor example, at turn T, we are on y_T, we check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen we move to y_{T+1}, at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo the note is about not being on the new freeway until the next turn, which is consistent.\n\nIn our path, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut perhaps for some freeway, at certain times it is unsafe, but we avoid by not being there.\n\nIn this case, with all up, we are never on a freeway at its unsafe time, except for times when we are not there.\n\nFor example, y=1 unsafe at t=1,8,9, but at t=1 we are at y=0, at t=8 we are at y=7, at t=9 we are at y=8, so not on y=1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me see if I can do in less, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps by starting with stay, but that would make H larger.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be H=9 with all U actions.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nI think:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it might be written as lines.\n\nSince it's text, perhaps:\n\nTurn 1: a_{1} = U\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., without the =, I think.\n\nIn the answer format example:\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\"\n\nSo I think:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAnd since t_1=1, but in general.\n\nSo for this case.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 3 at t=1, it has a car with h=0, τ=-47, s=48, at Δt=0, left= -47, right=0, so 0 included, unsafe.\n\nBut we not on it.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 9, with all actions being \"U\" (move up). This sequence ensures that the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10 without colliding with any cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- At each turn, the player's position is checked for collision with cars on the current freeway (if applicable).\n- The unsafe turns for each freeway (when a car covers \\(x = 0\\)) are:\n  - Freeway 1: Turns 1, 8, 9\n  - Freeway 2: Turns 1, 8, 9\n  - Freeway 3: Turn 1\n  - Freeway 4: Turn 1\n  - Freeway 5: Turns 1, 4\n  - Freeway 6: Turns 1, 4\n  - Freeway 7: Turns 1, 4\n  - Freeway 8: Turn 1\n- The sequence of positions and actions:\n  - Turn 1: Position \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway). Action \\(U\\), next position \\(y = 1\\).\n  - Turn 2: Position \\(y = 1\\). Freeway 1 is unsafe only at turns 1, 8, 9; turn 2 is safe. Action \\(U\\), next position \\(y = 2\\).\n  - Turn 3: Position \\(y = 2\\). Freeway 2 is unsafe only at turns 1, 8, 9; turn 3 is safe. Action \\(U\\), next position \\(y = 3\\).\n  - Turn 4: Position \\(y = 3\\). Freeway 3 is unsafe only at turn 1; turn 4 is safe. Action \\(U\\), next position \\(y = 4\\).\n  - Turn 5: Position \\(y = 4\\). Freeway 4 is unsafe only at turn 1; turn 5 is safe. Action \\(U\\), next position \\(y = 5\\).\n  - Turn 6: Position \\(y = 5\\). Freeway 5 is unsafe at turns 1 and 4; turn 6 is safe. Action \\(U\\), next position \\(y = 6\\).\n  - Turn 7: Position \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 is unsafe at turns 1 and 4; turn 7 is safe. Action \\(U\\), next position \\(y = 7\\).\n  - Turn 8: Position \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns 1 and 4; turn 8 is safe. Action \\(U\\), next position \\(y = 8\\).\n  - Turn 9: Position \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 is unsafe only at turn 1; turn 9 is safe. Action \\(U\\), next position \\(y = 9\\).\n  - Turn 10: Position \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached, safe).\n\nSince the player moves up every turn and is never on a freeway during its unsafe turns, no collision occurs. The minimum \\(H = 9\\) is achieved because \\(y\\) must increase by 9, and each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 9\\) is all \"U\".\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) at turn t_1 = 2. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T (between 1 and 8) and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=2, and for future turns, they move based on their speed and direction. Left-moving cars decrease their position, right-moving increase.\n\nI need to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 2 to turn 2+H-1 such that at turn 2+H-1, y=9.\n\nSince the player starts at y=1 and needs to get to y=9, the minimum number of moves if there were no cars would be 8 up moves, but with cars, it might take longer because we might need to wait or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut moving down might not be efficient since we need to go up, so probably we should minimize downward moves.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn t_1=2.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to understand the span. For right-moving cars, span is [tail, head] since head is larger, and for left-moving, it's [head, tail] with head smaller? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIt says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", and for left-moving, it moves left, so h and τ decrease.\n\nBut in the span, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and since it's moving left, h should be the front, which for left-moving would be smaller if we think of position increasing to the right.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so τ < h.\n\nIn the freeway table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nBut in the span definition, for right-moving, it's [τ, h], meaning from tail to head, with tail < head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ], with h < τ since it's moving left.\n\nIn the data, for example, freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving, tail should be less than head? -36 and -47, -36 > -47, so if tail is -47, head is -36, then tail < head, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (12, 1, right, 6), 1 to 12, tail=1, head=12.\n\nFor left-moving, if there was one, it might be like (10, 20, left, something), meaning head=10, tail=20, so span [10,20] decreasing.\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: both cars right-moving.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: (48,1,right,48) — head=48, tail=1, direction right, speed 48.\n\nSpeed 48? That's fast.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3? (48,1,right,48)\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\n(48,37,right,12) — tail=37, head=48? 37 to 48.\n\nBut tail should be less than head, 37<48, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (-24,-35,right,12), tail=-35, head=-24.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 similar.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? Listed as (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: (48,1,right,48)\n\nNow, the player is at y=1 at turn 2.\n\nBut y=1 is a freeway, and there are cars on it.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to y=k, I assume.\n\nSo at turn 2, player is on y=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nNow, collision if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, for freeway y_T, if 0 in span(T).\n\nPlayer at turn T is on y_T, and we check cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, at turn 2, player is on y=1.\n\nFreeway 1 has cars: (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nSpan at turn 2: for first car, since right-moving, span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]? Tail is -47, head is -36, so positions from -47 to -36.\n\nSimilarly, second car: tail=1, head=12, so [1,12].\n\nNow, is 0 in any span? 0 is not in [-47,-36], and not in [1,12], so at turn 2, no collision yet, but player is on y=1, and 0 is at x=0, which is not covered, so safe.\n\nBut we need to move to avoid future collisions.\n\nPlayer needs to go to y=9.\n\nFirst, let's think about the path.\n\nSince we need to go up, and cars are moving, we might need to time when to cross each freeway.\n\nBut the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally, so at each turn, when player is on a freeway, we check if x=0 is occupied by a car at that turn.\n\nPlayer is always at x=0, I think, since position is (0, y_t).\n\nSo for each freeway, at each turn, we can compute if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k, at turn T, if there is a car such that 0 is between the min and max of the span at T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving cars, because at T, position increases.\n\nFrom update: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but no left here.\n\nt_1 is 2.\n\nSo for each car, at turn T, the span is [τ + s(T-2), h + s(T-2)] for right-moving cars.\n\nThen 0 is covered if min <= 0 <= max of some span.\n\nSince it's a closed interval, 0 in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we have multiple cars, so we need to check for each car.\n\nBut for collision, it's if any car on that freeway covers 0 at turn T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1, turn 2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 8, since from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps up.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be more.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at which turns x=0 is occupied.\n\nThat is, for each k, find the times when it is unsafe to be on y=k.\n\nThen the player must not be on y=k at those turns when it is unsafe.\n\nBut player moves vertically, so we need to sequence the moves.\n\nSince player can stay or move up/down, we can choose when to be on each row.\n\nBut we start at y=1 turn 2, end at y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me denote t as the turn number, with t=2 being current.\n\nPlayer position y_t for t >=2.\n\ny_2 =1.\n\nWe want y_{2+H-1} =9 for some H.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=2 to t=2+H-1, that's H actions, from time 2 to time 2+H-1, so positions from y_2 to y_{2+H-1}.\n\ny_{2+H-1} =9.\n\nNow, for each freeway k from 1 to 8, find the set of times t when being on y=k is unsafe, i.e., some car covers x=0.\n\nThen for the path, for each t, y_t must not be in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} if that freeway is unsafe at t, or if y_t=0 or 9, no freeway, so always safe? y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1, which is a freeway.\n\nNow, let's compute for each k, the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1.\n\nCars: (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nt_1=2.\n\nFor first car: tail τ = -47, head h = -36, s=6, right.\n\nAt time t, span: [τ + s(t-2), h + s(t-2)] = [-47 + 6(t-2), -36 + 6(t-2)]\n\n0 covered if -47 + 6(t-2) <= 0 <= -36 + 6(t-2)\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=1, h=12, s=6\n\n[1 + 6(t-2), 12 + 6(t-2)]\n\n0 covered if 1 + 6(t-2) <= 0 <= 12 + 6(t-2)\n\nNow, for first car: low = -47 + 6(t-2), high = -36 + 6(t-2)\n\nSet low <= 0 <= high\n\n-47 + 6(t-2) <= 0 => 6(t-2) <= 47 => t-2 <= 47/6 ≈ 7.833, so t <= 9.833, since t integer, t <=9\n\nAnd 0 <= -36 + 6(t-2) => 36 <= 6(t-2) => 6 <= t-2 => t >=8\n\nSo for t from 8 to 9 inclusive? Let's see:\n\nt-2 <= 47/6 ≈7.833, t<=9.833, so t<=9 since t integer\n\nt-2 >= 36/6 =6, so t>=8\n\nSo unsafe when t=8 and t=9.\n\nSimilarly, high >=0: -36 +6(t-2) >=0 => 6(t-2) >=36 => t-2>=6 => t>=8\n\nLow <=0: -47+6(t-2) <=0 => 6(t-2) <=47 => t-2 <=7.833 => t<=9\n\nSo t=8,9.\n\nNow second car on k=1: [1 + 6(t-2), 12 + 6(t-2)]\n\nLow <=0 <= high\n\n1 + 6(t-2) <=0 => 6(t-2) <= -1, which is impossible since t>=2, t-2>=0, 6(t-2)>=0, so low >=1>0, so never <=0.\n\nSimilarly, high >=0 always since min is 1 at t=2.\n\nSo second car never covers x=0, because at t=2, it starts at [1,12], all positive.\n\nAs t increases, it moves right, so always positive, never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only unsafe at t=8 and t=9 due to first car.\n\nNow freeway k=2.\n\nCars: same as k=1? From table: (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nIdentical to freeway 1.\n\nSo unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nNow freeway k=3.\n\nCars: (48,1,right,48)\n\nTail τ=1, head h=48, s=48, right.\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s(t-2), h + s(t-2)] = [1 + 48(t-2), 48 + 48(t-2)]\n\n0 covered if 1 + 48(t-2) <= 0 <= 48 + 48(t-2)\n\nFirst, low <=0: 1 + 48(t-2) <=0 => 48(t-2) <= -1, impossible for t>=2.\n\nSimilarly, high >=0 always.\n\nSo never covers 0. Always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway k=4: same as k=3, (48,1,right,48), same thing, never covers 0.\n\nNow freeway k=5.\n\nCars: (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12\n\nSpan: [-35 + 12(t-2), -24 + 12(t-2)]\n\n0 covered if -35 + 12(t-2) <= 0 <= -24 + 12(t-2)\n\nSo low <=0: -35 +12(t-2) <=0 => 12(t-2) <=35 => t-2 <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so t<=4.916, t<=4 since integer? t-2 <= 2.916, t<=4.916, so t<=4\n\nt integer, t<=4.\n\nAnd high >=0: -24 +12(t-2) >=0 => 12(t-2) >=24 => t-2 >=2 => t>=4\n\nSo t>=4 and t<=4, so t=4.\n\nAt t=4, low = -35 +12(4-2) = -35 +12*2 = -35+24= -11 <=0\n\nHigh = -24 +24 =0? -24 +12*2 = -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nYes, t=4.\n\nNow second car on k=5: τ=1, h=12, s=12\n\n[1 +12(t-2), 12+12(t-2)]\n\nLow <=0: 1+12(t-2) <=0 impossible.\n\nNever.\n\nThird car: τ=37, h=48, s=12\n\n[37+12(t-2), 48+12(t-2)]\n\nLow >=37 at t=2, so always >0, never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 5, unsafe only at t=4.\n\nNow freeway k=6.\n\nCars: same as k=5? (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nIdentical, so unsafe at t=4.\n\nSimilarly freeway k=7: same, unsafe at t=4.\n\nNow freeway k=8.\n\nCars: (48,1,right,48)\n\nτ=1, h=48, s=48\n\nSpan [1+48(t-2), 48+48(t-2)]\n\nNever covers 0, as before.\n\nSo summary of unsafe times:\n\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at t=8,9\n\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at t=8,9\n\n- Freeway 3: always safe\n\n- Freeway 4: always safe\n\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at t=4\n\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at t=4\n\n- Freeway 7: unsafe at t=4\n\n- Freeway 8: always safe\n\nPlayer starts at t=2, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal number of actions: since from y=1 to y=9, need 8 net up moves.\n\nBut we can have S or D, which might be needed to avoid being at unsafe positions.\n\nNow, the unsafe times are only at specific points: t=4 for y=5,6,7 and t=8,9 for y=1,2.\n\ny=1 and 2 unsafe at t=8,9; y=5,6,7 unsafe at t=4.\n\ny=3,4,8 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nPlayer must avoid being on y=1 or 2 at t=8 or 9, and avoid being on y=5,6,7 at t=4.\n\nNow, since we start at t=2, y=1, and t=2 is not unsafe for y=1 (only unsafe at t=8,9), so safe at t=2.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the unsafe positions at critical times.\n\nThe critical times are t=4 and t=8,9.\n\nt=4 is soon, t=2 to t=4 is only 2 turns later.\n\nAt t=2, y=1.\n\nIf we move up immediately, we can be at y=2 at t=3, or y=1 if stay, etc.\n\nBut y=1 and 2 are unsafe only at t=8,9, which is later, so for now, we can move up.\n\nBut we need to worry about t=4 for middle rows.\n\nLet me sketch the path.\n\nAssume we move up every turn if possible.\n\nStart t=2, y=1.\n\nAction at t=2: if we do U, then y=2 at t=3.\n\nt=3: if U, y=3 at t=4.\n\nNow at t=4, if we are on y=3,4,5,6,7,8 but y=5,6,7 unsafe at t=4.\n\ny=3 and 4 are safe, y=8 safe.\n\nSo if at t=4 we are on y=3 or y=4, safe.\n\ny=2 at t=4: y=2 is freeway 2, which is unsafe only at t=8,9, not at t=4, so y=2 at t=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at t=4: freeway 1 unsafe only t=8,9, so safe at t=4.\n\nBut we are going up.\n\nFrom above: t=2, y=1\n\nt=3: after action, y could be 0,1,2.\n\nIf we do U at t=2, y=2 at t=3.\n\nThen t=3: do U, y=3 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=3, freeway 3 always safe, so ok.\n\nThen continue: t=4, do U, y=4 at t=5.\n\nt=5, U, y=5 at t=6.\n\nBut y=5 unsafe only at t=4, which is past, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=6, U, y=6 at t=7.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=4, not t=7, safe.\n\nt=7, U, y=7 at t=8.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=4, not t=8, so at t=8, y=7, freeway 7, unsafe only at t=4? From above, freeway 7 unsafe only t=4, so at t=8, should be safe.\n\nBut freeway 1 and 2 unsafe at t=8,9.\n\ny=7 is freeway 7, which is different.\n\nAt t=8, if y=7, freeway 7 is not unsafe at t=8, only at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, t=8: if U, y=8 at t=9.\n\ny=8 always safe.\n\nThen t=9: U, y=9 at t=10? Let's see the turns.\n\nDefine:\n\nTurn t: action a_t determines y_{t+1}? No.\n\nFrom the player update:\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, we choose action a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nPosition after action.\n\nStart at turn t=2, position (0, y_2) = (0,1)\n\nAfter action a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\nSimilarly, after a_3, y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{T} =9 for some T, with minimal T-2 or something.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=2 to t=2+H-1, we have H actions: a_2 to a_{2+H-1}, and positions y_2 to y_{2+H}.\n\ny_{2+H} =9.\n\ny_{t} for t from 2 to 2+H.\n\nAt each turn t, when we are at position (0, y_t), if y_t between 1 and 8, we check collision at turn t for freeway y_t.\n\nIn the sequence, for each turn t, y_t must be such that it is not unsafe at that turn.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nt=2: start y=1\n\na_2 = U, then y_3 = 1 +1 =2\n\nt=3: a_3 = U, y_4 =2+1=3\n\nAt t=4, y_4=3, freeway 3, always safe, ok.\n\nt=4: a_4 = U, y_5 =3+1=4\n\nt=5: a_5 = U, y_6 =4+1=5\n\nt=6: a_6 = U, y_7 =5+1=6\n\nt=7: a_7 = U, y_8 =6+1=7\n\nt=8: a_8 = U, y_9 =7+1=8\n\nt=9: a_9 = U, y_{10} =8+1=9\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn t from 2 to 9, if y_t is between 1 and 8, is it safe at that turn.\n\nt=2: y=1, freeway 1, unsafe only at t=8,9, not t=2, safe.\n\nt=3: y=2, freeway 2, unsafe only t=8,9, not t=3, safe.\n\nt=4: y=3, freeway 3, always safe, ok.\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4, always safe, ok.\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5, unsafe only at t=4, not t=6, safe.\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6, unsafe only t=4, not t=7, safe.\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe only t=4, not t=8, safe.\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8, always safe, ok.\n\nThen y_{10}=9, which is goal.\n\nIn this sequence, we reached y=9 at t=10, with actions from t=2 to t=9, that's 8 actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\nH=8 turns? From t=2 to t=2+H-1=9, so t=2 to t=9, 8 actions, and y_{10}=9.\n\nBut at t=10, we are at y=9, which is after the last action.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t=9, we do a_9=U, to go from y=8 to y=9.\n\nAnd at turn t=9, we are at y=8, which is safe.\n\nIs there any collision? From above, all positions during the path are safe at those turns.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=4, we were at y=3, which is safe, not on y=5,6,7.\n\nAt t=8, we were at y=7, which for freeway 7 is unsafe only at t=4, not t=8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 and 2 unsafe at t=8 and t=9, but at t=8 we were on y=7, not y=1 or 2; at t=9 on y=8, not y=1 or 2.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nWe can reach in 8 actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? 8 is the minimum possible since we need 8 up moves, and we did 8 U, no S or D, so H=8 should be minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it faster? From y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 moves, so H=8 is the lower bound.\n\nBut in this case, it seems possible.\n\nBut we start at t=2, y=1.\n\nAfter 8 actions, at t=10, y=9.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nTurn t=2: a_2 = U\n\nThen y_3=2\n\nTurn t=3: a_3 = U, y_4=3\n\nTurn t=4: a_4 = U, y_5=4\n\nBut at t=4, y_4=3, which is set before action a_4.\n\nIn terms of collision: at turn t, we are at y_t, and we perform action a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, collision is checked based on y_t and freeway y_t at time t.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt t=2: y=1, safe as above.\n\na_2=U\n\nt=3: y=2, freeway 2, safe (unsafe only t=8,9)\n\na_3=U\n\nt=4: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\na_4=U\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\na_5=U\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5, safe (since unsafe only t=4)\n\na_6=U\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6, safe (unsafe only t=4)\n\na_7=U\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7, safe (unsafe only t=4)\n\na_8=U\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8, safe\n\na_9=U\n\nThen y_{10}=9.\n\nAt t=9, we do a_9, and y_{10}=9, but at turn t=9, we are at y=8, which is safe.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at t=10.\n\nNow, H=8 actions: from t=2 to t=9.\n\nThe end position is at turn t=10.\n\nBut in the task, it says \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\" let's see.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nt_1 =2, so actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, that is a_2 to a_{2+H-1}\n\nAnd position at turn t_1 + H -1 should be (0,9)\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 2 + H -1 = 1 + H\n\nPosition at turn 1+H should be (0,9)\n\nIn the sequence above, with H=8, actions a_2 to a_{2+7}=a_9? t_1 + H -1 = 2 + H -1\n\nFor H=8, t_1 + H -1 = 2+8-1=9, so position at turn 9 should be (0,9)\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 9, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nI think I messed up the indexing.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_t for t = t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter applying these actions, the position at turn t_1 + H should be (0,9), I think? No.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9\n\nBut the turn when we reach is t_1 + H.\n\nThe task says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nt_{t_1 + H -1} = (0,9)\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 is (0,9)\n\nBut at turn t, before any action, we are at position (0,y_t)\n\nThen we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}\n\nSo at turn t, position is (0,y_t)\n\nAfter action a_t, we move to (0,y_{t+1}) at the start of next turn.\n\nThe turn t_1 + H -1 is when we are at (0,9), meaning y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThen, for that to happen, the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -2 would determine the moves.\n\nSet T = t_1 + H -1, we want y_T =9.\n\nT = 2 + H -1 = 1 + H\n\nSince t_1=2.\n\ny_{1+H} =9\n\nNow, the actions are from t = t_1 to t_1 + H -1, that is t=2 to 2+H-1.\n\nAfter a_{2+H-1}, y_{2+H} =9? Let's see.\n\ny_{t_1} = y_2\n\nAfter a_2, y_3\n\nAfter a_3, y_4\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + k}, y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nFor k from 0 to H-1.\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9\n\nThis means that at turn t_1 + H -1, we are already at y=9, so the action a_{t_1 + H -1} might be S, or we arrived from below.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so to achieve that, the previous action a_{t_1 + H -2} should be such that it sets y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, for y_T =9 at T= t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith t_1=2, T=2 + H -1 =1+H\n\ny_{1+H} =9\n\nThe actions are a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, i.e., from 2 to 2+H-1.\n\nFor each action a_t at turn t, it affects y_{t+1}.\n\nSo for y_{1+H} to be 9, it is determined by a_{1+H -1} = a_H? Let's index properly.\n\nSet S = t_1 + H -1, we want y_S =9.\n\nS = 2 + H -1 =1+H\n\ny_{1+H} =9\n\nNow, the actions are from t=2 to t=2+H-1.\n\nThe last action that affects position is a_{S-1} if S>2, but S=1+H.\n\ny_S is determined by a_{S-1}, since y_S = y_{S-1} + Δy_{S-1}\n\nAnd a_{S-1} is one of the actions if S-1 >=2.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then S=2+1-1=2, so y_2 should be 9, but we start at y=1, not 9, so H>1.\n\nIn general, y_S = y_{S-1} + Δy_{S-1}\n\nWith y_{S-1} and Δy_{S-1} from a_{S-1}.\n\nNow, S=1+H.\n\nActions are for t from 2 to 2+H-1.\n\nS=1+H, so S-1 = H.\n\na_{S-1} = a_H\n\nBut H is the number, t index.\n\nt from 2 to 2+H-1.\n\nS-1 = (1+H) -1 = H\n\nBut H is not a turn index, turn index is S-1 = H, but H is number, so turn H? Confusing.\n\nBetter to use absolute turns.\n\nt_1=2.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for T= t_1 + H -1 = 2 + H -1\n\nActions: a_t for t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, i.e., t=2 to 2+H-1.\n\nNow, y_T = y_{2+H-1} =9\n\ny_{2+H-1} is determined by the actions up to a_{2+H-2}, since y_{2+H-1} = y_{2+H-2} + Δy_{2+H-2}\n\nAnd a_{2+H-2} is included in the actions if 2+H-2 >=2, i.e., H>=2.\n\nFor H=1, T=2+1-1=2, y_2=1, not 9, impossible.\n\nMinimal H, since from y=1 to y=9, need at least 8 up moves, so H at least 8.\n\nIf H=8, then T=2+8-1=9, so we need y_9=9.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=2+7=9? t=2 to t=2+H-1=2+8-1=9.\n\nActions a_2 to a_9.\n\nNow, y_9 should be 9.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7, and so on, down to y_2=1.\n\nSo to have y_9=9, we need to have moved up 8 times in the actions from a_2 to a_8, since each U increases y by 1, D decreases, S same.\n\nThe net displacement must be +8.\n\nSince we start at y=1, end at y=9, net +8.\n\nThe actions a_t from t=2 to t=8 affect y_3 to y_9.\n\ny_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3 = y_2 + Δy_2 + Δy_3\n\n...\n\ny_9 = y_2 + sum_{t=2 to 8} Δy_t\n\nSince y_2=1, y_9=9, so sum_{t=2 to 8} Δy_t = 8\n\nEach Δy_t is +1, -1, or 0, so to sum to 8, we need exactly 8 up moves and no down moves, and possibly some stays, but stays would require more actions, so for minimal H, we should have no stays or downs, all U.\n\nH=8 actions, from t=2 to t=9? Actions a_2 to a_9, that's 8 actions, but they affect y_3 to y_10.\n\ny_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\n...\n\ny_10 = y_9 + Δy_9\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nWe want y_9 =9.\n\ny_9 = y_2 + sum_{t=2 to 8} Δy_t\n\nSet equal to 9, y_2=1, so sum_{t=2 to 8} Δy_t =8\n\nWith 7 terms: t=2 to 8 inclusive, that's 7 actions: a_2 to a_8, affecting y_3 to y_9.\n\ny_9 = y_2 + Δy_2 + Δy_3 + ... + Δy_8\n\nFrom t=2 to t=8, that's 7 terms.\n\ny_2 to y_9: y_3, y_4, y_5, y_6, y_7, y_8, y_9 — that's 7 steps, so 7 actions determine y_9 from y_2.\n\ny_2 is given, then after a_2, y_3; after a_3, y_4; ... after a_8, y_9.\n\nSo actions a_2 to a_8 determine y_3 to y_9.\n\nWith 7 actions, to go from y_2=1 to y_9=9, net +8, but only 7 actions, each can contribute at most +1, so maximum y_9=1+7=8, which is less than 9, impossible with 7 actions.\n\nMistake.\n\ny_9 is after 7 actions from y_2.\n\nStart: turn t=2, position y_2=1.\n\nAfter action a_2, position y_3.\n\nAfter a_3, y_4.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_8, y_9.\n\nSo from y_2 to y_9, there are 7 actions: a_2 to a_8.\n\ny_9 = y_2 + sum_{k=2 to 8} Δy_k\n\nSet y_9=9, y_2=1, so sum_{k=2 to 8} Δy_k =8\n\nBut there are only 7 terms, each at most +1, so sum <=7, cannot be 8. Contradiction.\n\nTherefore, for y_9=9, we need at least 8 actions to increase by 8.\n\nWith actions from a_2 to a_8, only 7 actions, y_9 <= 1+7=8.\n\nTo reach y_9=9, we need y_9 = y_2 + sum_{t=2 to 8} Δy_t =1 + sum of 7 deltas, max 8, so y_9<=8.\n\nTo reach y_9=9, impossible, since from y_2=1, with 7 actions, can reach at most y=8.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y_T at T=9, we need actions from t=2 to t=8, 7 actions, to go from y_2 to y_9, which is 7 steps, so y_9 <=8.\n\nTo have y_9=9, we must start from a higher position or have more actions.\n\nBut we start at y=1.\n\nSo for T=9, y_9=9 is impossible with the actions.\n\nThe only way to have y_T=9 for some T.\n\nWith H actions, we reach position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =2 + H -1 =1+H\n\ny_{1+H} =9\n\nThe actions are from t=2 to t=2+H-1.\n\nNumber of actions: H.\n\nEach action a_t at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo the positions from y_3 to y_{2+H} are determined by the actions.\n\ny_{2+H} is determined by a_{2+H-1}\n\nBut we care about y_{1+H}\n\ny_{1+H} = y_{2 + (H-1)} \n\nThis is determined by the actions up to a_{1+H-1} = a_H? Messy.\n\nSet K = H-1, but let's think.\n\ny_{1+H} = y_{t_1 + H -1} since t_1=2.\n\nWe want y_{1+H} =9.\n\ny_{1+H} is the position at turn 1+H.\n\nIt is determined by the previous action.\n\nThe actions a_t for t from 2 to 2+H-1 affect y_{t+1} for t from 2 to 2+H-1, so y_3 to y_{2+H}\n\nFor y_{1+H}, if 1+H =3, it is affected by a_2, etc.\n\nBut 1+H could be less than 3 for small H.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then y_{1+1}=y_2=1, not 9.\n\nH=2, y_{1+2}=y_3, which is determined by a_2: y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2 =1 + Δy_2, so y_3 <=2, not 9.\n\nGenerally, from y_2 to y_{1+H}, the number of steps is (1+H) - 2 = H-1.\n\nSo to go from y_2=1 to y_{1+H}=9, net change +8, with H-1 actions.\n\nEach action can give +1, so we need at least 8 actions to increase by 8, so H-1 >=8, thus H >=9.\n\nThen with H=9, we have 8 actions to increase, so possible with all U.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1 =2+9-1=10, so y_10=9.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=2+9-1=10, so a_2 to a_10.\n\nWith a_2 to a_9 affecting y_3 to y_10, but we want y_10=9.\n\ny_10 = y_2 + sum_{t=2 to 9} Δy_t =1 + sum of 8 deltas.\n\nSet to 9, so sum Δy_t from t=2 to 9 must be 8.\n\nWith 8 actions, each U gives +1, so 8 U actions.\n\nThen y_10 =1 +8=9.\n\nAt turn T= t_1 + H -1 =2+9-1=10, y_10=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_2 to a_10, all U.\n\nBut a_10 is at turn 10, which sets y_11, but we don't care, since we reach at turn 10.\n\nIn terms of collision, we need to check for each turn t from 2 to 10, the position y_t.\n\nt from 2 to 10, y_t between 1 and 8 for some, need to be safe at that turn.\n\nIn the all-up sequence:\n\nt=2: y=1, safe\n\na_2=U\n\nt=3: y=2, safe (not unsafe at t=3)\n\na_3=U\n\nt=4: y=3, safe\n\na_4=U\n\nt=5: y=4, safe\n\na_5=U\n\nt=6: y=5, safe (unsafe only t=4)\n\na_6=U\n\nt=7: y=6, safe\n\na_7=U\n\nt=8: y=7, safe (freeway 7 unsafe only t=4)\n\na_8=U\n\nt=9: y=8, safe\n\na_9=U\n\nt=10: y=9, not on freeway, safe.\n\nAnd we reach at t=10.\n\nBut at t=9, y=8, which is safe.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=8? If H=8, then T=2+8-1=9, y_9=9.\n\nBut with actions a_2 to a_8 (7 actions), y_9 = y_2 + sum_{t=2 to 8} Δy_t =1 + sum of 7 terms.\n\nMax sum=7, y_9<=8, cannot be 9. So impossible to reach y_9=9 with only 7 actions from y_2=1. Thus H=8 is impossible, minimal H=9.\n\nThen with H=9, we can do as above with all U.\n\nBut in the all-U sequence, we are at y=7 at t=8, and freeway 7 is unsafe only at t=4, so at t=8 it is safe, similarly others.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7, freeway 7, and we said unsafe only t=4, but let's confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at t=4, yes.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 and 2 unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=8, we are on y=7, not y=1 or 2.\n\nAt t=9, we are on y=8, not y=1 or 2.\n\nSo all good.\n\nWe can have a sequence with H=9.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=9 but not all U? But since we need exactly 8 up moves, and 8 actions to increase, with H=9 actions, we have 8 moves from t=2 to t=9 to set y_3 to y_10, but y_10 is the position after last action.\n\nWith H=9 actions: a_2 to a_10.\n\ny_3 to y_11 are affected, but we care up to y_10.\n\ny_10 = y_2 + sum_{t=2 to 9} Δy_t\n\nSet to 9, y_2=1, so sum_{t=2 to 9} Δy_t =8.\n\nWith 8 terms (t=2 to 9), so we need exactly 8 U and no D or S, since S or D would require more actions to compensate, but with 8 actions, if we have S or D, sum <8, y_10<9, not reached.\n\nFor example, if one S, then sum Δy <=7, y_10<=8<9.\n\nSimilarly if D, worse.\n\nSo must have all 8 actions U, no S or D.\n\nThus the only sequence with H=9 is all U from a_2 to a_9.\n\na_2 to a_9 are the actions, all U.\n\nThen y_10=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at turn t=10, we do a_10, but a_10 is not used since we already reached at t=10, but we have to specify a_10, but it doesn't affect the position since we are at y=9.\n\nBut in the action list, for t=2 to t=10, that's 9 actions.\n\na_10 can be anything, but since we are at y=9, if we do U, y_11=10>9, not allowed, y must be in [0,9], so we cannot go above 9.\n\nSimilarly, if we do U at y=9, it might be invalid or capped, but from the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if y_t=9 and a_t=U, y_{t+1} should be 10, but not in [0,9], so probably not allowed, or capped, but the problem says \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so I think actions are only allowed if they keep y within bounds.\n\nSimilarly for D at y=0.\n\nIn this case, at t=10, we are at y_10=9, so for a_10, we must do S or D, but D to y=8, which is not desired, or S to stay at 9.\n\nSince we are already at 9 at t=10, we can do S at t=10.\n\nBut in the sequence, a_10 is part of the actions, but it doesn't change the position.\n\nTo be safe, we can set a_10=S.\n\nSimilarly, in the all-U sequence, a_2 to a_9 are U, then at t=10, y=9, a_10=S.\n\nBut a_10 is at turn 10, and position at t=10 is before a_10, so y_10=9, and we perform a_10=S, then y_11=9, but we don't care.\n\nNow, for collision, at turn t=10, y=9, not on freeway, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, with all U:\n\nt=2: y=1, safe\n\na_2=U\n\nt=3: y=2, safe\n\na_3=U\n\nt=4: y=3, safe\n\na_4=U\n\nt=5: y=4, safe\n\na_5=U\n\nt=6: y=5, safe\n\na_6=U\n\nt=7: y=6, safe\n\na_7=U\n\nt=8: y=7, safe\n\na_8=U\n\nt=9: y=8, safe\n\na_9=U\n\nt=10: y=9, safe\n\na_10=S (since at y=9, cannot U)\n\nBut a_10 is at turn 10, after we are already at y=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=2 to t=10 for H=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have a_10, which is S.\n\nBut we reached at turn t=10.\n\nIs there a way to reach earlier? With H=9, T=10.\n\nIf we could reach at T=9, but T=9 requires y_9=9, but with actions from t=2 to t=8 for H=8? Let's not confuse.\n\nFor reaching at turn S, with minimal S.\n\nBut the number of turns H is defined as the number of actions to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = S, say.\n\nS min is at least 10, since from y=1 at t=2, to y=9, need at least 8 steps, so S >= 10.\n\nFor example, if we move up every turn, S=10.\n\nCan we reach earlier? Only if we start higher, but we start at y=1.\n\nSo S=10 is minimal.\n\nWith H=9, S=10.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, it works.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point we are unsafe.\n\nFor example, at t=4, we are at y=3, which is safe.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7 unsafe at t=4, but we are on y=3, not on them.\n\nAt t=8, freeway 1 and 2 unsafe, but we are on y=7.\n\nAt t=9, freeway 1 and 2 unsafe, but we are on y=8.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different sequence, but with H=9, all U is fine.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nt_1=2.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=2+H-1=2+9-1=10.\n\nSo a_2 to a_10.\n\na_2 to a_9: U\n\na_10: S (since at y=9)\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nBut the car state has multiple cars, but in this case, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5,6,7, unsafe at t=4, but we are not there at t=4.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by moving down or something, but that would take more turns, not faster.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some point, it delays, so worse.\n\nOr move down, then need to come back, so more actions, larger H.\n\nSo minimal H is 9 with this sequence.\n\nBut H=9 turns.\n\nIn the sequence, a_10 is S, but we could do nothing, but we have to specify.\n\nIn the action list.\n\nNow, the answer should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (since t_1=2, a_2=U)\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nH=9, t_1=2, so up to t_1 + H -1 = 2+9-1=10.\n\nSo turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n\nActions: for t=2 to 9: U, and t=10: S\n\nBut at t=10, we are at y=9, so action S.\n\nNow, in the sequence:\n\nTurn 2: a_2 = U\n\nTurn 3: a_3 = U\n\nTurn 4: a_4 = U\n\nTurn 5: a_5 = U\n\nTurn 6: a_6 = U\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = U\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = U\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = S\n\nBut a_10 is at turn 10, and position at turn 10 is y=9 before action, so we do S to stay.\n\nWe could do D, but not necessary.\n\nS is fine.\n\nBut in the action for turn 10, since we are at y=9, U is invalid, so must do S or D, S is better.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the starting point.\n\nAt turn 2, position (0,1), we perform action a_2.\n\nAfter a_2=U, go to (0,2) at turn 3.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAt turn 10, position (0,9), we perform a_10=S, stay at (0,9) for turn 11.\n\nBut we reached at turn 10.\n\nNow, collision check: at each turn t, y_t:\n\nt=2: y=1, freeway 1: cars at t=2: [-47,-36] and [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=3: y=2, freeway 2: similar, cars at t=3.\n\nFor freeway 2, cars same as freeway 1.\n\nAt t=3, for first car: span [-47 +6(3-2), -36 +6(1)] = [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [1+6(1),12+6(1)]=[7,18], not 0. Safe.\n\nt=4: y=3, freeway 3: car (48,1,right,48) at t=4: span [1+48(2),48+48(2)]? t-2=2, [1+96,48+96]=[97,144], not 0. Safe.\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4: similar, safe.\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5: at t=6, unsafe only at t=4, so at t=6 should be safe.\n\nCars: first car: τ=-35,h=-24,s=12, at t=6, t-2=4, span [-35+12*4, -24+12*4]=[-35+48,-24+48]=[13,24], not 0.\n\nOther cars not cover 0. Safe.\n\nSimilarly t=7: y=6, freeway 6, similar, safe.\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7: at t=8, cars: for example, first car on k=7: (-24,-35,right,12), but freeway 7 has same cars as 5 and 6.\n\nAt t=8, t-2=6, span [-35+12*6, -24+12*6]=[-35+72,-24+72]=[37,48], not 0. Safe.\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8: car (48,1,right,48) at t=9, t-2=7, span [1+48*7,48+48*7]=[1+336,48+336]=[337,384], not 0. Safe.\n\nt=10: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nH=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nBut turn 10 is t_1 + H -1 = 2+9-1=10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid the S at the end.\n\nFor example, if we reach y=9 at an earlier action, but we cannot, since minimal turn is 10.\n\nWith H=9, we have to have a_10, and at t=10 we are at y=9, so a_10 must be S.\n\nIf we do U at t=9 when y=8, to y=9, but at turn t=9, we are at y=8, then a_9=U to go to y=9 at turn 10.\n\nThen at turn 10, we are at y=9, and if we set a_10=S, it's fine.\n\nNo need to do anything else.\n\nSo sequence is fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 1 and 2, unsafe at t=8 and 9, but we are not there, so ok.\n\nAnother thing: in the car state, for freeway 1, at t=8, it should be unsafe.\n\nAt t=8, for freeway 1, first car: span at t=8, t-2=6, [-47+6*6, -36+6*6]=[-47+36, -36+36]=[-11,0], so [ -11, 0], which includes 0, so unsafe.\n\nSimilarly at t=9: t-2=7, [-47+42, -36+42]=[-5,6], includes 0? -5 <=0<=6, yes.\n\nBut we are not on y=1 at those times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo all set.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9, sequence as above.\n\nNow, in the output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  \nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}  \n...  \nTurn t_1 + H - 1: a_{t_1 + H - 1}  \n}\n\nWith t_1=2, H=9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U  \nTurn 3: U  \nTurn 4: U  \nTurn 5: U  \nTurn 6: U  \nTurn 7: U  \nTurn 8: U  \nTurn 9: U  \nTurn 10: S\n\nBut Turn 10 is t_1 + H -1 = 2+9-1=10.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in terms of t_1.\n\nSince t_1=2, but in general, but here specified.\n\nIn the box.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 9. This is because the player starts at \\(y = 1\\) and must reach \\(y = 9\\), requiring a net increase of 8 in the y-coordinate. Each \"U\" action increases y by 1, but due to the game mechanics, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 2 + 9 - 1 = 10\\) requires exactly 8 \"U\" actions and one \"S\" action (at the end when \\(y = 9\\) to stay within bounds).\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\):\n- Freeways 1 and 2 are unsafe at turns 8 and 9.\n- Freeways 5, 6, and 7 are unsafe at turn 4.\n- Freeways 3, 4, and 8 are always safe.\n\nThe path taken ensures the player is not on an unsafe freeway at the critical times:\n- At turn 4, the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3).\n- At turns 8 and 9, the player is at \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) respectively (safe, freeways 7 and 8 are not unsafe at these turns).\n\nThe action sequence is:\n- Turns 2 to 9: \"U\" to move up, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10.\n- Turn 10: \"S\" to stay at \\(y = 9\\), as moving up would exceed the grid bounds.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 9\\) turns, which is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 2: U \\\\  \nTurn 3: U \\\\  \nTurn 4: U \\\\  \nTurn 5: U \\\\  \nTurn 6: U \\\\  \nTurn 7: U \\\\  \nTurn 8: U \\\\  \nTurn 9: U \\\\  \nTurn 10: S  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. The car positions are given at turn t1, which is turn 3. For any future turn T, I can calculate where the cars will be.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn, then I collide. Also, note that when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on it until the next turn. So if I move at turn T, at turn T I'm still on the previous freeway, and I arrive at the new one at turn T+1.\n\nThe player update is: at each turn, I choose an action: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same). Then y_{t+1} is set based on that, and it must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nI start at y=2 at turn 3. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think? The vertical axis is y=0 to 9, but the freeways are only y=1 to 8 for cars. So y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8.\" And the player starts at (0,2), which is on freeway y=2? Position is (0,y), so at (0,2), that means on freeway y=2.\n\ny=2 is a freeway, so there might be cars.\n\nSimilarly, (0,9) is y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\nBut to reach (0,9), I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, the cars: for each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so increasing x? The grid is 2D, but we only care about x=0 for collision, I think.\n\nThe collision is based on whether 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe span is given as [head, tail] or [tail, head], depending on direction.\n\nFor left-moving, head is left, tail right? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving car: span at t1 is [h, τ], and at T, it becomes [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]. Since it's moving left, h and τ decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: span [τ, h]? In the table, for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nIn the car state table, for example, freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 6). Direction is right, so for right-moving, the span is given as (head h, tail τ), but in the update, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h]? I think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nRight-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h]? It says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\"\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head, tail), but for right-moving, when direction is right, it uses [τ, h] as the span, meaning τ is left, h is right? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined relative to direction.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should look at the span definition.\n\nFor a car, the span is the set of positions it occupies.\n\nFor left-moving, head is the front, which is left, so smaller x, tail is right, larger x.\n\nSo at t1, positions from h to τ, with h < τ? No.\n\nIf left-moving, head is left, so h is small, tail is right, τ large, so [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nThen when moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head is right, so h is large, tail is left, τ small? But in the table, for right-moving, it's (h, τ) with what?\n\nLook at freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nh = -30, τ = -41, but -30 > -41, so if right-moving, and span is [τ, h] for the update.\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] and it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nWith τ and h, in this case τ = -41, h = -30, so [τ, h] = [-41, -30], which is from left to right, and as it moves right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly, for the other car on freeway 1: (18,7,right,6), τ=7, h=18, so [τ,h] = [7,18], moving right.\n\nIn the car list, for a right-moving car, the first number is head? But in (18,7,right,6), 18 is head, 7 is tail, but for right-moving, head is right, so h=18, tail τ=7 left, so [τ,h] = [7,18].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h,τ] with h left, τ right.\n\nBut in this problem, all cars are right-moving, I think? Direction is all right, from the table.\n\nFreeway 1: both right, freeway 2: both right, freeway 3: right, etc. All are right-moving, no left-moving.\n\nFreeway 3: (96,49,right,48), etc. All right.\n\nSo only right-moving cars.\n\nFor right-moving cars, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] for t >= t1, where at t1, it is [τ, h].\n\nIn general, at turn T, span is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nSince t1 = 3, let ΔT = T - 3, so at turn T, span = [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if I am on y=k and 0 is in the span for some car on that freeway.\n\nI am on freeway y at turn T if after the action at turn T, I am at y, but let's clarify the timing.\n\nThe turn: at turn t, I am at position y_t, then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at the beginning of the turn or when I am on the freeway.\n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T, I think.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on freeway y_T. If for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in Span(T), then collision.\n\nIf I move to a different freeway, at turn T I am still on the old one, so I only care about the cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and I care about cars on that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nNow, I start at turn t1=3, y=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, I just need to be there at some turn.\n\nBut to get there, I have to pass through y=3 to y=8, which have cars.\n\ny=0 also no cars, but I'm at y=2, going up.\n\nThe minimal H might be since from y=2 to y=9, the difference is 7, so if I go up every turn, I can reach in 7 turns: at turn 3, y=2; after action U, turn 4 y=3; U turn 5 y=4; ... up to turn 10 y=9? Let's see.\n\nStart turn 3: y=2\n\nAfter action at turn 3: choose a_3, then y_4 = y3 + Δy, etc.\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nAt turn t, y_t is position.\n\nAction a_t is chosen at turn t, affecting y_{t+1}.\n\nSo sequence: at turn t, position y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen for collision, at turn t, I am at y_t, and if y_t between 1 and 8, and for some car on freeway y_t, 0 in span at turn t.\n\nIn this case, t1=3, y3=2.\n\nI need to find actions from a3 to a_{3+H-1} such that after H actions, y_{3+H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions, I have taken H steps, so from turn 3 to turn 3+H, I have H actions: a3 to a_{3+H-1}, and positions y3 to y_{3+H}.\n\nAt turn 3, position y3, after a3, y4, and so on, up to after a_{3+H-1}, y_{3+H}.\n\nI want y_{3+H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nSince I start at y3=2, and y_{3+H}=9, the number of steps up needed is at least 7, so H >=7.\n\nIf I go up every turn, H=7: from y3=2, a3=U, y4=3; a4=U, y5=4; ... a8=U, y9=5? Let's list:\n\nTurn t: position y_t\n\nt=3: y3=2\n\na3: action, then y4 = y3 + Δy\n\nIf a3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\na7=U, y8=7\n\na8=U, y9=8\n\na9=U, y10=9\n\nSo after 7 actions (a3 to a9), at turn 10, y10=9.\n\nH=7 turns of actions? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and after that, position is at turn t1+H.\n\nIn this case, t1=3, actions a3 to a_{3+H-1}, position at turn t1+H = 3+H is y_{3+H}.\n\nSet y_{3+H} =9.\n\nWith H=7, y_{3+7}=y10=9.\n\nBut I need to check if during the path, I collide with cars.\n\nIn this sequence, I am at y=2 at turn 3, then y=3 at turn 4, y=4 at turn 5, ..., y=8 at turn 9, y=9 at turn 10.\n\nNow, at each turn, for y_t, if between 1 and 8, check if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, freeway y=2 at turn t=3.\n\nCars on freeway 2: from table, freeway k=2 has cars: (-30, -41, right, 6) and (18, 7, right, 6)\n\nNow, at turn T=3, ΔT = T - t1 = 3-3=0, so span for first car: [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [-41, -30] since τ=-41, h=-30? For right-moving, span at T is [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\nAt T=3, ΔT=0, span = [τ, h] = [-41, -30] for first car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=7, h=18, span=[7,18]\n\nNow, is 0 in [-41,-30]? -41 to -30, all negative, 0 not in.\n\n0 in [7,18]? 7 to 18, 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 3, on y=2, no collision.\n\nNow turn 4, y=3.\n\nFreeway 3: cars: (96,49,right,48)\n\nτ=49, h=96? In car state: (head h, tail τ) = (96,49,right,48)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\nAt T=4, ΔT = T - t1 =4-3=1\n\ns=48\n\nspan = [49 + 48*1, 96 + 48*1] = [49+48, 96+48] = [97, 144]\n\n0 in [97,144]? No.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTurn 5, y=4\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? Cars: (96,49,right,48)\n\nAt T=5, ΔT=2\n\nspan = [49 + 48*2, 96 + 48*2] = [49+96, 96+96] = [145,192]\n\n0 not in.\n\nTurn 6, y=5\n\nFreeway 5: cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nFirst car: τ=-23? Head h, tail τ: (-12,-23,right,12), so h=-12, τ=-23? For right-moving, τ should be left, h right, so if h=-12, τ=-23, since -12 > -23, so τ=-23, h=-12.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\nAt T=6, ΔT=3\n\ns=12\n\nFirst car: [ -23 + 12*3, -12 + 12*3 ] = [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24]\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), h=24, τ=13? Since 24>13, so τ=13, h=24.\n\n[13 + 12*3, 24 + 12*3] = [13+36, 24+36] = [49,60]\n\nThird car: (60,49,right,12), τ=49, h=60\n\n[49 + 12*3, 60 + 12*3] = [49+36, 60+36] = [85,96]\n\nNow, at turn 6, on freeway 5, is 0 in any span?\n\nFirst car span [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond [49,60], no.\n\nThird [85,96], no.\n\n0 not in any.\n\nTurn 7, y=6\n\nFreeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? Cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nAt T=7, ΔT=4\n\nFirst car: [ -23 + 12*4, -12 + 12*4 ] = [-23+48, -12+48] = [25,36]\n\nSecond car: [13 + 12*4, 24 + 12*4] = [13+48, 24+48] = [61,72]\n\nThird car: [49 + 12*4, 60 + 12*4] = [49+48, 60+48] = [97,108]\n\n0 not in any.\n\nTurn 8, y=7\n\nFreeway 7: same cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nAt T=8, ΔT=5\n\nFirst car: [ -23 + 12*5, -12 + 12*5 ] = [-23+60, -12+60] = [37,48]\n\nSecond: [13+60, 24+60] = [73,84]\n\nThird: [49+60, 60+60] = [109,120]\n\n0 not in.\n\nTurn 9, y=8\n\nFreeway 8: cars: (96,49,right,48)\n\nAt T=9, ΔT=6\n\nspan = [49 + 48*6, 96 + 48*6] = [49+288, 96+288] = [337,384]\n\n0 not in.\n\nThen turn 10, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nIn this path, all turns are safe? But at each turn, for the freeway I'm on, 0 is not in the car spans. So no collision.\n\nBut is that possible? Let me double-check freeway 5 at turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6, y=5, freeway 5 cars:\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12), at T=6, ΔT=3, span [ -23+36, -12+36] = [13,24]\n\nSecond: (24,13,right,12), but (24,13), h=24, τ=13, so at T=6, [13+36,24+36]= [49,60]? Earlier I said [49,60], but 13+36=49, 24+36=60, yes.\n\nBut 13 to 60? [49,60] for second car.\n\nAnd 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut at turn 6, for freeway 5, the cars are at [13,24], [49,60], [85,96], all positive, not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn this case, with all U actions, I reach in 7 actions: a3 to a9, with y10=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and position at t1+H.\n\nSo for H=7, actions a3 to a9, position at t=10.\n\nBut the problem asks for minimal H, and sequence.\n\nIn this case, it seems to work with H=7.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point 0 is covered.\n\nFor example, on freeway 2 at turn 3: cars at [-41,-30] and [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nTurn 4, freeway 3: [97,144], no.\n\nEtc.\n\nBut freeway 1 and 2 have the same cars, but I'm not on them except at turn 3 for y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 3, safe.\n\nBut is there a car that might cover 0 at some turn?\n\nFor instance, on freeway 5, let's see when car spans cover 0.\n\nTake first car on freeway 5: (-12,-23,right,12), span at T: [ -23 + 12 ΔT, -12 + 12 ΔT ]\n\nSet this to contain 0: -23 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -12 +12ΔT\n\nSo -23 +12ΔT <=0 and 0 <= -12 +12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -23 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so ΔT <=1 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -12 +12ΔT => 12 <=12ΔT => ΔT >=1.\n\nSo for ΔT=1, -23+12= -11 <=0, and -12+12=0 <=0? 0 <=0 is true, but span is [left, right], inclusive?\n\n0 <= -12 +12ΔT, for ΔT=1: -12+12=0, so 0 <=0, true.\n\nAnd -23+12= -11 <=0, true.\n\nSo at ΔT=1, span [ -23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 to 0, so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT=1, T = t1 +1 =3+1=4.\n\nAt turn T=4, this car on freeway 5 has span [ -11, 0], so 0 is in.\n\nBut at turn T=4, I am not on freeway 5; in my path, at turn 4 I am on y=3, freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 5: (24,13,right,12), τ=13, h=24, span [13 +12ΔT, 24+12ΔT]\n\nSet 13+12ΔT <=0 <=24+12ΔT? 13+12ΔT >0 for ΔT>=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (60,49,right,12), [49+12ΔT,60+12ΔT] >0, always.\n\nSo only the first car on freeway 5 has 0 in span at T=4, i.e., turn 4.\n\nBut at turn 4, if I were on freeway 5, I would collide, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nIn my path, I never on freeway 5 at turn 4; I on it at turn 6, when span is [13,24], no 0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1 and 2, let's see if 0 covered.\n\nFreeway 1: cars (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6)\n\nFirst car: τ=-41, h=-30, span [ -41 +6ΔT, -30 +6ΔT]\n\nSet -41+6ΔT <=0 <= -30+6ΔT\n\nFirst: -41+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT<=41 => ΔT<=41/6≈6.833, so ΔT<=6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30+6ΔT => 30<=6ΔT => ΔT>=5\n\nSo for ΔT=5,6\n\nΔT=5: [ -41+30, -30+30] = [-11, 0]\n\nΔT=6: [ -41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6], which includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=5: T=3+5=8, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=6: T=9, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nBut for freeway 1, at turn 8 or 9.\n\nBut in my path, I am not on freeway 1 at those turns.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (18,7,right,6), τ=7,h=18, span [7+6ΔT,18+6ΔT]\n\nMin is 7>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same cars, same thing.\n\nIn my path, I am on freeway 2 only at turn 3, which is ΔT=0, span [-41,-30] and [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nThen freeway 3 at turn 4, ΔT=1, span [97,144], no.\n\nFreeway 4 similar.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 as before.\n\nSo in the all-up path, no collision, and I reach in 7 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to find minimal H, and 7 seems possible.\n\nBut let me check if I can do faster? From y=2 to y=9, minimum 7 steps up, so H=7 is minimum possible, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nI could go down, but that would make it longer, so H=7 is minimal.\n\nAnd in this case, it works.\n\nBut why do I feel like there might be a problem? Perhaps on some freeway at some turn.\n\nFor example, freeway 8 at turn 9: y=8, freeway 8 car (96,49,right,48), at T=9, ΔT=6, span [49+288,96+288]= [337,384], no.\n\nBut at earlier turns, for example, if I were on freeway 5 at turn 4, I would collide, but I'm not.\n\nIn this path, I'm fine.\n\nPerhaps the cars on freeway 1 and 2 are identical, but I only on y=2 at turn 3.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 3, I am at y=2, and I take action U, so at turn 4, I am at y=3.\n\nIn the sequence, all actions U.\n\nBut let me confirm the answer format.\n\nI need to output the actions from turn t1 onwards.\n\nt1=3.\n\nSo for H=7, actions: turn 3: U, turn 4: U, turn 5: U, turn 6: U, turn 7: U, turn 8: U, turn 9: U.\n\nThen at turn 10, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, here t1=3, a3 to a9, which is 7 actions.\n\nPosition at t=10.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 3,4,8, there is one car with high speed, but spans are large and away.\n\nPerhaps I should list for each turn the position and the car spans to be sure.\n\nTurn 3: y=2, freeway 2 cars: at ΔT=0, [-41,-30] and [7,18], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn 4: y=3, freeway 3 car: at ΔT=1, [49+48,96+48]? τ=49, h=96, s=48, ΔT=1, [49+48,96+48]= [97,144], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn 5: y=4, freeway 4 car: same as above, ΔT=2, [49+96,96+96]= [145,192], no. Safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=5, freeway 5 cars: ΔT=3\n\nFirst car: τ=-23? For (-12,-23,right,12), h=-12, τ=-23, so span [ -23 +12*3, -12 +12*3] = [-23+36, -12+36]= [13,24]\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), τ=13, h=24, [13+36,24+36]= [49,60]\n\nThird car: (60,49,right,12), τ=49, h=60, [49+36,60+36]= [85,96]\n\n0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=6, freeway 6 cars: same as freeway 5, since cars listed same? Freeway 6 has same cars: (-12,-23,right,12), etc.\n\nAt ΔT=4\n\nFirst: [ -23+48, -12+48]= [25,36]\n\nSecond: [13+48,24+48]= [61,72]\n\nThird: [49+48,60+48]= [97,108]\n\n0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=7, freeway 7 cars: same, ΔT=5\n\nFirst: [ -23+60, -12+60]= [37,48]\n\nSecond: [13+60,24+60]= [73,84]\n\nThird: [49+60,60+60]= [109,120]\n\n0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=8, freeway 8 car: (96,49,right,48), ΔT=6, [49+288,96+288]= [337,384], no. Safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=9, no freeway.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7, with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and in this case it works.\n\nBut perhaps I misread the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5, the second car is listed as (24,13,right,12), but with τ=13, h=24, so at t1, span [13,24], which is fine.\n\nBut at turn 4, as I thought earlier, the first car on freeway 5 has span [ -11,0], so if I were there, I collide, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1 and 2, at turn 8 (ΔT=5), first car span [ -41+30, -30+30]= [-11,0], 0 in, but at turn 8, I am on y=7, not on freeway 1 or 2.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be all U.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in fewer turns? Impossible, since from 2 to 9, 7 steps needed.\n\nUnless I can skip, but no, y changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nNow, the answer should be:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut H=7, actions from t=3 to t=9.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1 +0} = a3\n\nt=1, a4, ..., t=6, a9\n\nWith H=7.\n\nAnd position at turn t1 + H = 3+7=10, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the output, it should list each turn action.\n\nPerhaps I should write it as:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 9: U\n\nSince H=7.\n\nBut is there any reason why this might not work? I think I covered all.\n\nPerhaps the car on freeway 3 at turn 4, but span is [97,144], fine.\n\nAnother thing: the freeway indices, y=1 to 8, and I go from 2 to 3 to4 etc.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 1 and 2 have the same cars, but that's fine.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 have the same car, but different freeways, so separate.\n\nIn this case, no problem.\n\nPerhaps I can check if at turn 3, on y=2, but freeway 2 has cars, but as above, safe.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7, with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem might be that for some freeways, multiple cars, but in this case, all are safe at the times I am there.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if staying or down is needed, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe vertical position changes by at most ±1 per turn, so moving from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 7 upward moves. Thus, \\(H = 7\\) is the minimum possible.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this with \\(H = 7\\) is to move up (U) at every turn from turn 3 to turn 9. This results in the following positions:\n- Turn 3: position \\(y = 2\\) (after action, but collision check at turn 3 with \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 4: position \\(y = 3\\)\n- Turn 5: position \\(y = 4\\)\n- Turn 6: position \\(y = 5\\)\n- Turn 7: position \\(y = 6\\)\n- Turn 8: position \\(y = 7\\)\n- Turn 9: position \\(y = 8\\)\n- Turn 10: position \\(y = 9\\) (reached, no collision as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars)\n\nCollision checks are performed at each turn for the current freeway (if \\(y \\in [1, 8]\\)), and 0 must not be in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn. The car spans are calculated based on the initial state at turn 3 (\\(t_1\\)) and the time difference \\(\\Delta T = T - 3\\).\n\n### Collision Verification for the Path:\n- **Turn 3 (\\(T = 3\\), \\(y = 2\\))**:  \n  Freeway 2 cars:  \n  - Car 1: \\(\\tau = -41\\), \\(h = -30\\), \\(s = 6\\), \\(\\Delta T = 0\\), span = \\([-41, -30]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 2: \\(\\tau = 7\\), \\(h = 18\\), \\(s = 6\\), \\(\\Delta T = 0\\), span = \\([7, 18]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 4 (\\(T = 4\\), \\(y = 3\\))**:  \n  Freeway 3 car:  \n  - Car: \\(\\tau = 49\\), \\(h = 96\\), \\(s = 48\\), \\(\\Delta T = 1\\), span = \\([49 + 48, 96 + 48] = [97, 144]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 5 (\\(T = 5\\), \\(y = 4\\))**:  \n  Freeway 4 car:  \n  - Car: \\(\\tau = 49\\), \\(h = 96\\), \\(s = 48\\), \\(\\Delta T = 2\\), span = \\([49 + 96, 96 + 96] = [145, 192]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 6 (\\(T = 6\\), \\(y = 5\\))**:  \n  Freeway 5 cars:  \n  - Car 1: \\(\\tau = -23\\), \\(h = -12\\), \\(s = 12\\), \\(\\Delta T = 3\\), span = \\([-23 + 36, -12 + 36] = [13, 24]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 2: \\(\\tau = 13\\), \\(h = 24\\), \\(s = 12\\), \\(\\Delta T = 3\\), span = \\([13 + 36, 24 + 36] = [49, 60]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 3: \\(\\tau = 49\\), \\(h = 60\\), \\(s = 12\\), \\(\\Delta T = 3\\), span = \\([49 + 36, 60 + 36] = [85, 96]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 7 (\\(T = 7\\), \\(y = 6\\))**:  \n  Freeway 6 cars (same as freeway 5):  \n  - Car 1: \\(\\tau = -23\\), \\(h = -12\\), \\(s = 12\\), \\(\\Delta T = 4\\), span = \\([-23 + 48, -12 + 48] = [25, 36]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 2: \\(\\tau = 13\\), \\(h = 24\\), \\(s = 12\\), \\(\\Delta T = 4\\), span = \\([13 + 48, 24 + 48] = [61, 72]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 3: \\(\\tau = 49\\), \\(h = 60\\), \\(s = 12\\), \\(\\Delta T = 4\\), span = \\([49 + 48, 60 + 48] = [97, 108]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 8 (\\(T = 8\\), \\(y = 7\\))**:  \n  Freeway 7 cars (same as freeway 5):  \n  - Car 1: \\(\\tau = -23\\), \\(h = -12\\), \\(s = 12\\), \\(\\Delta T = 5\\), span = \\([-23 + 60, -12 + 60] = [37, 48]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 2: \\(\\tau = 13\\), \\(h = 24\\), \\(s = 12\\), \\(\\Delta T = 5\\), span = \\([13 + 60, 24 + 60] = [73, 84]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  - Car 3: \\(\\tau = 49\\), \\(h = 60\\), \\(s = 12\\), \\(\\Delta T = 5\\), span = \\([49 + 60, 60 + 60] = [109, 120]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 9 (\\(T = 9\\), \\(y = 8\\))**:  \n  Freeway 8 car:  \n  - Car: \\(\\tau = 49\\), \\(h = 96\\), \\(s = 48\\), \\(\\Delta T = 6\\), span = \\([49 + 288, 96 + 288] = [337, 384]\\) → 0 not in span.  \n  **Safe.**\n\n- **Turn 10 (\\(y = 9\\))**: No freeway, safe.\n\nAll positions are collision-free, and \\(y = 9\\) is reached at turn 10 after 7 actions starting from turn 3.

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 4, and the player is at (0,3). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is in the y-direction only.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (where y from 1 to 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nAlso note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player moves to y_{T+1}. Therefore, at turn T, we only check the freeway y_T for collision.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn from t1 to the turn before reaching (0,9). Once we reach (0,9), we stop and that is the last turn.\n\nThe car update:\nFor a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s:\n- For a left-moving car: the span at time T (>=t1) is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- For a right-moving car: the span at time T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the given cars are all right-moving? Because in the table, the direction is written as \"right\". So we'll use the right-moving formula.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 4. We are to compute for T >= 4.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=3 to y=9 without stepping on a freeway row (from 1 to 8) at a turn when a car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are to minimize H, the number of turns (so the sequence length is H, from turn t1=4 to turn t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1 the player must be at y=9).\n\nNote: The player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nApproach:\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the states (turn, y) to find the minimal H. However, the turn can go to infinity? But note that the cars are moving and their positions are linear in time. Since we are only concerned with when the car spans cover 0, we can compute for each freeway and each car the time intervals (if any) during which 0 is in the car's span.\n\nAlternatively, we can simulate turn by turn and check for collisions. Since we are minimizing H, we can try to go as fast as possible (with U) but avoiding collisions.\n\nBut note: we start at y=3 and need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles is 6 moves (all U). However, we have obstacles on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe have to avoid being on a freeway row at a turn when a car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nLet me precompute for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the set of turns T (>=4) for which 0 is in the car's span.\n\nBut note: the turns are integers, so T is integer.\n\nFor a right-moving car: span at T is [tau + s*(T-4), h + s*(T-4)]\n\nCondition for 0 in the span: \ntau + s*(T-4) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-4)\n\nBut note: the car state is given at t1=4.\n\nLet me write for each car:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars\nCar1: (-24, -35, right, 6) -> but wait, head and tail: typically head is the front? For right-moving, the front is at the higher x? But the representation: (-24, -35) and (24,13). Also note: the representation says (head, tail) but for right-moving, the head should be greater than tail? However, we see (-24, -35): here -24 > -35? Actually, in the update for right-moving: [tau + s*(T-4), h + s*(T-4)] and we are told that the car span at T is that interval. So the head at time 4 is at h, and tail at tau. For the first car: h=-24, tau=-35. Then at time T, the tail becomes -35 + 6*(T-4) and the head becomes -24 + 6*(T-4). Similarly for the other car: h=24, tau=13 -> tail at 13+6*(T-4), head at 24+6*(T-4).\n\nBut wait: the update rule for right-moving is: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] -> so the interval is [tail moving, head moving] and the tail moves from tau to increasing, and head moves from h to increasing.\n\nSo for the first car on freeway1 at time T: \ntail = -35 + 6*(T-4)\nhead = -24 + 6*(T-4)\n\nWe require 0 to be between tail and head? Actually, the span is [tail, head] if tail<=head? But note: -35+6*(T-4) <= -24+6*(T-4) always. So the condition is:\n-35 + 6*(T-4) <= 0 <= -24 + 6*(T-4)\n\nSimilarly, for the second car on freeway1:\ntail = 13 + 6*(T-4)\nhead = 24 + 6*(T-4)\nCondition: 13+6*(T-4) <= 0 <= 24+6*(T-4)\n\nBut wait, 13+6*(T-4) is always positive for T>=4? So 0 cannot be in the second car? Similarly, the first car condition:\n\nFirst car on freeway1:\n-35 + 6*(T-4) <= 0 <= -24 + 6*(T-4)\n\nLet me solve:\nLeft: -35 + 6*(T-4) <= 0 -> 6*(T-4) <= 35 -> T-4 <= 35/6 ≈ 5.83 -> T <= 9.83 -> so T<=9\nRight: 0 <= -24 + 6*(T-4) -> 24 <= 6*(T-4) -> 4 <= T-4 -> T>=8\n\nSo for T in [8,9] (since T integer) -> T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 is same as freeway1? The table says freeway2 has the same cars: (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6). So same as freeway1: dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway3: one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\ntail = -95 + 48*(T-4)\nhead = -48 + 48*(T-4)\n\nCondition: -95+48*(T-4) <= 0 <= -48+48*(T-4)\n\nLeft: -95+48*(T-4) <= 0 -> 48*(T-4) <= 95 -> T-4 <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979 -> T<=5.979 -> T<=5\nRight: 0 <= -48+48*(T-4) -> 48 <= 48*(T-4) -> 1 <= T-4 -> T>=5\n\nSo T=5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4: same as freeway3? The table says same car: (-48,-95,right,48) -> so dangerous at T=5.\n\nFreeway5: three cars: \n(0, -11, right, 12), (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11 -> at T: tail=-11+12*(T-4), head=0+12*(T-4)=12*(T-4)\nCondition: -11+12*(T-4) <= 0 <= 12*(T-4)\n\nLeft: -11+12*(T-4)<=0 -> 12*(T-4)<=11 -> T-4<=11/12≈0.916 -> T<=4.916 -> T<=4\nRight: 0<=12*(T-4) -> T>=4\nSo T=4? But note: at T=4, we are at the current turn. The player is at (0,3) at T=4, and we are going to start taking actions from turn 4 onwards. The problem says: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway, then collision.\n\nBut at T=4, the player is on freeway? The freeway rows are 1 to 8. The player is at y=3 (which is freeway3) at T=4. And freeway3 has a car that is dangerous at T=5? Actually, freeway5 is row5.\n\nAt T=4, the player is on row3? So we check freeway3? But freeway3 has a car that is dangerous at T=5, not T=4.\n\nBut for freeway5, the first car: at T=4, the condition becomes:\ntail = -11+12*(0)= -11\nhead = 0\nSo the span is [-11,0]. Is 0 included? Yes. So at T=4, if the player were on freeway5, it would be dangerous. But the player is not on freeway5 at T=4.\n\nNow, the condition we computed for freeway5 first car: T=4 is the only solution? Because T must be >=4. So T=4.\n\nBut wait: we also have to check the other cars on freeway5.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12) -> wait, head=36, tail=25? But then at T=4: tail=25+12*(0)=25, head=36. Then the condition: 25<=0<=36? -> false. So not dangerous at any T? Because 25+12*(T-4) is increasing and at T=4 it's 25, which is >0. So never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (-48,-59,right,12): tail=-59+12*(T-4), head=-48+12*(T-4)\nCondition: -59+12*(T-4)<=0<=-48+12*(T-4)\nLeft: -59+12*(T-4)<=0 -> T-4<=59/12≈4.916 -> T<=8.916 -> T<=8\nRight: 0<=-48+12*(T-4) -> 48<=12*(T-4) -> 4<=T-4 -> T>=8\nSo T=8.\n\nThus freeway5 is dangerous at T=4 (from first car) and T=8 (from third car). But note: at T=4, the player is not on freeway5 (player is at y=3). So we only care when the player is on freeway5 at a dangerous turn.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: same as freeway5? The table says same three cars. So dangerous at T=4 and T=8.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway5: dangerous at T=4 and T=8.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway3 and 4: one car (-48,-95,right,48) -> dangerous at T=5.\n\nSummary of dangerous turns per freeway row:\n\nRow 1: T=8,9\nRow 2: T=8,9\nRow 3: T=5\nRow 4: T=5\nRow 5: T=4,8   [but note: T=4 is the starting turn, and we are at y=3, so not on row5 at T=4]\nRow 6: T=4,8\nRow 7: T=4,8\nRow 8: T=5\n\nWe are at T=4, y=3.\n\nWe must avoid:\n- On row1 at T=8 or 9\n- On row2 at T=8 or 9\n- On row3 at T=5\n- On row4 at T=5\n- On row5 at T=4 or 8 -> but T=4 is passed (we are at T=4 and on row3, so row5 at T=4 is not an issue) so only T=8\n- On row6 at T=4 or 8 -> T=4 passed (we are not on row6 at T=4) so only T=8\n- On row7 at T=4 or 8 -> T=4 passed, so only T=8\n- On row8 at T=5\n\nOur goal: reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nMinimal moves: 6 steps of U: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9: that would take 6 moves, so at turn T=4+6-1 = 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, we are at row9? Actually, the grid is from y=0 to 9, and freeways are 1 to 8. So y=9 is the top, and we are safe.\n\nBut during the journey, we must avoid being on a dangerous row at a dangerous turn.\n\nLet's simulate the minimal path (always U) and see the turns and rows:\n\nTurn T=4: y=3 (row3) -> but row3 is dangerous at T=5? Not at T=4. So safe.\n\nThen we move: \nAction at T=4: U -> y=4 at T=5? Wait, no: \nAt T=4, we are at y=3. Then we take an action at T=4 to move to next turn T=5.\nAfter action at T=4: \n  if U: y_5 = 3+1 = 4\n  if D: y_5 = 3-1=2\n  if S: y_5=3\n\nBut at turn T=5, we are at y_5. And we check row y_5 at T=5.\n\nIf we go U at T=4, then at T=5 we are at row4. And row4 is dangerous at T=5! So collision.\n\nSo we cannot go U at T=4 because then at T=5 we are on row4 and row4 is dangerous at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, if we go S at T=4: then at T=5 we are at row3. Row3 is dangerous at T=5 -> collision.\n\nIf we go D at T=4: then at T=5 we are at row2. Row2 is dangerous only at T=8 and 9? Not at T=5. So safe.\n\nBut we are going down to row2, which is further from the goal.\n\nSo we must avoid row3 and row4 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, we cannot be on row3 or row4.\n\nSo what can we do at T=4? Only D is safe: then at T=5 we are at row2.\n\nThen at T=5, we are at row2. Now we can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to avoid row2 at T=8 and T=9? But T=5 is not 8 or 9, so safe.\n\nBut then we have to get to 9 from 2. We need to go up 7 steps? So at least 7 moves from T=5, so total turns: 1 (at T=4) + 7 = 8 moves? Then the last turn is T=4+8-1 = 11? But we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, we might wait at row2 for a while? But row2 is dangerous at T=8 and 9, so we must leave row2 before T=8? Or be not on row2 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nWe can try to go to row1? But row1 is dangerous at T=8,9. And row0 is safe? But row0 is not a freeway? The freeways are only 1 to 8. So row0 (y=0) is safe? The collision condition only applies when on freeway (y=1..8). So y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nSo we can go down to row0 to avoid the dangers.\n\nBut we have to eventually go up.\n\nLet me try to plan:\n\nOption: \nT=4: D -> y=2 at T=5. (safe, because row2 is not dangerous at T=5)\nT=5: we are at y=2. Now we can go D to y=1 at T=6? Or U to y=3 at T=6? Or S.\n\nBut note: at T=6, we can be at row1, row2, or row3? But row3: dangerous at T=5? No, T=5 is over. Row3 is only dangerous at T=5, so at T=6 it is safe? Similarly, row4 only at T=5 -> safe at T=6.\n\nBut row1 and row2 are dangerous at T=8,9. So we must avoid being on row1 or row2 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nSimilarly, row5,6,7 are dangerous at T=8.\n\nSo we must avoid row5,6,7 at T=8 and row1,2 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAlso, we must avoid row8 at T=5? But T=5 is over.\n\nSo from T=5 onward, we are at y=2.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal moves from y=2 to y=9 is 7 moves (all U). But we have to avoid the dangers at T=8 and T=9.\n\nIf we go up as fast as possible from T=5:\n\nT=5: y=2\nT=5: action U -> T=6: y=3\nT=6: U -> T=7: y=4\nT=7: U -> T=8: y=5\nBut at T=8: y=5 -> row5 is dangerous at T=8 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on row5 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, if we go faster? We cannot because we start at T=5 at y=2 and we need 7 moves to 9. At T=8, we would be at y=2+ (8-5) = 5? Because from T=5 to T=8: 3 moves, so if we do U every time, we go from 2 to 5 in 3 moves? Actually, from T=5 (after the move at T=5) we are at y=2? Then we take actions at T=5, T=6, T=7 to get to T=8.\n\nAfter action at T=5: we move to y at T=6.\nAfter action at T=6: to T=7.\nAfter action at T=7: to T=8.\n\nSo if we do U at T=5, T=6, T=7: then at T=8 we are at y=2+3=5 -> collision.\n\nWe can try to go faster? But we can only move one step per turn. So we cannot skip.\n\nSo we must not be on row5 at T=8. Similarly, row6 and row7 at T=8 are also dangerous.\n\nSo we must avoid rows 5,6,7 at T=8 and rows 1,2 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAlso, note that at T=9, we must avoid row1 and row2.\n\nBut we are going to 9, so we might be at row8 or row9 at T=9? But row8 is dangerous only at T=5? So safe at T=9. Row9 is safe.\n\nSo one idea: at T=8, we must be on a row that is not 1,2,5,6,7. So available rows: 0,3,4,8,9.\n\nBut we are going up, so 0 is too low. We want to be as high as possible.\n\nWe can try to be at row8 at T=8? Then at T=9 we can go to row9.\n\nBut row8 is safe at T=8? Row8 is dangerous only at T=5? So safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, row3 and row4 are safe at T=8.\n\nBut how to get to row8 by T=8?\n\nWe are at T=5: y=2.\n\nWe need to go from 2 to 8 in 3 moves (from T=5 to T=8: we have 3 moves: T=5,6,7). But 2 to 8 is 6 steps? So we need 6 moves. Impossible in 3 moves.\n\nSo we cannot be at row8 by T=8.\n\nWe might be at row4 at T=8? Then we have to go from 4 to 9 in ... but we have to avoid T=9 on row1 and row2? But row4 to row9: 5 moves, so at T=9 we would be at row4+? \n\nWait, let me define the state:\n\nAt turn T, we are at y(T). The action at T will determine y(T+1).\n\nWe start at T=5: y=2.\n\nWe have to plan for T=5,6,7,8,9,... until we reach 9.\n\nWe must avoid at each turn T (>=5) being on a row that is dangerous at T.\n\nDangerous rows at T=5: none? Because row3 and row4 were dangerous at T=5, but we are past T=5? At T=5, we are already at row2 (safe). Then at T=6, no row is dangerous? Only row8 was dangerous at T=5? So at T=6, no danger? Then at T=7, no danger? Then at T=8: rows1,2,5,6,7 are dangerous.\n\nSo:\n\nT=5: we are at row2 (safe). Then we take an action.\n\nT=6: we can be at row1,2,3 (if we go D, S, U from row2). \nBut row1 and row2 are not dangerous at T=6? Only at T=8 and 9. So safe.\n\nT=7: same, no danger.\n\nT=8: we must not be on row1,2,5,6,7.\n\nSo at T=8, we must be on row0,3,4,8,9.\n\nBut we are at row? at T=7: we are at some row, then we take an action to go to T=8.\n\nSo we need to choose a sequence from T=5 to T=8 such that at T=8 we are at a safe row.\n\nAnd then from there we go to 9.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we want to get to 9 as soon as possible.\n\nFrom T=5 (y=2) to T=8 (3 moves: T=5,6,7) we can only move 3 steps at most. So the maximum we can go up is to 2+3=5. But row5 is dangerous at T=8. So we cannot be at row5 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, row6 and row7: we cannot reach from 2 in 3 moves? 2->5: 3 moves? Actually, we can do U,U,U: from 2 to 5. But row5 is dangerous.\n\nWe can do U,U,D: then at T=8: y=2+1+1-1=3? So row3: safe at T=8.\n\nOr U,U,S: then y=2+1+1+0=4? row4: safe at T=8.\n\nOr U,D,U: same as U,U,D? Let me see:\n\nT=5: start at y=2\n  action U: T=6: y=3\n  action U: T=7: y=4\n  action D: T=8: y=3 -> row3: safe.\n\nOr \nT=5: U -> T=6: y=3\nT=6: U -> T=7: y=4\nT=7: S -> T=8: y=4 -> row4: safe.\n\nOr \nT=5: U -> T=6: y=3\nT=6: S -> T=7: y=3\nT=7: U -> T=8: y=4 -> safe.\n\nBut note: we are at row3 at T=7? But row3 is not dangerous at T=7? Only at T=5. So safe.\n\nThen at T=8 we are at row3 or row4.\n\nThen we need to go to row9. From row3: 6 steps? From row4: 5 steps.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nOption 1: at T=8: y=3 -> then we need to go to 9: 6 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U. Then the last move is at T=8+6-1 = T=13? Total turns from start: we started at T=4, then we did 1 move at T=4 (D), then 3 moves at T=5,6,7, then 6 moves from T=8 to T=13? Actually, the moves:\n\nTurn4: D -> to T=5: y=2\nTurn5: U -> T=6: y=3\nTurn6: U -> T=7: y=4\nTurn7: D -> T=8: y=3\nThen we need to go from y=3 to y=9: 6 moves: so at Turn8: U, Turn9: U, ... until Turn13: U -> then at T=14: y=9? Actually, after the move at Turn13, the next state is at T=14: y=9. But we must have y=9 at the last action turn? The problem says: the sequence of actions until we reach (0,9). The last action should put us at 9.\n\nBut let me count the number of turns: \nWe start at T=4: we are at y=3.\nThen we do actions at T=4,5,..., up to the action that makes the next state y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn T=4+H, and the position is y_{4+H} = 9.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and after that action we are at y=9.\n\nSo the state after the last action is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we must avoid collisions at every turn from t1 to the turn before the goal? Actually, the collision condition is checked at every turn T from t1 to the turn when we are at the goal? But note: when we are at the goal (0,9) at turn T, we stop and we don't check for collision? Because we are not on a freeway? Freeways are 1-8, and 9 is safe.\n\nBut the problem says: collision occurs at turn T only if we are on a freeway (y=1..8) and 0 in the span. So at the turn when we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nBut during the journey, we are at freeways at turns when we are at y=1..8.\n\nSo in the sequence, we must avoid collision at every turn T (from t1 to the last turn when we are at a freeway) and then at the last turn we are at y=9.\n\nIn the above plan, we are at T=14: y=9, so the last action is at T=13. Then the sequence has H = 13 - 4 + 1 = 10 actions? \n\nBut we want minimal H.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at row4 at T=8: then from row4 to row9: 5 moves. So last action at T=8+5-1 = T=12. Then H = 12 - 4 + 1 = 9.\n\nHow to be at row4 at T=8?\n\nWe can do:\n\nT=4: D -> T=5: y=2\nT=5: U -> T=6: y=3\nT=6: U -> T=7: y=4\nT=7: S -> T=8: y=4   (safe at T=8 because row4 is not dangerous at T=8)\n\nThen from T=8: we are at y=4. We need to go to 9: 5 moves: U,U,U,U,U.\n\nSo actions:\nT=8: U -> T=9: y=5\nT=9: U -> T=10: y=6\nT=10: U -> T=11: y=7\nT=11: U -> T=12: y=8\nT=12: U -> T=13: y=9\n\nBut wait, at T=9: we are at row5. But row5 is dangerous at T=8? But T=9 is not T=8. So safe? However, row5 is also dangerous at T=8? But we are at row5 at T=9. So we need to check: for row5, dangerous at T=4 and T=8. T=9 is safe. Similarly, row6: dangerous at T=4 and T=8 -> safe at T=9. Row7: same. Row8: dangerous at T=5 -> safe at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9: we are at row5 -> safe.\n\nBut what about row1 and row2 at T=9? We are not there.\n\nSo the entire sequence:\n\nT=4: D\nT=5: U\nT=6: U\nT=7: S\nT=8: U\nT=9: U\nT=10: U\nT=11: U\nT=12: U\n\nThen at T=13: y=9. So the last action is at T=12. The number of actions: from T=4 to T=12: 9 actions.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe might avoid going down at the beginning.\n\nAlternative: at T=4, we go S? But then at T=5 we are at row3 -> collision (because row3 is dangerous at T=5). So not possible.\n\nOr go U: then at T=5 we are at row4 -> collision (row4 dangerous at T=5). \n\nSo we must go D at T=4.\n\nBut is there a way to not go down? We could go up later? But we have to avoid row3 and row4 at T=5.\n\nWe cannot stay at row3 at T=5 (by S) and we cannot go to row4 at T=5 (by U) and we cannot go to row2 at T=5 without going down? Actually, from row3, we can go down to row2 at T=5. That's the only safe move.\n\nSo we must go down at T=4.\n\nThen we are at row2 at T=5.\n\nNow, can we go up faster? We did U at T=5 and T=6 to get to row4 at T=7, then S to stay at row4 at T=8.\n\nBut we could go up more? We started at row2 at T=5. We did two U's and then a S. But we could do three U's? Then at T=8 we would be at row5 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nWe could go to row0? \n\nAt T=5: we are at row2. \nWe can go D to row1 at T=6? Then at T=6: row1 -> safe (because row1 dangerous only at T=8,9). Then at T=6: we can go D again to row0 at T=7? Then at T=7: row0 (safe). Then at T=7: we can go U to row1 at T=8? But row1 at T=8 is dangerous.\n\nSo we must not be on row1 at T=8.\n\nAlternatively, at T=7: we are at row0. Then at T=7: we can go U to row1 at T=8? -> collision.\n\nOr we can stay at row0 at T=8? Then safe. But then we are at row0 at T=8. Then we need to go to row9: 9 moves. That would be too long.\n\nSo not minimal.\n\nAnother idea: at T=5 (row2), we go U to row3 at T=6. Then at T=6: we are at row3 -> safe (only dangerous at T=5). Then at T=6: we can go U to row4 at T=7 -> safe. Then at T=7: we can go U to row5 at T=8? -> collision (row5 at T=8).\n\nSo we must avoid row5 at T=8. Therefore, at T=7, if we are at row4, we cannot go U to row5 at T=8. We can only go S (stay at row4) or D (to row3) or U? But U leads to row5 at T=8 -> collision.\n\nSo we have to do S or D at T=7.\n\nIf we do S: then at T=8: row4 -> safe.\n\nThen we proceed as before.\n\nIf we do D: then at T=8: row3 -> safe.\n\nThen from row3 at T=8, we need 6 moves to 9: so last action at T=13, which is more than 9.\n\nSo the minimal is the sequence that gets us to row4 at T=8 and then 5 moves to 9: total 9 moves.\n\nBut wait, can we get to a higher row than 4 at T=8 without being on a dangerous row?\n\nWe can go to row8 at T=8? But from row2 at T=5 to row8: we need 6 moves. But we have only 3 moves (T=5,6,7). So impossible.\n\nSimilarly, row9: 7 moves from row2 -> impossible.\n\nSo row4 is the highest we can be at T=8 safely.\n\nBut what about row3? We can be at row3 at T=8 and then go to row9 in 6 moves: total moves from start: 1 (at T=4) + 3 (T=5,6,7) + 6 (T=8 to T=13) = 10 moves.\n\nBut we have a sequence with 9 moves.\n\nSo the sequence we have:\n\nT=4: D\nT=5: U\nT=6: U\nT=7: S\nT=8: U\nT=9: U\nT=10: U\nT=11: U\nT=12: U\n\nBut wait, we are at row4 at T=8. Then we do U at T=8: to row5 at T=9 -> safe? Because row5 is dangerous at T=8, but at T=9 it is safe? Yes.\n\nThen we do U at T=9: to row6 at T=10 -> safe? Row6 dangerous at T=8? Not at T=10 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=10: U to row7 at T=11 -> safe.\nT=11: U to row8 at T=12 -> safe? Row8 dangerous at T=5? Not at T=12 -> safe.\nT=12: U to row9 at T=13 -> goal.\n\nSo we have 9 actions: from T=4 to T=12.\n\nBut can we do 8 moves? That would mean reaching at T=12? But we start at T=4, so 8 moves: last action at T=11, and then at T=12 we are at y=9.\n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at T=12.\n\nBut we start at y=3 at T=4. Then we do 8 moves. The net upward movement must be 6 (from 3 to 9). So the sum of upward moves minus downward moves must be 6.\n\nBut we have to avoid the dangers.\n\nWe must be at T=5: not on row3 or row4 -> so we must go down to row2 at T=5 (so one D).\n\nThen from T=5 to T=12: 7 moves? And we need to go from y=2 to y=9: net +7? But we have 7 moves? So we need all U? But then we would be at y=2+7=9 at T=12? \n\nBut we have to avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, at T=8: we must not be on row1,2,5,6,7.\n\nBut if we go all U from T=5 (y=2) to T=12: \nT=5: y=2 (safe)\nT=5: U -> T=6: y=3\nT=6: U -> T=7: y=4\nT=7: U -> T=8: y=5 -> collision (row5 at T=8)\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nWe have to deviate.\n\nBut we have 7 moves to go from 2 to 9: net +7. So we must have 7 U and 0 D? Because any D would require extra U. But we only have 7 moves. So we must do exactly 7 U and 0 D? Then we go from 2 to 9 in 7 moves.\n\nBut then at T=8 we are at y=2+ (T=5 to T=8: 3 moves) = 5 -> collision.\n\nSo we must do at least one non-U move? But then we cannot get to 9 in 7 moves? Because if we do 6 U and 1 D: then net +5 -> from 2 to 7. Not enough.\n\nOr 7 U and 1 D and 1 extra move? But we have only 7 moves.\n\nSo impossible to do in 7 moves from T=5? Then total moves from T=4: 1 (at T=4: D) + 7 = 8? But then the last action is at T=4+8-1 = T=11, and then at T=12: y=9.\n\nBut we cannot get from y=2 to y=9 in 7 moves without being at row5 at T=8.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it without going to row4 at T=8.\n\nAlternative: at T=4: D (to row2 at T=5)\nThen at T=5: we don't go up immediately? We go down to row1 at T=6? Then at T=6: row1 -> safe. Then at T=6: we go down to row0 at T=7? Then at T=7: row0 -> safe. Then at T=7: we go up to row1 at T=8? But row1 at T=8 is dangerous. So we cannot.\n\nAt T=7: we stay at row0? Then at T=8: row0 -> safe. Then we need to go from row0 to row9: 9 moves. That would be 1 (T=4) + 2 (T=5 and T=6: two downs) + 1 (T=7: S or U? We are at row0, we did two downs? Then at T=7 we are at row0. Then we do 9 moves: total moves: 1+2+9=12 -> too long.\n\nWe could go up at T=7 to row1? But then at T=8: row1 -> collision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nAnother idea: wait at row2 for one turn? \n\nAt T=5: row2, then at T=5: S -> T=6: row2 (safe). Then we have two moves (T=6 and T=7) to get to a safe row at T=8.\n\nFrom row2 at T=6: \nT=6: U -> T=7: row3\nT=7: U -> T=8: row4 -> safe.\n\nThen from row4 at T=8: then we do 5 U's: last action at T=12. Total moves: \nT=4: D\nT=5: S\nT=6: U\nT=7: U\nT=8: U\nT=9: U\nT=10: U\nT=11: U\nT=12: U\n\nThat is 9 moves as well.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we started by going down at T=4, then we did a stay at T=5, then two U's to get to row4 at T=8? Then 5 U's.\n\nTotal moves: 9.\n\nBut in the first plan we did not have the stay at T=5: we did U at T=5 and T=6 to get to row4 at T=7, then stay at T=7 to remain at row4 at T=8.\n\nWhich one is better? Same number of moves.\n\nBut the first plan we did:\n\nT=4: D\nT=5: U\nT=6: U\nT=7: S\nT=8: U\nT=9: U\nT=10: U\nT=11: U\nT=12: U\n\nThat's 9 moves.\n\nThe alternative with a stay at T=5:\n\nT=4: D\nT=5: S\nT=6: U\nT=7: U\nT=8: U\nT=9: U\nT=10: U\nT=11: U\nT=12: U\n\nAlso 9 moves.\n\nBut note: in the first plan, at T=7 we did a stay, and in the second plan we did a stay at T=5. \n\nIs there a way to avoid the stay and do 8 moves?\n\nWe need to get from y=3 at T=4 to y=9 at T=12 (if H=9) but we want H=8? Then we would be at y=9 at T=11? \n\nWith 8 moves: we start at T=4: y=3.\nThen after 8 moves, at T=12: y=9.\n\nBut we must go down at T=4 to avoid collision at T=5. So T=4: D -> T=5: y=2.\n\nThen we have 7 moves from T=5 to T=11 to get from y=2 to y=9: net +7. So we need 7 U and 0 D? But then we go:\n\nT=5: U -> T=6: y=3\nT=6: U -> T=7: y=4\nT=7: U -> T=8: y=5 -> collision at T=8.\n\nIf we do 6 U and 1 D: net +5 -> from 2 to 7 -> not enough.\n\nIf we do 7 U and 1 D and 1 extra move? But we have only 7 moves.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, we have two sequences. Both are 9 moves. We can choose either.\n\nBut note: in the first sequence (without the stay at T=5) we are at row4 at T=7? Then we stay so at T=8 we are at row4.\n\nIn the second sequence, we are at row2 at T=5 and T=6? Then we go up to row3 at T=7 and row4 at T=8.\n\nBut in the second sequence, at T=6: we are at row2. Is row2 dangerous at T=6? No, only at T=8 and 9. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=7: row3? Safe.\n\nWe can choose the first one.\n\nBut let me write the first sequence:\n\nTurn4: D\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: S\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\n\nBut wait, after the last action (Turn12: U), we are at T=13: y=9. So we have reached at T=13.\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence of actions from t1 (4) to t1+H-1. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1=12, so H=9.\n\nNow, we must verify that we avoid collisions at every turn.\n\nWe'll list the turn and the player's y at that turn (which is the row we check for collision).\n\nTurn T=4: y=3 -> freeway3? Check: freeway3 dangerous at T=4? We computed: freeway3 dangerous at T=5? Not at T=4? But we need to check the car on freeway3 at T=4.\n\nWe computed for freeway3: dangerous at T=5. But let me double-check:\n\nFreeway3: car (-48,-95,right,48) at T=4:\ntail = -95 + 48*(0) = -95\nhead = -48 + 0 = -48\nSo the span is [-95, -48]. 0 is not in this interval? So safe at T=4.\n\nTurn T=5: after action D at T=4, we are at y=2. So freeway2? \nFreeway2: dangerous at T=5? We computed: freeway2 dangerous at T=8,9? Not at T=5. \nCars on freeway2: same as freeway1: two cars. \nAt T=5: \nFirst car: tail=-35+6*(5-4)= -35+6=-29, head=-24+6=-18 -> span [-29,-18] -> 0 not in.\nSecond car: tail=13+6=19, head=24+6=30 -> [19,30] -> 0 not in.\nSo safe.\n\nTurn T=6: we did U at T=5: so y=3. Freeway3? \nAt T=6: \ncar: tail=-95+48*(6-4)= -95+96=1, head=-48+48*2=48 -> [1,48] -> 0 not in? (since 1>0) -> safe.\n\nBut wait, at T=5 freeway3 was dangerous? We computed T=5: \ntail=-95+48*(1)= -47? Wait: T-4=1 -> tail=-95+48= -47, head=-48+48=0 -> so [ -47, 0]. Then 0 is included? \n\nI think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nFor freeway3: \nCondition: tail <=0<=head\nAt T=5: tail=-95+48*(5-4)= -95+48=-47, head=-48+48=0.\nSo -47<=0<=0 -> true. So at T=5, freeway3 is dangerous.\n\nBut at T=6: tail=-95+48*2= -95+96=1, head=-48+96=48 -> 1<=0<=48? 0<1 -> false. So safe.\n\nSo at T=5, freeway3 is dangerous. Therefore, we must not be on freeway3 at T=5.\n\nIn our sequence, at T=5 we are at freeway2? So safe.\n\nNow, at T=6: we are at freeway3? But T=6 is not T=5 -> safe.\n\nNow, in the sequence:\n\nT=4: y=3 -> freeway3: safe (as computed: [-95,-48] doesn't contain 0)\nT=5: y=2 -> freeway2: safe (as above, no car covers 0 at T=5)\nT=6: y=3 -> freeway3: at T=6: [1,48] -> 0 not in -> safe\nT=7: we did U at T=6: so y=4? Then at T=7: freeway4? \nFreeway4: same as freeway3? Car (-48,-95,right,48) at T=7:\ntail=-95+48*(7-4)= -95+144=49\nhead=-48+144=96 -> [49,96] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nBut we did at T=7: S? So we are still at y=4 at T=8? \nAt T=7: we did S, so at T=8: y=4? \nBut the action at T=7 determines the state at T=8.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nAt the start of T=7: we are at y=4 (because at T=7 we are at the state after the action at T=6: which was U from y=3 at T=6 to y=4 at T=7).\n\nThen at T=7, we do action S: so we stay at y=4 for the next turn, which is T=8.\n\nSo at T=8: we are at y=4.\n\nNow, freeway4 at T=8: \ncar: tail=-95+48*(8-4)= -95+192=97, head=-48+192=144 -> [97,144] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen we do U at T=8: so at T=9: y=5.\nFreeway5 at T=9: \nCars: \nFirst car: (0,-11,right,12): at T=9: tail=-11+12*(9-4)= -11+60=49, head=0+60=60 -> [49,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12): tail=25+60=85, head=36+60=96 -> [85,96] -> safe.\nThird car: (-48,-59,right,12): tail=-59+60=1, head=-48+60=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nT=9: we do U: to y=6 at T=10.\nFreeway6 at T=10: same cars as freeway5? \nFirst car: tail=-11+12*(10-4)= -11+72=61, head=0+72=72 -> [61,72] -> safe.\nSecond: tail=25+72=97, head=36+72=108 -> safe.\nThird: tail=-59+72=13, head=-48+72=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\nT=10: U -> y=7 at T=11.\nFreeway7: same, at T=11: \nFirst: tail=-11+12*7=-11+84=73, head=84 -> safe.\nThird: tail=-59+84=25, head=-48+84=36 -> safe.\n\nT=11: U -> y=8 at T=12.\nFreeway8: at T=12: \ncar: (-48,-95,right,48): tail=-95+48*(12-4)= -95+384=289, head=-48+384=336 -> safe.\n\nT=12: U -> y=9 at T=13. Goal.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nNow, what about the other sequence (with stay at T=5)? \n\nT=4: D -> T=5: y=2 (safe)\nT=5: S -> T=6: y=2 (freeway2 at T=6: \n   cars: first car: tail=-35+6*(6-4)= -35+12=-23, head=-24+12=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n   second: tail=13+12=25, head=24+12=36 -> safe.\nT=6: U -> T=7: y=3 (freeway3 at T=7: tail=-95+48*3=-95+144=49, head=-48+144=96 -> safe)\nT=7: U -> T=8: y=4 (freeway4 at T=8: safe as above)\nThen same as before.\n\nSo both are safe and same length.\n\nWe can choose the first one.\n\nBut note: in the first sequence, we did U at T=5 and T=6, so we got to row4 earlier. Then we had to wait (S) at T=7 to avoid being at row5 at T=8.\n\nIn the second sequence, we stayed at row2 at T=5, then moved up at T=6 and T=7 to row4 at T=8.\n\nEither is acceptable.\n\nI'll choose the first one.\n\nSo the answer:\n\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n\nBut wait, the actions are for turns starting at t1=4. And the sequence has 9 actions: turns 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.\n\nAnd at the last action (Turn12: U), we go from y=8 to y=9.\n\nSo we reach at T=13: y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: the minimal number of turns H. H is the number of actions? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1? So H=9.\n\nThe answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering: the current turn is t1=4, and we are to give actions for turns starting at t1 (4) to t1+H-1 (4+9-1=12).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous row at a dangerous turn.\n\n- At turn 4, moving down (D) avoids collision on row 3 or 4 at turn 5 (row 3 and 4 are dangerous at turn 5).\n- At turn 5, moving up (U) reaches row 3 at turn 6, which is safe (row 3 is only dangerous at turn 5).\n- At turn 6, moving up (U) reaches row 4 at turn 7, which is safe (row 4 is only dangerous at turn 5).\n- At turn 7, staying (S) remains on row 4 at turn 8, avoiding row 5 (dangerous at turn 8) and keeping row 4 safe (not dangerous at turn 8).\n- From turn 8 to turn 12, moving up (U) each turn progresses safely: row 5 at turn 9 (safe, dangerous only at turn 4 and 8), row 6 at turn 10 (safe, dangerous only at turn 4 and 8), row 7 at turn 11 (safe, dangerous only at turn 4 and 8), and row 8 at turn 12 (safe, dangerous only at turn 5). The final action at turn 12 moves to row 9.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 13 (after 9 actions) without any collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 5, and the player is at (0,2). We want to reach (0,9) as quickly as possible without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\n Important note: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the same as the row) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Also note that when moving, we are only on the freeway of the current turn until the next turn.\n\n The car update:\n   For a car at turn t1 (current) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n   - If left-moving: at time T (>=t1), the car spans [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n   - If right-moving: the car spans [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n But note: the representation in the table for right-moving is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n For right-moving: the head is the rightmost end? Actually, the table says for a right-moving car: \n   \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that the head is the larger coordinate? \n   Then at time T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n However, note the example in the table for freeway 3: (0, -47, right, 48) at t1=5.\n   At T=5: the car spans [ -47 + 48*(0) , 0 + 48*(0) ]? Actually, T-t1=0 -> [tau, h] = [-47, 0]?\n   But wait, the table says: (head, tail) = (0, -47) and direction right -> so the head is at 0 and tail at -47? \n   Then the span is from -47 to 0? \n\n   Then at time T (>=5): \n        head = 0 + 48*(T-5)\n        tail = -47 + 48*(T-5)\n\n   So the span is [ -47 + 48*(T-5), 0 + 48*(T-5) ]\n\n Now, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k (where k is the row, from 1 to 8) and at that turn, 0 is in the car's span on that freeway? \n   Actually, the condition: \"if 0 in Span(T)\" for any car on freeway y_T (which is the row the player is on at turn T).\n\n However, note: the freeways are rows 1 to 8. The player starts at row 2 at turn 5. The goal is row 9 (which is above row 8, so row 9 is not a freeway? Actually the grid has vertical axis y=0,1,...,9. The freeways are only for y=1,...,8. So when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars. \n\n Therefore, we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\n Our current position: (0,2) at turn 5. We want to get to (0,9). We can only move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). And we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\n The challenge: avoid the cars on freeways 1 to 8 when we are on those rows.\n\n We must plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to move from row 2 to row 9 in minimal turns.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that we start at row 2 at turn 5. We are not on a freeway that has cars? Actually row 2 is freeway 2? \n    But freeway 2 has two cars: \n        (-18, -29, right, 6) and (30, 19, right, 6)\n\n    At turn 5, for the first car: \n        head = -18? tail = -29? and right-moving -> so the span is [tau, head] = [-29, -18]? \n        But wait: the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, the head is the front? which is the larger coordinate? \n        However, note: the car is moving right, so if head is -18 and tail is -29, then the head is to the right of the tail? \n        But -18 > -29, so the head is at -18 and tail at -29? Then the car spans from -29 to -18? \n\n    At turn 5, the car spans [-29, -18]? Then 0 is not in that span? Similarly, the other car: (30,19, right,6) -> head=30, tail=19? \n        Then the car spans [19,30]? 0 is not in [19,30]. \n\n    So at turn 5, on freeway 2, no car has a span that includes 0. Therefore, we are safe at turn 5.\n\n 2. We need to simulate the movement of the cars for future turns. We are going to plan for each turn starting at turn 5.\n\n 3. We are going to do a BFS (breadth-first search) in the state space: (turn, y) \n    but note: the turn index is increasing, and we are starting at turn 5 at y=2.\n\n    We want the minimal H such that we can be at y=9 at turn (5+H-1). Actually, the sequence of actions will be from turn 5 to turn 5+H-1 (H actions). \n    Then the position at the last action (turn 5+H-1) will be y=9.\n\n 4. We must check at every turn T (starting at T=5, then T=6, ...) when we are at a freeway row (1..8) that there is no car on that freeway at turn T that has 0 in its span.\n\n 5. How to check for a car on freeway k at turn T?\n    For each car on freeway k (which is row k), we compute its span at turn T.\n\n    Note: the current state of cars is given at turn t1=5.\n\n    For a car: (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 5, then at turn T (>=5):\n        if direction is 'right':\n            head_T = head + speed * (T - 5)\n            tail_T = tail + speed * (T - 5)\n            span = [tail_T, head_T]   (since tail_T <= head_T because the car is moving right and at turn 5 we have tail <= head? Actually, in the data: for the car (-18, -29, right, 6): tail=-29, head=-18 -> so tail<=head? but note: -29<-18 -> so tail is less than head. So the span is [tail_T, head_T] and we require 0 to be in [tail_T, head_T] for collision.\n\n        if direction is 'left':\n            head_T = head - speed * (T - 5)\n            tail_T = tail - speed * (T - 5)\n            span = [head_T, tail_T]? \n            But note: the update rule for left-moving: \n                Span(T) = [h - s*(T-5), tau - s*(T-5)] \n                and since the car is left-moving, the head is the leftmost? Actually the rule says: \n                    at turn 5: Span(5)=[h, tau] -> but note the representation: for left-moving, the head is the left end? \n                However, in the given data, there are no left-moving cars? All are right? \n\n    Looking at the table: all cars are right-moving. So we only need to handle right.\n\n 6. For each freeway k (1..8) we have a list of cars. We need to check for each car on the freeway k at turn T: \n        if tail_T <= 0 <= head_T -> collision.\n\n 7. But note: multiple cars per freeway. We must check all.\n\n 8. We are going to simulate the moves:\n\n    State: (t, y) at turn t, we are at y.\n\n    We start: (5,2)\n\n    Actions: U -> y' = y+1 (if y<9)\n             D -> y' = y-1 (if y>0)\n             S -> y' = y\n\n    Then next state: (t+1, y')\n\n    We must check at the state (t, y) for collision? \n        Actually, the condition: at turn t, if the player is on a freeway (y in [1,8]), then we check all cars on freeway k=y at turn t.\n\n    But note: the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\n    So when we are at (t, y), then we are on freeway y at turn t. We must check the cars on freeway y at turn t.\n\n    However, note the exception: when we move, at turn T we are on freeway y_T. Then we take an action to go to y_{T+1}. \n        At turn T, we are on y_T and then we leave to y_{T+1} at the next turn. \n        So at turn T, we are only concerned with the freeway we are currently on: y_T.\n\n 9. Therefore, in our BFS, when we are at state (t, y), we must check:\n        if y is in [1,8]:\n            for each car on freeway k=y at turn t:\n                compute the car's span at turn t: \n                    head_t = head_initial + s*(t-5)   [for right-moving]\n                    tail_t = tail_initial + s*(t-5)\n                if tail_t <= 0 <= head_t -> collision -> invalid state.\n        if y is 0 or 9 -> safe.\n\n 10. We want to get to (t, 9) for any t. The first time we get to 9, we stop.\n\n 11. Let's note the cars per freeway:\n\n      Freeway 1: same as freeway 2? Actually:\n        Freeway 1: [ (-18, -29, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6) ]   -> note: the second car: (30,19) -> head=30, tail=19 -> but 19<30, so that's fine.\n\n        But wait: the representation says (head, tail) for right-moving? Then the car spans [19,30] at turn 5? \n        And the first car: head=-18, tail=-29 -> spans [-29, -18] at turn 5.\n\n        Freeway 2: same two cars.\n\n      Freeway 3: one car: (0, -47, right, 48) -> at turn 5: spans [-47, 0]? \n          So at turn 5: 0 is in the span? -> so at turn 5, freeway 3 is occupied at 0? \n          Therefore, if the player is at freeway 3 at turn 5, he would collide.\n\n      Similarly, freeway 4: same car? -> also (0,-47,right,48) -> so freeway 4 at turn 5: also 0 in the span? \n\n      Freeway 5: three cars: \n          (12,1,right,12) -> at turn5: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]\n          (48,37,right,12) -> [37,48] -> 0 not in\n          (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47,-36] -> 0 not in\n\n      Freeway 6: same as freeway5.\n\n      Freeway7: same as freeway5.\n\n      Freeway8: (0,-47,right,48) -> same as freeway3 and 4: so at turn5, freeway8: 0 is in the span? \n\n      Therefore, at turn5, we are at freeway2 -> safe. But if we were at freeway3,4,8 at turn5, we would be in collision.\n\n 12. Now, let's simulate:\n\n      We start at (5,2) -> safe.\n\n      Then we consider actions: U, D, S.\n\n      We want to minimize H, so we prefer moving up.\n\n      However, we must avoid collisions in future turns.\n\n 13. We do BFS:\n\n      Let's define a queue: (turn, y, path_actions) \n      We start: (5, 2, [])  -> but note the first action is for turn5.\n\n      We want to record the state (turn, y) to avoid duplicates? But note: we can have the same y at a later turn and that might be necessary? \n          However, since we are moving upward and we can also move down, we might loop. But we are minimizing H (number of turns), so we want the first time we reach 9.\n\n      We'll use BFS level by level (by turn).\n\n      Alternatively, we can use Dijkstra but the cost is the number of turns. And each action leads to turn+1.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Let dist[t][y] = minimal number of steps taken to reach (t,y) from (5,2) [but we start at turn5, so t0=5]\n\n        We start at (5,2) with 0 steps? But we are about to take the first action at turn5.\n\n        Actually, we are going to simulate from turn5 to turn5+H-1, so H actions.\n\n        We are at (5,2) without having taken any action. Then we take an action at turn5, which leads to turn6 and a new y.\n\n        However, note: the collision check at the starting state: at turn5, we are at (5,2) and we are safe.\n\n        But the action we take at turn5 will determine the next state at turn6? \n\n        Actually, the state at turn5: we are at y2. Then we choose an action a5, which moves us to y6 = y5 + Delta, and then at turn6 we are at y6.\n\n        And we must check the state at turn5: when we are at y2, we are safe. Then we move to y6 at turn6? \n\n        However, note: during turn5, we are at y2 and we are safe. Then we take an action. The next turn we are at turn6 at position y6.\n\n        So the collision check at the state (turn, y) is done at the beginning of the turn? \n\n        The problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". \n\n        So at turn5: we are at freeway2 -> we check freeway2 at turn5 -> safe.\n\n        Then we take an action at turn5: say we go up -> then at turn6 we are at y3.\n\n        Then at turn6: we are at freeway3 -> we must check freeway3 at turn6.\n\n        How about if we stay at turn5? Then at turn6 we are still at y2? \n\n        Actually, the update: \n          turn5: position (0,2)\n          action a5: S -> then y6 = 2? so at turn6 we are at (0,2) again? \n\n          But then at turn6: we are at freeway2 -> we check freeway2 at turn6.\n\n        So the state (turn, y) must be checked at that turn.\n\n 14. Plan:\n\n      We'll do a BFS starting from (5,2). We mark visited states by (turn, y) to avoid cycles? But note: if we go down and then up, we might loop. We want minimal H, so we avoid states that we have reached at an earlier turn? Actually, if we reach the same y at a later turn, it might be necessary if we are avoiding cars? But we want minimal turns, so if we have a state (t, y) and we have a way to get to (t, y) in fewer steps, we wouldn't. However, we are doing BFS by number of steps (which is turn-5). So we can break when we find the goal.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        Let queue = deque([ (5, 2, []) ])   # (turn, y, actions_so_far)\n        visited = set() of (turn, y) to avoid duplicates? But note: we can have the same y at different turns and we might need to revisit if we found a shorter path? Actually, the state is (turn, y). We want to avoid visiting the same (turn, y) twice. But also note: the car positions change with time, so the same (y) at a later turn might be safe when earlier it wasn't? But we are moving forward in time. \n\n        Actually, we are only moving forward. So we can only go to turn+1. Therefore, we will never have the same state (turn, y) twice? Because turn increases. So we don't need visited? \n\n        But note: we might have multiple ways to reach (t,y) and we want the minimal steps? However, we are doing BFS so the first time we get to y=9 we have the minimal steps.\n\n        Algorithm:\n\n          while queue:\n             pop state: (t, y, path)\n             if y == 9: we output the path (which is the sequence of actions) and H = len(path)\n\n             Otherwise, we consider the next actions: U, D, S -> leading to y_next in {y+1, y-1, y} (if within [0,9])\n\n             Then the next state: (t+1, y_next)\n\n             Check if (t+1, y_next) is safe? \n                 if y_next is 0 or 9 -> safe.\n                 if y_next in [1,8]:\n                     for each car on freeway k=y_next at time t+1:\n                         car: (head_initial, tail_initial, d, s) -> since all d='right'\n                         head_t1 = head_initial + s * ( (t+1) - 5 )\n                         tail_t1 = tail_initial + s * ( (t+1) - 5 )\n                         if tail_t1 <= 0 <= head_t1 -> collision -> skip\n\n             If safe, then we push (t+1, y_next, path + [action])\n\n          We start at (5,2,[]) and then we consider actions at turn5.\n\n        We break when we first reach y=9.\n\n 15. However, note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at the last turn. And we are at (t,9) at turn t. Then we stop. We don't require to be at 9 for multiple turns.\n\n 16. Let's try to run BFS for a few steps.\n\n      We start: (5,2,[])\n\n      Actions at turn5: \n        U: y_next = 3 -> then state (6,3)\n        D: y_next = 1 -> state (6,1)\n        S: y_next = 2 -> state (6,2)\n\n      Now check state (6,3):\n          freeway3: one car: (0, -47, right, 48) at turn5.\n          at turn6: t=6 -> t-5=1\n          head = 0 + 48*1 = 48\n          tail = -47 + 48*1 = 1\n          span = [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\n      Check state (6,1):\n          freeway1: two cars at turn6 (t-5=1):\n             car1: (-18, -29, right, 6) -> head = -18+6= -12, tail=-29+6=-23 -> span [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n             car2: (30,19,right,6) -> head=30+6=36, tail=19+6=25 -> span [25,36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n      Check state (6,2):\n          freeway2: same as freeway1? \n             cars: same as freeway1: (-18,-29,right,6) and (30,19,right,6) -> same calculations: safe.\n\n      Then we push:\n          (6,3, ['U'])\n          (6,1, ['D'])\n          (6,2, ['S'])\n\n      Then from (6,3): \n          Actions: U->4, D->2, S->3\n\n        Check (7,4):\n            freeway4: one car: (0,-47,right,48) -> at turn7: t-5=2 -> head=0+48*2=96, tail=-47+48*2=49 -> span [49,96] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        Check (7,2): \n            freeway2: at turn7: t-5=2\n                car1: (-18+12=-6, -29+12=-17) -> [-17,-6] -> safe.\n                car2: (30+12=42, 19+12=31) -> [31,42] -> safe.\n\n        Check (7,3): \n            freeway3: at turn7: head=0+48*2=96, tail=-47+48*2=49 -> [49,96] -> safe.\n\n      Then we push all.\n\n      From (6,1): \n          Actions: U->2, D->0, S->1\n          (7,2): we already have? But we are at the same state (7,2) from two different paths -> we can push it again? But we are BFS and we break by the first time we hit 9? So we don't mind duplicates? But the same state at the same turn and same y is the same. But we are going by increasing turn, so we can have multiple ways to the same (t,y). However, we are interested in minimal turns. So we can break when we first get to 9. So we don't need to avoid duplicates? \n\n      However, the branching factor is 3, and the minimal steps to go from 2 to 9 is 7 (if we go up every time: 2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 7 actions). But we might have to wait sometimes? \n\n      But note: we must avoid freeway3,4,8 at turn5? Actually, we don't need to avoid them at all turns? We saw that at turn6, freeway3 was safe. \n\n      How about freeway8? \n          freeway8: car (0,-47,right,48) -> at turn5: [ -47, 0] -> so 0 is included -> unsafe at turn5.\n          at turn6: [1,48] -> safe.\n          at turn7: [49,96] -> safe.\n\n      Similarly, freeway4: same as freeway3 and 8: safe at turn6 and beyond.\n\n      How about freeway5,6,7? \n          We have freeway5: at turn5: safe. \n          at turn6: for a car on freeway5: \n              car1: (12,1,right,12) -> at turn6: head=12+12=24, tail=1+12=13 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n              car2: (48+12=60, 37+12=49) -> [49,60] -> safe.\n              car3: (-36+12=-24, -47+12=-35) -> [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\n          Similarly for freeway6 and 7.\n\n      So it seems that after turn5, all freeways are safe? \n\n      Then the minimal path: we can just go up continuously: 7 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U,U -> then we go from 2 to 9 in 7 moves.\n\n      Let's check:\n\n          Turn5: at y2 -> safe (as we saw)\n          Turn5 action: U -> then at turn6: y3 -> safe (as above: freeway3 at turn6: [1,48] -> safe)\n          Turn6 action: U -> turn7: y4 -> freeway4 at turn7: [49,96] -> safe.\n          Turn7: U -> turn8: y5 -> freeway5: at turn8 (t=8, t-5=3): \n                car1: 12+12*3=12+36=48, 1+36=37 -> [37,48] -> safe.\n                car2: 48+36=84, 37+36=73 -> [73,84] -> safe.\n                car3: -36+36=0, -47+36=-11 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0]? \n                    tail=-11, head=0 -> so 0 is included -> collision.\n\n          Oh! So at turn8 (which is 3 steps after turn5) at freeway5, the third car: (-36,-47,right,12) \n                at turn8: head = -36 + 12*(8-5) = -36 + 36 = 0\n                         tail = -47 + 36 = -11\n                span = [-11,0] -> 0 is in the interval -> collision.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot be at freeway5 at turn8.\n\n      So we must avoid freeway5 at turn8? \n\n      How about if we wait one turn? Then at turn9 at freeway5:\n\n          car3: head = -36 + 12*(9-5) = -36 + 48 = 12\n                 tail = -47 + 48 = 1\n          span = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n      But then we are delayed.\n\n      Alternatively, we might take a different route.\n\n      We must avoid freeway5 at turn8. \n\n      How about at turn8 we are not at freeway5? \n\n      Our plan: we start at y2 at turn5.\n\n      Option 1: \n          turn5: U -> y3 at turn6\n          turn6: U -> y4 at turn7\n          turn7: we cannot go to y5 at turn8 because that would be unsafe? \n          So at turn7: we can either stay at y4, go down to y3, or go up to y5? \n          But if we go up to y5 at turn7, then at turn7 we are at freeway5? \n\n          Check freeway5 at turn7 (t=7, t-5=2):\n             car3: head = -36 + 12*2 = -36+24 = -12, tail = -47+24=-23 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n          Then at turn7: we are at y5 (safe). Then at turn8: we can go up to y6? \n          Then at turn8: freeway6? \n             freeway6: same cars as freeway5? \n                 car3: at turn8: head = -36+12*3=0, tail=-47+36=-11 -> [-11,0] -> unsafe at freeway6? \n                 But wait: at turn8 we are at freeway6, so we check the cars on freeway6? \n                 The car on freeway6: the same as freeway5? \n                 But note: the table: freeway5 and freeway6 have the same set of cars? \n                 So freeway6 at turn8: car3: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n          Alternatively, at turn7 (at y5) we can stay?

Then the position at turn t1+H-1 is not the final? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". \n\n          And the update: after the action at turn t, we get the position at turn t+1.\n\n          Therefore, after the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at position (0,y) at turn t1+H. We require that y=9.\n\n          So the goal is at turn t1+H = 5+H.\n\n          But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" -> but note: H is the number of actions? \n\n          And the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1 -> so H actions.\n\n          Then the turn when we arrive at the goal is 5+H.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn (t1+H-1)\"? \n\n          Let me check: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence is for t=0 to H-1? \n\n          But the problem: \"minimal number of turns H\" -> it might be ambiguous.\n\n          The problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          And then the answer format: \n                Turn t1: a_{t1}\n                Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n                ...\n\n          So H is the number of actions, and the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          And after that last action, we are at turn t1+H, and we require that at turn t1+H we are at (0,9)? \n\n          But note: the collision condition: we only care about the turns when we are on the grid? \n\n          Actually, during the actions, we are at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and at each of these turns we are at a position (0,y_t) and we check collision at that turn? \n\n          But the goal: we require that at the turn after the last action, we are at (0,9). \n\n          However, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and the sequence of actions leads to that.\n\n          Let me re-read the game dynamics: \n            Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, ... \n            And we start at (0,y_{t1}) at turn t1.\n\n          So at the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0,y_{t1}). Then we take an action a_{t1} -> then we move to y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta.\n\n          Then at the next turn (t1+1), we are at (0,y_{t1+1}).\n\n          And we want to be at (0,9) at some turn. \n\n          The problem: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? \n\n          But note: the goal condition is not explicitly stated. However, the minimal H is defined as the number of actions.\n\n          We must output the sequence of actions until we get to y=9. \n\n          How do we know we are done? When we have taken an action that makes the next position y=9.\n\n          Therefore, in our BFS, we check: after the action, the next state (t+1, y_next) and if y_next==9, then we stop.\n\n          And the action we just took is the last one.\n\n          So the goal state in BFS: we are at (t+1,9) and we stop. But note: we don't actually simulate the state (t+1,9) beyond knowing we are done? \n\n          However, we must not collide at the goal state? But at y=9, there are no cars. So safe.\n\n          Therefore, we can stop when we take an action that leads to y_next=9.\n\n          In our BFS, we expand a state (t, y) and then we consider an action that leads to (t+1, y_next). \n          If y_next==9, then we output the path.\n\n          Now, in the plan where we did 8 actions, the last action (at turn12) leads to y9 at turn13 -> that's safe.\n\n          But is there a plan with 7 actions? \n\n          We require: after 7 actions, we are at y9 at turn12.\n\n          How? \n            Start: turn5: y2\n            After 7 actions: turn5+7 = turn12: we are at y9? \n\n            The path: we must go up 7 times: 2+7=9 -> so the sequence: U,U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\n            But then we must avoid collisions at turns 5,6,7,8,9,10,11? \n\n            At turn5: y2 -> safe.\n            At turn6: y3 -> safe (freeway3: [1,48] at turn6? \n                      car: head=0+48*(6-5)=48, tail=-47+48=1 -> [1,48] -> safe)\n            At turn7: y4 -> freeway4: same car: head=0+48*2=96, tail=-47+96=49 -> [49,96] -> safe.\n            At turn8: y5 -> freeway5: car3: head=-36+12*3=0, tail=-47+36=-11 -> [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot.\n\n      So minimal H is 8.\n\n      Now, we have several plans with 8 actions. We need to output one.\n\n      We can choose the one that goes up continuously but waits one turn at the beginning:\n\n          turn5: S (stay at y2)\n          turn6: U -> y3\n          turn7: U -> y4\n          turn8: U -> y5 -> but wait, at turn8: we are at y5 -> freeway5: unsafe? \n          We must avoid freeway5 at turn8.\n\n      Correction: in the plan we described above, we did:\n\n          turn5: S -> then at turn6: y2 (but we were at y2 and we stay -> y2 at turn6)\n          turn6: U -> turn7: y3\n          turn7: U -> turn8: y4\n          turn8: U -> turn9: y5 -> but then we are at freeway5 at turn9? \n\n          Actually, we are at freeway5 at turn9: because at turn9 we are at y5? \n\n          And we said freeway5 at turn9 is safe.\n\n          Then:\n            turn9: U -> turn10: y6\n            turn10: U -> turn11: y7\n            turn11: U -> turn12: y8\n            turn12: U -> turn13: y9 -> then we stop.\n\n          The actions: \n            turn5: S\n            turn6: U\n            turn7: U\n            turn8: U -> at turn9: y5 (safe)\n            turn9: U\n            turn10: U\n            turn11: U\n            turn12: U -> at turn13: y9\n\n          That's 8 actions.\n\n      But note: at turn8: we are at y4 -> freeway4 at turn8: \n          car: (0,-47,right,48) -> at turn8: t-5=3 -> head=0+48*3=144, tail=-47+144=97 -> safe.\n\n      Then at turn9: we are at y5: \n          freeway5: car3: head=-36+12*(9-5)= -36+48=12, tail=-47+48=1 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\n      So it's safe.\n\n      Another plan: \n          turn5: U -> y3 at turn6\n          turn6: S -> y3 at turn7\n          turn7: U -> y4 at turn8\n          turn8: U -> y5 at turn9\n          turn9: U -> y6 at turn10\n          turn10: U -> y7 at turn11\n          turn11: U -> y8 at turn12\n          turn12: U -> y9 at turn13\n\n      Also 8 actions.\n\n      We can choose either.\n\n      Let's output the first one: \n\n          Turn5: S\n          Turn6: U\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: U\n          Turn11: U\n          Turn12: U\n\n      But note: we start at y2 at turn5. Then we do S at turn5: at turn6 we are still at y2? \n          Then at turn6: we do U: then at turn7 we are at y3.\n\n      That's correct.\n\n      However, we must check at turn6: we are at y2 -> freeway2: \n          cars: (-18,-29,right,6) and (30,19,right,6) at turn5.\n          at turn6: t-5=1: \n              car1: head=-18+6=-12, tail=-29+6=-23 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n              car2: head=30+6=36, tail=19+6=25 -> [25,36] -> safe.\n\n      Then at turn7: we are at y3 -> freeway3: \n          car: head=0+48*(7-5)=96, tail=-47+48*2=49 -> [49,96] -> safe.\n\n      Then at turn8: y4 -> freeway4: same as freeway3: [49+48? -> actually, at turn8: t-5=3: \n          head=0+48*3=144, tail=-47+144=97 -> [97,144] -> safe.\n\n      Then at turn9: y5 -> freeway5: \n          car3: head=-36+12*4=12, tail=-47+48=1 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\n      Then at turn10: y6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5? \n          car3: head=-36+12*5=24, tail=-47+60=13 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\n      Then at turn11: y7 -> freeway7: car3: head=-36+72=36, tail=-47+72=25 -> [25,36] -> safe.\n\n      Then at turn12: y8 -> freeway8: \n          car: head=0+48*(12-5)=336, tail=-47+336=289 -> safe.\n\n      Then at turn13: y9 -> goal.\n\n      Therefore, the sequence:\n\n          Turn5: S\n          Turn6: U\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: U\n          Turn11: U\n          Turn12: U\n\n      H=8.\n\n      But note: we can also do without the initial stay? \n          We could do:\n\n          turn5: U -> turn6: y3\n          turn6: S -> turn7: y3\n          turn7: U -> turn8: y4\n          turn8: U -> turn9: y5\n          turn9: U -> turn10: y6\n          turn10: U -> turn11: y7\n          turn11: U -> turn12: y8\n          turn12: U -> turn13: y9\n\n      That is also 8 and safe.\n\n      We can choose either. Let's choose the one that moves immediately:\n\n          Turn5: U\n          Turn6: S\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: U\n          Turn11: U\n          Turn12: U\n\n      But we must check turn6: we are at y3? \n          turn5: U -> turn6: y3 -> freeway3: \n              car: head=0+48*(6-5)=48, tail=-47+48=1 -> [1,48] -> safe.\n\n      turn6: S -> turn7: y3 -> freeway3 at turn7: \n              head=0+48*2=96, tail=-47+96=49 -> [49,96] -> safe.\n\n      turn7: U -> turn8: y4 -> freeway4: head=0+48*3=144, tail=-47+144=97 -> safe.\n\n      Then same as above.\n\n      This is valid.\n\n      We'll output:\n\n          Turn5: U\n          Turn6: S\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: U\n          Turn11: U\n          Turn12: U\n\n      But note: the problem says the current turn is t1=5, and we start at (0,2). \n\n      This sequence: 8 actions.\n\n      Alternatively, we could do the first plan (with the initial stay) and that is also valid.\n\n      Since the problem does not require the absolute minimal H? We have found 8 is minimal.\n\n      We can choose any plan with 8 actions that works.\n\n      However, note: we might find a plan that uses 8 actions but with a different path? \n\n      But both are 8.\n\n      We'll choose the one that moves up immediately at turn5.\n\n      But note: at turn5 we are at y2, and if we go up to y3 at turn6, that is safe.\n\n      Then we wait at turn6 at y3? \n\n      Why not? \n\n      So:\n\n        Turn5: U\n        Turn6: S\n        Turn7: U\n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: U\n        Turn12: U\n\n      This is the answer.\n\n      Let me write it in the boxed format.\n\n      Note: the actions are for turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+7.\n\n      So:\n\n        Turn5: U\n        Turn6: S\n        Turn7: U\n        Turn8: U\n        Turn9: U\n        Turn10: U\n        Turn11: U\n        Turn12: U\n\n      But wait, the last action is at turn12? Then the next turn is turn13 and we are at y9.\n\n      This is 8 actions.\n\n      We can also consider a plan that doesn't wait at y3? \n\n        We tried to go up to y4 at turn7 and then skip freeway5 at turn8 by going to freeway4? but we have to go to freeway5 eventually? \n\n        How about:\n\n          turn5: U -> turn6: y3\n          turn6: U -> turn7: y4\n          turn7: U -> turn8: y5 -> unsafe.\n\n        So we must avoid y5 at turn8.\n\n        Another idea: go up to y5 at turn7? \n          We cannot: we are at y4 at turn7, then we need one more U to get to y5 at turn8.\n\n      Therefore, we choose the waiting plan.\n\n      Final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\n      But note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we write:\n\n          Turn5: U\n          Turn6: S\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: U\n          Turn11: U\n          Turn12: U\n\n      We'll output exactly that.\n\n      However, we must be cautious: the problem says \"current turn is t_1\", and in the answer we start at Turn t_1.\n\n      And we have 8 actions.\n\n      We'll run a quick simulation to be sure.\n\n      Simulation:\n\n        t=5: start at y=2 -> safe (freeway2: safe at t=5, as computed)\n        Action U: then at t=6: y=3 -> freeway3: at t=6: [1,48] -> safe.\n\n        t=6: at y=3, Action S: then at t=7: y=3 -> freeway3: at t=7: [49,96] -> safe.\n\n        t=7: at y=3, Action U: then at t=8: y=4 -> freeway4: at t=8: [97,144] -> safe.\n\n        t=8: at y=4, Action U: then at t=9: y=5 -> freeway5: car3 at t=9: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        t=9: at y=5, Action U: then at t=10: y=6 -> freeway6: car3 at t=10: [13,24] -> safe.\n\n        t=10: at y=6, Action U: then at t=11: y=7 -> freeway7: car3 at t=11: [25,36] -> safe.\n\n        t=11: at y=7, Action U: then at t=12: y=8 -> freeway8: at t=12: [0+48*(12-5)=336, -47+48*7=289] -> [289,336] -> safe.\n\n        t=12: at y=8, Action U: then at t=13: y=9 -> goal.\n\n      Safe at every step.\n\n      Therefore, we output the sequence.\n\n      Note: we are required to output for turns 5 to 12.\n\n      So:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\n      But wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=8? \n\n      And the sequence has 8 actions, from turn5 to turn12.\n\n      This is minimal.\n\n      We are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 5 is 8.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=6, and I'm at y=3. I can move up, down, or stay each turn, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are moving on each freeway, and I collide if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T where for some car, 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that when I move, I'm not on the new row until the next turn, so I only care about the row I'm currently on for collision.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=6. So at turn T, which is relative to t=6, let τ = T - 6, so τ=0 is now.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn H, so at turn 6+H, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from τ=0 to τ=H-1, I take actions, and after H actions, at τ=H, I should be at y=9.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am on row y_t, and I might collide if for that row, there is a car where 0 is in its span at turn t.\n\nThen after taking action, at turn t+1, I am on y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t_1 + H} = 9, I think, after H actions.\n\nLet's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nSequence from t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, at time t_1 + H, the position should be (0,9).\n\nBecause after action at t, position at t+1.\n\nAt time t, position is y_t.\n\nAction a_t at time t causes y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at time T, we need y_T = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions, leading to position at time t_1 + H.\n\nSo we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nWith H minimal.\n\nNow, t_1 = 6, so start at t=6, y=3.\n\nEnd at t=6+H, y=9.\n\nNow, for collision: at each time t, when I am at y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, I must not have a car on that row where 0 is in the car's span at time t.\n\nThe car spans are given at t=6, and we can compute for any future time.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nCars are on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nFor each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right or left. In the table, it says \"right\" or \"left\", but in the car update, it has left-moving and right-moving defined.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway k, it lists cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection is given as \"right\" or \"left\", I think.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: cars: (-12, -23, right, 6) and (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nBut head and tail: for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I think, but here (-12, -23), -12 > -23? -12 is greater than -23, so if direction is right, and head is -12, tail -23, that would be from -23 to -12, which is left to right? Let's see the update rule.\n\nThe update rule says:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIt says head h, tail τ, but in the notation, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] with h and τ, but in the span, it's from min to max? No.\n\nIn the description:\n\nFor car k on freeway i, at t1, head at h, tail at τ.\n\nThen for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] but [h, τ] might not be ordered, but from the context, in the update, it says [h, τ] → [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ], so it assumes that for left-moving, the car is moving left, so head is on the right, I think.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\".\n\nFor left-moving, as the car moves left, both h and τ decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nHere for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ and h, but in the update, it increases, so τ should be left end, h right end.\n\nIn the car state, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nBut the meaning of head and tail depends on direction.\n\nFor left-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left end? Let's see.\n\nIn left-moving update: span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases, so if it's [h, τ], and both decrease, but the interval changes, so for the span to make sense, [h, τ] should be from left to right or what?\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are misnomers, or we need to interpret based on direction.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the position of the car at time T.\n\nFor a car, at time t1, we have head position, tail position, direction, speed.\n\nThe span at time t1 is the set of x-coordinates occupied.\n\nFor left-moving car: the head is the front when moving left, so head has higher x if we think x increasing right, but the grid, x=0 is the position, and cars move left or right.\n\nThe player is at x=0 always, I think, since position is (0, y_t), so x is always 0 for player, and collisions happen when x=0 is in the car span at time t for the row y_t.\n\nSo for cars, we care about whether at time t, for a given row, the car spans x=0.\n\nNow, for a car, at time t1, with head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThe span at time t1 is an interval.\n\nFor left-moving (d = left), the car is moving left, so the head (front) is at h, tail (back) is at τ, and since moving left, if we assume x increases right, then for left-moving, h > τ, and span is from τ to h, I think.\n\nBut in the update rule, it says \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" for left-moving, but [h, τ] if h>τ, it's decreasing, but usually we write intervals min to max.\n\nIn the text: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then it moves to [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ], so the values decrease, so if [h, τ] means from h to τ with h>τ, it's backwards, but mathematically, the set is {x | min(h,τ) ≤ x ≤ max(h,τ)} or something.\n\nI think to simplify, since the collision depends on whether 0 is between the min and max of the span.\n\nFor any car, at time t1, the span is an interval [L(t1), R(t1)] where L and R are the left and right ends.\n\nThen at time T, for left-moving, L(T) = L(t1) - s(T-t1), R(T) = R(t1) - s(T-t1)\n\nFor right-moving, L(T) = L(t1) + s(T-t1), R(T) = R(t1) + s(T-t1)\n\nNow, from the head and tail, we need to find L and R at t1.\n\nIn the car state, (head, tail, direction, speed) are given.\n\nFor left-moving car, head is the right end? Let's see the examples.\n\nFor freeway 1, cars: (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving, in the update, \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and it says \"head at h, tail at τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, since it moves right.\n\nIn this case, for (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-12, -23, right, 6)\n\nHead h = -12, tail τ = -23.\n\nSince direction right, and span [τ, h] = [-23, -12], and at T, [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ] = [-23 +6Δ, -12 +6Δ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it should be span [h, τ] with h > τ, I think.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1, both cars are right-moving.\n\nLet's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars, both right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head -12, tail -23, dir right, speed 6. So span at t1=6: [tail, head] = [-23, -12] for right-moving? From the update, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 6), head 36, tail 25, dir right, so span [τ, h] = [25, 36]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, cars (-12,-23,right,6) and (36,25,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: (48,1,right,48), head 48, tail 1, dir right, speed 48. Span [τ,h] = [1,48]\n\nFreeway 4: (48,1,right,48), same as above.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFirst: head 24, tail 13, span [13,24]\n\nSecond: head 60, tail 49, span [49,60]\n\nThird: head -24, tail -35, span [-35,-24]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 8: (48,1,right,48), same as freeway 3 and 4.\n\nNow, for all these, direction is right, so we have the spans.\n\nBut for left-moving, it would be different, but here all are right-moving, I think. In the table, all say \"right\", no \"left\" mentioned, so all cars are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1 to 8, all cars have direction \"right\", so all are right-moving.\n\nSo for each car, at time t1=6, span [L, R] where L = tail, R = head, since tail < head for right-moving.\n\nIn the notation, for (head, tail), in freeway 1, first car head -12, tail -23, tail < head since -23 < -12.\n\nSimilarly, second car head 36, tail 25, 25<36.\n\nFreeway 3 head 48, tail 1, 1<48.\n\nFreeway 5, first car head 24, tail 13, 13<24, etc.\n\nAll have tail < head, so for right-moving, span at t1 is [tail, head] = [τ, h].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] for each car.\n\nNow, collision occurs at time T if for the row y_T, there is a car on that row such that 0 is in [L(T), R(T)] for that car.\n\nThat is, L(T) <= 0 <= R(T).\n\nNow, the player starts at t=6, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no freeways there, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so when on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nAlso, when moving, if I am at y_t at time t, I only care about cars on row y_t at time t.\n\nIf I move, at time t, I am on y_t, I take action, go to y_{t+1} at time t+1.\n\nAt time t, I am on row y_t, so if y_t between 1 and 8, I need to avoid cars on row y_t at time t.\n\nAt time t+1, on row y_{t+1}, avoid cars on that row at time t+1.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=3, I need to go up, since 9>3.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I can go up every turn, but I might hit cars.\n\ny=9 is safe, so once I reach y=9, I'm done.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at some time T, and I need to have no collision at times before.\n\nSince I start at y=3, and need to get to y=9, the shortest path is to go up 6 times, but I might be on rows with cars at bad times.\n\nI can stay or go down to avoid, but that would take more turns.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, for each time, whether there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThat is, for row k, at time T, is there a car on row k such that 0 in its span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars per row, but we care if any covers 0.\n\nFor each freeway k, we have a set of cars, each with its span at T.\n\nBut since we care about x=0 covered, we can find for each k, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., some car covers 0.\n\nThen, for the player, at time t, when on row y_t, it is safe only if y_t not in 1-8 or if in 1-8 but no car covers 0 at that time for that row.\n\nNow, let t1=6, so let τ = T - 6, time offset.\n\nFor each row k, find for which τ, row k is unsafe at time 6+τ.\n\nτ is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nτ >=0.\n\nNow, for a car on row k, with tail τ, head h, speed s at time t1=6.\n\nAt time T=6+τ, span is [τ + sτ, h + sτ] for right-moving, since s is speed, and τ here is time offset, not to confuse with tail.\n\nI used τ for tail, but now τ for time, bad.\n\nLet me use Δt for time offset from t=6.\n\nSo at time t = 6 + Δt, for Δt >=0.\n\nFor a car with tail L0, head R0 at t=6, speed s, right-moving.\n\nAt time 6+Δt, span [L0 + s Δt, R0 + s Δt]\n\n0 is covered if L0 + s Δt <= 0 <= R0 + s Δt\n\nThat is, -R0 / s <= Δt <= -L0 / s? Let's solve.\n\nL0 + s Δt <= 0 and 0 <= R0 + s Δt\n\nSo s Δt <= -L0 and s Δt >= -R0? From L0 + s Δt <= 0, so s Δt <= -L0\n\nFrom 0 <= R0 + s Δt, so s Δt >= -R0\n\nSince s >0, we have:\n\n- R0 <= s Δt <= -L0\n\nThen Δt must satisfy ceil( -R0 / s ) <= Δt <= floor( -L0 / s )? Let's see.\n\ns Δt >= -R0 and s Δt <= -L0\n\nSo Δt >= ceil( -R0 / s ) and Δt <= floor( -L0 / s )\n\nBut since Δt integer, we need the values where max( ceil(-R0/s), something) but let's compute for each car.\n\nSince we care about the inequality, we can find the range of Δt where the car covers 0.\n\nFor each car, the condition L0 + s Δt <= 0 <= R0 + s Δt must hold for some Δt.\n\n0 in [L0 + s Δt, R0 + s Δt]\n\nSo min(L0 + s Δt, R0 + s Δt) <= 0 <= max(L0 + s Δt, R0 + s Δt), but since L0 <= R0, it's L0 + s Δt <= 0 <= R0 + s Δt.\n\nSo we need:\n\nL0 + s Δt <= 0  and  0 <= R0 + s Δt\n\nFrom 0 <= R0 + s Δt, so Δt >= ceil( -R0 / s )\n\nFrom L0 + s Δt <= 0, so s Δt <= -L0, so Δt <= floor( -L0 / s )\n\nSince Δt integer.\n\nAnd only if ceil( -R0 / s ) <= floor( -L0 / s ), then for Δt from ceil( -R0 / s ) to floor( -L0 / s ) inclusive, the car covers 0.\n\nOtherwise, no coverage.\n\nNow, for each row, we have multiple cars, so row k is unsafe at Δt if any car on row k covers 0 at that Δt.\n\nThen, for player, at time 6+Δt, on row y, if y in 1-8 and row y is unsafe at Δt, then collision.\n\nElse, safe.\n\nNow, let's list for each row the cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: two cars\n\nCar A: L0 = -23, R0 = -12, s=6\n\nThen Δt for coverage:\n\nceil( -R0 / s ) = ceil( -(-12) / 6 ) = ceil(12/6) = ceil(2) =2\n\nfloor( -L0 / s ) = floor( -(-23)/6 ) = floor(23/6) = floor(3.833) =3\n\nSo for Δt from 2 to 3 inclusive, i.e., at Δt=2 and 3, car covers 0.\n\nCar B: L0=25, R0=36, s=6\n\nceil( -R0/s ) = ceil( -36/6 ) = ceil(-6) = -6\n\nfloor( -L0/s ) = floor( -25/6 ) = floor(-4.166) = -5? Let's compute.\n\n- R0 = -36\n\n- R0 / s = -36/6 = -6\n\nceil(-6) = -6\n\n- L0 = -25\n\n- L0 / s = -25/6 ≈ -4.166\n\nfloor(-4.166) = -5? Floor is greatest integer less than or equal, so floor(-4.166) = -5? No.\n\n-4.166, less than -4, greater than -5, so floor is -5? Floor of -4.166: integers less than or equal to -4.166 are -5, -6, ..., so greatest is -5? No.\n\nFloor of x is greatest integer <= x.\n\nx = -4.166, integers <= -4.166 are -5, -6, -7, ..., so greatest is -5? -5 = -5.0 < -4.166? -5.0 < -4.166 is true, but -4 is greater than -4.166? -4 = -4.0 > -4.166, so -4.0 is greater, but -4.0 > -4.166, so integers <= -4.166 are -5, -6, etc., and -5 = -5.0 < -4.166, yes, but -4 is not <= -4.166, since -4 > -4.166.\n\n-4.166, on number line, -5, -4.166, -4.\n\nIntegers less than or equal to -4.166: -5, -6, etc., and -5 < -4.166, but -4 is to the right, -4 > -4.166, so -4 is not <= -4.166.\n\nSo integers <= -4.166 are ... -6, -5, and -5 = -5.0 <= -4.166? -5.0 = -5, which is less than -4.166, so yes, -5 <= -4.166.\n\nIs there a larger integer? -4 is -4.0, which is greater than -4.166, so not <=. Next integer down is -5.\n\nBut -5 = -5.0, -4.166 is about -4.17, so -5.0 < -4.17, so -5 <= -4.17 is true, and it is the greatest such integer? No, -4 is greater but not <=.\n\n-5 is less than -4.17, and there is no integer between, so floor(-4.166) = -5.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(-4.166) = -4, since ceil is smallest integer >= x.\n\nBut for our inequality.\n\nBack to car B: L0=25, R0=36, s=6\n\n- R0 = -36\n\n- R0 / s = -36/6 = -6\n\nceil( -R0 / s ) = ceil(-6) = -6\n\n- L0 = -25\n\n- L0 / s = -25/6 ≈ -4.1667\n\nfloor( -L0 / s ) = floor(-4.1667) = -5\n\nNow, Δt must satisfy ceil(-R0/s) <= Δt <= floor(-L0/s), so -6 <= Δt <= -5\n\nBut Δt is time offset, Δt >=0, since we start from t=6, future times.\n\n-6 <= Δt <= -5, but Δt >=0, so no overlap, so for Δt >=0, this car never covers 0, since L0=25 >0, and moving right, so always to the right, never reaches 0.\n\nSimilarly, for car A, we had Δt from 2 to 3.\n\nFor freeway 1, car A covers at Δt=2,3; car B never, so row 1 unsafe at Δt=2 and 3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, cars identical, so unsafe at Δt=2,3.\n\nNow freeway 3: one car, L0=1, R0=48, s=48\n\n- R0 = -48\n\n- R0/s = -48/48 = -1\n\nceil(-1) = -1\n\n- L0 = -1\n\n- L0/s = -1/48 ≈ -0.02083\n\nfloor(-0.02083) = -1? Floor of -0.02083: integers <= -0.02083 are -1, -2, ..., greatest is -1? -1 = -1.0 < -0.02083? -1.0 < -0.02083 yes, but -0 is greater, -0 =0 > -0.02083, not <=.\n\nSo floor(-0.02083) = -1\n\nThen Δt from ceil(-R0/s) = ceil(-1) = -1 to floor(-L0/s) = floor(-0.02083) = -1\n\nSo Δt = -1, which is past, not future. So for Δt >=0, no coverage. Since L0=1>0, moving right, so at Δt=0, span [1,48] >0, and increasing, so 0 not covered for Δt>=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same, safe for all Δt>=0.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: L0=13, R0=24, s=12\n\n- R0 = -24\n\n- R0/s = -24/12 = -2\n\nceil(-2) = -2\n\n- L0 = -13\n\n- L0/s = -13/12 ≈ -1.0833\n\nfloor(-1.0833) = -2? Floor of -1.0833: integers <= -1.0833 are -2, -3, ..., greatest is -2? -2 = -2.0 < -1.0833, yes; -1 > -1.0833, not <=. So floor = -2\n\nThen Δt from ceil(-R0/s) = -2 to floor(-L0/s) = -2, so Δt=-2, not future.\n\nSimilarly, second car: L0=49, R0=60, s=12\n\n- R0 = -60\n\n- R0/s = -60/12 = -5\n\nceil(-5) = -5\n\n- L0 = -49\n\n- L0/s = -49/12 ≈ -4.0833\n\nfloor(-4.0833) = -5? Floor of -4.0833: <= -4.0833 are -5,-6,...; -5 < -4.0833? -5.0 < -4.0833 yes, -4 > not <=, so floor = -5\n\nThen Δt from -5 to -5, not future.\n\nThird car: L0=-35, R0=-24, s=12\n\n- R0 = -(-24) =24? -R0 = -(-24) =24\n\nR0 = -24, so -R0 = -(-24) =24\n\ns=12\n\n- R0 / s = 24/12 =2\n\nceil(2) =2\n\n- L0 = -(-35) =35\n\n- L0 / s =35/12≈2.9167\n\nfloor(2.9167)=2\n\nThen Δt from ceil(2) =2 to floor(2.9167)=2, so Δt=2.\n\nSo at Δt=2, this car covers 0.\n\nNow, for freeway 5, car 1 and 2 never cover 0 for Δt>=0, car 3 covers at Δt=2.\n\nSo row 5 unsafe at Δt=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5, so unsafe at Δt=2.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5, unsafe at Δt=2.\n\nFreeway 8: car (48,1,right,48), same as freeway 3, L0=1,R0=48,s=48, as before, no coverage for Δt>=0, safe.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, unsafe at which Δt:\n\nRow 1: unsafe at Δt=2,3\n\nRow 2: unsafe at Δt=2,3\n\nRow 3: safe for all Δt (since no car covers 0)\n\nRow 4: safe for all Δt\n\nRow 5: unsafe at Δt=2\n\nRow 6: unsafe at Δt=2\n\nRow 7: unsafe at Δt=2\n\nRow 8: safe for all Δt\n\nAlso, row 3,4,8 always safe.\n\nNow, player starts at t=6, Δt=0, y=3.\n\nAt Δt=0, y=3, which is row 3, and row 3 is safe, as we said.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some future time.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal H: since from y=3 to y=9, need to increase by 6, so if I go up every turn, I can reach in 6 actions: from t=6 to t=12, y from 3 to 9.\n\nAt t=6: y=3\n\na_t=U, then t=7, y=4\n\na_t=U, t=8, y=5\n\na_t=U, t=9, y=6\n\na_t=U, t=10, y=7\n\na_t=U, t=11, y=8\n\na_t=U, t=12, y=9\n\nNow, check for collision at each time.\n\nAt each time t, we are at y_t, and check if that row is unsafe at Δt = t-6.\n\nt=6, Δt=0, y=3, row 3 safe.\n\nt=7, Δt=1, y=4, row 4 safe.\n\nt=8, Δt=2, y=5, row 5 unsafe at Δt=2? Row 5 is unsafe at Δt=2, yes, as above.\n\nAt t=8, Δt=2, y=5, which is freeway 5, and unsafe at Δt=2, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I continue, at t=8, I would collide.\n\nSo going straight up, I hit at t=8 when on y=5.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I can delay or something.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 6.\n\nI could go up slower or down at some point.\n\nBut going down might take longer.\n\nSince row 5 is only unsafe at Δt=2, which is t=8.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 and 7 also unsafe at Δt=2, but row 5,6,7 all unsafe at exactly Δt=2.\n\nΔt=2 is t=8.\n\nNow, row 1 and 2 unsafe at Δt=2 and 3, t=8 and 9.\n\nBut I need to pass through the rows.\n\nAt t=8, if I am on row 5,6, or 7, I collide, since all unsafe at Δt=2.\n\nAlso, row 1 and 2 unsafe at Δt=2 and 3.\n\nBut I start from y=3 at t=6.\n\nI need to be not on rows 1,2,5,6,7 at t=8.\n\nAt other times, some rows are safe.\n\nFor example, at Δt=0, t=6, I am on y=3, safe.\n\nΔt=1, t=7, I could be on different rows.\n\nI need to plan the actions.\n\nSince the only dangerous times are around Δt=2 and 3 for rows 1,2, and Δt=2 for rows 5,6,7.\n\nSpecifically, for rows 5,6,7, only unsafe at Δt=2, i.e., t=8.\n\nFor rows 1 and 2, unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nOther rows and times are safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to go up directly but avoid being on rows 5,6,7 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, for rows 1,2, but since I am going up, I might not be on them.\n\nAt t=8, I need to not be on y=5,6,7.\n\ny=5,6,7 are rows 5,6,7.\n\nAt t=8, if I am on y=4 or y=8 or y=3, etc., but y=3,4,8 are safe at that time.\n\ny=3 always safe, y=4 always safe, y=8 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is the target.\n\nNow, at t=6, I am at y=3.\n\nI take actions.\n\nSuppose at t=6, I stay or move.\n\nIf I go up at t=6, to y=4 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I am at y=4.\n\nIf I go up again, to y=5 at t=8, but at t=8 on y=5, collision.\n\nIf at t=7, I stay, then at t=8 I am still on y=4, which is safe, since row 4 always safe.\n\nThen at t=8, on y=4, I can go up to y=5 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, Δt=3, now row 5: is it safe at Δt=3?\n\nFrom above, row 5 unsafe only at Δt=2, so at Δt=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 and 7 unsafe only at Δt=2, so at Δt=3 safe.\n\nRow 1 and 2 unsafe at Δt=2 and 3, so at Δt=3, unsafe.\n\nBut I am going to y=5 at t=9.\n\nt=9, Δt=3, y=5, row 5 safe at Δt=3, since only unsafe at Δt=2.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=6 or 7 at t=9, also safe.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nAt t=6, go up to y=4 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, on y=4, instead of going up, I stay: action S, so y remains 4 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I can go up to y=5 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, on y=5, which is safe, since Δt=3, row 5 safe.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom t=9, y=5, I can go up to y=6 at t=10, etc.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nt=6: start y=3\n\nAction a_6: U, so to y=4 at t=7\n\nt=7: y=4, action a_7: S (stay), so y=4 at t=8\n\nt=8: y=4, action a_8: U, to y=5 at t=9\n\nt=9: y=5, action a_9: U, to y=6 at t=10\n\nt=10: y=6, action a_10: U, to y=7 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=7, action a_11: U, to y=8 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=8, action a_12: U, to y=9 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=9, done.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t=6 to t=6+H, with actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t=6+H.\n\nHere, from t=6 to t=13, that's 7 time steps? t=6 to t=13 is 7 intervals, but actions.\n\nAt time t=6, after 0 actions, position y=3.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=6), position at t=7.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t=6+H.\n\nWe want y_{6+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=13, y=9, so t=6+H=13, so H=7.\n\nActions at t=6 to t=12, 7 actions.\n\nList: actions at t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12: U, S, U, U, U, U, U\n\nThen positions: t=7:y=4, t=8:y=4 (after S), t=9:y=5, t=10:y=6, t=11:y=7, t=12:y=8, t=13:y=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=6: y=3, Δt=0, safe\n\nt=7: y=4, Δt=1, safe\n\nt=8: y=4, Δt=2, row 4 safe, ok\n\nt=9: y=5, Δt=3, row 5 safe (only unsafe at Δt=2), ok\n\nt=10: y=6, Δt=4, row 6 safe (unsafe only Δt=2), ok\n\nt=11: y=7, Δt=5, row 7 safe, ok\n\nt=12: y=8, Δt=6, row 8 safe, ok\n\nt=13: y=9, safe, done.\n\nSo with H=7, it works.\n\nBut is minimal H possible?\n\nMinimal would be 6, but with direct up, we collide at t=8.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nFor example, if I go up at t=6 to y=4 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, instead of staying, I go up to y=5 at t=8, but that collides.\n\nAt t=7, I go down to y=3 at t=8? But y=3 is safe at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=3, I need to go up, but it might take more turns.\n\nFor example: t=6: U, to y=4 t=7\n\nt=7: D, to y=3 t=8\n\nt=8: y=3, safe, then U to y=4 t=9\n\nThen continue up, but now at t=9 y=4, t=10 y=5, etc., to y=9 at t=13 or later, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt t=6, I stay: a_6=S, so at t=7, y=3 still.\n\nThen at t=7, U to y=4 t=8\n\nAt t=8, y=4, safe.\n\nThen same as before, but I wasted one turn staying, so to reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example, t=6: S, y=3 at t=7\n\nt=7: U, y=4 at t=8\n\nt=8: U, y=5 at t=9 (safe)\n\nt=9: U, y=6 at t=10\n\n...\n\nup to y=9 at t=13, but with one extra turn.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the first sequence with one stay at y=4 seems better.\n\nBut can I avoid the stay and still reach in 6 turns?\n\nTo reach y=9 in 6 actions, I need to be at y=9 at t=12.\n\nStart at t=6 y=3, after 6 actions, at t=12 y=9.\n\nSo y_t: t=7:y=?, ..., t=12:y=9.\n\nThe path: from t=7 to t=12, y from ? to 9.\n\nAt t=6 y=3, after action, t=7 y= something.\n\nAfter k actions, position at t=6+k.\n\nAfter 0 actions: t=6 y=3\n\nAfter 1 action: t=7 y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 actions: t=12 y=9\n\nSo the y positions at times: t=6:y=3, t=7:y=?, ..., t=12:y=9.\n\nThe changes: each step, y changes by -1,0,+1.\n\nTo go from y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps, net change +6, so I need exactly 6 up moves, no down or stay, because if I have a down or stay, net change less than 6, so y at t=12 less than 9.\n\nStart y=3, after 6 steps, each step Δy = -1,0, or +1.\n\nFinal y = 3 + sum Δy over 6 steps.\n\nSet to 9, so sum Δy = 6.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so to have sum=6, all Δy must be +1, no down or stay.\n\nTherefore, for minimal H=6, I must go up every turn, no choice.\n\nBut as we saw, that causes collision at t=8 on y=5.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach in 6 turns.\n\nThus minimal H is 7, as in the sequence I had.\n\nBut in the sequence, I had actions: U at t=6, S at t=7, U at t=8, U at t=9, U at t=10, U at t=11, U at t=12.\n\nThat's 7 actions, to t=13 y=9.\n\nBut at t=8, I was on y=4, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, I used one stay.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier with different path, but since H=6 impossible, H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut maybe I can reach at t=12 with y=9 with different actions, but as above, only possible with all up, which collides.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster in some sense, but no, I have to go through each row.\n\nAnother idea: at t=7, I am at y=4, instead of staying, I go down to y=3, but that delays.\n\nOr, I could go directly to y=8 or something, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nPerhaps I can be on a different row at critical times.\n\nFor example, at t=8 (Δt=2), I need to not be on y=5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9 (Δt=3), if I am on y=1 or 2, it would be unsafe, but since I am going up, I might not be on low rows.\n\nNow, with H=7, it works.\n\nBut in the sequence, I used one stay at t=7.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid stay by going down and up, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=6, U to y=4 t=7\n\nt=7, U to y=5 t=8, but collide, not possible.\n\nt=6, D to y=2 t=7, but y=2 at t=7, Δt=1.\n\nNow row 2: unsafe at Δt=2 and 3, so at Δt=1, is it safe? Δt=1, t=7, row 2.\n\nFrom above, row 2 unsafe only at Δt=2 and 3, so at Δt=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 same.\n\nBut if I go to y=2 at t=7, then I need to go up to y=9, which takes more steps.\n\nFor example: t=6: D, to y=2 t=7\n\nt=7: U, to y=3 t=8? Or to y=3?\n\nt=7 y=2, action U to y=3 at t=8\n\nt=8 y=3, safe\n\nThen U to y=4 t=9, etc., but to reach y=9, it takes until t=13 or later, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the sequence with one stay at y=4 seems efficient.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 directly or something, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at t=8, if I could be on y=8, which is safe, but from y=3 at t=6 to y=8 at t=8, that would require two up moves: to y=4 at t=7, to y=5 at t=8, but at t=8 y=5 collide, or if I go faster, impossible.\n\nMaximum I can be at y=5 at t=8, but that collides.\n\nSo I must be at lower or higher row at t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=8, if I am at y=4, as in the sequence.\n\nOr y=3 or y=8, but y=8 at t=8 from start: at t=6 y=3, to y=8 at t=8, need +5 in two steps, impossible, max y=5.\n\nSimilarly, min y=1 or something.\n\nSo at t=8, possible y: since from t=6 to t=8, two actions, from y=3, so y can be 1,2,3,4,5.\n\ny=1,2,3,4,5 possible at t=8.\n\nBut y=5 at t=8 collides, y=1 and 2 at t=8: row 1 and 2 unsafe at Δt=2, so also collide.\n\ny=3 and y=4 safe.\n\nSo at t=8, I must be on y=3 or y=4.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, I was on y=4.\n\nIf on y=3 at t=8, then from there, I need to go to y=9, which takes 6 more steps? From t=8 y=3 to y=9, need 6 up, to t=14 y=9, with H=8, worse.\n\nBut in the sequence with stay, at t=8 y=4, then to y=9 in 5 steps? From t=8 y=4 to t=13 y=9, 5 up moves.\n\nt=8 y=4, U to y=5 t=9, U to y=6 t=10, U to y=7 t=11, U to y=8 t=12, U to y=9 t=13.\n\nYes, 5 actions from t=8 to t=12, position at t=13.\n\nWith the stay at t=7.\n\nNow, back to the answer.\n\nIn the sequence I have: actions at t=6: U, t=7: S, t=8: U, t=9: U, t=10: U, t=11: U, t=12: U.\n\nBut t=9 to t=12 all U.\n\nNow, in terms of the turn: current turn t_1=6.\n\nSequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t_1 +0} = a_6\n\nt=1: a_{t_1 +1} = a_7\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAnd after, position at t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, H=7, so actions for t=0 to 6: a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, a_12.\n\nWith a_6=U, a_7=S, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U.\n\nPosition at t=13 y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, at t=9, I have U, to y=5 at t=10? Let's list times.\n\nAt time t, action a_t, then position at t+1.\n\nt=6: a_6=U, position at t=7: y=4\n\nt=7: a_7=S, position at t=8: y=4\n\nt=8: a_8=U, position at t=9: y=5\n\nt=9: a_9=U, position at t=10: y=6\n\nt=10: a_10=U, position at t=11: y=7\n\nt=11: a_11=U, position at t=12: y=8\n\nt=12: a_12=U, position at t=13: y=9\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but at t=9, position y=5 at time t=9, Δt=3, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter sequence by going to y=8 or something, but I think 7 is minimal.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at t=6, I go up to y=4 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I go up to y=5 at t=8, but collide, not possible.\n\nOr, at t=6, I stay, to y=3 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, U to y=4 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=4, same as before, then U to y=5 at t=9, etc., but I started with stay, so to reach y=9 at t=13 still, but with a_6=S instead of U, so I have an extra stay, but same H=7? No.\n\nt=6: S, position t=7: y=3\n\nt=7: U, position t=8: y=4\n\nt=8: U, position t=9: y=5\n\nsame as before from t=9, but I reached y=4 at t=8 instead of t=7? In the first sequence, at t=7 I had y=4, here at t=7 I have y=3, at t=8 y=4.\n\nThen t=8: U to y=5 t=9, etc., up to t=13 y=9.\n\nBut actions: a_6=S, a_7=U, a_8=U, ..., a_12=U, still 7 actions, to t=13.\n\nBut in this case, at t=7, I was at y=3, which is fine, but I used a stay at the beginning instead of later.\n\nBut H is the same, 7.\n\nIn terms of time to reach, it reaches at same time t=13.\n\nBut in the first sequence, with a_6=U, I was at y=4 earlier, but still reach y=9 at same time.\n\nNo difference.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I had a stay at t=7, here stay at t=6.\n\nBut minimal H is 7.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t=12 with y=9 by having one less action, but impossible as sum Δy must be 6.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start from y=3.\n\nAnother idea: use down to gain time, but down would make me go lower, take more steps to come up.\n\nFor example, at t=6, U to y=4 t=7\n\nt=7, D to y=3 t=8\n\nt=8, y=3\n\nThen t=8 U to y=4 t=9\n\nt=9 U to y=5 t=10\n\n...\n\nto t=13 y=9, with H=7 still, but I have a down move, which is worse because I went down and up, but net same, but reached same time.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo the sequence with only one stay and all else up seems fine.\n\nIn the sequence, I have six up and one stay, net +5, from 3 to 8? Start y=3, after actions, to y=9, net +6, with 6 up and one stay, but stay is Δy=0, so 6 up would be +6, but with one stay, I have only 5 up? In my sequence: actions U,S,U,U,U,U,U, that's one stay and six up? U at t6,t8,t9,t10,t11,t12: six U, and one S at t7.\n\nActions: a6:U, a7:S, a8:U, a9:U, a10:U, a11:U, a12:U. So seven actions: positions: after a6: y=4, after a7: y=4, after a8: y=5, ..., after a12: y=9. So from start y=3 to end y=9, with six up and one stay, net +6, yes.\n\nThe stay doesn't change y, but I still need the action.\n\nNow, back to the car on row 7, etc., but in the sequence, when I am on row 7 at t=11, Δt=5, which is safe, no car.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can have a sequence with H=7 but different actions.\n\nFor example, instead of staying at y=4, I could stay at another row, but y=4 is convenient.\n\nAt t=6, I go to y=4, then at t=7, I must not go to y=5, so I stay or go down, stay is better.\n\nGo down to y=3, but then I need to come back.\n\nSo stay at y=4 is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=8 at some point, but impossible.\n\nAnother thought: since row 8 is always safe, and I can be there.\n\nBut to reach y=8 from y=3, need 5 up, min 5 turns, but with the collision issue.\n\nFor example, to be at y=8 at t=11, say.\n\nt=6 y=3, to t=11 y=8, that's 5 actions, so possible with all up: but at t=8 y=5 collide if go directly.\n\nWith delay: t=6 U to y4 t7, t7 S to y4 t8, t8 U to y5 t9, t9 U to y6 t10, t10 U to y7 t11, t11 U to y8 t12.\n\nThen at t=12 y=8, need to go to y=9 with another action.\n\nBut in this case, at t=11 y=7, Δt=5, safe.\n\nThen a11 U to y8 t12, then a12 U to y9 t13, same as before.\n\nIf I want to reach y=9 at t=12, I need to be at y=8 at t=11, but to be at y=8 at t=11 from y=3 at t=6, 5 actions, net +5, so need 5 up, no down or stay.\n\nBut with 5 up: t=6 U to y4 t7, t7 U to y5 t8, but at t8 y5 collide.\n\nCannot.\n\nt=6 U to y4 t7, t7 U to y5 t8 collide.\n\nNo other way with all up.\n\nSo impossible to reach before t=13.\n\nThus minimal H=7.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions.\n\nBut in the car state, for row 7, we have cars, but unsafe only at Δt=2, so at other times safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me write for the turn.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=6.\n\nSequence for t from 0 to H-1=6, since H=7.\n\na_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 6.\n\nSo a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, a_12.\n\nActions: U, S, U, U, U, U, U\n\nIn the format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is a_6: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_7: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_8: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_9: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: a_10: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: a_11: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: a_12: U\n\nH=7, so t from 0 to 6, that's 7 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 6: U Turn 7: S Turn 8: U Turn 9: U Turn 10: U Turn 11: U Turn 12: U }\n\nBut the turn numbers are absolute, I think.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so with t_1=6.\n\nIn the box, it should be written.\n\nBut let me confirm if there is a sequence with H=7 but without stay, but with down, but down would require more up, so net same or worse.\n\nFor example, a_6=U, a_7=U, but collide at t=8, not possible.\n\na_6=U, a_7=D, to y=3 at t=8, then a_8=U to y=4 t9, etc., but to reach y=9 at t=13, same, but with down move, which is unnecessary.\n\nSo the sequence with stay is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 faster by being on safe rows.\n\nFor example, at t=8, if I am on y=8, but cannot reach from y=3 in two steps.\n\nMax y=5 at t=8.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think it's optimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with the sequence above.\n\nNow, in the output, I need to write it.\n\nBut the car on row 3,4,8 are always safe, which we used.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go to y=5 at t=9, Δt=3, which is safe, as row 5 unsafe only at Δt=2.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on rows \\(y = 1, 2, 5, 6, 7\\) at the critical times when those rows are unsafe (specifically, at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 3\\), corresponding to turns 8 and 9).\n\n- At turn 8 (\\(\\Delta t = 2\\)), rows \\(y = 1, 2, 5, 6, 7\\) are unsafe due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\). To avoid collision, the player must be on a safe row (\\(y = 3, 4, 8\\), or \\(0/9\\)) at this turn.\n- The sequence includes a \"stay\" (S) action at turn 7 to remain on row \\(y = 4\\) at turn 8, which is safe, as row 4 is always safe.\n- After turn 8, the player moves up each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 13.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n- At turn 6, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 8, avoiding collision since row 4 is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\).\n- At turn 8, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 9. Row 5 is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\) (turn 9) since it is only unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\).\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 10. Row 6 is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\).\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 11. Row 7 is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 5\\).\n- At turn 11, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 12. Row 8 is always safe.\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 13.\n\nCollision checks:\n- Turn 6 (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\)): \\(y = 3\\), row 3 safe.\n- Turn 7 (\\(\\Delta t = 1\\)): \\(y = 4\\), row 4 safe.\n- Turn 8 (\\(\\Delta t = 2\\)): \\(y = 4\\), row 4 safe.\n- Turn 9 (\\(\\Delta t = 3\\)): \\(y = 5\\), row 5 safe (unsafe only at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\)).\n- Turn 10 (\\(\\Delta t = 4\\)): \\(y = 6\\), row 6 safe (unsafe only at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\)).\n- Turn 11 (\\(\\Delta t = 5\\)): \\(y = 7\\), row 7 safe (unsafe only at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\)).\n- Turn 12 (\\(\\Delta t = 6\\)): \\(y = 8\\), row 8 safe.\n- Turn 13: \\(y = 9\\), safe (no cars).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 7\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} }",

The current turn is t1=7, but I think that's a typo; it says t0=7, but I'll use t=7 as the starting turn.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases by 1, stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, given its position at t=7, I need to find where it is at future turns to avoid being on that y when the car spans include x=0.\n\nCollision happens at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T and for that y, there's a car whose span includes x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nIf I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the cars on the y I'm currently on when I'm on it.\n\nThe player position update: at each turn, I choose an action, and y changes accordingly. After the action, I'm at the new y for that turn.\n\nLet me read carefully:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, after the action, I am at y_{T+1}? No.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nThe action a_t is taken at turn t, and it determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe game says: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\" where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nThen, at turn t, the player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nI think I need to distinguish the turn and the position.\n\nAt the start of turn t, player is at (0, y_t).\n\nThen, action a_t is chosen, which sets y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut for collision, it says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's y at turn T, I assume.\n\nBut Span(T) is the car's span at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T, and if for that freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T, then collision.\n\nThe note clarifies that when you move, at the turn you move, you are still on the old y until the action is taken.\n\nLet's parse the note:\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\n\"at turn T\" – so when you are at turn T, you are at position y_T.\n\nThen you decide to move to y_{T+1}, which might be different.\n\nAfter deciding, at turn T, you are still at y_T for the purpose of collision, I think.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the car spans at T.\n\nThen, after the action, you move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo, at each turn T, collision depends on y_T (current position) and cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf you choose to change y, at turn T you are on y_T, and at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, you are on y, and you choose U, then at turn T, you are on y, and at turn T+1 you are on y+1.\n\nCollision at turn T depends only on y and cars on y at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, it depends on y_{T+1} and cars on that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so even if cars on y_{T+1} have 0 in span at T, it doesn't matter because you're not there yet.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nIn this case, for collision avoidance, I only need to worry about the freeway I am currently on at each turn.\n\nNow, I start at turn t=7, position y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is the goal, which is probably not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, I think. y=0 and y=9 might be safe or something.\n\nThe grid is y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so I can be there safely.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), so once I reach y=9, I'm done, and no collision possible there.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but I start from y=4 and need to go up to 9, so probably won't go down.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go from 4 to 9, that's a difference of 5, so if I move up every turn, I can do it in 5 turns: from y=4 to 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I have to avoid collisions on freeways y=1 to 8 during the journey.\n\nAt each turn, when I'm on a freeway y, I need to ensure that at that turn, no car on that freeway has x=0 in its span.\n\nOtherwise, collision.\n\nSo, for the direct path: I start at y=4 at t=7.\n\nI need to be at y=4,5,6,7,8 at some turns, and avoid collisions on those.\n\ny=4 is a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=4 is freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 is 5, etc.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so safe.\n\nIn the sequence, when I reach y=9, I stop, so I don't need to be on y=9 at a turn where it might be bad, but since no cars, it's fine.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway at t=7.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1: cars: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nDirection right means moving right, so increasing x.\n\nCar update: for left-moving, head and tail decrease; right-moving, head and tail increase.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, head is left, tail is right? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says [h, τ], but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be the front, so if moving left, head might be smaller x.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nThe notation is a bit inconsistent.\n\nFor freeway 1, both cars are right-moving: first car (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h]? It says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nIn the car state, it says \"cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], but τ is tail, h is head, so if moving right, head should be at higher x, so for example, here h=-6, τ=-17, but -6 > -17, so if head is at -6, tail at -17, that would be from x=-17 to x=-6, but since moving right, head should be the front.\n\nI think there might be confusion in the notation.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor car update:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIf moving left, the car is going left, so the head (front) should be decreasing.\n\nSo if span is [h, τ], with h and τ, and for left-moving, h - sΔT, τ - sΔT, so if h > τ, then the span shifts left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, if [τ, h], and τ + sΔT, h + sΔT, so if τ < h, it shifts right.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, first car: head h=-6, tail τ=-17, direction right, speed 6.\n\nAt t1, for right-moving, span is given as [τ, h] = [-17, -6]? But τ is tail, h is head, so if moving right, head should be on the right, so here h=-6, τ=-17, so head at -6, tail at -17, so the car is from x=-17 to x=-6, with head at -6, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-17, -6] for this car? The notation says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving.\n\nIn the text: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving.\n\nBut τ and h are given as (h, τ, d, s), so for this car, h=-6, τ=-17, so [τ, h] = [-17, -6].\n\nSimilarly, second car: (42,31,right,6), h=42, τ=31, so [τ,h] = [31,42].\n\nNow for left-moving, it would be [h, τ], but in this case, all cars here are right-moving, I think.\n\nLet's list all freeways.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nSo at t=7, spans: for first car, [τ,h] = [-17,-6]? No: [τ, h] with τ=-17, h=-6, so [-17, -6]\n\nSimilarly, second car [τ,h] = [31,42]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: (96,49,right,48) → [τ,h] = [49,96]? h=96, τ=49, so [τ,h] = [49,96]\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3: (96,49,right,48) → [49,96]\n\nFreeway 5: (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=36, τ=25, [τ,h] = [25,36]\n\nSecond car: h=-48, τ=-59? τ=-59, h=-48, [τ,h] = [-59,-48]\n\nThird car: h=-12, τ=-23, [τ,h] = [-23,-12]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5 and 6.\n\nFreeway 8: (96,49,right,48) → [49,96]\n\nNow, I need to find at each future turn T, for each freeway, where the cars are, and if x=0 is in any span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nSince the player is on one freeway at a time, I only care about the freeway I'm on at that turn.\n\nI start at t=7, y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars with spans at t=7: [49,96], which is far right, 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at t=7, let's see if any have 0 in span.\n\nFreeway 1: [-17,-6] and [31,42], 0 not in either.\n\nFreeway 2: same.\n\nFreeway 3: [49,96], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: [25,36], [-59,-48], [-23,-12], all not including 0.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nSo at t=7, on y=4, no collision, since no car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal H is 5, if I go up each turn.\n\nStart at t=7, y=4.\n\nAfter action at t=7, y_{8} = y_7 + Δy, but y_{t+1} is after action.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nFor collision at turn t, it depends on y_t.\n\nAt t=7, I am at y=4, and no collision, as above.\n\nI want to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSuppose I go up each turn.\n\nAction at t=7: U, then y_{8} = 5\n\nAt turn t=8, I am at y=5.\n\nI need to check if on freeway 5 at t=8, is there collision?\n\nSimilarly, action at t=8: U, y_{9} =6, at t=9 on y=6, and so on.\n\nFinally, after action at some turn, y reaches 9.\n\nLet's define the turns.\n\nSet t=7 as current turn, so at time t=7, position y=4.\n\nI choose action a_7, which determines y_8.\n\nThen at t=8, position y_8, and so on.\n\nI reach y=9 when for some T, y_T =9.\n\nSince I start at t=7, y=4, and each U increases y by 1, I need 5 steps: after 5 U actions, y_{12} =4 +5 =9.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\ny_7 =4\n\nAfter a_7: if U, y_8 =5\n\nAt t=8, y=5\n\na_8: U, y_9=6\n\nt=9, y=6\n\na_9: U, y_{10}=7\n\nt=10, y=7\n\na_{10}: U, y_{11}=8\n\nt=11, y=8\n\na_{11}: U, y_{12}=9\n\nAt t=12, y=9, done.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that at each turn from t=7 to t=11, when I am on y=4,5,6,7,8 respectively, there is no collision on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAt t=7, y=4, we saw no collision.\n\nAt t=8, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nAt turn T=8, which is T-t1=1, t1=7, so Δt = T - t1 = 8-7=1.\n\nFor freeway 5 at T=8.\n\nCars on freeway 5: three cars, all right-moving, speed 12.\n\nAt t=7, spans:\n\nFirst car: [τ,h] = [25,36] at t=7\n\nAt T=8, span = [τ + s(Δt), h + s(Δt)] = [25 + 12*1, 36 + 12*1] = [37,48]\n\nSimilarly, second car: at t=7 [τ,h] = [-59,-48], at T=8: [-59 +12, -48 +12] = [-47,-36]\n\nThird car: at t=7 [τ,h] = [-23,-12], at T=8: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]\n\n[-11,0], and 0 is included? Span is [left, right], I assume inclusive.\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ] includes x=0.\n\nAt t=8, on freeway 5, third car has span [-11,0], which includes 0, so if player is on y=5 at t=8, collision occurs.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at t=8, I am on y=5, so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on freeway 5 at t=8.\n\nIn the direct path, it would collide at t=8 on y=5.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nI could delay or something.\n\nSince the car is moving, at different times, the spans change.\n\nI could stay or move down to avoid being there at bad times.\n\nBut I need to minimize turns, so probably not move down.\n\nI could go slower or faster.\n\nH=5 is minimal only if possible, but here it might not be.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=5 at a different turn.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=8, y=5 is bad.\n\nBut if I don't go up at t=7, I might be on y=5 later.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nLet's find for each freeway and each turn, whether x=0 is occupied by any car.\n\nThat is, for each k and T, if there is a car on k with 0 in span at T.\n\nThen, when I am on that k at T, collision.\n\nI need to plan the path so that when I am on freeway y at turn T, it is safe.\n\ny from 1 to 8.\n\nT from t=7 onwards.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at which turns x=0 is covered.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we have discrete turns.\n\nt1=7.\n\nFor a car, span at T is linear in T.\n\n0 in span if for some car, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince spans are intervals.\n\nFor each car, we can find when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen for a freeway, if any car has 0 in span at T, then the freeway is occupied at T.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nThen for player, when on freeway k at T, if k is occupied at T, collision; else safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1\n\nCars: car A: (-6,-17,right,6) → at t1=7, [τ,h] = [-17,-6]\n\nSince right-moving, at T, span [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)] = [-17 + 6(T-7), -6 + 6(T-7)]\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, min is left end, max is right end.\n\nHere, left end L = -17 + 6(Δt), right end R = -6 + 6(Δt), with Δt = T-7\n\n0 in [L,R] if L <= 0 <= R\n\nSimilarly, car B: (42,31,right,6) → at t1, [τ,h] = [31,42], at T: [31 + 6(Δt), 42 + 6(Δt)]\n\nFor car A: L_A = -17 + 6(Δt), R_A = -6 + 6(Δt)\n\n0 in [L_A, R_A] if -17 + 6(Δt) <= 0 <= -6 + 6(Δt)\n\nSimilarly for car B: L_B = 31 + 6(Δt), R_B = 42 + 6(Δt)\n\nNow, for freeway 1, occupied at T if either car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst, car A: L_A <= 0 <= R_A\n\nL_A <= 0: -17 + 6(Δt) <= 0 → 6(Δt) <= 17 → Δt <= 17/6 ≈ 2.833, so Δt <= 2 since integer.\n\n0 <= R_A: 0 <= -6 + 6(Δt) → 6 <= 6(Δt) → Δt >=1\n\nSo for car A, 0 in span when Δt >=1 and Δt <=2\n\nΔt=1: L_A = -17+6= -11, R_A= -6+6=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=2: L_A= -17+12= -5, R_A= -6+12=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=3: L_A= -17+18=1, R_A= -6+18=12, [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0<1, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, car B: L_B=31+6(Δt), R_B=42+6(Δt), both positive for Δt>=0, so L_B >=31 >0, so 0 never in [L_B,R_B] for car B.\n\nThus for freeway 1, occupied only when car A has 0 in span, i.e., at Δt=1 and Δt=2, i.e., T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8 (Δt=1), occupied; T=9 (Δt=2), occupied; other times safe.\n\nT=7: Δt=0, L_A=-17, R_A=-6, both negative, 0 not in; car B, L_B=31>0, so safe.\n\nT=10: Δt=3, car A [1,12], 0 not in; car B [31+18=49,42+18=60? L_B=31+18=49, R_B=42+18=60, [49,60], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nSimilarly later.\n\nSo freeway 1 occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFreeway 2 is same as freeway 1, since same cars, so also occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 3: k=3, car: (96,49,right,48) → at t1, [τ,h] = [49,96]\n\nAt T: [49 + 48(Δt), 96 + 48(Δt)]\n\nL =49 +48(Δt) >0 for all Δt>=0, so 0 never in span. Always safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: k=5, three cars.\n\nCar C: (36,25,right,12) → [τ,h] = [25,36] at t1, at T: [25 +12(Δt), 36 +12(Δt)]\n\nL_C =25+12(Δt) >0, always, so 0 never in.\n\nCar D: (-48,-59,right,12) → h=-48, τ=-59, [τ,h] = [-59,-48] at t1\n\nAt T: [ -59 +12(Δt), -48 +12(Δt) ]\n\n0 in span if L_D <=0 <= R_D\n\nL_D = -59 +12(Δt) <=0 → 12(Δt) <=59 → Δt <=59/12≈4.916, so Δt<=4\n\n0 <= R_D: 0 <= -48 +12(Δt) → 12(Δt) >=48 → Δt >=4\n\nSo for car D, 0 in span only when Δt=4\n\nΔt=4: L_D= -59+48= -11, R_D= -48+48=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=3: L_D= -59+36= -23, R_D= -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nΔt=5: L_D= -59+60=1, R_D= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar E: (-12,-23,right,12) → [τ,h] = [-23,-12] at t1\n\nAt T: [ -23 +12(Δt), -12 +12(Δt) ]\n\n0 in span if L_E <=0 <= R_E\n\nL_E = -23 +12(Δt) <=0 → 12(Δt) <=23 → Δt <=23/12≈1.916, so Δt<=1\n\n0 <= R_E: 0 <= -12 +12(Δt) → 12(Δt) >=12 → Δt >=1\n\nSo for car E, 0 in span only when Δt=1\n\nΔt=1: L_E= -23+12= -11, R_E= -12+12=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nNow, for freeway 5, occupied if any car has 0 in span.\n\nCar C never.\n\nCar D at Δt=4\n\nCar E at Δt=1\n\nSo occupied at T when Δt=1 or Δt=4, i.e., T=8 or T=11.\n\nΔt=1: T=8\n\nΔt=4: T=11\n\nT=7: Δt=0, all cars: car C [25,36], car D [-59,-48], car E [-23,-12], all not include 0.\n\nT=9: Δt=2, car E: L_E= -23+24=1, R_E= -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in; car D: L_D= -59+24= -35, R_D= -48+24= -24, [-35,-24], no; car C: [25+24=49,36+24=60], no. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, only at T=8 and T=11 occupied.\n\nFreeway 6 same as 5, occupied at T=8 and T=11.\n\nFreeway 7 same, occupied at T=8 and T=11.\n\nFreeway 8: k=8, car (96,49,right,48) → same as freeway 3, always safe.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, occupied (unsafe) at turns:\n\nk=1: unsafe at T=8,9\n\nk=2: unsafe at T=8,9\n\nk=3: always safe\n\nk=4: always safe\n\nk=5: unsafe at T=8,11\n\nk=6: unsafe at T=8,11\n\nk=7: unsafe at T=8,11\n\nk=8: always safe\n\nT=7 to whatever.\n\nNow, player starts at t=7, y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 is always safe, so at t=7, on y=4, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are freeways, need to traverse them safely.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on unsafe y at unsafe times.\n\nI start at t=7, y=4.\n\nIf I go up at t=7, to y=5 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=5 is freeway 5, which is unsafe at t=8, as above.\n\nIf I stay at t=7, action S, then y_{8} =4, so at t=8 still on y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is safe always, but I need to go up.\n\nI could go up later.\n\nList the turns and possible positions.\n\nI need to be on each y from 4 to 8 at some point, but not necessarily consecutively, since I can move up and down, but to minimize turns, probably go directly.\n\nSince y=4 is safe at all times, I can stay if needed.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,2,1 might be safe or not, but I don't want to go down, as it wastes turns.\n\ny=0 is safe, but below.\n\nStart from t=7, y=4.\n\nI want to reach y=9 with min H, meaning min number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{7+H} =9.\n\ny_{7+H} = y_7 + sum of Δy from t=7 to t=7+H-1.\n\ny_7 =4, want y_{7+H} =9, so net +5, so I need at least 5 U actions, and H at least 5.\n\nWith exactly 5 U actions, H=5, y_{12}=9.\n\nBut in this case, the path is fixed: y_t for t=7 to 12: y7=4, y8=5, y9=6, y10=7, y11=8, y12=9.\n\nNow, check for each t, if on freeway and unsafe.\n\nt=7: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nt=8: y=5, freeway 5, unsafe at t=8, as occupied. Collision.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nThus, with H=5, it collides.\n\nSo minimal H must be more than 5.\n\nNow, H=6: I need net +5, so I must have 5 U and one extra action, which could be S or D.\n\nIf S, I stay at some point, delaying.\n\nIf D, I go down and up, wasting more.\n\nProbably S is better to avoid bad times.\n\nSimilarly, H=7, etc.\n\nBut I want minimal H.\n\nSo try H=6.\n\nWith H=6 actions, from t=7 to t=12, y_{13}=9? Let's see.\n\nActions from t=7 to t=7+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=7+H, position y_{7+H}.\n\nSet t_start =7.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=7, y=4.\n\nAfter 1 action (a_7), at t=8, y_8.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at t=7+k.\n\nI want y_{7+H} =9.\n\ny_{7+H} =4 + number of U minus number of D, since each U +1, D -1, S 0.\n\nLet U_num, D_num, S_num, with U_num - D_num =5, and U_num + D_num + S_num = H.\n\nSince net +5.\n\ny_{7+H} - y_7 = sum Δy = U_num *1 + D_num *(-1) + S_num *0 = U_num - D_num.\n\nSet to 5.\n\nAnd H = U_num + D_num + S_num.\n\nSo U_num - D_num =5\n\nH = U_num + D_num + S_num\n\nThen H = (U_num - D_num) + 2 D_num + S_num = 5 + 2 D_num + S_num\n\nSince D_num >=0, S_num >=0, H >=5.\n\nH=5 only if D_num=0 and S_num=0, which we saw causes collision.\n\nH=6: then 6 = 5 + 2 D_num + S_num, so 2 D_num + S_num =1.\n\nThus either D_num=0, S_num=1 or D_num=1, S_num=0? 2*0 + S_num=1, S_num=1; or 2*1 +0=2>1, not; or D_num=1, S_num= -1, impossible.\n\n2 D_num + S_num =1, D_num and S_num integers >=0.\n\nSo possibilities: D_num=0, S_num=1; or D_num=1, S_num= -1 impossible; so only D_num=0, S_num=1.\n\nThus with H=6, I must have exactly 5 U and 1 S, no D.\n\nSo I stay once.\n\nNow, I need to choose where and when to stay to avoid the collision.\n\nThe path: I go up 5 times but stay once, so the sequence of y will have one repeat.\n\nFor example, stay at some y, then continue.\n\nNow, the collision in the direct path was at t=8 on y=5.\n\nI need not to be on y=5 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, other unsafe points.\n\nNow, with one stay, I can delay.\n\nFor example, start at t=7, y=4.\n\nInstead of U at t=7, I do S, so a_7=S, then y_8=4, still on y=4 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, I can go U to y=5 at t=9.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut at t=9, y=5, is it safe?\n\nt=9, freeway 5.\n\nFrom earlier, freeway 5 occupied at T=8 and T=11.\n\nT=9, Δt=2, safe, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, then.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=7: y=4, action a_7=S? If a_7=S, y_8=4\n\nAt t=8: y=4, which is safe, freeway 4 always safe.\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=5\n\nAt t=9: y=5, freeway 5. T=9, which is Δt=2 from t1=7, freeway 5 safe at t=9, as not occupied.\n\nThen a_9=U, y_{10}=6\n\nAt t=10: y=6, freeway 6. Freeway 6 unsafe at T=8 and T=11.\n\nT=10, Δt=3, not 8 or 11, so safe? T=10, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 same as 5, unsafe at T=8 and T=11.\n\nT=10 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_{10}=U, y_{11}=7\n\nAt t=11: y=7, freeway 7. Unsafe at T=8 and T=11? T=11 is unsafe for freeway 7.\n\nT=11, Δt=4, freeway 7 occupied at T=11, as per earlier.\n\nAt t=11, y=7, freeway 7, and T=11, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\na_{11}=U? y_{11}=7 at t=11.\n\nThen if I go U, a_{11}=U, y_{12}=8, but at t=11, I am on y=7, which is unsafe if T=11.\n\nt=11, Δt=4, freeway 7 occupied, yes.\n\nSo collision at t=11 on y=7.\n\nNot good.\n\nIn this sequence, I have:\n\nt=7: y=4, safe\n\na_7=S, y_8=4\n\nt=8: y=4, safe\n\na_8=U, y_9=5\n\nt=9: y=5, safe (freeway 5 safe at t=9)\n\na_9=U, y_{10}=6\n\nt=10: y=6, safe (freeway 6 safe at t=10)\n\na_{10}=U, y_{11}=7\n\nt=11: y=7, but freeway 7 unsafe at t=11, collision.\n\nThen if I go to y_{11}=7, collision.\n\nBut I need to go to y=8 and then 9.\n\nAt t=11, if I do not go up, but stay or something, but I have to reach y=9.\n\ny_{11}=7, then a_{11} could be S or U or D.\n\nIf S, y_{12}=7, still on y=7 at t=12, but t=12, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 7 at T=12.\n\nT=12, Δt=5, freeway 7: for car, Δt=5, car E: for freeway 7, same as 5,6.\n\nCar E: at Δt=5, L_E= -23+60=37? Earlier: for car E, L_E = -23 +12(Δt), at Δt=5, -23+60=37, R_E= -12+60=48, [37,48], no 0.\n\nCar D: at Δt=5, L_D= -59+60=1, R_D= -48+60=12, [1,12], no 0.\n\nCar C: always no.\n\nSo at t=12, freeway 7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 unsafe only at t=8 and t=11.\n\nt=11 unsafe, t=12 safe.\n\nBack to sequence.\n\nAt t=11, if I am on y=7 and I do S, then at t=11 I am on y=7, which is unsafe because T=11, collision.\n\nThe collision happens when I am on the freeway at that turn, regardless of action.\n\nAt turn t=11, position y=7, and since freeway 7 is occupied at t=11, collision occurs before I can take action, I think.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T based on position and cars.\n\nSo at t=11, if y=7, and freeway occupied, collision, game over.\n\nSo I must not be on y=7 at t=11.\n\nIn the above sequence, I end up on y=7 at t=11, which is bad.\n\nBut with the stay, I have a_7=S, so I delayed.\n\nI could stay at a different point.\n\nAnother idea: at t=7, go U to y=5 at t=8, but t=8 y=5 is unsafe, so I must avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I can go up but skip the bad time.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=4, I could do nothing, or go down, but that wastes.\n\nSince H=6, I have one S, I can insert it to avoid bad times.\n\nThe bad times are: for y=5, unsafe at t=8 and t=11\n\nBut t=11 is late.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 same unsafe times as y=5,6,7 all have same unsafe times: t=8 and t=11.\n\ny=5,6,7 all unsafe at t=8 and t=11.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, always safe.\n\ny=4 always safe.\n\nIn the direct path, t=8 y=5 unsafe, t=11 y=8? In direct, at t=11 y=8, but y=8 safe.\n\nBut earlier at t=8 collision.\n\nWith one stay, I can be at y=4 for two turns or something.\n\nList the path with one stay.\n\nI need to be on y=5,6,7,8 at some safe times.\n\ny=5 safe when not t=8 or t=11, so for example t=7,9,10,12,... but t=7 I am at y=4, not 5.\n\nAt t=7, y=4.\n\nI can be on y=5 at t=9 or t=10, etc.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince I have to go through, and with one stay, the sequence might be like: go to y=5 at t=9, then y=6 at t=10, y=7 at t=11 or t=12, but t=11 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo avoid y=7 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSet the actions.\n\nStart: t=7, y=4\n\nI need to reach y=9 at t=7+H.\n\nWith H=6, y_{13}=9.\n\nAfter 6 actions, at t=13.\n\ny_7=4\n\ny_{13}=9\n\nWith 5U and 1S.\n\nThe y sequence: from t=7 to t=13.\n\nt=7: y=4\n\nAfter actions, y at each turn.\n\nThe position at turn t is determined after previous actions.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nt=7: y=4\n\nAfter a_7, y_8\n\nAfter a_8, y_9\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{12}, y_{13}\n\nWe want y_{13}=9.\n\ny_{13} = y_7 + sum_{t=7 to 12} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSince net +5, and 6 actions, one must be S, others U.\n\nNow, the path: y_t for t=7 to 13.\n\ny_7=4\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8, etc.\n\nI need y_{13}=9.\n\nSince one S, the y values will have one plateau.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=4 for two turns: a_7=S, then y_8=4, then a_8=U, y_9=5, etc.\n\nOr stay at y=5 later, etc.\n\nBut y=5 at t=8 is bad, but in this case I avoid it.\n\nIn the first sequence I tried: a_7=S, y_8=4\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=5\n\nThen a_9=U, y_{10}=6\n\nThen a_{10}=U, y_{11}=7\n\nBut at t=11, y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=8 and 9.\n\nAt t=11, y=7, if I do U, y_{12}=8, but at t=11, I am on y=7, collision before action? I think collision is checked at the beginning of the turn or during.\n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nI think it is checked when the player is at position for that turn.\n\nSo at turn T, with position y_T, check collision based on cars at T.\n\nIf collision, game over, no action.\n\nElse, can take action.\n\nIn this case, at t=11, if y=7, and freeway occupied, collision, cannot take action.\n\nSo must not be on unsafe y at unsafe T.\n\nIn sequence: if y_{11}=7, and t=11 unsafe for y=7, collision.\n\nTo avoid, in this path, at t=11 I should not be on y=7.\n\nSo, when I have a_10=U to y_{11}=7, but t=11 bad, so I need to arrive at y=7 at a different time.\n\nFor example, arrive at y=7 at t=10 or t=12.\n\nt=10: freeway 7 safe at t=10, since unsafe only t=8,11.\n\nt=10 safe.\n\nt=12 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have a_9=U to y_{10}=6 at t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, y=6, safe.\n\nThen a_{10}=U to y_{11}=7, but t=11 y=7 unsafe.\n\nInstead, at t=10, I could do S, so y_{11}=6, then at t=11 on y=6.\n\nt=11, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at t=8 and t=11.\n\nt=11 unsafe, so if on y=6 at t=11, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=10, after being on y=6 at t=10, I could do D, but that wastes, go down to y=5 or something, but worse.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo with the current delay, I have problem at t=11.\n\nI need to delay more or differently.\n\nStart by going up at t=7, but then at t=8 I am on y=5, which is unsafe, so I must not go up at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, if I go U, y_8=5, and t=8 y=5 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I cannot go up at t=7.\n\nMust start with S or D, but D worse, so S.\n\na_7=S, y_8=4\n\nNow at t=8, y=4, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=5.\n\nAt t=8, I can go U, so a_8=U, y_9=5\n\nAt t=9, y=5, safe, as t=9 not unsafe for y=5.\n\nThen at t=9, I can go U, a_9=U, y_{10}=6\n\nAt t=10, y=6, safe (t=10 not unsafe for y=6)\n\nThen at t=10, if I go U, a_{10}=U, y_{11}=7, but t=11 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo instead, at t=10, I can stay, a_{10}=S, then y_{11}=6\n\nAt t=11, y=6, but t=11 y=6 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=10, go D, but down to y=5, then I need to go up again, waste actions.\n\nFor example, a_{10}=D, y_{11}=5\n\nAt t=11, y=5, but t=11 y=5 unsafe, collision.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo I need to be at y=7 at a safe time, like t=10 or t=12.\n\nCurrently, at t=10 I am at y=6.\n\nIf I go U at t=10 to y_{11}=7, t=11 bad.\n\nBut I can go to y=7 earlier or later.\n\nAt t=9, I am at y=5.\n\nIf I go U at t=9 to y_{10}=6, as before.\n\nBut from y=5 at t=9, I could go directly to y=7? No, only one step per turn.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo from y=5, it takes at least two steps to y=7.\n\nFor example, at t=9, y=5, a_9=U, y_{10}=6\n\nThen a_{10}=U, y_{11}=7, but t=11 bad.\n\nOr a_9=S, y_{10}=5, then at t=10 y=5, which is safe at t=10, then a_{10}=U, y_{11}=6, then a_{11}=U, y_{12}=7, but at t=12 y=7, which is safe, since t=12 not unsafe.\n\nThen I can proceed.\n\nLet's see.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=7: y=4, a_7=S, y_8=4\n\nt=8: y=4, a_8=U, y_9=5\n\nt=9: y=5, now at t=9, y=5 safe.\n\nInstead of going up, I stay: a_9=S, y_{10}=5\n\nt=10: y=5, safe (t=10 not unsafe for y=5)\n\nThen a_{10}=U, y_{11}=6\n\nt=11: y=6, but t=11 y=6 unsafe! Freeway 6 unsafe at t=11.\n\nCollision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=10, after y=5, go U to y_{11}=6, but t=11 y=6 unsafe.\n\nProblem with t=11 for y=5,6,7.\n\ny=5 at t=11 unsafe, y=6 at t=11 unsafe, y=7 at t=11 unsafe.\n\nOnly y=8 safe at t=11.\n\nBut I need to be on lower y first.\n\nTo avoid being on y=5,6,7 at t=11.\n\nSince I have one stay, I can be on a safe y at t=11.\n\nFor example, at t=11, if I am on y=4 or y=8 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=4 safe, y=8 safe.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to reach y=9 at t=13 for H=6.\n\ny_{13}=9.\n\nNow, let's list the turns from t=7 to t=13.\n\nI need y_7=4\n\ny_{13}=9\n\nWith 5U and 1S.\n\nThe S can be at different points.\n\nSuppose I stay at t=7: a_7=S, y_8=4\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=5\n\na_9=U, y_{10}=6\n\nNow at t=10, y=6, safe.\n\nInstead of going U, I go S: a_{10}=S, y_{11}=6\n\nBut at t=11, y=6, unsafe, collision.\n\na_{10}=D, y_{11}=5, at t=11 y=5 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom t=10 y=6, I have to go U or something, but then y_{11}=7 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be at a higher y at t=11.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 at t=11.\n\nBut from t=10, I am at y=6, I need to go up to y=8, but it takes two steps, so at t=11 y=7, which is bad.\n\nUnless I am at y=7 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, if I am at y=7, then it is safe, since t=10 safe for y=7.\n\nThen at t=10, y=7, safe, then I can go U to y_{11}=8, at t=11 y=8, safe, since y=8 always safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut how to be at y=7 at t=10.\n\nFrom start.\n\nAt t=7, y=4.\n\nIf I go U at t=7, a_7=U, y_8=5, but t=8 y=5 unsafe, collision. Cannot.\n\nSo must not go U at t=7.\n\na_7 must be S or D.\n\nD worse, so S.\n\na_7=S, y_8=4\n\nThen at t=8, y=4, a_8=U, y_9=5\n\nAt t=9, y=5, a_9=U, y_{10}=6\n\nAt t=10, y=6, now to be at y=7 at t=10, I need y_{10}=7, but from y_9=5, y_{10}=6, so at t=10 I am at y=6, not 7.\n\nI can go U at t=9 to y_{10}=6, but that's where I am.\n\nTo have y_{10}=7, I need from y_9=6, but at t=9 I have y=5.\n\nSo I need to be at y=6 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am at y=6, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 6 at t=9.\n\nt=9, Δt=2, freeway 6 safe, as not unsafe at t=9.\n\nUnsafe only t=8 and t=11.\n\nt=9 safe.\n\nSo possible to be at y=6 at t=9.\n\nHow?\n\nAt t=7, y=4, a_7=U? But if a_7=U, y_8=5, t=8 unsafe, collision.

No, in this sequence I have only 3U so far, but I have actions up to a_13 for y_14.\n\nLet's count the actions.\n\nActions from t=7 to t=13 for y_14.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\na_7=S (action 1)\n\na_8=S (action 2)\n\na_9=S (action 3) y_10=4\n\na_10=S (action 4) y_11=4\n\na_11=U (action 5) y_12=5\n\na_12=U (action 6) y_13=6\n\na_13=U (action 7) y_14=7\n\nBut y_14=7, not 9. I need y_14=9, so I need more U.\n\nWith 7 actions, I have only 3U, net +3, y_14=4+3=7.\n\nTo have net +5, I need 5U, so I must have fewer S.\n\nFor example, with U=5, S=2, D=0.\n\nStart a_7=S, y_8=4\n\na_8=S, y_9=4\n\na_9=U, y_10=5\n\na_10=U, y_11=6 -- but at t=11 y=6 unsafe\n\nNot.\n\na_9=U, y_10=5\n\na_10=U, y_11=6, collision.\n\nAfter a_8=S, y_9=4, a_9=U, y_10=5, then a_10=S, y_11=5, at t=11 y=5 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo it seems impossible to avoid the collision at t=11 if I am on the freeway.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7 at t=11, it is occupied, but let's double-check the car positions.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=11, Δt=4 from t1=7.\n\nCars on freeway 7: same as freeway 5, car D at Δt=4: for car D, L_D= -59 +12*4= -59+48= -11, R_D= -48+48=0, so [-11,0], 0 included, so yes, occupied at t=11.\n\nSimilarly for car E at Δt=1, but at t=11 Δt=4, car E not at 0.\n\nSo yes, occupied.\n\nSo to avoid, I must not be on y=5,6,7 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=5 at t=8.\n\nNow, for the path, I can be on y=8 at t=11.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at t=11, from y=4 at t=7, it takes 4 steps with all U, but t=8 y=5 bad.\n\nSo I need to take a detour or something.\n\nPerhaps go down to y=3 or 2 at some point to waste time.\n\nFor example, at t=7, go D to y=3, then from there go up.\n\nBut let's try.\n\nH=6 might be possible with going down.\n\nBut earlier for H=6, I must have 5U and 1S, no D.\n\nFor H=6, U_num - D_num =5, H=6, so 6 = 5 + 2 D_num + S_num, so 2 D_num + S_num =1, so D_num=0, S_num=1, no D.\n\nSo cannot go down.\n\nFor H=7, I can have D.\n\nWith U=6, D=1, S=0, net +5.\n\nFor example, a_7=D, y_8=3\n\nAt t=8, y=3, freeway 3, always safe, so safe.\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=4\n\na_9=U, y_10=5\n\na_10=U, y_11=6\n\nAt t=11, y=6, unsafe, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\na_10=S, y_11=5, at t=11 y=5 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\na_10=U, y_11=6, collision.\n\nSo still at t=11 bad.\n\nAfter y_10=5, if I go D, a_10=D, y_11=4, at t=11 y=4 safe.\n\nThen a_11=U, y_12=5\n\nAt t=12, y=5, safe (t=12 not unsafe)\n\nThen a_12=U, y_13=6\n\na_13=U, y_14=7\n\nBut for H=7, y_14=7, not 9.\n\nWith U=6,D=1, net +5, but in this case actions a_7 to a_13, 7 actions.\n\ny_7=4\n\na_7=D, y_8=3\n\na_8=U, y_9=4\n\na_9=U, y_10=5\n\na_10=D, y_11=4\n\na_11=U, y_12=5\n\na_12=U, y_13=6\n\na_13=U, y_14=7\n\ny_14=7, not 9. Net +3, because two D and three U from a_8 to a_13, but a_7=D, so net U_num=5? a_7=D, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=D, a_11=U, a_12=U, a_13=U, so U actions: a8,U; a9,U; a11,U; a12,U; a13,U; 5U, D actions: a7,D; a10,D; 2D, so net U-D=5-2=3, y_14=4+3=7.\n\nTo have net +5, I need U_num - D_num =5.\n\nWith U=6,D=1, net+5.\n\nSo for example, a_7=U, not possible.\n\na_7=S, but S not in this case, S=0 for U=6,D=1.\n\nSo a_7 must be U or D.\n\nU not possible, so a_7=D, y_8=3\n\nThen to have net +5, I need more U.\n\na_8=U, y_9=4\n\na_9=U, y_10=5\n\na_10=U, y_11=6\n\na_11=U, y_12=7\n\na_12=U, y_13=8\n\na_13=U, y_14=9\n\nActions: a7 to a13, 7 actions.\n\na7=D, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U\n\nU_num=6, D_num=1, net +5, y_14=4+5=9.\n\nNow, check collision.\n\nt=7: y=4, safe\n\na7=D, so after action, y8=3\n\nt=8: y=3, freeway 3, always safe, so safe.\n\na8=U, y9=4\n\nt=9: y=4, safe\n\na9=U, y10=5\n\nt=10: y=5, freeway 5 at t=10, Δt=3, safe (not t=8 or t=11)\n\na10=U, y11=6\n\nt=11: y=6, freeway 6 at t=11, unsafe! Occupied, collision.\n\nAgain at t=11.\n\nTo avoid, at t=10, when y=5, instead of going U, I can go S or D.\n\nIf a10=S, y11=5, at t=11 y=5 unsafe.\n\nIf a10=D, y11=4, at t=11 y=4 safe.\n\nThen a11=U, y12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, safe (t=12)\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, freeway 6 at t=13, Δt=6, safe\n\na13=U, y14=7, but y14=7, not 9. I need to go to y=9.\n\ny14=7, then I need another action, but for H=7, only 7 actions, y14 position.\n\nAfter 7 actions, at turn t=14, position y14.\n\nWith the actions above, after a13, y14=7.\n\nTo reach y14=9, I need two more U, but no more actions.\n\nWith the current actions, net +3, as before.\n\nWith U=6,D=1, net+5, but in the sequence where I go down at t=10, I have only 5U and 2D? Let's list.\n\nIn the successful avoidance:\n\nt=7: y=4, a7=D, y8=3\n\nt=8: y=3, a8=U, y9=4\n\nt=9: y=4, a9=U, y10=5\n\nt=10: y=5, a10=D, y11=4  -- D action\n\nt=11: y=4, safe\n\na11=U, y12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, safe\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, safe\n\na13=U, y14=7\n\ny14=7, net +3 from start.\n\nActions: a7=D, a8=U, a9=U, a10=D, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, so U: a8,a9,a11,a12,a13: 5U, D: a7,a10: 2D, net U-D=5-2=3, y14=4+3=7.\n\nTo have net+5, I need U_num=6, D_num=1, so only one D.\n\nFor example, a7=D, y8=3\n\nThen a8=U, y9=4\n\na9=U, y10=5\n\na10=U, y11=6\n\na11=U, y12=7\n\na12=U, y13=8\n\na13=U, y14=9\n\nBut at t=11 y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf I have the D later, but I have only one D.\n\na7=U, not possible.\n\nSo it seems I cannot avoid the collision at t=11 for the middle freeways.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6 at t=11 it is occupied, but let's confirm the car.\n\nFreeway 6 at t=11, Δt=4, car D: for car D, on freeway 5,6,7, at Δt=4, L_D= -59 +48= -11, R_D= -48+48=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nYes.\n\nBut the player is on y=6 at t=11, and freeway 6 has cars, so collision.\n\nUnless I am not on the freeway at that time.\n\nBut I need to cross.\n\nPerhaps I can cross y=6 at a different time.\n\nFor example, at t=10 or t=12.\n\nIn the direct path, I am at y=6 at t=9 for H=5, but t=9 is safe for y=6.\n\nBut in H=5, I have collision at t=8.\n\nWith H=6, I can be at y=6 at t=10 or t=12.\n\nFor example, in the sequence where I stay at t=7: a7=S, y8=4\n\na8=U, y9=5\n\na9=U, y10=6\n\nt=10: y=6, safe\n\nThen I need to go to y=7, but at t=11 if I go U, y11=7, unsafe.\n\nBut if I go U at t=10 to y11=7, t=11 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=10, I can do S, but then t=11 y=6 unsafe.\n\nOr do D to y11=5, t=11 y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo the only way is to not be on y=6 at t=10 if I can't avoid t=11.\n\nBut at t=10, I can be on y=6 and then move to y=7 at t=11, but t=11 y=7 bad.\n\nI think I have to accept that for t=11, I must be on a safe y, like y=8.\n\nBut I can't reach it in time.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 8 or something, but let's assume that for this state, it is possible with H=6 by choosing the right sequence.\n\nAnother idea: at t=7, go U to y8=5, but t=8 y=5 unsafe, so I must not.\n\nUnless for freeway 5 at t=8 it is not occupied, but it is.\n\nPerhaps the cars are on different freeways, but for y=5, at t=8, it is occupied.\n\nLet's list the span at t=8 for freeway 5.\n\nAt t=8, Δt=1, car E: L_E= -23+12= -11, R_E= -12+12=0, [-11,0], 0 included, yes.\n\nSo occupied.\n\nSo I think I need to use the fact that I can move down to y=0 or something, but it wastes turns.\n\nFor example, with H=6, I can't have D, so not possible.\n\nWith H=7, I can have a detour.\n\nLet's try to reach y=9 with H=7.\n\nU=5, S=2, D=0.\n\nSequence:\n\na7=S, y8=4\n\na8=U, y9=5\n\na9=S, y10=5  -- stay at y=5 at t=10, safe\n\nThen a10=U, y11=6 -- but at t=11 y=6 unsafe\n\nCollision.\n\na10=S, y11=5, unsafe at t=11.\n\na10=U, same.\n\nNot.\n\nAfter a9=S, y10=5, I can go D to y11=4, a10=D, y11=4, at t=11 y=4 safe.\n\nThen a11=U, y12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, safe\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, safe\n\na13=U, y14=7\n\ny14=7, not 9.\n\nNet only +3.\n\nTo have more U, I need to have fewer S.\n\nBut with U=5, I have to have the S somewhere.\n\nStart with a7=U, not possible.\n\nI think I found a way.\n\nAt t=7, y=4, a7=S, y8=4\n\nt=8: y=4, a8=U, y9=5\n\nt=9: y=5, a9=U, y10=6\n\nt=10: y=6, now to avoid t=11, a10=D, y11=5, but t=11 y=5 unsafe, collision.\n\nNo.\n\n a10=U, y11=7, t=11 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe move at t=10 from y=6 is to go to y=5 or 6 or 7, all bad at t=11, or to go down to y=5, but bad.\n\nUnless I go down to y=4, but then I waste.\n\nBut for H=7, I can do that and still reach.\n\nFor example:\n\na7=S, y8=4\n\na8=U, y9=5\n\na9=U, y10=6\n\na10=D, y11=5 -- but t=11 y=5 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot.\n\na10=D to y11=5, collision immediately.\n\nI think I have to give up and assume that for this configuration, the minimal H is larger, but let's look for a sequence that works.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7 at t=11 it is occupied, but if I am on y=7 at t=12, safe.\n\nSo let's go for y=9 at t=14 with y12=7.\n\nFrom earlier, with U=4,D=1,S=0 for net+3 to y12=7.\n\nBut U=4,D=1,S=0.\n\na7=D, y8=3\n\nt=8: y=3, safe\n\na8=U, y9=4\n\nt=9: y=4, safe\n\na9=U, y10=5\n\nt=10: y=5, safe\n\na10=U, y11=6\n\nt=11: y=6, unsafe, collision.\n\nSame.\n\nWith U=3,S=2,D=0 for net+3 to y12=7.\n\na7=S, y8=4\n\na8=S, y9=4\n\na9=U, y10=5\n\na10=U, y11=6\n\na11=U, y12=7 -- at t=11 y=6 unsafe\n\nCollision at t=11.\n\nUnless I have a10 such that I am not on y=6 at t=11.\n\nFor example, at t=10, y=5, a10=S, y11=5, at t=11 y=5 unsafe.\n\na10=U, y11=6, unsafe.\n\na10=D, y11=4, then at t=11 y=4 safe, but y12=4 or 5, not 7.\n\nThen to y12=7, not possible with the actions.\n\nI think I need to include the action in the turn.\n\nPerhaps the only way is to be on y=8 at t=11.\n\nBut impossible from start.\n\nSo for this state, the minimal H might be 8, but let's assume that the player can wait at y=4 until the bad times pass.\n\nFor example, at t=11, y=5,6,7 are bad, so after t=11, they are safe.\n\nSo at t=12, all safe.\n\nSo I can start moving after t=11.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=4, do nothing for a few turns.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should go as soon as possible.\n\nFirst, at t=7, y=4, safe.\n\nt=8, y=4, safe.\n\nt=9, y=4, safe.\n\nt=10, y=4, safe.\n\nt=11, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=11, I can go U to y12=5.\n\nt=12: y=5, safe.\n\nThen U to y13=6, t=13: y=6, safe.\n\nU to y14=7, t=14: y=7, safe.\n\nU to y15=8, t=15: y=8, safe.\n\nU to y16=9, t=16: y=9, done.\n\nBut this takes many turns, H=9 actions from t=7 to t=15 for y16=9.\n\ny7=4, after 9 actions, y16=9.\n\nBut minimal should be less.\n\nFrom t=7 to t=11, 5 turns at y=4, then 5 steps to y=9, so at t=16 y=9, 9 actions.\n\nBut with actions, from t=7 to t=15, 9 actions for y16=9.\n\nBut earlier with H=5, almost worked but for t=8.\n\nSince t=8 and t=11 are bad, I can move between.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=4, safe.\n\nGo U at t=7? Cannot.\n\nAt t=7, S, y8=4\n\nAt t=8, U, y9=5\n\nt=9, y=5, safe, go U, y10=6\n\nt=10, y=6, safe, now at t=10, I can stay or go.\n\nBut at t=11, if I go U to y11=7, bad.\n\nSo at t=10, go S, but then t=11 y=6 bad.\n\nOr go D to y11=5, bad.\n\nSo at t=10, I must go to a safe y for t=11, like y=4 or y=8.\n\nFrom y=6, I can go D to y=5, but not to y=4 in one step.\n\nGo D to y=5, then at t=11 y=5 bad.\n\nGo U to y=7, bad.\n\nSo no, I have to go down two steps or something, but not possible in one action.\n\nSo I think for this case, the minimal way is to wait at y=4 until after t=11, then go up.\n\nSo at t=7 to t=11, stay at y=4.\n\nActions: a7=S, a8=S, a9=S, a10=S, a11=S, so y8=4, y9=4, y10=4, y11=4, y12=4\n\nThen at t=12, y=4, a12=U, y13=5\n\nt=13: y=5, safe (t=13)\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\nt=14: y=6, safe\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\nt=15: y=7, safe\n\na15=U, y16=8\n\nt=16: y=8, safe\n\na16=U, y17=9\n\nt=17: y=9, done.\n\nH=10 actions, from t=7 to t=16, for y17=9.\n\nBut this is long.\n\nFrom t=12, y=4, I can go up faster, but I need to go through each level.\n\nMinimal steps is 5 up, but with waiting.\n\nSince after t=11, all freeways are safe, I can go up each turn from t=11.\n\nAt t=11, y=4, a11=U, y12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, a12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, a13=U, y14=7\n\nt=14: y=7, a14=U, y15=8\n\nt=15: y=8, a15=U, y16=9\n\nSo from t=11 to t=16, 5 actions to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\nBut at t=11, I am at y=4, which required waiting from t=7 to t=11.\n\nFrom t=7 to t=11, 5 turns at y=4, with actions a7 to a11 all S, so y position from t=7 to t=11 all 4.\n\nThen from t=11, start moving.\n\nActions:\na7=S\na8=S\na9=S\na10=S\na11=U  -- to y12=5\na12=U  -- to y13=6\na13=U  -- to y14=7\na14=U  -- to y15=8\na15=U  -- to y16=9\n\nSo actions from t=7 to t=15, 9 actions, y at t=16=9.\n\nH=9 turns of actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can start moving earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=7, I can go to y=5 at t=9 or something.\n\nBut at t=8, y=5 is bad, so I can be at y=5 at t=9.\n\nFrom t=7, a7=S, y8=4\n\na8=U, y9=5\n\nt=9: y=5, safe\n\nThen I can go to y=6 at t=10, a9=U, y10=6\n\nt=10: y=6, safe\n\nNow at t=10, I need to avoid being on middle at t=11.\n\nSo at t=10, go D to y11=5, but t=11 y=5 bad.\n\nGo U to y11=7, bad.\n\nGo S to y11=6, bad.\n\nSo I must go down to y=4 or up to y=7, but not possible.\n\nSo the only safe way is to be on y=4 or y=8 at t=11.\n\nSo at t=10, I must be on y=4 or y=5 or y=6 or y=7, and from there, to be on safe at t=11, I can only go to y=4 if on y=4 or 5, or to y=8 if on y=7 or 8.\n\nFrom y=6, I can only go to y=5,6,7, all bad at t=11.\n\nSo if I am on y=6 at t=10, I cannot avoid being on bad y at t=11.\n\nSimilarly for y=5 or 7 at t=10, I can go to y=4 or y=8, but from y=5 to y=4, or from y=7 to y=8.\n\nFor example, at t=10, if on y=5, a10=D, y11=4, safe at t=11.\n\nOr if on y=7, a10=U, y11=8, safe.\n\nBut in our case, at t=10, I am on y=6, not 5 or 7.\n\nSo to have at t=10 on y=5 or y=7.\n\nFor example, on y=5 at t=10.\n\nFrom start, a7=S, y8=4\n\na8=U, y9=5\n\na9=S, y10=5  -- on y=5 at t=10\n\nThen a10=D, y11=4, at t=11 y=4 safe.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\na11=U, y12=5\n\nt=12: y=5, safe\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\nt=13: y=6, safe\n\na13=U, y14=7\n\nt=14: y=7, safe\n\na14=U, y15=8\n\nt=15: y=8, safe\n\na15=U, y16=9\n\nt=16: y=9, done.\n\nActions from t=7 to t=15, 9 actions.\n\nH=9.\n\nOr on y=7 at t=10.\n\nHow to reach y=7 at t=10.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=7, to y_10=7, net +3 in 3 actions, must be 3U, y8=5, but t=8 y=5 unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTherefore, the best is to be on y=5 at t=10 with a stay, then go down to y=4 at t=11, safe, then go up.\n\nBut this takes many turns.\n\nFor minimal H, with this path, H=9.\n\nBut perhaps there is a shorter way.\n\nNotice that at t=9, y=1 and 2 are unsafe, but I don't care.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=8 directly if possible, but no.\n\nOr since freeway 3 and 4 are always safe, I can stay on them, but I need to go to y=9.\n\nI think for this specific setup, the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let's confirm if with H=6 it is possible with a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 and up, but y=0 is safe, but it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, a7=D, y8=3\n\nt=8: y=3, safe\n\na8=D, y9=2\n\nt=9: y=2, freeway 2 unsafe at t=9, because freeway 2 occupied at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=9, freeway 2 unsafe, so if on y=2 at t=9, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\na8=U, back to y=4, waste.\n\nI think I should accept the sequence with H=9.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps for this state, it is possible to reach in less by using the fact that at some turns, the freeway is safe.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=4, safe.\n\nIf I could be at y=5 at t=7, but I am at y=4.\n\nAt t=7, y=4.\n\nAt t=12, all freeways are safe, so I can go from y=4 to y=9 in 5 turns from t=12 to t=17.\n\nBut with waiting from t=7 to t=11 at y=4.\n\nSo minimal actions are 5 actions for moving up, plus 5 actions for waiting from t=7 to t=11, but the waiting actions are at the beginning.\n\nIn terms of number of turns, from start turn t=7 to reach y=9 at turn T, with T-7 turns of actions.\n\nWith 5 wait and 5 move, T=7+10=17, 10 actions.\n\nWith the sequence where I go to y=5 at t=9, then to y=6 at t=10, then down to y=4 at t=11, then up, that's more.\n\nIn the first sequence with waiting, 5 S from t=7 to t=11, then 5 U to t=16, y17=9, 10 actions.\n\nIn the other sequence: a7=S, y8=4\n\na8=U, y9=5\n\na9=S, y10=5\n\na10=D, y11=4  -- down to avoid\n\na11=U, y12=5\n\na12=U, y13=6\n\na13=U, y14=7\n\na14=U, y15=8\n\na15=U, y16=9\n\nStill 9 actions, y16=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut at t=16 y=9.\n\nTurn t=16.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=11, I can go up faster, but I need to go through each, 5 steps.\n\nUnless I can skip, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo minimal H is 9 actions.\n\nBut for the answer, perhaps I should box the sequence.\n\nBut let's see if there is a way with H=6 or 7.\n\nPerhaps I missed that for freeway 5 at t=8 it is occupied, but if I am not on it, fine.\n\nBut in the direct path, I am on it.\n\nOr perhaps stay at t=7, then at t=8 go U to y9=5, safe at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, go U to y10=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, go U to y11=7, but unsafe at t=11.\n\nIf at t=10, I go U to y11=7, and if the collision is only if I am on it, but at t=11 it is unsafe, so collision.\n\nSo I think it's impossible with less than 9 actions.\n\nPerhaps the initial position at t=7 is safe, and I can move later.\n\nAnother thought: the goal is to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no collision there.\n\nBut I need to be on freeways during the path.\n\nI think for this case, the minimal sequence is to wait until after the bad times.\n\nSo for minimal H, H=9 actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: S  ( a7=S )\n\nTurn t_1 +1: S  ( a8=S )\n\nTurn t_1 +2: S  ( a9=S )\n\nTurn t_1 +3: S  ( a10=S )\n\nTurn t_1 +4: S  ( a11=S ) -- now at t=12, y=4\n\nBetter to start moving at t=11.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 7: S  (a7, to y8=4)\n\nTurn 8: S  (a8, to y9=4)\n\nTurn 9: S  (a9, to y10=4)\n\nTurn 10: S  (a10, to y11=4)\n\nTurn 11: U  (a11, to y12=5)\n\nTurn 12: U  (a12, to y13=6)\n\nTurn 13: U  (a13, to y14=7)\n\nTurn 14: U  (a14, to y15=8)\n\nTurn 15: U  (a15, to y16=9)\n\nSo at turn 16, y=9.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=7 to t=15 for y at t=8 to t=16.\n\ny at turn t.\n\nAt turn 7, y=4.\n\nAfter a7=S, at turn 8, y=4.\n\nAfter a8=S, turn 9, y=4.\n\n...\nAfter a11=U, turn 12, y=5.\n\nAfter a12=U, turn 13, y=6.\n\nAfter a13=U, turn 14, y=7.\n\nAfter a14=U, turn 15, y=8.\n\nAfter a15=U, turn 16, y=9.\n\nSo reached at turn 16.\n\nNumber of actions H=9.\n\nBut to write the answer.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving at turn 8 or something, but to avoid t=8 and t=11, I need to be careful.\n\nFor example, at turn 7, y=4, a7=S, turn 8 y=4.\n\nThen at turn 8, a8=U, turn 9 y=5 (safe)\n\nThen at turn 9, a9=U, turn 10 y=6 (safe)\n\nThen at turn 10, a10=S, but then turn 11 y=6 unsafe.\n\nNot.\n\nSo the safe way is to stay below until after t=11.\n\nSo I think H=9 is the minimal for this case.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAnd at turn 16, y=9.\n\nBut H=9 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nt_1=7, H=9, actions from t=7 to t=15.\n\nThen the position at turn t_1+H =7+9=16, y=9.\n\nSo for the box.\n\nBut let's write.\n\nOr perhaps there is a shorter way.\n\nNotice that at turn 7, I am at y=4, and I can go to y=5 at turn 9, safe, then to y=6 at turn 10, safe, then at turn 10, instead of staying, I can go down to y=5, but then at turn 11 y=5 unsafe.\n\nUnless I go down to y=4 at turn 11 from y=5 at turn 10.\n\na10=D, turn 11 y=4, safe.\n\nThen from turn 11 y=4, go up to y=5 at turn 12, etc.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 7: S (y8=4)\n\nTurn 8: U (y9=5)\n\nTurn 9: U (y10=6)\n\nTurn 10: D (y11=4)  -- down to avoid\n\nTurn 11: U (y12=5)\n\nTurn 12: U (y13=6)\n\nTurn 13: U (y14=7)\n\nTurn 14: U (y15=8)\n\nTurn 15: U (y16=9)\n\nActions from turn 7 to turn 15, 9 actions, same as before.\n\nH=9.\n\nAt turn 10, I have a D action, which is allowed since for H=9, I can have D.\n\nNet U-D=5, with 9 actions.\n\nIn this case, U: turn8,9,11,12,13,14,15: 7U?

Freeway 5 at t=11 occupied.\n\nCollision at t=11.\n\nI forgot.\n\nAt turn 11, y=5, freeway 5 occupied at t=11, collision.\n\nSo still not.\n\nIn this case, at t=11, y=5, bad.\n\nSo to avoid, at t=11, I need to be on y=4 or lower or y=8.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=11, y=5, which is bad.\n\nSo the only way is to be on y=4 at t=11.\n\nFor example, from t=10, if on y=6, go D to y=5, not to y=4.\n\nSo I need to be on y=5 at t=10, then go D to y=4 at t=11.\n\nOr on y=4 at t=10, stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=10, I am on y=6.\n\nTo be on y=5 at t=10, I can have a9=S or something.\n\nLet's set:\n\na7=S, turn 8: y=4\n\na8=U, turn 9: y=5\n\na9=S, turn 10: y=5  -- on y=5 at t=10\n\nThen a10=D, turn 11: y=4  -- down to y=4, safe at t=11\n\nThen a11=U, turn 12: y=5\n\na12=U, turn 13: y=6\n\na13=U, turn 14: y=7\n\na14=U, turn 15: y=8\n\na15=U, turn 16: y=9\n\nActions from t=7 to t=15, 9 actions, H=9.\n\nSame as first.\n\nSo I think H=9 is the minimal for this case.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll use the sequence with 5 S then 5 U, but with the actions.\n\nSince the player position at turn t is given, and we need to reach at some turn.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAnd at turn 16, y=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut to write.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving at turn 8.\n\nBut turn 8 y=5 is bad if I go U at turn 7.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think this is it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 9. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at the safe position \\(y = 4\\) until after the unsafe turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 11\\), when freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) are occupied.\n\n- At turns \\(t = 7\\) to \\(t = 10\\), the player stays at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, always safe) to avoid being on freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 11\\).\n- From turn \\(t = 11\\) onwards, the player moves up one step per turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn \\(t = 16\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- Turn 7: Stay (S), resulting in \\(y_8 = 4\\)\n- Turn 8: Stay (S), resulting in \\(y_9 = 4\\)\n- Turn 9: Stay (S), resulting in \\(y_{10} = 4\\)\n- Turn 10: Stay (S), resulting in \\(y_{11} = 4\\)\n- Turn 11: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{12} = 5\\)\n- Turn 12: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{13} = 6\\)\n- Turn 13: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{14} = 7\\)\n- Turn 14: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{15} = 8\\)\n- Turn 15: Up (U), resulting in \\(y_{16} = 9\\)\n\nAt turn \\(t = 16\\), the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) with no collisions, as:\n- Turns \\(t = 7\\) to \\(t = 11\\): Player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, always safe).\n- Turn \\(t = 12\\): Player is at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe at \\(t = 12\\) since unsafe only at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 11\\)).\n- Turn \\(t = 13\\): Player is at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe at \\(t = 13\\) since unsafe only at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 11\\)).\n- Turn \\(t = 14\\): Player is at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe at \\(t = 14\\) since unsafe only at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 11\\)).\n- Turn \\(t = 15\\): Player is at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, always safe).\n- Turn \\(t = 16\\): Player is at \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway, safe).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 9, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Each car has a head and tail, and they move left or right at a given speed. The direction is given: \"right\" means they're moving to the right, so for right-moving cars, the span increases as time goes on because h and τ both increase.\n\nLet me denote the span for a car at time T as [left_end, right_end] for simplicity, but from the update:\n\nFor left-moving: at T, span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's left-moving, h and τ are decreasing, so the left end is h - s(T-t_1) and right end is τ - s(T-t_1), but since it's moving left, if head was at h at t_1, after time, it moves left, so head position decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, and it says head and tail, but in the span, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], but h is head, τ is tail, and since it's left-moving, head should be on the left, I think? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t_1\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify which one is left or right. But in the span, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h].\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, I think.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is left, τ is right? But it says \"head\" and \"tail\", which might imply direction.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should think in terms of the position at time T.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is at (0, y_T) and for any car on freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of that car at time T.\n\nThe player position at turn T is (0, y_T), and they are on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nThe action a_t is taken at turn t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's see the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and a_t is action at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, you are at y_t, you choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen at turn t+1, you are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if, for the position y_T, there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nSpan(T) is the position interval at time T.\n\nNow, the cars are given at turn t_1=9.\n\nFor each freeway, there are cars listed.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nBut for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so for first car: τ = -59, h = -48, so Span(9) = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ = -11, h = 0, so Span(9) = [-11, 0]\n\nNow, collision at time T if 0 is in Span(T) for some car on the freeway you are on.\n\nAt time T, for a car, Span(T) depends on the movement.\n\nSince all cars here are right-moving, except I need to check all.\n\nFreeway 1: both right-moving, speed 6.\n\nFirst car: at t_1=9, Span = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time T, since right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [-59 + 6(T-9), -48 + 6(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: Span(9) = [-11, 0], so Span(T) = [-11 + 6(T-9), 0 + 6(T-9)] = [-11 + 6(T-9), 6(T-9)]\n\nNow, 0 is in Span(T) if the interval covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut let's list all freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says \" | 2 | \\((-48, -59, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6)\\) | \"\n\nIdentical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: \" | 3 | \\((-48, -95, right, 48)\\) \"\n\nSo one car: h=-48, τ=-95, direction right, speed 48.\n\nRight-moving, so Span(9) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nThen Span(T) = [-95 + 48(T-9), -48 + 48(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \" | 4 | \\((-48, -95, right, 48)\\) \" yes.\n\nFreeway 5: \" | 5 | \\((-48, -59, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\\) \"\n\nThree cars.\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, right, s=12, Span(9) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSpan(T) = [-59 + 12(T-9), -48 + 12(T-9)]\n\nSecond car: h=-12, τ=-23, right, s=12, Span(9) = [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nSpan(T) = [-23 + 12(T-9), -12 + 12(T-9)]\n\nThird car: h=24, τ=13, right, s=12, Span(9) = [τ, h] = [13, 24]\n\nSpan(T) = [13 + 12(T-9), 24 + 12(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? \" | 6 | \\((-48, -59, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\\) \" yes.\n\nFreeway 7: same? \" | 7 | \\((-48, -59, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\\) \" yes.\n\nFreeway 8: \" | 8 | \\((-48, -95, right, 48)\\) \" same as freeway 3 and 4.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn t=9. But y=0 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to y=8. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars.\n\nThe grid is from y=0 to y=9, vertical axis, and freeways with cars are y=1 to y=8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision there.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is safe.\n\nNow, at turn 9, player is at (0,0).\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action U, D, S changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nSince we start at 0 and want to go to 9, we need to increase y, so probably mostly U actions, but we have to avoid cars when on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be at least 9, since we need to go from 0 to 9, each U increases by 1, so min H is 9 if no cars, but with cars, we might need to stay or go down sometimes to avoid, which would increase H.\n\nBut going down might not help, since we need to go up eventually, so probably minimal is 9 if possible, or more.\n\nFirst, let's find when each freeway is dangerous, i.e., when there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nFor a given freeway k and time T, collision if 0 is in Span(T) for some car on k.\n\nSince we are at (0, y_T) at turn T, and if y_T = k between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of a car on k at T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's find for which T it is dangerous.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: Span(T) = [-59 + 6(T-9), -48 + 6(T-9)]\n\n0 is in this interval if -59 + 6(T-9) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6(T-9)\n\nSimilarly, second car: Span(T) = [-11 + 6(T-9), 6(T-9)]\n\n0 is in this if -11 + 6(T-9) ≤ 0 ≤ 6(T-9)\n\nNow, let u = T - 9, time offset from now.\n\nSo for first car on fw1: -59 + 6u ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 6u\n\nSo -59 + 6u ≤ 0 => 6u ≤ 59 => u ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48 + 6u => 6u ≥ 48 => u ≥ 8\n\nSo for u between 8 and 9.833, but u integer since turns, T integer, u integer.\n\nu = T - 9, integer.\n\nSo u ≥ 8 and u ≤ 9, since u ≤ 9.833, so u=8,9\n\nSimilarly, second car: -11 + 6u ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 6u\n\n-11 + 6u ≤ 0 => 6u ≤ 11 => u ≤ 11/6 ≈ 1.833\n\n0 ≤ 6u => u ≥ 0\n\nSo u between 0 and 1.833, so u=0,1\n\nNow, for freeway 1, collision at T if either car has 0 in span.\n\nAt u=0 (T=9), second car has span [-11,0], so 0 is included, since it ends at 0? Span(T) = [-11 +6u, 6u]\n\nAt u=0, T=9, span = [-11, 0], so 0 is in [ -11, 0], yes, includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, at u=1, T=10, span = [-11+6, 6] = [-5,6], 0 is in it.\n\nAt u=2, span = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, first car at u=8, T=17, span = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nu=9, T=18, span = [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nu=10, span = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, dangerous at T=9,10,17,18 from the cars.\n\nT=9 and 10 from second car, T=17 and 18 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 2 is same as freeway 1, so same dangerous times: T=9,10,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 3: one car, (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nSpan(9) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nSpan(T) = [-95 +48(u), -48 +48(u)] where u=T-9\n\n0 in span if -95 +48u ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 +48u\n\nSo -95 +48u ≤ 0 => 48u ≤ 95 => u ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\n0 ≤ -48 +48u => 48u ≥ 48 => u ≥ 1\n\nSo u=1, since u integer, u=1 only? u≥1 and u≤1.979, so u=1\n\nAt u=1, span = [-95+48, -48+48] = [-47,0], 0 is in? -47 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 included.\n\nAt u=0, span = [-95,-48], 0 not in.\n\nu=2, span = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=10 (u=1) for freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same, so dangerous only at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: Span(T) = [-59 +12u, -48 +12u]\n\n0 in if -59+12u ≤ 0 ≤ -48+12u\n\n-59+12u ≤ 0 => 12u ≤59 => u ≤ 59/12 ≈4.916\n\n0 ≤ -48+12u => 12u ≥48 => u≥4\n\nSo u=4 (since u integer)\n\nu=4: T=13\n\nspan = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nu=5: span = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: Span(T) = [-23 +12u, -12 +12u]\n\n0 in if -23+12u ≤ 0 ≤ -12+12u\n\n-23+12u ≤0 => 12u ≤23 => u ≤ 23/12 ≈1.916\n\n0 ≤ -12+12u => 12u ≥12 => u≥1\n\nSo u=1\n\nu=1: T=10, span = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nThird car: Span(T) = [13 +12u, 24 +12u]\n\n0 in if 13+12u ≤ 0 ≤ 24+12u? But 13+12u >0 for u≥0, since min at u=0 is 13>0, so 0 never less than or equal to lower bound, so 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly, for u negative, but T≥t_1, u≥0, so no.\n\nSo for freeway 5, dangerous at T=10 (from second car) and T=13 (from first car)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 and 7 same as freeway 5, so dangerous at T=10 and T=13.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as 3, dangerous only at T=10.\n\nSummary of dangerous times per freeway:\n\n- Fw1: T=9,10,17,18\n\n- Fw2: same, T=9,10,17,18\n\n- Fw3: T=10\n\n- Fw4: T=10\n\n- Fw5: T=10,13\n\n- Fw6: T=10,13\n\n- Fw7: T=10,13\n\n- Fw8: T=10\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 9, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action U, D, or S, which sets y for next turn.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and y=0 is safe, no car.\n\nAt turn 9, we are at y=0.\n\nWe choose action a_9, which determines y_{10}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 10, we are at y_{10}, and so on.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if at that turn, y_T is between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_T, 0 is in some car's span at T.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence of actions from a_9 to a_{9+H-1} such that after H turns, we are at y_{9+H} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1+H-1, actions, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nStart at turn t_1=9, position (0, y_9) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_9, at turn 10, position (0, y_10)\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{9+H-1}, at turn 9+H, position (0, y_{9+H})\n\nWe want y_{9+H} =9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t=9 to t=9+H-1, so turns from 9 to 9+H-1 for actions, and position at turns 9 to 9+H.\n\nThe minimal H such that we reach y=9 at some turn T=9+H.\n\nSince we start at y=0, to reach y=9, we need at least 9 Up actions, but we can have S or D which don't increase, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut minimal H, so we want to use as many U as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, collisions happen only at specific times for each freeway.\n\nWe need to be on a freeway only when it is not dangerous, or if we are on it when dangerous, but 0 not in span, but from above, when dangerous, 0 is in span, so we must not be on that freeway at dangerous times.\n\nFor each freeway, at dangerous times, we must not be on that row.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous (freeway, time) pairs:\n\nFrom above:\n\n- At T=9: fw1 and fw2 dangerous\n\n- At T=10: all freeways dangerous? fw1, fw2, fw3, fw4, fw5, fw6, fw7, fw8 all have T=10 as dangerous.\n\nfw1: T=10 dangerous\n\nfw2: T=10\n\nfw3: T=10\n\nfw4: T=10\n\nfw5: T=10\n\nfw6: T=10\n\nfw7: T=10\n\nfw8: T=10\n\nAnd at T=9, only fw1 and fw2.\n\nT=13: fw5,6,7 dangerous.\n\nT=17: fw1,2\n\nT=18: fw1,2\n\nNow, at turn T=9, player is at y_9=0, which is safe.\n\nNow, we need to choose actions.\n\nThe action at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn 9, we choose a_9, which sets y_10.\n\nThen at turn 10, we are at y_10, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince all freeways are dangerous at T=10, we must not be on any freeway y=1 to 8 at T=10.\n\nThat means at turn 10, y_10 must be 0 or 9.\n\nBut y_10 is set by action from y_9=0.\n\ny_9=0, at turn 9.\n\na_9 can be U, D, or S.\n\nIf a_9 = U, then y_10 = y_9 +1 =1\n\nBut if y_10=1, at T=10, we are on freeway 1, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if a_9 = S, y_10 = y_9 +0 =0\n\nIf a_9 = D, y_10 = y_9 -1 = -1, but y must be in [0,9], so y_10 cannot be -1, so D is invalid at y=0.\n\nSo possible actions at y=0: U or S.\n\nIf U, y_10=1, but at T=10, y=1, and fw1 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf S, y_10=0, which is safe, since y=0 no cars.\n\nSo we must choose a_9 = S, so y_10=0.\n\nThen at turn 10, we are at y_10=0.\n\nNow, at turn 10, we choose a_10, which sets y_11.\n\nAt turn 10, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nBut T=10 is dangerous for all freeways, but we are at y=0, so no collision.\n\nNow, we need to go up.\n\nBut we can't go up immediately because at T=10, if we go to y=1, but we are at turn 10, position y_10=0.\n\nAction a_10 sets y_11.\n\nIf we set a_10=U, then y_11=1.\n\nBut at T=11, what is the situation?\n\nWe need to check if freeways are dangerous at T=11.\n\nFrom above, dangerous times are only at T=9,10,13,17,18 for some freeways.\n\nT=11 is not dangerous for any freeway, I think.\n\nFor example, fw1: dangerous at 9,10,17,18, not 11.\n\nSimilarly, fw2 same.\n\nFw3: only T=10\n\nFw4: only T=10\n\nFw5: T=10 and 13\n\nAt T=11, not 10 or 13, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo at T=11, all freeways are safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=12 should be safe.\n\nT=13: fw5,6,7 dangerous.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nFirst, at turn 10, y_10=0.\n\nWe can choose a_10.\n\nIf a_10=U, then y_11=1.\n\nAt T=11, we are on y=1, but fw1 is not dangerous at T=11, as above.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to other rows.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince T=11 and T=12 are safe for all, we can move up.\n\nBut at T=13, fw5,6,7 are dangerous, so we should not be on rows 5,6,7 at T=13.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nStart at turn 9: y_9=0\n\na_9 must be S, so y_10=0\n\nTurn 10: y_10=0\n\nNow, we can go up.\n\na_10: can be U, S, or D? D to y= -1 invalid, so U or S.\n\nIf S, y_11=0, stay, but we need to go up, so better to go U if possible.\n\na_10=U, then y_11=1\n\nAt turn 11: y_11=1\n\nNow, freeway 1 at T=11: not dangerous, so safe.\n\nNow, at turn 11, we choose a_11 to set y_12.\n\nWe can go up to y=2.\n\na_11=U, then y_12=2\n\nAt turn 12: y_12=2, fw2 at T=12: dangerous? fw2 dangerous only at T=9,10,17,18, not 12, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can keep going up.\n\nBut at T=13, we need to avoid rows 5,6,7.\n\nT=13 is turn 13.\n\nNow, let's see where we are at turn 13.\n\nWe start from turn 10: y=0\n\nTurn 11: y=1 (after a_10=U)\n\nTurn 12: y=2 (after a_11=U)\n\nNow turn 12, we choose a_12 to set y_13.\n\nWe want y_13 not in {5,6,7} because dangerous at T=13.\n\nCurrently y_12=2.\n\nIf a_12=U, y_13=3\n\nIf a_12=S, y_13=2\n\nIf a_12=D, y_13=1\n\ny_13=3 is not 5,6,7, so should be safe, since only 5,6,7 dangerous at T=13.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 or 1 also safe.\n\nBut we want to go up, so better to go to y=3.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=4, but at T=13, y=4 is not dangerous, only 5,6,7.\n\nAfter that, we need to reach y=9.\n\nBut there are later dangerous times: T=17 and 18 for fw1 and 2, which are rows 1 and 2.\n\nAt T=17 and 18, we should not be on row 1 or 2.\n\nNow, let's list the turns:\n\nTurn 9: y=0\n\nTurn 10: y=0 (after a_9=S)\n\nTurn 11: y=1 (after a_10=U)\n\nTurn 12: y=2 (after a_11=U)\n\nNow turn 12, a_12: let's set to U, so y_13=3\n\nTurn 13: y=3\n\nAt T=13, we are on y=3, which is freeway 3, not dangerous, since only fw5,6,7 dangerous.\n\nNow at turn 13, choose a_13 to set y_14.\n\nWe can go up.\n\na_13=U, y_14=4\n\nTurn 14: y=4\n\na_14=U, y_15=5\n\nBut at turn 15, y=5, and T=15.\n\nIs fw5 dangerous at T=15? From earlier, fw5 dangerous only at T=10 and 13, not 15, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can continue.\n\nBut we have to worry about T=17 and 18.\n\nFirst, let's go as far as we can.\n\nTurn 15: y=5, after a_14=U? Let's list:\n\nTurn 13: y=3\n\na_13=U, y_14=4\n\nTurn 14: y=4\n\na_14=U, y_15=5\n\nTurn 15: y=5\n\na_15=U, y_16=6\n\nTurn 16: y=6\n\na_16=U, y_17=7\n\nNow turn 17: y=7, T=17\n\nAt T=17, which freeways dangerous? fw1 and fw2 at T=17 and 18.\n\nBut fw1 and fw2 are rows 1 and 2, not row 7.\n\nRow 7 at T=17: dangerous? fw7 dangerous at T=10 and 13, not 17, so safe.\n\nBut we are going to y_17=7.\n\nThen a_17=U, y_18=8\n\nTurn 18: y=8, T=18\n\nT=18, fw1 and fw2 dangerous, but fw8 is row 8, which is not dangerous at T=18. fw8 dangerous only at T=10.\n\nSo y=8 at T=18 is safe.\n\nThen a_18=U, y_19=9\n\nTurn 19: y=9, reached.\n\nBut we started from turn 9, y=0, and reached y=9 at turn 19, so H=10? Turns: from turn 9 to turn 19, that's 10 steps? Let's count the turns.\n\nStart: turn 9, y=0\n\nAfter actions:\n\na_9 at turn 9: S, so turn 10: y=0\n\na_10 at turn 10: U, turn 11: y=1\n\na_11 at turn 11: U, turn 12: y=2\n\na_12 at turn 12: U, turn 13: y=3\n\na_13 at turn 13: U, turn 14: y=4\n\na_14 at turn 14: U, turn 15: y=5\n\na_15 at turn 15: U, turn 16: y=6\n\na_16 at turn 16: U, turn 17: y=7\n\na_17 at turn 17: U, turn 18: y=8\n\na_18 at turn 18: U, turn 19: y=9\n\nSo at turn 19, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_9 to a_18, that's 10 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns from start, but in the sequence, actions from t=9 to t=9+H-1, and position at t=9+H is 9.\n\nHere t=9+H =19, so H=10.\n\nBut is this minimal? We had to wait at turn 9, so we lost one turn.\n\nCan we avoid that?\n\nAt turn 9, we are at y=0, and we must not be on freeway at T=10, so we cannot go to y=1 at turn 10, so we have to stay or go down, but go down invalid, so only stay.\n\nSo we must have y_10=0, so at least one S action.\n\nThen we go up step by step, which takes 9 U actions to go from 0 to 9, but since we start from y=0 at turn 10, to y=9 at turn 19, that's 9 steps up, but with the initial S, total 10 actions.\n\nBut we have to consider if we can go faster or avoid the dangerous times differently.\n\nFor example, at T=13, we were at y=3, which is fine.\n\nBut later at T=17 and 18, we were not on rows 1 or 2, so no problem.\n\nBut in the above, we used 10 actions.\n\nIs there a way with H=9?\n\nH=9 would mean from turn 9 to turn 17, position at turn 18.\n\nStart turn 9 y=0\n\nAfter 9 actions, at turn 18, y=9.\n\nBut with 9 actions, we need to increase y by 9, so all actions must be U, no S or D.\n\nBut at turn 9, if we do a_9=U, y_10=1, but at T=10, y=1, dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we do a_9=S, y_10=0, then we need to go from y=0 at turn 10 to y=9 at turn 18 in 8 actions.\n\nBut to increase by 9 in 8 actions, we need at least 9 up moves, but only 8 actions, impossible because each U increases by one, so to go from y=10=0 to y=18=9, we need exactly 9 U actions, but with 8 actions, we can increase at most 8, to y=8, not 9.\n\ny_10=0, after 8 actions, y_18 <= 0 + 8 = 8 if all U, or less.\n\nCannot reach y=9 in 8 actions from y=0.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at turn 18 with H=9 actions starting from turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, to reach at turn 17, y_17=9, with actions from t=9 to t=15? H actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, position at t_1+H.\n\nSet t_1=9, position at 9+H.\n\nWe want 9+H = T, y_T=9.\n\nWith H actions, we can increase y by at most H, but y start at 0.\n\nSince we have to avoid collisions, but the minimal increase is needed.\n\nFrom above, to have y_{9+H}=9, we need at least H=9, but with H=9, we need y_{18}=9.\n\nBut to have y_{18}=9, we must have actions from t=9 to t=16 (since t=9 to t=9+H-1, H=9, so t=9 to 17? t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nt_1=9, actions for t=9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17? That's 9 actions: indices from 9 to 17 inclusive, that's 9 actions.\n\nPosition after last action at turn t_1 + H = 9+9=18.\n\ny_18=9.\n\nNow, with 9 actions, to go from y_9=0 to y_18=9, we need exactly 9 U actions, no S or D.\n\nBut at turn 9, if a_9=U, y_10=1, which at T=10 is collision.\n\nIf a_9=S, y_10=0, then we have only 8 actions left (t=10 to 17) to go from y_10=0 to y_18=9, which requires 9 U, impossible with 8 actions.\n\nThus H=9 is impossible.\n\nMinimal H is 10, as I had.\n\nIn my sequence, I have H=10, reaching at turn 19.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=13, I was at y=3, which is safe.\n\nAt T=17 and 18, I was at y=7 and 8, not 1 or 2.\n\nBut fw7 at T=17 is not dangerous, only at T=10 and 13.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence, I went up continuously except the first S.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at a higher y when moving.\n\nBut since I have to go step by step, no.\n\nAt the dangerous times, I can stay or move to avoid.\n\nBut in this case, at T=10, I had to be at y=0.\n\nThen from there, I went up each turn.\n\nBut at T=13, I was at y=3, but I could be higher if I start earlier, but I can't because of T=10.\n\nAnother thing: at T=13, dangerous for rows 5,6,7.\n\nIn my sequence, at T=13, I was at y=3, which is fine.\n\nBut suppose I want to be at y=4 or something, but I started late.\n\nFor example, if at turn 10, y=0, I could do S again, but that would delay more.\n\nOr I could go up faster, but I can only go one step per turn.\n\nUnless I do multiple actions, but no, each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo the sequence I have seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I was on a dangerous spot.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 10: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 11: y=1, T=11, fw1 not dangerous, safe\n\nTurn 12: y=2, T=12, fw2 not dangerous, safe\n\nTurn 13: y=3, T=13, fw3 not dangerous (only T=10), safe\n\nTurn 14: y=4, T=14, no dangerous times for fw4 except T=10, so safe\n\nTurn 15: y=5, T=15, fw5 dangerous at T=10 and 13, not 15, safe\n\nTurn 16: y=6, T=16, safe\n\nTurn 17: y=7, T=17, fw7 dangerous at T=10 and 13, not 17, safe\n\nTurn 18: y=8, T=18, fw8 dangerous only at T=10, not 18, safe\n\nThen turn 19: y=9, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, the actions: from turn 9 to turn 18, actions.\n\na_9: S\n\na_10: U\n\na_11: U\n\na_12: U\n\na_13: U\n\na_14: U\n\na_15: U\n\na_16: U\n\na_17: U\n\na_18: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 12, I set a_12=U to y_13=3, etc.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turns starting from t_1=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=9, so a_{9 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=10, so t from 0 to 9.\n\na_{9+0} = a_9\n\na_{9+1} = a_10\n\n...\n\na_{9+9} = a_18\n\nActions: a_9 to a_18.\n\na_9: S\n\na_10: U\n\na_11: U\n\na_12: U\n\na_13: U\n\na_14: U\n\na_15: U\n\na_16: U\n\na_17: U\n\na_18: U\n\nBut in the position, after a_18, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is 10.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=10 but reaching earlier? No, because we start from 0 and need to go to 9, minimum 9 steps up, but we had one S, so 10 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can go down at some point to avoid later dangers, but in this case, no need, and it would increase H.\n\nFor example, at T=17,18, rows 1 and 2 dangerous, but in my sequence, I was not there, so fine.\n\nSuppose I go up faster initially, but I can't because of T=10.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 9, I did S, but could I do something else? No.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at an earlier turn, but with more actions? No, more actions would make later turn.\n\nFor example, if I do S multiple times, y increases later.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7 at T=13, I avoided by being at y=3.\n\nBut I could be at y=8 or something, but I started from y=0 at turn 10, so at turn 13, after 3 actions, I can be at y=3 max, since from turn 10 y=0, turn 11 y=1, turn 12 y=2, turn 13 y=3.\n\nCannot be higher at T=13.\n\nSimilarly, later no issue.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nThe actions are for turns t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nH=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the car for freeway 3 and others.\n\nFor example, at T=10, freeway 3 dangerous, but I was at y=0, not on it.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up later, but that would delay.\n\nFor example, if at turn 10 I do S again, then y_11=0, then I start going up, but then I reach later, say turn 20, H=11, worse.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nIt says: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\n\nSo for t_1=9.\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 18: U\n\nThe last action is a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{18} for H=10.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 9 + 10 -1 = 18, yes.\n\nPosition at t_1 + H = 19.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7 at T=13, I have y=3, which is fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if at T=13, for example, freeway 3 is safe, which it is.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother point: in the beginning, at turn 9, position (0,0), and we are not on any freeway, so no collision.\n\nThen after a_9=S, at turn 10, y=0, safe.\n\nThen go up.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=4 or something by T=13, but I can't because only 3 steps from turn 10.\n\nUnless I start going up earlier, but I can't at turn 9.\n\nSo, I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) is 10, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 9 to turn 18.\n\n### Key Points:\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\(y = 0\\), which is safe (no cars on y=0 or y=9).\n- All freeways (y=1 to y=8) are dangerous at turn 10 (T=10) due to cars covering position 0. Therefore, the player must not be on any freeway (y=1 to 8) at T=10.\n- From y=0, the only valid actions are U (up) or S (stay). Choosing U at turn 9 would move to y=1 at turn 10, causing a collision. Thus, the player must choose S at turn 9 to stay at y=0, avoiding collision.\n- After turn 10, the player can move up freely, as no freeways are dangerous at turns 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 except for specific cases avoided in the path:\n  - At turn 13 (T=13), freeways 5, 6, and 7 are dangerous, but the player is at y=3 (safe).\n  - At turns 17 and 18 (T=17 and T=18), freeways 1 and 2 are dangerous, but the player is at y=7 and y=8 (safe).\n- The sequence involves one S action at turn 9 (to avoid collision at T=10) followed by nine U actions to reach y=9 by turn 19.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 9: S (stay at y=0, safe)\n- Turn 10: U (move to y=1 at turn 11, safe as fw1 not dangerous at T=11)\n- Turn 11: U (move to y=2 at turn 12, safe as fw2 not dangerous at T=12)\n- Turn 12: U (move to y=3 at turn 13, safe as fw3 not dangerous at T=13 and avoids dangerous fw5-7)\n- Turn 13: U (move to y=4 at turn 14, safe)\n- Turn 14: U (move to y=5 at turn 15, safe as fw5 not dangerous at T=15)\n- Turn 15: U (move to y=6 at turn 16, safe)\n- Turn 16: U (move to y=7 at turn 17, safe as fw7 not dangerous at T=17)\n- Turn 17: U (move to y=8 at turn 18, safe as fw8 not dangerous at T=18)\n- Turn 18: U (move to y=9 at turn 19, goal reached)\n\nThis sequence achieves y=9 at turn 19 (after 10 actions) with no collisions, and \\(H=10\\) is minimal as \\(H=9\\) is impossible due to the collision constraint at T=10.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: S \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U\n}",

I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, but I have to stay within y=0 to y=9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nCars are moving, so I need to consider where they are at each turn relative to t_1=10.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway. The table has freeways 1 to 8, but some have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (-42, -53, right, 6) and (6, -5, right, 6)\n\nFor right-moving cars, span at time T is [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] since head and tail are given with head larger? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe car update says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think, because it's moving right.\n\nLook at freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 6). -42 and -53, -42 > -53, so head is -42, tail is -53? But in the span, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [tau, h], so tau is tail, h is head.\n\nIn this case, for (-42, -53, right, 6), head = -42, tail = -53, so Span(t_1) = [tau, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nSimilarly, (6, -5, right, 6), head=6, tail=-5, Span(t_1) = [-5, 6]\n\nNow, at time T, Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-53 + 6(T-10), -42 + 6(T-10)] for first car, and similarly for second.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2 is same as freeway 1: (-42,-53,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSpan(t_1) = [tau, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [-47 + 48(T-10), 0 + 48(T-10)] = [-47 + 48(T-10), 48(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 4 same as freeway 3: (0,-47,right,48)\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-36,-47,right,12), (0,-11,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nFor each:\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, Span(t_1) = [-47, -36], Span(T) = [-47 + 12(T-10), -36 + 12(T-10)]\n\nSecond: head=0, tail=-11, Span(t_1) = [-11, 0], Span(T) = [-11 + 12(T-10), 0 + 12(T-10)] = [-11 +12(T-10), 12(T-10)]\n\nThird: head=36, tail=25, Span(t_1) = [25, 36], Span(T) = [25 + 12(T-10), 36 + 12(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 6 same as 5.\n\nFreeway 7 same as 5 and 6.\n\nFreeway 8: (0,-47,right,48) same as freeway 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 8 has (0,-47,right,48), so same as 3 and 4.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car at that turn.\n\nThat is, for the freeway k = y_T, there exists a car such that 0 ∈ [low, high] where low and high are the span endpoints at T.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to avoid being on a row when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, I am not on the new row until the next turn. Specifically, if at turn T I am at y_T, and I choose action to go to y_{T+1}, then at turn T, I am still on y_T, and only at T+1 I am on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for the current row, I need to be safe at turn T when I'm on it.\n\nI start at turn t_1=10, y=0. y=0 is not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars. The problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so I can be there safely.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, if I am on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so minimum H is 9 turns if I go up every turn, but I might hit cars on the rows in between.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=10 to t=10+H-1, and at t=10+H-1, y=9.\n\nLet me set t_1 = 10, so current turn is 10.\n\nI need actions for turns 10 to 10+H-1, so H actions, and after H actions, I reach y=9.\n\nStart at turn 10, y=0.\n\nAfter action at turn 10, y_{11} = y_10 + Δy, but y_10 is position at turn 10 before action? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, which determines Δy_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo position after action is at next turn.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, and I choose a_t, then at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, I am at y_T, and if y_T is between 1 and 8, I need that for freeway k=y_T, no car has 0 in span at T.\n\nThe collision is checked at the turn when I am on the row.\n\nSo for each turn T, when I am on y_T, if 1≤y_T≤8, I need to be safe.\n\nNow, at turn 10, I am at y=0, which is safe, since no freeway.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_end, which is safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the rows when cars are at x=0.\n\nSince I can only change y by 0 or ±1 each turn, I might need to stay or move down to avoid certain times.\n\nBut moving down might not help directly, but to wait for a safe time.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway row, when is it safe to be there, i.e., when no car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nFor each row k=1 to 8, find the times T when 0 not in any car span on that row at T.\n\nT is the turn number, starting from t_1=10.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we care about discrete turns.\n\nFor each row, I need the set of T where it is safe.\n\nThen, I need a path from y=0 at T=10 to y=9 at some T, with |y_{T+1} - y_T| ≤1, and for each T, if y_T between 1 and 8, it must be safe at T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, so for each turn T, y_T must be safe if 1-8.\n\nNow, let's find for each row the safe times.\n\nFirst, let's handle each freeway separately.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCars: \n\nCar A: (-42,-53,right,6) so Span(T) = [-53 + 6(T-10), -42 + 6(T-10)]\n\n0 in span if -53 +6(T-10) ≤ 0 ≤ -42 +6(T-10)\n\nSimilarly, Car B: (6,-5,right,6) Span(T) = [-5 +6(T-10), 6 +6(T-10)]\n\n0 in span if -5 +6(T-10) ≤ 0 ≤ 6 +6(T-10)\n\nNow, for Car A: -53 +6(T-10) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -42 +6(T-10)\n\nSo -53 +6(T-10) ≤ 0 => 6(T-10) ≤ 53 => T-10 ≤ 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so T-10 ≤ 8 since T integer? T-10 ≤ floor(53/6) = 8 since 6*8=48<53, 6*9=54>53.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -42 +6(T-10) => 42 ≤ 6(T-10) => T-10 ≥ 42/6 = 7\n\nSo for Car A, 0 in span when T-10 ≥ 7 and T-10 ≤ 8\n\nT-10 ≥7 and T-10 ≤8, so T=10+7=17 or T=10+8=18? Let's see:\n\nT-10 ≥7: T≥17\n\nT-10 ≤8: T≤18\n\nSo T=17 or 18.\n\nSimilarly, for Car B: 0 in span if -5 +6(T-10) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 6 +6(T-10)\n\n-5 +6(T-10) ≤ 0 => 6(T-10) ≤5 => T-10 ≤ 5/6 <1, so T-10 ≤0 since integer, T≤10\n\n0 ≤ 6 +6(T-10) always true since 6(T-10) ≥ something, but at T=10, 6 +6(0) =6>0, and for T>10, larger.\n\nBut T-10 ≤0, so T≤10.\n\nAt T=10, -5 +6(0) = -5 ≤0, and 0≤6, yes.\n\nSo Car B has 0 in span only at T=10? T≤10, but T starts from 10, so at T=10.\n\nT=10: Span for Car B: [-5 +6(0), 6+6(0)] = [-5,6], 0 in it, yes.\n\nFor T>10, T-10≥1, -5 +6(T-10) ≥ -5+6=1>0, so 0 not ≤ left endpoint, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for Car A, at T=17 and 18.\n\nNow, on freeway 1, collision if either car has 0 in span.\n\nAt T=10, Car B has it.\n\nAt T=17, Car A has it? At T=17, T-10=7, Car A: [-53+6*7, -42+6*7] = [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0], so 0 in it.\n\nAt T=18, [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nAt other times, no.\n\nBut Car B only at T=10.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe at T=10,17,18.\n\nSafe for other T.\n\nT=10 is unsafe, but T=10 is the current turn, but I am at y=0, not on freeway 1, so for row 1, when I am on it, it needs to be safe.\n\nFor turn T, if I am on y_T=1, then at that T, row 1 must be safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow freeway 2 is identical to freeway 1, since same cars: (-42,-53,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6), so same as above, unsafe at T=10,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 3: (0,-47,right,48)\n\nSpan(T) = [-47 +48(T-10), 48(T-10)]\n\n0 in span if -47 +48(T-10) ≤ 0 ≤ 48(T-10)\n\nFirst inequality: -47 +48(T-10) ≤0 => 48(T-10) ≤47 => T-10 ≤ 47/48 <1, so T-10 ≤0, T≤10\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 48(T-10), always for T≥10.\n\nSo only at T=10, 0 in span: [-47+0, 0] = [-47,0], 0 in it.\n\nFor T>10, -47 +48(T-10) ≥ -47 +48(1) =1>0 for T=11, so left end >0, 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same, unsafe only at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12) Span(T) = [-47 +12(T-10), -36 +12(T-10)]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12(T-10) ≤0 and 0 ≤ -36 +12(T-10)\n\nSo -47 +12(T-10) ≤0 => 12(T-10) ≤47 => T-10 ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so T-10 ≤3\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -36 +12(T-10) => 36 ≤12(T-10) => T-10 ≥3\n\nSo T-10 ≥3 and T-10 ≤3, so T-10=3, T=13\n\nAt T=13, [-47+12*3, -36+12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) Span(T) = [-11 +12(T-10), 12(T-10)]\n\n0 in span if -11 +12(T-10) ≤0 and 0 ≤12(T-10)\n\nFirst: -11 +12(T-10) ≤0 => 12(T-10) ≤11 => T-10 ≤11/12 <1, so T-10≤0, T≤10\n\nSecond: 0 ≤12(T-10), always for T≥10.\n\nSo at T=10, [-11+0, 0] = [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nThird car: (36,25,right,12) Span(T) = [25 +12(T-10), 36 +12(T-10)]\n\nLeft end: 25 +12(T-10) >0 for T≥10, since 25>0, so 0 not ≤ left end, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 5, unsafe when either car has 0 in span: at T=10 (from second car), and at T=13 (from first car).\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 and 7 same as 5, since identical cars.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 have same as 5.\n\nFreeway 8: (0,-47,right,48) same as freeway 3, unsafe only at T=10.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the unsafe times:\n\nRow 1 (y=1): unsafe at T=10,17,18\n\nRow 2 (y=2): same as row 1, unsafe at T=10,17,18\n\nRow 3 (y=3): unsafe at T=10\n\nRow 4 (y=4): unsafe at T=10\n\nRow 5 (y=5): unsafe at T=10,13\n\nRow 6 (y=6): unsafe at T=10,13\n\nRow 7 (y=7): unsafe at T=10,13\n\nRow 8 (y=8): unsafe at T=10\n\nNow, for all rows, T=10 is unsafe, but at T=10, I am at y=0, not on any row, so it's fine. I don't need to worry about T=10 for rows, since I'm not on them.\n\nThe unsafe times are when if I am on that row at that turn, I collide.\n\nFor row 3, unsafe only at T=10, but since at T=10 I'm at y=0, and for T>10, it's safe, so row 3 is always safe for T≥11.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet's list for each row, the safe turns (T≥10).\n\nStart from T=10 onwards.\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=17,18. Safe for T=10? T=10 is unsafe, but I'm not on it at T=10. For the row, when I am on it, T must not be 17 or 18. For T=10, it's unsafe but since I'm not there, it doesn't affect. So for y=1, it is safe to be on at T=10? No, at T=10, if I were on y=1, it would be unsafe, but I'm not.\n\nFor the purpose of being on the row at turn T, y=1 is unsafe only at T=17 and T=18 for T≥10.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 same: unsafe at T=17,18\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=10, but for T≥11, safe. Since I can be on y=3 only for T≥11, it is always safe for T≥11.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: unsafe only at T=10, so for T≥11, always safe.\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=10 and T=13. So for T≥11, unsafe only at T=13. Safe for other T≥11 except T=13.\n\nSimilarly, y=6: same, unsafe at T=13 for T≥11\n\ny=7: same, unsafe at T=13\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=10, so for T≥11, always safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at T=10 to y=9 at some T.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nI need to pass through the rows in between.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a row when it's unsafe.\n\nStart at T=10, y=0.\n\nI need to choose actions.\n\nAt T=10, I am at y=0, I choose a_{10}, which will determine y_{11}.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn, I move to next y.\n\nSince I start at T=10 y=0, and I want to reach y=9.\n\nThe position changes at T+1 based on action at T.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, I choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, I am at y_T, so if y_T between 1 and 8, it must be safe at T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}, must be safe if between 1 and 8, etc.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from T=10 to T=10+H-1, such that after H actions, at turn T=10+H, y_{10+H} =9? Let's see the indices.\n\nAt turn T=10, y_10 =0.\n\nAfter action a_10, y_11 = y_10 + Δy_10.\n\nAt turn T=11, I am at y_11.\n\nAfter action a_11, y_12 = y_11 + Δy_11, and so on.\n\nAt turn T=10+H, I am at y_{10+H}.\n\nI want y_{10+H} =9.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions, so I take actions at turns 10 to 10+H-1, and at turn 10+H, I am at position after H actions.\n\nThe sequence is {a_t} for t=10 to 10+H-1.\n\nAnd at turn 10+H, y=9.\n\nNow, min H is 9, if I go up every turn: start y10=0, a10=U, y11=1; a11=U, y12=2; ... a18=U, y19=9.\n\nBut I need to check if all positions are safe.\n\ny11=1 at T=11, y12=2 at T=12, ..., y18=8 at T=18, y19=9 at T=19.\n\nNow, for each:\n\nAt T=11, y=1: row 1 safe? Earlier, row 1 unsafe at T=17,18, so at T=11, safe.\n\nT=12, y=2: row 2 unsafe at T=17,18, so T=12 safe.\n\nT=13, y=3: row 3 safe for T>=11, so safe.\n\nT=14, y=4: row 4 safe for T>=11, safe.\n\nT=15, y=5: row 5 unsafe at T=13, but T=15>13, so safe? T=13 is unsafe, but T=15 is different.\n\nRow 5 unsafe only at T=13, so at T=15, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=16, y=6: row 6 unsafe at T=13, so T=16 safe.\n\nT=17, y=7: row 7 unsafe at T=13, so T=17 should be safe? Row 7 unsafe only at T=13 for T>=11.\n\nT=13 is unsafe, but T=17 is not 13, so safe.\n\nBut row 1 and 2 are unsafe at T=17 and 18.\n\nAt T=17, y=7, which is row 7, not row 1 or 2.\n\nRow 7 is safe at T=17.\n\nT=18, y=8: row 8 safe for T>=11, so safe.\n\nT=19, y=9, safe.\n\nIn this sequence: from T=11 to T=18, I am on rows 1 to 8, and all are safe except:\n\nAt T=17, y=7, row 7 is safe.\n\nT=18, y=8, row 8 safe.\n\nBut row 1 is unsafe at T=17, but I am not on row 1 at T=17, I am on row 7.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 unsafe at T=18, but I am on row 8.\n\nSo all good? But earlier I thought row 1 unsafe at T=17, but I am only on row 1 at T=11, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 unsafe at T=13, but at T=13, I am on y=3, row 3, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence: T=11: y=1, safe; T=12: y=2, safe; T=13: y=3, safe; T=14: y=4, safe; T=15: y=5, safe; T=16: y=6, safe; T=17: y=7, safe; T=18: y=8, safe; T=19: y=9, safe.\n\nBut row 5 is unsafe at T=13, but at T=13, I am on y=3, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 unsafe at T=17, but at T=17, I am on y=7.\n\nSo no collision, and I reach in 9 turns: actions from t=10 to t=18, H=9 actions, at t=19 y=9.\n\nt=10: action a10, to y11=1\n\nt=11: action a11, to y12=2\n\n...\n\nt=17: action a17, to y18=8? Let's list turns and positions.\n\nTurn T | position y_T | action a_T | next y\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy\n\nStart T=10, y=0, choose a10=U, then y11=1\n\nT=11, y=1, choose a11=U, y12=2\n\nT=12, y=2, choose a12=U, y13=3\n\nT=13, y=3, choose a13=U, y14=4\n\nT=14, y=4, choose a14=U, y15=5\n\nT=15, y=5, choose a15=U, y16=6\n\nT=16, y=6, choose a16=U, y17=7\n\nT=17, y=7, choose a17=U, y18=8\n\nT=18, y=8, choose a18=U, y19=9\n\nNow at each turn T, y_T:\n\nT=10: y=0, safe\n\nT=11: y=1, row1 safe (since not 17 or 18)\n\nT=12: y=2, row2 safe\n\nT=13: y=3, row3 safe\n\nT=14: y=4, row4 safe\n\nT=15: y=5, row5 safe (T=15 not 13)\n\nT=16: y=6, row6 safe (T=16 not 13)\n\nT=17: y=7, row7 safe (T=17 not 13)\n\nT=18: y=8, row8 safe\n\nT=19: y=9, safe\n\nAll good. And H=9 turns of actions? Actions from t=10 to t=18, that's 9 actions, and after that, at t=19, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is a_t for t=10 to 10+H-1, and at t=10+H, y=9.\n\nHere H=9, actions t=10 to 18, y19=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so turn 10 to 10+8=18? t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t_1} = a10, t=1, a11, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with all U, it works in H=9.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nEarlier I thought about row 1 unsafe at T=17, but in this path, I am not on row 1 at T=17, I am on row 7.\n\nSimilarly, all seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, row 5 unsafe at T=13.\n\nAt T=13, if I were on row 5, collision, but in the path, at T=13, I am on y=3, row 3, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 unsafe at T=17, at T=17 I am on y=7.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster? H=9 is minimum possible since I need to increase y by 9, each step at most +1, so min 9 actions.\n\nBut is it possible with less? No, because from y=0 to y=9, min 9 steps up.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only +1 per step.\n\nSo H=9 is minimum.\n\nAnd in this case, with all U, it works.\n\nBut let me check if at some point I might be forced to hit, but no.\n\nPerhaps I should write the actions.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nFreeway 5, for example, at T=13, row 5 is unsafe.\n\nBut I am not there.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut let me check row 1 at T=17.\n\nRow 1 has car that at T=17, Span [-11,0], so if I am on y=1 at T=17, I collide, but in the path, at T=17, I am at y=7.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps for row 2 same.\n\nBut in the sequence, I am on row 2 at T=12, which is safe.\n\nSo I think it works.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,0) at t=10, and I start moving up.\n\nBut in the car states, at t=10, for row 3, car at (0,-47,right,48), span at t=10 is [-47,0], so x=0 is covered, but I am not on row 3 at t=10, I am at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo with all U actions, I can reach in 9 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it faster, but I can't, since 9 steps needed.\n\nPerhaps with staying or down, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nSo min H=9.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nt_1 =10.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 18: U\n\nBut turn 10 to turn 18, that's 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so a_{10} to a_{18}.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm if at some point I might hit, but I think not.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the movement.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, if I go from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I am on y, and at T+1 on y+1.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for row 8, at T=18, I am on y=8, which is row 8, and it is safe for T>=11, so yes.\n\nBut row 8 unsafe only at T=10, so at T=18 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 3, for example, at T=10, span [-47,0], but I am not there.\n\nAt T=11, span for row 3: since right, speed 48, T=11, T-10=1, span [-47+48(1), 48(1)] = [1,48], so x=0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all.\n\nSo I think the direct up path works.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", which is 9.\n\nAnd sequence is all U.\n\nBut in the answer format.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it.\n\nBut let me see if for some row, it is unsafe at other times.\n\nFor example, row 1, I have unsafe at T=17,18, but in path, I am on row 1 only at T=11, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a car that causes issue later? For example, row 1 car at T=17 and 18, but since I pass early, no.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can start later, but that would take more turns.\n\nNo need.\n\nSo I think H=9 is achievable.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd at turn 19, y=9.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=9, t_1=10, so turns 10 to 10+8=18.\n\nActions: U for each.\n\nBut let me write in the box.\n\nThe format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut is turn 18 included? t_1 + H -1 = 10 + 9 -1 = 18, yes.\n\nNow, but I think I might have missed something.\n\nAnother point: the car on freeway 5, for example, at T=13, row 5 unsafe, but I am not there.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint that forces me to avoid.\n\nPerhaps for row 6 or 7, same.\n\nBut in this path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I move slower, but that would not minimize H.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe times.\n\nFor row 1: cars at T=17 and 18 unsafe.\n\nIn my path, I am on row 1 at T=11, which is not 17 or 18, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 at T=12, safe.\n\nRow 3 at T=13: row 3 has only unsafe at T=10, so at T=13 safe.\n\nRow 4 at T=14, safe.\n\nRow 5 at T=15: row 5 unsafe at T=10 and T=13, so T=15 safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 at T=16, unsafe only at T=13, so safe.\n\nRow 7 at T=17, unsafe only at T=13, so T=17 safe.\n\nRow 8 at T=18, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can do it in less than 9? No.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be the sequence above.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 10 to turn 18, resulting in the player reaching y=9 at turn 19.\n\n### Verification of Safety:\n- At turn 10, the player is at y=0 (safe, no freeway).\n- At turn 11, y=1: Freeway 1 is safe (unsafe only at turns 17 and 18).\n- At turn 12, y=2: Freeway 2 is safe (unsafe only at turns 17 and 18).\n- At turn 13, y=3: Freeway 3 is safe for turns ≥11 (unsafe only at turn 10).\n- At turn 14, y=4: Freeway 4 is safe for turns ≥11 (unsafe only at turn 10).\n- At turn 15, y=5: Freeway 5 is safe (unsafe only at turns 10 and 13; turn 15 is safe).\n- At turn 16, y=6: Freeway 6 is safe (unsafe only at turn 13; turn 16 is safe).\n- At turn 17, y=7: Freeway 7 is safe (unsafe only at turn 13; turn 17 is safe).\n- At turn 18, y=8: Freeway 8 is safe for turns ≥11 (unsafe only at turn 10).\n- At turn 19, y=9 (safe, no freeway).\n\nNo collisions occur, as the player is never on a freeway row when it is unsafe at the corresponding turn.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\ U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 11, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe car update rules: \n- For a car at time t1 with span [h, tau] (if left-moving) or [tau, h] (if right-moving) and speed s, at time T (>=t1) the car's position is:\n   left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n   right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (i.e., the player's x-coordinate).\n\nImportant: The player's position at turn T is (0, y_T). The action taken at turn T (a_T) determines y_{T+1}. So when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T, and then moves to y_{T+1} at the next turn.\n\nThus, to avoid collision, for every turn T from t1 to the turn before we reach 9, we must ensure that if the player is on freeway k (which is y_T) at turn T, then for every car on freeway k, the car's span at turn T does not include 0.\n\nNote: The player starts at (0,1) at turn t1=11. So at turn 11, the player is on freeway 1.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 11) for H turns, until we reach y=9.\n\nWe want minimal H.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 11.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The grid in y is from 0 to 9. We start at y=1 and must end at y=9. We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe must avoid the freeways 1 to 8 at the exact turn when we are on them.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=11 for each freeway (1 to 8). Each freeway has a list of cars, each car is (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nNote: The representation of the car span:\n- For a right-moving car: (head, tail, direction, speed) -> the head is the front? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: at time t1 the span is [tau, h] meaning from tail (tau) to head (h) and then at time T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\nBut in the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). However, note the example for right-moving: \n  at t1: [tau, h] -> then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut wait: the table entry for freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 6). \nThis seems odd because if it's right-moving, the head should be greater than the tail? But here head=-36 and tail=-47? \nBut note: -36 > -47, so the span is [-47, -36] (if we interpret as [tail, head] for right-moving?).\n\nActually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that tau is the tail and h is the head, and the car extends from tau to h. So if the car is moving right, then at time t1, the car spans from tau to h (with tau <= h). Then at time T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h, tau] (with h>=tau) and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (-36,-47,right,6) -> head=-36, tail=-47? But then at time t1, the car spans from -47 to -36? And since it's right-moving, it moves to the right.\n\nSimilarly, (12,1,right,6) -> spans from 1 to 12.\n\nBut note: the problem says for a car: \"head\" and \"tail\". In the right-moving case, the head should be the rightmost (larger x) and tail the leftmost (smaller x). So (-36,-47): -36 is the head? and -47 is the tail? Then the span at t1 is [-47, -36]? But that's a car of length 12? (because from -47 to -36 is 12 units? -36 - (-47) = 11, so 12 units? actually, the number of integer points from -47 to -36 inclusive is 12?).\n\nBut the problem says: \"head\" and \"tail\". In the example for right-moving, they write (head, tail) as (h, tau) and then the span is [tau, h]. So in this notation, the first number is head, the second is tail? Then for the car (-36, -47, right, 6): head=-36, tail=-47 -> so the car spans from tail=-47 to head=-36, which is [-47, -36].\n\nSimilarly, (12,1,right,6): head=12, tail=1 -> [1,12].\n\nNow, for freeway 3: (48,1,right,48) -> [1,48] at t1.\n\nBut note: at turn T, the car moves: for right-moving, the span becomes [1 + 48*(T-11), 48 + 48*(T-11)].\n\nWe need to check at each turn T (>=11) for the freeway we are on, whether 0 is in any of the car spans on that freeway.\n\nThe goal is to go from y=1 to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 8 moves (each U). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe must plan a path through the freeways (rows 1 to 8) without being hit by a car at the turn we are on that row.\n\nWe are at turn 11 at y=1. We must leave y=1 at some turn (by moving up or down) and then traverse the freeways until we get to y=9.\n\nWe can also stay at a freeway for multiple turns, but we must avoid the cars at every turn we are on that freeway.\n\nWe can also go down to y=0? But y=0 is not a freeway? The freeways are only from 1 to 8. So at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars. But note the problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So when we are at y=0 or y=9, we are safe? However, we start at y=1 (which is a freeway) and we must end at y=9 (which is safe). But during the journey, we might go to y=0? However, the problem says the vertical axis is from 0 to 9, and the player update constrains y in [0,9]. So we can go to 0.\n\nBut note: if we go to y=0, then at that turn we are not on a freeway (since freeways are 1..8), so we don't have to worry about cars. Similarly, when we reach y=9, we are done and safe.\n\nSo the safe rows are y=0 and y=9. The dangerous rows are y=1 to 8.\n\nWe start at y=1 at turn 11. We must leave y=1 as soon as possible? But we might have to wait.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at each freeway over time.\n\nWe are at turn t0 = 11.\n\nWe need to consider turns starting from 11 until we reach 9.\n\nI will denote T = t0 + t, where t=0,1,2,... and t0=11.\n\nSo at t=0 (turn 11), we are at y=1.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for t=0,1,2,... until we get to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid: for every turn T (>=11) and for the freeway k that we are on at that turn (if k is in {1,...,8}), then 0 must not be in any car span on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the car movements.\n\nLet me write a function to compute for a given freeway k, at a given turn T, whether the freeway is safe (i.e., 0 is not in any car span).\n\nBut note: each freeway has multiple cars.\n\nWe'll compute for each car on freeway k at turn T:\n\nFor a right-moving car: [tau + s*(T-t0), h + s*(T-t0)] -> we need to check if 0 is in [tau + s*(T-11), h + s*(T-11)]? \n\nBut note: the car is defined at t0=11: head = h, tail = tau.\n\nActually, the car's head and tail at time T are:\n\nFor right-moving:\n   head_T = h + s*(T-11)\n   tail_T = tau + s*(T-11)\n\nAnd the car spans [tail_T, head_T] (since head_T >= tail_T).\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving? But in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nAll cars in the table have direction \"right\". So we don't have any left-moving cars.\n\nSo we only consider right-moving.\n\nTherefore, for a car (head, tail, 'right', speed) at freeway k, at time T (>=11), the span is [tail + s*(T-11), head + s*(T-11)].\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in the interval [tail + s*(T-11), head + s*(T-11)].\n\nThat is: tail + s*(T-11) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-11)\n\nBut note: the interval is inclusive? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\", so inclusive.\n\nNow, let me write down the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: \n   car1: head=-36, tail=-47, s=6\n   car2: head=12, tail=1, s=6\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n   car1: (-36,-47,right,6)\n   car2: (12,1,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (48,1,right,48) -> head=48, tail=1, s=48\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? (48,1,right,48)\n\nFreeway 5: three cars:\n   car1: (-24,-35,right,12)\n   car2: (12,1,right,12)\n   car3: (48,37,right,12) -> note: 37 to 48? Actually, head=48, tail=37? So the span is [37,48] at t0? But wait: tail=37 and head=48 -> so [37,48]. But then at time T: [37+12*(T-11), 48+12*(T-11)]\n\nBut wait: the car is defined as (head, tail) and for right-moving, the span is [tail, head]? So yes.\n\nBut note: in the table, for freeway 5: (48,37,right,12) -> so head=48, tail=37 -> [37,48] at t0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5? \n   (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5 and 6.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 3 and 4? (48,1,right,48)\n\nBut wait, freeway 8: (48,1,right,48) -> [1,48] at t0.\n\nNow, we are at turn 11 at y=1.\n\nWe must check freeway 1 at turn 11: \n   car1: [ -47 + 6*(0) , -36 + 6*(0) ] = [-47, -36] -> 0 not in this interval.\n   car2: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? (since 1>0) -> so freeway 1 is safe at turn 11.\n\nBut we are at turn 11 at y=1, so we are safe.\n\nNow, we can choose to move up (to y=2), down (to y=0) or stay (remain at y=1).\n\nWe want to minimize the number of turns, so we want to go up as much as possible. But we must avoid the cars.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway and for each turn T, whether the freeway is safe at turn T.\n\nBut note: we don't know the path, so we have to plan.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) in the state space: state = (turn, y). The turn can be from 11 up to ... we don't know, but we can set a limit. Since the cars are moving, and we are only concerned when we are on a freeway, we might simulate until we reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be around 8 (if we go straight up) but we have to check the obstacles.\n\nLet me try to compute the safety for each freeway for a range of turns.\n\nI'll compute for turns T from 11 to, say, 30 (should be enough).\n\nWe'll create a grid: for freeways 1 to 8, and for turns 11 to 30, mark safe (True) or unsafe (False).\n\nBut note: for a given freeway k and turn T, it is safe if and only if 0 is not in any car span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (cars: car1: (-47,-36) s=6; car2: (1,12) s=6)\n\nAt turn T (relative to t0=11: let t = T-11, so t=0,1,2,...)\n\ncar1: [ -47 + 6*t , -36 + 6*t ]\ncar2: [ 1 + 6*t , 12 + 6*t ]\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in either interval.\n\nFor car1: \n   -47 + 6*t <= 0 <= -36 + 6*t \n   => \n      -47 + 6*t <= 0  => 6*t <= 47 => t <= 47/6 ≈ 7.83 -> t<=7\n      and 0 <= -36 + 6*t => 6*t >= 36 => t>=6\n\nSo for t in [6,7] (integer t: 6 and 7) the car1 covers 0? \n\nAt t=6: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? \n   -11<=0<=0 -> yes.\nAt t=7: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> yes.\n\nSo car1: unsafe at t=6 and t=7 (i.e., T=17,18)\n\nFor car2: \n   1+6*t <= 0 <= 12+6*t -> \n      1+6*t <=0 -> 6*t<=-1 -> never true (since t>=0)\n      and 0<=12+6*t -> always true? But the first inequality fails.\n\nSo car2 never covers 0.\n\nTherefore, freeway1 is unsafe at T=17 (t=6) and T=18 (t=7). Otherwise safe.\n\nFreeway2: same as freeway1 -> unsafe at T=17,18.\n\nFreeway3: one car: (tail=1, head=48, s=48)\n\nAt turn T: [1+48*t, 48+48*t] (with t=T-11)\n\nCheck if 0 in [1+48*t, 48+48*t] -> \n   1+48*t <=0 <=48+48*t\n   The first: 1+48*t<=0 -> 48*t<=-1 -> t<0 -> never.\n   So safe for all T>=11.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4: same -> safe always.\n\nFreeway5: three cars:\n   car1: (-35,-24) s=12? Actually: head=-24, tail=-35 -> so [tail, head] = [-35,-24] at t0? \n        Then at T: [-35+12*t, -24+12*t]\n   car2: (1,12) s=12 -> [1+12*t, 12+12*t]\n   car3: (37,48) s=12 -> [37+12*t, 48+12*t]\n\nCheck for 0:\n\ncar1: [-35+12*t, -24+12*t] -> \n   -35+12*t <=0<=-24+12*t\n   => \n      -35+12*t<=0 -> 12*t<=35 -> t<=35/12≈2.91 -> t<=2\n      0<=-24+12*t -> 12*t>=24 -> t>=2\n   So at t=2: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes.\n   t=2: T=11+2=13.\n\ncar2: [1+12*t,12+12*t] -> \n   1+12*t<=0 -> never (for t>=0), so safe.\n\ncar3: [37+12*t,48+12*t] -> \n   37+12*t>0 always (for t>=0), so 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway5: unsafe only at T=13? (t=2) because of car1.\n\nBut wait: at t=2, car1: [-11,0] -> 0 is in the interval? yes.\n\nBut also at t=3? \n   car1: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe for car1? \n   So only unsafe at t=2 (T=13).\n\nSo freeway5: unsafe at T=13.\n\nBut what about other cars? car2: at t=0: [1,12] -> 0 not in; t=1: [13,24]; ... so always safe.\n\ncar3: always positive.\n\nSo freeway5: unsafe at T=13, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5 -> unsafe at T=13.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway5 -> unsafe at T=13.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway3 and 4: one car (1,48) s=48 -> safe always.\n\nSummary:\n\nFreeway1: unsafe at T=17,18\nFreeway2: unsafe at T=17,18\nFreeway3: safe always\nFreeway4: safe always\nFreeway5: unsafe at T=13\nFreeway6: unsafe at T=13\nFreeway7: unsafe at T=13\nFreeway8: safe always\n\nWe are at turn 11 at y=1.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nWe can consider moving up as quickly as possible, but we have to avoid the unsafe times on the freeways.\n\nWe start at y=1 at T=11.\n\nWe can:\n\nOption 1: Go straight up: \n   Turn 11 (T=11): at y=1 -> safe (as computed). Then we can choose U -> then at T=12, we are at y=2.\n\nBut at T=12, we are at freeway 2? \n   But freeway2 is unsafe at T=17,18 -> at T=12, it's safe? \n   But wait: we are at y=2 at T=12. Freeway2 is safe at T=12? \n      We computed freeway2: unsafe only at T=17,18 -> so safe at T=12.\n\nThen we can go U again: T=12: action U -> T=13: y=3.\n\nAt T=13: y=3 -> freeway3? But freeway3 is safe always -> so safe.\n\nBut note: at T=13, we are at freeway3 -> safe.\n\nThen T=13: we can go U -> T=14: y=4 -> freeway4: safe always -> safe.\n\nT=14: U -> T=15: y=5 -> freeway5: at T=15: we computed freeway5 is safe at T=15 (only unsafe at T=13) -> safe.\n\nT=15: U -> T=16: y=6 -> freeway6: at T=16: unsafe? \n   freeway6 is unsafe at T=13 -> safe at T=16? yes.\n\nT=16: U -> T=17: y=7 -> freeway7: at T=17: unsafe? \n   freeway7: unsafe at T=13 -> but T=17 is safe? \n   However, we have freeway7: same as freeway5: unsafe only at T=13 -> so at T=17, safe.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway7? We computed freeway7: unsafe only at T=13? \n   Yes, because the car that causes the problem is car1 (on freeway5,6,7) which is unsafe only at T=13.\n\nBut then T=17: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n\nThen T=17: U -> T=18: y=8 -> freeway8: safe always.\n\nThen T=18: U -> T=19: y=9 -> done.\n\nSo we reached y=9 at T=19, which is turn 19.\n\nThe number of turns: from T=11 to T=19: 8 turns? \n   Actually, we start at T=11 and we take actions at T=11,12,...,18? and at T=19 we are at y=9? \n   But note: we take H actions? and we start at t1=11, then we take actions at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at the new state? \n\nBut the problem says: \n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and the action a_t is taken at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t1=11, at y_11=1.\n\nWe take an action a_11, then at turn 12 we are at y_12, then a_12, and so on until we are at y=9.\n\nWe must have y_{t1+H} = 9? \n   After H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and we have y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut note: we start at turn t1, then we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H, we are at the new state.\n\nSo we want the minimal H such that after H actions we are at y=9.\n\nIn the above plan:\n\n   Turn 11: action U -> then at turn 12: y=2\n   Turn 12: action U -> turn 13: y=3\n   Turn 13: action U -> turn 14: y=4\n   Turn 14: action U -> turn 15: y=5\n   Turn 15: action U -> turn 16: y=6\n   Turn 16: action U -> turn 17: y=7\n   Turn 17: action U -> turn 18: y=8\n   Turn 18: action U -> turn 19: y=9\n\nSo we have taken 8 actions (from turn 11 to turn 18) and at turn 19 we are at y=9.\n\nH=8? Then the sequence has H=8 actions.\n\nBut we must check the safety at every turn we are on a freeway.\n\nAt each turn T (from 11 to 18), we are at a freeway? \n\n   T=11: y=1 -> freeway1: safe? \n      As computed: freeway1 unsafe at T=17,18 -> safe at T=11.\n\n   T=12: y=2 -> freeway2: safe? \n      freeway2 unsafe at T=17,18 -> safe at T=12.\n\n   T=13: y=3 -> freeway3: safe always -> safe.\n\n   T=14: y=4 -> freeway4: safe always -> safe.\n\n   T=15: y=5 -> freeway5: unsafe at T=13 -> at T=15, safe? \n        Yes, because only unsafe at T=13.\n\n   T=16: y=6 -> freeway6: unsafe at T=13 -> safe at T=16.\n\n   T=17: y=7 -> freeway7: unsafe at T=13 -> safe at T=17.\n\n   T=18: y=8 -> freeway8: safe always -> safe.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nTherefore, we can go straight up in 8 moves.\n\nBut wait: is there a faster way? We start at y=1 and need to get to y=9: 8 moves up. That's minimal. So H=8.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions at each step.\n\nFor example, at T=13, we are at freeway3: which is safe always? \n   freeway3: car: [1+48*(T-11), 48+48*(T-11)]\n   At T=13: t=2 -> [1+96, 48+96] = [97,144] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAt T=15, freeway5: \n   car1: [-35+12*(15-11) = -35+12*4 = -35+48=13, -24+48=24] -> [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n   car2: [1+12*4=49, 12+48=60] -> [49,60] -> safe.\n   car3: [37+48=85, 48+48=96] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo the plan works.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions is 8 U's.\n\nBut what about the possibility of going down? We don't need to because we can go straight up.\n\nSo the answer:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nAt turn 19, we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: the problem says the sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we list actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nHere H=8, so turns 11 to 18.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=8.\n\nIs there a way with H<8? \n   We start at y=1, to get to y=9, we need to cover 8 units. Each U gives +1. So we must have at least 8 U's. And we cannot use D because that would increase the number of moves. So minimal H is 8.\n\nTherefore, this is minimal.\n\nBut note: we could possibly use a mix of U and S? That would only increase the number of moves. So no.\n\nOr we could go down to 0 and then up? But that would require at least 9 moves: down to 0 (1 move) then up to 9 (9 moves) -> 10 moves? Or we might skip some freeways? But no, because we have to go from 0 to 9, so at least 9 moves up. So worse.\n\nTherefore, the above is optimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we go up to 9 in 8 moves, but we must avoid the unsafe times? We did and it worked.\n\nBut note: at T=17 and T=18, freeway1 and 2 are unsafe, but we are not on freeway1 or 2 at T=17 and 18: \n   At T=17: we are at y=7 -> freeway7 -> safe (as computed).\n   At T=18: we are at y=8 -> freeway8 -> safe.\n\nSo we are clear.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 consecutive U's.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe times:\n\nFreeway1: unsafe at T=17,18? \n   T=17: t=6 -> car1: [-47+6*6, -36+6*6] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in? yes.\n   T=18: t=7: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> 0 in? yes.\n\nBut we are not on freeway1 at T=17 or 18.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5,6,7: unsafe at T=13? \n   T=13: t=2: freeway5: car1: [-35+12*2, -24+12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 in? yes.\n\nBut at T=13, we are at freeway3? \n   In our plan: \n      T=11: y=1 -> freeway1\n      T=12: y=2 -> freeway2\n      T=13: y=3 -> freeway3 -> safe.\n\nSo we avoid freeway5,6,7 at T=13.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nSo the answer is the sequence above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) is 8.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are moving left or right on their freeways. For collision, it only matters if the player is on a freeway at a turn where a car's span includes 0 at that exact turn. Also, when moving to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check the car on your current y for collision.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t1=12. For future turns T, the car positions are updated based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, I need to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nSince we start at y=2 and need to get to y=9, we need to move up at least 7 times. But because we can only move one step at a time and there might be obstacles, it could take more turns if we have to wait or go around, but since we're on a line (y-axis), and cars are on specific y-levels, the only way is to go through each y from 2 to 9, but we can skip some by moving directly, but no, each move changes y by at most 1, so we have to pass through each integer y from 2 to 9, but we might not stay on each; we just need to be at y=9 at some point.\n\nWe start at y=2 at turn t1=12. After one action, we can be at y=1,2, or 3, and so on.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, we are on some y=k (1 to 8), and for that freeway k, at turn T, there is a car whose span includes 0.\n\nThe span is the position along x, I assume, and we are at x=0, so if a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nFor each freeway and each turn, I need to know if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThen, when the player is on that y at that turn, collision happens.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but for collision at turn T, we are on y_T, and we check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision from cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, you are on y_T at turn T, so you check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and you check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1, and so on.\n\nSo for each turn and each y, I need the car situation.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t1=12.\n\nTurn t1 is 12, so T=12 is the current turn.\n\nCars:\n\nFor freeway 1: two cars: (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6)\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so increasing x.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: span at T is [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T: [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut head and tail: in the left-moving example, it says span(t1) = [h, tau], and for left-moving, it becomes [h - s dt, tau - s dt] where dt = T-t1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t1) = [tau, h] and becomes [tau + s dt, h + s dt].\n\nIn the freeway 1, first car: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nBut span(t1) should be [tau, h] for right-moving? It says (head h, tail tau, direction, speed)\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, I assume, so for right-moving, head > tail, and they move right.\n\nIn the first car on freeway 1: head=-30, tail=-41? That seems odd because -30 > -41, so if moving right, head should be on the right, so if head=-30, tail=-41, since -30 > -41, head is at -30, tail at -41, so the span is from left to right, tail to head, so [tail, head] = [-41, -30]? But the notation says (head, tail), so it's (h,t) with h and t, but for direction.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFrom the update rule, for right-moving, span(t1) = [tau, h] meaning from tail to head, with tail at left, head at right.\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right-moving, head > tail typically.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1, first car: head=-30, tail=-41, dir=right, speed=6.\n\nSince dir=right, head=-30, tail=-41, so at t1, span is from tail to head, so positions from -41 to -30? But -41 to -30 is from left to right, so min to max is [-41, -30]? But in terms of position, tail is at min, head at max for right-moving.\n\nIn the update rule, it says for right-moving: span(T) = [tau + s dt, h + s dt]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s dt, tau - s dt]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in the span.\n\nAlso, the span is inclusive, I assume.\n\nNow for freeway 1, first car: at t1=12, head=-30, tail=-41, dir=right, s=6.\n\nSo span at t1: [tau, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nSince right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (18,7,right,6), head=18, tail=7, so span [7,18]\n\nNow for freeway 2, same as freeway 1? It says | 2 | same as 1 |, so (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3: (96,49,right,48), head=96, tail=49, dir=right, s=48, so span [49,96]\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3, (96,49,right,48)\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nFirst: head=-12, tail=-23, span [-23,-12]\n\nSecond: head=24, tail=13, span [13,24]\n\nThird: head=60, tail=49, span [49,60]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5, three cars same.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5 and 6? It says |7 | same |, so (-12,-23,right,12), etc.\n\nFreeway 8: (96,49,right,48)\n\nNow, we need for each freeway y from 1 to 8, and for each turn T >= t1=12, when a car covers x=0.\n\nThat is, when 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\ndt = T - 12\n\nFor a car, at time T, span is:\n\nIf right-moving: [tau + s dt, h + s dt]\n\nIf left-moving, but all here are right-moving, I think. All directions are \"right\" in the given, no left-moving cars mentioned. Let me check.\n\nIn the car state, all directions are \"right\", so all moving right.\n\nSo for each car, at time T, the left end L(T) = tau + s (T - 12)\n\nRight end R(T) = h + s (T - 12)\n\nSince head is the front for right-moving.\n\nAnd 0 is covered if L(T) <= 0 <= R(T)\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nNow for each freeway, list the cars and their L and R over time.\n\nSince we care about when 0 is covered, we can find for each car the times when it covers 0.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway, so for a given freeway and time, if any car covers 0, it's occupied.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars\n\nCar A: tau=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\nAt T, L_A(T) = -41 + 6*(T-12)\n\nR_A(T) = -30 + 6*(T-12)\n\nSimilarly, Car B: tau=7, h=18, s=6\n\nL_B(T) = 7 + 6*(T-12)\n\nR_B(T) = 18 + 6*(T-12)\n\nNow, 0 covered by car A if L_A(T) <= 0 <= R_A(T)\n\nSimilarly for B.\n\nL_A(T) = -41 + 6(T-12)\n\nR_A(T) = -30 + 6(T-12)\n\nSet L_A(T) <= 0 <= R_A(T)\n\nSo -41 + 6(T-12) <= 0 and 0 <= -30 + 6(T-12)\n\nFirst inequality: -41 + 6(T-12) <= 0 => 6(T-12) <= 41 => T-12 <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833, so T <= 12 + 6.833 = 18.833, so T <= 18 since T integer? Turn numbers are integers, I assume.\n\nT is turn, discrete, so T integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -30 + 6(T-12) => 30 <= 6(T-12) => 5 <= T-12 => T >= 17\n\nSo for car A, 0 covered when T >=17 and T<=18\n\nT>=17 and T<=18, so T=17,18\n\nSimilarly, R_A(T) = -30 + 6(T-12)\n\n0 <= -30 + 6(T-12) => 6(T-12) >=30 => T-12 >=5 => T>=17\n\nL_A(T) <=0: -41 +6(T-12) <=0 => 6(T-12) <=41 => T-12 <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so T<=18 since T integer, T-12 <=6, 6*6=36<41, T-12=6, L= -41+36= -5 <=0, T-12=7, L= -41+42=1 >0? Let's compute.\n\nT-12 | L_A | R_A\n\nFor T=12: L= -41 +6(0) = -41, R= -30\n\n0 not in [-41,-30] since -30 <0? -41 to -30, all negative, 0 not covered.\n\nT=13: L= -41+6= -35, R= -30+6= -24\n\nStill negative\n\n...\n\nT=16: L= -41 +6*4= -41+24= -17, R= -30+24= -6\n\nStill negative\n\nT=17: L= -41 +6*5= -41+30= -11, R= -30+30=0\n\nSo span [-11,0], so 0 covered.\n\nT=18: L= -41+36= -5, R= -30+36=6, so [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nT=19: L= -41+42=1, R= -30+42=12, [1,12], 1>0, 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, T=17 and 18 covered.\n\nNow car B: L_B(T) =7 +6(T-12)\n\nR_B(T)=18+6(T-12)\n\n0 covered if L_B <=0<= R_B\n\nL_B(T) <=0: 7 +6(dt) <=0, but 7>0, and increasing, so L_B min at T=12 is 7, always positive, so L_B(T) >=7 >0 for all T, so 0 never <= L_B, so 0 not covered by car B.\n\nSimilarly, R_B always > L_B >0, so no.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only car A covers 0 at T=17 and 18.\n\nTherefore, freeway 1 is occupied at T=17 and T=18.\n\nNow freeway 2 is same as freeway 1, so also occupied at T=17,18.\n\nFreeway 3: car (96,49,right,48)\n\ntau=49, h=96, s=48\n\nL(T) =49 +48(T-12)\n\nR(T)=96+48(T-12)\n\n0 covered if L(T) <=0<= R(T)\n\nL(T)=49+48dt >=49>0 for all dt>=0, so always positive, never <=0, so 0 never covered. Similarly R>0.\n\nSo freeway 3 never has car covering 0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 same, never occupied.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12) so head=-12, tail=-23? tau=-23, h=-12, s=12\n\nL(T) = tau + s dt = -23 +12(T-12)\n\nR(T) = h + s dt = -12 +12(T-12)\n\n0 covered if L(T) <=0 <= R(T)\n\nL(T) <=0: -23 +12dt <=0 => 12dt <=23 => dt <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so dt <=1 since integer? T-12=dt\n\ndt=0: T=12, L=-23 <=0, R=-12 <=0? 0 <= R? R=-12<0, so 0 not <= R\n\nWe need both L<=0 and 0<=R\n\nL(T) <=0: -23 +12dt <=0 => 12dt <=23 => dt <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so dt <=1\n\n0<=R(T): 0 <= -12 +12dt => 12 <=12dt => dt >=1\n\nSo for dt=1: T=13, L= -23 +12= -11 <=0, R= -12+12=0, so 0 covered.\n\ndt=0: T=12, L=-23<=0, R=-12<0, so 0 > R, not <= R, so 0 not in span.\n\ndt=1: T=13, L=-11, R=0, so [ -11,0], 0 covered.\n\ndt=2: L= -23+24=1, R=0+12=12? R= -12+24=12, L=1>0, so [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSo only at T=13 for this car.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (24,13,right,12) head=24, tail=13? tau=13, h=24, s=12\n\nL(T)=13 +12dt\n\nR(T)=24+12dt\n\nL min 13>0, so always >0, never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (60,49,right,12) head=60, tail=49, L=49+12dt>0, no cover.\n\nSo only first car covers 0 at T=13.\n\nThus freeway 5 occupied only at T=13.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6 same as 5, occupied at T=13.\n\nFreeway 7 same, occupied at T=13.\n\nFreeway 8: (96,49,right,48) same as 3 and 4, never occupied.\n\nNow, freeway 3,4,8 never occupied.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 occupied at T=17,18\n\nFreeway 5,6,7 occupied at T=13\n\nAnd freeway 3,4,8 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, no cars there, so safe.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe to be there.\n\nNow, player starts at turn t1=12 at y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach turn, we can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway y when it is occupied at that turn.\n\nSpecifically, for y=1 to 8, if we are on y at turn T, and y is occupied at T, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nAlso, we can be on y=0 or y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, the occupied times:\n\ny=1: occupied at T=17,18\n\ny=2: freeway 2, occupied at T=17,18\n\ny=3: freeway 3, never occupied\n\ny=4: freeway 4, never occupied\n\ny=5: freeway 5, occupied at T=13\n\ny=6: freeway 6, occupied at T=13\n\ny=7: freeway 7, occupied at T=13\n\ny=8: freeway 8, never occupied\n\nAlso, y=1 occupied at 17,18; y=2 at 17,18; y=5,6,7 at T=13 only.\n\nNow, we start at turn 12, y=2.\n\nAt turn 12, y=2, is it occupied? Freeway 2 occupied only at 17,18, not at 12, so safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we need to increase y from 2 to 9, minimum 7 moves up, so minimum H=7 turns if we go up every time.\n\nBut we might have to wait if we hit an occupied time.\n\nLet's see the path.\n\nStart at T=12, y=2.\n\nWe can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up to y=3, or down to y=1, or stay at y=2.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9, so down might not be efficient, but sometimes necessary to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly up.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=12.\n\nAfter action at T=12, we move to y_{13} at turn 13.\n\nTurn T=12: we are at y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen we perform action a_{12}, which determines y_{13}.\n\nThen at turn 13, we are at y_{13}, and we check collision at T=13.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nMinimal H: we start at turn 12, position at turn 12 is given, after H-1 actions, we are at turn 12 + (H-1) at y=9.\n\nAfter t actions, we are at turn 12 + t.\n\nSequence from t=0 to H-1, actions at t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSet t1=12.\n\nAt time tau = 0,1,2,...,H-1, we perform action a_{t1 + tau}, and after that, at turn t1 + tau, we have position, but the position is after the action.\n\nDefine the state.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, with delta based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T, since we are at y_T, we check collision on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nThen we move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, for turn T, action a_T affects y_{T+1}.\n\nBut the collision check is at turn T for y_T.\n\nFor the player, at turn T, we are at y_T, and we choose a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nThen collision is checked at T for (T, y_T).\n\nIn the sequence output, we need to list actions starting from a_{t1}, which is a_{12}.\n\nAt turn 12, we are at y=2.\n\nWe choose a_{12}, which will set y_{13} = y_{12} + delta.\n\nBut at turn 12, we check collision on y=2 at T=12, which is safe, as we said.\n\nThen at turn 13, we are at y_{13}, check collision on y_{13} at T=13, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H} = 9, I think.\n\nAfter H actions, we have done actions at t=12 to t=12+H-1, so we have positions from t=12 to t=12+H.\n\nAt turn 12, position y_{12}=2.\n\nAfter action a_{12}, position at turn 13: y_{13}\n\nAfter a_{13}, y_{14}, ..., after a_{12+H-1}, y_{12+H}\n\nWe want y_{12+H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nNow, the collision: at each turn T from 12 to 12+H-1, when we are at y_T, it must be safe, meaning that if y_T between 1 and 8, it must not be occupied at T.\n\nAt turn 12+H, we are at y_{12+H}=9, which is safe, no need to check, or if we are on freeway, but y=9 not freeway, so safe.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, freeways are 1-8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nSo only need to avoid collision from T=12 to T=12+H-1, when we are on y_T for T in [12, 12+H-1].\n\nNow, y_T must be safe at T for each T in [12, 12+H-1].\n\nAnd y_{12} =2, y_{12+H} =9.\n\nNow, the position changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe need to go from y=2 to y=9, so net +7, but with possible down moves, but to minimize H, we should go up as much as possible, only deviate if necessary to avoid collision.\n\nNow, let's see the constraints.\n\nOccupied times:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=17,18\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=17,18\n\ny=3: always safe\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=13\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=13\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=13\n\ny=8: always safe\n\nWe start at T=12, y=2.\n\nAt T=12, y=2 safe.\n\nT=13: y=13? At turn 13, we are at y_{13}, which depends on action at T=12.\n\ny_{13} can be 1,2, or 3.\n\nNow, at T=13, if we are on y=5,6, or 7, it is unsafe.\n\nAlso, if on y=1,2,3,4,8, safe at T=13 except possibly others, but y=1 and 2 safe at T=13, since only unsafe at 17,18.\n\ny=1 unsafe at 17,18, safe at 13.\n\nSimilarly y=2 unsafe at 17,18, safe at 13.\n\ny=3,4 always safe.\n\ny=8 safe.\n\nBut y=5,6,7 unsafe at T=13.\n\nSo at turn T=13, we must not be on y=5,6, or 7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=17 and 18, we must not be on y=1 or 2.\n\nNow, for other turns, all y are safe except at specific times.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are unsafe at T=13, we should avoid being on them at T=13.\n\nThat means at turn 13, y_{13} should not be 5,6, or 7.\n\ny_{13} is set based on action at T=12.\n\nCurrently at T=12, y=2.\n\nAction a_{12}: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_{13} =3\n\nIf S, y_{13}=2\n\nIf D, y_{13}=1\n\nNone of these are 5,6,7, so all are safe at T=13.\n\ny=1,2,3 all safe at T=13.\n\nSo we can choose any action, but to go up, probably U to y=3.\n\nBut let's see later constraints.\n\nAlso, at T=17 and 18, y=1 and 2 unsafe.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 by some turn.\n\nMinimal H: if we go up every turn, from y=2 at T=12, after k up moves, at y=2+k.\n\nSet 2+k=9, k=7, so after 7 up moves, at turn 12+7=19, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check if we can be safe at all turns from T=12 to T=18.\n\nTurns involved: from start turn 12 to end turn 19, positions at T=12 to T=19.\n\ny_{19}=9.\n\nAt each T from 12 to 18, y_T must be safe.\n\nT=12: y=2, safe\n\nT=13: y_{13}, which if we go up, y=3, safe\n\nT=14: y=4, safe (assume we go up)\n\nT=15: y=5, now y=5 is freeway 5, which is only unsafe at T=13, not at T=15, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=16: y=6, unsafe only at T=13, so safe at 16.\n\nT=17: y=7, unsafe at T=13? y=7 is unsafe only at T=13, not at T=17.\n\ny=7 freeway 7, occupied only at T=13, so at T=17, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=18: y=8, safe\n\nThen T=19: y=9, safe.\n\nIn this path: all actions U, from T=12 to T=18.\n\nActions: a_{12} to a_{18}, 7 actions, to reach y_{19}=9.\n\nNow check safety:\n\nT=12: y=2, safe\n\nT=13: y=3, safe (y=3 always safe)\n\nT=14: y=4, safe\n\nT=15: y=5, safe (not T=13)\n\nT=16: y=6, safe\n\nT=17: y=7, safe (not T=13)\n\nT=18: y=8, safe\n\nT=19: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut at T=17 and T=18, y=1 and 2 are unsafe, but we are at y=7 and 8, not on 1 or 2, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, at T=13, we are at y=3, not on 5,6,7.\n\nSo this seems possible with H=7, actions all U.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? From y=2 to y=9, minimum 7 moves up, so H=7 is minimum possible, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nWith 7 actions, we can go to y=9.\n\nIn this case, it works.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nStart: turn 12, y=2\n\nAfter a_{12}=U, y_{13}=3\n\nTurn 13: at y=3, safe\n\na_{13}=U, y_{14}=4\n\nTurn 14: y=4, safe\n\na_{14}=U, y_{15}=5\n\nTurn 15: y=5, safe (since occupied only at T=13, not 15)\n\na_{15}=U, y_{16}=6\n\nTurn 16: y=6, safe (not T=13)\n\na_{16}=U, y_{17}=7\n\nTurn 17: y=7, safe (y=7 unsafe only at T=13, T=17 is fine)\n\na_{17}=U, y_{18}=8\n\nTurn 18: y=8, safe\n\na_{18}=U, y_{19}=9\n\nTurn 19: y=9, done.\n\nWe reached at turn 19 with 7 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? In the sequence, we have actions from t=12 to t=18, that's 7 actions, H=7.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc., up to turn t1 + H-1.\n\nHere t1=12, H=7, so actions from turn 12 to turn 12+6=18? t from 0 to H-1=6, so turns 12+0 to 12+6=18.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at turn 19.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we start at y=2 at T=12, after 6 actions, at turn 18, y could be at most 2+6=8, not 9.\n\nAfter 6 actions: from T=12 to T=17, y from 2 to y_{17}, which could be 8 if all up, but we need y=9, so at turn 18, y_{18} could be 9 if we go up 7 times.\n\nMinimum turns: since we start at y=2, need to increase by 7, so at least 7 actions, so minimum H=7.\n\nWith H=7, we can reach at turn 19.\n\nIn the path above, it seems fine.\n\nBut let's check if at any point we are unsafe.\n\nAt T=17, we are at y=7, which is freeway 7, and at T=17, is it occupied?\n\nFreeway 7 occupied only at T=13, as per above.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at T=16, not T=13.\n\ny=5 at T=15, not T=13.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut earlier for freeway 7, we have cars, but only unsafe at T=13.\n\nIn the car list, freeway 7 has cars, but they cover 0 only at T=13.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in freeway 5,6,7, occupied only at T=13.\n\nAnd we are not on them at T=13 in this path.\n\nAt T=13, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps we could go faster, but impossible since 7 steps needed.\n\nUnless we can skip, but no, must move step by step.\n\nSo H=7 seems achievable.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn this case, all actions U.\n\nBut let's see if we need to consider other options, but it works.\n\nPerhaps at T=13, if we were on y=2, it would still be safe, but going up is better.\n\nIn this case, no need to go down.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we go down at some point, it would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H is 7 with all U actions.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 7 at T=17.\n\nFreeway 7: cars same as freeway 5: (-12,-23,right,12), etc.\n\nAt T=13, the first car covers 0.\n\nAt T=17, dt=5, for first car: L(T)= -23 +12*5 = -23+60=37, R(T)= -12+60=48, so [37,48], not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly other cars not near 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, I thought y=1 and 2 unsafe at 17,18, but we are not there.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 12, we start at y=2, which is freeway 2, but at T=12, is it occupied? Earlier we said freeway 2 occupied only at 17,18, so at T=12, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 7 turns.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 19, y=9.\n\nH=7.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be from turn 12 to turn 18.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's see the output format.\n\nIt says: Turn t_1: a_{t1} etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? No.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier if we start from different action, but no, minimum 7 moves.\n\nSuppose we go down to y=1 at some point, but that would require going up later, more steps.\n\nOr stay, but staying doesn't help, since we need to move up.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nBut in the occupied, at T=13, y=5,6,7 unsafe, but we avoid by being at y=3.\n\nIf we stayed at y=2 at T=13, also safe, but then we need one more up later, but no, from y=2, if we stay at T=12 action S, then at T=13 y=2, safe, then we go up to y=3 at T=14, etc., then we reach y=9 at turn 19 still? Let's see.\n\nIf at T=12, S: y_{13}=2\n\nT=13: y=2, safe\n\na_{13}=U, y_{14}=3\n\nT=14: y=3, safe\n\na_{14}=U, y_{15}=4\n\n...\n\nThen y_{15}=4, y_{16}=5, y_{17}=6, y_{18}=7, y_{19}=8, then need another action to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nSo with a stay, we take 8 actions to reach, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if down, even worse.\n\nSo all U is best.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from turn 12 to 18.\n\nBut turn 18 action leads to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the car list, for freeway 1 and 2, there is a car at (18,7,right,6), but at T=12, L=7+0=7, R=18, not cover 0, and only car A covers 0 at 17,18.\n\nBut we are not on y=1 or 2 at 17,18.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the answer should be the sequence of U actions.\n\nBut to write in the box.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 12: U \\\\  \nTurn 13: U \\\\  \nTurn 14: U \\\\  \nTurn 15: U \\\\  \nTurn 16: U \\\\  \nTurn 17: U \\\\  \nTurn 18: U  \n}\n\nBut let's confirm the number: from turn 12 to 18 inclusive, that's 7 turns.\n\nt=0 to 6, 7 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we need to specify H, but in the answer, it's the sequence, and H is implied.\n\nThe task says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it's just the sequence, I think H is the number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, it has H actions.\n\nIn the box, it's the actions.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at x=0\nThe occupancy of x=0 for each freeway at each turn is determined based on the car positions and movements. All cars are moving right, so for a car with tail \\(\\tau\\), head \\(h\\), speed \\(s\\), and direction right, the span at turn \\(T\\) is \\([\\tau + s(T - 12), h + s(T - 12)]\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) on freeway \\(k\\) if \\(0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway.\n\n- **Freeway 1**: Occupied at turns \\(T = 17\\) and \\(T = 18\\).\n- **Freeway 2**: Occupied at turns \\(T = 17\\) and \\(T = 18\\) (same cars as freeway 1).\n- **Freeway 3**: Never occupied.\n- **Freeway 4**: Never occupied (same as freeway 3).\n- **Freeway 5**: Occupied at turn \\(T = 13\\).\n- **Freeway 6**: Occupied at turn \\(T = 13\\) (same cars as freeway 5).\n- **Freeway 7**: Occupied at turn \\(T = 13\\) (same cars as freeway 5).\n- **Freeway 8**: Never occupied.\n\n### Path to Minimize Turns\nThe player must move from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\), requiring a net change of +7 in the y-coordinate. Since each action changes y by at most 1, a minimum of 7 actions (H = 7) is required. The sequence of actions must avoid being on an occupied freeway at the corresponding turn.\n\n- At turn 12, the player is at \\(y = 2\\), which is safe (freeway 2 is not occupied at T=12).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 13 is safe (freeway 3 is never occupied).\n- Continuing up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 14 is safe (freeway 4 is never occupied).\n- Moving to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 15 is safe (freeway 5 is occupied only at T=13, not T=15).\n- Moving to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16 is safe (freeway 6 is occupied only at T=13, not T=16).\n- Moving to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17 is safe (freeway 7 is occupied only at T=13, not T=17).\n- Moving to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18 is safe (freeway 8 is never occupied).\n- After the action at turn 18, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19, which is safe (no freeway at y=9).\n\nThis path uses all \"U\" (up) actions, achieving the goal in 7 turns (H = 7) with no collisions. Any deviation (e.g., moving down or staying) would require more turns or risk collision, so this is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 12\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 18\\) is all \"U\":\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 12: U \\\\  \nTurn 13: U \\\\  \nTurn 14: U \\\\  \nTurn 15: U \\\\  \nTurn 16: U \\\\  \nTurn 17: U \\\\  \nTurn 18: U  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 through 8. The cars are moving, and I have to avoid being on a row when a car spans x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For each car, given its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t1=13, I can find where it will be at any future turn T.\n\nThe car update is given by:\n\n- Left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it lists the cars with (head, tail, direction, speed). Direction is given as \"right\" or I assume \"left\", but in the table, all are \"right\" in this case. Let me check.\n\nFor freeway 1: both cars are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 2: same, both right.\n\nFreeway 3: one car, right-moving.\n\nFreeway 4: one car, right-moving.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars, all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 6: three, all right.\n\nFreeway 7: three, all right.\n\nFreeway 8: one, right-moving.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so I'll use the right-moving formula: span at T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, I am not on the new row until the next turn. So if at turn T I move from y to y+1, I am on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1. So for collision at turn T, I care about the car on row y_T at that turn.\n\nt1 is the starting turn, which is 13. Player position at t1 is (0,3), so at turn 13, I am on row 3.\n\nI need to get to row 9.\n\nEach action U, D, S changes y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nSince I start at 3 and need to go to 9, I need to increase y by 6. The minimal number of turns would be at least 6 if I only go up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 6.\n\nBut let's see the car positions to find when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nFirst, let's define the time from t1. Set t = 0 as the current turn, so at time t=0, turn is t1=13, y=3.\n\nThen at time t (after t steps), the turn number is t1 + t.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll work with t relative to t1. So t=0: current.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions a_t for t=0 to H-1 such that at time H-1, y = 9? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nAt turn T, player position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_t at turn T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t1 to t1 + H -1, and after H actions, we reach (0,9).\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1}, at turn (t1+H-1)+1 = t1+H, we have position, but we need y_{t1 + H -1} = 9? Let's see.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nWe start at turn t1 with y_{t1} = 3.\n\nAfter H actions: we perform a_{t1}, then a_{t1+1}, ..., up to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nAfter a_{t1+H-1}, at turn (t1+H-1)+1 = t1+H, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), which I think means at some turn, y=9.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet's read: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the sequence: {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t1+H-1, at turn t1+H, position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut y_{t1+H} = y_{t1 + (H)} , which is after H actions.\n\nAt time t relative to t1:\n\n- At turn t1 + t, position y_{t1 + t}\n\n- We choose action a_{t1 + t}, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t1 + t + 1} = y_{t1 + t} + Δy_t\n\nWe start with y_{t1} at turn t1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have performed actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1, so the last position set is y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, meaning at turn t1+H-1, we are at position 9.\n\nThen we don't necessarily take an action at that turn? Let's see.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9 means at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nThen the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-2? I'm confused.\n\nLet me denote the turns:\n\nTurn T: position y_T, we choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nAt turn T, we are on row y_T, and collision is checked based on cars at that turn.\n\nWe start at T = t1, y_T = 3.\n\nWe want to be at y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H-1 actions, we are at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then we have one action a_{t1}, then at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1} is set. But we want y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{t1} for H=1, but y_{t1} =3 ≠9, so not.\n\nH is the number of turns we take actions, and we want at the turn when we take the last action, we are at 9? Let's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\" such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9 means at turn t1 + H - 1, the player is at position 9.\n\nAnd the actions are taken from t1 to t1+H-1, so at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and we take an action, but the position is already 9 before the action? No.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1} =9, and we take action a_{t1+H-1}, which may move us to y_{t1+H}, but we don't care as long as we are at 9 at that turn.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn, and we stop.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, so we have reached the goal at that turn.\n\nThe actions include the action at that turn, which might move us away, but since we are at 9 at the start of the turn, I think it's fine, as long as we don't collide when at 9.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on position at that turn.\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, we are on row 9, and we need no collision there.\n\nThen we take an action, but since we are already at 9, and we stop, the action might not matter, but we have to specify it as part of the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include a_{t1+H-1}, which is the action at the turn when we are at 9.\n\nFor the position, at that turn, before action, we are at 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t1, we start at 3, take action.\n\nFor H=6, if I go up every turn, at turn t1+5, y=3+5=8, take U, then at turn t1+6, y=9. But at turn t1+5, I am at 8, not 9. Let's see the turn indices.\n\nSet T = t1 + t for t=0,1,2,... so at t=0, T=t1, y=3\n\nAfter action a0, y1 = y0 + Δy0\n\nAt t=1, T=t1+1, y1, take a1, y2 = y1 + Δy1\n\n...\n\nAt t=k, T=t1+k, y_k, take a_k, y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k\n\nWe want for some k, y_k =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so k from 0 to H-1.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9 means for k = H-1, y_k =9.\n\nSo at step k=H-1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, k=0, y0=9, but y0=3≠9.\n\nIf H=7, k=6, y6=9.\n\nAt t=0, y0=3\n\nAfter 6 up actions, at t=6, y6 =3+6=9, so k=6, H-1=6, so H=7.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=6, that's 7 actions.\n\nAt turn t1 to t1+6, 7 turns.\n\nPosition at turn t1+6 is y6=9.\n\nYes.\n\nMinimal H without cars would be 7, with 6 up actions and one action at turn when at 9, but since we are at 9, we can do S or something.\n\nBut with cars, it might take longer.\n\nNow, I need to find for each row and each time, whether it is occupied by a car at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k=1 to 8, and for each turn T, whether there is a car on row k with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nSince collision only when on that row at that turn.\n\nFor a given row k and time t (relative to t1, so turn T = t1 + t), I need to check if 0 is in the span of any car on row k at that turn.\n\nThe cars are moving with constant speed.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each row.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: carA: head -24, tail -35, dir right, speed 6\n\ncarB: head 24, tail 13, dir right, speed 6\n\nBoth right-moving.\n\nAt time t relative to t1, turn T = t1 + t.\n\nSince t1=13, T=13+t.\n\nBut for span, it depends on T - t1 = t.\n\nSo span at time t (after t steps from now) is for right-moving car: [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\nBecause T - t1 = t.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right.\n\nSo for freeway 1, carA: τ = -35, h = -24, s=6\n\nSpan at time t: [ -35 + 6t, -24 + 6t ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +6t <= 0 <= -24 +6t\n\nSimilarly, carB: τ=13, h=24, s=6\n\nSpan: [13 +6t, 24 +6t]\n\n0 in span if 13+6t <=0 <=24+6t, but since t>=0, 13+6t >=13>0, so 0 <= 13+6t is false, so 0 not in span for carB at any t, because the span starts at 13+6t >0.\n\nSimilarly, for carA, -35+6t <=0 <= -24+6t\n\nSolve: -35+6t <=0 => 6t <=35 => t <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 +6t => 6t >=24 => t>=4\n\nSo for t=4,5, and t=6? t=4: -35+24= -11 <=0, -24+24=0 <=0, so 0 in [ -11, 0], yes.\n\nt=5: -35+30= -5 <=0, -24+30=6, 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nt=6: -35+36=1 <=0? 1>0, so 1 <=0 false, and 0 <= -24+36=12, but 1>0, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, t=3: -35+18= -17 <=0, 0 <= -24+18= -6? 0 <= -6 false, so no.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied at t=4 and t=5.\n\nt=4 and t=5.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since cars identical: (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6)\n\nSo also occupied at t=4 and t=5.\n\nNow freeway 3: one car: head -48, tail -95, dir right, speed 48.\n\nτ = -95, h = -48, s=48\n\nSpan at t: [ -95 + 48t, -48 + 48t ]\n\n0 in span if -95+48t <=0 <= -48+48t\n\nFirst, -95+48t <=0 => 48t <=95 => t <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond, 0 <= -48+48t => 48t >=48 => t>=1\n\nSo for t=1: -95+48= -47 <=0, 0 <= -48+48=0, so 0 in [-47,0], yes.\n\nt=2: -95+96=1 <=0? false, and 0 <= -48+96=48, but 1>0, so not.\n\nt=1 only.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same car: (-48,-95,right,48), so occupied at t=1 only.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (0, -11, right, 12) head 0, tail -11, s=12\n\nSpan at t: [ -11 + 12t, 0 + 12t ] = [ -11+12t, 12t ]\n\n0 in span: -11+12t <=0 <=12t\n\n-11+12t <=0 => 12t <=11 => t <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916\n\n0 <=12t always true for t>=0, but t<=0.916, so for t=0: -11+0= -11 <=0, 0 <=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nt=1: -11+12=1 <=0? false, not.\n\nSo only t=0.\n\nBut t is time from now, t=0 is current turn.\n\nAt t=0, turn t1=13, we are on row 3, not row 5, so for row 5, at t=0, occupied, but we are not on row 5 at t=0, so no collision for us.\n\nBut for future, when we might be on row 5.\n\nAt t=0, occupied, but for t>0, not occupied.\n\nt=0 only for this car.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12) head 36, tail 25? Head and tail.\n\nIn the state: (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is larger x? In the span, for right-moving, it's [tail + s t, head + s t], and since head > tail for right-moving, I assume.\n\nIn carB for row1, head=24, tail=13, so head > tail.\n\nSimilarly here, (36,25,right,12), so head=36, tail=25.\n\nSpan at t: [25 + 12t, 36 + 12t]\n\n0 in span: 25+12t <=0 <=36+12t\n\nBut 25+12t >=25>0 for t>=0, so 0 <= 25+12t false, so never occupied.\n\nThird car: (-48,-59,right,12) head -48, tail -59? Tail -59, head -48.\n\nSince right-moving, head should be larger, -48 > -59, yes.\n\nSpan at t: [ -59 + 12t, -48 + 12t ]\n\n0 in span if -59+12t <=0 <= -48+12t\n\nFirst: -59+12t <=0 => 12t <=59 => t <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+12t => 12t >=48 => t>=4\n\nSo for t=4: -59+48= -11 <=0, 0 <= -48+48=0, yes.\n\nt=5: -59+60=1 <=0? false, not.\n\nSo for freeway 5, occupied at t=0 (from first car) and t=4 (from third car).\n\nt=0 and t=4.\n\nBut t=0 is now, and at t=0, we are on row 3, not 5.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5, since identical cars: (0,-11,r,12), (36,25,r,12), (-48,-59,r,12)\n\nSo occupied at t=0 and t=4.\n\nFreeway 7: same, occupied at t=0 and t=4.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-48,-95,right,48), same as row 3 and 4.\n\nHead -48, tail -95, s=48.\n\nSpan at t: [ -95 + 48t, -48 + 48t ]\n\n0 in span if -95+48t <=0 <= -48+48t\n\nAs before, t>=1 and t<=1.979, so t=1 only.\n\nNow, summarize for each row and time t when it is occupied (0 in span):\n\nt relative to now, turn T=t1+t.\n\nRow 1: occupied at t=4,5\n\nRow 2: occupied at t=4,5\n\nRow 3: occupied at t=1\n\nRow 4: occupied at t=1\n\nRow 5: occupied at t=0,4\n\nBut t=0 is now, and we are on row 3, not row 5.\n\nRow 6: occupied at t=0,4\n\nRow 7: occupied at t=0,4\n\nRow 8: occupied at t=1\n\nRow 9: no cars, so always safe.\n\nWe need to go from row 3 to row 9.\n\nStart at t=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn, say time k, with y_k=9.\n\nAnd for each turn, when we are on a row, it must not be occupied at that time.\n\nSince row 9 has no cars, when we are on row 9, it's always safe.\n\nBut we need to reach it.\n\nMinimal time: we need to go up 6 steps, so minimal k=6, y=9 at t=6.\n\nBut we have to avoid occupied rows at occupied times.\n\nNow, let's list for each row, the times when it is unsafe (occupied).\n\nRow 1: unsafe at t=4,5\n\nRow 2: unsafe at t=4,5\n\nRow 3: unsafe at t=1\n\nBut at t=0, we are on row 3, and is it occupied?\n\nRow 3: at t=0, is it occupied?\n\nFor row 3, car: at t=0, span [ -95 +0, -48 +0] = [-95,-48], 0 not in, since -48<0? -48 is less than 0, so [-95,-48], all negative, 0 not in, so safe at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, only unsafe at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, row 4: same, unsafe only t=1.\n\nRow 5: unsafe at t=0 and t=4\n\nAt t=0, occupied, but we are not on row 5.\n\nSimilarly, row 6: unsafe t=0 and t=4\n\nRow 7: unsafe t=0 and t=4\n\nRow 8: unsafe t=1\n\nRow 9: always safe.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=3, which is safe, as above.\n\nNow, we need to move to higher rows.\n\nSince we need to go up, and minimal time, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nFor example, row 3 is unsafe at t=1, so we should not be on row 3 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 unsafe at t=1.\n\nAt t=0, we are on row 3.\n\nWe choose action a0, which determines y1.\n\nWe want to not be on row 3 at t=1, because it is unsafe at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 is unsafe at t=1, so we should not be on row 4 at t=1 either.\n\nSo at t=1, we should be on row 2, or row 5, or other.\n\nBut row 5 is unsafe at t=0, but t=0 is past? At t=1, row 5: is it safe?\n\nRow 5 unsafe at t=0 and t=4, so at t=1, it should be safe, since only t=0 and t=4 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 unsafe at t=0 and t=4, so at t=1, safe.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at t=0 and t=4, at t=1 safe.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at t=1, so not safe at t=1.\n\nRow 1 and 2 unsafe at t=4 and 5, but at t=1, they are safe? Let's see.\n\nRow 1: unsafe t=4,5; so at t=1, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly row 2.\n\nRow 9 always safe.\n\nSo at t=1, possible safe rows: row 1,2,5,6,7,9? But we start from row 3, we can only move to adjacent or same.\n\nActions: U, D, S, so y can change by -1,0,+1.\n\nFrom row 3 at t=0, to y1 at t=1.\n\ny1 can be 2,3, or 4.\n\nBut row 3 at t=1 is unsafe, so we cannot stay or move to row 3? y1 cannot be 3.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 at t=1 is unsafe, so y1 cannot be 4.\n\nTherefore, from row 3, we must move down to row 2 at t=1.\n\nBecause if we go up to row 4, unsafe, or stay row 3, unsafe. Only down to row 2 is possible.\n\nRow 2 at t=1: is it safe?\n\nRow 2 unsafe at t=4 and 5, but at t=1, it should be safe, as per above.\n\nYes, row 2 only unsafe at t=4,5, so at t=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 safe at t=1.\n\nSo at t=1, we must be on row 2.\n\nSo action a0 must be D, down to row 2.\n\nThen at t=1, y=2.\n\nNow at t=1, we are on row 2, which is safe.\n\nNow we need to choose action a1.\n\nAt t=1, position y=2.\n\nPossible actions: U to 3, D to 1, S to 2.\n\nNow, row 2 at t=1 is safe, but what about future?\n\nWe need to see where we can go for t=2.\n\nFirst, for t=2, which rows are unsafe.\n\nRow 1: unsafe t=4,5; so at t=2, safe.\n\nRow 2: unsafe t=4,5; at t=2, safe.\n\nRow 3: unsafe only t=1, so at t=2, safe? At t=1 unsafe, but t=2 not, so safe.\n\nRow 4: unsafe only t=1, so at t=2 safe.\n\nRow 5: unsafe t=0,4; t=2 not, so safe.\n\nRow 6: unsafe t=0,4; t=2 safe.\n\nRow 7: unsafe t=0,4; t=2 safe.\n\nRow 8: unsafe t=1; so at t=2, should be safe? t=1 unsafe, but t=2 not, so safe.\n\nRow 9 safe.\n\nAt t=2, all rows are safe, since no row has unsafe at t=2.\n\nRow 1 unsafe only 4,5; row2 only 4,5; row3 only t=1; row4 only t=1; row5 t=0,4; row6 t=0,4; row7 t=0,4; row8 t=1; all not t=2.\n\nSo at t=2, any row is safe.\n\nNow back to t=1, we are on row 2.\n\nWe can go to row 1,2, or 3.\n\nSince we need to go to row 9, we should go up if possible.\n\nBut row 3 at t=2 is safe, as above.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 or row 1.\n\nBut going down might delay.\n\nSo probably go up to row 3.\n\nAt t=1, y=2, take U, so y2=3 at t=2.\n\nNow at t=2, y=3, which is safe.\n\nNow choose action a2 for t=2.\n\nWe need to go to t=3.\n\nAt t=3, which rows unsafe.\n\nRow 1: unsafe t=4,5; t=3 not, so safe.\n\nRow 2: same, safe at t=3.\n\nRow 3: unsafe t=1; t=3 not, safe.\n\nRow 4: unsafe t=1; t=3 not, safe.\n\nRow 5: unsafe t=0,4; t=3 not, so safe? t=0 and t=4, t=3 not, so safe.\n\nRow 6: same, safe.\n\nRow 7: same, safe.\n\nRow 8: unsafe t=1; t=3 not, safe.\n\nRow 9 safe.\n\nSo all safe at t=3.\n\nWe can go up to row 4.\n\nFrom row 3, take U, y3=4 at t=3.\n\nNow at t=3, y=4, safe.\n\nNow action a3 for t=3.\n\nTo t=4.\n\nAt t=4, which rows unsafe.\n\nRow 1: unsafe at t=4, so occupied.\n\nRow 2: unsafe at t=4, occupied.\n\nRow 3: unsafe only t=1, t=4 not, so safe.\n\nRow 4: unsafe only t=1, t=4 not, safe.\n\nRow 5: unsafe at t=4, occupied.\n\nRow 6: unsafe at t=4, occupied.\n\nRow 7: unsafe at t=4, occupied.\n\nRow 8: unsafe t=1, t=4 not, safe? Row 8 unsafe only at t=1, so at t=4 safe.\n\nRow 9 safe.\n\nSo at t=4, unsafe rows: 1,2,5,6,7.\n\nSafe rows: 3,4,8,9.\n\nNow at t=3, we are on row 4.\n\nWe need to choose y4 for t=4.\n\nPossible: U to 5, D to 3, S to 4.\n\nBut row 5 is unsafe at t=4, so we cannot go to row 5.\n\nRow 4 at t=4 is safe, as above.\n\nRow 3 at t=4 is safe.\n\nSo we can stay on row 4 or go down to row 3.\n\nSince we need to go up eventually, staying might be better, but let's see.\n\nIf we go up to row 5, but row 5 unsafe at t=4, so we cannot be on row 5 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to row 3, safe.\n\nOr stay row 4, safe.\n\nBut row 4 is safe at t=4, so we can stay.\n\nThen at t=4, y=4.\n\nThen later we need to go up, but rows 5,6,7 are unsafe at t=4, and also at other times.\n\nt=4 is the only time they are unsafe except row 5 also unsafe at t=0, but t=0 past.\n\nAfter t=4, we can go up.\n\nBut let's see t=5.\n\nAt t=5, which rows unsafe.\n\nRow 1: unsafe at t=5, occupied.\n\nRow 2: unsafe at t=5, occupied.\n\nRow 3: unsafe only t=1, t=5 not, safe.\n\nRow 4: unsafe only t=1, t=5 not, safe.\n\nRow 5: unsafe at t=0 and t=4, t=5 not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly row 6: unsafe t=0,4; t=5 not, safe.\n\nRow 7: unsafe t=0,4; t=5 not, safe.\n\nRow 8: unsafe t=1, t=5 not, safe.\n\nRow 9 safe.\n\nSo at t=5, unsafe rows: 1 and 2.\n\nSafe: all others.\n\nNow back to t=4.\n\nAt t=4, if we are on row 4, we can choose to go to row 3,4, or 5.\n\nBut row 5 is safe at t=5? At t=4, we choose action for y at t=5.\n\nPosition at t=5 depends on action at t=4.\n\nAt turn t=4, we are on y4, choose a4, then y5 = y4 + Δy.\n\ny5 is position at t=5.\n\nWe need to be on a safe row at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, safe rows are 3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nUnsafe only 1 and 2.\n\nNow at t=4, we are on row 4 (if we stayed or moved).\n\nEarlier at t=3, we are on row 4.\n\nWe can:\n\n- Go down to row 3: then at t=4, y=3, which is safe (since row 3 safe at t=4).\n\nThen at t=4, choose action.\n\n- Stay on row 4: at t=4, y=4, safe.\n\n- Go up to row 5: but at t=4, row 5 is unsafe, so if we go to row 5 at t=4, collision.\n\nWe cannot go to row 5 at t=4.\n\nSo only options: go down to row 3 or stay on row 4 at t=4.\n\nNow, if we go down to row 3 at t=4, then at t=4, y=3.\n\nThen we can choose action to go to, say, row 4 or row 2 or row 3 at t=5.\n\nBut row 2 unsafe at t=5, so not row 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay on row 4 at t=4, then we can go to row 3,4,5 at t=5.\n\nSince we need to go up, and row 5 is safe at t=5, we might want to go up.\n\nBut let's plan the path.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as soon as possible.\n\nCurrently at t=3, y=4.\n\nIf we stay on row 4 at t=4, then at t=4, we are on row 4.\n\nThen at t=4, we can take U to go to row 5 at t=5.\n\nSince row 5 safe at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, y=5.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nIf we went down to row 3 at t=4, then at t=4, y=3, then we might go to row 4 at t=5 or up, but row 4 safe at t=5.\n\nBut going down might add delay.\n\nSo better to stay on row 4 at t=4 and then go up.\n\nNow, at t=4, if we stay on row 4, it is safe, as established.\n\nThen at t=4, we take U, so y5 =5 at t=5.\n\nNow at t=5, y=5, which is safe.\n\nNow we need to go to row 9.\n\nWe are at row 5 at t=5.\n\nNow action at t=5 to go to t=6.\n\nAt t=6, which rows unsafe.\n\nFirst, row 1: unsafe t=4,5; t=6 not, safe.\n\nRow 2: same, safe.\n\nRow 3: unsafe t=1; t=6 not, safe.\n\nRow 4: same, safe.\n\nRow 5: unsafe t=0,4; t=6 not, safe.\n\nRow 6: unsafe t=0,4; t=6 not, safe.\n\nRow 7: unsafe t=0,4; t=6 not, safe.\n\nRow 8: unsafe t=1; t=6 not, safe.\n\nRow 9 safe.\n\nAll safe at t=6.\n\nWe can go up to row 6.\n\nTake U, y6=6 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, y=6, safe.\n\nAction to t=7.\n\nAt t=7, all should be safe, similar reasons.\n\nGo up, y7=7 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=7, safe.\n\nAction to t=8.\n\nAt t=8, all safe, go up, y8=8 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=8, safe.\n\nAction to t=9.\n\nGo up, y9=9 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=9 at some turn, here at t=9.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nt=9, but we started at t=0.\n\nWe need H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nHere at t=9, y=9, so k=9, H-1=9, so H=10.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9, that's 10 actions.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nt relative to t1: t=0 to t=9, positions:\n\nt=0: y=3\n\na0: D (down to 2)\n\nt=1: y=2\n\na1: U (up to 3)\n\nt=2: y=3\n\na2: U (up to 4)\n\nt=3: y=4\n\na3: S? At t=3, we are at y=4, and we need to stay or down, but we decided to stay.\n\nEarlier: at t=3, after a2, y3=4 at t=3.\n\nThen a3: since we are at y=4, and for t=4, we stay on row 4, so action S.\n\nThen t=4: y=4\n\nThen a4: U to 5\n\nt=5: y=5\n\na5: U to 6\n\nt=6: y=6\n\na6: U to 7\n\nt=7: y=7\n\na7: U to 8\n\nt=8: y=8\n\na8: U to 9\n\nt=9: y=9\n\nSo at turn t1 +9, y=9.\n\nNow, H-1=9, so H=10.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nMinimal steps: from 3 to 9, need 6 up moves, but we have detour to row 2 at first.\n\nAt t=0, we had to go down to row 2 because row 3 and 4 unsafe at t=1.\n\nBut perhaps we can go directly later.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, we go down to row 2.\n\nThen at t=1, we are on row 2, safe.\n\nInstead of going up to row 3 at t=2, we could go up faster.\n\nBut at t=1, from row 2, we can go to row 3 directly at t=2? t=2 row 3 is safe.\n\nIn my sequence, I did go to row 3 at t=2.\n\nt=2 y=3.\n\nThen to row 4 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, we stayed on row 4 for t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, rows 5,6,7 are unsafe, so we cannot go up immediately.\n\nWe stayed on row 4 at t=4, then at t=5 went to row 5.\n\nt=5 row 5 is safe.\n\nThen up each turn to row 9 at t=9.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, at t=3, we are on row 4.\n\nInstead of staying, if we go down to row 3 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, y=3.\n\nThen at t=4, we can go to row 4 at t=5, since row 4 safe at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, y=4.\n\nThen we need to go to row 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut row 5 is safe at t=5, so we can go up to row 5 at t=6? Let's see.\n\nAt t=4, y=3.\n\nChoose action: to y5.\n\ny5 can be 2,3,4.\n\nBut row 2 unsafe at t=5, so cannot go to row 2.\n\nRow 3 safe at t=5, row 4 safe.\n\nSo we can go to row 4 at t=5, for example.\n\nThen at t=5, y=4.\n\nThen we can go to row 5 at t=6.\n\nt=6 row 5 safe.\n\nThen to row 6 at t=7, row 7 at t=8, row 8 at t=9, row 9 at t=10.\n\ny at t=10=9.\n\nBut this is later, t=10 vs previous t=9.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt t=4, if on row 3, go directly to row 4 at t=5, then to row 5 at t=6, etc., up to row 9 at t=10.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we reached at t=9.\n\nIn first sequence, at t=5 y=5, t=6 y=6, t=7 y=7, t=8 y=8, t=9 y=9.\n\nt=9.\n\nNow, can we reach at t=8 or earlier?\n\nSuppose we want y=9 at t=8.\n\nThen we need to be at row 9 at t=8.\n\nBut from start, t=0 y=3.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=8, we need net +6 in 8 steps, so average, but we can have down moves.\n\nBut with down moves, it might take more turns.\n\nMinimal time to +6 is 6 steps, but with obstacles.\n\nt=8 is 8 steps from t=0.\n\nAt t=0, we must go down to row 2 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=2.\n\nIf we go up to row 3 at t=2.\n\nt=2 y=3.\n\nThen to row 4 at t=3.\n\nt=3 y=4.\n\nNow at t=3, if we could go directly to row 5, but row 5 unsafe at t=4, and we are at t=3, action to y at t=4.\n\nIf we go up to row 5 at t=4, but row 5 unsafe at t=4, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo to row 3 at t=4, but then at t=4 y=3.\n\nThen to row 4 at t=5, y=4 at t=5.\n\nThen to row 5 at t=6, y=5 at t=6.\n\nThen to row 6 at t=7, y=6 at t=7.\n\nTo row 7 at t=8, y=7 at t=8.\n\nBut we need y=9, only at row 7.\n\nNot yet at 9.\n\nTo reach row 9 at t=8, we need to be at row 9 at t=8.\n\nBut from row 7 at t=8, we can go to row 8 or 9 at t=9.\n\nCannot be at row 9 at t=8 if we are at row 7.\n\nAt t=3, y=4, if we stay, y=4 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, go to row 5 at t=5, y=5 at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, go to row 6 at t=6, y=6 at t=6.\n\nThen row 7 at t=7, y=7 t=7.\n\nRow 8 at t=8, y=8 t=8.\n\nThen row 9 at t=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at some point we go up faster.\n\nFor example, after t=1, at y=2.\n\nAt t=1, instead of going to row 3 at t=2, go directly to row 4? But from row 2, we can only go to row 1,2,3 at t=2.\n\nCannot jump to row 4.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nPerhaps we can go to row 1 or something, but that might be worse.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, we go down to row 2.\n\nThen at t=1, we are on row 2.\n\nInstead of going up, we stay or go down? But going down to row 1 at t=2.\n\nBut row 1 is safe at t=2, but then we are lower.\n\nThen at t=2, from row 1, we can go to row 2 at t=3, etc., but slower.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the first sequence seems efficient.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at t=9.\n\nIs t=8 possible?\n\nSuppose we start at t=0 y=3, go down to row 2 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, from row 2, go up to row 3 at t=2? But row 3 at t=2 is safe.\n\ny=3 at t=2.\n\nThen from row 3, at t=2, go up to row 4 at t=3.\n\ny=4 at t=3.\n\nNow, at t=3, we are on row 4.\n\nNow, we need to be at row 9 at t=8.\n\nBut from row 4 to row 9 in 5 steps: need +5, so we must go up every step from now on, no down or stay.\n\nBut at t=3 to t=4, we cannot go up to row 5 because row 5 unsafe at t=4.\n\nWe must stay or go down.\n\nIf we stay at row 4 for t=4, then at t=4 y=4.\n\nThen at t=4, we go to row 5 at t=5, y=5 at t=5.\n\nThen from t=5 to t=6, to row 6, y=6 t=6.\n\nt=6 to t=7, to row 7, y=7 t=7.\n\nt=7 to t=8, to row 8, y=8 t=8.\n\nBut we are at row 8 at t=8, not row 9.\n\nTo be at row 9 at t=8, we need to be at row 9 at turn t=8.\n\nBut from row 8 at t=7, we can go to row 9 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=7, we are at row 7, not row 8.\n\nIn the above, at t=7 y=7, so to row 8 at t=8.\n\nThen to row 9 at t=9.\n\nCannot reach row 9 at t=8.\n\nIf we can be at higher row earlier.\n\nBut we are constrained.\n\nAt t=4, if we are on row 4, and we go to row 5 at t=5.\n\nBut at t=5, row 5 is safe, but we are at row 5.\n\nThen to row 6 at t=6, etc.\n\nNo way to skip.\n\nPerhaps from row 4 at t=3, go down to row 3 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, y=3.\n\nThen at t=4, go to row 4 at t=5, y=4 at t=5.\n\nThen to row 5 at t=6, y=5 t=6.\n\nThen to row 6 at t=7, y=6 t=7.\n\nTo row 7 at t=8, y=7 t=8.\n\nStill not row 9.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo indeed, the earliest is to reach row 9 at t=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=9 we are at row 9.\n\nNow, we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have:\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to 9, actions.\n\nt1=13.\n\nSo turn 13: action a_{t1} = D (since we go down)\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=10, so actions at turn 13 to 22.\n\ny at turn 22? Let's list the turns.\n\nTurn T: action a_T, then y_{T+1}\n\nBut position at turn T is y_T.\n\nIn the sequence, we list actions at each turn.\n\nFor turn T, we list a_T.\n\nIn the sequence: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, etc.\n\nIn our case, t1=13.\n\nAt turn 13: position y=3, we take action D, so y_{14} = 3 -1 =2\n\nAt turn 14: position y=2, take action U, so y_{15} =2+1=3\n\nAt turn 15: position y=3, take action U, so y_{16} =3+1=4\n\nAt turn 16: position y=4, take action S (stay), so y_{17} =4+0=4\n\nAt turn 17: position y=4, take action U, so y_{18} =4+1=5\n\nAt turn 18: position y=5, take action U, so y_{19} =5+1=6\n\nAt turn 19: position y=6, take action U, so y_{20} =6+1=7\n\nAt turn 20: position y=7, take action U, so y_{21} =7+1=8\n\nAt turn 21: position y=8, take action U, so y_{22} =8+1=9\n\nAt turn 22: position y=9, which is the goal.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =13 +10 -1=22, y=9, yes.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn 13 to turn 22? t1 to t1+H-1=13 to 13+9=22? H=10, t from 0 to 9, turns t1+0 to t1+9=13 to 22.\n\nAction at turn 22: a_{22}, which is U, and after that y_{23}=9, but we don't care.\n\nBut at turn 22, position is y=8 (from above), we take U to go to 9.\n\nAnd at turn 22, we are on row 8, which is safe? At t=9 relative, row 8 safe.\n\nThen at turn 23, position y=9, but we don't take action there.\n\nIn the sequence, we have action at turn 22, which is the last.\n\nBut y_{t1+H-1} = y_{22} =8? I think I confused.\n\nt relative to t1: t=0, turn 13, y=3\n\nt=1, turn 14, y=2\n\n...\n\nt=9, turn 22, y=9? In my earlier, at t=9, turn 22, y=9.\n\nIn the position list:\n\nt=0: turn 13, y=3\n\nafter a0=D, y at turn 14: 2\n\nt=1: turn 14, y=2\n\na1=U, y turn 15:3\n\nt=2: turn 15, y=3\n\na2=U, y turn 16:4\n\nt=3: turn 16, y=4\n\na3=S, y turn 17:4\n\nt=4: turn 17, y=4\n\na4=U, y turn 18:5\n\nt=5: turn 18, y=5\n\na5=U, y turn 19:6\n\nt=6: turn 19, y=6\n\na6=U, y turn 20:7\n\nt=7: turn 20, y=7\n\na7=U, y turn 21:8\n\nt=8: turn 21, y=8\n\na8=U, y turn 22:9\n\nt=9: turn 22, y=9\n\nYes, at turn 22, position y=9.\n\nAnd we took action a_{22} at turn 22? In the sequence, for turn 22, we need to specify action, but at turn 22, we are at y=9, and we might take an action, but since we are already at 9, we can take S or something.\n\nIn the sequence, action at turn t1+H-1 = t1+9=22.\n\nAt turn 22, position y=9, we can take action S, for example.\n\nThen y_{23}=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the output, we need to list actions from turn 13 to turn 22.\n\nNow, for turn 22, since we are at 9, and goal is reached at this turn, we can choose any action, but probably S to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at turn 21, we were at y=8, took U to go to 9 at turn 22.\n\nAt turn 22, we are at y=9, so for action at turn 22, we can take S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nBut let's list all actions:\n\nTurn 13: a_{13} = D  (to go down to row 2)\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U  (up to row 3)\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U  (up to row 4)\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = S  (stay on row 4)\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U  (up to row 5)\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U  (up to row 6)\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U  (up to row 7)\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U  (up to row 8)\n\nTurn 21: a_{21} = U  (up to row 9)\n\nTurn 22: a_{22} = S  (stay, since at row 9)\n\nAt turn 21: position y=8 (from turn 20 action), take U, so at turn 22 position y=9.\n\nThen at turn 22, we take action S, so y_{23}=9.\n\nBut we don't need beyond.\n\nIn the sequence, action at turn 22 is included.\n\nNow, H=10.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose we reach at t=8 relative.\n\ny=9 at t=8.\n\nThen from t=0 to t=8, 8 steps.\n\nStart y=3 at t=0.\n\nMust go down to row 2 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1 y=2.\n\nThen to, say, row 3 at t=2.\n\ny=3 at t=2.\n\nThen to row 4 at t=3.\n\ny=4 at t=3.\n\nNow at t=3, to go to row 5 at t=4 impossible, row 5 unsafe.\n\nMust go to row 3 or 4 at t=4.\n\nSuppose to row 4 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4 y=4.\n\nThen to row 5 at t=5, y=5 at t=5.\n\nThen to row 6 at t=6, y=6 t=6.\n\nTo row 7 at t=7, y=7 t=7.\n\nTo row 8 at t=8, y=8 t=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nIf at t=4, from row 4 go to row 5 at t=5, same.\n\nAfter t=1 y=2, at t=1 go to row 3 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, from row 3, go to row 4 at t=3.\n\nSame.\n\nAt t=1, go down to row 1 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2 y=1.\n\nThen go to row 2 at t=3, but row 2 unsafe at t=4 and 5, but at t=3 safe? Row 2 unsafe t=4,5, so at t=3 safe.\n\ny=2 at t=3.\n\nThen to row 3 at t=4, y=3 at t=4.\n\nThen to row 4 at t=5, y=4 at t=5.\n\nThen to row 5 at t=6, etc., even slower.\n\nSo cannot reach before t=9.\n\nThus minimal H=10.\n\nNow, in the action sequence, for turn 22, since we are at row 9, we can do S.\n\nBut in the sequence I have action at turn 21: U to go to 9, and turn 22: S to stay.\n\nBut we could have reached row 9 earlier? No.\n\nAnother point: at t=3, when we were on row 4, we stayed for t=4.\n\nBut row 4 at t=4 is safe.\n\nWe could have gone down to row 3 at t=4, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at t=3, go down to row 3 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, y=3.\n\nThen at t=4, go to row 4 at t=5 (since cannot go to row 2, unsafe at t=5).\n\nThen y=4 at t=5.\n\nThen to row 5 at t=6, y=5 t=6.\n\nThen to row 6 at t=7, y=6 t=7.\n\nTo row 7 at t=8, y=7 t=8.\n\nTo row 8 at t=9, y=8 t=9.\n\nTo row 9 at t=10, y=9 t=10.\n\nThen H=11, worse.\n\nSo first sequence is better.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the answer format.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nIn the sequence, turn 22 action is S, but at turn 22 we are already at 9, so S is fine.\n\nSince we reach at turn 22, and action at turn 22 is not necessary for reaching, but we include it.\n\nIn the problem, the sequence includes actions until we reach, and at the turn when we reach, we take an action.\n\nBut in this case, with H=10, we have 10 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions to ensure no collision.\n\nFor example, at turn 13 (t=0), y=3, row 3 safe? At t=0, row 3: car span [-95,-48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction D, to row 2.\n\nTurn 14 (t=1), y=2, row 2: at t=1, row 2 should be safe, as earlier. Cars: for row 2, similar to row 1, occupied at t=4,5, not t=1. Span at t=1: carA [-35+6(1), -24+6(1)] = [-29,-18], 0 not in; carB [13+6,24+6]=[19,30], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nAction U to row 3.\n\nTurn 15 (t=2), y=3, row 3: at t=2, span [ -95+48(2), -48+48(2)] = [-95+96, -48+96]=[1,48], 0 not in, since min=1>0. Safe.\n\nAction U to row 4.\n\nTurn 16 (t=3), y=4, row 4: similarly, car same as row 3, span at t=3: [-95+48(3), -48+48(3)] = [-95+144, -48+144]=[49,96], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nAction S, stay row 4.\n\nTurn 17 (t=4), y=4, row 4: at t=4, row 4 car: span [ -95+48(4), -48+48(4)] = [-95+192, -48+192]=[97,144], 0 not in. Also, row 4 only unsafe at t=1, so safe.\n\nBut row 4 has one car, same as row 3.\n\nAction U to row 5.\n\nBut at turn 17, t=4 relative, position y=4, we take U, so at next turn y=5.\n\nBut at turn 17 (t=4), we are on row 4, which is safe.\n\nNow, row 5 at t=4 is unsafe, but we are not on row 5 at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17, we are on row 4.\n\nAfter action, at turn 18, position y=5.\n\nTurn 18 (t=5), y=5, row 5: at t=5, row 5 unsafe at t=0 and t=4, not t=5. Spans: first car (0,-11,r,12) at t=5: [ -11+12(5), 0+12(5)] = [-11+60, 60] = [49,60], 0 not in; second car (36,25,r,12): [25+60,36+60]=[85,96], 0 not; third car (-48,-59,r,12): [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12], 0 not in, since min=1>0. So safe.\n\nAction U to row 6.\n\nSimilarly, turn 19 (t=6), y=6, row 6: at t=6, similar to row 5, spans: first car [ -11+72, 72] = [61,72], 0 not; second [25+72,36+72]=[97,108]; third [-59+72, -48+72]=[13,24], all no 0. Safe.\n\nU to row 7.\n\nTurn 20 (t=7), y=7, row 7: similarly, safe, U to row 8.\n\nTurn 21 (t=8), y=8, row 8: at t=8, car (-48,-95,r,48), span [ -95+48(8), -48+48(8)] = [-95+384, -48+384]=[289,336], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nAction U to row 9.\n\nTurn 22 (t=9), y=9, row 9 no cars, safe. Action S.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at turn 21, we take U to go to row 9 at turn 22.\n\nAt turn 22, we take S.\n\nBut we could have taken S at turn 21 if we were at row 9, but we were not.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose we are at row 9 at turn 21 (t=8 relative).\n\ny=9 at t=8.\n\nThen from t=0 y=3 to t=8 y=9, net +6 in 8 steps, so possible with two extra actions, but we have to use them for avoiding.\n\nBut in this case, we had to go down at start, which cost one down, so net we need 7 up and one down, but in terms of position, we need to be at higher row faster.\n\nFor example, at t=1, we are at row 2.\n\nIf we could be at row 4 at t=2, but cannot, only one step.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps stay at some point.\n\nBut I think not possible.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10. The sequence of actions from turn 13 to turn 22 ensures the player reaches row 9 at turn 22 without any collisions.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- At turn 13, move down (D) to avoid row 3 at turn 14 (which is unsafe due to cars on row 3 and 4 at \\(t = 1\\) relative to \\(t_1\\)).\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to row 3, which is safe at \\(t = 2\\).\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to row 4, which is safe at \\(t = 3\\).\n- At turn 16, stay (S) on row 4 to avoid row 5 at turn 17 (which is unsafe at \\(t = 4\\) relative to \\(t_1\\)).\n- At turn 17, move up (U) to row 5, which is safe at \\(t = 5\\).\n- From turns 18 to 21, move up (U) consecutively to rows 6, 7, 8, and finally 9, as these rows are safe at the respective times.\n- At turn 22, stay (S) on row 9, as the goal is reached and row 9 has no cars.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: D \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: S \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 14, and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y same). Note that y must stay in [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Importantly, when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is only on freeway y_T at turn T (so we check the car on y_T at turn T). At the next turn, when we move, we are then on y_{T+1} for that turn.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn t1 (14) to turn t1+H-1 such that at the end we are at y=9.\n\nGiven car states (for freeways 1 to 8) at turn t1=14:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: \n  car1: (-18, -29, right, 6) -> moving right, so span at time t: [tau + s*(t-t1), h + s*(t-t1)] \n        Actually, note the representation: for right-moving, the head is the larger number? But the problem says: \n        Right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n        Here, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But note: in the right-moving example, the head is the front (which is at a larger x). \n        So for the first car: head=-18, tail=-29? That seems odd because -18 > -29. So actually, the representation might be (head, tail) regardless of direction? \n        However, the update rule distinguishes: \n          Left-moving: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(dt), tau - s*(dt)]\n          Right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(dt), h + s*(dt)]\n\n        But the input format says: (head, tail, direction, speed). We must interpret:\n\n        For a right-moving car: the head is the front (larger x) and tail is the rear (smaller x). So the span is [tail, head].\n        For a left-moving car: the head is the front (which would be the one with smaller x if moving left) and tail the rear? Actually, the update rule for left uses [h, tau] and moves both left.\n\n        However, looking at the given data: \n          Freeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 6) -> since it's right-moving, the head should be the larger? But -18 is larger than -29. So the head is -18 and tail is -29. \n          Then the span at t1=14 is [tail, head] = [-29, -18]? But the update rule for right says: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So at t1=14, we have tau=-29, h=-18.\n\n        Similarly, the second car: (30,19,right,6) -> but 30>19, so if head is 30 and tail is 19? Then the span is [19,30]. But wait, that doesn't make sense because 19<30 and right-moving should have the head (front) at the right. So the representation is (head, tail) with head being the front (larger for right, smaller for left?).\n\n        Actually, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So in the input, the first number is head and the second is tail? But then for right, the span is [tail, head] meaning the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n          Right-moving: the car moves to the right. The head is the front (which is at a larger x-coordinate) and the tail is at a smaller x. So the entire car is from [tail, head] (with tail < head). \n          Left-moving: the car moves to the left. The head is the front (which is at a smaller x-coordinate) and the tail is at a larger x. So the entire car is from [head, tail] (with head < tail).\n\n        But the update rule for left is given as: [h, tau] -> [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So if head is the front (smaller x) and tail is the rear (larger x), then the span [h, tau] would be [small, large] and then subtracting moves both left.\n\n        However, in the input, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\n        Therefore, for a right-moving car: head is the front (larger x) and tail is the rear (smaller x). The span is [tail, head].\n        For a left-moving car: head is the front (smaller x) and tail is the rear (larger x). The span is [head, tail].\n\n        But note: in the update rule for left, the problem writes: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\". So for left, we have [h, tau] meaning [head, tail] and then we update by subtracting s*dt from both.\n\n        So for the given cars:\n\n        Freeway 1: \n          car1: right, head=-18, tail=-29 -> span at t1: [ -29, -18 ]\n          car2: right, head=30, tail=19 -> but wait, 30>19? Actually, that would imply the car is from 19 to 30? But then tail=19 and head=30? But that contradicts because tail should be less than head? However, 19<30, so that's okay. But the input says (head, tail) = (30,19) -> so head=30, tail=19 -> that matches (tail=19, head=30) -> so the car spans [19,30] at t1=14? But wait, the problem says for right: the span is [tail, head] = [19,30]. \n\n        However, note the second car: (30,19,right,6): if we interpret as (head, tail) then head=30, tail=19 -> so the car is from 19 to 30? That makes sense.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \n          Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> so tau is the tail and h is the head? Then in the input, the first number is head? and the second is tail? \n\n        Actually, the input format says: (head, tail, direction, speed). So:\n\n          For right: the span is [tail, head] (because tail < head) -> so the car covers [tail, head].\n          For left: the span is [head, tail] (because head < tail) -> so the car covers [head, tail].\n\n        Therefore, for each car, we can compute the span at any future turn T (relative to t1=14) as:\n\n          dt = T - 14\n\n          For right: \n             new_tail = tail + s * dt\n             new_head = head + s * dt\n             span = [new_tail, new_head]\n\n          For left:\n             new_head = head - s * dt\n             new_tail = tail - s * dt\n             span = [new_head, new_tail]\n\n        However, note: the problem says for right: [tau, h] -> [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt] -> so if we let tail = tau, head = h, then indeed [tail, head] becomes [tail+s*dt, head+s*dt].\n\n        So we'll do that.\n\n        Now, collision: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn, the car(s) on that freeway have a span that includes 0? Then collision.\n\n        Important: the player is at (0, y) at turn T. So we check the freeway y at turn T.\n\n        Also note: when the player moves, at turn T, the action taken at T will determine y_{T+1}. But at turn T, the player is at y_T. So we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\n        Example: if at turn T the player is at y_T = 5, and we do action U, then at turn T we are on freeway 5, and at turn T+1 we will be on freeway 6.\n\n        We are given the car state at turn t1=14. We need to compute for future turns.\n\n        We are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\n        The player starts at y=2 at turn 14.\n\n        We want to get to y=9. The minimal H would be at least 7 because we have to go from 2 to 9 (7 steps up) if we do only U. But we might have to wait because of cars? Or even go down? But going down might be counterproductive.\n\n        However, note that we can also stay. And we have to avoid the freeways 1 to 8? But note that the goal is at (0,9) and the freeways are from 1 to 8. So when we are at y=9, we are above the freeways? But the problem says: freeways y=1,...,8. So y=9 is safe? And also y=0 is safe? Because the collision condition only applies when on freeways 1 to 8.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\n        We start at y=2 (which is freeway 2? Actually, note: the freeways are at y=1,2,...,8. So y=2 is freeway 2? Then we are on freeway 2 at turn 14? So we must check the cars on freeway 2 at turn 14.\n\n        Let's check freeway 2 at turn 14: \n          Cars: same as freeway 1: [ (-29, -18) for the first car? Actually, the car state for freeway 2 is the same as freeway 1: \n                car1: (-18,-29,right,6) -> so head=-18, tail=-29 -> so at turn 14: [tail, head] = [-29, -18]. Does this include 0? No, because -29 to -18 is all negative. \n                car2: (30,19,right,6) -> [19,30]. 0 is not in [19,30]. \n          So at turn 14, we are safe at y=2.\n\n        Now, we need to plan a path from y=2 at turn 14 to y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\n        We consider the moves: U, D, S. But note: we don't want to go below 0 or above 9.\n\n        We can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y). The state: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 14) and y in [0,9]. We start at (14,2). We want to reach any state (t,9) and then we stop. We want the minimal number of turns (H) which is the number of actions, so the number of steps from turn 14 to turn 14+H-1? Actually, the sequence is from t=14 to t=14+H-1, and the state at the last action is at turn 14+H-1 and then after the last action we are at y=9.\n\n        Actually, the problem says: we have a sequence of actions for t=14 to t=14+H-1 (so H actions) and at the end of the last action (turn t=14+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\n        So in the state, we are at the beginning of a turn: at turn t, we are at position y, then we choose an action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} = y + delta, and then we are at turn t+1 and position y_{t+1}. But note, we are required to output the actions for turns 14, 14+1, ... until the turn that we land at 9.\n\n        How to model:\n\n          Let state = (t, y) meaning at the start of turn t, the player is at y.\n\n          Then we choose an action a in {U, D, S}. This will lead to:\n             next_y = y + (1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S)  [clamped to 0-9? But the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9] so we clamp]\n\n          Then the next state is (t+1, next_y).\n\n          However, when we take the action at turn t, we are on freeway y at turn t? Then we must check: if y is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on freeway y at turn t.\n\n          How to compute the car positions at turn t? We know the state at t1=14. So for a turn t (>=14), the time elapsed is dt = t - 14.\n\n          For each car on the freeway, we update its span:\n\n            If right-moving: \n                new_tail = tail + s * dt\n                new_head = head + s * dt\n            If left-moving:\n                new_head = head - s * dt\n                new_tail = tail - s * dt\n\n          Then we check if 0 is in [min(new_tail, new_head), max(new_tail, new_head)]? Actually, for right-moving, new_tail and new_head are in increasing order? Because we add the same value? So [new_tail, new_head] is the span. Similarly, for left, we subtract so the order remains? But note: for left, the head was the front (smaller) and tail the rear (larger) so the span is [head, tail] -> but after updating, we have new_head = head - s*dt, new_tail = tail - s*dt, and since head<=tail, then new_head<=new_tail? So the span is [new_head, new_tail].\n\n          Therefore, to check if 0 is in the span, we can do:\n\n            For a car: \n               low = min(new_tail, new_head)   # Actually, we don't need to do min if we know the order? \n               high = max(new_tail, new_head)\n\n          But wait: for right-moving, the span is [tail, head] so low=tail, high=head? \n          For left-moving, the span is [head, tail] so low=head, high=tail? \n\n          However, after updating, the relative order remains? \n\n          Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n            For right: the span is [tail + s*dt, head + s*dt] -> and since tail<=head, the span is [tail+s*dt, head+s*dt].\n            For left: the span is [head - s*dt, tail - s*dt] -> and since head<=tail, the span is [head-s*dt, tail-s*dt].\n\n          Then 0 is in the span if:\n            For right: tail+s*dt <= 0 <= head+s*dt\n            For left: head-s*dt <= 0 <= tail-s*dt\n\n          But note: the update for left: [head, tail] becomes [head-s*dt, tail-s*dt] -> so the condition is: head-s*dt <= 0 <= tail-s*dt.\n\n        So for a freeway at turn t, we check every car on that freeway. If at least one car has 0 in its span, then we have a collision.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\n        Therefore, in state (t,y): \n          if y is 0 or 9 -> no collision (since freeways are 1-8) -> safe.\n          if y is between 1 and 8: we compute dt = t - 14, then for each car on freeway y, we compute the updated span and check if 0 is in that span. If any car has 0 in its span, then this state (t,y) is invalid? Actually, we are at the beginning of the turn? \n\n        But note: the action we take at turn t will determine the next y. However, the collision check at turn t is based on the freeway we are on at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, we are on y_T. Therefore, we must check the freeway y at turn T.\n\n        Therefore, when we are in state (t, y) and y is between 1 and 8, we must check the cars on freeway y at turn t. If there is a collision, then we cannot be in this state? \n\n        Actually, the state (t,y) is the state at the start of turn t. Then we choose an action, and then we update the position. But the collision happens at the turn? So if we are at (t,y) and y is between 1 and 8, and at turn t the cars on freeway y cover 0, then we are collided at the start of the turn? Or during the turn? \n\n        The problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ...\". So it happens at turn T. Therefore, we must avoid being at (t,y) when y is in [1,8] and the freeway y at turn t has a car covering 0.\n\n        Therefore, state (t,y) is invalid if y in [1,8] and there exists a car on freeway y at turn t such that 0 is in its updated span.\n\n        Steps for BFS:\n\n          Let queue store (t, y, path_actions) \n          We start at (14, 2, [])\n\n          We mark visited states by (t, y) to avoid cycles? But note: t is increasing, and we are looking for minimal H, so we don't need to worry about cycles? Actually, we might have to wait? But the cars are moving, so the state is time-dependent. And we are going forward in time. So we don't need to mark by (t,y) because t is always increasing.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            while queue not empty:\n                pop state (t, y, path)\n                if y == 9: then we found a solution with H = len(path) and the path.\n\n                Otherwise, for each action in [U, D, S]:\n                    next_y = y + delta (clamped to 0-9)\n                    next_t = t + 1\n\n                    But note: we are at state (t,y) and we are going to take an action that leads to (next_t, next_y). However, we must check the state (t,y) for collision? \n\n                So before even considering the next state, we must check: is the current state (t,y) valid? \n                    if y in [1,8]: \n                         dt = t - 14\n                         for each car on freeway y:\n                              update the car's span to turn t, and check if 0 is in the span.\n                         if any car covers 0 at turn t, then this state is invalid -> skip.\n\n                If the state (t,y) is valid, then we can take an action.\n\n          But note: the start state: (14,2) -> we check freeway 2 at turn 14: as above, no car covers 0 -> valid.\n\n          Then we consider the actions: U -> next_y=3, D->1, S->2.\n\n          Then we generate the next states: (15,3), (15,1), (15,2).\n\n          Then we check the next state (15, y) when we get there? Actually, when we get to (15, y), we will check at turn 15? So we do the same: at the beginning of turn 15, we are at y, then we check freeway y at turn 15? \n\n          However, note: when we are at (15, y), we are about to take an action at turn 15. So we must check the state (15,y) for collision at turn 15.\n\n          Therefore, we don't check the state (t,y) until we pop it? Or we can check when generating the next state? \n\n          Actually, in BFS we generate the next state and then when we pop it we check? But if we check at generation, we can avoid putting invalid states.\n\n          However, the same state (t,y) might be generated by multiple paths? But since t is increasing, we will only generate each (t,y) once? Not necessarily: we might get to the same y at the same t by different paths? Then we can mark visited (t,y) to avoid duplicates? Because the future from (t,y) is the same regardless of the path.\n\n          So we can use a visited set: states (t,y) that we have already expanded? But note: the minimal H is the first time we get to (t,9). \n\n          Algorithm:\n\n            Let dist[t][y] = minimal number of steps to reach (t,y) from (14,2) OR we don't store dist? We are doing BFS by t? \n\n            We use a queue: \n               queue = deque([(14, 2, [])])\n            visited = set()   # we can mark (t,y)\n\n            while queue:\n                (t, y, path) = queue.popleft()\n\n                if (t,y) in visited: continue\n                visited.add((t,y))\n\n                # Check collision at (t,y): if y in [1,8] and there's a car at freeway y at turn t that covers 0 -> then skip (this state is invalid)\n                if 1<= y <=8:\n                    dt = t - 14\n                    cars = cars_on_freeway[y]   # list of cars for freeway y: each car is (head, tail, d, s)\n                    collision = False\n                    for car in cars:\n                        h, tau, d, s = car\n                        if d == 'right':\n                            # update: new_tail = tau + s*dt, new_head = h + s*dt\n                            new_tail = tau + s * dt\n                            new_head = h + s * dt\n                            if new_tail <= 0 <= new_head:\n                                collision = True\n                                break\n                        else: # left, but in this problem all cars are right? \n                            # Actually, the given cars: all are 'right'? \n                            # But let's check: in the input, all cars are right? \n                            # Freeway 1: right, freeway 2: right, freeway 3: right, etc. -> yes, all are right.\n                            # So we don't need left? \n                            # But for completeness, if there were left:\n                            new_head = h - s * dt\n                            new_tail = tau - s * dt\n                            # for left: the span is [new_head, new_tail]? and we require new_head<=0<=new_tail?\n                            if new_head <= 0 <= new_tail:\n                                collision = True\n                                break\n                    if collision:\n                        continue   # skip this state\n\n                # If we are at y=9, we are done?

We are at (0,9) and we are safe (since y=9 is not a freeway). \n                if y == 9:\n                    # We have a solution: the path has the actions from turn 14 to turn t-1? \n                    # But note: we started at (14,2) and we took actions to get to (t,9).

So we want t = 14+H? \n                    # Therefore, H = t - 14.\n\n                    # And the number of actions is H, which is the number of turns we advanced? \n\n                    # So we have taken H actions: from turn 14 to turn 14+H-1? and then at turn 14+H we are at 9.\n\n                    # Therefore, the solution is the path (which has H actions) and H = t - 14.\n\n                    # So we return the path and H = t-14.\n\n                    # But note: we haven't taken an action at the state (t,9) because we just got there? \n\n                    # Actually, we started at (14,2) and we have taken H actions to get to (14+H, 9). So the path has H actions.\n\n                    return path   # and we break.\n\n                # If not goal, then we consider the next actions: U, D, S.\n                for action in ['U','D','S']:\n                    ny = y\n                    if action == 'U':\n                        ny = y+1\n                    elif action == 'D':\n                        ny = y-1\n                    else: # S\n                        ny = y\n\n                    # clamp to [0,9]\n                    if ny < 0:\n                        ny = 0\n                    elif ny > 9:\n                        ny = 9\n\n                    # The next state is (t+1, ny)\n                    # We don't check collision here because we will check when we pop (t+1,ny) at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\n                    # But note: if we are going to the same state (t+1, ny) by multiple paths, we can avoid duplicates? \n                    # We use visited set?

But there should be one.\n\n        However, note: the cars move and the state space is infinite? But we are going to find the minimal H? And the minimal H is at most 20? because worst-case we go from 2 to 9: 7 moves, but we might have to wait? \n\n        But we must avoid infinite loops? But since we are doing BFS and we are increasing t, we will eventually find the minimal H.\n\n        But note: we might get stuck? But the problem is designed to be solvable? \n\n        We'll code accordingly.\n\n        However, we note: the cars move and eventually they leave? But we are going to simulate until we get to y=9.\n\n        But we must be cautious: the minimal H might be around 7? But we might have to wait at some freeway? \n\n        Let's look at the freeways:\n\n          We are starting at y=2 at turn 14.\n\n          We want to go up: to 3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\n          Let's check the freeways we will pass: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\n          We have to check at each turn and each freeway we are on.\n\n          We'll simulate the cars at the freeways we are going to be on.\n\n          But note: we might wait at a freeway? \n\n        We'll run the BFS until we find the goal.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Precompute the cars for each freeway? \n\n          We have freeways 1 to 8. The car data:\n\n            Freeway 1 and 2: same cars: [ (-18,-29,right,6), (30,19,right,6) ]\n            Freeway 3 and 4 and 8: [ (0,-47,right,48) ]   -> freeway 3,4,8: one car: head=0, tail=-47, right, speed=48.\n            Freeway 5,6,7: [ (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) ]\n\n          Let's compute for freeway 3: at turn 14, the car: \n             head=0, tail=-47, right, s=48.\n             dt = t-14\n             at turn t: \n                 tail = -47 + 48*(t-14)\n                 head = 0 + 48*(t-14)\n\n             We need to check if 0 is in [tail, head] = [-47+48*(t-14), 48*(t-14)]\n\n             Condition: \n                 -47+48*(t-14) <= 0 <= 48*(t-14)\n\n             Solve: \n                 0 <= 48*(t-14)  -> t>=14 -> always true for t>=14? \n                 and -47+48*(t-14) <= 0 -> 48*(t-14) <= 47 -> t-14 <= 47/48 -> t <= 14 + 47/48 -> so only at t=14? \n\n             At t=14: \n                 tail = -47 + 48*0 = -47\n                 head = 0\n                 so 0 is in [-47,0] -> so at turn 14, freeway 3 has a car covering 0? \n\n          But wait, at turn 14: \n             freeway 3: the car is (0,-47,right,48) -> so the head is 0 and tail is -47 -> so the span is [-47,0]. \n             So 0 is included? \n\n          Therefore, at turn 14, freeway 3 is unsafe? \n\n          Similarly, freeway 4: same car -> unsafe at turn 14? \n          freeway 8: same car -> unsafe at turn 14? \n\n          But we are starting at freeway 2 -> safe at turn 14.\n\n          Now, if we try to move to freeway 3 at turn 15? \n\n          How? We are at freeway 2 at turn 14. We take an action U -> then at turn 14 we are on freeway 2 (so we are safe at turn 14) and then we move to freeway 3 at turn 15? \n\n          But at turn 15, we are at freeway 3? Then we must check freeway 3 at turn 15.\n\n          At turn 15: dt=1\n             tail = -47 + 48*1 = 1\n             head = 0 + 48*1 = 48\n             span = [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\n          So freeway 3 is safe at turn 15? \n\n          Similarly, freeway 4 at turn 16: \n             tail = -47+48*2 = 49, head=96 -> safe.\n\n          freeway 8 at turn ... we might not go there? \n\n          Now, freeway 5,6,7: \n             Each has three cars: \n                 car1: (12,1,right,12) -> [1,12] at turn 14? \n                 car2: (48,37,right,12) -> [37,48] at turn 14?\n                 car3: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47,-36] at turn 14?\n\n          Check freeway 5 at turn 14: \n             car1: [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe?\n             car2: [37,48] -> safe\n             car3: [-47,-36] -> safe? \n          So freeway 5 is safe at turn 14? \n\n          But we are at freeway 2 at turn 14. \n\n          Now, if we go up:\n\n            turn 14: at freeway 2 -> safe? \n            action U: then at turn 15 we are at freeway 3 -> we checked: at turn15, freeway3 is safe? \n            then at turn15: we can do U again -> freeway4 at turn16: \n                freeway4: the car (originally (0,-47,right,48)): at turn16: dt=2 -> tail=-47+48*2 = 49, head=96 -> safe.\n            then turn16: U to freeway5 at turn17: \n                freeway5 at turn17: \n                   dt=3\n                   car1: [1+12*3, 12+12*3] = [1+36, 12+36] = [37,48] -> safe? \n                   car2: [37+36, 48+36] = [73,84] -> safe\n                   car3: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? -> collision? \n\n          So at turn17, freeway5 has a car covering 0: car3: [-11,0] -> so we cannot be at freeway5 at turn17.\n\n          Therefore, we must avoid freeway5 at turn17.\n\n          How about if we wait at freeway4 for one turn? Then at turn16 we are at freeway4 (safe) and we do S -> then at turn17 we are still at freeway4? \n             freeway4 at turn17: dt=3 -> tail=-47+48*3=97, head=0+48*3=144 -> safe? \n          Then at turn17 we can go U to freeway5 at turn18: \n             freeway5 at turn18: dt=4\n                 car1: [1+48, 12+48] = [49,60] -> safe\n                 car2: [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe\n                 car3: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> safe? \n          So safe.\n\n          Then we can continue: \n             turn18: freeway5 -> U to freeway6 at turn19: \n                 freeway6 at turn19: same cars as freeway5? \n                    car1: [1+12*5, 12+12*5] = [1+60, 12+60] = [61,72] -> safe\n                    car2: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe\n                    car3: [-47+60, -36+60] = [13,24] -> safe? \n             turn19: U to freeway7 at turn20: \n                 freeway7: same cars: \n                    car1: [1+12*6,12+72]=[73,84] -> safe\n                    car2: [37+72,48+72]=[109,120] -> safe\n                    car3: [-47+72, -36+72]=[25,36] -> safe\n             turn20: U to freeway8 at turn21: \n                 freeway8: the car: (0,-47,right,48) at turn21: dt=7 -> tail=-47+48*7=289, head=0+48*7=336 -> safe? \n             turn21: U to freeway9? but freeway9 doesn't exist -> but we are at freeway8 and then we move to y=9? \n                 Actually, from freeway8 (y=8) we do U -> y=9 -> and we are done? \n\n          So we reached at turn21? Then the sequence of actions:\n\n            turn14: U (from y=2 to y=3)\n            turn15: U (to y=4)\n            turn16: S (wait at y=4)  -> why wait? we could have gone U? but if we go U at turn16 we get to y=5 at turn17 -> which is unsafe? \n            turn17: U (to y=5)\n            turn18: U (to y=6)\n            turn19: U (to y=7)\n            turn20: U (to y=8)\n            turn21: U (to y=9) -> then at the start of turn22 we are at y=9? \n\n          But wait: we are at turn21 and we take an action at turn21 -> then we are at the start of turn22 at y=9? \n\n          Therefore, the last action is at turn21? So we have actions for turn14 to turn21? That's 8 actions? H=8.\n\n          But we started at turn14 at y=2. Then:\n\n            turn14: U -> y=3 (at turn15)\n            turn15: U -> y=4 (at turn16)\n            turn16: S -> y=4 (at turn17)\n            turn17: U -> y=5 (at turn18)\n            turn18: U -> y=6 (at turn19)\n            turn19: U -> y=7 (at turn20)\n            turn20: U -> y=8 (at turn21)\n            turn21: U -> y=9 (at turn22)\n\n          So at the start of turn22 we are at y=9. Therefore, H = 8? \n\n          But note: the minimal H? We could do without waiting? \n\n          Alternative: avoid freeway5 at turn17 by taking a detour? \n\n          How about going down at some point? But that might take more turns? \n\n          Alternatively, can we go faster? \n\n          We need 7 moves up. But we have to avoid the collision at freeway5 at turn17. \n\n          How about if we do:\n\n            turn14: U -> y=3 (turn15)\n            turn15: U -> y=4 (turn16)\n            turn16: U -> but then at turn17 we are at freeway5 -> unsafe? \n\n          Then we must wait at freeway4 for one turn? \n\n          Or wait at freeway3? \n\n          But at freeway3 at turn16: \n             freeway3: car: at turn16 (dt=2) -> tail=-47+48*2=49, head=96 -> safe? \n          Then we could do:\n\n            turn14: U -> y=3 (turn15)\n            turn15: S -> wait at y=3? \n            turn16: U -> y=4 (turn17) -> freeway4 at turn17: safe? \n            turn17: U -> y=5 (turn18) -> freeway5 at turn18: safe? (as above)\n\n          Then:\n\n            turn14: U\n            turn15: S\n            turn16: U\n            turn17: U\n            turn18: U\n            turn19: U\n            turn20: U -> then at turn21 we are at y=8? \n            turn21: U -> y=9 at turn22.\n\n          That's 8 actions too.\n\n          Or:\n\n            turn14: U -> y=3 (turn15)\n            turn15: U -> y=4 (turn16)\n            turn16: D -> y=3 (turn17) -> then freeway3 at turn17: dt=3 -> tail=-47+48*3=97, head=144 -> safe? \n            then turn17: U -> y=4 (turn18) -> freeway4 at turn18: safe? \n            turn18: U -> y=5 (turn19) -> freeway5 at turn19: \n                   car1: [1+12*5=61,12+60=72] -> safe\n                   car2: [37+60=97,48+60=108] -> safe\n                   car3: [-47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> safe? \n            then turn19: U -> y=6 (turn20)\n            turn20: U -> y=7 (turn21)\n            turn21: U -> y=8 (turn22)\n            turn22: U -> y=9 (turn23) -> 10 actions? worse.\n\n          So the minimal H is 8? \n\n          But note: we might be able to go through freeway5 at a different turn? \n\n          How about going faster at the beginning? \n\n          turn14: U (to3) -> turn15: U (to4) -> turn16: U (to5) -> but at turn16 we are at freeway5? \n             freeway5 at turn16: dt=2\n                 car1: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] -> safe\n                 car2: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe\n                 car3: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> safe? \n          Then at turn16 we are safe at freeway5? \n\n          Then we can do:\n\n            turn14: U -> y=3 (turn15)\n            turn15: U -> y=4 (turn16)\n            turn16: U -> y=5 (turn17) -> but wait, at turn16 we are at freeway5? \n                   At the start of turn16 we are at freeway5? Then we check freeway5 at turn16: safe? \n                   Then we take action at turn16: U -> then at turn17 we are at freeway6? \n\n          How about:\n\n            turn14: U -> turn15: at y=3 -> safe? \n            turn15: U -> turn16: at y=4 -> safe? \n            turn16: U -> then at the start of turn16 we are at y=4? Then we take U -> at turn17 we are at y=5? \n                   But at the start of turn17 we are at freeway5? Then we must check freeway5 at turn17: which we saw is unsafe (car3: [-11,0])? \n\n          Actually, when we take an action at turn16, we are at freeway4 at turn16? Then we do U: then at turn17 we are at freeway5? \n\n          So we don't check freeway5 until the start of turn17? \n\n          Therefore, the plan:\n\n            turn14: U -> at turn15: y=3 -> safe? \n            turn15: U -> at turn16: y=4 -> safe? \n            turn16: U -> at turn17: y=5 -> then we check freeway5 at turn17: unsafe? \n\n          So that fails.\n\n          How about if we do two U in a row at the beginning? \n\n            turn14: U -> y=3 (turn15)\n            turn15: U -> y=4 (turn16)\n            turn16: U -> y=5 (turn17) -> unsafe? \n\n          So we cannot be at freeway5 at turn17.\n\n          How about if we do:\n\n            turn14: U -> y=3 (turn15)\n            turn15: U -> y=4 (turn16)\n            turn16: U -> but then we are at freeway5 at turn17? -> unsafe.\n\n          So we must avoid freeway5 at turn17.\n\n          Therefore, the only way is to delay getting to freeway5 until turn18? \n\n          Then the minimal H is 8? \n\n          But let me check if we can get to freeway5 at turn18 without waiting? \n\n          How? We start at y=2 at turn14. \n\n          We need to get to y=5 at turn18? \n\n          We have 4 moves: 14,15,16,17 -> 4 actions. \n\n          We need to move up 3 steps: from 2 to 5 -> 3 steps. So we can do: U, U, U, and then one S? But that would be:\n\n            turn14: U -> 3 (at turn15)\n            turn15: U -> 4 (at turn16)\n            turn16: U -> 5 (at turn17) -> unsafe? \n\n          Or we do:\n\n            turn14: U -> 3 (15)\n            turn15: U -> 4 (16)\n            turn16: S -> 4 (17) -> safe at freeway4 at turn17? \n            turn17: U -> 5 (18) -> safe at freeway5 at turn18? \n\n          Then we have:\n\n            turn17: U -> to5 (at turn18)\n            turn18: U -> to6 (at turn19)\n            turn19: U -> to7 (at turn20)\n            turn20: U -> to8 (at turn21)\n            turn21: U -> to9 (at turn22)\n\n          That's 8 actions: turns14 to21 -> H=8.\n\n          We could do:\n\n            turn14: U -> 3 (15)\n            turn15: S -> 3 (16)   [wait at freeway3?]\n            turn16: U -> 4 (17)   [freeway4 at turn17: safe? as above?]\n            turn17: U -> 5 (18)   [freeway5 at turn18: safe?]\n            then same as above: 4 more U -> total 8 actions.\n\n          So minimal H is 8? \n\n          But is there a way with 7? \n\n          We need to get from y=2 to y=9 in 7 moves: that's 7 moves? \n\n          The minimal moves without waiting is 7: 7 U's. \n\n          Let's try 7 U's:\n\n            turn14: U -> y=3 (turn15): freeway3 at turn15: safe? \n                   freeway3: at turn15: dt=1 -> tail=-47+48=1, head=48 -> safe? \n            turn15: U -> y=4 (turn16): freeway4 at turn16: safe? \n            turn16: U -> y=5 (turn17): freeway5 at turn17: unsafe? \n\n          So we fail at turn17.\n\n          How about:\n\n            turn14: U -> 3 (15)\n            turn15: U -> 4 (16)\n            turn16: U -> 5 (17) -> unsafe? \n\n          So we cannot do 3 consecutive U's to get to freeway5 at turn17.\n\n          How about:\n\n            turn14: U -> 3 (15)\n            turn15: U -> 4 (16)\n            turn16: U -> 5 (17) -> unsafe -> so we avoid that.\n\n          Therefore, minimal H is 8.\n\n          We choose the sequence:\n\n            turn14: U\n            turn15: U\n            turn16: S   (wait at freeway4)\n            turn17: U\n            turn18: U\n            turn19: U\n            turn20: U\n            turn21: U   -> then at turn22 we are at 9.\n\n          But wait: we have 8 actions: turns14 to21. \n\n          The goal is to reach (0,9) at the start of turn22? \n\n          The problem: the sequence of actions from t1 (14) to t1+H-1 (14+8-1=21) -> so 8 actions.\n\n          We output:\n\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: U\n            Turn 16: S\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n            Turn 19: U\n            Turn 20: U\n            Turn 21: U\n\n          But note: after the last action (turn21: U) we move from y=8 to y=9 at the start of turn22? \n\n          And we are safe at turn21: we are at freeway8 at turn21? \n             freeway8: car: (0,-47,right,48) at turn21: dt=7 -> tail=-47+48*7=289, head=0+48*7=336 -> safe? \n\n          And at turn21 we are at freeway8? Then we take U and become at y=9 at turn22 -> safe.\n\n          Therefore, we return the above sequence.\n\n        However, let me double-check the freeway5 at turn18: \n            freeway5 at turn18: dt=4\n                car1: (12,1,right,12): \n                    tail = 1+12*4 = 1+48=49\n                    head = 12+48=60\n                    span [49,60] -> safe\n                car2: (48,37,right,12):\n                    tail=37+48=85, head=48+48=96 -> safe\n                car3: (-36,-47,right,12):\n                    tail=-47+48=1, head=-36+48=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        So safe.\n\n        We can code the BFS to confirm.\n\n        But note: we might have a path that goes through freeway6 or 7 earlier? \n\n        However, we are going for minimal H. We found H=8.\n\n        We'll run the BFS to see if we can get H=7? \n\n        We'll simulate:\n\n          State: (t,y) = (14,2) -> valid (safe at freeway2: cars: [-29,-18] and [19,30] -> 0 not in)\n\n          Then we try to take 7 U's:\n\n            t14: U -> (15,3): freeway3 at turn15: \n                   car: [1,48] -> 0 not in -> safe? \n            t15: U -> (16,4): freeway4 at turn16: \n                   car: [49,96] -> safe? \n            t16: U -> (17,5): freeway5 at turn17: \n                   car3: [-47+12*3, -36+12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in? -> collision.\n\n          So we cannot.\n\n          How about if we do 6 U's and one D? That would be 5 net moves? not enough.\n\n          How about 7 moves: 6 U and 1 D? net 5 moves: from 2 to 7? not to 9.\n\n          So no.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H=8.\n\n        We'll output the sequence:\n\n          Turn 14: U\n          Turn 15: U\n          Turn 16: S\n          Turn 17: U\n          Turn 18: U\n          Turn 19: U\n          Turn 20: U\n          Turn 21: U\n\n        But wait, we have to go from 2 to 9: 7 moves up. We did 6 U's and one S? so net 6 moves? \n\n          Start: 2\n          turn14: U -> 3\n          turn15: U -> 4\n          turn16: S -> 4\n          turn17: U -> 5\n          turn18: U -> 6\n          turn19: U -> 7\n          turn20: U -> 8\n          turn21: U -> 9\n\n        Yes, that's 7 moves up? and one stay -> total 8 actions.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        We'll code the BFS to be safe? \n\n        But the problem says to output the sequence.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try to see if there is a path that avoids the wait? \n\n        How about if we go up to freeway5 earlier? \n\n          We start at turn14: y=2. \n          turn14: U -> y=3 (turn15)\n          turn15: U -> y=4 (turn16) \n          then we can't go to y=5 at turn17? \n\n          Or later? \n\n          How about going to freeway5 at turn18 without waiting? \n\n          We need to get to y=5 at turn18? \n\n          We have 4 moves: turns14,15,16,17.\n\n          We start at y=2. We need to go up 3 times: so we can do U,U,U, and then one extra move: we can do S at one of the turns? \n\n          Possibilities:\n\n            Option1: \n               turn14: U -> 3 (15)\n               turn15: U -> 4 (16)\n               turn16: U -> 5 (17) -> unsafe? \n            Option2:\n               turn14: U -> 3 (15)\n               turn15: U -> 4 (16)\n               turn16: S -> 4 (17)\n               turn17: U -> 5 (18) -> safe? \n            Option3:\n               turn14: U -> 3 (15)\n               turn15: S -> 3 (16)\n               turn16: U -> 4 (17)\n               turn17: U -> 5 (18) -> safe? \n\n          Both option2 and option3 take 4 moves to get to y=5 at turn18? Then we have to go from 5 to 9: 4 more U's? total 8 moves.\n\n          So no improvement.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n          Turn 14: U\n          Turn 15: U\n          Turn 16: S\n          Turn 17: U\n          Turn 18: U\n          Turn 19: U\n          Turn 20: U\n          Turn 21: U\n\n        But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so we start at t1=14, and we have H=8, so t from 0 to 7? \n\n          a_{14+0} = a_14 = U\n          a_15 = U\n          a_16 = S\n          a_17 = U\n          a_18 = U\n          a_19 = U\n          a_20 = U\n          a_21 = U\n\n        So we output:\n\n          Turn 14: U\n          Turn 15: U\n          Turn 16: S\n          Turn 17: U\n          Turn 18: U\n          Turn 19: U\n          Turn 20: U\n          Turn 21: U\n\n        We'll write the answer accordingly.\n\n        However, let me check the freeway8 at turn21: \n            We are at freeway8 at turn21? \n            freeway8: car (0,-47,right,48) at turn21: dt=7 -> \n                tail = -47 + 48*7 = -47+336 = 289\n                head = 0 + 336 = 336\n            so [289,336] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        And then we do U and become at y=9 at the start of turn22 -> safe.\n\n        So it's valid.\n\n        We are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal sequence of actions to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn 14, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, requires 8 turns. The sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to y=3. Freeway 2 at turn 14 is safe: cars at [-29, -18] and [19, 30] do not cover x=0.\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to y=4. Freeway 3 at turn 15 is safe: car at [1, 48] does not cover x=0.\n- At turn 16, stay (S) at y=4. Freeway 4 at turn 16 is safe: car at [49, 96] does not cover x=0.\n- At turn 17, move up (U) to y=5. Freeway 4 at turn 17 is safe: car at [97, 144] does not cover x=0. Freeway 5 at turn 18 (after the move) will be checked next turn.\n- At turn 18, move up (U) to y=6. Freeway 5 at turn 18 is safe: cars at [49, 60], [85, 96], and [1, 12] do not cover x=0.\n- At turn 19, move up (U) to y=7. Freeway 6 at turn 19 is safe: cars at [61, 72], [97, 108], and [13, 24] do not cover x=0.\n- At turn 20, move up (U) to y=8. Freeway 7 at turn 20 is safe: cars at [73, 84], [109, 120], and [25, 36] do not cover x=0.\n- At turn 21, move up (U) to y=9. Freeway 8 at turn 21 is safe: car at [289, 336] does not cover x=0.\n\nAfter turn 21, the player reaches y=9 at the start of turn 22, which is safe as it is not a freeway (y=9 is above the freeways). The total number of actions is 8.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21: \\text{U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 15, and the player is at (0,3). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: The player updates position at the same time as the cars move. The collision condition at turn T is that the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and the x-coordinate 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that same turn T.\n\nNote: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at turn T they are still on row y, and only at turn T+1 will they be on row y'. Therefore, when moving at turn T, we only check the car on the current row (the row we are leaving) at turn T, and at turn T+1 we will check the new row (if we moved).\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" So at each turn T, we are concerned only with the freeway we are currently on (y_T) and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe car update rules:\n- For a left-moving car: at turn T, the car span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]? But wait, the description says for left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, τ] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. However, note that for left-moving, the head is at a higher x? Actually, the problem defines:\n  - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the given state, all cars are right-moving? Because the direction is given as \"right\". So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nFor a right-moving car at initial turn t1=15, we have:\n  Span(t1) = [τ, h]   (so τ is the tail, h is the head? But note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[τ, h]\". So the car extends from τ to h, and since it's right-moving, at time T, it will be [τ + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)].\n\nWe are at turn T (relative to t1=15: T = 15, 16, ...). So at turn T (absolute), the car's position is:\n  tail: τ + s*(T-15)\n  head: h + s*(T-15)\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k (which is the row) and 0 is in [τ + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)].\n\nBut note: the car spans are given at t1=15. We have to compute for each turn T the position of every car on the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nOur plan: we start at y=3 at turn 15. We can take actions U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), or S (stay). We must avoid being on a freeway row (1 to 8) at a turn T when 0 is in the span of any car on that row.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we end at y=9. Note that we start at y=3 and we need to get to y=9, so we must go up 6 steps. However, we might have to wait (S) or even go down to avoid collisions, but since we want minimal H, we prefer going up as much as possible.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 15 onward. We need to check for each turn and each row we are on whether there is a collision.\n\nLet me write down the cars per freeway at turn 15:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: \n  car1: (h=-12, τ=-23, right, s=6) -> at turn 15: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? But wait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[τ, h]\". So the car is from τ to h, and since it's right-moving, we write [τ, h] and then it moves by adding s*(T-15) to both.\n\nBut note: the head is at h and tail at τ. In a right-moving car, as time increases, the car moves to the right. So at time T, the car covers [τ + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: \n  car1: τ=-23, h=-12, s=6 -> at time T: [-23+6*(T-15), -12+6*(T-15)]\n  car2: τ=25, h=36, s=6 -> [25+6*(T-15), 36+6*(T-15)]\n\nBut note: at turn 15 (T=15), car1: [-23, -12], car2: [25,36]. So 0 is not in either.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1? \n  car1: [-23+6*(T-15), -12+6*(T-15)]\n  car2: [25+6*(T-15), 36+6*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (h=48, τ=1, right, s=48) -> [1+48*(T-15), 48+48*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway3? \n  [1+48*(T-15), 48+48*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 5: three cars:\n  car1: (h=24, τ=13, right, s=12) -> [13+12*(T-15), 24+12*(T-15)]\n  car2: (h=60, τ=49, right, s=12) -> [49+12*(T-15), 60+12*(T-15)]\n  car3: (h=-24, τ=-35, right, s=12) -> [-35+12*(T-15), -24+12*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway5? \n  [13+12*(T-15), 24+12*(T-15)], [49+12*(T-15),60+12*(T-15)], [-35+12*(T-15),-24+12*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway5? \n  same three cars.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway3 and 4? \n  [1+48*(T-15), 48+48*(T-15)]\n\nWe are starting at turn 15 at y=3. We must avoid rows 1 to 8 when 0 is in a car span on that row.\n\nNote: at the start (turn15) we are on row3. We need to check row3 at turn15: \n  Freeway3: [1+48*(0), 48] = [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48]. So safe.\n\nOur goal is to get to row9. We can only change row by one per turn (or stay). So the minimal H without any obstacles would be 6 (since 3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 6 moves). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe must check for each step the row we are on at that turn and whether 0 is in the span of any car on that row at that turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate turns starting from turn15. We note that the cars are moving, so the gaps change.\n\nWe need to check for each row and each turn whether the row is safe. But note: we don't care about rows we are not on. So we only check the row we are on at that turn.\n\nWe are at turn15: y=3. Check row3: freeway3 has [1,48] -> safe.\n\nWe then plan the next moves. We want to go up as fast as possible. But we must check the next row at the next turn.\n\nWe can consider the path: 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9.\n\nBut we must check:\n\nTurn15 (current): at row3: safe.\n\nTurn16: we are going to be at row4 if we move up? But note: at turn16, we are on row4 (if we did U at turn15). Then we check row4 at turn16.\n\nRow4 at turn16: freeway4 has one car: [1+48*(16-15)=1+48=49, 48+48=96] -> [49,96]. 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nTurn17: we go to row5. Check row5 at turn17: freeway5 has three cars:\n  car1: [13+12*(17-15)=13+24=37, 24+24=48] -> [37,48]\n  car2: [49+12*2=49+24=73, 60+24=84] -> [73,84]\n  car3: [-35+24=-11, -24+24=0] -> [-11,0] -> note: 0 is included? The interval is [-11,0]. So 0 is in the interval? Then collision.\n\nTherefore, if we are at row5 at turn17, we collide with car3 on freeway5.\n\nSo we cannot be at row5 at turn17.\n\nWhat are our options?\n1. We could delay going to row5. That is, at turn16, instead of going to row4, we stay at row3? Then at turn16 we are at row3. Then at turn17 we could go to row4? Then at turn18 we go to row5? But then we have to check row5 at turn18.\n\nBut we must also consider that we might need to go down to avoid? However, going down might be counterproductive. Also, we might wait at row3 or row4 for one turn.\n\nAlternatively, we could at turn16 go to row2? But row2 is a freeway and we start at row3. Going down to row2 might be safe? But then we are going away from goal.\n\nBut minimal turns might require we don't go down. Let's try to avoid row5 at turn17.\n\nOption A: Stay at row3 at turn16 (so we do S at turn15) and then at turn16 we do U to row4. Then at turn17 we are at row4? Then at turn18 we go to row5.\n\nBut then we must check row5 at turn18.\n\nRow5 at turn18 (T=18, so T-15=3):\n  car1: [13+12*3=13+36=49, 24+36=60] -> [49,60]\n  car2: [49+36=85, 60+36=96] -> [85,96]\n  car3: [-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo that works. But we spent an extra turn: we did S at turn15 and then U at turn16 to row4, then at turn17 we go to row4? Wait no:\n\nTurn15: start at row3, do S -> stay at row3 at turn16? Actually:\n\nAt turn15: we are at row3. We take an action at turn15 for the next state (turn16). \n- If we take S at turn15: then at turn16 we are still at row3.\n- Then at turn16 we take U: then at turn17 we are at row4.\n- Then at turn17 we take U: then at turn18 we are at row5.\n\nSo at turn18 we are at row5 and it is safe (as above).\n\nThen we continue:\n\nTurn18: at row5 (safe) -> we do U at turn18 to go to row6 at turn19.\n\nCheck row6 at turn19: freeway6 has the same cars as freeway5. So at turn19 (T=19, T-15=4):\n  car1: [13+12*4=13+48=61, 24+48=72] -> [61,72]\n  car2: [49+48=97, 60+48=108] -> [97,108]\n  car3: [-35+48=13, -24+48=24] -> [13,24] -> 0 not in any -> safe.\n\nTurn19: we are at row6. Then we do U to go to row7 at turn20.\n\nCheck row7 at turn20: freeway7 same as freeway5. T=20, T-15=5:\n  car1: [13+60=73, 24+60=84] -> [73,84]\n  car2: [49+60=109, 60+60=120] -> [109,120]\n  car3: [-35+60=25, -24+60=36] -> [25,36] -> safe.\n\nTurn20: at row7 -> do U to row8 at turn21.\n\nCheck row8 at turn21: freeway8 has [1+48*(21-15)=1+48*6=1+288=289, 48+288=336] -> [289,336] -> safe.\n\nTurn21: at row8 -> do U to row9 at turn22.\n\nAt row9: note that row9 is the goal and there are no cars (only freeways 1-8 have cars). So safe.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\nTurn15: S (because we stayed at row3 for turn16)\nTurn16: U -> to row4 at turn17\nTurn17: U -> to row5 at turn18\nTurn18: U -> to row6 at turn19\nTurn19: U -> to row7 at turn20\nTurn20: U -> to row8 at turn21\nTurn21: U -> to row9 at turn22\n\nBut wait, we started at turn15 at row3. We did:\n\nTurn15: action S -> then at turn16 we are at row3? Then turn16: action U -> at turn17 we are at row4? Then turn17: U -> turn18: row5, etc.\n\nBut we want to end at row9 at turn15+H-1. We started at turn15 (t=0 in the sequence of actions). We take H actions: from t=0 to H-1.\n\nWe start at turn15: we take action at turn15 for turn16, then turn16 for turn17, etc.\n\nWe want to be at row9 at turn15+H-1.\n\nIn the above:\n\nAt turn15: we are at row3 (initial)\nAfter action at turn15 (S): at turn16 we are at row3.\nAfter action at turn16 (U): at turn17 we are at row4.\nAfter action at turn17 (U): at turn18 we are at row5.\nAfter action at turn18 (U): at turn19 we are at row6.\nAfter action at turn19 (U): at turn20 we are at row7.\nAfter action at turn20 (U): at turn21 we are at row8.\nAfter action at turn21 (U): at turn22 we are at row9.\n\nSo we reached at turn22. Therefore, H = 7 (actions from turn15 to turn21, inclusive).\n\nBut note: the problem says \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t1=15, and t from 0 to H-1. So we have actions at turns: 15,16,...,15+H-1.\n\nWe need H actions. We started at turn15 and the last action is at turn15+H-1, and then at turn15+H we are at row9? Actually, the position after H actions is at turn15+H.\n\nBut note: the player update: at turn t, we take action a_t and then at turn t+1 we are at the new position.\n\nSo we start at turn15: position (0,3). After 0 actions, we are at turn15 at (0,3). Then we take an action at turn15 to get to turn16 at a new y.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn15+H? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? Let me read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo at turn = t1 + H - 1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn our plan:\n\nAt turn15 (t1): we are at y=3.\n\nWe take actions:\n\na15 (action at turn15) -> at turn16: y = 3 (if S) or 4 (if U) or 2 (if D).\n\nWe want at turn15+H-1 to be at 9.\n\nIn the sequence I described:\n\nWe are at turn22 at row9. So turn22 = 15 + H - 1 -> H-1 = 7 -> H=8? \n\nBut we took 7 actions: from turn15 to turn21. Then at turn22 we are at row9. So the turn index when we are at row9 is 22, which is 15 + 7. So 15 + H - 1 = 22 -> H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\nBut note: the actions are taken at turns: 15,16,17,18,19,20,21 (7 actions). And then at turn22 we are at row9. So the turn when we are at row9 is turn22, which is t1 + 7. But the problem requires that at turn t1 + H - 1 we are at row9. So:\n\nt1 + H - 1 = 15 + H - 1 = 22 -> H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\nBut then we have 8 actions? But we only have 7 actions? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1: \n  a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd the state at turn t1+H-1 is the result after taking the last action (which is at turn t1+H-1). \n\nBut note: the action a_{t1} is taken at turn t1, and it affects the state at turn t1+1.\n\nSo after the last action a_{t1+H-1} (taken at turn t1+H-1), the state at turn t1+H is set. However, the problem says we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nBut at turn t1+H-1, we have taken H-1 actions? How?\n\nActually, the initial state is at turn t1 (without having taken any action in the sequence). Then:\n\n- At turn t1: we are at initial state: y_{t1} = 3.\n- We take action a_{t1} at turn t1 -> this leads to state at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta.\n- Then we take action a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1 -> state at turn t1+2.\n- ...\n- We take action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1 -> state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That doesn't match because after the last action we are at turn t1+H.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThis suggests that we are at row9 at turn t1+H-1. How can that be?\n\nUnless we consider that we are at row9 without having taken an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut note: we start at turn t1 at row3. We take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after having taken the actions from t1 to t1+H-2? That doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, the state at turn t1 is after 0 actions. Then after 1 action (at turn t1) we are at turn t1+1. After k actions, we are at turn t1+k.\n\nSo to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1, we need k = H-1 actions? Then we have taken H-1 actions to get to turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1: meaning we take H actions? But then we are at turn t1+H. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me reread the problem:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. But the problem says we must be at row9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis implies that we are at row9 at the turn immediately before the last action? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\". So at the turn t1+H-1, we are at row9. How did we get there? We took actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? Then the last action we take is at turn t1+H-2? But then the sequence of actions would be from t=0 to t=H-2? That would be H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut by the update rule: \n  At turn t1: we start at y0 = 3.\n  Then we take a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1: y1 = y0 + Delta(a_{t1})\n  Then we take a_{t1+1} -> at turn t1+2: y2 = y1 + Delta(a_{t1+1})\n  ...\n  After taking a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, then at turn t1+H: y_H = y_{H-1} + Delta(a_{t1+H-1})\n\nSo the state at turn t1+H-1 is y_{H-1} (which is the state after H-1 actions, and before the H-th action). But we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That is, we want to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1, meaning we are at row9 before taking the last action? Then the last action (at turn t1+H-1) would be taken while we are already at row9? But then we are already at the goal. So we don't need the last action? \n\nAlternatively, we might not take the last action? But the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me look again:\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd then in the answer format, we write actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... until the last action.\n\nBut note: the state at turn t1 is given. Then we take an action at turn t1 to move to turn t1+1. We are done when at some turn we are at (0,9). That turn is the turn when we are at the goal.\n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at turn T, then the number of actions taken is T - t1. And the sequence of actions is from turn t1 to turn T-1 (because the action at turn T-1 leads to turn T).\n\nTherefore, if we are at row9 at turn T, then we have taken T - t1 actions. And the problem says that we are at row9 at turn t1+H-1? That would imply:\n\nT = t1 + H - 1\n\nand the number of actions = H-1? But then H is the number of turns? \n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". And then the sequence has H actions? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So the number of actions is H.\n\nBut then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. We want that state to be (0,9). So we want:\n\ny_{t1+H} = 9\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is a discrepancy. I think there might be a typo in the problem statement. \n\nLooking back: the problem says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\". \n\nBut in the example above, we are at row9 at turn22. And we started at turn15. So 22 = 15 + 7. So if we set H-1=7, then H=8. But we took 7 actions (from turn15 to turn21). So the sequence would be 7 actions, but the problem requires 8 actions? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then at the turn after the last action (turn t1+H) we are at row9. But the problem explicitly says \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nI think we have to follow the problem: we must be at row9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we need to arrive at row9 at turn t1+H-1, meaning that the action taken at turn t1+H-2 is the one that moves us to row9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut then the sequence of actions is from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1? But that would be H actions, and the last action (at turn t1+H-1) would be taken when we are already at row9? That doesn't make sense because we don't need to move after arriving.\n\nI think the problem intends that we are at row9 at the turn when we finish the sequence of actions. But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\" and then \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nIt says \"turns\" H. In the context, one turn is one time step. We start at turn t1. Then we have turns t1, t1+1, t1+2, ... until we reach the goal.\n\nThe goal is reached at turn t1 + H - 1? That would mean that H-1 time steps after t1.\n\nBut typically, we start at turn t1, and after 0 turns we are at turn t1. After 1 turn (at turn t1+1) we have taken one action. So to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1, that means we have taken (t1+H-1 - t1) = H-1 actions? Then the sequence of actions should be of length H-1? But the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nLooking at the answer format: we write actions for Turn t1, Turn t1+1, ... until the last action. And then we are done.\n\nAnd the minimal number of turns H is defined as the number of turns (time steps) from the start? But the start is turn t1, and we want to be at the goal at turn T, then H = T - t1 + 1? Or H = T - t1? \n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". And then in the state we are at turn t1, and we want to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo H is such that we are at row9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, if we could go directly in 0 turns, then at turn t1 we are at row9. Then H-1=0 -> H=1. But then the sequence would have H=1 action? But we are already at row9 at turn t1, so we don't need to take any action. But the sequence is for t=0 to H-1=0, which is one term? \n\nAlternatively, if we are at row9 at turn t1, then we don't need to take any action. But the problem says \"a sequence of actions\", which might be empty? But the format might not allow that.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me assume that the problem means: we start at turn t1, and we take actions for turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at row9. But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nAnother possibility: the indexing of the turns in the state might include the starting turn. But the actions are taken at the beginning of the turn.\n\nI think the safest is to follow the problem literally: we must have the player at row9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn our earlier plan, we are at row9 at turn22. So if we set t1+H-1 = 22, then 15+H-1=22 -> H=8.\n\nBut then we must provide a sequence of 8 actions (from turn15 to turn22? But then at turn22 we are taking an action, but we are already at row9? We cannot move up from row9.\n\nAlternatively, we might not need to take an action at the turn when we are at row9. But the sequence must have H=8 actions.\n\nSo let's re-simulate for 8 actions, and try to be at row9 at turn22 (which is 15+7) so at turn15+7 = 22, we are at row9. But then the action at turn22 is not needed? But the sequence goes up to turn15+7=22? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: a_{t1+0} to a_{t1+H-1}. For H=8, we have actions at turns 15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22.\n\nBut at turn22, we are already at row9 (if we arrived at turn22), so we don't need to take an action at turn22. And we cannot move up from row9.\n\nSo this suggests we must arrive at row9 at turn22, and then at turn22 we take an action? That doesn't make sense.\n\nUnless we arrive at row9 at turn22 by the action taken at turn21. So the action at turn21 is the last action, and then at turn22 we are at row9. And then we don't need to take an action at turn22. But the sequence for H=8 would include an action at turn22? That would be redundant.\n\nTherefore, I think there is a mistake in the problem statement. It should be that we are at row9 at turn t1+H. Then we take H actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1) and at turn t1+H we are at row9.\n\nIn that case, our earlier plan has H=7 actions and we are at row9 at turn22 = 15+7.\n\nSo I will assume that the problem meant: we are at row9 at turn t1+H, and the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is H actions.\n\nAnd the minimal H is the number of actions.\n\nBut to be safe, let's see if we can do it in less than 7 actions.\n\nThe minimal without obstacles is 6 actions: \n  U at turn15: to row4 at turn16\n  U at turn16: to row5 at turn17 -> but we saw that row5 at turn17 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid that. Is there a way to do it in 6 actions? We would have to be at row9 at turn21.\n\nBut we have to pass through row5 at some turn. When is row5 safe?\n\nRow5 is safe at turn T if 0 is not in any of the three intervals at that turn.\n\nThe dangerous car on row5 is car3: [-35+12*(T-15), -24+12*(T-15)]\n\nWe need 0 not in [-35+12k, -24+12k] for k = T-15.\n\nAlso, the other cars are not covering 0.\n\nCar3: 0 in [ -35+12k, -24+12k ]  <=> \n  -35+12k <= 0 <= -24+12k\n  => 12k <= 35 -> k <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, and 12k>=24 -> k>=2.\n\nSo for k=2: T-15=2 -> T=17: the interval is [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> includes 0 -> unsafe.\nk=3: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo row5 is unsafe at turn17, safe at turn18 and after.\n\nSimilarly, we can check other turns.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at row5 at turn17. So we must be at row5 at turn18 or later.\n\nThe earliest we can be at row5 is turn18.\n\nThen the earliest we can be at row9 is turn18 + 4 = turn22 (because row5->6 at turn19, 6->7 at20, 7->8 at21, 8->9 at22).\n\nSo minimal actions: 7 actions (turn15 to turn21) to arrive at turn22.\n\nTherefore, H=7.\n\nAnd the sequence we have:\n\nTurn15: S (to stay at row3 for turn16)\nTurn16: U (to row4 at turn17)\nTurn17: U (to row5 at turn18)\nTurn18: U (to row6 at turn19)\nTurn19: U (to row7 at turn20)\nTurn20: U (to row8 at turn21)\nTurn21: U (to row9 at turn22)\n\nBut we must verify the entire path for safety:\n\nWe are at:\n- Turn15: at row3 -> safe (as above)\n- Turn16: we are at row3 (because we did S at turn15) -> we must check row3 at turn16: \n    Freeway3: [1+48*(16-15)=1+48=49, 48+48=96] -> [49,96] -> safe? But wait, we are on row3 at turn16. \n    However, freeway3 at turn16: T=16, T-15=1 -> [1+48*1=49, 48+48=96] -> safe.\n\n- Turn17: we are at row4 (because at turn16 we did U) -> check row4 at turn17: \n    Freeway4: [1+48*2=97, 48+96=144] -> [97,144] -> safe.\n\n- Turn18: at row5 -> as above, safe.\n\n- Turn19: at row6 -> safe (as above)\n\n- Turn20: at row7 -> safe\n\n- Turn21: at row8 -> safe\n\n- Turn22: at row9 -> safe (no cars)\n\nSo the sequence of actions is 7 actions: S, U, U, U, U, U, U.\n\nBut is there a faster way? We must be at row5 at turn18 at the earliest. Then we need 4 more moves to get to row9: that's turn22. So 7 actions is minimal.\n\nBut what if we try to go down? For example, at turn15 we go down to row2? Then we might avoid some car? But row2 might have cars and also it's away from goal.\n\nLet me check row2 at turn16 if we go down at turn15:\n\nTurn15: D -> then at turn16 we are at row2.\n\nCheck row2 at turn16: freeway2 has two cars at T=16 (k=1):\n  car1: [-23+6*1=-17, -12+6=-6] -> 0 is not in [-17,-6]? \n  car2: [25+6=31, 36+6=42] -> safe.\n\nThen we could then go up? But then we are at row3 at turn17, then row4 at turn18, row5 at turn19 -> then row6 at20, row7 at21, row8 at22, row9 at23. That's 8 actions -> worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nAlternatively, at turn15 we go up to row4? Then at turn16 we are at row4: safe (as above). Then at turn16 we cannot go to row5 at turn17 because that would be unsafe. So we must stay at row4 at turn17? Then at turn17 we are at row4, then at turn18 we go to row5 (safe). Then same as before: row5 at turn18, row6 at19, row7 at20, row8 at21, row9 at22. So actions:\n\nTurn15: U (to row4 at turn16)\nTurn16: S (stay at row4 for turn17)\nTurn17: U (to row5 at turn18)\n... same as before but we did U then S instead of S then U. That also takes 7 actions: U, S, U, U, U, U, U -> 7 actions and arrive at turn22.\n\nSame number.\n\nBut in the first plan we did S then U, and this one U then S. Both are 7 actions.\n\nIs one safer? In the first plan, at turn16 we were at row3, which was safe. In this plan, at turn16 we are at row4: safe. At turn17 we are at row4: safe. Then same.\n\nBut note: in the first plan, we did S at turn15 and then U at turn16. In the second, we did U at turn15 and then S at turn16.\n\nWe can choose either. But the problem asks for minimal H, and both are 7.\n\nBut perhaps we can check if there is a sequence that takes only 6 actions? We need to be at row9 at turn21.\n\nTo be at row9 at turn21, we must have been at row8 at turn20. Then row7 at19, row6 at18, row5 at17. But we cannot be at row5 at turn17. Therefore, 6 actions are impossible.\n\nSo minimal H=7.\n\nNow, we have two sequences:\n\nOption1: [S, U, U, U, U, U, U]\nOption2: [U, S, U, U, U, U, U]\n\nBut we must verify both for safety.\n\nOption1 (S at turn15, then U at turn16, etc.):\n\nTurn15: action S -> then at turn16 we are at row3. Check row3 at turn16: freeway3 at T=16: [1+48=49, 48+48=96] -> safe.\nTurn16: action U -> at turn17 we are at row4. Check row4 at turn17: [1+48*2=97, 48+96=144] -> safe.\nTurn17: action U -> at turn18 we are at row5. Safe as above.\n...\n\nOption2 (U at turn15, then S at turn16):\n\nTurn15: action U -> at turn16 we are at row4. Check row4 at turn16: freeway4 at T=16: [1+48=49, 48+48=96] -> safe? \n  But note: T=16, T-15=1 -> [1+48*1=49, 48+48=96] -> safe.\n\nTurn16: action S -> then at turn17 we are at row4. Check row4 at turn17: [1+48*2=97, 48+96=144] -> safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nWe can choose either. Let's choose the first one: S then U.\n\nBut note: we start at row3. If we do S at turn15, we stay at row3 for turn16. Then U to row4 at turn17, etc.\n\nThe sequence for actions:\n\nTurn15: S\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\n\nThis gets us to row9 at turn22.\n\nBut the problem says we must be at row9 at turn t1+H-1 = 15+H-1.\n\nWe are at row9 at turn22. So 15+H-1=22 -> H=8.\n\nBut we only have 7 actions. The problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which would be 8 actions if H=8.\n\nThis is the discrepancy.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the problem likely meant that we are at row9 at turn t1+H, and the number of actions is H, and the actions are from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen we have H=7, and we are at row9 at turn22.\n\nAnd the sequence is 7 actions.\n\nBut the problem explicitly states: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nTo resolve, let me assume that the turn index when we are at row9 is t1 + H - 1. Then in our case, we are at row9 at turn22, so 15 + H - 1 = 22 -> H=8.\n\nThen we must provide 8 actions. But then what is the eighth action? We are at row9 at turn22, which is after 7 actions. Then at turn22 we are at row9, and we take an action at turn22? But we are already at the goal. The action at turn22 would be either S, U, or D. If we do U, we cannot. If we do D, we go to row8, which is not goal. If we do S, we stay.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require that we stay at the goal; it only requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9. So at turn22 we are at row9, and then we take an action at turn22 (which is the eighth action) and then at turn23 we are somewhere else? That doesn't make sense for the goal.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem has a typo and it should be that we are at row9 at turn t1+H.\n\nAnd the minimal H is the number of actions.\n\nGiven that, we output H=7 and the sequence of 7 actions.\n\nBut to match the problem's requirement, we might have to be at row9 at turn15+H-1.\n\nSo if we want to be at row9 at turn21 (which is 15+6), then we would need H-1=6 -> H=7, and we are at row9 at turn21.\n\nBut in our simulation, we are at row9 at turn22.\n\nHow to be at row9 at turn21? That would require that we are at row8 at turn20, and then we do U at turn20 to be at row9 at turn21.\n\nSo we need to be at row8 at turn20.\n\nThen we need to be at row7 at turn19, row6 at turn18, row5 at turn17. But we cannot be at row5 at turn17.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at row9 at turn21.\n\nThe earliest is turn22.\n\nSo if the problem requires at turn15+H-1=22, then H=8.\n\nThen we must have 8 actions. And we are at row9 at turn22.\n\nThen the eighth action (at turn22) we can do 'S' to stay at row9.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn15: S\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: S\n\nThen at turn22 we are at row9 (from the action at turn21: U from row8 to row9 at turn22). Then at turn22 we do S to stay.\n\nAnd then at turn23 we would be at row9, but we don't care.\n\nBut the problem only requires that at turn t1+H-1 = 15+8-1=22 we are at row9. We are at row9 at turn22, so it satisfies.\n\nAnd the action at turn22 is S, which is valid.\n\nSo this works.\n\nTherefore, H=8, and the sequence is:\n\nTurn15: S\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: S\n\nBut is there a sequence without the extra S? For example, can we be at row9 at turn21? We saw that we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, can we reach row9 earlier by a different route? For example, if we go to row4 at turn16, then to row5 at turn18 (by waiting at row4 at turn17) then to row6 at19, row7 at20, row8 at21, row9 at22. Same as before.\n\nOr if we go down to row2 then up, it takes more turns.\n\nSo we must have the last action at turn22.\n\nTherefore, we go with this.\n\nBut note: at turn22 we are at row9, and we do S. But the collision check at turn22: we are on row9, and there are no cars on row9, so safe.\n\nSo the full sequence in the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=8.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=7 that gets us to row9 at turn21? We concluded no.\n\nAnother idea: can we skip some rows by going faster? No, because we can only change by at most 1 per turn.\n\nOr use down actions to avoid by waiting at a lower row? But that would take more turns.\n\nTherefore, this is minimal.\n\nBut wait, in the sequence above, we used 8 actions to get to row9 at turn22, but then we did an extra S at turn22. Do we need that extra action? \n\nThe problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9. In our sequence without the last S:\n\nActions from turn15 to turn21: 7 actions. Then at turn22 we are at row9. So turn22 = t1+7. If we set H=8, then t1+H-1=15+8-1=22, and we are at row9 at turn22. But then we must have 8 actions. The eighth action is at turn22, which we set to S.\n\nBut without the eighth action, we are already at row9 at turn22. The eighth action is taken at turn22, and then it doesn't change the state at turn22 (because the state at turn22 is before the action). \n\nRecall: the action taken at turn t affects the state at turn t+1.\n\n- At turn15: action a15 -> state at turn16.\n- ...\n- At turn21: action a21 -> state at turn22.\n- At turn22: action a22 -> state at turn23.\n\nSo if we are at row9 at turn22, that is the result of action a21 at turn21. \n\nThen to have turn22 be the turn when we are at row9, we only need actions up to turn21. The action at turn22 is not needed for reaching the goal at turn22.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be only 7 actions: turn15 to turn21.\n\nThen at turn22 we are at row9.\n\nSo turn22 = t1+7 = 15+7.\n\nIf we set H=7, then t1+H-1=15+7-1=21. But at turn21 we are at row8 (because the action at turn21 is U, which will make us at row9 at turn22). So at turn21 we are at row8, not 9.\n\nSo to be at row9 at turn21, we must have been at row8 at turn20 and done U at turn20 to be at row9 at turn21.\n\nThat requires being at row8 at turn20, which means we must have been at row7 at turn19, etc., and row5 at turn17, which is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at row9 at turn21.\n\nSo the earliest is turn22.\n\nThen to have turn22 = t1+H-1, we need 15+H-1=22 -> H=8.\n\nThen we must provide 8 actions. The first 7 actions get us to row9 at turn22, and then the eighth action at turn22 can be anything (S, for example) because we are already at row9 and the requirement is only that at turn22 we are at row9, regardless of the action taken at turn22.\n\nAnd after turn22, we don't care.\n\nSo we include the eighth action as S.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nLet me confirm the entire sequence with the eighth action:\n\n- Turn15: action S -> then at turn16: row3 (safe)\n- Turn16: action U -> at turn17: row4 (safe)\n- Turn17: action U -> at turn18: row5 (safe)\n- Turn18: action U -> at turn19: row6 (safe)\n- Turn19: action U -> at turn20: row7 (safe)\n- Turn20: action U -> at turn21: row8 (safe)\n- Turn21: action U -> at turn22: row9 (safe)\n- Turn22: action S -> at turn23: row9 (safe)\n\nAnd at turn22 (before the action) we are at row9, as required.\n\nSo it works.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 8, and the sequence is:\n\nTurn15: S\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: S\n\nSo the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn 15 in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs if, at any turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the x-coordinate 0 lies within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The player starts at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 15.\n- The minimal path without obstacles would require 6 actions (all \"U\") to move from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in 6 steps (turns 16 to 21). However, collisions must be avoided.\n- The critical point is freeway \\(y = 5\\) at turn 17 (i.e., when \\(T = 17\\) and \\(T - 15 = 2\\)):\n  - For car 3 on freeway 5: span at \\(T = 17\\) is \\([-35 + 12 \\times 2, -24 + 12 \\times 2] = [-11, 0]\\). Since 0 is in this interval, a collision occurs if the player is on \\(y = 5\\) at turn 17.\n- To avoid this, the player cannot be on \\(y = 5\\) at turn 17. The earliest safe turn for \\(y = 5\\) is turn 18 (span for car 3: \\([-35 + 12 \\times 3, -24 + 12 \\times 3] = [1, 12]\\), 0 not included).\n- Thus, the player must delay reaching \\(y = 5\\) until turn 18. This requires:\n  - At turn 16, remain at \\(y = 3\\) or move to \\(y = 4\\).\n  - At turn 17, if at \\(y = 3\\), move to \\(y = 4\\); if at \\(y = 4\\), stay or move (but cannot go to \\(y = 5\\)).\n- The path is adjusted to:\n  - Turn 16: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, cars on freeway 3 at turn 16: span \\([49, 96]\\), 0 not in span).\n  - Turn 17: \\(y = 4\\) (safe, cars on freeway 4 at turn 17: span \\([97, 144]\\), 0 not in span).\n  - Turn 18: \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as above).\n  - Then proceed upward: \\(y = 6\\) at turn 19, \\(y = 7\\) at turn 20, \\(y = 8\\) at turn 21, and \\(y = 9\\) at turn 22.\n- The sequence of actions to achieve this takes 7 actions (turns 15 to 21), arriving at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 22.\n- The problem requires \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\). With \\(t_1 = 15\\), \\(y_{15 + H - 1} = y_{22}\\) must be 9, so \\(15 + H - 1 = 22\\) gives \\(H = 8\\).\n- Thus, 8 actions are needed, with the last action (at turn 22) being \"S\" to remain at \\(y = 9\\) (no collision, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\n### Action Sequence\n- Turn 15: \"S\" (stay at \\(y = 3\\) for turn 16).\n- Turn 16: \"U\" (move to \\(y = 4\\) for turn 17).\n- Turn 17: \"U\" (move to \\(y = 5\\) for turn 18).\n- Turn 18: \"U\" (move to \\(y = 6\\) for turn 19).\n- Turn 19: \"U\" (move to \\(y = 7\\) for turn 20).\n- Turn 20: \"U\" (move to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 21).\n- Turn 21: \"U\" (move to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 22).\n- Turn 22: \"S\" (stay at \\(y = 9\\), required for \\(H = 8\\)).\n\n### Verification\n- Turn 16 (\\(y = 3\\)): freeway 3 cars at \\(T=16\\): \\([49, 96]\\), safe.\n- Turn 17 (\\(y = 4\\)): freeway 4 cars at \\(T=17\\): \\([97, 144]\\), safe.\n- Turn 18 (\\(y = 5\\)): freeway 5 cars at \\(T=18\\): \\([49, 60]\\), \\([85, 96]\\), \\([1, 12]\\), safe.\n- Turn 19 (\\(y = 6\\)): freeway 6 cars at \\(T=19\\): \\([61, 72]\\), \\([97, 108]\\), \\([13, 24]\\), safe.\n- Turn 20 (\\(y = 7\\)): freeway 7 cars at \\(T=20\\): \\([73, 84]\\), \\([109, 120]\\), \\([25, 36]\\), safe.\n- Turn 21 (\\(y = 8\\)): freeway 8 cars at \\(T=21\\): \\([289, 336]\\), safe.\n- Turn 22 (\\(y = 9\\)): no cars, safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 8\\) turns, which is minimal due to the unavoidable delay at \\(y = 5\\).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 16, player starts at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H.\n\nImportant: The grid has y from 0 to 9. The freeways (where cars are) are y=1 to y=8. The player moves in the y-direction (vertical) and the cars move horizontally. The player is at x=0 (always) and we care about the cars that are on the freeway corresponding to the player's y at a given turn.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and at that turn, for any car on freeway k, the car's span at turn T contains 0 (the player's x-coordinate).\n\nNote: The player's movement:\n  - At turn t, the player is at y_t.\n  - They choose an action a_t (U, D, S) which determines y_{t+1}.\n  - When moving (at turn T from y_T to y_{T+1}), note that at turn T the player is on freeway y_T. Then at turn T+1, they are on freeway y_{T+1}. So when moving from y to y+1 at turn T, at that turn T the player is on y, and then at turn T+1 they are on y+1.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision, at each turn T (from t1 to t1+H-1) we must ensure that if the player is on freeway k (which is y_T) then no car on freeway k has a span that contains 0 at turn T.\n\nGiven the car update rules:\n\nFor a car given at initial turn t1 (which is 16) with (head, tail, direction, speed):\n\n- For left-moving (if direction is left): the span at time T (>=t1) is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]?\nBut note the problem states:\n  - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, note the representation for right-moving: at t1, the span is [tau, h] meaning from tau to h (with tau < h). Then at T, it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: at t1, [h, tau] but note that for left-moving, the head is the leftmost? Actually, the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\", but for left-moving, the head is at the left? Let me see the example: left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. Since the car is moving left, the entire span shifts left. So if at t1, the car covers from h (left) to tau (right) and h < tau? But the problem writes [h, tau] for left and [tau, h] for right? That seems inconsistent because in the right-moving, [tau, h] with tau < h? Actually, the problem states:\n\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the right-moving example, they write (42, 31, right, 6) ... wait, that has head=42 and tail=31? But 42>31. So for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? And tail is the leftmost? Because then the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [31,42] which is from 31 to 42. Then at T, it becomes [31+6*(T-16), 42+6*(T-16)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if we had one, the head would be the leftmost and tail the rightmost? But the problem doesn't give any left-moving in this state.\n\nLooking at the given cars:\n\nAll cars in this state are right-moving? Because direction is \"right\".\n\nSo for each car on a freeway, we have:\n\n  initial turn t1=16: \n    (head, tail, direction, speed) -> for right-moving, the initial span is [tail, head] (since the representation is (head, tail) but then the span is [tail, head]? Actually, the problem says for right: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So the tail is the left end and head is the right end.\n\nBut look at the data:\n\n  Freeway 1: two cars: \n      car1: (-6, -17, right, 6) -> so tail = -17, head = -6? Then initial span at t1=16 is [-17, -6]. \n      car2: (42, 31, right, 6) -> tail=31, head=42? Then span at t1=16 is [31,42].\n\nBut wait, the car1 has head=-6 and tail=-17, meaning the car is from -17 to -6? That is, the left end is -17 and the right end is -6. Then as time goes, the car moves right: so at time T, the span is [ -17 + 6*(T-16), -6 + 6*(T-16) ].\n\nSimilarly, car2: [31 + 6*(T-16), 42 + 6*(T-16)].\n\nNow, we are only concerned when the player is on freeway k and at that turn T, does the car's span include 0?\n\nSo for a given freeway k and turn T, we check every car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nOur goal: start at y=3 at turn 16, and we want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible without colliding.\n\nThe minimal number of moves? The player must go from 3 to 9, which is 6 steps up. But we can also move down or stay, so the minimal without obstacles would be 6 moves (all U). However, we have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at 0.\n\nBut note: we start at turn 16 at y=3. Then at turn 16, we are on freeway 3? But wait: the freeways are y=1 to 8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars). Therefore, we start at y=3 (freeway 3) and we end at y=9 (safe). Also, we can be at y=0 (safe) but we start at y=3 and we are going to 9, so we don't need to go to 0.\n\nWe can plan a path: we have to go from 3 to 9: so we need at least 6 moves (U). But we might have to wait (S) or even go down (D) to avoid a collision.\n\nWe need to simulate the car positions at each future turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 16 onward. We are at turn 16: y=3.\n\nWe need to know for each freeway (1 to 8) and for each turn T (>=16) whether there is a car that covers 0 at that turn.\n\nLet me precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for a range of turns (say from 16 to 16+20, because we expect H to be around 6-20) whether the freeway is safe (no car at 0) or not.\n\nBut note: the player might be at freeway k at turn T only if we plan to be there. We are going to plan the path.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (relative to 16) the set of turns T at which freeway k is unsafe (has a car covering 0).\n\nThen we can do a BFS (or Dijkstra, but all moves cost 1) over states (turn, y) to find the minimal H to reach y=9.\n\nHowever, note that the turn is absolute and we start at turn 16. The state: (t, y) with t>=16 and y in [0,9]. We start at (16,3). We want to reach any (t,9) for minimal t-16 (i.e., minimal turns).\n\nBut note: the car positions depend on t (absolute turn). So we can precompute for each freeway k and for each absolute turn t (from 16 to, say, 40) whether freeway k is safe at turn t.\n\nHow to compute for a freeway k and turn t (absolute) whether it is safe?\n\nWe look at the cars on freeway k (as given at turn 16) and compute their spans at turn t.\n\nThen, if for any car on freeway k, the span at turn t contains 0, then unsafe. Otherwise, safe.\n\nNote: the freeway k has the cars as listed. For example, freeway 1 has two cars.\n\nLet me define a function safe(k, t) for k in {1..8} and t>=16.\n\nFor freeway k, we have the list of cars: (head, tail, d, s). Since all are right-moving, we can compute:\n\nFor a car (head, tail, d, s) on freeway k (and note: the direction is right, so d='right'):\n\n  initial_span_left = tail\n  initial_span_right = head\n\nAt turn t (absolute), the car moves right by s*(t-16). So:\n\n  left_end = tail + s*(t-16)\n  right_end = head + s*(t-16)\n\nThen, the car covers 0 if and only if:\n\n  left_end <= 0 <= right_end\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving we would have:\n\n  left_end = head - s*(t-16)\n  right_end = tail - s*(t-16)\n\nBut in this problem, all cars are right-moving? Yes, according to the given data.\n\nSo we only need the right-moving formula.\n\nNow, let's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars\n  carA: tail=-17, head=-6, s=6\n  carB: tail=31, head=42, s=6\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1? \n  cars: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6) -> wait, the first car: head=-6, tail=-17? Then that's the same as freeway1 carA? \n  But note: the representation: (head, tail) -> so for freeway2, car1: head=-6, tail=-17 -> same as freeway1 carA? But freeway1 carA was (-6,-17) and freeway2 car1 is (-6,-17)? \n  Actually, freeway1: first car: (-6,-17) -> so head=-6, tail=-17 -> that means the car is from -17 to -6? But then freeway2: (-6,-17) -> same? and (42,31) -> same as freeway1? \n\nWait, the table says:\n\nFreeway 1: (-6, -17, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6) -> so two cars.\n\nFreeway 2: same: (-6, -17, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6) -> same two cars.\n\nFreeway 3: (96,49,right,48) -> one car: tail=49, head=96? Then the car is from 49 to 96? Then at time t, the span is [49+48*(t-16), 96+48*(t-16)].\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway3: (96,49,right,48) -> one car.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\n  car1: tail=25, head=36 -> [25+12*(t-16), 36+12*(t-16)]\n  car2: tail=-59, head=-48 -> [-59+12*(t-16), -48+12*(t-16)]\n  car3: tail=-23, head=-12 -> [-23+12*(t-16), -12+12*(t-16)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway5: same three cars.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway5: same three cars.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway3 and freeway4: (96,49,right,48) -> one car.\n\nNow, we need to compute for each freeway k and for each absolute turn t (starting at 16) whether 0 is in any of the car spans.\n\nBut note: the player is only concerned with the freeway when they are on it at that turn.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k a set of unsafe turns (or safe turns) in the range we are interested.\n\nWe are going to simulate from t=16 to t=16+max_depth, say 30.\n\nLet me compute the unsafe intervals for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (two cars):\n\n  carA: [ -17 + 6*(t-16), -6 + 6*(t-16) ] contains 0?\n      -17 + 6*(t-16) <= 0 <= -6 + 6*(t-16)\n      Solve: \n        -17 + 6*(t-16) <= 0  => 6*(t-16) <= 17 => t-16 <= 17/6 ≈ 2.83 -> t <= 16+2.83 -> t<=18.83 -> so t<=18? (since integer) \n        and 0 <= -6 + 6*(t-16) => 6 <= 6*(t-16) => 1 <= t-16 => t>=17.\n      So for carA: unsafe when 17<=t<=18.\n\n  carB: [31+6*(t-16), 42+6*(t-16)] contains 0?\n      31+6*(t-16) <= 0? -> 6*(t-16) <= -31 -> which is impossible since t>=16 -> so never.\n\n  Therefore, freeway1 is unsafe at t=17 and t=18.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1 -> unsafe at t=17,18.\n\nFreeway 3: one car: [49+48*(t-16), 96+48*(t-16)] \n  This is always positive? Since t>=16 -> 49+48*(t-16) >= 49 >0. So never covers 0. Safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway3 -> safe.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars.\n\n  car1: [25+12*(t-16), 36+12*(t-16)] -> \n      25+12*(t-16) <=0? -> 12*(t-16) <= -25 -> t-16 <= -25/12 ≈ -2.08 -> impossible. So safe for car1.\n\n  car2: [-59+12*(t-16), -48+12*(t-16)] \n      We require: \n        -59+12*(t-16) <=0 and 0<= -48+12*(t-16)\n        First: -59+12*(t-16)<=0 -> 12*(t-16)<=59 -> t-16<=59/12≈4.916 -> t<=20.916 -> so t<=20\n        Second: 0<= -48+12*(t-16) -> 48<=12*(t-16) -> 4<=t-16 -> t>=20.\n      So unsafe when t>=20 and t<=20? Only t=20? \n        Check: at t=20: \n          left = -59+12*(4) = -59+48 = -11\n          right = -48+12*4 = -48+48=0\n          So the span is [-11,0]. This includes 0? Yes, because 0 is the right endpoint? The problem: the span is [left, right] and 0 is included if left<=0<=right. So at t=20: left=-11<=0 and 0<=0 -> true. So unsafe at t=20.\n\n      Also at t=19?\n        t=19: left=-59+12*3=-59+36=-23, right=-48+36=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> 0 is not in this interval? So safe at t=19.\n      t=21: left=-59+12*5=-59+60=1, right=-48+60=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n      So car2: unsafe only at t=20.\n\n  car3: [-23+12*(t-16), -12+12*(t-16)]\n      Condition: \n        -23+12*(t-16)<=0 and 0<= -12+12*(t-16)\n        First: -23+12*(t-16)<=0 -> 12*(t-16)<=23 -> t-16<=23/12≈1.916 -> t<=17.916 -> so t<=17\n        Second: 0<= -12+12*(t-16) -> 12<=12*(t-16) -> 1<=t-16 -> t>=17\n        So unsafe when t=17? \n          Check t=17: left=-23+12*1=-11, right=-12+12=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes.\n\n      So unsafe at t=17.\n\n  Therefore, freeway5: unsafe at t=17 (from car3) and t=20 (from car2).\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5 -> unsafe at t=17,20.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway5 -> unsafe at t=17,20.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway3 -> safe.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways by turn:\n\nTurn 16: \n  freeway1: safe?

So safe for t>=21.\n  Similarly others are safe.\n\nSo summary by turn for freeways:\n\nTurn 16: all safe except none? -> all safe.\nTurn 17: unsafe on freeways 1,2,5,6,7.\nTurn 18: unsafe on freeways 1,2.\nTurn 19: all safe.\nTurn 20: unsafe on freeways 5,6,7.\nTurn 21+: safe.\n\nNow, we start at turn16, y=3. We need to go to y=9.\n\nWe can move: U (up to y+1), D (down to y-1), S (stay).\n\nConstraints: y must be in [0,9]. And at each turn, if the player is on a freeway (y in [1,8]) then that freeway must be safe at that turn.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS over (t, y) where t is the absolute turn and y is the position.\n\nWe start at (16,3). We want to reach any (t,9) for minimal t.\n\nThe actions: at state (t,y), we can choose an action a in {U, D, S} leading to:\n\n  If a=U: then y_next = y+1 (if y<9) -> then at turn t+1, we are at (t+1, y+1)\n  If a=D: then y_next = y-1 (if y>0) -> then at turn t+1, we are at (t+1, y-1)\n  If a=S: then y_next = y -> then at turn t+1, we are at (t+1, y)\n\nBut note: at the starting state (16,3): we are at turn 16 and we are about to choose an action for turn 16? \n\nThe problem says: we are at turn t1 (16) and we are at (0, y_{t1} = (0,3). Then we choose a sequence of actions starting at turn t1: {a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ... until we reach (0,9) at some turn.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn t: we are at (0, y_t). Then we choose a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, and then at turn t+1 we are at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nAnd the collision check: at turn t, we are at y_t. So we check the freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nTherefore, when we are at state (t, y_t), we are about to choose a_t. Then:\n\n  - We check: if y_t is in [1,8], then we require that freeway y_t is safe at turn t. If not, then we cannot be at this state? \n\nBut wait, we are already at this state? Actually, we start at (16,3): so we must check freeway3 at turn16? \n\nBut the problem says: collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and at that turn, 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn 16, we are at y=3 (freeway3) and we are about to choose an action. But we must not be in collision at the start of the turn? \n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nSo we must check: at turn T, the player is at (0,y_T) and we require that freeway y_T at turn T is safe.\n\nTherefore, the state (t,y) must be safe: meaning if y in [1,8], then the freeway y at turn t must be safe.\n\nBut note: the starting state (16,3) is safe because we computed freeway3 at turn16 is safe.\n\nThen we choose an action a_16, which leads to y_17 = y_16 + delta.\n\nThen at turn17, we are at (0,y_17) and we check freeway y_17 at turn17.\n\nSo in BFS:\n\n  We start at (16,3) [which is safe] and we consider the next actions.\n\n  We generate (17, y') for y' in {2,3,4} (if we choose D, S, U respectively) but note:\n\n    a_16 = D -> y_17 = 3-1=2\n    a_16 = S -> y_17 = 3\n    a_16 = U -> y_17 = 4\n\n  Then we check the state (17, y'): if y' in [1,8] then we require that freeway y' at turn17 is safe.\n\n  For example:\n      (17,2): freeway2 at turn17 -> unsafe! (from our summary: freeway2 unsafe at turn17) -> so we cannot be at (17,2).\n      (17,3): freeway3 at turn17 -> safe? (freeway3 is always safe) -> safe.\n      (17,4): freeway4 at turn17 -> safe.\n\n  So from (16,3) we can only go to (17,3) or (17,4) but not (17,2).\n\nThen we continue.\n\nWe want the minimal H (number of turns) such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9? \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions: we take H actions: from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at position (0,9).\n\nSo after H actions, at turn = t1 + H, we are at y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\n  At turn t1 (16): we are at (0,3). Then we choose a_{16}. Then we move to y_{17} = 3 + delta(a_16).\n\n  Then at turn 17, we are at (0, y_17). Then we choose a_{17}, and so on.\n\n  We stop when we are at y = 9. But when? After the last action, we are at the next turn.\n\n  Example: if we do 6 U actions:\n\n      turn16: a16=U -> y17=4\n      turn17: a17=U -> y18=5\n      turn18: a18=U -> y19=6\n      turn19: a19=U -> y20=7\n      turn20: a20=U -> y21=8\n      turn21: a21=U -> y22=9\n\n  So we take 6 actions (from turn16 to turn21) and at turn22 we are at 9. But the problem says we must reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n  The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\n  But note the definition: we are to determine H and the sequence of actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1 such that at the end of the sequence (i.e., after the last action) we are at (0,9). \n\n  How is the last action defined? \n\n  We start at turn t1 at (0, y_{t1}). Then we take action at turn t1, which moves us to y_{t1+1}. Then we take action at turn t1+1, and so on, until we take action at turn t1+H-1, which moves us to y_{t1+H}. And we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n  Therefore, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\n  So H is the number of actions? and the last state we reach is at turn t1+H.\n\n  But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" ? \n\n  Let me re-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n  and then in the answer format, we write actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-1.\n\n  So after H actions (from turn t1 to t1+H-1) we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\n  Therefore, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H, and we have taken H actions.\n\n  So the state we are interested in for the goal is (t,9) for some t>=16, and we want minimal t-16? Actually, minimal H (the number of actions) such that we end at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". So H is the number of turns? But the sequence has H actions, meaning we use H turns (from turn t1 to t1+H-1) and then at turn t1+H we are at 9.\n\n  Alternatively, we can think: the state (t,y) is the state at the beginning of turn t (before taking the action). Then we take an action at turn t, and then we are at state (t+1, y_{t+1}).\n\n  So the goal is to have y_{t} = 9 at the beginning of turn t? But that doesn't match because we start at turn16 at y=3. Then after an action at turn16, we are at turn17 at y=4 (if we go up). \n\n  Actually, the problem says: at turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we choose a_T, and then y_{T+1} = y_T + delta.\n\n  So the state at turn T is (T, y_T). Then we choose an action a_T, and then we get to state (T+1, y_{T+1}).\n\n  The goal: we want to be at state (T, 9) for some T? But note: if we are at state (T,9), that means at turn T we are at y=9. Then we don't need to take an action at turn T? \n\n  But the problem says: we take actions until we reach (0,9). And the sequence of actions is from turn t1 to ... until we have reached 9.\n\n  How do we know when we have reached 9? After taking an action at turn T-1, we become at turn T at position 9. So we stop at the beginning of turn T? But we don't take an action at turn T.\n\n  Therefore, the sequence of actions is for the turns when we are not at 9. We stop when we are at 9 at the beginning of the turn.\n\n  So the goal state is (T,9) for some T. And we start at (16,3). We take actions at turn 16, 17, ... until we are at (T,9). The number of actions taken is T - 16.\n\n  Because at turn16: we take action a16 -> leads to (17, y17)\n  at turn17: we take action a17 -> leads to (18, y18)\n  ...\n  at turn T-1: we take action a_{T-1} -> leads to (T,9)\n\n  So the number of actions H = T - 16.\n\n  And the sequence is for turns 16 to T-1 (inclusive).\n\n  Therefore, we want minimal T such that we can get to (T,9) and T-16 is minimal? Actually, minimal T-16 (which is H) is the same as minimal T? \n\n  But note: we might have to wait, so T might be larger. We want the minimal number of actions, which is H = T-16.\n\n  So we want to minimize T-16.\n\n  We can do BFS over states (t,y) for t>=16 and y in [0,9]. We start at (16,3) with cost=0 (no actions taken yet). Then we take an action: cost becomes 1, and we go to (t+1, y') and then we check that state.\n\n  But note: when we are at (t,y), we are going to take an action at turn t. But we must check: at state (t,y) (which is the beginning of turn t) we are safe: if y in [1,8], then freeway y at turn t must be safe.\n\n  Then we choose an action and move to (t+1, y').\n\n  Then we check the state (t+1,y') for safety? Actually, when we get to (t+1,y'), we are at the beginning of turn t+1, and we must check that state for safety.\n\n  So the BFS:\n\n    Let Q be a queue: (t, y, actions_so_far) or we can store the path.\n\n    We start: (16,3, []) -> cost=0.\n\n    Then we consider all actions:\n\n        a = U: then next state (17, 4) -> but we must check (17,4): safe? freeway4 at turn17 -> safe (from above). Then we push (17,4, ['U']) with cost=1.\n\n        a = S: next state (17,3) -> freeway3 at turn17: safe -> push (17,3, ['S'])\n\n        a = D: next state (17,2) -> freeway2 at turn17: unsafe -> skip.\n\n    Then from (17,3): we can do:\n\n        a = U: (18,4) -> freeway4 at turn18: safe? freeway4 is safe at turn18 -> push (18,4, ['S','U'])\n        a = S: (18,3) -> freeway3 at turn18: safe -> push (18,3, ['S','S'])\n        a = D: (18,2) -> freeway2 at turn18: unsafe (turn18: freeway2 is unsafe) -> skip.\n\n    From (17,4): \n        a=U: (18,5) -> freeway5 at turn18: safe? (turn18: freeway5 is safe) -> push (18,5, ['U','U'])\n        a=S: (18,4) -> safe\n        a=D: (18,3) -> safe\n\n    Then we continue until we get to (t,9) for some t.\n\n    We want the minimal t-16 (which is the number of actions).\n\n    We can break when we first reach a state (t,9) because we are doing BFS by time.\n\n    Since all moves cost 1, we can do BFS by time (i.e., increasing t).\n\n    We note that we can also have cycles? But we are minimizing time, so we don't want to revisit the same state (t,y) because if we get to (t,y) by two different paths, the one that got there earlier is better. So we can mark visited states (t,y) and skip if we have been at (t,y) with a time that is not worse? Actually, if we get to (t,y) at an earlier time, that's better. So if we have been to (t,y) at time t, and we get there again at the same time? Then it's the same. And if we get there at a later time, we skip.\n\n    Therefore, we can keep a visited set: (t,y). If we have seen (t,y), we skip.\n\n    We start BFS:\n\n      Level 0 (t=16): (16,3) -> safe.\n\n      Level 1 (t=17): \n          (17,3): safe -> from (16,3) via 'S'\n          (17,4): safe -> from (16,3) via 'U'\n\n      Level 2 (t=18):\n          From (17,3):\n              U -> (18,4) -> safe -> new state\n              S -> (18,3) -> safe -> new state\n              D -> (18,2) -> unsafe -> skip\n          From (17,4):\n              U -> (18,5) -> freeway5 at turn18: safe? -> yes -> new state\n              S -> (18,4) -> safe -> but we already have (18,4) from above? but we can have multiple ways? but we want minimal time, so we record the first time we get to (18,4) and then skip if we see it again? Actually, at the same time? Then we can have multiple paths? But we don't care about the path until we reach the goal? Actually, we need the action sequence.\n\n          So we record the state (t,y) and the path (or the action that got there) and we want the minimal t for the goal.\n\n          We can store the best (earliest) time we reached (y) but note: we might have multiple ways to the same (t,y). Since we are doing BFS by time (each step increases t by 1), we can store the state (t,y) and if we have been to (t,y) we skip.\n\n      We continue until we hit (t,9) for some t.\n\n    The minimal t such that we can be at (t,9) is what we want, and then H = t-16.\n\n    Then the action sequence: the actions taken from (16,3) to (t,9) is the sequence.\n\n    Let me simulate:\n\n      Level0: t=16: (16,3) -> cost=0, actions=[].\n\n      Level1: t=17: \n          (17,3): actions=['S']\n          (17,4): actions=['U']\n\n      Level2: t=18:\n          from (17,3):\n             U -> (18,4) -> actions=['S','U']\n             S -> (18,3) -> actions=['S','S']\n             D -> skip\n          from (17,4):\n             U -> (18,5) -> actions=['U','U']\n             S -> (18,4) -> but we already have (18,4) from above? \n                However, we can store multiple ways? But we don't need: we want the minimal time to goal. But we are at the same time? So we can store the first way we get to (18,4) and then if we get again, we skip? \n                Actually, the path might matter for future moves? But the state is the same: (18,4). So we can mark (18,4) as visited and store the action sequence that got there first? But we are doing BFS by level (time) so we see all states at time 18 at the same level.\n\n          However, we don't care about storing multiple paths to the same state at the same time? We just need one minimal path.\n\n          So we can use a visited set: state (t,y) -> we mark it once we see it at time t. Then if we see it again at the same time, we skip? Or we can store multiple? But that would be inefficient.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the minimal path in terms of time is what we want, and we break when we first reach (t,9). So we can do:\n\n            We keep a visited set: for a state (t,y), we mark it as visited so we don't expand it again at the same time? Actually, we are expanding by time: we process time t, then t+1, etc. So we can store for each (t,y) the best way? But we don't need: we just need to avoid processing the same (t,y) multiple times? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let's have a dictionary: visited[t][y] = True if we have been at (t,y).\n\n          Then we start:\n\n            t=16: visited[16][3]=True.\n\n            Then for t=17: we generate (17,3) and (17,4) -> mark visited[17][3]=True, visited[17][4]=True.\n\n            Then at t=18: \n                from (17,3): \n                    (18,4): not visited -> mark visited[18][4]=True, and store it.\n                    (18,3): not visited -> mark and store.\n                from (17,4):\n                    (18,5): new -> mark and store.\n                    (18,4): already visited? -> skip? \n                    (18,3): already visited? -> skip? \n\n            But wait: from (17,4): we can also go to (18,4) and (18,3) and (18,5). But we already have (18,4) and (18,3) from (17,3). So we skip them? \n\n          However, note: the action sequence might be different? But we want minimal time to goal. The goal is to get to (t,9) as soon as possible. So we don't care about the path? We just need one path that achieves the goal at the earliest t.\n\n          But we need the action sequence. So we store the action sequence that got to (t,y) the first time we reached (t,y). Then when we get to (t,y) again by a different path, we skip because we don't need it.\n\n          Actually, if we get to (t,y) by two different paths, and then from there the future is the same? Then we can use the first one.\n\n          So we do:\n\n            We maintain a 2D array: best_time[y] = minimal time we reached y? But we care about the entire state (t,y). And we want the entire path.\n\n          Alternatively, we can store for each (t,y) the action sequence that got there. Then we do BFS by increasing t. We break when we reach (t,9) and then output the sequence.\n\n      Steps:\n\n        t=16: \n          state: (16,3) -> actions_so_far = [] -> we are not at goal.\n\n          Then we generate next states for t=17:\n\n            (17,3): from action 'S'\n            (17,4): from action 'U'\n\n        t=17: \n          Check: (17,3): not goal. Generate for t=18:\n             from (17,3):\n                 U -> (18,4) -> actions = ['S','U']\n                 S -> (18,3) -> actions = ['S','S']\n                 D -> (18,2) -> unsafe -> skip\n          Check: (17,4): not goal. Generate for t=18:\n             U -> (18,5) -> actions = ['U','U']\n             S -> (18,4) -> actions = ['U','S']  -> but we already have (18,4) from above? So we skip if we have already seen (18,4)? \n             D -> (18,3) -> actions = ['U','D'] -> but we already have (18,3) from above? skip.\n\n          So we have at t=18: \n             (18,3): ['S','S'] \n             (18,4): ['S','U'] \n             (18,5): ['U','U']\n\n        t=18:\n          Check: none is goal.\n\n          From (18,3): \n             U -> (19,4) -> freeway4 at turn19: safe -> actions = ['S','S','U']\n             S -> (19,3) -> safe -> actions = ['S','S','S']\n             D -> (19,2) -> freeway2 at turn19: safe? turn19: freeway2 is safe -> so actions = ['S','S','D'] -> but we haven't been to (19,2) -> store.\n\n          From (18,4):\n             U -> (19,5) -> freeway5 at turn19: safe? (turn19: freeway5 safe) -> actions = ['S','U','U']\n             S -> (19,4) -> freeway4: safe -> but we already have (19,4) from above? skip.\n             D -> (19,3) -> freeway3: safe -> but we already have (19,3) from above? skip.\n\n          From (18,5):\n             U -> (19,6) -> freeway6 at turn19: safe? (turn19: freeway6 safe) -> actions = ['U','U','U']\n             S -> (19,5) -> freeway5: safe -> skip? because we have (19,5) from above? no, we haven't generated (19,5) from (18,4) and (18,5) at the same time? \n                 Actually, we generated (19,5) from (18,4) and then we are about to generate (19,5) from (18,5) via S? But we skip if we have seen (19,5) at this time? \n                 We generate states for t=19 in any order? So when we process (18,4) we generated (19,5) and then when we process (18,5) we generate (19,5) again? Then we skip.\n\n             D -> (19,4) -> already generated? skip.\n\n          So at t=19: \n             (19,2): ['S','S','D']\n             (19,3): ['S','S','S']   (from (18,3) via S) and also from (18,4) via D we would have had one? but we skipped? \n             (19,4): ['S','S','U']   (from (18,3) via U) and also from (18,4) via S and from (18,5) via D? but we only store the first one we see? \n             (19,5): ['S','U','U']   (from (18,4) via U) \n             (19,6): ['U','U','U']   (from (18,5) via U)\n\n          Now, note: we might have multiple ways to the same state, but we store only the first one we see? \n\n        Continue:\n\n          We are at t=19: all freeways safe.\n\n          Now, we want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal t? \n\n          The direct path: \n             (16,3) -> (17,4) -> (18,5) -> (19,6) -> then we can do:\n\n                at (19,6): \n                  U -> (20,7) -> freeway7 at turn20: unsafe! (because turn20: freeway7 is unsafe) -> skip.\n                  S -> (20,6) -> freeway6 at turn20: unsafe -> skip.\n                  D -> (20,5) -> freeway5 at turn20: unsafe -> skip.\n\n          So the direct path is blocked at turn20.\n\n          We must avoid freeways 5,6,7 at turn20.\n\n          How? We might need to wait at a safe freeway at turn20? Or be at y=0 or 9? \n\n          But note: at turn20, if we are at y=0 or y=9, we are safe. Also freeways 1,2,3,4,8 are safe at turn20.\n\n          So we need to be at one of these at turn20.\n\n          How can we get to y=8 by turn20? \n\n          From (19,6): we can only move to y=5,6,7 at turn20? and they are unsafe.\n\n          Alternatively, from (19,5): \n             We can do: \n                U -> (20,6) -> unsafe\n                S -> (20,5) -> unsafe\n                D -> (20,4) -> freeway4: safe -> so we can go to (20,4)\n\n          From (19,4):\n             U: (20,5) -> unsafe\n             S: (20,4) -> safe -> so we can go to (20,4)\n             D: (20,3) -> freeway3: safe -> so (20,3)\n\n          From (19,3):\n             U: (20,4) -> safe\n             S: (20,3) -> safe\n             D: (20,2) -> freeway2: safe? turn20: freeway2 is safe -> so safe.\n\n          From (19,2):\n             U: (20,3) -> safe\n             S: (20,2) -> safe\n             D: (20,1) -> freeway1: safe? turn20: freeway1 safe -> safe.\n\n          So at t=20, we have:\n\n            (20,1): from (19,2) via D? \n            (20,2): from (19,2) via S or (19,3) via D?\n            (20,3): from (19,3) via S or (19,3) via U? or (19,2) via U?\n            (20,4): from (19,3) via U, (19,4) via S, (19,5) via D.\n\n          Then at turn20, we are at one of these.\n\n          Now, we need to get to 9. From (20,4): we can do:\n\n            turn20: at (20,4) -> we can choose:\n                U: (21,5) -> freeway5 at turn21: safe? (turn21: freeway5 safe) -> then we can go up from there.\n                S: (21,4) -> safe\n                D: (21,3) -> safe\n\n          The goal is 9, so we want to go up. How many steps from 4 to 9? 5 steps. \n\n          But we can also consider from (20,1): it's 8 steps away.\n\n          We want minimal total actions. We are at turn20 (so we have taken 4 actions so far: from 16 to 20 is 4 actions? because H = t - 16 = 20-16=4).\n\n          Then from (20,4) to (25,9) would be 5 more actions: total 9.\n\n          But maybe we can get there earlier? \n\n          Alternatively, we can be at (20,8) by turn20? \n\n          How? We didn't get to y=8 at turn20. The only freeway8 is safe at turn20, but how to get to y=8? \n\n          We were at turn19: the highest we had was (19,6). And we couldn't go up to (20,7) because unsafe. And from (19,6) we could only go down to (20,5) (unsafe) or stay (unsafe) or down to (20,5) (unsafe). So we couldn't get to (19,7) or (19,8) earlier? \n\n          How to get to (19,7)? \n\n          We would have to be at (18,6) then go up to (19,7). But at turn18, we didn't have (18,6). \n\n          How to get to (18,6)? \n\n          At turn17: we had (17,4) -> then at turn18: we went to (18,5) via U. We could have gone from (17,4) to (18,5) or (18,4) or (18,3). \n\n          We did not get to (17,5) at turn17? \n\n          How to get to (17,5)? \n\n          We start at (16,3): we can only go to 2,3,4 at turn17. \n\n          So we cannot be at y=5 at turn17.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot be at y=6 at turn18? \n\n          So the only way to get to y=6 is at turn19: from (18,5) via U: (19,6). \n\n          Then we are stuck at turn20: we have to be at a safe freeway: so y in {0,1,2,3,4,8,9}? But we are at y=6 at turn19, then we can only go to 5,6,7 at turn20? and they are unsafe. So we cannot be at y=8 at turn20? \n\n          Therefore, we have to be at y=1,2,3,4 at turn20.\n\n          Then we need to go from there to 9.\n\n          The minimal additional steps: from y=4 we need 5 steps (U,U,U,U,U) -> but we have to avoid turn20 for freeways 5,6,7? But after turn20, freeways 5,6,7 are safe again? \n\n          At turn21: freeways 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 are safe? \n\n          So from (20,4): \n             turn20: at (20,4) -> safe.\n             then we can do: \n                turn20: action U -> (21,5) -> freeway5 at turn21: safe -> then \n                turn21: U -> (22,6) -> freeway6 at turn22: safe? (turn22: freeway6 safe) -> then\n                turn22: U -> (23,7) -> freeway7 at turn23: safe -> then\n                turn23: U -> (24,8) -> freeway8 at turn24: safe -> then\n                turn24: U -> (25,9) -> goal.\n\n          Total actions: from turn16 to turn24: that's 8 actions? \n\n          But we started at turn16, then actions at turn16,17,...,23 -> 8 actions, then at turn25 we are at 9? \n\n          Actually: \n            turn16: action -> turn17\n            ...\n            turn24: action -> turn25: at 9.\n\n          So H=8.\n\n          Alternatively, we might find a shorter path?\n\n          What if we go faster initially? \n\n          We went: \n            turn16: U -> (17,4)\n            turn17: U -> (18,5)\n            turn18: U -> (19,6) -> then at turn19, we are stuck? we have to move down to avoid the unsafe turn20? \n\n          But from (19,6) we can only move to (20,5), (20,6), (20,7) which are all unsafe. So we cannot be at (19,6) and then do an action that gets us to a safe state at turn20? \n\n          Therefore, we must not be at (19,6) at the beginning of turn19? \n\n          How to avoid that? \n\n          We could have taken a different path: \n\n            Instead of going up three times, we could have gone up twice and then down? \n\n          Example:\n\n            turn16: U -> (17,4)\n            turn17: S -> (18,4) \n            turn18: D -> (19,3) \n\n          Then at turn19: we are at (19,3).

So we cannot leave (19,6) safely.\n\n          Therefore, we must avoid being at (19,6) at the beginning of turn19? \n\n          How about: at (18,5) we don't go up to (19,6) but go down to (19,4)? \n\n          Then:\n\n            (16,3): U -> (17,4)\n            (17,4): U -> (18,5)\n            (18,5): D -> (19,4)  -> freeway4 at turn19: safe.\n\n          Then at (19,4): we can go:\n\n            U: (20,5) -> unsafe -> skip\n            S: (20,4) -> safe -> so we can do that? \n            D: (20,3) -> safe.\n\n          Then if we go S: (20,4) -> then we can go up from there:\n\n            (20,4): U (21,5)\n            (21,5): U (22,6)\n            (22,6): U (23,7)\n            (23,7): U (24,8)\n            (24,8): U (25,9) -> 8 actions? \n\n          Actions:\n\n            t16: U\n            t17: U\n            t18: D\n            t19: S\n            t20: U\n            t21: U\n            t22: U\n            t23: U\n            t24: U -> then at turn25 we are at 9.\n\n          So 9 actions? \n\n          Count: from t16 to t24: that's 9 actions? \n\n          The actions are taken at turns: 16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 -> 9 actions.\n\n          But we want minimal H.\n\n          Alternatively, at (19,4): we go down to (20,3) and then go up? \n\n          Then:\n\n            t16: U\n            t17: U\n            t18: D\n            t19: D -> (20,3)\n            t20: U (21,4)\n            t21: U (22,5)\n            t22: U (23,6)\n            t23: U (24,7)\n            t24: U (25,8)\n            t25: U (26,9) -> 10 actions.\n\n          Not better.\n\n          How about we wait at (18,5) for one turn? \n\n            (18,5): S -> (19,5) -> freeway5 at turn19: safe? (turn19: freeway5 safe) -> yes.\n\n          Then at (19,5): \n            We cannot stay or go up at turn20: because freeway5 and 6 and 7 are unsafe at turn20. So we must go down to (20,4) -> safe.\n\n          Then the path:\n\n            t16: U\n            t17: U\n            t18: S  -> (19,5)\n            t19: D  -> (20,4)\n            t20: U -> (21,5)\n            t21: U -> (22,6)\n            t22: U -> (23,7)\n            t23: U -> (24,8)\n            t24: U -> (25,9) -> 9 actions.\n\n          Same as before.\n\n          But wait: is there a way to be at (20,8)? \n\n          How? We would have to be at (19,7) or (19,8) at turn19. \n\n          To be at (19,7): we would have to be at (18,6) or (18,7) at turn18.\n\n          To be at (18,6): we would have to be at (17,5) or (17,6) at turn17.\n\n          But at turn17: we can only be at y=3 or 4.\n\n          So we cannot be at y=5 or above at turn17.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot be at y=6,7,8 at turn18.\n\n          So we cannot be at (19,7) or (19,8).\n\n          Therefore, the only safe states at turn20 are y=0,1,2,3,4,8,9? But we cannot be at y=8 at turn20.\n\n          How about being at y=8 at turn20? \n\n          We would have to be at (19,7) or (19,8) or (19,9) at turn19? \n\n          (19,9): that's the goal! So if we can be at (19,9), then we are done.\n\n          How to be at (19,9)? \n\n          We start at (16,3): we need to go up 6 times in 3 actions? \n\n            turn16: U -> (17,4)\n            turn17: U -> (18,5)\n            turn18: U -> (19,6) -> then we need one more to get to 9? \n\n          But from (19,6) we can do U: but then at turn20 we are at (20,7) which is unsafe.\n\n          And we cannot jump from 6 to 9 in one move? \n\n          So we cannot be at y=9 at turn19.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal path we have is 9 actions? \n\n          But we had a candidate that used 8 actions? \n\n          Let me reexamine the candidate that used 8 actions:\n\n            (16,3): U -> (17,4)\n            (17,4): U -> (18,5)\n            (18,5): U -> (19,6)\n            (19,6): then we must move to (20,?) -> but freeways 5,6,7 are unsafe at turn20. We cannot be at y=5,6,7 at turn20.\n\n          How about we move up from (19,6) to (20,7) -> unsafe, so we die.\n\n          Or move down to (20,5) -> unsafe.\n\n          Or stay at (20,6) -> unsafe.\n\n          So that state (19,6) is a dead end.\n\n          Therefore, we must avoid (19,6) at turn19.\n\n          So the earliest we can be at y=9 is turn25 (with 9 actions) as above.\n\n          But wait, is there a way to be at y=9 earlier than turn25? \n\n          How about we try to be at y=8 at turn24 and then to y=9 at turn25? \n\n          But to be at y=8 at turn24, we need to be at y=7 at turn23, and so on.\n\n          We are blocked at turn20 for freeways 5,6,7. So we must be at y=0,1,2,3,4 at turn20.\n\n          The fastest from there:\n\n            turn20: at y=4 (for example)\n            turn21: y=5\n            turn22: y=6\n            turn23: y=7\n            turn24: y=8\n            turn25: y=9 -> that's 5 moves from turn20 to turn25.\n\n          So total actions: from turn16 to turn24 (inclusive) is 9 actions? \n\n          But we start at turn16 and take actions at turn16,17,...,24 -> 9 actions, then at turn25 we are at 9.\n\n          Can we do it in 8 actions? That would mean we are at turn16+8=24 at y=9? \n\n          But then we would have to be at y=9 at turn24. That means we must be at y=8 at turn23, and then do U at turn23 to get to (24,9).\n\n          How to be at y=8 at turn23? \n\n            turn23: we are at y=8.\n\n          How many actions from (16,3) to (23,8)? \n\n            The net movement: 8-3=5 up. But we might have taken some downs or stays? \n\n            The minimal number of actions to go from 3 to 8 is 5. And we have 7 actions (from turn16 to turn22) to get to (23,8) -> but 23-16=7 actions available.\n\n          So we need to go up 5 times and down or stay 2 times? \n\n          But we must avoid unsafe turns.\n\n          The unsafe turns we know: \n            turn17: freeways 1,2,5,6,7 unsafe.\n            turn18: freeways 1,2 unsafe.\n            turn20: freeways 5,6,7 unsafe.\n\n          We start at (16,3): safe.\n\n          We need to be at (23,8). \n\n          Let me try to go up as much as possible:\n\n            turn16: U -> (17,4) -> unsafe? freeway4 at turn17: safe? -> yes, freeway4 is safe at turn17? \n                but freeway4 is not in the unsafe list at turn17? unsafe at turn17: only freeways 1,2,5,6,7 -> freeway4 is safe.\n\n            turn17: U -> (18,5) -> freeway5 at turn18: safe? (turn18: freeway5 is safe) -> safe.\n            turn18: U -> (19,6) -> freeway6 at turn19: safe -> safe.\n            turn19: U -> (20,7) -> freeway7 at turn20: unsafe! -> skip.\n\n          So we cannot do that.\n\n          How about:\n\n            turn16: U -> (17,4) -> safe.\n            turn17: S -> (18,4) -> safe.\n            turn18: U -> (19,5) -> safe.\n            turn19: U -> (20,6) -> unsafe.\n\n          Or:\n\n            turn16: U -> (17,4)\n            turn17: U -> (18,5)\n            turn18: S -> (19,5) -> safe.\n            turn19: U -> (20,6) -> unsafe.\n\n          Or at turn19: we go down to (20,4) -> safe.\n\n          Then:\n\n            turn20: at (20,4) -> safe.\n            turn20: U -> (21,5) -> safe.\n            turn21: U -> (22,6) -> safe.\n            turn22: U -> (23,7) -> safe.\n            turn23: U -> (24,8) -> then at turn24 we are at 8.\n            turn24: U -> (25,9) -> then we need 9 actions.\n\n          So we have to use 9 actions.\n\n          But note: we could try to be at y=0 or 9 earlier? \n\n          For example, if we can be at y=9 at turn22, that would be 6 actions: \n            turn16: U (17,4)\n            turn17: U (18,5)\n            turn18: U (19,6)\n            turn19: U (20,7) -> unsafe.\n\n          Cannot.\n\n          Or:\n\n            turn16: U (17,4)\n            turn17: U (18,5)\n            turn18: U (19,6)\n            turn19: D (20,5) -> unsafe.\n\n          Cannot.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\n          But let me see if there is a path with 8 actions that ends at turn24 at y=9? \n\n          We would be at (24,9) which requires we were at (23,8) and then did U at turn23.\n\n          How to be at (23,8)? \n\n          We must have taken 7 actions to get to (23,8) from (16,3).\n\n          The net movement: 8-3=5 up. So we must have at least 5 U actions. The other 2 actions could be D or S.\n\n          But any down move would require extra up moves.\n\n          Actually, the total displacement is 5 up. So the number of U minus number of D must be 5.\n\n          Let u = number of U, d = number of D, s = number of S.\n\n          Then u - d = 5, and u + d + s = 7.\n\n          Add: 2u + s = 12 -> so u <=6, d = u-5, and s=12-2u.\n\n          u must be at least 5.\n\n          Possibilities:\n            u=5: then d=0, s=2.\n            u=6: then d=1, s=0.\n\n          Let me try u=5, d=0, s=2.\n\n          We need to go from 3 to 8 in 7 actions: 5U and 2S.\n\n          We need to avoid unsafe states.\n\n          The unsafe states are at specific turns.\n\n          We start at (16,3).\n\n          We have to be at freeway5,6,7 only when they are safe.\n\n          The unsafe turns: \n            freeway5,6,7: unsafe at turns 17 and 20.\n\n          So we must not be on freeway5,6,7 at turn17 or turn20.\n\n          Also, freeway1,2: unsafe at turns17,18.\n\n          But we are starting at 3 and going up, so we won't be on 1 or 2.\n\n          The path must avoid being on freeway5,6,7 at turn17 and turn20.\n\n          Turn17: we are at the beginning of turn17, and we have taken one action (at turn16).\n\n          We start at (16,3): then after one action (turn16), we are at (17,y1).\n\n          We cannot be at freeway5,6,7 at turn17: so y1 cannot be 5,6,7.\n\n          Similarly, at turn20: after 4 actions, we are at (20,y4) and we cannot be at freeway5,6,7.\n\n          Also, at turn18: freeway1,2 are unsafe, but we are above 3, so safe.\n\n          At turn19: safe for all.\n\n          At turn21+: safe for all.\n\n          So constraints:\n\n            After action1 (turn16): we are at (17,y1): y1 in {3,4} (because we can only go to 2,3,4 from 3, but 2 is freeway2 which is unsafe at turn17, so only 3 or 4).\n\n            After action4 (turn19): we are at (20,y4): y4 must be in {0,1,2,3,4,8,9} but since we are going up and we are at least 3, and we haven't reached 8,9 yet, probably 3 or 4.\n\n          Now, we want to reach 8 at turn23? \n\n          The actions: 5U, 2S.\n\n          The sequence of y:\n\n            t16: 3\n            t17: either 3 or 4.\n            t18: \n            ...\n            t23: 8.\n\n          The displacement: from t16 to t23: 7 actions -> 7 moves.\n\n          The net displacement: +5.\n\n          Let me try to place the two S's and ensure we avoid the unsafe turns.\n\n          We must be at y=3 or 4 at turn17.\n\n          We must be at y= not 5,6,7 at turn20.\n\n          Example:\n\n            action0 (t16): U -> y17=4.\n            action1 (t17): U -> y18=5.\n            action2 (t18): U -> y19=6.\n            action3 (t19): we must avoid being at 7 at turn20? \n\n            But at turn19: we are at 6.

We have to do 9 actions.\n\n          Another path that might be 9 actions: \n\n            turn16: U (17,4)\n            turn17: U (18,5)\n            turn18: S (19,5)\n            turn19: D (20,4)\n            turn20: U (21,5)\n            turn21: U (22,6)\n            turn22: U (23,7)\n            turn23: U (24,8)\n            turn24: U (25,9) -> same.\n\n          Or we could do at turn19: from (19,5) we could go down to (20,4) or we could go down to (20,4) only.\n\n          So the sequence is not unique, but the number of actions is fixed at 9.\n\n          We output one.\n\n          Let me choose the one without extra down: \n\n            turn16: U\n            turn17: U\n            turn18: S   [wait at 5]\n            turn19: D   [then to 4 at turn20]\n            turn20: U\n            turn21: U\n            turn22: U\n            turn23: U\n            turn24: U\n\n          But then we only have 9 actions: and we reach at turn25.\n\n          This is the same length.\n\n          I'll output the first one I found: \n\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: D\n            Turn 19: S\n            Turn 20: U\n            Turn 21: U\n            Turn 22: U\n            Turn 23: U\n            Turn 24: U\n\n          But note: at turn19 we did S, which is not necessary. We could have done D again? \n\n          But let me see if we can do without the S at turn19? \n\n          From (18,5): \n            action at turn18: we did D to (19,4) \n            then at turn19: we are at (19,4) and we can do U immediately to (20,5) -> unsafe.\n\n          So we must not do U at turn19.\n\n          We can do S or D.\n\n          If we do D: then we go to (20,3) -> safe, but then we are lower and need more steps.\n\n          So the S at turn19 is to wait at 4 for the unsafe turn20 to pass.\n\n          Therefore, the above sequence is valid.\n\n          So the answer is 9 actions.\n\n          Format:\n\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: D\n            Turn 19: S\n            Turn 20: U\n            Turn 21: U\n            Turn 22: U\n            Turn 23: U\n            Turn 24: U\n\n          But wait, we have 9 actions, so the last action is at turn24.\n\n          And then at turn25 we are at 9.\n\n          The problem: we have to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n          Let me read: \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\n          Then after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\n          In this case, t1=16, H=9, so last action at turn 16+8=24, and then at turn25 we are at 9.\n\n          But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" -> turn16+9-1=24.\n\n          But in our simulation, we are at (0,9) at turn25, not turn24.\n\n          What's the issue? \n\n          The problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          and in the answer, we write the actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n          Then after these actions, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\n          But the problem also says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"?\n\n          Let me read carefully: not in the problem statement above. In the user's message, it says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" in the Task section? \n\n          Let me check the user's message:\n\n            \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          and then in the answer format, we write actions for turns t1, t1+1, ...\n\n          But note: the actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n          Then the position after the action at turn t1+H-1 is the position at turn t1+H.\n\n          We require that at turn t1+H, we are at 9.\n\n          So in our case, we want to be at 9 at turn16+H.\n\n          We are at turn25=16+9.\n\n          So H=9.\n\n          And the last action is at turn24.\n\n          But the user's message also says in the dynamics: \"avoid collisions with cars ...\". The collision is checked at the turn when the player is at a freeway. \n\n          In our simulation, we checked at each turn t (from 16 to 24) the state at the beginning of turn t.\n\n          The last state we check is at turn24: we are at (24,8) -> safe.\n\n          Then we take action U at turn24, and then at turn25 we are at (25,9) -> but turn25 is beyond our action sequence, and we don't check for collision at turn25 because we are at y=9 (safe).\n\n          So it's fine.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is the 9-action sequence.\n\n          However, let me see if we can finish in 9 actions but with a different path that might end sooner? \n\n          We cannot, because we must avoid turn20 for freeways 5,6,7.\n\n          So we output the sequence.\n\n          But note: we have to output the actions for turns 16 to 24.\n\n          One more: is there a path that uses 9 actions but gets to 9 at turn25, but perhaps has a different sequence that is valid and might be faster in some sense? \n\n          The minimal H is 9, so any sequence with 9 actions is minimal.\n\n          We choose one.\n\n          Let me choose the sequence where we wait at a lower floor during the unsafe turn20:\n\n            We can be at (20,0) or (20,1) or (20,2) or (20,3) or (20,4) and then go up.\n\n          The fastest would be to be as high as possible at turn20.\n\n          So being at (20,4) is best.\n\n          How to be at (20,4) with minimal actions? \n\n          We start at (16,3): we need net +1 in 4 actions.\n\n          We can do that with 1 up and 3 any actions (S or even down then up) but net +1.\n\n          And we must avoid unsafe turns.\n\n          We did: \n            U at turn16 -> (17,4)\n            U at turn17 -> (18,5)\n            then at turn18: we can do down to (19,4) [net +1 in 3 actions] \n            then at turn19: we do nothing: S -> (20,4)\n\n          Then from (20,4) we do 5 ups.\n\n          Total actions: 4 (to get to (20,4)) + 5 = 9.\n\n          So the sequence:\n\n            t16: U\n            t17: U\n            t18: D\n            t19: S\n            t20: U\n            t21: U\n            t22: U\n            t23: U\n            t24: U\n\n          This is the one we have.\n\n          Therefore, we output.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 16, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 9. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 16, move up to \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 17, move up to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 18, move down to \\(y = 4\\) to avoid being on freeway 5 at turn 20 (which is unsafe).\n- At turn 19, stay at \\(y = 4\\) to wait out the unsafe turn 20 for freeways 5, 6, and 7.\n- From turn 20 to turn 24, move up each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 25.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player avoids all unsafe freeways at critical turns:\n- Turn 17: Freeways 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 are unsafe, but the player is on freeway 4 (safe).\n- Turn 18: Freeways 1 and 2 are unsafe, but the player is on freeway 5 (safe).\n- Turn 19: All freeways are safe.\n- Turn 20: Freeways 5, 6, 7 are unsafe, but the player is on freeway 4 (safe).\n- Turns 21 to 24: All freeways are safe.\n\nThe actions are:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 16:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18:  D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19:  S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 22:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 23:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 24:  U \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=18, and I'm at y=5.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with a constant speed, and their positions are updated based on the time elapsed. Since we're starting at turn t1=18, for any future turn T, the car's span is shifted by s*(T - t1) in the direction of movement.\n\nCollision happens only if at the turn T when I'm on a freeway row y, and for that row, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn, so I only care about the row I'm currently on for collision.\n\nThe goal is to minimize H, the number of turns, so I should aim to move up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway row:\n\n- Row 1: two cars, both right-moving, speed 6. Head and tail: (6,-5) and (54,43). Since they're right-moving, the span is [tail, head], so for (6,-5), tail is -5, head is 6? The notation says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for row 1: (h=6, τ=-5, d=right, s=6) and (h=54, τ=43, d=right, s=6).\n\nFor right-moving, at time t, span is [τ, h], and it moves right, so at time T, span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly others, but in this case, all are right-moving? Let me check.\n\nRow 1: both right, s=6\n\nRow 2: same as row 1? It says: (6,-5,right,6), (54,43,right,6) — same as row 1.\n\nRow 3: (0,-47,right,48)\n\nRow 4: (0,-47,right,48) — same as row 3.\n\nRow 5: (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nRow 6: same as row 5? (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nRow 7: same again? (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nRow 8: (0,-47,right,48) — same as row 3 and 4.\n\nSo rows 1 and 2 are identical, rows 3,4,8 are identical, rows 5,6,7 are identical.\n\nNow, I start at y=5 at turn t=18.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is the top row, I think y=0 to 9, so y=9 is the goal, and no cars on y=9 since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=9 has no freeway, so I don't have to worry about cars there. Collision only on y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, since I need to go up, from y=5 to y=9, I need to move up 4 units. Each U action moves me up by 1, so minimum H would be 4 if I can go straight up without any issues. But I have to go through rows 6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\ny=5 to y=6, then 7,8,9.\n\nBut on each of these rows, there might be cars at position x=0 at the time I'm on that row.\n\nPosition is (0,y), so x=0 is fixed, I only move in y-direction.\n\nSo collision occurs when I'm on row y at turn T, and for that row, at turn T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span.\n\nSo I need to ensure that for each row y that I visit, at the time I'm on it, no car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nSince I start at y=5 at t=18, I need to check for row 5 at t=18 first.\n\nI'm at y=5 at t=18, so I need to check if there is collision on row 5 at t=18.\n\nFor row 5, there are three cars:\n\n1. (h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=12)\n\n2. (h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=12) — τ=-35, h=-24? That might be left, but direction is right.\n\n3. (h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at time t is [τ, h], since for right, Span(t1) = [τ, h], and moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] at T=t1+ΔT.\n\nLet t1=18.\n\nFor car 1 on row 5: τ=49, h=60, s=12, right\n\nAt time t, span = [49 + 12*(t-18), 60 + 12*(t-18)]\n\nSimilarly, car 2: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12, right, span at t: [-35 + 12*(t-18), -24 + 12*(t-18)]\n\nCar 3: τ=1, h=12, s=12, right, span at t: [1 + 12*(t-18), 12 + 12*(t-18)]\n\nNow at t=18, for row 5:\n\nCar 1: [49 +0, 60+0] = [49,60], 0 not in [49,60]\n\nCar 2: [-35 +0, -24+0] = [-35,-24], 0 not in this\n\nCar 3: [1 +0, 12+0] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo at t=18, on row 5, no collision, good.\n\nNow I need to go to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut when I move, at each turn, I choose action U, D, or S, which changes y for next turn.\n\nThe position update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy depends on action at t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), and I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on row y_t, so I need no collision on row y_t at time t.\n\nWhen I choose a_t, it affects y_{t+1}, but the collision at time t is based on y_t.\n\nSimilarly, at time t+1, I am on y_{t+1}, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9, since I start at y=5, I need to increase y by 4, so with U actions, I can do it in 4 turns, but I might need to wait or something if there is a car blocking.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nBut rows 6,7,8 have cars.\n\nFirst, let's consider the cars on the rows I need to pass through.\n\nI am at y=5 at t=18. I can choose to go up to y=6 at t=19, or stay, or down, but down is not helpful, so probably up or stay.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nMinimum turns: if I go U every turn, I reach y=9 at t=22, since t=18: y=5, t=19: y=6, t=20: y=7, t=21: y=8, t=22: y=9.\n\nSo at t=22, I am at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nBut I need to check for each of these turns, when I am on y=6,7,8, that there is no collision.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At t=19, I am on y=6\n\n- At t=20, on y=7\n\n- At t=21, on y=8\n\n- At t=22, on y=9, safe.\n\nNow, for each, check if 0 is in any car span on that row at that time.\n\nFirst, row 6 at t=19.\n\nRow 6 has the same cars as row 5, since rows 5,6,7 are identical.\n\nRow 6: cars (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nAt t=19, which is T = t1 +1 = 18 +1 =19, so ΔT=1.\n\nCar 1: span [49 + 12*1, 60 + 12*1] = [49+12, 60+12] = [61,72], 0 not in\n\nCar 2: [-35 +12*1, -24 +12*1] = [-23, -12], 0 not in\n\nCar 3: [1 +12*1, 12+12] = [13,24], 0 not in\n\nAll good, no collision at t=19 on row 6.\n\nNow row 7 at t=20.\n\nRow 7 same cars, T=20, ΔT=2\n\nCar 1: [49 +12*2, 60+24] = [49+24,60+24] = [73,84]\n\nCar 2: [-35 +24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]? [-35 + 12*2 = -35 + 24 = -11, -24 + 24 = 0], so span [-11, 0]\n\nNow, is 0 in [-11,0]? Yes, 0 is included, since it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nThe span includes both ends, so 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nThus, at t=20, on row 7, car 2 has span [-11,0], which includes 0, so collision if I'm on row 7 at t=20.\n\nBut I would be on row 7 at t=20 if I go straight up.\n\nt=20 is when I arrive at y=7? Let's clarify the timeline.\n\nAt t=18: I am at y=5, choose action a_{18}\n\nThen y_{19} = y_{18} + Δy_{18}\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter action, I move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nAt turn t, I am on row y_t, and I check collision based on that.\n\nFor row 7 at t=20: if I am on y=7 at turn 20, I need to check cars on row 7 at t=20.\n\nAs above, car 2 has span [-11,0] at t=20, which includes 0, so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on row 7 at turn t=20, because I would collide with that car.\n\nSo going straight up to y=7 at t=20 is not possible.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at t=21 might be ok or not, but since I can't reach y=7 safely at t=20, I need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps I can stay on some row to avoid the collision time.\n\nFor example, on row 6, at t=19 it was safe, so I could stay on row 6 for one turn to avoid being on row 7 at t=20.\n\nThen go up later.\n\nBut that would take more turns.\n\nI need to check other rows as well.\n\nFirst, let's list the critical times for each row where collision might happen.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, the span moves right with time.\n\nFor a given row, the time when a car covers x=0.\n\nFor row 5,6,7 (identical cars):\n\nCars:\n\n- Car 1: τ=49, h=60, s=12, right. Span at t: [49 + 12*(t-18), 60 + 12*(t-18)]\n\n0 is in span when 49 + 12*(t-18) <= 0 <= 60 + 12*(t-18)\n\nBut since 49 to 60 are both positive and increasing, 0 will never be in this span because min is 49 at t=18, increasing. So car 1 never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, car 2: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12, span: [-35 + 12*(t-18), -24 + 12*(t-18)]\n\n0 in span when -35 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +12ΔT, where ΔT = t-18\n\nSo -35 +12ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -24 +12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= 35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT <= 2 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 +12ΔT => 24 <= 12ΔT => ΔT >= 24/12 = 2\n\nSo ΔT >= 2 and ΔT <= 2.916, so ΔT=2\n\nThus at ΔT=2, t=20, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nCar 3: τ=1, h=12, s=12, span: [1 +12ΔT, 12+12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 1+12ΔT <= 0 <= 12+12ΔT\n\nBut 1+12ΔT >=1 >0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 is never <= something positive, so 0 not in span ever.\n\nThus for rows 5,6,7, the only dangerous time is at t=20 for car 2, where 0 is covered.\n\nAt t=20, on these rows, collision if on that row.\n\nSimilarly for row 6 at t=20: same as above.\n\nNow row 7 is same, so row 7 at t=20 has collision.\n\nNow row 8 is different.\n\nRow 8: (0,-47,right,48)\n\nSo one car: h=0, τ=-47, d=right, s=48\n\nRight-moving, span at t: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-47 + 48ΔT, 0 + 48ΔT] at t=18+ΔT\n\nh=0 at t=18, so at t=18, span [-47,0]\n\n0 is included? h=0, τ=-47, so [τ,h] = [-47,0], so x=0 is the head, so 0 is in the span.\n\nAt t=18, for row 8, at position (0,8), if I were there, collision.\n\nBut I'm not, I'm at y=5.\n\nNow, span at time t: [-47 + 48ΔT, 0 + 48ΔT] = [-47 + 48ΔT, 48ΔT]\n\n0 in span when -47 +48ΔT <= 0 <= 48ΔT\n\nSince 48ΔT >=0 for ΔT>=0, the second inequality 0 <= 48ΔT is always true for ΔT >=0.\n\nFirst inequality: -47 +48ΔT <= 0 => 48ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/48 <1, so ΔT=0 only.\n\nSince ΔT integer, at ΔT=0, t=18, span [-47,0], 0 in.\n\nFor ΔT=1, span [-47+48, 48] = [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT>1, span positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo for row 8, collision only at t=18, not at other times.\n\nBut at t=18, I'm at y=5, not on row 8.\n\nSo for row 8, safe except at t=18.\n\nNow similarly, rows 3,4,8 have the same car: (0,-47,right,48)\n\nFor row 3 at t=18: same, collision at t=18, but I'm not there.\n\nSafe other times.\n\nSimilarly row 4.\n\nNow rows 1 and 2: (6,-5,right,6) and (54,43,right,6)\n\nFirst car: τ=-5, h=6, s=6, span at t: [-5 +6ΔT, 6 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -5 +6ΔT <=0 <=6 +6ΔT\n\nSecond inequality always true since 6+6ΔT >=6>0.\n\nFirst: -5+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=5 => ΔT <=5/6 <1, so only ΔT=0, t=18, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=43, h=54, s=6, span [43+6ΔT,54+6ΔT], min 43>0, never covers 0.\n\nSo for rows 1 and 2, collision only at t=18, safe otherwise.\n\nNow back to my path.\n\nI need to go from y=5 to y=9, passing through y=6,7,8.\n\nI start at y=5, t=18, safe as we saw.\n\nIf I go up immediately:\n\nt=18: at y=5, choose U, so y_{19}=6\n\nt=19: at y=6, now need to check row 6 at t=19.\n\nAs before, at t=19, ΔT=1, row 6 cars:\n\nCar1: [61,72], no\n\nCar2: [-23,-12], no\n\nCar3: [13,24], no\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at t=19, I choose action. If I choose U, y_{20}=7\n\nThen at t=20, I am on y=7.\n\nBut row 7 at t=20 has car2 span [-11,0], 0 included, collision.\n\nNot safe.\n\nI could choose to stay at t=19, so y_{20} = y_{19} =6 (since S, Δy=0)\n\nThen at t=20, I am on y=6.\n\nNow row 6 at t=20: ΔT=2\n\nCar1: [49+24,60+24]=[73,84]\n\nCar2: [-35+24, -24+24]= [-11,0], 0 in, collision!\n\nAt t=20, row 6 also has collision because same as row 7.\n\nRows 5,6,7 all have the same cars, so at t=20, for all of them, car2 has span [-11,0], so on any of rows 5,6,7 at t=20, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=19, row 6 was safe, as above.\n\nAt t=19, ΔT=1, car2 span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=20, ΔT=2, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt t=21, ΔT=3, car2 span [-35+36, -24+36]= [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other cars no issue.\n\nSo for rows 5,6,7, dangerous at exactly t=20.\n\nSafe at other times, like t=19, t=21, etc.\n\nNow for row 8: only dangerous at t=18, which is past.\n\nSafe all other times.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, I need to be on y=6,7,8 at some point.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on rows 5,6,7 at t=20.\n\nSince rows 5,6,7 are all unsafe at t=20, I must not be on any of them at turn t=20.\n\nAt t=20, I should be either below y=5 or above y=7, but y=0 to 9, and I start from y=5, going up.\n\ny=4 and below are freeways y=1,2,3,4 which might have cars, but I don't need to go down, but I could.\n\nTo avoid t=20 on rows 5-7, I could be on y=8 or y=4 or something at t=20.\n\nBut y=4 is row 4, which has cars.\n\nFirst, let's see what is safe at t=20.\n\nAt t=20, ΔT=2 from t1=18.\n\nNow, row 1: cars (6,-5,right,6) and (54,43,right,6)\n\nAt t=20, ΔT=2\n\nFirst car: [-5 +6*2, 6+12] = [-5+12, 6+12] = [7,18], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: [43+12,54+12]=[55,66], no\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly row 2 same, safe.\n\nRow 3: car (0,-47,right,48), span [-47 +48*2, 0 +96] = [-47+96, 96] = [49,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 4 same, safe.\n\nRow 5: unsafe as above.\n\nRow 6: unsafe.\n\nRow 7: unsafe.\n\nRow 8: car (0,-47,right,48), span [-47 +48*2, 96] = [49,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo at t=20, rows 1,2,3,4,8 are safe; rows 5,6,7 are unsafe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\ny=0 is bottom, y=9 top.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nI am at y=5 at t=18.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions:\n\nOption 1: go up to y=6 at t=19.\n\nAt t=19, on y=6, safe as above.\n\nNow at t=19, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go up to y=7 at t=20, but at t=20, y=7 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I stay, y=6 at t=20, also unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I go down, to y=5 at t=20, but y=5 at t=20 is also unsafe.\n\nSo all choices lead to collision at t=20 if I am on y=6 at t=19.\n\nProblem.\n\nI need to not be on rows 5-7 at t=20.\n\nSo at t=20, I should be on y=8 or y=4 or something.\n\nBut at t=19, I am on y=6 if I went up from t=18.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=19, I can only go to y=5,6,7 at t=20.\n\nAll of which are unsafe at t=20.\n\ny=5,6,7 all rows 5-7 unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=6 at t=19 if I have to be at t=20 on a safe row, but from there I can only reach unsafe rows.\n\nPerhaps I should not go up immediately.\n\nAt t=18, instead of going up, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut going down might not help, and increases H.\n\nI could stay at y=5 for one turn.\n\nAt t=18: at y=5, I choose S, so y_{19} = y_{18} =5\n\nThen at t=19, I am on y=5.\n\nNow t=19, ΔT=1, row 5: cars\n\nCar1: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72]\n\nCar2: [-35+12, -24+12]= [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nCar3: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24], no\n\nSafe.\n\nThen at t=19, I choose action.\n\nIf I go up, to y=6 at t=20.\n\nBut at t=20, y=6 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I stay, y=5 at t=20, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, to y=4 at t=20.\n\ny=4 is row 4.\n\nRow 4 has car (0,-47,right,48)\n\nAt t=20, ΔT=2, span [-47+96, 96] = [49,96], 0 not in, safe as before.\n\nSo I can go down to y=4 at t=20.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps, so more turns.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to other rows.\n\nBut let's see the minimal H.\n\nSince the only dangerous time is t=20 for rows 5-7, I can avoid those rows at t=20.\n\nFor example, at t=20, be on y=8 or y=4, etc.\n\ny=8 is row 8, which is safe at t=20.\n\nBut how to get to y=8.\n\nFrom start, at t=18, y=5.\n\nIf I go up to y=6 at t=19.\n\nThen from y=6 at t=19, I can only go to y=5,6,7 at t=20, all unsafe.\n\nI can't reach y=8 from y=6 in one step; I can only move one row per turn.\n\nSimilarly, from y=5, if I go down to y=4 at t=19.\n\nAt t=18: choose D, so y_{19} = y_{18} -1 =4\n\nThen at t=19, I am on y=4.\n\ny=4 row, at t=19, ΔT=1.\n\nRow 4 car: (0,-47,right,48), span [-47 +48*1, 0 +48] = [-47+48, 48] = [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=19, I can choose action.\n\nNow, at t=20, I need to be on a safe row.\n\ny=4 at t=20: row 4 at t=20, as above, [49,96], safe.\n\nBut if I stay, I waste time.\n\nI could go up to y=5 at t=20, but y=5 unsafe at t=20.\n\nOr go down to y=3 at t=20.\n\ny=3 row 3, at t=20, ΔT=2, span [49,96], safe.\n\nBut going down seems counterproductive.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=19, I can go up to y=5 at t=20, but unsafe.\n\nOr stay, or down.\n\nTo avoid t=20 on rows 5-7, I should not be on them at t=20.\n\nSo from y=4 at t=19, I can go to y=4 (stay) or y=3 (down) or y=5 (up), but y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo I can choose to stay at y=4 or go down to y=3 at t=20.\n\nThen after t=20, the danger is past, I can go up freely.\n\nFor example, at t=19, on y=4, choose S, so y_{20} =4\n\nAt t=20, on y=4, safe as above.\n\nThen at t=20, I can start going up.\n\nt=20: at y=4, choose U, so y_{21} =5\n\nAt t=21, on y=5.\n\nt=21, ΔT=3, row 5 cars:\n\nCar1: [49+36,60+36]=[85,96]\n\nCar2: [-35+36, -24+36]= [1,12], 0 not in\n\nCar3: [1+36,12+36]=[37,48], no\n\nSafe.\n\nThen t=21: choose U, y_{22}=6\n\nt=22: on y=6, ΔT=4, row 6:\n\nCar1: [49+48,60+48]=[97,108]\n\nCar2: [-35+48, -24+48]= [13,24], no\n\nCar3: [1+48,12+48]=[49,60], no\n\nSafe.\n\nt=22: choose U, y_{23}=7\n\nt=23: on y=7, ΔT=5\n\nCar1: [49+60,60+60]=[109,120]\n\nCar2: [-35+60, -24+60]= [25,36], no\n\nCar3: [1+60,12+60]=[61,72], no\n\nSafe.\n\nt=23: choose U, y_{24}=8\n\nt=24: on y=8, row 8 car: at t=24, ΔT=6, span [-47 +48*6, 48*6] = [-47+288, 288] = [241,288], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=24: choose U, y_{25}=9\n\nt=25: on y=9, goal.\n\nBut H is from t=18 to t=25, that's 8 turns? Let's count.\n\nTurns: t=18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25\n\nFrom t=18 to t=25 is 8 actions? Let's see the sequence.\n\nStart at t=18, position y=5.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t=18 + H, we are at position.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, so H actions, to reach at turn t=t1+H.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, we have y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn the dynamics: after action a_t, at turn t+1, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, apply a_t, then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t1=18, y=5.\n\nWe apply actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, and we reach at turn t1+H.\n\nIn this case, t1=18, reach at turn 18+H.\n\nWith the sequence above:\n\nt=18: at y=5, apply a_{18} = D (down to y=4)\n\nThen t=19: at y=4, apply a_{19} = S (stay, y=4)\n\nt=20: at y=4, apply a_{20} = U (up to y=5)\n\nt=21: at y=5, apply a_{21} = U (to y=6)\n\nt=22: at y=6, apply a_{22} = U (to y=7)\n\nt=23: at y=7, apply a_{23} = U (to y=8)\n\nt=24: at y=8, apply a_{24} = U (to y=9)\n\nThen at t=25: at y=9.\n\nSo H=7 actions: from a_{18} to a_{24}, t=18 to 24, 7 actions, reach at t=25.\n\nBut t=18+H =25, so H=7.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince row 8 is safe except at t=18, and I can go directly to row 8 at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=20, row 8 is safe.\n\nBut I am at y=5 at t=18.\n\nIf I can be at y=8 at t=20, but from y=5 to y=8 in two steps: need to go up three times, but I can only move one per turn, so minimum three turns to go from 5 to 8.\n\nt=18 to t=20 is two turns, I can go to y=7 at t=20, but y=7 unsafe at t=20.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo to y=6 at t=19, then to y=7 at t=20, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible to reach y=8 by t=20 from y=5.\n\nt=18: y=5\n\nAfter one action: t=19, y=6 or 4 or 5\n\nAfter two actions: t=20, y=5,6,7 if from y=6; or from y=4, y=3,4,5; etc. Cannot reach y=8 by t=20.\n\nSo at t=20, I must be on y<=7 or y>=8, but y=8 is possible only if I was at y=7 or 8 or 9, but I start at y=5.\n\nSo at t=20, the highest I can be is y=7 if I go up twice, but unsafe.\n\nOr y=6 or 5, unsafe.\n\nOr lower, like y=4, which is safe.\n\ny=8 not reachable.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 not.\n\nSo at t=20, I must be on y<=4 or y>=8, but y>=8 not possible, so only y<=4.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4 are safe at t=20, as we saw earlier.\n\nRows 1,2,3,4 safe at t=20.\n\ny=0 also safe.\n\nSo I need to be on y<=4 at t=20.\n\nFor example, at t=19, I need to be on a row where I can go to y<=4 at t=20.\n\nAt t=18, I am at y=5.\n\nI can go down to y=4 at t=19.\n\nThen at t=19, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=20, I can be on y=4 (stay) or y=3 (down) or y=5 (up), but y=5 unsafe, so I must choose stay or down to be safe at t=20.\n\nSay, stay at y=4 at t=20.\n\nThen after t=20, go up.\n\nBut earlier I had a sequence with H=7.\n\nBut I can go up faster after t=20.\n\nSince the danger is only at t=20, after that, rows 5-7 are safe.\n\nFor example, at t=20, be on y=4.\n\nThen from there, go up directly.\n\nt=20: at y=4, choose U, to y=5 at t=21\n\nt=21: at y=5, safe as before (ΔT=3, car2 [1,12], no 0)\n\nThen U to y=6 at t=22\n\nt=22: at y=6, ΔT=4, car2 [13,24], safe\n\nU to y=7 at t=23\n\nt=23: at y=7, ΔT=5, car2 [25,36], safe\n\nU to y=8 at t=24\n\nt=24: at y=8, safe\n\nU to y=9 at t=25\n\nSame as before, H=7 actions to reach at t=25.\n\nBut from t=20 at y=4, I could go up faster? No, each step takes one turn.\n\nMinimum from y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps: to 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I start from y=5 at t=18, and I go down to y=4 at t=19, then at t=20 y=4, then up to y=5 at t=21, etc., to y=9 at t=25.\n\nBut if I don't go down, and stay at y=5 until after t=20.\n\nAt t=18: choose S, so y_{19}=5\n\nt=19: at y=5, safe (ΔT=1, as before)\n\nThen at t=19, I need to choose action for t=20.\n\nBut at t=20, y=5 unsafe, so I cannot go to y=5 at t=20, but I am at y=5 at t=19, so if I choose S, y_{20}=5, unsafe.\n\nIf I choose D, y_{20}=4, safe.\n\nIf U, y_{20}=6, unsafe.\n\nSo only choice is to go down to y=4 at t=20.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nt=19: choose D, so y_{20} = y_{19} -1 =4? y_{19}=5, a_{19}=D, so Δy = -1, y_{20} =5 + (-1) =4\n\nThen at t=20, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSo in both cases, I end up at y=4 at t=20.\n\nThen go up to y=5 at t=21, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=4 it takes 5 steps, but since I started from y=5 and went down, it's extra.\n\nIs there a way to be at a higher row after t=20?\n\nFor example, at t=20, be on y=3 or something, but that might be lower.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 8 directly after t=20.\n\nBut row 8 is safe, but I have to go through 5,6,7.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=20, rows 5-7 are unsafe, but at t=21, they are safe.\n\nSo if I can be on y=7 at t=21, for example.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at t=21, I need to be at y=6 or 7 or 8 at t=20, but at t=20, y=6 and 7 unsafe, y=8 not reachable.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at t=21 directly from safe position.\n\nLet's see possible paths.\n\nI need to be on some y at t=20 that is safe, i.e., y<=4 or y>=8, but y>=8 not possible, so y<=4.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nThe fastest way: start from y=5 at t=18.\n\nTo be at y<=4 at t=20.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Go down at t=18 to y=4 at t=19\n\nThen at t=19, on y=4, I can choose to stay or go down or up.\n\nIf I go up to y=5 at t=20, unsafe.\n\nSo I must stay or go down at t=19 to be safe at t=20.\n\nSay, stay at y=4 at t=19 and t=20.\n\nThen at t=20, go up to y=5 at t=21, etc.\n\nBut from t=18, if I go down to y=4 at t=19, then at t=19 I stay, y=4 at t=20, then go up.\n\nBut at t=19, I could go down to y=3 at t=20, but that is lower, worse.\n\nSo best is to be at y=4 at t=20.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=20, go U to y=5 at t=21, U to y=6 at t=22, U to y=7 at t=23, U to y=8 at t=24, U to y=9 at t=25.\n\nReach at t=25 with 7 actions.\n\nBut the actions are from t=18 to t=24.\n\na_{18} to a_{24}, 7 actions.\n\nBut I can save one turn by not staying at y=4.\n\nAt t=18, I go down to y=4 at t=19.\n\nThen at t=19, on y=4, instead of staying, I can go down to y=3 at t=20, but then I have to come back, worse.\n\nOr, at t=19, I go up, but to y=5 at t=20, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAnother thought: I could go up to y=6 at t=19, which is safe, then at t=19, I have to choose action for t=20.\n\nBut all choices lead to unsafe y at t=20.\n\nUnless I can move to a row that is safe at t=20, but from y=6, I can only go to 5,6,7, all unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be safe at t=20 if I am on y=6 at t=19.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=5 at t=19, same issue.\n\nSo the only way is to be on y<=4 at t=20.\n\nThe highest I can be at t=20 is y=4.\n\nFor example, by going down at t=18 to y=4 at t=19, then at t=19 stay at y=4 or go down, but staying is better.\n\nThen at t=20, go up.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=20, to y=9 at t=25, that's 5 steps up, but since I started at t=18, and I have actions from t=18.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\nTurn t=18: start at y=5, choose action a_{18}\n\nt=19: at y_{19} = y_5 + Δy\n\netc.\n\nTo be at y=4 at t=20.\n\nHow to get there.\n\nAt t=18, y=5.\n\nIf I choose D, then y_{19} =4\n\nAt t=19, y=4.\n\nThen at t=19, if I choose S, y_{20} =4\n\nThen at t=20, y=4.\n\nThen a_{20} = U, y_{21}=5\n\na_{21} = U, y_{22}=6\n\na_{22} = U, y_{23}=7\n\na_{23} = U, y_{24}=8\n\na_{24} = U, y_{25}=9\n\nActions: a_{18}=D, a_{19}=S, a_{20}=U, a_{21}=U, a_{22}=U, a_{23}=U, a_{24}=U\n\n7 actions, reach at t=25.\n\nAt t=18, I could choose S, so y_{19}=5\n\nThen at t=19, choose D, y_{20}=4\n\nThen at t=20, y=4, then same as above: a_{20}=U to y=5 at t=21, etc., to a_{24}=U to y=9 at t=25.\n\nSame thing, H=7.\n\nBut in this case, at t=19 I am at y=5, which is safe, then go down to y=4 at t=20.\n\nThen up.\n\nStill 7 actions.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nSuppose I go down at t=18 to y=4 at t=19.\n\nThen at t=19, instead of staying, I go down to y=3 at t=20.\n\nThen at t=20, on y=3, safe.\n\nBut then I have to go up from y=3 to y=9, which takes 6 steps, even worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps after t=20, I can move faster, but no, each step takes a turn.\n\nAnother idea: since row 8 is safe and I can reach it directly.\n\nFor example, after t=20, go to row 8 quickly.\n\nBut I have to go through 5,6,7.\n\nAt t=21, I can be on y=5 if I was at y=4 at t=20 and go up.\n\nBut y=5 at t=21 is safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at t=22, safe.\n\ny=7 at t=23, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=24, safe.\n\ny=9 at t=25.\n\nSame as before.\n\nCan I skip some rows? No, I have to move one at a time.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 8 from row 7, but row 7 I have to visit.\n\nUnless I go directly, but no.\n\nMaybe I can be on row 8 at an earlier time.\n\nFor example, at t=19, row 8 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nAt t=19, ΔT=1, row 8 span [1,48], no 0.\n\nBut how to get to row 8 at t=19 from y=5 at t=18.\n\nImpossible, because from y=5, I can only go to y=4,5,6 at t=19.\n\nCannot reach y=8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=21, row 8 is safe, but I need to be there.\n\nBut I have to go through lower rows first.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7 with the sequence above.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can do with H=6.\n\nSuppose H=6, then I reach at t=24.\n\nSo from t=18 to t=24, 6 actions.\n\nStart y=5 at t=18.\n\nAfter 6 actions, at t=24, y=9.\n\nSo I need to increase y by 4 in 6 actions, which means I can have some S or D actions, but since I need net +4, with 6 actions, I can have two extra actions that are not U, like S or D, but D would require more U later, so probably not efficient.\n\nNet change: each U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nStart y=5, end y=9, so net +4.\n\nIn H actions, the sum of Δy must be +4.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,+1.\n\nSo minimum H=4 if all U, but not possible due to cars.\n\nWith H=6, net +4, so the actions must include 4 U and 2 other actions that sum to 0, like two S, or one S and one D, or two D but then more U, etc.\n\nFor example, 4U and 2S, or 5U and 1D, etc.\n\nBut 5U and 1D would be net +4 only if the D is compensated, 5U +1D = +5 -1 = +4, yes.\n\nSimilarly, 4U +2S = +4.\n\nOr 6U -2, but net +4 requires +4, so if 6U, net +6, too much, so must have some non-U.\n\nNow, in terms of position at each turn.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at t=24.\n\nThe path must avoid collision at each turn when on y=1 to 8.\n\nSpecifically, avoid being on y=5,6,7 at t=20.\n\nAt t=20, I must not be on y=5,6,7.\n\nt=20 is one of the turns between t=18 and t=24.\n\nt=18,19,20,21,22,23 for actions, positions at t=18 to t=24.\n\nAt t=18: y=5, must be safe, which it is.\n\nAt t=19: whatever y I am, must be safe.\n\nAt t=20: must be on safe y, not 5,6,7.\n\nAt t=21,22,23: on y to 9, must be safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at t=24, with net +4 in 6 actions.\n\nSuppose at t=20, I am on y=4, for example.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=9 at t=24, I need to go from y=4 to y=9 in 4 steps, but t=20 to t=24 is 4 turns: t=21,22,23,24 positions.\n\nAt t=20, position y.\n\nAfter actions at t=20,21,22,23, I reach position at t=24.\n\nSo from t=20 to t=24, 4 actions, to go from y_t20 to y_t24=9.\n\nIf at t=20 I am at y=4, then I need to increase by 5 in 4 actions, which requires at least 5 U, but only 4 actions, impossible.\n\ny=4 to y=9 is +5, so I need 5 U actions in the remaining turns.\n\nBut from t=20 to t=24, I have actions at t=20,21,22,23, which affect positions at t=21,22,23,24.\n\nAfter 4 actions, I am at t=24.\n\nIf start at t=20 with y=4, after 4 actions, I can reach at most y=4+4=8 with all U, or y=9 with net +5, but +5 requires 5 U, only 4 actions, so maximum y=8 at t=24 if all U from y=4.\n\nBut I need y=9, so I cannot reach y=9 from y=4 in 4 actions; I need 5 actions to gain 5.\n\nTherefore, if at t=20 I am at y=4, I cannot reach y=9 by t=24 with only 4 actions; I need to be at least y=5 at t=20 to reach y=9 by t=24.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9 at t=24, at t=20 I must be at y=5 or higher, because from y=5, I can reach y=9 in 4 actions with all U: to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, from y=6, in 3 actions to y=9, but I have 4 actions from t=20 to t=23, to reach t=24.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nTo have y_{24} =9.\n\nWith actions from t=20 to t=23 (4 actions), y_{24} = y_{20} + sum_{k=20}^{23} Δy_k\n\nSo y_{24} = y_{20} + sum of 4 Δy.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y_{24} <= y_{20} + 4\n\ny_{24} =9, so y_{20} + sum >=9, but y_{20} <=9, etc.\n\ny_{24} = y_{20} + S, where S is sum of 4 Δy, S <=4, S>=-4.\n\nBut y_{24}=9, so y_{20} + S =9.\n\nSince S <=4, y_{20} >=5.\n\nSimilarly, S >= -4, but 9 <= y_{20} +4, so y_{20} >=5.\n\nAlso, since S >= -4, y_{20} <=13, but y max 9, so y_{20} <=9.\n\nSo for y_{24}=9, we need y_{20} >=5 and y_{20} + S =9 with |S| <=4, but S integer, so possible S from -4 to 4.\n\nBut y_{20} >=5, y_{24}=9, so S=9 - y_{20} <=4, so y_{20} >=5.\n\nIf y_{20}=5, S=4, need all 4 actions U, so y_{21}=6, y_{22}=7, y_{23}=8, y_{24}=9.\n\nIf y_{20}=6, S=3, etc.\n\nBut in our case, at t=20, y=5 is unsafe, so I cannot be at y=5 at t=20.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 and y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo for H=6, I need to be at y=9 at t=24, which requires y_{20} >=5.\n\nBut y_{20} must be 5,6,7 or 8,9 to be >=5.\n\nBut y=5,6,7 unsafe at t=20, so not possible.\n\ny=8 or y=9 at t=20.\n\nBut y=9 at t=20 is the goal, but I need to reach at t=24, not earlier.\n\nAt t=20, if I am at y=9, I have reached, but for H=6, I reach at t=24, so at t=20 I am not at goal.\n\ny=8 at t=20.\n\nBut can I be at y=8 at t=20?\n\nFrom start, t=18 y=5.\n\nTo reach y=8 at t=20.\n\nIn two actions: from t=18 to t=19, one action to y=6 or 4 or 5.\n\nThen to t=20, from there, maximum y=7 if from y=6 and U, but y=7 unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=8.\n\ny=9 not possible.\n\nSo at t=20, I cannot be at y=8 or 9.\n\nTherefore, for H=6, to have y_{24}=9, I need y_{20} >=5, but the only possibilities y=5,6,7,8,9 are all either unsafe or unreachable at t=20.\n\ny=5,6,7 unsafe, y=8,9 unreachable from y=5 in two steps.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have H=6.\n\nThus minimal H is 7.\n\nWith H=7, I reach at t=25.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to specify the actions.\n\nI have a sequence: for example, a_{18} = D (to y=4 at t=19)\n\na_{19} = S (stay y=4 at t=20)\n\na_{20} = U (to y=5 at t=21)\n\na_{21} = U (to y=6 at t=22)\n\na_{22} = U (to y=7 at t=23)\n\na_{23} = U (to y=8 at t=24)\n\na_{24} = U (to y=9 at t=25)\n\nIn this, at t=19, I am on y=4, which is safe.\n\nAt t=20, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen up.\n\nBut in the action sequence, a_{19}=S, which is fine.\n\nI could do a_{18}=S, then a_{19}=D, to y=4 at t=20.\n\nThen a_{20}=U to y=5 at t=21, etc., same thing.\n\nBut with a_{18}=S, then at t=19 I am at y=5, which is safe, then a_{19}=D to y=4 at t=20.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nIn this case, I use a down action, but H is same.\n\nNow, in the sequence above with a_{18}=D and a_{19}=S, I have two actions before going up, but net I go down once and stay once, so I have to make up for it.\n\nBut since minimal H is 7, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid going down.\n\nAnother sequence: at t=18, I go up to y=6 at t=19.\n\nAt t=19, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen, since I cannot stay or move to 5 or 7 at t=20, all unsafe, but I have to do something.\n\nUnless I move to a different row, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps at t=19, I go down to y=5 at t=20, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think going down is necessary to avoid t=20.\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 1 or something, but that would be worse.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, when I go to y=8, I need to check if safe, which it is after t=18.\n\nSimilarly, all should be safe.\n\nNow, in the action sequence, for H=7, actions from t=18 to t=24.\n\nIn the first sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1} = D (since t1=18)\n\nTurn t1 +1: a_{19} = S\n\nTurn t1 +2: a_{20} = U\n\nTurn t1 +3: a_{21} = U\n\nTurn t1 +4: a_{22} = U\n\nTurn t1 +5: a_{23} = U\n\nTurn t1 +6: a_{24} = U\n\nAnd reach at t=25.\n\nt1=18, actions from t=18 to t=24, that's 7 actions.\n\nIn the format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + (H-1): a_{t1+H-1}\n\nWith H=7, so from t=18 to t=18+6=24.\n\nNow, I could have a sequence with no down, but I have to avoid the row.\n\nSince row 8 is safe, and I can go to it later.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nAnother sequence: at t=18, stay, a_{18}=S, so y_{19}=5\n\nThen a_{19}=D, y_{20}=4\n\nThen a_{20}=U, y_{21}=5\n\na_{21}=U, y_{22}=6\n\na_{22}=U, y_{23}=7\n\na_{23}=U, y_{24}=8\n\na_{24}=U, y_{25}=9\n\nSame H=7.\n\nIn this case, at t=19, I am at y=5, which is safe, as we checked.\n\nThen I go down to y=4 at t=20, safe.\n\nThen up.\n\nPerhaps this has less down time, but same number of actions.\n\nIn the first sequence, I went down immediately and stayed, here I stayed then down.\n\nBut both have one down and one stay extra.\n\nIn terms of actions, both have 4U, one D, one S, and one more U? Let's see:\n\nFirst sequence: a18=D (down), a19=S (stay), a20=U, a21=U, a22=U, a23=U, a24=U → so actions: D,S,U,U,U,U,U → net: -1 +0 +1+1+1+1+1 = +4, yes.\n\nSecond sequence: a18=S (stay), a19=D (down), a20=U, a21=U, a22=U, a23=U, a24=U → S,D,U,U,U,U,U → net 0 -1 +1+1+1+1+1 = +4.\n\nSame.\n\nNow, for the output, I think either is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision for all steps.\n\nFirst sequence:\n\nt=18: at y=5, safe (as before)\n\nAfter a18=D, to y=4 at t=19\n\nt=19: at y=4, row 4 at t=19, ΔT=1, span [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAfter a19=S, y=4 at t=20\n\nt=20: at y=4, row 4 at t=20, ΔT=2, span [49,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAfter a20=U, to y=5 at t=21\n\nt=21: at y=5, row 5 at t=21, ΔT=3, car2 [1,12], no 0, safe.\n\nAfter a21=U, to y=6 at t=22\n\nt=22: at y=6, row 6 at t=22, ΔT=4, car2 [13,24], no 0, safe.\n\nAfter a22=U, to y=7 at t=23\n\nt=23: at y=7, row 7 at t=23, ΔT=5, car2 [25,36], no 0, safe.\n\nAfter a23=U, to y=8 at t=24\n\nt=24: at y=8, row 8 at t=24, ΔT=6, span [241,288], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAfter a24=U, to y=9 at t=25, goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSimilarly for the other sequence.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the second sequence, at t=19 I was on y=5, which is row 5, and I had action D, but at t=19, row 5 is safe, no issue.\n\nThen at t=20 on y=4, safe.\n\nSame.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I have an extra stay, but same H.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly without stay.\n\nFor example, at t=18, go down to y=4 at t=19.\n\nThen at t=19, instead of staying, can I go up? But to y=5 at t=20, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo down to y=3 at t=20, but then from y=3 to y=9 takes more turns.\n\nFor example, a18=D to y=4 at t=19\n\na19=D to y=3 at t=20\n\nThen a20=U to y=4 at t=21\n\na21=U to y=5 at t=22\n\netc., to y=9 at t=26, worse, H=8.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo minimal is H=7.\n\nThus, one possible sequence:\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nIn the action, at turn t, I specify the action for that turn.\n\nIn the format: for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=7, t1=18, so turns 18 to 24.\n\nActions: a18=D, a19=S, a20=U, a21=U, a22=U, a23=U, a24=U\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to reach y=9 at t=25, which is after a24.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) with the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The analysis shows that moving directly upward is unsafe at turn \\(t = 20\\) due to collisions on rows \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\). Therefore, a detour is necessary to avoid these rows at \\(t = 20\\), requiring 7 turns to reach the goal safely.\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H = 7\\) and ensures no collisions:\n- At turn 18, move down to \\(y = 4\\) to avoid being on rows \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) at \\(t = 20\\).\n- At turn 19, stay at \\(y = 4\\) to remain safe at \\(t = 20\\).\n- From turn 20 onward, move upward consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 25.\n\nCollision checks confirm safety at each step:\n- Turn 18 (\\(y = 5\\)): Safe, as row 5 cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\).\n- Turn 19 (\\(y = 4\\)): Safe, as row 4 car span \\([1, 48]\\) excludes \\(x = 0\\).\n- Turn 20 (\\(y = 4\\)): Safe, as row 4 car span \\([49, 96]\\) excludes \\(x = 0\\).\n- Turn 21 (\\(y = 5\\)): Safe, as row 5 car 2 span \\([1, 12]\\) excludes \\(x = 0\\).\n- Turn 22 (\\(y = 6\\)): Safe, as row 6 car 2 span \\([13, 24]\\) excludes \\(x = 0\\).\n- Turn 23 (\\(y = 7\\)): Safe, as row 7 car 2 span \\([25, 36]\\) excludes \\(x = 0\\).\n- Turn 24 (\\(y = 8\\)): Safe, as row 8 car span \\([241, 288]\\) excludes \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 7\\), and the sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: D \\\\\nTurn 19: S \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 19 and the player is at (0,4). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe car update rules:\n- Left-moving: span moves left (decreasing x) at speed s per turn.\n- Right-moving: span moves right (increasing x) at speed s per turn.\n\nBut note: in the given car state, all cars are right-moving (direction is \"right\"). So for a car at turn t1 (19) with head h, tail tau, at a future turn T, the car's span will be [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and the player's x-coordinate (which is always 0) is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: The player's position at turn T is (0, y_T). The movement is: at turn T, we choose an action that determines y_{T+1}. However, during the entire turn T, the player is at y_T. So when we are at turn T, we are on freeway y_T and we must check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNote: when we move from y_T to y_{T+1} at the end of turn T, we are not on y_{T+1} during turn T. So we only check the freeway we are currently on (y_T) at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 19 at y=4. We want to get to y=9.\n\nThe actions: U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), S (stay: y unchanged).\n\nConstraints: y must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (starting at turn 19) until we first reach y=9. We are at (0,9) at the turn when we first have y=9.\n\nLet me denote the state at turn t (starting from t=19) as (t, y). We start at (19,4). We need to reach some (T,9) for minimal T-19 (so minimal H = T-19+1? Note: we take actions at t=19,20,..., until the turn when we end at 9).\n\nActually, if we are at turn t and we are at y_t, then we take action a_t and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}. So if we start at turn 19 and take H actions (at turns 19,20,...,19+H-1), then we end at turn 19+H. We want y_{19+H} = 9.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t1+0, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then the position at turn t1+H would be the result. We require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? Actually, the action at t1+H-1 is taken and then at turn t1+H we have the new position. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? Let me read:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So the position at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is 9. That is, after taking H actions (from turn t1 to t1+H-1) we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: the state at turn t1 is given. Then we take action at t1 and move to t1+1 with new y. Then at turn t1+1 we take next action, etc.\n\nSo:\n- At turn t1 (19): we are at y=4. Then we take action a_{19} and move to y_20 = y_19 + delta.\n- We want that at turn t1 + H - 1 (which is 19 + H - 1) we are at y=9.\n\nExample: if H=1, then we take action at turn 19 and at turn 19 (which is t1+H-1 = 19+1-1=19) we must be at 9? But we start at 4 at turn 19. So we cannot be at 9 at the same turn. Therefore, we must have at least one action to change the position. Actually, the state at turn 19 is fixed. We take an action at turn 19 to go to turn 20. So the position at turn 19 is 4, and at turn 20 we are at 4+delta. We want to be at 9 at some turn T (>=19). The minimal T is 19? But we are at 4 at 19, so we are not at 9. Then we must have T>19.\n\nThe problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we must be at 9. So if we set T = t1+H-1, then we are at 9 at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 19 (t1) at y=4. We take H actions: at turns 19,20,...,19+H-1. Then at turn 19+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the last action is taken at turn 19+H-1, and then we are at 9 at that same turn? Actually, the action at turn t causes the position at turn t+1. But note the problem defines the update as:\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, the position at turn t is determined by the actions taken at turns 0 to t-1 (if we started at turn 0). But here we start at turn 19.\n\nSo at turn 19: we are at 4 (given). Then we take a_19: then at turn 20 we are at y_20 = 4 + delta_19.\n\nWe want that at turn T = 19 + H - 1, we are at 9. But note: at turn T, we have taken actions at turns 19,20,...,T-1. And the position at turn T is the result of the last action at turn T-1.\n\nSo if we want to be at 9 at turn T, then T must be at least 19 (but we are at 4 at 19, so T>19). The smallest T we can be at 9 is 19 + (9-4) = 24? But we can go down? But going down would make it take more steps. We want minimal H (number of actions) so we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid cars. We are only at risk when we are on freeways 1 to 8 (y=1..8). The start is at y=4 (freeway 4? no: the grid has y=0,1,...,9. The freeways are y=1,2,...,8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars). So we start at y=4 (which is freeway 4) and we must avoid collisions on freeways 1..8.\n\nThe goal is y=9 (safe).\n\nWe can plan a path: we can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We need to check for each turn and each freeway we are on (if between 1 and 8) whether at that turn, the car on that freeway has a car that covers x=0.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1=19. For each freeway k (1 to 8), we have a list of cars. Each car is (head, tail, direction, speed). Since all are right-moving, the direction is 'right'. \n\nFor a car (h, tau, d, s) at turn 19, at a future turn T (>=19), the car's position is:\n\nSince it is right-moving: the entire car moves to the right. The span at turn T is [tau + s*(T-19), h + s*(T-19)].\n\nBut note: the head and tail at turn 19: the car spans from tau to h (and since it's right-moving, we assume h>tau). But in the data:\n\nLook at freeway 1: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6). So at turn 19, the first car is from 1 to 12, and the second from 49 to 60.\n\nAt turn T, the first car: [1 + 6*(T-19), 12 + 6*(T-19)]\nSimilarly, the second car: [49 + 6*(T-19), 60 + 6*(T-19)]\n\nWe are at (0, y) at turn T. We are on freeway y at turn T. We must check if 0 is in any car's span on freeway y at turn T.\n\nSo for freeway y at turn T, we look at the list of cars for that freeway (given at turn 19) and compute their spans at turn T. Then check if 0 is in [a, b] for any car (where a = tau + s*(T-19), b = h + s*(T-19)).\n\nNote: the car spans are continuous intervals. So 0 is in [a,b] if a<=0<=b.\n\nWe must avoid that.\n\nNow, we are starting at turn 19 at y=4. We need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of actions without cars would be 5 (because 4->5->6->7->8->9: 5 steps). But we have to avoid collisions. Also, we can stay or go down to avoid, but that would take more steps.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe can do a BFS over states (turn, y) and check the collisions. But note the turns can be large? However, the cars move at high speeds and eventually the cars will move away from 0? But we are trying to minimize H, so we don't need to go too far in time.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the safe times for each freeway.\n\nBut note: we are constrained by the fact that we can only change y by at most 1 per turn. So we can only move to adjacent rows.\n\nWe'll try to find the minimal H such that we can go from (19,4) to (19+H-1,9) without collision at any turn from 19 to 19+H-1 (but note: at turn 19 we are at y=4, and we are about to take an action. However, we must check at turn 19: are we safe at turn 19? The problem doesn't say we are already safe? But the initial state is given, so we assume we are safe at turn 19? The problem says \"avoid collisions\", meaning during the entire sequence we must avoid collisions. So at the starting turn (19) we are at (0,4): we must check if at turn 19, on freeway 4, is there a car that has 0 in its span? \n\nLet me check freeway 4 at turn 19:\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (48, 1, right, 48) -> so at turn 19, the car is at [1,48]. Is 0 in [1,48]? No. So we are safe at turn 19.\n\nSimilarly, we must check every turn we are on a freeway.\n\nWe plan:\n\nWe'll simulate from turn 19 onward, and we try to go up as much as possible, but if at a future turn we would be in a collision, we might need to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid.\n\nWe are going to try to find the minimal H. We'll start by trying H=5: 5 moves to go from 4 to 9: 5 ups.\n\nBut we have to check the path:\n\nTurn 19: at y=4 -> then we take U -> turn20: y=5\nTurn20: at y=5 -> take U -> turn21: y=6\nTurn21: at y=6 -> take U -> turn22: y=7\nTurn22: at y=7 -> take U -> turn23: y=8\nTurn23: at y=8 -> take U -> turn24: y=9 -> goal at turn24.\n\nNow, we must check for each turn from 19 to 23 (because at turn24 we are at y=9, which is safe) we are on a freeway (if y in [1,8]) and check if at that turn, on that freeway, there is a car covering 0.\n\nWe are at:\n- Turn19: y=4 -> freeway4: we already checked: [1,48] at turn19 -> 0 not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\n- Turn20: y=5 -> freeway5. At turn20: T=20, so T-19=1.\n\n  Freeway5: cars: (-48,-59,right,12); (-12,-23,right,12); (24,13,right,12) -> wait, let me read:\n\n  The car list: \n      (-48, -59, right, 12) -> head=-48, tail=-59? But if it's right-moving and head should be greater than tail? But here head=-48 and tail=-59 -> so head>tail? -48 > -59 -> yes. So the span is from tail to head: [-59, -48] at turn19.\n\n  At turn20: T=20 -> T-19=1, so each car moves by 12*1 = 12 to the right.\n\n  Car1: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36]\n  Car2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0] -> wait: head=-12? The car is (-12,-23,right,12): so head=-12, tail=-23 -> at turn19: [-23,-12]. At turn20: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]. So 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, because -11<=0<=0.\n\n  So at turn20, on freeway5, there is a car that covers 0. Therefore, if we are at y=5 at turn20, we collide.\n\n  So the sequence of 5 ups fails at turn20.\n\nWe must avoid freeway5 at turn20.\n\nWe can try to delay going to freeway5. For example, at turn19 we do not go up immediately? Or we go up but then later avoid.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go faster? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nOr we can try to skip freeway5 at turn20 by not being there at turn20. How? We can stay at y=4 for an extra turn? Then go up.\n\nBut we want minimal H.\n\nWe might try H=6: then we can have one extra action.\n\nPossibilities:\n\nOption 1: Stay at turn19: then at turn20 we are still at y=4. Then we can go up at turn20 to y=5 at turn21? But we need to check the safety.\n\nWe must check for each state we enter.\n\nLet me denote the state (turn, y) and check if safe.\n\nWe start at (19,4): safe.\n\nWe consider actions at turn19: U, D, S.\n\nBut we want to go up, so we try U and S? D would go down to 3, which is away from goal.\n\nSo we try:\n\nOption A: at turn19: S -> then at turn20: y=4 (still). Then at turn20 we take U -> turn21: y=5.\n\nBut we must check:\n\nTurn19: y=4 -> safe (we know)\nTurn20: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn20: \n  Freeway4: car: (48,1,right,48) -> at turn20: [1+48*1, 48+48*1] = [49,96] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nThen turn21: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn21: T=21, T-19=2.\n\n  Freeway5 cars:\n    Car1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> at turn21: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in [-35,-24]\n    Car2: (-12,-23,right,12) -> [-23+24, -12+24] = [1, 12] -> 0 not in [1,12]\n    Car3: (24,13,right,12) -> [13+24, 24+24] = [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48]\n\nSo safe at turn21.\n\nThen we can proceed:\n\nTurn21: at y=5, take U -> turn22: y=6\n  Freeway6 at turn22: T=22, T-19=3.\n\n  Freeway6: same cars as freeway5? \n    The table: \n        freeway5 and 6 and 7 have the same cars? \n        Actually, the table:\n        | 5 | (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12) |\n        | 6 | same as 5? \n        | 7 | same as 5? \n        | 8 | (48,1,right,48)\n\n    So freeway6: same as freeway5: three cars.\n\n    At T=22: \n        Car1: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in [-23,-12]\n        Car2: [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> 0 not in [13,24]\n        Car3: [13+36, 24+36] = [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60]\n    Safe.\n\nTurn22: at y=6, take U -> turn23: y=7\n  Freeway7 at turn23: T=23, T-19=4.\n    Freeway7: same cars as freeway5.\n        Car1: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nOh no! So at turn23, if we are at y=7, we collide.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway7 at turn23.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid freeway7 at turn23.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nWe are at turn22: we are at y=6. Instead of going up to y=7 at turn23, we might do something else.\n\nBut we are at turn22: we have to choose an action. We could stay at y=6 at turn23? Or go down? But we want to go up.\n\nSo at turn22: we are at y=6. We take S: then at turn23 we are still at y=6.\n\nThen at turn23: we are at y=6 -> freeway6 at turn23: T=23, T-19=4.\n  Freeway6: same cars as above.\n      Car1: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 in [-11,0] -> collision? \n      But wait: head=-48+48=0, tail=-59+48=-11 -> so the car is from -11 to 0. So 0 is included -> collision.\n\nSo if we stay at y=6 at turn23, we also collide.\n\nWhat if we go down? At turn22: from y=6 we take D -> then at turn23: y=5.\n\nThen at turn23: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn23: T=23, T-19=4.\n  Freeway5: \n      Car1: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSame problem.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway5,6,7 at turn23? \n\nBut freeway8? We haven't reached there.\n\nWe are stuck at turn23.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeways 5,6,7 at turn23.\n\nBut we are at turn22 at y=6. We could have planned differently earlier.\n\nAlternatively, we could have taken an extra stay earlier.\n\nLet me try to avoid being at freeway5 at turn20? We did that by staying at turn19. But then we ran into trouble at turn23.\n\nWe need to see the critical times.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway and each turn (around 19 to maybe 30) whether it is safe.\n\nLet me compute the unsafe times for each freeway.\n\nFreeway1 and 2: same cars: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n\nFor freeway1: \n  Car1: at turn T: [1+6*(T-19), 12+6*(T-19)]\n        unsafe if 1+6*(T-19) <= 0 <= 12+6*(T-19) -> \n        1+6*(T-19) <= 0 -> 6*(T-19) <= -1 -> T-19 <= -1/6 -> never? since T>=19 -> T-19>=0.\n        Actually, we need 1+6*(T-19) <= 0 <= 12+6*(T-19)\n        The lower bound: 1+6*(T-19) <= 0 -> T-19 <= -1/6 -> impossible for T>=19.\n        So car1 is never at 0? because it starts at [1,12] and moves right.\n\n  Car2: [49+6*(T-19), 60+6*(T-19)] -> always positive? so 0 is never in the interval.\n\n  So freeway1 and 2 are always safe? \n\nFreeway3: (48,1,right,48)\n  [1+48*(T-19), 48+48*(T-19)]\n  unsafe if 1+48*(T-19) <= 0 <= 48+48*(T-19)\n  Lower bound: 1+48*(T-19) <=0 -> 48*(T-19) <= -1 -> T-19 <= -1/48 -> impossible.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? no, freeway4 has the same car? \n  The table: \n      3: (48,1,right,48)\n      4: (48,1,right,48)\n      8: (48,1,right,48)\n\n  So freeway4: same as freeway3: always safe.\n\nFreeway5,6,7: three cars: \n  Car1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> at T: [-59+12*(T-19), -48+12*(T-19)]\n        unsafe if -59+12*(T-19) <= 0 <= -48+12*(T-19)\n        -> \n        -59+12*(T-19) <= 0 -> 12*(T-19) <= 59 -> T-19 <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916 -> T<=23.916 -> T<=23 (since integer)\n        and \n        0 <= -48+12*(T-19) -> 48 <= 12*(T-19) -> T-19 >= 4 -> T>=23.\n\n        So for T=23: \n          T-19=4: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n        For T=24: \n          T-19=5: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So unsafe only at T=23? \n\n        But wait: T-19=4: [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? because the head is 0? \n        The problem says: the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]. \n        And the head is the front? and tail the rear? So if head=0, then the car covers 0? Yes.\n\n        But what about T=22? \n          T-19=3: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n\n        T=24: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So car1 is unsafe at T=23.\n\n  Car2: (-12,-23,right,12) -> at T: [-23+12*(T-19), -12+12*(T-19)]\n        unsafe if -23+12*(T-19) <=0<= -12+12*(T-19)\n        -> \n        -23+12*(T-19) <=0 -> 12*(T-19)<=23 -> T-19<=23/12≈1.916 -> T<=20.916 -> T<=20\n        and \n        0<=-12+12*(T-19) -> 12<=12*(T-19) -> T-19>=1 -> T>=20.\n\n        So only at T=20: \n          T-19=1: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes.\n\n        So unsafe at T=20.\n\n  Car3: (24,13,right,12) -> at T: [13+12*(T-19), 24+12*(T-19)]\n        unsafe if 13+12*(T-19)<=0<=24+12*(T-19)\n        The lower bound: 13+12*(T-19)<=0 -> 12*(T-19)<=-13 -> T-19<= -13/12 -> impossible.\n\n        So car3 is always safe.\n\nTherefore, for freeway5,6,7:\n  Unsafe at:\n      T=20: because of car2 -> unsafe for all three freeways? \n          But note: the same car configuration is on freeway5,6,7? \n          The table says freeway5,6,7 have the same set of cars.\n\n  So freeway5,6,7 are unsafe at:\n      T=20 (because of car2: [-11,0] at T=20)\n      T=23 (because of car1: [-11,0] at T=23)\n\n  And safe at other times.\n\nFreeway8: (48,1,right,48) -> same as freeway3: always safe.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways and turns:\n\n- Freeway1,2,3,4,8: always safe.\n- Freeway5,6,7: unsafe at turns 20 and 23.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 5,6,7 at turns 20 and 23.\n\nNow, we are at turn19 at y=4 (freeway4, safe).\n\nWe want to go to y=9. The path must go through freeways 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeways 5,6,7 at turns 20 and 23.\n\nWe can plan the moves:\n\nWe are at turn19: y=4.\n\nWe must not be on freeway5,6,7 at turn20. Since we are at y=4 at turn19, we can only move to y=3,4,5 at turn20.\n\nIf we go up (U) at turn19, we become y=5 at turn20 -> but turn20: freeway5 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nIf we stay (S) at turn19, we become y=4 at turn20 -> safe (freeway4 always safe).\n\nIf we go down (D) at turn19, we become y=3 at turn20 -> freeway3 is always safe.\n\nSo we cannot go up at turn19. We must do S or D.\n\nBut D would go away from goal, so we choose S: stay at y=4 at turn20.\n\nNow turn20: we are at y=4. Then we take an action.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway5,6,7 at turn23. But note we are at turn20 now.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. We are at y=4 at turn20. We need to go up 5 steps: 4->5->6->7->8->9.\n\nBut we have to skip the unsafe turns.\n\nThe unsafe turns for freeways 5,6,7 are 20 and 23. We already avoided turn20 for freeway5,6,7 by not being on them at turn20.\n\nNow, we must avoid being on freeway5,6,7 at turn23.\n\nWe are at turn20: y=4.\n\nWe can go up at turn20: then at turn21 we are at y=5.\n\nThen we can go up at turn21: turn22: y=6.\n\nThen at turn22: we are at y=6. Now, we must not be on freeway5,6,7 at turn23. But at turn23, if we are at y=6 (freeway6) we collide. So we must not be at y=5,6,7 at turn23.\n\nWhat can we do at turn22? We are at y=6. We can:\n\nOption 1: Go up to y=7 at turn23 -> but then we are at freeway7 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n\nOption 2: Stay at y=6 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n\nOption 3: Go down to y=5 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=5,6,7 at turn23.\n\nTherefore, we must arrange so that at turn23 we are not on freeways 5,6,7. That means we must be at y<=4 or y>=8 at turn23.\n\nBut we are at turn22 at y=6. How can we be at y<=4 at turn23? We can go down: from 6 to 5 (but that would be unsafe at turn23) or to 4? But going down from 6: D gives 5, then we are at 5 at turn23 -> unsafe. We can do two downs? But we are at turn22: we can only do one action.\n\nFrom y=6 at turn22, we can only get to y=5,6,7 at turn23. All of these are unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at y=6 at turn22? We need to adjust earlier.\n\nWe are at turn21: we are at y=5 (if we went up from turn20). Then at turn21 we take an action.\n\nAt turn21: we are at y=5 (freeway5). Turn21: safe? because unsafe turns are 20 and 23 -> so 21 is safe.\n\nWe can choose:\n\n- U: then turn22: y=6 -> then we are stuck as above.\n\n- S: then turn22: y=5 -> then at turn22 we are at y=5 -> safe? (turn22 is not 20 or 23 -> safe). Then at turn22 we are at y=5. Then at turn22 we must choose: we cannot go to y=5,6,7 at turn23. So we must go to y=4 or y=8? \n\n  But from y=5, we can go down to y=4 at turn23 -> that's freeway4, safe.\n\n  Or up to y=6 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n\n  Or stay -> unsafe.\n\n  So we can go down to y=4 at turn23.\n\n  Then at turn23: we are at y=4 (safe).\n\n  Then we can go up from there. But we are at y=4 at turn23, and we need to get to y=9: 5 more steps? \n\n  But we are at turn23, then we take actions: we need to go 4->5->6->7->8->9: 5 steps, so at turn28 we reach y=9.\n\n  That would be H = 28 - 19 = 9? But we started at turn19, and we take actions until turn27? because at turn27 we take the last action to get to 9 at turn28? But we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 19+H-1.\n\n  We want at turn T=19+H-1 we are at 9.\n\n  We are at turn23: y=4. Then we take 5 actions: at turns23,24,25,26,27: then at turn28 we are at 9. So T=28 = 19+H-1 -> H-1=9 -> H=10.\n\n  But we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, from turn21 (y=5) we can go down to y=4 at turn22? \n\n  Then at turn22: y=4 (safe). Then we are at y=4 at turn22. Then we must avoid being at y=5,6,7 at turn23. So we can stay at y=4 (safe) or go down to y=3 (safe) or go up to y=5 (unsafe). \n\n  But we want to go up. So we can stay at y=4 at turn23? \n\n  Then at turn23: y=4 (safe). Then we can start going up.\n\n  But then we have to go from y=4 to 9: 5 steps. So we would be at y=9 at turn28? Same as above.\n\nBut we might avoid the unsafe turn by waiting at a safe freeway until turn24.\n\nNote: at turn24, freeways 5,6,7 are safe again (because unsafe only at 20 and 23).\n\nSo we can be at freeway5,6,7 at turn24.\n\nWe are at turn21: y=5 (safe). Instead of going up or down, we can stay at y=5 for one extra turn? \n\nAt turn21: we take S -> then at turn22: we are still at y=5 -> safe? turn22: not 20 or 23 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn22: we are at y=5. Then we can take U at turn22: then at turn23: we would be at y=6 -> unsafe.\n\nBut we can't be at y=5,6,7 at turn23.\n\nAlternatively, at turn22: we can go down to y=4? then at turn23: y=4 (safe). Then we lose progress.\n\nBut then at turn23: we are at y=4. Then we can go up at turn23: to y=5 at turn24 -> which is safe (turn24 is safe for freeway5).\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nSo plan from turn21:\n\nTurn21: y=5 -> take D? or S? \n\nIf we take S at turn21: then turn22: y=5 (safe). Then at turn22: we take D? to go to y=4 at turn23? Then turn23: y=4 (safe). Then at turn23: take U -> turn24: y=5 (safe). Then we go up: turn24: U -> turn25: y=6; turn25: U -> turn26: y=7; turn26: U -> turn27: y=8; turn27: U -> turn28: y=9.\n\nSo we reach at turn28: H = 28 - 19 = 9, but the number of actions: from turn19 to turn27: 9 actions? \n\nWe started at turn19: \n  turn19: S (to avoid being at y=5 at turn20)\n  turn20: U (to go to y=5 at turn21)\n  turn21: S (to stay at y=5 at turn22) \n  turn22: D (to go to y=4 at turn23) -> but this is going down, which is away from goal. \n  Then turn23: U (to y=5 at turn24)\n  turn24: U (y=6)\n  turn25: U (y=7)\n  turn26: U (y=8)\n  turn27: U (y=9)\n\nSo at turn27 we are at y=9? \n\nBut we take action at turn27: U, then at turn28 we are at y=9+1? no, because y must be in [0,9]. But we are at y=8 at turn27: then we take U -> y=9 at turn28. But we require to be at y=9 at turn T = 19+H-1.\n\nSo T = 28 = 19+H-1 -> H-1=9 -> H=10? \n\nBut we took 9 actions: at turns 19,20,...,27. Then the position at turn28 is 9. But the problem says: we want at turn t1+H-1 to be at 9. So t1+H-1 = 19+H-1 = 28 -> H-1=9 -> H=10.\n\nBut we took 9 actions? \n\nThe sequence of actions: \n   t1 (19) to t1+9-1 (27): 9 actions? \n\nThe problem: the sequence is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. So if H=10, then t=0 to 9: actions at turns 19,20,...,28? \n\nBut we only need to take actions until we are at 9 at the end of the last action. \n\nActually, we take H actions: at turns 19,20,...,19+H-1. Then at turn 19+H we are at the new position. But the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nClarification from the problem: \n   \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo after taking the last action at turn t1+H-1, the position at that same turn is 9? \n\nBut the update: \n   at turn t, we take a_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo the position at turn t is determined by the previous actions. The action at turn t changes the position for turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, the position at turn t1 is given (4). Then we take action at turn t1: a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1}=4+delta.\n\nWe want that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nBut at turn t1+H-1, we are there because of the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2? \n\nActually, the state at turn t (>=t1) is determined by the actions taken from t1 to t-1.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, we have taken H-1 actions: from turn t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which would be H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, then that action would change the position at turn t1+H. So the position at turn t1+H-1 is determined by actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nTherefore, the action at turn t1+H-1 is not used to determine y_{t1+H-1}? \n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where Delta y_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. We choose a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo the position at turn t is not affected by a_t.\n\nTherefore, to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, we must have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 (a total of H-1 actions) to get from the initial state at t1 to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is of H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen the last action (at turn t1+H-1) would affect y_{t1+H}, not y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nThis is a problem in the problem statement.\n\nBut note the answer format: \n   Turn t1: a_{t1}\n   Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n   ...\n   up to some turn.\n\nAnd we are to minimize H, the number of turns in the sequence.\n\nAnd we require that after taking the sequence of H actions (the last action at turn t1+H-1), the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nBut as per the update, the position at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the actions taken from turn t1 to t1+H-2. The action at turn t1+H-1 doesn't affect it.\n\nThis suggests that the last action is redundant? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we stop when we first reach 9. So the last action is the one that moves us to 9 at the next turn? But then the position at the turn when we take the last action is not 9.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo it explicitly requires the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nTherefore, the action at turn t1+H-1 is not used to get to 9 at turn t1+H-1. It must be that the last action that matters is at turn t1+H-2.\n\nBut then why include an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nUnless the problem means that we take actions until we are at 9 at the turn after the last action? But that would be turn t1+H.\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo I think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nPerhaps the update is instantaneous within the turn? But the problem states: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo it's clear.\n\nAnother possibility: the player position at turn t is after the action of turn t-1. And at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, which will determine y_{t+1}. \n\nThen to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, we need to have arrived at 9 by turn t1+H-1, which is the result of actions taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2.\n\nThen the action at turn t1+H-1 is not needed for reaching 9 at turn t1+H-1. It might be taken arbitrarily? but the problem says we take a sequence of H actions.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is the minimal number of actions to get to 9, and then we list the actions taken from turn t1 until the action that gets us to 9 at the next turn. But then the position at turn t1+H-1 would be the result after H-1 actions, not after H actions.\n\nFor example, to go from 4 to 9, we need 5 actions: \n   turn19: U -> turn20:5\n   turn20: U -> turn21:6\n   turn21: U -> turn22:7\n   turn22: U -> turn23:8\n   turn23: U -> turn24:9\n\nThen we are at turn24: y=9. So we took 5 actions (at turns19 to23). Then the position at turn23 is 8, and at turn24 is 9. But the problem requires the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. Here, if H=5, then turn t1+H-1 = 19+5-1=23, and at turn23 we are at 8, not 9.\n\nSo we would need to include an extra action? But then we are at 9 at turn24, so turn24 = 19+5 = t1+5, so then we would set H=6? and then turn t1+H-1=19+6-1=24, which is 9.\n\nBut that extra action at turn24 is not needed because we are already at 9? and the action at turn24 doesn't change anything if we do S? but then we are at 9 at turn24 and also at turn25 if we do S.\n\n To have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must have taken actions that make us reach 9 at turn t1+H-1. In the above, we reach 9 at turn24. So if we set H=6, then we want y_{19+6-1}=y_{24}=9. And we would have taken actions at turns19,20,21,22,23,24. But the action at turn24 doesn't affect y_{24} (it affects y_{25}). So we can do any action at turn24, but we are already at 9 at turn24.\n\nSo for the purpose of the problem, we can do:\n\n  actions at turn19,20,21,22,23: U,U,U,U,U -> then at turn24 we are at 9.\n  then at turn24: we can do S (or anything) to have an action at turn24.\n\nBut then the sequence has 6 actions, and we are at 9 at turn24 = 19+6-1.\n\nSo H=6.\n\nBut without the car, we would have H=6 for this path, but we can do it in 5 moves? but then we aren't at 9 at turn23.\n\nGiven the problem statement, we must have the position at turn t1+H-1=9, and we take H actions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is the minimal number of actions such that we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and the actions are taken from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn the car-free case, we can do:\n   turn19: U -> turn20:5\n   turn20: U -> turn21:6\n   turn21: U -> turn22:7\n   turn22: U -> turn23:8\n   turn23: U -> turn24:9  -> but then at turn23 we are at 8, not 9.\n   turn24: S -> turn25:9? no, turn25 would be 9 if we did U at turn24, but then we are at turn24: if we do S, we stay at 8? \n\nWe are at turn23: we are at 8. We want to be at 9 at turn24. So we take U at turn23: then at turn24 we are at 9. So then we would take actions until turn23: 5 actions: turns19 to23. Then at turn24 we are at 9. So to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we need turn t1+H-1=24 -> 19+H-1=24 -> H=6. And the actions are at turns19,20,21,22,23,24? But the action at turn24 would then be for the next state.\n\nI think the problem means that after taking the sequence of H actions (at turns t1 to t1+H-1), the position at the next turn (t1+H) is 9? but then it says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me assume that the position at turn t is after the action of turn t-1, and we require that at some turn T, we have y_T=9, and T = t1+H-1. We take actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, but the last action (at turn t1+H-1) doesn't affect y_{t1+H-1} (it affects y_{t1+H}).\n\nTherefore, to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, the actions that matter are the ones from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2.\n\nAnd the action at turn t1+H-1 can be arbitrary (as long as it doesn't cause a collision on the freeway we are on at turn t1+H-1, which is y=9, and there are no cars at y=9, so safe).\n\nSo in the car-free case, to be at 9 at turn24 ( which is 19+5), we would take actions at turns19 to23: five actions, and then one extra action at turn24 (which is safe) to make H=6.\n\nSo H=6 in car-free.\n\nWith cars, we need to get to y=9 at some turn T, and T = 19+H-1.\n\nWe want minimal H.\n\nBack to our problem.\n\nWe are at turn19: y=4.\n\nWe must avoid freeway5,6,7 at turns20 and23.\n\nWe try to find a path to be at y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe direct path failed because of turn20 and turn23.\n\nWe can try to be at y=9 at turn24: then T=24, so 19+H-1=24 -> H=6.\n\nCan we do it in 6 actions? That means we have to go from 4 to 9 in 5 moves (because the actions from turn19 to turn23 (5 actions) determine y24, but we want y_{24}=9. Actually, we want y_{19+H-1}=y_{24}=9, so we need to be at 9 at turn24.\n\nHow do we get from y=4 at turn19 to y=9 at turn24? That requires 5 net up moves. In 5 actions (at turns19,20,21,22,23), we can do 5 ups: then y24 = 4+5 =9.\n\nSo actions: U,U,U,U,U at turns19 to23.\n\nBut we have to check the safety at each turn we are on freeways 1-8.\n\nWe already know turn19: y=4 safe.\nTurn20: y=5 -> freeway5: unsafe at turn20 -> collide.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn19.\n\nWhat if we do:\n  turn19: S -> then turn20: y=4\n  turn20: U -> turn21: y=5\n  turn21: U -> turn22: y=6\n  turn22: U -> turn23: y=7\n  turn23: U -> turn24: y=8 -> not 9.\n\nThen we are at 8 at turn24, not 9.\n\nWe need five ups in five actions, but we can't do U at turn19 because of turn20 collision.\n\nWe can do U at turn19 and then avoid freeway5 at turn20 by being elsewhere? But we can only be at y=3,4,5 at turn20.\n\ny=3 or 4 are safe, but then we are behind.\n\nFor H=6, we want to be at 9 at turn24.\n\nWe have turns19,20,21,22,23 to take actions (5 actions) to move from 4 to 9: requires 5 ups.\n\nThe only way is to do 5 ups in these 5 turns. But we cannot do U at turn19 because then we are at y=5 at turn20 -> unsafe.\n\nTherefore, H=6 is not possible.\n\nNext, try H=7: then we want to be at 9 at turn19+7-1=25.\n\nSo we have 6 actions (turns19 to24) to go from 4 to 9: net +5, so we can have 5 ups and 1 extra action that does nothing (S) or something (but down would require more ups).\n\nSo we can do 5 ups and 1 stay.\n\nWe need to arrange the sequence to avoid unsafe turns.\n\nUnsafe turns: 20 and 23 for freeways 5,6,7.\n\nWe are at turn19: y=4.\n\nWe cannot do U at turn19 because then we are at y=5 at turn20 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must do S or D at turn19.\n\nDo S at turn19: then turn20: y=4 (safe).\n\nThen at turn20: we can do U -> turn21: y=5 (turn21 is safe for freeway5).\nThen turn21: U -> turn22: y=6 (safe, because turn22 not unsafe).\nThen turn22: we are at y=6. Then we must avoid being at y=5,6,7 at turn23.\n\nSo at turn22: we cannot be at y=6 at turn23? Because then we would be at freeway6 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n\nWe can do at turn22: \n  Option: go up to y=7 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n  stay at y=6 -> unsafe.\n  go down to y=5 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be at freeway5,6,7 at turn23.\n\nTherefore, at turn23, we must be at y<=4 or y>=8.\n\nFrom y=6 at turn22, we can only change by one, so at turn23 we can only be at y=5,6,7 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be at y=6 at turn22? \n\nWe are at turn21: y=5. Then at turn21, we can choose to not go to y=6 at turn22.\n\nWe can stay at y=5 at turn22: then at turn22: y=5 (safe, because turn22 not unsafe). Then at turn22: we are at y=5. Then at turn22 we must choose an action for turn23.\n\nWe want to avoid being at y=5,6,7 at turn23.\n\nSo we can go down to y=4 at turn23: then safe.\n\nThen at turn23: y=4. Then we need to get to 9: we are at 4, need +5, and we have actions at turns23,24 ( two actions) -> not enough.\n\nWe can go up to y=6 at turn23? -> unsafe.\n\nOr stay -> unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe choice from y=5 at turn22 is to go down to y=4 at turn23.\n\nThen at turn23: y=4. Then we have to do four more ups: but we have actions at turn23,24,25 ( three actions) for turns23,24,25: \n  turn23: U -> turn24: y=5\n  turn24: U -> turn25: y=6\n  turn25: U -> turn26: y=7\n  then we are at y=7 at turn26, not 9.\n\nAnd we have only three actions from turn23 to turn25 ( if we are to reach 9 at turn25? We want at turn25: y=9? Because for H=7, we want turn19+7-1=25 to be at 9.\n\nFrom turn23: y=4, to turn25: two actions: turn23 and turn24 -> can only move to y=6 at turn25? not 9.\n\nSo we need more turns.\n\nAlternatively, at turn21: from y=5, we can go down to y=4 at turn22. Then at turn22: y=4. Then at turn22: we can go up to y=5 at turn23 -> unsafe ( because turn23 and freeway5).\n\nOr stay at y=4 at turn23: safe.\n\nThen we are at turn23: y=4. Then we need to get to 9 by turn25? only two actions: impossible.\n\nSo for H=7, we cannot reach.\n\nNow try H=8: want at turn19+8-1=26: y=9.\n\nWe have 7 actions ( turns19 to25) to go from 4 to 9: net +5, so we can have 5 ups and 2 extras (which can be S or D, but D would require more ups).\n\nWe can do 5 ups and 2 stays.\n\nWe need to arrange to avoid unsafe turns.\n\nWe are at turn19: y=4.\n\nWe cannot do U at turn19 because of turn20. So we do S at turn19: turn20: y=4.\n\nThen turn20: we can do U: turn21: y=5 (safe, because turn21 not unsafe).\nThen turn21: we can do U: turn22: y=6 (safe).\nNow at turn22: we are at y=6. We must avoid being at y=5,6,7 at turn23.\n\nWe can do at turn22: \n  U: to y=7 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n  S: to y=6 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n  D: to y=5 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must leave freeways 5-7 by turn23.\n\nHow about at turn21: from y=5, we do not go to y=6, but we do S or D.\n\nOption: turn21: S -> turn22: y=5 (safe).\nThen at turn22: we are at y=5. We must avoid y=5,6,7 at turn23. So we can only go to y=4 at turn23 ( by doing D).\n\nThen turn22: D -> turn23: y=4 (safe).\n\nThen at turn23: y=4. Then we have to get to 9 by turn26.\n\nFrom turn23 to turn26: 3 actions ( turns23,24,25) -> can move +3 at most: to y=7 at turn26? not 9.\n\nWe need +5 from turn23: impossible in 3 actions.\n\nOption at turn21: D -> turn22: y=4 (safe).\nThen turn22: then we can go U to y=5 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n\nOr stay at y=4 at turn23: safe.\n\nThen turn23: y=4. Same as above, only can get to y=7 at turn26.\n\nNot enough.\n\nSo we need to be at a higher y sooner.\n\nHow about we do at turn20: after the initial S at turn19, we do not U at turn20, but we do S or D.\n\n turn19: S -> turn20: y=4.\n turn20: S -> turn21: y=4.\n turn21: U -> turn22: y=5.\n turn22: U -> turn23: y=6 -> unsafe at turn23.\n\n turn21: U -> turn22: y=5.\n turn22: we can try to go up to y=6 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n\nSo to avoid turn23, we must be at y=4 at turn22 or earlier, then at turn22 we can go to y=3,4,5 -> but 5 is unsafe at turn23.\n\nOr if we are at y=8 at turn23, that is safe. So how to be at y=8 at turn23.\n\nFrom turn19: \n  turn19: S -> turn20: y=4.\n  turn20: U -> turn21: y=5.\n  turn21: U -> turn22: y=6.\n  turn22: U -> turn23: y=7 -> unsafe.\n\n turn22: we can't go to y=8 from y=6 in one step.\n\n So impossible to be at y=8 at turn23 from y=4 in 4 actions.\n\n turn19: U is not possible because of turn20.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=4 at turn23? Then from there, we can go up in the subsequent turns.\n\nBut for H=8, we want to be at 9 at turn26.\n\nFrom turn23: y=4, we need 5 actions to go to 9: turns23,24,25,26,27: actions at turns23 to27, then at turn28 we are at 9. So we would need to be at 9 at turn28, which would be for H=10.\n\nBut we are to minimize H.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to wait until turn24 to be on freeway5,6,7, because at turn24 they are safe.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n turn19: S -> turn20: y=4.\n turn20: S -> turn21: y=4.\n turn21: U -> turn22: y=5.\n turn22: U -> turn23: y=6 -> unsafe at turn23.\n\n not good.\n\n turn19: S -> turn20: y=4.\n turn20: S -> turn21: y=4.\n turn21: S -> turn22: y:4.\n turn22: U -> turn23: y=5 -> unsafe at turn23.\n\n not good.\n\n turn19: S -> turn20: y=4.\n turn20: U -> turn21: y=5.\n turn21: S -> turn22: y=5.\n turn22: S -> turn23: y=5 -> unsafe at turn23.\n\n turn22: at y=5, we can go down to y=4 at turn23: safe.\n  sequence: \n      turn19: S\n      turn20: U\n      turn21: S\n      turn22: D\n      turn23: y=4.\n then we need to get to 9 by turn26: \n      turn23: from y=4, we take actions at turn23,24,25 ( three actions) -> can only get to y=7 at turn26.\n\n not 9.\n\n turn19: S\n turn20: U\n turn21: D -> turn22: y=4.\n turn22: U -> turn23: y=5 -> unsafe.\n\nSo the only way to avoid turn23 is to be at y<=4 or y>=8 at turn23.\n\n being at y>=8 at turn23: from y=4 at turn19, in 4 actions ( turns19,20,21,22) we can only move +4, to y=8, but then we are at freeway8 at turn23, which is safe ( freeway8 is always safe).\n\nSo if we can do 4 ups in the 4 actions, we will be at y=8 at turn23.\n\nThen at turn23: we are at y=8 (safe). Then we can do U at turn23: turn24: y=9. So then at turn24: y=9. This is for turn24 = 19+H-1. So 19+H-1=24 -> H=6.\n\nBut can we do 4 ups in 4 actions ( turns19,20,21,22) to get to y=8 at turn23?\n\nWe start at turn19: y=4.\n\n action at turn19: U -> turn20: y=5 -> but at turn20, freeway5 is unsafe -> collide.\n\n so we cannot do U at turn19.\n\nTherefore, we cannot get to y=8 in 4 actions without passing through an unsafe state.\n\n unless we take a different path.\n\n But we have to go through freeway5 at some point, and if we go through freeway5 at turn20, it's unsafe.\n\n So we must avoid freeway5 at turn20.\n\n The only safe freeways at turn20 are y<5 or>7, but we are at y=4, and we can only move to y=3,4,5.\n\n y=3,4 are safe at turn20.\n\n So we can be at y=4 at turn20 by doing S at turn19.\n\n Then at turn20: we are at y=4. Then we need to get to y=8 at turn23, which requires +4 in 3 actions ( turns20,21,22).\n\n So we must do 4 ups in 3 actions? impossible.\n\n Therefore, we cannot be at y>=8 at turn23.\n\n So we must be at y<=4 at turn23.\n\n then from turn23: y<=4, we need to get to 9 by turn26 ( for H=8) requires +5 or more in 3 actions: impossible.\n\n next, try H=9: want turn19+9-1=27: y=9.\n\n then we have 8 actions ( turns19 to26) to go from 4 to 9: net +5, so 5 ups and 3 extra actions.\n\n we can use the extra actions to wait at safe places.\n\n plan to avoid unsafe turns:\n\n We must avoid being on freeway5,6,7 at turns20 and23.\n\n We can:\n\n turn19: S ( to avoid being at freeway5 at turn20) -> turn20: y=4.\n turn20: U -> turn21: y=5 ( safe, because turn21 is not 20 or 23).\n turn21: U -> turn22: y=6 ( safe).\n turn22: we must avoid being at y=5,6,7 at turn23. So we can do:\n\n      turn22: D -> turn23: y=5 -> unsafe ( because freeway5 at turn23) \n      turn22: S -> turn23: y=6 -> unsafe.\n      turn22: U -> turn23: y=7 -> unsafe.\n\n So instead, at turn21: after y=5, we do not go to y=6, but we wait.\n\n turn21: S -> turn22: y=5 ( safe).\n then at turn22: we can do D -> turn23: y=4 ( safe).\n then at turn23: y=4.\n then we need to go from 4 to 9 in 4 actions ( turns23,24,25,26) -> net +5: so 5 ups in 4 actions? impossible.\n\n turn21: from y=5, we can do D -> turn22: y=4.\n turn22: then we can do U -> turn23: y=5 -> unsafe.\n\n turn22: S -> turn23: y=4.\n same as above.\n\n So we need to wait at a safe freeway until turn24.\n\n For example, at turn22: we are at y=6. We can't stay there for turn23. But if we could be at a safe freeway at turn22 for two turns, but we can only move one per turn.\n\n How about we go to freeway8 at turn22? But we are at y=6 at turn21. To get to y=8 at turn22, we would need +2 in one action: impossible.\n\n So the earliest we can be at freeway8 is turn23 if we do two ups from turn21: \n   turn21: y=5 -> U -> turn22: y=6 -> U -> turn23: y=7 -> unsafe.\n\n not good.\n\n turn21: y=5 -> U -> turn22: y=6.\n turn22: we can't go to y=8.\n\n So we must be at y=4 at turn23.\n\n then from turn23: y=4, we do:\n\n turn23: U -> turn24: y=5 ( safe, because turn24 is safe for freeway5).\n turn24: U -> turn25: y=6 ( safe)\n turn25: U -> turn26: y7 ( safe)\n turn26: U -> turn27: y8 ( safe)\n turn27: U -> turn28: y9.\n\n then we are at y9 at turn28 = 19+H-1 -> 19+H-1=28 -> H=10.\n\n and actions from turn19 to turn27: 9 actions? wait, for H=10, actions at turns19 to 19+10-1 =28.\n\n But we need actions until turn27 to get to 9 at turn28.\n\n So actions: \n   turn19: S\n   turn20: U\n   turn21: U\n   turn22: D   # to avoid turn23 at y=6, we go down to y=5 at turn23? but then unsafe. wait, we are at turn22: from y=6, we go down to y=5 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n\n we went to y=4 at turn23 by doing turn21: something that gets us to y=4 at turn23.\n\n earlier: turn19: S -> turn20: y=4\n turn20: U -> turn21: y=5\n turn21: D -> turn22: y=4\n turn22: S -> turn23: y=4\n\n then turn23: U -> turn24: y=5\n turn24: U -> turn25: y=6\n turn25: U -> turn26: y7\n turn26: U -> turn27: y8\n turn27: U -> turn28: y9\n\n then at turn28: y=9.\n\n for H=10: turn19+10-1=28, yes.\n\n actions: 10 actions from turn19 to turn28.\n\n But the sequence has 10 actions.\n\n Is there a shorter path?\n\n We could try to be at y=9 sooner.\n\n Note that freeway5,6,7 are safe after turn23 ( safe at turn24 onward).\n\n from turn19: \n   turn19: S  # to avoid turn20 at y=5\n   turn20: S  # stay at y=4\n   turn21: U  # y=5 at turn21 -> safe\n   turn22: U  # y=6 at turn22 -> safe\n   turn23: we must not be at y=5,6,7 -> so we can do nothing to avoid if we are at y=6 at turn22. \n        but if at turn22 we are at y=6, and we do U, then turn23: y=7 -> unsafe.\n        if we do D, then turn23: y=5 -> unsafe.\n        if we do S, then turn23: y=6 -> unsafe.\n\n so we must not be at freeway5,6,7 at turn22 either? no, turn22 is safe.\n\n but at turn22 we are at y=6, and we have to do an action for turn23.\n\n unless we can be at y=8 at turn23 from turn22: but we can't.\n\n so we must be at y=4 at turn23.\n\n to be at y=4 at turn23, we can do from turn21: \n   turn21: at y=5, we can do D to go to y=4 at turn22.\n   then turn22: at y=4, we can do S to stay at y=4 at turn23.\n\n then turn23: y=4.\n turn24: U -> y=5\n turn25: U -> y=6\n turn26: U -> y=7\n turn27: U -> y=8\n turn28: U -> y=9\n\n then at turn28: y=9.\n\n same as above, H=10.\n\n to save one action, we could try to do an extra up somewhere.\n\n for example, at turn22: from y=4, we could go up to y=5 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n\n not possible.\n\n or at turn19: is there a way to progress more on safe freeways.\n\n turn19: we can't go up, but we can go down? \n   turn19: D -> turn20: y=3 ( freeway3: always safe) \n   turn20: U -> turn21: y=4\n   turn21: U -> turn22: y=5\n   turn22: U -> turn23: y=6 -> unsafe at turn23.\n\n same problem.\n\n turn19: D\n turn20: D -> turn21: y=2\n turn21: U -> turn22: y=3\n turn22: U -> turn23: y=4  ( safe)\n then from y=4 at turn23, same as before, need 5 ups: to and including turn27: then turn28: y=9.\n\n actions: \n   turn19: D\n   turn20: D\n   turn21: U\n   turn22: U\n   turn23: U\n   turn24: U\n   turn25: U\n   turn26: U\n   turn27: U\n   turn28: ? but we are at y=8 at turn27, then at turn28: we need to do U to get to 9 at turn29.\n\n then at turn29: y=9, so for H=11.\n\n worse.\n\n so the first plan is better.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n actions:\n   turn19: S  (y20=4)\n   turn20: U  (y21=5)\n   turn21: D  (y22=4)   # to avoid being at y=5 at turn22? no, we are at turn21: we do D from y=5 to go to y=4 at turn22.\n   turn22: S  (y23=4)   # or could we do U at turn22? then y23=5 -> unsafe. so must do S or D, but we want to save time, so S.\n   turn23: U  (y24=5)\n   turn24: U  (y25=6)\n   turn25: U  (y26=7)\n   turn26: U  (y27=8)\n   turn27: U  (y28=9)\n\n then we are at y=9 at turn28 = 19+10-1 = 28. -> H=10.\n\n actions at turns19 to28? But we have actions from turn19 to turn27: that's 9 actions. for H=10, we need actions for t=0 to 9, i.e., turns19 to 28. So one more action at turn28.\n\n at turn28: we are at y=9. We can do S.\n\n so the sequence is:\n\n turn19: S\nturn20: U\n turn21: D\n turn22: S\n turn23: U\n turn24: U\n turn25: U\n turn26: U\n turn27: U\n turn28: S\n\n then at turn28: we are still at y=9? no, we are at y=9 at the start of turn28. We take action S, so at turn29 we are at y=9. But we require to be at 9 at turn28.\n\n The action at turn28 doesn't affect turn28's position. So at turn28, we are at y=9 (from the action at turn27). Then we can do any action at turn28, and it doesn't change the fact that at turn28 we are at 9.\n\n So the last action is just to fill the sequence.\n\n We can do S at turn28.\n\n But is there a shorter sequence? We have 10 actions, but perhaps we can do with less by not going down.\n\n let me try to see if we can avoid the down move.\n\n after turn20: y=4, we did U at turn20 to get to y=5 at turn21.\n instead of down at turn21, can we stay at y=5 for two turns? \n\n turn21: S -> turn22: y=5 ( safe).\n turn22: then we must leave to avoid turn23. the only safe move from y=5 at turn22 is to go down to y=4 at turn23.\n so turn22: D -> turn23: y=4.\n\n same as before.\n\n or turn21: from y=5, we can go up to y=6 at turn22.\n turn22: then we are at y=6. Then we must do something at turn22 to avoid turn23: but we can only go to y=5,6,7 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n unless we can jump to y=0 or something, but we can't.\n\n so we must include a down move or equivalent.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n actions for 10 actions:\n\n turn19: S\n turn20: U\n turn21: D\n turn22: S\n turn23: U\n turn24: U\n turn25: U\n turn26: U\n turn27: U\n turn28: S   ( or any, but S is fine)\n\n But at turn27: we do U from y=8 to y=9 at turn28. So at turn28, we are at y=9.\n\n and the action at turn28: we do S, then at turn29 we are still at 9, but that's beyond.\n\n so the sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: S\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: D\nTurn 22: S\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: S\n}\n\n But wait, do we need the action at turn28? for H=10, we include actions from turn19 to turn28 (10 actions), and we are at y=9 at turn28 ( which is 19+10-1=28) -> satisfies.\n\n And we must check safety:\n\n turn19: y=4 -> freeway4: safe ( as before)\n turn20: y=4 -> freeway4: at turn20: [1+48,48+48] = [49,96] -> safe.\n turn21: y=5 -> freeway5: at turn21: T=21, T-19=2.\n        car1: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n        car2: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe.\n        car3: [13+24,24+24] = [37,48] -> safe.\n turn22: y=4 -> freeway4: at turn22: T=22, T-19=3 -> [1+48*3,48+48*3]= [145,192] -> safe.\n turn23: y=4 -> freeway4: at turn23: [1+48*4,48+48*4]= [193,240] -> safe.\n turn24: y=5 -> freeway5: at turn24: T=24, T-19=5.\n        car1: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe.\n        car2: [-23+60, -12+60] = [37,48] -> safe.\n        car3: [13+60,24+60] = [73,84] -> safe.\n turn25: y=6 -> freeway6: at turn25: T=25, T-19=6.\n        same as above, shifted by 12*6=72? \n        car1: [-59+72, -48+72] = [13,24] -> safe.\n        car2: [-23+72, -12+72] = [49,60] -> safe.\n        car3: [13+72,24+72] = [85,96] -> safe.\n turn26: y=7 -> freeway7: at turn26: T=26, T-19=7.\n        car1: [-59+84, -48+84] = [25,36] -> safe.\n        car2: [-23+84, -12+84] = [61,72] -> safe.\n        car3: [13+84,24+84] = [97,108] -> safe.\n turn27: y=8 -> freeway8: at turn27: T=27, T-19=8.\n        freeway8: car: (48,1,right,48) -> [1+48*8,48+48*8] = [385,432] -> safe.\n turn28: y=9 -> safe (no freeway).\n\n So safe throughout.\n\n But is there a shorter sequence?

Is there a way without going down? \n\n We could do at turn21: from y=5, we go up to y=6 at turn22.\n turn22: from y=6, we go up to y=7 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n\n or we could have waited more at lower levels.\n\n For example, at turn19: S\n turn20: S\n turn21: S  # y=4\n turn22: U  # y=5\n turn23: then we must avoid being at y=5 -> unsafe, so we do D to y=4 at turn24.\n turn24: y=4.\n then we need to get to 9 by turn27: 5 ups in 3 actions: impossible.\n\n so no.\n\n Therefore, the sequence is as above.\n\n Let me write it clearly.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn 19 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8, the minimal number of actions (H) is 10. The sequence of actions ensures the player avoids the unsafe times for freeways 5, 6, and 7 (unsafe at turns 20 and 23) and reaches y=9 at turn 28 (which is turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 19 + 10 - 1 = 28\\)).\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- **Turn 19: S** - Stay at y=4 (safe, as freeway 4 is safe at turn 19).\n- **Turn 20: U** - Move up to y=5 at turn 21 (safe, as freeway 5 is safe at turn 21).\n- **Turn 21: D** - Move down to y=4 at turn 22 (to avoid being on freeway 5, 6, or 7 at turn 23).\n- **Turn 22: S** - Stay at y=4 (safe, as freeway 4 is safe at turn 22).\n- **Turn 23: U** - Move up to y=5 at turn 24 (safe, as freeway 5 is safe at turn 24).\n- **Turn 24: U** - Move up to y=6 at turn 25 (safe, as freeway 6 is safe at turn 25).\n- **Turn 25: U** - Move up to y=7 at turn 26 (safe, as freeway 7 is safe at turn 26).\n- **Turn 26: U** - Move up to y=8 at turn 27 (safe, as freeway 8 is safe at turn 27).\n- **Turn 27: U** - Move up to y=9 at turn 28 (goal reached, y=9 has no cars).\n- **Turn 28: S** - Stay at y=9 (any action is safe at y=9; this completes the sequence of 10 actions).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is at y=9 at turn 28 and avoids all collisions:\n- At turn 19, y=4: freeway 4 car span [1, 48] does not include 0.\n- At turn 20, y=4: freeway 4 car span [49, 96] does not include 0.\n- At turn 21, y=5: freeway 5 car spans [-35, -24], [1, 12], [37, 48] do not include 0.\n- At turn 22, y=4: freeway 4 car span [145, 192] does not include 0.\n- At turn 23, y=4: freeway 4 car span [193, 240] does not include 0.\n- At turn 24, y=5: freeway 5 car spans [1, 12], [37, 48], [73, 84] do not include 0.\n- At turn 25, y=6: freeway 6 car spans [13, 24], [49, 60], [85, 96] do not include 0.\n- At turn 26, y=7: freeway 7 car spans [25, 36], [61, 72], [97, 108] do not include 0.\n- At turn 27, y=8: freeway 8 car span [385, 432] does not include 0.\n- At turn 28, y=9: no cars, safe.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: S \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: D \\\\\nTurn 22: S \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 21. I start at y=5.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Each car has a head and tail, and it moves left or right at a constant speed. Collision happens only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if I move to a different y, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the cars on my current y for collision.\n\nThe player update is: at each turn, I choose an action U, D, or S, which changes y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9, starting from y=5. Since I can only move one unit per turn, the minimum number of turns is 4, because 9-5=4, so I need at least 4 up moves. But I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nBut I have to avoid the cars on freeways 1 to 8. Freeway y=0 and y=9 are not mentioned, so I think y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there. The freeways with cars are y=1 to 8.\n\nIn the collision definition, it says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", and it says collision occurs only if on freeway y_T and 0 in span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, when I'm at y=0 or y=9, since there are no freeways there or no cars, I should be safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the starting and ending points, I think they are not freeways; freeways are from 1 to 8.\n\nThe grid has vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways are at y=1 to 8 for cars.\n\nSo at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, I start at (0,5), which is on freeway y=5? No, the position is (0,y), and x=0 is the point we care about for collision, since collision is when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nThe car spans are defined on the horizontal axis, I think. The freeway is a horizontal line at y=i, and cars are moving left or right on that line.\n\nThe position (0,y) means at x=0, y=vertical position.\n\nAt each turn, if I'm at y_t, and y_t is between 1 and 8, I need to ensure that at that turn, for freeway y_t, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nIf I move, I'm not on the new y until next turn.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t₁=21.\n\nFor each car, I need to find when 0 is in their span.\n\nFirst, for freeway k=1: cars: (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nDirection right, so they are moving right. Head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, I think, but in the update, for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)], and head h, tail τ.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: span at T: [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in span for the freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, for right-moving, if head is h and tail τ, with h > τ since moving right, I assume.\n\nIn the first car on k=1: (24,13,right,6) — head 24, tail 13? But 24 > 13, so moving right, tail at 13, head at 24? But usually we think tail to head, but here head is larger.\n\nIn the notation: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" which implies τ ≤ h, since [τ,h] with τ left, h right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ]\" with h left, τ right, so h ≤ τ.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFrom the text:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSince it moves left, both decrease.\n\nAnd [h, τ] with h ≤ τ, I think, because it's an interval.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], with τ ≤ h.\n\nIn the first car on k=1: (24,13,right,6)\n\nBut for right-moving, it says Span(t₁) = [τ, h], so here τ=13, h=24? But it says (head h, tail τ), and direction right.\n\nIn the state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right-moving, if d=right, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] with τ ≤ h.\n\nHere head h=24, tail τ=13, so τ=13, h=24, so Span(t₁) = [13,24] at turn t₁.\n\nSimilarly, the other car (-42,-53,right,6): head h=-42, tail τ=-53, so τ=-53, h=-42, so Span(t₁) = [-53, -42]? Since τ ≤ h.\n\n-53 < -42, so yes, [-53, -42].\n\nNow for k=1, both cars are right-moving, speed 6.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway and each car, when 0 is in their span at a given turn T.\n\nSince I start at turn t₁=21, and I consider turns from t=21 onwards.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t₁ = T - 21.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at turn T, 0 is in span if for some car, min_span ≤ 0 ≤ max_span.\n\nFirst, let's handle freeway 1.\n\nCars on freeway 1:\n\nCar A: (h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=6) so at T, span = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [13 + 6ΔT, 24 + 6ΔT]\n\nCar B: (h=-42, τ=-53, d=right, s=6) span = [-53 + 6ΔT, -42 + 6ΔT]\n\nNow, 0 in span for car A if 13 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 6ΔT\n\nSimilarly for car B: -53 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 6ΔT\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFor car A: 13 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 24 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 13 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6ΔT ≤ -13 ⇒ ΔT ≤ -13/6 ≈ -2.166, so ΔT ≤ -3 since ΔT integer? T is turn, so ΔT integer, I think.\n\nΔT = T - 21, integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ 24 + 6ΔT ⇒ 6ΔT ≥ -24 ⇒ ΔT ≥ -4\n\nSo for car A, 0 in span when ΔT ≥ -4 and ΔT ≤ -3? Let's see:\n\nFrom 13 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 6ΔT\n\nWhich means both: 13 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 24 + 6ΔT\n\nSo 13 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ ΔT ≤ -13/6 ≈ -2.166, so since ΔT integer, ΔT ≤ -3\n\nAnd 0 ≤ 24 + 6ΔT ⇒ 6ΔT ≥ -24 ⇒ ΔT ≥ -4\n\nSo for ΔT = -4, -3\n\nΔT = -4: 13 + 6*(-4) = 13-24= -11 ≤ 0, and 0 ≤ 24 + 6*(-4) = 24-24=0, 0≤0 true.\n\nΔT = -3: 13 + 6*(-3) = 13-18= -5 ≤0, 0 ≤ 24-18=6, 0≤6 true.\n\nΔT = -2: 13 + 6*(-2) =13-12=1 >0, so 1 ≤0 false, so 0 not ≤ left end, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT = -4 and -3.\n\nBut ΔT = T - 21, so for T=21, ΔT=0, which is not in -4,-3, so at T=21, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, for car B: -53 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst: -53 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6ΔT ≤ 53 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so ΔT ≤ 8\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -42 + 6ΔT ⇒ 42 ≤ 6ΔT ⇒ ΔT ≥ 7\n\nSo for ΔT=7,8\n\nΔT=7: -53 +42= -11 ≤0, 0 ≤ -42 +42=0, true\n\nΔT=8: -53+48= -5≤0, 0≤ -42+48=6, true\n\nΔT=9: -53+54=1>0, false\n\nSo car B occupies at ΔT=7,8, i.e., T=28,29.\n\nBut for now, at current turn, T=21, ΔT=0, freeway 1 is clear for car A and B, since not occupied.\n\nNow, for freeway 2, it says the same as freeway 1: (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6), so same cars? Or different cars but same parameters?\n\nIn the table, for k=2, it has the same: (24,13,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nBut since it's a different freeway, we treat separately.\n\nFor freeway 2, same as above, occupied at same times? But since same parameters, yes.\n\nFor k=2, car A: occupied at ΔT=-4,-3, T=17,18\n\nCar B: occupied at ΔT=7,8, T=28,29\n\nAt T=21, ΔT=0, not occupied.\n\nNow freeway 3: (-48,-95,right,48)\n\nRight-moving, head h=-48, tail τ=-95, so τ=-95, h=-48, span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-95 + 48ΔT, -48 + 48ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48ΔT\n\nFirst: -95 + 48ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 48ΔT ≤ 95 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so ΔT ≤ 1\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 48ΔT ⇒ 48ΔT ≥ 48 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 1\n\nSo ΔT=1, since integer.\n\nΔT=1: -95+48= -47 ≤0, 0 ≤ -48+48=0, true.\n\nΔT=0: -95 ≤0 true, but 0 ≤ -48? 0 ≤ -48 false, so not.\n\nΔT=1: both true.\n\nΔT=2: -95+96=1>0, false.\n\nSo only at ΔT=1, T=22.\n\nSo freeway 3 occupied at T=22.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same car? (-48,-95,right,48), same as k=3, so occupied only at T=22.\n\nNow freeway 5: (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=12)\n\nRight-moving, τ=-35, h=-24, span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-35 + 12ΔT, -24 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -35 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 12ΔT ≤ 35 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT ≤ 2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 + 12ΔT ⇒ 24 ≤ 12ΔT ⇒ ΔT ≥ 2\n\nSo ΔT=2: -35+24= -11 ≤0, 0 ≤ -24+24=0, true.\n\nΔT=3: -35+36=1>0, false.\n\nSo at ΔT=2, T=23.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12), head h=12, tail τ=1, d=right, so τ=1, h=12, span [1 + 12ΔT, 12 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 12ΔT\n\nFirst: 1 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 12ΔT ≤ -1 ⇒ ΔT ≤ -1/12, so ΔT ≤ 0? Since integer, ΔT ≤ -1\n\nΔT ≤ -1\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 12 + 12ΔT ⇒ -12 ≤ 12ΔT? 0 ≤ 12(1 + ΔT), since 12>0, 1 + ΔT ≥ 0, ΔT ≥ -1\n\nSo 0 in span when ΔT ≤ -1 and ΔT ≥ -1, so ΔT = -1\n\nAt ΔT=-1, T=20\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,12), head h=48, tail τ=37, d=right, τ=37, h=48, span [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12ΔT\n\nFirst: 37 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 12ΔT ≤ -37 ⇒ ΔT ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so ΔT ≤ -4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 48 + 12ΔT always true for ΔT ≥ 0, but for negative, 48 + 12ΔT could be negative if ΔT < -4, but second inequality 0 ≤ right end, which for ΔT ≥ -4, 48-48=0, etc., but first inequality requires left end ≤0.\n\nSo 37 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ ΔT ≤ -4 since -37/12≈-3.083, ΔT ≤ -4? 12*(-4)= -48, 37-48= -11 ≤0, 12*(-3)= -36, 37-36=1>0, so ΔT ≤ -4\n\nAnd second: 0 ≤ 48 + 12ΔT ⇒ 12ΔT ≥ -48 ⇒ ΔT ≥ -4\n\nSo ΔT ≥ -4 and ΔT ≤ -4, so ΔT= -4\n\nAt T=17\n\nFor freeway 5, occupied when:\n\n- First car at ΔT=2, T=23\n\n- Second car at ΔT=-1, T=20\n\n- Third car at ΔT=-4, T=17\n\nAt T=21, ΔT=0, not occupied, since none of these.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5, so occupied at same times: T=23 for first car, T=20 for second, T=17 for third.\n\nAt T=21, not occupied.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5 and 6? It says (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12), same as k=5 and k=6, so occupied at T=17,20,23 for each, but different freeways.\n\nFor k=7, occupied at T=23,20,17 respectively.\n\nAt T=21, not occupied.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-95,right,48), same as k=3 and k=4, so occupied at T=22.\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: occupied at T=17,18 (from car A, ΔT=-4,-3) and T=28,29 (car B, ΔT=7,8)\n\nBut T=17,18 are past, since now T=21, so for future, only T=28,29 dangerous for k=1.\n\nSimilarly, k=2 same, dangerous at T=28,29.\n\nk=3: occupied at T=22\n\nk=4: occupied at T=22\n\nk=5: occupied at T=23 (from first car), T=20 and T=17 past, so only T=23 dangerous.\n\nSimilarly k=6: T=23 dangerous.\n\nk=7: T=23 dangerous.\n\nk=8: T=22 dangerous.\n\nAlso, for k=1 and k=2, T=28,29 dangerous, but that might be later.\n\nNow, I start at y=5 at T=21.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways I need to cross are y=5,6,7,8 to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no freeway, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nNow, at each turn, I can be on a freeway only if I don't collide.\n\nSince I start at y=5 at T=21.\n\nAt T=21, what freeways are occupied? From above, at T=21:\n\nk=1: not occ\n\nk=2: not\n\nk=3: not (occ at T=22)\n\nk=4: not (occ at T=22)\n\nk=5: not (occ at T=23)\n\nk=6: not\n\nk=7: not\n\nk=8: not (occ at T=22)\n\nSo at T=21, all freeways are safe to be on.\n\nI am at y=5, which is freeway 5, but it's not occupied, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to move up to y=9.\n\nMinimum 4 moves up.\n\nBut I have to avoid the times when freeways are occupied.\n\nSpecifically, for y=5, it will be occupied at T=23.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at T=23, y=7 at T=23, y=8 at T=22.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, occupied at T=22.\n\ny=7 occupied at T=23.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous times per freeway:\n\ny=1: dangerous at T=28,29\n\ny=2: same, T=28,29\n\ny=3: T=22\n\ny=4: T=22\n\ny=5: T=23\n\ny=6: T=23\n\ny=7: T=23\n\ny=8: T=22\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow, since I start at T=21 at y=5.\n\nI can stay or move.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe direct path: go up each turn.\n\nTurn T=21: at y=5, safe.\n\nAction: U, to y=6 at T=22.\n\nAt T=22, I am on y=6? Let's see the sequence.\n\nTurn T=21: I am at position (0,5), I choose action a_{21}, which determines y_{22}.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_{22} = y_{21} +1 =6.\n\nAt turn T=22, I am on y=6.\n\nNow, at T=22, is y=6 occupied? y=6 is freeway 6, which is dangerous only at T=23, not at T=22, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=7 at T=23? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at T=21, I move to y=6 at T=22.\n\nThen at T=22, I choose action, say U, then y_{23} =7.\n\nAt T=23, I am on y=7.\n\nBut y=7 is dangerous at T=23, occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up again.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nOption 1: always up.\n\nTurn 21: at y=5, action U, to y=6 at turn 22.\n\nAt turn 22, I am on y=6. Now, y=6 is freeway 6, which is safe at T=22 (only dangerous at T=23). So no collision.\n\nThen action at turn 22: U, to y=7 at turn 23.\n\nAt turn 23, I am on y=7. But freeway y=7 is occupied at T=23, so collision! Not good.\n\nIf I do something else.\n\nAt turn 22, instead of U, I do S or D.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=7 is occupied at T=23, I should not be on y=7 at T=23.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6 also occupied at T=23, but y=5 at T=23 occupied, but I start from y=5 at T=21, and move away.\n\nIn this path, at T=23 I would be on y=7 if I go up twice.\n\nBut y=7 occupied at T=23.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=7 at T=23.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7 all occupied at T=23? y=5 at T=23, y=6 at T=23, y=7 at T=23.\n\ny=8 occupied at T=22.\n\nNow, at T=21, I am at y=5.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up to y=6 at T=22.\n\nThen at T=22, I am on y=6.\n\ny=6 is safe at T=22.\n\nNow, if I go up again to y=7 at T=23, but y=7 occupied at T=23, collision.\n\nIf I stay, y=7 at T=23? If I choose S at T=22, then y_{23} = y_{22} =6, so at T=23, I am on y=6, which is occupied at T=23, collision.\n\nIf I go down, to y=5 at T=23, then on y=5 at T=23, occupied, collision.\n\nSo at T=22, if I am on y=6, whatever I do, at T=23 I will be on y=5,6, or7, all occupied at T=23, so collision inevitable?\n\ny=5,6,7 all occupied at T=23.\n\ny=5: freeway 5 occupied T=23\n\ny=6: freeway 6 occupied T=23\n\ny=7: freeway 7 occupied T=23\n\nAnd y=8 occupied at T=22, but at T=23, y=8 might be safe? y=8 dangerous at T=22 only, I think.\n\nFor y=8, freeway 8, occupied only at T=22, as per earlier.\n\nAt T=23, y=8 should be safe, since only dangerous at T=22.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: dangerous at T=22, but at T=23 safe.\n\nBut I need to be on y=9.\n\nNow, back to T=22.\n\nIf at T=22 I am on y=6, I cannot go to y=7 at T=23 because occupied, cannot stay on y=6, cannot go down to y=5, all occupied at T=23.\n\nSo I must not be on y=6 at T=22? Or find a way to skip T=23.\n\nPerhaps start by not going up at first.\n\nAt T=21, instead of U, I could go down or stay.\n\nIf I go down to y=4 at T=22.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, dangerous at T=22.\n\nAt T=22, y=4 occupied, so if I am on y=4 at T=22, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=5 at T=22, but at T=22, I am on y=5? At turn T=22, position is y_{22}.\n\nIf at T=21 I choose S, then y_{22} = y_{21} =5, so at T=22 on y=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which is not occupied at T=22? Freeway 5 occupied at T=23, not T=22.\n\nAt T=22, y=5 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 occupied at T=22, y=3 at T=22, etc.\n\nList:\n\nAt T=22:\n\n- y=3 occupied\n\n- y=4 occupied\n\n- y=8 occupied\n\nOther y safe, including y=5,6,7.\n\ny=5: freeway 5 dangerous only T=23, so at T=22 safe.\n\ny=6: dangerous T=23, safe T=22.\n\ny=7: dangerous T=23, safe T=22.\n\ny=8: dangerous T=22, so occupied at T=22.\n\nAt T=23:\n\n- y=5 occupied\n\n- y=6 occupied\n\n- y=7 occupied\n\nOther safe.\n\nNow, back to actions.\n\nAt T=21, I am at y=5, safe.\n\nOption: choose S, stay at y=5 for T=22.\n\nThen at T=22, I am on y=5, which is safe (since not occupied at T=22).\n\nThen at T=22, I can choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, go to y=6 at T=23.\n\nBut at T=23, on y=6, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf I choose S, stay on y=5 at T=23, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I choose D, go to y=4 at T=23.\n\ny=4 at T=23: freeway 4 dangerous only at T=22, so at T=23 safe? Yes, not occupied.\n\nBut I need to go up, not down.\n\nBut to avoid collision, I could go down temporarily.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt T=22, on y=5, I choose D, to y=4 at T=23.\n\nThen at T=23, on y=4, which is safe, since only dangerous at T=22.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9 from there.\n\nBut y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps, so longer.\n\nBut I can go up later.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=5 until after T=23.\n\nBut at T=23, I cannot be on y=5,6,7.\n\nSo at T=23, I must be on y=4 or below, or y=8 or above.\n\ny=8: at T=23, y=8 safe, since dangerous only T=22.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4: at T=23, y=1 and y=2 dangerous at T=28,29, not now, so safe. y=3 dangerous at T=22, not T=23, safe. y=4 safe.\n\nSo at T=23, I can be on y=4 or below, or y=8 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is goal, but I need to reach it.\n\nNow, from start, at T=21, y=5.\n\nI need to be not on y=5,6,7 at T=23.\n\nT=23 is two turns from now.\n\nAt T=21, after action, I go to y_{22}.\n\nThen at T=22, after action, to y_{23}.\n\nI need y_{23} not in {5,6,7}.\n\nAlso, at T=22, I need to be safe, so y_{22} not occupied at T=22.\n\nOccupied at T=22: y=3,4,8.\n\nSo at T=22, I cannot be on y=3,4,8.\n\nMust be on y=1,2,5,6,7 or 0,9.\n\ny=0 and 9 safe, but y=0 is below.\n\nNow, from y=5 at T=21.\n\nIf I choose U at T=21, to y=6 at T=22.\n\nThen at T=22, on y=6, which is safe (not occupied).\n\nThen at T=22, I need to choose action so that y_{23} not in {5,6,7}.\n\nSo I can go to y=7, but y=7 is in {5,6,7}, not allowed, and also occupied.\n\nGo to y=5? But in {5,6,7}, occupied.\n\nGo to y=6? Same.\n\nOr go down to y=5? No.\n\ny_{23} must be not 5,6,7.\n\nSo from y=6 at T=22, I can choose D to y=5, but y=5 not allowed.\n\nChoose S to y=6, not allowed.\n\nChoose U to y=7, not allowed.\n\nSo no choice, all lead to y=5,6, or7 at T=23, all bad.\n\nThus, if I go to y=6 at T=22, I cannot avoid being on bad y at T=23.\n\nTherefore, I should not go to y=6 at T=22.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=5 at T=22, same issue, from y=5 at T=22, I can go to y=4,5,6 at T=23.\n\ny=4 is allowed, since not in {5,6,7}, and safe at T=23.\n\ny=5 and y=6 not allowed.\n\nSo I can choose to go down to y=4 at T=23.\n\nThen at T=23 on y=4, safe.\n\nThen I can proceed up.\n\nBut it takes extra turn.\n\nIf I go down at T=21.\n\nAt T=21, choose D, to y=4 at T=22.\n\nBut at T=22, y=4 is occupied, since freeway 4 dangerous at T=22.\n\nSo if I go to y=4 at T=22, collision at T=22.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I choose S at T=21, to y=5 at T=22, then as before, I can choose to go down to y=4 at T=23.\n\nBut at T=22 I am on y=5, safe.\n\nThen at T=22, choose D, to y=4 at T=23.\n\nAt T=23, on y=4, safe.\n\nNow, from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 to y=9, 5 steps.\n\nBut I can go up when safe.\n\nAt T=23, I am at y=4.\n\nNow, freeways: y=4 dangerous only at T=22, so at T=23 safe.\n\ny=5 dangerous at T=23, but I am at y=4.\n\nI can go up to y=5 at T=24.\n\nAt T=24, what is occupied?\n\nFirst, let's list dangerous times again for reference:\n\ny=1: T=28,29\n\ny=2: T=28,29\n\ny=3: T=22 only, so after safe\n\ny=4: T=22 only, safe after\n\ny=5: T=23 only\n\ny=6: T=23 only\n\ny=7: T=23 only\n\ny=8: T=22 only\n\nAfter T=23, all freeways are safe except y=1 and y=2 at T=28,29, but I may not be there at that time.\n\nAt T=23, I am at y=4.\n\nI can go up to y=5 at T=24.\n\nAt T=24, on y=5: freeway 5 dangerous only at T=23, so at T=24 safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=6 at T=25, y=7 at T=26, etc., all safe after T=23.\n\nBut y=8: dangerous only at T=22, so after safe.\n\nSo from T=24 onwards, all y safe except if I reach y=1 or 2 at T=28 or 29, but since I am going up from y=4, I should be at higher y by then.\n\nAt T=23, y=4\n\nT=24: go U to y=5\n\nT=25: U to y=6\n\nT=26: U to y=7\n\nT=27: U to y=8\n\nT=28: U to y=9\n\nNow, at T=28, on y=8: is it dangerous? y=8 dangerous at T=22 only, not at T=28, so safe.\n\nAnd y=9 safe.\n\nBut I reach at T=28, with action at T=27 to y=8? Let's see the turn.\n\nStart: T=21, y=5\n\nT=21: action S, to y=5 at T=22? No.\n\nIn this scenario:\n\nT=21: I choose S? Earlier I was at T=21, choose S to stay at y=5 for T=22.\n\nThen at T=22: choose D to go to y=4 at T=23.\n\nThen at T=23: at y=4, choose U to y=5 at T=24.\n\nT=24: at y=5, choose U to y=6 at T=25.\n\nT=25: at y=6, U to y=7 at T=26.\n\nT=26: at y=7, U to y=8 at T=27.\n\nT=27: at y=8, U to y=9 at T=28.\n\nAt T=28, y=9, which is goal.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nT=21: on y=5, safe\n\nT=22: on y=5, safe (not occ)\n\nT=23: on y=4, safe (not occ at T=23)\n\nT=24: on y=5, safe (after T=23)\n\nT=25: on y=6, safe\n\nT=26: on y=7, safe\n\nT=27: on y=8, safe\n\nT=28: on y=9, goal, no freeway.\n\nSo it works in 7 turns? From T=21 to T=28, that's 7 actions? Let's count turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=21 to t=27, 7 actions, reach at t=28.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe minimal H such that at turn t₁ + H -1, y=9.\n\nt₁=21.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁ + H, position is after H actions.\n\nDefine: at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nStart at turn t₁=21, position (0, y_{21}) = (0,5)\n\nAfter action a_{21}, y_{22} = y_{21} + Δy\n\nThen after a_{22}, y_{23}, and so on.\n\nWe reach when y_{t₁ + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t₁ + t for t=0 to H-1, actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t₁ + H, and y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nIn the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1 such that y_{t₁ + H -1} =9\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁ + H -1\n\nAfter these H actions, we are at turn t₁ + H, but the position is y_{t₁ + H -1} =9? Inconsistency.\n\nLet's see the player update.\n\n\"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\" so after action at t, position at t+1.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at next turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nt₁ + H -1 is the turn when we are at position (0,9).\n\nAnd actions from t=t₁ to t=t₁ + H -2? Let's see.\n\nSequence of actions for t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at times t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁ + H -1.\n\nAfter action at time s, position at s+1.\n\nSo after action at t₁ + H -1, position at (t₁ + H -1) +1 = t₁ + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t₁ + H -1 to be 9.\n\nTurn t₁ + H -1, position y_{t₁ + H -1}.\n\nTo have y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, we need to have chosen actions such that we arrive there.\n\ny_{t₁ + H -1} depends on previous actions.\n\nFor example, at turn t₁, we are at y_{t₁}, then action a_{t₁} determines y_{t₁ +1}.\n\nThen action a_{t₁ +1} determines y_{t₁ +2}, and so on.\n\nSo y_{t₁ + H -1} is determined by actions from a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -2}.\n\nThen action a_{t₁ + H -1} is chosen, but it determines y_{t₁ + H}, which is after.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁ + H -1.\n\nBut action at time t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nSo for y_{t₁ + H -1}, it is set by action at t₁ + H -2.\n\nAnd action at t₁ + H -1 affects y_{t₁ + H}, which is not the position we care about for the goal.\n\nThe sequence of actions includes a_{t₁ + H -1}, which is the last action before reaching, but it might not be needed if we are already at 9.\n\nBut in this case, we start at 5, need to reach 9, so actions are needed.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that after H actions, we have moved H steps in time.\n\nStart at turn t₁, position y_{t₁}.\n\nAfter first action a_{t₁}, at turn t₁+1, position y_{t₁+1}.\n\nAfter second action a_{t₁+1}, at turn t₁+2, position y_{t₁+2}.\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th action, at turn t₁+k, position y_{t₁+k}.\n\nWe want that at some turn T, y_T =9, with T = t₁ + H -1 for some H.\n\nAnd the actions from a_{t₁} to a_{T-1} to reach from y_{t₁} to y_T.\n\nNumber of actions is (T - t₁).\n\nSince from turn t₁ to turn T, there are (T - t₁) actions: a_{t₁} to a_{T-1}.\n\nThen y_T is set.\n\nAnd T = t₁ + H -1, so H -1 = T - t₁, thus number of actions is H-1? Messy.\n\nFrom the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\"\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nTo have that, the actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} determine y_{t_1 + H -1}, and a_{t_1 + H -1} is chosen but doesn't affect y_{t_1 + H -1}, it affects y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSo for the position at turn s, it is determined by actions up to a_{s-1}.\n\nSo for y_{t_1 + H -1} to be 9, it is determined by actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nThen the action a_{t_1 + H -1} is extra, but it is part of the sequence for t=0 to H-1.\n\nPerhaps in the context, the action at time t is chosen when at turn t, and it moves to y_{t+1}.\n\nBut the goal is to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for that, we need to arrive at that turn.\n\nThe action at t_1 + H -1 might be to stay or something, but since we are already at 9, it could be S.\n\nBut in this case, since we start at 5, we need to move.\n\nTo minimize H, we want the smallest H such that we can be at 9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nNumber of turns from start to end is H, but the turn indices.\n\nSet t_1 = 21.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T, and T = 21 + H -1 = 20 + H.\n\nH is min such that we can reach at turn 20 + H.\n\nThe number of actions is the number of steps from turn 21 to turn 20+H, which is (20+H - 21) +1 = H actions? From turn 21 to turn T, there are T-21 actions to reach y_T.\n\nT = 20 + H, so T - 21 = H -1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions from t=0 to H-1, so for times 21 to 21+H-1, H actions.\n\nThen y_{21 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if I can reach at turn 21, but y=5, not 9, so H must be at least such that 21 + H -1 >=21, and y=9.\n\nMin H if I go directly up: from y=5 at t=21, action U at t=21, to y=6 at t=22.\n\nU at t=22, to y=7 at t=23.\n\nU at t=23, to y=8 at t=24.\n\nU at t=24, to y=9 at t=25.\n\nSo at turn t=25, y=9.\n\nt=25 = 21 + 4, so 21 + H -1 =25, thus H-1=4, H=5.\n\nActions at t=21,22,23,24.\n\nSequence: a_{21} to a_{24}, 4 actions.\n\nThen y_{25}=9.\n\nWith H=5, actions from t=0 to 4, i.e., t=21 to 25? t from 0 to H-1=4, so t=21,22,23,24, actions.\n\nPosition at turn t_{21 + H -1} = t_{21+5-1}=t_{25}, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIn this case, at t=23, we are at y=7, which is occupied, collision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I had a longer path.\n\nBut I want minimal H.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by avoiding the bad times.\n\nFor example, at t=21, I go up to y=6 at t=22.\n\nThen at t=22, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nInstead of going up, I can go down or stay, but as before, I will be on bad y at t=23.\n\nUnless I can be on y=8 or y=4 at t=23.\n\nBut from y=6 at t=22, I can go down to y=5 at t=23, bad; or to y=7 at t=23, bad; or stay y=6, bad.\n\nNo way to y=8 or y=4 directly.\n\nFrom y=6, I can only go to 5,6,7.\n\nAll bad at t=23.\n\nSimilarly, from other positions.\n\nSo at t=22, I cannot be on y=6 if I want to avoid t=23 collision on 5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=22 I am on y=5, I can go to y=4 at t=23.\n\ny=4 is good at t=23.\n\nOr if on y=7 at t=22, I can go to y=8 at t=23.\n\ny=8 at t=23 is safe.\n\nBut how to be on y=7 at t=22?\n\nAt t=21, if I go up, to y=6 at t=22, not y=7.\n\nIf I go up from y=5 at t=21, to y=6 at t=22.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=22, I need to have been at y=6 or 7 or 8 at t=21, but at t=21 I am at y=5, so I can only reach y=6 at t=22.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 at t=22.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=22, impossible from y=5 in one step.\n\nSo at t=22, the only safe positions are y=1,2,5,6,7 (since y=3,4,8 occupied).\n\nAnd from there, for t=23, I need to be not on 5,6,7.\n\nSo from y=1,2,5,6,7 at t=22, I can go to:\n\n- From y=1: to y=0,1,2 at t=23\n\n- y=2: to y=1,2,3 at t=23\n\n- y=5: to y=4,5,6 at t=23\n\n- y=6: to y=5,6,7 at t=23\n\n- y=7: to y=6,7,8 at t=23\n\nNow at t=23, I need to be on y=4 or below or y=8 or 9.\n\nSo:\n\n- If from y=1 at t=22, go to y=0,1,2: all <=2, ok, not 5,6,7\n\n- From y=2, go to y=1,2,3: y=3 is not 5,6,7, and at t=23, y=3 safe, so ok\n\n- From y=5, go to y=4: y=4 not 5,6,7, ok\n\n- From y=6, go to y=5,6,7 all bad, or if I go down to y=5, bad, etc, no good choice, as before\n\n- From y=7, go to y=8: y=8 not 5,6,7, and safe at t=23, so ok.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=22, I need to have been there at t=21, but I was at y=5.\n\nSo only possible if I start from y=5 at t=21, I can be at y=5 or y=6 at t=22.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=22, I can go to y=4 at t=23.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=22, I cannot go to a good position at t=23.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at y=5 at t=22, then go to y=4 at t=23.\n\nOr, if I can be at y=7 at t=22, but I can't.\n\nSo the safe choice is to stay at y=5 at t=21 (action S), so at t=22 on y=5.\n\nThen action D at t=22, to y=4 at t=23.\n\nAt t=23 on y=4, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up directly.\n\nBut as before, it takes time.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nFor example, after being on y=4 at t=23, I go up.\n\nAt t=23, y=4.\n\nAction U at t=23, to y=5 at t=24.\n\nAt t=24, y=5, safe.\n\nU to y=6 at t=25.\n\ny=6 at t=25, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at t=26.\n\ny=7 at t=26, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at t=27.\n\ny=8 at t=27, safe.\n\nU to y=9 at t=28.\n\nAt t=28, y=9.\n\nNow, actions: from t=21 to t=27.\n\nActions at t=21: S (stay at y=5 for t=22)\n\nt=22: D (to y=4 at t=23)\n\nt=23: U (to y=5 at t=24)\n\nt=24: U (to y=6 at t=25)\n\nt=25: U (to y=7 at t=26)\n\nt=26: U (to y=8 at t=27)\n\nt=27: U (to y=9 at t=28)\n\nThen at turn t=28, y=9.\n\nt=28 = 21 + 7, so 21 + H -1 =28, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions from t=21 to t=27, 7 actions.\n\nBut we can reach earlier?\n\nAt t=23, I am at y=4.\n\nInstead of going directly up, since all freeways are safe after t=23 except the far future, but I can go faster.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=23, I can go U to y=5 at t=24.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t=25.\n\nBut I can do multiple up, but each action changes y by at most 1, so I need 5 steps from y=4 to y=9: to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo at least 5 actions from t=23 onwards.\n\nStart from t=23 at y=4, after first action U at t=23, to y=5 at t=24.\n\nAfter second U at t=24, to y=6 at t=25.\n\nThird U at t=25, to y=7 at t=26.\n\nFourth U at t=26, to y=8 at t=27.\n\nFifth U at t=27, to y=9 at t=28.\n\nSo reach at t=28.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so minimum 5 turns from y=4.\n\nBut I was at y=5 at t=21, and I wasted two turns to go to y=4 at t=23 instead of going up.\n\nBut I couldn't go up directly because of t=23.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 directly or something.\n\nAnother idea: at t=21, I go up to y=6 at t=22.\n\nThen at t=22, instead of staying or down, I go up, but to y=7 at t=23, bad.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr, I can go to a different y at t=22.\n\nBut from y=6, I can only go to 5,6,7.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps at t=21, I go down to y=4, but at t=22, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo the only way is to stay at y=5 at t=21 and t=22, then down to y=4 at t=23.\n\nBut at t=22, I am on y=5, which is safe.\n\nThen down to y=4 at t=23.\n\nBut at t=23, y=4 is safe.\n\nThen up.\n\nBut to reach faster, I could from y=4 go up, but I need to be careful of y=8 or something, but y=8 is only dangerous at t=22, so after safe.\n\nAnother point: at t=22, when I am on y=5, instead of going down, I could go up to y=6, but then at t=23 on y=6, bad.\n\nNo.\n\nOr, I could stay at y=5 for multiple turns, but at t=23, I have to move away.\n\nBut in the down move, I go to y=4.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 earlier.\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=7 at t=22, then go to y=8 at t=23.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=22, I need to have been at y=6 or 7 at t=21, but I was at y=5, so impossible.\n\nUnless I move up faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=7 at t=22.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is to go down to y=4 at t=23.\n\nThen from there, up to y=9 at t=28.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nStart t=21, y=5\n\nAction a_{21} = S, so y_{22} =5\n\nAt t=22, on y=5, action a_{22} = D, so y_{23} =4\n\nAt t=23, on y=4, action a_{23} = U, y_{24}=5\n\na_{24}=U, y_{25}=6\n\na_{25}=U, y_{26}=7\n\na_{26}=U, y_{27}=8\n\na_{27}=U, y_{28}=9\n\nNow, we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{21 + H -1} =9\n\nAt t=28, y=9, so 21 + H -1 =28, thus 20 + H =28, H=8.\n\nActions from t=21 to t=27, which is 7 actions, but t from 0 to H-1=7, so t=21 to 27, 7 actions? H=8, t=0 to 7, times t=21 to 28? Let's index.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so for H=8, t=0 to 7, actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to7, so times 21,22,23,24,25,26,27.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{21+8-1}=y_{28}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a way with less than 8?\n\nH=8, but min possible if no cars is 5, but with cars, I have to detour.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 directly faster.\n\nAnother idea: at t=21, I go up to y=6 at t=22.\n\nThen at t=22, I go up to y=7 at t=23, but collision at t=23 on y=7.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr at t=22, I go down to y=5 at t=23, collision.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can wait at y=5 for one turn, then at t=22 on y=5, go up to y=6 at t=23, but at t=23 on y=6 occupied.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo no, I must leave the y=5,6,7 area by t=23.\n\nBy going down to y=4.\n\nThen come back.\n\nBut y=4 to y=9 is 5 steps, from t=23 to t=28, but I started at t=21, so from t=21 to t=28, 7 actions to reach at t=28.\n\nActions at t=21 to t=27, 7 actions, H=8.\n\nPerhaps at t=23, when at y=4, I can go to y=5 immediately at t=24, but y=5 is safe at t=24.\n\nBut I need to move step by step.\n\nUnless I can skip, but no.\n\nAnother thought: after t=23, all freeways are safe, so I can go directly up as fast as possible.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=23, to y=9 at t=28, min 5 actions.\n\nAnd before, from t=21 to t=23, I have two actions: S and D, to get to y=4 at t=23.\n\nSo total 7 actions for 7 steps, reach at turn 28.\n\nBut is there a way to be at a higher position at t=23?\n\nFor example, at t=21, if I go up to y=6 at t=22.\n\nThen at t=22, I go down to y=5, but at t=23 on y=5 bad.\n\nOr, I could go to y=8 directly, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps from y=5 at t=21, I go down to y=4 at t=22, but at t=22, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think the only way is to stay at y=5 for t=22, then down to y=4 for t=23.\n\nThen up.\n\nBut let's check if I can be at y=3 or something, but that might be worse.\n\nFor example, at t=22, if I am on y=5, I could go down to y=4 at t=23, or to other, but y=4 is fine.\n\ny=3 at t=23 is safe, but lower, so takes more time to go up.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo y=4 is the best.\n\nPerhaps at t=21, I go down to y=4 at t=22, but collision at t=22.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think H=8 is the minimum.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, actions:\n\nTurn 21: S (since stay at y=5 for next turn)\n\nIn the action, at turn t, a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo for turn 21: a_{21} = S, so y_{22} = y_{21} + 0 =5\n\nTurn 22: a_{22} = D, so y_{23} = y_{22} -1 =4\n\nTurn 23: a_{23} = U, y_{24} =5\n\nTurn 24: a_{24} = U, y_{25} =6\n\nTurn 25: a_{25} = U, y_{26} =7\n\nTurn 26: a_{26} = U, y_{27} =8\n\nTurn 27: a_{27} = U, y_{28} =9\n\nNow, y_{28} =9, and t_{21 + H -1} = t_{20 + H} =28, so 20+H=28, H=8.\n\nActions at turns 21 to 27, which is 7 actions, but for H=8, actions from t=0 to 7, times 21 to 28? t from 0 to H-1=7, so actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to7, t=21 to 28.\n\nBut at turn 28, action a_{28} is not needed, since we are already at y_{28}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 28, if we include a_{28}, it could be S or something, but in the goal, y_{28} is already 9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which for H=8, a_{21+7}=a_{28}, which affects y_{29}, but we don't care.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to specify actions until we reach, but since at turn t_1 + H -1 we are at position, and we might have an action there.\n\nBut in this case, to have y_{28}=9, we need actions up to a_{27}, which sets y_{28}.\n\nThen a_{28} is extra.\n\nBut the sequence requires actions from t=0 to H-1, so for H=8, actions at 21 to 28.\n\nBut at turn 28, we are at y_{28}=9, so we can choose a_{28}=S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, in the direct path, if possible, we would have actions including the last one.\n\nBut here, since we reach at t=28, we can have a_{28}=S.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's fine.\n\nTo minimize H, perhaps we can reach earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is safe at t=23, if I can be at y=8 at t=23.\n\nBut from y=5 at t=21, I can only reach y=7 at t=23 max.\n\nAt t=21, U to y=6 at t=22\n\nAt t=22, U to y=7 at t=23\n\nBut at t=23 on y=7, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I go U at t=21 to y=6, then at t=22 U to y=7, but collision.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can use the fact that at t=22, y=8 is occupied, but if I am not on it.\n\nI think I have to accept H=8.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach at t=27.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 at t=26 or something.\n\nStart t=21 y=5\n\nSuppose I go U at t=21 to y=6 at t=22\n\nThen at t=22, I have to avoid, but I can only go to y=5,6,7 at t=23, all bad.\n\nSo I must not go to y=6 at t=22.\n\nIf I stay at y=5 at t=22, then at t=23 I must go to y=4 or lower.\n\nBut y=4 at t=23.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=23, go U to y=5 at t=24, etc., to y=8 at t=27, y=9 at t=28.\n\nCan I be at y=8 at t=27? Yes, as above.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=27, I need to be at y=8 at t=26, so that action U at t=26 to y=9 at t=27.\n\nBut at t=26, if I am at y=8, how?\n\nFrom y=4 at t=23, to y=5 t=24, y=6 t=25, y=7 t=26, then y=8 at t=27.\n\nSo at t=26, y=7, not y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=26, I need to be at y=7 or 8 or 9 at t=25, but from start, with detour, at t=25 I am at y=6 in the sequence.\n\ny=6 at t=25.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=26, y=8 at t=27.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nUnless I start higher, but no.\n\nSo I think H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states for other y, but I think I covered.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 from y=8 earlier, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the cars on y=1 and y=2 at T=28,29, but since I am at y=8 or 9 at that time, no issue.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=28 I am at y=9, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 8.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: D\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nAnd since H=8, we need action at turn 28, but at turn 28, we are at y=9, so we can choose S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, action at turn 28 is included, a_{28}.\n\nBut it doesn't affect the position, since we already reached.\n\nBut for the answer, we need to specify.\n\nPerhaps we can have fewer actions if we don't include the extra, but the problem requires the sequence for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn this case, with actions up to turn 27, we reach at turn 28.\n\nBut for H=8, we include a_{28}.\n\nBut y_{28} is set by a_{27}, so at turn 28, we are at y_{28}, then we choose a_{28}, which is for y_{29}, but we don't care.\n\nSo we can set a_{28} to S or anything.\n\nSimilarly, in the answer format.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: D\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: S  (since we are at y=9)\n\nBut H=8, actions from t=21 to 28.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's see if I can have H smaller.\n\nSuppose I go up at t=21 to y=6 at t=22.\n\nThen at t=22, I go down to y=5 at t=23, but collision at t=23 on y=5.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr, perhaps I can be on y=8 at t=22, but impossible.\n\nI think it's not possible.\n\nSo minimal H is 8.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about the cars, but for y=1 and 2, dangerous at t=28,29, but in my sequence, at t=28 I am at y=9, not on freeway, so ok.\n\nIf I were on y=1 or 2 at t=28, collision, but I am not.\n\nSo fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: D\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nBut for turn 28, action S, but since y=9, and we stay, but it's fine.\n\nTo save an action, but I think H=8 is min.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t=27.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{20+H} =9.\n\nSet 20+H=27, H=7.\n\nThen y_{27}=9.\n\nThen actions from t=21 to t=26? For H=7, actions a_{21} to a_{21+6}=a_{27}, but a_{27} determines y_{28}, not y_{27}.\n\nTo have y_{27}=9, it must be set by a_{26}, so actions from a_{21} to a_{26}.\n\nThen for H=7, actions t=0 to 6, times 21 to 26, 6 actions.\n\nThen y_{21+7-1}=y_{27}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo if I can reach y=9 at t=27.\n\nThat means from y=5 at t=21, in 6 actions to y=9 at t=27.\n\nBut with detour, I have y=4 at t=23, then to y=9 at t=28, which is later.\n\nCan I reach y=9 at t=27?\n\nFor example, at t=27, y=9.\n\nSet by action at t=26, from y=8 at t=26.\n\nSo need y=8 at t=26.\n\nHow to get to y=8 at t=26 from start.\n\nt=21 y=5\n\nt=22: need to be somewhere\n\nt=23: position\n\nBut at t=23, I must not be on y=5,6,7.\n\nSuppose at t=23, I am on y=8.\n\nThen from y=5 at t=21, how to be at y=8 at t=23.\n\nIn two actions: from t=21 to t=22, and t=22 to t=23.\n\nFirst action U to y=6 at t=22.\n\nThen from y=6, U to y=7 at t=23, or D to y=5, or S to y=6.\n\nCannot reach y=8.\n\nMax y=7 at t=23.\n\nBut y=7 occupied at t=23, collision.\n\nIf I go to y=4 at t=23, as before.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=23, to y=8 at t=26: need 4 steps: to y=5 t=24, y=6 t=25, y=7 t=26, then to y=8 t=27.\n\nSo at t=26, y=7, not y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=26, I need to be at y=7 or 8 at t=25.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=23, to y=5 t=24, then to y=6 t=25, or if I go faster, but I can only one step, so y=6 at t=25 max from there.\n\nThen y=7 at t=26.\n\nCannot be at y=8 at t=26.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach before t=28.\n\nThus, minimal H is 8.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 28, action S, but since we reached, it's fine.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but the format requires H actions including until t1+H-1.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps I can have a different path where I reach at t=27 with more moves, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, if at t=21 I go down, but collision at t=22.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 21\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8. This means the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 21 + 8 - 1 = 28\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is determined by considering the car positions and their dangerous times (when a car's span includes x=0 on the respective freeway). The dangerous times for each freeway are:\n\n- Freeway 1: Occupied at turns 28 and 29 (from future car movements).\n- Freeway 2: Occupied at turns 28 and 29.\n- Freeway 3: Occupied at turn 22.\n- Freeway 4: Occupied at turn 22.\n- Freeway 5: Occupied at turn 23.\n- Freeway 6: Occupied at turn 23.\n- Freeway 7: Occupied at turn 23.\n- Freeway 8: Occupied at turn 22.\n\nAt turn 21, the player is at y=5, which is safe. Moving up immediately leads to collision at turn 23 on y=7 (or y=5 or y=6), as these freeways are occupied. Therefore, the player must avoid being on y=5, 6, or 7 at turn 23. The only safe option is to stay at y=5 at turn 22 (by choosing S at turn 21) and then move down to y=4 at turn 23 (by choosing D at turn 22). At turn 23, y=4 is safe. From turn 23 onward, all freeways are safe except for y=1 and y=2 at turns 28 and 29, but the player will be at higher y values by then. The player then moves up consecutively to reach y=9 by turn 28.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n- Turn 21: S (stay at y=5 for turn 22).\n- Turn 22: D (move to y=4 for turn 23).\n- Turn 23: U (move to y=5 for turn 24).\n- Turn 24: U (move to y=6 for turn 25).\n- Turn 25: U (move to y=7 for turn 26).\n- Turn 26: U (move to y=8 for turn 27).\n- Turn 27: U (move to y=9 for turn 28).\n- Turn 28: S (stay at y=9, as the goal is reached).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches the goal in the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

Therefore, when we move (U or D), during the turn we are still on the original row until the next turn.\n\nWe are starting at y=5 at turn t1=22.\n\nWe must avoid the freeways 1 to 8 when we are on them and a car is covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 22 to turn 22+H-1, such that at the last turn we are at y=9.\n\nNote: The goal is (0,9). Since the horizontal position is always 0, we only care about the y-coordinate.\n\nWe are given the car configurations at turn t1=22 for each freeway (rows 1 to 8). The cars are described by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the direction: \n  right: the car moves to the right, so the span at time T is [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]? \nBut note the representation:\n\nFor a right-moving car at time t1: \n  Span(t1) = [τ, h]   (so tail τ and head h, with τ < h because the car extends from τ to h)\nThen at time T (T>t1): \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nFor left-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [h, τ]   (but note: in the example, h is the head and τ the tail, and the car moves left so the entire car moves left. But the representation in the problem for left-moving is [h, τ] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nHowever, in the given state, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (30,19,right,6) -> but note: 30>19, so for right-moving, the head is at 30 and tail at 19? Then the span at t1 is [19,30]? But the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] -> so τ=19, h=30? Then at time T: [19+6*(T-22), 30+6*(T-22)]\n\nBut wait, there's a second car: (-36,-47,right,6) -> then τ=-47, h=-36? So at t1: [-47, -36] and then at T: [-47+6*(T-22), -36+6*(T-22)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: (0,-47,right,48) -> [ -47, 0] at t1? Then at T: [-47+48*(T-22), 0+48*(T-22)]\n\nBut note: we care when the car covers x=0. So we need to check for each freeway we are on at a given turn, if at that turn the car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are only on a freeway when our y is between 1 and 8. At y=0 and y=9, there are no cars.\n\nPlan:\nWe are at (0,5) at turn 22. We can move U, D, or S.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 4 moves (UUUU from 5 to 9). But we must avoid the freeways when a car is at 0.\n\nSo we must simulate the positions and check for collisions for each possible action sequence.\n\nHowever, we can use a BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (turn, y) to find the minimal H.\n\nBut note: the turn number matters because the car positions change over time.\n\nThe state: (t, y) at turn t (starting from t0=22) and y in {0,1,...,9}. We start at (22,5) and we want to reach any state (t,9) for the first time.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. Note that U and D change the y by 1 (if not at boundary), and S leaves it.\n\nThe transition: \n  If we are at (t, y) and take action a:\n      if a=U and y<9 -> next y = y+1\n      if a=D and y>0 -> next y = y-1\n      else: next y = y\n\nBut note: the collision check is at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the problem states: collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn T the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway.\n\nImportant: The player is at (0, y_t) at turn t. And the collision condition is checked at turn t: so we are on freeway y_t (if 1<=y_t<=8) and then we check the cars on that freeway at turn t.\n\nTherefore, when we are at state (t, y), we must check if y is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on freeway y at turn t (relative to t1=22) to see if any car covers 0.\n\nBut note: the car positions are defined relative to t1=22. So for a given freeway k and a given turn t (which is t1 + delta, with delta = t - 22), we can compute the car spans.\n\nHow to check for a car on freeway k at turn t (t>=22) for a right-moving car (h,τ,d,s) given at t1=22? \n  At time t: the head becomes h + s*(t-22) and the tail becomes τ + s*(t-22). Then the span is [τ + s*(t-22), h + s*(t-22)] (for right-moving).\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo we need to check if 0 is in [τ + s*(t-22), h + s*(t-22)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but in our problem all cars are right-moving? Let me check the table:\n\nAll directions are \"right\". So no left-moving cars.\n\nSo for each car on freeway k: \n  condition: τ + s*(t-22) <= 0 <= h + s*(t-22)\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, we have τ (tail) and head h, and since the car moves right, the tail is the leftmost? Actually, the problem states for right-moving: [τ, h] at t1, and then [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at T. So the entire car moves to the right. Therefore, at time T, the car covers [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the tail τ and head h: at t1, the car is from τ to h (with τ <= h). Then at T, it is from τ+s*(T-t1) to h+s*(T-t1).\n\nSo condition: τ + s*(t-22) <= 0 <= h + s*(t-22)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T)\". So we must avoid that.\n\nWe are safe at y=0 and y=9 (since no freeway for y=0 and y=9? Actually, the freeways are from y=1 to 8).\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\nWe will do a BFS (or Dijkstra since all steps cost 1) over the state (t, y). The state is (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 22 and increasing) and y in [0,9]. We start at (22,5) and we want to reach any state with y=9.\n\nThe cost is the number of turns (t - 22). We want the minimal t such that we can be at y=9.\n\nBut note: the turn count H is the number of actions we take, so from turn 22 to turn 22+H-1, we take H actions. The last state is at turn (22+H-1) and we require that at that turn we are at y=9.\n\nSo we are looking for the minimal H such that at turn (22+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  Let time = t - 22 (so delta from 0). Then we start at delta=0, y=5.\n\n  We want to find a sequence of actions for delta=0 to delta=H-1 (so H actions) such that at the last state (delta=H-1) we have y=9.\n\nBut note: at each step we take an action, then we go to the next state (delta+1, y').\n\nAt each state (delta, y) (which corresponds to turn t=22+delta), we must check if we are on a freeway (1<=y<=8) and then if there is any car on that freeway that has 0 in its span at turn t=22+delta.\n\nHow to compute the span for a car at freeway y at time t=22+delta?\n\n  For each car on freeway y (as given at t1=22) with (head h, tail τ, direction, speed s) [all right]:\n      low = τ + s * delta\n      high = h + s * delta\n      Check if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nIf any car on the freeway y has this condition, then we have a collision -> this state is invalid.\n\nIf y is 0 or 9, then no car -> safe.\n\nWe must avoid invalid states.\n\nWe'll do BFS:\n\n  Queue: (delta, y, path) \n  We start at (0,5, [])\n\n  Then we expand by trying U, D, S (if applicable) to next state (delta+1, y', path + [action])\n\n  We mark visited states? But note: we might have same y at different delta and we might need to revisit if we take a different path? However, because the car positions change over time, a state (y, delta) is unique. But also, we might have the same (y, delta) by different paths? Then we don't need to revisit because the future only depends on delta and y.\n\n  So we can mark visited (delta, y).\n\n  We stop when we get to a state (delta, 9). Then H = delta+1? \n\n  Explanation: \n      We start at delta=0 (turn 22). We take H actions: from delta=0 to delta=H-1 (so H steps). At the last action (at delta=H-1) we are at y=9.\n\n  Therefore, the total number of turns we use is H (from turn 22 to turn 22+H-1, inclusive? Actually, at turn 22 we are at the start. Then we take H actions: at turn 22 we take the first action (so we are at state (22,5) and we take an action that leads to turn 23, then ... until we take the last action at turn 22+H-1 which leads to turn 22+H, but we don't require that state?).\n\n  Actually, the problem says: we are at turn t1=22. We take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). So at turn t1+H-1 (which is 22+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\n  Therefore, in our BFS, we are looking for the minimal H such that at state (delta=H-1, y=9).\n\n  We start at delta=0, y=5. We want to reach (delta,9) with minimal delta? Then H = delta+1.\n\n  Example: if we start at delta=0, y=5. Then we take an action at delta=0 to go to delta=1, y=6. Then at delta=1, we are at y=6. Then we take another action at delta=1 to go to delta=2, y=7. Then at delta=2, y=8. Then at delta=3, y=9. Then we stop. So H=4 (actions at delta=0,1,2,3) and at delta=3 (which is H-1=3) we are at y=9. So H=4.\n\n  Therefore, in our BFS we are looking for the minimal delta_min such that we can be at (delta_min, 9). Then H = delta_min+1.\n\n  The sequence of actions is the path from (0,5) to (delta_min,9).\n\nBut note: we must check the starting state: at (0,5) (delta=0, y=5). We are at freeway 5? Yes, because y=5 (which is between 1 and 8). So we must check if at turn 22 (delta=0) there is a car on freeway 5 that covers 0.\n\nFreeway 5: cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nWait, note: the representation for the cars: (head, tail, ...) but the problem says for right-moving: the span is [τ, h] at t1. So for the first car: head=-12, tail=-23? Then at t1=22 (delta=0): \n  car1: [τ, h] = [-23, -12] -> so from -23 to -12. Then 0 is not in [-23,-12]? because 0 is greater than -12? Actually, -23 <= 0 <= -12? -> no, because 0 > -12? \n\nBut note: the problem says: [τ, h] meaning from τ to h. So if τ < h, then it's [τ, h] and 0 is in between if τ<=0<=h.\n\nFor car1: τ=-23, h=-12 -> then -23<=0<=-12? -> 0 is not in [-23,-12] because 0 is greater than -12? Actually, -23 <= -12, so the interval is from -23 to -12, which is negative. So 0 is not in that interval.\n\nSimilarly, car2: (24,13,right,12) -> wait, 24 and 13: but 24>13, so τ=13, h=24? Then [13,24] at t1? 0 is not in [13,24].\n\ncar3: (60,49,right,12) -> τ=49, h=60? [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 22, freeway 5 is safe.\n\nSo we start at (0,5) and it's safe.\n\nNow, let's try to simulate the cars for a few turns.\n\nWe are going to do BFS. We'll try to go up as fast as possible, but we might have to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nWe'll generate states (delta, y) and check for collisions at that state.\n\nWe'll consider the actions: U, D, S.\n\nWe note that we can only move up to 9 and down to 0.\n\nWe'll keep a visited set for (delta, y) to avoid duplicates.\n\nWe are interested in the minimal delta that reaches y=9.\n\nBut note: the cars move with time, so the collisions change.\n\nWe'll write a function to check collision for a given freeway k (which is y) and a given delta (time passed from t1=22):\n\n  For each car on freeway k (from the table) with (h, τ, d, s) [all d='right']:\n      low = τ + s * delta\n      high = h + s * delta\n      if low <= 0 <= high: then collision -> return True.\n\n  If no car covers 0, then safe -> return False.\n\nBut note: the table gives multiple cars per freeway.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (h1=30, τ1=19, right,6) and (h2=-36, τ2=-47, right,6)\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: (30,19,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\nFreeway 3: one car: (0,-47,right,48)\nFreeway 4: same as freeway3: (0,-47,right,48)\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12) -> but note: the representation: the problem says (head, tail). So for the second car: head=24, tail=13? Then the car is from 13 to 24? But wait, the problem says for right: [τ, h] meaning from τ to h. But 13<24, so that's consistent. However, note the second car: (24,13,...) -> we have to interpret as head=24, tail=13? Then the car is [13,24] at t1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ)\" and then for right: [τ, h]. So we use τ and h as given.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: same as freeway5.\nFreeway7: same as freeway5.\nFreeway8: same as freeway3: (0,-47,right,48)\n\nNow, let's check freeway 5 at delta=0: \n  car1: τ=-23, h=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n  car2: τ=13, h=24 -> [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n  car3: τ=49, h=60 -> [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nNow, let's try to go up:\n\nWe start at (0,5). Then we can try U -> (1,6), D -> (1,4), S -> (1,5).\n\nWe must check each:\n\nAt (1,6): freeway 6 at delta=1.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5: three cars: (-12,-23,12), (24,13,12), (60,49,12) -> but wait, the table says freeway6: same as freeway5? Actually, the table says:\n\n| 5 | (-12, -23, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12), (60, 49, right, 12) |\n| 6 | same? Actually, the table says: \n| 6 | (-12, -23, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12), (60, 49, right, 12) |\n\nSo for freeway6 at delta=1:\n\n  car1: τ=-23, h=-12 -> becomes: τ + s*1 = -23+12 = -11, h + s*1 = -12+12=0 -> so the car becomes [-11, 0]? \n      Then 0 is included? Because the condition: -11<=0<=0 -> yes, 0 is in [ -11, 0 ].\n\n  So at delta=1, freeway6 has a car that covers 0? \n\n  But wait: the head and tail: the problem says (head, tail) and for right: [τ, h] at t1. Then at time T: [τ+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)].\n\n  So for the first car on freeway6: \n      τ = -23, h = -12? Then at delta=1: \n          new_τ = -23 + 12*1 = -11\n          new_h = -12 + 12*1 = 0\n      So the car covers [-11, 0]. So 0 is included.\n\n  Therefore, at delta=1, if we are on freeway6 (y=6) we collide.\n\n  So state (1,6) is invalid.\n\nAt (1,4): freeway4 at delta=1.\n\nFreeway4: car: (0, -47, right, 48) -> so τ=-47, h=0 at t1=22 (delta=0).\nAt delta=1: \n   new_τ = -47 + 48*1 = 1\n   new_h = 0 + 48*1 = 48\n   So the car covers [1,48]. 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nAt (1,5): freeway5 at delta=1: \n  car1: τ=-23+12= -11, h=-12+12=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision.\n\nWait, but we just computed for freeway5 at delta=1: the first car covers [-11,0] -> so 0 is included? Then (1,5) is unsafe.\n\nBut at delta=0 we were safe at freeway5.\n\nSo at (1,5) we have collision.\n\nTherefore, from (0,5) we cannot do S (because (1,5) is unsafe) and we cannot do U (because (1,6) is unsafe). Then we must do D: to (1,4) which is safe.\n\nSo at turn 22 (delta=0): we take action D -> then at turn 23 (delta=1) we are at (0,4).\n\nNow, from (1,4): we can try U, D, S.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway4 at delta=1: we just checked: safe.\n\nNow, from (1,4):\n  U -> (2,5): freeway5 at delta=2.\n  D -> (2,3): freeway3 at delta=2.\n  S -> (2,4): freeway4 at delta=2.\n\nCheck freeway5 at delta=2:\n  car1: τ=-23+12*2 = -23+24=1, h=-12+24=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe for this car.\n  car2: τ=13+12*2=13+24=37, h=24+24=48 -> [37,48] -> safe.\n  car3: τ=49+24=73, h=60+24=84 -> safe.\n  So freeway5 at delta=2 is safe.\n\nCheck freeway3 at delta=2:\n  freeway3: car (0,-47,right,48) -> \n      τ = -47+48*2 = -47+96=49, h=0+96=96 -> [49,96] -> safe.\n\nCheck freeway4 at delta=2:\n  freeway4: same as freeway3? Actually, freeway4 has one car: (0,-47,right,48) -> \n      τ = -47+48*2=49, h=0+96=96 -> [49,96] -> safe.\n\nTherefore, from (1,4) we can do any of U, D, S.\n\nBut we want to go up. So we try U to (2,5): safe.\n\nThen from (2,5): we are at freeway5 at delta=2 -> safe (as above).\n\nNow, from (2,5): we can try U to (3,6): freeway6 at delta=3.\n\nCheck freeway6 at delta=3:\n  car1: τ=-23+12*3=-23+36=13, h=-12+36=24 -> [13,24] -> 0 not in -> safe for car1.\n  car2: τ=13+12*3=13+36=49, h=24+36=60 -> [49,60] -> safe.\n  car3: τ=49+36=85, h=60+36=96 -> safe.\n  So freeway6 at delta=3 is safe.\n\nSo we do U: to (3,6).\n\nThen from (3,6): we can try U to (4,7): freeway7 at delta=4.\n\nCheck freeway7 at delta=4: same as freeway5 and 6? \n  freeway7: (-12,-23,12), (24,13,12), (60,49,12) -> same as freeway5.\n\n  car1: τ=-23+12*4 = -23+48=25, h=-12+48=36 -> [25,36] -> safe.\n  car2: τ=13+48=61, h=24+48=72 -> safe.\n  car3: τ=49+48=97, h=60+48=108 -> safe.\n\nSo safe. Then U to (4,7).\n\nThen from (4,7): U to (5,8): freeway8 at delta=5.\n\nCheck freeway8: (0,-47,right,48) -> \n  τ = -47+48*5 = -47+240=193, h=0+240=240 -> [193,240] -> safe.\n\nThen from (5,8): U to (6,9): at y=9 -> safe (no freeway). So we reached.\n\nNow, what is the sequence?\n\nAt turn 22 (delta=0): we started at (0,5) -> then we did D (to y=4 at delta=1).\nThen at delta=1 (turn23): we did U (to y=5 at delta=2).\nThen at delta=2 (turn24): U (to y=6 at delta=3).\nThen delta=3 (turn25): U (to y=7 at delta=4).\nThen delta=4 (turn26): U (to y=8 at delta=5).\nThen delta=5 (turn27): U (to y=9 at delta=6).\n\nBut wait, we are at y=9 at delta=6? Then H = 6+1 = 7? But we did 6 actions: from delta0 to delta5 (6 actions) and then at the last action (at delta=5) we go to y=9. So the last action is at turn 22+5 = 27, and we are at (0,9) at turn 27. Then H=6? \n\nActually: \n  Turn 22: action D -> then at turn23 we are at y=4.\n  Turn23: action U -> turn24: y=5.\n  Turn24: U -> turn25: y=6.\n  Turn25: U -> turn26: y=7.\n  Turn26: U -> turn27: y=8.\n  Turn27: U -> then at turn28 we are at y=9? \n\nBut the problem: after taking an action at turn t, we update to y_{t+1}. So:\n\n  At turn t: we are at y_t, we take action a_t -> then we are at y_{t+1} at the next turn.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t is (t, y_t). After taking a_t, we are at turn t+1 with y_{t+1}=y_t + delta.\n\nSo at turn22: we take action D -> then at turn23 we are at y=4.\n\nAt turn23: we take action U -> then at turn24 we are at y=5.\n\n...\n\nAt turn27: we take action U -> then at turn28 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem requires: at the last turn (turn t1+H-1 = 22+H-1) we are at (0,9). So at turn 22+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut in this sequence, at turn28 we are at y=9. So 22+H-1 = 28 -> H-1=6 -> H=7.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns: 22,23,24,25,26,27 -> 6 actions? But H=7? \n\nWait: the sequence of actions is from t_1 to t_1+H-1. So we have H actions. The last action is taken at t_1+H-1 and after that we are at the next turn (t_1+H) at y=9? \n\nBut the problem says: we take an action at turn t and then the next state is at turn t+1. So to be at y=9 at turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that led to y=9 at turn T.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nRe-read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\"\n\nSo at the moment we take the last action (the H-th action) at turn t_1+H-1, we update to the next state which is at turn t_1+H. But the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLook: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\"\n\nSo the last state (after the last action) is at turn t_1+H-1? But note: the action at turn t_1+H-1 is taken, and then the state at that same turn? \n\nBut the update rule: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where Delta y_t is from action at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, we take action a_t and then we are at y_{t+1} at the next turn (t+1). \n\nTherefore, the state at turn t is y_t. The action at turn t leads to y_{t+1}.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to have the player at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1. That means we are at y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\nTo achieve that, we take the action at turn t_1+H-2 that leads to y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is defined for t from t_1 to t_1+H-1: that is, we take actions at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nThe last action is at turn t_1+H-1. Then after that, we are at turn t_1+H. \n\nBut the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nThis implies that the state at the moment of taking the action at turn t_1+H-1 must be (0,9). But then we don't need to take an action at turn t_1+H-1? \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me re-read: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n\nThis means: \n   a_{t_1 + 0}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1+H-1}\n\nSo the actions are taken at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAnd we require that at turn t_1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the update: \n   At turn t: we are at y_t, we take a_t -> then we become y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nSo at the moment we are at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t and then we become at turn t+1 at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1, we must have y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the last action we take is at turn t_1+H-1: then it would update to y_{t_1+H} = y_{t_1+H-1} + Delta, which we don't care? \n\nBut the problem says: we take H actions and at the last action (at turn t_1+H-1) we are at (0,9). But the state at the time of taking the action is (0,9) and then we take an action? Then we would leave (0,9) if we move? \n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \n   \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\"\n\nand the sequence of actions is taken at turns t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nBut the update rule: after taking an action at turn t, we are at the new state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1, we must have taken an action at turn t_1+H-2 that led to y_{t_1+H-1}=9. Then at turn t_1+H-1, we are at (0,9) and we don't need to take an action? But the problem requires an action at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, we might interpret: the action at turn t_1+H-1 is taken and then we are at (0,9) at the next state? But the problem says we are to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nI think the problem means: we take the actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1, and at the end of the last action (which is at turn t_1+H-1) we are at (0,9). But note: at the end of the action at turn t, we are at turn t+1. \n\nSo actually, after taking the last action at turn t_1+H-1, we are at the state at turn t_1+H. Therefore, we require that at turn t_1+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\". \n\nThis is a critical point.\n\nLooking at the example in the problem: none.\n\nBut the problem states: \n   \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\"\n\nSo it explicitly says at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nTherefore, we must be at (0,9) at the same turn as we take the last action.\n\nThat means that the last action (at turn t_1+H-1) is taken and then we remain at the same state? But the update rule says we update to the next turn.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1 is (0,9). Then we don't need to take an action? But the sequence requires an action at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nI think the problem means: we take the actions for turns t_1 to t_1+H-1, and the condition is that at the beginning of each turn we are at a state that is safe, and at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut then the last action at turn t_1+H-1 is taken, and then we update to a state at turn t_1+H, but we don't care about that state as long as we have already reached (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\". And the collision condition is checked at the turn we are at a freeway. \n\nSo at turn t_1+H-1, if we are at (0,9) and we take an action, then we update to turn t_1+H. But at turn t_1+H-1, we are at y=9, which is safe (no freeway). \n\nTherefore, it is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we must be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1. How do we achieve that?\n\nWe start at turn t_1=22 at y=5. Then we take an action at turn 22: which leads to y_{23} = ... but the state at turn 22 is y=5. We want to be at y=9 at turn 22+H-1.\n\nSo we need to have y_{22+H-1} = 9.\n\nThe actions we take at turn t (for t from 22 to 22+H-2) will determine y_{t+1}, and the action at turn 22+H-1 will determine y_{22+H}. But we require y_{22+H-1}=9.\n\nTherefore, the last action (at turn 22+H-1) is taken when we are already at y=9? Then we can take any action? But then we might move away? \n\nBut the problem doesn't say we have to stay at 9, only that at turn 22+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  At turn 22+H-1: we are at y=9, then we take an action (say S) and then we go to y=9 at turn 22+H, but we don't care.\n\nBut the minimal H: we want the minimal H such that we can be at y=9 at turn 22+H-1.\n\nIn our BFS, we should therefore consider: we are at (delta, y) at turn 22+delta. We want to find the minimal delta such that we are at y=9 at turn 22+delta. Then H = delta+1? \n\nBecause: \n  turn = 22+delta = 22+H-1  => delta = H-1  => H = delta+1.\n\nSo we are looking for the minimal delta for which we can be at y=9 at turn 22+delta.\n\nAnd then H = delta+1.\n\nThe actions: we take actions at turns 22, 23, ..., 22+delta (because H-1 = delta, so the last action is at turn 22+delta). But wait, the actions are from t1 to t1+H-1 = 22 to 22+delta.\n\nThe actions: \n   at turn 22: leads to y_{23} = ... \n   but the state at turn 22 is given.\n\nTo be at y_{22+delta} = 9, we need to have arrived at that state by the action taken at turn 22+delta-1.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: \n   a_22, a_23, ..., a_{22+delta-1}   (total of delta actions) \n   and then at turn 22+delta, we are at y=9.\n\nBut then we have to take an action at turn 22+delta? because the actions go up to a_{22+H-1} = a_{22+delta} (since H-1=delta). \n\nBut then we are taking an action at turn 22+delta (when we are at y=9). That action will update to y_{22+delta+1}, but we don't care.\n\nTherefore, in our BFS, we can stop when we find a state (delta, 9) and then we will have taken delta actions to get to that state (from turn22 to turn22+delta-1), and then at turn22+delta we are at y=9. Then we require one more action at turn22+delta? \n\nBut the total number of actions is H = delta+1.\n\nBut the state (delta,9) means we are at turn22+delta and at y=9. Then we need to output H = delta+1 actions: the first delta actions to get to that state, and then one more action at turn22+delta (which can be anything, but we choose S for example).\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. And at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nIn this case, t1+H-1 = 22 + (delta+1) - 1 = 22+delta.\n\nSo at turn 22+delta, we are at (0,9) and we take an action a_{22+delta}. \n\nBut we are already at (0,9) at the beginning of turn 22+delta, and then we take an action. We can choose S (stay) so that we remain at 9.\n\nSo in the BFS, we can stop when we find a state (delta,9) and then the total number of actions is H = delta+1.\n\nThe actions: \n   for turns: 22, 23, ..., 22+delta.\n\nThe actions for turns 22 to 22+delta-1 are the ones that brought us from (22,5) to (22+delta,9). The last action at turn22+delta can be S.\n\nBut wait, in our BFS we only computed the actions to get to (delta,9). We need one more action at turn22+delta? \n\nActually, we require to be at (0,9) at turn22+delta, and then we take an action. So we do need to include that last action.\n\nBut the minimal H is the minimal such delta+1.\n\nHowever, we can also achieve being at (0,9) at an earlier turn? and then we take the last action at that turn.\n\nIn our BFS, we are searching for the minimal delta such that we can be at y=9 at turn22+delta. Then H = delta+1.\n\nBut note: we might have a path that gets to y=9 at an earlier turn? \n\nIn the earlier simulation, we got to y=9 at turn28 (if we count the state at turn28 as y=9). But turn28 is 22+6. So delta=6, H=7.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe had to go down at the first step because at turn23 (delta=1) we couldn't stay at 5 or go to 6 (both unsafe). So we went to 4.\n\nBut then we went up: 4->5->6->7->8->9: that took 5 more actions (from turn23 to turn28: 5 actions? Let me count:\n\n  turn22: D -> turn23: y=4.\n  turn23: U -> turn24: y=5.\n  turn24: U -> turn25: y=6.\n  turn25: U -> turn26: y=7.\n  turn26: U -> turn27: y=8.\n  turn27: U -> turn28: y=9.\n\nSo at turn28 (delta=6) we are at y=9. Then we take an action at turn28: which is the 7th action.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe started at 5. We want to be at 9. The minimal steps without obstacles is 4: UUUU.\n\nBut we had to detour down to 4, which added extra steps.\n\nCan we avoid going down? \n\nAt turn22: we are at y=5. We cannot do S (because at turn23 we would be at y=5 and freeway5 at delta=1 is unsafe) and we cannot do U (because at turn23 we would be at y=6 and freeway6 at delta=1 is unsafe). So we must do D.\n\nBut what if we do D and then D again? \n\nAt turn22: D -> turn23: y=4 (safe, as we saw).\nAt turn23: D -> turn24: y=3.\n\nCheck freeway3 at delta=2 (turn24=22+2): \n  freeway3: (0,-47,right,48) -> \n      τ = -47+48*2 = 49, h=0+96=96 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn24: we can do U to y=4 at turn25 (freeway4 at delta=3): \n  freeway4: same as freeway3: τ=-47+48*3=97, h=0+144=144 -> safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at turn26 (freeway5 at delta=4): \n  freeway5: \n      car1: τ=-23+12*4=25, h=-12+48=36 -> safe.\n      car2: 13+48=61, 24+48=72 -> safe.\n      car3: 49+48=97, 60+48=108 -> safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at turn27 (freeway6 at delta=5): \n      car1: τ=-23+12*5=37, h=-12+60=48 -> safe.\n      car2: 13+60=73, 24+60=84 -> safe.\n      car3: 49+60=109, 60+60=120 -> safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at turn28: freeway7 at delta=6: \n      car1: τ=-23+12*6=49, h=-12+72=60 -> safe.\n      ... \n\nThen U to y=8 at turn29, then U to y=9 at turn30. Then we need to take the last action at turn30. So H=9.\n\nThis is worse.\n\nAlternatively, after going to y=4 at turn23, we could go up to y=5 at turn24 (as we did) and then instead of going up to 6 at turn25, we could wait at 5? \n\nAt turn24: we are at y=5 (delta=2) -> safe (as we checked earlier: freeway5 at delta=2 is safe).\n\nThen at turn24: we do S -> then at turn25: we are at y=5 (delta=3).\n\nCheck freeway5 at delta=3:\n  car1: τ=-23+12*3=13, h=-12+36=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n  car2: 13+36=49, 24+36=60 -> safe.\n  car3: 49+36=85, 60+36=96 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn25: we can go U to y=6 at turn26 (delta=4): \n  freeway6 at delta=4:\n      car1: τ=-23+48=25, h=-12+48=36 -> safe.\n      ... -> safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at turn27: freeway7 at delta=5: \n      car1: τ=-23+60=37, h=-12+60=48 -> safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at turn28: freeway8 at delta=6: \n      τ=-47+48*6 = -47+288=241, h=0+288=288 -> safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at turn29.\n\nSo then at turn29 (delta=7) we are at y=9. Then we take an action at turn29. So H=8? \n\nBut our first path was H=7: \n   turn22: D\n   turn23: U\n   turn24: U\n   turn25: U\n   turn26: U\n   turn27: U -> then at turn28: y=9 -> then at turn28: we take an action (the 7th action).\n\nIn the first path, we were at y=9 at turn28 (which is 22+6). Then we take the 7th action at turn28.\n\nBut the problem requires: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So at turn22+7-1=28, we are at (0,9). Then we take an action at turn28.\n\nSo the first path has H=7.\n\nThe second path (with a wait) has H=8? \n\nIn the second path: \n   turn22: D -> to y=4 at turn23.\n   turn23: U -> to y=5 at turn24.\n   turn24: S -> to y=5 at turn25.\n   turn25: U -> to y=6 at turn26.\n   turn26: U -> to y=7 at turn27.\n   turn27: U -> to y=8 at turn28.\n   turn28: U -> to y=9 at turn29.\n   turn29: we take an action (but we are already at y=9 at turn29). \n\nBut we are at y=9 at turn29. Then we take an action at turn29. So the last state (at the time of taking the action) is turn29: we are at (0,9). So t1+H-1=29 -> 22+H-1=29 -> H=8.\n\nBut in the first path, we were at y=9 at turn28, so we take the action at turn28 and we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn28? Then we take the action at turn28 and move to y=9 at turn29? \n\nBut the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So in the first path, at turn28 we are at (0,9) and we take an action. \n\nBut how did we get to be at (0,9) at turn28? \n\nIn the first path: \n   turn27: we are at y=8 (at turn27). Then we take action U at turn27 -> then at turn28 we are at y=9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn28, we are at y=8. Then we take the action U at turn27 and then at turn28 we are at y=9. \n\nTherefore, at turn28, we are at y=9. \n\nSo the state at turn28 is y=9. So we are at (0,9) at turn28.\n\nTherefore, in the first path, we are at (0,9) at turn28 (which is 22+6) and we take the 7th action at turn28.\n\nSo H=7.\n\nNow, is there a path with H<7?\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn22+H-1. The minimal turn number we can be at y=9 is 22+4=26? (if we go up 4 times: UUUU from 5 to 9: then at turn26 we would be at y=9?).\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions.\n\nLet's try:\n\nStart at turn22: y=5 (safe).\nAction at turn22: U -> then at turn23: y=6. But at turn23 (delta=1), freeway6 is unsafe (as we saw: car1 covers [ -11,0] at delta=1) -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, at turn22: S -> then at turn23: y=5, but freeway5 at delta=1 is unsafe (car1: [-11,0] -> collision).\n\nD: as we did, safe.\n\nSo we must do D at turn22.\n\nThen at turn23: y=4 (safe).\n\nNow, to get to 9 in minimal steps, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nAt turn23: U -> to y=5 at turn24 (freeway5 at delta=2: safe).\nAt turn24: U -> to y=6 at turn25 (freeway6 at delta=3: safe, as we computed earlier: [13,24] for car1, etc.).\nAt turn25: U -> to y=7 at turn26 (freeway7 at delta=4: safe).\nAt turn26: U -> to y=8 at turn27 (freeway8 at delta=5: \n        τ=-47+48*5 = 193, h=0+240=240 -> safe).\nAt turn27: U -> to y=9 at turn28.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn28. Then we take an action at turn28: so H=7.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=9 earlier? \n\nAt turn26: we want to be at y=9? \n\nFrom turn22: \n   turn22: D -> to y=4 at turn23.\n   turn23: U -> to y=5 at turn24.\n   turn24: U -> to y=6 at turn25.\n   turn25: U -> to y=7 at turn26.\n   then at turn26: we are at y=7. To get to y=9 at turn26? We would have to have been at y=7 at turn25 and then taken an action at turn25 that goes to y=9? But we can only move one step. So impossible.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at y=9 at turn27? \n\nAt turn27: we would need to be at y=9. How?\n   turn22: D -> turn23: y=4.\n   turn23: ... \n   We have 5 steps (from turn23 to turn27) to go from 4 to 9: 5 steps -> UUUUU: 5 moves up.\n\nBut let's see if we can do:\n\n   turn23: U (to5)\n   turn24: U (to6)\n   turn25: U (to7)\n   turn26: U (to8)\n   turn27: U (to9) -> then at turn27 we are at y=9.\n\nBut we must check the safety:\n\nAt turn27 (which is 22+5, so delta=5):\n\n  At turn23 (delta=1): y=4 -> freeway4: safe (as above).\n  turn24 (delta=2): y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n  turn25 (delta=3): y=6 -> freeway6: \n        car1: τ=-23+12*3=13, h=-12+36=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n        ... -> safe.\n  turn26 (delta=4): y=7 -> freeway7: \n        car1: τ=-23+48=25, h=-12+48=36 -> safe.\n        ... -> safe.\n  turn27 (delta=5): y=8 -> freeway8: \n        τ=-47+48*5=193, h=0+240=240 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn27: we take U -> then at turn28 we are at y=9. But we are at turn27: we are at y=8. We take action U at turn27 and then at turn28 we are at y=9. But we want to be at y=9 at turn27? \n\nTo be at y=9 at turn27, we would have to have been at y=8 at turn26 and taken U at turn26 to get to y=9 at turn27.\n\nBut at turn26: we are at y=7 (from turn26 we are at y=7). Then at turn26 we take U: then at turn27 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn27, we must have been at y=8 at turn26 and taken U at turn26. But we were at y=7 at turn26.\n\nWe could try to go faster:\n\n   turn22: D -> to4 at turn23.\n   turn23: U -> to5 at turn24.\n   turn24: U -> to6 at turn25.\n   turn25: U -> to7 at turn26.\n   turn26: we want to go to 9? But we can only move one step. So we go to 8 at turn27.\n   then at turn27: we go to9 at turn28.\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn28.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the down and then up by waiting? But we couldn't at turn22.\n\nOr we might go down to 3? \n\nAt turn22: D -> to4 at turn23.\nAt turn23: D -> to3 at turn24 (freeway3 at delta=2: safe, as above).\nAt turn24: U -> to4 at turn25 (freeway4 at delta=3: safe).\nAt turn25: U -> to5 at turn26 (freeway5 at delta=4: safe).\nAt turn26: U -> to6 at turn27 (freeway6 at delta=5: safe).\nAt turn27: U -> to7 at turn28.\nAt turn28: U -> to8 at turn29.\nAt turn29: U -> to9 at turn30.\n\nThen we are at y=9 at turn30 -> H=9.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr from turn23: we go to y=4, then at turn23 we do U to y=5 at turn24, then at turn24 we do U to y=6 at turn25, then at turn25 we do U to y=7 at turn26, then at turn26 we do U to y=8 at turn27, then at turn27 we do U to y=9 at turn28: same as our first path.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: ? \n\nBut we must take 7 actions: from turn22 to turn28.\n\nAt turn28: we are at y=9. Then we take an action. We can take S (stay). \n\nBut the problem: the sequence of actions must be provided for turns 22 to 28.\n\nSo the actions are:\n\n  Turn22: D\n  Turn23: U\n  Turn24: U\n  Turn25: U\n  Turn26: U\n  Turn27: U\n  Turn28: S  (or U, but if we do U we go to 10? but y is bounded to 9 -> if we do U at y=9, we stay at 9? The update: if a=U and y<9 then y+1. So at y=9, U does nothing? Similarly, the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if at y=9 and we do U, we stay at 9.\n\nSo we can do U at turn28? But then we are at 9 at turn29? But we don't care. Or we can do S.\n\nBut the problem only requires to reach (0,9) at turn28 (which we are) and then we take an action (any) at turn28.\n\nSo we can choose S.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: S\n\nBut wait, in the first part we had an action at turn27 that moved us to y=8 to y=9 at turn28. Then at turn28 we do S.\n\nBut the problem: at turn28 we are at (0,9) and we take an action. That's acceptable.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=6? \n\nWe would need to be at y=9 at turn22+6-1=27.\n\nSo at turn27, we are at y=9.\n\nHow? \n   Start at turn22: y=5.\n   Then we have 5 actions: from turn22 to turn26 (5 actions) that lead to y_27=9.\n\nBut from 5 to 9 in 5 moves? That's 4 steps? But we have 5 actions: so we can do 5 moves? \n\nThe minimal moves to go from 5 to 9 is 4. So we can do it in 4 moves? Then we would be at y=9 at turn26? Then at turn26 we are at y=9, and we take the 5th action at turn26? Then H=6 would require the last state at turn27? \n\nBut we require to be at y=9 at turn27. \n\nTo be at y=9 at turn27, we must have been at y=8 at turn26 and taken U at turn26.\n\nBut we start at 5 at turn22. \n\nWe need to get to 8 at turn26.\n\nThat's 4 moves: from 5 to 8: 3 moves? So we have 4 actions (turn22 to turn25) to get to 8 at turn26? \n\nBut we must avoid collisions.\n\nLet me try:\n\nTurn22: D -> to4 at turn23. (safe)\nTurn23: U -> to5 at turn24. (safe at freeway5, delta=2)\nTurn24: U -> to6 at turn25. (freeway6 at delta=3: safe)\nTurn25: U -> to7 at turn26. (freeway7 at delta=4: safe)\nThen at turn26: we are at y=7. Then we take U at turn26 to go to y=8 at turn27. But we want to be at y=9 at turn27? \n\nSo we are at y=8 at turn27, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn27, we would need to be at y=8 at turn26 and then take U at turn26 to go to y=9 at turn27. \n\nBut we are at y=7 at turn26.\n\nWe need to get to y=8 at turn26? \n\nHow? \n   turn22: D -> to4 at23.\n   turn23: U -> to5 at24.\n   turn24: U -> to6 at25.\n   turn25: U -> to7 at26? \n   then at turn25 we are at y=7? Then we cannot get to y=8 at turn26? \n\nAlternatively, we might go faster? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nOr skip the down? But we cannot.\n\nTherefore, H=7 is minimal.\n\nSo the answer:\n\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: S\n\nBut note: at turn27 we took U to go from y=8 (at turn27) to y=9 at turn28. Then at turn28 we take S.\n\nBut the sequence of actions must be for turns 22 to 28 (7 actions).\n\nWe can write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: S\n}\n\nBut let me double-check the safety at each state:\n\nAt turn22 (delta=0): y=5 -> freeway5: safe (as above).\nAction D: then at turn23: y=4.\n\nAt turn23 (delta=1): y=4 -> freeway4: \n   car: (0,-47,48) -> τ=-47+48=1, h=0+48=48 -> [1,48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nAction U: to y=5 at turn24.\n\nAt turn24 (delta=2): y=5 -> freeway5: \n   car1: τ=-23+24=1, h=-12+24=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n   car2: 13+24=37, 24+24=48 -> safe.\n   car3: 49+24=73, 60+24=84 -> safe.\nAction U: to y=6 at turn25.\n\nAt turn25 (delta=3): y=6 -> freeway6: \n   car1: τ=-23+36=13, h=-12+36=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n   ... -> safe.\nAction U: to y=7 at turn26.\n\nAt turn26 (delta=4): y=7 -> freeway7: \n   car1: τ=-23+48=25, h=-12+48=36 -> safe.\n   ... -> safe.\nAction U: to y=8 at turn27.\n\nAt turn27 (delta=5): y=8 -> freeway8: \n   car: (0,-47,48) -> τ=-47+48*5=193, h=0+240=240 -> safe.\nAction U: then to y=9 at turn28.\n\nAt turn28 (delta=6): we are at y=9 -> safe (no freeway). Then we take action S (or U, but S is fine).\n\nBut the action at turn28 is taken at the state (turn28, y=9). We are safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is valid.\n\nNote: we could also do D or U at turn28, but S is safe and simple.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=7 that ends earlier? No, because we cannot be at y=9 earlier.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 7.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0. Cars move left or right at constant speeds, and I collide if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway where a car spans position 0 at that exact turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn relative to turn t1=23. The car positions are given at t1, and they move linearly with their speeds.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 0 for simplicity, so t1=23 is now t=0. I'll work in turns relative to now.\n\nSo current turn: t=0, player at y=4.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions for t=0 to t=H-1 such that at turn H-1, y=9, and for each turn, when I'm on a freeway y (from 1 to 8), no car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, if I move from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T I'm still on y_T, and at turn T+1 I'm on y_{T+1}. So for collision, at turn T, I care about the car on y_T at time T.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, then for that freeway, if any car has 0 in its span at time T, I collide.\n\nIf y_T = 0 or 9, no freeway, so no collision possible.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think. The grid has y from 0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach (0,9), which is y=9, so once I'm there, I'm safe.\n\nBut I need to get to y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: since I start at y=4, and need to go to y=9, that's +5 in y, so minimum 5 turns if I go up every time, but I might need to avoid cars, so I might have to wait or go down sometimes, but going down might not help, or I might need to time things.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the minimal path in terms of moves is at least 5 up moves, but I might have some stay or down moves, which would increase H.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=0 to t=H-1, I take H actions, and at t=H-1, I'm at y=9.\n\nStart at t=0, after action a0, at t=1 position, and so on, up to after action a_{H-1}, at t=H position.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is y_t.\n\nAfter choosing action a_t, y_{t+1} is updated based on a_t.\n\nThen, at time t, the position is y_t, and that's when I might collide if on freeway and car span includes 0.\n\nIn the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if on freeway y_T and 0 in span for that freeway at T.\n\nSo at each time t, given y_t, I need that if y_t in [1,8], then for freeway y_t, no car has 0 in span at time t.\n\nNow, time is absolute, but since we start from t1=23, I'll use relative time.\n\nSet t=0 as current turn, so at t=0, y=4.\n\nI need to find actions a_0, a_1, ..., a_{H-1} such that at some turn T, y_T = 9 for T <= H-1? No.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=H, y_H should be 9, I think.\n\nLet's see the sequence: actions from t=0 to t=H-1, so after H actions, at time t=H, position is y_H.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H -1} = 9, but t1 + H -1 is the time after H-1 actions? Let's see the index.\n\nThe player position at turn t1 is given, which is (0,4) at turn t1=23.\n\nThen we apply actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1}, at turn t1+2, position y_{t1+2}, and so on, up to after action a_{t1+H-1}, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} = 9, I think? No.\n\nThe turn when we reach is t1 + H -1? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nFrom the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAfter these actions, at turn t1 + H, position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we reach at turn t1 + H -1? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLet's read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nReach at turn t1 + H -1, meaning that at the beginning of turn t1 + H -1, or after action?\n\nTypically, position is defined at each turn.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t is given before action.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t, y_t is the position.\n\nWe start at turn t1, y_{t1} = 4.\n\nWe apply a_{t1}, then at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy based on a_{t1}.\n\nSimilarly, apply a_{t1+1}, at turn t1+2, y_{t1+2}, and so on.\n\nAfter applying H actions, we have from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, resulting in positions at turns t1+1 to t1+H.\n\nWe want to reach (0,9) at some turn, specifically at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nturn t1 + H -1 is the turn when we are at (0,9), meaning y_{t1 + H -1} = 9.\n\nFor that to happen, we must have applied actions up to a_{t1 + H -2} to reach y_{t1 + H -1} = 9 after H-1 actions? Let's index.\n\nLet τ = t - t1, so relative turn.\n\nAt τ=0, y=4.\n\nApply a_0 (which is a_{t1}), then at τ=1, y1.\n\nApply a1, at τ=2, y2, ..., apply a_{k-1}, at τ=k, yk.\n\nWe want y_K = 9 for some K, with K as small as possible, and H is the number of actions to achieve that.\n\nSince we start at τ=0, and after m actions, we are at τ=m with y_m.\n\nTo have y_K = 9, we need K actions from τ=0 to τ=K-1, so H = K actions to reach at turn K.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at τ=5, we need actions from a0 to a4, applied at τ=0 to 4, position at τ=1 to 5, so at τ=5, y=9 after 5 actions.\n\nGenerally, to be at position y at relative turn T, we need T actions: a0 to a_{T-1}, and y_T = 9.\n\nThen H = T.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\", so for relative, reach at turn H-1? Let's see the notation.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1 for the sequence index.\n\nSo for relative turn, reach at turn H-1 (relative), with y_{H-1} = 9.\n\nThen, to have y_{H-1} = 9, we need actions from a0 to a_{H-2} to go from y0 to y_{H-1}, so H-1 actions? Messy.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that with H actions, we reach at turn H.\n\nSet: at relative turn 0, y0 = 4.\n\nAfter 1 action a0, at turn 1, y1.\n\nAfter 2 actions, at turn 2, y2, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, yH.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t1 + H -1, which is relative turn H-1.\n\nSo y_{H-1} = 9.\n\nTo have y_{H-1} = 9, we need actions a0 to a_{H-2} applied at turns 0 to H-2, affecting positions at turns 1 to H-1.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is from a0 to a_{H-2} for H-1 actions? But the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1, so for reaching at turn H-1, we have actions a0 to a_{H-1}? I'm confused.\n\nLet's look back at the problem:\n\n\" a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} \"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nSo the actions are at times t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThe position after action at time t is at time t+1.\n\nSo after action at t1+H-1, position at time t1+H.\n\nBut we want position at time t1+H-1 to be (0,9).\n\nThat means at time t1+H-1, before the action, y is 9.\n\nBut at time t1+H-1, we apply action a_{t1+H-1}, which changes y to y_{t1+H}.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, we need that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, y is 9, and then we apply an action, but we might not need to apply an action if we are already there, but the sequence includes actions up to H-1.\n\nPerhaps for the turn when we reach, we don't need an action after that.\n\nBut the sequence is for actions to reach, so the last action should bring us to y=9.\n\nLet's assume that at turn T, y_T = 9, and we stop.\n\nThen the actions are from t=0 to T-1 relative, so H actions for T steps? I think it's easier to define the turn when we arrive.\n\nI think there's a inconsistency in the notation.\n\nPerhaps \"turn t1 + H -1\" is the time when we are at (0,9), and we have applied H-1 actions to get there from start.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions from t=0 to 0, one action, reach at turn t1 +1-1 = t1, but at turn t1 we are already at (0,4), not (0,9), so we need to move.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1, with actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1} at time t1+H-1, position at time t1+H is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want position at time t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo at time t1+H-1, before action, y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThen we apply a_{t1+H-1}, which may change it, but we don't care, as long as at that turn it is 9.\n\nBut the position at turn t is before action, I think.\n\nLet's read the player update: \"at turn t, position (0, y_t)\", then we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nWith T = t1 + H -1.\n\nAnd actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} are applied.\n\nFor y_T = 9 at T = t1 + H -1, we need that the actions before that have brought us to y_T = 9.\n\nThe actions that affect y_T are a_{t1} to a_{T-1} for T = t1 + H -1.\n\nSince T = t1 + H -1, so t1 = T - H +1, so actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} = a_{T-H+1} to a_{T}.\n\nTo have y_T = 9, we need actions from a_{T-H+1} to a_{T-1}, because a_T is applied at turn T to set y_{T+1}, so it doesn't affect y_T.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nTo simplify, let's work with relative turns.\n\nSet τ = 0 at t1, so at τ=0, y=4.\n\nWe want y_K = 9 for some K.\n\nThen H such that K = H-1, so K = H-1, so H = K+1.\n\nActions are from a_0 to a_{H-1} = a_0 to a_K.\n\nFor y_K = 9, we need actions a0 to a_{K-1} to move from y0 to yK.\n\nSo the actions that affect position up to yK are a0 to a_{K-1}.\n\nBut the sequence includes a0 to a_{H-1}, and H-1 = K, so actions a0 to a_K.\n\na_K is applied at turn K to set y_{K+1}, so for y_K, it is set by actions before.\n\nTo have y_K = 9, we need actions a0 to a_{K-1}, and the sequence has a0 to a_{H-1} with H-1 = K, so a0 to a_K, which includes a_K that is not needed for y_K.\n\nBut in the answer, we list the actions, and for the turn when we reach, we might not need an action, but the sequence includes it.\n\nPerhaps for the turn K when we are at y_K=9, we can choose any action, but since we have reached, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the collision avoidance, at turn K, if y_K=9, it's safe, no collision.\n\nThen we apply a_K, which might move us away, but we only care about reaching at turn K.\n\nSo for the sequence, we include actions up to a_K, but a_K doesn't affect the reaching at K.\n\nTo minimize H, we want the smallest K such that we can be at y_K=9 with no collisions up to turn K.\n\nThen H = K+1, and actions a0 to a_K, with a_K arbitrary, since we are already at 9.\n\nBut to be precise, at turn K, we are at y_K=9, safe, then we apply a_K, which could be S, U, or D, but if we U, y_{K+1}=10, which is invalid since y=0 to9, so probably we should S or D, but D to 8, not 9.\n\ny must be in [0,9], so from 9, if we U, y=10 invalid, so we can only D or S.\n\nBut since we are at 9, we can stay or go down, but we want to be at 9, so for the turn when we reach, we can choose S to stay, or do nothing, but we have to choose an action.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify a_K for turn K.\n\nBut to reach at turn K, we can choose a_K = S to stay at 9, or a_K = D to go to 8, but then we are not at 9 anymore, so we should choose S to stay.\n\nSimilarly, at start, if we are at 9, we can S.\n\nBut in this case, we start at 4.\n\nFor this problem, since we need to reach at turn H-1 relative, with y=9, and we list actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nTo have y_{H-1} = 9, we need actions a0 to a_{H-2} to move from y0 to y_{H-1}, and a_{H-1} is applied at turn H-1 to set y_H, but y_H is after, so for reaching at turn H-1, a_{H-1} is not necessary, but we include it, and we can set it to S to stay at 9 for y_H, but we don't care about after.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll define the relative turn when we want to be at 9 as K, so y_K = 9.\n\nThen the number of actions to achieve that is K, from a0 to a_{K-1}.\n\nThen in the problem's H, we have H such that t1 + H -1 is the turn, so K = H-1, so H = K+1, and actions from t=0 to H-1, which is a0 to a_{H-2} for moving to y_{H-1}, and a_{H-1} for turn H-1 to set y_H.\n\nBut for the sequence, we list a_t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor the reaching turn, we list a_{H-1} which is for after reaching.\n\nTo simplify, I'll first find the smallest K such that we can be at y_K=9 with no collisions from τ=0 to K.\n\nThen H = K+1, and actions a0 to a_K, with a_K = S to stay at 9 or something.\n\nBut let's proceed with the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at relative time τ=0.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8.\n\nFor each freeway, cars are given with head, tail, direction, speed at time t1=23, which is τ=0.\n\nFor a future time τ, the span at time t1 + τ is:\n\nSince t1 + τ, so for car at relative time τ.\n\nFor a car with direction d, speed s, at time τ, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving, span at τ: [h - s*τ, τ - s*τ]? Tail τ, but in the notation, for left-moving, span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)], but τ is tail, confusing.\n\nLet's use different variable.\n\nLet t be absolute time, but since t1=23, for time t, relative τ = t - t1.\n\nAt τ=0, for a car, head h, tail t (let's use t for tail, but t is time, so better to use different symbol.\n\nIn the table, it's head h, tail τ, but τ is used for time, so I'll use \"tail\" or something.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFor each car, at τ=0, head, tail, dir, speed.\n\nThen at relative time τ, the position:\n\nIf direction right, the car is moving right, so at time τ, the head is at h + s*τ, tail at tail + s*τ, and since it's right-moving, span is [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ], because tail is left end, head is right end.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nIn the problem:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T: [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: span at T: [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in the span at time T for the freeway we are on.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's list the cars.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, cars: (36, 25, right, 6), (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nBoth right-moving.\n\nFreeway 2: y=2, same as y=1: (36, 25, right, 6), (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 3: y=3, (48, 1, right, 48)  // head 48, tail 1? Tail is 1, head 48, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so at τ=0, span [1,48]\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, (48, 1, right, 48) same\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, (0, -11, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, same as y=5\n\nFreeway 7: y=7, same as y=5\n\nFreeway 8: y=8, (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nNow, I am at y=4 at τ=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is safe, but I start at 4, need to go up.\n\nTo minimize turns, I want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see when each freeway has 0 in some car's span.\n\nFor a given freeway and time τ, collision if for some car on that freeway, 0 in [low, high] of the span.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, for each car, at time τ, low = tail + s*τ, high = head + s*τ, and 0 in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving, I think.\n\nIn the list, all directions are right, so only right-moving cars.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: car A: (h=36, t=25, d=right, s=6) so at τ, low = 25 + 6τ, high = 36 + 6τ\n\nCar B: (h=-30, t=-41, d=right, s=6), low = -41 + 6τ, high = -30 + 6τ\n\n0 in [low, high] for car A: 25 + 6τ <= 0 <= 36 + 6τ? 25+6τ <=0 is impossible since τ>=0, 25+6τ >=25>0, so 0 < low, so 0 not in [low,high] for car A.\n\nFor car B: low = -41 + 6τ, high = -30 + 6τ\n\n0 in [low, high] if -41 + 6τ <= 0 <= -30 + 6τ\n\nWhich is -41 + 6τ <= 0 and 0 <= -30 + 6τ\n\nSo 6τ <= 41, τ <= 41/6 ≈6.833\n\nAnd 6τ >= 30, τ >=5\n\nSo for τ in [5, 6.833], approximately, but τ integer, so τ=5,6\n\nFor τ=5: low = -41+30= -11, high= -30+30=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included, so collision if on freeway at τ=5.\n\nFor τ=6: low= -41+36= -5, high= -30+36=6, [ -5,6], 0 in it.\n\nτ=7: low= -41+42=1, high= -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in, since 0<1.\n\nSimilarly, car A never has 0 in span.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same cars, so same, collision at τ=5,6.\n\nNow freeway 3: one car (48,1,right,48)\n\nAt τ, low = 1 + 48τ, high=48 + 48τ\n\n1+48τ >0 for τ>=0, so low >0, 0 not in [low,high], no collision ever.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, no collision.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars.\n\nCar C: (0,-11,right,12) so h=0, t=-11, s=12\n\nAt τ, low = -11 +12τ, high=0 +12τ\n\n0 in [low,high] if -11+12τ <=0 <= 0+12τ\n\nWhich is -11+12τ <=0 and 0 <= 12τ\n\n12τ <=11? τ <=11/12<1, but τ integer >=0, so τ=0: low=-11, high=0, [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nτ=0: high=0, so 0 in [low,high], yes.\n\nAlso, 0 <= 12τ always for τ>=0, but -11+12τ <=0 only for τ<=11/12<1, so only τ=0.\n\nτ=0: low=-11+0=-11, high=0+0=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nτ=1: low=-11+12=1, high=0+12=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision only at τ=0 for this car.\n\nCar D: (36,25,right,12) low=25+12τ, high=36+12τ, both >0, 0 not in, no collision.\n\nCar E: (-48,-59,right,12) low=-59+12τ, high=-48+12τ\n\n0 in if -59+12τ <=0 <= -48+12τ\n\nSo -59+12τ <=0 and 0 <= -48+12τ\n\n12τ <=59, τ <=59/12≈4.916\n\n12τ >=48, τ>=4\n\nSo τ=4,5? τ integer.\n\nτ=4: low=-59+48= -11, high=-48+48=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=5: low=-59+60=1, high=-48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=4 only? τ=4: high=0, included.\n\nτ=5: low=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for car E, collision at τ=4.\n\nNow for freeway 5 at τ=0: car C causes collision, since at τ=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=4, car E causes collision.\n\nOther times? Car D never.\n\nSo freeway 5 collision at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 same as 5, collision at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nFreeway 7 same, collision τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nNow freeway 8: (48,1,right,48) same as freeway 3, no collision ever.\n\nSummary of collision times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: collision at τ=5,6\n\ny=2: collision at τ=5,6\n\ny=3: no collision\n\ny=4: no collision\n\ny=5: collision at τ=0,4\n\ny=6: collision at τ=0,4\n\ny=7: collision at τ=0,4\n\ny=8: no collision\n\ny=9: safe\n\ny=0: safe, but not freeway.\n\nNow, I start at τ=0, y=4.\n\nAt τ=0, y=4, which is freeway 4, no collision, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible paths: I can go directly up, but need to pass through y=5,6,7,8.\n\ny=5,6,7 have collision at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nAt τ=0, y=5,6,7 are unsafe, but I am not on them yet.\n\nAt τ=0, I am on y=4, safe.\n\nIf I want to go up, I can choose action at τ=0.\n\nAction a0: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, then y1 = 5.\n\nBut at τ=1, if I am on y=5, is it safe?\n\nFor y=5, collision only at τ=0 and τ=4, not at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7.\n\nτ=1: for y=5, at τ=1, no collision, since collision only at 0 and 4.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7 same.\n\ny=8 no collision.\n\nSo at τ=1, if I am on y=5, it should be safe, since no car has 0 in span at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly for other y.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nFor example, y=5 at τ=1: cars at τ=1.\n\nCar C: low = -11 +12*1 =1, high=0+12=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar E: at τ=1, low=-59+12= -47, high=-48+12= -36? high=-48+12= -36, low=-59+12= -47, so [ -47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nCar D: [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, safe at τ=1 for y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=2,3, etc., except τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nτ=4: collision.\n\nNow, back to action.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=4.\n\nI can choose U to go to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nOr S to stay at y=4 at τ=1.\n\nOr D to go to y=3 at τ=1.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3, no collision ever, so safe.\n\nBut I need to go up, so down might not help, but I might wait to avoid bad times.\n\nSince y=4 is always safe, I can stay.\n\nBut to minimize turns, I should go up when possible.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, but I need to be on y=8 or something to go up.\n\nThe minimal y-change is 5 up moves.\n\nWith possible waits.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are when I am on y=5,6,7 at τ=4, or on y=1,2 at τ=5,6.\n\nBut y=1,2 are not on my direct path, since I start at 4, go to 5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=1 and 2 are below, I don't need to go there, unless I detour down.\n\nBut going down might increase the number of turns, so probably not minimal, since I can wait on safe lanes.\n\nFor example, y=3,4,8 are always safe.\n\ny=3 and 4 no collision, y=8 no collision.\n\ny=5,6,7 unsafe only at τ=4.\n\nτ=4 is a problem time for y=5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, τ=5,6 for y=1,2, but I don't care since I won't be there.\n\nNow, I start at τ=0, y=4.\n\nI can go up immediately.\n\nOption: at τ=0, action U: then at τ=1, y=5.\n\nAt τ=1, y=5 is safe, as above.\n\nThen I need to go to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nAt τ=1, I can choose U to go to y=6 at τ=2.\n\ny=6 at τ=2: is it safe?\n\ny=6 collision only at τ=0 and τ=4, not at τ=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=7 at τ=3.\n\ny=7 at τ=3: collision only at 0 and 4, so τ=3 safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=8: is it safe?\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, which has no collision ever, so safe at any time.\n\nThen U to y=9 at τ=5.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, at τ=4, when I am on y=8, it is safe.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nStart τ=0, y=4, safe.\n\nAction U: move to y=5 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=5, safe.\n\nAction U: move to y=6 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=6, safe.\n\nAction U: move to y=7 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=7, safe.\n\nAction U: move to y=8 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=8, safe (since y=8 always safe).\n\nAction U: move to y=9 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=9, safe, reached.\n\nSo in 5 actions, I reach at τ=5 with y=5? No.\n\nAt τ=0: y=4\n\nAfter a0=U: at τ=1, y=5\n\nAfter a1=U: at τ=2, y=6\n\nAfter a2=U: at τ=3, y=7\n\nAfter a3=U: at τ=4, y=8\n\nAfter a4=U: at τ=5, y=9\n\nSo at τ=5, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check collisions: at each turn, the freeway we are on.\n\nAt τ=0: y=4, freeway 4, no collision, safe.\n\nAt τ=1: y=5, freeway 5, at τ=1, no collision, safe.\n\nAt τ=2: y=6, freeway 6, at τ=2, no collision, safe.\n\nAt τ=3: y=7, freeway 7, at τ=3, no collision (only τ=0,4), safe.\n\nAt τ=4: y=8, freeway 8, no collision ever, safe.\n\nAt τ=5: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nSo all safe, and I reached in 5 turns relative, from τ=0 to τ=5.\n\nNumber of actions: 5 actions, from a0 to a4.\n\nIn terms of H: since we reach at turn t1 + H -1, relative τ=H-1.\n\nHere τ=5, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1=5, so 6 actions? Let's see.\n\nReach at τ=5, which is relative turn 5.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, reach at τ=H-1.\n\nSo here reach at τ=5, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nActions: a0 to a5.\n\nBut in my sequence, I have actions up to a4 to reach at τ=5.\n\na4 is applied at τ=4 to set y5=9.\n\nThen at τ=5, I am at y=9.\n\nBut I need to specify action at τ=5? No, actions are from τ=0 to H-1, and H-1=5, so action at τ=5.\n\nBut at τ=5, I am already at y=9, so I can choose a5=S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to include it.\n\nIn my path, I only used 5 actions to move from y4 to y9, but with H=6, I have an extra action at the end.\n\nBut since I reach at τ=5, and for τ=5, I need to be there, then a5 can be S.\n\nSimilarly, in the minimal, I have 5 moves, but H includes the actions including the one at the reaching turn.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's list the actions for the turns.\n\nIn this case, with actions: at τ=0: U, go to y=5 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: U, to y=6 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: U, to y=7 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: U, to y=8 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: U, to y=9 at τ=5\n\nThen at τ=5, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, with reach at τ=H-1.\n\nHere τ=H-1=5, so H=6.\n\nActions: a0 to a5.\n\nBut a5 is at τ=5, when I am at y=9.\n\nI need to specify a5, which can be S, for example.\n\nThen y6=9, but I don't care.\n\nSimilarly, in the collision, at τ=5, y=9, safe.\n\nSo with H=6, actions: U, U, U, U, U, and then at τ=5, S or whatever, but to stay, S.\n\nBut in the sequence, since I reach at τ=5, and a5 is after, but it's included.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster.\n\nIs it possible in less than 5 moves?\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, minimum 5 up moves, no way less, since each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo minimum 5 actions to change position, but with H, since we include action at reaching turn.\n\nWith 5 actions: a0 to a4, I reach at τ=5.\n\nWith 4 actions, I can be at most y=8 at τ=4, not 9.\n\nFor example, a0 to a3: after 4 actions, at τ=4, y could be 8 if all U, but not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at τ=4, I need to start from y=4, so in 4 actions, I can gain at most 4, to y=8, or less.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before τ=5.\n\nSo minimum reach at τ=5.\n\nAnd with the above, I can do it directly without collision.\n\nIn the above, at τ=4, I am at y=8, which is safe, and I go to y=9 at τ=5.\n\nBut is there a problem at τ=4 for other lanes?\n\nNo, I am on y=8, safe.\n\nIn the path, I passed y=5 at τ=1, which is safe, y=6 at τ=2 safe, y=7 at τ=3 safe.\n\ny=7 at τ=3: freeway 7, at τ=3, no collision, since collision only at τ=0 and τ=4 for y=7.\n\nτ=4 for y=7 has collision, but I am not on y=7 at τ=4, I am on y=8 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo it seems I can reach in 5 actions? But with H.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=6, actions: τ=0: U, τ=1: U, τ=2: U, τ=3: U, τ=4: U, τ=5: S (since at y=9, stay)\n\nBut τ=5 action is after reaching, but we need to specify.\n\nSince we reach at τ=5, and action at τ=5 can be specified.\n\nBut to minimize H, H=6 with 6 actions.\n\nBut the number of turns to reach is 5, from τ=0 to τ=5, 5 steps.\n\nBut in terms of H, it should be minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=5, meaning reach at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, can I be at y=9?\n\nFrom y=4 at τ=0, to y=9 at τ=4, I need to gain 5 in 4 steps, impossible, since max +1 per step.\n\nSo y at τ=4 at most 8.\n\nCannot reach at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, only possible at τ=5 or later.\n\nBut with waiting, later.\n\nSo minimal at τ=5.\n\nAnd with above, I can do it.\n\nBut in the car state, for y=5,6,7, at τ=4, they have collision.\n\nBut in my path, I am not on them at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, I am on y=8, safe.\n\nNow, but let me confirm the car for freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: car (48,1,right,48), at any τ, low=1+48τ, high=48+48τ, both large positive, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I can go directly up in 5 moves.\n\nBut in the action sequence, with H=6.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter sequence by not moving sometimes, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point, H larger.\n\nSo minimal H should be 6.\n\nH=6, reach at τ=5.\n\nActions: for τ=0 to 5.\n\nBut τ=0 to 5 is 6 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at times t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nWith H=6, t from 0 to 5.\n\nActions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+5}\n\nBut in relative, actions at τ=0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nAt τ=0: action U, to y=5 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: action U, to y=6 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: action U, to y=7 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: action U, to y=8 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: action U, to y=9 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: action S, to stay at y=9 for τ=6, but we don't care.\n\nSince at τ=5, y=9, reached.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list the actions for the turns.\n\nBut at τ=5, I need to specify an action, which can be S.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nPerhaps I can have the last action be the one that brings me to 9, and no action after.\n\nBut in the format, I think I have to include H actions.\n\nAnother thing: in the collision note, it says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nIn my case, for example, at τ=0, I move to y=5, so at τ=0, I am on y=4, not on y=5.\n\nAt τ=1, I am on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, for τ=4, I move to y=9 at τ=5, so at τ=4, I am on y=8, not on y=9.\n\ny=9 not freeway, so ok.\n\nNow, but let me check if at τ=4, on y=8, safe.\n\nIs there any car on y=8 at τ=4? Freeway 8, car (48,1,right,48), at τ=4, low=1+48*4=1+192=193, high=48+192=240, [193,240], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other times, no issue.\n\nSo it should work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, at τ=0, there is collision, but at τ=0, I am on y=4, not on y=5, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier, impossible.\n\nOr with same H, but different, but not necessary.\n\nBut there is a issue: at τ=4, for y=5,6,7, there is collision, but if I were on them, but I am not.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5,6,7, at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nBut in my path, at τ=4, I am on y=8.\n\nBut what if I go slower.\n\nFor example, suppose I stay at y=4 for some turns.\n\nBut that would delay, so not minimal.\n\nSuppose I go down to y=3, but then I need to come back, more moves.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? Let's see.\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H\"\n\nAnd \"sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1\"\n\nWith reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, relative, reach at τ=5, so t1 + H -1 = t1 + 5, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nActions from τ=0 to 5.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output actions for each turn.\n\nBut at τ=5, action is after reaching, but we have to specify.\n\nPerhaps I can set the actions so that I reach at τ=5 with the last action at τ=4.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at τ=0 to 4: all U, then at τ=5, I am at y=9, and I specify a5=S.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be fine.\n\nTo save an action, but I cannot.\n\nAnother point: at τ=0, I am at y=4, and I go up.\n\nBut is there a reason to wait?\n\nFor example, if at τ=0, I stay, then at τ=1, y=4, then I can go up to y=5 at τ=2.\n\nBut then I reach later.\n\nFor example, if I stay at τ=0, S, then at τ=1, y=4.\n\nThen U to y=5 at τ=2.\n\nThen to y=6 at τ=3, y=7 at τ=4, but at τ=4, if I go to y=7? At τ=4, y=7 has collision, so I cannot be on y=7 at τ=4.\n\nIn this case: if at τ=1, y=4, action U, to y=5 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=5, safe (since τ=2 not collision time for y=5).\n\nThen U to y=6 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=6, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, if I am on y=7, collision, unsafe.\n\nIf at τ=3, I go to y=8, but from y=6, U to y=7 at τ=4? At τ=3, if I am at y=6, action U, then to y=7 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, I am on y=7, which for freeway 7, at τ=4, collision, since car E or something has span including 0.\n\nFor example, freeway 7 at τ=4: similar to y=5.\n\nCar E: at τ=4, low=-59+48= -11? s=12, τ=4, low=-59+48= -11? -59 + 12*4 = -59 + 48 = -11, high= -48 + 48 =0, so [ -11,0], 0 in, collision.\n\nSo if on y=7 at τ=4, collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=5,6,7 at τ=4.\n\nIn my first path, I am on y=8 at τ=4, which is safe.\n\nIf I try to go slower, I might be forced to be on y=7 at τ=4.\n\nFor example, if I start later.\n\nBut in the direct path, I avoid it by being on y=8 at τ=4.\n\nIf I go down to y=3, say.\n\nAt τ=0, action D, to y=3 at τ=1.\n\ny=3 safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, I can go U to y=4 at τ=2, or to y=2, etc., but then it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, from y=3 at τ=1, U to y=4 at τ=2, then U to y=5 at τ=3, etc., but at τ=4, I might be on y=6 or something.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to go up, so being lower might not help.\n\nSince y=4 is safe, I can stay at y=4 during τ=4 if needed, but τ=4 is time, not position.\n\nAt time τ=4, if I am on y=4, it is safe, since no collision.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, suppose at τ=0, I stay S, y=4 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, stay S, y=4 at τ=2.\n\nτ=2, S, y=4 at τ=3.\n\nτ=3, S, y=4 at τ=4. At τ=4, on y=4, safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, action U, to y=5 at τ=5.\n\nBut at τ=5, y=5, is it safe?\n\ny=5 at τ=5: collision times for y=5 are τ=0 and τ=4, not τ=5, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at τ=6, safe since τ=6 not 0 or 4.\n\nSimilarly to y=7 at τ=7, y=8 at τ=8, y=9 at τ=9.\n\nBut this takes 9 turns, worse.\n\nTo avoid τ=4, I can be on safe lane at τ=4.\n\nIn my first path, I am on y=8 at τ=4, safe.\n\nI could be on y=3 or y=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut since I need to go up, being on y=8 is better.\n\nIn first path, I reach at τ=5.\n\nIf I go directly, it works.\n\nBut in the beginning, for freeway 1 and 2, at τ=5 and 6, collision, but I am not on them, so ok.\n\nNow, in my sequence, at τ=5, I am at y=9, which is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the action at τ=5.\n\nIn the sequence, I need action for τ=5.\n\nSince I am at y=9, I can choose S.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to move.\n\nBut in the format, I have to include it.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and I think H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut is there a way with H=5?\n\nH=5, then reach at τ=H-1=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y must be 9, but from y=4 at τ=0, impossible to gain 5 in 4 steps.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus minimal H=6.\n\nNow, sequence: actions at relative τ=0 to 5:\n\nτ=0: U\n\nτ=1: U\n\nτ=2: U\n\nτ=3: U\n\nτ=4: U\n\nτ=5: S\n\nIn absolute terms, turns t1=23 to t1+5=28.\n\nBut in the answer, list for each turn.\n\nNow, but in the car state, I think I missed something.\n\nFreeway 4: at τ=0, I am on it, no collision.\n\nBut is there any car on freeway 4?\n\nFreeway 4 has car (48,1,right,48), at τ=0, span [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 5,6,7 at τ=0, collision, but I am not on them.\n\nIn the path, when I go to y=5 at τ=1, no issue.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U  (since t1, τ=0)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + 5: a_{t_1 + 5} = S\n\nt1=23.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nBut at turn 28, action S, position at turn 29 is y=9, but we reach at turn t1 + H -1 = 23 + 6 -1 = 28, so at turn 28, position should be 9.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAt turn 23: start, y=4\n\nAfter a23=U, at turn 24, y=5\n\nAfter a24=U, turn 25, y=6\n\na25=U, turn 26, y=7\n\na26=U, turn 27, y=8\n\na27=U, turn 28, y=9\n\nThen at turn 28, y=9, reached.\n\nThen a28=S, at turn 29, y=9.\n\nBut we reach at turn 28, so for turn 28, position is y=9.\n\nAction at turn 28 is applied after, but we include it.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 28, we specify a28=S, which is fine.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but we have to.\n\nSince at turn 28, we are at y=9, and we can choose not to move, so S.\n\nNow, I think it's correct.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: S\n\n}\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 27, when I am on y=8, is it safe?\n\nTurn 27 absolute, relative τ=4, since t1=23, τ= t - 23.\n\nAt turn 27, τ=4, y=8, freeway 8, no collision, safe.\n\nAt turn 28, y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter sequence by not having the last S, but H would be less, but I cannot reach earlier.\n\nAnother idea: if I go faster, impossible.\n\nOr if I start by going down, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, D to y=3 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, U to y=4 at τ=2, etc., but then to reach y=9, I need more steps.\n\nFor instance, from y=3 at τ=1, to y=9 at τ=6, with U,U,U,U,U, but at τ=5, y=8? Start from y=3 at τ=1, after 4 U: at τ=5, y=7, then U to y=8 at τ=6, U to y=9 at τ=7, reach at τ=7, later than 5.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the direct path is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the output, for turn t1 + H -1 =28, we have action, which is S.\n\nPerhaps I can set the last action to be U or something, but since at turn 28, y=9, if I U, invalid, so must S or D, S is fine.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 23\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 6, meaning the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 23 + 6 - 1 = 28\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 23, move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 24.\n- At turn 24, move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 25.\n- At turn 25, move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 26.\n- At turn 26, move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 27.\n- At turn 27, move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 28.\n- At turn 28, stay at \\(y = 9\\) (action \\(S\\)) since the goal is reached.\n\nCollision avoidance is verified for each turn:\n- Turn 23 (\\(y = 4\\)): Freeway 4 has no collision at any time (car span [1 + 48τ, 48 + 48τ] never contains 0 for τ ≥ 0).\n- Turn 24 (\\(y = 5\\)): Freeway 5 has collisions only at τ = 0 and τ = 4 relative to turn 23. At τ = 1 (turn 24), no collision (car spans: [1, 12], [-47, -36], [37, 48] for cars, none contain 0).\n- Turn 25 (\\(y = 6\\)): Freeway 6 has collisions only at τ = 0 and τ = 4. At τ = 2 (turn 25), no collision (similar to freeway 5 at τ=2).\n- Turn 26 (\\(y = 7\\)): Freeway 7 has collisions only at τ = 0 and τ = 4. At τ = 3 (turn 26), no collision (similar to freeway 5 at τ=3).\n- Turn 27 (\\(y = 8\\)): Freeway 8 has no collision at any time (car span [1 + 48τ, 48 + 48τ] never contains 0).\n- Turn 28 (\\(y = 9\\)): Not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in minimal turns (\\(H = 6\\)) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway, and they move left or right at constant speeds. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes linearly with time.\n\nAlso, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn, so at turn T, they are on y_T, and they choose an action to go to y_{T+1}. So for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T and the car positions at turn T.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is above the freeways, so once I'm at y=9, I'm safe, I think. y=9 is the top, and freeways are from y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, but I start at y=5 and need to get to y=9.\n\ny=0 might be the bottom, but since there are no freeways at y=0 or y=9, I assume no cars there, so safe.\n\nNow, the current turn is t1 = 24, and player is at (0,5).\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to get to y=9 with minimal H, meaning minimal number of turns.\n\nFirst, since I need to go from y=5 to y=9, that's a difference of 4, so if I could go straight up, it would take 4 turns: U,U,U,U to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I might hit cars on the way, so I need to check for each freeway I cross whether at the time I'm on it, there's a car covering x=0.\n\nThe collision is only at x=0, since the player is always at x=0, I think. The position is (0, y_t), so x=0 always.\n\nAnd for each freeway y, if I'm on that y at turn T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThe span is the set of x positions covered by the car.\n\nNow, cars are moving, so I need to compute for each freeway and each car, when 0 is covered.\n\nBut since the cars move linearly, I can find the times when 0 is covered for each car.\n\nBut for a given freeway, if any car has 0 in span at time T, then it's dangerous at that turn.\n\nIf multiple cars, but if any one covers, it's bad.\n\nNow, since I move vertically, and cars move horizontally, the key is to avoid being on a freeway y at a turn when for that y, x=0 is occupied.\n\nNow, let's list all the freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8.\n\nFrom the table:\n\ny=1: cars: (42,31,right,6) and (-24,-35,right,6)\n\ny=2: same as y=1? \"2 | (42, 31, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\" so identical to y=1.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 both have the same cars? That might be possible, or is it a typo?\n\nSimilarly, y=3: (96,49,right,48)\n\ny=4: same, (96,49,right,48)\n\ny=5: (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12)\n\ny=6: same as y=5\n\ny=7: same as y=5\n\ny=8: (96,49,right,48)\n\ny=3,4,8 all have the same car? (96,49,right,48)\n\ny=1 and y=2 same.\n\ny=5,6,7 same.\n\nNow, for each car, I need to find when x=0 is covered.\n\nFirst, let's define the span.\n\nFor a car, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nFor right-moving: span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] because at t1, span is [τ, h] for right, since head is larger? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: but all cars here are right-moving, I think. Direction is given as \"right\" for all.\n\nIn the table, all directions are \"right\", so all moving right.\n\nFor right-moving: at turn t1, span is [τ, h], and at turn T, span is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving it would decrease, but here all right.\n\nSo for right-moving car: position at time T: the tail is at τ + s(T - t1), head at h + s(T - t1), so the span is from min to max, but since it's moving right, and h > τ, I assume, so span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nx=0 is covered if 0 is between τ + s(T-t1) and h + s(T-t1), inclusive.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nNow, t1 is 24, current turn.\n\nSet t = T - t1, so t is the number of turns after current, starting from t=0.\n\nAt turn t1, t=0.\n\nSo for a car, at time t (relative), the span is [τ + s t, h + s t] for right-moving.\n\nx=0 covered if τ + s t ≤ 0 ≤ h + s t.\n\nSince h and τ, for right-moving, h is the head, which should be the right end, so h > τ, so the span is from τ to h, so min τ, max h.\n\nSo 0 covered when τ + s t ≤ 0 ≤ h + s t.\n\nNow, for each car, I can solve for t when this is true.\n\nBut it might be true for a interval of t.\n\nt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nSimilarly, for the player, at each future turn, when on a freeway, need to avoid if for that y, any car has 0 covered.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1: two cars.\n\nCar A: (h=42, τ=31, d=right, s=6) at t1.\n\nAt time t, span [31 + 6t, 42 + 6t]\n\n0 covered if 31 + 6t ≤ 0 ≤ 42 + 6t\n\nSolve: 31 + 6t ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 42 + 6t\n\nFirst: 31 + 6t ≤ 0 => 6t ≤ -31 => t ≤ -31/6 ≈ -5.166, so t ≤ -6 since t integer? t is relative to t1, so t >=0 for future, but the inequality might hold for past t, but we care about future t>=0.\n\nt = T - t1, T >= t1, so t >=0.\n\nSo for t>=0, 31 + 6t >= 31 >0, so 31 + 6t <=0 is false for t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 42 + 6t is always true for t>=0.\n\nBut 31 + 6t <=0 and 0<=42+6t, but 31+6t >=31>0 for t>=0, so the first inequality false, thus 0 never covered for t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, the other car on y=1: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nh=-24, τ=-35? Tail τ=-35, head h=-24.\n\nSince right-moving, at t1, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? But -35 < -24, so min τ, max h, so span from -35 to -24.\n\nAt time t, span [ -35 + 6t, -24 + 6t ]\n\n0 covered if -35 + 6t <= 0 <= -24 + 6t\n\nWhich is -35 + 6t <=0 and 0 <= -24 + 6t\n\nFirst: -35 + 6t <=0 => 6t <=35 => t <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, so t <=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 6t => 6t >=24 => t >=4\n\nSo for t=4,5\n\nAt t=4: span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], so 0 covered.\n\nt=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nt=6: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not covered since 1>0.\n\nSo for y=1, car B covers x=0 at t=4 and t=5 relative.\n\nt=4 and t=5.\n\nBut car A never covers, so for y=1, dangerous at t=4 and t=5.\n\nt relative to now, t=0 is turn 24.\n\nSo at absolute turn T = t1 + t = 24 + t.\n\nSo for y=1, dangerous when player on y=1 at T=24+4=28 or T=29? t=4 and t=5, so T=28 and 29.\n\nT = t1 + t = 24 + t.\n\nAt t=4, T=28; t=5, T=29.\n\nNow, freeway y=2: same cars as y=1, so also dangerous at T=28 and 29.\n\nNow, freeway y=3: one car (96,49,right,48)\n\nh=96, τ=49, d=right, s=48\n\nAt t, span [49 + 48t, 96 + 48t]\n\n0 covered if 49 + 48t <=0 <=96 +48t\n\n49+48t <=0? 48t <= -49, t <= -49/48 ≈ -1.02, so for t>=0, false.\n\n0<=96+48t always true, but first inequality false, so never covered for t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 same car, same thing, never covered.\n\ny=4 has same as y=3, so safe.\n\nNow y=5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12)\n\nh=12, τ=1, at t1.\n\nAt t, span [1 + 12t, 12 + 12t]\n\n0 covered if 1 + 12t <=0 <=12 +12t\n\n1+12t <=0? 12t <= -1, t <= -1/12 <0, false for t>=0\n\n0<=12+12t always true, so never covered.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nh=48, τ=37\n\nAt t, span [37+12t, 48+12t]\n\n0 covered: 37+12t <=0 <=48+12t\n\n37+12t <=0? 12t <= -37, t <= -37/12≈ -3.08, false for t>=0\n\nNever covered.\n\nThird car: (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nh=-36, τ=-47\n\nAt t, span [-47 +12t, -36 +12t]\n\n0 covered if -47 +12t <=0 <= -36 +12t\n\nWhich is -47 +12t <=0 and 0 <= -36 +12t\n\nFirst: -47+12t <=0 => 12t <=47 => t <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so t <=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +12t => 12t >=36 => t >=3\n\nSo for t=3: span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], 0 covered.\n\nt=4: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSo only at t=3.\n\nThus for y=5, dangerous only at t=3, T=24+3=27.\n\nNow, y=6 same as y=5, so also dangerous at T=27.\n\ny=7 same, dangerous at T=27.\n\nNow y=8: (96,49,right,48) same as y=3, which we saw never covers 0, so safe.\n\ny=8 has one car, same as y=3, which doesn't cover 0, so y=8 is always safe.\n\nSummarize dangerous times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: dangerous at T=28,29\n\ny=2: same, T=28,29\n\ny=3: safe (no danger)\n\ny=4: safe\n\ny=5: dangerous at T=27\n\ny=6: dangerous at T=27\n\ny=7: dangerous at T=27\n\ny=8: safe\n\nNow, player starts at y=5 at t1=24.\n\nNeed to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe player can move U, D, S each turn.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nCurrent position: at T=24, y=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway, and at T=24, is it dangerous? T=24 is current turn, t=0.\n\nFor y=5, dangerous at T=27, not at T=24.\n\nAt T=24, for y=5, we need to check if dangerous now.\n\nt=0 relative.\n\nFor y=5, at t=0: car spans.\n\nFirst car: [1+0,12+0] = [1,12], not cover 0.\n\nSecond: [37,48], not.\n\nThird: [-47,-36], not cover 0, since -47 to -36, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=0, y=5 is safe.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are only for y=1,2 at T=28,29 and y=5,6,7 at T=27.\n\ny=5,6,7 dangerous at T=27.\n\ny=1,2 dangerous at T=28,29.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=5 to y=9, which is up 4 units.\n\nIf I go up every turn: actions U,U,U,U at t=0,1,2,3 relative.\n\nStart: T=24, y=5, action a_t1 = a_24\n\nAfter action, y changes.\n\nLet’s define the sequence.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T, then chooses action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + delta y.\n\nAt turn T, position is (0, y_T), and we are on freeway y_T if 1<=y_T<=8.\n\nThen for collision at turn T, we check if on that freeway, cars cover x=0 at turn T.\n\nThen we move to next turn.\n\nTo reach y=9, at some turn H, y_H =9.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting point? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H-1 actions, we reach at turn t1 + H -1? Let's clarify.\n\nCurrent turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta y_{t1}\n\nSimilarly, after k actions, at turn t1 + k, position y_{t1+k}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFrom the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, but we need to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nLet's read:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1 + H -1\n\nAfter these actions, the position is at turn t1 + H? No.\n\nAt turn t1, before any action, position is given.\n\nThen after action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}\n\nSimilarly, after action a_{t1 + k}, at turn t1 + k +1, position y_{t1 + k +1}\n\nAfter all actions up to a_{t1 + H -1}, we are at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H\n\nBut we need to reach at turn t1 + H -1? Confusion.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"after actions from t=0 to H-1\", meaning after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut it says reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nBut after actions from t=0 to H-1, which are at times t1 to t1+H-1, the position after these actions is at turn t1+H.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter 1 action (H=1, t=0 only), at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}\n\nWe want this to be (0,9).\n\nBut the reach turn is t1+H-1.\n\nIf H=1, reach at t1 +1 -1 = t1, but at t1, we are at (0,5), not (0,9), so we need actions.\n\nGenerally, to reach at turn T, we need to have taken actions from t1 to T-1, and at turn T, we are at (0,9).\n\nHere, reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo let T_reach = t1 + H -1\n\nThen at turn T_reach, y_{T_reach} =9.\n\nThe actions are from turn t1 to T_reach -1, because action at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta a_t.\n\nSo to have y_{T} =9 for some T, we need to have taken actions from t1 to T-1.\n\nNumber of actions is (T - t1).\n\nThen H, the number of turns? The minimal H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet k = H -1, then y_{t1 + k} =9, and k is the number of actions taken? Let's see.\n\nIf y_{t1 + k} =9, then we took k actions from t1 to t1 + k -1.\n\nThen the reach turn is t1 + k, and H is defined such that t1 + H -1 = t1 + k, so H-1 = k, thus H = k +1.\n\nNumber of actions is k, number of \"turns\" H = k +1, which includes the starting turn.\n\nIn terms of time, from turn t1 to turn t1 + k, with k actions.\n\nBut H is the minimal number such that at turn t1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nFor simplicity, let's work with relative time t, from t=0 (now, turn t1=24).\n\nAt t=0, y=5.\n\nWe want for some t_future, y_t =9.\n\nt is number of turns from now, so at absolute turn T = t1 + t.\n\ny_t is position at time t relative.\n\nAt time t (relative), position y_t.\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + delta a_t.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThen H = T +1? Let's define.\n\nSet t relative: at t=0, y=5.\n\nAfter action a_0 at t=0, y_1 at t=1, and so on.\n\nWe want y_H =9 for some H, meaning after H steps from now.\n\nThen the reach absolute turn is t1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's use the relative t.\n\nLet t be the step, starting from t=0.\n\nAt relative time t, position y_t.\n\nAt t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at t=0, y_0 =5.\n\nWe want y_K =9 for some K, with minimal K.\n\nThen the actions are from t=0 to t=K-1, total K actions.\n\nThen H, the number of turns, is K? The sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nThen after H actions, we are at y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9? But the reach turn is t1 + H -1.\n\nAt relative time H, absolute turn t1 + H.\n\nBut reach at t1 + H -1, which is absolute turn.\n\nSet the reach relative time as T, so y_T =9.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to T-1, total T actions.\n\nThen H = T, because number of turns H such that at turn t1 + H -1, y=9, so relative time H-1, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nI think I need to stick to the problem definition.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nMinimal H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1: a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nFor example, if H=1, then y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =5, not 9.\n\nIf H=2, y_{t1 +2-1} = y_{t1+1}, which is after one action.\n\nSo to reach at turn S = t1 + H -1, we need to have taken actions from t1 to S-1.\n\nNumber of actions is (S - t1) = (t1 + H -1 - t1) = H-1.\n\nAnd S - t1 = H-1.\n\nIn terms of relative time, let s = S - t1, so we reach at relative time s with y_s =9.\n\ns = H-1.\n\nThen actions from relative t=0 to t=s-1.\n\nH = s +1.\n\nSince we start at t=0, y_0=5.\n\nWe want y_s =9 for some s.\n\nThen H = s +1.\n\nMinimal H means minimal s, since H=s+1.\n\nSo we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible, in minimal steps.\n\ns minimal such that y_s=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=s-1.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nStart at y=5, t=0.\n\nDangerous times absolute, but since t1=24, relative t, dangerous at:\n\nFor y=1 and y=2: dangerous at T=28 and 29, relative t= T - t1 = 28-24=4, and 29-24=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7 dangerous at T=27, relative t=27-24=3.\n\ny=3,4,8 always safe.\n\ny=9 safe, y=0 safe but not target.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=5 to y=9 in min steps.\n\nPossible to go up directly, but need to avoid being on y=5,6,7 at t=3, and y=1,2 at t=4,5.\n\nSince I start at y=5 at t=0.\n\nIf I go up immediately:\n\nOption 1: U at t=0, then y1=6 at t=1\n\nThen U at t=1, y2=7 at t=2\n\nU at t=2, y3=8 at t=3\n\nU at t=3, y4=9 at t=4\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=0, y=5, not dangerous since dangerous only at t=3, but t=0 is now, safe as we checked.\n\nAt t=1, y=6, which is freeway, need to check if dangerous at t=1.\n\nFor y=6, dangerous only at t=3 (relative), since T=27, t=3.\n\nAt t=1, T=25, not dangerous, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=2, y=7, dangerous at t=3, not at t=2, safe.\n\nAt t=3, y=8, which is safe, since y=8 always safe.\n\nThen at t=4, y=9, reached.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nNow, at t=3, we are on y=8, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on freeways at t=0: y=5, safe; t=1: y=6, safe; t=2: y=7, safe; t=3: y=8, safe; then t=4 y=9.\n\nBut y=6 and y=7 are dangerous at t=3, but at t=1 and t=2, not dangerous, so ok.\n\nIn this path, we never are on y=5,6,7 at t=3, nor on y=1,2 at t=4 or5.\n\nAt t=3 we are on y=8, safe.\n\nt=4 y=9.\n\nSo this seems fine, and we reach in 4 steps: from y=5 to9 in 4 moves, at relative time t=4, y=9.\n\ns=4, H=s+1=5? Let's see.\n\nReach at relative time s=4, y=9.\n\nThen H=s+1=5.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=3.\n\nIn absolute terms: reach at turn t1 + s = 24 + 4 = 28.\n\nt1 + H -1 =24 +5-1=28, yes.\n\nNumber of turns H=5, meaning from turn 24 to 28, with actions at 24,25,26,27.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn 24 (t=0), start y=5, action a_{24}, then y_{25} = y_{24} + delta a_{24}\n\nAfter a_{24}, at turn 25, y=6\n\nThen a_{25}, turn 26, y=7\n\na_{26}, turn 27, y=8\n\na_{27}, turn 28, y=9\n\nReach at turn 28, which is t1 + H -1 =24 +5-1=28, yes.\n\nNow, is there a way to do in fewer than 4 steps?\n\nMinimal steps: from y=5 to y=9, difference 4, so at least 4 up moves, but since we can stay or go down, but going down would take more steps, so minimal is 4 steps if possible.\n\nCan we do in 3 steps? y_3=9.\n\ny_0=5, y_3=9, so net change +4 in 3 moves, so must have three U, no S or D, since U gives +1, S 0, D -1.\n\nSo actions must be U,U,U.\n\nThen y1=6, y2=7, y3=8? y0=5, a0=U, y1=6; a1=U, y2=7; a2=U, y3=8, not 9.\n\ny3=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 in 3 steps, need y3=9.\n\ny0=5, after three actions.\n\nIf all U: y1=6, y2=7, y3=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nIf two U and one S, e.g. U,U,S: y1=6, y2=7, y3=7.\n\nNot 9.\n\nU,S,U: y1=6, y2=6, y3=7.\n\nNo.\n\nS,U,U: y1=5, y2=6, y3=7.\n\nAll less than 9.\n\nCannot reach 9 in 3 moves from 5, since each move at most +1, so after 3 moves, at most y=8.\n\nSimilarly, with D, even worse.\n\nSo minimal steps is 4, with four U.\n\nNow, in the direct path, we have no collision, as above.\n\nBut let's confirm the dangerous times.\n\nAt t=0 (T=24), y=5: safe\n\nt=1 (T=25), y=6: for y=6, dangerous at T=27, t=3, not t=1, safe.\n\nt=2 (T=26), y=7: dangerous at t=3, not t=2, safe.\n\nt=3 (T=27), y=8: safe, as y=8 always safe.\n\nt=4 (T=28), y=9: safe.\n\nNow, at T=27, which is t=3, y=8 safe, but y=5,6,7 are dangerous at T=27, but we are not on them.\n\nSimilarly, at T=28, y=1 and y=2 are dangerous, but we are on y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, we can go directly up in 4 steps.\n\nBut the sequence: actions U at t=0,1,2,3 relative.\n\nAbsolute: a_{24} = U, a_{25} = U, a_{26} = U, a_{27} = U\n\nThen at turn 28, y=9.\n\nReach at turn 28 = t1 +4.\n\nH: since reach at t1 + H -1 =28, so 24 + H -1 =28, thus H-1=4, H=5.\n\nNumber of actions: 4.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? No, since we can go fast.\n\nPerhaps if we go down to avoid, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, to avoid being on y=6 at t=1 or something, but in this case not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at t=3, if we were on y=7, it would be dangerous, but we are on y=8.\n\nIn the path, we are on y=7 at t=2, which is safe.\n\nNow, but let's list all positions:\n\nTurn T | y_T | freeway? | dangerous?\n\nT=24, y=5: freeway, not dangerous at T=24 (t=0)\n\nT=25, y=6: freeway, dangerous only at T=27, not T=25, safe\n\nT=26, y=7: freeway, dangerous at T=27, not T=26, safe\n\nT=27, y=8: freeway, not dangerous, safe\n\nT=28, y=9: not freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? But in 3 steps impossible, as above.\n\nSo minimal H: with s=4, H=5.\n\nBut let's confirm H.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{24 + H -1} =9\n\nWith H=5, y_{24+4}=y_{28}=9, yes.\n\nActions from t=0 to 3: a_{24} to a_{27}.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1? H=5, actions up to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{24+4} = a_{28}? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nFor H=5, t=0,1,2,3,4? t from 0 to 4, but that's 5 actions.\n\nt=0: a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nThen after these, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nLet me read the problem again.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"after actions from t=0 to H-1, we have taken H actions, and we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, before the last action? Not.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, we are at (0,9), which means that the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2} have been taken, and at turn t1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nThen the sequence of actions is from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2}, total H-1 actions? Messy.\n\nLet K be the number of actions to reach.\n\nStart at turn t1, position (0, y_t1)\n\nAfter first action a_t1, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter K actions, at turn t1 + K, position y_{t1 + K}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + K} =9 for some K.\n\nThen the reach turn is t1 + K.\n\nBut the problem says reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo t1 + H -1 = t1 + K, thus H -1 = K, so H = K +1.\n\nThen the sequence has K actions, from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + K -1}\n\nIn terms of the sequence index, for t from 0 to K-1, a_{t1 + t}\n\nThen H = K +1.\n\nIn this case, with K=4 actions, H=5.\n\nReach at turn t1 + K = t1 +4 =28.\n\nt1 + H -1 =24 +5-1=28, yes.\n\nNow in the sequence, actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3: a_{24} to a_{27}\n\nEach with U.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nAnd H=5.\n\nBut is there a problem at T=27?\n\nAt T=27, we are at y=8, which is safe, but y=5,6,7 are dangerous at T=27.\n\nWe are not on them.\n\nSimilarly, at T=28, we are at y=9.\n\nBut T=28 is when y=1 and y=2 are dangerous, but we are at y=9.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but impossible.\n\nMaybe by going down first to avoid something, but that would delay.\n\nFor example, if I go down at first, then I need more steps to go up.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus, the minimal is 4 actions, H=5.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states.\n\nAnother thing: at T=27, for y=5,6,7, dangerous.\n\nBut in our path, at T=27, we are on y=8.\n\nNow, but at T=26, we are on y=7, which is freeway, and T=26, not dangerous for y=7, since dangerous at T=27.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the problem has t1=24, so actions at 24,25,26,27 all U.\n\nBut in the answer format.\n\nBut is y=8 safe? Yes.\n\nBut let's double-check y=8.\n\ny=8: car (96,49,right,48)\n\nAt any t, span [49+48t, 96+48t], since t>=0, min 49>0, so never cover x=0, yes.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps for y=1 and y=2 at T=28,29, but we not there.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the player moves only vertically, and cars horizontally, so no other interactions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is four U actions.\n\nBut H=5 turns.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at T=27.\n\nBut at T=27, y=9.\n\nIs it possible?\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{27} =9.\n\nThen H-1 = 27 - 24 =3, so H=4.\n\nThen with H=4, reach at turn t1 + H -1 =24+4-1=27.\n\ny_{27}=9.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to H-1=3, so a_{24}, a_{25}, a_{26}.\n\nAfter a_{26}, at turn 27, y=9.\n\nNow, starting from y_24=5.\n\nAfter a_{24}, y_25; a_{25}, y_26; a_{26}, y_27.\n\nWe want y_27=9.\n\ny_24=5.\n\nAfter three actions, to y_27=9.\n\nNet change +4 in three moves, impossible, as each move at most +1, so y_27 <= y_24 +3 =8.\n\nCannot reach 9 in three moves from 5.\n\nThus, impossible to reach at turn 27.\n\nEarliest at turn 28.\n\nWith four actions.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nSequence: U,U,U,U at turns 24,25,26,27.\n\nIn the answer:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nBut the sequence should be for t from 0 to H-1=4, but H=5, t=0 to 4? No.\n\nH=5, actions from t=0 to 4? But that would be five actions.\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nH=5, t=0,1,2,3,4? But we have only four actions needed.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, for H=5, t=0,1,2,3,4, that's five indices.\n\nBut we need only four actions.\n\nInconsistency in indexing.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nBut to reach in s steps, we need s actions, from t=0 to s-1.\n\nThen H = s +1? Earlier.\n\nIn this case, s=4 actions, H=5.\n\nSo for H=5, actions at t=0,1,2,3: a_{t1+0} to a_{t1+3}, which is a_{24} to a_{27}.\n\nt=0: a_{24}, t=1: a_{25}, t=2: a_{26}, t=3: a_{27}.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H =24+5=29, position, but we reach at t1 + H -1=28.\n\nAfter a_{t1+3} = a_{27}, at turn 28, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 24: a_{24} = U\n\nTurn 25: a_{25} = U\n\nTurn 26: a_{26} = U\n\nTurn 27: a_{27} = U\n\nAnd H=5.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car at t=3 relative.\n\nAnother point: the car update.\n\nFor example, at T=27, for y=5, car C: the third car, span at T=27.\n\nt= T - t1 =27-24=3.\n\nFor y=5, car: (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nAt t=3, span [-47 + 12*3, -36 + 12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], so x=0 covered, yes dangerous.\n\nBut at that time, we are not on y=5, we are on y=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps if we stay or something, but no need.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the answer should be four U actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, all U.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path by going through safe zones, but no, since we must go up.\n\nUnless we go down to y=0, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=4, which is safe, but then from there up to y=9, more steps.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal is 4 actions.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for four turns.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nFirst, H=5.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nIn the format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 24: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=5, and actions up to turn 27.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be for turns from t1 to t1 + H -1, but t1 + H -1 =27, so actions at 24,25,26,27? Turn 27 is included.\n\nActions at turn t, for t from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nt1=24, H=5, t1 + H -1 =24+4=28? 24 to 28? 24,25,26,27,28? That would be five actions.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nThe actions are at turns: a_{t} for t = t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=5, actions at t=24,25,26,27,28? But that's five actions, but we need only four to reach at 28.\n\nReach at turn 28, after actions at 24,25,26,27.\n\nSo actions at 24,25,26,27: four actions.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 =28, so for H=5, t1 + H -1=24+5-1=28.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1=4, but H-1=4, t=0 to 4, that's five values? No.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 inclusive, that's H actions.\n\nFor example, t=0,1,2,3 for H=4? t from 0 to 3, that's 4 actions.\n\nGeneral: t from 0 to K-1 for K actions.\n\nHere K=4 actions.\n\nt from 0 to 3.\n\na_{t1 + t} for t=0 to 3.\n\nSo a_{24}, a_{25}, a_{26}, a_{27}.\n\nThen H=5.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (at 24)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} = U (25)\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{t_1 +2} = U (26)\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_{t_1 +3} = U (27)\n\nAnd since H=5, t up to H-1=4? H-1=4, but t=3 is the last, t=0 to 3.\n\nt=0,1,2,3, that's four, H-1=4-1? H=5, H-1=4, but t from 0 to 4? No.\n\nThe index t from 0 to H-1, so for H=5, t=0,1,2,3,4, five actions.\n\nBut we have only four.\n\nI see the issue.\n\nFor H=5, t from 0 to 4, actions at t1+0 to t1+4, i.e. 24 to 28.\n\nBut at turn 28, after action, we go to turn 29.\n\nBut we reach at turn 28, so no need for action at 28.\n\nThe sequence should have actions only up to when we reach.\n\nIn this case, with actions at 24,25,26,27, we reach at 28.\n\nSo for the sequence, it should be actions from t=0 to s-1, with s=4.\n\nThen H=s+1=5.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to 3 for four actions.\n\nThen in the answer, for H=5, we list actions for t=0 to 3, which is t=0,1,2,3, corresponding to turns 24,25,26,27.\n\nAnd t=4 is not included because we don't need action after reaching.\n\nIn the box, we list only the actions, from turn t1 to the turn before reaching.\n\nThe turn when we reach is after the last action.\n\nSo in the sequence, we list actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 2? Let's not complicate.\n\nFrom the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd after that, at turn t1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nWith H=5, actions for t=0 to 4: a_{24} to a_{28}.\n\nBut with a_{24} to a_{27}, we reach at 28.\n\nIf we include a_{28}, that would be for moving to turn 29, but we don't need, since we reach at 28.\n\nSo for H=5, if we set actions up to a_{28}, then at turn 29, y, but we want to be at (0,9) at turn 28.\n\nSo we should not have action at turn 28.\n\nTherefore, for the sequence, with H=5, it should be actions from t=0 to 3, not to 4.\n\nBut t from 0 to H-1=4, which includes t=4.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps the problem has a off-by-one.\n\nI think in practice, for the sequence, we list the actions needed.\n\nSince we reach at turn 28 with 4 actions, H should be 4 for the number of turns? But the problem says \"number of turns H\", and reach at t1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=4, t1 + H -1 =24+3=27, but we reach at 28, not 27.\n\nSo H must be 5.\n\nThen for the sequence, with H=5, actions from t=0 to 4, but t=4 is a_{28}, which is not needed.\n\nBut if we set a_{28} to S or something, but at turn 28, we are already at (0,9), so no action needed, or if we take action, we might move away, but we are at y=9, if we go U, y=10, but y max 9, so probably invalid, or stay.\n\nBut the point is, we don't need to take action at the turn we reach.\n\nSo probably, the sequence should have actions only until we move to the target.\n\nTherefore, in this case, for reaching at turn 28, we have actions from turn 24 to 27.\n\nSo the sequence has 4 actions, H=5.\n\nIn the list, for H=5, we list only up to t=3, not t=4.\n\nBut the range is t=0 to H-1, which for H=5 is 0 to 4.\n\nTo resolve, perhaps for this case, since we reach at turn 28, and t1 + H -1=28, H=5, the action at t=4 (turn 28) should be such that it doesn't move, but we are already at 9.\n\nBut the action is taken at turn 28 to go to turn 29, but we don't care about turn 29.\n\nTo minimize H, we don't need to include extra actions.\n\nI think it's better to set the sequence with the actions that are taken.\n\nIn the answer, we can list the turns explicitly.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that after the sequence, at the next turn, we are at (0,9), but it says \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\".\n\nI think for this problem, since it works, I'll go with the sequence.\n\nSo actions: at turn 24: U, turn 25: U, turn 26: U, turn 27: U.\n\nAnd H=5.\n\nIn the box:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 24: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: & U \\end{array} }\n\nAnd H=5.\n\nBut H is to be stated, but in the answer format, it says \"determine H and the sequence\", but in the box, it seems only the sequence is boxed, with the turns.\n\nFrom the format: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\"\n\nSo it lists the actions for each turn, from t1 onwards, until the last action before reaching.\n\nAnd H is the number, but not included in the box? The box has the sequence.\n\nAnd H is part of the answer.\n\nBut in the box, only the actions.\n\nI think we just list the sequence.\n\nFor this, it's fine.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if we can reach earlier by a different path, but impossible.\n\nSuppose we go to y=4 at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=0, instead of U, go D to y=4 at T=25.\n\nThen from there, but y=4 is safe, but to go to y=9, need to go up 5 steps, so at least to T=30 or later, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at some point, also more turns.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is with H=5, sequence all U.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n### Solution\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 24\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n- The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 5, meaning the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 24 + 5 - 1 = 28\\).\n- The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) for all four actions, from turn 24 to turn 27, resulting in the following path:\n  - At turn 24, action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 25.\n  - At turn 25, action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 26.\n  - At turn 26, action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 27.\n  - At turn 27, action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 28.\n\n#### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 24 (relative \\(t = 0\\), \\(y = 5\\)**: Freeway \\(y = 5\\) is dangerous only at turn 27 (relative \\(t = 3\\)), but at turn 24, all cars on \\(y = 5\\) have spans that do not cover \\(x = 0\\) (spans: [1,12], [37,48], [-47,-36]). Safe.\n- **Turn 25 (relative \\(t = 1\\)), \\(y = 6\\)**: Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is dangerous only at turn 27 (relative \\(t = 3\\)), but at turn 25, all cars on \\(y = 6\\) have spans that do not cover \\(x = 0\\) (spans: [13,24], [49,60], [-35,-24]). Safe.\n- **Turn 26 (relative \\(t = 2\\)), \\(y = 7\\)**: Freeway \\(y = 7\\) is dangerous only at turn 27 (relative \\(t = 3\\)), but at turn 26, all cars on \\(y = 7\\) have spans that do not cover \\(x = 0\\) (spans: [25,36], [61,72], [-23,-12]). Safe.\n- **Turn 27 (relative \\(t = 3\\)), \\(y = 8\\)**: Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is always safe, as the car span [49 + 48 \\cdot 3, 96 + 48 \\cdot 3] = [193, 240] does not cover \\(x = 0\\). Safe.\n- **Turn 28 (relative \\(t = 4\\)), \\(y = 9\\)**: Not a freeway, so no collision possible. Safe.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 5\\) turns, as reaching \\(y = 9\\) in fewer than 4 actions (e.g., 3 actions) is impossible due to the net change required (+4) exceeding the maximum possible change (+3).\n\n#### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 24 to 27 is all \"U\" (up).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 24: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 25, starting at (0,6). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways y=1 to y=8. We are currently at y=6. We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nImportant: When we move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, we are considered to be on y_T at turn T. So at turn T, we check the car on freeway y_T. And when we are moving, we are not on the next freeway until the next turn.\n\nGoal: We want to get to y=9. Note that y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars). So we can be at y=0 or y=9 without worrying about cars.\n\nPlan: We must traverse from y=6 to y=9, passing through y=7 and y=8. We have to avoid collisions at y=6,7,8 at the exact turns we are on those rows.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement and check for collisions. Since the cars are moving and their positions change over time, we need to compute the car spans at the future turns.\n\nFirst, let's note the car movements:\n\nFor a car at freeway k, given at turn t1=25, with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s.\n\nAt a future turn T (>=25), the car's position is:\n  If right-moving: \n      head(T) = h + s*(T-25)\n      tail(T) = tau + s*(T-25)\n      So the span is [tau + s*(T-25), h + s*(T-25)]   (since for right-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left? But note: in the update, for right-moving, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] and since in the initial state they gave (tau, head) and head>tau? Actually, in the table, for right-moving cars, the head is greater than the tail? Let's see:\n\nExample: freeway 1: (48,37,right,6) -> head=48, tail=37? Then at T, the head becomes 48+6*(T-25) and tail 37+6*(T-25). So the car covers from 37+6*(T-25) to 48+6*(T-25). Similarly, the other car: (-18,-29,right,6) -> head=-18, tail=-29 -> becomes [-29+6*(T-25), -18+6*(T-25)].\n\nBut note: collision condition is that the player is at (0, k) at turn T and the car on freeway k at turn T has a span that includes 0.\n\nSo we must check for each freeway k that we step on at turn T: does 0 lie in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T?\n\nWe are starting at turn 25 at y=6. We are going to plan a sequence of actions for t=25, 26, ... until we get to y=9.\n\nWe want minimal H, so we try to go up as much as possible. But we must avoid collisions.\n\nCurrent state at turn 25:\n  We are at y=6.\n\nAt turn 25, we are on freeway 6? Yes. So we must check the cars on freeway 6 at turn 25.\n\nFreeway 6 has:\n  (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nLet's compute the spans at turn T=25 for freeway 6:\n\nFor car1: (24,13,right,12) -> at T=25: head=24+12*(0)=24, tail=13+12*(0)=13 -> span [13,24] -> does 0 lie in [13,24]? No.\nFor car2: (60,49,right,12) -> [49,60] -> 0 not in.\nFor car3: (-24,-35,right,12) -> tail=-35+0=-35, head=-24+0=-24 -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 25, we are safe at y=6.\n\nNow, we can choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to go to y=9. So ideally we go up. But we have to check what happens when we move.\n\nIf we go up at turn 25 (so action U), then at turn 26 we will be at y=7.\n\nBut at turn 25, after the action we are still at y=6? Actually, the update is: at the end of turn t, we update the position. So at the start of turn 25 we are at (0,6). Then we choose an action. Then at the start of turn 26, we are at (0, y_26) = (0,6+1)= (0,7) if we chose U.\n\nBut note: during turn 25, we are on freeway 6. We already checked that at turn 25, freeway6 is safe. Then at turn 26, we will be on freeway 7? Because we are at y=7.\n\nSo we must check freeway7 at turn 26.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose to stay at turn 25, then at turn 26 we are still at y=6.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence that gets us to y=9 without any collision. We are going to simulate step by step and try to find the minimal H.\n\nWe note that the cars move continuously. We are going to write a function to compute for a freeway k and a turn T, whether there is a car that has 0 in its span.\n\nLet's define:\n\nFor a car (h, tau, d, s) at turn t1=25, at turn T (>=25):\n\n  if d == 'right':\n      left_end = tau + s*(T-25)\n      right_end = h + s*(T-25)\n  if d == 'left':   # note: in the problem, we have left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] -> but in the table, we only have right-moving? Actually, looking at the table, all cars are right-moving. Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars, both right.\nFreeway 2: same, both right.\nFreeway 3: one car, right.\nFreeway 4: one car, right.\nFreeway 5: three cars, all right.\nFreeway 6: three cars, all right.\nFreeway 7: three cars, all right.\nFreeway 8: one car, right.\n\nSo all cars are right-moving. Therefore, we only need the right-moving formula.\n\nSo for any car on freeway k: \n   left_end = tau + s*(T-25)\n   right_end = h + s*(T-25)\n\nAnd we require that 0 is in [left_end, right_end] (if the car is right-moving, and note that for right-moving the car spans are from left_end to right_end, with left_end <= right_end).\n\nBut note: in the problem, for left-moving they defined head and tail differently? Actually, the problem states:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1)= [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] -> so if h and tau are given and the car is left-moving, then we assume h is the leftmost and tau the rightmost? Or the other way? The problem says: for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then moves left. But in the table, we don't have any left-moving car. So we can ignore.\n\nSo for our problem, every car is right-moving. Therefore, the span at turn T is [tau + s*(T-25), h + s*(T-25)].\n\nCollision at freeway k at turn T if there exists a car on freeway k such that:\n   tau + s*(T-25) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-25)\n\nWe are going to compute the safety of each freeway at each future turn we might be there.\n\nWe start at:\n   T=25: y=6 -> check freeway6: safe (as above)\n\nNow, we want to go to y=9. The minimal steps would be 3: U, U, U. But we must check if that is safe.\n\nPlan A: U at T=25 -> then at T=26: y=7 -> check freeway7 at T=26.\n        U at T=26 -> then at T=27: y=8 -> check freeway8 at T=27.\n        U at T=27 -> then at T=28: y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo we need to check freeway7 at T=26 and freeway8 at T=27.\n\nFreeway7 at T=26:\n   Cars: (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\n   For each car, T-25 = 1.\n   Car1: left_end = 13 + 12*1 = 25, right_end=24+12=36 -> [25,36] -> 0 not in.\n   Car2: left_end=49+12=61, right_end=60+12=72 -> [61,72] -> 0 not in.\n   Car3: left_end=-35+12=-23, right_end=-24+12=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n\n   So freeway7 at T=26 is safe.\n\nFreeway8 at T=27:\n   Cars: (-48,-95,right,48)   (only one car)\n\n   T-25 = 2.\n   left_end = -95 + 48*2 = -95 + 96 = 1\n   right_end = -48 + 48*2 = -48+96=48\n   So span [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nSo the plan: \n   Turn25: U -> y=7 at T=26\n   Turn26: U -> y=8 at T=27\n   Turn27: U -> y=9 at T=28 -> done in H=3 turns.\n\nBut wait: at turn25 we start at y=6, then after first U we are at y=7 at the start of turn26. Then at turn26 we do U and are at y=8 at the start of turn27. Then at turn27 we do U and are at y=9 at the start of turn28. So the last action is at turn27, and we reach at turn28. Therefore, H=3 actions? But note the sequence is from t=25 to t=27 (3 actions: t=25,26,27) and we are at y=9 at turn28. However, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that we do H actions and at the end of the H-th action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). \n\nIn this case, we do:\n   t1=25: action0 (U) -> then at the start of t26 we are at y7.\n   t26: action1 (U) -> at the start of t27 we are at y8.\n   t27: action2 (U) -> at the start of t28 we are at y9.\n\nSo we have done 3 actions (H=3) and at turn t1+H-1 = 25+3-1=27? But wait, at the start of turn28 we are at y9. The position at the start of turn t is the result of the action at turn t-1. \n\nThe problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo at the end of the last action (which is at turn t1+H-1), we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the action at turn t1+H-1 is the last action, and it moves us to (0,9) at the start of the next turn? \n\nActually, the update rule: after action at turn t, we have y_{t+1}. So if we do an action at turn t, we are at the new position at the start of turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, we are at (0,9) at the start of turn (t1+H). But the problem requires that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis might be ambiguous. Let me clarify with the update:\n\nAt turn t1 (current turn), we start at (0,6). We take an action a_{t1} and then we are at (0, y_{t1+1}) at the start of turn t1+1.\n\nSo if we do H actions, the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at the start of turn t1+H we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThat would mean that we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1? Then we haven't taken the H-th action yet? \n\nI think there is a confusion in indexing.\n\nLooking back: \n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: our state is defined at the start of each turn. \n\nAt the start of turn t, we are at position (0, y_t). Then we take action a_t. Then at the start of turn t+1, we are at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nTherefore, we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut then we would not have taken any action at turn t1+H-1? That doesn't match because the sequence of actions goes from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take the last action at turn t1+H-1 and then we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H. But then the turn we reach is t1+H, not t1+H-1.\n\nThis is critical. \n\nLet me read the problem again: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nBut in the update rule: after the action at turn t, the next state is at turn t+1. \n\nSo if we take an action at turn t, we are at the new state at the start of turn t+1. \n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at the start of turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that brought us there.\n\nSo if we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then we must have taken an action at turn (t1+H-1)-1 = t1+H-2 that brought us to (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1. So the last action would be at turn t1+H-1. That action would then determine the state at the start of turn t1+H.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be defining the state after the action at turn t as being at the same turn t? But the update rule says: \"y_{t+1} = ...\", so the new position is at time t+1.\n\nLooking at the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". And note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nTherefore, the position at the start of turn T is y_T, and that is the freeway we check at turn T.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at the start of turn T, we must have T = t1+H-1? \n\nBut then the last action that got us there was at turn T-1 = t1+H-2. Then the sequence of actions would be from t1 to t1+H-2? But the problem says the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions. \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nI think the problem means that we take H actions, and after the H-th action (which is at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H. But then the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", which is the turn at which we take the last action, not the state after.\n\nBut the state after the last action is at turn t1+H.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might define the state at the end of the turn? But the update rule uses \"y_{t+1}\" meaning the state at the next turn.\n\nI think the intended meaning is: we start at turn t1 at position (0, y_{t1}). Then we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. After the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H. But the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis doesn't match. \n\nLooking at the example answer format: \n   Turn t1: a_{t1}\n   Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n   ...\n   Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd we are at (0,9) after the last action? But the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and the result is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis implies that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are already at (0,9). Then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider that after taking an action at turn t, the state is updated immediately and we are at the new position at the same turn? But the update rule uses y_{t+1}.\n\nI think the problem has a small inconsistency. However, note the collision rule: when you move at turn T, you are still on the old freeway at turn T. So the position during turn T is the starting position. The new position takes effect at turn T+1.\n\nTherefore, we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H. And the problem requires that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That doesn't match.\n\nBut wait: the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So they want the state at the start of turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). How can that be?\n\nThat would mean that we must have been at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1 without taking an action at that turn? But then the last action that got us there was at turn t1+H-2. Then we have taken H-1 actions? But the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, then the state after that action is at turn t1+H, not t1+H-1.\n\nThe only way this makes sense is if the state at the start of turn t1+H-1 is (0,9), and then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But that action would then change the state. And we don't care about what happens after we reach (0,9)? But the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", meaning we are there at that turn.\n\nBut then we must have arrived at (0,9) by the action taken at turn t1+H-2. Then the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken after we are already at (0,9). And that action would move us away? But we are required to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nAlternatively, we could do nothing at the last action? But then we would be at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1 and then we do S (stay) and remain at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H. But the problem only requires to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. However, the action at turn t1+H-1 is part of the sequence.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nTo resolve, let me assume that the problem means: we take H actions, and after the H-th action (which is at turn t1+H-1), we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H. But then the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", which is the turn at which we take the last action, not the state after.\n\nBut the state during turn t1+H-1 is the state at the start of turn t1+H-1, which is not (0,9) unless we got there earlier.\n\nI think the intended meaning is that we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H. Then the turn we reach is turn t1+H, and we want H actions from t1 to t1+H-1. Then the minimal H is the number of actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\", so they might be counting the turns including the starting turn? \n\nAt turn t1 (start), we are at (0,6). We haven't taken any action yet. Then we take H actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the start of turn t1+H we are at (0,9). So the turn at which we are at (0,9) is turn t1+H. But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", so that must be a mistake.\n\nGiven the confusion, let's look at the example: \n   We are at turn 25, start at y=6. \n   We want to be at y=9.\n\nIf we do 3 actions: \n   Turn25: U -> at start of turn26: y=7\n   Turn26: U -> at start of turn27: y=8\n   Turn27: U -> at start of turn28: y=9\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn28. Therefore, H should be 3, and the sequence covers turns 25,26,27. Then turn t1+H-1 = 25+3-1=27, and at the start of turn27 we are at y=8, not y=9. But we want to be at y=9 at turn27? That is not the case.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem means that we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H. And the last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and H is the number of actions. And the turn we reach is t1+H.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nThis suggests that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nHow can that be? We start at turn t1 at y=6. We take actions. After k actions, we are at a new state at turn t1+k. \n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at turn t1 we are at y=6.\nAfter 1 action (at turn t1), at turn t1+1 we are at a new state.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have taken (H-1) actions? But the sequence is of length H.\n\nThis implies that the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1 even though we are already at (0,9) at the start of that turn. Then that action might move us away? But the problem doesn't require to stay there, only to be there at that turn.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", so we must be at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1. The action at turn t1+H-1 is then taken from (0,9). \n\nBut then the minimal number of actions to get to (0,9) is not necessarily the same as H, because H includes an extra action at the end.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nAlternatively, the indexing of the actions might be off by one.\n\nLet me try to reinterpret: \n   Let the actions be taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n   The state at turn t1 is given.\n   After action at turn t1, we are at state at turn t1+1.\n   After action at turn t1+1, we are at state at turn t1+2.\n   ...\n   After action at turn t1+H-1, we are at state at turn t1+H.\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: at turn t1+H-1.\n\nUnless they consider the state after the action as part of the same turn? But the update rule uses y_{t+1}.\n\nGiven the time, I think there is a typo in the problem. Probably, they meant to say \"at turn t1+H\". \n\nBecause in the answer format, we are writing actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nAnd the minimal H is the number of actions.\n\nIn our example, with H=3, we are at y=9 at turn28 = 25+3. So t1+H = 28.\n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", which would be 27, and at turn27 we are at y=8.\n\nSo if we do 2 actions: \n   Turn25: U -> y7 at turn26\n   Turn26: U -> y8 at turn27\n   Then at turn27 we are at y8, not y9.\n\nTo be at y9 at turn27, we would need to be there at the start of turn27, which means we must have taken an action at turn26 that moved us from y8 to y9? But then that would be the second action, and then we are at y9 at turn27. Then H=2 actions: at turn25 and turn26. Then t1+H-1 = 25+2-1=26, but then at turn26 we are at y7, not y9.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: the turn index in the state is the turn after which we have taken the action? That is, at the end of turn t, we have taken the action and are at the new state.\n\nBut the collision rule says \"at turn T\", and we are on freeway y_T. And if we move at turn T, we are still on the old freeway during turn T.\n\nThis suggests that the state at the beginning of turn T is y_T, and then we take action a_T, and during turn T we are on y_T, and then at the beginning of turn T+1 we are on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T, we need T = t1+H-1? and then we have taken H-1 actions.\n\nBut then the sequence of actions should be for turns t1 to t1+H-2, and H-1 actions. But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\nI think the safest is to assume that we are to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H. Then the number of actions is H, and the actions are at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then the turn we achieve the goal is turn t1+H.\n\nAnd we ignore the problem's \" at turn t1+H-1\" and consider it a mistake.\n\nOtherwise, we cannot make sense of it.\n\nGiven that, let's return to our plan: we found a plan with 3 actions: U, U, U, and we reach y9 at turn28.\n\nBut is there a plan with fewer than 3 actions? \n   H=2: then we would be at y9 at turn27. \n   Actions: \n        Turn25: action1\n        Turn26: action2\n        Then at turn27 we are at some state.\n\n   We start at y6 at turn25.\n   After action1 at turn25, at turn26: y7 or y5 or y6.\n   After action2 at turn26, at turn27: we want y9.\n\n   From y7 at turn26: we can do U->y8, or UU is not possible in one step? \n        If at turn26 we are at y7, then action2: U -> y8 at turn27, not y9.\n        action2: S -> y7, D->y6.\n   From y5 at turn26: U->y6, U-> not to 9.\n   From y6 at turn26: U->y7.\n\n   So we cannot reach y9 in two actions from y6. \n\nTherefore, minimal H is 3.\n\nAnd our plan with 3 actions is safe.\n\nBut wait, we must check the intermediate steps:\n\n   Turn25: action U -> then at turn25 we are on freeway6? Yes, and we already checked at T=25: freeway6 is safe.\n\n   Then at turn26: we are at y7. Check freeway7 at T=26: we did that and it is safe.\n\n   Then at turn26: we do action U -> then at turn26 we are on freeway7? Yes, and we are safe because at T=26, freeway7 is safe.\n\n   Then at turn27: we are at y8. Check freeway8 at T=27: we did that and it is safe.\n\n   Then at turn27: we do action U -> then at turn27 we are on freeway8? Yes, and we must check freeway8 at T=27: safe.\n\n   Then at turn28: we are at y9, which is safe.\n\nSo the entire sequence is safe.\n\nBut note: at turn27, after we do the last U, we are still at freeway8 during turn27, and we have checked freeway8 at turn27 and it is safe. Then at turn28, we are at y9, which is not a freeway, so no car check.\n\nTherefore, the plan is valid.\n\nBut according to our earlier calculation, we reach y9 at turn28, but the problem asks to reach at turn25+H-1 = 25+3-1=27? That is not matching.\n\nHowever, if the problem meant that we are to be at (0,9) at turn28, then it's turn25+3, so if they had said \"at turn t1+H\", then H=3 would give turn28.\n\nGiven the instructions, I will output the sequence for H=3 actions.\n\nBut let me see if there is any issue with the cars at the intermediate steps.\n\nWe have to also check that when we are at a freeway at turn T, the car on that freeway does not have 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nWe did:\n   T=25: y=6 -> safe.\n   T=26: y=7 -> safe.\n   T=27: y=8 -> safe.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nIs there a faster way? We cannot do it in 2 actions, as reasoned.\n\nWhat about doing it in 3 actions but with a different path? We could go down first, but that would take more actions. So minimal is 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\n\nBut note: the problem says the sequence for t from 0 to H-1, so for t=0,1,2 (H=3) we have:\n   a_{25} = U\n   a_{26} = U\n   a_{27} = U\n\nBut the answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\n}\n\nBut wait, we have to ensure that at turn27, when we are still at freeway8, the car on freeway8 at turn27 is safe? We did check: freeway8 at T=27: the car is at [1,48], so 0 not in.\n\nBut what about freeway8 at turn27: we have only one car, and we computed:\n   left_end = -95 + 48*(27-25) = -95 + 48*2 = -95+96=1\n   right_end = -48 + 48*2 = -48+96=48\n\nSo [1,48], and 0 is not in [1,48]. So safe.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the freeway8 car: \n   The car is (-48,-95,right,48). \n   head = -48, tail = -95? But for a right-moving car, we said head is the right end, tail is the left end. But in the initial state at turn25, the car is at [-95, -48]? \n   Because tail=-95, head=-48 -> so the car spans from -95 to -48. \n   Then at T=25: left_end=-95, right_end=-48.\n   Then at T=27: moves right by 48*2=96 units: \n        left_end = -95+96=1\n        right_end = -48+96=48\n   So [1,48]. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nBut note: there is a car on freeway5,6,7 that move fast? For example, freeway5,6,7 have cars with speed 12. But we have checked the turns we are on those freeways.\n\nAnother potential issue: at turn25, freeway6 has three cars. We checked at T=25, they are at:\n   car1: [13,24] -> safe.\n   car2: [49,60] -> safe.\n   car3: [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nAt turn26, freeway7 has cars that are at:\n   car1: [13+12=25, 24+12=36] -> safe.\n   car2: [49+12=61, 60+12=72] -> safe.\n   car3: [-35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> safe.\n\nAt turn27, freeway8: [1,48] -> safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut what about if we try to go faster? We can't.\n\nWhat if we do a down then up? That would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H is 3.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and in the sequence we have 3 actions, so H=3.\n\nBut note the answer format: we must output the actions for turns 25,26,27.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\n}\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if there is any car that might hit at an earlier or later time? We are only at the freeways at turns 25,26,27, and we checked exactly those turns.\n\nOne more thing: the car on freeway8 at turn27 is safe, but what if we were there at turn26? \n   At turn26: freeway8 car: left_end = -95+48*(26-25) = -95+48=-47, right_end=-48+48=0.\n   So at turn26, the car on freeway8 spans [-47,0]. Does 0 lie in [-47,0]? Yes, because 0 is the right endpoint.\n\nBut we are not on freeway8 at turn26. We are on freeway7 at turn26. And we are on freeway8 at turn27, when the car has moved to [1,48]. So we are safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway7 at turn25: \n   car1: [13,24] -> safe.\n   car2: [49,60] -> safe.\n   car3: [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\nAnd at turn27, freeway7: \n   car1: 13+12*2=37, 24+12*2=48 -> [37,48] -> safe.\n   car2: 49+24=73, 60+24=84 -> safe.\n   car3: -35+24=-11, -24+24=0 -> [-11,0]. This includes 0? Yes, at turn27, freeway7 has a car that covers [-11,0]. But we are not on freeway7 at turn27. We are on freeway7 only at turn26, and at turn26 car3 is at [-23,-12] which does not include 0.\n\nSo everything is safe.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence is three ups.\n\nBut what if at turn25 we do S? Then we stay at y6 at turn26. Then we might need more actions. Not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is three ups.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 6)\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The current turn is \\(t_1 = 25\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 25.\n- To reach \\((0, 9)\\), the player must move upward three times: from \\(y=6\\) to \\(y=7\\), then to \\(y=8\\), and finally to \\(y=9\\).\n- The minimal number of actions required is 3, as moving down or staying would increase \\(H\\).\n\n### Collision Check:\nCollisions are checked at the turn when the player is on a freeway (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)). The cars are right-moving, and their spans at turn \\(T\\) are calculated as \\([ \\tau + s \\cdot (T - 25), h + s \\cdot (T - 25) ]\\), where \\((\\tau, h, d, s)\\) are the car parameters.\n\n1. **Turn 25 (player at \\(y = 6\\)):**\n   - Freeway 6 cars:\n     - \\((24, 13, \\text{right}, 12)\\): span \\([13 + 12 \\cdot 0, 24 + 12 \\cdot 0] = [13, 24]\\) → 0 not in span.\n     - \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 12)\\): span \\([49, 60]\\) → 0 not in span.\n     - \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 12)\\): span \\([-35, -24]\\) → 0 not in span.\n   - **Safe to be at \\(y = 6\\)**.\n\n2. **Turn 26 (player moves to \\(y = 7\\)):**\n   - Action at turn 25: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 26).\n   - Freeway 7 cars at turn 26:\n     - \\((24, 13, \\text{right}, 12)\\): span \\([13 + 12 \\cdot 1, 24 + 12 \\cdot 1] = [25, 36]\\) → 0 not in span.\n     - \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 12)\\): span \\([49 + 12, 60 + 12] = [61, 72]\\) → 0 not in span.\n     - \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 12)\\): span \\([-35 + 12, -24 + 12] = [-23, -12]\\) → 0 not in span.\n   - **Safe to be at \\(y = 7\\)**.\n\n3. **Turn 27 (player moves to \\(y = 8\\)):**\n   - Action at turn 26: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 27).\n   - Freeway 8 cars at turn 27:\n     - \\((-48, -95, \\text{right}, 48)\\): span \\([-95 + 48 \\cdot 2, -48 + 48 \\cdot 2] = [1, 48]\\) → 0 not in span.\n   - **Safe to be at \\(y = 8\\)**.\n\n4. **Turn 28 (player moves to \\(y = 9\\)):**\n   - Action at turn 27: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 28).\n   - \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (no cars), so no collision check.\n\nThe sequence of actions is safe and reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 3 actions. After the third action (at turn 27), the player is at \\((0, 9)\\) at the start of turn 28. The minimal \\(H = 3\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 25: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\))\n- Turn 26: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 27: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\))\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. I start at y=7 and need to reach y=9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t1=26. I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nThe collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And importantly, when I move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nAlso, if I move away, I'm not considered on the new row until the next turn.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway. Freeways are y=1 to y=8.\n\nGiven:\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (54,43,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nSince direction is right, and span is given as (head, tail), for right-moving, head is the front, so from the update rule: for right-moving, span at T is [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] where tau and h are at t1.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says (54,43,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFor the first car: head=54, tail=43? But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail if it's moving right, but 54 and 43, 54>43, so head=54, tail=43.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, at t1, span is [tau, h] = [43,54] I think? Let's clarify.\n\nThe table says \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for first car: h=54, tau=43, d=right, s=6\n\nFor right-moving, the span at t1 is from tail to head, so [tau, h] = [43,54]\n\nThen at time T, span is [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [43 + 6*(T-26), 54 + 6*(T-26)]\n\nSimilarly, for the second car on freeway 1: h=-12, tau=-23, d=right, s=6\n\nSo span at t1: [tau, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T: [-23 + 6*(T-26), -12 + 6*(T-26)]\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, for the freeway I'm on, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut I start at y=7, and need to go to y=9. So I need to move up twice: from 7 to 8, then 8 to 9.\n\nBut I have to avoid collisions on y=7 and y=8 when I'm there.\n\nAlso, I could stay or move down, but since I need to go up, moving down might not help, and staying would just delay, so probably minimal turns involve moving up as much as possible, but I have to time it so that when I'm on a freeway, no car is at x=0.\n\nNow, the turns: let t be the turn number relative to t1. So at t=0, turn t1=26, position y=7.\n\nI need to find actions for t=0 to H-1, such that at turn t1 + (H-1), y=9.\n\nSince I start at 7, to reach 9, I need to increase y by 2, so minimum H=2 if I can move up twice with no issues.\n\nBut I need to check if at turn 26, when I'm on y=7, is there a car at x=0 on y=7? And similarly for future turns.\n\nAlso, when I move, I might need to wait or something.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the times when a car is at x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway and car, 0 is in span at T if:\n\nFor right-moving car: 0 ∈ [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo tau + s(T-t1) <= 0 <= h + s(T-t1)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars seem right-moving? Let me check the directions.\n\nFreeway 1: both right\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says: | 2 | (54,43,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6) | same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: (0,-47,right,48)\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3? (0,-47,right,48)\n\nFreeway 5: (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5? (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (0,-47,right,48)\n\nSo freeways 1 and 2 are identical, 3 and 4 identical, 5,6,7 identical, and 8 similar to 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 3: (0,-47,right,48), freeway 4 same, freeway 8 same.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7 have three cars each.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway, the set of T where 0 is covered by some car.\n\nSince collision only if I'm on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFor freeway y, at turn T, if there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nNow, for freeway 7, which I start on, and freeway 8, which I need to go to.\n\nFirst, let's find for freeway 7, since I'm there at turn t1=26.\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars:\n\nCar A: h=36, tau=25, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 12(T-26), 36 + 12(T-26)]\n\nCar B: h=-48, tau=-59, d=right, s=12? h=-48, tau=-59, so since right, span at t1: [tau, h] = [-59,-48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 12(T-26), -48 + 12(T-26)]\n\nCar C: h=-12, tau=-23, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan at t1: [tau, h] = [-23,-12]\n\nAt T: [-23 + 12(T-26), -12 + 12(T-26)]\n\nNow, 0 is in span if for some car, the interval contains 0.\n\nFor car A: 0 in [25 + 12(T-26), 36 + 12(T-26)] iff\n\n25 + 12(T-26) <= 0 <= 36 + 12(T-26)\n\nSince the interval is increasing with T.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSolve for T.\n\nFor car A:\n\nLower bound L_A = 25 + 12(T-26)\n\nUpper bound U_A = 36 + 12(T-26)\n\n0 in [L_A, U_A] iff L_A <= 0 and U_A >= 0\n\nL_A <= 0: 25 + 12(T-26) <= 0\n\n12(T-26) <= -25\n\nT-26 <= -25/12 ≈ -2.083, so T <= 26 - 2.083 = 23.917, so T <= 23 since T integer.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSimilarly, U_A >= 0: 36 + 12(T-26) >= 0\n\n12(T-26) >= -36\n\nT-26 >= -3\n\nT >= 23\n\nNow, L_A <= 0 and U_A >= 0: T <= 23 and T >= 23? From above:\n\nL_A <= 0 implies T <= 23.917, so T <= 23\n\nU_A >= 0 implies T >= 23\n\nSo for T=23, L_A = 25 + 12(23-26) = 25 + 12(-3) = 25 - 36 = -11 <= 0\n\nU_A = 36 + 12(-3) = 36 - 36 = 0 >= 0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nFor T=24, L_A = 25 + 12(24-26) = 25 + 12(-2) = 25 - 24 = 1 >0, so L_A=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not in [1, ...]\n\nSimilarly, T=22: L_A =25 +12(22-26)=25+12(-4)=25-48=-23<=0, U_A=36-48=-12<0, so U_A<0, not >=0, so 0 not in interval.\n\nThus for car A, only at T=23, 0 is in span.\n\nBut T=23 is before t1=26, so at current and future, for T>=26, car A does not cover x=0.\n\nNow car B: h=-48, tau=-59, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [ -59 +12(T-26), -48 +12(T-26) ]\n\n0 in this iff:\n\nL_B = -59 +12(T-26) <=0 and U_B = -48 +12(T-26) >=0\n\nL_B <=0: -59 +12(T-26) <=0\n\n12(T-26) <= 59\n\nT-26 <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so T <= 30.916, T<=30\n\nU_B >=0: -48 +12(T-26) >=0\n\n12(T-26) >=48\n\nT-26 >=4\n\nT>=30\n\nSo T<=30 and T>=30, so only at T=30.\n\nL_B <=0: T<=30.916, so T<=30\n\nU_B >=0: T>=30\n\nSo T=30: L_B= -59 +12(30-26)= -59 +12(4)= -59+48= -11 <=0\n\nU_B= -48 +48=0 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nT=31: L_B= -59+12(5)= -59+60=1>0, not <=0\n\nT=29: L_B= -59+12(3)= -59+36= -23<=0, U_B= -48+36= -12<0, not >=0\n\nSo car B covers x=0 only at T=30.\n\nCar C: h=-12, tau=-23, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [ -23 +12(T-26), -12 +12(T-26) ]\n\n0 in this iff L_C <=0 and U_C >=0\n\nL_C = -23 +12(T-26) <=0\n\n12(T-26) <=23\n\nT-26 <= 23/12 ≈1.916, T<=27.916, so T<=27\n\nU_C = -12 +12(T-26) >=0\n\n12(T-26) >=12\n\nT-26 >=1\n\nT>=27\n\nSo T<=27 and T>=27, only T=27.\n\nT=27: L_C= -23 +12(1)= -23+12= -11<=0, U_C= -12+12=0>=0\n\nT=28: L_C= -23+12(2)= -23+24=1>0, not\n\nT=26: L_C= -23 +12(0)= -23 <=0, U_C= -12 <0? U_C= -12 +0 = -12 <0, not >=0, so no.\n\nSo for freeway 7, cars cover x=0 at:\n\nCar A: T=23\n\nCar B: T=30\n\nCar C: T=27\n\nT=23 is before current, so for T>=26, at T=27 and T=30, there is a car at x=0 on freeway 7.\n\nSpecifically, at T=27, car C; at T=30, car B.\n\nAt other times, no car at x=0.\n\nNow, at turn t1=26, T=26, is there a car?

U=48(0)=0 at T=26.\n\nAt T=26, L= -47 +0 = -47 <=0, U=0 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor T>26, L = -47 +48(T-26) > -47 +48(0. something) but T=27: L= -47+48(1)=1>0, so L>0, not <=0.\n\nT=26: L=-47<=0, U=0>=0, so 0 is included.\n\nThus at T=26, car is at x=0 on freeway 8.\n\nBut I'm not on freeway 8 yet; I'm on y=7.\n\nNow, if I want to move to y=8 at some turn.\n\nWhen I move to y=8 at turn T, I will be on y=8 at turn T+1, because when I take action at T to move to y_{T+1}, I am on y_T at turn T, and then after action, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nPlayer position: at turn t, player is at (0, y_t)\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, affecting y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, I am on row y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am on row y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t occurs if I am on freeway y_t and 0 is in span of some car on that freeway at turn t.\n\nIn the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for the current turn, when I am on y_T, I care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nFor freeway 8 at turn T=26, there is a car at x=0, so if I were on y=8 at turn 26, I would collide, but I am on y=7.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, when else is there a car at x=0.\n\nFrom above, only at T=26, because for T>26, L>0, so no.\n\nAt T=26, span is [-47,0], includes 0.\n\nAt T=27, span: [ -47 +48(1), 48(1) ] = [1,48], 1 to 48, 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly for other T.\n\nSo only at T=26, freeway 8 has a car at x=0.\n\nTherefore, for all T ≠ 26, freeway 8 is safe; no car at x=0.\n\nT=26 has car, but other times no.\n\nNow, freeway 7, as before, at T=27 and T=30, cars at x=0.\n\nNow, I start at turn t1=26, y=7.\n\nAt turn 26, on y=7, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: I can go up to y=8, but when?\n\nIf I take action U at turn 26, then y_{27} = 8.\n\nAt turn 27, I am on y=8.\n\nBut at turn 27, on y=8, is there a car at x=0?\n\nFreeway 8: at T=27, no car, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 8 is safe except T=26.\n\nT=27: span [1,48], no 0.\n\nSo if I am on y=8 at turn 27, it should be safe.\n\nThen I can take another U to go to y=9 at turn 28.\n\nAt turn 28, on y=9, but y=9 is not a freeway, it's the goal, I think no cars there, so safe.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, but I start at y=7, go to y=9, which is top.\n\nSo y=9 has no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 has no cars, but I'm not going there.\n\nSo if I do U at turn 26 and U at turn 27:\n\nAt turn 26: action a_{26} = U, so y_{27} = 7 +1 =8\n\nAt turn 27: I am on y=8.\n\nNow, at turn 27, on y=8, freeway 8 has no car at x=0, as above.\n\nThen action a_{27} = U, y_{28} =9\n\nAt turn 28: on y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nTotal turns from start: at turn 26 I start, after two actions, at turn 28 I reach y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0 is turn t1=26.\n\nAfter H turns, I am at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSet τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, turn 26.\n\nAt τ=0, y=7.\n\nAfter actions, at some τ, y=9.\n\nMinimal H such that after H actions, y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt time τ=0, position y.\n\nAfter first action, at τ=1, y updated.\n\nAfter k actions, at time τ=k, position y_{t1 + k}\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9? From the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nAfter action at τ=H-1, at time τ=H, y_{t1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet the turns be indexed by t, where t = t1 + τ for τ=0,1,2,...\n\nAt turn t, position (0, y_t)\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t = t1 to t1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is y_{t1 + H}\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), so y_{t1 + H} =9? But the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, position should be (0,9)\n\nAnd actions from t= t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, action a_{t1} affects y_{t1+1}\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, action a_{t1 + H -1} affects y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we need position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9)\n\nSo y_{t1 + H -1} =9\n\nThe action at turn t1 + H -1 will change it to y_{t1 + H}, but we care about the position at the start of the turn before action, I think.\n\nPosition at turn t is y_t before action? The problem doesn't specify, but from collision, it seems position at turn t is where you are during the turn.\n\nAnd action is taken during the turn, affecting next turn.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, you are on y_T, and if collision, game over.\n\nSo to succeed, at turn t1 + H -1, you must be at (0,9) with no collision at that turn.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, no collision possible.\n\nIn this case, for me, start at τ=0 (turn 26), y=7.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nMinimal T.\n\nSince I need to increase y by 2, minimal is 2 turns later? At turn 27, y could be 8 or 7 or 6, etc.\n\nLet me set τ relative to t1.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 26), y=7.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + τ} at time τ, y_{t1 + τ +1} is set.\n\nBut position at time τ is y_{t1 + τ}\n\nWe need for some H, at time τ = H-1, position y_{t1 + H -1} =9\n\nAnd actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at τ=0, y=7; at τ=1, y=7 if S, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly.\n\nIf I take U at τ=0: at τ=0, action U, so y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} +1 =8\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position y=8.\n\nThen if I take U at τ=1 (turn t1+1), y_{t1+2} =8+1=9\n\nThen at turn t1+2, position y=9.\n\nSo at τ=2, position is 9.\n\nτ=2 corresponds to turn t1+2.\n\nWe need position at turn t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nSo if at τ=2, position=9, that is turn t1+2, so t1 + H -1 = t1+2, thus H-1=2, H=3.\n\nH is the number of turns, actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn this case, actions at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nAfter two actions, at τ=2, position is 9.\n\nt1 + H -1 = t1 + (H-1)? Let index.\n\nSet k = H-1, the time index.\n\nAt time k, position should be 9, where k = t1 + τ for some τ.\n\nBut τ from 0.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9\n\nWith actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nEach action changes the next position.\n\ny_{t1} =7 (given)\n\nAfter a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nSimilarly, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9\n\nFor example, if H=1, then we need y_{t1} =9, but it's 7, not.\n\nH=2: need y_{t1 +1} =9\n\ny_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}, so 7 + Δy =9, so Δy=2, but actions only change by -1,0,1, so impossible to reach in one step. Min change per action is 1, from 7 to 9 need at least two up actions.\n\nWith two actions, y_{t1+2} could be 9.\n\ny_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1} = (y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}) + Δy_{t1+1}\n\nSet to 9.\n\nSo if I do U at t1 and U at t1+1, y_{t1+1} =8, y_{t1+2} =9.\n\nThen at turn t1+2, position is 9.\n\nBut we need position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nFor H=2, t1 + H -1 = t1 +1\n\ny_{t1+1} =8, not 9.\n\nFor H=3, t1 + H -1 = t1+2, y_{t1+2}=9, which is good.\n\nSimilarly, if I do nothing, it takes more turns.\n\nSo minimal H is 3, with actions U at t1 and U at t1+1, reaching at turn t1+2.\n\nBut in this case, at turn t1+1, I am on y=8, which must be safe.\n\nNow back to our situation.\n\nAt turn t1=26, y=7, safe.\n\nIf I take U at turn 26, then y_{27} =8.\n\nAt turn 27, I am on y=8.\n\nNow, is y=8 safe at turn 27?\n\nFreeway 8: as above, at T=27, span is [ -47 +48(27-26), 48(27-26) ] = [ -47+48, 48] = [1,48], 1 to 48, 0 not included, so no car at x=0, safe.\n\nThen at turn 27, I take U, so y_{28} =9.\n\nAt turn 28, on y=9, safe.\n\nAnd y=9 is reached at turn t1+2 =28.\n\nNow, t1 + H -1 =28, t1=26, so 26 + H -1 =28, thus H-1=2, H=3.\n\nActions at t=26 and t=27.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 of the actions, with t relative? No.\n\nThe action sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo for H=3, actions at turn 26,27,28? No.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nSequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1 +0} = a_{t1}\n\nt=1, a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nIn this case, if actions at turn 26 and 27, that is two actions, so H=2.\n\nThen position at turn t1 + H -1 = t1 + 2 -1 = t1 +1 =27.\n\nAt turn 27, position should be 9.\n\nBut if I take action at turn 26: a_{26} = U, then y_{27} =8\n\nAt turn 27, position is y_{27}=8, not 9.\n\nThen if I take action at turn 27: a_{27} = U, then y_{28}=9\n\nBut at turn 27, position is 8, not 9.\n\nTo have position at turn t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nIf H=2, t1 + H -1 = t1 +1, so y_{t1+1} must be 9.\n\nBut y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1} =7 + Δy, which can be 6,7,8, not 9. Impossible.\n\nIf H=3, t1 + H -1 = t1 +2, y_{t1+2} must be 9.\n\ny_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1} = (y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}) + Δy_{t1+1} =7 + Δy_{t1} + Δy_{t1+1}\n\nSet to 9, so Δy_{t1} + Δy_{t1+1} =2.\n\nSince each Δy is -1,0,1, the only way is both +1, so U and U.\n\nThen y_{t1+1} =8, y_{t1+2} =9.\n\nAt turn t1+2, position 9.\n\nAnd actions at t1 and t1+1.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=3, actions from t=0 to H-1=2, so actions at τ=0,1,2? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t1 +0} = a_{t1}\n\nt=1: a_{t1+1}\n\nt=2: a_{t1+2} for H=3? H-1=2, so t up to 2, so three actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, a_{t1+2}\n\nBut to reach y_{t1+2}=9, I only need actions at t1 and t1+1, not at t1+2.\n\nAction at t1+2 would affect y_{t1+3}, which is after we have reached.\n\nIn this case, with actions U at t1 and U at t1+1, at turn t1+2, position is 9.\n\nThe action at t1+2 is not needed, and if I do nothing, it stays, but I don't need to specify it.\n\nBut the sequence must include exactly H actions, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor H=3, I need to specify three actions, but the last one might be irrelevant.\n\nBut in this case, since at turn t1+2, position is already 9, I can take any action, say S, but it doesn't matter.\n\nBut I need to reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=3, t1 + H -1 = t1+2, position 9.\n\nIf I take only two actions, H=2, I cannot reach y=9 at turn t1+1.\n\nSo minimal H is 3.\n\nSimilarly, in general, to increase by 2, need at least two actions, so H=3 minimal.\n\nNow back to collision.\n\nIn my plan: at turn 26, action U, so y_{27} =8\n\nAt turn 27, position y=8.\n\nIs turn 27 safe on y=8? Freeway 8, at T=27, no car at x=0, as span [1,48], safe.\n\nThen at turn 27, action U, so y_{28} =9\n\nAt turn 28, position y=9, safe.\n\nBut at turn 27, when I am on y=8, it is safe.\n\nWhat about freeway 7? I am not on it at that time.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 26, I am on y=7, which is safe.\n\nThen I move to y=8 at turn 27.\n\nBut freeway 7 has a collision at turn 27? At turn 27, on freeway 7, there is a car at x=0, but I am not on y=7 at turn 27; I am on y=8 at turn 27.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 30, but I am at y=9 by then.\n\nSo with H=3, actions: at turn 26: U, turn 27: U.\n\nBut for H=3, I need three actions.\n\nSequence for t=0,1,2: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, a_{t1+2}\n\nWith a_{26} = U, a_{27} = U, then at turn 28, position y=9.\n\nBut we need position at turn t1 + H -1 =26 +3 -1=28 to be 9, which it is.\n\na_{28} can be anything, say S, since it doesn't affect.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any problem.\n\nAt turn 26: position y=7, action U.\n\nCollision check: at turn 26, on y=7, no car at x=0, safe.\n\nAfter action, y_{27}=8.\n\nTurn 27: position y=8, action U.\n\nCollision: at turn 27, on y=8, freeway 8: at T=27, no car at x=0, safe.\n\nAfter action, y_{28}=9.\n\nTurn 28: position y=9, which is the goal, and no collision since no freeway.\n\nNow, but I need to output for H=3, actions at t=26,27,28.\n\nBut action at t=28 is after reaching, but I have to include it.\n\nPerhaps I can do it with H=2, but impossible as above.\n\nAnother way: if I stay first, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I do S at turn 26, then y_{27}=7, position at turn 27 is still 7.\n\nThen at turn 27, if I do U, y_{28}=8, position at turn 28 is 8, not 9.\n\nTo reach at turn t1 + H -1=9.\n\nIf H=2, need at turn 27 position=9, impossible.\n\nH=3, at turn 28 position=9, with two U actions.\n\nAction at turn 28 can be S or whatever.\n\nIn this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut is there a problem at turn 27 on freeway 8?\n\nFreeway 8 is safe at T=27.\n\nBut what about other freeways? I don't care, since I'm on y=8.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 8 cars.\n\nFreeway 8 has only one car: (0,-47,right,48)\n\nAt T=27: span [ -47 +48(1), 48(1) ] = [1,48], yes, min=1>0, no 0.\n\nSimilarly, no other cars.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, it says (0,-47,right,48), head=0, tail=-47.\n\nAt T=26, span [ -47, 0], includes 0.\n\nAt T=27, [1,48], not include 0.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, but in my sequence, I go directly up.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 27, when I am on y=8, is there any issue.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I should wait because of freeway 7 or something, but I'm leaving it.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 7 has collision at turn 27, but I'm not there.\n\nAt turn 27, freeway 7 has a car at x=0, but I'm on y=8, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=3, actions: at turn 26: U, turn 27: U, and turn 28: say S.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn 28.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps I can set H=2, but impossible.\n\nUnless I can reach faster, but no.\n\nAnother idea: can I reach in one turn? No, because y changes by at most 1 per action.\n\nSo minimal H is 3.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nt1=26\n\nAt turn 26: position y=7\n\nAction a_{26}: U → y_{27} =8\n\nAt turn 27: position y=8\n\nAction a_{27}: U → y_{28} =9\n\nAt turn 28: position y=9\n\nWe need for H, at turn t1 + H -1 =26 + H -1, position=9.\n\nSet 26 + H -1 =28, so H-1=2, H=3.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the action sequence, for t from 0 to H-1=2, so three actions: a_{26}, a_{27}, a_{28}\n\na_{26}=U, a_{27}=U, a_{28} can be S (or U or D, but y=9, if U, y_{29}=10, but y max 9? y from 0 to 9, so if y=9, U might not be allowed, or y stays 9.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=9, U would make y=10, but constrained to 9, I think.\n\nSimilarly for D at y=0.\n\nSo probably, at y=9, U or D might be invalid, or y stays.\n\nThe problem says: y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if action would take it out, it stays, I assume.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 28, position y=9, if I take U, y_{29} would be 10, but clamped to 9, so same as S.\n\nSimilarly, D to 8, but I don't want to.\n\nSo for a_{28}, I can put S.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I need to output only until the reach, but since H=3, I must include three actions.\n\nPerhaps H can be less if I start from different point, but no.\n\nAnother thought: can I be at y=9 at an earlier turn?\n\nAt turn 26, y=7, not 9.\n\nTurn 27, y could be 8 max, not 9.\n\nSo turn 28 is earliest possible.\n\nThus H=3 is minimal.\n\nNow, but I need to make sure that during the path, no collision.\n\nIn this case, at turn 26, on y=7, safe.\n\nTurn 27, on y=8, safe.\n\nTurn 28, on y=9, safe.\n\nBut what about when I take action? The collision is only based on position at the turn, not during move, I think.\n\nThe note says that when moving, at turn T, I am on y_T, not on y_{T+1} yet.\n\nSo in this case, no issue.\n\nBut let me check freeway 7 at other times, but I'm not there.\n\nPerhaps I should check if I need to avoid moving when cars are coming, but since I move directly, it seems fine.\n\nBut there is a car on freeway 7 at turn 27, but I am at y=8 at that turn, so no.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see freeway 8 again.\n\nFreeway 8 has only at T=26 collision, but I am not on it then.\n\nAt T=27, safe.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 8, it says (0,-47,right,48), head=0, tail=-47.\n\nAt T=26, head at 0, tail at -47.\n\nAt T=27, head at 48, tail at 1, so x=0 not covered.\n\nGood.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but I don't use them.\n\nBut I might need to go through y=7 and y=8 only.\n\ny=7 to y=8 to y=9.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, with actions U and U, it should work.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 5,6,7, but I only care when I am on that row.\n\nFor example, freeway 7 has cars that cover x=0 at T=27 and T=30, but at T=27 I am on y=8, not y=7.\n\nAt T=26, I am on y=7, but no car then.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it is fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to specify for each turn.\n\nBut H=3, actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2.\n\nt1=26.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: S (or anything)\n\nBut in the sequence, for t from 0 to 2: a_{26}, a_{27}, a_{28}\n\na_{26}=U, a_{27}=U, a_{28}=S\n\nNow, but let me confirm if at turn 27, when I am on y=8, it is indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 8: only one car, as above.\n\nBut in the table, freeway 8: (0,-47,right,48), yes.\n\nPerhaps I should list all freeways to be sure.\n\nFreeway 1: cars (54,43,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFor first car: at T, span [43 +6(T-26), 54 +6(T-26)]\n\n0 in this: 43+6(τ) <=0 <=54+6(τ) where τ=T-26\n\n43+6τ <=0? 6τ <= -43, τ <= -43/6 ≈ -7.166, impossible for τ>=0.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound 54+6τ >=0 always for τ>=0.\n\nBut L=43+6τ >=43>0 for τ>=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span for τ>=0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [ -23 +6τ, -12 +6τ ]\n\n0 in: -23+6τ <=0 and -12+6τ >=0\n\n-23+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=23 => τ <= 23/6 ≈3.833, τ<=3\n\n-12+6τ >=0 => 6τ >=12 => τ>=2\n\nSo τ=2,3\n\nAt τ=2, T=28, L= -23+12= -11<=0, U= -12+12=0>=0\n\nAt τ=3, T=29, L= -23+18= -5<=0, U= -12+18=6>=0\n\nBut for freeway 1, which is y=1, I am not on it, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same.\n\nFreeway 3: (0,-47,right,48), same as freeway 8, but y=3.\n\nAt T=26, span [-47,0], 0 in.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nBut I am not on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same.\n\nFreeway 5: cars (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst car: [25 +12τ, 36+12τ], L=25+12τ >=25>0 for τ>=0, never <=0, so 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-59 +12τ, -48+12τ]\n\n0 in: -59+12τ <=0 and -48+12τ >=0\n\n-59+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=59 => τ <= 59/12≈4.916, τ<=4\n\n-48+12τ >=0 => 12τ >=48 => τ>=4\n\nSo τ=4, T=30\n\nL= -59+48= -11<=0, U= -48+48=0>=0\n\nThird car: [-23+12τ, -12+12τ]\n\n0 in: -23+12τ <=0 and -12+12τ >=0\n\n-23+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=23 => τ <= 23/12≈1.916, τ<=1\n\n-12+12τ >=0 => 12τ >=12 => τ>=1\n\nSo τ=1, T=27\n\nL= -23+12= -11<=0, U= -12+12=0>=0\n\nBut for freeway 5, y=5, not relevant to me.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 and 7 same as 5.\n\nFor freeway 7, as I had earlier.\n\nAt T=27, car C covers x=0.\n\nAt T=30, car B covers.\n\nBut again, not issue for me.\n\nSo back to my plan.\n\nThus, with actions U at turn 26 and U at turn 27, I reach y=9 at turn 28.\n\nFor the sequence, with H=3:\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nNow, in the output, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: a_{26}\nTurn 27: a_{27}\nTurn 28: a_{28}\n}\n\nWith a_{26}=U, a_{27}=U, a_{28}=S\n\nBut since the player is already at y=9, a_{28} could be anything, but S is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can set H=2, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: if I move up immediately, but I have to.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=7 for one turn, but that would make H larger.\n\nFor example, if I do S at turn 26, then at turn 27, y=7, but at turn 27, on y=7, there is a car! Freeway 7 at T=27 has car at x=0, so if I stay, I collide at turn 27.\n\nExactly.\n\nIf I take S at turn 26, then y_{27}=7, position at turn 27 is y=7.\n\nAt turn 27, on freeway 7, car C has span at T=27: for car C, τ=1, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], which includes 0, so collision!\n\nThus, if I stay at turn 26, at turn 27 I collide.\n\nSo I must not be on y=7 at turn 27.\n\nTherefore, I must move away from y=7 before turn 27.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot stay; I must take action to change y.\n\nAt turn 26, I can take U or D.\n\nIf I take D, y_{27}=6, then I go down, which is worse, and I need to come back, taking more turns.\n\nSo better to take U.\n\nThen at turn 27, on y=8, safe.\n\nThen take U to y=9.\n\nIf I take U at turn 26, y_{27}=8, then at turn 27, I am on y=8, safe, not on y=7.\n\nThen U to y=9.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd I cannot reach faster.\n\nSo minimal H=3.\n\nThus the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, I need to write the turns.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: S\n}\n\nBut for turn 28, since it's the last action, and position is already 9 at turn 28, but the action is taken, but it doesn't affect the position since y=9, S keeps it.\n\nI could put U, but y stays 9.\n\nBut S is fine.\n\nNow, in the car state, I think I covered all.\n\nBut just to be paranoid, is there any car on y=8 at other times? No, only at T=26.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn 26 and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway row y at turn T and a car on that row has a span that includes x=0 at that exact turn.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial Position (Turn 26)**: At turn 26, the player is on y=7. Freeway 7 has cars, but at T=26, no car spans x=0 (as calculated: car A: span [25, 36], car B: span [-59, -48], car C: span [-23, -12]; all miss 0). Thus, it is safe to be on y=7 at turn 26.\n- **Target Position**: To reach y=9 from y=7, the player must increase y by 2. Since each action changes y by at most ±1, at least two \"U\" actions are required. The minimal sequence involves moving up twice, reaching y=9 at turn 28.\n- **Collision Avoidance**:\n  - **Turn 27 (y=8)**: Freeway 8 has one car with span at T=27: [-47 + 48(27-26), 48(27-26)] = [1, 48], which does not include 0. Thus, y=8 is safe at turn 27.\n  - **Turn 28 (y=9)**: y=9 has no freeway, so no collision is possible.\n- **Turn 27 Hazard on y=7**: If the player stays on y=7 at turn 27, collision occurs because freeway 7 has a car spanning [-11, 0] at T=27 (car C). Thus, the player must leave y=7 by turn 27.\n- **Minimal Turns**: Starting at turn 26 (y=7), after two \"U\" actions:\n  - Turn 26: U → y=8 at turn 27.\n  - Turn 27: U → y=9 at turn 28.\n  - The position at turn 28 is (0,9), which is the goal. Since H=3, the sequence includes three actions (turns 26, 27, 28). The action at turn 28 does not affect the position (y=9 is maintained with S, U, or D), so S is used.\n\n### Sequence:\n- Minimal number of turns H = 3.\n- Actions: U at turn 26, U at turn 27, S at turn 28.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,8) at turn t1 = 27. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Since the player is at y=8, and we need to get to y=9, which is probably the top row, and since y=9 might be safe because there are no freeways above it, I think y=9 is the target and has no cars.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, with y clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T (from 1 to 8), and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T. The span is the segment covered by the car, and it moves left or right based on direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide an action to go to y_{T+1}. But for collision, at turn T, you are on y_T, so you check cars on that freeway at turn T. If you move to a different freeway, you're not on the new one until turn T+1.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=27. For future turns, we need to compute where the cars are based on their movement.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at t=27.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars\n\n- Car 1: head 60, tail 49, direction right, speed 6. Since direction is right, and head > tail? Head 60, tail 49, and direction right, so it's moving right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the data.\n\nFreeway 1:\n\n- First car: h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=6\n\n- Second car: h=-6, τ=-17, d=right, s=6\n\nτ should be the tail, so for right-moving, tail should be less than head? Here for first car, τ=49, h=60, so tail left, head right, moving right, so span increasing.\n\nSimilarly, second car, τ=-17, h=-6, so tail -17, head -6, moving right.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \" (60,49,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6) \" so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: (48,1,right,48)\n\nh=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \" (48,1,right,48) \" only one car? The table says \"Cars\" so might be multiple, but here it's listed as one entry.\n\nLooking back: for freeway 1 and 2, it has two cars listed, similarly for 5,6,7 it has three.\n\nFreeway 3: only one car: (48,1,right,48)\n\nFreeway 4: same, (48,1,right,48)\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSimilarly for 6 and 7.\n\nFreeway 8: (48,1,right,48)\n\nNow, player is at y=8 at t=27.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no freeway, I assume it's safe. The freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are probably safe zones or something.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\" and \"reach (0,9)\", so (0,9) should be safe.\n\nNow, at t=27, player is at (0,8), so on freeway 8.\n\nWe need to check if at turn 27, on freeway 8, is there a collision? Collision if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway 8 at turn 27.\n\nFreeway 8 has one car: (48,1,right,48) with s=48.\n\nAt turn t=27, span is [τ + s(T-t1), but T=t1=27, so T-t1=0, so span is [τ, h] = [1,48] for right-moving.\n\nSince direction right, at T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAt T=27, T-t1=0, so span [τ, h] = [1,48]\n\nIs 0 in [1,48]? 0 is not between 1 and 48, so no collision at t=27 on freeway 8.\n\nGood, so player is safe at start.\n\nNow, we need to move to y=9. Since we are at y=8, to go to y=9, we need to move up (U).\n\nBut when we move, at turn T, we perform action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at turn t=27, we are at y=8. We choose action a_{27}, which determines y_{28}.\n\nIf we choose U, then y_{28} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nThen at turn t=28, we are at (0,9), which is the goal, and since no freeway at y=9, no collision.\n\nBut we need to check if during the move, there is any issue, but since we only care about collision when on freeway, and at turn 27 we are on y=8, but we are leaving it, and at turn 28 we are on y=9, safe.\n\nThe collision is only checked when on a freeway, at the turn we are there.\n\nAt turn 27, we are on y=8, freeway, and we checked no collision.\n\nWe take action at turn 27 to go to y_{28}.\n\nIf a_{27} = U, then y_{28} = 9.\n\nAt turn 28, we are at y=9, not a freeway, so no collision check, and we have reached (0,9).\n\nSo in one turn, with H=1, we can reach.\n\nBut is that possible? H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so for H=1, we have one action at t=t1.\n\nIn this case, t1=27, so we do a_{27} = U, then at t=28, y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn indexing.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t1=27 as (0,8).\n\nThen, for each turn t starting from t1, we choose action a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nWe want to reach y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, but relative to t1.\n\nIt says: sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t1 + t.\n\nThen after these actions, we reach the position at time t1 + H.\n\nAfter H actions, we have moved H steps, so at time t1 + H, y is set.\n\nWe start at turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we have y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2}, and so on, up to after a_{t1 + H - 1}, we have y_{t1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the action sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen, after these actions, the position is at time t1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at some turn to be (0,9).\n\nIt says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's see: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nNow, y_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAt turn t1, position is given.\n\nThen at turn t1, we choose action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t1+1, we choose a_{t1+1}, which determines y_{t1+2}, and so on.\n\nSo the position at turn T is y_T.\n\nWe start with y_{t1} given.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then we want y_{t1 + 1 - 1} = y_{t1} =9, but y_{t1} is 8, not 9, so impossible.\n\nIf H=2, we want y_{t1 + 2 - 1} = y_{t1 +1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 +1} is set by action a_{t1}.\n\nSo with a_{t1} = U, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} +1 = 8+1=9.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd we have reached it in one action step, but H=2? Let's see the turn.\n\nt_{reach} = t1 + H - 1\n\nFor H=1, t_{reach} = t1 +1 -1 = t1, but y_{t1}=8 ≠9.\n\nFor H=2, t_{reach} = t1 +2 -1 = t1 +1, and y_{t1+1} can be 9 if a_{t1}=U.\n\nThen we have one action: at t=t1, a_{t1}=U.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so for H=2, t=0,1? t starts from 0.\n\nt=0: a_{t1 +0} = a_{t1}\n\nt=1: a_{t1 +1}\n\nThen after a_{t1+1}, we have y_{t1+2}, but we want y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{t1 +2 -1} = y_{t1+1}\n\nWith actions at t1 and t1+1, we affect y_{t1+1} and y_{t1+2}.\n\ny_{t1+1} is determined by a_{t1}, and y_{t1+2} by a_{t1+1}, etc.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, that means at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nFor H=1, turn t1, position is 8, not 9.\n\nFor H=2, turn t1+1, position is 9 if we do a_{t1}=U, and we don't need to do a_{t1+1}, but in the sequence, we have to specify actions up to H-1.\n\nFor H=2, we specify a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}, but we only need to reach at turn t1+1, so a_{t1+1} can be anything, but we must avoid collision during the path.\n\nLet's see the collision points.\n\nAt each turn, when on a freeway, we must not have collision.\n\nFor H=2, we want y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nTo achieve that, we do a_{t1} = U, then y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nNow, during this, we need to check for collision at the turns we are on freeway.\n\nAt turn t1=27, we are on y=8, freeway 8, and we checked no collision at t=27.\n\nThen at turn t1+1=28, we are on y=9, not a freeway, so no collision check.\n\nSo with one action, at t=27, U, we reach y=9 at turn 28.\n\nBut the turn we reach is t1+1 =28.\n\nNow, for H, we have y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{27 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 27 + H -1 =28, so H-1=1, H=2.\n\nThen the action sequence is for t=0 to H-1=1, so two actions? t=0 and t=1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, for H=2, t=0 and t=1.\n\nActions at t1 + t for t=0: a_{27}, and t=1: a_{28}.\n\nBut we only need a_{27} to go to y=9 at t=28.\n\na_{28} is for y_{29}, but we don't care, since we reached at t=28.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that all actions are valid, meaning that during the sequence, we don't collide, but since we reach at t=28, and after that, it might not matter, but we have to specify the actions up to H-1.\n\nIn this case, for H=2, we need to specify a_{27} and a_{28}.\n\na_{27} = U to go to y=9 at t=28.\n\nThen a_{28} can be, say, S or whatever, but since we are at y=9, moving doesn't change, but we need to make sure that at turn t=28, we are at y=9, safe, and for a_{28}, if we do U or D, y might go to 10 or 8, but y is clamped to [0,9], so if y=9, U: y= min(9+1,9)=9, D: y=max(9-1,0)=8, S: y=9.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t=28, and for the action at t=28, it affects y_{29}, but since we reached at t=28, it should be fine.\n\nHowever, during the action sequence, we might be on freeway at some turns.\n\nIn this case, only at t=27 we are on freeway, which is safe.\n\nAt t=28, we are at y=9, not freeway.\n\nThen for a_{28}, we can choose S, for example, to stay at y=9.\n\nIf we choose U or D, y might change, but we are already at the goal at t=28, so to minimize actions, we should just do what is necessary.\n\nBut H=2, with two actions.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=1, but for H=1, y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{27} =8 ≠9, so impossible.\n\nSo minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions to make sure that at t=27, on freeway 8, no collision, which we have.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), and freeway 8 has car with span [1,48] at t=27, 0 not in [1,48], so safe.\n\nNow, but there are other freeways, but since we are only on y=8 at t=27, and we move to y=9 at t=28, we never go to other freeways, so no need to check.\n\nSo with a_{27} = U, we go to y=9 at t=28.\n\nThen a_{28} can be S, to stay, or anything, but since we reached at t=28, and H=2, we need to specify both actions.\n\nThe sequence should be:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = S (for example)\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=1, but impossible as above.\n\nPerhaps H=1 is not possible, so H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut I feel like it might be too straightforward, and there might be a catch with the cars.\n\nPerhaps at the moment we move, but the collision is only at the turn we are on the freeway.\n\nAnother thing: when we are at y=8 at t=27, and we do U, we leave to y=9 at t=28.\n\nBut at t=27, we are on y=8, and we are fine.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, at later times, but since we leave, no issue.\n\nBut let's check if for some reason we cannot move up immediately.\n\nPerhaps on freeway 8, at t=27, it's safe, but let's see the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: car (48,1,right,48) at t=27, span [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSpeed is 48, so it moves fast.\n\nAt t=28, span would be [1 + 48*(1), 48 + 48*1] = [49,96], far away.\n\nNo car near 0 at any time for this car.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, but we don't care since we are not on them.\n\nBut player starts at y=8, and we can go directly to y=9.\n\nBut why is the initial position at y=8? And there are cars on other freeways, but since we don't go there, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if y=9 is reachable directly.\n\nAnother thought: y=9 might not be a freeway, but when we are at y=9, it's safe, and we can be there.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so we need to be at that position.\n\nIn this case, it seems possible in one move.\n\nBut with H=2 actions? Let's clarify H.\n\nPerhaps I can have only one action.\n\nLet's read the action sequence definition.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for H=1, it would be only t=0, a_{t1}, and then we want y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =9, but y_{t1}=8, so impossible.\n\nFor H=2, sequence t=0: a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, and we want y_{t1 +2 -1} = y_{t1+1} =9.\n\nSo we need to set y_{t1+1} =9, which requires a_{t1} = U, since y_{t1} =8.\n\nThen a_{t1+1} can be S, U, or D, but if we do D, y goes back to 8, but at turn t= t1+1, we are at y=9, which is the goal, so it doesn't matter what we do after, as long as we reach at that turn.\n\nBut to be safe, we can set a_{t1+1} = S to stay at 9.\n\nSimilarly, U would keep at 9, D would go to 8, but at turn t1+1, we are at 9 for that turn.\n\nSo for the sequence, we can have:\n\nTurn t1: U\n\nTurn t1+1: S\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut is there a way with H=1? No, as above.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn t1 with H=1, but impossible.\n\nSo minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let's check if at t=27, on freeway 8, it is safe, which it is.\n\nBut there might be cars on other freeways that could affect, but we are not on them.\n\nThe only potential issue is if for some action, we go to another freeway, but in this case, we go directly to y=9.\n\nPlayer is at (0,8), and we move to (0,9).\n\nNow, the vertical axis is y=0 to 9, with freeways at y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, safe.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut why are there cars on freeway 8? Let's see the car on freeway 8: (48,1,right,48), at t=27, span [1,48], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAt any other time, the car is far.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, but irrelevant.\n\nPerhaps for the action, we need to make sure that during the move, but the collision is only at the discrete turns when on freeway.\n\nAnother thing: the note says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, at turn T, we are on y_T, so we check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nIf we move to y_{T+1}, at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, so we check cars there at turn T+1.\n\nIn our case, at T=27, on y=8, safe.\n\nAt T=28, on y=9, no freeway, no check.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, with a_{27} = U, we go to y=9 at t=28.\n\nThen for the sequence, H=2, actions at t=27 and t=28.\n\na_{27} = U\n\na_{28} = S (to stay)\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nBut let's write in terms of t1.\n\nt1=27.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t1: U\n\nTurn t1+1: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut I feel like this might be too simple, and perhaps I missed something with the cars.\n\nMaybe on freeway 8, at t=27, it is safe, but let's check the car for freeway 8.\n\nCar: h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48.\n\nAt t=27, span [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSpeed 48, so after one turn, at t=28, span [1+48, 48+48] = [49,96], even farther.\n\nNo problem.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, but we don't go there.\n\nAnother thing: player is at (0,8), and the car spans are for the horizontal position, but since player is always at x=0, we only care if 0 is in the span.\n\nFor freeway 8, 0 not in span.\n\nBut let's look at freeway 7, for example, since it's close, but we are not on it.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nAt t=27.\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12, span at t=27: since right, [τ, h] = [37,48]? No.\n\nFor right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAt T=t1=27, T-t1=0, so span [τ, h] = [37,48] for first car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=-47, h=-36, span [-47,-36]\n\nThird car: τ=-11, h=0, span [-11,0]\n\nh=0, τ=-11, so for right-moving, span at T=27: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nNow, 0 is in [-11,0], since it includes endpoints? The span is [τ, h], which is closed interval I assume.\n\nSo 0 is in [-11,0], so for freeway 7, at t=27, if player is on y=7, there would be collision at x=0.\n\nBut player is at y=8, not on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nBut in our case, we are only on y=8 at t=27, which is safe, and then to y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps to be thorough, let's see if we need to go through other freeways, but we don't.\n\nSo I think with H=2, it is possible.\n\nBut the player is already at y=8, and y=9 is adjacent, so why not go directly?\n\nUnless at the target position there is an issue, but y=9 has no cars.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 2, with actions U then S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=2, we have two actions.\n\nPerhaps we can have only one action if we consider the position at turn t1, but we can't.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at turn t1, we can do nothing, but y=8, not 9.\n\nOr move down, but that would be away.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, I think H=2 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 27\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 27, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 has initial span at turn 27 given by \\([ \\tau, h ] = [1, 48]\\) for direction right, and since \\(0 \\notin [1, 48]\\), there is no collision at turn 27.\n\nTo reach \\(y = 9\\), the player must move up (U) at turn 27. This action sets \\(y_{28} = 8 + 1 = 9\\). At turn 28, the player is at (0, 9), which is not a freeway (freeways are only at \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so no collision check is needed, and the position (0, 9) is reached.\n\nThe turn when (0, 9) is reached is turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 27 + H - 1\\). Setting this equal to 28 gives \\(27 + H - 1 = 28\\), so \\(H = 2\\).\n\nFor \\(H = 2\\), the sequence of actions is for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = 1\\) (since \\(H - 1 = 1\\)):\n- At turn \\(t_1 + 0 = 27\\), action \\(a_{27} = U\\) to move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 28.\n- At turn \\(t_1 + 1 = 28\\), since the goal is already reached at turn 28, any action can be chosen, but to remain at (0, 9), the action \\(a_{28} = S\\) (stay) is selected.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns (\\(H = 2\\)) with no collisions, as the only freeway occupied (at turn 27) is safe.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: S\n}",
